The causative agent is a _Phlebovirus_ (Bunyaviridae) and the vector are mosquitos of different genera, especially _Aedes_. Infection in humans causes influenza-like illness complicated by hemorrhagic fever, encephalitis, ocular damage, and, in some cases, death.\n\nWild ruminants, especially African buffalos, and some domestic ruminants may be involved in the maintenance of RVF virus. Natural and experimental infections by RVF virus have been documented in several mammalian orders, including Artiodactyla, Chiroptera, Rodentia, Primata (nonhuman), Perissodactyla, Carnivora, and others. Mosquitos are considered to be the maintenance hosts, and wild ruminants and other mammals may serve as amplifying hosts.\n\nRoan antelopes (_Hippotragus equinus_) is a large savanna bovid found in West and Central Africa.

In desert environments, the oases also provide suitable ecological conditions for the proliferation of mosquito populations. The weather forecast for the coming months highlights above-average rains in the area. This could maintain the ecological conditions for outbreak persistence if competent RVF mosquitoes occur in the area. However, it is not known whether RVF-competent species are present in Al Jawf because this information is not available.\n\nThe origin of the outbreak is not known but could be related to the illegal movement of infected animals from neighbouring countries.\n\nInformation on the climatic and ecological situation of the 2 new outbreaks, situated considerably west of the earlier outbreaks (map at https://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=32934), will be useful.

The virus is confined to the African continent and Arabian Peninsula. It is caused by a single serotype of a mosquito-borne virus of the _Phenuiviridae_ family (genus _Phlebovirus_). The disease occurs in climatic conditions favoring the breeding of mosquito vectors and is characterised by abortion, neonatal mortality and liver damage. The disease is most severe in sheep, goats and cattle. Older non-pregnant animals, although susceptible to infection, are more resistant to clinical disease. There is considerable variation in the susceptibility to RVF of animals of different species. Camels usually have an inapparent infection with RVF virus (RVFV), but sudden mortality, neonatal mortality and abortion occur and abortion rates can be as high as in cattle.\n\nHumans are susceptible to RVFV and are infected through contact with infected animal material (body fluids or tissues) or through bites from infected mosquitoes. RVFV has also caused serious infections in laboratory workers and must be handled with biosafety and biocontainment measures. It is recommended that laboratory workers be vaccinated if possible.\n\nRVFV is endemic in many African countries and may involve several countries in the region at the same time or progressively expand geographically over the course of a few years. In addition to Africa, large outbreaks have been observed in the Arabian Peninsula and some Indian Ocean islands. These generally, but not exclusively, follow the periodic cycles of unusually heavy rainfall, which may occur at intervals of several years, or the flooding of wide areas favoring the proliferation of mosquitoes.\n\nRainfall facilitates mosquito eggs to hatch. _Aedes_ mosquitoes acquire the virus from feeding on infected animals, and may potentially vertically transmit the virus, so that new generations of infected mosquitoes may hatch from their eggs. This provides a potential mechanism for maintaining the virus in nature, as the eggs of these mosquitoes may survive for periods of up to several years in dry conditions. Once livestock is infected, a wide variety of mosquito species may act as the vector for transmission of RVFV and can spread the disease.\n\nLow-level RVF activity may take place during inter-epizootic periods. RVF should be suspected when exceptional flooding and subsequent abundant mosquito populations are followed by the occurrence of abortions, together with fatal disease marked by necrosis and hemorrhages in the liver that particularly affect newborn lambs, kids and calves, potentially concurrent with the occurrence of an influenza-like illness in farm workers and people handling raw meat.\n\nDuring an outbreak, preventive measures to protect workers from infection should be employed when there are suspicions that RVFV-infected animals or animal products are to be handled. - Mod.CRD\n\nRVF (animals) was last reported in Mauritania in January 2019, in the southwestern Trarza region, bordering Senegal.\n\nAccording to FAO's Food Chain Crisis Early Warning Bulletin 36 (July-September 2020, at http://www.fao.org/3/cb0160en/cb0160en.pdf; see page 34), the RVF threat ('likelihood of occurrence') for July-September 2020 in Mauritania was generally 'moderate': Disease occurrence was 'likely in some localized areas, due to the presence of suitable environmental conditions for vector amplification, animal movement and informal marketing of infected animals.'\n\nFlooding and invasion of mosquitos was recently reported from the Assaba region, central south Mauritania.

On [10 Oct 2020], Mohamed Hamdan Hemedti, head of paramilitary unit the Rapid Support Forces and vice-president of the sovereign council, said the country was free of the fever. 'We don't have the Rift Valley fever disease in Sudan, we don't have it at all,' he said at an event in Khartoum.\n\nDr Abdulhadi Gendeel, a former lab technician from a village near Merowe, said his uncle, 50, and brother-in-law, 27, had died of the disease, which can affect humans and animals. Both died within 2 days of developing symptoms, he said.\n\n'My brother-in-law got sick first, and they thought it was malaria but it wasn't,' Gendeel said. 'After testing him 3 times, his situation got worse. He had kidney failure and needed a blood transfusion, so he was sent to Khartoum. But many hospitals refused to receive him and at the end, only one hospital agreed to treat him.'\n\nHe added: 'My uncle travelled all the way to see him in Khartoum, but 2 days later we found out that he had developed the same symptoms and died.'\n\nHe said his relatives had developed symptoms similar to jaundice, including low blood pressure and kidney and liver failure.\n\nLast year [2019], 11 people in Sudan died of Rift Valley fever and hundreds more were infected after the disease spread across the Red Sea and Nile states, according to Acaps, an NGO based in Geneva that provides independent humanitarian analysis.\n\nThis year [2020], the 1st cases of the disease among humans appeared in late August, following unprecedented heavy rains and flooding of the Nile. About 10 million people in Sudan are now at risk of contracting waterborne diseases such as cholera due to the flooding, and millions more are at risk of malaria, Acaps said.\n\nEarlier this year, Sudan's former health minister, Akram al-Toum, declared an outbreak of Rift Valley fever among animals.\n\nMona El-Arbab, a public health specialist at Al-Daman private hospital in Merowe, said the hospital had allocated an entire wing for patients with Rift Valley fever. 'We receive about 80 cases a day. Some people come to the hospital bleeding and those [patients] normally die,' she said.\n\nIn response, the government has announced a public health emergency in Merowe but has not confirmed that the outbreak is Rift Valley fever.\n\nThe governor of Merowe, Amal Izzeldien, said 63 people had died and 1512 had been infected by different diseases without specifying what these were. The acting minister of health, Usama Abdul-Rahim, said malaria was spreading and about 70 000 cases were being registered weekly.\n\nIn August [2020], Saudi Arabia returned thousands of Sudanese livestock to the country after saying the animals had not been vaccinated against Rift Valley fever. About 3000 of the animals later died of hunger and thirst at Port Sudan.\n\nDoctors said Northern state did not have a single CBC testing machine to monitor blood counts, which was making their job difficult.\n\nDr Manal Hassan, a GP at Merowe's public hospital, said it was overwhelmed by severe cases of the fever. 'Among 80 cases we receive in a day about 50 of them have been infected by this fever, and I personally saw 3 [people] die of it,' she said.\n\n'Some of the patients were lying under trees in the hospital yard because the fans inside the wards had stopped working,' she added. 'Now they are in the same place as patients suffering from other illnesses, which is very dangerous because they might get infected by the Rift Valley fever as well.'\n\nThe disease is caused [transmitted] by the _Aedes_ mosquito and can be transmitted from animals to humans. 'It's the 1st time since I started working at hospitals that I have seen such a disease. Most of the cases are among people who have animals,' said Hassan. 'The danger of this mosquito is that its eggs [with virus] could live for a long time in the soil.'\n\nWest Darfur state is facing an outbreak of another fever: the chikungunya virus, which has led to several deaths, with thousands of people reported to be infected. A pharmacist and public health practitioner based in the state capital El-Geneina, who did not want to give their name, said some people had died of the disease, and 'almost every household has someone infected by the fever.'\n\nThe chikungunya virus is also transmitted by the _Aedes_ mosquito and causes similar symptoms. In 2018, thousands of people were infected by the virus in the eastern state of Kassala and 7 died, according to the government.\n\nIn El-Geneina, charity volunteer Nasma Abdallah said her 14-year-old nephew had been infected and was unable to walk for 5 days. 'He's been getting some treatment at home,' she said.\n\n[Byline: Zeinab Mohammed Salih]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n\n[Rift Valley fever was suspected in the Northern state in September 2020 when there were 120 human cases with 45 deaths (see PRO/MENA Undiagnosed illness - Sudan (02): (Northern) fatal, Rift Valley fever susp 20200925.7811914). A 15 Oct 2020 report stated that the United Resistance Coordination of Merowe in the Northern State announced that the number of deaths from Rift Valley fever has risen to 79, while the number of recorded cases has reached 1962, including 3 cases of nervous system complications. A total of 4578 miscarriages and deaths have been recorded among livestock (see Rift Valley fever - Sudan: (NO) 20201018.7868637). The report goes on to state that the Northern state Coordination called on the Sudanese Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Animal Resources to declare an epidemic of Rift Valley fever and to open the door for international and voluntary organizations to intervene and assist. It is not clear why these 2 ministries have not done so or provided laboratory results that implicate another etiology. ProMED would be interested in knowing if these ministries will confirm or eliminate this outbreak as Rift Valley fever.\n\nAs noted in the previous post, in a 14 Nov 2019 report, the WHO stated that RVF [Rift Valley fever] is endemic in Sudan. There have been 3 outbreaks affecting humans previously documented in 1973, 1976, and 2008. During the outbreak in 2008, a total of 747 laboratory-confirmed cases were reported, including 230 deaths. The report indicated that following heavy rains on 13 Aug 2019, flooding caused flash floods in 17 of the 18 states, including Abyei area in West Kordofan State. These floods favored vector abundance, distribution, and longevity. The 2019 RVF outbreak started on 19 Sep 2019 and affected states impacted by the floods (see Rift Valley fever - Sudan (07): (RS,RN) human, livestock, WHO 20191120.6787770). Now RVF transmission is active currently (2020) in the Northern State with both humans and livestock affected.\n\nSurveillance and responses to RVF outbreaks require a One Health approach since both humans and animals are affected and environmental change, in this situation extensive flooding, has promoted vector abundance. Effective vector control over extensive geographical areas is difficult to achieve and is expensive. Maintenance of herd immunity through vaccination of animals can be a successful preventive measure prior to the occurrence of cases. - Mod.TY\n\nMaps of Sudan: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/States_of_Sudan and http://healthmap.org/promed/p/30885]", "summary": "\n\nLast year [2019], 11 people in Sudan died of Rift Valley fever and hundreds more were infected after the disease spread across the Red Sea and Nile states, according to Acaps, an NGO based in Geneva that provides independent humanitarian analysis.

IgG levels rise after IgM and are detectable for life. To establish/evaluate the chronology of infection, combined use of IgM and IgG may have been helpful.\n\nNotably, an earlier sero-survey in Libya, restricted to northern (Mediterranean) parts, which are, climatologically/ecologically more suitable for RVF circulation, did not discover positives. The authors concluded: 'This study was conducted to investigate the epidemiological situation of RVFV in Libya. The viral circulation has not been detected in 11 provinces of the country as determined by absence of RVFV antibodies in animals tested during the sampling period. However, the evidence of RVFV activity in countries bordering the Southern part of Libya [Chad and Sudan] supports the hypothesis of a continuous risk of introduction of RVFV through animals imported from endemic neighbor countries.' [1].\n\nSudan, a livestock exporting country, and Chad, are known to be RVF-infected. Another neighbor country of Libya, Egypt on its west, has been suffering RVF events since 1977.\n\nOIE's terminology for the reporting of disease events may gain from some added flexibility. A single diseased animal is either a sheep or a goat, even in mixed small ruminant flocks (termed 'sheep/goats,' in OIE reports). The OIE term 'sheep/goats' has, therefore, been changed in the above copied report to 'sheep &/or goats.'\n\nReference\n1. Mahmoud AS, Di Sabatino D, Danzetta ML et al.

The 5th outbreak (mentioned above) was registered in a slaughterhouse. Rift Valley fever virus [RVFV] is a zoonotic arbovirus that causes considerable human and animal morbidity and mortality. In this context, special attention must be paid to the slaughterhouse worker. Also, as mentioned in the report above, laboratory results are pending. - Mod.SF]\n\n[According to the report, the animals were diagnosed in a slaughterhouse. Since 2 'species' are included, one being 'sheep/goats,' the other one 'sheep,' it may be assumed that those were 2 consignments arriving at the slaughterhouse, one composed of both sheep and goats (a mixed flock) and the other one of sheep only. It will be helpful to note if clinical signs have led to the diagnosis on top of the serologic tests (IgM-capture ELISA) applied at the laboratory. Since 4 deaths were reported, samples for PCR could have been helpful for confirmation of active RVF.\n\nRVFV activity in countries bordering the southern part of Libya [Chad and Sudan] supports the hypothesis of a continuous risk of introduction of RVFV through animals imported from endemic neighbor countries.'

The case had travel history to South Sudan between 12 and 19 Nov 2019 to harvest cassava.\n\nWhile in his home country, he developed fever and other symptoms and was treated for malaria; however, his condition got worse.\n\nHe later returned to the refugee camp in Uganda and his symptoms progressed and he was hospitalized. Viral hemorrhagic fever was suspected.\n\nSamples were collected and sent to the Uganda Virus Research Institute; however, the patient died.\n\nA safe and dignified burial was performed on 22 Nov 2019. As of 24 Nov 2019, a total of 19 contacts were recorded during the active case search including 10 healthcare workers.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The circumstances and specific location under which the man became infected with Rift Valley fever (RVF) virus in South Sudan is not mentioned. It is worth noting that there was an RVF outbreak in the Eastern Lakes region of South Sudan during the 1st 3 months of last year (2018). At the end of that outbreak, the OIE's follow-up report no. 3 reported: 'The event cannot be considered resolved, but the situation is sufficiently stable. No more follow-up reports will be sent. Information about this disease will be included in the next 6-monthly reports.' There were more human cases than animal ones in that outbreak, prompting Mod.AS to comment: 'Unfortunately, during the recent South Sudan RVF event, as in most -- if not all -- previous RVF events in other African countries, humans served as sentinels. Improved surveillance in animals is desperately needed in Africa, to allow timely measures applied, predominantly preventive vaccination, before the development of a full-blown epizootic involving secondary infection in humans.' Intensified surveillance is needed in South Sudan in those localities where the affected man had been prior to his return to Uganda.\n\nIt is likely that RVF virus has persisted in this area in transovarially infected eggs of _Aedes_ mosquito vectors. These eggs can remain viable for long periods of time and hatch when flooded during future rain events, with the subsequent emergence of infected females ready to transmit the virus. This risk provides justification for maintaining livestock of the area well vaccinated into the future. This may have accounted for the reappearance of RVF in South Sudan in 2018, after nearly 2 years without additional reported cases in humans or livestock and again with this human case in 2019. - Mod.TY\n\nObongi district, Uganda is located approximately 50 km (30 mi) from the South Sudan border.\nHealthMap/ProMED-mail maps:\nUganda: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/65264\nSouth Sudan: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/8402\n\nAccording to OIE's data, a total of 2 outbreaks of RVF affecting animals have been reported from Sudan during the event. The 1st outbreak started in the Arabaata dam area, Red Sea state, on 25 Sep 2019, affecting goats. The 2nd (and, so far, last) outbreak started 10 Oct 2019 in the River Nile state, affecting sheep and goats.

The most affected age group is 15 to 45 years, which accounts for 83% of the total suspected cases. The male to female ratio is 2.6, with a high proportion of the cases being farmers (37.5 per cent). RVF is endemic in Sudan and 3 outbreaks affecting people have been documented in 1973, 1976, and 2008.

People can get RVF through contact with blood, body fluids, or tissues of infected animals, or through bites from infected mosquitoes. Spread from person to person has not been documented.\n\n'Although RVF often causes severe illness in animals, most people with RVF have either no symptoms or a mild illness with fever, weakness, back pain, and dizziness. However, a small percentage (8-10%) of people with RVF develop much more severe symptoms, including eye disease, hemorrhage (excessive bleeding), and encephalitis (swelling of the brain).' (https://www.cdc.gov/vhf/rvf/index.html).\n\n'In June 2018, the Ministry of Health for Kenya confirmed an outbreak of RVF. A total of 26 human cases were reported from Wajir (24 cases, including the 1st patient) and Marsabit (2 cases) counties, including 7 confirmed cases and 6 deaths (case fatality ratio [CFR] = 23%). A high number of deaths and abortions among livestock, including camels and goats, were reported in Garissa, Kadjiado, Kitui, Marsabit, Tana River, and Wajir counties. People living in these counties were reportedly consuming meat from dead and sick animals.' (https://www.cdc.gov/vhf/rvf/outbreaks/summaries.html).\n\nThe latest Food Chain Crisis - Early Warning Bulletin, July-September 2020, issue no. 36, mentioned: 'According to the FAO RVF Monitoring/Early Warning tool, the areas suitable for RVF vector amplification for May 2020 persist in the region, particularly in Burundi, south and central Ethiopia, Kenya, small hotspots in Rwanda, southern Somalia, eastern and southern regions of South Sudan, northern Uganda and the northern part of the United Republic of Tanzania, and to a lesser extent in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Djibouti, Eritrea and Sudan. In addition, some hotspots are also predicted in Cameroon, the Central African Republic, southern Chad along the border with Niger, Egypt (along the river Nile), Nigeria and Yemen. In October-November 2019, cases of RVF in humans and animals were confirmed in River Nile and Red Sea States (northeastern Sudan), and sporadic cases in humans were reported in White Nile, Gedaref, Kassala and Khartoum states. Since December 2019, cases have also been reported in southern Libya, likely due to the movement of infected animals from neighboring countries.\n\n'Considering the past and recent RVF outbreaks in the region, animal movement and the informal marketing of infected animals, as well as the current and forecasted suitability of conditions for vector amplification, the whole region remains at high risk of RVF occurrence.' The bulletin is available at http://www.fao.org/3/cb0160en/cb0160en.pdf.\n\nIn the epidemiological comment was mentioned that 'Surveillance in livestock was prompted by suspicion of Rift Valley fever in humans.' In case suspected or confirmed human cases in Isiolo and/or Garissa or other locations in Kenya are known to have occurred since late 2020, their data deserve becoming public at the earliest. - Mod.CRD/AS\n\nHealthMap/ProMED map:\nKenya: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/174]", "summary": "A ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n Total animals affected\nSpecies / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered\nSheep / 4000 / 10 / 0 / 0 / 0\n\nOutbreak 3: Qalaqal, Masalani, Ijara, Sheep / 14 000 / 12 / 0 / 0 / 0\n\nOutbreak statistics [rates apparent, in percentages]\nSpecies / Morbidity rate / Mortality rate / Case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*\n Total outbreaks: 3\nTotal animals affected\nSpecies / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered\n Epidemiological unit: Village\nAffected animals\nSpecies / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered\n Epidemiological unit: Village\nAffected animals\nSpecies / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered\n Goats / 10 000 / 16 / 0 / 0 / 0\n Sheep / 4000 / 10 / 0 / 0 / 0\n Goats / 4000 / 2 / 0 / 0 / 0\n Manifestation of disease: Clinical disease\nCausal agent: Rift Valley fever virus\n Goats / 6000 / 14 / 0 / 0 / 0\n Sheep / 3000 / 1 / 0 / 0 / 0\n Recurrence of a listed disease\nDate of previous occurrence: 21 Mar 2019\n Goats / 0.16 / 0 / 0 / 0\n Sheep / 0.09 / 0 / 0 / 0\n Summary\nReport type: Immediate notification\n GOAT, SHEEP, OIE\n****************************************************************************\n Communicated by:\nProMED\n< Goats / IgM-capture ELISA / 7 Jan 2021 / Positive\nCentral veterinary investigation laboratory, Kabete (national laboratory) / Sheep / IgM-capture ELISA / 7 Jan 2021 / Positive\nCentral veterinary investigation laboratory, Kabete (national laboratory) / Sheep / IgM-capture ELISA / 7 Jan 2021 / Positive\nCentral veterinary investigation laboratory, Kabete (national laboratory) / Goats / Real-time PCR / 11 Jan 2021 / Positive\nCentral veterinary investigation laboratory, Kabete (national laboratory) / \nInformation received on [and dated] 15 Jan 2021 from Dr. Obadiah Nyaga Njagi, Director of Veterinary Services, Directorate of Veterinary Services, State Department of Livestock, Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Fisheries, Nairobi, Kenya\n\n Vaccination in response to the outbreak(s), vector surveillance\n\nDiagnostic test results\nLaboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result Measures applied: Movement control inside the country, quarantine, disinfection, ante- and post-mortem inspections, vaccination permitted (if a vaccine exist), no treatment of affected animals\nMeasures to be applied: [The location of the outbreaks can be seen on the interactive map at the source URL above.]\n\n--\n Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction, and/or slaughter\n\nEpidemiology\n", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "rift valley fever"], "syndromes": ["encephalitis"], "event_date": ["2020-10-25 00:00:00", "2018-06-25 00:00:00", "2021-01-11 00:00:00", "2019-03-25 00:00:00", "2021-01-07 00:00:00", "2021-03-25 00:00:00", "2020-03-25 00:00:00", "2020-05-25 00:00:00", "2019-12-25 00:00:00", "2020-12-25 00:00:00", "2021-01-15 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Tana River", "country": "Kenya"}, {"location": "Yemen", "country": "Yemen"}, {"location": "Ijara", "country": "Kenya"}, {"location": "South Sudan", "country": "South Sudan"}, {"location": "Ethiopia", "country": "Ethiopia"}, {"location": "Libya", "country": "Libya"}, {"location": "Sudan", "country": "Sudan"}, {"location": "Djibouti", "country": "Djibouti"}, {"location": "Rwanda", "country": "Rwanda"}, {"location": "Chad", "country": "Chad"}, {"location": "the United Republic of Tanzania", "country": "Tanzania"}, {"location": "Isiolo County", "country": "Kenya"}, {"location": "Sericho", "country": "Kenya"}, {"location": "Khartoum", "country": "Sudan"}, {"location": "Burundi", "country": "Burundi"}, {"location": "Cameroon", "country": "Cameroon"}, {"location": "Kassala", "country": "Sudan"}, {"location": "Garissa , Kadjiado", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Balambala", "country": "Kenya"}, {"location": "Somalia", "country": "Somalia"}, {"location": "Garissa County", "country": "Kenya"}, {"location": "Kenya", "country": "Kenya"}, {"location": "Uganda", "country": "Uganda"}, {"location": "Masalani", "country": "Kenya"}, {"location": "the Democratic Republic of the Congo", "country": "DR Congo"}, {"location": "Marsabit", "country": "Kenya"}, {"location": "Nairobi", "country": "Kenya"}, {"location": "Nigeria", "country": "Nigeria"}, {"location": "Eritrea", "country": "Eritrea"}, {"location": "WAHID", "country": "Oman"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "6767771", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Rift Valley fever -

Giza, Egypt), said that a mobile laboratory equipped with a veterinary and technical team has been installed in Aswan to address the Rift Valley fever [RVF] issue related to the outbreak of the disease in Sudan. [The team] collects samples from different places in Aswan governorate to carry out the tasks entrusted to it, in accordance with recognized standards and controls that determine the methods of sampling to ensure transparency in analysis and verification. From the results of analysis and prompt reporting of these results, appropriate decisions can be made to protect Egypt's livestock.\n\nIt was decided to safeguard the exchange of information between public and animal health authorities in order to achieve integration in the performance and implementation of the roles of monitoring and follow-up of any RVF cases appearing either in livestock or passengers coming from Sudan. The awareness and understanding of farmers and breeders dealing positively with the preventive measures are praised; this includes the progress of the RVF vaccination campaign of livestock, required to defend the health of citizens in the Aswan governorate.\n\nDr. Mona Mehrez, deputy minister of Agriculture [for Animal, Fish and Poultry Resources], has pointed out the importance of coordination with the governorate to carry out pesticide spraying against flies and mosquitoes, in particular addressing ponds, swamps, and barns inside various villages and remote areas and markets, especially in foci and areas where there is livestock. Disinfectants and insecticides should be systematically applied in river transport vessels intended for passengers as well as cargo barges operating between Halfa ports in Sudan and the Aswan High Dam as one of the measures to prevent epidemic diseases, including Rift Valley fever, foot-and-mouth disease, and dengue fever.\n\n[Byline: Bossi Jadin Alkarim]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[While RVF may cause serious economic losses in susceptible animals, mainly affecting juvenile sheep, goats, and cattle (in order of severity) and -- to a lesser extent -- camels, the prevention of disease is essential to protect public health. The 1st, explosive epidemic in Egypt took place in 1977; official Egyptian government figures on the human disease indicated 18 000 cases and 598 deaths; later estimates mentioned 200 000 human infections. The clinical spectrum in humans included febrile (most cases), encephalitic (about 800 cases), ocular (at least 800 examined), and hemorrhagic (frequently fatal) cases. The losses in animals were severe (on 4 sheep farms studied, 80-100% of the ewes aborted, 8-60% of adult animals died, and mortality in the few lambs present approached 100%). Camels imported to Egypt from Sudan for local slaughter (mainly in the Cairo abattoir) were suggested as one of the major routes of RVF introduction.\n\nSince 1977, Egypt has been affected by RVF in 1981, 1993, 1994, 1997, and, finally, 2003.\n\nA (September 2018) Egyptian paper (Ref. 1) addressed camels specifically, informing that the incidence of RVFV IgG antibodies was 16.7% in Sudan-originating camels entering Egypt from Sudan during an inter-epidemic period. They reported that only 10% of imported animals were tested upon arrival against RVFV antibodies as a routine disease control. It is anticipated that this sampling/testing rate is already being increased, at least for the duration of the continuing event in Sudan.\n\nA useful analysis of the RVF risk posed by camels imported to Egypt from Sudan is to be found in Ref. 2 (January 2018).\n\nAccording to a new update report, 'Rift Valley Fever Sudan' by UN OCHA, published today (Thu 7 Nov 2019), 31 new human cases, including 2 deaths, have been added since 30 Oct 2019 in the 6 affected states in Sudan. The updated summary follows:\nThe total number of human RVF cases, since the onset of the disease on 28 Sep 2019 until 4 Nov 2019, is 279, including 9 deaths. The cases have been reported from the following 6 states: Red Sea (112), River Nile (162), Khartoum (1), White Nile (1), Gedaref (1), and Kassala (2). The CFR [case fatality rate] is at 3.2%. https://reports.unocha.org/en/country/sudan/?fbclid=IwAR11YZtKQP7CnRKi8OdKTf02Gz1_vTxjXYdh-FQIih3acTEHu7Uvln_of5g.\n\nReferences\n1.

The 1st, explosive epidemic in Egypt took place in 1977; official Egyptian government figures on the human disease indicated 18 000 cases and 598 deaths; later estimates mentioned 200 000 human infections. \n\nIt was decided to safeguard the exchange of information between public and animal health authorities in order to achieve integration in the performance and implementation of the roles of monitoring and follow-up of any RVF cases appearing either in livestock or passengers coming from Sudan. \n\nDr. Mona Mehrez, deputy minister of Agriculture [for Animal, Fish and Poultry Resources], has pointed out the importance of coordination with the governorate to carry out pesticide spraying against flies and mosquitoes, in particular addressing ponds, swamps, and barns inside various villages and remote areas and markets, especially in foci and areas where there is livestock.

The suspected cases presented with high-grade fever, headaches, joint pain, vomiting. There were no hemorrhagic signs or symptoms observed. The 1st case presented to the health facility on 19 Sep 2019.\n\nOn 28 Sep 2019, a total of 14 samples were sent to the National Public Health Laboratory in Khartoum, and 5 tested positive for RVF by immunoglobulin M (IgM) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). These samples were also tested for malaria and were found negative.\n\nOn 13 Oct 2019, a total of 10 suspected RVF cases were recorded in Barbar and Abu Hamed localities, of River Nile State. Of the 10 suspected RVF cases, 5 samples were tested and 4 were found positive for RVF. From 19 Sep 2019 until 11 Nov 2019, a total of 293 suspected human RVF cases, including 11 associated deaths have been reported from 6 states; including the Red Sea (120), River Nile (168), Kassala (2), White Nile (1), Khartoum (1), and Al Qadarif (1) States. The most affected age group is 15-45 years old, which accounts for 83% of the total suspected cases. The male to female ratio is 2.6, with a high proportion of the cases being farmers (37.5%).\n\nThese human RVF cases are concomitant with abortions and deaths among goats in the areas where the human suspected and confirmed cases have been reported. From 25 Sep through 3 Nov 2019, 21 goats in Red Sea State were reported as positive for RVF, including 4 deaths; and in River Nile State 16 goats, with 3 deaths, and 37 sheep, with 5 deaths, were confirmed positive for RVF by ELISA test at the Central Veterinary Research Laboratory in Khartoum.\n\nPublic health response\n----------------------\nRed Sea State\n-------------\n- Activation of RVF task force committee;\n- printing and distribution of RVF guidelines;\n- deployment of surveillance teams for daily reporting and active case finding in the affected areas;\n- establishment of 2 health centers and one dispensary with a capacity of 11 beds, laboratory items, drugs, and supplies to provide health services in the affected villages;\n- conducting household inspections and fogging: In Arb'aat area, a total of 452 households were inspected, out of which 30 were found positive for the presence of a competent vector; in Port Sudan, out of 1225 households inspected, 29 were found positive for the competent vector, and fogging was provided to 1949 households;\n- the Veterinary Epidemiology Department of the Ministry of Animal Resources conducted vector control in 4 animal enclosures in the affected villages.\n\nRiver Nile State\n- A joint investigation conducted by the State Ministry of Health (SMoH) and WHO on 12 Oct 2019;\n- initiation of an RVF Action plan by the SMoH and WHO;\n- initiation of Integrated Vector Management (IVM), surveillance, case management, and Rapid Response Team (RRT) activities.\n\nWHO risk assessment\n-------------------\nRVF is endemic in Sudan. There have been 3 outbreaks affecting humans previously documented in 1973, 1976, and 2008. During the outbreak in 2008, a total of 747 laboratory-confirmed cases were reported, including 230 deaths.\n\nThe recent floods, following heavy rains on 13 Aug 2019, caused flash floods in 17 of the 18 states, including Abyei area in West Kordofan State. These floods have favored vector abundance, distribution, and longevity. The current RVF outbreak started on 19 Sep 2019 and has affected states impacted by the floods.\n\nThe uncontrolled movements of animal populations within and outside the country borders may increase the spread of the disease to new areas.\n\nRVF can cause significant economic losses due to livestock travel and trade restrictions, as well as high mortality and abortion rates among infected animals.\n\nIn a country where the export of livestock is one of the major sources of the national income, the current RVF outbreak, in the context of political unrest and a debilitated health system requires an urgent need for external assistance.\n\nWHO advice\n----------\nRift Valley fever (RVF) is a mosquito-borne viral zoonosis that primarily affects animals but also has the capacity to infect humans. The majority of human infections result from direct or indirect contact with the blood or organs of infected animals. Herders, farmers, slaughterhouse workers, and veterinarians have an increased risk of infection.\n\nAwareness of the risk factors of RVF infection and measures to prevent mosquito bites is the only way to reduce human infection and deaths. Public health messages for risk reduction should focus on:\n- reducing the risk of animal-to-human transmission resulting from unsafe animal husbandry and slaughtering practices;\n- practicing hand hygiene as well as wearing gloves or other personal protective equipment when handling sick animals or their tissues and when slaughtering animals;\n- reducing the risk of animal-to-human transmission arising from the unsafe consumption of raw or unpasteurized milk or animal tissue. in endemic regions, all animal products should be thoroughly cooked before eating;\n- reducing the risk of mosquito bites through the implementation of vector control activities (e.g. insecticide spraying and use of larvicidal to reduce mosquito breeding sites), use of insecticide-impregnated mosquito nets and repellents, light-colored clothing (long-sleeved shirts and trousers);\n- restricting or banning the movement of livestock to reduce the spread of the virus from infected to uninfected areas;\n- routine animal vaccination is recommended to prevent RVF outbreaks. Vaccination campaigns are not recommended during an outbreak as they may intensify transmission among the herd through needle propagation of the virus;\n- outbreaks of RVF in animals precede human cases, thus the establishment of an active animal health surveillance system is essential in providing early warning for veterinary and public health authorities.\n\nWHO advises against the application of any travel or trade restrictions with the affected country based on the current information available on this event.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The report above provides a good overview of the development of the current Rift Valley fever outbreak. Surveillance and responses require a One Health approach since both humans and animals are affected and environmental change, in this situation extensive flooding, has promoted vector abundance. Effective vector control over extensive geographical areas is difficult to achieve and is expensive. Maintenance of herd immunity through vaccination of animals can be a successful preventive measure prior to the occurrence of cases. - Mod.TY\n\nNeighboring Egypt, which suffered introductions of RVF from Sudan in the past, has undertaken preventive measures. This relates initially to the 2 governorates bordering Sudan, namely the Red Sea and the New Valley governorates. In the Red Sea governorate, vaccination has already started. Reportedly, as of 18 Nov 2019, a total of 12 801 animals have been vaccinated, including 11 568 sheep and goats, 712 camels, and 421 cows and buffalo. The vaccination, which is free of charge, is being continued. In the New Valley governorate, 62 guidance seminars about RVF for animal breeders in the 5 provincial centers have been undertaken; the implementation of a 'magnified immunization campaign for a month' is said to commence 'next Saturday' (23 Nov 2019), 'aimed at immunizing 120 000 cattle, goats, and sheep.' Intensified surveillance in animals has, reportedly, been applied in both governorates; no suspected cases detected. - Mod.AS\n\nMaps of Sudan: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/States_of_Sudan and http://healthmap.org/promed/p/96]", "summary": "-------------\n- Activation of RVF task force committee;\n- printing and distribution of RVF guidelines;\n- deployment of surveillance teams for daily reporting and active case finding in the affected areas;\n- establishment of 2 health centers and one dispensary with a capacity of 11 beds, laboratory items, drugs, and supplies to provide health services in the affected villages;\n- conducting household inspections and fogging: In Arb'aat area, a total of 452 households were inspected, out of which 30 were found positive for the presence of a competent vector; in Port Sudan, out of 1225 households inspected, 29 were found positive for the competent vector, and fogging was provided to 1949 households;\n- the Veterinary Epidemiology Department of the Ministry of Animal Resources conducted vector control in 4 animal enclosures in the affected villages.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the 2nd confirmed case of RVF was reported from Ntoroko district, Uganda.\n\nThe individual was a 25-year-old male from the Democratic Republic of Congo who was living and working in Kimara Village, Butungama sub-county, in Ntoroko district, Uganda. The patient developed hemorrhagic symptoms on 5 Dec [2019] and despite treatment, the patient died the next day [6 Dec 2019]. A safe and dignified burial occurred later in the month [December 2019].\n\nThe 1st RVF case/death was reported from Obongi district (see Rift Valley fever - Eastern Africa (06): Uganda ex South Sudan 20191209.6829994).\n\nAccording to WHO, RVF is caused by a virus transmitted by mosquitoes and blood-feeding flies that usually affects animals (commonly cattle and sheep) but can also involve humans. In humans, the disease ranges from a mild flu-like illness to severe hemorrhagic fever that can be lethal. When livestock are infected, the disease can cause significant economic losses due to a high mortality rate in young animals and waves of abortions in pregnant females.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\nand\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Kunihiko Iizuka\n\n[The WHO report cited above leads one to conclude that although the man was from the DR Congo, he was living and working in Uganda and contracted the Rift Valley fever [RVF] there. There is no indication that RVF cases were occurring in livestock in Uganda at the time this case occurred, nor how the man became infected. There were RVF livestock cases in 2018. There were 3 reported RVF outbreaks located in 3 separate southwestern districts of Uganda (Mbarara, Isingiro, Lyantonde) (see Rift Valley fever - Eastern Africa (31): Uganda, bovine, OIE 20180907.6014484). At that time, there also were 2 confirmed human cases (see Rift Valley fever - Eastern Africa (13): Uganda, WHO 20180711.5898523). However, in 2019, no livestock cases were reported. The occurrence of human cases in the absence of reported animal cases prompted Mod.AS to comment: 'Unfortunately, during the recent South Sudan RVF event, as in most -- if not all -- previous RVF events in other African countries, humans served as sentinels. Improved surveillance in animals is desperately needed in Africa to allow timely measures applied, predominantly preventive vaccination, before the development of a full-blown epizootic involving secondary infection in humans.'\n\nIt is likely that RVF virus has persisted in this Uganda and other countries in East Africa in transovarially infected eggs of _Aedes_ mosquito vectors. These eggs can remain viable for long periods of time and hatch when flooded during future rain events, with the subsequent emergence of infected females ready to transmit the virus. This risk provides justification for keeping livestock of the area well vaccinated into the future. This may have accounted for the reappearance of RVF in South Sudan in 2018, after nearly 2 years without additional reported cases in humans or livestock, and again with this human case in 2019. - Mod.TY\n\nHealthMap/ProMED-mail map:\nNtoroko district, Uganda: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/24929]", "summary": "Communicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\nand\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Kunihiko Iizuka\n\n[The WHO report cited above leads one to conclude that although the man was from the DR Congo, he was living and working in Uganda and contracted the Rift Valley fever A ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n This may have accounted for the reappearance of RVF in South Sudan in 2018, after nearly 2 years without additional reported cases in humans or livestock, and again with this human case in 2019.

The precipitation forecasts predict above-average rains for the coming period (October-December 2019) for Chad, Central African Republic, southern the Sudan and the whole eastern Africa region. According to the FAO RVF Monitoring/Early Warning tool, there are large areas at risk of RVF vector amplification in central-southern Chad, western-central Kenya, central-southern Sudan, eastern-southern Sudan, northern Uganda, and northern Tanzania. In August 2019, the 1st confirmed case ever of RVF in humans was reported in Bangui, Central African Republic. In early October 2019, media reported suspected cases of RVF in humans and animals in Red Sea state (north-eastern Sudan) and cases of hemorrhagic fever in humans in Kassala (eastern Sudan) and North Darfur states (western Sudan). Considering the past and recent RVF outbreaks occurrence in the region, Chad, Kenya, Sudan, South Sudan, and the Central African Republic could be considered at high risk of RVF occurrence. The other countries of the region could be considered at moderate risk of RVF due to the predicted suitability for RVF vector amplification as well as the movement of potentially infected animals.'\n\nRapporteur [JD] comment:\nThe reports of severe and widespread flooding events in recent weeks are highly reminiscent of those that preceded the widespread outbreak of RVF in eastern Africa during May-August 2018 (see FEWS article, dated 8 Nov 2019, at https://fews.net/east-africa/seasonal-monitor/november-8-2019). Precipitation anomaly mapping from satellite imagery supports media reporting of exceptionally high levels of rainfall during early November and the preceding 90-day period of August-October in the same areas of eastern Africa most affected by a major outbreak of RVF in 2018.\n\nA comparison of 90 day rainfall anomalies from March-May 2018 and August-November 2019 indicates high risk for an even more extensive regional RVF outbreak in East Africa during the next few months, with very large high risk precipitation index areas covering most of Ethiopia, South Sudan, Sudan, Somalia, Uganda, and parts of Tanzania.\n\nDrought periods in southern Africa are often associated with unusually high levels of rainfall in East Africa -- and vice versa.\n\nBackground references\n---------------------\n1.

From the said East Africa Seasonal Monitor, we hereby copy the segment addressing Kenya:\n\n'In Kenya, flash floods were reported to have adversely affected about 25 counties, especially Marsabit, Wajir, Garissa, Turkana, and Kitui. The recent floods caused human and livestock fatalities and damage to infrastructure. Over 48 people lost their lives and 144 000 are estimated to have been displaced. However, the on-going short-rains performance has been largely beneficial for rangeland and cropping conditions across the most vulnerable pastoral and marginal agropastoral communities. There is an increased likelihood for the above-average crop yield prospects if the rainfall forecast for enhanced rains continue into December. On the other hand, there are concerns for pre-and post-harvest losses in the Western and North-Rift counties of Kenya due to on-going rains in the harvesting and drying period. There is also an elevated risk of further flooding at the peak of the rainfall season in November, which is associated with an increased incidence of malaria, water-borne diseases, and RVF.'\n\nThe mechanisms that maintain the RVF arbovirus in nature and cause it to emerge in epidemic form are incompletely understood and might differ between areas. Transmission cycles are best understood in savanna regions, where the virus is thought to survive between outbreaks in the dried eggs of _Aedes_ mosquitoes found in shallow depressions in the soil (dambos). Infected mosquitoes are thought to hatch when the dambos fill after heavy rainfall and initiate transmission cycles involving additional mosquito species, and animals that act as amplifying hosts. The vertebrate amplifying hosts are thought to be critical in propagating epidemics. In Kenya's Savanna grasslands, the rainfall of between 500-1250 mm (20-50 inches) is concentrated into March-May (long rains) and September-October (short rains) and there is a long dry season in between; there are multi-annual fluctuations as well. Additional and updated details in ref 1 below.\n\nRVFV introductions into Egypt in 1977 and the Arabian Peninsula in 2000 followed epizootics in Sudan in 1976 and the Horn of Africa in 1998, respectively; the mode(s) of inter-boundary transmission yet to be fully clarified; in Egypt, the main suggested vector was _Culex pipiens_. The potential for the globalization of arboviruses has been demonstrated by various disease agents (such as West Nile, chikungunya, Zika viruses).\n\nMany thanks to Joe for his valuable comment.\n\nReference\n---------\n1.

Precipitation anomaly mapping from satellite imagery supports media reporting of exceptionally high levels of rainfall during early November and the preceding 90-day period of August-October in the same areas of eastern Africa most affected by a major outbreak of RVF in 2018. The other countries of the region could be considered at moderate risk of RVF due to the predicted suitability for RVF vector amplification as well as the movement of potentially infected animals.'\n\nRapporteur [JD] comment:\n According to the FAO RVF Monitoring/Early Warning tool, there are large areas at risk of RVF vector amplification in central-southern Chad, western-central Kenya, central-southern Sudan, eastern-southern Sudan, northern Uganda, and northern Tanzania. In early October 2019, media reported suspected cases of RVF in humans and animals in Red Sea state (north-eastern Sudan) and cases of hemorrhagic fever in humans in Kassala (eastern Sudan) and North Darfur states (western Sudan).

The reports of severe and widespread flooding events in recent weeks are highly reminiscent of those that preceded the widespread outbreak of RVF in eastern Africa during May-August 2018 (see FEWS article, dated 8 Nov 2019, at https://fews.net/east-africa/seasonal-monitor/november-8-2019). The precipitation forecasts predict above-average rains for the coming period (October-December 2019) for Chad, Central African Republic, southern the Sudan and the whole eastern Africa region.

The 2nd report of RVF in animals is the above one, in River Nile.\n\nA suspected outbreak in sheep and goats in Gezira is currently under investigation; samples have been submitted to the national laboratory in Sura, Khartoum, results pending (see 20191104.6761594).\n\nAccording to UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), a total of 248 RVF cases, including 7 deaths, have been reported since the onset of the disease on 28 Sep 2019 up to 30 Oct 2019. Their locations (states) and numbers, reportedly, were the following:\nRiver Nile (n=145), Red Sea (n=98), Khartoum (n=1), White Nile (n=1), Gedaref (n=1), and Kassala (n=2). The majority of cases (145) are in River Nile. Of all cases reported, 94.8 % affected people over 5 years of age, 83% of which are male.

Infection can cause severe disease in both animals and humans. The disease also results in significant economic losses due to death and abortion among RVF-infected livestock.\n\nRVF virus was 1st identified in 1931 during an investigation into an epidemic among sheep on a farm in the Rift Valley of Kenya, and most cases occur in Sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nKey facts:\n- Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a viral zoonosis that primarily affects animals but can also infect humans.\n- The majority of human infections result from contact with the blood or organs of infected animals.\n- Human infections have also resulted from the bites of infected mosquitoes.\n- To date, no human-to-human transmission of RVF virus has been documented.\n- The incubation period (the interval from infection to onset of symptoms) for RVF varies from 2-6 days.\n- Outbreaks of RVF in animals can be prevented by a sustained programme of animal vaccination.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[On Wed 9 Oct 2019, villages in the area of Arbaat in El Ganeb locality in Red Sea state reported 9 new cases suspected to be Rift Valley fever, bringing the total number of reported cases to 65 (https://www.dabangasudan.org/en/all-news/article/nine-more-cases-of-rift-valley-fever-in-sudan-s-red-sea-state). In addition to the Red Sea state outbreak mentioned above, a separate report indicates that Rift Valley fever is occurring in Sudan's River Nile state (see Rift Valley fever - Sudan: (RS,NR) human, animal, alert, OIE Archive Number: 20191014.6726088). These 2 Sudan states mentioned above are adjoining, so it is not surprising that suspected or confirmed Rift Valley fever (RVF) outbreaks are occurring there simultaneously. The Ministry of Health is investigating the outbreaks in both states. Not only are these outbreaks a human health problem, they are clearly an animal health problem as well, with 420 cattle reported dying of the disease. A One Health response is urgently needed, with participation of physicians, veterinarians and entomologists. There was evidence of RVF virus in the neighboring Central African Republic this year (2019). Last year (2018), human and animal cases occurred in neighboring South Sudan (see Valley fever - South Sudan (09): (EL) human, animal, WHO 20180410.5735975).\n\nIf focal geographic areas of transmission are identified in this Sudan situation, increased surveillance of people and livestock should be initiated and livestock vaccination considered. RVF-infected livestock can pose a significant risk to humans in contact with them, often livestock owners and veterinarians. Abortions in livestock with a loss in productivity present an economic problem for many ethnic groups that depend on them for livelihoods.\n\nThe above report mentions abortion storms in a River Nile state outbreak that could have had serious economic, social and public health consequences. It is likely that RVF virus will persist in this area in transovarially infected eggs of _Aedes_ mosquito vectors. These eggs can remain viable for long periods and hatch when flooded during future rain events, with subsequent emergence of infected females ready to transmit the virus. This risk provides justification for maintaining livestock of the area well vaccinated into the future. - Mod.TY]\n\n[A media (radio) report on an event of human and animal disease, in Sudan's area of Arbaat, north of Port Sudan, Red Sea state, caused by an 'unknown fever' killing 3 people and 420 cows, was posted by ProMED-mail on 6 Oct 2019 as 'undiagnosed,' RFI ( 20191006.6712623). The commentary suggested RVF as possible etiology, requesting further information.

The case-patient is a 45-year-old male farmer from Bogoin village who initially fell ill on 5 Aug 2019 and presented, on 8 Aug 2019, to the local health facility with fever, chills, headache, nausea, asthenia, myalgia, arthralgia and retro-ocular pain. As part of influenza surveillance, a blood specimen was collected on 9 Aug 2019 and transported to the IPB. Test results released on 19 Aug 2019 confirmed RVF infection by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. As of 24 Aug 2019, the case-patient remained in admission in good clinical condition.\n\nOutbreak investigations carried out by the rapid response team identified 7 additional suspected RVF cases from the same health district, 5 through records review in the local health facility and 2 by active case search in the affected community. A total of 12 blood specimens (5 from suspected cases and 7 from healthy control cases) were collected and are being analysed at the IPB; the test results are pending. The suspected cases, with ages ranging from 5 to 45 years, are being followed as outpatients.\n\nAdditionally, animal health investigations carried out in the affected community reportedly identified sick domestic animals (mainly cows and sheep), manifesting symptoms such as runny nose, cough and diarrhoea. A total of 21 blood specimens were collected from the sick animals (cows and small ruminants) and taken for laboratory analysis and the test results are pending.\n\nFurther epidemiological and entomological investigations are ongoing, and updates will be provided as new information becomes available.\n\nPublic health actions\n\nThe Ministry of Health is coordinating the response to the RVF outbreak through the emergency operations centre, with support from the health partners.\n\nA multisectoral national rapid response team, comprising of both public and animal health specialists, and entomologists was deployed from 21-24 Aug 2019 to conduct in-depth outbreak investigation.\n\nThe epidemiological and laboratory surveillance have been enhanced, and healthcare workers have been oriented on the standard case definition for RVF to facilitate early case detection. Data collection and reporting tools have been distributed to the health facilities.\n\nCase management is ongoing in the affected health district, with some suspected cases being managed as outpatients.\n\nRisk communication activities using various channels are ongoing in the affected communities, however this needs to be enhanced.\n\nSituation interpretation\n\nHealth authorities in Central African Republic have reported a new outbreak of RVF, the 1st time such an event has been formally reported in the country. Information on the circulation of RVF virus (RVFV) in Central African Republic is limited, partly due to gaps in the surveillance system, and specifically due to limited surveillance for RVF disease. Literature indicates that RVFV was 1st isolated in Central African Republic in 1969 from a pool of _Mansonia africana_ mosquitoes. However, a recent study in Central African Republic detected RVFV-specific antibodies in humans, and 15 strains [isolates] of RVFV were isolated from humans and sylvatic mosquitoes.\n\nThe current confirmation of RVF in the country should alert health authorities to strengthen surveillance for the disease and other zoonoses. Additionally, in-depth epidemiological and entomological investigations should be undertaken to properly understand the epidemiology of the disease and identify all potential vectors species in the country. The ongoing rainy season, running from May to October 2019, may result in increased [mosquito] vector density, constituting another risk factor for escalation of RVF.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Kunihiko Iizuka\n\n[It is interesting that this year (2019) it was a human case that signaled the presence of Rift Valley fever virus RVFV) in the country. The results of the subsequent field studies by the multidisciplinary rapid response team found additional human cases and evidence that the virus is being transmitted to livestock.\n\nFinding evidence of RVF virus in the Central African Republic (CAR) is not surprising. Last year (2018), human and animal cases occurred in neighboring South Sudan (see Valley fever - South Sudan (09): (EL) human, animal, WHO 20180410.5735975). If focal geographic areas of transmission are identified in this CAR situation, increased surveillance of people and livestock should be initiated and livestock vaccination considered. RVF-infected livestock can pose a significant risk to humans in contact with them, often livestock owners and veterinarians. Abortions in livestock with a loss in productivity present an economic problem for many ethnic groups that depend on them for livelihoods. Apparently, this RVF outbreak did not result in an abortion storm that could have had serious economic, social and public health consequences. It is likely that RVF virus will persist in this area in transovarially infected eggs of _Aedes_ mosquito vectors. These eggs can remain viable for long periods of time and hatch when flooded during future rain events, with subsequent emergence of infected females ready to transmit the virus. This risk provides justification for maintaining livestock of the area well vaccinated into the future. - Mod.TY\n\nHealthMap/ProMED map available at:\nCentral African Republic: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/66]", "summary": "\n\nOutbreak investigations carried out by the rapid response team identified 7 additional suspected RVF cases from the same health district, 5 through records review in the local health facility and 2 by active case search in the affected community. \n\nPublic health actions\n\nThe Ministry of Health is coordinating the response to the RVF outbreak through the emergency operations centre, with support from the health partners.

The given date of start of the outbreak is 25 Sep 2019. The report includes the following epidemiological comments:\n'There were few abortions in goat herds observed after heavy flooding in September 2019. There are no cattle or sheep populations in the area.\nIt is a dry area within the series of the Red Sea Hills. Surveillance, biosecurity measures, and increased awareness is ongoing.'\n\nOfficial confirmation of the outbreaks in the Red Sea State is anticipated.\n\nThe 1st outbreak of RVF in Sudan was reported in 1973 among sheep and cattle in the White Nile State. In 1977, camels from Sudan were one of the suggested sources of RVF virus introduced, for the 1st time, into Egypt. Throughout the years, this virus was reported several times from humans and animals in Sudan.

Dengue fever, RVF, and chikungunya are vector-borne diseases, while cholera is waterborne. The increase of these outbreaks can be linked to the recent floods in the country that have left large pools of stagnant water, which are breeding sites for various types of vectors such as mosquitoes and houseflies. Government authorities and humanitarian partners are actively responding to these outbreaks across the country, providing health assistance, vaccinations where appropriate, and vector control interventions.\n\nRift Valley fever\n---------------\nThere are 193 Rift Valley fever (RVF) cases -- including 4 deaths -- reported in Red Sea, River Nile, and Khartoum states since the onset of the disease on 28 Sept until 22 Oct 2019. The majority of cases (100) are in Red Sea. Of all cases reported, 94.8% have affected people over 5 years of age, and 83% are male.\n\nRift Valley fever response\n--------------------------\nSimilar to the dengue response, SMoH activated response taskforce meetings and developed state-level preparedness and response plans. There has been a joint investigation by the SMoH, WHO, and the Ministry of Animal Resources (MoAR) in locations where the outbreak has occurred. Case definition and management training has been provided to 131 medical staff, and an isolation center has been established in Tagadom hospital in Red Sea state. In addition, 2200 mosquito nets have been distributed, 1330 homes have been inspected for breeding sites, and 3542 homes have been fogged in the state. Health promotion activities have been carried out at the household and community levels.\n\nThe major gaps and challenges faced are the limited number of partners involved in response activities, the need for better coordination between humanitarian partners and MoAR [Ministry of Agriculture], and the need to scale up activities in affected states. In addition, a more comprehensive plan needs to be developed between the government authorities and partners; more training in surveillance and case management is required; and social mobilization and vector control activities need to be intensified.\n\nRVF is a viral disease that is spread either through the bite of an infected mosquito or by touching infected animal blood, breathing in the air around an infected animal being butchered, or drinking raw milk from an infected animal. The disease is spread between cows, sheep, goats, and camels by mosquitoes. Infection does not appear to be transmitted from person to person.\n\nVaccinating animals against the disease before the outbreak occurs can prevent it from being transmitted to humans. Other methods include eradicating mosquito breeding sites and avoiding their bites. If an outbreak occurs, limiting the movement of animals will reduce the spread of the disease. As a result, the declaration of RVF can have an impact on international and domestic livestock economies. Saudi Arabia has announced a ban on importing livestock from Sudan in response to the announcement of World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) concerning documented cases of RVF.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The acute need for a 'One Health' approach, encompassing all of Sudan's partners, is clearly indicated in the above report. - Mod.AS]\n\n******\n[2] Egypt bans Sudanese cattle imports after RVF outbreak\nDate: Thu 24 Oct 2019\nSource: Enterprise Press (Cairo) [edited]\nhttps://enterprise.press/stories/2019/10/24/egyptian-authorities-ban-sudanese-cattle-imports-after-rift-valley-outbreak/\n\n\nEgypt has banned the import of cattle from Sudan after an outbreak of Rift Valley fever in eastern Sudan announced by the World Organization for Animal Health, the local press reports.\n\nRift Valley fever is a virus that affects both animals and humans that can cause significant economic harm if allowed to spread. Sudan's health minister said this week that authorities have detected 135 cases in areas near the Red Sea and north Darfur.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[A recent (2018) study addressed the risk of RVF introduction into and transmission within Egypt by camel imports from Sudan (Ref. 1). The results indicated that the main risk of RVFV introduction is posed by the continuous flow of a large number of camels coming from Sudan. Their numbers were steadily increasing. During 2015 (last analysed year), it was about 18 000 per month. No seasonal pattern was observed in the amount of camels imported (in difference with cattle, which make a significantly smaller import slice, mainly concentrated in the Eid-el-Adha festivities season). Most of the camels arrived from western Sudan (where the current event is located) to Abu Simbel quarantine in south-central Egypt. The risk of RVFV transmission by vectors (in Egypt being mainly _Culex pipiens_) is restricted to the areas surrounding the Nile River, and does not vary significantly throughout the year. Imported camels are taken to quarantines, where the risk of RVFV transmission by vectors is generally low. Then they are taken to animal markets or slaughterhouses, many located in populated areas, where the risk of RVFV transmission to animals or humans is much higher. The measures currently implemented (quarantines, vaccination, or testing) seem, according to the study, to have a limited effect in reducing the risk of RVFV introduction; the authors propose other (risk-based) surveillance strategies. - Mod.AS\n\nRef. 1: Napp S, Chevalier V, Busquets N, Calistri P, Casal J, Attia M, et al.: Understanding the legal trade of cattle and camels and the derived risk of Rift Valley fever introduction into and transmission within Egypt.

'Quarantines in border governorates also operate 24 hours a day, and animals from them are checked.'\n\nSaudi Arabia has also announced a moratorium on livestock imports from Sudan, fearing that the RVF could spill into the kingdom.\n\nThe Ministry of Environment, Water and Agriculture announced the suspension of the Kingdom's imports of live cattle from the Republic of Sudan, following the announcement of the World Organization for Animal Health [OIE] [about] the emergence of cases of RVF in Sudan, in addition to the suspension of imports of live cattle from Djibouti Kingdom, which has been denied access to the Kingdom. [The main Saudi imports from Sudan involve sheep, not cattle; is there a translational error here? Is sheep import being continued? - Mod.AS]\n\nIn addition, the ministry explained that it has started coordination directly to assess the current situation inside the Kingdom with the Ministry of Health and the National Center for Disease Prevention and Control and with neighboring countries and continued coordination with the OIE.\n\nFor its part, Sudan, in remarks quoted by the Sudanese newspaper 'Sayha,' [claims that] all cattle returned by Saudi Arabia [are free] of Rift Valley fever. The Port Sudan Port Administration said that it has conducted comprehensive tests for all cattle that Saudi Arabia recently returned and confirmed that they are all free of diseases, and there were no cases.\n\nThe director of the port 'Heydob,' Mohamed Hassan Mokhtar, said, 'Veterinary quarantines have done their part in the examination and review of livestock, and there was no case of animal disease. I declare that the veterinary quarantine is in the process of submitting the reports of doctors to the competent authorities.'\n\nMokhtar attributed the causes of livestock deaths to hunger and lack of water for long periods of detention during the period of return to Sudan and called for lifting of the ban on the export of cattle for lack of reasons for non-export.\n\nSource link: Sputnik News, in Arabic, at https://tinyurl.com/y3p38agk.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Since early September 2019, there have been conflicting media reports from Sudan about the spatial dissemination of RVF, the date of the event's start, and the spectrum of the animal species involved. Earlier reports said that since early September 2019, undiagnosed fever disease cases in humans and cattle were reported from the states Red Sea and River Nile. According to the media, suspected cases in humans have been reported from additional states, namely the above-mentioned Khartoum as well as North Darfur and Kassala ( 20191006.6712623). No official confirmation of RVF, suspected in these locations, has become available.\n\nIn their immediate notification on RVF to the OIE, dated 13 Sep 2019, the Sudanese veterinary authorities claimed that 'there were few abortions in goat herds observed after heavy flooding in September 2019,' 'there is no cattle or sheep population in the area,' and the outbreak occurred 'in a dry area within the series of the Red Sea Hills.' No follow-up report has been submitted since, nor official information on the animal disease situation in other locations/states from where human haemorrhagic disease has been reported.\n\nOfficial information on RVF in Sudan is available on the website of WHO's Eastern Mediterranean Region, to which Sudan belongs (similarly to some other African countries such as Lybia, Egypt, and Somali). The table 'Current outbreaks in the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region' (at http://www.emro.who.int/pandemic-epidemic-diseases/outbreaks/index.html) includes the following updated information on notifiable diseases in Sudan, of which 3 are vectorborne:\n\nCountry / Diseases / Cases / Deaths / CFR (%) / Date of event\nSudan / cholera / 309 / 8 / 2.6% / August 2019\nSudan / chikungunya / 10 / 0 / - / September 2019\nSudan / dengue / 135 / 1 / 0.7% / August 2019\nSudan / Rift Valley fever / 76 / 2 / 2.6% / September 2019\n\nSudan is a major exporter of live animals, mainly sheep and goats. In 2017, this export's value was more than USD 476 million; most of the export is destined for Saudi Arabia and the Gulf States. There is also export of camels, most of them going on hoof to Egypt. In the past, both Saudia and Egypt have experienced outbreaks of RVF. While in Saudia, east African countries, in particular around the Horn of Africa, were the suspected origin of infection; in Egypt, the suspicion involved mainly camels from Sudan. Enhanced transparency and adequate pre-export measures, in line with OIE's requirements, may be helpful in minimizing the losses. - Mod.AS]\n\n[The total number reported number of human cases since the outbreak began has been difficult to tally, since the cases have been widely scattered over 3 states. The above report does provide a total of 193 cases with 4 deaths. The ban of export of Sudanese livestock into Egypt will cause economic and social hardship for livestock owners in Sudan. In the absence of banks or similar institutions of financial support, livestock represent a kind of living bank account for their owners. Inability to export represents a loss of cash flow. It is likely that RVF virus will persist in this area in transovarially infected eggs of _Aedes_ mosquito vectors. These eggs can remain viable for long periods of time and hatch when flooded during future rain events, with subsequent emergence of infected females ready to transmit the virus. This risk provides justification for keeping livestock in the area well vaccinated into the future. - Mod.TY\n\nHealthMap/ProMED-mail map:\nSudan: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/96]", "summary": "A ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n \n\nRVF is a viral disease that is spread either through the bite of an infected mosquito or by touching infected animal blood, breathing in the air around an infected animal being butchered, or drinking raw milk from an infected animal.

However, in the run-up to Eid el Fitr and the big wedding season, the health authorities remind the population to be vigilant in case of slaughter of animals, consumption of meat, and consumption of curdled milk. It is strongly recommended to follow the recommendations to protect yourself from the disease.\n\nRecommendations:\nIt is recommended to protect yourself when cutting zebu [cattle] carcasses.\n\nIn ruminants: Monitoring of Rift Valley fever includes monitoring of abortions. Thus, farmers are required to report promptly to veterinarians any abortions or stillbirths occurring in their animals or sick animals in order to take samples in search of the disease.\n\nAn order prohibiting the marketing of untreated milk has been in force since 27 Feb 2019. A decree prohibiting the export of live animals, raw meat, and milk produced by the ruminant farms of the country has been in force since 20 Mar 2019.\n\nIn humans: The disease is usually manifested by an influenza-like illness: high fever (39 C [102 F]), muscle and/or joint pain, severe headache, and tiredness. In the vast majority of cases, recovery occurs within a few days. It is recommended to consult a doctor as soon as the signs appear so that samples can be taken to see whether they are positive for the disease.\n\nRecommendations to protect yourself from the disease:\n\nFor farmers and people in contact with animals:\n- wash hands with soap after contact with domestic ruminants (cattle, sheep, goats);\n- do not handle sick or aborted animals without protection, or abortion products;\n- do not handle animal carcasses without protection;\n- wear gloves, goggles, and especially a mask for the slaughter of any animal. Indeed, infected animals may not present any signs, whereas they can transmit the virus.\n\nFor food:\n- boil the milk;\n- do not consume curd unless it has been boiled and then curdled with ferment of lactic acid;\n- wash hands after cutting meat;\n- cook the meat well;\n- never eat the meat of a sick animal.\n\nTo protect yourself from mosquito bites:\n- eliminate breeding sites; empty all containers that may contain water;\n- use mosquito nets and repellents.\n\nIn case of appearance of symptoms:\n- consult your doctor immediately.\n\n[byline: Anne Perzo]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Since the 12 May 2019 report, the number of animal cases has increased from 119 to 121 cases, and human cases currently number 134.

As Mod.AS noted in an earlier post, a French delegation included the following comment in its presentation of 21 Mar 2019: 'What about vaccination? To date, no vaccine has been authorized in the EU.' Such authorization deserves early consideration. It would be of interest to know what role, if any, mosquito vectors are playing in transmission of RVF virus during the current outbreak. If aedes mosquitoes are involved, there is a risk of transovarial transmission of the virus that can persist for months in mosquito eggs with resumption of transmission when those eggs hatch and infected adult female mosquitoes emerge. - Mod.TY\n\nHealthMap/ProMED map available at:\nR\u00e9gion d'outre-mer de Mayotte, France: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/576]", "summary": "\n\nRecommendations to protect yourself from the disease:\n\nFor farmers and people in contact with animals:\n- wash hands with soap after contact with domestic ruminants (cattle, sheep, goats);\n- do not handle sick or aborted animals without protection, or abortion products;\n- do not handle animal carcasses without protection;\n- wear gloves, goggles, and especially a mask for the slaughter of any animal. \n\n[byline: Anne Perzo]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Since the 12 May 2019 report, the number of animal cases has increased from 119 to 121 cases, and human cases currently number 134.

It was 1st reported in the southernmost province of Aswan and caused significant losses in livestock. At the time, it was equivalent to 82 million pounds, and there were cases of human deaths and injuries, where the injuries amounted to 18 000 cases, while the number of deaths was about 518. The disease is transmitted between humans and animals through mosquitoes and insects, and symptoms of the disease appear in the animal in 2 forms, namely abortions and, in the most severe form, the death of young animals.\n\nDr. Youssef Mamdouh, (formerly) head of the Central Reservation Department in the Veterinary Services, told Sputnik that when RVF emerges in any of the countries from which live livestock are imported, the animals should be quarantined, sampled, subsequently vaccinated, and kept for 3 weeks before being sent to their destination. He told Sputnik that in 2009 Egypt stopped importing livestock from Sudan because of the emergence of the disease. All quarantine procedures are to be applied in the territory of the exporting country, not in the importing country. It affects all types of livestock, including camels.\n\nThe Egyptian Ministry of Agriculture and Land Reclamation announced that all precautionary measures were taken after the media circulated on the suspicion of cases of Rift Valley cattle disease in the northeastern areas of Sudan, which caused the death and stress of some cattle.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Further information on the 1977 RVF event in Egypt:\nMeegan JM.

'We've banned export of livestock until newly emerged cases of Rift Valley fever are handled,' the minister said in statements.\n\nThe ministry's undersecretary, according to SUNA [Sudan News Agency], pointed to some Rift Valley cases in Red Sea and River Nile states estimated at 10-15 heads of goats, confirming that all these cases have been dealt with in collaboration with World Health Organization-Animal.\n\n[Byline: Khalid Mohamed]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Sudan is a major exporter of live animals, mainly sheep and goats (Ref 1). In 2017, this export's value was more than USD 476 million; most of the export is destined for Saudi Arabia and the Gulf States. There is also export of camels, most of them going on the hoof to Egypt and Libya.\n\nThe transparency exercised during the current event by Sudan's Ministry of Health and the decision of the Agriculture Ministry to temporarily discontinue animal exports has, not surprisingly, met opposition, mainly by the economically involved parties (https://www.assayha.net/now/archives/18575/18575, in Arabic). The export-ban decision may, in the long run, positively contribute to the maintenance of uninterrupted exports, provided measures, in particular control upon intranational animal movements, and preventive mass vaccinations in hitherto not-infected regions, are undertaken at the earliest while consignments are certified in line with OIE's prescribed requirements.\n\nFAO has advised veterinary services and livestock farmers' communities in Sudan, South Sudan, Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Burundi, Rwanda, Somalia, Uganda, and United Republic of Tanzania to remain vigilant to the potential occurrence and spread of RVF in humans and/or animals. Egypt, Libya, Chad, Democratic Republic of Congo, Central African Republic, as well as Saudi Arabia and Yemen are also considered at risk of occurrence. The Egyptian 1977 disastrous RVF event should be kept in mind; it demonstrated how RVF-virgin regions may get infected when the virus is introduced, most probably by viraemic animals, into ecologically 'receptive' regions when suitable environmental conditions for the RVF vector amplification prevail.\n\nReference\nWilson RT.

The first 5 cases were detected in November 2018 by the hospital laboratory and confirmed by the Reunion Reference Center. The vector control center and the health emergency unit of the ARS OI [The Indian Ocean Health Agency] were able to analyze the epidemiology of 36 cases: 21 subjects had been in direct contact with animals and 5 others lived nearby; the last 5 declared no direct or indirect contact with animals. In addition, in 15 cases, patients had consumed raw or curdled milk. Finally, it is interesting to note that 21 patients resided in the communes of west-central Mayotte. With regard to the 63 confirmed cases, the average age of the patients was 38 years (range, 10 to 74 years), of which 16% were under 20 years, with a male/female sex ratio of 4. In addition, 29 patients lived in rural or semi-urban dwellings, 9 of whom lived in traditional huts. In terms of symptoms, 24 patients had headache, 19 arthralgia, 17 myalgia, 14 asthenia, 6 retro-orbital pain, and 6 nausea and vomiting. An entomological survey found several mosquito species, especially _Culex_, _Aedes_, _Anopheles_ and _Mansonia_.\n\nAt the same time, samples taken from farms in which abortions were reported identified 33 outbreaks of 1 to 6 animals, including 25 cattle and 8 small ruminants [the figures have increased since; see in comments].\n\nRift Valley fever, which has been present in Mayotte for a long time, had disappeared in the past decade, with 10 patients detected in 2008 following an epidemic in Kenya. Then there was a steady regression of verified seroprevalence on ruminants. But this seroprevalence rose to 3.6% in 2017 and then to 10.1% in 2018, indicating a new circulation of the virus. This is probably due to illegal and continuous importation of contaminated livestock.\n\n[By: Dr. Patrice Bouree]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Mayotte's health authorities published on Sat 11 May 2019 the following update.\n\n'Epidemiological situation as of May 10, 2019.\nIn total, since the beginning of the epidemic (end of November 2018):\n1.

The causative agent is a _Phlebovirus_ (Bunyaviridae), and the vector are mosquitos of different genera, especially _Aedes_. Infection in humans causes influenza-like illness complicated by hemorrhagic fever, encephalitis, ocular damage, and, in some cases, death. Wild ruminants, especially African buffalos, and some domestic ruminants may be involved in the maintenance of RVF virus. Natural and experimental infections by RVF virus have been documented in several mammalian orders, including Artiodactyla, Chiroptera, Rodentia, Primata (nonhuman), Perissodactyla, Carnivora, and others. Mosquitos are considered to be the maintenance hosts, and wild ruminants and other mammals may serve as amplifying hosts. - Mod.PMB\n\nHealthMap/ProMED-mail maps:\nChad: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/57\nBatha, Chad: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/65106]", "summary": "A ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n Reason for notification: 1st occurrence of a listed disease\nManifestation of disease: clinical disease\nCausal agent: Rift Valley fever virus\n Epidemiological unit: natural park\nTotal animals affected\nSpecies / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered\n Scimitar oryx: _Oryx dammah_ (Bovidae) / 12 / 9 / 8 / 0 / 0\n\nOutbreak statistics [rates apparent, expressed as percentages]\nSpecies / Morbidity rate / Mortality rate / Case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*\n Total outbreaks: 1\nOutbreak location: Wadi rime, Wadi rime, Wadi rime, Batha\n Summary\nReport type: immediate notification (final report)\n Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n< Measures applied: Surveillance outside containment and/or protection zone, quarantine, control of wildlife reservoirs, control of vectors, ante- and post-mortem inspections, vaccination permitted (if a vaccine exists), no treatment of affected animals\n Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: Introduction of new live animals, legal movement of animals\n\nControl measures\n \nInformation received [and dated] 20 May 2019 from Dr. Nodjimadji Rirabe, Director of Veterinary Services, Veterinary Services, Ministry of Livestock and Animal Production, N'djamena, Chad\n\n Measures to be applied: No other measures\n\nDiagnostic test results\nLaboratory name and type: French Agricultural Research Centre for International Development (CIRAD) Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction, and/or slaughter\n\nEpidemiology\n [The location of the outbreak can be seen on the interactive map at the source URL above.]\n\n--\n Date event resolved: 20 May 2019\n", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "rift valley fever"], "syndromes": ["influenza-like illness", "encephalitis"], "event_date": ["2018-09-03 00:00:00", "2019-01-30 00:00:00", "2019-05-20 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "WAHID", "country": "Oman"}, {"location": "Wadi", "country": "Jordan"}, {"location": "Carnivora", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "France", "country": "France"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "6433086", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Rift Valley fever - Mayotte (08): increase in cases, human, cattle", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=6433086", "date": "2019-04-20 21:51:14", "main_text": "RIFT VALLEY FEVER - MAYOTTE (08): INCREASE IN CASES, HUMAN, CATTLE\n******************************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Sat 20 Apr 2019\nSource: Le Journal de Mayotte [in French trans.

After a lull, the number of cases is increasing again. Preventive measures should be carefully followed.\n\nDuring the past week, 12 new animal foci and 5 new human cases have been reported, for a total of 104 animal foci and 122 human cases since the 1st cases occurred at the end of November 2018. In this epidemic context, the prefecture of Mayotte, in collaboration with the ARS [Regional Health Agency] Indian Ocean [OI] and the Directorate of Food, Agriculture and Forestry of Mayotte (DAAF) issues a reminder of the importance of prevention measures to protect against the disease.\n\nEpidemiological situation as of 18 Apr 2019\n-------------------------------------------\nIn total, since the beginning of the epidemic (end of November [2018]): Samples taken by veterinarians from sick animals or during abortions have identified 104 foci of sick animals (including 82 bovines). Animal foci are mainly located in the center and north-west of the island. Additional outbreaks have appeared since the end of March [2019] in the communes of Dembeni, as well as on Petite Terre.\n\nThe CHM [Mayotte Hospital Center] laboratory reported 122 human cases of RVF from monitoring and health emergencies platform of the ARS OI (CVAGS/[Alert and Health Management Unit]) of Mayotte.\n\nAfter a steady decline in cases during the last 3 weeks of March [2019], a new increase has been observed since early April. Since the beginning of the health alert, human cases have remained mainly in the center and north-west of the island.\n\nRecommendations\n---------------\nIn ruminants:\nMonitoring of Rift Valley fever includes monitoring of abortions. Thus, farmers are required to report promptly to veterinarians any abortions or stillbirths occurring in their animals or sick animals in order to take samples in search of the disease.\n\nAn order prohibiting the marketing of untreated milk has been in force since 27 Feb 2019. A decree prohibiting the export of live animals, raw meat and milk produced by the ruminant farms of the country has been in force since 20 Mar 2019.\n\nIn humans:\nThe disease is usually manifested by an influenza-like illness: high fever (39 C [102 F]), muscle and/or joint pain, severe headache, tiredness. In the vast majority of cases, healing occurs within a few days. It is recommended to consult a doctor as soon as the signs appear so that the samples to diagnose the disease are taken.\n\nRecommendations to protect against disease\n------------------------------------------\nFor farmers and people in contact with animals:\n- wash hands with soap after contact with domestic ruminants (cattle, sheep, goats);\n- do not handle sick or aborted animals or abortion products without protection;\n- do not handle animal carcasses without protection;\n- must wear gloves, goggles, and especially a mask for the slaughter of any animal. Indeed, infected animals may not present any signs, whereas they can transmit the virus.\n\nFor food:\n- boil the milk;\n- do not consume curd unless it has been boiled and then curdled with fermentation of lactic acid;\n- wash hands after cutting meat;\n- cook the meat well;\n- never eat the meat of a sick animal.\n\nTo protect yourself from mosquito bites:\n- eliminate breeding sites, empty all containers that may contain water;\n- use mosquito nets and repellents.\n\nIn case of appearance of symptoms:\n- consult your doctor immediately.\n\n[Byline: Anne Perzo]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[After a lull in transmission, cases of Rift Valley fever in humans and livestock continue to increase slowly on Mayotte Island.\n\nProMED-mail posted a summary of the EU-Health and Food Safety DG-Standing Committee on Plants, Animals, Food and Feed (SCPAFF) 21 Mar 2019 committee meeting (see Rift Valley fever - Mayotte (06): animal, human, control, epidemiology 20190328.6391591) that lists the same precautions as above. In this post, Mod.AS commented that 'the introduction of RVF could have occurred either by traded animals or windborne infected vectors. The tropical ecological/climatic situation in Mayotte is not similar to the East African situation (and consequent RVF epidemiology), characterised by periodic exacerbations of latent endemic foci of infection or dormant mosquito larvae.'\n\nAs noted earlier, it would be of interest to know whether _Aedes_ vector mosquitoes are transmitting RVF virus on Mayotte and whether they are transovarially transmitting the virus to their eggs, as is the case in West Africa. These eggs can persist for long periods of time until flooded, when they hatch and develop into infected adults that can transmit the virus. This is not likely to occur if other genera of vector mosquitoes are transmitting the virus on Mayotte, in which case the outbreak can be expected to eventually die out. - Mod.TY\n\nHealthMap/ProMED map available at:\nRegion d'outre-mer de Mayotte, France: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/576]", "summary": "For food:\n- boil the milk;\n- do not consume curd unless it has been boiled and then curdled with fermentation of lactic acid;\n- wash hands after cutting meat;\n- cook the meat well;\n- never eat the meat of a sick animal.

After a steady decline in cases during the last 3 weeks of March 2019, a new increase has been observed since early April. During the past week, 12 new foci of sick animals and 5 new human cases have been reported, for a total of 104 animal foci (including 82 bovines) and 122 human cases since the start of the event ( 20190420.6433086).\n\nRVF had been circulating in Mayotte at least since early 2007, probably introduced there by the illegal importation of live infected ruminants from other Comoros islands (ref 2).\n\nThe economic activity of Mayotte (population, about 270 000), is based primarily on the agricultural sector, mainly fishing and livestock raising. Mayotte's livestock sector includes 4000 farms keeping 20 000 cattle and 15 000 small ruminants (2019 statistics, ref 1). The RVF losses to the livestock industry, caused by death, abortions, decreased production, veterinary treatment costs/medicines, movement restrictions, etc., are yet to be calculated.\n\nThe zoonotic impact of RVF is similarly deleterious. Infected humans suffer a serious sickness and complications. During the current event, their number is nearing 50 per 100 000 in Mayotte's general population, mainly in the rural section.\n\nGiven that domestic ruminants are involved in the epidemiological cycle and that humans mostly become infected after contact with viremic animals, the vaccination of ruminants, on top of protecting them, is the method of choice to prevent human disease.\n\nBoth live and inactivated vaccines are available for livestock. Live attenuated ('Smithburn') and inactivated vaccines are produced and commercially available in Egypt, South Africa, and Kenya. According to ref 2, 'There is no Community pharmaceutical legislation prohibiting companies from producing RVF vaccines on EU territory and there is no obligation to notify such production to the European Commission.' On the other hand, the French delegation, likely to be well aware of the need for animal vaccination in Mayotte, included the following comment in its presentation of 21 Mar 2019 (ref 1): 'What about vaccination? - To date, no vaccine has been authorized in the EU.'\n\nAccording to ECDC's risk assessment, published 6 Mar 2019 (ref 3), the current outbreak in Mayotte poses a very low risk for EU/EEA countries. The interests of Mayotte's economy and farming industry, and of those in contact with the animals, may have been rendered less consideration.\n\nAccording to the recent posting, Mayotte's farmers are being advised to 'monitor and report promptly to veterinarians any abortions or stillbirths occurring in their animals or sick animals in order to take samples in search of the disease'. No other measures are given for the protection of livestock.\n\nMonitoring will not prevent additional cases of RVF in cattle, sheep, and goats and, most probably, humans. In the absence of vaccination, monitoring farmers (and, indeed, the public), veterinarians and others in the rural areas of Mayotte, might due to be exposed, time and again, to a serious health hazard.\n\nReferences\n----------\n1.

The number of human cases of RVF has increased from 82 to 101 in about 2 weeks. However, it is good to learn that the number of new human cases is decreasing. The above report implies that the human infections are the result of contact with infected animals or their products, with fewer from virus transmission by mosquito vectors. The cattle cases certainly are the result of mosquito transmission.\n\nBecause RVF virus can be transovarially transmitted in populations of aedes mosquito vectors, and those resulting eggs can persist for a long period of time in nature, cases can occur periodically when the virus-containing eggs hatch, and infected adult females emerge from them. There is a risk that RVF will reappear on the island after the current outbreak has ended.\n\nRecent studies have shown that RVF virus may severely injure human fetuses if contracted by mothers during pregnancy. There is no indication of whether any of the 101 RVF virus-infected people were pregnant. Abortions in infected livestock are common. There is no vaccine available for human use, but there is for livestock. There is no mention of whether the livestock populations in the area have been vaccinated.\n\nThe clinical findings related to the above human cases are not mentioned.

This could have occurred either by traded animals or windborne infected vectors. The tropical ecological/climatic situation in Mayotte is not similar to the East African situation (and consequent RVF epidemiology), characterised by periodic exacerbations of latent endemic foci of infection or dormant mosquito larvae.\n\nAs apparent from the maps included in the presentation (RVF in animals and in man), the disease spread throughout the island. A recent paper addressing the RVF situation in Mayotte presented the following conclusion: 'Communes in the central region of Mayotte would play a major role in the spread of livestock diseases. A widespread epidemic is likely due to their high connectivity between themselves and to communes in the outer region. Surveillance efforts, therefore, need to be focused on central communes to achieve the timely detection of disease occurrence and minimise its consequences.' (See Kim Y, Dommergues L, Ben M'sa A, Merot Ph, Cardinale E et al.: Livestock trade network: potential for disease transmission and implications for risk-based surveillance on the island of Mayotte. (Nature) Scientific Reports. 2018; 8:11550. doi: 10.1038/s41598-018-29999-y.)\n\nPreventive vaccination could have significantly decreased the RVF epizootic, and consequently human infection; unfortunately, this seems to be, due to EU current legislation, excluded.\n\nAccording to a recent report by Le Journal de Mayotte (https://lejournaldemayotte.yt/2019/03/22/progression-de-la-fievre-de-la-vallee-du-rift-interdiction-dexporter-viande-ou-lait-cru/), since the beginning of the epidemic (end of November 2018) and as of 22 Mar 2019, 75 outbreaks of disease in animals (including 59 cattle) have been established by samples taken by veterinarians from sick animals or during abortions. The animal foci are mainly located in the center and northwest of the island, but the 1st animal foci appeared in the commune of Mamoudzou (4 bovines and one small-ruminant focus).\n\nIn humans, a total of 107 cases have been reported to the monitoring and health emergencies platform of the ARS OI (CVAGS) of Mayotte by the CHM laboratory. Of those who could be interviewed, almost 80% reported contact with animals.

(See table 16 'Conjectured circulating FMD viral lineages in each country of Pool 3 - North Africa' at https://tinyurl.com/y3ebeeh8). FMD has a very serious economic impact; it is not a zoonotic disease.\n\nRVFV causes a significant threat to both human and animal health. Human epidemics are generally preceded by epizootics in livestock, which serve as an amplification step in the spread of the virus. The disease is vector-borne in animals; humans get infected mainly by direct contact with infected animal tissues (e.g. blood) but also by the vectors (predominantly mosquitos). Prevention of disease in animals by vaccination is considered essential to protect humans from infection.\n\nUntil 1977, RVF was known to be limited to sub-Saharan Africa, mainly as an animal disease with zoonotic potential; in humans, it was mainly manifested as a self-limited febrile illness with the occasional complication of retinal lesions. During these years, the interest in the disease beyond Africa was practically limited to those engaged in potential biological warfare agents. In 1977, the disease was recorded, for the 1st time, in Egypt where it caused a major event with critical impact upon human health, continuing during 1978. The disease was associated with severe and fatal hemorrhagic fever and encephalitis. An official Egyptian report counted 598 deaths. Estimates of clinical cases from field workers exceeded 200 000 (Egypt's population at that time was 41 million). The animal industry suffered serious losses due to clinical disease, abortions, decreased production, and deaths. Mortality was high in sheep and cattle; it was intermediate or low in buffaloes, camels and goats. The disease spread throughout many of Egypt's governorates. During the early 1980's, some batches of an imported inactivated RVF animal vaccine were applied to terminate/prevent the circulation of the virus in the delta area and in Sinai.\n\nSince 1978, exacerbations of RVF have been reported from Egypt in 1993, 1994, 1997 and 2003. According to Egypt's OIE reports, the last RVF occurrence was in 2004. However, low-level circulation of the virus has been demonstrated there several times during the inter-epizootic periods, the disease regarded to have become endemic. New introductions, mainly by camels and cattle imported from Sudan and Ethiopia, are considered to occur.\n\nInitially, killed vaccines were applied for the general preventive annual vaccinations, while live attenuated Smithburn-strain vaccine was introduced during outbreaks. Since 2007, the GOVs have banned the use of the live attenuated vaccine, deciding to use only the inactivated ZH501 vaccine for regular immunization against RVFV in animals. This Binary ethylenamine inactivated and Alum adjuvanted vaccine, produced by VSVRI (Veterinary Serum & Vaccine Research Institute, Abbassia, Cairo) is based upon the 501 strain of RVFV, isolated during the 1977 epidemic from a patient with fatal hemorrhagic fever hospitalized in the Zagazig Fever Hospital, 83 km [51.6 mi] northeast of Cairo. The inactivated vaccine has overcome the disadvantages of the live attenuated vaccine, such as abortion in pregnant animals, and is applicable in all susceptible animal species. Both FMD and RVF vaccines, combined, are injected to cattle, water buffaloes, sheep and goats; camels are vaccinated only with the RVF vaccine.\n\nSome of the above, and additional data on RVF and its control in Egypt, as well as control, including vaccinations, in imported animals, is available in references 1 and 2.\n\nReferences\n1.

Until 1977, RVF was known to be limited to sub-Saharan Africa, mainly as an animal disease with zoonotic potential; in humans, it was mainly manifested as a self-limited febrile illness with the occasional complication of retinal lesions. This Binary ethylenamine inactivated and Alum adjuvanted vaccine, produced by VSVRI (Veterinary Serum & Vaccine Research Institute, Abbassia, Cairo) is based upon the 501 strain of RVFV, isolated during the 1977 epidemic from a patient with fatal hemorrhagic fever hospitalized in the Zagazig Fever Hospital, 83 km [51.6 mi] northeast of Cairo. \n\nFMD is endemic in Egypt; according to the most recent available EUFMD's monthly Global FMD Situation Report (January 2019), its incidence in Egypt is 'high,' the presumed FMD virus serotypes currently circulating being O (O/EA-3) and, to a lesser extent, SAT 2. \n\nInitially, killed vaccines were applied for the general preventive annual vaccinations, while live attenuated Smithburn-strain vaccine was introduced during outbreaks. The inactivated vaccine has overcome the disadvantages of the live attenuated vaccine, such as abortion in pregnant animals, and is applicable in all susceptible animal species. The disease is vector-borne in animals; humans get infected mainly by direct contact with infected animal tissues (e.g. blood) but also by the vectors (predominantly mosquitos). Since 2007, the GOVs have banned the use of the live attenuated vaccine, deciding to use only the inactivated ZH501 vaccine for regular immunization against RVFV in animals. \n\nSome of the above, and additional data on RVF and its control in Egypt, as well as control, including vaccinations, in imported animals, is available in references 1 and 2. During the early 1980's, some batches of an imported inactivated RVF animal vaccine were applied to terminate/prevent the circulation of the virus in the delta area and in Sinai.

Raw milk should not be consumed if it is not treated. A viral animal disease, Rift Valley fever mainly affects domestic ruminants (cattle, sheep, goats), causing abortions and high mortality in young animals. As we reported earlier, a quarter of Coconi high school is affected.\n\nThe virus can be transmitted from sick animals to humans. Since the 1st cases occurred in late November 2018, 39 animal outbreaks have been identified, and 82 human cases have been reported.\n\nThe prefecture of Mayotte, in collaboration with the ARS Indian Ocean and the Directorate of Food, Agriculture and Forestry of Mayotte (DAAF) stresses the importance of prevention measures to protect yourself from the disease.\n\nEpidemiological situation as of 1 Mar 2019\n------------------------------------------\nProtect yourself during handling. In total, since the beginning of the epidemic (end of November 2018):\n- Samples taken by veterinarians from sick animals or during abortions have identified 39 outbreaks (30 bovine). Animal foci are mainly located in the center and north west of the island.\n- 82 human cases of RVF have been reported to the monitoring and health emergencies platform of the Agence r\u00e9gionale de sant\u00e9 Oc\u00e9an Indien (CVAGS) of R\u00e9union and Mayotte by the CHM laboratory. The weekly number of reported cases has remained stable for 3 weeks. Human cases are mainly located in the center and northwest of the island.\n\nIn ruminants, the monitoring of Rift Valley fever involves the monitoring of abortions:\n- breeders are required to report promptly to veterinarians any abortions occurring in their animals or sick animals in order to take samples from the animals;\n- an order prohibiting the marketing of untreated milk has been in force since 27 Feb 2019.\n\nIn humans, the disease usually manifests as an influenza-like illness: high fever (39 C [102 F]), muscle and/or joint pain, severe headache, and fatigue. In the vast majority of cases, healing occurs within a few days. Consult a doctor as soon as signs appear so that samples to detect the disease can be taken.\n\nFor breeders and people in contact with animals:\n- wash hands with soap after contact with domestic ruminants (cattle, sheep, goats);\n- do not handle unprotected or diseased animals or abortion products without protection;\n- do not handle animal carcasses without protection;\n- wear gloves, goggles and especially a mask for the slaughter of any animal. Infected animals may have no signs, although they can transmit the virus.\n\nFor food preparation:\n- boil the milk;\n- do not consume curd unless it has been boiled and curdled via lactic fermentation;\n- wash hands after cutting meat;\n- do not eat uncooked meat;\n- do not consume the meat of a sick animal.\n\nTo protect yourself from mosquito bites:\n- eliminate breeding sites, empty all containers that may contain water;\n- use mosquito nets and repellents.\n\nIn the event of symptoms appearing, immediately consult your doctor.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[This Rift Valley fever (RVF) outbreak has been going on since November 2018.

Most of the cases were located in the western part of the island.\n\nSamples made on ruminants present around human cases were analyzed at CIRAD in Reunion for the search for the RVF virus. The results identified several positive animals in different villages located in west and center of the island.\n\nIn addition, an IgM-positive cattle has been reported in Mamoudzou. This 2-year-old cattle belongs to a breeding herd of 8 cattle, including 4 adults and 4 2-month-old calves. Biological control and investigations are underway.\n\nECDC reports that the detection of autochthonous Rift Valley fever cases on Mayotte is not unexpected, but the occurrence of 19 cases within a short time period is of concern, as current weather conditions (rainy season from November to March) are favorable for the vectors.\n\nRift Valley fever (RVF) is an illness that is primarily spread by direct contact with blood, fluids, or tissues of infected animals such as cattle, buffalo, sheep, goats, and camels. Less commonly, it can also be spread through mosquito bites.\n\nMost people with RVF do not feel sick or have only mild illness. Symptoms of RVF include fever, weakness, back pain, dizziness, and weight loss. However, a small percentage (8-10%) of people may have more serious illness, such as severe bleeding, swelling of the brain, or eye disease.

Results showed that the virus may be even more damaging to fetuses than the Zika virus, which set off a global crisis in 2015 and left thousands of babies in Central America and South America with severe birth defects.\n\n'Zika caught everybody by surprise,' said Amy Hartman, an infectious disease specialist at the University of Pittsburgh, who led the research. 'If doctors had known about Zika's birth effects, they could have done a lot more to protect pregnant women and babies. With Rift Valley fever, we're trying to get ahead of the curve.'\n\nRift Valley fever primarily occurs in livestock in sub-Saharan Africa, where outbreaks cause 90 to 100 percent of pregnant cows in a herd to miscarry or deliver stillborn calves, often a significant economic loss.\n\nBut hundreds of cases also occur in humans each year, causing flulike symptoms and severe liver problems. The outbreaks have moved beyond Africa: In late 2000, an outbreak in Saudi Arabia infected more than 100 000 people and led to at least 700 deaths, according to Dr. Hartman. The mosquito that carries the disease is also found in Europe and the Americas.\n\n'Climate change can alter how emerging infectious diseases will spread,' Dr. Harman said. 'As mosquito populations move and change, we have a potential for this to spread far beyond its normal boundaries.'\n\nThere are no vaccines or treatments for Rift Valley fever. The World Health Organization has called the disease a potential public health emergency.\n\nThere are 2 documented cases of infected fetuses. One infant was born with an enlarged liver and spleen, among other symptoms; the other died within a week. Because the disease can be asymptomatic in pregnant women, many more cases of abnormalities and stillbirths may have been misidentified.\n\nAmong rats used in the study, 65 percent of the pups born to infected mothers died, compared to 25 percent of pups born from uninfected controls. Each infected mother lost at least one pup, and all of the infected mothers' offspring contracted the virus.\n\nPregnant rats were also more susceptible to death from Rift Valley fever than nonpregnant rats.\n\nMost surprising to researchers, the infected mothers' placentas harbored more virus than any other tissue in the body, more than even the liver, where the virus's damage is typically observed.\n\n'No one in the field recognized this before,' said Cynthia McMillen, a postdoctoral researcher in Dr. Hartman's lab, and one of the study's lead authors.\n\nTesting on human placental tissue revealed that, unlike the Zika virus, Rift Valley fever virus has a unique ability to infect a specialized layer of cells that supports the region of the placenta where nutrients flow in.\n\nZika must take the 'side roads' into the placenta to infect a fetus, while the Rift Valley fever virus can take the 'expressway,' Dr. Hartman said.\n\n'The fetus is protected from hundreds of thousands of dangers that could affect it,' she added. 'Only a few microbes can get past, and this is one of them.'\n\nLast week, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations launched a call for proposals to develop human vaccines against Rift Valley fever. About USD 48 million will finance up to 8 projects on Rift Valley fever and chikungunya viruses, according to an announcement.\n\n'We need more research into the epidemiology, how it causes disease, and how to prevent it,' Dr. McMillen said. 'This could spread beyond where it is found in the Middle East, so awareness is sorely needed.'\n\n[Byline: Emily Baumgaertner]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n[The above report provides more details and discussion than the abstract of the original article in Science Advances does (posted on 12 Dec 2018 as Rift Valley fever: vertical transmission 20181210.6203158).\n\nWe need to pay attention to the Harman statement, 'As mosquito populations move and change, we have a potential for this [virus] to spread far beyond its normal boundaries.'\n\nRift Valley fever (RVF) virus transmission has been active in East Africa in 2018 and is endemic there. If West Nile virus made it across the Atlantic Ocean to the Americas, there is reason to assume that RVF virus would be able to make the same journey and with competent vectors present, initiate ongoing transmission. The World Health Organization's classification of RVF as a potential public health emergency is justification enough for development of a vaccine for human use. One hopes that the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations' call for proposals to develop human vaccines against RVF will elicit an ample response.

To date, 31 human cases of RVF have been reported by the CHM laboratory to the ARS Indian Ocean.\n\nRVF mainly affects domestic ruminants (cattle, sheep, goats), but can occasionally infect humans. The Prefecture of Mayotte, in collaboration with the ARS Indian Ocean and the Directorate of Food, Agriculture and Forestry of Mayotte (DAAF) reminds the population of the importance of implementing recommendations and actions of prevention to protect against the disease.\n\nEpidemiological situation\nAs of 6 Feb 2019, 31 [human] cases of RVF were reported to the monitoring and health emergency platform of the ARS OI (CVAGS) of Mayotte by the CHM laboratory.\n\nSamples taken by the veterinary services in sick animals or during abortions have also made it possible to identify 23 outbreaks of infected animals (comprising from 1-6 animals) including 7 in sheep/goats, mainly located in the center of the island.\n\nRVF is a zoonosis (infectious disease that can be transmitted from animals to humans) of viral origin, which mainly affects domestic ruminants (cattle, sheep, goats), causing abortions and high mortality in young animals.\n\nTransmission to humans can occur in different ways:\n- Contact with blood, body fluids or tissues of a sick animal (during slaughter, cutting of meat, calving, nursing, etc.) is the most important risk. The most exposed people are professionals such as breeders, slaughterers and veterinarians.\n- By mosquito bites that can transmit the virus from animals to humans, especially near infected flocks.\n- Infection can also occur when eating curd or unboiled milk from an infected animal.\n\nOn the other hand, no direct person-to-person transmission of RVF has been reported to date.\n\nThe disease in humans is usually manifested by an influenza-like illness that clears in a few days: high fever (39 C [102 F]), muscle and/or joint pain, severe headache, tiredness. However, in 5% of cases, more serious forms may occur: ocular meningitis/meningoencephalitis, haemorrhagic fever.\n\nSince the 1st report, every sick person is being interviewed by the Indian Ocean SAR to try to describe the circumstances of the infection. Treatment of [mosquito] larval breeding and adult mosquito control are done by the service of the anti-vector fight and are taken to the homes of sick persons and around the houses.\n\nInformation to health professionals was made available to strengthen surveillance and identification of human cases.\n\nHealth authorities recommend:\nFor breeders and people in contact with animals:\n- Wash hands with soap after contact with domestic ruminants (cattle, sheep, goats).\n- Do not handle sick or aborted animals, or abortion products without protection.\n- Do not handle animal carcasses without protection.\n- Always wear gloves, goggles, and especially a mask for the slaughter of any animal. Infected animals may have no signs, although they can transmit the virus.\n\nFor food consumption:\n- Boil the local milk.\n- Do not eat curd unless it is pasteurized.\n- Wash your hands after cutting meat.\n- Cook meat well.\n- Do not consume the meat of a sick animal.\n\nTo protect yourself from mosquito bites:\n- Eliminate breeding sites, empty all containers that may contain water.\n- Use mosquito nets and repellents.\n\nIn the event of symptoms appearing: Immediately consult your doctor\n\n[Byline: Anne Perzo]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[This outbreak has been going on since November 2018.

In July and August 2018, there were 10 RVF outbreaks reported to OIE. A 12 Jul 2018 report indicated that more than 10 people died following an outbreak of RVF in Kenya, with more than 120 cases reported countrywide. RVF virus is endemic in Kenya. Mosquitoes infected with the virus can pass it along through eggs. These eggs can persist alive with the virus when laid in wet areas (dambos) and can survive subsequent drying. They hatch when water returns, and virus transmission can begin again.\n\nAs Mod.AS noted in an earlier 2018 post, Rift Valley fever is a per-acute or acute zoonotic disease of domestic ruminants. The virus is confined to the African continent and Arabian Peninsula. It is caused by a single serotype of a mosquito-borne virus of the _Bunyaviridae_ family (genus _Phlebovirus_). The disease occurs in climatic conditions favouring the breeding of mosquito vectors and is characterised by abortion, neonatal mortality and liver damage. The disease is most severe in sheep, goats and cattle. Older non-pregnant animals, although susceptible to infection, are more resistant to clinical disease. There is considerable variation in the susceptibility to RVF of animals of different species. Camels usually have an inapparent infection with RVF virus (RVFV), but sudden mortality, neonatal mortality, and abortion occur, and abortion rates can be as high as in cattle.\n\nHumans are susceptible to RVFV and are infected through contact with infected animal material (body fluids or tissues) or through bites from infected mosquitoes. RVFV has also caused serious infections in laboratory workers and must be handled with biosafety and biocontainment measures. [There is a 7 Jan 2019 report stating that there are 2 documented cases of infected human fetuses. One infant was born with an enlarged liver and spleen, among other symptoms; the other died within a week. Because the disease can be asymptomatic in pregnant women, many more cases of abnormalities and stillbirths may have been misidentified. Mod.TY\n\nRainfall facilitates mosquito eggs to hatch. _Aedes_ mosquitoes acquire the virus from feeding on infected animals, and may potentially vertically transmit the virus so that new generations of infected mosquitoes may hatch from their eggs. This provides a potential mechanism for maintaining the virus in nature, as the eggs of these mosquitoes may survive for periods of up to several years in dry conditions. Once livestock is infected, a wide variety of mosquito species may act as the vector for transmission of RVFV and can spread the disease.\n\nLow level RVF activity may take place during inter-epizootic periods. RVF should be suspected when exceptional flooding and subsequent abundant mosquito populations are followed by the occurrence of abortions, together with fatal disease marked by necrosis and hemorrhages in the liver that particularly affect newborn lambs, kids and calves, potentially concurrent with the occurrence of an influenza-like illness in farm workers and people handling raw meat.\n\nThe current wet season in East Africa has been characterized by heavy rains and flooding, which enhance suitable ecological conditions for RVF vectors' amplification, increasing the risk of RVF occurrence. Recent suitability maps for RVF vector amplification, produced by FAO, showed a suitability pattern very similar to the one observed during the period September 2006-December 2007, a period that was characterized by abnormal, heavy rains and flooding, which were followed by a major epizootic and epidemic in the region.\n\nOne hopes that these 2 reported cases are not an indication of a coming repeat of the 2018 RVF outbreak with threats to both human and animal health. - Mod.TY\n\nHealthMap/ProMED map available at:\nKenya: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/174]", "summary": "Communicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/health/article/2001312757/test-show-more-rift-fever-cases\n\n\nTests conducted at the Kenya Medical Research Institute laboratory in Nairobi last week confirmed that 2 people had contracted the zoonotic viral disease [Rift Valley fever].

In human mid-gestation placental tissue, RVFV directly infected placental chorionic villi, with replication detected in the outermost syncytial layer.

According to media reports, Rwanda has been suffering RVF cases in animals since June 2018; this is in line with recent media reports from Uganda, stating that the disease was already introduced into the Isingiro district in late June 2018 (see archive no. 20180817.5966611).\n\nThe Uganda Radio Network published information on a confirmed human case on Fri 29 Jun 2018 (archive no. 20180701.5884295); additional human cases in Uganda were reported by the WHO several days later. These cases had likely been preceded by (hitherto, not recorded) diseased ruminants (sheep, goats, cattle).\n\nRecent media report from Uganda addressed the role of cattle meat (beef) as a source of RVF infection in consumers. Illegal slaughter of animals and the sale of meat that has not undergone ante- and post-mortem veterinary inspection is obviously potentially harmful to consumers due to various meat-borne pathogens, toxins, etc. According to experts' view, endorsed by the relevant international organisations (WHO, OIE, FAO), meat consumption, in contrast to blood and milk consumption, is generally not known to be an RVF risk factor. Those engaged in the slaughtering process, as well as others in close contact with infected animals, their organs, and secretions (e.g., veterinarians, farmers) may be exposed to infected blood, either directly or as aerosol, getting 'occupationally' infected.\n\nArticle 8.15.11. of OIE's Terrestrial code has been phrased accordingly to facilitate, under detailed conditions, international trade in fresh meat and meat products, even if they come from countries or zones that are not free from RVF infection. The article says the following:\n\n'Veterinary authorities should require the presentation of an international veterinary certificate attesting that the entire consignment of meat comes from\n- ruminants that showed no clinical sign of RVF within 24 hours before slaughter;\n- ruminants that were slaughtered in an approved slaughterhouse/abattoir and were subjected to ante- and post-mortem inspections with favourable results;\n- carcasses that were submitted to maturation at a temperature above 2 deg C [36 deg F] for a minimum period of 24 hours following slaughter.'\n\nThe above OIE 'immediate notification' from Uganda says that RVF vaccination in Uganda is 'prohibited.' This policy deserves to be explained. - Mod.AS\n\nHealthMap/ProMED-mail maps:\nUganda: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/97\nMbarara District, Uganda: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/3660\nIsingiro District, Uganda: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/3008\nLyantonde District, Uganda: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/24897]", "summary": "A ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n Sep 2018 from Dr Anna Rose Ademun Okurut, acting commissioner, Animal Health, Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Industry and Fisheries, Entebbe, Uganda\n\nSummary\nReport type: immediate notification\n Outbreak 3: Lyantonde (Lyantonde), LY\n\nTotal animals affected\nSpecies / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered\n \n- ruminants that were slaughtered in an approved slaughterhouse/abattoir and were subjected to ante- and post-mortem inspections with favourable results;\n- carcasses that were submitted to maturation at a temperature above 2 deg C The article says the following:\n\n'Veterinary authorities should require the presentation of an international veterinary certificate attesting that the entire consignment of meat comes from\n- ruminants that showed no clinical sign of RVF within 24 hours before slaughter; Manifestation of disease: clinical disease\nCausal agent: Rift Valley fever virus\n Outbreak 1: Mbarara (Mutonto, Keirungi), RR\nOutbreak 2: Isingiro (Nakivale), NG\n RIFT VALLEY FEVER - EASTERN AFRICA (31): UGANDA, BOVINE, OIE\n************************************************************\n Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n< Uganda: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/97\nMbarara District, Uganda: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/3660\n Measures applied: movement control inside the country, quarantine, control of vectors, vector surveillance, vaccination prohibited, no treatment of affected animals\n\nMeasures to be applied: no other measures\n\nFuture reporting: The event is continuing.

Kamurali yesterday [12 Aug 2018] met with journalists at Little Woods in Mbarara town [Mbarara district].\n\nKamurali said Isingiro is one of the most affected districts because of its geographical location bordering with Tanzania, Rwanda, and crossing Lake Mburo national park. He also reported that several people have died because of the epidemic in the area. 'We have already buried some of the important people on the team fighting Rift Valley fever; we lost [J], who was Commandant of Orukiinga Refuge Settlement, and many others,' said Kamurali.\n\nMbarara District Health Officer (DHO) Dr. Peter Ssebutinde reported that the disease has crossed to the districts of Isingiro, Kiruhura, Sembabule, Mbarara, Ibanda, and Kasese. He described signs of hemorrhagic fever as severe headache, stomach pain, vomiting, among others, adding that it kills a person within 6 days when he/she receives no treatment. Chairman Kamurali reported that the epidemic crossed to Isingiro on [26 Jun 2018] but has spread rampantly for the past 3 days [10-12 Aug 2018]. He added that the District Emergency Team was formed to make an isolation centre to treat the infected patients and report new outbreaks within the district.\n\n'One was put at Rwekubo and another will be put at Kashojo health centre 3 in the middle of Nakivale settlement [Isingiro district].' However, he said the isolation camps are not stocked with drugs.\n\n'We are seeking intervention from NHCR, UNICEF, and the Health Ministry to give us drugs to contain the disease.' Among the heavily affected subcounties include Kashumba, Orukiinga, and Isingiro and Sheema.\n\nBlood samples that were taken to Kampala show that out of the 50 cattle, 23 were found infected with Rift Valley fever in Isingiro district. In humans, out of 28 suspected cases, 19 were discharged, 6 died, and the others are recovering.

The disease has already claimed 11 people and left several others in critical condition in 2 months, according to local authorities.\n\nDr. Moses Nkanika, the Lyantonde District Health Officer-DHO, says there is a possibility that the victims consumed meat from infected cows, sheep and goats. He says 2 other patients died after being referred to Mabarara Regional Hospital. Nine of the deaths have been reported in Kitazigolokwa village, Katovu parish in Lyantonde rural sub-county.\n\nNkanika said that they have received several cases from different sub-counties, and the most complicated are referred to Mbarara Regional hospital. He noted that they are on high alert to the spread of the disease.\n\nDr. Okoth Obo, the Medical Superintendent of Lyantonde Hospital, said they established an isolation center to handle RVF cases, adding that they have received 10 patients in recent weeks.\n\nPatrick Rwozi, the Katovu Parish councilor, says some of the victims died after 2 or 3 days in admission. In Kansagama sub-county, more than 10 people in Mityekula village, Kagaala parish have been admitted in critical condition after consuming meat from an infected cow. Bebwa Abern, the Mityekula village secretary, says one of the residents slaughtered a sick cow and sold meat to fellow residents.\n\nRVF is a viral disease that primarily affects animals but has the capacity to infect humans and can result in death, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).\n\nRonald Bameka, the Lyantonde District Veterinary Officer, says over 15 cows and 22 goats have died since the outbreak. He says that over 200 animals are at high risk, which may lead to a huge loss to livestock dealers in Lyantonde.\n\nHe warns that meat from infected animals is being sneaked into the market posing a high risk to the consumers, adding that they have so far arrested 3 people for slaughtering sick cows and selling meat to unsuspecting residents.\n\nAccording to Bameka, he wrote to the ministry of Agriculture Animal Industry and Fisheries and the ministry of health seeking their intervention, but neither has responded.\n\nIn order to contain the spread of the fever, Fred Muhangi, the Lyantonde LCV Chairperson, says the district has already paid for radio programs to sensitize the public about the outbreak.\n\nHe says that they have also stepped up their operations against the sale of uninspected meat as well as unauthorized animal movement in the district. The RVF outbreak comes at a time when the district is still under a foot-and-mouth-disease quarantine, which has hindered the livestock business.\n\nThe Health Ministry Permanent Secretary, Dr. Diana Atwine, says different teams of experts have already been dispatched to Lyantonde, Mbarara, Isingiro and Kiruhura where the outbreak was announced.\n\nThe teams will educated people about the outbreak and the danger of eating meat from infected cows.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Previous reports from Uganda placed the blame for occurrence of Rift Valley fever (RVF) on incoming refugees.

Due to the drought conditions prevailing at that time, which are regarded unfavourable for vector amplification, Rift Valley fever (RVF) was not suspected. However, when 2 RVF cases were diagnosed in humans in February 2019 in Ol Kalou, the capital of Nyandarua County (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20190213.6315356), surveillance in animals, particularly addressing aborting cattle, was intensified. This led to the discovery of RVF in animals as described in the OIE notification. Mass vaccination followed.\n\nIn June-July 2018, a major RVF epidemic hit Kenya, particularly in its eastern area, affecting both humans and animals; 10 outbreaks were reported. These outbreaks were located in the counties of Wajir, Tana River, Isiolo, Siaya, Baringo, Marsabit, Mandera, and Meru. The event was resolved on 30 Jul 2018.

The disease has so far killed over 500 livestock, mostly goats and sheep, at Kiserian in the past 2 months. This has left many families that rely on livestock without a source of livelihood.\n\nBaringo South veterinary officer Julius Cheruiyot yesterday [Sat 4 Aug 2018] said vaccination was started after samples taken to government laboratories were positive for Rift Valley fever (RVF). 'We have started a vector control programme [...] to prevent its further spread,' said Dr Cheruiyot.\n\nBefore RVF was diagnosed livestock were being treated for blue [tongue] disease. However, the high number of abortions, especially in goats and sheep, raised the alarm, prompting testing for RVF.\n\nCheruiyot said veterinary officers were working with local administrators to educate residents about the disease. He warned against consuming meat from uninspected carcasses. 'Dead animals should be buried,' he said. Livestock get infected by RVF through mosquitoes that breed higher during heavy rains.\n\n[byline: Mercy Kahenda]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The above media report is somewhat confusing. While Baringo South Constituency is one of 6 constituencies in Baringo County, one of Kenya's 47 counties, Kiserian is a settlement in another county, Kajiado county. Both counties, Baringo and Kajiado, are located in the former Rift Valley Province.\n\nThe information may be interpreted as follows: while heavy losses are said to have been caused by RVF in the Kajiado county, mass preventive vaccinations are planned to be applied in the Baringo South Constituency, probably not (yet) affected by the disease. Confirmation or otherwise would be welcomed.\n\nThe total number of reported RVF outbreaks in Kenya's animals since the start of the event (3 Jun 2018) is 10, according to the 6 official reports submitted so far to the OIE. The most recent follow-up report was submitted on 6 Aug 2018, informing absence of new outbreaks (since 2 Jul 2018). The outbreaks were reported from the following counties (number of outbreaks in brackets): Mandera (1), Wajir (2), Marsabit (1), Isiolo (2), Meru (1), Baringo (1), Tara River (1), and Siaya (1).

For Kenya's counties map, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counties_of_Kenya.\n\nThe media report also highlights a diagnostic challenge. The simultaneous circulation of other animal diseases, such as bluetongue in sheep, deserves to be considered. Bluetongue, endemic throughout Africa, is a seasonal vectorborne disease, clinically seriously affecting mainly sheep of exotic breeds (most cases in goats and cattle are subclinical). Bluetongue is not zoonotic. Other abortifacient infectious agents, including zoonotic ones such as brucellosis, chlamydiasis, toxoplasmosis, Q fever and salmonellosis, deserve to be excluded as well. The striking difference between them and RVF is the higher mortality rates in the latter, particularly in offspring, and the acute, influenza-like disease in man. - Mod.AS\n\nHealthMap/ProMED map available at:\nKenya: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/174]", "summary": "A ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n The outbreaks were reported from the following counties (number of outbreaks in brackets): Mandera (1), Wajir (2), Marsabit (1), Isiolo (2), Meru (1), Baringo (1), Tara River (1), and Siaya (1). \n\n[byline: Mercy Kahenda]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n< \n\nThe total number of reported RVF outbreaks in Kenya's animals since the start of the event (3 Jun 2018) is 10, according to the 6 official reports submitted so far to the OIE. \n\nThe information may be interpreted as follows: while heavy losses are said to have been caused by RVF in the Kajiado county, mass preventive vaccinations are planned to be applied in the Baringo South Constituency, probably not (yet) affected by the disease.

The appeal comes after an outbreak of Rift Valley Fever [RVF] -- a deadly and infectious viral disease -- killed 154 cows countrywide since May [2018], according to figures from Rwanda Agricultural Board (RAB).\n\nGahiga Gashumba, the chairman of Rwanda National Dairy Farmers' Federation, told The New Times that in their performance contracts, districts set themselves targets to inoculate cows, which leaves a gap in achieving effective vaccination.\n\nEfforts to contain the recent outbreak of RVF included vaccinating 257 902 cows countrywide of which 119 520 were from Ngoma, Kirehe, and Kayonza -- the hardest hit by the disease. 'All cows should be vaccinated at least in areas prone to given diseases,' Gashumba said adding, 'We need a clear vaccination calendar detailing the cows that should be immunised in a given period of time. When there are heavy rains, we should be prepared of [immunising cows against] East Coast fever.' Also known as theileriosis, East Coast fever is a deadly tickborne disease in cattle.\n\nNgoma district vice mayor for Finance and Economic Development, Jean Marie Vianney Rwiririza, said that this year [2018], they want many cows to get vaccines against different diseases, including RVF and foot and mouth disease [FMD]. 'With using funds from the district's budget alone, we cannot manage to give vaccines to all cows. We request farmers' cooperatives and the farmers themselves to partake in the activity so that all the cows can be inoculated,' he told The New Times.\n\nIn Kirehe district, there are over 52 000 cows and over 30 000 of them were vaccinated against different diseases, including Rift Valley fever in the 2017/2018 financial year, according to Jean Damasc\u00e8ne Nsengiyumva, Kirehe district vice mayor for Finance and Economic Development. 'We have increased funding for the vaccination activity so that we inject all cows which we should vaccinate because we do not want the recurrence of such a problem,' he said referring to RVF.\n\nRwanda Agriculture Board (RAB) said that they do not vaccinate all the cows because it can be wastage of resources or poor management when vaccination is done in areas where a disease has not been reported while it can be contained by vaccinating livestock in the risk zone. Instead of spending money on vaccinating all cows, currently estimated at over a million countrywide, appropriate strategies are devised to control the spread of outbreaks, said RAB director general Dr Patrick Karangwa. 'We give more attention to diseases that spread faster than others. We do impact assessment based on spread pattern of a disease. If a disease can be transmitted through air, measures taken to prevent its spreading should be different from the disease that cows or people catch through contact,' Karangwa said.\n\nHe cited FMD which often affects cattle on areas bordering Tanzania, such as Gatsibo, Kayonza, and Nyagatare, observing that when the disease has been checked in those areas, it dose spread elsewhere, pointing out that if all cows in the country are vaccinated, all the funds used [for the development of the livestock] sector might be consumed by such a single activity.\n\nSome vaccines are given free of charge, while others have to be paid for by farmers with government subsidy.\n\n[byline: Emmanuel Ntirenganya]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[RVF has become, according to local media, active in Rwanda in April 2018, as reported from the districts of Ngoma, Kirehe, and Kayonza, in the south west of the Eastern province. It was expressed mainly by cattle death and abortions. Later, Kamonyi, a southern province was added.\n\nThe Rwandan Ministry of Agriculture and Animal Resources announced on [Mon 30 Jul 2018] the lifting of the ban imposed since mid-June [2018] on the movement of cattle in several parts of Eastern province. According to the ministry, 99 of the 147 604 cows in the affected districts died, and 452 aborted. This differs from other statistics from various sources, including the 154 deaths in cattle, as mentioned in the above media report, quoting the Rwanda Agricultural Board. Official statistics are expected to be included in Rwanda's RVF report to the OIE, which all member countries are obliged to submit.\n\nIn the absence of data on the number of susceptible animals on the affected holdings, the mortality rate in cattle is not known. Based on accumulated field observations and experimental RVF infection trials, the mortality in adult cattle would, generally, not exceed 10 per cent. No human cases have been reported in Rwanda during the recent event.\n\nVaccination of livestock against RVF can be applied either with a live attenuated (Smithburn) vaccine (relatively cheap, several years immunity rendered, but may cause fetal abnormalities or abortion in pregnant animals).

' \n\nRwanda Agriculture Board (RAB) said that they do not vaccinate all the cows because it can be wastage of resources or poor management when vaccination is done in areas where a disease has not been reported while it can be contained by vaccinating livestock in the risk zone. All cows should be vaccinated at least in areas prone to given diseases,' Gashumba said adding, 'We need a clear vaccination calendar detailing the cows that should be immunised in a given period of time. He cited FMD which often affects cattle on areas bordering Tanzania, such as Gatsibo, Kayonza, and Nyagatare, observing that when the disease has been checked in those areas, it dose spread elsewhere, pointing out that if all cows in the country are vaccinated, all the funds used [for the development of the livestock] sector might be consumed by such a single activity. The appeal comes after an outbreak of Rift Valley Fever [RVF] -- a deadly and infectious viral disease -- killed 154 cows countrywide since May [2018], according to figures from Rwanda Agricultural Board (RAB). \n\nEfforts to contain the recent outbreak of RVF included vaccinating 257 902 cows countrywide of which 119 520 were from Ngoma, Kirehe, and Kayonza -- the hardest hit by the disease. ' \n\nFor the considerations related to vaccine policies, vaccines to be selected, and other tools for the prevention and control of RVF under various epidemiological situations, please refer to references 1-3.\n\n In Kirehe district, there are over 52 000 cows and over 30 000 of them were vaccinated against different diseases, including Rift Valley fever in the 2017/2018 financial year, according to Jean Damasc\u00e8ne Nsengiyumva, Kirehe district vice mayor for Finance and Economic Development. ' \n\nGahiga Gashumba, the chairman of Rwanda National Dairy Farmers' Federation, told The New Times that in their performance contracts, districts set themselves targets to inoculate cows, which leaves a gap in achieving effective vaccination. \n\n\nLivestock farmers have appealed to the government to ensure that cows get timely vaccination in order to effectively control deadly epidemics in cattle. \n\nThe Rwandan Ministry of Agriculture and Animal Resources announced on [Mon 30 Jul 2018] the lifting of the ban imposed since mid-June [2018] on the movement of cattle in several parts of Eastern province. If a disease can be transmitted through air, measures taken to prevent its spreading should be different from the disease that cows or people catch through contact,' Karangwa said. Alternatively, particularly in pregnant animals, an inactivated (formalin-killed) RVF vaccine can be selected (more costly, safer in all breeds/ages/reproductive stages of cattle, sheep, and goats, but requires a booster 3-6 months after the initial vaccination, then followed by yearly boosters). Instead of spending money on vaccinating all cows, currently estimated at over a million countrywide, appropriate strategies are devised to control the spread of outbreaks, said RAB director general Dr Patrick Karangwa.

This is a case fatality ratio of 11 percent. [There is also one case in Siaya county, which brings the total to 94. - Mod.TY]\n\nRift Valley fever is an illness that is primarily spread by direct contact with blood, fluids, or tissues of infected animals such as cattle, buffalo, sheep, goats, and camels.\n\nLess commonly, it can also be spread through mosquito bites.\n\nAccording to the CDC, if think you may have RVF while traveling, see a doctor and do not take pain relievers that contain aspirin or ibuprofen, which may lead to a greater tendency to bleed.\n\nAdditionally, the CDC says if you are traveling to Kenya, you should be up to date on routine vaccinations. These vaccines include measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis vaccine, varicella (chickenpox) vaccine, polio vaccine, yearly flu shot, as well as a Hepatitis A vaccine. CDC recommends this vaccine because you can get hepatitis A through contaminated food or water in Kenya, regardless of where you are eating or staying.\n\nTyphoid is another vaccine that travelers should consider. Typhoid is contracted through contaminated food or water in Kenya. CDC recommends this vaccine for most travelers, especially if you are staying with friends or relatives, visiting smaller cities or rural areas, or if you are an adventurous eater.\n\nMoreover, Yellow fever virus is a risk in certain parts of Kenya. Which means, the CDC recommends the yellow fever vaccine for travelers 9 months of age or older to these areas.\n\nAnd the government of Kenya requires proof of yellow fever vaccination if you are traveling from a country with risk of yellow fever, which does not include the USA.\n\nFor a complete list, see countries with risk of yellow fever virus (YFV) transmission.\n\nIf you need to be vaccinated before your trip, you may need to travel some distance since Yellow fever vaccine availability in the USA is currently limited.\n\nTo schedule a travel vaccination appointment, please visit Vax-Before-Travel.\n\nThe CDC Vaccine Price List provides private sector vaccine prices for general information.\n\nVaccines, like any medicine, can have side effects, says the CDC.

One suspected case, identified on arrival at Mbarara Regional Referral Hospital, ran away from the isolation ward before any further assessment was done. The 2nd is waiting for results and is in the isolation ward. All cases were confirmed by PCR at UVRI (Uganda Virology Research Institute).\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[2]\nDate: Sun 22 Jul 2018\nSource: Mbarara News [edited]\nhttp://mbararanews.co.ug/ankole-residents-worried-as-rift-valley-fever-sweeps-across-the-region/\n\n\nResidents, leaders, and health experts in the Ankole region and the country at large are worried following the outbreak of the deadly Rift Valley fever (RVF).\n\nThe outbreak of this hemorrhagic fever has already been reported in the districts of Isingiro, Kiruhura, Sembabule, Mbarara, Ibanda, and Kasese. In the Isingiro district alone, 2 people have died. Reports indicate that more than 5 people have died in different areas, while up to 7 people are currently undergoing treatment in various hospitals in the region.\n\nRVF is in the category of hemorrhagic fevers along with Marburg and Ebola, which is why the outbreak has put the region and the country on alert. This acute viral disease primarily affects domestic animals such as cattle, sheep, goats, and camels but also infects humans. It is spread by either touching infected animal blood, consuming meat and milk products from an infected animal, or being bitten by infected mosquitoes.\n\nMbarara district health officer Peter Ssebutinde is cautioning Ugandans against eating meat and consuming products of dead animals to avert the spread of RVF. Isingiro District Resident District Commissioner Herbert Muhangi said more vigilance among the population is needed if the fight against RVF is to be successful.\n\nAlison Ayetoranire Byamukama, the former Special Presidential Assistant for Buhweju Affairs, wants the ministry of health as well as partners like WHO to provide the region with more experts to boost the fight against this outbreak. 'We need more experts to come and support the health teams in the region. Also, we need to fund the hospitals in the region to establish isolation centres for the RVF patients; we also need funds to enable these facilities to extend the best treatment,' she said.\n\n[Byline: Bourn]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The WHO report above indicates that there are 8 human cases (6 confirmed) and 3 deaths. Both reports state that cases are geographically widespread and have occurred in 6 regions. No mention is made of vaccination of domestic animals in either report.\n\nAs noted earlier, although people can become infected through contact with sick animals or their tissues and secretions, RVF virus can also be transmitted by mosquitoes. An earlier report indicated that this year's [2018's] heavy rainfall has resulted in widespread flooding in low-lying grasslands. Flooding and standing water have enabled a higher number of mosquito eggs than usual to hatch and thus has increased the potential for RVF to spread among people and animals.\n\nThe RVF virus is endemic in the Eastern Africa region and has caused repeated outbreaks in the past. It affects primarily ruminant livestock, such as cattle, sheep, goats, and camels, and also wildlife such as buffalos. In these animals, it causes abortions and deaths, resulting in significant economic loss.\n\nThe RVF virus can also affect humans. Most infections are mild, but some people fall severely ill and even die, with symptoms such as fever, weakness, and bleeding from the gums and mouth. The majority of human infections result from direct or indirect contact with the blood, body fluids, or tissues of infected animals. This can happen during slaughtering or butchering, while assisting with animal births or treating the animals, and from contact with disposed carcasses or fetuses. - Mod.TY\n\nHealthMap/ProMED-mail map:\nUganda: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/97]", "summary": "A ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n[1]\n Source: Mbarara News [edited]\nhttp://mbararanews.co.ug/ankole-residents-worried-as-rift-valley-fever-sweeps-across-the-region/\n\n\nResidents, leaders, and health experts in the Ankole region and the country at large are worried following the outbreak of the deadly Rift Valley fever (RVF). \n\nAs noted earlier, although people can become infected through contact with sick animals or their tissues and secretions, RVF virus can also be transmitted by mosquitoes.

Targeted vaccination of healthy livestock in the 3 districts is under way, starting from affected zones and moving to cover the risk area. Vaccination cost is fully covered by the government of Rwanda. A strong awareness campaign is underway through several radio (RBA, IZUBA, ISANGO STAR, KT Radio, Huguka, New times, Radio Salus, Communities Radio Nyagatare, Huye) announcements educating the public on how to avoid further spread of the disease, especially avoiding mosquitoes, sleeping under mosquito nets, and clearing bushes that are hiding and breeding areas for mosquitoes. People are advised to report signs of suspected cases of livestock to veterinarians and to avoid meat from livestock that shows signs of the disease. MINAGRI has acquired an acaricide (drug used to control ticks and mosquitoes) that has proved to be very effective and has deployed staff to help farmers spray their livestock, paying particular attention to proper mixing and application of the acaricide. FAO has provided PPEs and sample shipment materials to the National Veterinary Laboratory from the USAID-funded emergency stockpiles. A total of 237 386 cattle, 22 727 goats, and 17 872 sheep were vaccinated, which represent 84.6 per cent of the risk area. In addition, 457 858 animals (cattle, goats, and sheep) were sprayed using an acaricide.\n\nControl measures\nMeasures applied: movement control inside the country, surveillance outside containment and/or protection zone, surveillance within containment and/or protection zone, screening, zoning, disinfection, control of vectors, vector surveillance, ante and post-mortem inspections, no treatment of affected animals\n\nVaccination in response to the outbreak (s)\nAdministrative division/ Species / Total vaccinated/ Details\nBugesera / cattle / 17500 / Smithburn (live) KEVEVAPI\nGakenke / cattle / 7165 / Smithburn (live) KEVEVAPI\nGasabo / cattle / 9176 / Smithburn (live) KEVEVAPI\nGatsibo / cattle / 3000 / Smithburn (live) KEVEVAPI\nGisagara / cattle / 7881 / Smithburn (live) KEVEVAPI\nKamonyi / cattle / 29092 / Smithburn (live) KEVEVAPI\nKayonza / cattle / 31916 / Smithburn (live) KEVEVAPI\nKirehe / cattle / 23552 / Smithburn (live) KEVEVAPI\nMuhanga / cattle / 7610 / Smithburn (live) KEVEVAPI\nNyamagabe / cattle / 7379 / Smithburn (live) KEVEVAPI\nNyanza / cattle / 17840 / Smithburn (live) KEVEVAPI\nNyaruguru / cattle / 5000 / Smithburn (live) KEVEVAPI\nRuhango / cattle / 7366 / Smithburn (live) KEVEVAPI\nRulindo / cattle / 9478 / Smithburn (live) KEVEVAPI\nGicumbi / cattle / 12503 / Smithburn (live) KEVEVAPI\nHuye / cattle / 9050 / Smithburn (live) KEVEVAPI\nNgoma / cattle / 29990 / Smithburn (live) KEVEVAPI\nNyagatare / cattle / 9915 / Smithburn (live) KEVEVAPI\n\nMeasures to be applied: No other measures\n\nDiagnostic test results\nLaboratory name and type: National Veterinary Laboratory of Rubirizi (national laboratory)\nSpecies / Test / Test date / Result\nCattle / IgG-capture ELISA / 29 Jun 2018 / positive\nCattle / IgG-capture ELISA / 6 Jun 2018 / positive\n\nFuture reporting\nThe event is continuing.

No information has been provided on outbreaks occurring in Kayonza and Kamonyi; but vaccination in response to the outbreak(s) was applied in all these districts. See comments of Mod.AS in ProMED-mail posts 20180731.5938668 and 20180808.5953335.\n\nThe following background information about RVF is excerpted from OIE (see http://www.oie.int/en/animal-health-in-the-world/animal-diseases/rift-valley-fever/#G):\n\n'Rift Valley fever (RVF) is an acute viral disease that can cause severe disease in domestic animals (such as buffalo, camels, cattle, goats, and sheep) and humans. Disease in these species is characterized by fever, severe illness, abortions, and a high morbidity and mortality rate.\n\n'The virus that causes RVF belongs to the genus _Phlebovirus_ in the family Bunyaviridae. Many of the related Bunyaviridae viruses can cause fever and encephalitis. Another commonly known Bunyaviridae virus is the hantavirus.\n\n'Many different species of mosquitoes are vectors for the RVF virus, and RVF is most commonly encountered during years of unusually heavy rainfall and subsequent flourishing of mosquito populations. 'Mosquitoes will feed on viraemic (virus circulating in the bloodstream) animals and then transmit the virus to other animals on which they subsequently feed. 'Some species of mosquitoes (_Aedes_, for example) are capable of transmitting the virus from infected female mosquitoes to offspring via its eggs.\n\n'This contributes to the survival of the virus in the environment. Mosquito eggs may survive during prolonged periods (up to several years) in dry conditions. During periods of high rainfall and/or flooding, the eggs hatch, and there is an increase in the infection of animals on which these mosquitoes feed.\n\n'RVF is a zoonosis (a disease that primarily affects animals but causes disease in humans). Humans are highly susceptible to the RVF virus and may become infected by being bitten by infected mosquitoes; through contact with blood, other body fluids, or tissues during killing, skinning, and cutting of infected animals; or by consumption of raw milk or uncooked meat from infected animals. Humans working in slaughter facilities, laboratories, or hospitals are at risk of acquiring infections.'\n\nA map of Rwanda can be seen at http://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/map/rwanda_map2.htm. -

Two people and 7 cows have already died of the fever. The closed markets include Ddyango and Kamuli in Kyalulangira and Kiziba sub-counties, respectively. Others are Kacheera and Lwamagwa livestock markets.\n\nLivestock farmers in Kyalulangira, under their umbrella body Nyekundire Farmers' Association, say the district authorities had been reluctant to close the markets in the past month over revenue.\n\n'We have been telling them to close the markets, but they were looking at revenue likely to be lost. People's health is more important than the targeted revenue from cattle traders. Even the foot and mouth disease could have been contained a long time ago if those people [district authorities] were vigilant,' Mr Robert Kanyete, the association chairperson, said in an interview on Tuesday [7 Aug 2018].\n\nThe district veterinary officer, Mr Erias Kizito Nsubuga, said the closure of the markets followed a directive from the anti-stock safety unit to control the spread. 'RVF has not yet extended to Rakai, but we closed the markets to prevent it from spreading to our district since traders buy cattle from different farms, including those in Isingiro,' Dr Nsubuga said.\n\nHe added that they also temporarily imposed a ban on the slaughter of cattle and sale of dairy products such as milk as they monitor the situation. He said the fever will not spread to the district due to their robust surveillance system. 'We have capacity in responding to outbreaks, and we have proved that over the years,' he said. Livestock farmers have suffered unending outbreaks of FMD since 2015, prompting government to place them under quarantine.\n\nAccording to World Health Organisation (WHO), [RVF] can be transmitted to people either by tick bites or contact with infected animal blood or tissues during and immediately after slaughter.\n\n[byline: Wilson Kutumba and Al-Mahdi Ssenkabirwa]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[For the locations of Rakai (western province) and its neighbor district, the RVF-affected Isingiro (central province), please go to the table and map at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rakai_District. - Mod.AS\n\nHealthMap/ProMED-mail map: Rakai District, Uganda: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/3724]\n\n******\n[2] Kenya, spread to Kilifi's cattle\nDate: Fri 10 Aug 2018\nSource: The Star (Kenya) [edited]\nhttps://www.the-star.co.ke/news/2018/08/10/quarantine-in-kilifi-amid-rift-valley-fever-outbreak_c1799931\n\n\nThe county government of Kilifi has issued a quarantine against the movement of livestock in Magarini and Malindi sub-counties following cases of Rift Valley fever [RVF]. County executive committee member for agriculture, livestock, and fisheries Luciana Sanzua confirmed on Wednesday [8 Aug 2018] that 16 goats and 2 cattle have died of RVF.\n\nSpeaking at the governor's office, Sanzua also confirmed that 17 abattoirs and 4 slaughter slabs have been shut down in the 2 sub-counties. 'There were reported cases of abortions in animals in 2 private farms and 2 homesteads in the 2 sub-counties. Abortions in animals is the main clinical sign of RVF in animals; thus, these were handled as suspected cases. Blood samples were taken from the animals and submitted to the Central Veterinary Laboratory-Kabete-Nairobi. This was on [Thu 12 Jul 2018]. We received the results on [Mon 30 Jul 2018]; 18 out of the 78 samples turned positive,' said Sanzua. She said the spread was a result of the heavy rains and subsequent flooding in the 2 sub-counties.\n\nThe department has since embarked on the spraying of animals with acaricide (chemical), which kills the type of mosquito that breeds in flooded areas and is the type responsible for incubation and starting off of the chain of transmission. 'We imposed the quarantine last week to avoid the spread of the disease to other areas. We have also restricted the movement of livestock from Tana River and Garissa counties to our county. Our surveillance team is on the ground, and we urge members of the public to avoid red meat for the time being,' added Sanzua. The department of health has also closed down butcheries in the 2 sub-counties.\n\nOn Wednesday [8 Aug 2018], health county executive committee member Anisa Omar said no cases of human infection have been reported in the county. She said all health workers have been put on a 24-hour surveillance. 'All our medical officers in our health facilities have been instructed to screen anyone who may present with symptoms of RVF. We also urge members of the public to sleep in mosquito-treated nets to keep off the vector,' she said.\n\nAccording to WHO, there is some evidence that humans may become infected with RVF by ingesting the unpasteurized or uncooked milk of infected animals. The majority of human infections result from direct or indirect contact with the blood or organs of infected animals. The virus can be transmitted to humans through the handling of animal tissue during slaughtering or butchering, assisting with animal births, conducting veterinary procedures, or from the disposal of carcasses or foetuses. Certain occupational groups, such as herders, farmers, slaughterhouse workers, and veterinarians, are therefore at higher risk of infection.\n\nThe virus infects humans through inoculation, for example via a wound from an infected knife or through contact with broken skin, or through inhalation of aerosols produced during the slaughter of infected animals.\n\n[byline: Elias Yaa]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[This is the 1st notification of RVF from Kenya's coastal Kilifi County, situated south of the RVF-infected Tana River County, in south east Kenya.\n\nKilifi was one of the 20 counties advised during the 2nd week of June 2018 [week of 11 Jun 2018], shortly after the initial detection of human RVF cases in Kenya, 'to immediately commence animal vaccination and vector control.'

According to reports, the fever is spreading in the districts of Mbarara, Ibanda, Kirihura, and Isingiro. By press time, 3 people had been reported dead at Mbarara Regional Referral Hospital.\n\nAccording to Dr Rose Muhindo, a physician at Mbarara Regional Referral Hospital, in the past 2 weeks [the hospital] received 5 patients with normal medical symptoms such as headache, chest pain, diarrhea, and fever, but what struck the staff was when the patients presented with bleeding. Tests confirmed that the patients were suffering from Rift Valley fever.\n\nMuhindo said the 1st patient who was admitted was from Isingiro. The patient [died] on arrival before any tests were carried out. Another patient was from Nakivale settlement camp in Isingiro, and the other 2 were from Ibanda and Kiruhura.\n\n'We have lost 3 patients,' Muhindo said. 'One was coughing blood and died on arrival. Shortly after, we lost another one. However, we are still waiting for results to confirm what could have killed them. The good news is that we have managed to save the lives of 2 patients who will be discharged 2 days from now.' Muhindo says this is a sporadic outbreak. The disease typically presents specific and hemorrhagic signs. Transmitted by mosquitoes and blood-feeding flies, the disease is caused by a virus that usually affects animals, commonly cattle and sheep, but can also attack humans.\n\nRift Valley fever is in the category of hemorrhagic fevers along with Marburg and Ebola. The disease ranges from a mild flu-like illness to a severe hemorrhagic fever that can be lethal among humans.\n\n'A patient 1st presents severe headache, vomiting, and stomach pain,' Muhindo said. 'Later, bleeding occurs. [The disease] can occur when a person is bitten by a mosquito that fed from infected livestock or when the person eats meat from infected livestock if it's not cooked [properly].' She added that there is no human-to-human transmission of the disease, unlike with Marburg and Ebola. 'Our message from the medical team to the public is they should avoid eating meat that is not well prepared. If the animals have died, they should be buried or burnt; once we go ahead and try to eat this meat, that is how we get infected.'\n\nDr Muhindo said they have not confirmed Crimean Congo fever; however, they are still waiting for the results from Uganda Virus Research Institute Entebbe. 'When we get a patient, we run many tests. [It's not appropriate to] report results that have not been confirmed. We have confirmed Rift Valley fever, not Crimean Congo fever. We are still waiting for the results from UVRI.'\n\n[Staff] have the protective gear to handle the hemorrhagic fever, Muhindo added. 'We have gone ahead and trained our clinicians who receive the patients to identify patients suspected to have the fever. It's natural that people fear bleeding patients, so [once we are informed], we are ready to do our work.'\n\nDr Barigye Celestine, the hospital director at Mbarara Regional Referral Hospital, echoed [Muhinda's comments] and asked the veterinary officers to help sensitize the public on the health complications caused by eating dead livestock. Barigye also confirmed that patients with hemorrhagic fever are put in an isolation centre for treatment.\n\n[byline: Adolf Ayoreka]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The number of Rift Valley fever (RVF) cases has increased from 3 to 5.

As noted earlier, although people can become infected through contact with sick animals or their tissues and secretions, RVF virus can also be transmitted by mosquitoes. An earlier report indicated that this year's [2018] heavy rainfall has resulted in widespread flooding in low-lying grasslands.

It affects primarily ruminant livestock, such as cattle, sheep, goats, and camels, and also wildlife such as buffalos. In these animals, it causes abortions and deaths, resulting in significant economic loss.\n\nThe RVF virus can also affect humans.

These outbreaks are ongoing and pose a threat to the whole Eastern African region. Although the upcoming [dry] season from July 2018 onwards will be unsuitable for the vector populations in most of the Eastern African region (except for Ethiopia, South Sudan, and southern Sudan), the potential spread of the disease through animal movements and informal trade routes within and outside of Kenya is likely to occur.\n\nTherefore, FAO advises the veterinary services and livestock farmers' communities in the region to remain vigilant to the potential occurrence and spread of RVF in humans and/or animals. In particular, the risk of RVF spread is considered to be very high in Kenya and moderate in Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Rwanda, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Uganda, and United Republic of Tanzania. In addition, given the current and predicted above average precipitation forecasts for the period June-September 2018, southern Sudan and western Ethiopia may also experience suitable environmental conditions for RVF vector amplification.\n\nThe outbreak in Kenya is not the 1st RVF re-emergence in the region: during the past 7 months, RVF infections have been reported in Uganda (November 2017) and South Sudan (December 2017). Informal cross-border movement of livestock, conflicts, and a lack of veterinary services can facilitate the spread of RVF within the affected countries in East Africa.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The above forecast may have been issued before the lab confirmation of the 1st RVF case in Uganda on 29 Jun 2018. This event involved a human patient; no animal cases have been reported there yet.\n\nAccording to earlier reports from Rwanda, RVF has been causing disease and mortality in animals since April 2018. So far, this information has not been submitted to the OIE, and no information on diagnostic tests applied has become available. Notably, the FAO Early Warning Bulletin refers to Rwanda as a country in which the risk of RVF spread is considered to be 'moderate.'\n\nIn Kenya, RVF was recorded initially in the Wajir county (within the former North Eastern province) and later in at least 6 additional counties affecting humans and animals. On Thu 5 Jul 2018, the Wajir County government lifted the ban on consumption of meat and milk. The county Health Chief Officer Abdirahman Mathow said the disease has been contained (see at http://www.kenya24news.com/kenya/wajir-lifts-meat-ban-says-rift-valley-fever-contained/35417-news).\n\nIn West Africa, precipitation forecast for June-September 2018 predicts above average rainfall in southwest Mali and southeast Niger, which are both endemic countries for RVF. These countries should, according to the FAO, remain vigilant about RVF in the coming months.\n\nThe South African region has a low risk of vector amplification because it is entering the winter season, which is cold and dry with low rainfall, and because of the highly localized nature of the current outbreak in South Africa. However, given the fact that the said outbreak is ongoing, the risk of further spread within the country is considered to be moderate due to movement of infected livestock. - Mod.AS\n\nHealthMap/ProMED map available at:\nAfrica: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/6075]", "summary": "A ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n Although the upcoming [dry] season from July 2018 onwards will be unsuitable for the vector populations in most of the Eastern African region (except for Ethiopia, South Sudan, and southern Sudan), the potential spread of the disease through animal movements and informal trade routes within and outside of Kenya is likely to occur. \n\nThe South African region has a low risk of vector amplification because it is entering the winter season, which is cold and dry with low rainfall, and because of the highly localized nature of the current outbreak in South Africa.

On [Thu 12 Jun 2018], international medical-humanitarian organisation Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) sent a team to Wajir County, the most affected county, to support the Kenyan Ministry of Health (MoH) in containing and managing the disease.\n\nRVF is caused by a virus transmitted by mosquitoes and blood-feeding flies that usually affects animals (commonly cattle, camels, and sheep), but it can also affect humans. In humans, the disease ranges from a mild flu-like illness to severe haemorrhagic fever that can be lethal.\n\nThe outbreak was confirmed on [Thu 7 Jun 2018] after 4 patients who had died in Wajir tested positive with the disease. So far, 85 cases, including 3 patients who were readmitted, have been reported in the county, with 6 having died since the beginning of the outbreak.\n\n'We 1st assessed the situation on the ground, then worked together with the Ministry of Health to identify gaps in the response,' said Ahmed Garat, MSF's Emergency Field Coordinator leading the response.\n\nThe team set up an isolation centre in which patients can be managed at the Wajir County Referral Hospital. So far, 6 patients have been treated at the facility. 'MSF will continue monitoring the situation and responding where necessary, and we are hopeful that the situation will improve with better contingencies in place, although RVF tends to be quite unpredictable,' adds Garat. MSF is also providing medical supplies to the county to aid in containing the disease.\n\nMSF is working closely with the MoH, training staff on patient management and diagnosis of cases, enhancing their capacity to detect and rapidly respond and contain the outbreak. In a training that involves patients and their caretakers as well, the staff will also be trained on prevention aspects, vector control, and use of mosquito nets.\n\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The number of human Rift Valley fever cases continues to slowly increase. Since Fri [11 May 2018], the beginning of the outbreak, a cumulative total of 90 cases and 10 deaths (case fatality rate 11 percent) was reported as of Wed [27 Jun 2018]. The nationwide case count for all of Kenya now stands at more than 120 with more than 10 deaths. The [Fri 29 Jun 2018] WHO summary reported that the most affected age group was 21-30 years, with men making up 70 percent of the ProMED-mail cases. At that time, 3 counties were affected: Wajir (78 cases, 6 deaths), Marsabit (11 cases, 3 deaths), and Siaya (1 case, 1 death) (see ProMED-mail archive Rift Valley fever - Eastern Africa (10): Kenya, WHO, livestock vaccination 20180704.5886934). Increased surveillance by the Ministry of Health with the collaboration of MSF will be important in case-finding and timely treatment.\n\nIn the previous ProMED-mail post, Mod.AS pointed out that, so far, the virus has been shown as active in 7 out of Kenya's 47 counties. In addition to the 6 above, the following counties have been recognized as currently at high risk for RVF: Tana River, Tharaka Nithi, Garissa, Lamu, Baringo, Mombasa, and Nairobi.

On [28 Jun 2018], 2 unrelated simultaneous cases were confirmed, one in each district. The 1st case-patient was a 47-year-old male from Kanyatsi village in Munkunyu sub-county, Kasese District, whose main occupation was as a butcher. He fell ill on [20 Jun 2018] with symptoms of fever and headache, and self-administered antimalarial treatment. The case-patient died at home on the evening of [21 Jun 2018], with the body oozing blood from multiple orifices. The district health authority collected a nasal swab (posthumous) on notification of the death and the specimen was sent to the Uganda Virus Research Institute (UVRI) on [25 Jun 2018]. The test result released on [28 Jun 2018] was positive for RVF by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).\n\nThe 2nd case-patient was a 35-year-old male casual labourer and herdsman from Kabare village in Isingiro town council, Isingiro District. The village is located near Lake Nakivale and borders Lake Mburo National park. On [25 Jun 2018], he developed fever, headache, and anorexia, which was followed by epistaxis. He presented to the local health facility the same day, but was immediately referred to the regional referral hospital because of the severity of his illness and suspicion of a viral haemorrhagic disease. The case-patient was admitted in the isolation unit. A blood specimen was obtained and shipped to UVRI on [26 Jun 2018]. The test result released by UVRI on [28 Jun 2018] was positive for RVF on RT-PCR. The case-patient died on [30 Jun 2018] and a supervised burial was carried out.\n\nThere is a report of another confirmed RVF case in Ibanda District, on which more information is being sought and 2 other suspected cases are reportedly being investigated in Mbarara (1) and Kasese (1) districts. Additionally, 55 animal specimens were collected from the farm where one of the confirmed cases worked and in Isingiro town council abattoir.\n\nA further update will be provided on the evolution of this event.\n\nPublic Health Actions\n---------------------\n- A national rapid response team from the Ministry of Health, the Public Health Fellowship Program, UVRI, and the National Animal Disease Diagnostics of the Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Industry and Fisheries was constituted and deployed to the affected districts to conduct outbreak investigation and support response activities.\n- The isolation unit in Mbarara Regional Referral Hospital has been designated as the main treatment centre, while the district hospitals have also been prepared to handle cases.\n- A supervised safe and dignified burial was conducted for both fatal cases.\n- Active surveillance is being enhanced and healthcare workers have been urged to maintain a high index of suspicion for RVF in affected districts.\n- Infection prevention and control practices are being improved through use of personal protective equipment that was prepositioned by WHO in the hospitals.\n- A limited quantity of information, communication and education materials was provided to the district health teams to facilitate health education in the communities.\n\nSituation Interpretation\n------------------------\nIn Uganda, 2 districts have simultaneously confirmed RVF cases, with a possible 3rd one. This outbreak has occurred at a time when Kenya is reporting a large RVF outbreak and Rwanda is experiencing an epizootic, with suspected human cases. The affected districts in Uganda fall within the cattle corridor, stretching from the south-western, through central to north-eastern parts of the country. With the ongoing/approaching rainy season and in line with the risk modeling carried out by FAO in May 2018 (showing suitability for vector amplification in several countries in East Africa), the ongoing RVF outbreaks in Uganda and in the subregion may have wider public health and economic impacts if not attended to appropriately. There is a need to strengthen response and preparedness in Uganda and the other neighbouring countries, with a One Health approach, focusing on both human and animal health interventions.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[There are now 2 confirmed human cases of Rift Valley fever in Uganda. Given the Rift Valley fever (RVF) outbreak in Kenya involving domestic animals and humans, it is not surprising that there is a human case in neighboring Uganda. A Sun 24 Jun 2018 report from a meeting of 11th meeting of the Sectoral Council on Agriculture and Food Security (SCAFS) that just concluded in Dar es Salaam, has directed the East African Community (EAC) secretariat to address the issue of Rift Valley fever promptly. It stated that this year's [2018] heavy rainfall has resulted in widespread flooding in low-lying grasslands. Flooding and standing water enabled a higher number of mosquito eggs than usual to hatch and thus increased the potential for RVF to spread among people and animals.\n\nThe RVF virus is endemic in the EAC region and has caused repeated outbreaks in the past. It affects primarily ruminant livestock, such as cattle, sheep, goats, and camels and also wildlife such as buffalos. In these animals, it causes abortions and deaths and significant economic loss.\n\nThe RVF virus can also affect humans. Most infections are mild, but some people fall severely ill and even die, with symptoms such as fever, weakness, and bleeding from gums and mouth. The majority of human infections result from direct or indirect contact with the blood, body fluids, or tissues of infected animals. This can happen during slaughtering or butchering, while assisting with animal births, treating the animals, and from contact with disposed carcasses or fetuses. - Mod.TY\n\nMap of Uganda: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Districts_of_Uganda\nHealthMap/ProMED-mail map of Uganda: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/97]", "summary": "A ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n ---------------------\n- A national rapid response team from the Ministry of Health, the Public Health Fellowship Program, UVRI, and the National Animal Disease Diagnostics of the Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Industry and Fisheries was constituted and deployed to the affected districts to conduct outbreak investigation and support response activities. \n\nThere is a report of another confirmed RVF case in Ibanda District, on which more information is being sought and 2 other suspected cases are reportedly being investigated in Mbarara (1) and Kasese (1) districts. \n- A limited quantity of information, communication and education materials was provided to the district health teams to facilitate health education in the communities.

In particular, the risk of RVF spread is considered to be very high in Kenya and moderate in Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Rwanda, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Uganda, and United Republic of Tanzania. In addition, given the current and predicted average precipitation forecasts for the period June-September 2018, southern Sudan and western Ethiopia may be also characterized by suitable environmental conditions for RVF vector amplification.\n\nThe outbreak in Kenya is not the 1st RVF re-emergence in the region: during the past 7 months, RVF infections have been reported in Uganda (November 2017) and South Sudan (December 2017). Informal cross-border movement of livestock, conflicts, and lack of veterinary services can facilitate the spread of RVF within the affected countries in East Africa.\n\n[A Map, included in the alert message, presented (a) Predicted RVF risk areas for May 2018, and (b) predicted precipitation anomalies for the period July-September 2018].\n\nIn order to prevent and mitigate any occurrence of RVF in the region,\nFAO ADVISES COUNTRIES AT RISK TO:\na) Increase awareness of RVF clinical signs among farmers and workers in abattoirs and animal markets through newspapers, radio, mobile phones or other means of communication.\nb) Include aspects of occupational and exposure hazards (butchers, slaughter plant personnel, veterinarians and assistants) in communication campaigns and public awareness;\nc) Strengthen disease surveillance: active surveillance through serological surveillance of sentinel herds and syndrome surveillance for animals in at-risk areas (especially unusual abortion storms at any stage of pregnancy among small ruminants, camels and cattle). This should include surveillance in markets or places where large numbers are traded or congregate;\nd) Advocate the immediate notification of any RVF outbreak to the OIE through the World Animal Health Information System.\ne) Best practices for risk reduction:\n- Gloves and other appropriate protective clothing should be worn when handling sick animals or their tissues, or when slaughtering animals;\n- Fresh blood, raw milk or animal tissue should be thoroughly cooked before consumption;\n- Protecting against the risk of mosquito bites by using impregnated mosquito nets, personal insect repellent if available, light colored clothing (long-sleeved shirts and trousers), and by avoiding outdoor activity at peak biting times of the vector species.\nf) Promote targeted vaccination by trained personnel of susceptible animals in known at-risk areas\n- The use of vaccination as a control option for RVF is aimed at limiting virus circulation in enzootic areas and preventing epidemics in disease free areas and is most effective when used in conjunction with other control strategies, including surveillance, quarantine and movement controls;\n- Mass vaccination is one of the tools for preventing RVF epidemics in animals. However, vaccination is not recommended in the event of known or ongoing RVF virus circulation, as inappropriate vaccination can exacerbate the spread of virus transmission.\n\nNote that the FAO remains available to provide support for RVF preparedness/readiness for countries at risk and emergency response for countries facing outbreaks with the aim of protecting public and animal health, saving livelihoods and maintaining food security.\n\nIMPORTANT LINKS\n1.

The disease has been detected in cows that died in the district's 4 sectors of Rukoma, Kayenzi, Ngamba and Nyarubaka.\n\nRwanda Agricultural Board reports, as of [30 Jun 2018], at least 11 cows died from RVF, one cow is showing signs of RVF disease, and 24 have aborted in the process. Rukoma sector has so far been hit hardest by the outbreak, with 8 cows killed, one showing signs of RVF, and 5 have aborted. Also, 2 more cows died of RVF in Ngamba and one in Kayenzi, and the most abortion cases (19) were identified in Nyarubaka sector, where one cow also died.\n\nDr. Solange Uwituze, the RAB Deputy Director General in charge of Animal Resources Research and Technology Transfer, said they are currently treating infected cows while vaccination continues in the affected areas. 'Actually, the district had previously had animals vaccinated against RVF disease for farmers raising cows near River Nyabarongo. Unfortunately, the disease spread to areas due to stagnated water brought about by recent heavy rains,' she told The New Times.\n\nShe added: 'We are now vaccinating non-RVF-infected cows and calves under 3 months of age, especially in susceptible areas, while those which were infected are being treated.' Dr. Uwituze also cautioned livestock farmers and the public to wear protective gear while treating or touching infected or dead cows to ensure self-protection against further spread. But she advised that the most important thing is that farmers should raise their cows in cowsheds, saying they are safer places to protect against diseases like the deadly fever.\n\nBefore striking Kamonyi, more than 100 cows were killed by RVF disease in the Eastern Province's Ngoma, Kirehe and Kayonza districts since April, pushing the Ministry of Agriculture to impose restriction on cattle movement in the province to avoid further spreading to other parts of the country. However, Dr. Uwituze said that despite the restricted movement, cattle business will continue to operate, but warned farmers to keep the animals away from wetlands.\n\nLast year, the Ministry of Agriculture and Animal Resources introduced a new livestock insurance scheme that will provide financial support to farmers in the event of death of their cattle as a mechanism to minimize risks and losses that farmers encounter. However, the scheme remains a work in progress.\n\n[Byline: Eddie Nsabimana]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[According to the above report, RVF, expressed mainly by cattle death and abortions, became active in Rwanda in April 2018, in the districts of Ngoma, Kirehe and Kayonza, in the southwest of the Eastern Province. Kamonyi, addressed in the report here, is a district in Rwanda's Southern Province.\n\nAn administrative map of Rwanda and detailed districts maps are available at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Districts_of_Rwanda#Eastern_Province.\n\nIn the absence of data on the number of susceptible animals on the affected holdings, the mortality rate in cattle is not known. Based on accumulated field observations and experimental RVF infection trials, the mortality in adult cattle is not expected to exceed 10 percent. So far, no human cases have been reported in Rwanda. \n\nThe tests upon which RVF has been confirmed and statistics pertaining to the number, locations, morbidity and mortality rates in Rwanda's animal population, are expected to be included in the due official immediate notification to the OIE. \n\nKenya submitted its immediate notification on 8 Jun 2018; follow-up reports have been submitted on 15 Jun, 22 Jun and 2 Jul [all 2018].

A retrospective epidemiologic investigation has established that the date of onset of illness in the index case was 11 May 2018, marking the beginning of the outbreak. Since then, a cumulative total of 90 cases and 10 deaths (case fatality rate 11 percent) have been reported as of 27 Jun 2018. Of the 90 cases, 18 have been confirmed by polymerase chain reaction. The most affected age group is 21-30 years, with men making up 70 percent of the cases.

A RVF epizootic had been reported in 4 counties (Kadjiado, Kitui, Marsabit, and Wajir) by the Ministry of Livestock, with a number of animal blood samples testing positive for RVF.

This outbreak is occurring among seminomadic and remote communities, who are largely dependent on their livestock for livelihood and as their main food source. While response interventions are ongoing, several gaps have been identified, including lack of information on emergency stocks at county level; inadequate vector control tools, equipment, pesticides and personal protective equipment; limited knowledge of RVF by healthcare workers; and inadequate information, education and communication materials. Vector surveillance and control for humans and animals in high risk counties is yet to start, while communication flow between the national, counties and the responding partners is inadequate.\n\nIn addition, a number of the areas affected by RVF are experiencing outbreaks of other epidemic-prone diseases, along with major insecurity in some regions. These factors are of great concern as they could contribute to further spread of the disease in the subregion. There are already reports of an epizootic in Rwanda and suspected human cases in Rwanda and Uganda. The national authorities and partners in Kenya need to continue scaling up response activities, based on the One Health approach, to prevent a much wider disease outbreak. The national authorities in the neighbouring countries also need to enhance preparedness for RVF, including active surveillance in both animals and humans.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The RVF outbreak continues in humans, with 36 new cases. Fortunately, there have been no new deaths.\n\nThe above report indicates that surveillance is needed to detect human and animal RVF virus cases and of vector virus mosquitoes as well. The prolonged rains mentioned in earlier reports have doubtless provided breeding sites for RVF virus vector mosquitoes. The advice to the public to only consume inspected animal products is prudent. The loss of hundreds of camels, sheep, and goats is a significant economic and cultural loss for their owners, many of whom depend on these animals for their livelihoods. - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[2] Isiolo county: livestock preventive vaccination\nDate: Tue, 3 Jul 2018\nSource: NTV News (formerly Nation TV, Kenya) [edited]\nhttps://www.nation.co.ke/video/news/4146788-4644764-eavi5bz/\n\n\nThe County government of Isiolo has launched a vaccination exercise targeting over 150 000 heads of livestock within the next 12 days.

RVF was identified, by positive blood tests, in animals (camels, sheep, goats) in the counties Wajir, Marsabit, Kadjiado (in the former 'Rift Valley' province) and in Kitui (in the former Eastern province).\n\nAccording to recent information, RVF has also been identified in animals in Mandera county, in the former North Eastern province (see 20180702.5885427), and in Isiolo county, located within the former Eastern province. That means that, so far, the virus has been shown as active in 7 out of Kenya's 47 counties. In addition to the 6 above, the following counties have been recognized as currently at high risk for RVF: Tana River, Tharaka Nithi, Garissa, Lamu, Baringo, Mombasa, and Nairobi.

New cases have been reported in Wajir East and Tarbaj, but the hotspots are in Eldas and Wajir West.\n\nFour patients are currently receiving treatment at Wajir Referral Hospital and Eldas dispensary.

This information has not become available in the recent reports.\n\nThe mortality rate may reach 70-100 percent in newborn lambs and kids, while estimated mortality in calves, older lambs, and kids varies from 10-70 percent, depending on various factors including their breed and bodily condition. Overall, the mortality rate is estimated to be 10-30 percent in adult sheep and less than 10 percent in adult cattle. Deaths are most common in pregnant ewes that abort. The disease in adult goats is generally regarded to be less severe than in adult sheep, though data are scarce. During the 1930 epizootic in Kenya, no outbreaks in goat herds were reported, though abortions were suspected. During an experimental trial in goats, virus levels in blood were significantly lower than those recorded in lambs of comparable age when exposed to similar doses. According to observations from Sudan (1981), mortality in goats was reported as 50 percent, compared to 90 percent in young lambs, around 70 percent in adult sheep, and 20 percent in calves.\n\nNotably, during the 1930 epizootic in Kenya and the 1960 major epizootic in South Africa, 4 RVF disease forms were recorded in sheep. The highest mortality rate (up to 100 percent) was observed in per-acute cases affecting newly born lambs. After an incubation period of about 12 hours, collapse and death followed within 36 hours. In young lambs, and to a lesser extent in adult sheep, an acute RVF form was noted, with mortality in lambs being high while not exceeding 20-30 percent in adult sheep. The most common RVF form in adult sheep was sub-acute, where a febrile reaction of 40-41 degrees C, lasting 24-96 hr, was accompanied by anorexia and general weakness. Abortions in pregnant ewes were a prominent symptom, some of them occurring during the convalescent phase of the disease. The least-pathogenic RVF form noted in sheep was mild or inapparent, seen in adult sheep. There was only slight febrile reaction, and the disease was usually detected only by serological examination.\n\nDuring the mentioned 2 epizootics, the RVF cases observed in cattle were significantly milder than those recorded in sheep, with lower morbidity and mortality rates. A febrile reaction that lasted 24-96 hr was accompanied by anorexia and general weakness. Abortions were numerous and occurred during the acute or convalescent phases of the disease. Mortality was lower than 10 percent, abortion being in many cases the only clinical manifestation of the disease.\n\nDuring the major outbreak in Zimbabwe in 1978, 15 percent of all cows in the affected areas aborted, the average mortality being less than 5 percent. In a closely inspected herd, 28 of 1000 cows died, and 85 percent of the remainder aborted. - Mod.AS]\n\n[The RVF outbreak continues in both humans and animals. The number of deaths is unclear. The minister of health said that there are 6 fatal cases, whereas the ministry of health's disease surveillance and response unit indicates at least 26 people have died.

Governor Moses Lenolkulal said the county's borders are susceptible to Rift Valley fever. 'Due to the wet conditions, our neighbours have been affected by RVF. That is why we have raised an alarm,' he said, adding that the county had improved surveillance as well as committing to vaccinate all the livestock.\n\n[Byline: Martin Njiru]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Samburu county, in the former Rift Valley province, Kenya, covers an area of roughly 21 000 sq km (8000 sq mi). The Samburu, a sub-tribe of the Maasai, are semi-nomadic pastoralists who herd mainly cattle but also keep sheep, goats, and camels. See map at https://tinyurl.com/ybnvtlhf.\n\nWhile cattle may clinically present a relatively mild form of RVF infection (see above), its role as source of human infection may be regarded significant. During several experimental infection trials in cattle, virus levels in blood were found comparable to those in sheep. Furthermore, the public-health hazard is increased by abortions being a main component of the disease presentation in cattle, similar to sheep.\n\nThe said data underline the importance of preventive vaccination in Samburu, where the disease has not yet been recorded. Live-attenuated vaccine should not be applied in pregnant animals.\n\nIn the meantime, an update of the situation in Rwanda is pending. The most recent information from this country was published by its Ministry of Agriculture and Animal Resources on [Thu 21 Jun 2018] (https://tinyurl.com/yarlfknv). The press release stated that the disease outbreak was linked to the adverse rains and floods that hit the country between March and May 2018 'fueling the reproduction of mosquitoes that fueled other livestock diseases like the tick-borne diseases in some parts of the country.' 'Figures indicate that 99 cows died of the disease, and it caused abortion among 452 cows. The virus has infected 1638 cattle, which are receiving treatment, while more than 1202 cattle have recovered. No human cases have been reported so far in Rwanda.' According to the said information, the mortality rate in cattle was about 6 percent.\n\nOfficial notification to the OIE, including updated information on the epidemiology and statistics of the disease, and of the diagnostic tests applied, is pending. - Mod.AS\n\nHealthMap/ProMED-mail map:\nKenya, Samburu county: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/45169]\n\n******\n[3] Uganda\nDate: Fri 29 Jun 2018\nSource: Uganda Radio Network [subscription or payment required, edited]\nhttps://ugandaradionetwork.com/a/story.php?s=108170\n\n\nDr Yusuf Baseke, the district health officer, says that samples taken from a suspect of the fever tested positive to Rift Valley haemorrhagic fever. The victim, a butcher, was last week found dead in his house in Kanyatsi Village Munkunyu sub county.\n\nAccording to WHO, Rift Valley fever [virus] can be transmitted to people either by tick bites or through contact with infected animal blood or tissues during and immediately after slaughter. Those infected with the fever present with symptoms such as muscle ache, dizziness, neck pain and stiffness, backache, headache, and sore eyes.\n\nDr Baseke warned residents against eating any type of meat and drinking raw milk. In January, the ministry of health confirmed 3 cases of the RVF from Kiboga, Buikwe, and Mityana districts.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Given the Rift Valley fever (RVF) outbreak in Kenya, it is not surprising that there is a human case in neighboring Uganda. A Sun 24 Jun 2018 report from a meeting of 11th meeting of the Sectoral Council on Agriculture and Food Security (SCAFS) that just concluded in Dar es Salaam has directed the East African Community (EAC) secretariat to address the issue of Rift Valley fever promptly. I stated that this year's [2018's] heavy rainfall has resulted in widespread flooding in low-lying grasslands. Flooding and standing water enabled a higher number of mosquito eggs than usual to hatch and thus increased the potential for RVF to spread among people and animals.\n\nThe RVF virus is endemic in the EAC region and has caused repeated outbreaks in the past. It affects primarily ruminant livestock, such as cattle, sheep, goats, and camels and also wildlife such as buffalos. In these animals, it causes abortions and deaths and significant economic loss.\n\nThe RVF virus can also affect humans. Most infections are mild, but some people fall severely ill and even die, with symptoms such as fever, weakness, and bleeding from gums and mouth. The majority of human infections result from direct or indirect contact with the blood, body fluids, or tissues of infected animals. This can happen during slaughtering or butchering, while assisting with animal births, treating the animals, and from contact with disposed carcasses or fetuses. - Mod.TY\n\nMap of Uganda: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Districts_of_Uganda\nHealthMap/ProMED-mail map of Uganda: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/97]", "summary": "A ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[According to the above report, which addresses the situation in the Wajir county (in the former North Eastern province), 'hundreds of camels, sheep, and goats have died since the disease outbreak' (reportedly, Thu 7 Jun 2018), while 'no case involving cattle has been reported since the outbreak.'

Some 24 cases were reported in Wajir and 2 in Marsabit.\n\nSiaya County on Friday [22 Jun 2018] issued an alert after one person died from the mosquito-borne disease, which was confirmed by tests at the Kenya Medical Research Institute (Kemri).\n\n'Tests for Ebola and Marburg virus were negative,' Dr Omondi Owino, Siaya's chief officer for Health, said.\n\nThe Health Ministry report says males were the most affected, at 70 percent. The most affected age group is 21-30 years.\n\nBased on enhanced surveillance of Rift Valley fever-like syndromes in humans and livestock, 6 counties have been identified as having the highest risk of an outbreak, including Tharaka-Nithi, Garissa, Tana River, Lamu, Garissa, Kajiado and Baringo.\n\nMombasa and Nairobi are on heightened alert due to the risk of imported human and animal cases.\n\nThe outbreak was 1st reported in Eldas Sub-County, Wajir, with a sample sent to Kemri testing positive for the virus on 7 Jun [2018].\n\nThe report said the outbreak was prevalent in insecurity-prone regions, and this might make it difficult to contain the virus. 'The communities are hard to reach (due to their nomadic lifestyle) and they depend majorly on animal products and have difficulties in accessing alternative diets,' the report said.\n\nThe ministry has formed a team of experts from government and non-governmental organisations to provide technical guidance to counties.\n\n'Counties affected have been directed to send blood specimens to Kemri for confirmation while the ban on movement and slaughter of animals from the affected and at-risk counties is put in place,' Dr Okunga said.\n\nThe ministry has provided 500 000 doses of RVF vaccine [for animals] to high-risk counties based on risk analysis, while indoor residual spraying and animal spraying with pyrethroids is being carried out at the epicentre.\n\nHowever, vector surveillance and control for humans and animals in high-risk counties are yet to start. 'This will start soon. We are going to ensure that the surveillance starts as soon as possible and investigation teams sent out to all high-risk counties to provide technical guidance before the outbreak,' he said.\n\nRift Valley fever is a disease that mainly affects livestock while people are mainly infected as a result of handling sick animals, either slaughtering them or assisting animals while giving birth. The other mode of transmission from animals, which is relatively low, is by mosquitoes and bites from other insects. The disease causes abortion in animals.\n\nDr Okunga cautioned residents not to directly handle sick animals or slaughter them without consulting veterinary or public health officers.\n\nResidents have also been encouraged to use mosquito [bed] nets.\n\n'Anyone with a sick animal -- mainly sheep and cows -- must report to the nearest authorities immediately, and cases of abortions or loss of pregnancy in these animals must be reported too,' he said.\n\n[Byline: Angela Oketch]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The RVF outbreak continues in both humans and animals.

They directed the Secretariat to include emerging and re-emerging diseases as a permanent agenda item in the subsequent meetings of the Sectoral Council on Agriculture and Food Security.\n\nTanzania is, however, not affected by the outbreak. At least 26 people in 2 north-eastern counties in Kenya are suspected of having contracted Rift Valley Fever (RVF). By [16 Jun 2018], 7 of these cases were confirmed and 6 of the people had died according to the World Health Organisation (WHO). The outbreak was reported to World Health Organisation and the International Organisation for Animal Health (OIE).\n\nIn Rwanda, the Ministry of Agriculture and Animal Resources confirmed cases of RVF among cattle after samples were tested at the Rwanda Agriculture Board Laboratory [see comment]. South Sudan reported an outbreak of RVF in March [2018] and is reported to be containing the situation.\n\nThe East African Community (EAC) Secretariat is closely monitoring the outbreaks and is urging the Partner States that are not yet affected by RVF to step up surveillance to detect any spread of the disease to their territories at an early stage and to inform the public about the risk and preventive measures.\n\nThe affected areas in Kenya include the counties of Wajir and Tana River on the border to Somalia and in Rwanda the districts of Kayonza, Kirehe and Ngoma. Kirehe borders Burundi, Tanzania and Uganda, causing a risk of cross-border spread of RVF.\n\nRift Valley Fever is a virus disease that is transmitted by infected mosquitos. This year's heavy rainfall has resulted in widespread flooding in low-lying grasslands. Flooding and standing water enabled a higher number of mosquito eggs than usual to hatch and thus increased the potential for RVF to spread among people and animals.\n\nThe RVF virus is endemic in the EAC region and has caused repeated outbreaks in the past. It affects primarily ruminant livestock, such as cattle, sheep, goats and camels and also wildlife, such as buffalos. In these animals, it causes abortions and deaths and significant economic loss.\n\nThe RVF virus can also affect humans. Most infections are mild, but some people fall severely ill and even die, with symptoms such as fever, weakness and bleeding from gums and mouth. The majority of human infections result from direct or indirect contact with the blood, body fluids or tissues of infected animals. This can happen during slaughtering or butchering, while assisting with animal births, treating the animals and from contact with disposed carcasses or fetuses.\n\nHuman-to-human transmission of RVF has not been documented.\n\n[Byline: Marc Nkwame]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The statement about the confirmation of RVF cases in cattle in Rwanda, as reported by the Ministry of Agriculture and Animal Resources in Rwanda, warrants official notification to the OIE, including details of the laboratory technique applied. Earlier media reports from Rwanda informed about high mortality rates in cattle, attributed to RVF. As rightly commented by a subscriber, such high mortality in (adult) cattle is rather unusual. Could other disease agents be involved, such as tick borne diseases? No human RVF cases have been reported, so far, from Rwanda\n\nOutbreaks of RVF occur in populations with low immunity levels and in association with events in local hydrology, like prolonged rains. As herd immunity is high just after an outbreak, in most endemic areas there are periods of years between reports of RVF.\n\nEast Africa is regarded an endemic RVF region; it has been demonstrated that the virus is transmitted transovarially in _Aedes_ mosquitos of the neomelaniconium group. These are floodwater breeding species that emerge in enormous numbers in floodplains and other habitats, where they oviposit. These mosquito eggs and the virus they carry, remain viable for long periods in the mud of dried-up surface pools or shallow depressions (locally known as dambos or pans and vlei), or in floodplains. Infected mosquitoes hatch from these when they flood again. This is now widely accepted as a key component of the endemic mechanism, outbursts of the zoonsis taking place after prolonged interepidemic periods in grasslands and semi-arid regions in East Africa.\n\nThis vector-ecology RVF does not preclude spread by other, though probably less significant routes, in the mentioned ecosystems - such as transhumance and international trade in infected, virus-amplifying animals, as well as short or longer distance windborne transmission of infected mosquitoes.\n\nWhile RVF has been initially identified in Kenya during an extensive event, affecting animals (sheep) and humans in 1930-31, the major epizootic in the East African region occurred in 1997-1998. This took place in the drier areas of northeast Kenya and southwest Somalia after heavy rains associated with El Ni\u00f1o. This caused human deaths as well as livestock losses, particularly of camels. Arguably more significant was the disruption to livestock exports from the Horn of Africa to the Middle East.\n\nThe most recent large outbreak of RVF in East Africa was in 2006-2007. On top of the most affected territories in Somalia, Kenya and Tanzania, the disease was reported from Sudan, Uganda and the islands Comoros and Madagascar. A WHO map showing the main regions and sites affected in 2006-7 is available at http://www.who.int/csr/don/RVF2007050.jpg.\n\nDespite forecasts and widespread disease in livestock, the 1st identification of the causative RVF virus, during the 2006-2007 epidemic, was achieved by diagnosing human cases. This underlined the need for improved surveillance in endemic countries. FAO has recently published an updated RVF manual (2018, at http://www.fao.org/3/i8475en/I8475EN.pdf). Notably, a similar situation has been seen during the current, evolving event, in Kenya, where the 1st identification of the virus was carried out in a hospitalized patient.\n\nRegional approach and internationally cooperated surveillance, prevention and control activities are conditional to effective handling of RVF. Hopefully, the activities to be undertaken by EAC will contribute to early control of the emerging outbreak, and - ideally - to the prevention of its further spread; in particular, to the exclusion of additional human cases.\n\nEAC is a regional intergovernmental organisation of 6 Partner States, comprising Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, South Sudan, Tanzania and Uganda, with its headquarters in Arusha, Tanzania.\n\nAccording to another media report, one of the measures to be undertaken is restriction of livestock movement within the EAC partner states (http://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/EAC-sends-alarm-over-rift-valley-fever/688334-4627180-3cr4ca/index.html). - Mod.AS\n\nUganda: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/97\nTanzania: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/200\nKenya: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/174\nRwanda: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/173\nSomalia: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/125\nSouth Sudan: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/8402]", "summary": "A ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n \n\nThis vector-ecology RVF does not preclude spread by other, though probably less significant routes, in the mentioned ecosystems - such as transhumance and international trade in infected, virus-amplifying animals, as well as short or longer distance windborne transmission of infected mosquitoes.

It's not because we can expect a full-blown epidemic right away, but cases now point to a very good chance of a serious outbreak in summer.'\n\n'The biggest mistake farmers can make is to be complacent in winter,' says Oberem.\n\nAlthough sheep are more at risk, cattle should also be vaccinated to prevent mosquitoes feeding on them from ingesting and then transmitting the virus. Oberem explains there are 2 types of Rift Valley fever vaccine, namely live and inactivated (or killed). The latter has to be used in animals that are or could be pregnant. Giving them the live vaccine would cause abortions or the birth of deformed lambs. The inactivated vaccine has to be given twice, unlike the live vaccine for which only one application is necessary.\n\nFarmers should be careful when handling the live vaccine so as to not accidentally infect themselves.\n\n'We have to control the disease while we have the opportunity to do so. I am pleased that the state veterinary services have assured me that they are taking the matter seriously and are agreeing that farmers have to be warned to vaccinate now. If not, we will pay the price in livestock deaths and maybe even human casualties,' says Oberem.\n\nAn outbreak is also likely to hurt the export industry. Countries in the Middle East have already banned South African lamb imports following the previous outbreak.

At least 10 people have been killed in Wajir and Siaya [counties].\n\nThe outbreak is suspected to be a result of heavy rains that caused flooding in semi-arid areas.\n\nThe World Health Organisation yesterday [21 Jun 2018] said Kitui, Wajir, Kajiado, and Marsabit counties are reporting high death rates and miscarriage among animals. But accurate reporting and investigations have been hampered by logistical challenges.\n\nWHO cited bad roads that have limited access to affected areas.\n\nThe outbreak has been reported in villages in Moyale while Balesa, Demo, Shuur, and Maikona in North Horr have also recorded cases.\n\nThe world health agency said the outbreak in animals often precedes human cases.\n\nAs such, the establishment of a surveillance system will provide early warning to veterinary and public health officials.\n\nWHO has recommended routine animal vaccination to prevent further outbreaks.\n\nHowever, the organisation discouraged vaccination campaigns, saying they may intensify transmission among herds through needle propagation of the virus.\n\n'Awareness of the risk factors of Rift Valley fever infection and measures to prevent mosquito bites is the only way to reduce human infection and deaths. Public health messages should focus on reducing the risk of animal-to-human transmission,' WHO said in a statement.\n\nAnimal-to-human transmission arises from consumption of raw or unpasteurised milk or infected meat.\n\nMosquito bites can be reduced through the implementation of vector control activities like insecticide spraying.\n\nThe UN agency advised against travel or trade restrictions to Kenya but said it was concerned by the high number of reported deaths and abortions in livestock.\n\nLast month [May 2018], the government through the Health ministry and the veterinary department issued an alert warning about the risk of RVF following heavy rains that caused serious flooding.\n\nHome slaughter of livestock without inspection by a veterinary [service] has been banned and livestock movement restricted after the outbreak was reported.\n\n[Byline: Susan Muhindi]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The title of the current media report, 'Improve RVF surveillance, Kenya urged', is striking.\n\nThe index case of RVF during the current event in Kenya was identified as an 18-year-old male who was admitted on 2 Jun 2018 at Wajir County Referral hospital (WCRH), presenting with fever in the previous 5 days and with a 3-day history of bleeding. He died in few hours. Following his diagnosis, several dozens clinical cases and at least 10 fatalities in humans, in several counties in Kenya's Eastern province, have been officially reported. Undoubtedly, this has been preceded by dissemination of the virus in susceptible, amplifying animals, within Kenya's RVF-endemic regions. Preparedness activities for RVF have, reportedly, been ongoing since February 2018 in reaction to the heavy rains and flooding; an alert was issued in May 2018 to all County Directors about a general national alert.\n\nThe 1st, 'immediate notification' of a suspected outbreak in animals was submitted on 8 Jun 2018. This addressed a farm in Wajir where 25 clinical cases, out of 250 susceptible camels, were suspected, of which 17 died. The ELISA test, applied in the Kenya's National Veterinary Laboratory on 6 Jun 2018, led to 'inconclusive' results and consequently the report indicated the 'nature of diagnosis' as 'suspicion'.\n\nIn Kenya's 1st follow-up report of 15 Jun 2018, 2 outbreaks, in Wajir and Tana River counties, the ELISA tests involved sheep and goats, and the results were positive, leading to the definition of the 'nature of diagnosis' as 'laboratory (basic)'.\n\nThe summary of Kenya's outbreak, as of 15 Jun 2018, follows:\n\nTotal outbreaks = 3 (submitted)\n\nSpecies / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered\nCamelidae / 530 / 27 / 17 / 0 / 0\nGoats / 456 / 7 / 0 / 0 / 0\nSheep / 500 / 9 / 0 / 0 / 0\n\nAdditional statistics and other details, and a map, are available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/temp/reports/en_fup_0000026928_20180618_142748.pdf.\n\nSince the lab test results of the camel samples were inconclusive, and in view of the unusually high case fatality recorded on this farm, compared to absence of deaths in the infected sheep and goats, further information on the event in camels, including clinical signs and post-mortem results, in case performed, will be of interest. The possible involvement of other potential disease agents, either as mix infections or otherwise, deserve to be excluded. One of diseases which may be taken into consideration is PPR (peste des petits ruminants), which has been reported from Kenya's Rift Valley in 2007 and has been continuing its spread since. PPR may, potentially, affect camels.\n\nFollowing the initial diagnosis of RVF in Kenya, in early June 2018, a Government's task force representing the human and animal sectors, was established in Kenya.\n\nThe measures implemented included:\n- On 14 Jun 2018, a multi-sectoral investigation team was deployed in Wajir county to support the county health teams. Another team will soon be dispatched to support the Marsabit county team.\n- Active surveillance in humans has been enhanced in the affected county, including active case search in humans (human surveillance in the community). All local health authorities in the country have been alerted to increase vigilance and enhance preparedness measures. In Wajir county, 5 treatment centers have been established.\n- Ring vaccination in livestock in affected areas is on-going.\n- The Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock has issued a ban on slaughtering animals for public consumption in Eldas and Wajir west sub-counties, and up scaling of food quality controls in the other 4 sub-counties through the public health officers, enforcement officers and veterinary officers.\n- Restrictions to livestock movement from the affected areas to all other parts of the county has been imposed.\n\nDuring a previous major RVF event in East Africa, In 2006/7, the epidemic affected Sudan, Somalia, Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Comoros, and Madagascar.\n\nSubscribers are referred to an updated (2015) RVF review, at http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/rift_valley_fever.pdf. - Mod.AS\n\nEffective reduction of vector mosquito populations over a wide geograhic area where rains and flooding have extensive breeding sites would be difficult and expensive to achieve.

It affects both humans and livestock and spreads through infected blood, milk or the bite of infected mosquitoes.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The concern of the Tanzanian public and animal health authorities about the potential appearance within their territory, of RVF -- which is currently circulating in their north-eastern and north western neighbors, Kenya and Rwanda respectively --, can be clearly perceived by visiting the map presenting the RVF-affected regions during the previous major RVF epidemic in eastern Africa. This event took place between February and May 2007, involving Tanzania, Kenya and Somali. The map is available at http://www.who.int/csr/don/RVF2007050.jpg.\n\nThe epidemiologic and clinical aspects of the 2007 event in Tanzania were addressed in Ref 1. The paper's abstract follows:\n\n'In January 2007, an outbreak of Rift Valley fever (RVF) was detected among humans in northern Tanzania districts. By the end of the outbreak in June 2007, 511 suspect RVF cases had been recorded from 10 of the 21 regions of Tanzania, with laboratory confirmation of 186 cases and another 123 probable cases. All confirmed RVF cases were located in the north-central and southern regions of the country, with an eventual fatality rate of 28.2 percent (n = 144). All suspected cases had fever; 89 percent had encephalopathy, 10 percent hemorrhage, and 3 percent retinopathy. A total of 169 (55 percent) of the 309 confirmed or probable cases were also positive for malaria as detected by peripheral blood smear. In a cohort of 20 RVF cases with known outcome that were also positive for human immunodeficiency virus, 15 (75 percent) died. Contact with sick animals and animal products, including blood, meat, and milk, were identified as major risk factors of acquiring RVF'.\n\nNotably, Tanzania's Ministry of Livestock has not mentioned mass vaccination among the preventive measures to be undertaken. This falls in line with the view expressed in FAO's recent RVF manual (Ref 2). the document says:\n\n'Mass vaccination in the face of an outbreak has never been successfully applied. This is because of the hyperacute nature of the outbreaks and the difficult environmental conditions often prevailing at onset. Without subsidized vaccine banks, the quantities available at the time of an outbreak -- whether predicted or not -- are often insufficient for mass vaccination. It has been estimated that the best-case scenario for procuring and positioning vaccines in the face of an expected epizootic episode, when vaccine production needs to be re-activated, is 147 days. This is prohibitively long, even if decision-makers were able to commit funds at the first indication of an early warning.\n\n'National experts suggest that targeted vaccination of critical populations believed to be involved in the initial amplification of the virus can pre-empt outbreaks, or has the potential to do so. Irrespective of the above considerations, it makes sense to focus vaccination on the hotspots for emergence (as indicated by risk maps). This approach warrants further consideration and piloting. (...) Protecting animals at hotspots would reduce the impact of the outbreak on the livelihoods of affected communities.'\n\nReferences\n1. Mohamed M, Mosha F, Mghamba J, et al.

The 1st patient was admitted to a hospital in Wajir County in northeastern Kenya on 2 Jun [2018] with fever, body weakness, and bleeding from the gums and mouth. The patient reported having consumed meat from a sick animal; the patient died the same day. On 4 Jun [2018], 2 relatives of the index patient were admitted. Blood samples were collected and sent to the Kenya Medical Research Institute, one of which was confirmed positive for Rift Valley fever on 6 Jun [2018].\n\nAs of 16 Jun [2018], a total of 26 human cases have been reported from Wajir (24 cases) and Marsabit (2 cases) counties, including 7 confirmed cases and 6 deaths (case fatality ratio (CFR) = 23 percent); 6 patients have been discharged, while one is still hospitalized. A high number of deaths and abortions among livestock, including camels and goats, has been reported in Garissa, Kadjiado, Kitui, Marsabit, Tana River, and Wajir counties. People living in these counties were reportedly consuming meat from dead and sick animals.\n\nPreparedness activities for Rift Valley fever have been ongoing since February 2018 in reaction to the heavy rains and flooding in Kenya. An alert was issued to all County Directors in February 2018 and a general national alert was communicated in May 2018.\n\nThe following actions have been taken since the outbreak was confirmed:\n- On 8 Jun [2018], the MoH and Ministry of Agriculture convened an emergency meeting with the Ministry of Livestock (MoL) and key stakeholders. A health sector task force meeting was held, and partners pledged their support to Rift Valley fever control.\n- On 14 Jun [2018], the MoH activated the Emergency Operations Centre, with an Event Manager and supporting technical team.\n- On 14 Jun [2018], a multi-sectoral investigation teams was deployed in Wajir County to support the county health teams. Another team will soon be dispatched to support the Marsabit County team.\n- As part of ongoing preparedness activities, active surveillance for Rift Valley fever is being strengthened in affected and at-risk counties, as well as contact tracing in Wajir and Marsabit counties. In Wajir County, 5 treatment centres have been established.\n- Active case searching and community sensitization activities are ongoing in the affected areas. Guidelines for vector control and other informational materials have been dispatched to Wajir County, and messages are being disseminated through Community Health Volunteers.\n- A ban on slaughtering animals and restriction of livestock movement has been imposed in the affected areas.\n\nOutbreaks of Rift Valley fever are not uncommon in Kenya. The last documented outbreak occurred from November 2014 through January 2015 in northeastern Kenya; in 2006, a large outbreak killed more than 150 people. The CFR has varied widely in documented outbreaks, but the overall CFR tends to be less than one percent.\n\nKenya's prior experience with responding to Rift Valley fever outbreaks combined with the preparedness activities undertaken over the preceding months is of benefit. However, the high number of reported deaths and abortions in livestock is concerning, especially because the event affects nomadic communities for which diet is predominantly based on animal products. The high volume of movement of cattle and people in this area increases the risk of further spread of the outbreak both within Kenya, and to neighbouring countries.\n\nRift Valley fever is a mosquito-borne viral zoonosis that primarily affects animals but also has the capacity to infect humans. The majority of human infections result from direct or indirect contact with the blood or organs of infected animals. Herders, farmers, slaughterhouse workers and veterinarians have an increased risk of infection. Awareness of the risk factors of Rift Valley fever infection and measures to prevent mosquito bites are the only ways to reduce human infection and deaths. Public health messages for risk reduction should focus on:\n\n- Reducing the risk of animal-to-human transmission resulting from unsafe animal husbandry and slaughtering practices. Practicing hand hygiene and wearing gloves and other personal protective equipment when handling sick animals or their tissues or when slaughtering animals is recommended.\n- Reducing the risk of animal-to-human transmission arising from the unsafe consumption of raw or unpasteurized milk or animal tissue. In endemic regions, all animal products should be thoroughly cooked before eating.\n- Reducing the risk of mosquito bites through the implementation of vector control activities (e.g. insecticide spraying and using larvicide to reduce mosquito breeding sites), use of insecticide-impregnated mosquito nets and repellents, and wearing light coloured clothing (long-sleeved shirts and trousers).\n- Restricting or banning the movement of livestock to reduce spread of the virus from infected to uninfected areas.\n- Routine animal vaccination is recommended to prevent Rift Valley fever outbreaks. Vaccination campaigns are not recommended during an outbreak as they may intensify transmission among the herd through needle propagation of the virus. Outbreaks of Rift Valley fever in animals precede human cases, thus the establishment of an active animal health surveillance system is essential to providing early warning for veterinary and public health authorities.\n\nWHO advises against the application of any travel or trade restrictions to the Kenya based on the current information available on this event.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The Kenya Ministries of Health and of Agriculture are working together in a One Health effort to reduce risk of Rift Valley fever (RVF) for humans and for animals in this outbreak. These ministries issued an alert for the risk of Rift Valley fever due to heavy rains and flooding and named 15 counties as high-risk areas (see Rift valley fever - Kenya: alert, prevention 20180531.5830703). The loss of camels and small ruminants has social and economic consequences for their owners. Where access to banks is limited, these animals become a store of value as well as a critical source of family income and food. It is difficult to predict how long the outbreak may last.\n\nThe rains and flooding have doubtless increased the populations of RVF virus mosquito vectors in the area. A vigorous vaccination campaign should reduce risk of infection for the animal populations. There is no commercially available vaccine for humans, so public education is the best way to influence behavior in ways to reduce risk of acquiring an infection. - Mod.TY\n\nKenya submitted its 1st follow-up report addressing RVF on 15 Jun 2018, adding the county Tana River to Wajir, where the initial RVF animal cases were identified in livestock (camels).

'We cannot exactly confirm the 2 deaths, but we have sent a team on the ground for confirmation since the area has low network connectivity and the victims died away from our facilities,' Mr Mohamed said.\n\nThe 1st 2 victims, both male, died on [4 Jun 2018] at the Wajir Referral Hospital.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), RVF is an acute, fever-causing viral disease most commonly observed in domesticated animals such as cattle, buffalo, sheep, goats, and camels, which has the ability to infect and cause illness in humans. The disease is caused by RVF virus (RVFV) and was first reported in livestock by veterinary officers in Kenya's Rift Valley in the early 1910s. The disease has been reported in Basir and Lakoley areas in Eldas sub-county.\n\nHundreds of livestock continue to die in the area due to the outbreak with camels and goats the most affected. In an earlier interview with the Nation, Mr Mohamed said that all the victims had shown symptoms of RVF but they had sent blood samples to the Kenya Medical Research Institute for further tests. The county health chief said the county will issue a detailed report on the suspected RVF outbreak on [Thu 7 Jun 2018].\n\nMedical personnel have already been deployed in the affected areas to treat victims and contain the disease.\n\n[byline: Bruhan Makong]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Interestingly, an alert was issued 2 weeks ago over the possible outbreak of RVF in parts of the country due to the ongoing rains. The alert from the ministries of health and agriculture named 15 counties as high-risk areas (see Rift valley fever - Kenya: alert, prevention 20180531.5830703).\n\nAccording to the director of veterinary services, Obadiah Njagi, there was increased risk of RVF due to increased cases of flooding. He noted that flooding not only caused displacement of people and animals but also increased the risk of diseases transmitted by mosquitoes such as RVF, a viral disease of livestock which also affects human beings if they get into contact with blood or tissues from infected animals,' he said.\n\nMod. AS noted in that post, 'Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a per-acute or acute zoonotic disease of domestic ruminants. The virus is confined to the African continent and Arabian Peninsula. It is caused by a single serotype of a mosquitoborne virus of the _Bunyaviridae_ family (genus _Phlebovirus_). The disease occurs in climatic conditions favouring the breeding of mosquito vectors and is characterised by abortion, neonatal mortality and liver damage. The disease is most severe in sheep, goats, and cattle. Older non-pregnant animals, although susceptible to infection, are more resistant to clinical disease. There is considerable variation in the susceptibility to RVF of animals of different species. Camels usually have an inapparent infection with RVF virus (RVFV), but sudden mortality, neonatal mortality, and abortion occur and abortion rates can be as high as in cattle.\n\n'Humans are susceptible to RVFV and are infected through contact with infected animal material (body fluids or tissues) or through bites from infected mosquitoes. RVFV has also caused serious infections in laboratory workers and must be handled with biosafety and biocontainment measures.\n\n'Rainfall facilitates mosquito eggs to hatch. Aedes mosquitoes acquire the virus from feeding on infected animals, and may potentially vertically transmit the virus, so that new generations of infected mosquitoes may hatch from their eggs. This provides a potential mechanism for maintaining the virus in nature, as the eggs of these mosquitoes may survive for periods of up to several years in dry conditions. Once livestock is infected, a wide variety of mosquito species may act as the vector for transmission of RVFV and can spread the disease.\n\n'Low level RVF activity may take place during inter-epizootic periods. RVF should be suspected when exceptional flooding and subsequent abundant mosquito populations are followed by the occurrence of abortions, together with fatal disease marked by necrosis and hemorrhages in the liver that particularly affect newborn lambs, kids and calves, potentially concurrent with the occurrence of an influenza-like illness in farm workers and people handling raw meat.\n\n'Parts of the above information and much more on RVF, its epidemiology, diagnosis, and prevention is available in Chapter 2.1.18 of OIE's Terrestrial Animal Health Manual, at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.01.18_RVF.pdf. - Mod.AS'\n\nHealthMap/ProMED-mail map of Wajir, Kenya: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/597. - Mod.TY]", "summary": "\n\n[byline: Bruhan Makong]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Interestingly, an alert was issued 2 weeks ago over the possible outbreak of RVF in parts of the country due to the ongoing rains.

Based on the epidemiological comments, 'the area has experienced rainfall above normal and increased mosquito population. Human cases have been reported in the region.'\n\nSimultaneously with the reporting of RVF in animals in Wajir (located in Kenya's former North Eastern Province, inhabited mainly by Somalis), the zoonotic virus has, according to the media, caused clinical disease in humans with 4 reported mortalities so far ( 20180609.5847216). Those should not surprise: an alert was issued by the Kenyan Government on 21 May 2018, 'for a possible outbreak of the deadly Rift Valley fever in the wake of prolonged rainfall.' The joint statement from the Ministries of Health and Agriculture identified 17 flood prone counties, among them Mombasa, Baringo, and Nairobi, to be at higher risk. According to the published alert, at that point in time no case of the zoonotic disease was yet identified in livestock or humans (see 20180531.5830703 and https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/health/article/2001281213/state-issues-alert-on-rift-valley-fever-outbreak).\n\nAccording to OIE's Terrestrial Manual, 'Camels have been regularly involved in the RVF epidemics in East Africa, Egypt, and more recently Mauritania. Clinical disease is usually not seen in adult camels, but sudden deaths, abortion and some early post-natal deaths have been observed.'\n\nAfter the initial identification of RVF virus as the cause of a significant disease in humans and sheep, in Kenya (1931), the disease was considered, during more than 30 following years, to affect, among domestic animals, 3 species: sheep (most susceptible), cattle and (least susceptible) goats.\n\nIn 1963, camels were added to the list, when infection was reported in them for the 1st time, during an RVF event in north eastern Kenya in 1962 (ref 1). The report said: 'Early in 1962 abortions in camels were reported. The camels were 6-8 months pregnant and there were no other signs of illness.' Serological investigations in 60 sera samples from 2 affected locations, Wajir (the site of the current event) and Marsabit (30 camels sampled in each), revealed that 27 camels (45 per cent) had neutralising antibodies for RVF. The incidence in camels from Wajir was 43 per cent. and in those from Marsabit 47 per cent. The authors stated: 'Virtually the whole of the 1962 crop of camel foals was lost, but whether the abortions were caused by RVF virus can never be known. Nevertheless, the similarities in the incidences in the various age groups suggest that a recent widespread epidemic had occurred in the Northern Frontier Province of Kenya and that the disease was not endemic.'\n\nLater, several events of RVF involving dromedary camels (East Africa, Mauritania) and alpacas (South Africa) confirmed clinical RVF in camelidae.\n\nFor a paper describing morbidity and mortality due to RVF in dromedary camels in Mauritania, with pictures presenting the observed clinical signs, see ref 2.\n\nOutbreaks of RVF are closely associated with periods of heavy rains and prolonged flooding, as those driven by the warm phase of the El Ni\u00f1o/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon, increasing habitat suitability for vector populations. In East Africa, RVF epidemics take place periodically every 10-15 years; the last major outbreak occurred in 2006-2007. RVF is more likely to affect small ruminants and cattle.\n\nReferences\n----------\n1. Scott GR, Coackley W, Roach RW, Cowdy NR. Rift Valley fever in camels. J Path Bact. 1963; 86 (1): 229-31.\n2.

Hundreds have survived the haemorrhagic disease that leaves victims bleeding from most parts of their bodies including the eyes, ears, nose and mouth. Blood is also passed through patients' faeces and urine.\n\nA week ago, Marsabit County residents were cautioned after the disease broke out in neighbouring Wajir. Those who died are said to have consumed infected meat. Samples of the meat were tested by veterinary officers and found to contain the RVF virus.\n\nAccording to County Director of Public Health Adano Kochi, RVF broke out in Marsabit in 2006. Other outbreaks were reported in 2016 and 2018. A total of 234 suspected cases have been discovered since the 1st outbreak, with about 13 deaths reported so far.\n\nThe outbreak has been blamed on prolonged rains leading to heavy flooding and stagnant waters, which create a conducive breeding environment for the _Aedes_ and _Culex_ mosquitoes, the main vectors for transmission of the disease. Human beings are infected through livestock when one comes in contact with body fluids or eats animal products like meat, milk and blood from sick animals.\n\nAbortion, mostly among sheep and camels, haemorrhage and fever are among the signs of RVF in animals. For the past 3 weeks, the county has experienced increased cases of abortion in camels, goats and sheep. A total of 14 camels died in Funanyatta and Bori in Moyale, while 12 camels aborted. There are reports of more cases in Badanrero, Amballo, Ittir, Kargi, Olturot, Loglogo, Korr and Laisamis. Residents in affected areas have been advised to feed only on inspected livestock products including meat, milk and blood.\n\nAccording to the county government, Moyale is hardest hit by the outbreak. In North Horr sub-county, North Horr, Balesa, Demo, Shuur and Maikona are the most affected.\n\nThe veterinary department this week rolled out plans to enhance surveillance, institute ring vaccination, increase public awareness, quarantine livestock, restrict home slaughter and close livestock markets to control the spread of RVF.\n\nThe department said prolonged heavy rainfall and increased vegetation had led to increased vector breeding, and urged residents to sleep under treated mosquito nets to avoid infections from the deadly mosquitoes.\n\nMarsabit County Director for Veterinary Services Boku Bodha said residents were at a higher risk than Mandera and Wajir locals because animals in small stocks were being ferried using all means of transport from Wajir and Mandera to the Moyale markets. 'Our main challenge now is to handle and control movement of livestock from the affected areas as already thousands are currently being transported from areas bordering Badanrero, Bute, Buna, Basir, Lakole, Rahmu, Daandu, Qofole and the wider Wajir and Mandera counties,' he said. 'Slaughtering of livestock en masse during the Idd celebrations likely posed a greater risk for residents.' Mr. Bodha added that the only animals not affected by RVF were poultry and donkeys.\n\nSpeaking to The Standard in Marsabit town after dispatching surveillance teams to the border sub-counties of North Horr, Laisamis and Moyale, County Chief Officer for Health Jaldesa Dima urged residents to be vigilant to help prevent the disease from spreading. He told pastoralists in Marsabit not to take their animals along the borders to minimise chances of their livestock being infected. In the last 2 weeks, 1800 head of cattle have been tested for the disease in the 3 border towns. On [Thu 14 Jun 2018], the county government resorted to provisional quarantine and ring vaccination of livestock to curb any spread of RVF. This came a day after a resident tested positive for the disease after an analysis by the Kenya Medical Research Institute in Nairobi.\n\nThe patient was one of 2 who were admitted to Marsabit County Referral Hospital a week ago. The county government admitted it had challenges handling the disease due to lack of sufficient field and laboratory equipment, and trained medical and public health practitioners.\n\nThe last major RVF outbreak was reported in 2006-2007, at the end of a prolonged rainy season. About 160 people died while the livestock sector lost about Sh4 billion [39 580 000 USD].\n\nAccording to Wajir County Veterinary Director George Kiprono, RVF was 1st identified in 1931 during an epidemic among sheep on a farm in the Rift Valley in Kenya.\n\n[Byline: Godfrey Ounduh and Kunow Abdullahi]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The Rift Valley fever (RVF) outbreak is continuing. The human death toll has gone from the 6 reported on 18 Jun 2018 to at least 13 now. Camels, sheep and goats are affected as well, with both deaths and abortions reported. The prolonged rains and flooding have provided breeding sites for RFV virus vector mosquitoes. The animal quarantine and ring vaccination may be helpful in halting spread of the virus but will have no effect on the vector mosquito population. With human and domestic animals affected by a virus transmitted by mosquitoes and direct animal to human transmission, an integrated one health approach is needed o deal with the situation holistically. The Kenya Ministries of Health and of Agriculture are working together in a One Health effort to reduce risk of Rift Valley fever (RVF) for humans and for animals in this outbreak. It is difficult to predict how long this outbreak may last. The domestic animal vaccination efforts will be a helpful preventive measure. - Mod.TY]\n\n[According to FAO's updated RVF manual (2018, at http://www.fao.org/3/i8475en/I8475EN.pdf): 'Mass vaccination in the face of an outbreak has never been successfully applied. This is because of the hyperacute nature of the outbreaks and the difficult environmental conditions often prevailing at onset. Without subsidized vaccine banks, the quantities available at the time of an outbreak -- whether predicted or not -- are often insufficient for mass vaccination. It has been estimated that the best-case scenario for procuring and positioning vaccines in the face of an expected epizootic episode, when vaccine production needs to be re-activated, is 147 days. This is prohibitively long, even if decision-makers were able to commit funds at the 1st indication of an early warning. National experts suggest that targeted vaccination of critical populations believed to be involved in the initial amplification of the virus can pre-empt outbreaks - or has the potential to do so. Irrespective of the above considerations, it makes sense to focus vaccination on the hotspots for emergence (as indicated by risk maps). This approach warrants further consideration and piloting (...) Protecting animals at hotspots would reduce the impact of the outbreak on the livelihoods of affected communities.' - Mod.AS\n\nMaps of Kenya: https://softkenya.com/kenya/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Counties-in-Kenya.jpg and of Wajir, Kenya: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/597]", "summary": "A ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n \n\nThe outbreak has been blamed on prolonged rains leading to heavy flooding and stagnant waters, which create a conducive breeding environment for the _Aedes_ and _Culex_ mosquitoes, the main vectors for transmission of the disease. \n\nThe department said prolonged heavy rainfall and increased vegetation had led to increased vector breeding, and urged residents to sleep under treated mosquito nets to avoid infections from the deadly mosquitoes.

The disease has also spread to the nearby Kirehe district [also in Eastern province], The New Times has learnt.\n\nRVF is an acute fever-causing viral disease that's commonly observed in domesticated animals such as cattle, sheep, goats, and camels. It can also attack wild animals such as buffaloes. The disease is caused by a virus transmitted by mosquitoes and blood feeding flies and mostly affects animals but it can also be transmitted to humans, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO). In humans, the disease ranges from a mild flu-like illness to severe haemorrhagic fever that can be deadly.\n\nNgoma district vice mayor for Finance and Economic Development, Jean-Marie Vianney Rwiririza, told The New Times on [Tue 5 Jun 2018] that 102 cows had died from the fatal disease, while 103 others have aborted since the disease was first reported in the district on [18 May 2018].\n\nWHO says RVF can cause significant economic losses due to high mortality rate among young animals and waves of abortions. The virus was first identified in 1931 among sheep on a farm in the Rift Valley of Kenya.\n\nThe vice mayor for Finance and Economic Planning of Kirehe, Jean-Damasc\u00e8ne Nsengiyumva, said that about 16 cows in the district had been successfully treated of the infection while 22 were still undergoing treatment. 'We are vaccinating cows which have not yet been infected and treating those infected,' Nsengiyumva told The New Times.\n\nA dairy farmer from Kirehe sector in Kirehe district, lost a cow to the disease just a day after it got infected. The cow, which he bought for Rwf 600 000 [about USD 700] in August 2015, he said, was producing 20 litres of milk a day and was helping him fend for his family. He says the cow's value had since increased to about Rwf 2 million [about USD 2330].\n\nOfficials at Rwanda Agriculture Board [RAB] say that RVF was first recorded in Rwanda in 2011 and the government started vaccinating cows against the disease in 2015. The vaccines are provided free of charge.\n\nDr Isidore Gafarasi, the director of veterinary services at RAB, said some districts did not vaccinate their cows against the viral disease fast enough, adding that both Ngoma and Kirehe districts had a target to inoculate 7500 cattle each. Under the Veterinary Delivery Services/ Livestock Development project, the government set aside some Rwf 500 million [about USD 583 000] for the current financial year (2017/18) for RVF vaccines for 127 793 cows in all of the country's 30 districts.\n\nA restriction has been imposed on cattle movement in the affected region to help contain the viral disease. Consumption of the affected meat is prohibited because the disease can be transmitted to humans.\n\n[byline: Emmanuel Ntirenganya]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The reporting of RVF cases in cattle may have contributed to the high alert of the public health authorities. Unfortunately, in most RVF events, humans serve as sentinels. Having said that, one may consider the possibility of mild or subclinical human cases escaping reporting since the start of the event in cattle, reportedly on 18 May 2018.\n\nAccording to Rwanda's reports to the OIE, RVF -- a notifiable, endemic animal disease in Rwanda -- is (2017 data) 'limited to one or more zones'. FAO's [The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations] recent suitability maps for RVF vector amplification indicate risk areas in the eastern parts of Rwanda.\n\nAccording to Rwanda's semi-annual reports to the OIE for 2017, during the months January-June, 321 730 vaccinations 'in response to outbreaks' were applied in animals; during July-December 2017, the number was 32 650.\n\nA detailed vaccination report to OIE is available for 2016, indicating the number of vaccine doses used: cattle: 127 000, goats: 75 700, sheep & goats (likely, mixed flocks): 56 750. It may be assumed that the vaccine used for the animal vaccination is live-attenuated.\n\nSubscribers are referred to FAO's recent publication on RVF Surveillance (Ref 1). On top of the crucial surveillance issue, the richly-referenced document includes updated information and guidelines on the RVF control and prevention measures in affected and threatened countries. Vaccination regimes in different epidemiological situations, are revisited by the author. All involved with the surveillance, control, and prevention of RVF, a significant human and animal-health threat, will gain from this timely publication.\n\nThe population of RVF-susceptible animals in Rwanda (OIE's 2016 data) is:\n- cattle: 1 214 244 in 374 000 establishments;\n- goats: 2 486 334 in 103 500 establishments;\n- sheep: 637 068 in 15 000 establishments;\n- camels: 12 (a single establishment).\n\nRVF is known to be currently circulating in 2 other East African countries, affecting animals and humans: earlier, South Sudan and, more recently, Kenya, where human cases have been suspected ( 20180609.5847216) and a serious outbreak in camels, officially reported on Fri 8 Jun 2018. The situation in other regional countries, in particular Uganda and Tanzania, is to be followed with caution.\n\nReference\n---------\n1. Mariner J. 2018. Rift Valley fever surveillance.

So far, it is the only farm reported to be affected and further investigations are being carried out by the local veterinary services.\n\nRift Valley fever is caused by a virus carried by mosquitoes. It affects cattle, sheep, and goats and causes abortions and deaths in especially young animals. Humans can be infected with Rift Valley fever if they come into contact with the blood and other body fluids of an infected animal or an aborted foetus. Care should be taken when handling possibly infected animals or carcasses of animals that have died of the disease. Symptoms in humans are flu-like and some individuals can develop more serious complications. If a person suspects that they might have been infected with Rift Valley fever, they must consult a doctor.\n\nThe reoccurrence of Rift Valley fever is due to increased rainfall, which in turn causes an increase in mosquitoes. As this outbreak occurred in the beginning of the winter season, it will probably be an isolated incident as the cold weather will result in a decrease in the number of mosquitoes and therefore decrease the risk the disease spreading. It must be noted that the risk will increase at the start of the summer season. This outbreak provides us with a useful warning that all cattle, sheep, and goats have to be vaccinated to ensure that the level of immunity in the herds is high when the next summer season starts and the risk increases.\n\nFarmers are therefore advised to vaccinate their animals against Rift Valley fever. Live vaccines can only be used in non-pregnant animals as the live vaccine can cause abortions. Only dead (inactivated) vaccines must be used in pregnant animals. Please take care when vaccines are administered after outbreaks have been detected; use a clean needle for each animal as the virus can be spread between animals if the animals are in the incubation period. Animals in the incubation period will have a virus infection but will not show symptoms of the disease yet.\n\nRift Valley fever is a notifiable animal disease, but not a controlled animal disease, meaning that there are no prescribed control measures. The State Veterinary Services will give support and information to farmers in affected areas, but it is the responsibility of the animal owners to vaccinate their animals and prevent losses. Suspicion of disease must be immediately reported to the nearest State Veterinarian.\n\nAll livestock farmers in South Africa are advised to vaccinate all their cattle, sheep, and goats yearly or at least once during weaning.' - Mod.CRD\n\nHealthMap/ProMED-mail map\nLetsemeng, Orange Free State, South Africa: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/53679]", "summary": "A ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n \n\nOutbreak statistics [rates apparent, in percentages]\nSpecies / Morbidity rate / Mortality rate / Case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*\nSheep / 41.67 / 41.67 / 100 / 41.67\n Date of previous occurrence: 30 Aug 2011\nManifestation of disease: clinical disease\nCausal agent: Rift Valley fever virus\n Total animals affected\nSpecies / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered\nSheep / 600 / 250 / 250 / 0 / 0\n 16 May 2018 from Dr Bothle Michael Modisane, Chief Director , Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, Animal Production and Health, Pretoria, South Africa\n\nSummary\nReport type: immediate notification\n Source: OIE, WAHID (World Animal Health Information Database), weekly disease information 2018; 31(20) [edited]\nhttp://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=26639\n\n\nRift Valley fever, South Africa\n Measures to be applied: vaccination in response to the outbreak(s), screening, quarantine\n\nDiagnostic test results\nLaboratory name and type: IDEXX Laboratories (private laboratory)\n *Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction, and/or slaughter\n\nEpidemiology\nSource of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: vectors\n Total outbreaks: 1\nOutbreak 1 (RVF_2018_001): Letsemeng, Free State\n Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n< This event pertains to a defined zone within the country\n\nNew outbreaks (1)\n [The location of the outbreak can be seen on the interactive map at the source URL above.]\n\n--\n promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The following comment is from a media release published by the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, Republic of South Africa on 16 May 2018, available at https://www.agrisa.co.za/rift-valley-fever-confirmed-in-fs/\n\n'Rift Valley fever has been confirmed at one farm in the Jacobsdal area in the Free State.

The alert from the ministries of Health and Agriculture named 15 counties as high-risk areas.\n\nThe notice was signed by Director of Veterinary Services Obadiah Njagi and his Health counterpart, Jackson Kioko. According to Dr. Njagi, there was increased risk of RVF due to increased cases of flooding. He noted that flooding not only caused displacement of people and animals but also increased the risk of diseases transmitted by mosquitoes such as RVF; 'a viral disease of livestock which also affects human beings if they get into contact with blood or tissues from infected animals,' he said.\n\nNjagi noted that certain groups, such as herders, slaughterhouse workers, farmers and veterinarians, were at higher risk of getting infected. 'The virus can be transmitted to humans through the handling of animal tissue during slaughtering, during births or while conducting veterinary procedures,' he said. He added that the last outbreak of the disease was recorded during the El Nino rains in 2006/2007, where around 160 people died and Sh4 billion [39 million USD] loss was recorded in the livestock sector.\n\nAnd Dr. Kioko called on the public to be cautious and stop slaughtering livestock at home without veterinary inspection. He advised the public to use protective gear while assisting livestock give birth or while removing stillbirths. He added that slaughtering or consuming food from sick or dead animals should be avoided and all suspicious deaths of livestock reported to relevant offices.\n\n'We are asking the public to use treated mosquito nets and repellants to keep away the insects that easily spread the virus mainly in flooded areas,' he said. Kioko further advised those who get a fever to report to the nearest health centre for treatment. 'To help in early detection and response in case of a disease outbreak, all reports of sudden deaths and abortions in livestock should be reported to the nearest veterinary offices for action,' he said.\n\n[Byline: Antony Gitonga]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a per-acute or acute zoonotic disease of domestic ruminants. The virus is confined to the African continent and Arabian Peninsula. It is caused by a single serotype of a mosquito-borne virus of the _Bunyaviridae_ family (genus _Phlebovirus_). The disease occurs in climatic conditions favouring the breeding of mosquito vectors and is characterised by abortion, neonatal mortality and liver damage. The disease is most severe in sheep, goats and cattle. Older non-pregnant animals, although susceptible to infection, are more resistant to clinical disease. There is considerable variation in the susceptibility to RVF of animals of different species. Camels usually have an inapparent infection with RVF virus (RVFV), but sudden mortality, neonatal mortality and abortion occur and abortion rates can be as high as in cattle.\n\nHumans are susceptible to RVFV and are infected through contact with infected animal material (body fluids or tissues) or through bites from infected mosquitoes. RVFV has also caused serious infections in laboratory workers and must be handled with biosafety and biocontainment measures.\n\nRainfall facilitates mosquito eggs to hatch. _Aedes_ mosquitoes acquire the virus from feeding on infected animals, and may potentially vertically transmit the virus, so that new generations of infected mosquitoes may hatch from their eggs. This provides a potential mechanism for maintaining the virus in nature, as the eggs of these mosquitoes may survive for periods of up to several years in dry conditions. Once livestock is infected, a wide variety of mosquito species may act as the vector for transmission of RVFV and can spread the disease.\n\nLow level RVF activity may take place during inter-epizootic periods. RVF should be suspected when exceptional flooding and subsequent abundant mosquito populations are followed by the occurrence of abortions, together with fatal disease marked by necrosis and hemorrhages in the liver that particularly affect newborn lambs, kids and calves, potentially concurrent with the occurrence of an influenza-like illness in farm workers and people handling raw meat.\n\nThe current wet season in East Africa has been characterized by heavy rains and flooding, which enhance suitable ecological conditions for RVF vectors' amplification, increasing the risk of RVF occurrence. Recent suitability maps for RVF vector amplification, produced by FAO, showed a suitability pattern very similar to the one observed during the period September 2006-December 2007, a period that was characterized by abnormal, heavy rains and flooding which were followed by a major epizootic and epidemic in the region (Kenya, Tanzania and Somali covered in ProMED-mail's posts presented in 'See Also' section below).\n\nRVF has been reported during recent months from Uganda, South Sudan and South Africa.\n\nIn Jan 2018, a single case in a Korean man residing in Gambia was diagnosed while he visited Senegal. The site of his exposure was not definitely established; Gambia is not regarded an RVF-endemic country, in difference with Senegal. The case was reported to the WHO (see 20180124.5582417). No increase of abortions or compatible signs of RVF in livestock have been reported by the Senegalese veterinary service during the investigations regarding this case.\n\nEarlier (in mid Sep 2017), FAO had issued an alert to raise awareness about the risk of RVF vector amplification in Senegal, Mali, Mauritania and Niger. This was based on the observation of persistent heavy rains and floods during the wet season. Non-endemic regional countries, such as Nigeria, Chad, Cote D'Ivoire and Ghana, also showed wide areas at risk due to long, persistent heavy rains.\n\nKenya's authorities call to farmers to vaccinate their livestock, in particular cattle, goats and sheep, deserves to be listened to and be followed by immediate action, in all regional countries currently under similar climatic conditions. This will not only prevent serious financial losses, but is expected to protect the health of owners, their family members and others involved.\n\nParts of the above information and much more on RVF, its epidemiology, diagnosis and prevention is available in Chapter 2.1.18 of OIE's Terrestrial Animal Health Manual, at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.01.18_RVF.pdf. - Mod.AS\n\nHealthMap/ProMED-mail map\nKenya: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/174]", "summary": "A ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n He noted that flooding not only caused displacement of people and animals but also increased the risk of diseases transmitted by mosquitoes such as RVF; 'a viral disease of livestock which also affects human beings if they get into contact with blood or tissues from infected animals,' he said. \n\nKenya's authorities call to farmers to vaccinate their livestock, in particular cattle, goats and sheep, deserves to be listened to and be followed by immediate action, in all regional countries currently under similar climatic conditions.

This follow-up report, created on 31 Mar 2018, notified continued absence of new animal cases since the initial, immediate notification to the OIE, dated 8 Mar 2018, when 8 cases in cattle were reported. The said notification included the following epidemiological comment: 'There were a few cases of abortion in cattle herds observed after heavy flooding in November 2017, when swampy areas formed and the number of mosquitoes increased. No mortalities in cattle have been reported. During the investigation clinical signs, consistent with Rift Valley fever, were observed' http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=26127. The '9 confirmed animal cases' included in the 12th weekly ReliefWeb report are, probably, not new.\n\nOIE's follow-up report 3 included the following final comment: 'The event cannot be considered resolved, but the situation is sufficiently stable. No more follow-up reports will be sent. Information about this disease will be included in the next 6-monthly reports'.\n\nUnfortunately, during the recent S. Sudan RVF event, as in most - if not all - previous RVF events in other African countries, humans served as sentinels. Improved surveillance in animals is desperately needed in Africa, to allow timely measures applied, predominantly preventive vaccination, before the development of a full-blown epizootic involving secondary infection in humans.\n\nThe initial WHO report on the S. Sudan RVF event ( 20180119.5568536) mentioned 'wild birds' among the affected animal species. It deserves to be noted that birds are known to be refractory to experimental infection with the RVF virus.. - Mod.AS\n\nHealthMap/ProMED-mail map:\nSouth Sudan: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/8402\n\nIt is fortunate that the RVF outbreak has ended, with no new reported cases in livestock. RVF-infected livestock can pose a significant risk to humans in contact with them, often livestock owners and veterinarians. Abortions in livestock with a loss in productivity present an economic problem for many ethnic groups that depend on them for livelihoods. In the absence of banks or similar institutions of financial support, livestock represent a kind of living bank account for their owners, in addition to a source of milk and meat. Apparently, this RVF outbreak did not result in an abortion storm that could have had serious economic, social and public health consequences. It is likely that RVF virus will persist in this area in transovarially infected eggs of _Aedes_ mosquito vectors. These eggs can remain viable for long period of time and hatch when flooded during future rain events, with subsequent emergence of infected females ready to transmit the virus. This risk provides justification for maintaining livestock of the area well vaccinated into the future. - Mod.

He said that the situation is putting Marsabit County residents at risk.\n\n'Mass slaughter of livestock during the Idd celebration is likely to pose a greater risk to the people. Luckily, RVF does not affect poultry, so our people can use chicken as a substitute,' said Mr Bodha.\n\nLivestock are mainly from areas bordering Badanrero, Bute, Buna, Basir, Lakole, Rahmu, Daandu, Qofole and wider Wajir and Mandera counties.\n\nMr Bodha said that in the past 3 weeks, the county has experienced increased cases of abortion in both camels and small stock as well as increased vector populations.\n\nHe added that 5 camels were found dead in Funanyatta while a farmer in Bori lost 5 of his 12 camels that aborted.\n\n'Abortion in livestock, haemorrhage and fever characterise RVF in animals. We have received reports of increased cases in other areas like Badanrero, Amballo, Ittir, Kargi, Olturot, Loglogo, Korr and Laisamis,' said Mr Bodhi. North Horr, Balesa, Demo, Shuur and Maikona are also affected.\n\nFollowing the crisis, the veterinary department plans to enhance surveillance, institute ring vaccination to control disease spread, increase public awareness, institute quarantine of livestock, restrict home slaughter, and close livestock markets.\n\n'Due to stagnant waters around homesteads and night enclosures, there is marked increase in population of mosquitoes and other biting flies, which have been a menace to livestock in the county,' said Mr Bodha.\n\n[Byline: Irene Mwenda]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[2] Human cases, livestock movement\nDate: Fri 15 Jun 2018\nSource: Star [edited]\nhttps://www.the-star.co.ke/news/2018/06/15/wajir-officials-arrest-five-traders-in-fight-against-rift-valley-fever_c1772912\n\n\nThe Wajir Health department has arrested 5 people for violating a ban on sale of livestock products to control the spread of Rift Valley fever.\n\nHealth executive Abdihakim Billow said 6 people have died from the disease. The latest victim succumbed yesterday [14 Jun 2018] at Wajir County Referral Hospital. The woman from Basir in Eldas subcounty was among the 1st patients admitted to the hospital. The number of those infected is now 19.\n\nBillow said the 5 will be charged with violating the ban.\n\nThe ban is being enforced by a joint team of public health officials, veterinary staff, and police.\n\nSpeaking to the press in Wajir town, Billow said new cases have been reported in Dasheg, Rabaqerany and in Diif, Wajir South. Most victims are admitted to Wajir County Referral Hospital and Eldas Subcounty Hospital.\n\nWajir county hospital CEO Ahmed Abdinur said nurses and doctors have been working round the clock to treat patients diagnosed with the disease.\n\nHe said his worry is the outbreak might get out of control. 'We are doing everything humanly possible to save the lives of the victims. As you know, it is highly contagious, and it requires a high level of handling. It is our hope and prayer that the number of victims will not increase,' Abdinur said.\n\nOn Wednesday [13 Jun 2018], the government asked Kenyans to avoid eating uninspected meat. Director of Medical Services Jackson Kioko and Veterinary Services director Obadiah Njagi called for immediate reporting of sudden deaths and abortions in livestock.\n\n[Byline: Stephen Astariko]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[3] Human death toll\nDate: Wed 13 Jun 2018\nSource: Star [edited]\nhttps://www.the-star.co.ke/news/2018/06/13/death-toll-from-rift-valley-fever-rises-to-six_c1772582\n\n\nThe death toll from Rift Valley Fever in Wajir has risen to 6 after one more person died while receiving treatment. At least 10 cases have been confirmed within the area.\n\nThe 1st case was reported on 4 Jun [2018] after 2 relatives were referred to a local hospital with high fever and bleeding from the mouth.\n\nOne of the patients died the same day of their admission, a situation that has seen the government create a task force in order to reduce new incidences and prevent more deaths. The team comprises members from both the national and county government.\n\nObadiah Njagi, director of veterinary services, warned locals against handling meat that has not been inspected.\n\n'To aid in early detection and response in the event of an outbreak, all reports of sudden deaths and abortions of livestock should be reported to the nearest veterinary office or any other office,' Njagi said in a statement on Wednesday [13 Jun 2018].\n\nHe added: 'It is highly advised that all persons who experience fever of unknown origin should also report to the nearest health facility immediately.'\n\nRift Valley fever is a viral disease that primarily affects animals but also has the capacity to infect humans.\n\nThe disease results in significant economic losses due to death and abortion among RVF-infected livestock, especially among camels and goats.\n\nSome of the symptoms [in humans] associated with the fever are high fever, bleeding gums, body weakness, among others.\n\nOn 13 Jun [2018], the government banned the consumption of meat that had not been inspected. Locals objected to the ban on grounds that they depend on their livestock to feed their family.\n\nAccording to WHO, the current outbreak has ecological and sub-regional geographical connotations. Livestock population movements are high in the sub-region, including cattle raiding activity between Uganda-Kenya-South Sudan.\n\n'The ongoing heavy rains and flooding in Kenya and other countries in East Africa have also resulted in increased vector density. These factors could contribute to further spread of the disease in the sub-region.'\n\n[Byline: Rhoda Odhiambo]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[4] Response to human cases\nDate: Wed 13 Jun 2018\nSource: Daily Nation [edited]\nhttps://www.nation.co.ke/counties/wajir/Rift-Valley-fever-kills-one-more-in-Wajir/3444790-4610378-lvkymrz/index.html\n\n\nOne more person has died of suspected Rift Valley fever (RVF) in Wajir, bringing death toll to 6 as panic grips the county.\n\nThe victim, who was receiving treatment at the Wajir Referral Hospital, succumbed to the disease on Tuesday night [12 Jun 2018].\n\nDr Adam Hassan, deputy head in charge of preventive and promotive health care services, said 19 cases have been reported since the outbreak. Basir area in Eldas is worst hit with 17 cases reported from the area.\n\nMr Hassan said that a majority of the cases have reported contact with meat, and most of them involved individuals who slaughtered and distributed meat.\n\nHe added that they have set up 4 isolation centres in Wajir Referral Hospital, Basir, Arbajahan, and Eldas health centres in an effort to control the spread of the disease.\n\nAccording to Harry Kimtai, Principal Secretary Livestock, the 200 000 doses [of vaccine for animals] will help curb the spread of the disease that has so far claimed the lives of 5 people in Wajir county.\n\nAlthough no case of RVF has been reported in Tana River, Mandera, and Garissa counties, a team of livestock experts from the ministry have also been sent to the ground to help in the vaccination exercise.\n\nMr Kimtai said the ministry has already sent an alert to 20 counties; Uasin Gishu, Trans Nzoia, Nakuru, Laikipia, Kajiado, Baringo, Wajir, Garissa, Marsabit, Meru, Machakos, Taita Taveta, Tana River, Mombasa, Kwale, Kilifi, Nyeri, Tharaka Nithi, Murang'a, and Kiambu to immediately commence animal vaccination and vector control.\n\n'We are asking all the county governments to start animal vaccination and cooperate with our team so that we can contain the spread of this disease,' he said.\n\nHowever, an enhanced surveillance system has identified 4 counties as potential hotspots. These are, Marsabit, Wajir, Kajiado and Kitui.\n\nThe PS noted that already the director of veterinary services has informed the county directors and offered technical advice on disease detection and response.\n\nAt the same time, the directorate has set up an RVF alert centre using a toll-free line 0800 721 433 for immediate disease notification and response.\n\nMr Kimtai said a joint multiagency RVF outbreak technical committee comprising public health and animal health experts has been set up to assess the risk situation and advise the government on mitigation measures.\n\nTo contain the spread of the disease in Wajir, he said that, already, medical supplies including laboratory equipment and personal protective equipment have been supplied to departments of human and animal health technical support.\n\nRift Valley fever is a mosquito-borne viral zoonosis, which periodically causes disease outbreaks in humans and livestock and is known to have been endemic in sub-Saharan Africa since 1912.\n\nPeople with RVF have either no symptoms or a mild illness associated with fever and liver abnormalities. Patients usually experience fever, generalized weakness, back pain, and dizziness at the onset of the illness, and weight loss.\n\nIn animals, sheep and cattle may have nasal discharge, excess salivation, and loss of appetite, weakness, or diarrhoea.\n\n[Byline: Boniface Mwaniki and Bruhan Makong]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[This Rift Valley fever (RVF) outbreak has both human and animal health consequences and reducing risk to both requires a One Health approach. The loss of camels and small ruminants has social and economic consequences for their owners. Where access to banks is limited, these animals become a store of value as well as a critical source of family income.\n\nThe Kenya ministries of health and agriculture issued an alert for the risk of Rift Valley fever due to heavy rains and flooding and named 15 counties as high-risk areas (see Rift valley fever - Kenya: alert, prevention 20180531.5830703). The director of veterinary services, Obadiah Njagi, said that there was increased risk of RVF due to increased cases of flooding. He noted that flooding not only caused displacement of people and animals but also increased the risk of diseases transmitted by mosquitoes such as RVF, a viral disease of livestock, which also affects human beings if they get into contact with blood or tissues from infected animals. As Mods. AS and CRD noted in the previous ProMED-mail post, outbreaks of RVF are closely associated with periods of heavy rains and prolonged flooding, as with those driven by the warm phase of the El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon, increasing habitat suitability for vector populations. In East Africa, RVF epidemics take place periodically every 10-15 years; the last major outbreak occurred in 2006-2007. RVF is more likely to affect small ruminants and cattle. Rainfall facilitates mosquito eggs to hatch. _Aedes_ mosquitoes acquire the virus from feeding on infected animals and may potentially vertically transmit the virus to their eggs so that new generations of infected mosquitoes may hatch from their eggs. This provides a potential mechanism for maintaining the virus in nature, as the eggs of these mosquitoes may survive for periods of up to several years in dry conditions. Once livestock is infected, a wide variety of mosquito species may act as the vector for transmission of RVFV and can spread the disease.\n\nThese moderator comments also provide some key references.

Of these, a total of 6 confirmed, 3 probable, and 12 suspect RVF cases (with pending laboratory results) have been reported. Of the suspected cases, 19 were considered as non-cases following negative laboratory results for RVF. The majority of suspected cases have been women (57.1 percent), and individuals aged 20-39 years make up the majority (72.2 percent) of cases.\n\n[Figure (map)] Geographical distribution of Rift Valley fever cases in South Sudan, 7 Dec 2017 - 9 Mar 2018\n\nIn week 10, 8 new suspected human cases were reported in Yirol East (5 cases) and Yirol West (3 cases). Samples have been collected from these cases, and 7 were shipped to the Uganda Virus Research Institute (UVRI) on 7 Mar 2018 for laboratory testing. As of 9 Mar 2018, there were no cases hospitalized. During the week, one human sample tested RVF IgG positive, bringing the cumulative number of confirmed RVF cases to 6 (one RVF IgM and IgG positive and 5 IgG-only positive).\n\nTest results from 21 animal samples (from livestock) that were shipped to South Africa were released during the week; 8 were RVF positive (3 IgM-positive and 5 IgG-positive), 6 samples were classified as suspect RVF cases based on IgG and IgM serological titres, and 7 samples were negative. Since the beginning of the outbreak, a total of 28 animal samples have been tested, with 9 classified as RVF positive (3 IgM and 6 IgG), 6 classified as suspected RVF (based on IgG and IgM serological titres), and 13 classified as RVF negative. Goats, sheep, and cattle in the area have shown evidence of zoonotic hemorrhagic illness, and abortions in livestock, disease in cattle, and wild bird die-offs have been reported.\n\nPublic Health Actions\n- In light of the confirmation of additional animal cases, a joint Ministry of Health and Ministry of Livestock and Fisheries press briefing is scheduled for 12 Mar 2018 to formally declare the outbreak in Yirol East county.\n- Investigation and response activities continue to be coordinated by a multi-sectoral task force that meets weekly at the national and sub-national (Yirol East) level.\n- On 6 Mar 2018, a high-level delegation led by the Minister of Health with participation of officials from the Ministry of Health, Ministry of Livestock and Fisheries, WHO, and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) visited Yirol East. The delegation was briefed on the outbreak and status of prevention and response activities in Yirol East and other counties at risk.\n- State rapid response teams continue to investigate all new suspected RVF cases and are supporting the collection of samples to enable confirmatory laboratory testing.\n- Surveillance for human and animal cases by community health workers and community animal health workers is ongoing.\n- Community mobilization, engagement, and sensitization activities are ongoing in Yirol East, Yirol West, and Awerial counties with support from the Yirol East county health department, the Eastern Lakes State Ministry of Health, UNICEF, and Community Health and Development Organization (CHADO).\n- The development of a multi-sectoral RVF preparedness and response framework is ongoing.\n\nSituation Interpretation\nThe RVF outbreak in South Sudan continues to evolve, and the detection of suspected cases in a Yirol West county and confirmation of additional animal cases underscores the need to strengthen RVF preparedness, surveillance, and response capacity in human and animal populations at risk. Support from the Ministry of Health and Ministry of Livestock and Fisheries, in collaboration with WHO, FAO, and partners will be needed to implement the necessary One Health interventions aimed at containing the disease in livestock and reducing the risk of animal to human RVF transmission. Extended human and animal health and entomological investigations into the event, and the nationalization of the multi-sectoral RVF preparedness and response framework are urgently needed to guide activities in this area. Technical support for the development of a long term RVF risk communication strategy is also needed, as such a strategy is a key component in reducing the risk of human RVF cases in this population.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[It is now clearly established that there is a Rift Valley fever outbreak in Eastern Lakes state involving both humans and livestock. The appearance of a new case in a different county (Yirol West) is unsettling. Addressing a new locality will complicate the surveillance and logistics of dealing with this outbreak. This outbreak now involves people and a variety of domestic animals. Fortunately, help is being provided to deal with this outbreak. A team of volunteers is working in close collaboration with the active case search team to engage the community and conduct risk communication. An understanding of the risks of handling infected animals is essential in avoiding more human cases, as is the avoidance of mosquito bites. A vaccine is available for animals, although there is no mention of animal vaccination in this or previous reports. - Mod.TY\n\nMaps of South Sudan: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b0/28_States_of_South_Sudan.png and http://healthmap.org/promed/p/53091.]", "summary": "Geographical distribution of Rift Valley fever cases in South Sudan, 7 Dec 2017 - 9 Mar 2018\n\nIn week 10, 8 new suspected human cases were reported in Yirol East (5 cases) and Yirol West (3 cases). \n\nTest results from 21 animal samples (from livestock) that were shipped to South Africa were released during the week; 8 were RVF positive (3 IgM-positive and 5 IgG-positive), 6 samples were classified as suspect RVF cases based on IgG and IgM serological titres, and 7 samples were negative.

The mission, comprised of representatives from the Ministry of Health, Ministry of Livestock and Fisheries, the World Health Organization (WHO), and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), visited Yirol East on 6 Mar 2018 to consolidate response efforts and solicit more commitments by all stakeholders to contain the outbreak.\n\nThe RVF outbreak was 1st suspected in December 2017 [Information on the human cases and their tests were included in earlier posts. - Mod.AS].\n\nFollowing the reported cases and deaths, the Ministry of Health and Ministry of Livestock and Fisheries, with support from WHO, FAO and other human and animal experts, launched a multi-sectoral response in the context of One Health for in-depth investigations to establish the exact cause of the reported deaths and illnesses in humans and animals.\n\nOne of the initial 7 animal samples tested at UVRI (Uganda Virus Research Institute) was positive for RVF. Furthermore, 8 out of 21 samples collected from animals tested positive for RVF at the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) reference laboratory in South Africa [Detailed test results of samples from animals, and a respective map, are available at https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/OEW10-39032018.pdf. - Mod.AS].\n\nA joint multi-sectoral contingency plan has been developed, which will be fully rolled out in Eastern Lakes to ensure RVF is contained. This will involve intensified surveillance in both humans and animals, risk communication, and case management.\n\nRVF is a viral zoonotic disease that primarily affects animals, but also has the capacity to infect humans. People are infected with RVF virus through contact with blood, body fluids, or tissues of RVF virus-infected animals, mainly livestock. This direct contact with infected animals can occur during slaughter or veterinary procedures, like assisting an animal giving birth. Less commonly, people can be infected with RVF virus from bites of infected mosquitoes and, rarely, from other biting insects that have the virus on their mouthparts. Spread from person to person has not been documented.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[As indicated above, the main source of human RVF are animals, primarily sheep, goats, cattle, and camels. Early detection of the disease in animals is pre-conditional for the protection of human health. Unfortunately, as in many previous events, humans, instead of animals, have played the role of sentinels during the earlier stages of the current event.\n\nDisease surveillance is the main pillar of early detection and response, which may include preventive vaccination of the susceptible animal population, the potential source of human disease. FAO, which works consistently with countries to improve RVF surveillance capacity, has recently published the manual 'Rift Valley Fever Surveillance,' tailored to the African conditions (80 pages; available at http://www.fao.org/3/i8475en/I8475EN.pdf).\n\nRVF is reportedly circulating at present also in Senegal (see commentary in archive no. 20180310.5678018). - Mod.AS\n\nMaps:\nSouth Sudan: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b0/28_States_of_South_Sudan.png\nEastern Lakes, South Sudan: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/63609]", "summary": "A ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n Following the reported cases and deaths, the Ministry of Health and Ministry of Livestock and Fisheries, with support from WHO, FAO and other human and animal experts, launched a multi-sectoral response in the context of One Health for in-depth investigations to establish the exact cause of the reported deaths and illnesses in humans and animals. \n\nDisease surveillance is the main pillar of early detection and response, which may include preventive vaccination of the susceptible animal population, the potential source of human disease.

See map at http://iomsouthsudan.org/tracking/sites/default/publicfiles/documents/Lakes_YirolEast_Atlas.pdf.\n\n'Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a peracute or acute, febrile, mosquito-borne, zoonotic disease caused by a virus of the family Bunyaviridae, genus Phlebovirus. It is usually present in epizootic form over large areas of a country following heavy rains and flooding and is characterised by high rates of abortion and neonatal mortality, primarily in sheep, goats, cattle and camels. The susceptibility of different species and breeds to RVF may vary considerably. Some animals may have inapparent infections, while others have severe clinical disease with mortality and abortion. Susceptible, older non-pregnant animals often do not show signs of disease.\n\nRVFV is endemic in many African countries and may involve several countries in the region at the same time or progressively expand geographically over the course of a few years. In addition to Africa, large outbreaks have been observed in the Arabian Peninsula and some Indian Ocean Islands. These generally, but not exclusively, follow the periodic cycles of unusually heavy rainfall, which may occur at intervals of several years, or the flooding of wide areas, favouring the proliferation of mosquitoes.\n\nRainfall facilitates mosquito eggs to hatch. _Aedes mosquitoes_ acquire the virus from feeding on infected animals, and may potentially vertically transmit the virus, so that new generations of infected mosquitoes may hatch from their eggs. This provides a potential mechanism for maintaining the virus in nature, as the eggs of these mosquitoes may survive for periods of up to several years in dry conditions. Once livestock is infected, a wide variety of mosquito species may act as the vector for transmission of RVFV and can spread the disease.' http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.01.18_RVF.pdf. - Mod.CRD\n\nHealthMap/ProMED-mail map:\nEastern Lakes, South Sudan: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/63609]", "summary": "A ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n \n\nOutbreak statistics [rates apparent, expressed as percentages]\nSpecies / Morbidity rate / Mortality rate / Case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*\n Measures to be applied: movement control inside the country; quarantine; control of vectors; vector surveillance\n\nDiagnostic test results\nLaboratory name and type: Onderstepoort Veterinary Institute, South Africa (OIE Reference Laboratory)\n Total outbreaks: 1\nDate of start of the outbreak: 11 Dec 2017\n Immediate notification\nDate of start of the event: 11 Dec 2017\n Total animals affected\nSpecies / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered\n Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)\nEpidemiological unit: Village\n Outbreak 1: Wunthou, Lakes\nSummary of outbreaks\n Sheep/goats / - / 0 / 0 / 0 / 0\n\nAffected population: There were a few cases of abortion in cattle herds observed after heavy flooding in November 2017, when swampy areas formed, and the number of mosquitoes increased.

On 21 Feb 2018, he vomited coffee grounds and frank blood, passed melena stools, lost consciousness, and died the same day. The case was positive for malaria by rapid diagnostic testing and a blood sample collected from the case was obtained for RVF testing. The deaths of goats and a cow have been reported in the neighborhood of the case.\n\nOverall, a total of 32 suspected RVF cases have been reported, including 5 confirmed cases (one of which was IgG and IgM positive and 4 which were IgG-only positive).\n\nOf 28 animal samples collected, one sample taken from a cow showed high RVF IgG titres indicative of previous RVF infection, 6 tested negative for RVF, and 21 samples are pending testing. Since the beginning of the outbreak, goats, sheep, and cattle in the area have shown evidence of zoonotic hemorrhagic illness and abortions in livestock, disease in cattle, and wild bird die-offs have been reported in the outbreak area.\n\nWHO says the suspected RVF outbreak in South Sudan continues to be closely monitored, and there is a continued need for support to strengthen national capacity for RVF preparedness, surveillance, and response.\n\nRift Valley fever is a mosquito-borne [viral disease] that is endemic in parts of Africa, including South Africa. It primarily infects animals like sheep, cattle, and goats and it can have an economic impact on a community due to the loss of livestock.\n\nHumans get infected through contact with infected animal blood or organs. Butchering and slaughtering of animals is a primary cause of transmission to humans. Certain occupations are at a higher risk of getting Rift Valley fever like farmers, herders, and veterinarians.\n\nIt can also be transmitted to humans through mosquito bites and the bites of blood-sucking flies.\n\nMost cases of Rift Valley fever are mild and symptoms include fever, headaches, and muscle pain. However, a small percentage of people can get serious disease, which includes retinitis, encephalitis, and a hemorrhagic fever. Fatalities happen in less than 1 percent of those infected.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[A recent release of information by the WHO also mentions the fatal human case and the seropositive cow. It also mentions that as of 24 Feb 2018, there were no cases hospitalized in Yirol East county (Eastern Lakes state). During the week, 8 human samples tested negative for Ebola, Marburg, Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever, RVF, and Sosuga viruses by PCR at the Uganda Viral Research Institute (UVRI). Serology testing of these samples for RVF is ongoing.\n\nOverall, a total of 32 suspected RVF cases have been reported, including 5 confirmed cases (one of which was IgG and IgM positive and 4 which were IgG-only positive), 3 probable cases who died, 12 suspected cases for whom complete laboratory results are pending (one of whom died), and 12 cases who were considered as non-cases following negative laboratory results for RVF. Excluding non-cases, the majority of suspected cases have been women (60 percent; 12/20), and individuals aged 20-39 years have comprised the majority (60 percent of cases (https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/OEW9-24022032018.pdf).\n\nThis outbreak now involves people and a variety of domestic animals. Fortunately, help is being provided to deal with this outbreak.

An understanding of the risks of handling infected animals is essential in avoiding more human cases. A vaccine is available for animals, although there is no mention of animal vaccination in this report.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, there have been undiagnosed cases of hemorrhagic disease in South Sudan several times before. In 2016, there was an outbreak of hemorrhagic disease. Unfortunately, despite the efforts of several reference laboratories, the etiological agent of that South Sudan hemorrhagic fever outbreak was not determined. In that outbreak, several possible viruses were discarded by laboratory tests (see Undiagnosed hemorrhagic illness - South Sudan (02): addtl. information 20160625.4309572).

Event\nOn Wed 7 Mar 2018, health officials warned of an ongoing outbreak of Rift Valley fever (RVF) in Eastern Lakes state [South Sudan]. According to local sources, 32 suspected cases of RVF and 4 associated deaths were reported in recent weeks.\n\nHealth officials are reportedly taking active measures to prevent a larger outbreak of the disease.\n\n2. Context\nRift Valley fever (RVF) is an animal-borne virus (_Phlebovirus_) of the Bunyaviridae family. RVF is usually transmitted to people through contact with blood, secretions, organs, or other bodily fluids of infected domesticated and livestock animals (cattle, buffalo, sheep, goats, camels, etc.). Transmission can also occur via mosquitoes and other insects. Symptoms include high fever, back pain, and dizziness. When untreated, RVF can lead to severe ocular disease, vision loss, encephalitis, hemorrhagic fever, and even death. There is no vaccine available, and treatment is mostly limited to supportive care.\n\n3. Advice\nIndividuals in in Eastern Lakes state are advised to take measures against ticks, such as by wearing covering clothing and using insect repellent. Avoid close contact with livestock animals or with infected individuals.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Earlier postings on the current RVF event in South Sudan addressed primarily the disease in humans, as noted since early 2018, before cases in animals became known. On 8 Mar 2018, South Sudan's national Veterinary Services reported to the OIE about 8 cases in cattle out of 2000 susceptible animals; the start of the event was given as 11 Dec 2017. Information on the affected population included the following details: 'There were a few cases of abortion in cattle herds observed after heavy flooding in November 2017, when swampy areas formed, and the number of mosquitoes increased. No mortalities in cattle have been reported. During the investigation, clinical signs consistent with Rift Valley fever were observed'. Please see the complete OIE report and commentary by Mod.CRD in archive no. 20180309.5675819.\n\nAccording to South Sudan's Ministry of Health's most recent RVF situation report (no. 8, published 16 Feb 2018; ref 1), human samples were submitted to Uganda's Virus Research Institute (UVRI) in Entebbe, where several were diagnosed positive for RVF. In addition, 21 samples collected from livestock were shipped to South Africa for laboratory testing. At the mentioned time of publication, their results were 'pending'. We will appreciate obtaining these results, in case available.\n\nFrom a reliable source we have noted that RVF virus is currently suspected to be circulating in the endemic area of Senegal, causing clinical cases in small ruminants. Confirmation and additional details will be appreciated. The last confirmed RVF outbreaks in animals in Senegal occurred in October 2013 in Dakar region; cases were recorded in goats, cattle, and Dorcas gazelles (see 20140318.2341029, 20131018.2008030, and 20130924.1964250).\n\nIn East Africa, particularly in Kenya, the epidemiological patterns of RVF are different from those described in West Africa, particularly in Senegal. In Kenya, several RVF outbreaks have been linked to prolonged heavy rainfall, whereas in Senegal, outbreaks usually occur during years of normal or poor rainfall. The main East African RVFV vectors are regarded to be _Aedes ochraceus_ and _Ae. mcintoshi_, while in West Africa the main vectors are _Ae. vexans arabiensis_, _Ae. ochraceus_, and _Culex poicilipes_. (For the said and additional entomological information from Senegal, see a recent paper -- ref 2).\n\nFAO issued an alert in mid-September 2017 to raise awareness about the risk of RVF vector amplification in Senegal, Mali, Mauritania, and Niger. Non-endemic countries, such as Nigeria, Chad, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, and Ghana, also showed wide areas at risk due to long, persistent heavy rains.\n\nAccording to FAO's 'Food Chain Crisis Early Warning Bulletin' no. 26, 2 zoonotic animal diseases were 'representing a high or moderate risk to the food chain for the period January to March 2018': avian influenza and Rift Valley fever.\n\nIn several African and particularly in Middle Eastern countries (Egypt, Saudi Arabia) prevention of RVF is applied by animal vaccination.\n\nSubscribers are referred to FAO's new manual on RVF surveillance (ref 3).\n\nReferences\n----------\n1.

At least 2 cases died of the fever in November 2017 [see ProMED-mail post Rift Valley fever - Uganda 20171126.5465725>].\n\n'Since August 2017, when suspected cases were reported, 5 cases of the RVF have been confirmed. Unfortunately, we have lost 3 cases of the RVF from Kiboga, Buikwe and Mityana districts,' said Aceng.\n\nThe minister said that a joint National Rapid Response team has been dispatched to the affected districts to handle the situation.\n\nRVF is a viral zoonosis that can also infect humans. Most human infections result from contact with the blood or organs of infected animals.\n\nThe disease can result in significant economic losses due to death and abortion among RVF-infected livestock.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Rift Valley fever virus is endemic in Uganda, and human cases occur there sporadically. The above report and the previous one in November 2017 make no mention of cases of Rift Valley fever (RVF) in domestic animals in the area where the human cases occurred. Farm animals are the main reservoirs and amplifiers of RVF virus.\n\nRVF outbreaks very often involve significant numbers of ill and dead small ruminant animals and abortions. It is odd that no small ruminant animal cases are mentioned, unless the animals had been vaccinated previously and are immune.\n\nRVF virus can persist for a long time in some areas, maintained in _Aedes_ vector mosquitoes that deposit eggs in seasonally-flooded areas, where those eggs are transovarially infected with the virus. Adult female mosquitoes coming from infected eggs can transmit the virus during their 1st blood meals. Eradicating the virus from these areas is not possible with current technology.\n\nAs Mod. AB noted: 'Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a major zoonotic disease caused by a virus of the genus _Phlebovirus_ of the family _Bunyaviridae_. The virus affects different animal species (buffaloes, camels, cattle, goats, and sheep) and can pass to humans either by direct contact through blood or body fluids during slaughter or ingestion of contaminated meat or indirectly through arthropod biting, especially by mosquitoes of the genus _Aedes_.'\n\nMaps of Uganda showing the districts mentioned above can be seen at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Districts_of_Uganda and http://healthmap.org/promed/p/11507. - Mod.TY]", "summary": "Communicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Rift Valley fever virus is endemic in Uganda, and human cases occur there sporadically.

These include 2 males and 4 females aged 7-60 years, and clustered in Wonthow payam, Yirol East county. There are currently no suspect cases on admission.\n- The number of alerts have continued to decline in the week with the last alert that met case definition being reported on 25 Jan 2018; 3 alerts were reported from 26 - 27 Jan 2018, but they all did not meet the case definition. From 28 Jan 2018 to date, there have been no new alerts from all the areas under surveillance.\n- However, reports of illness and death in Livestock are still rampant in the outbreak area where for example on 31 Jan 2018, the rapid response team witnessed 4 sick goats, one aborted and 2 had nose bleeding in Acigoor village close to the Thonabutkok village. The MLF/FAO team is conducting follow up investigations. Additional reports of animal deaths after short illness of 3-4 days in Pem cattle camp, Awerial county are also being investigated.\n- As of 2 Feb 2018, a total of 26 suspect RVF human cases have been reported in Eastern Lakes State. Out of the 26 suspect human cases reported since 7 Dec 2017, 3 human cases have been confirmed, 3 died and were classified as probable cases with epidemiological linkage to the 3 confirmed cases, 4 were classified as non-cases following negative laboratory results for RVF, and 16 are still classified suspect cases due to pending or partial laboratory sample testing.\n- During the week, 5 new samples were sent to Uganda Virus Research Institute (UVRI) for testing on 31 Jan 2018 and the test results are still pending.\n\nInitial reports on the event\n- On 28 Dec 2017, the Eastern Lakes Ministry of Health reported a suspect viral hemorrhagic fever cluster to the National Ministry of Health and WHO. The initial cluster involved 3 deaths in Thonabutkok village, Yali Payam, Yirol East county with 7 Dec 2017 as the earliest date of onset.\n- Preliminary investigations conducted by the County Health Department, State and National MoH, CUAMM, and WHO show that the 3 deaths had a severe hemorrhagic illness and were epidemiologically linked by place (Thonabutkok village) and time (with 49 and 51 as the respective epidemiological weeks of illness onset). However, there was no history of close physical contact between the cases and travel history was not significant. In addition, the symptoms were not reported in the respective close case contacts during the clinical illness or even after death.\n- There is significant history suggesting a zoonotic hemorrhagic illness as abortions in goats and sheep; deaths/disease in goats and cows; wild bird die-offs have been reported in association with this event cluster.\n\nBrief Case Clinical and Epidemiological Findings\n- The putative initial case was a 30-year-old female housewife from Thonabutkok village in Yirol East county. Her illness started on 7 Dec 2017 with fever, headache, neck pain and sudden nose, gum, and injection site bleeding. She reported to a health facility the same day where she was admitted in the maternity ward since she was pregnant. After 8 days of treatment with no improvement, she moved to a private clinic for 4 days where she was treated for malaria and typhoid fever. The illness worsened on 19 Dec 2017 and requested to return home. She died at home the same day. No supervised burial was done, and no symptomatic cases have been reported among the close contacts during the clinical illness and after death.\n- The 2nd case was a 13-year-old female from Thonabutkok village (approximately 150 meters from the putative initial case). Her illness started on 20 Dec 2017 with headache, joint pain, neck pain, fever, generalized swelling at the joints which were painful (ecchymosis), bleeding from the nose and gums. She died at home on 26 Dec 2017 after the she developed bleeding from the skin blisters. Goat and sheep abortions were reported in association with this case. No supervised burial was done, and no symptomatic cases have been reported among the close contacts during the clinical illness and after death.\n- The 3rd case was a 15-year-old male from Thonabutkok village. His illness started on 24 Dec 2017 with headache, fever, sweating, and neck pain, nose bleeding, vomiting of blood and gum bleeding, convulsions and loss of consciousness. He died at home on 27 Dec 2017 after failing to improve on treatment in a private clinic. in the case neighborhood, 8 goat deaths with extensive hemorrhage were reported (the goats were skinned, cooked and eaten). No supervised burial was done, and no symptomatic cases have been reported among the close contacts during the clinical illness and after death.\n- As of 2 Feb 2018, the cumulative number of suspect RVF cases had risen to a total of 26 suspect RVF cases including 3 deaths, all reported in Eastern Lakes State. Active surveillance is ongoing to detect, investigate, and initiate supportive care for new suspect cases.\n- The case fatality rate among suspect, probable and confirmed cases (excluding non-cases) is 13.64 percent (3/22). More cases have been reported among females 15 (68.1 percent) than males 7 (32.82 percent) (Figure 1).\n- Most of the cases have been reported in the 20-19-year age-group with most cases occurring the 10-19-year age-group in the males, while in the females, most cases are reported in the 0-9-year, 20-29-year, and 30-39-year age-groups (Figure 2). The deaths occurred in the 10-19-year and 30-39-year age-groups (Figure 3).\n- Figures 4 and 5 show the distribution of cases by time and outcome/epi-classification. The initial probable cases occurred between week 49-52, 2017. During weeks 3 and 4, an increase in suspect cases has been registered, though none have been confirmed.\n- Figure 6 shows the distribution of clinical symptoms among suspect, probable, and confirmed cases (excluding non-cases). The most frequent symptoms are non-specific and include fever, headache, neck pains, and joint pains. Bleeding has been reported in 82 percent of suspect cases but none of the confirmed cases had bleeding.\n- All the 22 probable, confirmed, and suspect cases (excluding the non-cases) have been reported from Yirol East county in Eastern Lakes state (Figure 7). In Yirol East county, cases have been reported from 5 payams with most 9 (40.90 percent) cases and all the 3 deaths reported from Yali payam.\n- All the probable and confirmed cases are clustered in Yali Payam, Thonabutkok village (Figures 8 and 9).\n\nResponse updates\nOverall coordination of investigation and response activities:\n- The overall coordination of investigation and response activities is currently coordinated by a multi-sectoral taskforce that is meeting weekly at the national level and sub-national (Yirol East) level.\n- The RVF taskforce meetings at the national and state level were held on 31 Jan 2018 and 1 Feb 2018, respectively. The Yirol East taskforce meeting was chaired by the Director General with the following partners in attendance WHO, UNICEF, FAO, CUAMM, LiveWell, HELP, CCOSS, and CHADO. The highlights of the meeting included:\n- The need to intensify animal health investigation and response interventions.\n- The arrival of the Ministry of Livestock and Fisheries/FAO team that will be in Yirol East for one week to conduct animal health investigations, train community animal health workers, and enhance community awareness to facilitate reporting animal cases and promote hygienic animal handling.\n- The Ministry of Health, WHO, and CUAMM are currently implementing active case surveillance and alert response.\n- There is need for logistical support (fuel) for the 3 vehicles donated by MOH to continue supporting activities. WHO and CUAMM have stepped in to provide fuel in the last weeks.\n- The draft contingency plan will be discussed in detail in the meeting next week once the animal health components are incorporated.\n\nSurveillance and case management\n- The surveillance, laboratory, entomology, and case management sub-committee meeting convened on 26 Jan 2018 in Juba to review the terms or reference, action, plan and surveillance guidelines including the case definition.\n- The WHO/MoH rapid response team is on the group to support the overall coordination, investigation, and response activities in Eastern Lakes state.\n- With support from WHO, The MoH has drafted health workers guidelines on RVF case surveillance, investigation, case management, and control. The draft guidelines have been disseminated for input by committee members and subject matter experts at the international level.\n- WHO supported 6 teams with a total of 25 community health workers that are conducting active case in the Yirol East. These community health workers have detected and reported alerts from Yali, Pagarua, Tinagau, Khap, Nyanga and Lekakudu payams in the last one week. In Yirol West, the team of 15 community health workers conducted active case search in Anuol and Aruau payams in the last one week. The team also conducted active case search in Aruau PHCU, Acigoor PHCU and Pagarau PHCU.\n- The Ministry of Livestock and Fisheries/FAO animal health team arrived in Yirol West on 31 Jan 2018 and participated in the Yirol East taskforce meeting of 1 Feb 2018.

Olaro said the National Rapid Response Team has been sent to support the district response structures to contain the outbreak.\n\nRVF is a viral zoonosis that can also infect humans.

On [29 Dec 2017], a blood sample taken from a 52-year-old Korean man, resident in the Gambia, done at the Institute Pasteur Dakar, was positive for RVF on IgM testing. Previous PCR testing had been negative for RVF and other arboviruses.\n\nThe case patient worked for a fishing company in the Gambia and had no known history of handling raw meat. On [5 Dec 2017], the case patient travelled with his brother and 2 colleagues from Banjul, the Gambia, to Ziguinchor, Senegal. On [8 Dec 2017], the case patient continued travelling with his brother, a colleague, and a driver, from Ziguinchor to Bissau, Guinea-Bissau, and continued to Buba the following day. On [10 Dec 2017], the case patient returned from Buba to Bissau, and presented with a dry cough, fever, headache, and joint pain. His brother and the driver also developed a dry cough on [10 Dec 2017], which improved the following day. The group returned to the Gambia (via Ziguinchor) on [12 Dec 2017]. The case patient, however, continued to suffer a persistent cough during this time. On his return to Banjul, he additionally developed fever, headache, and vertigo. He was hospitalized on [20 Dec 2017] and diagnosed with severe malaria. On [23 Dec 2017], he became delirious and developed psychomotor agitation, profuse mucousy diarrhoea, bile-stained vomiting, and haemorrhage. On [25 Dec 2017], he became comatose and was evacuated by ambulance to Dakar. His symptoms improved, and blood samples were taken on 26, 28, and 30 Dec 2017. However, he experienced a recurrence of haemorrhagic symptoms on 31 Dec 2017 and died the same day.\n\nPublic health actions\n\nA case investigation was conducted by a multidisciplinary team from the Centre of Health Emergency Operations of the Ministry of Health of Senegal. As part of this investigation, blood samples were collected from the brother of the case and the colleague and driver who accompanied him to Guinea-Bissau. These samples were all negative for RVFV by PCR. The results of the investigation and recommendations for action from the Ministry of Health of Senegal are pending. A case investigation was conducted by a multidisciplinary team from the Epidemic and Disease Control Unit of the Ministry Health of the Gambia. Enhanced RVF surveillance in the animal population and community RVF sensitization have been implemented in the country.\n\nSituation interpretation\n\nOutbreaks of RVF are uncommon in the Gambia and its neighbouring countries. The last documented human case of RVF in the Gambia was reported in 2002. There is currently no indication of risk of a major RVF outbreak in the Gambia, Senegal, or Guinea-Bissau. Heavy rainfall, causing flooding and mass emergence RVF vectors, _Aedes_ and _Culex spp._ mosquitoes, is closely associated with RVF outbreaks. Uncontrolled movement of livestock can increase the risk of spread of the disease to new areas. RVF can cause trade reductions and important economic losses due to high mortality and abortion rates among infected livestock. Integrated control measures that address both human and animal health are therefore necessary (e.g. preventive animal vaccination, vector control, control of animal movements, educational campaigns for populations at risk).\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-EAFR\n<promed-eafr@promedmail.org>\n\n[The case, who travelled in 3 different countries (The Gambia, Senegal, and Bissau) was diagnosed as being affected by malaria. Later, this person and people accompanying him exhibited symptoms that can be attributed to RVF. However, all of the other 3 tested negative, while the case was diagnosed RVF positive on IgM testing and negative on PCR. The situation needs some clarification, especially since it is not the flooding season in the region, which favors the multiplication of disease vector insects and thereby precipitates the appearance of RVF in animals with possible contamination of humans. - Mod.AB]\n\n[Rift Valley fever (RVF) virus can persist for a long time in some areas, maintained in _Aedes_ vector mosquitoes that deposit eggs in seasonally-flooded areas, where those eggs are transovarially infected with the virus.

She is from Arwa Village in Yirol West (not Yirol East like the suspect cases reported previously) and has no linkage with the cases reported previously. Sample was collected and shipped for testing.\n- During the week, one of the contacts, an 18-year-old; 7-month pregnant female in Thonabutkok village (village of initial case) and contact to the initial case developed symptoms on [9 Jan 2018]. The symptoms included chills, joint pains, headache, neck pains and 2 episodes of epistaxis. Updates on her status and sample collection to follow.\n- There have been no other alerts from the village or other neighbouring communities; surveillance has been heightened, and facilities have been urged to report any suspected cases.\n- During the week, a total of 7 human samples were collected and shipped to Uganda Virus Research Institute (UVRI) for testing: 6 samples were from close contacts (asymptomatic) and the 7th sample was obtained from the new suspect case in Yirol West (see above).\n- The 7 human samples initially tested negative on [10 Jan 2018] (by PCR) for Ebola, Marburg, CCHF, RVF and Sosuga viruses.\n- Follow up serological testing showed one sample had high RVF IgM and IgG and another 2 samples had high RVF IgG titres.\n- A total of 7 animal (2 sheep; 2 goat; and 3 cattle) samples have also been shipped to UVRI for testing but the test results are pending.\n\nInitial reports on the event\n- On [28 Dec 2017], the Eastern Lakes Ministry of Health reported a suspect viral hemorrhagic fever cluster to the National Ministry of Health and WHO. The initial cluster involved 3 deaths in Thonabutkok village, Yali Payam, Yirol East county with [7 Dec 2017] as the earliest date of onset.\n- Preliminary investigations conducted by the County Health Department, State and National MoH, CUAMM, and WHO show that the 3 deaths had a severe hemorrhagic illness and were epidemiologically linked by place (Thonabutkok village) and time (with 49 and 51 as the respective epidemiological weeks of illness onset). However, there was no history of close physical contact between the cases and travel history was not significant. In addition, the symptoms were not reported in the respective close case contacts during the clinical illness or even after death.\n- There is significant history suggesting a zoonotic hemorrhagic illness as abortions in goats and sheep; deaths/disease in goats and cows; wild bird die-offs have been reported in association with this event cluster.\n\nBrief clinical and epidemiological findings\n-------------------------------------------\n- The putative initial case was a 30-year-old female housewife from Thonabutkok village in Yirol East county. Her illness started on [7 Dec 2017] with fever, headache, neck pain and sudden nose, gum, and injection site bleeding. She reported to a health facility the same day where she was admitted in maternity ward since she was pregnant. After 8 days of treatment with no improvement, she moved to a private clinic for 4 days where she was treated for malaria and typhoid fever. The illness worsened on [19 Dec 2017] and requested to return home. She died at home the same day. No supervised burial was done and no symptomatic cases have been reported among the close contacts during the clinical illness and after death.\n- The 2nd case was a 13-year-old female from Thonabutkok village (approximately 150 meters from the putative initial case). Her illness started on [20 Dec 2017] with headache, joint pain, neck pain, fever, generalized swelling at the joints which were painful (ecchymosis), bleeding from the nose and gums.

The ruminant cases (sheep, goats and cattle) are also compatible with RVF. However, until the laboratory results are available, the RVF diagnosis should be made with some caution. There is always the possibility that more than one pathogen is circulating in this locality. However, the main hemorrhagic fever agents have been excluded in the 10 Jan 2018 laboratory tests. ProMED would appreciate receiving any further information about human or animal cases and the laboratory results of tests done on the 14 samples provided.\n\nThere have been undiagnosed cases of hemorrhagic disease in South Sudan several times before. In 2016, there was an outbreak of hemorrhagic disease. Unfortunately, despite the efforts of several reference laboratories, the etiological agent of that South Sudan hemorrhagic fever outbreak was not determined. In that outbreak, several possible viruses were discarded by laboratory tests (see Undiagnosed hemorrhagic illness - South Sudan (02): addtl. information 20160625.4309572). In 1999, an outbreak of hemorrhagic disease occurred in the southern part of Sudan due to infections with the bacterium _Borrelia recurrentis_, the cause of louse-borne relapsing fever.\n\nMaps of South Sudan: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b0/28_States_of_South_Sudan.png and http://healthmap.org/promed/p/53091. - Mod.TY]", "summary": "/FAO collaborating laboratories:\n- Human / 7\n- Animal / 7\n12 / Cumulative specimens (blood) collected:\n- Human / 07\n- Animal / 07\n13 / Number of cases with laboratory confirmation:\n- Human samples - PCR negative for Ebola, Marburg, CCHF, RVF, Sosuga / 7\n- Human samples - RVF serology - IgM and IgG positive (high titres) / 1\n- Human samples - RVF serology - IgG positive (high titres) / 2\n\nSituation update\n----------------\n- Dead goats (with bleeding into tissues) / 8\n- V.

[Epub ahead of print]\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nAbstract\n--------\nRift Valley fever (RVF) is a mosquito-borne disease caused by the Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV). Rift Valley fever affects a large number of species, including human, and has severe impact on public health and the economy, especially in African countries. The present study examined the vector competence of 3 different European mosquito species, _Culex pipiens_ (Linnaeus, 1758) form _molestus_ (Diptera: Culicidae), _Cx. pipiens_ hybrid form, and _Stegomyia albopicta_ (_Aedes albopictus_) (Skuse, 1894) (Diptera: Culicidae). Mosquitoes were artificially fed with blood containing RVFV. Infection, disseminated infection and transmission efficiency were evaluated. This is the 1st study to assess the transmission efficiency of European mosquito species using a virulent RVFV strain. The virus disseminated in _Cx. pipiens_ hybrid form and in _S. albopicta_. Moreover, infectious viral particles were isolated from saliva of both species, showing their RVFV transmission capacity. The presence of competent _Cx. pipiens_ and _S. albopicta_ in Spain indicates that an autochthonous outbreak of RVF may occur if the virus is introduced. These findings provide information that will help health authorities to set up efficient entomological surveillance and RVFV vector control programmes.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nShamsudeen Fagbo\n<oloungbo@yahoo.com>\n\n[RVFV can move outside the traditionally endemic sub-Saharan region and into other regions, as demonstrated in the past in Comoros Islands, Madagascar, Egypt, and the Arabian Peninsula. In addition to these regions, which are geographically adjacent to RVFV-endemic countries, in other more distant areas of the world the ecological infrastructure exists to allow RVFV to potentially thrive in vector, wildlife, livestock, and human hosts. The virus could be purposefully introduced into new areas as a tactic of bioterrorism, or moved accidentally via viremic mosquitoes (including infected mosquito eggs), humans, wildlife, or livestock along the extensive networks of global transportation, expanding the range of the virus to other continents. Humans, for instance, may develop RVFV viremia sufficient to infect naive mosquitoes. Laboratory studies have demonstrated that European as well as North American mosquito species of medical or veterinary importance can become infected with and transmit RVFV (see also Table 2 in ref 1 below).\n\nPrevention might best be exercised through vigilance and monitoring of RVF activity in endemic settings and increased vigilance for RVFV at high-risk locations in other continents that are connected to these endemic areas.\n\nAn extensive discussion of the issue can be found in a recent US-government sponsored review (1).\n\nReference\n---------\n1.

All 3 samples tested negative for all arboviruses included on the molecular panel, namely: dengue, West Nile, RVF, chikungunya, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, and Ebola. However, one sample was anti-RVF virus IgM positive on serology testing by ELISA.\n\nEarlier this month [July 2017], the district rapid response team was deployed to the affected village to conduct outbreak investigation. The team observed that the affected village is served by a large diameter well, with shepherds in seasonal movement with their livestock living nearby and regularly visiting the village.\n\nScore of samples were taken from villagers and domestic animals. Test results are pending.\n\nThe World Health Organization says the occurrence of a sporadic case of RVF in a village in Mali is not surprising.\n\nDuring August-November 2016, communities in the Tahoua Region, Niger (on the border with Mali) experienced an outbreak of RVF. And in January this year [2017], OIE confirmed RVF virus as the cause of abortions in sheep and goats across the border in Menaka, Mali (some 1700 km [1056 mi] from the abovementioned outbreaks).\n\nNevertheless, the detection of even a single case warrants an immediate emergency response, as such cases are often an early indication of widespread infection in livestock populations, associated with abortions with devastating economic impacts. Though the disease in humans is often subclinical or mild, 8 to 10 percent of cases develop severe symptoms, including ocular disease, encephalitis and/or haemorrhagic fever.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Rift Valley fever (RVF) is endemic in may sub-Saharan countries, including Mali. Cases occur sporadically in livestock and in humans. Mod.AS provided an excellent comment on RVF previously; 'Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a peracute or acute zoonotic disease of domestic ruminants. It is caused by a single serotype of a mosquito-borne virus of the _Bunyaviridae_ family (genus _Phlebovirus_). The disease occurs in climatic conditions favouring the breeding of mosquito vectors and is characterised [in some domestic animals] by abortion, neonatal mortality, and liver damage. The disease is most severe in sheep, goats and cattle. Older, non-pregnant animals, although susceptible to infection, are more resistant to clinical disease. There is considerable variation in the susceptibility to RVF of animals of different species. Camels usually have an inapparent infection with RVF virus (RVFV), but sudden mortality, neonatal mortality, and abortion occur, and abortion rates can be as high as in cattle.\n\n'Humans are susceptible to RVFV and are infected through contact with infected animal material (body fluids or tissues) or through bites from infected mosquitoes. RVFV has also caused serious infections in laboratory workers and must be handled with biosafety and biocontainment measures. It is recommended that laboratory workers be vaccinated if possible.\n\n'RVFV is endemic in many African countries and may involve several countries in the region at the same time or progressively expand geographically over the course of a few years. In addition to Africa, large outbreaks have been observed in the Arabian Peninsula and some Indian Ocean Islands. These generally, but not exclusively, follow the periodic cycles of unusually heavy rainfall, which may occur at intervals of several years, or the flooding of wide areas favouring the proliferation of mosquitoes.\n\n'Rainfall facilitates mosquito eggs to hatch. _Aedes_ mosquitoes acquire the virus from feeding on infected animals and may potentially vertically transmit the virus [transovarily] so that new generations of infected mosquitoes may hatch from their eggs. This provides a potential mechanism for maintaining the virus in nature, as the eggs of these mosquitoes may survive for periods of up to several years in dry conditions. Once livestock is infected, a wide variety of mosquito species may act as the vector for transmission of RVFV and can spread the disease.\n\n'Low level RVF activity may take place during inter-epizootic periods.

[Epub ahead of print]\n\nAbstract\n--------\nRift valley fever (RVF), a vector-borne zoonotic disease, is caused by a _phlebovirus_ (family _Bunyaviridae_). The virus was initially characterized approximately 80 years ago in Kenya and disseminated to many countries in the continental Africa, Saudi Arabia, and Yemen. The infection has not been reported in Turkey. In this study, blood serum samples collected from camel (_Camelus dromedairus_), goitered gazelle (_Gazella subgutturosa subgutturosa_), and buffaloes (_Bubalus bubalis linneaus_) from 2000 to 2006 were investigated for RVF using C-ELISA. Camel samples (n of 72) were obtained from private small enterprises in Ayd\u0131n province in the Aegean region. Gazella samples (82) were taken from the biggest captive gazelle herd in \u015eanl\u0131urfa province in the southeast Anatolia. Buffalo samples were collected mostly from small private family type farms in Afyon (168), Amasya (80), Samsun (69), Ankara (35), Sivas (21), Tokat (19), Konya (10), and Elaz\u0131g (8) provinces in the central, north, west, and east Anatolia. All of the gazella samples were negative; whereas, one of the 71 camel samples (1.3 percent) was positive for RVF-specific antibodies. Buffalos from Sivas, Tokat, Konya, and Elaz\u0131g provinces were negative. However, 35 of the 410 samples (8.5 percent) from rural areas in the following 4 provinces were positive: Amasya (12/80, 15 percent), Ankara (5/35, 14.2 percent), Samsun (8/69, 11.5 percent), and Afyon (10/168, 5.9 percent). To our knowledge, this is the first report of presence of RVF infection in Turkey.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a peracute or acute zoonotic disease of domestic ruminants. The virus is confined to the African continent and Arabian Peninsula. It is caused by a single serotype of a mosquito-borne virus of the _Bunyaviridae_ family (genus _Phlebovirus_). The disease occurs in climatic conditions favoring the breeding of mosquito vectors and is characterized, in the susceptible animal species, by abortion, neonatal mortality and liver damage. The disease is most severe in sheep, goats and cattle. Older non-pregnant animals, although susceptible to infection, are more resistant to clinical disease. There is considerable variation in the susceptibility to RVF of animals of different species. Camels usually have an unapparent infection with RVF virus (RVFV), but sudden mortality, neonatal mortality and abortion occurs and abortion rates can be as high as in cattle.\n\nHumans are susceptible to RVFV and are infected through contact with infected animal material (body fluids or tissues) or through bites from infected mosquitoes. RVFV has also caused serious infections in laboratory workers and must be handled with biosafety and biocontainment measures. It is recommended that laboratory workers be vaccinated if possible.\n\nUntil 1977, RVF was known to be limited to sub-Saharan Africa, mainly as an animal disease with zoonotic potential; in humans, it was mainly manifested as a self-limited febrile illness with the occasional complication of retinal lesions. During these years, the interest in the disease beyond Africa was practically limited to those engaged in potential biological warfare agents. In 1977, the disease was recorded, for the 1st time, in Egypt where it caused a major event with critical impact upon human health, continuing during 1978. The disease was associated with severe and fatal hemorrhagic fever and encephalitis. An official Egyptian report counted 598 deaths. Estimates of clinical cases from field workers exceeded 200 000 (Egypt's population at that time was 41 million). The animal industry suffered serious losses due to clinical disease, abortions, decreased production and deaths. Mortality was high in sheep and cattle; it was intermediate or low in buffaloes, camels and goats. The disease spread throughout many of Egypt's governorates, one of the heaviest affected being Sharqia, bordering the Suez canal.\n\nThe Egyptian event, which was signified by an unprecedented severity of the disease in humans combined with the spread of the virus into the Mediterranean basin, caused alarm elsewhere and attracted the attention of the international community and to its potential to spread further into receptive ecosystems. During the event, one seropositive goat was recorded in northern Sinai, some 60 km [approx. 36 mi] east of the Suez canal which divides Africa from Asia (Bir el-'Abd, map at http://tinyurl.com/y7j2v7xd). This animal was found not to be an endemic case since it had been transported from Sharqia. In 1979, 7 Swedish UN Emergency Forces soldiers serving in Egypt and the Sinai peninsula tested serologically positive to RVF virus. It was considered that they had contracted RVF while on duty in their posts in western Sinai, or while visiting Egypt. On the other hand, in 1979 RVF was diagnosed in Canada, in a 41-year-old Canadian woman who likely contracted the infection in Kenya; this case was cited as a potential exposure to Canadian livestock had she returned directly to her rural Canadian home.\n\nSince 1978, exacerbations of RVF have been reported several times from Egypt, Mass vaccination of ruminants have been applied there annually to the present day. In 2000, Yemen and Saudi Arabia became the first Asian countries infected by RVF, which most probably originated in East Africa. This was preceded by a major outbreak in East Africa which started in late 1997 and sickened some 90 000 people, of which almost 500 people died; animal herds were seriously affected. In March 2001, the accumulated number of human cases in Saudi Arabia was reported to be 882, of which 124 died. The disease re-emerged in Saudi Arabia in 2004 and 2010. No other countries outside Africa are known to have been infected so far; a reported suspicion of the disease in Iraq, 2001, remained unconfirmed.\n\nIn the discussion chapter of the current paper, which deals with samples collected in northern Turkey between 2000 and 2006, the authors suggest that RVF infection was introduced into Anatolia at the time of outbreaks in Saudi Arabia and Yemen, probably through Syria and Iraq via uncontrolled movement of animals and vectors. No clinical or suspected RVF cases, in humans or animals, have been reported from Turkey. The authors conclude that large scale serological and virological studies are necessary to determine the status of the infection to prevent possible dangers to Turkey and Europe.\n\nThis conclusion is compatible with several scientific assessments of RVF potential and epidemiological studies; some of them are presented in the following reference list.\n\nReferences\n----------\n1.

On 23 Sep [2016], human and animal specimens were tested at the Institut Pasteur de Dakar (IPD) and were reported positive for Rift Valley fever (RVF) virus by PCR and for specific IgM antibodies confirming the 1st outbreak of RVF in Niger. Initially the outbreak was centered in the north west of the country in areas bordering Mali, in particular around Tassara and Tchintabaraden in the Tahoua Region, however suspected cases of RVF have recently been identified in new areas to the north and south of Tchintabaraden.\n\nThe outbreak also coincided with the annual Cure Sal\u00e9e gathering in Ingall (close to Agadez), Tahoua region, where nomadic stockbreeders from Niger and surrounding countries gather with their animals. It is estimated that around 2 million cattle and smaller ruminants were in the affected area during the beginning of the outbreak. Furthermore, there were reports of waves of abortions and deaths among livestock in Boni-Bangou in Niger while human RVF suspected cases and animals were confirmed with specific IgM in the neighbouring region of Menaka in Mali.\n\nFrom 8 Aug to 21 Nov [2016], 266 suspected human cases including 32 deaths have been reported from Abalak, Keita, Madaoua, Tilia, Tassara, Tahoua department and Tchintabaraden in the Tahoua Region. From 8 Aug to 18 Nov [2016], 196 specimens were tested and 17 patients were confirmed positive by RVF PCR and/or serological identification of IgM antibodies. Further testing of RVF negative specimens is being performed at IPD.\n\nGiven that more than 90 per cent of the samples tested negative for a recent RVF infection (IgG, PCR negative) and the increasing proportion of housewives and children affected there is a need to broaden the investigation to identify possible other underlying cause(s). In this regard an adapted investigation protocol is currently being developed which includes infectious and non-infectious diseases as well as chemicals and toxins.\n\nPublic health response\n----------------------\n- Support has been provided by WHO to the Ministry of Health (MoH) in Niger for carrying out the initial investigation for confirmation of the outbreak and notification in accordance with the provision of the International Health Regulations.\n\n- A joint field mission of the MoH and Ministry of Livestock (MoL) was conducted to the affected areas during the 1st week of October [2016] to participate in the ongoing outbreak investigations, ensure prevention and control measures are being implemented and to begin community engagement regarding RVF.\n\n- Laboratory testing and training of personnel at Centre de Recherche M\u00e9dicale et Sanitaire (CERMES) was initiated by experts from IPD.\n\n- The Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN), with the support of partners has deployed laboratory experts from Institute Pasteur Dakar to enhance laboratory capacity in Niamey, Niger. Specifically, they tested specimens and trained 6 local experts on lab testing (serology).\n\n- Personnel have been deployed by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) Crisis Management Centre to participate in a joint field outbreak investigation, supporting the MoH and MoL, and in response activities.\n\n- Engagement of the regional AFR-EDPLN (WHO African Region-Emerging and Dangerous Pathogens Laboratory Network) has been initiated to support the enhancement of laboratory capacity in neighbouring countries.\n\n- Reinforcement and replenishing of laboratory reagents and supplies has been facilitated by WHO African region.\n\n- Provision of triple packaging for specimen transport has been facilitated by WHO African region.\n\n- A comprehensive outbreak investigation protocol is being developed by WHO country office with support from WHO headquarters and African region.\n\n- Funds are being mobilized to implement critical response activities in the areas of surveillance, laboratory, and risk communication entomology.\n\n- Engagement with nongovernmental organizations in the field (Alima/ l'ONG BEFEN/ Red Cross) who are assisting with case management and sensitization of communities is continuing also supported by UNICEF.\n\n- Deployed entomological experts from IPD in conjunction with MoH National entomologist conducted a comprehensive field investigation. Field specimens collected were all negative for RVF virus.\n\n- The deployment of additional personnel, by WHO African region and GOARN to support the MoH in implementing outbreak and response activities, specifically in the areas of epidemiological investigation surveillance and response, case management, risk communication and social mobilisation activities in the country is in process.\n\n- Considering the generalized signs and symptoms of RVF in the human population, suspected cases presenting to health facilities should also be tested for malaria by rapid diagnostic tests.\n\nWHO risk assessment\n-------------------\nSince October 2016, the epidemiological situation has evolved. Since August 2016, out of 196 specimens tested, only 17 patients have been confirmed with RVF, including 2 confirmed in November 2016 and 2 in October 2016. The epidemiological data are showing that the RVF outbreak amplitude is modest.\n\nThe spread of the RVF outbreak to previously unaffected areas should still be monitored as the health infrastructure is limited and the areas and populations dispersed along the stock routes.\n\nThe stockbreeder population is highly mobile and moves along stock routes to find pasture for their herds in the Sahel region that incorporates a number of neighbouring countries. The RVF outbreak caused concern and posed a serious public health threat in Niger as the health infrastructure is limited and populations are dispersed along the stock routes. Surrounding countries previously considered at risk including Mali, Burkina Faso, Nigeria, Chad, Benin, Togo and Cameroon have not reported any RVF cases.\n\nAlthough there is no indication at this point in time for an infectious disease which is easily spreading between humans there is a need to broaden the investigation to identify additional causing aetiologies as this would have an influence on the necessary response and control activities.\n\nWHO advice\n----------\nAny trade measures with regards to imports and exports of live animals from affected areas, or their products (meat or milk) should follow the 'Terrestrial Animal Health Code 2016' of the OIE.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The Rift Valley fever (RVF) outbreak continues in the Tahoua region.

As reported, this policy was based on the fact that RVF was considered to have become enzootic in Egypt (see ref 1). Notably, camels also have been vaccinated against RVF (see number in the above table).\n\nAccording to ref 1 and as discussed in postings 20120714.1201987 and 20120506.1124542, RVF vaccination in Egypt is being applied in cattle in combination with FMD vaccination. This is also apparent from the number of vaccinations against both diseases in 2015, which are of similar magnitude (see table above). Information on the reasoning of this combination, and particularly on the sort of the RVF vaccine applied - live attenuated ('Smithburn' vaccine) or inactivated - have been requested in previous postings on FMD vaccination (see in the 'see also' list of this post), and is pending.\n\nReferences\n1.

The area is mainly populated by nomadic stockbreeders.\n\nMost of the cases are male (62.5 percent), and work as farmers or animal breeders. In the affected area, an epizootic outbreak is also reported among livestock during the same time duration, including deaths and abortions among cattle and small ruminants.\n\nAs of 16 Sep 2016, 6 of the 13 human specimens tested at Institute Pasteur (IP), Dakar were positive for Rift Valley fever (RVF). Among the 6 animal specimens tested, 3 were positive for RVF. Sequencing and further laboratory testing is ongoing. Genetic sequence data is required to confirm or refute the endogenous origin of the outbreak. Moreover, laboratory support for Niger is being considered.\n\nPublic Health Response\nOn 31 Aug [2016], a multisectoral national rapid response team, including members from the Ministry of Health, veterinary services and Centre de Recherche M\u00e9dicale et Sanitaire (CERMES), and World Health Organization, was deployed for field investigation. Ministries of Health and Agriculture/Livestock have developed a national response plan.\n\nThe WHO Country Office continues to provide technical and financial support for surveillance, outbreak investigation, technical guidelines regarding case definition, case management, shipment of samples and risk communication.\n\nFAO, OIE, and WHO are coordinating on animal and human health and providing additional support to Niger for the outbreak response WHO is working with partners in the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) to coordinate international support for the response. IFRC and Unicef are supporting outbreak response.\n\nThe NGO ALIMA and the Nigerian NGO BEFEN are providing support for case management and social mobilisation on the ground.\n\nCurrently, in conjunction with the Ministry of Public Health, an entomological survey is being prepared for urgent implementation with WHO technical and financial support. This is to identify potential vectors for RVF in the region and it is considered to be in the definition of vector control activities.\n\nCurrently, some of the main challenges include under-detection of human cases. The risk that only severe cases are being detected and reported cannot be ruled out. There is no national local capacity to test the specimens. For laboratory confirmation for RVF, the samples are being shipped to WHO regional collaborating centres. Moreover, to ascertain the extent of this outbreak, the involvement of the national livestock department is required.\n\nWHO Risk Assessment\nBased on the available information, the event risk assessment is ongoing. The risk of further spread of outbreak within Niger and internationally (especially to neighbouring countries and those on the transhumance and migration routes) cannot be ruled out.\n\nNomadic stockbreeders from Niger and neighbouring countries have just participated in the Cure Sal\u00e9e festival, a major annual mass gathering event from 23-25 Sep [2016]. During this festival, herds are brought to graze on the salty pastures ahead of the dry season. Around 2 million cattle and even more small ruminants were expected to be part of the event.\n\nAt the end of the rainy season, as per known migration patterns, the nomadic human population along with their herds will progressively move to other Southern Sub Saharan countries and irrigation systems along the Niger river where pastures may still be available. In conjunction with the ongoing outbreak, the high density of animals in the area and the transhumance pattern significantly increases the risk of international spread. The security situation in the Sahel is unstable and also needs to be taken into consideration.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Previous reports of this Rift Valley fever (RVF) outbreak have made the number of human cases uncertain. The above report clarifies the case number and provides valuable social and economic elements important in this outbreak. Prompt response to contain this outbreak is essential, given the impending move of the nomadic population and their herds to southern Sub Saharan areas. No mention is made about plans to vaccinate animals before they move south. It would seem that a vaccination campaign in the region for RVF would not only address the livestock problem, but would reduce human risk of infection as well.\n\nMod.CRD's excellent earlier comment stated, 'Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a peracute or acute zoonotic disease of domestic ruminants.

In that era, South African workers documented fatal clinical RVF in a patient originating from Angola (1). The Chinese must be commended for rapidly considering RVF as a differential diagnosis.\n\nIt is not impossible that local transmission and infection, especially in humans, are missed in Angola if focus is on infections like dengue and yellow fever that have similar presentation with RVF. Furthermore, a possible lack of local diagnostic expertise used in the South African report may be contributory. Of note, evidence of local RVF endemicity in Nigeria has existed for years with extensive work having been carried out in the past at the virology lab in the University of Ibadan (2), but clinical cases remain unrecognized. An additional challenge in Nigeria may be malaria over-diagnosis. As regards animal reservoirs, though the issue of reservoir status of RVFV remains debatable, farm animals are more likely to play an amplifying rather than maintenance role. Ecologic and climatic factors influencing inter-epidemic maintenance should also be considered.\n\nReferences\n----------\n1. Gear JH: Clinical aspects of African viral hemorrhagic fevers.

The patient was immunosuppressed due to his renal transplant. IgM and IgG specific to RVF virus (RVFV) were detected in cerebrospinal fluid and blood up to 2 months after symptom onset, whereas in urine, RVFV genomic RNA was detected by RT-PCR up to 3 months, and in semen up to 4 months post symptom onset.\n\nConclusion\nWe report the 1st RVF viral RNA detection in urine and in human semen that did not have gross blood contamination. No information about infectivity could be determined as viral isolation failed. The RVFV was previously detected in cattle semen but not in humans. Infectious Ebola virus can be present in semen more than 3 months after recovery and is transmitted to other persons by sexual route. Similarly, Zika virus has been isolated from the semen of a patient 24 days post onset of symptoms. Ebola virus RNA was detected more than 9 months post-exposure. Duration of virus persistence in semen may be linked to the immunosuppressive status of a patient or a viral characteristic as for Ebola and Zika virus. As a precaution, we recommend to abstain or engage only in protected intercourse when RVFV is detected in semen, until complete clearance of the virus [occurs].\n\nRVFV genomic RNA was detected in semen 4 months after the onset of symptoms in an immunocompromised patient. Testing semen could be a new method for diagnosing RVF retrospectively and presence of RVFV genomic RNA raises the possibility that RVF could be transmitted sexually.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[This is an unusual case, in that the patient was immunosuppressed.

He did not report contact with ill or dead animals, nor mention spontaneous abortions in the small ruminants, which is common among RVF virus-infected animals. He did mention consumption of raw milk.

Similarly, Zika virus has been isolated from the semen of a patient 24 days post onset of symptoms. Infectious Ebola virus can be present in semen more than 3 months after recovery and is transmitted to other persons by sexual route. As a precaution, we recommend to abstain or engage only in protected intercourse when RVFV is detected in semen, until complete clearance of the virus [occurs]. It will be interesting to see if virus is present in urine and semen of infected individuals who are not immunocompromised. Ebola virus RNA was detected more than 9 months post-exposure. He did not report contact with ill or dead animals, nor mention spontaneous abortions in the small ruminants, which is common among RVF virus-infected animals. We report the 1st RVF viral RNA detection in urine and in human semen that did not have gross blood contamination. Testing semen could be a new method for diagnosing RVF retrospectively and presence of RVFV genomic RNA raises the possibility that RVF could be transmitted sexually. \n\nProMED-mail has posted only one previous instance of RVF in Mali, and that in livestock, and apparently the cases were not laboratory confirmed. \n\n--\n The RVFV was previously detected in cattle semen but not in humans.

Traditionally, RVF is known to cause a severe disease in ruminants, with mortality rates in juvenile ruminants, particularly lambs and kids, known to exceed 50 percent and in newborn animals even significantly higher. The main symptom in adult animals is abortion. Human disease follows the disease in animals by exposure to infected animal tissues such as aborted foeti, placentae, organs and blood, as well as by arthropod vectors transmitting the virus from the viraemic animals to human victims.\n\nAntibodies in humans were reported in Uganda in 1936. During the period 1944-1967, RVF virus was isolated from mosquitoes and humans. In 1968, a limited epidemic was reported in humans. A cross-sectional study published in 2013 reported serological evidence in goats in Sembabule, Mpigi, Masaka and Mubende districts of Uganda.\n\nSubscribers are referred to the commentary by Mod.MPP in posting 20160317.4099896. - Mod.AS\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/3948.]", "summary": "A ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n Measures applied: Movement control inside the country; screening; disinfection/disinfestation; traceability; dipping/spraying; quarantine; control of vectors; no vaccination; no treatment of affected animals\nMeasures to be applied: No other measures\n\nDiagnostic test results\nLaboratory name and type: Uganda Virus Research Institute Laboratory (national laboratory)\n Date of previous occurrence: 2007\nManifestation of disease: Clinical disease\nCausal agent: Rift Valley fever virus\n Immediate notification\nDate of start of the event: 15 Mar 2016\n Total animals affected\nSpecies / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered\n Total outbreaks: 1\nOutbreak Location: Kibaale [sic: Kabale district] (Kashenyi, Kicumbi, Kamuganguzi)\n Tests and results\nSpecies / Test / Test date / Result\nGoats / polymerase chain reaction (PCR) / Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n< Information received on [and dated] 1 Apr 2016 from Dr Nicholas Kauta, Director Animal Resources, Department of Livestock Health and Entomology, Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Industry and Fisheries, Entebbe, Uganda\n\nSummary\nReport type: This event pertains to a defined zone within the country\n\nNew outbreaks\n Species / Morbidity rate / Mortality rate / Case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*\n Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction and/or slaughter\n\nEpidemiology\n \n\nOutbreak statistics (rates apparent, expressed in percentages)\n Goats / 247 939 / 1 / 0 / 0 / 0\n Goats / 0.00 / 0.00 / 0.00 / 0.00\n \n\nControl measures\n", "reports": [{"diseases": ["unknown", "other", "rift valley fever"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2007-03-25 00:00:00", "2015-03-25 00:00:00", "1936-03-25 00:00:00", "2013-03-25 00:00:00", "1968-03-25 00:00:00", "2016-03-25 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Uganda", "country": "Uganda"}, {"location": "Masaka", "country": "Uganda"}, {"location": "Kabale", "country": "Uganda"}, {"location": "WAHID", "country": "Oman"}, {"location": "Mubende", "country": "Uganda"}, {"location": "Kicumbi", "country": "Uganda"}, {"location": "Rwanda", "country": "Rwanda"}, {"location": "Kashenyi", "country": "Uganda"}, {"location": "Kamuganguzi", "country": "Uganda"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "3694282", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Rift Valley fever - Mauritania: (TG)", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=3694282", "date": "2015-10-07 12:55:59", "main_text": "RIFT VALLEY FEVER - MAURITANIA: (TAGANT)\n****************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Sun 4 Oct 2015\nSource: Rapideinfo, Mauritanian News Agency (AMI) report [in French, trans.

The virus affects different animal species (buffaloes, camels, cattle, goats, and sheep) and can pass to humans either by direct contact through blood or body fluids during slaughter or ingestion of contaminated meat or indirectly through arthropod biting, especially by arthropods of the genus _Aedes_. RVF virus can persist for a long time in some areas, maintained in _Aedes_ vector mosquitoes that deposit eggs in seasonally-flooded areas, where those eggs are transovarially infected with the virus. \n\n'From the beginning, the assessment made by the government (of Mauritania), which ensures transparency, confirmed 8 deaths out of 25 suspected cases,' WHO representative in Nouakchott Jean-Pierre Baptiste, explained to the AFP. \n\nMr. Baptiste praised 'the strong mobilization of the government for the management of patients suspected of having Rift Valley fever in all affected regions.' \n\nRift Valley fever (RVF) outbreaks very often involve significant numbers of ill and dead small ruminant animals. \n\nIt is still not clear whether epidemiological investigations have been conducted in farm animals, which are the main reservoirs and amplifiers of RVF virus. \n\nThe Mauritanian government said that the central and southeast regions were mainly affected by the disease. \n\nRift Valley fever, named after the Kenyan region where it was identified in 1931, killed 17 people in Mauritania in 2012. \n\n--\n AB noted: 'Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a major zoonotic disease caused by a virus of the genus _Phlebovirus_ of the family _Bunyaviridae_.

The 4 reported outbreaks are, reportedly, located in 4 different provinces in the southern regions of Mauritania -- 1 outbreak per province (see map). It will be interesting to note if there have been additional outbreaks or the 4 mentioned flocks have been selectively tested, following the appearance of RVF cases in humans.\n\nThough the diagnosis of RVF in the affected animals was reportedly obtained by advanced laboratory tests, no further information is included (for example, name/location of the laboratory, species, date, test method applied, results). Such information is requested.\n\nRVF was initially reported from West Africa (Senegal and Mauritania) in 1987, following the opening of Diama Dam at the mouth of the Senegal River, in an area where the virus was, most probably, present earlier but not generally recognized. The dam project created additional breeding grounds for mosquitoes carrying the disease and resulted in more than 200 human deaths from RVF. It is regarded as endemic with flare-ups every several years.\n\nAccording to the most recent available annual report (2013) from Mauritania, RVF (in animals) is not officially notifiable in this country. It is 'present, limited to 1 or more zones'. No vaccination is applied. During 2013, 5 outbreaks were reported, affecting sheep and goats (mixed flocks; 190 cases out of 750 susceptible, no mortalities), sheep (90/300, no mortalities) and camels (11/100, 3 mortalities). Such mortality rates are rather low; in 2012, the figures were higher, accompanied by human infections including fatalities.\n\nThe disease's lethality rate is traditionally known to be particularly high in offspring (for example, in southern and east Africa, with death rates nearing 100 per cent in lambs and kids under the age of 4 weeks). It will be interesting to note if the affected flocks in Mauritania included young lambs/kids during the outbreaks. - Mods.

It has also been reported from Senegal and Mauritania in the western part of the African continent, as well as in the Arabian peninsula (see Nanyingi, M., Munyua, P., Kiama, S., Muchemi, G., Thumbi, S., Bitek, A., Bett, B., Muriithi, R., & Njenga, M. (2015). A systematic review of Rift Valley Fever epidemiology 1931-2014.

Given Uganda's location in the endemic zone of RVF, surveys were conducted on goat farms with a view to establishing presence of RVF virus and existence of its mosquito vectors. A total of 1470 sera were tested using the IgG ELISA and subsequently 700 sera tested using the Virus Neutralization Test (VNT) and a species identification survey for mosquitoes undertaken. The findings revealed an overall seroprevalence of anti-RVF virus IgG of 9.8 percent (95 percent CI, 8.5-11.1 percent). VNT revealed a seroprevalence of 24.3 percent (95 percent CI, 21.1-27.5 percent). The following specific farms had a higher likelihood to have seropositive goats: Lubega (OR 3.5 (1.1-11.3)), Katabarwa (OR 6.4 (2.0-20.5)) and Maduwa (OR 5.3 (1.6-16.7)). Mubende goats were 4 times (OR 4.2 (1.3-13.5)) more likely to be seropositive to RVF virus than Boer goats, and adult goats were 2 times (OR 2.2 (1.5-3.3)) more likely to be seropositive to RVF virus than young ones. Mosquito species found, included, _Anopheles gambiae_ (71.2 percent), _Culex_ sp. (21.5 percent), _Anopheles funestus_ (6.5 percent), _Aedes_ sp. (0.7 percent) and _Mansonia_ sp. (0.2 percent). High prevalence of anti-RVFV IgG in goats in some locations together with presence of RVF virus neutralizing antibodies (up to 1:80) suggested that the RVF virus is endemic in goats in Uganda. Presence of RVF virus coupled with existence of Aedes sp. and Culex sp. mosquito vectors are likely to lead to RVF outbreaks once the mosquito population flares-up due to flooding and increased RVF virus amplification occurs.' (Magona JW, Galiwango T, Walubengo J, Mukiibi G.

Small Ruminant Research. 2013;114(1):176-181.)\n\nInterestingly, the one prior report of suspected RVF in Uganda published on ProMED-mail (alas, which was never confirmed) mentions that it was a year that 'Uganda is experiencing a serious blood shortage as a result of El Ni\u00f1o-induced epidemics of malaria and other fevers that have spread to all areas of the country since last November [1997].'\n\nOftentimes outbreaks of RVF in humans have served as sentinel events alerting the livestock personnel of ongoing outbreaks in livestock. It appears as though this may be the case in this current outbreak in Uganda.\n\nMore information on the findings of investigations of this outbreak in both humans as well as livestock in Uganda would be greatly appreciated.\n\nNote that the previous posting on Rift Valley fever in Uganda mentioned the cases were from Kibaale District, whereas these newly confirmed cases are from Kabale district.

It is characterized by high mortality rates in young animals and abortions in pregnant ruminants. RVF is endemic in sub-Saharan Africa. Epidemics occur in this region when heavy rainfalls cause infected mosquito eggs to hatch, and large numbers of susceptible animals are present.\n\nRVF epizootics are often accompanied by human disease. Many human cases are caused by occupational exposure to blood and tissues from infected animals, but mosquito-borne transmission can cause epidemics. The most common form of the disease is a self-limiting, flu-like illness; however, ocular disease and rare cases of fatal hemorrhagic fever also occur.\n\nThe media report above is based upon Senegal's follow-up report no. 2 addressing this epizootic, dated 14 Mar 2014, available, with an interactive map, at http://tinyurl.com/oqcf5uc. According to this OIE report, the outbreak in cattle had started 10 Oct 2013; thus, this is a belated reporting of an event which had taken place about 5 months ago. It involved 7 cases of RVF recorded within a herd of 190 susceptible cattle; no deaths reported. For the diagnosis, reportedly performed on 10 Oct 2013 by Senegal's National Livestock and Veterinary Research Laboratory, real-time reverse transcriptase/polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR) was applied. The report included the following epidemiological comment: 'The rainy winter season is the period at risk favourable to the proliferation of vectors transmitting Rift Valley fever.'\n\nThe same epizootic included 3 earlier RVF outbreaks, as follows:\n\n1. The 1st outbreak, which started 10 Sep 2013, involved Dorcas gazelles (_Gazella dorcas_) in north-west Senegal. The immediate notification, with a map, is available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?reportid=14138. It included the following epidemiological comment: 'Rift Valley fever is a vector-borne disease.

Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.\n\nThe location of the outbreak can be seen on the interactive map included in the OIE report at the source URL above.\n\nSenegal\n-------\nDuring September 2013, Senegal reported the reoccurrence of the disease to the OIE (ProMED archive number 20130924.1964250). Two new outbreaks were reported in the latest follow-up report (10 Oct 2013). These outbreaks were situated in the Saint Louis region, and the total number of affected animals were 208 goats (37 cases, 8 deaths). The complete details on these latest outbreaks in Senegal are available at: http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=14211\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a peracute or acute zoonotic disease of domestic ruminants in Africa. It is caused by a single serotype of a mosquito-borne bunyavirus of the genus Phlebovirus. The disease occurs in climatic conditions favouring the breeding of mosquito vectors and is characterised by liver damage. The disease is most severe in sheep, goats and cattle, in which it produces abortions in pregnant animals and a high mortality rate in the newborn.\n\nFor additional background information, including diagnostic methods and references, please refer to the OIE Terrestrial Manual 2013, Chapter 2.1.14 'Rift Valley Fever' at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.01.14_RVF.pdf\n\nHumans usually get RVF through bites from infected mosquitoes and possibly other biting insects that have virus-contaminated mouthparts. Humans can also get the disease if they are exposed to the blood, body fluids, or tissues of infected animals. Direct exposure to infected animals can occur during slaughter or through veterinary and obstetric procedures. Infection through aerosol transmission of RVF virus has occurred in the laboratory.\n\nRVF virus can cause several different disease syndromes. People with RVF typically have either no symptoms or a mild illness associated with fever and liver abnormalities. However, in some patients the illness can progress to hemorrhagic fever (which can lead to shock or hemorrhage), encephalitis (inflammation of the brain, which can lead to headaches, coma, or seizures), or ocular disease (diseases affecting the eye). Patients who become ill usually experience fever, generalized weakness, back pain, dizziness, and extreme weight loss at the onset of the illness. Typically, patients recover within two days to one week after onset of illness. http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvrd/spb/mnpages/dispages/rvf/rvf_qa.htm\n\nCommunication regarding disease risk and awareness campaigns on risk mitigation is essential in protecting humans from RVF infections by limiting exposure to the RVF virus for populations at risk, such as farmers, veterinarians and slaughterhouse workers. A communication strategy, jointly prepared by the animal and human health authorities, will increase the chances of decreasing the population's risk of exposure to the RVF virus and subsequent disease, as well as increasing consumer confidence and avoiding miscommunication on food safety concerns. http://www.fao.org/docrep/017/ap392e/ap392e.pdf\n\nIn 2010 Mauritania sent an immediate notification to the OIE reporting 3 outbreaks on RFV which occurred in the northern desert region of Adrar. This event was resolved on 28 Feb 2011. Details on these outbreaks and the interactive map are available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=10054\n\nPictures of RVF clinical signs in camels affected in a 2010 outbreak can be seen at, http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/17/10/11-0397-f2.htm\n\nThe most current official information from Mauritania can be found in its 2nd OIE 6-monthly report for 2012. In October 2012, 3 outbreaks of RVF were reported. These were located in the Magta-Lahjar region and the affected species were camelidae (640 susceptible, 78 cases), and sheep and goats (540000 susceptible, 1120 cases, 56 deaths). http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Diseaseinformation/statusdetail\n(Note: to view the information on RVF, you need to scroll down to the name of the disease, country and time period).\n\nIn early September 2012, a human case of RVF was reported in Mauritania. By 30 October 2012, a total of 6 regions were affected with 34 human cases of RVF, including 17 deaths. Only the southern regions of Mauritania, those closest to the usual enzootic areas along the Senegal River, seem to have been involved in this event. See http://www.fao.org/docrep/017/ap392e/ap392e.pdf and ProMed archive number: 20121102.1387490.\n\nThe distribution in animals and humans from 2002 to 2012 can be found in the article on Rift Valley Fever- Vol 27, December 2012 - published by Emergency prevention systems (EMPRES WATCH), FAO. http://www.fao.org/docrep/017/ap392e/ap392e.pdf\n\nIn this latest immediate notification, the reported absence of [livestock] mortality is surprising. RVF is a serious disease in small ruminants, mortality - especially in lambs and, to a somewhat lower rate in kids, is known to be common. This phenomenon may be seen provided the flocks include young animals. In other seasons, older animals may suffer waves of abortions.\n\nIn the most current 'Outbreak Bulletin' provided from WHO African region (January to July 2013), no outbreaks of RVF were reported. http://www.afro.who.int/en/clusters-a-programmes/dpc/epidemic-a-pandemic-alert-and-response/outbreak-news.html -

They are separated by inter-epidemic periods that may last for several decades in arid areas, and, during these periods, the prevalence of infection in humans, animals, and mosquitoes can be difficult to detect. In the absence of clinical disease, the RVF status of a country or zone within the historically infected regions of the world should be determined by a surveillance programme focusing on mosquitoes and serology of susceptible mammals. The programme should concentrate on parts of the country or zone at high risk because of historical, geographic and climatic factors, ruminant and mosquito population distribution, and proximity to areas where epidemics have recently occurred http://www.oie.int/index.php?id=169&L=0&htmfile=chapitre_1.8.12.htm.\n\nRVF is a zoonosis (a disease which primarily affects animals but causes disease in humans). Humans are highly susceptible to the RVF virus and may become infected with RVF by being bitten by infected mosquitoes, through contact with blood, other body fluids, or tissues during killing, skinning and cutting of infected animals, or by consumption of raw milk or uncooked meat from infected animals. Humans working in slaughter facilities, laboratories or hospitals are at risk of acquiring infections.\n\nPeople with RVF will either show no symptoms or develop a mild illness. Signs of illness include fever, weakness, myalgia (muscle pain), back ache, dizziness, liver abnormalities, and weight loss. In some patients, the illness can progress to haemorrhagic fever, encephalitis (inflammation of the brain), or ocular disease (inflammation of the eye, blindness). Severe complications develop in 1-4 percent of cases, though most people recover within 4-7 days. Approximately one per cent of humans infected with Rift Valley fever die of the disease http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Media_Center/docs/pdf/Disease_cards/RVF-EN.pdf.\n\nInformation on the RVF situation in OIE Member countries found in the last 6-monthly report is available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Diseaseinformation/statuslist. Such information shows that during July-December 2012: Clinical disease was reported by 2 countries; Disease was reported as present but 'restricted to certain zone(s)/region(s)' in 2 countries; Reported present as 'Infection/Infestation in one or more zones' from one country; Reported as 'infection was present (with no clinical disease)' in one country, and; Reported as 'suspected' in 3 countries.\n\nIn the countries where the disease was reported for the period as 'absent' (21 countries), most indicate that they have 'general surveillance' and maintain 'targeted surveillance' in domestic animals. However, for wild animals, only 10 countries maintain 'general surveillance,' and only 4 of them have 'target surveillance. One of these countries was Senegal, where the disease has been indicated as absent in domestic animals since December 2012 and absent in wild animals since 2004; see HANDISTATUS http://web.oie.int/hs2/sit_mald_freq_pl.asp?c_cont=1&c_mald=9.\n\nInformation obtained from OIE's WAHID database indicates that since 2011 to date (September 2013), 141 outbreaks were reported officially in the area: Mauritania (3), Namibia (3), South Africa (134) and Senegal (1), the most recent case.\n\nThis information and additional data on these events can also be found in the WAHID database at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Countryinformation/Diseasetimeseries.

Rift Valley fever is a viral disease spread primarily by mosquitoes, which can affect both humans and animals. This was revealed by Dr. Aluma Araba, the Director of Vector and Disease Control in the national Ministry of Agriculture Forestry and Tourism.\n\nDr. Araba said the disease can also be transmitted by taking unpasteurized milk or by eating not-well-cooked meat of an infected animal. 'This is the 1st time we are reporting an outbreak of Rift Valley fever disease. We are preparing with emergency response but it would require decision makers to allocate more resources to fight this serious disease', said Dr. Araba.\n\nSouth Sudan reportedly has the biggest animal resources in Africa, and such an outbreak could have serious consequences for the country's livestock if no quick measures are taken to mitigate the outbreak. Rift Valley fever disease was 1st discovered in Kenya in 1931. It's largely believed to have made its way into the new country through the movement and trade of livestock across the borders.\n\nA workshop [has been established] to develop a contingency plan to map and identify the high-risk areas so that emergency responses can be directed [there], explained Dr. Bernard Betty, the head of ILRI [International Livestock Research Institute] team. She said it would take the collective efforts of government, stakeholders, and NGOs, among others, to bring the outbreak under control. The director for research and development in the Ministry of Agriculture, Professor Erneo B.Och, described the workshop as 'tangible' [?] and said the taskforce will be formulated together with [relevant] Ministries and other key stakeholders to stop 'losing this important sector and human life'. He said South Sudan will stop at nothing less than food security and human protection.\n\n[Byline: Abdulrazig Juma Abdalla]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[This government press release conveys no more information than the notification of an outbreak of Rift Valley fever [presumably in livestock] in the Eastern Equatoria and Upper Nile states of South Sudan. Further precise information is requested.\n\nRift Valley fever (RVF) is a mosquito-borne viral disease that typically occurs in various areas of sub-Saharan Africa, where virus activity varies from a low-level enzootic cycle to explosive outbreaks covering large areas. Periodically, Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) spreads to other areas, including northward into Egypt in 1977 and eastward across the Red Sea into Saudi Arabia and Yemen in 2000. How RVFV travels is unclear but probably involves movement of infected livestock or mosquitoes.\n\nThe 1st reported outbreak of RVF in Sudan occurred in 1973 in sheep and cattle in White Nile state; shortly thereafter, RVFV was isolated from a herd of cattle in northern Khartoum. Serologic surveys have detected RVFV antibodies in domestic livestock and in humans from different Sudanese states, including Nile, Khartoum, Kassala, El Gezira, Sennar, and White Nile. A recent seroepidemiologic survey reported a high prevalence of RVFV IgG (immunoglobulin G) among febrile patients admitted to New Halfa Hospital in Kassala state. New Halfa is an extensively irrigated agricultural area about 500 km (310 miles) east of Khartoum. Although the presence of IgG does not indicate recent infection, it does suggest considerable circulation of RVFV in the area at some time in the past. [For further information see: Imadeldin E.

The last case was notified on 27 Oct 2012 from Magta Lahjar in the Brakna region. The 6 regions include Assaba, Brakna, Hodh Chargui, Hodh Gharbi, Tagant, and Trarza. All the cases had history of contact with animals.\n\nIn humans, 25 samples tested positive by ELISA and PCR at the National Reference Laboratory of the National Institute of Public Health Research (INRS) in Nouakchott [the capital city of Mauritania] and at the Institut Pasteur in Dakar. In the animal population, analysis conducted by the National Veterinary Research Laboratory shows virus circulation in several regions of the country.\n\nA multi-sector task force has been jointly established by the MOH and the Ministry of Rural Development to respond to this outbreak. WHO and partners, including the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), are working within the task force to strengthen epidemiological surveillance in both human and animal health, strengthen capacity in case management at health care facilities, strengthen health measures in slaughterhouses, and raise awareness among farmers.\n\nA multi-sector investigation team has been deployed to conduct a detailed outbreak investigation among humans and animals in the affected areas. An international team of experts will be deployed to provide technical assistance from 3 to 10 Nov 2012.\n\nMauritania experienced an outbreak of RVF in 2010.

The Minister of Health, Mr. Hamady Ba Housseynou, presented to Cabinet a paper on an outbreak of Rift Valley fever (RFV) in Mauritania. The Minister reported that 7 cases of fever had been recorded in the country causing 4 deaths. 2 of the survivors were recovering and one was still under treatment.\n\nThis is not the 1st time that Rift Valley fever has occurred in Mauritania. Cases were recorded in Adrar in 2010. Among the causes of Rift valley fever are high rainfall and lack of ability to cook meat thoroughly. Mr. Hamady Ba Housseynou called on citizens to look out for signs of the disease and to take appropriate action immediately to contain the infection.\n\nThe Department of Health says it is ready to intervene at any time. But the situation is much more difficult for cases that occur away from urban areas on account of the difficult in provision the supply of blood that is vital to save the patients' lives.\n\nThe current disease situation situation is not unusual and there is no cause for panic. The cases are sporadic and there is no focal epidemic.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nCorrespondent Gert van der Hoek\n\n[Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a viral zoonosis that primarily affects animals but also has the capacity to infect humans. Infection can cause severe disease in both animals and humans. The disease also results in significant economic losses due to death and abortion among RVF-infected livestock. The vast majority of human infections result from direct or indirect contact with the blood or organs of infected animals. The virus can be transmitted to humans through the handling of animal tissue during slaughtering or butchering, assisting with animal births, conducting veterinary procedures, or from the disposal of carcasses or fetuses. Certain occupational groups such as herders, farmers, slaughterhouse workers and veterinarians are therefore at higher risk of infection. There is some evidence that humans may also become infected with RVF by ingesting the unpasteurized or uncooked milk of infected animals.\n\nHuman infections have also resulted from the bites of infected mosquitoes, most commonly the _Aedes_ mosquito. Transmission of RVF virus by hematophagous (blood-feeding) flies is also possible.\n\nTo date, no human-to-human transmission of RVF has been documented, and no transmission of RVF to health care workers has been reported when standard infection control precautions have been put in place. There has been no evidence of outbreaks of RVF in urban areas.\n\nThe incubation period for RVF varies from 2 to 6 days. The symptoms of RVF usually last from 4 to 7 days, after which time the immune response becomes detectable with the appearance of antibodies and the virus gradually disappears from the blood. While most human cases are relatively mild, a small percentage of patients develop a much more severe form of the disease. This usually appears as one or more of 3 distinct syndromes: ocular (eye) disease (0.5-2 percent of patients), meningoencephalitis (less than 1 percent) or haemorrhagic fever (less than 1 percent). The total case fatality rate has varied widely between different epidemics but, overall, has been less than 1 percent in those documented cases. Most fatalities occur in patients who develop the haemorrhagic icterus form.

RVF is endemic to\nsub-Saharan African countries and has caused major outbreaks in\nseveral countries including Kenya, Tanzania, Somalia, South Africa,\nMadagascar, Egypt, Sudan, Mauritania, Senegal, Saudi Arabia, and\nYemen. Pregnant ruminants infected with RVFV typically are subject to\nhigh-rate abortions, fetal malformation, and subclinical-to-fatal\nfebrile illness, while newborn lambs usually die by acute hepatitis.\nRVFV infection in humans primarily causes a self-limiting febrile\nillness; however, some patients develop haemorrhagic fever,\nneurological disorders, or blindness after the febrile period. In\nendemic areas, _Aedes_ mosquitoes, such as _Ae. mcintoshi_ or _Ae.\nvexans_ serve as vectors, and the virus can be transmitted into\noffspring transovarially. Heavy rainfall or flooding of river banks\ndue to construction of dams increases the number of permanent fresh\nwater species of mosquitoes such as _Culex pipiens_, which play a role\nin amplifying RVFV among mosquitoes, ruminants, and humans (see\nIkegami T, Makino S. The pathogenesis of Rift Valley fever. Viruses.\n2011; 3(5): 493-5;\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3111045/).\n\nThe vast majority of human infections result from direct or indirect\ncontact with the blood or organs of infected animals. The virus can be\ntransmitted to humans through the handling of animal tissue during\nslaughtering or butchering, assisting with animal births, conducting\nveterinary procedures, or from the disposal of carcasses or fetuses.\nThe aerosol mode of transmission has also led to infection in\nlaboratory workers.

It is caused by\na single serotype of a vector-borne RNA virus (Bunyavirus) of the\ngenus Phlebovirus. Floodwater-breeding mosquitoes of Aedes species\nplay a major role in outbreak initiation following periods of above\naverage rainfall, while Culex and Anopheles species, and less\nimportantly biting flies, are considered epidemic vectors. In South\nAfrica (SA), RVF occurs at irregular intervals; the first known\noutbreak reported in the 1950s, a major outbreak in 1974-76 and small,\nlocalized outbreaks in 1981 and 1999. In 2008, RVF reoccurred, with\nisolated outbreaks reported in 2009 followed by an extensive epidemic\nin 2010 affecting most parts of SA.\n\nIn April 2010, RVF was diagnosed in 4 sub-adult alpacas that died on\na farm in the Western Cape Province of SA. The disease had an abrupt\nonset and short course lasting from 4 to 6 hours. Affected animals\nwere anorexic, depressed, pyrexic, showed signs of abdominal\ndiscomfort, developed respiratory distress and despite supportive\ntherapy, died. At necropsy, widespread petechiae and ecchymoses were\nobserved in the buccal mucosa, subcutis, serosal surfaces, endo- and\nepicardium, liver, thymus, lungs, and lymph nodes. Small intestinal\nintraluminal hemorrhage was present in 2 animals. Histologically the\nliver showed multifocal to coalescent, extensive areas of coagulative\nto lytic necrosis. Characteristic intranuclear inclusions were present\nin two animals.

Floodwater-breeding mosquitoes of Aedes species\nplay a major role in outbreak initiation following periods of above\naverage rainfall, while Culex and Anopheles species, and less\nimportantly biting flies, are considered epidemic vectors.

The\nIndependent press, quoting from official sources, speaks of 17 deaths.\n\n'Cases of fever Rift Valley [fever] have caused losses of (human)\nlives and of livestock,' stated the Mauritanian News Agency (l'Agence\nmauritanienne d'information, AMI), without specifying the total.\nAccording to local independent media, the epidemic has already killed\n17 people, and the sick were sent to hospitals including those in Nouakchott.\n\nThe Minister of Health and Interior visiting the region has given\nstrict instructions to the population of the Adrar (the region where\nAoujeft is situated) that they must refrain, in response to these\n[Rift Valley] fever cases, from consuming locally produced meat and\nmilk, says AMI. These restrictions on meat and milk, 2 essential\ncommodities in the diet of the people, must last at least until the\ninvestigation is finished and the results of laboratory tests\nconducted since Thursday [2 Dec 2010] by veterinary specialists on\ninfected animals are confirmed says AMI.\n\nRift Valley fever is a disease that primarily affects animals but can\nalso infect humans. The infection can cause severe disease in both\nanimals and humans. The deaths and abortions in cattle infected with\nthe disease also result in substantial economic losses.\n\nThere is no specific treatment, and no human vaccine is available\nagainst the disease, which is transmitted by mosquitoes and affects\nmainly young men in contact with infected cattle.\n\nRift Valley fever bears the name of the region of Kenya where it was\nidentified in 1931. The disease has hit Kenya, Somalia and Tanzania\nin the years 1967/68, and the last major outbreak was reported in\n2000 in Yemen and Saudi Arabia [and Mauritania in 2003; see\nProMED-mail archive references below].\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nHealthMap Alerts via\nProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Mortality on this scale is unusual for local outbreaks of Rift\nValley fever. The text of this press report suggests that a precise\ndiagnosis has still to be confirmed. Further information is awaited.\n\nRift Valley fever (RVF) is a viral zoonosis that primarily affects\nanimals but also has the capacity to infect humans. Infection can\ncause severe disease in both animals and humans. The disease also\nresults in significant economic losses due to death and abortion\namong RVF-infected livestock.\n\nRVF virus is a member of the _Phlebovirus_ genus, one of the 5 genera\nin the family _Bunyaviridae_. The virus was 1st identified in 1931\nduring an investigation into an epidemic among sheep on a farm in the\nRift Valley of Kenya. Since then, outbreaks have been reported in\nsub-Saharan and North Africa [Mauritania]. In 1997-98, a major\noutbreak occurred in Kenya, Somalia and Tanzania, and in September\n2000, RVF cases were confirmed in Saudi Arabia and Yemen, marking the\n1st reported occurrence of the disease outside the African continent.\n\nThe vast majority of human infections result from direct or indirect\ncontact with the blood or organs of infected animals. The virus can\nbe transmitted to humans through the handling of animal tissue during\nslaughtering or butchering, assisting with animal births, conducting\nveterinary procedures, or from the disposal of carcasses or fetuses.\nCertain occupational groups such as herders, farmers, slaughterhouse\nworkers and veterinarians are, therefore, at higher risk of\ninfection. The virus infects humans through inoculation, for example\nvia a wound from an infected knife or through contact with broken\nskin, or through inhalation of aerosols produced during the slaughter\nof infected animals.\n\nThere is some evidence that humans may also become infected with RVF\nby ingesting the unpasteurized or uncooked milk of infected animals.\nHuman infections have also resulted from the bites of infected\nmosquitoes, most commonly the _Aedes_ mosquito. Transmission of RVF\nvirus by hematophagous (blood-feeding) flies is also possible. To\ndate, no human-to-human transmission of RVF has been documented, and\nno transmission of RVF to health care workers has been reported when\nstandard infection control precautions have been put in place. There\nhas been no evidence of outbreaks of RVF in urban areas.\n\nWhile most human cases are relatively mild, a small percentage of\npatients develop a much more severe form of the disease. This usually\nappears as one or more of 3 distinct syndromes: ocular (eye) disease\n(0.5-2 percent of patients), meningoencephalitis (less than one\npercent) or haemorrhagic fever (less than one percent).\n\nThe total case fatality rate has varied widely between different\nepidemics but, overall, has been less than one percent in those\ndocumented. Most fatalities occur in patients who develop the\nhaemorrhagic icterus form.\n\nMore detailed information can be obtained from the WHO website at:\n<http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs207/en/index.html>.\n\nThe HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map of Mauritania can be\naccessed at: <http://healthmap.org/r/0hQ0>. - Mod.CP]", "summary": "A ProMED-mail post\n<http://www.promedmail.org>\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\n<http://www.isid.org>\n\nDate: Thu 2 Dec 2010\n The virus infects humans through inoculation, for example\nvia a wound from an infected knife or through contact with broken\nskin, or through inhalation of aerosols produced during the slaughter\nof infected animals.

When you examine the history of Rift Valley Fever in West\nAfrica through our archives, it is apparent that there is a cyclic\nnature to the outbreaks in the western-most countries of West Africa\nlike Mauritania and Senegal -- just as RVF has a cyclic nature in East\nAfrica.\n\nThere were outbreaks in Mauritania in 2009 and 2010. This was preceded\nby outbreaks in 2002 and 2003. Prior to that we have a series in\noutbreaks in 1998 and 1999.

This comes close to 5 months after tens of\nNamibian animals were infected with RVF [virus] in the 1st outbreak of the\ndisease in the country since 1985.\n\nA notice about the 3 affected farmers was published in the weekly\nnewsletter of the Namibia Agricultural Union (NAU) last Friday [27 Aug\n2010]. Until yesterday [2 Sep 2010], however, Dr Jack Vries, chairperson of\nthe Ministry of Health and Social Service's National Health Emergency\nManagement Committee, had not been officially informed about the cases.\nVries told The Namibian that none of the country's 2 laboratories had made\nany positive diagnoses. This, he said, could be as a result of patients\nbeing tested in South Africa or not being tested at all.\n\nA Dorper sheep farmer, in the south of the country, yesterday [2 Sep 2010]\nsaid that he accidentally injected himself whilst he was busy immunising\nhis sheep about 3 weeks ago. 'I accidentally injected myself that Friday\nafternoon. By 1900 [that evening], I realised there was big trouble.'\nAccording to him, he could by then not even talk anymore. Apart from this,\nhe experienced a high fever, an increased heart beat and painful urination.\n'I also had terrible headaches. My urine was golden yellow, and it was\npainful when I urinated. And the heartbeats, it feels like your heart wants\nto run away.' It was only by Saturday afternoon that he could talk again,\nhe said. The farmer said that he decided not to go to a doctor. Instead, he\nspent a week in bed. A veterinarian he spoke to told him that it 'must be'\nRVF, he said.\n\nIn its newsletter, the NAU urged farmers 'to be very cautious when animals\nare vaccinated against RVF. If one gets pricked by the needle, the disease\ncan be contracted through the vaccine.' The union issued this warning\n'following the confirmation of 3 farmers in the south of Namibia who were\nidentified with the dreaded RVF.'\n\nDr Cleopas Bamhare, acting chief veterinary officer in the Ministry of\nAgriculture, Water and Forestry, earlier warned people to wear rubber\ngloves and face masks when they come into close contact with sick animals,\naborted foetuses, blood and other body fluids, especially during handling,\nslaughtering, butchering and milking, to avoid human infections. Meat\nintended for human consumption needs to be chilled and matured at 2 C for\nat least 24 hours. This, he said, will inactivate the virus if it is\npresent. The past week, Bamhare said no new animal infections have been\nreported to his office.\n\nEarlier this year [2010], it was reported that close to a 100 animals were\naffected in Namibia. Half of these died. Namibian farmers lost millions of\ndollars as a result of export bans that were in place when the outbreak was\nrife. More than 20 humans and hundreds of animals died in neighbouring\nSouth Africa during a recent RVF outbreak there.\n\nBamhare also earlier warned Namibians that RVF could cause a widespread\nepidemic in the next rainy season.\n\nAccording to Vries, the man would have landed in the intensive care unit\n(ICU) had it been RVF. However, another doctor The Namibian spoke to said\nit is 'definitely possible' for the farmer to have contracted the virus\nthrough the live vaccine. The farmer confirmed that it was the live vaccine.\n\n[byline: Denver Kisting]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nHealthMap Alerts via ProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The statement of the Namibia Agricultural Union that RVF virus infection\nin the 3 farmers was confirmed is not supported by other information, nor\nby the statement that samples were not tested by either of the country's 2\nlaboratories. The vaccine that the affected farmer used for vaccinating his\nsheep was the live, attenuated Smithburn product. Presumably, it might\ninfect a human following needlestick injury.\n\nPossible exposures of the other 2 farmers is not given. Conceivably, the\nfarmers may have been bitten by transovarially infected mosquitoes carrying\nthe virus that remained in the area following the last outbreak earlier\nthis year (2010). Several bunyaviruses, including RVF virus, can be\ntransovarially transmitted in _Aedes_ mosquitoes, and the virus-containing\neggs may remain viable for long periods of time in low-lying areas\n('dambos' in East Africa).

'Their alertness and prompt reaction prevented outbreaks of\nRVF in May 2010 from spreading, with potentially devastating\nconsequences on lives, livelihoods and food security,' Diouf said.\n\nDiouf singled out the Meat Board of Namibia, the abattoirs where the\ndisease was detected, the Directorate of Veterinary Services and the\nlivestock farmers concerned.\n\nThe vigilance and response of the veterinary services was all the more\nremarkable, Diouf said, when considering that RVF emerged in Namibia\nafter an absence of 25 years; almost all the staff involved had never\nhad to fight the disease before.\n\nRVF is a disease carried by mosquitoes after heavy rains and flooding\nand is characterised by high rates of abortion and neonatal mortality,\nprimarily in sheep, goats and also cattle. Humans are at risk -- and\ncan die -- when in close contact with the blood or organs of infected\nanimals or when bitten by infected mosquitoes.\n\nAn FAO team comprising members of the Animal Production and Health\nDivision and the Emergency Centre for Transboundary Animal Diseases\ndeployed at the request of the government returned from Namibia full\nof praise for the professional performance of the veterinary services\nin handling the outbreaks. Dr Juan Lubroth, FAO's Chief Veterinary\nOfficer said: 'The swift response is exemplary and very likely\nprevented worse from happening.'\n\nRVF was 1st suspected by veterinary services in sheep from 2 farms in\nthe Hardap/Karas regions on 9 May 2010. The disease was detected\nduring inspection at the Farmers' Meat Market Abattoir in Mariental,\nwhen lesions of RVF were recognised during examination.\n\n'The positive contribution of Namibia in the fight against RVF has\ninternational significance,' Diouf said. 'For this reason, FAO would\nlike to formally recognise the preparedness and readiness in place in\nNamibia and the alertness of veterinary services.\n\n'This is an inspiring example for other countries to follow to protect\ntheir animals, livelihoods, trade and indeed people, together with\nneighbouring countries from serious animal diseases.'\n\nHowever, RVF will continue to pose threats, including to Namibia, as\nthe next rainy season -- expected in October/November 2010 -- brings\nthe risks back. FAO looks forward to providing support in defining the\ndifferent options for control and prevention as part of Namibia's\nfuture strategy.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Namibia has reported to the OIE, since 10 May 2010 (Immediate\nNotification), 12 outbreaks of RVF in animals.

Hardap has the highest\nnumber of animals affected by the outbreak, where 11 farms are\naffected. The outbreak in Erongo is the 1st of its kind.\n\nThe Ministry of Agriculture, Water and Forestry said measures to\ncontain the outbreaks are being implemented with the co-operation of\naffected farmers. The total number of reported clinical cases so far\nidentified is 67 and 46 deaths from a total population of 9700 small\nstock on the affected farms.\n\nClinical signs of infection include abortion, stillbirths, weakness,\nbloody diarrhoea and difficulty in breathing. All cases (except on 2\nfarms where goats were affected) involve sheep.\n\n'These findings indicate that the disease is not widespread and can\nbe described as sporadic at this stage. This situation can be\nexplained by the prevailing winter conditions that do not favour the\nsurvival of the vectors (mosquitoes and biting flies),' a statement\nby the Directorate of Veterinary Services read. The directorate,\nhowever, warns farmers that the disease is likely to cause a\nwidespread epidemic during the next rainy season when vector activity\nis expected to increase if animals are not vaccinated.\n\nFarmers are therefore urged to vaccinate their livestock -- cattle,\nsheep and goats -- during this time.

The directorate\npredicts that there is an increased risk of the epidemic during the\ncoming rainy season. All livestock in the Hardap and Karas regions\nmust be vaccinated before the onset of the rains.\n\nTransporters intending to move animals through Botswana are expected\nto vaccinate their livestock with an attenuated live vaccine at least\n21 days prior to movement. Prior arrangements with the local State\nveterinary office must be made to avoid problems.\n\nIn the meantime, farmers who have vaccinated or would like to\nvaccinate their livestock, must inform their State veterinarian 3\nworking days prior to vaccination, provide proof of purchase of\nvaccine and empty vaccine containers.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Namibia reported to the OIE about the above outbreaks, in 3\nprovinces, in follow-up report No 2, submitted 7 Jul 2010.

Only a small\nproportion of infections can be presumed to result from mosquito\nbite, and the local vectors of the virus generally bite outdoors at\nnight in fields close to their breeding sites, and not in towns.\n\nAt the time of release of the interim report on the current outbreak\non 3 May 2010, there had been 172 laboratory confirmed human cases of\nthe disease with 15 deaths. Many diagnostic specimens arrive at the\nlaboratory with scant information, and the histories of potential\nexposure to infection have to be obtained retrospectively. By 3 May\n2010, it had been established that 113/139 (81 percent) of the 172\npatients were employed in the livestock industry and that 124/128 (97\npercent) had direct contact with infected animals or tissues prior to\nthe onset of disease. Of the remaining 4 patients investigated, one\nhad ingested unpasteurized milk and 3 (2 percent) reported exposure\nto mosquito bite in the absence of exposure to sick animals or animal\ntissues. By 20 May 2010, 202 cases of the disease had been confirmed\n(out of 1400 specimens examined), and investigation of the patient\nhistories continues, but laboratory confirmations have declined to\n5-10 per week in line with a marke!\nd reduction in veterinary diagnoses. From past experience, it can be\nsurmised that there will be a sharp decline in transmission of the\ndisease when the onset of frosts at the end of May 2010 suppresses\nmosquito activity.\n\nThere is no evidence that RVF infection has ever occurred in urban\nconsumers of meat subjected to inspection at abattoirs, as opposed to\nmeat derived form informal slaughter of sick animals in rural\ncommunities, and pasteurized milk and other dairy products sold in\ntowns likewise appear to be safe. Since RVF did not pose a threat to\nthe population at large at the height of the present outbreak, it is\nunlikely to present a hazard to tourists during the winter months of\nJune and July.\n\nVeterinary control and prevention of the disease is compounded by the\nirregular occurrence of outbreaks and the feasibility of mass\nimmunization of livestock. Methods for predicting outbreaks of RVF\nare as yet imprecise. Nevertheless, national and provincial\nveterinary services in South Africa repeatedly warned farmers to\nvaccinate livestock during the past 3 years. Unfortunately, many of\nthe farmers are unfamiliar with the disease and were slow to respond.\nMoreover, if livestock are vaccinated during an outbreak, there is a\ndanger of spreading the outbreak. Furthermore, it is not cost\neffective to produce and stockpile vaccine when demand is low, so\nsupply problems are often encountered during outbreaks. The most\nreadily produced veterinary vaccine, a modified live virus vaccine,\ncauses abortion in a small proportion of pregnant animals with a\nresultant reluctance to use it in breeding stock. An inactivated\n(killed) virus vaccine is also available, but is more laborious and e!\nxpensive to produce, and since at least 2 initial doses and annual\nboosters are required to induce solid immunity, it is less effective\nfor use in the face of an imminent outbreak.\n\nThe institution of compulsory livestock vaccination and veterinary\ncontrol would be prohibitively expensive and impossible to sustain\nfor a disease which disappears for decades at a time. The situation\nmay change with the advent of improved vaccines, which are already in\nan advanced stage of development. A killed vaccine for use in humans\nwas produced in limited quantities decades ago, but it is no longer\navailable, and the small and irregular potential demand inhibits the\ndevelopment of a new human vaccine.\n\n--\nDr. Willie Ungerer\nActing Director\nDirectorate: Animal Health\nDepartment of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries\nRepublic of South Africa\n<WillieU@nda.agric.za>\n\n[ProMED-mail very much appreciates the information provided by Dr.\nWillie Ungerer, which details some factual information about Rift\nValley fever transmission to humans, control strategies in animal\npopulations and factors determining the disease control choices made\nduring the current outbreak of RVF in South Africa. Clearly, it is\nimportant to emphasize the fact that the vast majority of cases in\nhumans are associated with animal contact on farms and that foodborne\ntransmission of well cooked items, with the exception of\nunpasteurized milk, has clearly never been associated with human RVF\ncases. Again, Dr. Ungerer points out that Rift Valley fever has not\nbeen a transmission threat to urban consumers of meats, and so\ntourists who stay in town to watch the upcoming FIFA World Cup are\nnot at any increased risk of disease. This is emphatically the case\nas evidenced by the fact that there are no international travel\nwarnings for South Africa concerning RVF.\n\nWhat is of greatest interest in this South Africa RVF outbreak is the\nassessment and management of risk and the integration of animal and\nhuman health concerns. Risk is not limited to only the probability of\ndisease spread in the animal population and its potential for\ninfecting humans. A proper risk assessment requires consideration of\nmagnitude of the consequences if the disease were to not only infect\nfarmers, veterinarians, slaughterhouse workers etc. but also somehow\ninfect a tourist traveling outside the FIFA World Cup game sites\nwhile on their visit to South Africa. The FIFA world cup will last\nfor about a month, and any case of RVF in tourists would have severe\nramifications.\n\nClearly, the disease has a history of disappearing for decades in\nSouth Africa, but it has also appeared for the last 2 years in South\nAfrica affecting cattle, sheep, goats and African buffalo, with 28\noutbreaks and 501 cases in 2008 and 56 outbreaks and 401 cases in\n2009 (see Disease Database Query on Animal Diseases in the RSA at\n<http://www.daff.gov.za/>).\n\nDoes the fact that the disease appeared in South Africa during the\nlast 2 years change the disease control calculus in any way? Another\nissue, which really is the proverbial elephant in the room, is how\nmuch risk is being accepted by letting the disease run its course,\nwhen so many tourists are flocking to the country. It is stated by\nDr. Ungerer that the disease would be prohibitively expensive to\ncontrol in livestock, but what would be the consequences and cost of\neven a single tourist being diagnosed with a true case of RVF?\nAdditionally, given that farmers are only encouraged but not mandated\nto vaccinate, are not provided vaccine by the government and have\napparently chosen not to vaccinate, it appears that the only RVF\ndisease control strategy has been to allow the disease to run its\ncourse. This has resulted in a situation where the control strategy\nfor both animals and, by extension, humans depends on reducing the\ndisease in animals passively as the vector population d!\nies out with the approaching winter. Given recent experiences with\nclimate variation associated with global climate change and the\nextension of vector ranges such as bluetongue in Europe, is such a\npassive strategy justified given the stakes this year (2010) in South\nAfrica?\n\nThe disease outbreaks are still being updated at OIE, so can we\nreally depend this year (2010) on the traditional onset of winter to\nend the epidemic in animals? Would a formal cost benefit and risk\nanalysis provide help in making any or all of these risk management\ndecisions?\n\nA final issue which may shed light on optimal disease control\napproaches to use in the future is how well have the human and animal\ndisease control sectors integrated their responses. This is\nparticularly important because the nature of Rift Valley fever is\nsuch that animals are the source of the disease and the source of its\nultimate control. Control efforts in people appeared to be a high\npriority as the South African Field Epidemiology and Laboratory\nTraining Program (SAFELTP) was involved early, but it would be\nfascinating to know the public health perspective on letting the\nSouth African winter end the epidemic in animals as the chief disease\ncontrol tactic for the source of ongoing disease spread. It would\nalso be important to know how decision making in the South African\npublic health establishment integrated veterinary inputs for\ncontrolling the disease in animals, their assessment of risk after\nthe last 2 years of outbreaks, and how much emphasis is placed on\nzoonotic!\ndisease control in various public health decision making centers\nsuch as the FELTP program. In the end, it is a question of how much\nand at what levels integrated veterinary and human health inputs in\ndisease control decision making occur, how integrated the process is\nin the day to day disease management sense, and how much of a One\nMedicine, One Health perspective is taken when being faced with an\noutbreak situation involving a major zoonotic disease during a time\nof high visibility, greatly increased worldwide travel to South\nAfrica and when major economic stakes are involved.\n\nIn summary, we are beginning to understand that disease emerges when\njust the 'perfect storm' of events come together to foster the\nemergence of a new disease or a major change in disease epidemiology.\nIs the failure of vaccination in animals, the passivity of the\ncontrol program in animals, the lack of emphasis on monitoring and\ncontrol at the human animal interface, the population and\ndemographics changes which are occurring with the influx of tourists\nfor FIFA World Cup games just such a 'perfect storm'? Probably not,\nas the emergence of new disease is rare indeed and some new\ntransmission dynamics would have to be elaborated by the virus\nbecause current prospects for any human transmission to tourists are\nreally highly unlikely.

It is a viral\ndisease of domestic and wildlife animals, but it can also affect\npeople.\n\nIn animals, it is mainly transmitted through mosquito bites.

However, should farmers not take precautionary measures by\nvaccinating their animals, they might be in for a rough ride next summer\n[2010-11]. So says Dr Cleopas Bamhare, acting chief veterinary officer in\nthe Ministry of Agriculture, Water and Forestry.\n\nAccording to Bamhare, no new RVF infections have been reported since the\nones reported on 6 farms in the Hardap Region and one in the Karas Region.\nThe onset of winter played a significant role in bringing the [zoonotic]\ndisease under control for the time being, he said.\n\nA total of 17 animals died in the 2 affected regions in what was regarded\nas the 1st RVF outbreak in Namibia since 1985. Hundreds of animals and\nclose to 20 people died of RVF in neighbouring South Africa (SA) recently.\n\nIf Namibia does not prepare adequately against a follow-up outbreak, the\ncountry might be worse off than it was during last month's [May 2010]\noutbreak. 'It is the next season that we are worried about. For now, it is\nunder control,' Bamhare said.\n\nNo human infections have been reported in Namibia.\n\nBamhare said the department of veterinary services dealt with the outbreak\n'textbook-style', which helped convince trade partners to lift restrictions\non imports of Namibian animals and meat products within weeks. 'And a\nsituation like that [trade restrictions] could take months to bring under\ncontrol, crippling the industry,' he said.\n\nHe said there are still no proper statistics available of the number of\nanimals that have been vaccinated against RVF. In terms of an agreement\nwith SA, live animals must have been vaccinated at least 21 days before\nbeing allowed into that country.\n\nBamhare spoke to The Namibian at an aquatic animal health training seminar\nthat started in Swakopmund on Tuesday evening [15 Jun 2010].

Symptoms of\nrickettsial infections include rash, fever, and flu like symptoms.\nAfrican tick bite fever is caused by _Rickettsia africae_ and tends to\nbe a milder illness, with less prominent rash and little tendency to\nprogress to complicated disease. All rickettsial diseases respond to\ntreatment with antibiotics such as doxycycline and tetracycline.\n\nAs of 10 May [2010], the Government of South Africa has reported 186\nconfirmed cases of RVF in humans, including 18 deaths, in Free State\nProvince, Eastern Cape Province, Northern Cape Province, Western Cape,\nand North West Province. RVF is a viral disease that primarily affects\nanimals (such as cattle, buffalo, sheep, goats, and camels). The\ndisease can also affect humans. The main mode of transmission of RVF\nis via direct or indirect contact with the blood or organs of infected\nanimals. Human infections have also resulted from the bites of\ninfected mosquitoes. There is evidence that humans may become infected\nby ingesting the unpasteurized or uncooked milk of infected animals.\n\nWHO advises no international travel restriction to or from South\nAfrica. However, WHO recommends that visitors to South Africa,\nespecially those intending to visit farms and/or game reserves, avoid\ncoming into contact with animal tissues or blood, avoid drinking\nunpasteurized or uncooked milk or eating raw meat.\n\nAll travelers should take appropriate precautions against bites from\nmosquitoes and other blood-sucking insects (including the use of\ninsect repellents, wearing long-sleeved shirts and trousers, and\nsleeping under mosquito nets).

The\noutbreaks cover a wide geographic range of the country including the\nFree State, Northern Cape Province, Eastern Cape Province, Western\nCape Province and now the North West Province, which means there are\nreports from 5 of the 9 provinces in the country.\n\nTo summarize the current status of the outbreaks this week: Sheep\nhave been mainly infected with 1190 cases and 895 deaths. Other\nspecies including cattle, goats, buffaloes, camilidaes, and wild\nanimals have been affected to a much lesser degree. The latest\nfigures from the human side of the zoonotic bridge include 186 human\ncases with 18 deaths, an approximate 10 percent case fatality rate.\nAlthough an effective vaccine for animals is available, there appears\nto be only very passive efforts to control the disease in the animal\npopulation.\n\nGiven the influx of visitors for the upcoming FIFA World Cup set to\nbegin in just under a month, the strategy of allowing a zoonotic\ndisease to run its course in animals seems very risky indeed. The\ndisease can be transmitted by mosquitoes although it usually is not,\nbeing most commonly transmitted by exposure to infected animal\ntissues. Of the 186 human cases to date, how many are veterinarians,\nslaughterhouse workers and/or farmers, and how many fall outside the\ntraditional high risk groups? It would seem, given the stakes, that\nan extra insurance, really the best and most reliable insurance\nwhenever a zoonotic disease is involved, should be taken out by\neradicating this zoonotic disease in animals.\n\nFor further information on RVF in animals and the current South\nAfrican attempts to control it, we are repeating the moderator\ncomments from the previous ProMED-EAFR posting Rift Valley fever,\nanimal - South Africa: OIE 20100504.207118. - Mods.PC/FE]\n\n[Rift Valley Fever (RVF) is an arthropod borne viral disease that\noccurs throughout sub-Saharan Africa, Egypt and Arabic Peninsula. The\ndisease is caused by a RNA virus that has been classified in the\nfamily of Bunyaviridae and genus Phlebovirus. RVF outbreak normally\noccurs following exceptionally heavy rainfall preceded by a drought.\nThe disease was reported in Free State Province in February 2010 and\nsince then, two other Provinces (Northern and Eastern Cape) have\nreported the disease. This area is different from the previous\noutbreaks in the country.\n\nIn 2008, the outbreaks were much smaller in scale and in a different\nlocation. There were 31 total outbreaks between January and June,\n2008 with 14 in Mpumalanga, 5 in Limpopo, 6 in Guateng and 6 in North\nWest Province. These areas are adjacent to Swaziland, which also had\ntwo outbreaks around the same time. In 1999, the outbreaks occurred\nin near the Kruger National Park, not terribly far away from some of\nthe outbreaks in Limpopo and Mpumalanga in 2008. The current\noutbreaks are to the South and West previous outbreaks in the Free\nState, Northern Cape and Western Cape Provinces.\n\nThe following is extracted from an excellent, firsthand account of\nthe outbreak in 1999 kindly sent in to ProMED-mail by the\ndistinguished South African virologist, Bob Swanepol. I also\nrecommend the second posting in the series, with particular attention\nto the moderator comments by Charlie Calisher. What follows is a\nSwanepol's summary of outbreaks going back to the 1970s:\n\nRVF occurs in the country at irregular intervals of many years when\nparticularly heavy rains favour the occurrence of population\nexplosions of the floodwater-breeding aedine mosquito vectors of the\nvirus. The last big outbreaks occurred on the inland plateau during\nthe heavy rains of 1974-76, and a small outbreak on the coast of\nnorthern KwaZulu-Natal Province in 1981 -- since when the disease has\nnot been diagnosed in South Africa.\n\nWe provide you this historical background to make a point. The\ncurrent outbreak is unprecedented in its impact in animals, with 79\nnew outbreaks in the first report and 93 in the second update in this\nreport . It appears as if the disease is running rampant in South\nAfrica and is totally uncontrolled. RVF took its 12 human victim\nrecently and yet there is apparently no effective efforts to control\nthe disease in animals.\n\nRift Valley Fever classically starts in animals and spreads to\npeople. Most human cases arise through exposure to infected animal\ntissues at slaughter or through veterinary activities. However,\ninfection through mosquito bites cannot be completely ruled out. So\nfar in these outbreaks it appears high risk individuals working with\nanimals are those getting the infection.\n\nNot only does the disease start in animals, it also must be\ncontrolled there to keep people safe. By the magnitude of the\noutbreaks reported here, it would seem South Africa is in an\nunprecedented situation. Even though RVF is not a 'controlled\ndisease' in South Africa, only being notifiable and only meriting\ninformation and advice from the State Veterinary Services, it is\nbecoming increasingly obvious that such tactics are not getting the\njob done. It is understandable that standing, effective animal\ndisease control programs might not be in place when there can be gaps\nof a decade or more in between outbreaks. This is the nature of\nemerging disease but this is exactly why Joshua Lederberg, a true\nleader in the EID field indicated that 'against the adaptability of\nmicrobes, all we have is our wits.'\n\nEven though both attenuated and inactivated vaccines have been shown\nto work, it appears as if the disease is not being controlled by the\ncurrent animal disease control paradigm of information, support and\nadvice to farmers. Furthermore the number of human cases keeps\nrising, having increased by 23 in the six day period between our last\ntwo ProMED-mail reports to a total of 143 human cases with 9 deaths.\nAgain, the best method of control is for the disease to be nipped in\nthe bud at its animal source and if current measures don't allow for\neffective control then innovation should be seriously considered.\nParticularly given that the eyes of world will soon be squarely\nfocused on South Africa with the upcoming FIFA World Cup soccer\nfinals to begin in mid June, just some 40 days from now. - Mods.PC/FE]", "summary": "A ProMED-mail post\n<http://www.promedmail.org>\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\n<http://www.isid.org>\n\nDate: 12 May 2010\n What follows is a\nSwanepol's summary of outbreaks going back to the 1970s:\n\nRVF occurs in the country at irregular intervals of many years when\nparticularly heavy rains favour the occurrence of population\nexplosions of the floodwater-breeding aedine mosquito vectors of the\nvirus.

He first\nreported signs of illness on 23 Apr 2010. The same day he presented at a\nMinistry of Health facility in Najran, where he was hospitalised and\nsuspected to be a case of viral haemorrhagic fever. Signs observed included\nnausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and epistaxis.\n\nThe patient's blood was sent to the Central Laboratory (Riyadh) and tested\nfor various viral haemorrhagic fevers (Rift Valley fever, Alkhurma\nhaemorrhagic fever, and dengue fever). All were negative except for Rift\nValley fever, which was detected using real time RT-PCR. Tests for Rift\nValley fever virus IgM and IgG were negative.\n\nAt the present time, the exact source and locale of Rift Valley fever virus\ninfection is not clear and is still being investigated. The patient\ntravelled extensively in the south western areas of the kingdom of Saudi\nArabia known to be endemic for Rift Valley fever (Tihama, Aseer, and Gizan)\nsome 45 days before the onset of his present illness. However, this\nextended time frame does not seem compatible with the known incubation\nperiod of Rift Valley fever virus (around 2 to 6 days). In addition, the\nlack of antibodies (IgM or IgG) adds further doubt to the patient being\ninfected during that visit. The patient is also known to have visited a\nlivestock farm where he purchased an animal. It was then slaughtered and\ncooked for him at a commercial outlet. He reported not taking part in the\nslaughtering or cutting up process.\n\nThe Ministry of Health, in coordination with the Ministry of Agriculture\nand local municipalities of Gizan, Najran, and Aseer, is conducting\nextensive epidemiological and entomological investigations and results are\npending.

The virus is classified in the genus\n_Phlebovirus_ of the family _Bunyaviridae_ and causes outbreaks of\nabortions and deaths of young livestock (predominantly sheep, goats, and\ncattle). Humans become infected from contact with infected tissues of\nlivestock, and less frequently from mosquito bites. The mosquitoes (and\nbiting flies) which transmit the virus generally prefer to feed on\nlivestock outdoors at night.\n\nThe virus was first identified in 1931 during an investigation into an\nepidemic among sheep on a farm in the Rift Valley of Kenya, hence its name.\nSince then, extensive outbreaks have been reported in sub-Saharan and North\nAfrica. In 1997-98, a major outbreak occurred in Kenya, Somalia, and\nTanzania and subsequently in September 2000 Rift Valley fever was confirmed\nin Saudi Arabia and Yemen (the 1st and only reported occurrence of the\ndisease out-with the African continent). Currently there is an ongoing\noutbreak of Rift Valley fever in South Africa, which has been responsible\nfor several human deaths.\n\nThe source of the Saudi patient's exposure is unclear. Although he had\ntravelled in virus endemic areas of Saudi Arabia, his infection appears to\nhave been more recent. The majority of human infections result from direct\nor indirect contact with the blood or organs of infected animals, during\nthe handling of animals, slaughtering or butchering, assisting with animal\nbirths, or from the disposal of carcasses or fetuses. Certain occupational\ngroups such as herders, farmers, slaughterhouse workers, and veterinarians\nare therefore at higher risk of infection. Other routes of transmission\ninclude inhalation of aerosols produced during the handling and slaughter\nof infected animals, by consumption of unpasteurized milk, and by insect\nbites. No human-to-human transmission of Rift Valley fever virus infection\nhas been documented, and transmission to health care workers is not a\nhazard provided standard infection control precautions are in place.\nFurther information on the source of the Saudi patient's infection is awaited.\n\nA map of Saudi Arabia showing the location of Najran in the south, near the\nborder with Yemen is available at <http://www.saudinf.com/main/map.htm>.\nThe HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map of Saudi Arabia can be accessed\nat <http://healthmap.org/r/01gJ>. - Mod.CP]", "summary": "A ProMED-mail post\n<http://www.promedmail.org>\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\n<http://www.isid.org>\n\nDate: Thu 6 May 2010\n The majority of human infections result from direct\nor indirect contact with the blood or organs of infected animals, during\nthe handling of animals, slaughtering or butchering, assisting with animal\nbirths, or from the disposal of carcasses or fetuses.

The patient travelled (as part\nof a group) from Port Elizabeth through rural areas along the southern\ncoast of South Africa (Eastern and Western Cape provinces). She visited\nsafari parks and mountain areas. Nights were spent in hotels or lodges.\nTowards the end of the trip, the group visited Cape Town for a few days.\nShe fell ill on 7 Apr 2010, the day before returning to Germany. Symptoms\nincluded fever up to 39 deg C [102.2 deg F], slight thrombocytopenia,\nheadache, conjunctivitis, swollen inguinal lymph nodes, a slight\nmacula-papulous exanthema on both legs, and a discrete hemorrhagic\nexanthema of the abdominal skin, as well as vesicular efflorescences on the\nfeet. Hospital [admission] was not required. Blood samples tested positive\nfor Rift Valley fever (RVF) virus-specific IgM and IgG; RT-PCR was\nnegative. Based on the currently available data, it is likely that the case\npatient acquired a RVF infection in South Africa. Further laboratory\nanalyses, both in Germany and in South Africa, are in progress.\n\nThe German public health authorities still consider the risk of RVF virus\ninfection for tourists visiting South Africa to be small. Tourists are\nrecommended to observe mosquito protection measures (repellents, nets, long\nclothing) even outside of endemic areas and during the day. Close contact\nwith wild and domestic animals (especially raw meat, blood, faeces, urine,\nplacenta tissue) should be avoided. Uncooked meat and raw milk should not\nbe consumed (heated meats and pasteurized milk are fine). If fever develops\nwithin a month after leaving South Africa, a physician should be visited\nand made aware of the travel history.\n\n[authors: Christina Frank, Robert Koch Institute, Berlin, Germany\nJonas Schmidt-Chanasit, Bernhard Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine,\nHamburg, Germany)\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nDr. med.

The human cases are farmers, veterinarians, and farm\nworkers. Additional suspect cases are currently being tested.\n\nOutbreak investigations by the Department of Health and the Department\nof Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries are ongoing, supported by the\nSouth African Field Epidemiology and Training Programme (SA-FELTP) and\nthe NICD.\n\nAffected farms are primarily clustered within Free State (initially in\nLejweleputswa District, Bultfontein area); however animal cases of RVF\nhave been confirmed in all districts with spill over into Eastern\nCape, Northern Cape, and Gauteng. The Department of Agriculture in\nFree State has started the vaccination of animals, to contain the\nspread of the virus. RVF is a viral disease that can cause severe\nillness in a small proportion of infected humans. The virus is\ntransmitted by mosquitoes and causes outbreaks of abortion and deaths\nof young livestock (sheep, goats and cattle). It is important to note\nthat humans become infected from contact with infected tissues of\nlivestock and less frequently from mosquito bites. The disease occurs\nthroughout Africa and Madagascar when exceptionally heavy rains favour\nthe breeding of the mosquito vectors.\n\nClinical features in humans\n---------------------------\nTypically illness is asymptomatic or mild in the vast majority of\ninfected persons, and severe disease would be expected to occur in\nless than 1 percent of infected persons.\n\nKey symptoms\n------------\n- The incubation period (interval from infection to onset of symptoms)\nfor RVF varies from two to six days\n- Sudden onset of flu-like fever and/or muscle pain\n- Some patients develop neck stiffness, sensitivity to light, loss of\nappetite and vomiting\n- Symptoms of RVF usually last from 4-7 days, after which time the\nimmune response becomes detectable with the appearance of antibodies\nand the virus gradually disappears from the blood.\n\nSevere form of RVF in humans includes\n- Vision disturbances\n- Intense headache, loss of memory, hallucinations, confusion,\ndisorientation, vertigo, convulsions, lethargy and coma\n- Haemorrhagic fever.\n\nThe public living in the affected areas is encouraged to seek medical\nattention at their nearest Health facilities, should they have any of\nthe symptoms above.\n\nPreventive measures\n------------------\n- While there is no specific treatment, the majority of persons\naffected will recover completely. People should avoid contact with the\ntissues of infected animals, refrain from drinking unpasteurised milk\nand prevent mosquito bites to avoid becoming infected\n- Farmers and veterinarians should wear protective clothing when\nhandling sick animals or their tissues.

'The 6 others, who had mild disease, continue to be\nunder observation and treatment.' Sefularo, who was on an inspection\ntour of the Pelonomi hospital in the Free State to inspect the level\nof readiness of health facilities for the FIFA World Cup, said the\ndisease posed no threat to the event. 'I would like to place it on\nrecord that this occurrence does not constitute a crisis. The\noutbreak is being contained,' he said.\n\nRVF is a communicable virus, endemic in South Africa and other\nAfrican countries. In animals, the virus is transmitted by mosquitoes\nand causes outbreaks of abortion and deaths of young sheep, cattle\nand goats. It [can be] transmitted to humans through contact with\ninfected livestock through direct or indirect contact with blood or\norgans of infected animals; the handling of animal tissue during\nslaughtering or butchering of animals or assisting with animal\nbirths; conducting veterinary services or through being cut by\ninfected knives or needles among other things.\n\nSefularo said 15 farms had reported laboratory confirmed animal cases\nwith extensive livestock deaths. The affected farms were primarily\nclustered around the Lejweleputswa District in the Bultfontein area.\nHe said no human-to-human transmission had occurred. Symptoms of the\nvirus were mild fever, headaches and muscle pain.\n\nSefularo appealed to farming communities in the Free State and\nNorthern Cape to avoid high risk husbandry procedures and\nslaughtering practices by using gloves and protective clothing and to\navoid the consumption of fresh blood, raw milk or animal tissue.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nHealthMap Alerts via ProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Rift Valley Fever (RVF) is a viral zoonosis that primarily affects\nanimals but also has the capacity to infect humans. Infection can\ncause severe disease in both animals and humans, leading to high\nrates of disease and death. The disease also results in significant\neconomic losses due to death and abortion among RVF-infected\nlivestock. The virus was 1st identified in 1931 during an\ninvestigation into an epidemic among sheep on a farm in the Rift\nValley of Kenya. Since then, outbreaks have been reported elsewhere\nin Africa.\n\nThe vast majority of human infections result from direct or indirect\ncontact with the blood or organs of infected animals. The virus can\nbe transmitted to humans through the handling of animal tissue during\nslaughtering or butchering, assisting with animal births, conducting\nveterinary procedures, or from the disposal of carcasses or fetuses.\nCertain occupational groups such as herders, farmers, abbatoir\nworkers and veterinarians are therefore at higher risk of infection.\nHuman infections have also resulted from the bites of infected\nmosquitoes, most commonly the _Aedes_ mosquito, and transmission of\nRVF virus by hematophagous (blood-feeding) flies is also possible.\n\nWhile most human cases are relatively mild, a small percentage of\npatients develop a much more severe form of the disease. This usually\nappears as one or more of 3 distinct syndromes: ocular disease (0.5-2\npercent of patients), meningoencephalitis (less than 1 percent) or\nhaemorrhagic fever (less than 1 percent). The total case fatality\nrate has varied widely between different epidemics but, overall, has\nbeen less than 1 percent in those documented. Most fatalities occur\nin patients who develop the haemorrhagic icterus form.\n\nAs outbreaks of RVF in animals precede human cases, the establishment\nof an active animal health surveillance system to detect new cases is\nessential in providing early warning for veterinary and human public\nhealth authorities.

This usually\nappears as one or more of 3 distinct syndromes: ocular disease (0.5-2\npercent of patients), meningoencephalitis (less than 1 percent) or\nhaemorrhagic fever (less than 1 percent). Sefularo, who was on an inspection\ntour of the Pelonomi hospital in the Free State to inspect the level\nof readiness of health facilities for the FIFA World Cup, said the\ndisease posed no threat to the event. ' Infection can\ncause severe disease in both animals and humans, leading to high\nrates of disease and death. Human infections have also resulted from the bites of infected\nmosquitoes, most commonly the _Aedes_ mosquito, and transmission of\nRVF virus by hematophagous (blood-feeding) flies is also possible. There were 7 confirmed cases of Rift Valley Fever (RVF) in the Free\nState and Northern Cape and one death reported, the deputy minister\nof health said on Monday [8 Mar 2010].", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "rift valley fever"], "syndromes": ["haemorrhagic fever", "encephalitis"], "event_date": ["2010-03-25 00:00:00", "2021-03-29 00:00:00", "1931-03-25 00:00:00", "2021-03-01 00:00:00", "2010-02-26 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Congo", "country": "Congo Republic"}, {"location": "Pelonomi", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "the Free State", "country": "South Africa"}, {"location": "South Africa", "country": "South Africa"}, {"location": "Kenya", "country": "Kenya"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "402272", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Rift Valley fever - South Africa (05): (FS, EC, NC, GT, NW)", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=402272", "date": "2010-03-28 20:00:03", "main_text": "RIFT VALLEY FEVER - SOUTH AFRICA (05): (FREE STATE, EASTERN CAPE,\nNORTHERN CAPE, GAUTENG, NORTH WEST)\n**************************************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\n<http://www.promedmail.org>\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\n<http://www.isid.org>\n\nDate: Sat 27 Mar 2010\nSource: Times Live, SAPA report [edited]\n<http://www.timeslive.co.za/local/article376492.ece/3-more-infected-with-rift-valley-fever>\n\n\nMore infected with Rift Valley fever\n------------------------------------\nA total of 3 more people have been infected with Rift Valley fever\n(RVF), bringing the total to 63 of laboratory confirmed human cases,\nthe Department of Health said. Spokeswoman Charity Bhengu said of the\n63 cases of infected people, 54 cases and 2 deaths were in the Free\nState, 4 in Eastern Cape and 5 in Northern Cape. 'Direct contact with\nRVF-infected livestock and/or linked to farms with confirmed animal\ncases of RVF, remain the main risk factors for the infection. The\nhuman cases are farmers, veterinarians and farm workers. Additional\nsuspect cases are currently being tested.'\n\nRift Valley fever is a viral disease that can cause severe illness in\na low proportion of infected humans. The virus is transmitted by\nmosquitoes and causes outbreaks of abortion and deaths of young\nlivestock such as sheep, goats and cattle. 'It is important to note\nthat humans become infected by contact with infected tissues of\nlivestock and less frequently from mosquito bites,' said Bhengu.\n\nSo far, 70 000 animals have been vaccinated in the Free State to\ncontain the spread of the virus, according to the Department of\nAgriculture. The outbreak investigations by the Department of Health\nand the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries were\ncontinuing, supported by the SA Field Epidemiology and Training\nProgramme (SA-FELTP) and the NICD [National Institute for Communicable\nDiseases].\n\nThe 1st human victim of the sickness was identified in the Free State\non 13 Feb 2010. Since then, the illness has been primarily clustered\nwithin the Lejweleputswa District and Bultfontein area of the Free\nState. Animal infections had rapidly spread to most districts with\nspillover into the Eastern Cape, Northern Cape, North West and Gauteng.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The number of human cases of Rift Valley fever in South Africa has\nincreased to 63 from the 47 reported on Wed 24 Mar 2010 (Rift Valley\nfever - South Africa (04): (FS, EC, NC, GT, NW) 20100324.0935). The\nnumber of cases in the Free State has increased from 41 to 54, from 3\nto 4 in Eastern Cape province and 3 to 5 in Northern Cape province.\nThe number of fatalities remains 2, both in Free State province.\nAnimal cases, but so far no human cases, have been recorded in Gauteng\nand North West provinces. The outbreak remains centered in Free State\nprovince and it is to be hoped that the emergency vaccination of some\n70 000 animals there may halt the spread of the virus.\n\nThe vast majority of human infections with Rift Valley fever virus\nresult from direct or indirect contact with the blood or organs of\ninfected animals. The virus can be transmitted to humans through the\nhandling of animal tissue during slaughtering or butchering, assisting\nwith animal births, conducting veterinary procedures, or from the\ndisposal of carcasses or fetuses. The virus infects humans through\ninoculation; for example, via a wound from an infected knife or\nthrough contact with broken skin, or through inhalation of aerosols\nproduced during the slaughter of infected animals. There is some\nevidence that humans may also become infected by ingesting the\nunpasteurized or uncooked milk of infected animals. Less frequently\nhuman infections may result from the bites of infected mosquitoes.\n\nWhile most human cases of Rift Valley fever are relatively mild, a\nsmall percentage of patients develop a much more severe form of the\ndisease. This usually appears as one or more of 3 distinct syndromes:\nocular (eye) disease (0.5-2 percent of patients), meningoencephalitis\n(less than 1 percent) or haemorrhagic fever (less than 1 percent).\nAccording to the World Health Organisation there has been no evidence\nof outbreaks of Rift valley fever in urban areas.\n\nA map of the provinces of South Africa can be accessed at:\n<http://www.sa-venues.com/maps/south-africa-provinces.htm>.\nThe Lejweleputswa region of the Free State can be located via the map at:\n<http://www.sa-venues.com/maps/freestate_relief.htm>.\nThe HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map of South Africa is available at:\n<http://healthmap.org/r/00vd>.\n- Mod.CP]", "summary": "A ProMED-mail post\n<http://www.promedmail.org>\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\n<http://www.isid.org>\n\nDate: Sat 27 Mar 2010\n The virus infects humans through\ninoculation; for example, via a wound from an infected knife or\nthrough contact with broken skin, or through inhalation of aerosols\nproduced during the slaughter of infected animals.

Paweska\n<januszp@nicd.ac.za>\n\n\nA novel Rift Valley fever virus genotype strikes in Northern Cape, South Africa\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nIn mid October 2009, 4 suspected human cases of Rift Valley fever\n(RVF) from the Northern Cape Province of South Africa were\ninvestigated at the Special Pathogens Unit, National Institute for\nCommunicable Disease of the National Health Laboratory Service. Of\nthose, 2 were confirmed by serology, virus isolation and nucleic acid\ndetection as being recently infected with RVF virus. Analysis of\npartial sequencing data of the M segment of a virus isolate recovered\nfrom the index case revealed that the patient was infected with a RVF\nvirus genotype closest related to a 2004 Namibian isolate from the\nCaprivi Strip, and clustering with a 1981 South African isolate from\nthe East Coast, and isolates from Senegal (1993), Central African\nRepublic (1969) and Guinea (1981, 1984), but not with other South\nAfrican isolates recovered from Kwazulu-Natal in March this year\n[2009] and from other 4 provinces (Mpumalanga, Limpopo, North West\nand Gauteng) during 2008.\n\nRVF outbreaks are associated either with spread of a single genotype\nor with simultaneous emergence of multiple genotypes in endemic foci.\nRVF virus isolates recovered during the last decade in southern and\neastern Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, Mauritania, and Madagascar\nexhibit little genetic diversity, which indicates recent widespread\ndistribution of very closely related genotypes of the virus over a\nvast area. Various isolates recovered from humans, cattle and buffalo\nin Mpumalanga, Limpopo, North West and Gauteng in 2008 and in\nKwazulu-Natal in February/March 2009 are genetically almost identical\nand very similar to isolates from eastern Africa, the Arabian\nPeninsula, Mauritania, and Madagascar, but the recent isolate from\nNorthern Cape is genetically different. All laboratory confirmed\nhuman cases (n = 25) in 2008-2009 in South Africa had very close\ncontact with infected animals and/or their tissues, including the 2\nmost recent cases in Northern Cape. There have been no!\nmortalities.\n\nRVF virus was 1st isolated in 1930 following an epizootic on a sheep\nfarm in the Rift Valley in Kenya and historically was endemic to\nsub-Saharan Africa, but in the last 4 decades spread to Egypt, West\nAfrica and most recently to the Arabian Peninsula and the Archipelago\nof Comoros, including the French Department of Mayotte. Humans become\ninfected from contact with tissues of infected animals or from\nmosquito bite, and usually develop asymptomatic, mild or moderate\nfebrile illness. Severe complications that may be life-threatening\ndevelop only in a small proportion of infected patients, but\nsubstantial numbers of people may succumb to infection during large\noutbreaks of the disease in livestock. Large outbreaks of RVF in\ndomestic ruminants occur at irregular intervals when exceptionally\nheavy rains favour the breeding and high abundance of competent\nmosquito vectors, and are associated with high mortality among\nnewborn animals and abortion in pregnant animals.\n\nA major epizootic, which caused an estimated 500 000 abortions and\n100 000 deaths of sheep, occurred in 1950-1951 in South Africa. The\n2nd major and more widespread outbreak in South Africa caused\nextensive losses of ruminants in 1974-1976. Small outbreaks of RVF or\nsporadic virus isolations of the virus were recorded in South Africa\nin 1981 and 1999 and most recently in 2008-2009. Compared to\nhistorical outbreaks of RVF in South Africa, the recent outbreaks\nappear to be very localized and affected relatively small numbers of\nanimals and humans. This might be due to the low level of endemicity\nof RVF in the country, where prolonged dry spells since the 1974-76\nhave limited virus activity. However, the present cases diagnosed\nearly in the wet season this year might indicate increasing activity\nof the virus in the country.\n\n[Byline: JT Paweska, A Grobbelaar, J Weyer, P Leman, L Blumberg and B\nSwanepoel]\n\n--\nProf. Janusz T.

Quoting government medical sources, the official\nSaudi press agency SPA had at the time announced 33 cases of RVF\nillness in Jeddah and 103 in Mecca since the beginning of the month.\n\nThe daily Okaz had, on 12 Apr 2009, reported that a Saudi man and\nwoman, aged respectively 20 and 22 years old, afflicted by the virus,\nhad finally succumbed the previous day at King Faisal hospital in\nMecca. The following day, other newspapers had reported the\nhospitalisation in Mecca of more than 100 people affected by the\ndisease.

Infection can\ncause severe disease in both animals and humans, leading to high\nrates of disease and death. The disease also results in significant\neconomic losses due to death and abortion among RVF-infected\nlivestock. Outbreaks of rift Valley fever in the human population are\nusually preceded by extensive outbreaks of disease in livestock,\ntherefore the current report from Saudi Arabia should be treated with caution.\n\nAccording to the World Health Organisation Fact Sheet\n(<http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs207/en/index.html>) The\nvast majority of human infections result from direct or indirect\ncontact with the blood or organs of infected animals. The virus can\nbe transmitted to humans through the handling of animal tissue during\nslaughtering or butchering, assisting with animal births, conducting\nveterinary procedures, or from the disposal of carcasses or fetuses.\nCertain occupational groups such as herders, farmers, slaughterhouse\nworkers and veterinarians are therefore at higher risk of infection.\nThe virus infects humans through inoculation, for example via a wound\nfrom an infected knife or through contact with broken skin, or\nthrough inhalation of aerosols produced during the slaughter of\ninfected animals. There is some evidence that humans may also become\ninfected with RVF by ingesting the unpasteurized or uncooked milk of\ninfected animals.\n\nHuman infections have also resulted from the bites of infected\nmosquitoes, most commonly the _Aedes_ spp., and transmission of\nRVF virus by hematophagous (blood-feeding) flies is also possible.\n\nTo date, no human-to-human transmission of RVF has been documented,\nand no transmission of RVF to health care workers has been reported\nwhen standard infection control precautions have been put in place.\nThere has been no evidence of outbreaks of RVF in urban areas. - Mod.CP]\n\n[A map of Saudi Arabia is available at\n<http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/cia08/saudi_arabia_sm_2008.gif>. - CopyEd.EJP]", "summary": "A ProMED-mail post\n<http://www.promedmail.org>\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\n<http://www.isid.org>\n\nDate: Sun 31 May 2009\n \nSeveral newspapers and websites have rung alarm bells and warned\nagainst a new epidemic of Rift Valley fever [RVF] virus, a virus\nmainly transmitted by mosquitoes, that decimates mainly the animal\nbut also [affects] the human population. \n\nThe daily Okaz had, on 12 Apr 2009, reported that a Saudi man and\nwoman, aged respectively 20 and 22 years old, afflicted by the virus,\nhad finally succumbed the previous day at King Faisal hospital in\nMecca.

The man was initially diagnosed with an unknown type\nof fever and elevated liver enzyme levels, both indicators of the RVF.\n\nThe Asir Agriculture Department has recently acted on media reports\nof suspected cattle infected with the disease in different villages\nin the region by sending specimens from there for lab analysis in\nRiyadh for immunoglobulin M (IgM). The lab tests were positive for\nIgM, antibody to Rift Valley fever virus in domestic ruminants.\n\n'There are strong suspicions of the RVF outbreak again in the region,\nbut they are still not confirmed,' said Mubark Al-Mutalqah, director\nof the Asir Agriculture Department. The symptoms could be either a\nreal viral infection or a side effect of the antibody injection\npreviously used on the animals to ward off the virus, he said. 'We\nare still waiting for the final lab reports from the Ministry of\nHealth and the Ministry of Agriculture to confirm the source of the\nIgM as we are closely monitoring the area,' he said.\n\nIf the disease were confirmed, the government agencies would work\nhard to combat it through sending planes to spray insecticide to kill\nthe mosquitoes, which are thought to be spreading the disease. RVF is\na mosquito-borne zoonotic disease affecting domestic ungulates\n(especially goats and sheep) characterized by large epizootics during\nperiods of heavy rainfall with associated outbreaks in humans. Most\nhuman infection is associated with an uncomplicated febrile illness\nor is unapparent.\n\nMore severe complications include retinitis, hepatitis, renal\nfailure, hemorrhagic fever, encephalitis, and death. According to\nrecent research, if the disease breaks out, it may be transmitted in\nan approximately 600 km (373 mi) area, including the flood plains of\nthe wadis [valleys] extending from the Sarawat mountains to the Red\nSea coastal plains. The duration from disease onset to\nhospitalization is 3.3 days and the average time from disease onset\nto death is 6.3 days. [References to the said data -- probably\nderived from previous Saudi observations -- will be appreciated. In\nany event, the generally acceptable data on case fatality rate of RVF\nin humans does not exceed 1-2 percent. - Mod.AS]\n\nA Health Ministry report said Rift Valley fever killed 124 people in\nthe Kingdom between September 2000 and May 2001, while 760 of the 884\ninfected people recovered.\n\nThe Kingdom has since either banned or carefully examined the import\nof livestock from several African countries as well as from Yemen.\n\nAlthough Rift Valley Fever was first identified in 1930, after an\nepidemic among sheep in Kenya, it has also affected Egypt,\nMadagascar, Mauritania, and Somalia, according to the World Health\nOrganization.\n\n[Byline: Fahd Al-Rubai, Al-Hassan Al-Sayyid]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[For the Asir province in southwest Saudi Arabia, bordering Yemen, see map at\n<http://www.maplandia.com/saudi-arabia/asir/>.\nThe HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map of Saudi Arabia is available at\n<http://healthmap.org/promed/en?g=108180&v=21,42,5>.\n\nIn case the described suspected human RVF case is confirmed, this is\nbad news since it may be indicative of RVF virus circulation in Saudi\nArabia, provided the patient was not infected elsewhere (East\nAfrica?). If confirmed, RVF must already have involved (undetected or\nunreported) infections in ruminants, particularly sheep and goats.\nThe virus can spread by vectors (mosquitoes) and by exposure of\nhumans or susceptible animals to infected tissues.\n\nThe most striking features, expected in (unvaccinated) ruminants, are\nmass abortions and mortality of offspring (which -- in the most\nsusceptible animals, namely lambs younger than 4 weeks -- may reach\nalmost 100 percent). The timing of the current event is most\nunfortunate: the Hajj (annual pilgrimage to Mecca) is due to start in\njust 3 days, on 6 Dec 2008. The Eid-ul-Adha (Festival of the\nSacrifice), when millions of ruminants will be slaughtered, is due on\n8 Dec 2008. The expected influx of over 2 million pilgrims for the\nHajj, as well as the presence of a large migrant population, generate\nhigh human and animal traffic that present a challenging agenda for\npublic health. Returning pilgrims may, if infected, transfer the\nvirus to other regions.\n\nThe Saudi authorities are expected to take the appropriate measures\navoiding the introduction into Mecca of animals from the south and\nprescribing intensive veterinary inspection of the slaughtering\nprocess, particularly antemortem inspections. Infection of humans\nwith the RVF virus may occur by their exposure to organs,\nparticularly blood, of viraemic animals. Reportedly, the exposure of\nhumans to aerosols in slaughtering facilities and home slaughtering,\nduring the major 1977-78 epizootic in Egypt, was a main contributor\nto the very high morbidity and mortality observed.\n\nThe potential risks within this period as well as other peculiar\necological factors have been discussed in the paper, 'The evolving\ntransmission pattern of Rift Valley fever in the Arabian peninsula'\nby Shamsudeen F Fagbo, Ann N Y Acad Sci 969: 201-4 (2002) (abstract\navailable at\n<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12381591?dopt=Abstract>).\n\nSaudi Arabia initially reported the presence of RVF during 2000 and\nthe 1st quarter of 2001.

Infection can\ncause severe disease in both animals and humans, leading to high\nrates of disease and death. The disease also results in significant\neconomic losses due to death and abortion among RVF-infected\nlivestock. The virus was first identified in 1931 during an\ninvestigation into an epidemic among sheep on a farm in the Rift\nValley of Kenya. Since then, outbreaks have been reported in\nsub-Saharan and North Africa. In 1997-1998, a major outbreak occurred\nin Kenya, Somalia, and Tanzania and in September 2000, RVF cases were\nconfirmed in Saudi Arabia and Yemen.\n\nThe vast majority of human infections result from direct or indirect\ncontact with the blood or organs of infected animals. The virus can\nbe transmitted to humans through the handling of animal tissue during\nslaughtering or butchering, assisting with animal births, conducting\nveterinary procedures, or from the disposal of carcasses or fetuses.\nThere is some evidence that humans may also become infected with RVF\nby ingesting the unpasteurized or uncooked milk of infected animals.\nHuman infections have also resulted from the bites of infected\nmosquitoes, most commonly the _Aedes_ mosquito. Transmission of RVF\nvirus by hematophagous (blood-feeding) flies is also possible. To\ndate, no human-to-human transmission of RVF has been documented.\n\nFor a comprehensive account of Rift Valley fever disease in animals\nand humans, the World Health Organisation (WHO) overview of the\ndisease can be accessed at\n<http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs207/en/>.\n\nPreviously Bird et al. published an analysis of the complete genome\nsequences of 33 ecologically and biologically diverse Rift Valley\nfever virus strains isolated from humans and animals in Africa (J\nVirol. 2007; 81(6): 2805-16; <http://jvi.asm.org/cgi/content/full/81/6/2805>).\n\nSeveral distinct virus genetic lineages were determined, which\napproximately correlated with geographic origin, but several\nexceptions indicative of long-distance virus movement were found.\nVirus genetic diversity was low and primarily involved accumulation\nof mutations at an average of 2.9 x 10(-4) substitutions/site/year,\nalthough some evidence of genome subunit reassortment was found.\n\nThe current publication describes an in-depth analysis of viruses\nisolated during the course of the extensive outbreak that occurred in\nthe Garissa district of Kenya and Somalia in 2006-2007. Continuity\nwith earlier outbreaks and with viruses isolated during the\ninter-epidemic period was observed. Several distinct virus lineages\nwere circulating during the 2006-2007 outbreak and diversity was\nincreased by genetic reassortment during the course of the outbreak.\nIt is evident from this analysis that the genomic diversity of Rift\nValley fever virus is increasing and that the virus is continuing to\nevolve both within and between epidemic periods.\n\nThe HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map of Kenya is available at\n<http://healthmap.org/promed?v=0.5,37.9,6>. - Mod.CP]", "summary": "At: Special Pathogens Branch, Division of Viral and Rickettsial\nDiseases, Coordinating Center for Infectious Diseases, and\nBiotechnology Core Facility Branch, Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention, 1600 Clifton Road MS G-14 Atlanta, GA 30329, USA;\nMinistry of Livestock and Fisheries Development, Department of\nVeterinary Services, Kabete, Kenya; University of California, Davis,\nSchool of Veterinary Medicine, Davis, CA 95616.

In response to the moderator's request for information in the posting\n'Rift Valley fever - Saudi Arabia: (Asir) suspected, RFI 20081203.3798:'\nFirstly, please note that RVF vaccination in Saudi Arabia is applied in\nyoung animals using the live attenuated RVF Smithburn strain vaccine (Ref\n1). More details can be found in the said paper and in Ref 2.\n\n2. As to the moderator's hint at a possible East African source, the\npossibility of other RVFV-like viruses being involved arises. I would like\nto remind the reader that during the 1997/98 outbreak in East Africa,\nclinical pictures similar to RVF eventually turned out to be caused by\nanother member of the _Bunyaviridae_, named Garissa virus (Ref 3). Possible\ninvolvement of other Bunyaviruses deserves consideration also in view of\nthe lack of observed disease symptoms characteristic of RVF in reportedly\ninfected animals.\n\n3. The suggested endemicity of RVFV in Saudi Arabia is supported by\nevidence from a government lab in the RVF-prone area. In 2004, the Ministry\nof Agric workers detected local natural infection in sentinel animals used\nin surveillance programs (Ref 1). There were no camels amongst the sentinel\nanimals.\n\n4. The role of camels in the emergence and spread of RVF in the region\nseems not to be given much attention, as shown in local surveys (Ref 2). A\npublished sero-surveillance report on camels detected one single RVF\nIgG-positive camel among 496 animals tested (0.2 per cent) (Ref 4). Details\non exactly where and when the positive sample was taken as well as\ninformation on confirmation of the Indirect ELISA used by other means or\nfurther investigations are not given. These authors again acknowledge the\npresent lack of camel sentinels. Camels are known to move through extensive\nareas that again present exposure determination challenges. Sadly, little\nis still known of RVF pathogenicity in camels. In addition, most of the\nvaluable ELISA protocols are not validated for this species. However,\ncamels are susceptible, and their movements between the Gulf States (Ref 5)\nmay constitute a risk pathway that needs to be evaluated. This is of\nparticular importance to neighbouring countries like UAE where efforts are\nbeing made to export camel products to Europe. The need to increase\ncamel-related RVF monitoring/research cannot be overemphasized.\n\n5. Even though enzootic, possible routes of RVFV reintroduction still\nexist. The government is well aware of this potential problem, and strict\nrequirements are said to have been applied for newly permitted livestock\nimports from Sudan and Eritrea. However, the potential for entry via\nnontraditional routes remains. Private zoos and individuals in the region\ndo import susceptible wildlife from RVF endemic regions of Africa; these\nmay not be adequately covered by local RVF surveillance and thus may\ncontribute to undetected local transmission. While efforts to better\nunderstand the role of wildlife in RVF inter-epizootic maintenance are\nstill ongoing, there is evidence that wildlife is actively infected by RVF.\nAs reported in postings 20080210.0541 and 20080701.2012, RVF-affected\nbuffaloes have passed infection to humans in South Africa earlier this year\n[2008]; such animals are found in private zoos.\n\n6. The report on the Asir suspected human case says: 'The man was initially\ndiagnosed with an unknown type of fever and elevated liver enzyme levels,\nboth indicators of RVF.' With the RVFV specific IgM unconfirmed,\ndifferential diagnoses such as dengue and Alkhurmah haemorrhagic fever\nviruses come to mind; they should receive more consideration if the initial\nIgM turns out to be false positive. The latter virus is thought to be\nunder-diagnosed.\n\n7. Statements such as 'the symptoms could be either a real viral infection\nor a side effect of the antibody injection previously used on the animals\nto ward off the virus' are really confusing and may be due to translation\nerrors from an Arabic original as well as inaccuracy in reporting\ninfectious diseases by the media. This was experienced in the 1st RVF\noutbreak in 2000. In the same light, the use of the term 'cattle' should be\ninterpreted cautiously, since the word 'mawaashi' (which means livestock)\nin Arabic has in past reports been mistranslated to 'cattle,' erroneously\nexcluding other livestock, particularly small ruminants. Susceptible sheep\nand goats are, generally, more ubiquitous than cattle in these regions.\n\n8. The above quoted statement further indicates lack of clarity regarding\nthe RVF vaccination status of the animals in the affected area. The risk of\nreversion to virulence does exist with live attenuated vaccines; these\nvaccines also do not allow for the differential identification between\ninfected and vaccinated animals [DIVA] (Ref 6); it would be interesting to\nsee the local adoption/trial of the new DIVA recombinant RVF vaccine\ndeveloped by these authors. Without more evidence, especially evidence\ngenerated using molecular tools to sequence and characterize any virus\nisolated, it would be difficult to trace the source of the virus. Using\nsuch protocols, it might have been possible to judge the possibility of\nvaccine reversion.\n\n9. If and when RVF is confirmed (which is not the case so far), the\npotential risks for pilgrims in Makkah is not one that can be easily\nextrapolated. A general analysis of such potential risks was given by Glyn\nDavies in his paper 2 years ago (Ref 7). However, since he probably did not\nhave the opportunity to be present on location during the pilgrimage\nitself, may I add several other dynamic variables for consideration. One's\nfamiliarity with the Haj rites, abattoirs and fellow veterinarians there\nmay enable suggesting that risk exposure pathways vary greatly amongst the\npilgrims, who come from virtually all over the world. A generalized risk\nanalysis may not be possible: Potential exposure pathways can only be\ndeveloped by factoring in these various dynamic variables. These variables\ndepend on the pilgrims' nationalities and the attendant cultural\ndiversities expressed by the country of origin, purchasing power, etc. Even\nintra-national variations in potential risk exposure patterns will and do\nexist. For example, not all pilgrims are required to slaughter an animal.\nHow many pilgrims opt for this and why? How many of them carry out the\nslaughter and subsequently consume the slaughtered meat? Going into such\ndetails is far beyond the scope of a comment here. It should be noted that\nseveral official sanitary, risk reducing measures have been operational for\nmany years. For example, there is a system of coupon-mediated proxy\nslaughter that limits access of pilgrims to live animals and coordinates\nanimal movement. It is, however, not known how many of the pilgrims make\nuse of this facility and at what level. The government has also limited\noutward movement of animals from the Makkah area [see item 2]. However, it\nis not clear whether the mentioned measures will cover other routes of\ntransmission, namely mosquitoes and nontraditional hosts. Stray cats are\npotential nontraditional alternative hosts. They are present in enormous\nnumbers in the Makkah region; they can easily access abattoirs, carcasses,\nas well as provide meals for abundant tiger mosquitoes, _Aedes (Stegomyia)\nalbopictus_, which feed on animals and humans.\n\n10. What further abates any fear of a massive RVF epizootic is the fact\nthat, though there were heavy rains in the RVF-endemic areas in early\nNovember 2008, the expected interval for trans-ovarially infected\nmosquitoes to erupt and infect susceptible animals/humans, followed by a\nshort incubation period, can be said to have elapsed. However, this does\nnot obviate the need to confirm post rain fall vector dynamics and confirm\nwhether local RVF epizootics will not be always similar to the rainfall\nassociated patterns in East Africa.\n\nIn summary, while a risk does exist for RVF transmission, its full\nevaluation requires detailed information on local conditions and on ground\nrisk parameters. Until confirmed, there is no need to stoke up fears.\nProactive preventive measures can be heightened. Whenever confirmed,\nanalytical risk deductions are best done on a nationality to nationality\nbasis. It is also hoped that the new risk levels will increase commitment\nto research on this and other arboviral zoonoses.\n\nReferences\n1. Elfadil AA, Hasab-Allah KA, Dafa-Allah OM, Elmanea AA.

A\npublished sero-surveillance report on camels detected one single RVF\nIgG-positive camel among 496 animals tested (0.2 per cent) For example, there is a system of coupon-mediated proxy\nslaughter that limits access of pilgrims to live animals and coordinates\nanimal movement. In summary, while a risk does exist for RVF transmission, its full\nevaluation requires detailed information on local conditions and on ground\nrisk parameters. Firstly, please note that RVF vaccination in Saudi Arabia is applied in\nyoung animals using the live attenuated RVF Smithburn strain vaccine (Ref\n1). A generalized risk\nanalysis may not be possible: Potential exposure pathways can only be\ndeveloped by factoring in these various dynamic variables. Without more evidence, especially evidence\ngenerated using molecular tools to sequence and characterize any virus\nisolated, it would be difficult to trace the source of the virus. Ngari Virus is a Bunyamwera\nvirus reassortant that can be associated with large outbreaks of\nhemorrhagic fever in Africa. The government is well aware of this potential problem, and strict\nrequirements are said to have been applied for newly permitted livestock\nimports from Sudan and Eritrea. The report on the Asir suspected human case says: 'The man was initially\ndiagnosed with an unknown type of fever and elevated liver enzyme levels,\nboth indicators of RVF.' The ministry has provided additional staff for Makkah Region's land and\nsea entry points in order to deal with the increasing number of livestock\narriving in Jeddah. \n\n\nAuthorities have imposed a ban on removing livestock from Makkah during\nHaj, Dr Fahd Balghunaim, minister of agriculture, said here on Saturday [6\n Even\nintra-national variations in potential risk exposure patterns will and do\nexist. In response to the moderator's request for information in the posting\n'Rift Valley fever - Saudi Arabia: (Asir) suspected, RFI 20081203.3798:'\n However,\ncamels are susceptible, and their movements between the Gulf States (Ref 5)\nmay constitute a risk pathway that needs to be evaluated. RIFT VALLEY FEVER - SAUDI ARABIA (02): (ASIR), SUSPECTED\n********************************************************\n While efforts to better\nunderstand the role of wildlife in RVF inter-epizootic maintenance are\nstill ongoing, there is evidence that wildlife is actively infected by RVF. If and when RVF is confirmed (which is not the case so far), the\npotential risks for pilgrims in Makkah is not one that can be easily\nextrapolated. However, it\nis not clear whether the mentioned measures will cover other routes of\ntransmission, namely mosquitoes and nontraditional hosts. These variables\ndepend on the pilgrims' nationalities and the attendant cultural\ndiversities expressed by the country of origin, purchasing power, etc. It should be noted that\nseveral official sanitary, risk reducing measures have been operational for\nmany years. Whenever confirmed,\nanalytical risk deductions are best done on a nationality to nationality\nbasis.

Infection can\ncause severe disease in both animals and humans, leading to high\nrates of disease and death. The disease also results in significant\neconomic losses due to death and abortion among RVF-infected\nlivestock.'\n\n(Human disease is preceded by animal disease and the cases of human\ndisease described in the preceding report are indicative of the\nexistence of extensive disease in livestock. Rift Valley fever virus\nhas circulated in livestock in Madagascar for several years -- see\nthe ProMED-mail references listed below. - Mod.CP)\n\n'RVF virus is a member of the genus _Phlebovirus_, one of the 5\ngenera in the family _Bunyaviridae_. The virus was 1st identified in\n1931 during an investigation into an epidemic among sheep on a farm\nin the Rift Valley of Kenya. Since then, outbreaks have been reported\nin sub-Saharan and North Africa. In 1997-98, a major outbreak\noccurred in Kenya, Somalia and Tanzania and in September 2000, RVF\ncases were confirmed in Saudi Arabia and Yemen, marking the 1st\nreported occurrence of the disease outside the African continent and\nraising concerns that it could extend to other parts of Asia and\nEurope.\n\n'The vast majority of human infections result from direct or indirect\ncontact with the blood or organs of infected animals. The virus can\nbe transmitted to humans through the handling of animal tissue during\nslaughtering or butchering, assisting with animal births, conducting\nveterinary procedures, or from the disposal of carcasses or fetuses.\n\n'Certain occupational groups such as herders, farmers, slaughterhouse\nworkers and veterinarians are therefore at higher risk of infection.\nThe virus infects humans through inoculation; for example, via a\nwound from an infected knife or through contact with broken skin, or\nthrough inhalation of aerosols produced during the slaughter of\ninfected animals. The aerosol mode of transmission has also led to\ninfection in laboratory workers.\n\n'There is some evidence that humans may also become infected with RVF\nby ingesting the unpasteurized or uncooked milk of infected animals.\nHuman infections have also resulted from the bites of infected\nmosquitoes, most commonly the _Aedes_ mosquito. Transmission of RVF\nvirus by hematophagous (blood-feeding) flies is also possible.\n\n'To date, no human-to-human transmission of RVF has been documented,\nand no transmission of RVF to health care workers has been reported\nwhen standard infection control precautions have been put in place.\nThere has been no evidence of outbreaks of RVF in urban areas. In\nmild form of RVF in humans the incubation period (interval from\ninfection to onset of symptoms) for RVF varies from 2 to 6 days.\nThose infected either experience no detectable symptoms or develop a\nmild form of the disease characterized by a feverish syndrome with\nsudden onset of flu-like fever, muscle pain, joint pain and\nheadache.Some patients develop neck stiffness, sensitivity to light,\nloss of appetite and vomiting; in these patients the disease, in its\nearly stages, may be mistaken for meningitis. The symptoms of RVF\nusually last from 4 to 7 days, after which time the immune response\nbecomes detectable with the appearance of antibodies and the virus\ngradually disappears from the blood.\n\n'While most human cases are relatively mild, a small percentage of\npatients develop a much more severe form of the disease. This usually\nappears as one or more of 3 distinct syndromes: ocular (eye) disease\n(0.5-2 percent of patients), meningoencephalitis (less than 1\npercent) or haemorrhagic fever (less than 1 percent).\n\n'The total case fatality rate has varied widely between different\nepidemics but, overall, has been less than 1 percent in those\ndocumented. Most fatalities occur in patients who develop the\nhaemorrhagic icterus form. An inactivated vaccine has been developed\nfor human use. However, this vaccine is not licensed and is not\ncommercially available. It has been used experimentally to protect\nveterinary and laboratory personnel at high risk of exposure to RVF.\nOther candidate vaccines are under investigation.\n\n'Forecasting can predict climatic conditions that are frequently\nassociated with an increased risk of outbreaks, and may improve\ndisease control. In Africa, Saudi Arabia and Yemen RVF outbreaks are\nclosely associated with periods of above-average rainfall. The\nresponse of vegetation to increased levels of rainfall can be easily\nmeasured and monitored by Remote Sensing Satellite Imagery.

Infection can cause\nsevere disease in both animals and humans, leading to high rates of disease\nand death. The disease also results in significant economic losses due to\ndeath and abortion among RVF-infected livestock.\n\n'RVF virus is a member of the _Phlebovirus_ genus, one of the 5 genera in\nthe family _Bunyaviridae_. The virus was 1st identified in 1931 during an\ninvestigation into an epidemic among sheep on a farm in the Rift Valley of\nKenya. Since then, outbreaks have been reported in sub-Saharan and North\nAfrica. In 1997-1998, a major outbreak occurred in Kenya, Somalia and\nTanzania and in September 2000, RVF cases were confirmed in Saudi Arabia\nand Yemen, marking the 1st reported occurrence of the disease outside the\nAfrican continent and raising concerns that it could extend to other parts\nof Asia and Europe.\n\n'The vast majority of human infections result from direct or indirect\ncontact with the blood or organs of infected animals. The virus can be\ntransmitted to humans through the handling of animal tissue during\nslaughtering or butchering, assisting with animal births, conducting\nveterinary procedures, or from the disposal of carcasses or fetuses.\nCertain occupational groups such as herders, farmers, slaughterhouse\nworkers and veterinarians are therefore at higher risk of infection.

'The fatality rate is 29 per cent (with) haemorrhagic fever.\n(And) we have about 5 or 6 cases of eye manifestation [an infrequent\nconsequence of Rift Valley fever - Mod.CP],' said spokesman Magdi Saleh.\nBut the government denied there were any confirmed cases in cattle, a main\nsource of income for many Sudanese in the agricultural economy, or in\nsheep. Rumours of the virus caused panic among Sudanese Muslims as they\ncelebrated Eid al-Adha which began on Wednesday with the slaughtering of\nsheep to remember Abraham who was prepared to sacrifice his son for God. 'I\nam still not sure whether to slaughter or not,' said trader Mohamed Omer.\nHe said he did not trust the government's directive to go ahead and\nslaughter sheep for the holiday.\nRumours of dead animals in Khartoum with blood streaming from their mouths\nare rife. Some of the poor who go to people's houses during the holiday to\nget food refused to take raw meat this year. The price of powdered milk\nrose in the market as people became too scared to drink fresh milk. The\nministry of animal resources said a batch of samples of animal blood from\nan isolated area in While Nile State came back 25 per cent positive for\nantibodies of the virus.\n'(But) the positive results were as a result of antibodies maybe due to\nvaccinations or due to past infection,' spokesman Abdel Moneim said.

In 2000, the disease was seen\noutside of Africa for the 1st time in Saudi Arabia and Yemen. It has\nalso been seen in countries in West Africa, including Mauritania and\nSenegal. Rift Valley fever (RVF) was last seen in South Africa in\n1999 and, prior to that outbreak, in 1991. The last OIE disease RVF\nreport from Zimbabwe was in 2001; Zambia in 1997; Malawi in 2002;\nNamibia in 1985; Mozambique in 1963, Madagascar in 1991; Botswana,\nLesotho and Swaziland have never reported RVF. This outbreak in\nMpumalunga is, however, quite close to Zwaziland and a little further\naway from the southwestern border of Kruger National Park. See\n<http://www.traveljournals.net/explore/south_africa/map/m1842803/ngwenya_hills.html>\nor the OIE reference above.\n\nThe current RVF outbreak in Sudan has resulted in 698 human cases and\n222 deaths. Human disease is usually preceded by a significant animal\ndisease event, which is not the case in this outbreak in South\nAfrica. Vaccination is the best way to control a disease outbreak in\nanimals and helps to control the subsequent transmission of RVF to\nhumans. Outbreaks are preceded by excessive rainfall, which promotes\nlarge populations of the mosquito vectors which transmit the disease\namong animals.\n\nAccording to the WHO RVF website\n<http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs207/en>,\ntransmission occurs in the following manner:\n\n'The vast majority of human infections result from direct or indirect\ncontact with the blood or organs of infected animals. The virus can\nbe transmitted to humans through the handling of animal tissue during\nslaughtering or butchering, assisting with animal births, conducting\nveterinary procedures, or from the disposal of carcasses or fetuses.\nCertain occupational groups such as herders, farmers, slaughterhouse\nworkers and veterinarians are therefore at higher risk of infection.\nThe virus infects humans through inoculation, for example via a wound\nfrom an infected knife or through contact with broken skin, or\nthrough inhalation of aerosols produced during the slaughter of\ninfected animals. The aerosol mode of transmission has also led to\ninfection in laboratory workers. There is some evidence that humans\nmay also become infected with RVF by ingesting the unpasteurized or\nuncooked milk of infected animals. Human infections have also\nresulted from the bites of infected mosquitoes, most commonly the\n_Aedes_ mosquito. Transmission of RVF virus by hematophagous\n(blood-feeding) flies is also possible. To date, no human-to-human\ntransmission of RVF has been documented, and no transmission of RVF\nto health care workers has been reported when standard infection\ncontrol precautions have been put in place. There has been no\nevidence of outbreaks of RVF in urban areas.'\n\nOf note, the laboratory providing the diagnosis, OVI, is celebrating\nits 100th anniversary this year (2008) and is one of the world's\ngreat animal diagnostic laboratories, founded by Sir Arnold Theiler.\nTheiler, a veterinarian by training, first made his mark preparing\nvaccines used in an outbreak of smallpox in Witswatersrand in 1893.\nHe subsequently was the first to characterize East Coast fever and\nmade significant progress in combating piroplasmosis, anaplasmosis,\nrhinderpest and African horse sickness.

RFV is a viral\ndisease currently wreaking havoc in East Africa, especially in Sudan.\nHealth authorities fear an epidemic in the Comoros. Pending\nconfirmation of the presence of the disease in the livestock\npopulation of the Comoros, surveillance is being reinforced\nthroughout the islands.\n\nLast August [2007], a boy, 12 years old, living in Moroni (Grande\nComore Island) was transferred to a hospital in Mayotte. He had\ndeveloped symptoms 3 months previously, and it was confirmed in\nSeptember 2007 by the National Reference Center (NRC) in Lyon that\nthe boy was a case of RVF.\n\nAt present, the boy is hospitalized in Mayotte in critical condition.\n'He has [severe] neurological symptoms,' says Pierre Vincent,\nCoordinator of the Epidemiology Centre (Wax) in Mayotte. The boy, a\nresident of Moroni, has apparently contracted infection from a sick\nindigenous animal. Since neither the child nor a relative had visited\nEast Africa, an outbreak of RVF among livestock in Grande Comore is\nsuspected.\n\nThe Health Authorities are anxious to assess the risk of a spread of\ninfection in livestock. Two weeks ago, the veterinary services of\nMayotte dispatched 100 test samples to the Ministry of Health of the\nComoros so that the extent of any infection of the animal population\ncould be estimated. These samples have been sent to the Centre for\nInternational Cooperation in Agronomic Research (CIRAD) in\nMontpellier. The results are not yet known, but, already, Dr. Pierre\nVincent 'feared an outbreak in the Comoros.'\n\n'However, the situation has not alarmed our authorities. We cannot\nconsider that the risk is significant,' stated Dr Vincent. According\nto Dr Nicolas Krieger, deputy director of the Directorate of\nVeterinary Services (DSV), no ruminants or their products have been\nexported to Europe from countries where this disease is endemic. All\nlivestock (cattle, sheep and goats) and animal products imported into\nthe Comoros have originated from France and other countries of the\nEuropean Union. Furthermore, even if the virus can be transmitted via\nthe _Aedes albopictus_ mosquito, the disease could not be transmitted\n[to humans and from human to human by mosquitoes] without the\nexistence of infected livestock to amplify the virus. The WAX\nCoordinator stated that: 'Man does not participate in the development\ncycle of the disease, because the virus does not multiply\nsufficiently in the blood. Mosquitoes, therefore, can only acquire an\ninfectious dose by feeding on domestic livestock.\n\nThe Health Authorities nonetheless remain on their guard. 'We also\nknow that RVF is endemic in Madagascar,' said Dr. Vincent.\n'Consequently, we have continued the surveillance measures which were\nput in place following the outbreak of cholera in the Comoros. There\nis always strict control of goods and materials imported into the\nComoros.'\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The Comoro Islands are an archipelago lying between Madagascar and\nthe African continent. The main islands are Grande Comore, Anjouan,\nMoheli and Mayotte. The islands are volcanic in origin. Politically,\nthe islands are divided into 2 entities: Comoros, a sovereign state,\nand Mayotte, an overseas collectivity of France. A map of the Comoros\nIslands can be accessed at\n<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comoro_Islands>.\n\nRVF virus can cause several different disease syndromes. People with\nRVF typically have either no symptoms or a mild illness associated\nwith fever and liver abnormalities. However, in some patients, the\nillness can progress to hemorrhagic fever (which can lead to shock or\nhemorrhage), encephalitis (inflammation of the brain, which can lead\nto headaches, coma, or seizures), or ocular disease (diseases\naffecting the eye). Patients who become ill usually experience fever,\ngeneralized weakness, back pain, dizziness, and extreme weight loss\nat the onset of the illness. Typically, patients recover within 2\ndays to one week after onset of illness. The most common complication\nassociated with RVF is inflammation of the retina (a structure\nconnecting the nerves of the eye to the brain). As a result,\napproximately 1-10 percent of affected patients may have some\npermanent vision loss. Approximately one percent of humans that\nbecome infected with RVF die of the disease. Case-fatality\nproportions are significantly higher for infected animals. The most\nsevere impact is observed in pregnant livestock infected with RVF,\nwhich results in abortion of virtually 100 percent of fetuses.\n\nThis rather confused report indicates that a single human case of RVF\nhas been confirmed in the Comoros, although this requires independent\nconfirmation, as the symptoms and severity of the disease are\nunusual. The patient has no known link with RVF endemic regions in\nEast Africa, therefore it has been inferred, but not yet established,\nthat the infection occurred by transmission from an infected animal\non the Comoros. Further information is awaited that would confirm\nthis extension of RVF beyond its presently known range. - Mod.CP]\n\n[Identification of RVF in the Comoros should not come as a surprise;\nit is in the Indian Ocean between the RVF-endemic territories of\nTanzania/Mozambique and northern Madagascar (map at\n<http://content.answers.com/main/content/wp/en/d/d9/Comoros_in_relation_to_Afrika_map.jpg>).\nTanzania suffered an RVF outbreak earlier in 2007; Madagascar is also\nknown to be endemically infected. In 1982, the Zinga virus,\nprevailing in Madagascar, was identified by the WHO Reference\nlaboratory for Arboviruses in Yale as RVF virus.\n\nAccording to unofficial assessments, the livestock population of the\nFederal Islamic Republic of Comores is as follows: cattle - 51 000;\ngoats - 115 000 - 170 000; sheep - 20 000.

RVF\nis a dangerous mosquito-borne zoonotic disease affecting ruminants\nand humans. People contract infection through mosquito bites or\ndirect contact with infected biological material and liquids such as\nblood during slaughtering or when handling animal abortions.\n\nWhile sometimes difficult to identify, usually RVF is already well\nestablished in animal populations by the time the 1st human cases are observed.\n\n'The source of RVF in animals needs to be identified and veterinary\ncontrol measures put in place in order to reduce the public health\nrisk, to limit the impact on livelihoods and to avoid further\nspread,' said J. Domenech, Chief Veterinary Officer of FAO. This is\nof particular importance during this time of the year given that\nmajor trade movements of ruminants are expected because of the\nupcoming Muslim religious events, the Hajj and Eid Al-Adha. [The Hajj\nbegins 18 Dec 2007; Eid Al-Adha is on 20 Dec 2007. - Mod.AS] He\nemphasized the importance of informing population groups at risk on\nmeasures that may be applied to protect people from becoming\ninfected. FAO closely monitors the developments and has offered\ntechnical assistance to Sudan to support animal disease investigation\nand animal management aspects.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Unfortunately -- similarly to numerous past cases -- RVF has been\nagain detected by human rather than animal sentinels. And contrary to\nthe previous outbreak in Somalia, Kenya and Tanzania which began at\nthe end of 2006, the current outbreak has not been preceded by a\nwarning based upon climatic-ecological analyses.\n\nUp to now, no information (official or otherwise) from Sudan is\navailable on suspected clinical cases in animals (predominantly\nmass-abortions and offspring mortality). In addition to the grave\npublic health aspects, the disease may have devastating impact upon\nthe livestock industry and the livelihood of animal owners.\n\nRVF was initially recorded in Sudan in 1936 (antibodies in humans).\nAn extensive epizootic was described in 1973, accompanied by virus\nisolations from affected animals. 1973 is the year officially\nreported by Sudan's veterinary authorities as the last year of RVF\noccurrence. However, a limited epizootic was reported in 1976 (Ref.\nEisa et al., 1980. An outbreak of Rift Valley fever in the Sudan\n--1976. Trans.R. Soc. Trop. Med. Hyg. 74, 417-419). This epizootic\nwas later suspected to be a possible source of the major 1977-78 RVF\nepizootic/epidemic in Egypt (Ref. Gad et al., 1986. A possible route\nfor the introduction of Rift Valley fever virus into Egypt during\n1977. J Trop Med Hyg. 89(5):233-236). The authors concluded:\n'Reintroduction of RVF or other diseases from Sudan into Egypt will\nbe facilitated by the construction of new roads linking the two countries.'\n\nAn epizootic of RVF which occurred in Egypt between April and August\n1997 was also attributed to introduction from the Sudan (Ref.

Bleeding from the nose or gums can also\noccur.\n\nThe nearly 50 per cent fatality rate was 'very high' compared to the usual\nexpectations for Rift Valley fever, but it was likely that many more mild\ncases have not been detected in Sudan, according to Rainford.

The virus was 1st identified in 1931 during an\ninvestigation into an epidemic among sheep on a farm in the Rift Valley of\nKenya. Since then, outbreaks have been reported in sub-Saharan and North\nAfrica. In 1997-98, a major outbreak occurred in Kenya, Somalia, and\nTanzania and again in September 2000, and more recently mainly affecting\nlivestock in 2006/2007, Rift Valley fever cases have been confirmed also in\nSaudi Arabia and Yemen (see references below), being the first reported\noccurrence of the disease outside the African continent.

'We were informed by local farmers\nabout strange symptoms appearing among sheep and cattle near\nNassiriyah,' said Mandhor Rayhan, a spokesman for Dhi Qar provincial\ncouncil. 'A veterinary doctor who examined the animals suggested they\nshould be laboratory tested for Rift valley fever, and the suspected\ndiagnosis was confirmed in at least 4 animals.' [A map of Nassiriyah\ncan be seen at <http://www.fallingrain.com/world/IZ/9/An_Nasiriyah.html>].\nThe Nassiriyah medical laboratory chief, Abdel-Rayy Muhammad, said\nthe samples confirmed as positive were being rechecked at the\nNational Baghdad Laboratory over the next 48 hours. 'A recent phone\ncall from a senior official in the National Laboratory said there was\npossible confirmation of one case, but other samples were waiting to\nbe tested,' he said.\nFayad Sulaiman, a senior official in the Ministry of Agriculture in\nBaghdad, told IRIN a group of specialists were on their way to Dhi\nQar to evaluate the situation. 'We are retesting again, but, as a\nprecaution, we have sent some specialists to Nassiriyah. ... We hope\nit is an isolated case,' Sulaiman said.\n'Some vaccines have been sent to Dhi Qar Governorate this morning,\nand we have contacted companies to get more supplies, which should\narrive within a couple of days,' he added. 'We are seriously\nconcerned about the possibility that the disease might spread,' Dhi\nQar provincial council spokesman Rayhan said, adding that affected\nlivestock farmers have been asked to confine their animals within a 2\nsq km area until more specialised laboratory tests can be carried out\nin Baghdad.\nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO), RVF affects\nlivestock (including cattle, buffalo, sheep, goats and camels) as\nwell as humans. The disease mostly appears in Africa.\nPeople get RVF mainly from infected mosquitoes, which act as vectors.\nThe disease can also be spread by contact with the blood or body\nfluids of an infected animal. 'Our concern is that with the situation\nas it is in Iraq -- with increased poverty, displacement and pools of\nstagnant water -- people might get infected by mosquito bites,' said Rayhan.\nKhalid Idris, a veterinary specialist in Nassiriyah who has been\ndealing with the problem, told IRIN that livestock in the\ncontaminated farms must be vaccinated as a matter of urgency. 'All\nsheep, cattle and buffalo in herds within the infected area should be\nvaccinated immediately with an inactivated RVF vaccine and\nrevaccinated after 2 to 4 weeks. But these vaccines have not been\navailable in Iraq since before the US-led invasion in 2003,' Idris said.\nThe UN Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) said it had not\nreceived any details of the outbreak but that it was in touch with\nthe Ministry of Agriculture.\nIn July 2001, the FAO said RVF had been detected among livestock in\nYemen and Saudi Arabia and warned of the possibility of the disease\nspreading into Iraq. No case was confirmed then, but, since that\ntime, farmers have been advised to vaccinate their livestock\nperiodically, a procedure that, according to Idris, has not taken\nplace in Dhi Qar since February 2002. 'We are urging international\norganisations and the central government to find quick solutions to\nthe problem,' Idris said.\nThe RVF virus can cause several different syndromes. People who are\ninfected with RVF either show no symptoms or develop a mild fever and\nliver abnormalities. However, in some patients, the illness can\nprogress to haemorrhagic fever (which can lead to shock or\nhaemorrhage), encephalitis (inflammation of the brain, which can lead\nto headaches, coma, or seizures), or ocular diseases.\nPatients who become ill usually experience fever, generalised\nweakness, back pain, dizziness, and extreme weight loss at the onset\nof the illness. Normally, RVF patients recover within 2 days to one\nweek after catching the illness.\n--\nCommunicated by:\nOtavio da Silva <otavio_uff104@yahoo.com.br>\n[In the absence of details on the symptoms allegedly observed in the\ncattle and sheep, and of the diagnostic tests applied and their\nspecificity, it is difficult to assess the significance of the above\nsuspicions. In previous RVF cases in the Middle East, cases in humans\npreceded the reporting of animal disease.\nRVF has never been diagnosed in Iraq; the only countries in the Near\nEast which have been affected by RVF in the past are Egypt, Yemen and\nSaudi Arabia. During the late 1970's, RVF was reportedly suspected in\nEgyptian laborers residing in Iraq, but their eventual diagnosis was\nCongo-Crimean Haemorrhagic fever.\nThe clinical signs of RVF in animals vary with the age, species and\nbreed of the animal. In endemic regions, epidemics of Rift Valley\nfever can be recognized by high mortality rates in newborn animals\nand abortions in adults. In lambs, a biphasic fever, anorexia and\nlymphadenopathy may be followed by weakness and death within 36\nhours. Hemorrhagic diarrhea or abdominal pain can also be seen. The\nyoungest animals are most severely affected. In neonates, the\nmortality rate may reach 90 to 100 percent. However, no ovine\nneonates are expected yet in southern Iraq, where lambing is\nanticipated to commence not earlier than the end November 2007.\nSimilar symptoms occur in young calves: fever, anorexia and\ndepression are typical, with mortality rates of 10 to 70 percent.\nAbortions are the most characteristic sign in adult sheep and cattle.\nOther symptoms that may occur in adult sheep include fever, weakness,\na mucopurulent nasal discharge (sometimes bloodstained), melena,\nhemorrhagic or foul-smelling diarrhea, and vomiting. In adult cattle,\nfever, anorexia, weakness, excessive salivation, fetid diarrhea and\ndecreased milk production have been reported. Icterus may also be\nseen, particularly in cattle.\nSimilar but milder infections occur in goats. Adult camels do not\ndevelop symptoms other than abortion, but young animals may have more\nsevere disease.\nFor further details, see\n<http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/rift_valley_fever.pdf>.\nAn extensive epizootic of RVF spread earlier this year [2007] in\neastern Africa and the Horn of Africa.\nFurther details, particularly confirmation (or otherwise) of the\ndiagnosis by a reference laboratory, are soon anticipated. Then OIE\nreference laboratory for RVF is the Onderstepoort Veterinary\nInstitute in South Africa. The NAMRU-3 laboratory in Cairo has been\nhelpful in the early diagnosis of outbreaks in the region. - Mod.AS]", "summary": "We are seriously\nconcerned about the possibility that the disease might spread,' Dhi\nQar provincial council spokesman Rayhan said, adding that affected\nlivestock farmers have been asked to confine their animals within a 2\nsq km area until more specialised laboratory tests can be carried out\nin Baghdad.\n A ProMED-mail post\n<http://www.promedmail.org>\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\n<http://www.isid.org>\n Source: IRIN, Middle East News [edited]\n<http://www.irinnews.org/Report.aspx?ReportId=74740>\n\nLocal authorities in Nassiriyah, a town about 300 km south of\nBaghdad, have asked livestock farmers to take all necessary\nprecautions after laboratory tests showed that some livestock had\ndeveloped Rift valley fever (RVF).

A report issued yesterday [14 May\n2007] by Dodoma Regional Medical Officer Dr Frida Mokiti showed a\nsteady decline in RVF infections.\nThe death toll caused by RVF reached 55 since the disease erupted in\nthe region in early February this year [2007]. Until yesterday [14\nMay 2007] evening, the Regional Hospital had only 15 RVF patients.\nMirembe hospital, which had 18 patients 2 weeks ago, had only 5\nyesterday. Mvumi Mission Hospital, which had 2 patients last week,\nhad only one yesterday.\nMpwapwa District Hospital is still grappling with the single RVF case\nit had last week. Kondoa District Hospital has no RVF patient at the\nmoment after treating and discharging its 2 cases 2 weeks ago. Kongwa\nstill has its single patient, who was admitted a couple of weeks ago.\nHaneti and Mtitaa dispensaries in Bahi district have successfully\ntreated and discharged their patients. Two weeks ago, Haneti had 3\nRVF cases and Mtitaa had one. So far, a total of 42 patients have\nbeen treated in various hospitals in the region and discharged.\nThe regional RVF report shows that since 1 Feb 2007, medical\nfacilities in the region have handled 120 RVF cases. The Regional\nhospital has handled 70 cases, Mirembe Hospital (25), Kondoa (6),\nMpwapwa (6), Mvumi (5), Kongwa (4), Haneti (3), and Mtitaa (1).\nMedical experts said the decrease was an indication that new\ninfections are fewer now and that the disease is likely to taper off\nand disappear in a month or 2. Out of the 23 who were in hospital\nbeds yesterday [14 May 2007], only 15 have been proved positive for\nthe virus. Ten of them are in the Regional Hospital.\nMeanwhile, the region still faces a shortage of anti-Rift Valley\nfever cattle vaccines following a massive response by livestock\nkeepers who drive their herds to vaccination centers daily only to\nrealize that there are not enough jabs to go around. The response has\nalso posed a challenge to the region, which has only a few veterinary\nofficers in rural areas. The region also faces a crippling shortage\nof transport facilities for officials and veterinary officers.\nVeterinary service tools and materials are also short.\n[Byline: Sosthenes Mwita]\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Joseph P.

Provincial medical officer of health Ahmed Omar told\njournalists in his office that the 5 contracted the highly contagious\nviral disease last December [2006]. They were treated and discharged\nbut died of post-recovery and treatment complications in Garissa and\nIjara districts.\nHe also warned that the fever could reemerge in the region with the\nonset of long rains, which have pounded parts of Ijara in the last 2\nweeks. According to Dr. Omar, the 5 died after developing\nmeningo-encephalitis, a condition linked to post-recovery, a nervous\nsystem and brain disorder that attacks those who had contracted RVF\nbut were discharged after recovery.\nA surveillance medical team that visited parts of Garissa and Ijara\ndistricts last week found 3 of the victims had died in the Liboi and\nFafi areas of Garissa. They had, in December [2006], been admitted to\nthe isolation unit of Garissa Hospital after testing positive for\nRVF; 2 of the victims were women, while the 3rd was an 18-year-old\nherdsman. The other 2 who died in Ijara had previously been admitted\nto Masalani health centre in January 2007. The 2 herdsmen are said to\nhave died on their way to seek medical attention at Masalani district hospital.\nDr. Omar also said the medical team had further found several cases\nof blindness among patients who were discharged from hospital between\nDecember 2006 and January 2007. He asked those who had been\ndischarged from various health centers to report back to hospital\nshould they show post-recovery complications. According to the\ndoctor, 354 people infected at the height of the fever outbreak\nrecovered, while 106 died in Garissa, Ijara and Wajir, which had been\nthe epicenter of the disease before it spread to other parts of the country.\nMost of those affected by the fever, which mainly affects livestock\nbut spreads to humans through mosquito bites, were herdsmen. Their\ninfections were attributed to their close contact with infected animals.\nAccording to Dr. Omar, flooding could fuel a resurgence of the fever\nbecause the _Aedes_ mosquitoes -- which transmit the fever -- get the\nvirus after feeding on infected animals. They then transmit the virus\nto their eggs, and new generations of infected mosquitoes may hatch\nfrom such eggs. The eggs hatch during heavy rains, leading to an\nincrease in the number of mosquitoes.\n[Byline: Hussein Abdullahi]\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[A map of Kenya showing some of the locations mentioned above is accessible at\n<http://www.masai-mara.com/mmvmk.htm>.\n- Mod.CP]", "summary": "A ProMED-mail post\n<http://www.promedmail.org>\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\n<http://www.isid.org>\n [Byline: Hussein Abdullahi]\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n According to Dr. Omar, the 5 died after developing\nmeningo-encephalitis, a condition linked to post-recovery, a nervous\nsystem and brain disorder that attacks those who had contracted RVF\nbut were discharged after recovery.

He made the revelation\nin remarks on his recent tour of health facilities across the region\nto assess the magnitude of the epidemic, which has claimed a national\ntotal of 33 lives. The RC was addressing a meeting of guest house and\nhotel owners here on Tuesday [10 Apr 2007], amid reports that the\ndeadly viral disease was digging in.\nDodoma is the region worst hit by the RVF outbreak, and Lukuvi\nappealed to government officials, business people, owners of guest\nhouses and members of the public to step up measures to help prevent\nthe spread of the disease. 'We cannot enjoy ourselves while our\nvoters are suffering. We have to relieve them of the problem,'\nobserved the RC, his appeal coming at a time when the National\nAssembly is ending the 1st half of its ordinary 2-week meeting here.\nGiving what he said were the latest figures, Lukuvi said the region\nhas 56 RVF patients admitted to health facilities, adding: 'The\nsituation is critical. Some patients have been confined to hospital\nbeds for months but still show few signs of getting better.' The RC\nexplained that most patients are unconscious, some having been in bed\nfor over 2 months, noting, 'Medical officers and other staff are\ndoing what best they can do to arrest the situation but things remain\nbad indeed. Those religious leaders endowed with God's healing powers\nshould pray for those (RVF) patients who have lost the ability to\npray for themselves.'\nMeanwhile, Lukuvi used the occasion to order authorities in the\nregion to arrest anyone found eating meat that veterinary experts\nhave not screened and passed as fit for human consumption. There have\nbeen reports of some bars and restaurants here selling roast meat\ndespite a government ban and countrywide public education campaign\nmeant to alert wananchi ['citizen' in Swahili] against such behavior.\nRVF is an acute, fever-causing viral disease that affects both\nlivestock and humans. It hit parts of northern Tanzania in February\n[2007] after filtering in from Kenya, leading to human and animal\ndeaths and threatening the livelihood of pastoralist communities in\nboth countries. The Nairobi (Kenya)-based Centre for Disease Control\nconfirmed the presence of RVF in Tanzania on 1 Feb 2007after testing\nsamples collected by the Livestock Development Ministry in Arusha.\nAbortions feared to be RVF-induced have been reported among livestock\nherds in Kilosa, Tarime, Monduli and Simanjiro districts.\nJoint response and control measures are overseen and coordinated by\nthe Livestock Development and Health and Social Welfare ministries,\nlocal governments and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs). However,\nquarantines and livestock deaths threaten to prevent pastoralists\nfrom benefiting from the ongoing rains and the resultant good pasture\nconditions.\nThe government is planning to spend an estimated 15bn/- [USD 11 888\n250] fighting RVF and 1.7bn/- [USD 1 347 335] has already been spent\non ordering vaccines from abroad, Prime Minister Edward Lowassa and\nLivestock Development minister Anthony Diallo said recently. As of 31\nMar this year [2007], 200 441 head of cattle, 81 945 goats and 37 773\nsheep had showed RVF symptoms around the country. Reports released a\nfew weeks after the outbreak said 568 head of cattle, 1063 goats and\n434 sheep had died after developing symptoms similar to those of RVF.\n(Byline: Privatus Lipili)\n******\n[2]\nDate: Sat 14 Apr 2007\nFrom: 'Joseph Dudley' <fnjpd@uaf.edu>\nSource: Daily News, Dodoma, Sat 14 Apr 2007 [edited]\n<http://www.dailynews-tsn.com/page.php?id=6385>\n\nTanzania: Vice-president commends Rift Valley fever efforts\n-----------------------------------------------------------\nVice-president Dr. Ali Mohammed Shein has commended efforts to\ncontain Rift Valley fever (RVF) in the Dodoma region.

Of 354 people\ninfected at the height of the fever outbreak 106 died, again giving a\nhigh CFR.

It would have emerged and virus activity would\nhave been occurring following the excessive rainfall and flooding in\nthe region late in 2006.\nThere appears to be a lack of awareness of the basic natural history\nof the RVF virus. It is transovarially transmitted in floodwater\nbreeding _Aedes_ mosquitoes. The virus emerges and amplification will\noccur with successive cycles of transmission. Factors affecting this\nare the persistence of the flooding and the generation of huge\npopulations of mosquito species breeding in the floodwater, which are\ncapable of secondary transmission of the virus. Many _Aedes_,\n_Culex_, and other mosquito species can do this. The amplification\ncycles will involve the indigenous ruminant populations as feeding\nhosts, most of which would be unlikely to manifest any clinical signs\nof disease. The length of the acute epidemic curve will depend on the\npersistence of the floodwater but is usually of only 3-4 months\nduration(*), with some cases lasting for 2-4 more months.\nIndigenous sheep, goats, and zebu-type [_Bos indicus_] cattle are\nrelatively resistant to RVF infection. During this period, clinical\ndisease in man might be the 1st indication of any RVF virus activity.\nRVF disease might also be seen in exotic breeds of cattle and sheep\nor goats and their crosses; they would abort and young animals may\nshow clinical signs of disease. These may not be present in many RVF\nenzootic areas in Africa. Without these indicator disease hosts, the\nRVF virus activity would be cryptic.\nThe current epizootic in eastern Africa appears to be following the\nexpected time scale. There may have been alterations to the curve,\nwhich have followed the effective transmission of virulent RVF virus\ncaused by the widespread vaccination programmes. These may have\ninvolved hundreds of thousands of animals, which would not have been\notherwise affected.\nVaccination with the Smithburn MLVV (modified live virus vaccine)\nstrain (**) or any other vaccine is totally contraindicated at any\ntime when active virus transmission is taking place.\nIt was for this reason that we developed early warning strategies, to\nidentify the pre epizootic conditions for RVF (see my various\nreferences) and allow for pre epizootic vaccination programmes to be\ncarried out before the disease occurs. FAO/EMPRES (Emergency\nPrevention System) division in Rome used the predictive model\ndeveloped in Kenya, and predicted this epizootic long before it\noccurred (August-September 2006, I believe).\nVaccination of animal populations during periods when RVF virus is\nactively being transmitted by vectors, will serve to propagate the\nvirus very effectively by needle passage. The virus is readily\ntransmitted by infected needles from animal to animal. The apparent\nincrease in cases in the Dodoma region is likely to be due to this.\nThe information from our Predictive Models to provide Early Warning\nof Epizootic RVF virus activity and to drive Emergency Preparedness\nhas been our objective.\n(*) This is the time period in the flood plains of North-Eastern\nKenya and Somalia. It may recur, sporadically, for around 18 months-2\nyears after the rains in the highlands and coastal areas of eastern Africa.\n(**) The vaccine is cheap and easy to produce but causes problems in\nsusceptible sheep breeds (abortions and foetal abnormalities in\naround 10 percent). It is safe in cattle and non-pregnant animals.\n--\nF. Glyn Davies MA. PhD (Cantab) MB Vet.

The outbreak of the disease has exacerbated\nan already precarious food insecurity and livelihoods situation,\nfollowing the massive floods in Kenya and neighboring countries at\nthe end of 2006. A large number of animals were lost to the disease.\nWhile Rift Valley fever is unfortunately familiar to farmers in\nKenya, Tanzania and other countries in the region, not much is known\nabout the virus causing the disease. It is transmitted primarily to\nhumans through contact with infected animal matter such as blood or\nother fluids, as well as animal organs. Consumption of raw milk from\nan infected animal, an important element in the diet of many nomadic\npastoralists in Kenya, is also thought to lead to infection. RVF is\nalso spread by livestock through mosquito bites. The infected\nmosquito eggs are often laid around river banks and can stay dormant\nfor years until they get submerged. The eggs then hatch to mosquitoes\nthat spread the virus.\nIn Kenya, RVF has been well known for over 60 years. As early as\n1913, a disease fitting the description of RVF was blamed for the\nloss of sheep in the Rift Valley in Kenya. So far, there is no cure,\nand doctors are only able to treat the symptoms. About one per cent\nof people contracting RVF develop the disease in a severe form;\napproximately half of those die. The last large outbreak was in 1997,\nfollowing heavy rains blamed on El Nino, when some 27 500 people were\ninfected, and 170 died in Garissa District.\nThis time around, the 1st case of RVF was reported in Gurufa, Garissa\non 7 Dec 2006. Almost simultaneously, outbreaks were reported in a\nnumber of other districts, including Ijara, Wajir, Tana River and\nIsiolo, all of which had suffered from the extensive flooding in\nKenya's North Eastern Province.\nNearly 700 suspected cases of RVF were recorded in Kenya, according\nto the Ministry of Health, with 155 deaths. The worst affected\ndistricts were Garissa, Ijara and Wajir districts in North Eastern\nProvince, Tana River and Kilifi districts in Coast Province, and\nKirinyaga and Maragwa districts in Central Province.\nThe outbreak lead to a government-imposed ban on the slaughter of\nlivestock in the affected areas, which led to the closure of key\nlivestock markets, as well as a ban on movement and slaughter of\nanimals. This accentuated the precarious situation of pastoralists'\nwelfare, particularly in North Eastern Province. The ban on the\nslaughter of animals has now been lifted in Garissa, Ijara, Mandera\nand Wajir districts in North Eastern Province. However, the animal\nquarantine is in force awaiting review through a veterinary\ndepartment investigation.\nAt the peak of the RVF outbreak, the Kenya Red Cross Society was\nengaged in social mobilization activities targeting health workers\nand the affected communities. Access to affected areas in Garissa\nposed the greatest challenge due to flooding in the area. With the\nassistance of Emergency Response Units (ERUs) from sister societies\naround the world and other partners, the Kenya Red Cross assisted in\nthe establishment of Special Wards in Garissa Provincial Hospital and\nNgao Sub-District Hospital in Garsen.\nThe ward in Ngao Sub-District Hospital was established with support\nfrom the Japanese and Australian Red Cross and MSF-Spain. The Kenya\nRed Cross also worked with the MoH to institute timely and effective\ncare to suspected and/or confirmed RVF cases. The Medical ERUs helped\nto train medical personnel working in local health facilities on\nuniversal precautions, early case detection and referral.\nSignificant government vaccination campaigns targeting 1.5 million\nlivestock (cattle, sheep and goats), as well as other preventive\nactivity is ongoing in 33 districts where RVF cases have been\nreported. Other interventions include supportive case management;\nenhanced surveillance; community mobilization/public health education\nand veterinary intervention, like the ban on slaughtering of animals\ncurrently in force in the Marigat and Makutano parts of Baringo.\nVector control is also ongoing through the spraying of high risk\nanimals with synthetic pyrethroid.\nAccording to the World Health Organization, RVF can be prevented by a\nsustained program of animal vaccination. Live, attenuated and killed\nvaccines have been developed for veterinary use. The live vaccine\nrequires only one dose and produces long-lived immunity, but the\npresently-available vaccine may cause abortion if given to pregnant\nanimals. The killed vaccines do not cause these unwanted effects, but\nmultiple doses must be given to produce protective immunity. This may\nprove problematic in endemic areas.\nThe available vaccine is only for use with livestock. In humans, an\ninactivated vaccine has been developed. This vaccine is not licensed\nand is not commercially available, but has been used experimentally\nto protect veterinary and laboratory personnel at high risk of\nexposure to RVF. Other candidate vaccines are under investigation.\nIn neighboring Tanzania, the National Society has organized a one-day\nseminar on RVF in the capital city of Dodoma with participation of\nlocal authorities, Tanzanian Red Cross volunteers and representatives\nof local townships and villages. Following the seminar, the\nvolunteers went back into villages to educate local communities on\nthis epidemic.\nA total of 90 people in Dodoma were infected, and 19 of those lost\ntheir lives. The total number of RVF deaths in Tanzania now stands at\n33. The majority of Dodoma residents are livestock keepers, and the\ndeaths of large numbers of livestock simply mean a dwindling of\npeople's economic resources, Mr. Yunus Rugaiyamu, the Regional\nAdministrative Secretary, lamented and added that 'we must cooperate\nand work together in order to get rid of this killer disease in our region.'\nThe number of Tanzanian regions with suspected cases of RVF has\ncontinued to rise, now standing at 8: Arusha, Manyara, Tanga,\nKilimanjaro, Dodoma, Morogoro, Singida and Iringa. In Dar es Salaam,\nRegional Commissioner Mr. A Kandoro has announced a tentative ban on\nthe sale of meat grilled at roadside stalls (kebabs) and urged the\ncommunity to watch their eating manners as a precautionary measure,\nwhile leading authorities asked everyone to raise their level of\nalertness against the disease's entry into the city.\nResponding to the outbreaks, the Tanzanian Red Cross has distributed\n100 mosquito nets, 200 blankets and 2 tents through the Regional\nMedical Officer in Dodoma to be used at established treatment camps,\nwhile another 100 mosquito nets will be distributed by Dodoma Red\nCross to RVF-affected families. The Society also provided 4000\nleaflets to give health education to the local communities.\n[Byline: Everlyn Kemunto & Anthony Mwangi, Kenya Red Cross, and\nStella Marealle, Tanzania Red Cross]\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n*****\n[2]\nDate: Wed 2 May 2007\nSource: Daily News, Dar es Salaam [edited]\n<http://www.dailynews-tsn.com/page.php?id=6601>\n\nRift Valley Fever (RVF) patients admitted to health facilities in\nDodoma region have dropped to 35 from 137 last month [April 2007],\nindicating significant gains in controlling the killer disease, which\nhas wreaked havoc on the meat industry here, the Regional\nCommissioner (RC), Mr William Lukuvi, has said.\nAddressing a May Day rally at the Jamhuri Stadium here yesterday [1\nMay 2007], Mr Lukuvi said by yesterday morning the Dodoma Regional\nHospital had 20 RVF patients, Mirembe Hospital 11, Mvumi Mission\nHospital had 2 and Kongwa and Mpwapwa district hospitals had one\neach.

The 5\ndied as the Ministry of Health warned Kenyans against handling\nanimals suspected to be infected with the disease.\nDr. Jack Nyamongo of the National Public Health Laboratory\nServices/National Blood Transfusion Services said it was important\nnot to handle material from infected animals. He said veterinary\nofficers at Kabete were testing samples from a cow confiscated in\nRuai at the weekend to establish if the animal was infected with the\ndeadly virus.\nLast evening [11 Feb 2007], the Director of Veterinary Services, Dr.\nJoseph Musaa, said initial results indicated that the cow was\nsuffering from Lumpy Skin disease. [Lumpy skin disease is caused by a\npoxvirus classified in the genus _Capripoxvirus_, which affects\ncertain breeds and crossbreeds of cattle in Africa. - Mod.CP].\nThe 4 family members succumbed to the killer fever after attending a\ntraditional wedding in the Tana River on Mon 12 Feb 2007. The victims\ndeveloped symptoms of the disease before bleeding to death barely 2\ndays after feasting on camel meat at a wedding ceremony in Anole\nvillage, Madogo division.

He said most of the affected villagers were treated [and]\nsubjected to periodic check-ups. Three of them were admitted to an\nisolation unit in the facility. Omar regretted that most of the fresh\ncases reported over the last 2 weeks followed disregard of the\nslaughter ban. Madogo DO [District Officer], Mr. George Omolo, said\nvillagers reported the matter after 3 of the women who prepared the\ncamel meat collapsed and bled to death.\nPreliminary reports indicated that the camel had been bought, Omolo\nsaid. He said the pastoralist who sold the animal was among those\nretained for specialised treatment at the hospital. Panicky\nvillagers, including those who ate cooked meat thronged local health\ncentres to establish their RVF status.\nThis brings to 114 the number of deaths reported in northern Kenya\nsince the outbreak of the disease, 2 months ago. In Baringo District\nan 18-year-old man died bringing the death toll in the area to 16.\nMedical Officer of Health, Dr. George Otieno, said the man who had\nbeen receiving treatment at Kimalel Health Centre died on Saturday\n[10 Feb 2007]. Nationally, 150 people have died of the disease in the\npast 2 months.\nOtieno said a team of health workers had been dispatched to the\naffected villages in the Marigat and Kiserian divisions to fight the\ndisease. He identified the most affected villages where the fever has\ntaken its toll as Ngambo location, Sindan, Sandai, Logumgum, and\nSalabani all in the Marigat division, and some parts of the Mukutani\ndivision.\nHe said the government has supplied the district with 500 mosquito\nnets and insecticides. But Otieno said the chemicals were still lying\nat chemical stores in Kabarnet town, as the Government has not\nreleased money to hire casual workers to spray houses in the affected\nareas.\nBaringo Central MP, Mr. Gideon Moi, visited patients in the Kimalel\nand Marigat sub-district hospitals and distributed more than 2000\nmosquito nets.\nAt the same time, farmers in Nakuru have asked the Government to\ndeclare the fever a national disaster. Farmers meeting in Nakuru\nyesterday [11 Feb 2007] criticised the Livestock Development ministry\n[for the way it] handled the matter.\nMeanwhile, fear of the disease spreading in Meru Central have led to\nan order of closure of all abattoirs and butcheries in the area.\nDistrict veterinary officer, Dr. Daniel Karugu, said samples from\nseveral suspected cows are being analysed.

Eleven died in Marigat, Baringo District, while 5 others\ndied in Taita, Taveta and Maragua districts, veterinary officers said on\nFri 2 Feb 2007. This brings the death toll from the disease to 150 since\nthe 1st case was reported in North-Eastern Province in January 2007.\nPanic gripped Baringo residents as more people succumbed to the disease and\nseveral patients were admitted to hospital. Veterinary officers have\nimposed quarantine and ordered all butcheries closed after 2 more people\ndied on Thursday night. Villagers said 11 people had died even as\nveterinary officers insisted it was 6.\nAn estimated 300 goats and sheep have died of a mysterious disease linked\nto the spread of [Rift Valley fever] in the past week.\nThe clinical officer in charge of Marigat Sub-district Hospital, Rahab\nRandall, said 4 people have died in the last week. 'We have confirmed 4\ndeaths arising from the disease after samples we sent to the Kenya Medical\nResearch Institute (KEMRI) tested positive,' said Randall. Randall said a\nStandard Five pupil died while undergoing treatment at the Moi Teaching and\nReferral Hospital while a middle-aged woman died at home.\nNgambo location chief, Mr Joseph Lenasheku, said many people were unable to\nreach hospital due to heavy rains that rendered roads impassable. The body\nof a 32-year-old woman, who died after feasting on meat from a dead sheep,\ncould not be taken to the mortuary due to the bad state of the roads.\nIn Nakuru, butcheries continued to suffer losses as residents avoided meat\nfearing to contract Rift Valley fever. The manager of Gilanis Butchery, Mr\nS A Haji said sales have since gone down. However, he assured his customers\nthat the meat was inspected and stamped by certified Government officers.\nMr Samson Keitany, a supervisor with Hygienic Butchery, said business had\nbeen bad in the last 2 weeks. Keitany said he reduced his order to one cow\na week from 3. Gladys Njeri of Village Park Butchery said she reduced her\norders to 2 goats per day from 5. Butchers urged the Government to step up\nvaccination and public awareness campaigns.\nIn Taita Taveta, 2 more people have succumbed to the disease. Two other\npeople are fighting for their lives at Taveta District Hospital. Those who\ndied included a Maasai herdsman and a woman at Salaita village in Taveta\ndivision. Last month a Somali herdsman died at Kuranze Ranch in Voi\ndivision. The Taita Taveta District medical officer of health, Dr Shem\nPatta, said the victims died of a disease with symptoms similar to Rift\nValley fever. Dr Patta said one of those who died was treated in Tanzania\nbut died on return. The MOH said goats and cows were reportedly dying of an\nunidentified disease. Patta said samples had been taken to KEMRI for\nanalysis. He said unrestricted movement in Taita could fan the rapid spread\nof the disease. 'We have set up an isolation ward in all public health\nfacilities, equipped workers with protective gear, and notified them of the\nlatest outbreak,' said Dr Patta. He said the Government is educating the\npublic on the disease.\nThe District veterinary officer, Dr Julius Nkanata, said several animals\nhave died of an unidentified disease in the area. Samples have been taken\nto Nairobi for tests.\nIn Maragua 3 more cases of the deadly fever have been reported.

'What I can\nconfirm now is that RVF is under control in Kenya.'\nThe RVF virus is spread to humans from livestock via the _Aedes_\nmosquito, which breeds rapidly during floods. Northeastern Province,\ninhabited by nomadic herdsmen, was hit by devastating floods between\nOctober and December 2006. The disease can also be transmitted\nthrough contact with infected animal material such as blood or other\nbody fluids or organs. Consumption of milk, a staple for many\nshepherds, is also a possible risk. Symptoms include bleeding through\nthe nose and mouth and liver failure.\nThe Ministry of Health has been working together with KEMRI and the\nCDC to curb the spread of the disease. Njenga said Ministry officials\nhad managed to keep the RVF virus from spreading to other parts of\nKenya and to other countries in the region. He said health officials\nwere working around the clock to inform the public on how best to\nkeep the virus at bay. 'We are working together and have increased\nsurveillance throughout the country, especially in livestock areas,'\nNjenga said. He added that KEMRI and the CDC were analyzing samples\nreceived from various parts of the country. No cases have been\nconfirmed in Ethiopia, although one spot [sporadic] case was reported\nin Somalia,' he said. 'Spot cases are not uncommon in areas where RVF\nis endemic, and the positive case in Somalia is one such example; it\ndoes not represent an escalation of new cases.\nContinued public education is the best tool available in the fight\nagainst RVF,' Njenga said. 'We must teach the people how to handle\nanimal products, especially raw meat, carefully; to avoid consuming\nuncooked meat; and use treated mosquito nets.'\nNortheastern Province was previously hit by an outbreak of RVF in\n1997 after heavy flooding caused by the El Nino weather pattern.

Mosquitoes\nspread the disease, which primarily affects animals. The worst hit areas\nare reported to be the Garissa, Wajir, Ijara, and Tana River Districts.\nDr Vincent Martin, veterinarian for the UN Food and Agriculture\nOrganization, has just returned to Rome from Kenya. From FAO headquarters,\nhe spoke to VOA English/Africa Service reporter Joe De Capua about the Rift\nValley fever outbreak. 'In Kenya, the situation has been quite worrying,\nbecause we are facing a Rift Valley fever epidemic, which is quite similar\nto the one that broke out in Kenya 9 years ago. So when I was there, I met\nthe different key stakeholders and partners who are trying to control the\noutbreak situation,' he said.\nIt's unclear how many livestock have been infected. Martin said: 'It's very\ndifficult to get figures on the number of animals affected, basically,\nbecause of the situation on the ground. The fact that all the areas, which\nwere affected, were flooded, it was very difficult to access these places.\nAnd therefore, the reports on suspected animals or abortions or deaths had\ndifficulty getting back to the provincial level or the headquarters. And\ntherefore, that's the main reason why we don't have precise figures.'\nThe FAO is trying to strengthen surveillance by mobilizing teams to\ninvestigate reports of Rift Valley fever in various areas. It's also\noffering technical advice and training on how to identify the disease in\nits early stages.\nMartin said while he didn't see any animals being vaccinated, he believes\nthousands of doses from South Africa and the United States have arrived in\nrural areas.\n[byline: Joe De Capua]\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[The vaccine obtained from South Africa is probably commercial\nlive-attenuated (Smithburn) vaccine.

Should pregnant animals be vaccinated, subsequent abortions\nmight cause reluctance to vaccinate or to cooperate with the vaccinators\namong herders. The safer, inactivated vaccine requires booster vaccinations\nand is more laborious and expensive. This is the vaccine of choice in\nnon-endemic situations (RVF-free countries/regions) and prior to the\ncommencement of outbreaks in endemic regions.\nIt will be interesting to note which vaccine has been supplied from the US.\nIs it the MV P12 vaccine, produced from a mutagen-derived strain of (human)\nRVF virus?

Dr Pima has further recommended\nthat people desist from drinking raw milk that he said could be behind the\noutbreak. People are also supposed to sleep under nets at night, because it\nis possible for the fever to be transmitted from livestock to humans by\nmosquitoes, he added.\nExperts fear that if the disease spreads to Tanzania, it could put the\nlives of a staggering 35 million people and a cattle population of 18.5\nmillion at serious risk. The new outbreak of RVF has killed nearly 80\npeople in Kenya over the past 4 weeks, according to health officials in\nNairobi early last week. The vaccination of at least a million livestock in\nthe regions hit by the fever is said to be going on.\nSome 200 people have contracted the disease since the 1st case was reported\nlate last month [December 2006], and it has continued to spread across\nseveral districts in Kenya.\nOmar Ahmed, the medical services chief in the worst-hit North Eastern\nProvince, was quoted as saying a death toll of 70 has been registered in\nGarissa, Ijara, Tana River, and Wajir districts. Another 5 deaths have been\nreported in Kilifi District along the Indian Ocean coast.\nMore people were understood to have been admitted to hospitals with the\nviral disease, which is usually transmitted from livestock to humans by\nmosquitoes, mainly during and after flooding. However, preliminary\nepidemiological reports suggest that the drinking of raw milk from infected\nanimals could be the main route of infection in this outbreak.\nRVF, which was 1st detected way back in the 1930s in South Africa, affects\nboth livestock and humans. Experts believe that the mosquitoborne pathogen\nhad crossed the Sahara into Egypt by 1977, and by 1999, it had traversed\nthe Red Sea into Yemen and Saudi Arabia.\nPatients who contract the virus usually experience fever, weakness, joint\npain, dizziness and extreme weight loss.

The\nSomali and some Rendille tribesmen herd cattle, fat tailed sheep, and\ngoats. These animals are enclosed in a circular enclosure made of thorn\ntree branches at night. They are not inside, and the herdsmen, unless they\nare in one place for quite a while, will sleep in the open alongside a\nfire. The Rendille make a shelter of semicircular branches covered with\nhides. These residences are taken down and carried on camels when they\nmove. These people are going to drink the milk of their stock and probably\nkill and eat a sick animal before it dies. It is a real problem.\nThe herds and herdsmen are scattered over huge areas looking for grazing,\noften a long way off any sort of vehicular access. They can be spotted from\nthe air. But it all costs money, and if one is going to vaccinate\nlivestock, then somehow these herdsmen who are largely illiterate and very\nscattered have to be informed. The only real way to contact these people is\nby radio or word of mouth by a fellow tribesman, well informed and on a\ncamel. You can use vehicles, but they get held up all the time by the bush\nand rocks, etc. But then they will suspect it is a government tax trap.

It is a recapitulation not only with respect to\ndisease evolution but also in terms of national and international\npreparedness -- or lack of it.\nThose who followed ProMED in those days will be aware that the\nepizootic attracted intense international attention and was closely\nreported in postings, which contain much useful information. Despite\nseminal work on developing early warning systems based on remote\nsensing, led by Vincent Martin, Glyn Davies and Kenneth Linthicum\ninter alia, it seems that the capacity to respond has not improved\ngreatly in the high-risk countries in Africa.\nAs warned by FAO EMPRES, in the face of an established El Nino event,\nif continuing rainfall maintains inundation, we are likely to see in\nthe next weeks the progressive emergence of foci of RVF and other\ndiseases across a broad swathe of country from southern Ethiopia and\nSomalia to northern Tanzania with devastating effects on the health\nof communities and livelihoods based on livestock production and\ntrade. [See further, in section 3 of this posting, data from the\nFAO/EMPRES analysis and outlook, published ahead of the current RVF\noutbreak -- namely in November 2006. - Mod.AS]\nIn addition, re-emergence of disease in West Africa is a real\npossibility. Are the national authorities themselves taking action to\nlimit impact? Should major epizootics develop, this time will it\nbring about investment in establishing systematic early warning and\nresponse systems for the future, or will there be a flurry of\nexuberant activity followed by _Aedes_ eggs settling into the dried\nmud of dambos and heads re-buried in the sands of Africa like the\nproverbial ostrich?\nOne other issue I would like to raise is that whenever there are\nreports of RVF outbreaks, the possibility of the disease spreading to\nother areas is described, as it is in your posting of 11 Jan 2006\n[20070111.0112]. I wish to suggest that this is an incorrect concept,\nand I would be grateful if others more knowledgeable than me could\ncomment. Certainly as an RVF epizootic evolves, one sees first the\nemergence of RVF in a small number of sites and then asynchronous\nappearance of additional foci of disease over an extended time.\nSuperficially this can give an appearance of the disease spreading\nlike a contagious disease, and of course there might be some local\nspread by movement of vectors and viraemic livestock, yet, in fact,\ninfection is primarily emerging from dormancy at different times in\ndifferent sites as conditions there become suitable for the emergence\nand build-up of primary and secondary vector populations, possibly\nalso reflecting density of susceptible hosts available to amplify\ninfection. Lateral spread seems to play only a minor role in\nepizootic development.\nThis is not a trivial, pedantic issue. Undoubtedly area-wide\nvaccination has a place in RVF control to suppress emergence and\ndevelopment of epizootics but the concept of disease spreading out\nfrom a focus tends to mislead people into conceiving that vaccination\nbuffer zones can contain infection. That is unlikely given that the\nvirus has already been seeded into and established long ago in\nsuitable habitats across a broad area.\n--\nDr Peter Roeder, BVetMed, MSc, PhD, MRCVS\nAnimal Health Officer (Virology) and GREP Secretary\nAnimal Health Service\nAnimal Production and Health Division\nFood and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations\nRome, Italy\n<Peter.Roeder@fao.org>\n******\n[3]\nDate: Fri, 12 Jan 2007\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: FAO, Animal Production and Health Division, Emergency\nPrevention System for the Transboundary Animal Diseases (EMPRES) [edited]\n<http://www.fao.org/ag/againfo/programmes/en/empres/home.asp>\n\nThe above web-site includes the section 'EMPRES WATCH' as well as a\npdf document titled 'Possible RVF activity in the Horn of Africa' (7\npages), dated November 2006; recommended reading.

Recommendations\n------------------\nThe Risk maps presented in this review were obtained from the\nanalysis of environmental data alerts and depict specific areas of\nAfrica that could face new outbreaks of vector-borne diseases and\nmore specifically Rift Valley fever. Countries located in high risk\nareas of RVF and those which recently experienced RVF should activate\nand increase disease surveillance according to OIE standards in\nparticular those countries located in areas associated with the\nprevious occurrence of RVF. If there are no reports of clinical signs\ncompatible with RVF, disease surveillance should focus on mosquitoes\nand serology of susceptible ruminants only.\nFAO encourages these countries to activate their early warning,\nprevention and contingency plans.\nImporting countries of meat or animals from RVF risk areas should not\napply trade restrictions if disease surveillance is in place in\ncountries/zones at risk with negative results. The OIE standards\nclearly separate 'RVF infection free country or zone' from 'RVF\ninfected countries/zones without disease'.\nIn the 1st case the country is out of the historical distribution\narea, a surveillance programme is in place and 4 years have elapsed\nsince the last epidemic.\nIn the 2nd, the country is considered free but disease has not\noccurred in humans and animals in the past 6 months and climatic\nchanges predisposing to outbreaks of RVF have not occurred during this time.\nA 3rd classification is 'RVF infected country/zone with disease,'\nmeaning clinical disease in humans and animals has occurred within\nthe past 6 months. Even in presence of disease or infection, the OIE\nTerrestrial Animal Health Code accepts trade of ruminants and meat\nfrom infected countries if certain specific conditions of quarantine\nor vaccination are met. This is based on timely and prompt\nnotification of infection\n6. FAO in action\n----------------\n1.

Two people died\nlast week while a 3rd died early this week at the Kenyatta National\nHospital. But the government insists that the 3 contracted the disease\nwhile in the North Eastern province.\nAddressing a press conference on Wed [31 Jan 2007], Senior Deputy Director\nof Medical Services Dr. Shahnaaz Sharif said meat in Nairobi, and other\nareas that have no reported cases, is still safe to eat. He said: 'We wish\nto reassure Kenyans that it is safe to eat meat, but you must ensure that\nthe meat is cooked properly until there are no bloody parts. So far no\nconfirmed cases of RVF have been infected following eating of meat.'\nDr. Sharif stressed that there is an ongoing public awareness campaign\ntargeting different audiences to inform Kenyans on the fever and steps that\nshould be taken to prevent infection in both animals and people. 'You can\nonly get RVF by touching the blood or body fluids of an infected animal,\nslaughtering, skinning and cutting meat of an infected animal, touching and\nhandling raw meat of an infected animal, drinking un-boiled milk from an\ninfected animal and the bite of an infected mosquito,' he said.\n[RFV] is [transmitted] by _Aedes_ mosquitoes and has spread in 14 districts\nof the country namely; Garissa, Ijiara, Lamu, Thika, Maragua, Wajir, Tana\nRiver, Kilifi, Malindi, Taita Taveta, Isiolo, Kirinyaga, Kajiado and\nNairobi. Out of the 414 suspected cases, 135 have been confirmed as Rift\nValley fever. It is however unclear what the precise death toll is. On\nMonday the [death] toll was 121. Since then, however, 2 deaths were\nreported in Kajiado yesterday bringing the toll to 123. However the\ngovernment says the toll is one less at 122 deaths.\n[Byline: Catherine Karong'o]\n******\n[2]\nDate: Thu 1 Feb 2007\nFrom: Joe Dudley <jdudley@eaicorp.com>\nSource: allAfrica.com, The Nation (Nairobi), Thu 1 Feb 2007 [edited]\n<http://allafrica.com/stories/200701311034.html>\n\nTwo more people have died of Rift Valley fever in Nairobi, sparking fears\nthat the virus could spread in the city. The 2 -- a man and a woman -- were\nadmitted to Kenyatta National Hospital from Nairobi's Kariobangi and\nEastleigh estates last week and died on Mon 29 Jan 2007, senior ministry of\nHealth official Patrick Nguku said yesterday.\nMedics had established that the 2 had travelled to Garissa District, the\nepicentre of the deadly disease. 'They are likely to have contracted the\nvirus there,' Dr Nguku said. This brings to 3 the number of people who have\ndied at Kenyatta hospital in the past 2 weeks. The 1st death occurred on\nSunday after a patient admitted 2 weeks ago from Kerugoya in Kirinyaga\nDistrict succumbed. This prompted the hospital to issue an alert to doctors\nand nurses to be on the lookout for the killer disease.\nAt the same time, KNH director Jotham Micheni has announced that the\nhospital has set up an isolation ward where patients manifesting symptoms\nof the disease would be confined and treated. Dr Nguku said 2 more victims\nof the fever were still at the hospital.\nThe officials were answering journalists' questions during a joint press\nconference by Livestock and Health ministry officials at Afya House. Dr\nShanaaz Shariff, the senior deputy director of medical services, urged\nNairobi residents not to panic, saying the disease was unlikely to spread\nin the city.\n'A surveillance team comprising Livestock and Health ministry officials has\nbeen set up in Nairobi to ensure that no infected animals from the\nneighbouring Maragua, Kirinyaga and Thika districts are allowed into the\ncity. One can only be infected by handling blood or body fluids,\nslaughtering, skinning, cutting or drinking unboiled milk from an infected\nanimal or from the bite of an infected mosquito,' he said.\nHe appealed to Nairobi residents not to stop eating roasted or boiled meat.\n'However, people should ensure they only eat meat that has been\nrubber-stamped and inspected by veterinary officials,' Dr Shariff added.\nSince the outbreak 2 months ago, the death toll has reached 122.\n[Byline: Mike Mwaniki]\n******\n[3]\nDate: Wed 31 Jan 2007\nFrom: Joe Dudley <jdudley@eaicorp.com>\nSource: SomaliNet, Wed 31 Jan 2007 [edited]\n<http://somalinet.com/news/world/East%20Africa/7120>\n\nKenya's capital Nairobi is among the 9 high-risk districts where a million\ndoses of Rift Valley fever (RVF) vaccine will be distributed. Kenya's\nLivestock and Fisheries Development Minister Joseph Munyao said Tue 30 Jan\n2007 that the vaccine would also be distributed in Nakuru, Koibatek, Uasin\nGishu, Trans Nzoia, Trans Mara, Narok,\nKajiado, Machakos and Nyeri districts,\nMeanwhile, Rift Valley Fever has killed up to 124 people. 'On average, each\ndistrict will receive 100 000 doses, which will be distributed according to\nlivestock population and RVF risk. 'At the same time, the ongoing control\nactivities in North Eastern and Coast provinces will be stepped up,' Munyao\nsaid.\nWhen the Rift Valley fever broke out 2 months ago, more than 400 000 head\nof livestock, out of the targeted 2 million, had been vaccinated in various\nparts [of the country]. On Tuesday, the lives stock minister distributed 10\n000 litres of synthetic insecticide which would be distributed at no cost\nto farmers and herders to assist in fighting mosquitoes.\nIn the same light, the United States (U.S) Government announced it would\ndonate a 2nd shipment of 800 000 doses of livestock vaccine worth Sh 21\nmillion [USD 299 000]. 'This contribution follows the initial one where 450\n000 doses, worth Sh 12.5 million [USD 178 000], were donated on 7 Jan\n2007,' a statement added. The Kenyan Government last week released Sh 100\nmillion [USD 1.4 million] to assist in the fight against Rift Valley fever.\nRift Valley fever which was first identified in the Rift Valley Province in\nthe 1930s is a viral disease which primarily affects animals, but\noccasionally attacks humans.\n[Byline: Bonny Apunyu]\n--\nJoe Dudley\nEAI Corporation\nSAIC\n<jdudley@eaicorp.com>\n******\n[4]\nDate: Fri 2 Feb 2007\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: MMWR Weekly, Fri 2 Feb 2007 / 56(04);73-76 [edited]\n<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5604a3.htm?s_cid=mm5604a3_e>\n\nRift Valley Fever Outbreak -- Kenya: Nov 2006 to Jan 2007\n--------------------------------------------------------\nIn mid-December 2006, several unexplained fatalities associated with fever\nand generalized bleeding were reported to the Kenya Ministry of Health\n(KMOH) from Garissa District in North Eastern Province (NEP). By 20 Dec\n2006, a total of 11 deaths had been reported. Of serum samples collected\nfrom the first 19 patients, Rift Valley fever (RVF) virus RNA or\nimmunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies against RVF virus were found in samples\nfrom 10 patients; all serum specimens were negative for yellow fever,\nEbola, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, and dengue viruses. The outbreak\nwas confirmed by isolation of RVF virus from 6 of the specimens. Humans can\nbe infected with RVF virus from bites of mosquitoes or other arthropod\nvectors that have fed on animals infected with RVF virus, or through\ncontact with viremic animals, particularly livestock. Reports of livestock\ndeaths and unexplained animal abortions in NEP provided further evidence of\nan RVF outbreak.\nOn 20 Dec 2006, an investigation was launched by KMOH, the Kenya Field\nEpidemiology and Laboratory Training Program (FELTP), the Kenya Medical\nResearch Institute (KEMRI), the Walter Reed Project of the U.S. Army\nMedical Research Unit, CDC-Kenya's Global Disease Detection Center, and\nother partners, including the World Health Organization (WHO) and Medecins\nSans Frontieres (MSF). This report describes the findings from that initial\ninvestigation and the control measures taken in response to the RVF\noutbreak, which spread to multiple additional provinces and districts,\nresulting in 404 cases with 118 deaths as of Thu 25 Jan 2007.\nTeams of investigators conducted patient interviews and reviewed medical\nrecords from 1 Dec 2006 forward in major health-care facilities in the\ndistricts from which cases were first reported. The teams detected\nadditional cases by meeting with elders, other leaders, and health-care\nproviders in villages where cases had been reported and in adjacent\nvillages. Blood samples from patients with suspected RVF were collected and\nmaintained at 39.2 F (4.0 C). Samples from NEP and surrounding areas were\ntransported to a field laboratory established at Garissa Provincial\nHospital by CDC, KEMRI, and KMOH; samples from other areas were sent to\nKEMRI laboratories in Nairobi and to a laboratory in Malindi that was\nsupported by a team from Health Canada.\nA suspected case was defined as acute onset of fever (>99.5F [>37.5C]) with\nheadache or muscle and joint pain since 1 Dec 2006 in a person who had no\nother known cause of acute febrile illness (e.g., malaria). A probable case\nwas defined as acute onset of fever in a person with unexplained bleeding\n(i.e., in stool, vomit, or sputum or from gums, nose, vagina, skin, or\neyes), vision deterioration, or altered consciousness. A confirmed case was\ndefined as a suspected or probable case with laboratory confirmation of the\npresence in serum of anti-RVF virus IgM by enzyme-linked immunosorbent\nassay (ELISA) or RVF virus RNA by reverse transcription polymerase chain\nreaction (RT-PCR).\nThe index case was reported in Garissa District in a patient who had\nsymptom onset on 30 Nov 2006. Retrospective analysis of sera collected\nduring July to November 2006 at Garissa Provincial Hospital revealed no\nevidence of earlier acute RVF infections. As of 25 Jan 2007, a total of 404\ncases of RVF had been reported in Kenya with 118 deaths, a case-fatality\nrate of 29 percent. Of the reported cases, 115 (29 percent) were laboratory\nconfirmed by anti-RVF virus IgM by ELISA (64 cases, 56 percent) or RT-PCR\n(79, 69 percent), including 28 cases (24 percent) confirmed by both. Of the\nremaining 289 cases, 109 were classified as probable.\nOf the 230 patients with available demographic information, 140 (61\npercent) were male [illustrated by a histogram in the original text].\nPatients ranged in age from 4 to 85 years, with a median age of 27 years\n(30 years for females and 25 years for males). RVF cases were reported from\n3 districts in NEP (Garissa [175 cases], Ijara [125], and Wajir [26]); 5\ndistricts in Coast Province (Kilifi [38], Tana River [16], Malindi [8],\nIsiolo [8], and Taita Taveta [one]); 2 districts in Central Province\n(Kirinyanga [2] and Maragua [one]); one district in Rift Valley Province\n(Kajiado [3]); and one from Nairobi Area [These districts are located in a\nmap in the original text]. The patient from Nairobi had traveled to NEP\nduring the week before illness onset but was hospitalized in Nairobi. Ijara\n(population 79 932) and Garissa (population 420 918) districts had the\nhighest RVF incidence rates: 156 and 42 per 100 000 population, respectively.\nAmong the first 97 reported cases from Garissa and Wajir districts with\ndetailed epidemiologic information available, 71 (73 percent) met the\nprobable case definition; 38 of the 62 patients who provided blood samples\ntested positive by IgM ELISA, RT-PCR, or both. The most frequently reported\nsymptoms among the 97 patients were fever (100 percent), headache (90\npercent), bleeding (76 percent), malaise (70 percent), muscle pain (62\npercent), back pain (60 percent), vomiting (56 percent), and joint pain (51\npercent).\nTwo thirds of the 66 patients who provided information on potential risk\nfactors reported having an animal that was recently ill. The most\nfrequently reported RVF risk factors during the 2 weeks preceding illness\nonset were drinking unboiled (raw) milk (72 percent); living within 100\nmeters of a swamp (70 percent); having an ill animal (67 percent); drinking\nmilk from an ill animal (59 percent); working as a herdsman (50 percent);\nhaving a dead animal (50 percent); and slaughtering an animal (42 percent).\nApproximately 9 percent of patients reported contact with another ill human.\nThe outbreak peaked on 24 Dec 2006, and the number of daily cases has been\ndeclining since 27 Dec 2006 [illustrated by a figure in the original text].\nA ban on livestock slaughtering in Garissa District went into effect on 27\nDec 2006 and was expanded as RVF was detected in additional districts.\nVaccination of animals with live, attenuated RVF vaccine began on 8 Jan\n2007. Prevention messages were developed in 3 languages (English, Kiswhali,\nand Somali), and public meetings (known as barazas) were held to spread\ninformation rapidly to the community. Messages also were disseminated via\nradio, a widely used communication medium in NEP. Village elders, chiefs,\nand religious leaders were consulted throughout Garissa District, leading\nto a district ban on the slaughter of livestock and closure of the\nlivestock market. Health-care workers were trained to care for persons\nsuspected to be infected with RVF virus.\nReported by: P Nguku, S Sharif, A Omar, C Nzioka, P Muthoka, J Njau, A\nDahiye, T Galgalo, J Mwihia, J Njoroge, H Limo, J Mutiso, R Kalani, A\nSheikh, J Nyikal, Kenya Ministry of Health; D Mutonga, J Omollo, A Guracha,\nJ Muindi, S Amwayi, D Langat, D Owiti, A Mohammed, Kenya Field Epidemiology\nand Laboratory Training Program, Kenya Ministry of Health/CDC.

Humans acquire RVF\nthrough bites from infected mosquitoes or, more frequently, through\nexposure to the blood, body fluids, or tissues of animals that have been\nbitten by infected mosquitoes.\nDirect exposure to infected animals can occur during slaughter or through\nveterinary and obstetric procedures. RVF was first described in sheep in\nthe early 20th century, and the virus was first isolated in humans in Kenya\nin 1930 (1,2). In livestock, RVF causes abortion and death. Livestock\nepizootics can occur after heavy rainfall and flooding that result in\nhatching of _Aedes_ mosquitoes (thought to be the initial vector and\ninter-epizootic reservoir of RVF) and other vectors that feed on nearby\nmammals (3). Eastern Kenya experienced unusually heavy rainfall during the\nperiod October to December 2006, three times the average for that period\nduring the preceding 8 years and 13 times the rainfall in 2005 (Kenya\nMeteorological Department, unpublished data, 2007).\nPatients with RVF usually have initial signs and symptoms of influenza-like\nillness; less than 8 percent of patients subsequently have severe disease,\nincluding generalized hemorrhagic syndrome, encephalitis, or retinitis (2).\nThe overall human mortality rate from RVF has been estimated at 0.5 percent\nto 1.0 percent of those infected, but the rate is much higher among those\nwith severe disease. The largest reported human outbreak occurred in Kenya\nduring the period 1997 to 1998, in which an estimated 89 000 persons (based\non a systematic serosurvey) were infected and 478 died; this outbreak also\nwas centered in NEP (3, 4, 5). Previous RVF outbreaks among humans were not\nreported outside sub-Saharan Africa until 1977 to 1978, when approximately\n18 000 persons became ill with 1000 in Yemen had severe illness (6, 7, 8).\nLike the 1997-1998 outbreak, the current outbreak was associated with heavy\nrainfall, which produced massive flooding in much of Kenya, and\nparticularly in NEP. Climatic forecasting in conjunction with satellite\nimaging of flooded areas has been suggested as a method for predicting\nwhere and when RVF outbreaks might occur, potentially enabling earlier\ninterventions (9).\nMost of the cases before 20 Dec 2006 occurred in young men who herded\nlivestock, perhaps because herdsmen are the first to identify and slaughter\nill animals. Later in the outbreak, the distribution of cases broadened by\nage and sex. Young women also were over-represented, perhaps because they\nhandle uncooked animal products at home as they prepare meals for the\nfamily. Cases among children aged <5 years and the elderly have been rare,\nprobably because they rarely interact with animals or handle raw animal\nproducts.\nMost patients reported to KMOH had severe illness with bleeding, which\nlikely accounts for the 29 percent case-fatality rate. Judging from\nprevious studies, many mild, undetected RVF virus infections likely\noccurred during this outbreak (5). Additional cases of severe disease also\nmight have occurred in NEP but were not detected because of the\ninaccessibility of many areas of the province resulting from flooding. Many\nareas of NEP, including an entire division of Garissa District, were\nunreachable by road from early December to mid-January.\nSince mid-January, RVF in livestock has been detected in districts\nsurrounding Nairobi, signaling occurrence of the outbreak in new areas.\nReports also have been received of livestock and humans with illness\nconsistent with RVF across the border in Somalia, where disease assessment\nhas been hampered by ongoing security concerns. Several international\norganizations are collaborating to control the spread of the outbreak\nwithin Kenya and to other countries. Travelers should take precautions when\nvisiting RVF-affected areas.\nGenerally, the risk for RVF infection among travelers to Kenya is low,\nunless they visit areas where an outbreak is occurring and are bitten by\ninfected mosquitoes or come in contact with body fluids, uncooked tissue,\nor aerosols from infected livestock. No preventive RVF medications or\nlicensed vaccines for humans exist. Travelers to affected areas should\nreduce their risk for infection by protecting themselves from mosquito\nbites and by avoiding direct contact with livestock. Specific\nrecommendations for U.S. travelers are available at\n<http://www.cdc.gov/travel/other/2006/rift_valley_fever_kenya.htm>.\nTo control the outbreak, KMOH launched several interventions, some of which\nmight have limited the public health impact of the outbreak. A ban on the\nslaughter of animals (including during Eid-ul-azha, a religious holiday)\nwas imposed in NEP and strictly enforced. The Ministry of Livestock and\nFisheries Development initiated a policy of vaccinating apparently\nunaffected herds of livestock in districts in which human or livestock RVF\ndisease had been confirmed and also in adjacent districts; however, as of\n25 Jan 2007, only a small proportion of livestock had been immunized. Other\ninterventions included heightened disease surveillance among humans and\nanimals, community mobilization, animal quarantines and restricted\ntransport of livestock, and an integrated vector-control strategy,\nincluding indoor residual spraying and larviciding. RVF wards were\nestablished in which appropriate infection-control measures were encouraged.\nTimely detection of this outbreak was aided by implementation of Integrated\nDisease Surveillance and Response [A strategy of the African Regional\nOffice of WHO that aims to improve availability and use of surveillance and\nlaboratory data to control infectious diseases that are the leading causes\nof death, disability, and illness in the region] within most of the\naffected districts. A 2nd factor contributing to timely detection was\ninitiation of RVF laboratory-supported field surveillance of febrile\npatients at outpatient clinics in Garissa. Ongoing epidemiologic,\nentomologic, and veterinary studies related to this outbreak continue to 1)\nidentify factors associated with severe forms of RVF illness and poor\noutcomes; 2) characterize the role of specific species of mosquitoes in\ntransmitting, maintaining, and spreading RVF virus; 3) assess the economic\nimpact of the outbreak; and 4) define the impact of livestock immunization\nwith live, attenuated RVF veterinary vaccine on minimizing the spread of\nanimal and human disease.

The most\nfrequently reported RVF risk factors during the 2 weeks preceding illness\nonset were drinking unboiled (raw) milk (72 percent); living within 100\nmeters of a swamp (70 percent); having an ill animal (67 percent); drinking\nmilk from an ill animal (59 percent); working as a herdsman (50 percent);\nhaving a dead animal (50 percent); and slaughtering an animal (42 percent). Timely detection of this outbreak was aided by implementation of Integrated\nDisease Surveillance and Response [A strategy of the African Regional\nOffice of WHO that aims to improve availability and use of surveillance and\nlaboratory data to control infectious diseases that are the leading causes\nof death, disability, and illness in the region] within most of the\naffected districts. On 20 Dec 2006, an investigation was launched by KMOH, the Kenya Field\nEpidemiology and Laboratory Training Program (FELTP), the Kenya Medical\nResearch Institute (KEMRI), the Walter Reed Project of the U.S. Army\nMedical Research Unit, CDC-Kenya's Global Disease Detection Center, and\nother partners, including the World Health Organization (WHO) and Medecins\nSans Frontieres (MSF). A ProMED-mail post\n<http://www.promedmail.org>\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\n<http://www.isid.org>\n The most frequently reported\nsymptoms among the 97 patients were fever (100 percent), headache (90\npercent), bleeding (76 percent), malaise (70 percent), muscle pain (62\npercent), back pain (60 percent), vomiting (56 percent), and joint pain (51\npercent). You can\nonly get RVF by touching the blood or body fluids of an infected animal,\nslaughtering, skinning and cutting meat of an infected animal, touching and\nhandling raw meat of an infected animal, drinking un-boiled milk from an\ninfected animal and the bite of an infected mosquito,' he said. The Ministry of Livestock and\nFisheries Development initiated a policy of vaccinating apparently\nunaffected herds of livestock in districts in which human or livestock RVF\ndisease had been confirmed and also in adjacent districts; however, as of\n25 Jan 2007, only a small proportion of livestock had been immunized. Of serum samples collected\nfrom the first 19 patients, Rift Valley fever (RVF) virus RNA or\nimmunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies against RVF virus were found in samples\nfrom 10 patients; all serum specimens were negative for yellow fever,\n Other\ninterventions included heightened disease surveillance among humans and\nanimals, community mobilization, animal quarantines and restricted\ntransport of livestock, and an integrated vector-control strategy,\nincluding indoor residual spraying and larviciding. A confirmed case was\ndefined as a suspected or probable case with laboratory confirmation of the\npresence in serum of anti-RVF virus IgM by enzyme-linked immunosorbent\nassay (ELISA) or RVF virus RNA by reverse transcription polymerase chain\nreaction (RT-PCR). Livestock\nepizootics can occur after heavy rainfall and flooding that result in\nhatching of _Aedes_ mosquitoes (thought to be the initial vector and\ninter-epizootic reservoir of RVF) and other vectors that feed on nearby\nmammals (3). \nRift Valley fever which was first identified in the Rift Valley Province in\nthe 1930s is a viral disease which primarily affects animals, but\noccasionally attacks humans.\n Samples from NEP and surrounding areas were\ntransported to a field laboratory established at Garissa Provincial\nHospital by CDC, KEMRI, and KMOH; samples from other areas were sent to\nKEMRI laboratories in Nairobi and to a laboratory in Malindi that was\nsupported by a team from Health Canada. EAI Corporation\nSAIC\n<jdudley@eaicorp.com>\n******\n The largest reported human outbreak occurred in Kenya\nduring the period 1997 to 1998, in which an estimated 89 000 persons (based\non a systematic serosurvey) were infected and 478 died; this outbreak also\nwas centered in NEP (3, 4, 5). Humans can\nbe infected with RVF virus from bites of mosquitoes or other arthropod\nvectors that have fed on animals infected with RVF virus, or through\ncontact with viremic animals, particularly livestock. Among the first 97 reported cases from Garissa and Wajir districts with\ndetailed epidemiologic information available, 71 (73 percent) met the\nprobable case definition; 38 of the 62 patients who provided blood samples\ntested positive by IgM ELISA, RT-PCR, or both. Generally, the risk for RVF infection among travelers to Kenya is low,\nunless they visit areas where an outbreak is occurring and are bitten by\ninfected mosquitoes or come in contact with body fluids, uncooked tissue,\nor aerosols from infected livestock. This report describes the findings from that initial\ninvestigation and the control measures taken in response to the RVF\noutbreak, which spread to multiple additional provinces and districts,\nresulting in 404 cases with 118 deaths as of Thu 25 Jan 2007. RVF cases were reported from\n3 districts in NEP (Garissa [175 cases], Ijara [125], and Wajir [26]); 5\ndistricts in Coast Province (Kilifi [38], Tana River [16], Malindi [8],\n Humans acquire RVF\nthrough bites from infected mosquitoes or, more frequently, through\nexposure to the blood, body fluids, or tissues of animals that have been\nbitten by infected mosquitoes. The 2 -- a man and a woman -- were\nadmitted to Kenyatta National Hospital from Nairobi's Kariobangi and\nEastleigh estates last week and died on Mon 29 Jan 2007, senior ministry of\nHealth official Patrick Nguku said yesterday. A surveillance team comprising Livestock and Health ministry officials has\nbeen set up in Nairobi to ensure that no infected animals from the\nneighbouring Maragua, Kirinyaga and Thika districts are allowed into the\ncity. The teams detected\nadditional cases by meeting with elders, other leaders, and health-care\nproviders in villages where cases had been reported and in adjacent\nvillages. Taking measures to decrease contact with\nmosquitoes through use of repellents and bednets and avoiding exposure to\nblood or tissues of animals that might be infected are important protective\nmeasures for preventing RVF. Eastern Kenya experienced unusually heavy rainfall during the\nperiod October to December 2006, three times the average for that period\nduring the preceding 8 years and 13 times the rainfall in 2005 (Kenya\nMeteorological Department, unpublished data, 2007). A probable case\nwas defined as acute onset of fever in a person with unexplained bleeding\n(i.e., in stool, vomit, or sputum or from gums, nose, vagina, skin, or\neyes), vision deterioration, or altered consciousness. Reports of livestock\ndeaths and unexplained animal abortions in NEP provided further evidence of\nan RVF outbreak.\n Village elders, chiefs,\nand religious leaders were consulted throughout Garissa District, leading\nto a district ban on the slaughter of livestock and closure of the\nlivestock market. Kenya's\nLivestock and Fisheries Development Minister Joseph Munyao said Tue 30 Jan\n2007 that the vaccine would also be distributed in Nakuru, Koibatek, Uasin\n On Tuesday, the lives stock minister distributed 10\n000 litres of synthetic insecticide which would be distributed at no cost\nto farmers and herders to assist in fighting mosquitoes.\n Dr\nShanaaz Shariff, the senior deputy director of medical services, urged\nNairobi residents not to panic, saying the disease was unlikely to spread\nin the city.

One can only be infected by handling blood or body fluids,\nslaughtering, skinning, cutting or drinking unboiled milk from an infected\nanimal or from the bite of an infected mosquito,' he said. As of 25 Jan 2007, a total of 404\ncases of RVF had been reported in Kenya with 118 deaths, a case-fatality\nrate of 29 percent. The overall human mortality rate from RVF has been estimated at 0.5 percent\nto 1.0 percent of those infected, but the rate is much higher among those\nwith severe disease.

Teams of investigators conducted patient interviews and reviewed medical\nrecords from 1 Dec 2006 forward in major health-care facilities in the\ndistricts from which cases were first reported. Most of the cases before 20 Dec 2006 occurred in young men who herded\nlivestock, perhaps because herdsmen are the first to identify and slaughter\nill animals. In mid-December 2006, several unexplained fatalities associated with fever\nand generalized bleeding were reported to the Kenya Ministry of Health\n(KMOH) from Garissa District in North Eastern Province (NEP). Previous RVF outbreaks among humans were not\nreported outside sub-Saharan Africa until 1977 to 1978, when approximately\n18 000 persons became ill with 1000 in Yemen had severe illness (6, 7, 8). -------------------\nRVF is an acute, febrile zoonotic disease caused by Rift Valley fever\nvirus, which belongs to the family _Bunyaviridae_ and genus _Phlebovirus_. Cases among children aged <5 years and the elderly have been rare,\nprobably because they rarely interact with animals or handle raw animal\nproducts. Additional cases of severe disease also\nmight have occurred in NEP but were not detected because of the\ninaccessibility of many areas of the province resulting from flooding. Like the 1997-1998 outbreak, the current outbreak was associated with heavy\nrainfall, which produced massive flooding in much of Kenya, and\nparticularly in NEP. In the same light, the United States (U.S) Government announced it would\ndonate a 2nd shipment of 800 000 doses of livestock vaccine worth Sh 21\nmillion [USD 299 000]. ' According to the first\narticle above, 'Out of the 414 suspected cases, 135 have been confirmed as\nRift Valley Fever'. Dr. Sharif stressed that there is an ongoing public awareness campaign\ntargeting different audiences to inform Kenyans on the fever and steps that\nshould be taken to prevent infection in both animals and people. ' This contribution follows the initial one where 450\n000 doses, worth Sh 12.5 million [USD 178 000], were donated on 7 Jan\n2007,' a statement added. Enzootic hepatitis or Rift Valley\nfever: an undescribed virus disease of sheep cattle and man from East\nAfrica. On average, each\ndistrict will receive 100 000 doses, which will be distributed according to\nlivestock population and RVF risk. ' Travelers to affected areas should\nreduce their risk for infection by protecting themselves from mosquito\nbites and by avoiding direct contact with livestock. Reports also have been received of livestock and humans with illness\nconsistent with RVF across the border in Somalia, where disease assessment\nhas been hampered by ongoing security concerns. Judging from\nprevious studies, many mild, undetected RVF virus infections likely\noccurred during this outbreak (5). Ijara\n(population 79 932) and Garissa (population 420 918) districts had the\nhighest RVF incidence rates: 156 and 42 per 100 000 population, respectively. with\nheadache or muscle and joint pain since 1 Dec 2006 in a person who had no\nother known cause of acute febrile illness (e.g., malaria). \nDirect exposure to infected animals can occur during slaughter or through\nveterinary and obstetric procedures. At the same time, KNH director Jotham Micheni has announced that the\nhospital has set up an isolation ward where patients manifesting symptoms\nof the disease would be confined and treated. The 1st death occurred on\nSunday after a patient admitted 2 weeks ago from Kerugoya in Kirinyaga\nDistrict succumbed. He said: 'We wish\nto reassure Kenyans that it is safe to eat meat, but you must ensure that\nthe meat is cooked properly until there are no bloody parts. A 2nd factor contributing to timely detection was\ninitiation of RVF laboratory-supported field surveillance of febrile\npatients at outpatient clinics in Garissa.

The deaths were reported in Dobley, 18 km north of the Kenyan\nborder, in the last 5 days. 'The dead are mainly nomadic herders,'\nsaid Hassan Mursal, a clinical officer in nearby Afmadow hospital.\n'The number could be higher but because of the current insecurity in\nthe area there is no way of getting the full picture.'\nMahamud Haji Hassan Jabra, an epidemiologist with the European\nUnion-funded Somali Animal Health Service Project, said numerous\nreports of animal abortions -- a key indicator of the disease -- had\nbeen received from the area. But plans to send 2 teams to verify the\noutbreak would only go ahead once the security situation allowed.\n'Our focal point in the area has reported the clinical signs of the\ndisease but we need to confirm this by testing the samples\ncollected,' he said. 'If it turns out to be RVF it will have a\ndevastating impact on the livelihoods of the pastoralists, who have\nsuffered 2 years of drought followed by heavy flooding.'\nDobley is close to the Kenyan border where fighting continues between\nUnion of Islamic Courts (UIC) remnants and Ethiopian-backed Somali\ngovernment soldiers, who have been chasing them since the UIC were\nforced out of Mogadishu and much of southern Somalia. A humanitarian\nsource in the area told IRIN on Tuesday [9 Jan 2007] that casualties\nhad been reported when planes carried out air strikes in villages\nclose to Dobley. 'We have reports of 22 people killed by the\nbombing,' he said. International media reported that the planes were\nAmerican, targeting suspected al-Qaeda operatives.\n'Most of those killed were in a convoy of donkeys carrying sugar to\nthe outlying villages,' which have been rendered inaccessible due to\nrecent heavy rains, said the source, who requested anonymity. Another\nsource told IRIN there were reports of a number of armed militia in\nthe area. 'We don't know whether they belonged to the Islamic courts\nor not but some people are saying that they were there.'\nThe bombardment took place in an area known as Jiiro, a 'very good\npastureland, with the highest concentration of cattle in the Juba\nvalley', said the humanitarian source, adding that whether there were\nmilitants in the area or not, 'civilians had been hit'. The fighting,\nhe added, was making 'it impossible to access the area and help the\npastoralists'.\nAn epidemic of RVF is first manifested in unexplained abortions among\nlivestock. However, Jabra cautioned that 'some of the symptoms of\nRVF, such as fever, headache and muscle pain are also common in flu\nand malaria.'\nAccording to the World Health Organization, the disease is endemic in\nAfrica, naturally occurring in livestock but occasionally affecting\nhumans. Animals are infected with the RVF virus by the\n_Aedes_ mosquito. Characterised by bleeding from all orifices, it is\nspread to humans via infected mosquitoes; through contact with blood\nor other body fluids; or from the organs of infected animals. The\ndisease mainly occurs after heavy rainfall -- southern Somalia has\nbeen experiencing El Nino-type rains, which flooded many parts of the\ncountry. 'The conditions in Lower Juba region are conducive to an\noutbreak,' said Jabra.\nAt least 60 people in Kenya's North East Province have died from the\ndisease and last week, health experts warned it may have begun to\nspread. 'All evidence suggests that the disease is still spreading,'\nsaid Kariuki Njenga, a virologist and laboratory director for the\nUnited States Centers for Disease Control (CDC) in Kenya. The worst\naffected districts are Garissa, where 100 cases, including 40 deaths,\nhave been reported; and Ijara, where 20 out of 42 people infected\nwith RVF have died. The CDC has set up a field laboratory to test\nsuspected cases and is helping the Kenyan government to develop a\nvaccination strategy.\nA team from the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation is also working\nwith Kenya, Somalia and Ethiopia to address the outbreak. 'Together\nwith officials from the WHO and various international aid agencies\npresent in the area, the FAO team is helping to draw up preparedness,\ncommunication, surveillance and response activities,' according to a\nFAO statement. The last outbreak of RVF in Somalia was in 1997 and\nled to a ban on livestock from Somalia by the Arab Gulf States.\nLivestock exports had been the backbone of the Somali economy.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[It is almost inevitable that Rift Valley fever will spread into the\nregions of Somalia adjacent to the North East Province of Kenya if\nthe outbreak around Garissa in Kenya is not rapidly contained.

' Dobley is close to the Kenyan border where fighting continues between\nUnion of Islamic Courts (UIC) remnants and Ethiopian-backed Somali\ngovernment soldiers, who have been chasing them since the UIC were\nforced out of Mogadishu and much of southern Somalia. The\ncombination of extensive flooding in Kenya and the upsurge of\nmilitary operations in the adjacent regions of Somalia in the past\nfew days is not propitious. Our focal point in the area has reported the clinical signs of the\ndisease but we need to confirm this by testing the samples\ncollected,' he said.

The center had\nbeen monitoring climate in East Africa for several years.\n'The heavy rains being experienced were similar to what was observed\nin 1997/1998, when a major outbreak occurred in Tanzania, Somalia and\nKenya,' read the warning.\n'The outbreak of Rift Valley Fever is another example that requires a\nquick and coordinated response,' said FAO's New Crisis Management\nCentre manager, Karin Schwabenbauer.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[The above newswire was circulated internally at ProMED-mail with the\nfollowing question posed by Mod.MPP: 'What would/could they have done\nto prevent the outbreak?' The response of our moderators definitely\nwarrants sharing with the general ProMED-mail community. - Mod.MPP]\n[What, indeed could they have done? There is no commercial human RVF\nvaccine available. The virus is in _Aedes_ eggs deposited in 'dambos'\n(periodically flooded wet areas), and when they hatch and adults\nemerge, they come equipped with virus ready for transmission. _Aedes_\nvector control in this large an area seems impractical and expensive.\nMoving people and their small ruminant animal RFV hosts out of areas\nof potential or active transmission also seems impractical,\nespecially along the Kenya-Somalia border given what has been going\non there over the past several days. The only feasible alternatives\nthat occur to me are: (1) vaccinating livestock as WHO proposes, (2)\neducating people not to handle or butcher infected animals, to\nminimize animal-to-human (non-vector) transmission, and even that\nwould be daunting with people spread over a large area of difficult\naccess, and (3) giving health care providers time to get ready to\nattend the human cases that would result from an outbreak. - Mod.TY]\n[A comment on some aspects of RVF in Kenya as posted in ProMED\narchive 20070106.0058 and our internal discussions:\nAs regards vector transmission, at least 30 species of mosquitoes\nhave been found naturally infected with the virus of RVF. Although it\nis stated that _Aedes_ species are the main vectors, considerable\ntransmission can be due to _Culex_ and _Mansonia_ species. In Kenya,\nspecies found naturally infected include _Aedes dalzei_, _Ae.\ndurbanensis_, _Ae. lineatopennis_, _Culex antennatus_, _Cx.\nsimpsoni_, _Cx. vansomereni_, _Cx. zombaensis_, _Cx rubinotus_ and\n_Anopheles christyi_ and _An. pharoensis_. Note the large numbers of\n_Culex_ species.\nIn addition, the tick _Rhipicephalus appendiculatus_ was reported as\na vector in Kenya in 1933. In Nigeria (1967) _Culicoides_ species\nwere reported positive for the virus as were _Simulium_ species in\nSouth Africa in 1953. However, whether these non-mosquito vectors are\nimportant epidemiologically is questionable. I would guess not.\nWhereas the eggs of _Aedes_ mosquitoes can tolerate desiccation for\nmonths and even years, species of _Culex_ and other genera cannot.\nTransovarial transmission was shown in _Ae. lineatopennis_ in Kenya\nand in _Ae. vexans_ in Senegal, but most likely occurs in other\naedine species. It has been suggested that such transmission\nmaintains the virus in nature during inter-epidemic periods.\nRecent epidemics in Kenya have shown the importance not only of\nrainfall but also of crop irrigation practices.\nIf logistics and finances allow, then ultra-low-volume (ULV) aerial\napplications of insecticides are the most appropriate method for\ncurtailing epidemics; or on a smaller scale, ground-based spraying\ncan be used. Commonly used insecticides include organophosphates,\nsuch as malathion and pirimiphos-methyl, or pyrethroids, like\npermethrin and deltamethrin, to kill the adults.\nInsecticide-impregnated nets, which can remain effective for many\nmonths or even years depending on the method of treating the nets\nwith pyrethroid insecticides, will only be effective at night, when\npeople are sleeping under them. Many of the potential RVF vectors\n(e.g. most _Aedes_ species) bite during the daytime, not at night,\nalthough in general, _Culex_, _Mansonia_ and _Anopheles_ species bite at night.\nIndoor residual spraying, whether in human or animal quarters, will\nonly be effective if the vectors enter such quarters to feed and or\nrest, and most potential vectors do not. By the way, one hopes that\nKenya will soon reintroduce DDT spraying of houses for malaria\ncontrol, as have at least 8 other African countries.\nWhat is meant by larviciding stagnant pools? Many, if not most, RVF\nvectors will not breed in stagnant waters but in relatively clean\naquatic habitats. Moreover, larviciding needs precise identification\nof the aquatic habitats colonized by vector mosquitoes, which,\ncombined with the often extensive nature of such habitats, means that\nlarviciding is not likely to be very effective. Moreover, when\ndesiccated eggs are flooded, not all will hatch; it may take several\nrepeated flooding and drying periods to stimulate hatching.\nLarviciding will kill only the larvae, not any un-hatched eggs. - Mod.MS]\n[A live vaccine prepared from Smithburn's attenuated strain of RVF\nvirus has been used for the control of RVF in non-pregnant cattle and\nsheep in endemic areas and during outbreaks, while inactivated\nvaccines for use in pregnant animals and in RVF-free countries are\nprepared from virulent field strains.

At least 28 people have died from the\ndisease since it was reported 2 weeks ago. Hundreds of animals,\nmostly goats, in Fafi, Jarajila and Shanta Abak -- considered the\nepicentre of the outbreak -- have also died.

It can be transmitted to humans\nvia mosquitoes or through contact with infected animal material, such\nas blood or other body fluids, or organs.

The diagnosis was\nconfirmed as Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) infection by specific IgM\n[assay] and PCR [amplification]. After the first cases were confirmed the\nMinistry of Health (MOH), Centre for Disease Control (CDC) and the World\nHealth Organization sent a team to investigate and put in place control\nmeasures to stop the spread of the disease.\nPreliminary data show that 71 percent of all cases admitted with RVF were\nmales and 29 percent were females. Patients less then 20 years comprised\nless then 3 percent. The age of male patients was 28 years while the mean\nage of female patients was 33 years. The attack rate for Garissa district\nwas 19 per 100 000 people and the highest attack rate was in Shanta Abak at\n129 cases per 100 000. The first cases were reported from Shanta Abak.\nThe commonest presenting features were fever, headache, muscle pains and\njoint pains. The patients with severe disease had a bleeding tendency such\nas hemetemesis, bleeding from the nose and gums. A total of 86 percent of\nthe patients interviewed said that they drank raw milk and 71 percent said\nthat they had drunk milk from a sick animal 2 weeks before onset of\nsymptoms. Most patients lived near a swampy area. In all, 71 percent of\npatients had sick animals in their herds and 60 percent had lost an animal\ndue to disease 2 weeks prior to onset of symptoms; 53 percent had\nslaughtered a sick animal while 53 percent reported they had eaten meat\nfrom either a sick or a dead animal. Fifty-one percent of patients were\nusing a [mosquito] net.\nCases have now been reported from other parts of North Eastern Province\nsuch as Ijara, Garissa and also in 2 districts of Coast Province (Tana\nRiver and Kilifi District). Cumulative figures as of 5 Jan 2007 are 188\ncases with 68 deaths.\nThe Government has imposed a quarantine for animals in North Eastern\nProvince and also imposed a ban on slaughtering animals at home. The\nMinistry of Health with CDC, WHO, UNICEF and the Red Cross have mounted an\nintensive health education program using electronic media, religious\nleaders and health workers to tell people to avoid contact with sick\nanimals, to stop drinking raw milk and to stop eating meat from sick or\ndead animals. It has started distributing insecticide treated nets and\nindoor residual spraying and larviciding stagnant pools of water.\n--\nDr. S. K.

Consumption of raw milk, an important\nelement in the diet of many nomadic pastoralists of the area, is also\nthought to lead to infection.\nThe epidemic has been triggered by extensive flooding in the region.

Once covered with water, the\neggs become infected mosquitoes which spread the virus. The last large\noutbreak in the same region was in 1997, also following heavy rains. During\nthat time in Garissa District, around 27 500 were infected and 170 died.\nOnly about one percent of people contracting Rift Valley fever develop the\ndisease in a severe form. But of those who do, around half will die.\n'The great majority of people infected just suffer from headaches and\ninfluenza-like symptoms reminiscent of malaria,' explains MSF emergency\ncoordinator Dr Ian Vanenglegem, 'but the severe form, like other\nhaemorrhagic diseases, attacks the liver and can cause the patient to bleed\nfrom every orifice. There is no cure, so we are only able to treat the\nsymptoms.'\nOne of the biggest challenges of dealing with this outbreak is logistical.\n'Much of Kenya's North-Eastern Province is not accessible by road because\nof the floods, so the only way we can find patients is to travel by\nhelicopter,' continues Dr Vanenglegem.

It is estimated that up to 500 000 people are at risk from infection\nand this population is scattered over a vast area. We are sure that the\nnumber of cases discovered is only the tip of the iceberg.'\nAnother difficulty is the fear of the outbreak among the population. With\nsuch a high death rate among those contracting the severe form of the\ndisease, many people will see no benefit in making the often long journey\nto a health centre. To counter this, MSF teams are undertaking\nawareness-raising activities to increase understanding of what Rift Valley\nfever is and what measures people should take themselves. 'This is an\nimportant concern because it is likely that, with the flood waters being a\nperfect breeding ground for mosquitoes, this outbreak will be followed to\nby high numbers of malaria infections.

At least 28 people have died from the\ndisease since it was reported 2 weeks ago. Hundreds of animals,\nmostly goats, in Fafi, Jarajila and Shanta Abak -- considered the\nepicentre of the outbreak -- have also died.

'It is important that this is not done at home to reduce the\nrisk of humans contracting the disease.'\n\nThe disease was first identified in Kenya in 1931. The World Health\nOrganisation (WHO) says it occurs in epidemics in animals in Africa\nand is associated with spontaneous abortions in sheep, goats, cattle,\ncamels, and deaths in young animals. It can be transmitted to humans\nvia mosquitoes or through contact with infected animal material, such\nas blood or other body fluids, or organs. Consumption of milk, a\nstaple for many pastoral people, is also thought to lead to infection.\n\nFollowing the latest outbreak, Kenya's health ministry is carrying\nout clinical case management, surveillance and social mobilisation\nactivities, as well as mosquito net distribution.

Results\nfrom KEMRI (The Kenya Medical Research Institute) laboratories have\nconfirmed that the samples sent from the Provincial General Hospital\n(PGH) in Garissa were positive. The RVFV specific IgM titers were\npositive as well as [results obtained] using PCR. There have been 11\ndeaths in Garissa District and at least 6 patients have been admitted\nto the PGH in Garissa. Two of the deaths occurred in the hospital.\nThe area has been affected by floods due to heavy rains since the end\nof November and many parts of the district are inaccessible by road.\nAll cases were in herdsman aged between 20 and 30 years. The symptoms\nincluded headache, fever, myalgia and bleeding tendencies.\nThere have been no deaths reported in abattoir workers or butchers.\nResults from sentinel surveillance sites at PGH Garissa also show\nevidence of past infection as evidenced by presence of RVFV specific\nIgG; this may indicate exposure to the virus during the 1997-1998\noutbreak. Entomological studies indicate increased densities of both\nanopheles and aedes mosquitoes in Garissa District and the\nneighbouring Ijara District.\nThere are reports of deaths occurring in areas of Southern Somalia\nbordering Kenya with patients presenting with similar symptoms,\nhowever it has not been possible to obtain blood samples from\npatients in Somalia. It is difficult to estimate the number of deaths\nin livestock in the area because of the inaccessible roads. Air\ntransport has been used to evacuate people stranded in floods and to\nevacuate patients in inaccessible areas. The Ministry of Livestock\nhas banned movement of livestock from the province and is starting a\ncampaign to vaccinate all cattle in the area.\nThe Ministry of Health with UNICEF and WHO have sent\ninsecticide-treated nets (ITNs) for distribution for all the people\nand chemicals for indoor residual spraying (IRS). Distribution of ITN\nhas been difficult because most of the areas are inaccessible due to\nheavy rains and it may be difficult to conduct IRS in all areas\nbecause of the nomadic life style of the population and the fact that\nmost of the areas are inaccessible.\n--\nDr.S.K.Sharif OGW,MBChB,MMed,DLSHTM, MSc\nChief Medical Specialist\nMinistry of Health\nKenya\n<sksharif@africaonline.co.ke>\n<pphs@health.go.ke>\n[Dr Sharif's statement reports the results of laboratory tests\n(serology and PCR) confirming the involvement of Rift Valley fever\nvirus in the outbreak of hemorrhagic fever in the North Eastern\nProvince of Kenya. There are unconfirmed reports also of human cases\nof Rift Valley fever to the east of Garissa in the southern region of\nSomalia.\nEpizootics of Rift Valley fever are generally observed during years\nin which unusually heavy rainfall and localized flooding occur. The\nexcessive rainfall allows mosquito eggs, usually of the genus\n_Aedes_, to hatch. The mosquito eggs are naturally infected with the\nRift Valley fever virus, and the resulting mosquitoes transfer the\nvirus to the livestock on which they feed. Once livestock (cattle,\nsheep and goats) are infected, other species of mosquitoes can become\ninfected from these animals and can spread the disease. In addition,\nit is possible that the virus can be transmitted by other biting\ninsects. Humans can become infected as a result of bites from\nmosquitoes and possibly other bloodsucking insects that serve as\nvectors.\nHumans can also get the disease if they are exposed to either the\nblood or other body fluids of infected animals. This exposure can\nresult from the slaughtering or handling of infected animals or by\ntouching contaminated meat during the preparation of food. In the\nGarissa outbreak, the detection of IgG antibody in abattoir workers\nand butchers, in the absence of disease, may indicate that the virus\nhas been present in insect vectors in this region undetected for some\ntime. In general humans are less susceptible to severe disease than\ndomestic animals. Humans typically have either no symptoms or a mild\nillness associated with fever and liver abnormalities. However, in\nsome patients the illness can progress to hemorrhagic fever (which\ncan lead to shock or hemorrhage), encephalitis (inflammation of the\nbrain, which can lead to headaches, coma, or seizures), or ocular\ndisease (diseases affecting the eye).\nPatients who become ill usually experience fever, generalized\nweakness, back pain, dizziness, and extreme weight loss at the onset\nof the illness. Typically, patients recover within 2 days to one week\nafter onset of illness. The most common complication associated with\nRVF is inflammation of the retina. As a result, 1-10 percent of\naffected patients may have some permanent vision loss. - Mod.CP]\n[Circulating RVF virus, anywhere, is bad news; its current timing and\nlocation in Somali is particularly of concern. This, in view of the\napproaching Eid ul-Adha (Eyd-e Qorban, the islamic Festival of\nSacrifice), which marks the end of the pilgrimage or Hajj for the\nmilions of Muslims who make the trip to Mecca. Eid ul-Adha is 4 days\nlong. Muslims who can afford to do so may sacrifice domestic animals,\nusually sheep, as a symbol of Ibrahim's sacrifice; this sacrifice is\ncalled 'Qurban.' This occurs throughout the Muslim world; the numbers\nof ritually slaughtered animals takes on huge dimensions in Mecca.\nThis year's Eid is due between 31 Dec 2006 to 2 Jan 2007. The animal\nhealth and public health authorities in the relevant countries have\nto exercise enhanced alertness to prevent the inclusion of infected\nruminants among the animals transported for slaughter. This relates\nparticularly to Saudi Arabia, where the virus has been circulating\nsince the late 90s, probably introduced from the Horn of Africa, and\nwhere millions (!) of sheep and goats, as well as large numbers of\ncattle, are to be slaughtered during the Eid.

In the newspaper article, it is said that RVF 'occasionally'\ninfects humans but has a high mortality when it does. In fact, human\ninfections are quite frequent. Humans are usually symptomatic but\ninfrequently severely ill. When hemorrhagic fever occurs, it does\nhave a high case fatality. The overall mortality from RVF is not\nknown with precision, but may be around one percent.\n2. Human infection does occur after 'close contact with contaminated\nanimal tissue,' but, it is worth emphasizing that freshly shed blood,\nand freshly dead animals, are the risk. It is generally believed that\nmeat from carcasses inactivates RVFV through post-mortem\nacidification.\nThese are not major issues, but, for the average reader, it would be\ngood to keep things clear. We are all looking forward to knowing\nwhether these are IgM antibodies and whether there are virus\nisolations.

The move comes as part of the government's efforts to\nrid the kingdom of the disease, which caused the death of more than 120\npeople and 18 000 cattle when it hit the Jizan region 4 years ago. [The\nfigures on cattle need substantiation. RVF usually affects sheep more than\ncattle. - Mod.AS]\nAgriculture minister Dr Fahd Balghaneim said the sheep culled for slaughter\nwere smuggled into the kingdom from neighboring Yemen. 'We have returned\nthe herd to Al-Tiwal border post and they are now kept in a special\nquarantine,' he said. The Ministry of Agriculture announced about 10 days\nago that 5 animals in Jizan -- 4 in Abu Areesh and 1 in Aaridah -- had\ntested positive for the disease.\nThe Health Ministry has confirmed that no RVF cases have so far been\nreported among humans in the Jizan region. 'We have inspected all patients\nadmitted to King Fahd Hospital in Jizan and the General Hospital in\nAaridha. We did not find any suspected RVF cases among them,' said Dr Tariq\nibn Ahmed Madani, an internist and adviser to health minister Dr Hamad\nAl-Manie. Madani was a member of the ministry's team who recently visited\nthe region on the instructions of Al-Manie following reports of fresh\noutbreaks of the virus in Jizan.\nDr Yaaqub Al-Mazroue, assistant deputy health minister for preventive\nmedicine, also visited Jizan and inspected the arrangements made by the\nHealth Ministry to prevent the spread of the disease as well as the\nprogress of work at disease combat centers. Madani said his team checked\nall the files of patients admitted at Jizan hospitals for the past 3 months\nto make sure they were not infected with RVF virus. The team also visited\nthe laboratory of the Agriculture Ministry and met with veterinarians and\nother experts there as well as the areas where the 5 cases were reported.\nBalghuneim urged the authorities to be cautious about the RVF virus, which\nis capable of surviving in the eggs of mosquitoes for a long time and can\nsurface whenever it finds a hospitable environment.

No human being was detected\nto have RVF. There has not been a single case of RVF detected in humans,\nQahtani said.\nRift Valley fever -- which usually affects livestock -- can strike human\nbeings, leading to the victims suffering swollen brains and burst\narteries. [This terminology might be related to difficulties along the\nArabic-English translation routes; they probably refer to the typical\ncongested and edematous brains and to subcutaneous hemorrhages,\ncharacteristic of RVF in humans. - Mod. AS].\nThe results of these tests indicate existence of limited virus activity,\nsaid the minister. [It will be interesting to learn if this activity has\nbeen detected by sero-conversion in sentinels, viral investigations in\ntrapped vectors, or otherwise. - Mod. AS].\nBalghunaim said his ministry is moving to prevent an epidemic as in 2000,\nwhen RVF appeared for the first time outside Africa with an outbreak in\nSaudi Arabia and Yemen. A total of 124 people out of 884 infected died in\nthat epidemic in Jizan which took months to subdue. Additionally, tens of\nthousands of livestock were slaughtered to prevent the disease from\nspreading. The virus had reached the Kingdom from Africa through infected\nsheep and was passed on by mosquitoes.\nMost people get a flu-like illness when infected by the RVF virus. Some may\ndevelop serious symptoms, including liver or kidney disease. At least 30\nspecies of mosquitoes are capable of carrying it from cattle or sheep to\nhumans. People also can catch it by handling the blood or fluids of an\ninfected animal.\nThe ministry has already prepared a comprehensive plan for tackling such\ncases, Balghunaim said. Preventive measures taken in 2000-2001 had included\nsending teams to Jizan to spray insecticides. Qahtani said the Health\nMinistry has already started a medical survey of the area to define the\nmagnitude of the problem. He described the medical survey as 'active phase\ndetection'. The surveillance will be conducted on all the hospitals in the\nregion. Besides, the Ministry will launch a campaign for the eradication of\nmosquitoes, which are known for spreading the RVF virus, he said.\nHe said the Ministry of Agriculture will also engage in surveillance of\nfarmlands in Jizan to detect the disease if it exists in animals. Awareness\nabout RVF is already high among people in Jizan since they experienced the\noutbreak in 2000.\nScientists say that usually only one percent of infected humans die of Rift\nValley fever. The mortality rate in animals less than a week old is 90\npercent.\nIn late September 2000, before the preventive slaughter of animals had\nbegun, the Saudi Minister of Agriculture and Water said the virus had\nkilled almost 11 000 sheep, cows and camels in the Jizan port area alone.\nAt about the same time, Yemen reported 6000 dead animals. Total livestock\nmortalities in that epidemic, including animals that were destroyed and\naborted fetuses, is estimated in the range of 40 000.\nNoted as a disease in Kenya's Rift Valley as early as the turn of the 20th\ncentury (the causative virus was isolated in 1930), RVF has been seen at\nirregular intervals on the continent, particularly after heavy rains that\nfavor mosquito breeding. The 2000 outbreak in Saudi Arabia and Yemen came\nafter a prolonged drought both in the Horn [of Africa] and in East Africa.\nAnother outbreak -- in Libya in early 1999 -- was also not associated with\nrains. [RVF has never been reported from Libya; might the Gazette be\nreferring to the human cases in the Delta area, Egypt, in 2003? see ProMED\npost 20030827.2158. - Mod. AS].\nBalghunaim said that there is no cause for panic at this stage and that the\npositive results of the samples do not necessarily mean an epidemic has\nbroken out again in Jizan. He appealed to livestock breeders in Jizan to take\nall the required precautionary measures and to cooperate with the authorities\nconcerned in this respect.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[The introduction of RVF into Yemen and southern Saudi Arabia (Jizan) in\nSeptember 2000 was the first occurrence of natural RVF infection outside\nthe African continent. The outbreak continued until the first quarter of\n2001, affecting humans and animals (mainly small ruminants) -- see refs.\nbelow.\nArboviral diseases seem to be seasonal in the Middle-East, probably related\nto enhanced vector prevalence and activity during the months August --\nDecember, c.f. bluetongue, Akabane disease, West Nile fever, ephemeral\nfever, and -- in Egypt and the Arab peninsular -- RVF.\nIn April 2004, the Saudi authorities lifted a 3 year old ban on the\nmovement of livestock between regions hit by Rift Valley Fever (RVF). The\nban was imposed on animals in Jizan, the Tihama areas of Asir, Makkah [Mecca -\nMod.JW], as well as Baha regions Qunfudha, Najran, and Tihama Qahtan.

Roads were cut and connections with other parts of the country\naffected. The rains were described as the heaviest in decades.\nA geographically expanding arboviral disease, Rift Valley fever (RVF) is\ncaused by a phlebovirus [i.e. a type of virus with a tripartite\nnegative-stranded RNA virus genome classified in the genus _Phlebovirus_ of\nthe family _Bunyaviridae_, which with the exception of Rift Valley fever\nvirus is usually transmitted by phlebotomine sandflies. -\nMod.CP]. RVF-endemic zones are often predisposed to outbreaks following\nunusually high rainfall and flooding. Heavy rainfalls also preceded the\n2000 outbreak of RVF that confirmed the endemic nature of the disease in\nSaudi Arabia.\nThe risk of RVF resurgence within the region and beyond is very high. The\nabundance of potential vectors and the exposure of susceptible domestic\nanimals that are associated closely with displaced persons further\nunderscore the immediate and long-term risks. Mosquito vectors in the\nregion include _Aedes vexans arabiensis_, _Culex pipiens_, and _Culex\ntritaeniorhynchus_. Other epidemic vectors may enter and modify the\ntransmission cycle. _Aedes albopticus_, another competent vector, exists\nin the Makkah-Jeddah axis and may be more widespread than is presently known.\n_Culicoides_ spp, usually abundant after floods, are locally endemic. RVF\nvirus (RVFV) has been isolated from biting midges in Nigeria and Kenya.\nFlood-amplified populations of phlebotomine sandflies (competent RVFV\nvectors) as well as ticks play complementary roles in RVF transmission. In\nmassive numbers, _Phlebotomus_ spp., _Simulium_ spp., _Glossina morsitans_,\nand _Culicoides_ spp. may mechanically spread RVFV.

The disease is most severe in sheep, goats\nand cattle, in which it produces abortions in pregnant animals and a high\nmortality rate in the newborn. Humans are susceptible to infection by\nhandling infected material and through transmission by mosquito vectors.\n\nEgypt was the first country to be affected by RVF outside sub-Saharan\nAfrica, namely in 1977, suffering one of the most devastating outbreaks in\nthe history of the disease. The last Egyptian reporting to the OIE on the\noccurrence of RVF in animals was in July 1993; mass vaccinations in\nruminants are carried out annually, their number in 2001 reaching 5 994\n818.

On that basis, I ventured to predict that an\noutbreak of RVF would occur. Within days we had reports of buffalo\nabortions in the Kruger National Park and a waterbuck died in an adjoining\npark. On the basis of virus isolations, PCR results and sequencing,\nhistology and immunohistochemistry, and antibody findings, we were able to\nshow that both were due to RVF; a giraffe death could not be to proved to\nbe due to RVF.\nBecause of a severe heat wave and lack of rain since then, the situation\npromptly changed. Predicted bumper crops are now teetering on the brink of\nfailure.\n\nRVF has evaporated.\n--\nProf R Swanepoel\nSpecial Pathogens Unit\nNational Institute for Virology\nPrivate Bag X4\nSandringham 2131\nRSA\nTEL: +27 11 321 4200\nFAX: +27 11 882 0596\ne-mail: bobs@niv.ac.za\n[We are indebted to Bob Swanepoel for bringing this brief story to a close.\nStill, although RVF has disappeared from the area, RVF virus surely has\nnot. This is as fascinating an infectious disease story as occurs\nanywhere. Unless and until we get a grasp of virus dynamics in\ninterepidemic/interepizootic periods, as CDC appears to be doing with\nhantaviruses in the United States, we will not be able to predict outbreaks\nwith certainty.
