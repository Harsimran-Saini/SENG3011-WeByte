Eastern Africa (04): Kenya (LK) alert, 20191112.6775112]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nFAO's Early Warning Bulletin, \"Forecasting threats to the food chain affecting food security in countries and regions\" no. 33, October-December 2019, includes the following forecast for Central and Eastern Africa, in relation to Rift Valley fever (http://www.fao.org/3/ca6744en/ca6744en.pdf, pages 7-8):\n\n\"During the past 3 months, above-average and heavy rainfall and flash floods occurred in the region particularly during the end of August and early September as well as in early October 2019. The precipitation forecasts predict above-average rains for the coming period (October-December 2019) for Chad, Central African Republic, southern the Sudan and the whole eastern Africa region. According to the FAO RVF Monitoring/Early Warning tool, there are large areas at risk of RVF vector amplification in central-southern Chad, western-central Kenya, central-southern Sudan, eastern-southern Sudan, northern Uganda, and northern Tanzania. In August 2019, the 1st confirmed case ever of RVF in humans was reported in Bangui, Central African Republic. In early October 2019, media reported suspected cases of RVF in humans and animals in Red Sea state (north-eastern Sudan) and cases of hemorrhagic fever in humans in Kassala (eastern Sudan) and North Darfur states (western Sudan). Considering the past and recent RVF outbreaks occurrence in the region, Chad, Kenya, Sudan, South Sudan, and the Central African Republic could be considered at high risk of RVF occurrence. The other countries of the region could be considered at moderate risk of RVF due to the predicted suitability for RVF vector amplification as well as the movement of potentially infected animals.\"\n\nRapporteur [JD] comment:\nThe reports of severe and widespread flooding events in recent weeks are highly reminiscent of those that preceded the widespread outbreak of RVF in eastern Africa during May-August 2018 (see FEWS article, dated 8 Nov 2019, at https://fews.net/east-africa/seasonal-monitor/november-8-2019). Precipitation anomaly mapping from satellite imagery supports media reporting of exceptionally high levels of rainfall during early November and the preceding 90-day period of August-October in the same areas of eastern Africa most affected by a major outbreak of RVF in 2018.\n\nA comparison of 90 day rainfall anomalies from March-May 2018 and August-November 2019 indicates high risk for an even more extensive regional RVF outbreak in East Africa during the next few months, with very large high risk precipitation index areas covering most of Ethiopia, South Sudan, Sudan, Somalia, Uganda, and parts of Tanzania.\n\nDrought periods in southern Africa are often associated with unusually high levels of rainfall in East Africa -- and vice versa.\n\nBackground references\n---------------------\n1.

From the said East Africa Seasonal Monitor, we hereby copy the segment addressing Kenya:\n\n\"In Kenya, flash floods were reported to have adversely affected about 25 counties, especially Marsabit, Wajir, Garissa, Turkana, and Kitui. The recent floods caused human and livestock fatalities and damage to infrastructure. Over 48 people lost their lives and 144 000 are estimated to have been displaced. However, the on-going short-rains performance has been largely beneficial for rangeland and cropping conditions across the most vulnerable pastoral and marginal agropastoral communities. There is an increased likelihood for the above-average crop yield prospects if the rainfall forecast for enhanced rains continue into December. On the other hand, there are concerns for pre-and post-harvest losses in the Western and North-Rift counties of Kenya due to on-going rains in the harvesting and drying period. There is also an elevated risk of further flooding at the peak of the rainfall season in November, which is associated with an increased incidence of malaria, water-borne diseases, and RVF.\"\n\nThe mechanisms that maintain the RVF arbovirus in nature and cause it to emerge in epidemic form are incompletely understood and might differ between areas. Transmission cycles are best understood in savanna regions, where the virus is thought to survive between outbreaks in the dried eggs of _Aedes_ mosquitoes found in shallow depressions in the soil (dambos). Infected mosquitoes are thought to hatch when the dambos fill after heavy rainfall and initiate transmission cycles involving additional mosquito species, and animals that act as amplifying hosts. The vertebrate amplifying hosts are thought to be critical in propagating epidemics. In Kenya's Savanna grasslands, the rainfall of between 500-1250 mm (20-50 inches) is concentrated into March-May (long rains) and September-October (short rains) and there is a long dry season in between; there are multi-annual fluctuations as well. Additional and updated details in ref 1 below.\n\nRVFV introductions into Egypt in 1977 and the Arabian Peninsula in 2000 followed epizootics in Sudan in 1976 and the Horn of Africa in 1998, respectively; the mode(s) of inter-boundary transmission yet to be fully clarified; in Egypt, the main suggested vector was _Culex pipiens_. The potential for the globalization of arboviruses has been demonstrated by various disease agents (such as West Nile, chikungunya, Zika viruses).\n\nMany thanks to Joe for his valuable comment.\n\nReference\n---------\n1.

Once an outbreak occurs, it is too late. Intensified surveillance for early detection of RVF cases in livestock and humans in high-risk areas is also advisable, as well as monitoring of populations of mosquito vectors for abundance and virus presence. However, these measures may be difficult logistically in flooded areas. - Mod.TY\n\nMaps of Kenya: https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/7CB45377C5B8B126852573E800658AD9-depha_REF_ken080131_a.pdf and http://healthmap.org/promed/p/21118]\nSee Also\nRift Valley fever -

The precipitation forecasts predict above-average rains for the coming period (October-December 2019) for Chad, Central African Republic, southern the Sudan and the whole eastern Africa region. According to the FAO RVF Monitoring/Early Warning tool, there are large areas at risk of RVF vector amplification in central-southern Chad, western-central Kenya, central-southern Sudan, eastern-southern Sudan, northern Uganda, and northern Tanzania. In August 2019, the 1st confirmed case ever of RVF in humans was reported in Bangui, Central African Republic. In early October 2019, media reported suspected cases of RVF in humans and animals in Red Sea state (north-eastern Sudan) and cases of hemorrhagic fever in humans in Kassala (eastern Sudan) and North Darfur states (western Sudan). Considering the past and recent RVF outbreaks occurrence in the region, Chad, Kenya, Sudan, South Sudan, and the Central African Republic could be considered at high risk of RVF occurrence. The other countries of the region could be considered at moderate risk of RVF due to the predicted suitability for RVF vector amplification as well as the movement of potentially infected animals.\"\n\nRapporteur [JD] comment:\nThe reports of severe and widespread flooding events in recent weeks are highly reminiscent of those that preceded the widespread outbreak of RVF in eastern Africa during May-August 2018 (see FEWS article, dated 8 Nov 2019, at https://fews.net/east-africa/seasonal-monitor/november-8-2019). Precipitation anomaly mapping from satellite imagery supports media reporting of exceptionally high levels of rainfall during early November and the preceding 90-day period of August-October in the same areas of eastern Africa most affected by a major outbreak of RVF in 2018.\n\nA comparison of 90 day rainfall anomalies from March-May 2018 and August-November 2019 indicates high risk for an even more extensive regional RVF outbreak in East Africa during the next few months, with very large high risk precipitation index areas covering most of Ethiopia, South Sudan, Sudan, Somalia, Uganda, and parts of Tanzania.\n\nDrought periods in southern Africa are often associated with unusually high levels of rainfall in East Africa -- and vice versa.\n\nBackground references\n---------------------\n1.

From the said East Africa Seasonal Monitor, we hereby copy the segment addressing Kenya:\n\n\"In Kenya, flash floods were reported to have adversely affected about 25 counties, especially Marsabit, Wajir, Garissa, Turkana, and Kitui. The recent floods caused human and livestock fatalities and damage to infrastructure. Over 48 people lost their lives and 144 000 are estimated to have been displaced. However, the on-going short-rains performance has been largely beneficial for rangeland and cropping conditions across the most vulnerable pastoral and marginal agropastoral communities. There is an increased likelihood for the above-average crop yield prospects if the rainfall forecast for enhanced rains continue into December. On the other hand, there are concerns for pre-and post-harvest losses in the Western and North-Rift counties of Kenya due to on-going rains in the harvesting and drying period. There is also an elevated risk of further flooding at the peak of the rainfall season in November, which is associated with an increased incidence of malaria, water-borne diseases, and RVF.\"\n\nThe mechanisms that maintain the RVF arbovirus in nature and cause it to emerge in epidemic form are incompletely understood and might differ between areas. Transmission cycles are best understood in savanna regions, where the virus is thought to survive between outbreaks in the dried eggs of _Aedes_ mosquitoes found in shallow depressions in the soil (dambos). Infected mosquitoes are thought to hatch when the dambos fill after heavy rainfall and initiate transmission cycles involving additional mosquito species, and animals that act as amplifying hosts. The vertebrate amplifying hosts are thought to be critical in propagating epidemics. In Kenya's Savanna grasslands, the rainfall of between 500-1250 mm (20-50 inches) is concentrated into March-May (long rains) and September-October (short rains) and there is a long dry season in between; there are multi-annual fluctuations as well. Additional and updated details in ref 1 below.\n\nRVFV introductions into Egypt in 1977 and the Arabian Peninsula in 2000 followed epizootics in Sudan in 1976 and the Horn of Africa in 1998, respectively; the mode(s) of inter-boundary transmission yet to be fully clarified; in Egypt, the main suggested vector was _Culex pipiens_. The potential for the globalization of arboviruses has been demonstrated by various disease agents (such as West Nile, chikungunya, Zika viruses).\n\nMany thanks to Joe for his valuable comment.\n\nReference\n---------\n1.

Once an outbreak occurs, it is too late. Intensified surveillance for early detection of RVF cases in livestock and humans in high-risk areas is also advisable, as well as monitoring of populations of mosquito vectors for abundance and virus presence. However, these measures may be difficult logistically in flooded areas. - Mod.TY\n\nMaps of Kenya: https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/7CB45377C5B8B126852573E800658AD9-depha_REF_ken080131_a.pdf and http://healthmap.org/promed/p/21118]\nSee Also\nRift Valley fever -

The other countries of the region could be considered at moderate risk of RVF due to the predicted suitability for RVF vector amplification as well as the movement of potentially infected animals.\"\n\nRapporteur [JD] comment:\nThe reports of severe and widespread flooding events in recent weeks are highly reminiscent of those that preceded the widespread outbreak of RVF in eastern Africa during May-August 2018 (see FEWS article, dated 8 Nov 2019, at https://fews.net/east-africa/seasonal-monitor/november-8-2019). Precipitation anomaly mapping from satellite imagery supports media reporting of exceptionally high levels of rainfall during early November and the preceding 90-day period of August-October in the same areas of eastern Africa most affected by a major outbreak of RVF in 2018.\n\nA comparison of 90 day rainfall anomalies from March-May 2018 and August-November 2019 indicates high risk for an even more extensive regional RVF outbreak in East Africa during the next few months, with very large high risk precipitation index areas covering most of Ethiopia, South Sudan, Sudan, Somalia, Uganda, and parts of Tanzania.\n\nDrought periods in southern Africa are often associated with unusually high levels of rainfall in East Africa -- and vice versa.\n\nBackground references\n---------------------\n1.

From the said East Africa Seasonal Monitor, we hereby copy the segment addressing Kenya:\n\n\"In Kenya, flash floods were reported to have adversely affected about 25 counties, especially Marsabit, Wajir, Garissa, Turkana, and Kitui. The recent floods caused human and livestock fatalities and damage to infrastructure. Over 48 people lost their lives and 144 000 are estimated to have been displaced. However, the on-going short-rains performance has been largely beneficial for rangeland and cropping conditions across the most vulnerable pastoral and marginal agropastoral communities. There is an increased likelihood for the above-average crop yield prospects if the rainfall forecast for enhanced rains continue into December. On the other hand, there are concerns for pre-and post-harvest losses in the Western and North-Rift counties of Kenya due to on-going rains in the harvesting and drying period. There is also an elevated risk of further flooding at the peak of the rainfall season in November, which is associated with an increased incidence of malaria, water-borne diseases, and RVF.\"\n\nThe mechanisms that maintain the RVF arbovirus in nature and cause it to emerge in epidemic form are incompletely understood and might differ between areas. Transmission cycles are best understood in savanna regions, where the virus is thought to survive between outbreaks in the dried eggs of _Aedes_ mosquitoes found in shallow depressions in the soil (dambos). Infected mosquitoes are thought to hatch when the dambos fill after heavy rainfall and initiate transmission cycles involving additional mosquito species, and animals that act as amplifying hosts. The vertebrate amplifying hosts are thought to be critical in propagating epidemics. In Kenya's Savanna grasslands, the rainfall of between 500-1250 mm (20-50 inches) is concentrated into March-May (long rains) and September-October (short rains) and there is a long dry season in between; there are multi-annual fluctuations as well. Additional and updated details in ref 1 below.\n\nRVFV introductions into Egypt in 1977 and the Arabian Peninsula in 2000 followed epizootics in Sudan in 1976 and the Horn of Africa in 1998, respectively; the mode(s) of inter-boundary transmission yet to be fully clarified; in Egypt, the main suggested vector was _Culex pipiens_. The potential for the globalization of arboviruses has been demonstrated by various disease agents (such as West Nile, chikungunya, Zika viruses).\n\nMany thanks to Joe for his valuable comment.\n\nReference\n---------\n1.

Once an outbreak occurs, it is too late. Intensified surveillance for early detection of RVF cases in livestock and humans in high-risk areas is also advisable, as well as monitoring of populations of mosquito vectors for abundance and virus presence.

The precipitation forecasts predict above-average rains for the coming period (October-December 2019) for Chad, Central African Republic, southern the Sudan and the whole eastern Africa region. According to the FAO RVF Monitoring/Early Warning tool, there are large areas at risk of RVF vector amplification in central-southern Chad, western-central Kenya, central-southern Sudan, eastern-southern Sudan, northern Uganda, and northern Tanzania. In August 2019, the 1st confirmed case ever of RVF in humans was reported in Bangui, Central African Republic. In early October 2019, media reported suspected cases of RVF in humans and animals in Red Sea state (north-eastern Sudan) and cases of hemorrhagic fever in humans in Kassala (eastern Sudan) and North Darfur states (western Sudan). Considering the past and recent RVF outbreaks occurrence in the region, Chad, Kenya, Sudan, South Sudan, and the Central African Republic could be considered at high risk of RVF occurrence.

The precipitation forecasts predict above-average rains for the coming period (October-December 2019) for Chad, Central African Republic, southern the Sudan and the whole eastern Africa region. According to the FAO RVF Monitoring/Early Warning tool, there are large areas at risk of RVF vector amplification in central-southern Chad, western-central Kenya, central-southern Sudan, eastern-southern Sudan, northern Uganda, and northern Tanzania. In August 2019, the 1st confirmed case ever of RVF in humans was reported in Bangui, Central African Republic. In early October 2019, media reported suspected cases of RVF in humans and animals in Red Sea state (north-eastern Sudan) and cases of hemorrhagic fever in humans in Kassala (eastern Sudan) and North Darfur states (western Sudan). Considering the past and recent RVF outbreaks occurrence in the region, Chad, Kenya, Sudan, South Sudan, and the Central African Republic could be considered at high risk of RVF occurrence. The other countries of the region could be considered at moderate risk of RVF due to the predicted suitability for RVF vector amplification as well as the movement of potentially infected animals.\"\n\nRapporteur [JD] comment:\nThe reports of severe and widespread flooding events in recent weeks are highly reminiscent of those that preceded the widespread outbreak of RVF in eastern Africa during May-August 2018 (see FEWS article, dated 8 Nov 2019, at https://fews.net/east-africa/seasonal-monitor/november-8-2019). Precipitation anomaly mapping from satellite imagery supports media reporting of exceptionally high levels of rainfall during early November and the preceding 90-day period of August-October in the same areas of eastern Africa most affected by a major outbreak of RVF in 2018.\n\nA comparison of 90 day rainfall anomalies from March-May 2018 and August-November 2019 indicates high risk for an even more extensive regional RVF outbreak in East Africa during the next few months, with very large high risk precipitation index areas covering most of Ethiopia, South Sudan, Sudan, Somalia, Uganda, and parts of Tanzania.\n\nDrought periods in southern Africa are often associated with unusually high levels of rainfall in East Africa -- and vice versa.\n\nBackground references\n---------------------\n1.

From the said East Africa Seasonal Monitor, we hereby copy the segment addressing Kenya:\n\n\"In Kenya, flash floods were reported to have adversely affected about 25 counties, especially Marsabit, Wajir, Garissa, Turkana, and Kitui. The recent floods caused human and livestock fatalities and damage to infrastructure. Over 48 people lost their lives and 144 000 are estimated to have been displaced. However, the on-going short-rains performance has been largely beneficial for rangeland and cropping conditions across the most vulnerable pastoral and marginal agropastoral communities. There is an increased likelihood for the above-average crop yield prospects if the rainfall forecast for enhanced rains continue into December. On the other hand, there are concerns for pre-and post-harvest losses in the Western and North-Rift counties of Kenya due to on-going rains in the harvesting and drying period. There is also an elevated risk of further flooding at the peak of the rainfall season in November, which is associated with an increased incidence of malaria, water-borne diseases, and RVF.\"\n\nThe mechanisms that maintain the RVF arbovirus in nature and cause it to emerge in epidemic form are incompletely understood and might differ between areas. Transmission cycles are best understood in savanna regions, where the virus is thought to survive between outbreaks in the dried eggs of _Aedes_ mosquitoes found in shallow depressions in the soil (dambos). Infected mosquitoes are thought to hatch when the dambos fill after heavy rainfall and initiate transmission cycles involving additional mosquito species, and animals that act as amplifying hosts. The vertebrate amplifying hosts are thought to be critical in propagating epidemics. In Kenya's Savanna grasslands, the rainfall of between 500-1250 mm (20-50 inches) is concentrated into March-May (long rains) and September-October (short rains) and there is a long dry season in between; there are multi-annual fluctuations as well. Additional and updated details in ref 1 below.\n\nRVFV introductions into Egypt in 1977 and the Arabian Peninsula in 2000 followed epizootics in Sudan in 1976 and the Horn of Africa in 1998, respectively; the mode(s) of inter-boundary transmission yet to be fully clarified; in Egypt, the main suggested vector was _Culex pipiens_. The potential for the globalization of arboviruses has been demonstrated by various disease agents (such as West Nile, chikungunya, Zika viruses).\n\nMany thanks to Joe for his valuable comment.\n\nReference\n---------\n1.

Once an outbreak occurs, it is too late. Intensified surveillance for early detection of RVF cases in livestock and humans in high-risk areas is also advisable, as well as monitoring of populations of mosquito vectors for abundance and virus presence. However, these measures may be difficult logistically in flooded areas. - Mod.TY\n\nMaps of Kenya: https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/7CB45377C5B8B126852573E800658AD9-depha_REF_ken080131_a.pdf and http://healthmap.org/promed/p/21118]\nSee Also\nRift Valley fever -

Additional and updated details in ref 1 below.\n\nRVFV introductions into Egypt in 1977 and the Arabian Peninsula in 2000 followed epizootics in Sudan in 1976 and the Horn of Africa in 1998, respectively; the mode(s) of inter-boundary transmission yet to be fully clarified; in Egypt, the main suggested vector was _Culex pipiens_. The potential for the globalization of arboviruses has been demonstrated by various disease agents (such as West Nile, chikungunya, Zika viruses).\n\nMany thanks to Joe for his valuable comment.\n\nReference\n---------\n1.

Once an outbreak occurs, it is too late. Intensified surveillance for early detection of RVF cases in livestock and humans in high-risk areas is also advisable, as well as monitoring of populations of mosquito vectors for abundance and virus presence. However, these measures may be difficult logistically in flooded areas. - Mod.TY\n\nMaps of Kenya: https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/7CB45377C5B8B126852573E800658AD9-depha_REF_ken080131_a.pdf and http://healthmap.org/promed/p/21118]\nSee Also\nRift Valley fever -

Eastern Africa (04): Kenya (LK) alert, 20191112.6775112]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nFAO's Early Warning Bulletin, \"Forecasting threats to the food chain affecting food security in countries and regions\" no. 33, October-December 2019, includes the following forecast for Central and Eastern Africa, in relation to Rift Valley fever (http://www.fao.org/3/ca6744en/ca6744en.pdf, pages 7-8):\n\n\"During the past 3 months, above-average and heavy rainfall and flash floods occurred in the region particularly during the end of August and early September as well as in early October 2019. The precipitation forecasts predict above-average rains for the coming period (October-December 2019) for Chad, Central African Republic, southern the Sudan and the whole eastern Africa region. According to the FAO RVF Monitoring/Early Warning tool, there are large areas at risk of RVF vector amplification in central-southern Chad, western-central Kenya, central-southern Sudan, eastern-southern Sudan, northern Uganda, and northern Tanzania. In August 2019, the 1st confirmed case ever of RVF in humans was reported in Bangui, Central African Republic. In early October 2019, media reported suspected cases of RVF in humans and animals in Red Sea state (north-eastern Sudan) and cases of hemorrhagic fever in humans in Kassala (eastern Sudan) and North Darfur states (western Sudan). Considering the past and recent RVF outbreaks occurrence in the region, Chad, Kenya, Sudan, South Sudan, and the Central African Republic could be considered at high risk of RVF occurrence. The other countries of the region could be considered at moderate risk of RVF due to the predicted suitability for RVF vector amplification as well as the movement of potentially infected animals.\"\n\nRapporteur [JD] comment:\nThe reports of severe and widespread flooding events in recent weeks are highly reminiscent of those that preceded the widespread outbreak of RVF in eastern Africa during May-August 2018 (see FEWS article, dated 8 Nov 2019, at https://fews.net/east-africa/seasonal-monitor/november-8-2019). Precipitation anomaly mapping from satellite imagery supports media reporting of exceptionally high levels of rainfall during early November and the preceding 90-day period of August-October in the same areas of eastern Africa most affected by a major outbreak of RVF in 2018.\n\nA comparison of 90 day rainfall anomalies from March-May 2018 and August-November 2019 indicates high risk for an even more extensive regional RVF outbreak in East Africa during the next few months, with very large high risk precipitation index areas covering most of Ethiopia, South Sudan, Sudan, Somalia, Uganda, and parts of Tanzania.\n\nDrought periods in southern Africa are often associated with unusually high levels of rainfall in East Africa -- and vice versa.\n\nBackground references\n---------------------\n1.

From the said East Africa Seasonal Monitor, we hereby copy the segment addressing Kenya:\n\n\"In Kenya, flash floods were reported to have adversely affected about 25 counties, especially Marsabit, Wajir, Garissa, Turkana, and Kitui. The recent floods caused human and livestock fatalities and damage to infrastructure. Over 48 people lost their lives and 144 000 are estimated to have been displaced. However, the on-going short-rains performance has been largely beneficial for rangeland and cropping conditions across the most vulnerable pastoral and marginal agropastoral communities. There is an increased likelihood for the above-average crop yield prospects if the rainfall forecast for enhanced rains continue into December. On the other hand, there are concerns for pre-and post-harvest losses in the Western and North-Rift counties of Kenya due to on-going rains in the harvesting and drying period. There is also an elevated risk of further flooding at the peak of the rainfall season in November, which is associated with an increased incidence of malaria, water-borne diseases, and RVF.\"\n\nThe mechanisms that maintain the RVF arbovirus in nature and cause it to emerge in epidemic form are incompletely understood and might differ between areas. Transmission cycles are best understood in savanna regions, where the virus is thought to survive between outbreaks in the dried eggs of _Aedes_ mosquitoes found in shallow depressions in the soil (dambos). Infected mosquitoes are thought to hatch when the dambos fill after heavy rainfall and initiate transmission cycles involving additional mosquito species, and animals that act as amplifying hosts. The vertebrate amplifying hosts are thought to be critical in propagating epidemics. In Kenya's Savanna grasslands, the rainfall of between 500-1250 mm (20-50 inches) is concentrated into March-May (long rains) and September-October (short rains) and there is a long dry season in between; there are multi-annual fluctuations as well. Additional and updated details in ref 1 below.\n\nRVFV introductions into Egypt in 1977 and the Arabian Peninsula in 2000 followed epizootics in Sudan in 1976 and the Horn of Africa in 1998, respectively; the mode(s) of inter-boundary transmission yet to be fully clarified; in Egypt, the main suggested vector was _Culex pipiens_. The potential for the globalization of arboviruses has been demonstrated by various disease agents (such as West Nile, chikungunya, Zika viruses).\n\nMany thanks to Joe for his valuable comment.\n\nReference\n---------\n1.

Eastern Africa (04): Kenya (LK) alert, 20191112.6775112]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nFAO's Early Warning Bulletin, \"Forecasting threats to the food chain affecting food security in countries and regions\" no. 33, October-December 2019, includes the following forecast for Central and Eastern Africa, in relation to Rift Valley fever (http://www.fao.org/3/ca6744en/ca6744en.pdf, pages 7-8):\n\n\"During the past 3 months, above-average and heavy rainfall and flash floods occurred in the region particularly during the end of August and early September as well as in early October 2019. The precipitation forecasts predict above-average rains for the coming period (October-December 2019) for Chad, Central African Republic, southern the Sudan and the whole eastern Africa region. According to the FAO RVF Monitoring/Early Warning tool, there are large areas at risk of RVF vector amplification in central-southern Chad, western-central Kenya, central-southern Sudan, eastern-southern Sudan, northern Uganda, and northern Tanzania. In August 2019, the 1st confirmed case ever of RVF in humans was reported in Bangui, Central African Republic. In early October 2019, media reported suspected cases of RVF in humans and animals in Red Sea state (north-eastern Sudan) and cases of hemorrhagic fever in humans in Kassala (eastern Sudan) and North Darfur states (western Sudan). Considering the past and recent RVF outbreaks occurrence in the region, Chad, Kenya, Sudan, South Sudan, and the Central African Republic could be considered at high risk of RVF occurrence. The other countries of the region could be considered at moderate risk of RVF due to the predicted suitability for RVF vector amplification as well as the movement of potentially infected animals.\"\n\nRapporteur [JD] comment:\nThe reports of severe and widespread flooding events in recent weeks are highly reminiscent of those that preceded the widespread outbreak of RVF in eastern Africa during May-August 2018 (see FEWS article, dated 8 Nov 2019, at https://fews.net/east-africa/seasonal-monitor/november-8-2019). Precipitation anomaly mapping from satellite imagery supports media reporting of exceptionally high levels of rainfall during early November and the preceding 90-day period of August-October in the same areas of eastern Africa most affected by a major outbreak of RVF in 2018.\n\nA comparison of 90 day rainfall anomalies from March-May 2018 and August-November 2019 indicates high risk for an even more extensive regional RVF outbreak in East Africa during the next few months, with very large high risk precipitation index areas covering most of Ethiopia, South Sudan, Sudan, Somalia, Uganda, and parts of Tanzania.\n\nDrought periods in southern Africa are often associated with unusually high levels of rainfall in East Africa -- and vice versa.\n\nBackground references\n---------------------\n1.

From the said East Africa Seasonal Monitor, we hereby copy the segment addressing Kenya:\n\n\"In Kenya, flash floods were reported to have adversely affected about 25 counties, especially Marsabit, Wajir, Garissa, Turkana, and Kitui. The recent floods caused human and livestock fatalities and damage to infrastructure. Over 48 people lost their lives and 144 000 are estimated to have been displaced. However, the on-going short-rains performance has been largely beneficial for rangeland and cropping conditions across the most vulnerable pastoral and marginal agropastoral communities. There is an increased likelihood for the above-average crop yield prospects if the rainfall forecast for enhanced rains continue into December. On the other hand, there are concerns for pre-and post-harvest losses in the Western and North-Rift counties of Kenya due to on-going rains in the harvesting and drying period. There is also an elevated risk of further flooding at the peak of the rainfall season in November, which is associated with an increased incidence of malaria, water-borne diseases, and RVF.\"\n\nThe mechanisms that maintain the RVF arbovirus in nature and cause it to emerge in epidemic form are incompletely understood and might differ between areas. Transmission cycles are best understood in savanna regions, where the virus is thought to survive between outbreaks in the dried eggs of _Aedes_ mosquitoes found in shallow depressions in the soil (dambos). Infected mosquitoes are thought to hatch when the dambos fill after heavy rainfall and initiate transmission cycles involving additional mosquito species, and animals that act as amplifying hosts. The vertebrate amplifying hosts are thought to be critical in propagating epidemics. In Kenya's Savanna grasslands, the rainfall of between 500-1250 mm (20-50 inches) is concentrated into March-May (long rains) and September-October (short rains) and there is a long dry season in between; there are multi-annual fluctuations as well. Additional and updated details in ref 1 below.\n\nRVFV introductions into Egypt in 1977 and the Arabian Peninsula in 2000 followed epizootics in Sudan in 1976 and the Horn of Africa in 1998, respectively; the mode(s) of inter-boundary transmission yet to be fully clarified; in Egypt, the main suggested vector was _Culex pipiens_. The potential for the globalization of arboviruses has been demonstrated by various disease agents (such as West Nile, chikungunya, Zika viruses).\n\nMany thanks to Joe for his valuable comment.\n\nReference\n---------\n1.

Once an outbreak occurs, it is too late. Intensified surveillance for early detection of RVF cases in livestock and humans in high-risk areas is also advisable, as well as monitoring of populations of mosquito vectors for abundance and virus presence. However, these measures may be difficult logistically in flooded areas. - Mod.TY\n\nMaps of Kenya: https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/7CB45377C5B8B126852573E800658AD9-depha_REF_ken080131_a.pdf and http://healthmap.org/promed/p/21118]\nSee Also\nRift Valley fever -

Hatem pointed out that the Federal Minister of Health commissioned a team to investigate the injuries, [which] arrived in the villages of Artoli, Al-Bawqa, and Fatwwar [Fri 11 Oct 2019], before the disease was officially announced today [12 Oct 2019]. He pointed out that RVF is common between humans and animals, so the Ministry of Health pledged to provide basic aid in cooperation with local authorities and resistance committees in these villages to combat the disease.\n\nSimilar fevers have recently spread in the Red Sea state in the Arbaat region, and was visited by Federal Health Minister Akram al-Tom.\"\n(https://khartoumstar.com/en/2019/10/12/ministry-of-health-rift-valley-fever-in-northern-sudan/).\n\nThe report above seems to present (national) laboratory confirmation of RVF currently affecting humans in Sudan's River Nile's state.\n\nAn earlier suspected RVF outbreak in Sudan's adjacent Red Sea State (see archive 20180410.5735975), has been confirmed; it was officially reported to the OIE on 13 Oct 2019 in an immediate notification (https://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=32098). The report addresses an outbreak in a village in the [Arbaat] dam area, Alghunub Wa Alolaib, Red Sea State, affecting 950 susceptible goats, among which 21 \"cases\", 4 deaths, no culling or slaughter applied. The given date of start of the outbreak is 25 Sep 2019. The report includes the following epidemiological comments:\n\"There were few abortions in goat herds observed after heavy flooding in September 2019. There are no cattle or sheep populations in the area.\nIt is a dry area within the series of the Red Sea Hills. Surveillance, biosecurity measures, and increased awareness is ongoing.\"\n\nOfficial confirmation of the outbreaks in the Red Sea State is anticipated.\n\nThe 1st outbreak of RVF in Sudan was reported in 1973 among sheep and cattle in the White Nile State. In 1977, camels from Sudan were one of the suggested sources of RVF virus introduced, for the 1st time, into Egypt. Throughout the years, this virus was reported several times from humans and animals in Sudan.

Hatem pointed out that the Federal Minister of Health commissioned a team to investigate the injuries, [which] arrived in the villages of Artoli, Al-Bawqa, and Fatwwar [Fri 11 Oct 2019], before the disease was officially announced today [12 Oct 2019]. He pointed out that RVF is common between humans and animals, so the Ministry of Health pledged to provide basic aid in cooperation with local authorities and resistance committees in these villages to combat the disease.\n\nSimilar fevers have recently spread in the Red Sea state in the Arbaat region, and was visited by Federal Health Minister Akram al-Tom.\"\n(https://khartoumstar.com/en/2019/10/12/ministry-of-health-rift-valley-fever-in-northern-sudan/).\n\nThe report above seems to present (national) laboratory confirmation of RVF currently affecting humans in Sudan's River Nile's state.\n\nAn earlier suspected RVF outbreak in Sudan's adjacent Red Sea State (see archive 20180410.5735975), has been confirmed; it was officially reported to the OIE on 13 Oct 2019 in an immediate notification (https://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=32098). The report addresses an outbreak in a village in the [Arbaat] dam area, Alghunub Wa Alolaib, Red Sea State, affecting 950 susceptible goats, among which 21 \"cases\", 4 deaths, no culling or slaughter applied. The given date of start of the outbreak is 25 Sep 2019. The report includes the following epidemiological comments:\n\"There were few abortions in goat herds observed after heavy flooding in September 2019. There are no cattle or sheep populations in the area.\nIt is a dry area within the series of the Red Sea Hills. Surveillance, biosecurity measures, and increased awareness is ongoing.\"\n\nOfficial confirmation of the outbreaks in the Red Sea State is anticipated.\n\nThe 1st outbreak of RVF in Sudan was reported in 1973 among sheep and cattle in the White Nile State. In 1977, camels from Sudan were one of the suggested sources of RVF virus introduced, for the 1st time, into Egypt. Throughout the years, this virus was reported several times from humans and animals in Sudan. In 2010, a seroepidemiologic survey revealed a high prevalence of RVFV IgG among febrile patients admitted to New Halfa Hospital in Kassala State (ref. 1).\n\nReference\n---------\n1.

Due to the drought conditions prevailing at that time, which are regarded unfavourable for vector amplification, Rift Valley fever (RVF) was not suspected. However, when 2 RVF cases were diagnosed in humans in February 2019 in Ol Kalou, the capital of Nyandarua County (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20190213.6315356), surveillance in animals, particularly addressing aborting cattle, was intensified. This led to the discovery of RVF in animals as described in the OIE notification. Mass vaccination followed.\n\nIn June-July 2018, a major RVF epidemic hit Kenya, particularly in its eastern area, affecting both humans and animals; 10 outbreaks were reported. These outbreaks were located in the counties of Wajir, Tana River, Isiolo, Siaya, Baringo, Marsabit, Mandera, and Meru. The event was resolved on 30 Jul 2018. See event summary and updated map at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=26827.

However, when 2 RVF cases were diagnosed in humans in February 2019 in Ol Kalou, the capital of Nyandarua County (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20190213.6315356), surveillance in animals, particularly addressing aborting cattle, was intensified.

Mass vaccination followed.\n\nIn June-July 2018, a major RVF epidemic hit Kenya, particularly in its eastern area, affecting both humans and animals; 10 outbreaks were reported. These outbreaks were located in the counties of Wajir, Tana River, Isiolo, Siaya, Baringo, Marsabit, Mandera, and Meru. The event was resolved on 30 Jul 2018.

Due to the drought conditions prevailing at that time, which are regarded unfavourable for vector amplification, Rift Valley fever (RVF) was not suspected. However, when 2 RVF cases were diagnosed in humans in February 2019 in Ol Kalou, the capital of Nyandarua County (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20190213.6315356), surveillance in animals, particularly addressing aborting cattle, was intensified. This led to the discovery of RVF in animals as described in the OIE notification. Mass vaccination followed.\n\nIn June-July 2018, a major RVF epidemic hit Kenya, particularly in its eastern area, affecting both humans and animals; 10 outbreaks were reported. These outbreaks were located in the counties of Wajir, Tana River, Isiolo, Siaya, Baringo, Marsabit, Mandera, and Meru. The event was resolved on 30 Jul 2018.

Due to the drought conditions prevailing at that time, which are regarded unfavourable for vector amplification, Rift Valley fever (RVF) was not suspected. However, when 2 RVF cases were diagnosed in humans in February 2019 in Ol Kalou, the capital of Nyandarua County (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20190213.6315356), surveillance in animals, particularly addressing aborting cattle, was intensified. This led to the discovery of RVF in animals as described in the OIE notification. Mass vaccination followed.\n\nIn June-July 2018, a major RVF epidemic hit Kenya, particularly in its eastern area, affecting both humans and animals; 10 outbreaks were reported. These outbreaks were located in the counties of Wajir, Tana River, Isiolo, Siaya, Baringo, Marsabit, Mandera, and Meru. The event was resolved on 30 Jul 2018.

Due to the drought conditions prevailing at that time, which are regarded unfavourable for vector amplification, Rift Valley fever (RVF) was not suspected. However, when 2 RVF cases were diagnosed in humans in February 2019 in Ol Kalou, the capital of Nyandarua County (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20190213.6315356), surveillance in animals, particularly addressing aborting cattle, was intensified. This led to the discovery of RVF in animals as described in the OIE notification. Mass vaccination followed.\n\nIn June-July 2018, a major RVF epidemic hit Kenya, particularly in its eastern area, affecting both humans and animals; 10 outbreaks were reported. These outbreaks were located in the counties of Wajir, Tana River, Isiolo, Siaya, Baringo, Marsabit, Mandera, and Meru. The event was resolved on 30 Jul 2018. See event summary and updated map at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=26827. In the same period, RVF infections occurred also in Uganda and Rwanda. - Mods.AS/CRD\n\nHealthMap/ProMED-mail maps:\nMurang'a, Central, Kenya: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/12065\nNyanduma Location, Central, Kenya: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/13440]\nSee Also\nRift Valley fever - Eastern Africa: Kenya 20190213.6315356\nRift Valley fever: vertical transmission, comments, details 20190108.6248825\n2018\n---\nRift Valley fever - Eastern Africa (27): Uganda, Kenya, animal, spread 20180811.5959420\nRift Valley fever - Eastern Africa (24): Kenya, animal, spread, vacc, RFI 20180806.5950711\nRift Valley fever - Eastern Africa (21): Kenya, animal, spread 20180725.5927531\nRift Valley fever - Eastern Africa (20): Kenya 20180725.5925837\nRift Valley fever - Eastern Africa (16): Kenya, animal, spread, control 20180716.5909071\nRift Valley fever - Eastern Africa (15): Kenya 20180714.5906083\nRift Valley fever - Eastern Africa (10): Kenya, WHO, livestock vaccination 20180704.5886934\nRift Valley fever - Eastern Africa (09): Kenya, animals 20180702.5885427\nRift Valley fever - Eastern Africa (08): Kenya, Uganda, human, animals, spread 20180701.5884295\nRift Valley fever - Eastern Africa (07): Kenya, animals, spread 20180626.5877838\nRift Valley fever - Eastern Africa (06): Kenya, South Africa 20180625.5875458\nRift Valley fever - Eastern Africa (05): regional cooperation 20180625.5874116\nRift Valley fever - Eastern Africa (04): Kenya 20180622.5869367\nRift Valley fever - Eastern Africa (03): Kenya 20180621.5866921\nRift Valley fever - Eastern Africa (02): Kenya 20180620.5865028\nRift Valley fever - Kenya (06): (WJ) 20180619.5863401\nRift Valley fever - Kenya (05): (WJ) WHO 20180619.5862204\nRift Valley fever - Kenya (04): (WJ) 20180615.5858590\nRift Valley fever - Kenya (03): (WJ) camel, human, OIE 20180609.5847976\nRift Valley fever - Kenya (02): (WJ) susp 20180609.5847216\nRift Valley fever - Kenya: alert, prevention 20180531.5830703\n.................................................crd/as/tw/sh", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "rift valley fever"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2019-02-28 00:00:00", "2019-01-25 00:00:00", "2019-02-27 00:00:00", "2018-03-16 00:00:00", "2019-01-25 00:00:00", "2019-02-25 00:00:00", "2019-02-27 00:00:00", "2019-02-27 00:00:00", "2018-12-16 00:00:00", "2019-02-16 00:00:00", "2018-07-30 00:00:00", "2018-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-27 00:00:00", "2021-03-24 00:00:00", "2021-03-21 00:00:00", "2021-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-09 00:00:00", "2021-03-08 00:00:00", "2021-03-07 00:00:00", "2021-03-06 00:00:00", "2021-03-05 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-06 00:00:00", "2021-03-05 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Kenya", "country": "Kenya"}, {"location": "Kihingo", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Nyandarua", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "South Africa", "country": "South Africa"}, {"location": "Tana River", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Nairobi", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Uganda", "country": "Uganda"}, {"location": "Baringo", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Rwanda", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Marsabit", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "WAHID", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Rift Valley", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Isiolo", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Eastern Africa", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Nyandarua County", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Siaya", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "6331808", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Rift Valley fever - Mayotte (03): increase in cases, human, cattle", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=6331808", "date": "2018-09-03 23:43:12", "main_text": "RIFT VALLEY FEVER - EASTERN AFRICA (30): UGANDA\n***********************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Mon 3 Sep 2018\nSource: Uganda Radio Network [edited]\nhttps://ugandaradionetwork.com/story/rift-valley-fever-outbreak-claims-11-in-lyantonde-several-admitted\n\n\nThere is a confirmed outbreak of Rift Valley fever (RVF) in Lyantonde district. The disease has already claimed 11 people and left several others in critical condition in 2 months, according to local authorities.\n\nDr. Moses Nkanika, the Lyantonde District Health Officer-DHO, says there is a possibility that the victims consumed meat from infected cows, sheep and goats. He says 2 other patients died after being referred to Mabarara Regional Hospital. Nine of the deaths have been reported in Kitazigolokwa village, Katovu parish in Lyantonde rural sub-county.\n\nNkanika said that they have received several cases from different sub-counties, and the most complicated are referred to Mbarara Regional hospital. He noted that they are on high alert to the spread of the disease.\n\nDr. Okoth Obo, the Medical Superintendent of Lyantonde Hospital, said they established an isolation center to handle RVF cases, adding that they have received 10 patients in recent weeks.\n\nPatrick Rwozi, the Katovu Parish councilor, says some of the victims died after 2 or 3 days in admission. In Kansagama sub-county, more than 10 people in Mityekula village, Kagaala parish have been admitted in critical condition after consuming meat from an infected cow. Bebwa Abern, the Mityekula village secretary, says one of the residents slaughtered a sick cow and sold meat to fellow residents.\n\nRVF is a viral disease that primarily affects animals but has the capacity to infect humans and can result in death, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).\n\nRonald Bameka, the Lyantonde District Veterinary Officer, says over 15 cows and 22 goats have died since the outbreak. He says that over 200 animals are at high risk, which may lead to a huge loss to livestock dealers in Lyantonde.\n\nHe warns that meat from infected animals is being sneaked into the market posing a high risk to the consumers, adding that they have so far arrested 3 people for slaughtering sick cows and selling meat to unsuspecting residents.\n\nAccording to Bameka, he wrote to the ministry of Agriculture Animal Industry and Fisheries and the ministry of health seeking their intervention, but neither has responded.\n\nIn order to contain the spread of the fever, Fred Muhangi, the Lyantonde LCV Chairperson, says the district has already paid for radio programs to sensitize the public about the outbreak.\n\nHe says that they have also stepped up their operations against the sale of uninspected meat as well as unauthorized animal movement in the district. The RVF outbreak comes at a time when the district is still under a foot-and-mouth-disease quarantine, which has hindered the livestock business.\n\nThe Health Ministry Permanent Secretary, Dr. Diana Atwine, says different teams of experts have already been dispatched to Lyantonde, Mbarara, Isingiro and Kiruhura where the outbreak was announced.\n\nThe teams will educated people about the outbreak and the danger of eating meat from infected cows.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Previous reports from Uganda placed the blame for occurrence of Rift Valley fever (RVF) on incoming refugees.

A quarantine on cattle in the country's 4 affected eastern districts has been imposed since mid-June [2018] after about 100 heads of cattle were killed by the virus.\n\nIn a notice issued [Mon 30 Jul 2018], the minister Ministry of Agriculture and Animal Resources, G\u00e9rardine Mukeshimana, said the quarantine is no longer serving the purpose of slowing the spread of the deadly Rift Valley fever.\n\nReports indicate that the outbreak was first detected on 18 May 2018 in 4 districts in Eastern Rwanda including Ngoma, Kirehe, Rwamagana, and Kayonza.\n\nOf the 147 604 cows in the affected districts, the ministry says 99 died while 452 aborted.\n\nThe ministry says it has treated 1638 cows, with 36 930 sheep and 245 goats vaccinated against the disease.\n\nTo combat further deaths among animals, the ministry says it has dispatched veterinary doctors across the affected districts.\n\nOfficial reports indicate that no human case has been reported so far in Rwanda, yet the number of affected livestock is thought to be much higher.\n\nAccording to the Director General of Rwanda Agriculture Board (RAB), Dr Patrick Karangwa, the cause of the outbreak is unusually heavy rains, which have created ponds and lakes where mosquitoes can breed, in this region which is normally dry.\n\n\"Most human infections result from contact with the blood or organs of infected animals\", Dr Karangwa said.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[RVF, expressed mainly by cattle death and abortions, became active in Rwanda in April 2018, in the districts of Ngoma, Kirehe and Kayonza, in the southwest of the Eastern Province. Later, Kamonyi, a southern province was added.\n\nAn administrative map of Rwanda and detailed districts maps are available at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Districts_of_Rwanda#Eastern_Province.\n\nIn the absence of data on the number of susceptible animals on the affected holdings, the mortality rate in cattle is not known. Based on accumulated field observations and experimental RVF infection trials, the mortality in adult cattle would, generally, not exceed 10 percent. No human cases have been reported in Rwanda during the recent event.\n\nThe tests upon which RVF, an OIE-listed disease, has been confirmed and statistics pertaining to the number, locations, morbidity, and mortality rates in Rwanda's animal population, are expected to be included in an official report to the OIE, as anticipated from all OIE member countries. -

A quarantine on cattle in the country's 4 affected eastern districts has been imposed since mid-June [2018] after about 100 heads of cattle were killed by the virus.\n\nIn a notice issued [Mon 30 Jul 2018], the minister Ministry of Agriculture and Animal Resources, G\u00e9rardine Mukeshimana, said the quarantine is no longer serving the purpose of slowing the spread of the deadly Rift Valley fever.\n\nReports indicate that the outbreak was first detected on 18 May 2018 in 4 districts in Eastern Rwanda including Ngoma, Kirehe, Rwamagana, and Kayonza.\n\nOf the 147 604 cows in the affected districts, the ministry says 99 died while 452 aborted.\n\nThe ministry says it has treated 1638 cows, with 36 930 sheep and 245 goats vaccinated against the disease.\n\nTo combat further deaths among animals, the ministry says it has dispatched veterinary doctors across the affected districts.\n\nOfficial reports indicate that no human case has been reported so far in Rwanda, yet the number of affected livestock is thought to be much higher.\n\nAccording to the Director General of Rwanda Agriculture Board (RAB), Dr Patrick Karangwa, the cause of the outbreak is unusually heavy rains, which have created ponds and lakes where mosquitoes can breed, in this region which is normally dry.\n\n\"Most human infections result from contact with the blood or organs of infected animals\", Dr Karangwa said.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[RVF, expressed mainly by cattle death and abortions, became active in Rwanda in April 2018, in the districts of Ngoma, Kirehe and Kayonza, in the southwest of the Eastern Province.

Based on accumulated field observations and experimental RVF infection trials, the mortality in adult cattle would, generally, not exceed 10 percent. No human cases have been reported in Rwanda during the recent event.\n\nThe tests upon which RVF, an OIE-listed disease, has been confirmed and statistics pertaining to the number, locations, morbidity, and mortality rates in Rwanda's animal population, are expected to be included in an official report to the OIE, as anticipated from all OIE member countries. -

A quarantine on cattle in the country's 4 affected eastern districts has been imposed since mid-June [2018] after about 100 heads of cattle were killed by the virus.\n\nIn a notice issued [Mon 30 Jul 2018], the minister Ministry of Agriculture and Animal Resources, G\u00e9rardine Mukeshimana, said the quarantine is no longer serving the purpose of slowing the spread of the deadly Rift Valley fever.\n\nReports indicate that the outbreak was first detected on 18 May 2018 in 4 districts in Eastern Rwanda including Ngoma, Kirehe, Rwamagana, and Kayonza.\n\nOf the 147 604 cows in the affected districts, the ministry says 99 died while 452 aborted.\n\nThe ministry says it has treated 1638 cows, with 36 930 sheep and 245 goats vaccinated against the disease.\n\nTo combat further deaths among animals, the ministry says it has dispatched veterinary doctors across the affected districts.\n\nOfficial reports indicate that no human case has been reported so far in Rwanda, yet the number of affected livestock is thought to be much higher.\n\nAccording to the Director General of Rwanda Agriculture Board (RAB), Dr Patrick Karangwa, the cause of the outbreak is unusually heavy rains, which have created ponds and lakes where mosquitoes can breed, in this region which is normally dry.\n\n\"Most human infections result from contact with the blood or organs of infected animals\", Dr Karangwa said.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[RVF, expressed mainly by cattle death and abortions, became active in Rwanda in April 2018, in the districts of Ngoma, Kirehe and Kayonza, in the southwest of the Eastern Province. Later, Kamonyi, a southern province was added.\n\nAn administrative map of Rwanda and detailed districts maps are available at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Districts_of_Rwanda#Eastern_Province.\n\nIn the absence of data on the number of susceptible animals on the affected holdings, the mortality rate in cattle is not known. Based on accumulated field observations and experimental RVF infection trials, the mortality in adult cattle would, generally, not exceed 10 percent. No human cases have been reported in Rwanda during the recent event.\n\nThe tests upon which RVF, an OIE-listed disease, has been confirmed and statistics pertaining to the number, locations, morbidity, and mortality rates in Rwanda's animal population, are expected to be included in an official report to the OIE, as anticipated from all OIE member countries. -

A quarantine on cattle in the country's 4 affected eastern districts has been imposed since mid-June [2018] after about 100 heads of cattle were killed by the virus.\n\nIn a notice issued [Mon 30 Jul 2018], the minister Ministry of Agriculture and Animal Resources, G\u00e9rardine Mukeshimana, said the quarantine is no longer serving the purpose of slowing the spread of the deadly Rift Valley fever.\n\nReports indicate that the outbreak was first detected on 18 May 2018 in 4 districts in Eastern Rwanda including Ngoma, Kirehe, Rwamagana, and Kayonza.\n\nOf the 147 604 cows in the affected districts, the ministry says 99 died while 452 aborted.\n\nThe ministry says it has treated 1638 cows, with 36 930 sheep and 245 goats vaccinated against the disease.\n\nTo combat further deaths among animals, the ministry says it has dispatched veterinary doctors across the affected districts.\n\nOfficial reports indicate that no human case has been reported so far in Rwanda, yet the number of affected livestock is thought to be much higher.\n\nAccording to the Director General of Rwanda Agriculture Board (RAB), Dr Patrick Karangwa, the cause of the outbreak is unusually heavy rains, which have created ponds and lakes where mosquitoes can breed, in this region which is normally dry.\n\n\"Most human infections result from contact with the blood or organs of infected animals\", Dr Karangwa said.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[RVF, expressed mainly by cattle death and abortions, became active in Rwanda in April 2018, in the districts of Ngoma, Kirehe and Kayonza, in the southwest of the Eastern Province. Later, Kamonyi, a southern province was added.\n\nAn administrative map of Rwanda and detailed districts maps are available at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Districts_of_Rwanda#Eastern_Province.\n\nIn the absence of data on the number of susceptible animals on the affected holdings, the mortality rate in cattle is not known. Based on accumulated field observations and experimental RVF infection trials, the mortality in adult cattle would, generally, not exceed 10 percent. No human cases have been reported in Rwanda during the recent event.\n\nThe tests upon which RVF, an OIE-listed disease, has been confirmed and statistics pertaining to the number, locations, morbidity, and mortality rates in Rwanda's animal population, are expected to be included in an official report to the OIE, as anticipated from all OIE member countries. -

Peste dets Petits Ruminants PPR - a highly contagious disease affecting small ruminants tested positive in Ilodokilani ward, Kajiado West constituency,\" Achola said.\n\nAlready, the County government of Kajiado has acquired 60 000 doses of RVF vaccine from the Regional Pastoral Livelihood Resilience Project (RPLRP) and 200 000 doses of PPR (Peste dets Petits Ruminants) vaccine from Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) for use in the County.\n\nThe County government has also issued a quarantine notice, covering, Entonet/Lenkisim and Matapato South wards in Kajiado West and Central Sub-counties, to restrict the movement of livestock and its product from the affected areas.\n\nThe veterinary department has enhanced livestock disease surveillance, both in affected and the neighboring areas, as well as conducting public health education with all field and abattoir staff, to be more vigilant and enhance surveillance in their areas of jurisdiction.\n\n[Byline: Rop Janet/Albert Lemomo]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[2] FAO - Eastern Africa, alert message\nDate: Fri 29 Jun 2018\nSource: FAO Animal Production & Health Division: RVF Alert for Eastern African Countries [edited]\n\n\nAfter a period of abnormal, heavy rainfall and floods in the Eastern African region, an outbreak of Rift Valley fever (RVF) was 1st reported in humans in Kenya; later it was confirmed that the disease was present in animals. These outbreaks are ongoing and pose a threat to the whole Eastern African region. Although, the upcoming season from July onwards will be unsuitable for the vector populations in most of the Eastern African region (except for Ethiopia, South Sudan, and southern Sudan), the potential spread of the disease through animal movements and informal trade routes within and outside of Kenya is likely to occur. Therefore, FAO advises the veterinary services and livestock farmers' communities in the region to remain vigilant to the potential occurrence and spread of RVF in humans and/or animals. In particular, the risk of RVF spread is considered to be very high in Kenya and moderate in Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Rwanda, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Uganda, and United Republic of Tanzania. In addition, given the current and predicted average precipitation forecasts for the period June-September 2018, southern Sudan and western Ethiopia may be also characterized by suitable environmental conditions for RVF vector amplification.\n\nThe outbreak in Kenya is not the 1st RVF re-emergence in the region: during the past 7 months, RVF infections have been reported in Uganda (November 2017) and South Sudan (December 2017). Informal cross-border movement of livestock, conflicts, and lack of veterinary services can facilitate the spread of RVF within the affected countries in East Africa.\n\n[A Map, included in the alert message, presented (a) Predicted RVF risk areas for May 2018, and (b) predicted precipitation anomalies for the period July-September 2018].\n\nIn order to prevent and mitigate any occurrence of RVF in the region,\nFAO ADVISES COUNTRIES AT RISK TO:\na) Increase awareness of RVF clinical signs among farmers and workers in abattoirs and animal markets through newspapers, radio, mobile phones or other means of communication.\nb) Include aspects of occupational and exposure hazards (butchers, slaughter plant personnel, veterinarians and assistants) in communication campaigns and public awareness;\nc) Strengthen disease surveillance: active surveillance through serological surveillance of sentinel herds and syndrome surveillance for animals in at-risk areas (especially unusual abortion storms at any stage of pregnancy among small ruminants, camels and cattle). This should include surveillance in markets or places where large numbers are traded or congregate;\nd) Advocate the immediate notification of any RVF outbreak to the OIE through the World Animal Health Information System.\ne) Best practices for risk reduction:\n- Gloves and other appropriate protective clothing should be worn when handling sick animals or their tissues, or when slaughtering animals;\n- Fresh blood, raw milk or animal tissue should be thoroughly cooked before consumption;\n- Protecting against the risk of mosquito bites by using impregnated mosquito nets, personal insect repellent if available, light colored clothing (long-sleeved shirts and trousers), and by avoiding outdoor activity at peak biting times of the vector species.\nf) Promote targeted vaccination by trained personnel of susceptible animals in known at-risk areas\n- The use of vaccination as a control option for RVF is aimed at limiting virus circulation in enzootic areas and preventing epidemics in disease free areas and is most effective when used in conjunction with other control strategies, including surveillance, quarantine and movement controls;\n- Mass vaccination is one of the tools for preventing RVF epidemics in animals. However, vaccination is not recommended in the event of known or ongoing RVF virus circulation, as inappropriate vaccination can exacerbate the spread of virus transmission.\n\nNote that the FAO remains available to provide support for RVF preparedness/readiness for countries at risk and emergency response for countries facing outbreaks with the aim of protecting public and animal health, saving livelihoods and maintaining food security.\n\nIMPORTANT LINKS\n1.

These outbreaks are ongoing and pose a threat to the whole Eastern African region. Although, the upcoming season from July onwards will be unsuitable for the vector populations in most of the Eastern African region (except for Ethiopia, South Sudan, and southern Sudan), the potential spread of the disease through animal movements and informal trade routes within and outside of Kenya is likely to occur. Therefore, FAO advises the veterinary services and livestock farmers' communities in the region to remain vigilant to the potential occurrence and spread of RVF in humans and/or animals. In particular, the risk of RVF spread is considered to be very high in Kenya and moderate in Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Rwanda, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Uganda, and United Republic of Tanzania. In addition, given the current and predicted average precipitation forecasts for the period June-September 2018, southern Sudan and western Ethiopia may be also characterized by suitable environmental conditions for RVF vector amplification.\n\nThe outbreak in Kenya is not the 1st RVF re-emergence in the region: during the past 7 months, RVF infections have been reported in Uganda (November 2017) and South Sudan (December 2017). Informal cross-border movement of livestock, conflicts, and lack of veterinary services can facilitate the spread of RVF within the affected countries in East Africa.\n\n[A Map, included in the alert message, presented (a) Predicted RVF risk areas for May 2018, and (b) predicted precipitation anomalies for the period July-September 2018].\n\nIn order to prevent and mitigate any occurrence of RVF in the region,\nFAO ADVISES COUNTRIES AT RISK TO:\na) Increase awareness of RVF clinical signs among farmers and workers in abattoirs and animal markets through newspapers, radio, mobile phones or other means of communication.\nb) Include aspects of occupational and exposure hazards (butchers, slaughter plant personnel, veterinarians and assistants) in communication campaigns and public awareness;\nc) Strengthen disease surveillance: active surveillance through serological surveillance of sentinel herds and syndrome surveillance for animals in at-risk areas (especially unusual abortion storms at any stage of pregnancy among small ruminants, camels and cattle). This should include surveillance in markets or places where large numbers are traded or congregate;\nd) Advocate the immediate notification of any RVF outbreak to the OIE through the World Animal Health Information System.\ne) Best practices for risk reduction:\n- Gloves and other appropriate protective clothing should be worn when handling sick animals or their tissues, or when slaughtering animals;\n- Fresh blood, raw milk or animal tissue should be thoroughly cooked before consumption;\n- Protecting against the risk of mosquito bites by using impregnated mosquito nets, personal insect repellent if available, light colored clothing (long-sleeved shirts and trousers), and by avoiding outdoor activity at peak biting times of the vector species.\nf) Promote targeted vaccination by trained personnel of susceptible animals in known at-risk areas\n- The use of vaccination as a control option for RVF is aimed at limiting virus circulation in enzootic areas and preventing epidemics in disease free areas and is most effective when used in conjunction with other control strategies, including surveillance, quarantine and movement controls;\n- Mass vaccination is one of the tools for preventing RVF epidemics in animals. However, vaccination is not recommended in the event of known or ongoing RVF virus circulation, as inappropriate vaccination can exacerbate the spread of virus transmission.\n\nNote that the FAO remains available to provide support for RVF preparedness/readiness for countries at risk and emergency response for countries facing outbreaks with the aim of protecting public and animal health, saving livelihoods and maintaining food security.\n\nIMPORTANT LINKS\n1.

These outbreaks are ongoing and pose a threat to the whole Eastern African region. Although, the upcoming season from July onwards will be unsuitable for the vector populations in most of the Eastern African region (except for Ethiopia, South Sudan, and southern Sudan), the potential spread of the disease through animal movements and informal trade routes within and outside of Kenya is likely to occur. Therefore, FAO advises the veterinary services and livestock farmers' communities in the region to remain vigilant to the potential occurrence and spread of RVF in humans and/or animals. In particular, the risk of RVF spread is considered to be very high in Kenya and moderate in Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Rwanda, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Uganda, and United Republic of Tanzania. In addition, given the current and predicted average precipitation forecasts for the period June-September 2018, southern Sudan and western Ethiopia may be also characterized by suitable environmental conditions for RVF vector amplification.\n\nThe outbreak in Kenya is not the 1st RVF re-emergence in the region: during the past 7 months, RVF infections have been reported in Uganda (November 2017) and South Sudan (December 2017). Informal cross-border movement of livestock, conflicts, and lack of veterinary services can facilitate the spread of RVF within the affected countries in East Africa.\n\n[A Map, included in the alert message, presented (a) Predicted RVF risk areas for May 2018, and (b) predicted precipitation anomalies for the period July-September 2018].\n\nIn order to prevent and mitigate any occurrence of RVF in the region,\nFAO ADVISES COUNTRIES AT RISK TO:\na) Increase awareness of RVF clinical signs among farmers and workers in abattoirs and animal markets through newspapers, radio, mobile phones or other means of communication.\nb) Include aspects of occupational and exposure hazards (butchers, slaughter plant personnel, veterinarians and assistants) in communication campaigns and public awareness;\nc) Strengthen disease surveillance: active surveillance through serological surveillance of sentinel herds and syndrome surveillance for animals in at-risk areas (especially unusual abortion storms at any stage of pregnancy among small ruminants, camels and cattle). This should include surveillance in markets or places where large numbers are traded or congregate;\nd) Advocate the immediate notification of any RVF outbreak to the OIE through the World Animal Health Information System.\ne) Best practices for risk reduction:\n- Gloves and other appropriate protective clothing should be worn when handling sick animals or their tissues, or when slaughtering animals;\n- Fresh blood, raw milk or animal tissue should be thoroughly cooked before consumption;\n- Protecting against the risk of mosquito bites by using impregnated mosquito nets, personal insect repellent if available, light colored clothing (long-sleeved shirts and trousers), and by avoiding outdoor activity at peak biting times of the vector species.\nf) Promote targeted vaccination by trained personnel of susceptible animals in known at-risk areas\n- The use of vaccination as a control option for RVF is aimed at limiting virus circulation in enzootic areas and preventing epidemics in disease free areas and is most effective when used in conjunction with other control strategies, including surveillance, quarantine and movement controls;\n- Mass vaccination is one of the tools for preventing RVF epidemics in animals.

Eastern Africa, alert message\nDate: Fri 29 Jun 2018\nSource: FAO Animal Production & Health Division: RVF Alert for Eastern African Countries [edited]\n\n\nAfter a period of abnormal, heavy rainfall and floods in the Eastern African region, an outbreak of Rift Valley fever (RVF) was 1st reported in humans in Kenya; later it was confirmed that the disease was present in animals. These outbreaks are ongoing and pose a threat to the whole Eastern African region. Although, the upcoming season from July onwards will be unsuitable for the vector populations in most of the Eastern African region (except for Ethiopia, South Sudan, and southern Sudan), the potential spread of the disease through animal movements and informal trade routes within and outside of Kenya is likely to occur. Therefore, FAO advises the veterinary services and livestock farmers' communities in the region to remain vigilant to the potential occurrence and spread of RVF in humans and/or animals. In particular, the risk of RVF spread is considered to be very high in Kenya and moderate in Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Rwanda, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Uganda, and United Republic of Tanzania. In addition, given the current and predicted average precipitation forecasts for the period June-September 2018, southern Sudan and western Ethiopia may be also characterized by suitable environmental conditions for RVF vector amplification.\n\nThe outbreak in Kenya is not the 1st RVF re-emergence in the region: during the past 7 months, RVF infections have been reported in Uganda (November 2017) and South Sudan (December 2017). Informal cross-border movement of livestock, conflicts, and lack of veterinary services can facilitate the spread of RVF within the affected countries in East Africa.\n\n[A Map, included in the alert message, presented (a) Predicted RVF risk areas for May 2018, and (b) predicted precipitation anomalies for the period July-September 2018].\n\nIn order to prevent and mitigate any occurrence of RVF in the region,\nFAO ADVISES COUNTRIES AT RISK TO:\na) Increase awareness of RVF clinical signs among farmers and workers in abattoirs and animal markets through newspapers, radio, mobile phones or other means of communication.\nb) Include aspects of occupational and exposure hazards (butchers, slaughter plant personnel, veterinarians and assistants) in communication campaigns and public awareness;\nc) Strengthen disease surveillance: active surveillance through serological surveillance of sentinel herds and syndrome surveillance for animals in at-risk areas (especially unusual abortion storms at any stage of pregnancy among small ruminants, camels and cattle). This should include surveillance in markets or places where large numbers are traded or congregate;\nd) Advocate the immediate notification of any RVF outbreak to the OIE through the World Animal Health Information System.\ne) Best practices for risk reduction:\n- Gloves and other appropriate protective clothing should be worn when handling sick animals or their tissues, or when slaughtering animals;\n- Fresh blood, raw milk or animal tissue should be thoroughly cooked before consumption;\n- Protecting against the risk of mosquito bites by using impregnated mosquito nets, personal insect repellent if available, light colored clothing (long-sleeved shirts and trousers), and by avoiding outdoor activity at peak biting times of the vector species.\nf) Promote targeted vaccination by trained personnel of susceptible animals in known at-risk areas\n- The use of vaccination as a control option for RVF is aimed at limiting virus circulation in enzootic areas and preventing epidemics in disease free areas and is most effective when used in conjunction with other control strategies, including surveillance, quarantine and movement controls;\n- Mass vaccination is one of the tools for preventing RVF epidemics in animals. However, vaccination is not recommended in the event of known or ongoing RVF virus circulation, as inappropriate vaccination can exacerbate the spread of virus transmission.\n\nNote that the FAO remains available to provide support for RVF preparedness/readiness for countries at risk and emergency response for countries facing outbreaks with the aim of protecting public and animal health, saving livelihoods and maintaining food security.\n\nIMPORTANT LINKS\n1.

Eastern Africa, alert message\nDate: Fri 29 Jun 2018\nSource: FAO Animal Production & Health Division: RVF Alert for Eastern African Countries [edited]\n\n\nAfter a period of abnormal, heavy rainfall and floods in the Eastern African region, an outbreak of Rift Valley fever (RVF) was 1st reported in humans in Kenya; later it was confirmed that the disease was present in animals. These outbreaks are ongoing and pose a threat to the whole Eastern African region. Although, the upcoming season from July onwards will be unsuitable for the vector populations in most of the Eastern African region (except for Ethiopia, South Sudan, and southern Sudan), the potential spread of the disease through animal movements and informal trade routes within and outside of Kenya is likely to occur. Therefore, FAO advises the veterinary services and livestock farmers' communities in the region to remain vigilant to the potential occurrence and spread of RVF in humans and/or animals. In particular, the risk of RVF spread is considered to be very high in Kenya and moderate in Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Rwanda, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Uganda, and United Republic of Tanzania. In addition, given the current and predicted average precipitation forecasts for the period June-September 2018, southern Sudan and western Ethiopia may be also characterized by suitable environmental conditions for RVF vector amplification.\n\nThe outbreak in Kenya is not the 1st RVF re-emergence in the region: during the past 7 months, RVF infections have been reported in Uganda (November 2017) and South Sudan (December 2017). Informal cross-border movement of livestock, conflicts, and lack of veterinary services can facilitate the spread of RVF within the affected countries in East Africa.\n\n[A Map, included in the alert message, presented (a) Predicted RVF risk areas for May 2018, and (b) predicted precipitation anomalies for the period July-September 2018].\n\nIn order to prevent and mitigate any occurrence of RVF in the region,\nFAO ADVISES COUNTRIES AT RISK TO:\na) Increase awareness of RVF clinical signs among farmers and workers in abattoirs and animal markets through newspapers, radio, mobile phones or other means of communication.\nb) Include aspects of occupational and exposure hazards (butchers, slaughter plant personnel, veterinarians and assistants) in communication campaigns and public awareness;\nc) Strengthen disease surveillance: active surveillance through serological surveillance of sentinel herds and syndrome surveillance for animals in at-risk areas (especially unusual abortion storms at any stage of pregnancy among small ruminants, camels and cattle). This should include surveillance in markets or places where large numbers are traded or congregate;\nd) Advocate the immediate notification of any RVF outbreak to the OIE through the World Animal Health Information System.\ne) Best practices for risk reduction:\n- Gloves and other appropriate protective clothing should be worn when handling sick animals or their tissues, or when slaughtering animals;\n- Fresh blood, raw milk or animal tissue should be thoroughly cooked before consumption;\n- Protecting against the risk of mosquito bites by using impregnated mosquito nets, personal insect repellent if available, light colored clothing (long-sleeved shirts and trousers), and by avoiding outdoor activity at peak biting times of the vector species.\nf) Promote targeted vaccination by trained personnel of susceptible animals in known at-risk areas\n- The use of vaccination as a control option for RVF is aimed at limiting virus circulation in enzootic areas and preventing epidemics in disease free areas and is most effective when used in conjunction with other control strategies, including surveillance, quarantine and movement controls;\n- Mass vaccination is one of the tools for preventing RVF epidemics in animals. However, vaccination is not recommended in the event of known or ongoing RVF virus circulation, as inappropriate vaccination can exacerbate the spread of virus transmission.\n\nNote that the FAO remains available to provide support for RVF preparedness/readiness for countries at risk and emergency response for countries facing outbreaks with the aim of protecting public and animal health, saving livelihoods and maintaining food security.\n\nIMPORTANT LINKS\n1.

Some 24 cases were reported in Wajir and 2 in Marsabit.\n\nSiaya County on Friday [22 Jun 2018] issued an alert after one person died from the mosquito-borne disease, which was confirmed by tests at the Kenya Medical Research Institute (Kemri).\n\n\"Tests for Ebola and Marburg virus were negative,\" Dr Omondi Owino, Siaya's chief officer for Health, said.\n\nThe Health Ministry report says males were the most affected, at 70 percent. The most affected age group is 21-30 years.\n\nBased on enhanced surveillance of Rift Valley fever-like syndromes in humans and livestock, 6 counties have been identified as having the highest risk of an outbreak, including Tharaka-Nithi, Garissa, Tana River, Lamu, Garissa, Kajiado and Baringo.\n\nMombasa and Nairobi are on heightened alert due to the risk of imported human and animal cases.\n\nThe outbreak was 1st reported in Eldas Sub-County, Wajir, with a sample sent to Kemri testing positive for the virus on 7 Jun [2018].\n\nThe report said the outbreak was prevalent in insecurity-prone regions, and this might make it difficult to contain the virus. \"The communities are hard to reach (due to their nomadic lifestyle) and they depend majorly on animal products and have difficulties in accessing alternative diets,\" the report said.\n\nThe ministry has formed a team of experts from government and non-governmental organisations to provide technical guidance to counties.\n\n\"Counties affected have been directed to send blood specimens to Kemri for confirmation while the ban on movement and slaughter of animals from the affected and at-risk counties is put in place,\" Dr Okunga said.\n\nThe ministry has provided 500 000 doses of RVF vaccine [for animals] to high-risk counties based on risk analysis, while indoor residual spraying and animal spraying with pyrethroids is being carried out at the epicentre.\n\nHowever, vector surveillance and control for humans and animals in high-risk counties are yet to start. \"This will start soon. We are going to ensure that the surveillance starts as soon as possible and investigation teams sent out to all high-risk counties to provide technical guidance before the outbreak,\" he said.\n\nRift Valley fever is a disease that mainly affects livestock while people are mainly infected as a result of handling sick animals, either slaughtering them or assisting animals while giving birth. The other mode of transmission from animals, which is relatively low, is by mosquitoes and bites from other insects. The disease causes abortion in animals.\n\nDr Okunga cautioned residents not to directly handle sick animals or slaughter them without consulting veterinary or public health officers.\n\nResidents have also been encouraged to use mosquito [bed] nets.\n\n\"Anyone with a sick animal -- mainly sheep and cows -- must report to the nearest authorities immediately, and cases of abortions or loss of pregnancy in these animals must be reported too,\" he said.\n\n[Byline: Angela Oketch]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The RVF outbreak continues in both humans and animals.

Mosquitoes collected on the affected farm tested negative for RVF virus, suggesting that active transmission had diminished due to decreased mosquito populations.\n\nFarmworkers and residents, who had been involved in the handling of potentially contaminated animal tissues during the sheep outbreak, were interviewed and sampled for RVF testing at NICD. Of 10 persons sampled, 4 individuals were retrospectively confirmed to have been infected with RVF virus; 4 individuals were shown to have probably been infected with RVFV, pending further tests on follow-up blood samples for confirmation; 2 individuals were not infected with RVFV despite handling potentially contaminated tissues. Of these, 6 of the 8 cases reported having experienced mild symptoms (fever, muscle pain, headache) in the preceding month, while none developed a severe disease that necessitated hospitalization. Healthcare workers must be aware of RVF and be vigilant for patients who meet the case definition, and, in such instances, submit specimens to the NICD-NHLS for laboratory testing (Healthcare worker guidelines and Case Investigation Form).\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org\n\n[It is not surprising that there is evidence of RVF virus infection in farm workers, fortunately without severe disease, in the areas where the sheep were infected.

Mosquitoes collected on the affected farm tested negative for RVF virus, suggesting that active transmission had diminished due to decreased mosquito populations.\n\nFarmworkers and residents, who had been involved in the handling of potentially contaminated animal tissues during the sheep outbreak, were interviewed and sampled for RVF testing at NICD. Of 10 persons sampled, 4 individuals were retrospectively confirmed to have been infected with RVF virus; 4 individuals were shown to have probably been infected with RVFV, pending further tests on follow-up blood samples for confirmation; 2 individuals were not infected with RVFV despite handling potentially contaminated tissues. Of these, 6 of the 8 cases reported having experienced mild symptoms (fever, muscle pain, headache) in the preceding month, while none developed a severe disease that necessitated hospitalization.

Mosquitoes collected on the affected farm tested negative for RVF virus, suggesting that active transmission had diminished due to decreased mosquito populations.\n\nFarmworkers and residents, who had been involved in the handling of potentially contaminated animal tissues during the sheep outbreak, were interviewed and sampled for RVF testing at NICD. Of 10 persons sampled, 4 individuals were retrospectively confirmed to have been infected with RVF virus; 4 individuals were shown to have probably been infected with RVFV, pending further tests on follow-up blood samples for confirmation; 2 individuals were not infected with RVFV despite handling potentially contaminated tissues.

The 1st patient was admitted to a hospital in Wajir County in northeastern Kenya on 2 Jun [2018] with fever, body weakness, and bleeding from the gums and mouth. The patient reported having consumed meat from a sick animal; the patient died the same day. On 4 Jun [2018], 2 relatives of the index patient were admitted. Blood samples were collected and sent to the Kenya Medical Research Institute, one of which was confirmed positive for Rift Valley fever on 6 Jun [2018].\n\nAs of 16 Jun [2018], a total of 26 human cases have been reported from Wajir (24 cases) and Marsabit (2 cases) counties, including 7 confirmed cases and 6 deaths (case fatality ratio (CFR) = 23 percent); 6 patients have been discharged, while one is still hospitalized. A high number of deaths and abortions among livestock, including camels and goats, has been reported in Garissa, Kadjiado, Kitui, Marsabit, Tana River, and Wajir counties.

A health sector task force meeting was held, and partners pledged their support to Rift Valley fever control.\n- On 14 Jun [2018], the MoH activated the Emergency Operations Centre, with an Event Manager and supporting technical team.\n- On 14 Jun [2018], a multi-sectoral investigation teams was deployed in Wajir County to support the county health teams.

The majority of human infections result from direct or indirect contact with the blood or organs of infected animals. Herders, farmers, slaughterhouse workers and veterinarians have an increased risk of infection. Awareness of the risk factors of Rift Valley fever infection and measures to prevent mosquito bites are the only ways to reduce human infection and deaths. Public health messages for risk reduction should focus on:\n\n- Reducing the risk of animal-to-human transmission resulting from unsafe animal husbandry and slaughtering practices. Practicing hand hygiene and wearing gloves and other personal protective equipment when handling sick animals or their tissues or when slaughtering animals is recommended.\n- Reducing the risk of animal-to-human transmission arising from the unsafe consumption of raw or unpasteurized milk or animal tissue. In endemic regions, all animal products should be thoroughly cooked before eating.\n- Reducing the risk of mosquito bites through the implementation of vector control activities (e.g. insecticide spraying and using larvicide to reduce mosquito breeding sites), use of insecticide-impregnated mosquito nets and repellents, and wearing light coloured clothing (long-sleeved shirts and trousers).\n- Restricting or banning the movement of livestock to reduce spread of the virus from infected to uninfected areas.\n- Routine animal vaccination is recommended to prevent Rift Valley fever outbreaks. Vaccination campaigns are not recommended during an outbreak as they may intensify transmission among the herd through needle propagation of the virus. Outbreaks of Rift Valley fever in animals precede human cases, thus the establishment of an active animal health surveillance system is essential to providing early warning for veterinary and public health authorities.\n\nWHO advises against the application of any travel or trade restrictions to the Kenya based on the current information available on this event.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The Kenya Ministries of Health and of Agriculture are working together in a One Health effort to reduce risk of Rift Valley fever (RVF) for humans and for animals in this outbreak. These ministries issued an alert for the risk of Rift Valley fever due to heavy rains and flooding and named 15 counties as high-risk areas (see Rift valley fever - Kenya: alert, prevention 20180531.5830703).

Blood samples were collected and sent to the Kenya Medical Research Institute, one of which was confirmed positive for Rift Valley fever on 6 Jun [2018].\n\nAs of 16 Jun [2018], a total of 26 human cases have been reported from Wajir (24 cases) and Marsabit (2 cases) counties, including 7 confirmed cases and 6 deaths (case fatality ratio (CFR) = 23 percent); 6 patients have been discharged, while one is still hospitalized. A high number of deaths and abortions among livestock, including camels and goats, has been reported in Garissa, Kadjiado, Kitui, Marsabit, Tana River, and Wajir counties. People living in these counties were reportedly consuming meat from dead and sick animals.\n\nPreparedness activities for Rift Valley fever have been ongoing since February 2018 in reaction to the heavy rains and flooding in Kenya. An alert was issued to all County Directors in February 2018 and a general national alert was communicated in May 2018.\n\nThe following actions have been taken since the outbreak was confirmed:\n- On 8 Jun [2018], the MoH and Ministry of Agriculture convened an emergency meeting with the Ministry of Livestock (MoL) and key stakeholders. A health sector task force meeting was held, and partners pledged their support to Rift Valley fever control.\n- On 14 Jun [2018], the MoH activated the Emergency Operations Centre, with an Event Manager and supporting technical team.\n- On 14 Jun [2018], a multi-sectoral investigation teams was deployed in Wajir County to support the county health teams. Another team will soon be dispatched to support the Marsabit County team.\n- As part of ongoing preparedness activities, active surveillance for Rift Valley fever is being strengthened in affected and at-risk counties, as well as contact tracing in Wajir and Marsabit counties. In Wajir County, 5 treatment centres have been established.\n- Active case searching and community sensitization activities are ongoing in the affected areas. Guidelines for vector control and other informational materials have been dispatched to Wajir County, and messages are being disseminated through Community Health Volunteers.\n- A ban on slaughtering animals and restriction of livestock movement has been imposed in the affected areas.\n\nOutbreaks of Rift Valley fever are not uncommon in Kenya. The last documented outbreak occurred from November 2014 through January 2015 in northeastern Kenya; in 2006, a large outbreak killed more than 150 people. The CFR has varied widely in documented outbreaks, but the overall CFR tends to be less than one percent.\n\nKenya's prior experience with responding to Rift Valley fever outbreaks combined with the preparedness activities undertaken over the preceding months is of benefit. However, the high number of reported deaths and abortions in livestock is concerning, especially because the event affects nomadic communities for which diet is predominantly based on animal products. The high volume of movement of cattle and people in this area increases the risk of further spread of the outbreak both within Kenya, and to neighbouring countries.\n\nRift Valley fever is a mosquito-borne viral zoonosis that primarily affects animals but also has the capacity to infect humans. The majority of human infections result from direct or indirect contact with the blood or organs of infected animals. Herders, farmers, slaughterhouse workers and veterinarians have an increased risk of infection. Awareness of the risk factors of Rift Valley fever infection and measures to prevent mosquito bites are the only ways to reduce human infection and deaths. Public health messages for risk reduction should focus on:\n\n- Reducing the risk of animal-to-human transmission resulting from unsafe animal husbandry and slaughtering practices. Practicing hand hygiene and wearing gloves and other personal protective equipment when handling sick animals or their tissues or when slaughtering animals is recommended.\n- Reducing the risk of animal-to-human transmission arising from the unsafe consumption of raw or unpasteurized milk or animal tissue. In endemic regions, all animal products should be thoroughly cooked before eating.\n- Reducing the risk of mosquito bites through the implementation of vector control activities (e.g. insecticide spraying and using larvicide to reduce mosquito breeding sites), use of insecticide-impregnated mosquito nets and repellents, and wearing light coloured clothing (long-sleeved shirts and trousers).\n- Restricting or banning the movement of livestock to reduce spread of the virus from infected to uninfected areas.\n- Routine animal vaccination is recommended to prevent Rift Valley fever outbreaks. Vaccination campaigns are not recommended during an outbreak as they may intensify transmission among the herd through needle propagation of the virus. Outbreaks of Rift Valley fever in animals precede human cases, thus the establishment of an active animal health surveillance system is essential to providing early warning for veterinary and public health authorities.\n\nWHO advises against the application of any travel or trade restrictions to the Kenya based on the current information available on this event.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The Kenya Ministries of Health and of Agriculture are working together in a One Health effort to reduce risk of Rift Valley fever (RVF) for humans and for animals in this outbreak. These ministries issued an alert for the risk of Rift Valley fever due to heavy rains and flooding and named 15 counties as high-risk areas (see Rift valley fever - Kenya: alert, prevention 20180531.5830703). The loss of camels and small ruminants has social and economic consequences for their owners.

The 1st patient was admitted to a hospital in Wajir County in northeastern Kenya on 2 Jun [2018] with fever, body weakness, and bleeding from the gums and mouth. The patient reported having consumed meat from a sick animal; the patient died the same day. On 4 Jun [2018], 2 relatives of the index patient were admitted. Blood samples were collected and sent to the Kenya Medical Research Institute, one of which was confirmed positive for Rift Valley fever on 6 Jun [2018].\n\nAs of 16 Jun [2018], a total of 26 human cases have been reported from Wajir (24 cases) and Marsabit (2 cases) counties, including 7 confirmed cases and 6 deaths (case fatality ratio (CFR) = 23 percent); 6 patients have been discharged, while one is still hospitalized. A high number of deaths and abortions among livestock, including camels and goats, has been reported in Garissa, Kadjiado, Kitui, Marsabit, Tana River, and Wajir counties. People living in these counties were reportedly consuming meat from dead and sick animals.\n\nPreparedness activities for Rift Valley fever have been ongoing since February 2018 in reaction to the heavy rains and flooding in Kenya. An alert was issued to all County Directors in February 2018 and a general national alert was communicated in May 2018.\n\nThe following actions have been taken since the outbreak was confirmed:\n- On 8 Jun [2018], the MoH and Ministry of Agriculture convened an emergency meeting with the Ministry of Livestock (MoL) and key stakeholders. A health sector task force meeting was held, and partners pledged their support to Rift Valley fever control.\n- On 14 Jun [2018], the MoH activated the Emergency Operations Centre, with an Event Manager and supporting technical team.\n- On 14 Jun [2018], a multi-sectoral investigation teams was deployed in Wajir County to support the county health teams. Another team will soon be dispatched to support the Marsabit County team.\n- As part of ongoing preparedness activities, active surveillance for Rift Valley fever is being strengthened in affected and at-risk counties, as well as contact tracing in Wajir and Marsabit counties. In Wajir County, 5 treatment centres have been established.\n- Active case searching and community sensitization activities are ongoing in the affected areas. Guidelines for vector control and other informational materials have been dispatched to Wajir County, and messages are being disseminated through Community Health Volunteers.\n- A ban on slaughtering animals and restriction of livestock movement has been imposed in the affected areas.\n\nOutbreaks of Rift Valley fever are not uncommon in Kenya. The last documented outbreak occurred from November 2014 through January 2015 in northeastern Kenya; in 2006, a large outbreak killed more than 150 people. The CFR has varied widely in documented outbreaks, but the overall CFR tends to be less than one percent.\n\nKenya's prior experience with responding to Rift Valley fever outbreaks combined with the preparedness activities undertaken over the preceding months is of benefit. However, the high number of reported deaths and abortions in livestock is concerning, especially because the event affects nomadic communities for which diet is predominantly based on animal products. The high volume of movement of cattle and people in this area increases the risk of further spread of the outbreak both within Kenya, and to neighbouring countries.\n\nRift Valley fever is a mosquito-borne viral zoonosis that primarily affects animals but also has the capacity to infect humans. The majority of human infections result from direct or indirect contact with the blood or organs of infected animals. Herders, farmers, slaughterhouse workers and veterinarians have an increased risk of infection. Awareness of the risk factors of Rift Valley fever infection and measures to prevent mosquito bites are the only ways to reduce human infection and deaths. Public health messages for risk reduction should focus on:\n\n- Reducing the risk of animal-to-human transmission resulting from unsafe animal husbandry and slaughtering practices. Practicing hand hygiene and wearing gloves and other personal protective equipment when handling sick animals or their tissues or when slaughtering animals is recommended.\n- Reducing the risk of animal-to-human transmission arising from the unsafe consumption of raw or unpasteurized milk or animal tissue. In endemic regions, all animal products should be thoroughly cooked before eating.\n- Reducing the risk of mosquito bites through the implementation of vector control activities (e.g. insecticide spraying and using larvicide to reduce mosquito breeding sites), use of insecticide-impregnated mosquito nets and repellents, and wearing light coloured clothing (long-sleeved shirts and trousers).\n- Restricting or banning the movement of livestock to reduce spread of the virus from infected to uninfected areas.\n- Routine animal vaccination is recommended to prevent Rift Valley fever outbreaks. Vaccination campaigns are not recommended during an outbreak as they may intensify transmission among the herd through needle propagation of the virus. Outbreaks of Rift Valley fever in animals precede human cases, thus the establishment of an active animal health surveillance system is essential to providing early warning for veterinary and public health authorities.\n\nWHO advises against the application of any travel or trade restrictions to the Kenya based on the current information available on this event.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The Kenya Ministries of Health and of Agriculture are working together in a One Health effort to reduce risk of Rift Valley fever (RVF) for humans and for animals in this outbreak. These ministries issued an alert for the risk of Rift Valley fever due to heavy rains and flooding and named 15 counties as high-risk areas (see Rift valley fever - Kenya: alert, prevention 20180531.5830703). The loss of camels and small ruminants has social and economic consequences for their owners. Where access to banks is limited, these animals become a store of value as well as a critical source of family income and food. It is difficult to predict how long the outbreak may last.\n\nThe rains and flooding have doubtless increased the populations of RVF virus mosquito vectors in the area. A vigorous vaccination campaign should reduce risk of infection for the animal populations. There is no commercially available vaccine for humans, so public education is the best way to influence behavior in ways to reduce risk of acquiring an infection. - Mod.TY\n\nKenya submitted its 1st follow-up report addressing RVF on 15 Jun 2018, adding the county Tana River to Wajir, where the initial RVF animal cases were identified in livestock (camels). The report, with map, is available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=26928.\n\nAccording to the WHO Relief Web report of 18 Jun 2018, the number of counties in Kenya's Eastern province, where RVF is currently affecting animals, has risen to 6, adding Garissa, Kadjiado, Kitui, and Marsabit to the list.

So far, it is the only farm reported to be affected and further investigations are being carried out by the local veterinary services.\n\nRift Valley fever is caused by a virus carried by mosquitoes. It affects cattle, sheep, and goats and causes abortions and deaths in especially young animals. Humans can be infected with Rift Valley fever if they come into contact with the blood and other body fluids of an infected animal or an aborted foetus. Care should be taken when handling possibly infected animals or carcasses of animals that have died of the disease. Symptoms in humans are flu-like and some individuals can develop more serious complications. If a person suspects that they might have been infected with Rift Valley fever, they must consult a doctor.\n\nThe reoccurrence of Rift Valley fever is due to increased rainfall, which in turn causes an increase in mosquitoes. As this outbreak occurred in the beginning of the winter season, it will probably be an isolated incident as the cold weather will result in a decrease in the number of mosquitoes and therefore decrease the risk the disease spreading. It must be noted that the risk will increase at the start of the summer season. This outbreak provides us with a useful warning that all cattle, sheep, and goats have to be vaccinated to ensure that the level of immunity in the herds is high when the next summer season starts and the risk increases.\n\nFarmers are therefore advised to vaccinate their animals against Rift Valley fever. Live vaccines can only be used in non-pregnant animals as the live vaccine can cause abortions. Only dead (inactivated) vaccines must be used in pregnant animals. Please take care when vaccines are administered after outbreaks have been detected; use a clean needle for each animal as the virus can be spread between animals if the animals are in the incubation period.

So far, it is the only farm reported to be affected and further investigations are being carried out by the local veterinary services.\n\nRift Valley fever is caused by a virus carried by mosquitoes. It affects cattle, sheep, and goats and causes abortions and deaths in especially young animals. Humans can be infected with Rift Valley fever if they come into contact with the blood and other body fluids of an infected animal or an aborted foetus. Care should be taken when handling possibly infected animals or carcasses of animals that have died of the disease. Symptoms in humans are flu-like and some individuals can develop more serious complications. If a person suspects that they might have been infected with Rift Valley fever, they must consult a doctor.\n\nThe reoccurrence of Rift Valley fever is due to increased rainfall, which in turn causes an increase in mosquitoes. As this outbreak occurred in the beginning of the winter season, it will probably be an isolated incident as the cold weather will result in a decrease in the number of mosquitoes and therefore decrease the risk the disease spreading. It must be noted that the risk will increase at the start of the summer season. This outbreak provides us with a useful warning that all cattle, sheep, and goats have to be vaccinated to ensure that the level of immunity in the herds is high when the next summer season starts and the risk increases.\n\nFarmers are therefore advised to vaccinate their animals against Rift Valley fever. Live vaccines can only be used in non-pregnant animals as the live vaccine can cause abortions. Only dead (inactivated) vaccines must be used in pregnant animals. Please take care when vaccines are administered after outbreaks have been detected; use a clean needle for each animal as the virus can be spread between animals if the animals are in the incubation period. Animals in the incubation period will have a virus infection but will not show symptoms of the disease yet.\n\nRift Valley fever is a notifiable animal disease, but not a controlled animal disease, meaning that there are no prescribed control measures.

So far, it is the only farm reported to be affected and further investigations are being carried out by the local veterinary services.\n\nRift Valley fever is caused by a virus carried by mosquitoes. It affects cattle, sheep, and goats and causes abortions and deaths in especially young animals. Humans can be infected with Rift Valley fever if they come into contact with the blood and other body fluids of an infected animal or an aborted foetus. Care should be taken when handling possibly infected animals or carcasses of animals that have died of the disease. Symptoms in humans are flu-like and some individuals can develop more serious complications. If a person suspects that they might have been infected with Rift Valley fever, they must consult a doctor.\n\nThe reoccurrence of Rift Valley fever is due to increased rainfall, which in turn causes an increase in mosquitoes. As this outbreak occurred in the beginning of the winter season, it will probably be an isolated incident as the cold weather will result in a decrease in the number of mosquitoes and therefore decrease the risk the disease spreading. It must be noted that the risk will increase at the start of the summer season. This outbreak provides us with a useful warning that all cattle, sheep, and goats have to be vaccinated to ensure that the level of immunity in the herds is high when the next summer season starts and the risk increases.\n\nFarmers are therefore advised to vaccinate their animals against Rift Valley fever. Live vaccines can only be used in non-pregnant animals as the live vaccine can cause abortions. Only dead (inactivated) vaccines must be used in pregnant animals. Please take care when vaccines are administered after outbreaks have been detected; use a clean needle for each animal as the virus can be spread between animals if the animals are in the incubation period. Animals in the incubation period will have a virus infection but will not show symptoms of the disease yet.\n\nRift Valley fever is a notifiable animal disease, but not a controlled animal disease, meaning that there are no prescribed control measures.

So far, it is the only farm reported to be affected and further investigations are being carried out by the local veterinary services.\n\nRift Valley fever is caused by a virus carried by mosquitoes. It affects cattle, sheep, and goats and causes abortions and deaths in especially young animals. Humans can be infected with Rift Valley fever if they come into contact with the blood and other body fluids of an infected animal or an aborted foetus. Care should be taken when handling possibly infected animals or carcasses of animals that have died of the disease. Symptoms in humans are flu-like and some individuals can develop more serious complications. If a person suspects that they might have been infected with Rift Valley fever, they must consult a doctor.\n\nThe reoccurrence of Rift Valley fever is due to increased rainfall, which in turn causes an increase in mosquitoes. As this outbreak occurred in the beginning of the winter season, it will probably be an isolated incident as the cold weather will result in a decrease in the number of mosquitoes and therefore decrease the risk the disease spreading. It must be noted that the risk will increase at the start of the summer season. This outbreak provides us with a useful warning that all cattle, sheep, and goats have to be vaccinated to ensure that the level of immunity in the herds is high when the next summer season starts and the risk increases.\n\nFarmers are therefore advised to vaccinate their animals against Rift Valley fever. Live vaccines can only be used in non-pregnant animals as the live vaccine can cause abortions. Only dead (inactivated) vaccines must be used in pregnant animals. Please take care when vaccines are administered after outbreaks have been detected; use a clean needle for each animal as the virus can be spread between animals if the animals are in the incubation period. Animals in the incubation period will have a virus infection but will not show symptoms of the disease yet.\n\nRift Valley fever is a notifiable animal disease, but not a controlled animal disease, meaning that there are no prescribed control measures. The State Veterinary Services will give support and information to farmers in affected areas, but it is the responsibility of the animal owners to vaccinate their animals and prevent losses. Suspicion of disease must be immediately reported to the nearest State Veterinarian.\n\nAll livestock farmers in South Africa are advised to vaccinate all their cattle, sheep, and goats yearly or at least once during weaning.\" - Mod.CRD\n\nHealthMap/ProMED-mail map\nLetsemeng, Orange Free State, South Africa: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/53679]\nSee Also\n2017\n----\nRift Valley fever - Nigeria: livestock, serology, OIE 20170727.5209912\nRift Valley fever - Mali (02): (KK) 20170721.5195838\nRift Valley fever - Mauritania: RFI 20170605.5085590\nRift Valley fever - Niger: livestock, human, risk assessment, FAO 20170404.4947846\nRift Valley fever - Mali: (GO) ovine, caprine, OIE 20170128.4799130\n2016\n----\nRift Valley fever - Niger (05): (TH) 20161121.4643103\nRift Valley fever - Niger (04): (TH) 20161014.4560906\nRift Valley fever - Niger (03): (TH) livestock, human 20160929.4525684\nRift Valley fever - Niger (02): (TH), livestock, human, 20160922.4506785\nRift Valley fever - Niger: (TH) livestock, OIE 20160920.4501514\n2011\n----\nRift Valley fever - South Africa (05): ovine, vaccine policy 20110201.0377\nRift Valley fever - South Africa (04): camelidae 20110201.0374\nRift Valley fever - South Africa (03): livestock, OIE, vaccination, 20110129.0350\nRift Valley fever - South Africa (02): ovine, vaccination, RFI 20110125.0304\nRift Valley fever - South Africa: (WC) ovine OIE 20110119.0224\n2010\n----\nRift Valley fever, animal - South Africa (02): control strategy 20100606.1886\n.................................................crd/mj/lxl", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "rift valley fever"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2018-03-16 00:00:00", "2018-05-16 00:00:00", "2018-05-16 00:00:00", "2018-05-16 00:00:00", "2018-05-16 00:00:00", "2011-03-16 00:00:00", "2018-05-16 00:00:00", "2017-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-05 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-05 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2010-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "South Africa", "country": "South Africa"}, {"location": "rvf_2018_001", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "WAHID", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Rift Valley", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Pretoria", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "5735975", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Rift Valley fever - South Sudan (09): (EL) human, animal, WHO", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=5735975", "date": "2018-01-30 23:46:12", "main_text": "RIFT VALLEY FEVER - SOUTH SUDAN (02): (EASTERN LAKES)\n*****************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Mon 29 Jan 2018\nSource: Outbreak News Today [edited]\nhttp://outbreaknewstoday.com/south-sudan-suspected-rift-valley-fever-cases-rise-20-39483/\n\n\nWith the addition of 7 suspected Rift Valley fever (RVF) cases reported from Yirol East County, South Sudan, 20 suspect cases have been reported in the past month.\n\nOf the cases, 3 are confirmed and 3 probable cases who died and had epidemiological links to the confirmed cases.\n\nOn 28 Dec 2017, the Ministry of Health of South Sudan reported a cluster of 3 severe hemorrhagic cases, which were epidemiologically linked by place (all occurred in Thonabutkok village, Yirol East County) and time (all in December 2017).

Goats, sheep, and cattle in the area also showed evidence of zoonotic hemorrhagic illness.\n\nOn 19 Jan 2018, a joint Ministry of Health/WHO rapid response team arrived in Yirol East and have investigated the 2 most recent suspect cases, collected and shipped samples to Uganda Viral Research Institute (UVRI) for testing, and discussed the establishment of a mechanism for case investigation and sample collection with the State Minister of Health and partners. They also trained teams in active case finding and trained 15 local healthcare workers in RVF case management.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Of the 7 human and 7 animal samples, 3 from humans tested serologically positive for Rift Valley fever (RVF), and one animal sample was positive. In that locality, one goat and one sheep aborted, 8 goats died, and one cow was ill (http://who.int/hac/crises/ssd/figures/south-sudan-rvf-21january2017.pdf).\n\nIn an RVF outbreak, abortions and deaths in small ruminant animals are common. People can become infected by handling abortuses, carcasses, or blood of infected animals, or by bite of infected mosquitoes. Animal handlers, butchers and veterinarians are at particular risk of infection by RVF virus.\n\nThere have been undiagnosed cases of hemorrhagic disease in South Sudan several times before.

It is caused by a single serotype of a mosquito-borne virus of the _Bunyaviridae_ family (genus _Phlebovirus_). The disease occurs in climatic conditions favouring the breeding of mosquito vectors and is characterised [in some domestic animals] by abortion, neonatal mortality, and liver damage. The disease is most severe in sheep, goats and cattle. Older, non-pregnant animals, although susceptible to infection, are more resistant to clinical disease. There is considerable variation in the susceptibility to RVF of animals of different species.

RVFV has also caused serious infections in laboratory workers and must be handled with biosafety and biocontainment measures.

This provides a potential mechanism for maintaining the virus in nature, as the eggs of these mosquitoes may survive for periods of up to several years in dry conditions. Once livestock is infected, a wide variety of mosquito species may act as the vector for transmission of RVFV and can spread the disease.\n\n\"Low level RVF activity may take place during inter-epizootic periods. RVF should be suspected when exceptional flooding and subsequent abundant mosquito populations are followed by the occurrence of abortions, together with fatal disease marked by necrosis and haemorrhages in the liver that particularly affect newborn lambs, kids and calves, potentially concurrent with the occurrence of an influenza-like illness in farm workers and people handling raw meat.\n\n\"During an outbreak, preventive measures to protect workers from infection should be employed when there are suspicions that RVFV-infected animals or animal products are to be handled.\n\n\"The above and much more information is available at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.01.18_RVF.pdf.\"\n\nAlthough ProMED-mail has received relatively few reports of RVF in Mali, there have been cases reported this year (2017) in neighboring Mauritania and Niger.\n\nOulessebougou is located 80 km (50 mi) south of Bamako in southwestern Mali.

All 3 samples tested negative for all arboviruses included on the molecular panel, namely: dengue, West Nile, RVF, chikungunya, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, and Ebola. However, one sample was anti-RVF virus IgM positive on serology testing by ELISA.\n\nEarlier this month [July 2017], the district rapid response team was deployed to the affected village to conduct outbreak investigation. The team observed that the affected village is served by a large diameter well, with shepherds in seasonal movement with their livestock living nearby and regularly visiting the village.\n\nScore of samples were taken from villagers and domestic animals. Test results are pending.\n\nThe World Health Organization says the occurrence of a sporadic case of RVF in a village in Mali is not surprising.\n\nDuring August-November 2016, communities in the Tahoua Region, Niger (on the border with Mali) experienced an outbreak of RVF. And in January this year [2017], OIE confirmed RVF virus as the cause of abortions in sheep and goats across the border in Menaka, Mali (some 1700 km [1056 mi] from the abovementioned outbreaks).\n\nNevertheless, the detection of even a single case warrants an immediate emergency response, as such cases are often an early indication of widespread infection in livestock populations, associated with abortions with devastating economic impacts. Though the disease in humans is often subclinical or mild, 8 to 10 percent of cases develop severe symptoms, including ocular disease, encephalitis and/or haemorrhagic fever.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Rift Valley fever (RVF) is endemic in may sub-Saharan countries, including Mali. Cases occur sporadically in livestock and in humans. Mod.AS provided an excellent comment on RVF previously; \"Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a peracute or acute zoonotic disease of domestic ruminants. It is caused by a single serotype of a mosquito-borne virus of the _Bunyaviridae_ family (genus _Phlebovirus_). The disease occurs in climatic conditions favouring the breeding of mosquito vectors and is characterised [in some domestic animals] by abortion, neonatal mortality, and liver damage. The disease is most severe in sheep, goats and cattle. Older, non-pregnant animals, although susceptible to infection, are more resistant to clinical disease. There is considerable variation in the susceptibility to RVF of animals of different species. Camels usually have an inapparent infection with RVF virus (RVFV), but sudden mortality, neonatal mortality, and abortion occur, and abortion rates can be as high as in cattle.\n\n\"Humans are susceptible to RVFV and are infected through contact with infected animal material (body fluids or tissues) or through bites from infected mosquitoes. RVFV has also caused serious infections in laboratory workers and must be handled with biosafety and biocontainment measures. It is recommended that laboratory workers be vaccinated if possible.\n\n\"RVFV is endemic in many African countries and may involve several countries in the region at the same time or progressively expand geographically over the course of a few years. In addition to Africa, large outbreaks have been observed in the Arabian Peninsula and some Indian Ocean Islands. These generally, but not exclusively, follow the periodic cycles of unusually heavy rainfall, which may occur at intervals of several years, or the flooding of wide areas favouring the proliferation of mosquitoes.\n\n\"Rainfall facilitates mosquito eggs to hatch. _Aedes_ mosquitoes acquire the virus from feeding on infected animals and may potentially vertically transmit the virus [transovarily] so that new generations of infected mosquitoes may hatch from their eggs. This provides a potential mechanism for maintaining the virus in nature, as the eggs of these mosquitoes may survive for periods of up to several years in dry conditions. Once livestock is infected, a wide variety of mosquito species may act as the vector for transmission of RVFV and can spread the disease.\n\n\"Low level RVF activity may take place during inter-epizootic periods. RVF should be suspected when exceptional flooding and subsequent abundant mosquito populations are followed by the occurrence of abortions, together with fatal disease marked by necrosis and haemorrhages in the liver that particularly affect newborn lambs, kids and calves, potentially concurrent with the occurrence of an influenza-like illness in farm workers and people handling raw meat.\n\n\"During an outbreak, preventive measures to protect workers from infection should be employed when there are suspicions that RVFV-infected animals or animal products are to be handled.\n\n\"The above and much more information is available at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.01.18_RVF.pdf.\"\n\nAlthough ProMED-mail has received relatively few reports of RVF in Mali, there have been cases reported this year (2017) in neighboring Mauritania and Niger.\n\nOulessebougou is located 80 km (50 mi) south of Bamako in southwestern Mali.

The area is mainly populated by nomadic stockbreeders.\n\nMost of the cases are male (62.5 percent), and work as farmers or animal breeders. In the affected area, an epizootic outbreak is also reported among livestock during the same time duration, including deaths and abortions among cattle and small ruminants.\n\nAs of 16 Sep 2016, 6 of the 13 human specimens tested at Institute Pasteur (IP), Dakar were positive for Rift Valley fever (RVF). Among the 6 animal specimens tested, 3 were positive for RVF. Sequencing and further laboratory testing is ongoing. Genetic sequence data is required to confirm or refute the endogenous origin of the outbreak. Moreover, laboratory support for Niger is being considered.\n\nPublic Health Response\nOn 31 Aug [2016], a multisectoral national rapid response team, including members from the Ministry of Health, veterinary services and Centre de Recherche M\u00e9dicale et Sanitaire (CERMES), and World Health Organization, was deployed for field investigation. Ministries of Health and Agriculture/Livestock have developed a national response plan.\n\nThe WHO Country Office continues to provide technical and financial support for surveillance, outbreak investigation, technical guidelines regarding case definition, case management, shipment of samples and risk communication.\n\nFAO, OIE, and WHO are coordinating on animal and human health and providing additional support to Niger for the outbreak response WHO is working with partners in the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) to coordinate international support for the response. IFRC and Unicef are supporting outbreak response.\n\nThe NGO ALIMA and the Nigerian NGO BEFEN are providing support for case management and social mobilisation on the ground.\n\nCurrently, in conjunction with the Ministry of Public Health, an entomological survey is being prepared for urgent implementation with WHO technical and financial support. This is to identify potential vectors for RVF in the region and it is considered to be in the definition of vector control activities.\n\nCurrently, some of the main challenges include under-detection of human cases. The risk that only severe cases are being detected and reported cannot be ruled out. There is no national local capacity to test the specimens. For laboratory confirmation for RVF, the samples are being shipped to WHO regional collaborating centres. Moreover, to ascertain the extent of this outbreak, the involvement of the national livestock department is required.\n\nWHO Risk Assessment\nBased on the available information, the event risk assessment is ongoing. The risk of further spread of outbreak within Niger and internationally (especially to neighbouring countries and those on the transhumance and migration routes) cannot be ruled out.\n\nNomadic stockbreeders from Niger and neighbouring countries have just participated in the Cure Sal\u00e9e festival, a major annual mass gathering event from 23-25 Sep [2016]. During this festival, herds are brought to graze on the salty pastures ahead of the dry season. Around 2 million cattle and even more small ruminants were expected to be part of the event.\n\nAt the end of the rainy season, as per known migration patterns, the nomadic human population along with their herds will progressively move to other Southern Sub Saharan countries and irrigation systems along the Niger river where pastures may still be available. In conjunction with the ongoing outbreak, the high density of animals in the area and the transhumance pattern significantly increases the risk of international spread. The security situation in the Sahel is unstable and also needs to be taken into consideration.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Previous reports of this Rift Valley fever (RVF) outbreak have made the number of human cases uncertain. The above report clarifies the case number and provides valuable social and economic elements important in this outbreak. Prompt response to contain this outbreak is essential, given the impending move of the nomadic population and their herds to southern Sub Saharan areas. No mention is made about plans to vaccinate animals before they move south. It would seem that a vaccination campaign in the region for RVF would not only address the livestock problem, but would reduce human risk of infection as well.\n\nMod.CRD's excellent earlier comment stated, \"Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a peracute or acute zoonotic disease of domestic ruminants.

IFRC and Unicef are supporting outbreak response.\n\nThe NGO ALIMA and the Nigerian NGO BEFEN are providing support for case management and social mobilisation on the ground.\n\nCurrently, in conjunction with the Ministry of Public Health, an entomological survey is being prepared for urgent implementation with WHO technical and financial support. This is to identify potential vectors for RVF in the region and it is considered to be in the definition of vector control activities.\n\nCurrently, some of the main challenges include under-detection of human cases. The risk that only severe cases are being detected and reported cannot be ruled out. There is no national local capacity to test the specimens. For laboratory confirmation for RVF, the samples are being shipped to WHO regional collaborating centres. Moreover, to ascertain the extent of this outbreak, the involvement of the national livestock department is required.\n\nWHO Risk Assessment\nBased on the available information, the event risk assessment is ongoing. The risk of further spread of outbreak within Niger and internationally (especially to neighbouring countries and those on the transhumance and migration routes) cannot be ruled out.\n\nNomadic stockbreeders from Niger and neighbouring countries have just participated in the Cure Sal\u00e9e festival, a major annual mass gathering event from 23-25 Sep [2016]. During this festival, herds are brought to graze on the salty pastures ahead of the dry season. Around 2 million cattle and even more small ruminants were expected to be part of the event.\n\nAt the end of the rainy season, as per known migration patterns, the nomadic human population along with their herds will progressively move to other Southern Sub Saharan countries and irrigation systems along the Niger river where pastures may still be available. In conjunction with the ongoing outbreak, the high density of animals in the area and the transhumance pattern significantly increases the risk of international spread. The security situation in the Sahel is unstable and also needs to be taken into consideration.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Previous reports of this Rift Valley fever (RVF) outbreak have made the number of human cases uncertain. The above report clarifies the case number and provides valuable social and economic elements important in this outbreak. Prompt response to contain this outbreak is essential, given the impending move of the nomadic population and their herds to southern Sub Saharan areas. No mention is made about plans to vaccinate animals before they move south. It would seem that a vaccination campaign in the region for RVF would not only address the livestock problem, but would reduce human risk of infection as well.\n\nMod.CRD's excellent earlier comment stated, \"Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a peracute or acute zoonotic disease of domestic ruminants. The virus is confined to the African continent and Arabian Peninsula. It is caused by a single serotype of a mosquito-borne virus of the _Bunyaviridae_ family (genus _Phlebovirus_). The disease occurs in climatic conditions favouring the breeding of mosquito vectors and is characterised by abortion, neonatal mortality and liver damage. The disease is most severe in sheep, goats, and cattle. Older non-pregnant animals, although susceptible to infection, are more resistant to clinical disease. There is considerable variation in the susceptibility to RVF of animals of different species. Camels usually have an inapparent infection with RVF virus (RVFV), but sudden mortality, neonatal mortality, and abortion occur and abortion rates can be as high as in cattle. Humans are susceptible to RVFV and are infected through contact with infected animal material (body fluids or tissues) or through bites from infected mosquitoes.\"\n\nMaps of Niger can be accessed at http://www.ezilon.com/maps/images/africa/political-map-of-Niger.gif and http://healthmap.org/promed/p/32064. - Mod.TY]\nSee Also\nRift Valley fever - Niger (02): (TH) livestock, human 20160922.4506785\nRift Valley fever - Niger: (TH) livestock, OIE 20160920.4501514\nRift Valley fever - Uganda (04): (KA) 20160613.4283794\nRift Valley fever - Uganda (03): (KA) caprine, OIE 20160401.4133260\nRift Valley fever - Uganda (02): (KA) 20160317.4099896\nRift Valley fever - Uganda: (KA) 20160313.4090478\n2015\n----\nRift Valley Fever - Mauritania (03): ovine, caprine, OIE 20151107.3774473\nRift Valley fever - Mauritania (02) 20151026.3744543\nRift Valley fever - Mauritania: (TG) 20151007.3694282\n2014\n----\nRift Valley fever - Botswana: (CH) bovine, OIE 20140727.2638358\nRift Valley fever - Senegal: (DK) bovine, OIE, 20140318.2341029\n2013\n----\nRift Valley fever, Dorcas gazelle - Senegal: (SL) 1st report, OIE 20130924.1964250\nRift Valley Fever, Sheep, goat and Camelidae - Mauritania, Senegal: OIE 20131018.2008030\nRift Valley fever, Dorcas gazelle - Senegal: (SL) 1st report, OIE 20130924.1964250\n.................................................mpp/dk/ty/je/dk", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "rift valley fever"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2016-08-30 00:00:00", "2016-09-22 00:00:00", "2016-09-16 00:00:00", "2016-03-16 00:00:00", "2016-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2014-03-16 00:00:00", "2013-03-16 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Sanitaire", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Dorcas", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Tchintabaraden", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Tahoua", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "4666462", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Rift Valley fever - Niger (06): (TH) WHO, RFI", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=4666462", "date": "2016-09-29 17:41:35", "main_text": "RIFT VALLEY FEVER - NIGER (03): (TAHOUA) LIVESTOCK, HUMAN\n*********************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Thu 29 Sep 2016\nSource: WHO Emergencies Preparedness, Response [edited]\nhttp://www.who.int/csr/don/29-september-2016-rift-valley-fever-niger/en/\n\n\nOn 30 Aug 2016, WHO received reports about unexplained deaths among humans, along with death and abortion in livestock in the North Western parts of Niger, and the areas bordering Mali.\n\nFrom 2 Aug to 22 Sep 2016, 64 human cases including 23 deaths have been reported in Tchintabaraden health district in Tahoua region.

There is considerable variation in the susceptibility to RVF of animals of different species. Camels usually have an inapparent infection with RVF virus (RVFV), but sudden mortality, neonatal mortality, and abortion occur and abortion rates can be as high as in cattle. Humans are susceptible to RVFV and are infected through contact with infected animal material (body fluids or tissues) or through bites from infected mosquitoes.\"\n\nMaps of Niger can be accessed at http://www.ezilon.com/maps/images/africa/political-map-of-Niger.gif and http://healthmap.org/promed/p/32064. - Mod.TY]\nSee Also\nRift Valley fever - Niger (02): (TH) livestock, human 20160922.4506785\nRift Valley fever - Niger: (TH) livestock, OIE 20160920.4501514\nRift Valley fever - Uganda (04): (KA) 20160613.4283794\nRift Valley fever - Uganda (03): (KA) caprine, OIE 20160401.4133260\nRift Valley fever - Uganda (02): (KA) 20160317.4099896\nRift Valley fever - Uganda: (KA) 20160313.4090478\n2015\n----\nRift Valley Fever - Mauritania (03): ovine, caprine, OIE 20151107.3774473\nRift Valley fever - Mauritania (02) 20151026.3744543\nRift Valley fever - Mauritania: (TG) 20151007.3694282\n2014\n----\nRift Valley fever - Botswana: (CH) bovine, OIE 20140727.2638358\nRift Valley fever - Senegal: (DK) bovine, OIE, 20140318.2341029\n2013\n----\nRift Valley fever, Dorcas gazelle - Senegal: (SL) 1st report, OIE 20130924.1964250\nRift Valley Fever, Sheep, goat and Camelidae - Mauritania, Senegal: OIE 20131018.2008030\nRift Valley fever, Dorcas gazelle - Senegal: (SL) 1st report, OIE 20130924.1964250\n.................................................mpp/dk/ty/je/dk", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "rift valley fever"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2016-08-30 00:00:00", "2016-09-22 00:00:00", "2016-09-16 00:00:00", "2016-03-16 00:00:00", "2016-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2014-03-16 00:00:00", "2013-03-16 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Sanitaire", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Dorcas", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Tchintabaraden", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Tahoua", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "4549902", "headline": "PRO/AH> Foot & mouth disease, Rift Valley fever - Egypt: (QL) mass vaccine, RFI", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=4549902", "date": "2016-09-29 17:41:35", "main_text": "RIFT VALLEY FEVER - NIGER (03): (TAHOUA) LIVESTOCK, HUMAN\n*********************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Thu 29 Sep 2016\nSource: WHO Emergencies Preparedness, Response [edited]\nhttp://www.who.int/csr/don/29-september-2016-rift-valley-fever-niger/en/\n\n\nOn 30 Aug 2016, WHO received reports about unexplained deaths among humans, along with death and abortion in livestock in the North Western parts of Niger, and the areas bordering Mali.\n\nFrom 2 Aug to 22 Sep 2016, 64 human cases including 23 deaths have been reported in Tchintabaraden health district in Tahoua region. The area is mainly populated by nomadic stockbreeders.\n\nMost of the cases are male (62.5 percent), and work as farmers or animal breeders. In the affected area, an epizootic outbreak is also reported among livestock during the same time duration, including deaths and abortions among cattle and small ruminants.\n\nAs of 16 Sep 2016, 6 of the 13 human specimens tested at Institute Pasteur (IP), Dakar were positive for Rift Valley fever (RVF). Among the 6 animal specimens tested, 3 were positive for RVF. Sequencing and further laboratory testing is ongoing. Genetic sequence data is required to confirm or refute the endogenous origin of the outbreak. Moreover, laboratory support for Niger is being considered.\n\nPublic Health Response\nOn 31 Aug [2016], a multisectoral national rapid response team, including members from the Ministry of Health, veterinary services and Centre de Recherche M\u00e9dicale et Sanitaire (CERMES), and World Health Organization, was deployed for field investigation. Ministries of Health and Agriculture/Livestock have developed a national response plan.\n\nThe WHO Country Office continues to provide technical and financial support for surveillance, outbreak investigation, technical guidelines regarding case definition, case management, shipment of samples and risk communication.\n\nFAO, OIE, and WHO are coordinating on animal and human health and providing additional support to Niger for the outbreak response WHO is working with partners in the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) to coordinate international support for the response. IFRC and Unicef are supporting outbreak response.\n\nThe NGO ALIMA and the Nigerian NGO BEFEN are providing support for case management and social mobilisation on the ground.\n\nCurrently, in conjunction with the Ministry of Public Health, an entomological survey is being prepared for urgent implementation with WHO technical and financial support. This is to identify potential vectors for RVF in the region and it is considered to be in the definition of vector control activities.\n\nCurrently, some of the main challenges include under-detection of human cases. The risk that only severe cases are being detected and reported cannot be ruled out. There is no national local capacity to test the specimens. For laboratory confirmation for RVF, the samples are being shipped to WHO regional collaborating centres. Moreover, to ascertain the extent of this outbreak, the involvement of the national livestock department is required.\n\nWHO Risk Assessment\nBased on the available information, the event risk assessment is ongoing. The risk of further spread of outbreak within Niger and internationally (especially to neighbouring countries and those on the transhumance and migration routes) cannot be ruled out.\n\nNomadic stockbreeders from Niger and neighbouring countries have just participated in the Cure Sal\u00e9e festival, a major annual mass gathering event from 23-25 Sep [2016]. During this festival, herds are brought to graze on the salty pastures ahead of the dry season. Around 2 million cattle and even more small ruminants were expected to be part of the event.\n\nAt the end of the rainy season, as per known migration patterns, the nomadic human population along with their herds will progressively move to other Southern Sub Saharan countries and irrigation systems along the Niger river where pastures may still be available. In conjunction with the ongoing outbreak, the high density of animals in the area and the transhumance pattern significantly increases the risk of international spread. The security situation in the Sahel is unstable and also needs to be taken into consideration.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Previous reports of this Rift Valley fever (RVF) outbreak have made the number of human cases uncertain. The above report clarifies the case number and provides valuable social and economic elements important in this outbreak. Prompt response to contain this outbreak is essential, given the impending move of the nomadic population and their herds to southern Sub Saharan areas. No mention is made about plans to vaccinate animals before they move south. It would seem that a vaccination campaign in the region for RVF would not only address the livestock problem, but would reduce human risk of infection as well.\n\nMod.CRD's excellent earlier comment stated, \"Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a peracute or acute zoonotic disease of domestic ruminants. The virus is confined to the African continent and Arabian Peninsula. It is caused by a single serotype of a mosquito-borne virus of the _Bunyaviridae_ family (genus _Phlebovirus_).

Given Uganda's location in the endemic zone of RVF, surveys were conducted on goat farms with a view to establishing presence of RVF virus and existence of its mosquito vectors. A total of 1470 sera were tested using the IgG ELISA and subsequently 700 sera tested using the Virus Neutralization Test (VNT) and a species identification survey for mosquitoes undertaken. The findings revealed an overall seroprevalence of anti-RVF virus IgG of 9.8 percent (95 percent CI, 8.5-11.1 percent). VNT revealed a seroprevalence of 24.3 percent (95 percent CI, 21.1-27.5 percent). The following specific farms had a higher likelihood to have seropositive goats: Lubega (OR 3.5 (1.1-11.3)), Katabarwa (OR 6.4 (2.0-20.5)) and Maduwa (OR 5.3 (1.6-16.7)). Mubende goats were 4 times (OR 4.2 (1.3-13.5)) more likely to be seropositive to RVF virus than Boer goats, and adult goats were 2 times (OR 2.2 (1.5-3.3)) more likely to be seropositive to RVF virus than young ones. Mosquito species found, included, _Anopheles gambiae_ (71.2 percent), _Culex_ sp. (21.5 percent), _Anopheles funestus_ (6.5 percent), _Aedes_ sp. (0.7 percent) and _Mansonia_ sp. (0.2 percent). High prevalence of anti-RVFV IgG in goats in some locations together with presence of RVF virus neutralizing antibodies (up to 1:80) suggested that the RVF virus is endemic in goats in Uganda. Presence of RVF virus coupled with existence of Aedes sp. and Culex sp. mosquito vectors are likely to lead to RVF outbreaks once the mosquito population flares-up due to flooding and increased RVF virus amplification occurs.\" (Magona JW, Galiwango T, Walubengo J, Mukiibi G.

Given Uganda's location in the endemic zone of RVF, surveys were conducted on goat farms with a view to establishing presence of RVF virus and existence of its mosquito vectors. A total of 1470 sera were tested using the IgG ELISA and subsequently 700 sera tested using the Virus Neutralization Test (VNT) and a species identification survey for mosquitoes undertaken. The findings revealed an overall seroprevalence of anti-RVF virus IgG of 9.8 percent (95 percent CI, 8.5-11.1 percent). VNT revealed a seroprevalence of 24.3 percent (95 percent CI, 21.1-27.5 percent). The following specific farms had a higher likelihood to have seropositive goats: Lubega (OR 3.5 (1.1-11.3)), Katabarwa (OR 6.4 (2.0-20.5)) and Maduwa (OR 5.3 (1.6-16.7)). Mubende goats were 4 times (OR 4.2 (1.3-13.5)) more likely to be seropositive to RVF virus than Boer goats, and adult goats were 2 times (OR 2.2 (1.5-3.3)) more likely to be seropositive to RVF virus than young ones. Mosquito species found, included, _Anopheles gambiae_ (71.2 percent), _Culex_ sp. (21.5 percent), _Anopheles funestus_ (6.5 percent), _Aedes_ sp. (0.7 percent) and _Mansonia_ sp. (0.2 percent). High prevalence of anti-RVFV IgG in goats in some locations together with presence of RVF virus neutralizing antibodies (up to 1:80) suggested that the RVF virus is endemic in goats in Uganda. Presence of RVF virus coupled with existence of Aedes sp. and Culex sp. mosquito vectors are likely to lead to RVF outbreaks once the mosquito population flares-up due to flooding and increased RVF virus amplification occurs.\" (Magona JW, Galiwango T, Walubengo J, Mukiibi G.

It has also been reported from Senegal and Mauritania in the western part of the African continent, as well as in the Arabian peninsula (see Nanyingi, M., Munyua, P., Kiama, S., Muchemi, G., Thumbi, S., Bitek, A., Bett, B., Muriithi, R., & Njenga, M.

Given Uganda's location in the endemic zone of RVF, surveys were conducted on goat farms with a view to establishing presence of RVF virus and existence of its mosquito vectors. A total of 1470 sera were tested using the IgG ELISA and subsequently 700 sera tested using the Virus Neutralization Test (VNT) and a species identification survey for mosquitoes undertaken. The findings revealed an overall seroprevalence of anti-RVF virus IgG of 9.8 percent (95 percent CI, 8.5-11.1 percent). VNT revealed a seroprevalence of 24.3 percent (95 percent CI, 21.1-27.5 percent). The following specific farms had a higher likelihood to have seropositive goats: Lubega (OR 3.5 (1.1-11.3)), Katabarwa (OR 6.4 (2.0-20.5)) and Maduwa (OR 5.3 (1.6-16.7)). Mubende goats were 4 times (OR 4.2 (1.3-13.5)) more likely to be seropositive to RVF virus than Boer goats, and adult goats were 2 times (OR 2.2 (1.5-3.3)) more likely to be seropositive to RVF virus than young ones. Mosquito species found, included, _Anopheles gambiae_ (71.2 percent), _Culex_ sp. (21.5 percent), _Anopheles funestus_ (6.5 percent), _Aedes_ sp. (0.7 percent) and _Mansonia_ sp. (0.2 percent). High prevalence of anti-RVFV IgG in goats in some locations together with presence of RVF virus neutralizing antibodies (up to 1:80) suggested that the RVF virus is endemic in goats in Uganda. Presence of RVF virus coupled with existence of Aedes sp. and Culex sp. mosquito vectors are likely to lead to RVF outbreaks once the mosquito population flares-up due to flooding and increased RVF virus amplification occurs.\" (Magona JW, Galiwango T, Walubengo J, Mukiibi G.

Given Uganda's location in the endemic zone of RVF, surveys were conducted on goat farms with a view to establishing presence of RVF virus and existence of its mosquito vectors. A total of 1470 sera were tested using the IgG ELISA and subsequently 700 sera tested using the Virus Neutralization Test (VNT) and a species identification survey for mosquitoes undertaken. The findings revealed an overall seroprevalence of anti-RVF virus IgG of 9.8 percent (95 percent CI, 8.5-11.1 percent). VNT revealed a seroprevalence of 24.3 percent (95 percent CI, 21.1-27.5 percent). The following specific farms had a higher likelihood to have seropositive goats: Lubega (OR 3.5 (1.1-11.3)), Katabarwa (OR 6.4 (2.0-20.5)) and Maduwa (OR 5.3 (1.6-16.7)). Mubende goats were 4 times (OR 4.2 (1.3-13.5)) more likely to be seropositive to RVF virus than Boer goats, and adult goats were 2 times (OR 2.2 (1.5-3.3)) more likely to be seropositive to RVF virus than young ones. Mosquito species found, included, _Anopheles gambiae_ (71.2 percent), _Culex_ sp. (21.5 percent), _Anopheles funestus_ (6.5 percent), _Aedes_ sp. (0.7 percent) and _Mansonia_ sp. (0.2 percent). High prevalence of anti-RVFV IgG in goats in some locations together with presence of RVF virus neutralizing antibodies (up to 1:80) suggested that the RVF virus is endemic in goats in Uganda. Presence of RVF virus coupled with existence of Aedes sp. and Culex sp. mosquito vectors are likely to lead to RVF outbreaks once the mosquito population flares-up due to flooding and increased RVF virus amplification occurs.\" (Magona JW, Galiwango T, Walubengo J, Mukiibi G.

Two new outbreaks were reported in the latest follow-up report (10 Oct 2013). These outbreaks were situated in the Saint Louis region, and the total number of affected animals were 208 goats (37 cases, 8 deaths). The complete details on these latest outbreaks in Senegal are available at: http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=14211\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a peracute or acute zoonotic disease of domestic ruminants in Africa. It is caused by a single serotype of a mosquito-borne bunyavirus of the genus Phlebovirus. The disease occurs in climatic conditions favouring the breeding of mosquito vectors and is characterised by liver damage. The disease is most severe in sheep, goats and cattle, in which it produces abortions in pregnant animals and a high mortality rate in the newborn.\n\nFor additional background information, including diagnostic methods and references, please refer to the OIE Terrestrial Manual 2013, Chapter 2.1.14 \"Rift Valley Fever\" at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.01.14_RVF.pdf\n\nHumans usually get RVF through bites from infected mosquitoes and possibly other biting insects that have virus-contaminated mouthparts. Humans can also get the disease if they are exposed to the blood, body fluids, or tissues of infected animals. Direct exposure to infected animals can occur during slaughter or through veterinary and obstetric procedures. Infection through aerosol transmission of RVF virus has occurred in the laboratory.\n\nRVF virus can cause several different disease syndromes. People with RVF typically have either no symptoms or a mild illness associated with fever and liver abnormalities. However, in some patients the illness can progress to hemorrhagic fever (which can lead to shock or hemorrhage), encephalitis (inflammation of the brain, which can lead to headaches, coma, or seizures), or ocular disease (diseases affecting the eye). Patients who become ill usually experience fever, generalized weakness, back pain, dizziness, and extreme weight loss at the onset of the illness. Typically, patients recover within two days to one week after onset of illness. http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvrd/spb/mnpages/dispages/rvf/rvf_qa.htm\n\nCommunication regarding disease risk and awareness campaigns on risk mitigation is essential in protecting humans from RVF infections by limiting exposure to the RVF virus for populations at risk, such as farmers, veterinarians and slaughterhouse workers. A communication strategy, jointly prepared by the animal and human health authorities, will increase the chances of decreasing the population's risk of exposure to the RVF virus and subsequent disease, as well as increasing consumer confidence and avoiding miscommunication on food safety concerns. http://www.fao.org/docrep/017/ap392e/ap392e.pdf\n\nIn 2010 Mauritania sent an immediate notification to the OIE reporting 3 outbreaks on RFV which occurred in the northern desert region of Adrar. This event was resolved on 28 Feb 2011. Details on these outbreaks and the interactive map are available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=10054\n\nPictures of RVF clinical signs in camels affected in a 2010 outbreak can be seen at, http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/17/10/11-0397-f2.htm\n\nThe most current official information from Mauritania can be found in its 2nd OIE 6-monthly report for 2012. In October 2012, 3 outbreaks of RVF were reported. These were located in the Magta-Lahjar region and the affected species were camelidae (640 susceptible, 78 cases), and sheep and goats (540000 susceptible, 1120 cases, 56 deaths). http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Diseaseinformation/statusdetail\n(Note: to view the information on RVF, you need to scroll down to the name of the disease, country and time period).\n\nIn early September 2012, a human case of RVF was reported in Mauritania. By 30 October 2012, a total of 6 regions were affected with 34 human cases of RVF, including 17 deaths. Only the southern regions of Mauritania, those closest to the usual enzootic areas along the Senegal River, seem to have been involved in this event. See http://www.fao.org/docrep/017/ap392e/ap392e.pdf and ProMed archive number: 20121102.1387490.\n\nThe distribution in animals and humans from 2002 to 2012 can be found in the article on Rift Valley Fever- Vol 27, December 2012 - published by Emergency prevention systems (EMPRES WATCH), FAO. http://www.fao.org/docrep/017/ap392e/ap392e.pdf\n\nIn this latest immediate notification, the reported absence of [livestock] mortality is surprising. RVF is a serious disease in small ruminants, mortality - especially in lambs and, to a somewhat lower rate in kids, is known to be common. This phenomenon may be seen provided the flocks include young animals. In other seasons, older animals may suffer waves of abortions.\n\nIn the most current \"Outbreak Bulletin\" provided from WHO African region (January to July 2013), no outbreaks of RVF were reported. http://www.afro.who.int/en/clusters-a-programmes/dpc/epidemic-a-pandemic-alert-and-response/outbreak-news.html - Mod CRD/AS\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/r/3AVt.]\nSee Also\nRift Valley fever, Dorcas gazelle - Senegal: (SL) 1st report, OIE 20130924.1964250\n\n2012\n----\nRift Valley fever - Mauritania (05): WHO 20121102.1387490\nRift Valley fever - Mauritania (04): (NT) alert 20121024.1362610\nRift Valley fever - Mauritania (03): vector species 20121008.1331095\nRift Valley fever - Mauritania (02): fatalities 20121005.1326899\nRift Valley fever - Mauritania: human, susp, RFI 20121002.1318661\n\n2003\n----\nRift Valley fever, sheep, goat - Senegal: OIE 20031122.2901\nRift Valley Fever - Mauritania: OIE 20031020.2635\nRift Valley fever, livestock, human - Mauritania: OIE 20030105.0034\n\n2002\n----\nRift Valley fever, sheep, goat - Senegal: OIE (02) 20021226.6130\nRift Valley fever, sheep and goat - Senegal: OIE 20021221.6107\nRift Valley fever, human - Mauritania (Gorgol) 20021129.5927\n.................................................crd/arn/jw", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "rift valley fever", "encephalitis"], "syndromes": ["encephalitis"], "event_date": ["2013-03-16 00:00:00", "2013-03-16 00:00:00", "2013-03-16 00:00:00", "2013-03-16 00:00:00", "2013-03-16 00:00:00", "2013-03-16 00:00:00", "2012-10-16 00:00:00", "2013-03-16 00:00:00", "2013-03-16 00:00:00", "2013-03-16 00:00:00", "2013-03-16 00:00:00", "2013-03-16 00:00:00", "2013-09-16 00:00:00", "2010-03-16 00:00:00", "2011-02-28 00:00:00", "2010-03-16 00:00:00", "2012-03-16 00:00:00", "2012-10-16 00:00:00", "1120-03-16 00:00:00", "2012-10-30 00:00:00", "2012-12-27 00:00:00", "2021-03-05 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2003-03-16 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Nouakchott", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Mauritania", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Dorcas", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Phlebovirus", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "WAHID", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Senegal", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Saint Louis", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "3774473", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Rift Valley Fever - Mauritania (03): ovine, caprine, OIE", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=3774473", "date": "2013-10-18 23:46:13", "main_text": "RIFT VALLEY FEVER, SHEEP, GOAT AND CAMELIDAE - MAURITANIA, SENEGAL: OIE\n***********************************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: 17 Oct 2013\nSource: OIE, WAHID weekly disease information 2013;

Two new outbreaks were reported in the latest follow-up report (10 Oct 2013). These outbreaks were situated in the Saint Louis region, and the total number of affected animals were 208 goats (37 cases, 8 deaths). The complete details on these latest outbreaks in Senegal are available at: http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=14211\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a peracute or acute zoonotic disease of domestic ruminants in Africa. It is caused by a single serotype of a mosquito-borne bunyavirus of the genus Phlebovirus. The disease occurs in climatic conditions favouring the breeding of mosquito vectors and is characterised by liver damage. The disease is most severe in sheep, goats and cattle, in which it produces abortions in pregnant animals and a high mortality rate in the newborn.\n\nFor additional background information, including diagnostic methods and references, please refer to the OIE Terrestrial Manual 2013, Chapter 2.1.14 \"Rift Valley Fever\" at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.01.14_RVF.pdf\n\nHumans usually get RVF through bites from infected mosquitoes and possibly other biting insects that have virus-contaminated mouthparts. Humans can also get the disease if they are exposed to the blood, body fluids, or tissues of infected animals. Direct exposure to infected animals can occur during slaughter or through veterinary and obstetric procedures. Infection through aerosol transmission of RVF virus has occurred in the laboratory.\n\nRVF virus can cause several different disease syndromes. People with RVF typically have either no symptoms or a mild illness associated with fever and liver abnormalities. However, in some patients the illness can progress to hemorrhagic fever (which can lead to shock or hemorrhage), encephalitis (inflammation of the brain, which can lead to headaches, coma, or seizures), or ocular disease (diseases affecting the eye). Patients who become ill usually experience fever, generalized weakness, back pain, dizziness, and extreme weight loss at the onset of the illness. Typically, patients recover within two days to one week after onset of illness. http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvrd/spb/mnpages/dispages/rvf/rvf_qa.htm\n\nCommunication regarding disease risk and awareness campaigns on risk mitigation is essential in protecting humans from RVF infections by limiting exposure to the RVF virus for populations at risk, such as farmers, veterinarians and slaughterhouse workers. A communication strategy, jointly prepared by the animal and human health authorities, will increase the chances of decreasing the population's risk of exposure to the RVF virus and subsequent disease, as well as increasing consumer confidence and avoiding miscommunication on food safety concerns. http://www.fao.org/docrep/017/ap392e/ap392e.pdf\n\nIn 2010 Mauritania sent an immediate notification to the OIE reporting 3 outbreaks on RFV which occurred in the northern desert region of Adrar. This event was resolved on 28 Feb 2011. Details on these outbreaks and the interactive map are available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=10054\n\nPictures of RVF clinical signs in camels affected in a 2010 outbreak can be seen at, http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/17/10/11-0397-f2.htm\n\nThe most current official information from Mauritania can be found in its 2nd OIE 6-monthly report for 2012. In October 2012, 3 outbreaks of RVF were reported. These were located in the Magta-Lahjar region and the affected species were camelidae (640 susceptible, 78 cases), and sheep and goats (540000 susceptible, 1120 cases, 56 deaths). http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Diseaseinformation/statusdetail\n(Note: to view the information on RVF, you need to scroll down to the name of the disease, country and time period).\n\nIn early September 2012, a human case of RVF was reported in Mauritania. By 30 October 2012, a total of 6 regions were affected with 34 human cases of RVF, including 17 deaths. Only the southern regions of Mauritania, those closest to the usual enzootic areas along the Senegal River, seem to have been involved in this event. See http://www.fao.org/docrep/017/ap392e/ap392e.pdf and ProMed archive number: 20121102.1387490.\n\nThe distribution in animals and humans from 2002 to 2012 can be found in the article on Rift Valley Fever- Vol 27, December 2012 - published by Emergency prevention systems (EMPRES WATCH), FAO. http://www.fao.org/docrep/017/ap392e/ap392e.pdf\n\nIn this latest immediate notification, the reported absence of [livestock] mortality is surprising. RVF is a serious disease in small ruminants, mortality - especially in lambs and, to a somewhat lower rate in kids, is known to be common.

Two new outbreaks were reported in the latest follow-up report (10 Oct 2013). These outbreaks were situated in the Saint Louis region, and the total number of affected animals were 208 goats (37 cases, 8 deaths). The complete details on these latest outbreaks in Senegal are available at: http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=14211\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a peracute or acute zoonotic disease of domestic ruminants in Africa. It is caused by a single serotype of a mosquito-borne bunyavirus of the genus Phlebovirus. The disease occurs in climatic conditions favouring the breeding of mosquito vectors and is characterised by liver damage. The disease is most severe in sheep, goats and cattle, in which it produces abortions in pregnant animals and a high mortality rate in the newborn.\n\nFor additional background information, including diagnostic methods and references, please refer to the OIE Terrestrial Manual 2013, Chapter 2.1.14 \"Rift Valley Fever\" at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.01.14_RVF.pdf\n\nHumans usually get RVF through bites from infected mosquitoes and possibly other biting insects that have virus-contaminated mouthparts. Humans can also get the disease if they are exposed to the blood, body fluids, or tissues of infected animals. Direct exposure to infected animals can occur during slaughter or through veterinary and obstetric procedures. Infection through aerosol transmission of RVF virus has occurred in the laboratory.\n\nRVF virus can cause several different disease syndromes. People with RVF typically have either no symptoms or a mild illness associated with fever and liver abnormalities. However, in some patients the illness can progress to hemorrhagic fever (which can lead to shock or hemorrhage), encephalitis (inflammation of the brain, which can lead to headaches, coma, or seizures), or ocular disease (diseases affecting the eye). Patients who become ill usually experience fever, generalized weakness, back pain, dizziness, and extreme weight loss at the onset of the illness. Typically, patients recover within two days to one week after onset of illness. http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvrd/spb/mnpages/dispages/rvf/rvf_qa.htm\n\nCommunication regarding disease risk and awareness campaigns on risk mitigation is essential in protecting humans from RVF infections by limiting exposure to the RVF virus for populations at risk, such as farmers, veterinarians and slaughterhouse workers. A communication strategy, jointly prepared by the animal and human health authorities, will increase the chances of decreasing the population's risk of exposure to the RVF virus and subsequent disease, as well as increasing consumer confidence and avoiding miscommunication on food safety concerns. http://www.fao.org/docrep/017/ap392e/ap392e.pdf\n\nIn 2010 Mauritania sent an immediate notification to the OIE reporting 3 outbreaks on RFV which occurred in the northern desert region of Adrar. This event was resolved on 28 Feb 2011. Details on these outbreaks and the interactive map are available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=10054\n\nPictures of RVF clinical signs in camels affected in a 2010 outbreak can be seen at, http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/17/10/11-0397-f2.htm\n\nThe most current official information from Mauritania can be found in its 2nd OIE 6-monthly report for 2012. In October 2012, 3 outbreaks of RVF were reported. These were located in the Magta-Lahjar region and the affected species were camelidae (640 susceptible, 78 cases), and sheep and goats (540000 susceptible, 1120 cases, 56 deaths). http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Diseaseinformation/statusdetail\n(Note: to view the information on RVF, you need to scroll down to the name of the disease, country and time period).\n\nIn early September 2012, a human case of RVF was reported in Mauritania. By 30 October 2012, a total of 6 regions were affected with 34 human cases of RVF, including 17 deaths. Only the southern regions of Mauritania, those closest to the usual enzootic areas along the Senegal River, seem to have been involved in this event. See http://www.fao.org/docrep/017/ap392e/ap392e.pdf and ProMed archive number: 20121102.1387490.\n\nThe distribution in animals and humans from 2002 to 2012 can be found in the article on Rift Valley Fever- Vol 27, December 2012 - published by Emergency prevention systems (EMPRES WATCH), FAO. http://www.fao.org/docrep/017/ap392e/ap392e.pdf\n\nIn this latest immediate notification, the reported absence of [livestock] mortality is surprising. RVF is a serious disease in small ruminants, mortality - especially in lambs and, to a somewhat lower rate in kids, is known to be common.

Two new outbreaks were reported in the latest follow-up report (10 Oct 2013). These outbreaks were situated in the Saint Louis region, and the total number of affected animals were 208 goats (37 cases, 8 deaths). The complete details on these latest outbreaks in Senegal are available at: http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=14211\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a peracute or acute zoonotic disease of domestic ruminants in Africa. It is caused by a single serotype of a mosquito-borne bunyavirus of the genus Phlebovirus. The disease occurs in climatic conditions favouring the breeding of mosquito vectors and is characterised by liver damage. The disease is most severe in sheep, goats and cattle, in which it produces abortions in pregnant animals and a high mortality rate in the newborn.\n\nFor additional background information, including diagnostic methods and references, please refer to the OIE Terrestrial Manual 2013, Chapter 2.1.14 \"Rift Valley Fever\" at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.01.14_RVF.pdf\n\nHumans usually get RVF through bites from infected mosquitoes and possibly other biting insects that have virus-contaminated mouthparts. Humans can also get the disease if they are exposed to the blood, body fluids, or tissues of infected animals. Direct exposure to infected animals can occur during slaughter or through veterinary and obstetric procedures. Infection through aerosol transmission of RVF virus has occurred in the laboratory.\n\nRVF virus can cause several different disease syndromes. People with RVF typically have either no symptoms or a mild illness associated with fever and liver abnormalities. However, in some patients the illness can progress to hemorrhagic fever (which can lead to shock or hemorrhage), encephalitis (inflammation of the brain, which can lead to headaches, coma, or seizures), or ocular disease (diseases affecting the eye). Patients who become ill usually experience fever, generalized weakness, back pain, dizziness, and extreme weight loss at the onset of the illness. Typically, patients recover within two days to one week after onset of illness. http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvrd/spb/mnpages/dispages/rvf/rvf_qa.htm\n\nCommunication regarding disease risk and awareness campaigns on risk mitigation is essential in protecting humans from RVF infections by limiting exposure to the RVF virus for populations at risk, such as farmers, veterinarians and slaughterhouse workers. A communication strategy, jointly prepared by the animal and human health authorities, will increase the chances of decreasing the population's risk of exposure to the RVF virus and subsequent disease, as well as increasing consumer confidence and avoiding miscommunication on food safety concerns. http://www.fao.org/docrep/017/ap392e/ap392e.pdf\n\nIn 2010 Mauritania sent an immediate notification to the OIE reporting 3 outbreaks on RFV which occurred in the northern desert region of Adrar. This event was resolved on 28 Feb 2011. Details on these outbreaks and the interactive map are available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=10054\n\nPictures of RVF clinical signs in camels affected in a 2010 outbreak can be seen at, http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/17/10/11-0397-f2.htm\n\nThe most current official information from Mauritania can be found in its 2nd OIE 6-monthly report for 2012. In October 2012, 3 outbreaks of RVF were reported. These were located in the Magta-Lahjar region and the affected species were camelidae (640 susceptible, 78 cases), and sheep and goats (540000 susceptible, 1120 cases, 56 deaths). http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Diseaseinformation/statusdetail\n(Note: to view the information on RVF, you need to scroll down to the name of the disease, country and time period).\n\nIn early September 2012, a human case of RVF was reported in Mauritania. By 30 October 2012, a total of 6 regions were affected with 34 human cases of RVF, including 17 deaths. Only the southern regions of Mauritania, those closest to the usual enzootic areas along the Senegal River, seem to have been involved in this event. See http://www.fao.org/docrep/017/ap392e/ap392e.pdf and ProMed archive number: 20121102.1387490.\n\nThe distribution in animals and humans from 2002 to 2012 can be found in the article on Rift Valley Fever- Vol 27, December 2012 - published by Emergency prevention systems (EMPRES WATCH), FAO. http://www.fao.org/docrep/017/ap392e/ap392e.pdf\n\nIn this latest immediate notification, the reported absence of [livestock] mortality is surprising. RVF is a serious disease in small ruminants, mortality - especially in lambs and, to a somewhat lower rate in kids, is known to be common. This phenomenon may be seen provided the flocks include young animals.

In other seasons, older animals may suffer waves of abortions.\n\nIn the most current \"Outbreak Bulletin\" provided from WHO African region (January to July 2013), no outbreaks of RVF were reported. http://www.afro.who.int/en/clusters-a-programmes/dpc/epidemic-a-pandemic-alert-and-response/outbreak-news.html - Mod CRD/AS\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/r/3AVt.]\nSee Also\nRift Valley fever, Dorcas gazelle - Senegal: (SL) 1st report, OIE 20130924.1964250\n\n2012\n----\nRift Valley fever - Mauritania (05): WHO 20121102.1387490\nRift Valley fever - Mauritania (04): (NT) alert 20121024.1362610\nRift Valley fever - Mauritania (03): vector species 20121008.1331095\nRift Valley fever - Mauritania (02): fatalities 20121005.1326899\nRift Valley fever - Mauritania: human, susp, RFI 20121002.1318661\n\n2003\n----\nRift Valley fever, sheep, goat - Senegal: OIE 20031122.2901\nRift Valley Fever - Mauritania: OIE 20031020.2635\nRift Valley fever, livestock, human - Mauritania: OIE 20030105.0034\n\n2002\n----\nRift Valley fever, sheep, goat - Senegal: OIE (02) 20021226.6130\nRift Valley fever, sheep and goat - Senegal: OIE 20021221.6107\nRift Valley fever, human - Mauritania (Gorgol) 20021129.5927\n.................................................crd/arn/jw", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "rift valley fever", "encephalitis"], "syndromes": ["encephalitis"], "event_date": ["2013-03-16 00:00:00", "2013-03-16 00:00:00", "2013-03-16 00:00:00", "2013-03-16 00:00:00", "2013-03-16 00:00:00", "2013-03-16 00:00:00", "2012-10-16 00:00:00", "2013-03-16 00:00:00", "2013-03-16 00:00:00", "2013-03-16 00:00:00", "2013-03-16 00:00:00", "2013-03-16 00:00:00", "2013-09-16 00:00:00", "2010-03-16 00:00:00", "2011-02-28 00:00:00", "2010-03-16 00:00:00", "2012-03-16 00:00:00", "2012-10-16 00:00:00", "1120-03-16 00:00:00", "2012-10-30 00:00:00", "2012-12-27 00:00:00", "2021-03-05 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2003-03-16 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Nouakchott", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Mauritania", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Dorcas", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Phlebovirus", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "WAHID", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Senegal", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Saint Louis", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "2007467", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Rift Valley fever - South Sudan: (EE, UN) RFI", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=2007467", "date": "2011-11-29 21:06:58", "main_text": "RIFT VALLEY FEVER, HUMAN - FRANCE (02): ex ZIMBABWE (MASHONALAND EAST)\nNOT\n**************************************************************************\n\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Tue 29 Nov 2011\nFrom: Marc Grandadam [edited]\n<marc.grandadam@pasteur.fr>\n\n\nRift Valley Fever, France ex Zimbabwe: not confirmed\n----------------------------------------------------\nOn Thu 20 Oct 2011, a case of Rift Valley fever (RVF) imported into\nFrance from Zimbabwe was reported by ProMED-mail (Rift Valley fever,\nhuman - France: ex Zimbabwe (ME) 1st Archive Number: 20111020.3132).\nAs reporting of RVF is mandatory in France, the patient's samples were\nsent to the National Reference Laboratory for Arboviruses for\nconfirmation.\n\nThe 1st serum, obtained at day 25 after symptom onset was\nreinvestigated for the presence of anti-arbovirus antibodies (i.e.,\nDengue; Chikungunya; West Nile; Rift Valley fever).

The\nIndependent press, quoting from official sources, speaks of 17 deaths.\n\n\"Cases of fever Rift Valley [fever] have caused losses of (human)\nlives and of livestock,\" stated the Mauritanian News Agency (l'Agence\nmauritanienne d'information, AMI), without specifying the total.\nAccording to local independent media, the epidemic has already killed\n17 people, and the sick were sent to hospitals including those in Nouakchott.\n\nThe Minister of Health and Interior visiting the region has given\nstrict instructions to the population of the Adrar (the region where\nAoujeft is situated) that they must refrain, in response to these\n[Rift Valley] fever cases, from consuming locally produced meat and\nmilk, says AMI. These restrictions on meat and milk, 2 essential\ncommodities in the diet of the people, must last at least until the\ninvestigation is finished and the results of laboratory tests\nconducted since Thursday [2 Dec 2010] by veterinary specialists on\ninfected animals are confirmed says AMI.\n\nRift Valley fever is a disease that primarily affects animals but can\nalso infect humans. The infection can cause severe disease in both\nanimals and humans. The deaths and abortions in cattle infected with\nthe disease also result in substantial economic losses.\n\nThere is no specific treatment, and no human vaccine is available\nagainst the disease, which is transmitted by mosquitoes and affects\nmainly young men in contact with infected cattle.\n\nRift Valley fever bears the name of the region of Kenya where it was\nidentified in 1931. The disease has hit Kenya, Somalia and Tanzania\nin the years 1967/68, and the last major outbreak was reported in\n2000 in Yemen and Saudi Arabia [and Mauritania in 2003; see\nProMED-mail archive references below].\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nHealthMap Alerts via\nProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Mortality on this scale is unusual for local outbreaks of Rift\nValley fever. The text of this press report suggests that a precise\ndiagnosis has still to be confirmed. Further information is awaited.\n\nRift Valley fever (RVF) is a viral zoonosis that primarily affects\nanimals but also has the capacity to infect humans. Infection can\ncause severe disease in both animals and humans. The disease also\nresults in significant economic losses due to death and abortion\namong RVF-infected livestock.\n\nRVF virus is a member of the _Phlebovirus_ genus, one of the 5 genera\nin the family _Bunyaviridae_. The virus was 1st identified in 1931\nduring an investigation into an epidemic among sheep on a farm in the\nRift Valley of Kenya. Since then, outbreaks have been reported in\nsub-Saharan and North Africa [Mauritania]. In 1997-98, a major\noutbreak occurred in Kenya, Somalia and Tanzania, and in September\n2000, RVF cases were confirmed in Saudi Arabia and Yemen, marking the\n1st reported occurrence of the disease outside the African continent.\n\nThe vast majority of human infections result from direct or indirect\ncontact with the blood or organs of infected animals. The virus can\nbe transmitted to humans through the handling of animal tissue during\nslaughtering or butchering, assisting with animal births, conducting\nveterinary procedures, or from the disposal of carcasses or fetuses.\nCertain occupational groups such as herders, farmers, slaughterhouse\nworkers and veterinarians are, therefore, at higher risk of\ninfection. The virus infects humans through inoculation, for example\nvia a wound from an infected knife or through contact with broken\nskin, or through inhalation of aerosols produced during the slaughter\nof infected animals.\n\nThere is some evidence that humans may also become infected with RVF\nby ingesting the unpasteurized or uncooked milk of infected animals.\nHuman infections have also resulted from the bites of infected\nmosquitoes, most commonly the _Aedes_ mosquito. Transmission of RVF\nvirus by hematophagous (blood-feeding) flies is also possible. To\ndate, no human-to-human transmission of RVF has been documented, and\nno transmission of RVF to health care workers has been reported when\nstandard infection control precautions have been put in place. There\nhas been no evidence of outbreaks of RVF in urban areas.\n\nWhile most human cases are relatively mild, a small percentage of\npatients develop a much more severe form of the disease. This usually\nappears as one or more of 3 distinct syndromes: ocular (eye) disease\n(0.5-2 percent of patients), meningoencephalitis (less than one\npercent) or haemorrhagic fever (less than one percent).\n\nThe total case fatality rate has varied widely between different\nepidemics but, overall, has been less than one percent in those\ndocumented. Most fatalities occur in patients who develop the\nhaemorrhagic icterus form.\n\nMore detailed information can be obtained from the WHO website at:\n<http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs207/en/index.html>.\n\nThe HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map of Mauritania can be\naccessed at: <http://healthmap.org/r/0hQ0>. - Mod.CP]\nSee Also\nUndiagnosed fatalities - Mauritania (02): (AD) RFI 20101106.4028\nUndiagnosed fatalities - Mauritania: (AD) RFI 20101104.3992\n2003\n----\nRift Valley Fever - Mauritania: OIE 20031020.2635\nRift Valley fever, livestock, human - Mauritania: OIE 20030105.0034\n2002\n----\nRift Valley fever, human - Mauritania (Gorgol) 20021129.5927\n1999\n----\nRift valley fever - Mauritania (04) 19990101.0001\n1998\n----\nRift valley fever - Mauritania (03) 19981114.2197\nRift valley fever - Mauritania (02) 19981111.2181\nRift valley fever - Mauritania: RFI 19981105.2155\n..............................................sb/cp/msp/dk\n\n*##########################################################*\n************************************************************\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.

Further information is awaited.\n\nRift Valley fever (RVF) is a viral zoonosis that primarily affects\nanimals but also has the capacity to infect humans. Infection can\ncause severe disease in both animals and humans. The disease also\nresults in significant economic losses due to death and abortion\namong RVF-infected livestock.\n\nRVF virus is a member of the _Phlebovirus_ genus, one of the 5 genera\nin the family _Bunyaviridae_. The virus was 1st identified in 1931\nduring an investigation into an epidemic among sheep on a farm in the\nRift Valley of Kenya. Since then, outbreaks have been reported in\nsub-Saharan and North Africa [Mauritania]. In 1997-98, a major\noutbreak occurred in Kenya, Somalia and Tanzania, and in September\n2000, RVF cases were confirmed in Saudi Arabia and Yemen, marking the\n1st reported occurrence of the disease outside the African continent.\n\nThe vast majority of human infections result from direct or indirect\ncontact with the blood or organs of infected animals. The virus can\nbe transmitted to humans through the handling of animal tissue during\nslaughtering or butchering, assisting with animal births, conducting\nveterinary procedures, or from the disposal of carcasses or fetuses.\nCertain occupational groups such as herders, farmers, slaughterhouse\nworkers and veterinarians are, therefore, at higher risk of\ninfection. The virus infects humans through inoculation, for example\nvia a wound from an infected knife or through contact with broken\nskin, or through inhalation of aerosols produced during the slaughter\nof infected animals.\n\nThere is some evidence that humans may also become infected with RVF\nby ingesting the unpasteurized or uncooked milk of infected animals.\nHuman infections have also resulted from the bites of infected\nmosquitoes, most commonly the _Aedes_ mosquito. Transmission of RVF\nvirus by hematophagous (blood-feeding) flies is also possible. To\ndate, no human-to-human transmission of RVF has been documented, and\nno transmission of RVF to health care workers has been reported when\nstandard infection control precautions have been put in place. There\nhas been no evidence of outbreaks of RVF in urban areas.\n\nWhile most human cases are relatively mild, a small percentage of\npatients develop a much more severe form of the disease. This usually\nappears as one or more of 3 distinct syndromes: ocular (eye) disease\n(0.5-2 percent of patients), meningoencephalitis (less than one\npercent) or haemorrhagic fever (less than one percent).\n\nThe total case fatality rate has varied widely between different\nepidemics but, overall, has been less than one percent in those\ndocumented.

The disease also\nresults in significant economic losses due to death and abortion\namong RVF-infected livestock.\n\nRVF virus is a member of the _Phlebovirus_ genus, one of the 5 genera\nin the family _Bunyaviridae_. The virus was 1st identified in 1931\nduring an investigation into an epidemic among sheep on a farm in the\nRift Valley of Kenya. Since then, outbreaks have been reported in\nsub-Saharan and North Africa [Mauritania]. In 1997-98, a major\noutbreak occurred in Kenya, Somalia and Tanzania, and in September\n2000, RVF cases were confirmed in Saudi Arabia and Yemen, marking the\n1st reported occurrence of the disease outside the African continent.\n\nThe vast majority of human infections result from direct or indirect\ncontact with the blood or organs of infected animals. The virus can\nbe transmitted to humans through the handling of animal tissue during\nslaughtering or butchering, assisting with animal births, conducting\nveterinary procedures, or from the disposal of carcasses or fetuses.\nCertain occupational groups such as herders, farmers, slaughterhouse\nworkers and veterinarians are, therefore, at higher risk of\ninfection. The virus infects humans through inoculation, for example\nvia a wound from an infected knife or through contact with broken\nskin, or through inhalation of aerosols produced during the slaughter\nof infected animals.\n\nThere is some evidence that humans may also become infected with RVF\nby ingesting the unpasteurized or uncooked milk of infected animals.\nHuman infections have also resulted from the bites of infected\nmosquitoes, most commonly the _Aedes_ mosquito. Transmission of RVF\nvirus by hematophagous (blood-feeding) flies is also possible. To\ndate, no human-to-human transmission of RVF has been documented, and\nno transmission of RVF to health care workers has been reported when\nstandard infection control precautions have been put in place. There\nhas been no evidence of outbreaks of RVF in urban areas.\n\nWhile most human cases are relatively mild, a small percentage of\npatients develop a much more severe form of the disease. This usually\nappears as one or more of 3 distinct syndromes: ocular (eye) disease\n(0.5-2 percent of patients), meningoencephalitis (less than one\npercent) or haemorrhagic fever (less than one percent).\n\nThe total case fatality rate has varied widely between different\nepidemics but, overall, has been less than one percent in those\ndocumented. Most fatalities occur in patients who develop the\nhaemorrhagic icterus form.\n\nMore detailed information can be obtained from the WHO website at:\n<http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs207/en/index.html>.\n\nThe HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map of Mauritania can be\naccessed at: <http://healthmap.org/r/0hQ0>. - Mod.CP]\nSee Also\nUndiagnosed fatalities - Mauritania (02): (AD) RFI 20101106.4028\nUndiagnosed fatalities - Mauritania: (AD) RFI 20101104.3992\n2003\n----\nRift Valley Fever - Mauritania: OIE 20031020.2635\nRift Valley fever, livestock, human - Mauritania: OIE 20030105.0034\n2002\n----\nRift Valley fever, human - Mauritania (Gorgol) 20021129.5927\n1999\n----\nRift valley fever - Mauritania (04) 19990101.0001\n1998\n----\nRift valley fever - Mauritania (03) 19981114.2197\nRift valley fever - Mauritania (02) 19981111.2181\nRift valley fever - Mauritania: RFI 19981105.2155\n..............................................sb/cp/msp/dk\n\n*##########################################################*\n************************************************************\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.

The virus infects humans through inoculation, for example\nvia a wound from an infected knife or through contact with broken\nskin, or through inhalation of aerosols produced during the slaughter\nof infected animals.\n\nThere is some evidence that humans may also become infected with RVF\nby ingesting the unpasteurized or uncooked milk of infected animals.\nHuman infections have also resulted from the bites of infected\nmosquitoes, most commonly the _Aedes_ mosquito. Transmission of RVF\nvirus by hematophagous (blood-feeding) flies is also possible. To\ndate, no human-to-human transmission of RVF has been documented, and\nno transmission of RVF to health care workers has been reported when\nstandard infection control precautions have been put in place. There\nhas been no evidence of outbreaks of RVF in urban areas.\n\nWhile most human cases are relatively mild, a small percentage of\npatients develop a much more severe form of the disease. This usually\nappears as one or more of 3 distinct syndromes: ocular (eye) disease\n(0.5-2 percent of patients), meningoencephalitis (less than one\npercent) or haemorrhagic fever (less than one percent).\n\nThe total case fatality rate has varied widely between different\nepidemics but, overall, has been less than one percent in those\ndocumented. Most fatalities occur in patients who develop the\nhaemorrhagic icterus form.\n\nMore detailed information can be obtained from the WHO website at:\n<http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs207/en/index.html>.\n\nThe HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map of Mauritania can be\naccessed at: <http://healthmap.org/r/0hQ0>. - Mod.CP]\nSee Also\nUndiagnosed fatalities - Mauritania (02): (AD) RFI 20101106.4028\nUndiagnosed fatalities - Mauritania: (AD) RFI 20101104.3992\n2003\n----\nRift Valley Fever - Mauritania: OIE 20031020.2635\nRift Valley fever, livestock, human - Mauritania: OIE 20030105.0034\n2002\n----\nRift Valley fever, human - Mauritania (Gorgol) 20021129.5927\n1999\n----\nRift valley fever - Mauritania (04) 19990101.0001\n1998\n----\nRift valley fever - Mauritania (03) 19981114.2197\nRift valley fever - Mauritania (02) 19981111.2181\nRift valley fever - Mauritania: RFI 19981105.2155\n..............................................sb/cp/msp/dk\n\n*##########################################################*\n************************************************************\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.

Additional laboratory\nanalyses, conducted both in Germany and in South Africa, however,\ncould not confirm this preliminary diagnosis.\n\nTesting of a 2nd, convalescent serum sample at BNI did not reveal an\nincrease in anti-RVF virus antibody titres indicating that the\nantibodies are not related to the illness following the travel to\nSouth Africa. The serum samples, which were sent to and investigated\nat the Special Pathogens Unit, National Institute for Communicable\nDiseases of the National Health Laboratory Service (SPU NICD-NHLS),\nSandringham, South Africa, tested negative for RVF virus-specific\nantibodies in different tests, including ELISA and virus neutralizing assays.\n\nWhile the reason for the discrepant findings remains unclear, in 3\nlaboratories, including BNI and SPU NICD-NHLS, seroconversion to\nRickettsia-specific IgM and IgG was detected, indicating recent\ninfection with _Rickettsia_ sp. We conclude from these new findings\nthat the acute illness in the case-patient after returning from South\nAfrica was caused by infection with _Rickettsia_ and not with RVF virus.\n\n--\nProf. Stephan Gunther\nDepartment of Virology\nBernhard-Nocht-Institute for Tropical Medicine\nBernhard-Nocht-Str. 74, 20359 Hamburg, Germany\n<guenther@bni.uni-hamburg.de>\n\nProf. Janusz T.

The virus can\nbe transmitted to humans through the handling of animal tissue during\nslaughtering or butchering, assisting with animal births, conducting\nveterinary procedures, or from the disposal of carcasses or fetuses.\nCertain occupational groups such as herders, farmers, abbatoir\nworkers and veterinarians are therefore at higher risk of infection.\nHuman infections have also resulted from the bites of infected\nmosquitoes, most commonly the _Aedes_ mosquito, and transmission of\nRVF virus by hematophagous (blood-feeding) flies is also possible.\n\nWhile most human cases are relatively mild, a small percentage of\npatients develop a much more severe form of the disease. This usually\nappears as one or more of 3 distinct syndromes: ocular disease (0.5-2\npercent of patients), meningoencephalitis (less than 1 percent) or\nhaemorrhagic fever (less than 1 percent). The total case fatality\nrate has varied widely between different epidemics but, overall, has\nbeen less than 1 percent in those documented. Most fatalities occur\nin patients who develop the haemorrhagic icterus form.\n\nAs outbreaks of RVF in animals precede human cases, the establishment\nof an active animal health surveillance system to detect new cases is\nessential in providing early warning for veterinary and human public\nhealth authorities.

Infection can cause\nsevere disease in both animals and humans, leading to high rates of disease\nand death. The disease also results in significant economic losses due to\ndeath and abortion among RVF-infected livestock.\n\n\"RVF virus is a member of the _Phlebovirus_ genus, one of the 5 genera in\nthe family _Bunyaviridae_. The virus was 1st identified in 1931 during an\ninvestigation into an epidemic among sheep on a farm in the Rift Valley of\nKenya. Since then, outbreaks have been reported in sub-Saharan and North\nAfrica. In 1997-1998, a major outbreak occurred in Kenya, Somalia and\nTanzania and in September 2000, RVF cases were confirmed in Saudi Arabia\nand Yemen, marking the 1st reported occurrence of the disease outside the\nAfrican continent and raising concerns that it could extend to other parts\nof Asia and Europe.\n\n\"The vast majority of human infections result from direct or indirect\ncontact with the blood or organs of infected animals. The virus can be\ntransmitted to humans through the handling of animal tissue during\nslaughtering or butchering, assisting with animal births, conducting\nveterinary procedures, or from the disposal of carcasses or fetuses.\nCertain occupational groups such as herders, farmers, slaughterhouse\nworkers and veterinarians are therefore at higher risk of infection. The\nvirus infects humans through inoculation, for example via a wound from an\ninfected knife or through contact with broken skin, or through inhalation\nof aerosols produced during the slaughter of infected animals. The aerosol\nmode of transmission has also led to infection in laboratory workers.\n\n\"While most human cases are relatively mild, a small percentage of patients\ndevelop a much more severe form of the disease. This usually appears as one\nor more of 3 distinct syndromes: ocular (eye) disease (0.5-2 per cent of\npatients), meningoencephalitis (less than 1 per cent) or haemorrhagic fever\n(less than 1 per cent). The total case fatality rate has varied widely\nbetween different epidemics but, overall, has been less than 1 per cent in\nthose documented. Most fatalities occur in patients who develop the\nhaemorrhagic icterus form.\n\n\"During an outbreak of RVF, close contact with animals, particularly with\ntheir body fluids, either directly or via aerosols, has been identified as\nthe most significant risk factor for RVF virus infection. In the absence of\nspecific treatment and an effective human vaccine, raising awareness of the\nrisk factors of RVF infection as well as the protective measures\nindividuals can take to prevent mosquito bites, is the only way to reduce\nhuman infection and deaths.\"\n\nA map of the states of Sudan can be accessed at\n<http://www.emro.who.int/sudan/Media/PDF/Sud-states-2006.pdf>.

Infection can cause\nsevere disease in both animals and humans, leading to high rates of disease\nand death. The disease also results in significant economic losses due to\ndeath and abortion among RVF-infected livestock.\n\n\"RVF virus is a member of the _Phlebovirus_ genus, one of the 5 genera in\nthe family _Bunyaviridae_. The virus was 1st identified in 1931 during an\ninvestigation into an epidemic among sheep on a farm in the Rift Valley of\nKenya. Since then, outbreaks have been reported in sub-Saharan and North\nAfrica. In 1997-1998, a major outbreak occurred in Kenya, Somalia and\nTanzania and in September 2000, RVF cases were confirmed in Saudi Arabia\nand Yemen, marking the 1st reported occurrence of the disease outside the\nAfrican continent and raising concerns that it could extend to other parts\nof Asia and Europe.\n\n\"The vast majority of human infections result from direct or indirect\ncontact with the blood or organs of infected animals. The virus can be\ntransmitted to humans through the handling of animal tissue during\nslaughtering or butchering, assisting with animal births, conducting\nveterinary procedures, or from the disposal of carcasses or fetuses.\nCertain occupational groups such as herders, farmers, slaughterhouse\nworkers and veterinarians are therefore at higher risk of infection. The\nvirus infects humans through inoculation, for example via a wound from an\ninfected knife or through contact with broken skin, or through inhalation\nof aerosols produced during the slaughter of infected animals. The aerosol\nmode of transmission has also led to infection in laboratory workers.\n\n\"While most human cases are relatively mild, a small percentage of patients\ndevelop a much more severe form of the disease. This usually appears as one\nor more of 3 distinct syndromes: ocular (eye) disease (0.5-2 per cent of\npatients), meningoencephalitis (less than 1 per cent) or haemorrhagic fever\n(less than 1 per cent). The total case fatality rate has varied widely\nbetween different epidemics but, overall, has been less than 1 per cent in\nthose documented. Most fatalities occur in patients who develop the\nhaemorrhagic icterus form.\n\n\"During an outbreak of RVF, close contact with animals, particularly with\ntheir body fluids, either directly or via aerosols, has been identified as\nthe most significant risk factor for RVF virus infection.

WHO continues to support the Sudan Ministry\nof Health in preparedness for viral haemorrhagic fever and other seasonal\noutbreaks and in the procurement of essential supplies, enhancing\nsurveillance and training activities.\n\nFor more information, see the WHO RVF Fact Sheet at\n<http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs207/en/index.html>, parts of\nwhich are appended below.\n\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail rapporteur Marianne Hopp\n\n[\"Rift Valley Fever (RVF) is a viral zoonosis that primarily affects\nanimals but also has the capacity to infect humans. Infection can cause\nsevere disease in both animals and humans, leading to high rates of disease\nand death. The disease also results in significant economic losses due to\ndeath and abortion among RVF-infected livestock.\n\n\"RVF virus is a member of the _Phlebovirus_ genus, one of the 5 genera in\nthe family _Bunyaviridae_. The virus was 1st identified in 1931 during an\ninvestigation into an epidemic among sheep on a farm in the Rift Valley of\nKenya. Since then, outbreaks have been reported in sub-Saharan and North\nAfrica. In 1997-1998, a major outbreak occurred in Kenya, Somalia and\nTanzania and in September 2000, RVF cases were confirmed in Saudi Arabia\nand Yemen, marking the 1st reported occurrence of the disease outside the\nAfrican continent and raising concerns that it could extend to other parts\nof Asia and Europe.\n\n\"The vast majority of human infections result from direct or indirect\ncontact with the blood or organs of infected animals. The virus can be\ntransmitted to humans through the handling of animal tissue during\nslaughtering or butchering, assisting with animal births, conducting\nveterinary procedures, or from the disposal of carcasses or fetuses.\nCertain occupational groups such as herders, farmers, slaughterhouse\nworkers and veterinarians are therefore at higher risk of infection. The\nvirus infects humans through inoculation, for example via a wound from an\ninfected knife or through contact with broken skin, or through inhalation\nof aerosols produced during the slaughter of infected animals. The aerosol\nmode of transmission has also led to infection in laboratory workers.\n\n\"While most human cases are relatively mild, a small percentage of patients\ndevelop a much more severe form of the disease. This usually appears as one\nor more of 3 distinct syndromes: ocular (eye) disease (0.5-2 per cent of\npatients), meningoencephalitis (less than 1 per cent) or haemorrhagic fever\n(less than 1 per cent). The total case fatality rate has varied widely\nbetween different epidemics but, overall, has been less than 1 per cent in\nthose documented. Most fatalities occur in patients who develop the\nhaemorrhagic icterus form.\n\n\"During an outbreak of RVF, close contact with animals, particularly with\ntheir body fluids, either directly or via aerosols, has been identified as\nthe most significant risk factor for RVF virus infection. In the absence of\nspecific treatment and an effective human vaccine, raising awareness of the\nrisk factors of RVF infection as well as the protective measures\nindividuals can take to prevent mosquito bites, is the only way to reduce\nhuman infection and deaths.\"\n\nA map of the states of Sudan can be accessed at\n<http://www.emro.who.int/sudan/Media/PDF/Sud-states-2006.pdf>.

Cases reported in Khartoum state are not\nindigenous cases but were imported from one of the other affected\nstates. The most rapid increase in human cases has been seen in\nGazeera state, which now accounts for more than half of the human\ncases. The cases being reported in Gazeera state are in an area close\nto irrigation canals and are linked to naturally occurring cycles\ninvolving livestock and mosquitoes which are abundant in the\nirrigation zone.\n\nOn Sun 11 Nov 2007, the Sudanese Federal Ministry of Animal Resources\nand Fisheries reported to the Office International des Epizooties\n(OIE) that Rift Valley fever had been found on 29 Oct 2007 in samples\ntaken from animals in White Nile State. It is anticipated that\nfollowing this declaration, a well-integrated control program for\nlimiting the disease in both human and animal populations will now be\nimplemented.\n\nThe Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations has\ndeployed a senior animal health expert to the country to assist\nveterinary services with prevention and control measures in animals.\nThe Ministry of Health and the WHO Country Office have presented a\nplan for the prevention and control of the disease in humans to\ninternational donors in Khartoum. The WHO Eastern Mediterranean\nRegional Office and WHO headquarters are supporting the national\nresponse, mobilizing epidemiologists and working with partners to\nenhance national laboratory capacity for RVF.\n\nSocial mobilization activities are now underway to alert the local\npopulation to the human health risks associated with this disease in\nanimals. However, more intensive efforts are urgently needed using\nall locally available media -- including television and radio\nchannels -- as well as community and religious leaders to ensure that\nat-risk communities are fully aware of the measures that need to be\ntaken to reduce the risk of human infection.\n\n--\nCommunicated by\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Marianne Hopp\n\n[Since the last WHO report on Thu 8 Nov 2007, the number of human\ncases has risen by 101 and the number of fatalities by 12. The most\nrapid increase in cases is occurring in the eastern state of Gazeera.\nA map of Sudan showing the location of the adjacent states of White\nNile, Sennar, and Gazeera, south of the capital Khartoum, is\navailable at\n<http://www.rightsmaps.com/html/sudmap1.html>,\nand the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map of Sudan can be accessed at\n<http://healthmap.org/promed?v=13.8,30,5>.\n\nThe extent of the outbreak of Rift Valley fever in livestock in the\nCentral/Eastern states of Sudan remains confused and unclear, as\ndiscussed in detail in ProMED-mail posts: Rift Valley fever, bovine,\novine - Sudan: (West Nile), OIE 20071114.3694 and Rift Valley fever -\nSudan (05): animal involvement 20071111.3663.

We hope\nit is an isolated case,\" Sulaiman said.\n\"Some vaccines have been sent to Dhi Qar Governorate this morning,\nand we have contacted companies to get more supplies, which should\narrive within a couple of days,\" he added. \"We are seriously\nconcerned about the possibility that the disease might spread,\" Dhi\nQar provincial council spokesman Rayhan said, adding that affected\nlivestock farmers have been asked to confine their animals within a 2\nsq km area until more specialised laboratory tests can be carried out\nin Baghdad.\nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO), RVF affects\nlivestock (including cattle, buffalo, sheep, goats and camels) as\nwell as humans. The disease mostly appears in Africa.\nPeople get RVF mainly from infected mosquitoes, which act as vectors.\nThe disease can also be spread by contact with the blood or body\nfluids of an infected animal. \"Our concern is that with the situation\nas it is in Iraq -- with increased poverty, displacement and pools of\nstagnant water -- people might get infected by mosquito bites,\" said Rayhan.\nKhalid Idris, a veterinary specialist in Nassiriyah who has been\ndealing with the problem, told IRIN that livestock in the\ncontaminated farms must be vaccinated as a matter of urgency. \"All\nsheep, cattle and buffalo in herds within the infected area should be\nvaccinated immediately with an inactivated RVF vaccine and\nrevaccinated after 2 to 4 weeks. But these vaccines have not been\navailable in Iraq since before the US-led invasion in 2003,\" Idris said.\nThe UN Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) said it had not\nreceived any details of the outbreak but that it was in touch with\nthe Ministry of Agriculture.\nIn July 2001, the FAO said RVF had been detected among livestock in\nYemen and Saudi Arabia and warned of the possibility of the disease\nspreading into Iraq. No case was confirmed then, but, since that\ntime, farmers have been advised to vaccinate their livestock\nperiodically, a procedure that, according to Idris, has not taken\nplace in Dhi Qar since February 2002. \"We are urging international\norganisations and the central government to find quick solutions to\nthe problem,\" Idris said.\nThe RVF virus can cause several different syndromes. People who are\ninfected with RVF either show no symptoms or develop a mild fever and\nliver abnormalities. However, in some patients, the illness can\nprogress to haemorrhagic fever (which can lead to shock or\nhaemorrhage), encephalitis (inflammation of the brain, which can lead\nto headaches, coma, or seizures), or ocular diseases.\nPatients who become ill usually experience fever, generalised\nweakness, back pain, dizziness, and extreme weight loss at the onset\nof the illness. Normally, RVF patients recover within 2 days to one\nweek after catching the illness.\n--\nCommunicated by:\nOtavio da Silva <otavio_uff104@yahoo.com.br>\n[In the absence of details on the symptoms allegedly observed in the\ncattle and sheep, and of the diagnostic tests applied and their\nspecificity, it is difficult to assess the significance of the above\nsuspicions. In previous RVF cases in the Middle East, cases in humans\npreceded the reporting of animal disease.\nRVF has never been diagnosed in Iraq; the only countries in the Near\nEast which have been affected by RVF in the past are Egypt, Yemen and\nSaudi Arabia. During the late 1970's, RVF was reportedly suspected in\nEgyptian laborers residing in Iraq, but their eventual diagnosis was\nCongo-Crimean Haemorrhagic fever.\nThe clinical signs of RVF in animals vary with the age, species and\nbreed of the animal. In endemic regions, epidemics of Rift Valley\nfever can be recognized by high mortality rates in newborn animals\nand abortions in adults. In lambs, a biphasic fever, anorexia and\nlymphadenopathy may be followed by weakness and death within 36\nhours. Hemorrhagic diarrhea or abdominal pain can also be seen. The\nyoungest animals are most severely affected. In neonates, the\nmortality rate may reach 90 to 100 percent. However, no ovine\nneonates are expected yet in southern Iraq, where lambing is\nanticipated to commence not earlier than the end November 2007.\nSimilar symptoms occur in young calves: fever, anorexia and\ndepression are typical, with mortality rates of 10 to 70 percent.\nAbortions are the most characteristic sign in adult sheep and cattle.\nOther symptoms that may occur in adult sheep include fever, weakness,\na mucopurulent nasal discharge (sometimes bloodstained), melena,\nhemorrhagic or foul-smelling diarrhea, and vomiting. In adult cattle,\nfever, anorexia, weakness, excessive salivation, fetid diarrhea and\ndecreased milk production have been reported. Icterus may also be\nseen, particularly in cattle.\nSimilar but milder infections occur in goats. Adult camels do not\ndevelop symptoms other than abortion, but young animals may have more\nsevere disease.\nFor further details, see\n<http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/rift_valley_fever.pdf>.\nAn extensive epizootic of RVF spread earlier this year [2007] in\neastern Africa and the Horn of Africa.\nFurther details, particularly confirmation (or otherwise) of the\ndiagnosis by a reference laboratory, are soon anticipated.

We hope\nit is an isolated case,\" Sulaiman said.\n\"Some vaccines have been sent to Dhi Qar Governorate this morning,\nand we have contacted companies to get more supplies, which should\narrive within a couple of days,\" he added. \"We are seriously\nconcerned about the possibility that the disease might spread,\" Dhi\nQar provincial council spokesman Rayhan said, adding that affected\nlivestock farmers have been asked to confine their animals within a 2\nsq km area until more specialised laboratory tests can be carried out\nin Baghdad.\nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO), RVF affects\nlivestock (including cattle, buffalo, sheep, goats and camels) as\nwell as humans. The disease mostly appears in Africa.\nPeople get RVF mainly from infected mosquitoes, which act as vectors.\nThe disease can also be spread by contact with the blood or body\nfluids of an infected animal. \"Our concern is that with the situation\nas it is in Iraq -- with increased poverty, displacement and pools of\nstagnant water -- people might get infected by mosquito bites,\" said Rayhan.\nKhalid Idris, a veterinary specialist in Nassiriyah who has been\ndealing with the problem, told IRIN that livestock in the\ncontaminated farms must be vaccinated as a matter of urgency. \"All\nsheep, cattle and buffalo in herds within the infected area should be\nvaccinated immediately with an inactivated RVF vaccine and\nrevaccinated after 2 to 4 weeks. But these vaccines have not been\navailable in Iraq since before the US-led invasion in 2003,\" Idris said.\nThe UN Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) said it had not\nreceived any details of the outbreak but that it was in touch with\nthe Ministry of Agriculture.\nIn July 2001, the FAO said RVF had been detected among livestock in\nYemen and Saudi Arabia and warned of the possibility of the disease\nspreading into Iraq. No case was confirmed then, but, since that\ntime, farmers have been advised to vaccinate their livestock\nperiodically, a procedure that, according to Idris, has not taken\nplace in Dhi Qar since February 2002. \"We are urging international\norganisations and the central government to find quick solutions to\nthe problem,\" Idris said.\nThe RVF virus can cause several different syndromes. People who are\ninfected with RVF either show no symptoms or develop a mild fever and\nliver abnormalities. However, in some patients, the illness can\nprogress to haemorrhagic fever (which can lead to shock or\nhaemorrhage), encephalitis (inflammation of the brain, which can lead\nto headaches, coma, or seizures), or ocular diseases.\nPatients who become ill usually experience fever, generalised\nweakness, back pain, dizziness, and extreme weight loss at the onset\nof the illness. Normally, RVF patients recover within 2 days to one\nweek after catching the illness.\n--\nCommunicated by:\nOtavio da Silva <otavio_uff104@yahoo.com.br>\n[In the absence of details on the symptoms allegedly observed in the\ncattle and sheep, and of the diagnostic tests applied and their\nspecificity, it is difficult to assess the significance of the above\nsuspicions. In previous RVF cases in the Middle East, cases in humans\npreceded the reporting of animal disease.\nRVF has never been diagnosed in Iraq; the only countries in the Near\nEast which have been affected by RVF in the past are Egypt, Yemen and\nSaudi Arabia. During the late 1970's, RVF was reportedly suspected in\nEgyptian laborers residing in Iraq, but their eventual diagnosis was\nCongo-Crimean Haemorrhagic fever.\nThe clinical signs of RVF in animals vary with the age, species and\nbreed of the animal. In endemic regions, epidemics of Rift Valley\nfever can be recognized by high mortality rates in newborn animals\nand abortions in adults. In lambs, a biphasic fever, anorexia and\nlymphadenopathy may be followed by weakness and death within 36\nhours. Hemorrhagic diarrhea or abdominal pain can also be seen. The\nyoungest animals are most severely affected. In neonates, the\nmortality rate may reach 90 to 100 percent. However, no ovine\nneonates are expected yet in southern Iraq, where lambing is\nanticipated to commence not earlier than the end November 2007.\nSimilar symptoms occur in young calves: fever, anorexia and\ndepression are typical, with mortality rates of 10 to 70 percent.\nAbortions are the most characteristic sign in adult sheep and cattle.\nOther symptoms that may occur in adult sheep include fever, weakness,\na mucopurulent nasal discharge (sometimes bloodstained), melena,\nhemorrhagic or foul-smelling diarrhea, and vomiting. In adult cattle,\nfever, anorexia, weakness, excessive salivation, fetid diarrhea and\ndecreased milk production have been reported. Icterus may also be\nseen, particularly in cattle.\nSimilar but milder infections occur in goats. Adult camels do not\ndevelop symptoms other than abortion, but young animals may have more\nsevere disease.\nFor further details, see\n<http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/rift_valley_fever.pdf>.\nAn extensive epizootic of RVF spread earlier this year [2007] in\neastern Africa and the Horn of Africa.\nFurther details, particularly confirmation (or otherwise) of the\ndiagnosis by a reference laboratory, are soon anticipated.

We hope\nit is an isolated case,\" Sulaiman said.\n\"Some vaccines have been sent to Dhi Qar Governorate this morning,\nand we have contacted companies to get more supplies, which should\narrive within a couple of days,\" he added. \"We are seriously\nconcerned about the possibility that the disease might spread,\" Dhi\nQar provincial council spokesman Rayhan said, adding that affected\nlivestock farmers have been asked to confine their animals within a 2\nsq km area until more specialised laboratory tests can be carried out\nin Baghdad.\nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO), RVF affects\nlivestock (including cattle, buffalo, sheep, goats and camels) as\nwell as humans. The disease mostly appears in Africa.\nPeople get RVF mainly from infected mosquitoes, which act as vectors.\nThe disease can also be spread by contact with the blood or body\nfluids of an infected animal. \"Our concern is that with the situation\nas it is in Iraq -- with increased poverty, displacement and pools of\nstagnant water -- people might get infected by mosquito bites,\" said Rayhan.\nKhalid Idris, a veterinary specialist in Nassiriyah who has been\ndealing with the problem, told IRIN that livestock in the\ncontaminated farms must be vaccinated as a matter of urgency. \"All\nsheep, cattle and buffalo in herds within the infected area should be\nvaccinated immediately with an inactivated RVF vaccine and\nrevaccinated after 2 to 4 weeks. But these vaccines have not been\navailable in Iraq since before the US-led invasion in 2003,\" Idris said.\nThe UN Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) said it had not\nreceived any details of the outbreak but that it was in touch with\nthe Ministry of Agriculture.\nIn July 2001, the FAO said RVF had been detected among livestock in\nYemen and Saudi Arabia and warned of the possibility of the disease\nspreading into Iraq. No case was confirmed then, but, since that\ntime, farmers have been advised to vaccinate their livestock\nperiodically, a procedure that, according to Idris, has not taken\nplace in Dhi Qar since February 2002. \"We are urging international\norganisations and the central government to find quick solutions to\nthe problem,\" Idris said.\nThe RVF virus can cause several different syndromes. People who are\ninfected with RVF either show no symptoms or develop a mild fever and\nliver abnormalities. However, in some patients, the illness can\nprogress to haemorrhagic fever (which can lead to shock or\nhaemorrhage), encephalitis (inflammation of the brain, which can lead\nto headaches, coma, or seizures), or ocular diseases.\nPatients who become ill usually experience fever, generalised\nweakness, back pain, dizziness, and extreme weight loss at the onset\nof the illness. Normally, RVF patients recover within 2 days to one\nweek after catching the illness.\n--\nCommunicated by:\nOtavio da Silva <otavio_uff104@yahoo.com.br>\n[In the absence of details on the symptoms allegedly observed in the\ncattle and sheep, and of the diagnostic tests applied and their\nspecificity, it is difficult to assess the significance of the above\nsuspicions. In previous RVF cases in the Middle East, cases in humans\npreceded the reporting of animal disease.\nRVF has never been diagnosed in Iraq; the only countries in the Near\nEast which have been affected by RVF in the past are Egypt, Yemen and\nSaudi Arabia. During the late 1970's, RVF was reportedly suspected in\nEgyptian laborers residing in Iraq, but their eventual diagnosis was\nCongo-Crimean Haemorrhagic fever.\nThe clinical signs of RVF in animals vary with the age, species and\nbreed of the animal. In endemic regions, epidemics of Rift Valley\nfever can be recognized by high mortality rates in newborn animals\nand abortions in adults. In lambs, a biphasic fever, anorexia and\nlymphadenopathy may be followed by weakness and death within 36\nhours. Hemorrhagic diarrhea or abdominal pain can also be seen. The\nyoungest animals are most severely affected. In neonates, the\nmortality rate may reach 90 to 100 percent. However, no ovine\nneonates are expected yet in southern Iraq, where lambing is\nanticipated to commence not earlier than the end November 2007.\nSimilar symptoms occur in young calves: fever, anorexia and\ndepression are typical, with mortality rates of 10 to 70 percent.\nAbortions are the most characteristic sign in adult sheep and cattle.\nOther symptoms that may occur in adult sheep include fever, weakness,\na mucopurulent nasal discharge (sometimes bloodstained), melena,\nhemorrhagic or foul-smelling diarrhea, and vomiting. In adult cattle,\nfever, anorexia, weakness, excessive salivation, fetid diarrhea and\ndecreased milk production have been reported. Icterus may also be\nseen, particularly in cattle.\nSimilar but milder infections occur in goats. Adult camels do not\ndevelop symptoms other than abortion, but young animals may have more\nsevere disease.\nFor further details, see\n<http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/rift_valley_fever.pdf>.\nAn extensive epizootic of RVF spread earlier this year [2007] in\neastern Africa and the Horn of Africa.\nFurther details, particularly confirmation (or otherwise) of the\ndiagnosis by a reference laboratory, are soon anticipated.

At no time, did I nor anyone else, see wild animals grazing\nRVFV infected areas with affected cattle, show any clinical disease, which\nmight have been due to RVFV.\"\nRecent coverage of RVF in the animal domain leaves room for improvement.\nWhile humans have been reported to be sick and dying of RVF in Kenya since\nthe beginning of December 2006, the 1st official notification on cases in\nanimals (sheep, goats, cattle, and camels), which reportedly had started on\n4 Dec 2006, were submitted to the Office International des Epizooties (OIE;\nWorld Organisation for Animal Health) from Kenya on 9 Jan 2007; see\nnotification, including map, at\n<http://www.oie.int/wahid-prod/public.php?page=single_report&pop=1&reportid=4487>.\nHuman cases in Somalia were initially reported on 12 Jan 2007, following\nrumors of abortions in cattle, which have, so far, not been confirmed -- by\nlaboratory tests -- to be related to RVF.\nTanzania reported outbreaks in sheep, goats, and cattle on 12 Feb 2007,\nreportedly having started on18 Jan 2007; see notification, including map,\nat\n<http://www.oie.int/wahid-prod/public.php?page=single_report&pop=1&reportid=4782>.\nThe 1st human cases were reported from Tanzania at the beginning of\nFebruary 2007, so far without WHO confirmation. For background and past\nexperience, see also Dr Peter Roeder's contribution in ProMED-mail posting\nRift valley fever - Eastern Africa: Somalia, Kenya 20070112.0164.\nDomestic ruminants, namely sheep followed by goats and cattle, are known to\ndemonstrate high susceptibility, manifested by mass abortions while\nmortality in young lambs and kids expected to reach nearly 100 per cent.\nA detailed, useful review of RVF in humans and animals is available at\n<http://www.fao.org/ag/AGAinfo/subjects/en/health/diseases-cards/rvf.html>.\n- Mod.AS]\n******\n[2]\nDate: Sat 3 Mar 2007\nFrom: Joseph Dudley <jdudley@eaicorp.com>\nSource: Allafrica.com, Arusha Times [edited]\n<http://allafrica.com/stories/200703040119.html>\n\nDistribution of vaccines against the Rift Valley Fever (RVF) has started in\ninfected areas according to the minister for livestock development, Mr\nAnthony Diallo.\nThe 1st batch of vaccines against the deadly disease arrived from South\nAfrica last Friday [2 Mar 2007]. The vaccine is administered to livestock.\nAbout 500 000 doses, were ordered by the government 2 weeks ago and were\nimmediately dispatched for distribution in affected areas -- Arusha,\nManyara, Kilimanjaro, Morogoro, and Tanga regions. \"The distribution of the\nvaccines has already started and we want to see it speeded up,\" Mr Diallo\ntold reporters.\nOfficials and experts have urged inhabitants of Arusha to handle and\nprepare carefully meat and other animal products before eating them. Meat\nand milk should not be consumed raw or half done. Signs and symptoms of RVF\n[in humans] include flue-like illness with fever, weakness, back pain,\ndizziness, and weight loss. Diagnosis can be made by laboratory tests.\n--\nJoseph P Dudley, PhD\nChief Scientist\nEAI Corporation\nRockville MD 20852\n<jdudley@eaicorp.com>\n[Timely livestock vaccination will reduce economical losses of breeders; it\ncan also be an effective means of preventing cases of human RVF, if\nadequate vaccination coverage and herd immunity are achieved.\nThe vaccine obtained by Tanzania from South Africa is probably commercial\nlive-attenuated (Smithburn) vaccine produced in Onderstepoort. This vaccine\nwill confer protecting antibody levels within a relatively short period but\nis known to be abortogenic. Should pregnant animals be vaccinated,\nsubsequent abortions might cause reluctance of herders to vaccinate or to\ncooperate with the vaccinators. Directions for use are available at\n<http://bigfive.jl.co.za/pdf_files/p2153.pdf>.\nThe safer, inactivated, vaccine requires booster vaccinations and is more\nlaborious and expensive. This is the vaccine of choice in non-endemic\nsituations (RVF-free countries/regions) and prior to the commencement of\noutbreaks in endemic regions.

The reported results fall in line with Dr Glyn\nDavies' comments, included in ProMED-mail posting Rift Valley fever -\nEastern Africa (19): wildlife, susp 20070304.0753: \"I spent a great deal of\ntime during RVFV (Rift Valley fever virus) epizootic periods in Kenya\nobserving the wild ruminants on properties affected by RVFV in domestic\nanimals and also communicating with cattle and sheep farmers on RVF\naffected farms. At no time, did I nor anyone else, see wild animals grazing\nRVFV infected areas with affected cattle, show any clinical disease, which\nmight have been due to RVFV.\"\nRecent coverage of RVF in the animal domain leaves room for improvement.\nWhile humans have been reported to be sick and dying of RVF in Kenya since\nthe beginning of December 2006, the 1st official notification on cases in\nanimals (sheep, goats, cattle, and camels), which reportedly had started on\n4 Dec 2006, were submitted to the Office International des Epizooties (OIE;\nWorld Organisation for Animal Health) from Kenya on 9 Jan 2007; see\nnotification, including map, at\n<http://www.oie.int/wahid-prod/public.php?page=single_report&pop=1&reportid=4487>.\nHuman cases in Somalia were initially reported on 12 Jan 2007, following\nrumors of abortions in cattle, which have, so far, not been confirmed -- by\nlaboratory tests -- to be related to RVF.\nTanzania reported outbreaks in sheep, goats, and cattle on 12 Feb 2007,\nreportedly having started on18 Jan 2007; see notification, including map,\nat\n<http://www.oie.int/wahid-prod/public.php?page=single_report&pop=1&reportid=4782>.\nThe 1st human cases were reported from Tanzania at the beginning of\nFebruary 2007, so far without WHO confirmation. For background and past\nexperience, see also Dr Peter Roeder's contribution in ProMED-mail posting\nRift valley fever - Eastern Africa: Somalia, Kenya 20070112.0164.\nDomestic ruminants, namely sheep followed by goats and cattle, are known to\ndemonstrate high susceptibility, manifested by mass abortions while\nmortality in young lambs and kids expected to reach nearly 100 per cent.\nA detailed, useful review of RVF in humans and animals is available at\n<http://www.fao.org/ag/AGAinfo/subjects/en/health/diseases-cards/rvf.html>.\n- Mod.AS]\n******\n[2]\nDate: Sat 3 Mar 2007\nFrom: Joseph Dudley <jdudley@eaicorp.com>\nSource: Allafrica.com, Arusha Times [edited]\n<http://allafrica.com/stories/200703040119.html>\n\nDistribution of vaccines against the Rift Valley Fever (RVF) has started in\ninfected areas according to the minister for livestock development, Mr\nAnthony Diallo.\nThe 1st batch of vaccines against the deadly disease arrived from South\nAfrica last Friday [2 Mar 2007]. The vaccine is administered to livestock.\nAbout 500 000 doses, were ordered by the government 2 weeks ago and were\nimmediately dispatched for distribution in affected areas -- Arusha,\nManyara, Kilimanjaro, Morogoro, and Tanga regions. \"The distribution of the\nvaccines has already started and we want to see it speeded up,\" Mr Diallo\ntold reporters.\nOfficials and experts have urged inhabitants of Arusha to handle and\nprepare carefully meat and other animal products before eating them. Meat\nand milk should not be consumed raw or half done. Signs and symptoms of RVF\n[in humans] include flue-like illness with fever, weakness, back pain,\ndizziness, and weight loss. Diagnosis can be made by laboratory tests.\n--\nJoseph P Dudley, PhD\nChief Scientist\nEAI Corporation\nRockville MD 20852\n<jdudley@eaicorp.com>\n[Timely livestock vaccination will reduce economical losses of breeders; it\ncan also be an effective means of preventing cases of human RVF, if\nadequate vaccination coverage and herd immunity are achieved.\nThe vaccine obtained by Tanzania from South Africa is probably commercial\nlive-attenuated (Smithburn) vaccine produced in Onderstepoort. This vaccine\nwill confer protecting antibody levels within a relatively short period but\nis known to be abortogenic. Should pregnant animals be vaccinated,\nsubsequent abortions might cause reluctance of herders to vaccinate or to\ncooperate with the vaccinators. Directions for use are available at\n<http://bigfive.jl.co.za/pdf_files/p2153.pdf>.\nThe safer, inactivated, vaccine requires booster vaccinations and is more\nlaborious and expensive. This is the vaccine of choice in non-endemic\nsituations (RVF-free countries/regions) and prior to the commencement of\noutbreaks in endemic regions.

Eleven died in Marigat, Baringo District, while 5 others\ndied in Taita, Taveta and Maragua districts, veterinary officers said on\nFri 2 Feb 2007. This brings the death toll from the disease to 150 since\nthe 1st case was reported in North-Eastern Province in January 2007.\nPanic gripped Baringo residents as more people succumbed to the disease and\nseveral patients were admitted to hospital. Veterinary officers have\nimposed quarantine and ordered all butcheries closed after 2 more people\ndied on Thursday night.

Randall said a\nStandard Five pupil died while undergoing treatment at the Moi Teaching and\nReferral Hospital while a middle-aged woman died at home.\nNgambo location chief, Mr Joseph Lenasheku, said many people were unable to\nreach hospital due to heavy rains that rendered roads impassable. The body\nof a 32-year-old woman, who died after feasting on meat from a dead sheep,\ncould not be taken to the mortuary due to the bad state of the roads.\nIn Nakuru, butcheries continued to suffer losses as residents avoided meat\nfearing to contract Rift Valley fever. The manager of Gilanis Butchery, Mr\nS A Haji said sales have since gone down. However, he assured his customers\nthat the meat was inspected and stamped by certified Government officers.\nMr Samson Keitany, a supervisor with Hygienic Butchery, said business had\nbeen bad in the last 2 weeks. Keitany said he reduced his order to one cow\na week from 3. Gladys Njeri of Village Park Butchery said she reduced her\norders to 2 goats per day from 5. Butchers urged the Government to step up\nvaccination and public awareness campaigns.\nIn Taita Taveta, 2 more people have succumbed to the disease. Two other\npeople are fighting for their lives at Taveta District Hospital. Those who\ndied included a Maasai herdsman and a woman at Salaita village in Taveta\ndivision. Last month a Somali herdsman died at Kuranze Ranch in Voi\ndivision. The Taita Taveta District medical officer of health, Dr Shem\nPatta, said the victims died of a disease with symptoms similar to Rift\nValley fever. Dr Patta said one of those who died was treated in Tanzania\nbut died on return. The MOH said goats and cows were reportedly dying of an\nunidentified disease. Patta said samples had been taken to KEMRI for\nanalysis. He said unrestricted movement in Taita could fan the rapid spread\nof the disease. \"We have set up an isolation ward in all public health\nfacilities, equipped workers with protective gear, and notified them of the\nlatest outbreak,\" said Dr Patta.

Eleven died in Marigat, Baringo District, while 5 others\ndied in Taita, Taveta and Maragua districts, veterinary officers said on\nFri 2 Feb 2007. This brings the death toll from the disease to 150 since\nthe 1st case was reported in North-Eastern Province in January 2007.\nPanic gripped Baringo residents as more people succumbed to the disease and\nseveral patients were admitted to hospital. Veterinary officers have\nimposed quarantine and ordered all butcheries closed after 2 more people\ndied on Thursday night. Villagers said 11 people had died even as\nveterinary officers insisted it was 6.\nAn estimated 300 goats and sheep have died of a mysterious disease linked\nto the spread of [Rift Valley fever] in the past week.\nThe clinical officer in charge of Marigat Sub-district Hospital, Rahab\nRandall, said 4 people have died in the last week. \"We have confirmed 4\ndeaths arising from the disease after samples we sent to the Kenya Medical\nResearch Institute (KEMRI) tested positive,\" said Randall. Randall said a\nStandard Five pupil died while undergoing treatment at the Moi Teaching and\nReferral Hospital while a middle-aged woman died at home.\nNgambo location chief, Mr Joseph Lenasheku, said many people were unable to\nreach hospital due to heavy rains that rendered roads impassable. The body\nof a 32-year-old woman, who died after feasting on meat from a dead sheep,\ncould not be taken to the mortuary due to the bad state of the roads.\nIn Nakuru, butcheries continued to suffer losses as residents avoided meat\nfearing to contract Rift Valley fever. The manager of Gilanis Butchery, Mr\nS A Haji said sales have since gone down. However, he assured his customers\nthat the meat was inspected and stamped by certified Government officers.\nMr Samson Keitany, a supervisor with Hygienic Butchery, said business had\nbeen bad in the last 2 weeks. Keitany said he reduced his order to one cow\na week from 3. Gladys Njeri of Village Park Butchery said she reduced her\norders to 2 goats per day from 5. Butchers urged the Government to step up\nvaccination and public awareness campaigns.\nIn Taita Taveta, 2 more people have succumbed to the disease. Two other\npeople are fighting for their lives at Taveta District Hospital. Those who\ndied included a Maasai herdsman and a woman at Salaita village in Taveta\ndivision. Last month a Somali herdsman died at Kuranze Ranch in Voi\ndivision. The Taita Taveta District medical officer of health, Dr Shem\nPatta, said the victims died of a disease with symptoms similar to Rift\nValley fever. Dr Patta said one of those who died was treated in Tanzania\nbut died on return. The MOH said goats and cows were reportedly dying of an\nunidentified disease. Patta said samples had been taken to KEMRI for\nanalysis. He said unrestricted movement in Taita could fan the rapid spread\nof the disease. \"We have set up an isolation ward in all public health\nfacilities, equipped workers with protective gear, and notified them of the\nlatest outbreak,\" said Dr Patta. He said the Government is educating the\npublic on the disease.\nThe District veterinary officer, Dr Julius Nkanata, said several animals\nhave died of an unidentified disease in the area. Samples have been taken\nto Nairobi for tests.\nIn Maragua 3 more cases of the deadly fever have been reported. The Senior\nDeputy Director of Medical Services, Mr Shanaz Sharif, said the samples\ntaken to KEMRI tested positive while those taken to Kirinyaga District\nHospital tested negative.\n[Byline: Peter Mutai And Winnie Chumo]\n--\nJoseph P.

The diagnosis was\nconfirmed as Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) infection by specific IgM\n[assay] and PCR [amplification]. After the first cases were confirmed the\nMinistry of Health (MOH), Centre for Disease Control (CDC) and the World\nHealth Organization sent a team to investigate and put in place control\nmeasures to stop the spread of the disease.\nPreliminary data show that 71 percent of all cases admitted with RVF were\nmales and 29 percent were females. Patients less then 20 years comprised\nless then 3 percent. The age of male patients was 28 years while the mean\nage of female patients was 33 years. The attack rate for Garissa district\nwas 19 per 100 000 people and the highest attack rate was in Shanta Abak at\n129 cases per 100 000. The first cases were reported from Shanta Abak.\nThe commonest presenting features were fever, headache, muscle pains and\njoint pains. The patients with severe disease had a bleeding tendency such\nas hemetemesis, bleeding from the nose and gums. A total of 86 percent of\nthe patients interviewed said that they drank raw milk and 71 percent said\nthat they had drunk milk from a sick animal 2 weeks before onset of\nsymptoms. Most patients lived near a swampy area. In all, 71 percent of\npatients had sick animals in their herds and 60 percent had lost an animal\ndue to disease 2 weeks prior to onset of symptoms; 53 percent had\nslaughtered a sick animal while 53 percent reported they had eaten meat\nfrom either a sick or a dead animal. Fifty-one percent of patients were\nusing a [mosquito] net.\nCases have now been reported from other parts of North Eastern Province\nsuch as Ijara, Garissa and also in 2 districts of Coast Province (Tana\nRiver and Kilifi District). Cumulative figures as of 5 Jan 2007 are 188\ncases with 68 deaths.\nThe Government has imposed a quarantine for animals in North Eastern\nProvince and also imposed a ban on slaughtering animals at home. The\nMinistry of Health with CDC, WHO, UNICEF and the Red Cross have mounted an\nintensive health education program using electronic media, religious\nleaders and health workers to tell people to avoid contact with sick\nanimals, to stop drinking raw milk and to stop eating meat from sick or\ndead animals. It has started distributing insecticide treated nets and\nindoor residual spraying and larviciding stagnant pools of water.\n--\nDr. S. K.

One of the patients died, taking the\ndeath toll to at least 67 since the outbreak began on 7 Dec 2006. MSF\nstarted battling the outbreak on 22 Dec 2006 when teams began work in the\ntown of Garissa, setting up facilities to care for patients in the hospital\nin which 23 people had been treated for their Rift Valley fever infection.\nToday, MSF teams are working in Garissa, Ijara and Tano River providing\ninformation, trying to locate infected people and treating patients.\nRift Valley fever is a rare viral disease of which very little is known.\nTransmitted primarily to humans through contact with infected animal\nmatter, such as blood or other fluids, or organs, it is also spread from\nlivestock via _Aedes_ mosquitoes. Consumption of raw milk, an important\nelement in the diet of many nomadic pastoralists of the area, is also\nthought to lead to infection.\nThe epidemic has been triggered by extensive flooding in the region. [A map\nof the flooded areas of Kenya, where conditions may be favorable for the\nspread of Rift Valley fever, is available at:\n<http://www.reliefweb.int/rw/fullMaps_Af.nsf/luFullMap/C1A04D85AE229930852572290055544F/$File/ocha_FL_hoa061116.pdf?OpenElement>.\n- Mod.CP]\nThe infected mosquito eggs are often laid around river banks and can lay\ndormant for years until they get submerged. Once covered with water, the\neggs become infected mosquitoes which spread the virus. The last large\noutbreak in the same region was in 1997, also following heavy rains. During\nthat time in Garissa District, around 27 500 were infected and 170 died.\nOnly about one percent of people contracting Rift Valley fever develop the\ndisease in a severe form. But of those who do, around half will die.\n\"The great majority of people infected just suffer from headaches and\ninfluenza-like symptoms reminiscent of malaria,\" explains MSF emergency\ncoordinator Dr Ian Vanenglegem, \"but the severe form, like other\nhaemorrhagic diseases, attacks the liver and can cause the patient to bleed\nfrom every orifice. There is no cure, so we are only able to treat the\nsymptoms.\"\nOne of the biggest challenges of dealing with this outbreak is logistical.\n\"Much of Kenya's North-Eastern Province is not accessible by road because\nof the floods, so the only way we can find patients is to travel by\nhelicopter,\" continues Dr Vanenglegem.

To counter this, MSF teams are undertaking\nawareness-raising activities to increase understanding of what Rift Valley\nfever is and what measures people should take themselves. \"This is an\nimportant concern because it is likely that, with the flood waters being a\nperfect breeding ground for mosquitoes, this outbreak will be followed to\nby high numbers of malaria infections.

Consumption of raw milk, an important\nelement in the diet of many nomadic pastoralists of the area, is also\nthought to lead to infection.\nThe epidemic has been triggered by extensive flooding in the region.

During\nthat time in Garissa District, around 27 500 were infected and 170 died.\nOnly about one percent of people contracting Rift Valley fever develop the\ndisease in a severe form. But of those who do, around half will die.\n\"The great majority of people infected just suffer from headaches and\ninfluenza-like symptoms reminiscent of malaria,\" explains MSF emergency\ncoordinator Dr Ian Vanenglegem, \"but the severe form, like other\nhaemorrhagic diseases, attacks the liver and can cause the patient to bleed\nfrom every orifice. There is no cure, so we are only able to treat the\nsymptoms.\"\nOne of the biggest challenges of dealing with this outbreak is logistical.\n\"Much of Kenya's North-Eastern Province is not accessible by road because\nof the floods, so the only way we can find patients is to travel by\nhelicopter,\" continues Dr Vanenglegem.

K. Sharif <sksharif@africaonline.co.ke>\n\nUpdate: Preliminary epidemiological data\n----------------------------------------\nThe outbreak of Rift Valley Fever in humans was first confirmed from cases\npresenting with fever, headache, myalgia and hemetemis in patients admitted\nto Provincial General Hospital, Garissa on 23 Dec 2006. The diagnosis was\nconfirmed as Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) infection by specific IgM\n[assay] and PCR [amplification]. After the first cases were confirmed the\nMinistry of Health (MOH), Centre for Disease Control (CDC) and the World\nHealth Organization sent a team to investigate and put in place control\nmeasures to stop the spread of the disease.\nPreliminary data show that 71 percent of all cases admitted with RVF were\nmales and 29 percent were females. Patients less then 20 years comprised\nless then 3 percent. The age of male patients was 28 years while the mean\nage of female patients was 33 years. The attack rate for Garissa district\nwas 19 per 100 000 people and the highest attack rate was in Shanta Abak at\n129 cases per 100 000. The first cases were reported from Shanta Abak.\nThe commonest presenting features were fever, headache, muscle pains and\njoint pains. The patients with severe disease had a bleeding tendency such\nas hemetemesis, bleeding from the nose and gums. A total of 86 percent of\nthe patients interviewed said that they drank raw milk and 71 percent said\nthat they had drunk milk from a sick animal 2 weeks before onset of\nsymptoms. Most patients lived near a swampy area. In all, 71 percent of\npatients had sick animals in their herds and 60 percent had lost an animal\ndue to disease 2 weeks prior to onset of symptoms; 53 percent had\nslaughtered a sick animal while 53 percent reported they had eaten meat\nfrom either a sick or a dead animal. Fifty-one percent of patients were\nusing a [mosquito] net.\nCases have now been reported from other parts of North Eastern Province\nsuch as Ijara, Garissa and also in 2 districts of Coast Province (Tana\nRiver and Kilifi District). Cumulative figures as of 5 Jan 2007 are 188\ncases with 68 deaths.\nThe Government has imposed a quarantine for animals in North Eastern\nProvince and also imposed a ban on slaughtering animals at home. The\nMinistry of Health with CDC, WHO, UNICEF and the Red Cross have mounted an\nintensive health education program using electronic media, religious\nleaders and health workers to tell people to avoid contact with sick\nanimals, to stop drinking raw milk and to stop eating meat from sick or\ndead animals. It has started distributing insecticide treated nets and\nindoor residual spraying and larviciding stagnant pools of water.\n--\nDr. S. K. Sharif\n<sksharif@africaonline.co.ke>\n******\n[2]\nDate: Sat 6 Jan 2007\nFrom: Mary Marshall <tropical.forestry@btinternet.com>\nSource: Reuters Foundation AlertNet, ex MSF Belgium [edited]\n<http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/fromthefield/msfbelgium/116801382768.htm>\n\nOn [Thu] 4 Jan 2007, 8 new suspected cases of Rift Valley fever were\ndiscovered by Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) teams in the Ijara District in\nthe North-Eastern Province of Kenya. One of the patients died, taking the\ndeath toll to at least 67 since the outbreak began on 7 Dec 2006. MSF\nstarted battling the outbreak on 22 Dec 2006 when teams began work in the\ntown of Garissa, setting up facilities to care for patients in the hospital\nin which 23 people had been treated for their Rift Valley fever infection.\nToday, MSF teams are working in Garissa, Ijara and Tano River providing\ninformation, trying to locate infected people and treating patients.\nRift Valley fever is a rare viral disease of which very little is known.\nTransmitted primarily to humans through contact with infected animal\nmatter, such as blood or other fluids, or organs, it is also spread from\nlivestock via _Aedes_ mosquitoes. Consumption of raw milk, an important\nelement in the diet of many nomadic pastoralists of the area, is also\nthought to lead to infection.\nThe epidemic has been triggered by extensive flooding in the region. [A map\nof the flooded areas of Kenya, where conditions may be favorable for the\nspread of Rift Valley fever, is available at:\n<http://www.reliefweb.int/rw/fullMaps_Af.nsf/luFullMap/C1A04D85AE229930852572290055544F/$File/ocha_FL_hoa061116.pdf?OpenElement>.\n- Mod.CP]\nThe infected mosquito eggs are often laid around river banks and can lay\ndormant for years until they get submerged. Once covered with water, the\neggs become infected mosquitoes which spread the virus. The last large\noutbreak in the same region was in 1997, also following heavy rains. During\nthat time in Garissa District, around 27 500 were infected and 170 died.\nOnly about one percent of people contracting Rift Valley fever develop the\ndisease in a severe form. But of those who do, around half will die.\n\"The great majority of people infected just suffer from headaches and\ninfluenza-like symptoms reminiscent of malaria,\" explains MSF emergency\ncoordinator Dr Ian Vanenglegem, \"but the severe form, like other\nhaemorrhagic diseases, attacks the liver and can cause the patient to bleed\nfrom every orifice. There is no cure, so we are only able to treat the\nsymptoms.\"\nOne of the biggest challenges of dealing with this outbreak is logistical.\n\"Much of Kenya's North-Eastern Province is not accessible by road because\nof the floods, so the only way we can find patients is to travel by\nhelicopter,\" continues Dr Vanenglegem. [An interactive map is available at\n<http://www.alertnet.org/map/index.htm?ct=2&style=2&ex_iso=ET,KE,SO,SD,TZ,UG&pcode>\n- Mod.CP]\n\"Just to reach the Masalani hospital in Ijara can take up to 3 days by\nroad. It is estimated that up to 500 000 people are at risk from infection\nand this population is scattered over a vast area. We are sure that the\nnumber of cases discovered is only the tip of the iceberg.\"\nAnother difficulty is the fear of the outbreak among the population. With\nsuch a high death rate among those contracting the severe form of the\ndisease, many people will see no benefit in making the often long journey\nto a health centre. To counter this, MSF teams are undertaking\nawareness-raising activities to increase understanding of what Rift Valley\nfever is and what measures people should take themselves. \"This is an\nimportant concern because it is likely that, with the flood waters being a\nperfect breeding ground for mosquitoes, this outbreak will be followed to\nby high numbers of malaria infections. The initial symptoms may be similar\nto those of Rift Valley fever.

He said the numbers of\nmosquitoes had been brought down as a result of continuous spraying\nof insecticides. \"We have also intensified health awareness campaign\namong the people of Jizan,\" the official said, adding that the\nauthorities had taken precautions to prevent the spread of the\ndisease.\nAgriculture Minister Dr. Fahd Balghaneim reported on Monday that 5\nanimals in Jizan (4 in Abu Areesh and one in Aaridah) tested positive\nfor RVF during periodic examinations. \"These positive results from the\ntests do not mean that the situation in the region has reached\nepidemic proportions,\" Balghaneim said.\nThe minister urged the authorities to be cautious about the RVF\nvirus, which is capable of surviving in the eggs of mosquitoes for a\nlong time and can surface whenever it finds a hospitable environment.\nThe Agriculture Ministry has set up an early warning unit to monitor\nand contain infectious diseases affecting agricultural and animal\nresources in certain regions before they spread to other parts of the\nKingdom.\nRVF primarily affects animals but occasionally causes illness in\nhumans, in whom it leads to high morbidity and mortality.\n[Byline: P.K. Abdul Ghafour]\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[For many years it was thought that RVF infected only people who came\ninto close contact with contaminated animal tissue, while animals\nwere primarily infected by arthropod vectors. Most of the people\ninvolved were farmers, farm laborers, and abattoir personnel. Similar\nobservations were made during the 1977/78 major outbreak in Egypt,\nthough vector transmission there became more significant than before.\nExposure of humans to infected animal tissues may specifically occur\nwhen exposed to blood aerosols during the slaughter of viraemic\nanimals. This was one of the concerns of the Saudi authorities in\n2000, in view of the massive slaughtering of ruminants during the\nMoslem holidays. Such a situation might recur during the coming Eid\nal-Fitr holiday, also called Eid al Zeghir (minor festival). Eid\nal-Fitr marks the end of Ramadan, the Muslim holy month of fasting,\nand is celebrated during the first 3 days of Shawwal, the 10th month\nof the Islamic calendar. During these days, house slaughtering of\nruminants, mainly sheep and goats, is widely practiced, especially in\nrural areas. Eid al-Fitr is due this year on 14-15 November -- a\nseason characterised by intense vector activity in the Near East.\nVector control activities might help, but timely mass vaccination of\nsusceptible ruminants is essential in order to prevent the\nestablishment of RVF in animals and the subsequent public health\nhazard. - Mod.AS]\n[It is not at all clear that this is an outbreak, yet. Dr Madani is quoted as\nsaying \"5 animals in Jizan... tested positive for RVF during periodic\nexaminations.\" This was presumably a serological test for antibody, which the\nanimals concerned -- depending on their ages -- might well have acquired from\nan infection in the 2001 epidemic, or they could have been imported from a\nneighboring country (such as Yemen) suffering from an unrecognised outbreak.\nThe lack of reports of sick or dead animals or abortions in livestock does\nnot suggest that there is a current epizootic, but the Saudi authorities are\nquite right to take preventive action, to protect both their livestock &\nhuman population from the threat. - Mod.JW]\nSee Also\nRift Valley fever - Saudi Arabia (Jizan) (02) 20040908.2504\nRift Valley fever - Saudi Arabia (Jizan): suspected 20040907.2500\n2003\n----\nRift Valley fever - Saudi Arabia: alert 20031016.2612\nRift valley fever, prevention - Saudi Arabia 20031003.2489\nRift Valley fever - Egypt 20030827.2158\n2001\n----\nRift Valley fever - Saudi Arabia (08) 20010517.0964\n..........................arn/pg/jw\n*##########################################################*\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.

Yemen's ambassador\nto Riyadh said he could not confirm the closure.\nThe Saudi health ministry said that 27 people in Saudi Arabia have died of\nthe fever out of a total of 129 who have been stricken with the disease. The\nJizan region was the worst affected with 105 people [affected, the ministry\nsaid.

Larry Penning, MD <bevpenn@fgi.net>\nSource: Yemen Times, Issue 39, Mon 25 Sep 2000 [edited\n\nRift Valley Fever Victim Toll in the Yemen Soars\n-------------------------------------------------\nThe number of the Rift Valley fever victims in Hodeidah has shot up\nfrighteningly during the past week. 95 people have died in the Governorate\nof Hodeidah and the Yemeni-Saudi border areas, especially Harradh\". Sources\nfrom the Governorate of Hodeidah have said that the number of deaths in the\nMoor Valley had approached 60, whereas other places like \"Ubad\", \"Kudmah\",\n\"Zuhair\",\"Mahal Manih\", \"Budilah\", and \" Al Marawidh\" have become completely\ninfected. Other neighboring areas are [now becoming involved in the outbreak.\nThe sources added that hundreds of cattle had [died especially in the\n\"Zuhra\" region, which was extensively affected by the disease. Starting\nfrom today, Mon 25 Sep 2000, it is expected that Saudi airplanes will spray\nchemicals to [control spread the disease in the border region. Meanwhile 50\nground teams, accompanied by Dr. Abdu Alwali Nasher, the minister of health,\nand Mr. Ahmed Salem Al Jabali, minister of Agriculture, [are operating in\nthe same area. Attempts to control the spread of the disease are being\nhampered by high winds which disperse that thousands of mosquitoes that are\nswarming in the region due to humidity and rain.\nOfficial statements until last night [claimed that 24 deaths had occurred,\nwhereas [local sources said hat there had been more than 95 cases [deaths\n?. Until now, a regional belt around the [affected areas has not been\n[established. Some of the citizens of the unaffected areas in \"Zuhra\" and\nothers have complained that they had no [longer any source of income after\nthe death of about two thirds of their cattle. The disease had started\nspreading in districts near Hodeidah. Al-Zuhrah district has been reported\nto be an infected area. The disease had appeared in southern areas of Saudi\nArabia, then moved to Harad, Abss and to Al-Zuhrah.\nA Yemeni medical team, headed by the health director in Hodeidah, and\nanother medical/veterinary team ave been rushed to the area to work [on\ndisease control. About 40 cars sprayed insecticide in areas where\nmosquitoes are found. Official sources say that the disease has claimed the\nlives of 23 persons while other local sources indicate that the number is\nmore than 95. They indicated that most of them had died and were buried\nbefore medical teams arrived in these districts.\nThe Wadi Moor villages are home to more than 150 000 people, all of whom are\nworking in pasturing and sheep trading with neighboring countries. New\nmilitary check-points have been set up in Al-Zuhrah district and neighboring\nvillages to prevent the spread of meat or milk to Hodeidah or neighboring\nmarkets. [The arrival of modern spraying equipment from Saudi Arabia is\nexpected soon.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[There is understandable confusion about the numbers of fatalities and the\nexact extent of the outbreak. - Mod.CP\n..............................cp/es\n*##########################################################*\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.
