Further progress in the\ndevelopment of a reliable diagnostic test was simultaneously announced by\nthe same team.\nUsing a special cell line, the Hong Kong scientists isolated the virus from\nthe lung tissue of a patient who developed pneumonia following contact with\na professor from Guangdong Province in southern China. Both the professor\nand the contact have died. Isolation of the virus now lays the solid\nfoundation for very rapid development of a diagnostic test.\nThe Hong Kong scientists have devised a basic test, relying on the\ntechnique of neutralizing antibodies. In today\u0092s experiments, designed to\ndetermine the accuracy of the test, scientists found that it was able to\ndetect tell-tale antibodies in sera taken from 8 SARS patients. The\nconsistency of these findings indicates that the test is reliably\nidentifying cases of SARS infection.\nThis \"hand-made\" test will now be further developed into a more\nsophisticated diagnostic test. A rapid and reliable diagnostic test for\nSARS is needed urgently to assist the many clinicians who need a tool for\nrapid confirmation of genuine cases. Such a test can also help reassure the\nmany \"worried well\" who are flooding health facilities as international\nconcern about this disease and its rapid spread to new areas continues to\nincrease. Many common and usually self-healing illnesses mimic the symptoms\nof SARS in its early stage.\nWith the virus now isolated, scientists in Hong Kong and elsewhere can move\nforward quickly to characterize the agent, determine its relationship with\nknown viruses, and establish a definitive identity. Results will be shared\namong 11 leading laboratories in a network set up on Mon 17 Mar 2003 by WHO.\nThe virus responsible for SARS is considered by some research groups to be\na member of the well-known Paramyxoviridae family. Yesterday, Canadian\nresearchers released findings suggesting that the metapneumovirus, which\nbelongs to this family, may be the cause. The metapneumovirus was first\ndiscovered by Dutch scientists in June 2001 at a laboratory that is also\nincluded in the new WHO network. At the time of its discovery, the virus\nwas known to cause respiratory disease in humans, including some cases of\npneumonia, but showed a different transmission pattern and was much less\nsevere than the SARS agent. At this point, it cannot be ruled out that an\nentirely different virus from another family may be responsible for the\nSARS outbreak.\nWHO cautions that the race to identify the SARS causative agent is by no\nmeans over. Although the virus has now been isolated, its identity remains\nelusive. Other research groups in the network of collaborating labs are\nproducing hints that the causative agent may belong to another virus family.\nSARS is an emerging disease, first recognized in Asia in mid-February 2003,\nthat has made over 380 people ill on 3 continents and caused severe\npneumonia in a large proportion of patients. A cumulative list of affected\ncountries and numbers of cases and deaths is released each day on the WHO\nwebsite.

Further progress in the\ndevelopment of a reliable diagnostic test was simultaneously announced by\nthe same team.\nUsing a special cell line, the Hong Kong scientists isolated the virus from\nthe lung tissue of a patient who developed pneumonia following contact with\na professor from Guangdong Province in southern China. Both the professor\nand the contact have died. Isolation of the virus now lays the solid\nfoundation for very rapid development of a diagnostic test.\nThe Hong Kong scientists have devised a basic test, relying on the\ntechnique of neutralizing antibodies. In today\u0092s experiments, designed to\ndetermine the accuracy of the test, scientists found that it was able to\ndetect tell-tale antibodies in sera taken from 8 SARS patients. The\nconsistency of these findings indicates that the test is reliably\nidentifying cases of SARS infection.\nThis \"hand-made\" test will now be further developed into a more\nsophisticated diagnostic test. A rapid and reliable diagnostic test for\nSARS is needed urgently to assist the many clinicians who need a tool for\nrapid confirmation of genuine cases. Such a test can also help reassure the\nmany \"worried well\" who are flooding health facilities as international\nconcern about this disease and its rapid spread to new areas continues to\nincrease. Many common and usually self-healing illnesses mimic the symptoms\nof SARS in its early stage.\nWith the virus now isolated, scientists in Hong Kong and elsewhere can move\nforward quickly to characterize the agent, determine its relationship with\nknown viruses, and establish a definitive identity. Results will be shared\namong 11 leading laboratories in a network set up on Mon 17 Mar 2003 by WHO.\nThe virus responsible for SARS is considered by some research groups to be\na member of the well-known Paramyxoviridae family. Yesterday, Canadian\nresearchers released findings suggesting that the metapneumovirus, which\nbelongs to this family, may be the cause. The metapneumovirus was first\ndiscovered by Dutch scientists in June 2001 at a laboratory that is also\nincluded in the new WHO network. At the time of its discovery, the virus\nwas known to cause respiratory disease in humans, including some cases of\npneumonia, but showed a different transmission pattern and was much less\nsevere than the SARS agent. At this point, it cannot be ruled out that an\nentirely different virus from another family may be responsible for the\nSARS outbreak.\nWHO cautions that the race to identify the SARS causative agent is by no\nmeans over. Although the virus has now been isolated, its identity remains\nelusive. Other research groups in the network of collaborating labs are\nproducing hints that the causative agent may belong to another virus family.\nSARS is an emerging disease, first recognized in Asia in mid-February 2003,\nthat has made over 380 people ill on 3 continents and caused severe\npneumonia in a large proportion of patients. A cumulative list of affected\ncountries and numbers of cases and deaths is released each day on the WHO\nwebsite. Today\u0092s data indicate that slightly more than half of currently\nreported cases have occurred in health care workers and medical students.\nThe remaining cases are in family members and other persons in close\ncontact with patients.\nA WHO team of 5 experts is now en route to China to investigate the\npossibility that an outbreak of a disease having similar symptoms and\naffecting similar groups \u00ad- health care workers and close contacts of\npatients -\u00ad may be linked to the current SARS outbreak.\nAs of today, Hong Kong remains the most seriously affected area.\nAuthorities there have reported a total of 222 cases in health care\nworkers, medical students, and family members and hospital visitors who\nhave been in close contact with patients.

It is\nto be hoped that WHO will take the lead in resolving this confusion by\ndistributing clinical material and susceptible cell cultures to all the\nparticipating laboratories as quickly as feasible. - Mod.CP]\nSee Also\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - worldwide (15) 20030322.0707\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - worldwide (14) 20030321.0704\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - worldwide (13) 20030321.0703\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - worldwide (12) 20030321.0702\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - worldwide (11) 20030320.0698\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - worldwide (10) 20030319.0689\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - worldwide (09) 20030319.0688\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - worldwide (08) 20030318.0679\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - worldwide (07) 20030318.0678\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - worldwide (06) 20030318.0677\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - Worldwide (05) 20030317.0669\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - Worldwide (04):comment 20030317.0664\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - Worldwide: alert (03) 20030316.0660\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - Worldwide (02):alert 20030315.0649\nSevere Acute Respiratory Syndrome - Worldwide 20030315.0637\nAcute respiratory syndrome - Canada (Ontario) 20030314.0631\nAcute respiratory syndrome - East Asia 20030314.0630\nAcute respiratory syndrome - China (HK), VietNam (03) 20030313.0624\nAcute respiratory syndrome - China (HK), VietNam (02) 20030313.0623\nAcute respiratory syndrome - China (HK), VietNam 20030312.0602\nUndiagnosed illness - Vietnam (Hanoi): RFI 20030311.0595\nInfluenza, H5N1 human case - China (Hong Kong) (05) 20030228.0500\nPneumonia - China (Guangdong) (07) 20030221.0452\nPneumonia - China (Guangdong) (06) 20030220.0447\nPneumonia - China (Guangdong) (05) 20030220.0446\nPneumonia - China (Guangdong) (04) 20030219.0427\nPneumonia - China (Guangdong) (03) 20030214.0390\nPneumonia - China (Guangdong) (02) 20030211.0369\nPneumonia - China (Guangdong): RFI 20030210.0357\n2002\n---\nMetapneumovirus, children - Finland 20021106.5731\nHuman metapneumovirus - Australia (02) 20020305.3691\nHuman metapneumovirus - Australia 20020302.3663\n2001\n---\nParamyxoviruses, new human pathogen - Netherlands 20010603.1094\n.......................mpp/cp/sh\n*##########################################################*\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.

The finding, announced late last\nnight, was further confirmed by a molecular technique that revealed the\nnucleic acid sequence of the virus.\nAsked if the virus was curable, Tam reiterated that the finding last night\nhad indicated that the current treatment applied to patients suffering from\nthe syndrome, more commonly known as atypical pneumonia, had been the right\nchoice. But he added that they still needed to monitor individual patients'\nreactions before they could conclude that the virus was curable.\nLo Wing-lok, Medical Association president and legislator, said the\nParamyxoviridae family incorporated different viruses that could affect\nhumans and, as such, further studies were needed to establish whether it\nwas a new virus. Earlier it was revealed that at least 6 patients were\nresponsible for spreading the pneumonia in Hong Kong. Health chief Yeoh\nEng-kiong also said that a mainland professor who died in [Hong Kong] SAR\non 4 Mar 2003 was a victim of the atypical pneumonia.\nThe new information from officials indicated the disease had been more\nwidespread in the SAR than originally believed. Yeoh said the pneumonia and\nsuspected cases had now been isolated into 6 \"clusters\". Yeoh again\nstressed the government was not hiding anything. He insisted there was no\nsign of an outbreak at the community level.\n[byline: Matthew Lee and Georgina Lee]\n--\nHenry L Niman, PhD\nDepartment of Bioengineering\nShriners' Burn Center\n51 Blossom Street, Room 422\nBoston, MA 02114 USA\n<henry_niman@hms.harvard.edu>\n[This is the second identification of a paramyovirus-like organism from a\npatient with SARS (see ProMED-mail posting Severe acute respiratory\nsyndrome - worldwide (06) 20030318.0677). The first identification was made\nby investigators in Frankfurt am Main and Hamburg from specimens taken from\na physician from Singapore who had treated some of the earlier cases seen\nin Singapore and was admitted to hospital in Frankfurt, Germany en route\nback to Singapore over the weekend. As mentioned in our earlier posting, it\nis important to confirm these findings and to identify a similar agent from\nother cases of SARS before it can be concluded that this agent is the cause\nof SARS.

[Traditional\nantibiotics have not been shown to be effective against many viral agents.\n- Mod.MPP]\nThe World Health Organization issued a global alert about the illness on\nWednesday, saying that until more is known about the outbreaks, patients\nwith atypical pneumonia who may be related to the outbreaks should be\n\"isolated with barrier nursing techniques.\"\n\"At the same time, WHO recommends that any suspect cases be reported to\nnational health authorities,\" the warning said.\nIn mid-February, the Chinese government reported that 305 cases of atypical\npneumonia had killed five people in Guangdong province.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[More information on these cases would be appreciated. While not confirmed\nthere was some information that the suspected case mentioned in British\nColumbia did have a travel history that included Hong Kong prior to the\nonset of illness. There have now been suspected cases of an acute\nrespiratory syndrome with an associated \"atypical pneumonia\" reported from\nChina (Hong Kong, Guangdong), VietNam, Singapore, Taiwan and now\nCanada.
