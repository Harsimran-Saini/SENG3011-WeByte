Left untreated, serious damage to the liver can result, which can be fatal.\n\nDiagnosis in ACT / 2012 / 2013\nHepatitis B / 106 / 111\nHepatitis C / 147 / 184\n\nJohn Didlick from Hepatitis ACT said there are an estimated 8000 people in the ACT living with viral hepatitis, including 4000 with hepatitis C.\n\n\"We estimate that half are already in what we call the 'liver danger zone',\" he said. \"That's an age point of 40 years of age, at which there's a an increase of liver cirrhosis, liver failure, liver cancer and early death.\"\n\nMr Didlick said there should be greater awareness of the vaccines for hepatitis A and B, and testing for hepatitis needed to be ramped up. \"A diagnosis of hepatitis C, or any other blood-borne virus, can lead to better management, and also the prevention of onward transmission.\"But Mr Didlick said those at risk of hepatitis often do not seek treatment, due to the stigma surrounding the viruses in the community.\n\n\"People living with hepatitis B or hepatitis C are often silenced both by themselves, and by external factors,\" he said. \"We need governments and key public health officials to choose to address the invisibility of viral hepatitis. Not only will that shine a light on a neglected epidemic but it will also encourage affected communities to speak out and seek help.\"\n\nHe said the most marginalised parts of the community were at the greatest risk of contracting the virus. \"The most at risk for hepatitis C are people who inject drugs, have a history of injecting drugs, also people in our prison system.\"\n\nMr Didlick also called on the Federal Government to give patients better access to the latest treatments for the virus. \"There are advanced new hepatitis C medicines in use in other parts of the world right now that are not available here,\" he said. \"We live in a first world country, with a first world health system, so this is an unacceptable situation.\"\n\n[Byline: Jonathon Gul]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The increase in the absolute numbers of newly diagnosed cases of hepatitis B and C in the Capital Territory does not necessarily reflect an increase in newly infected individuals. Both of these hepatitis viruses can cause chronic infection and the newly diagnosed cases may represent cases that have been infected for years but not diagnosed before. This is particularly the case for viral hepatitis type C which is uncommonly diagnosed in the early stage since it is rarely associated with acute jaundice.\n\nThe posting also reflects the current issues relating to the new treatment regimens for hepatitis C which are quite expensive but very effective. The prevention of progressive liver inflammation with the development of liver cirrhosis and its complications including liver cancer, however, can make even a very expensive therapy cost effective. - Mod. LL]\n\n[Another important advantage of effective therapies for hepatitis C, is \"treatment as prevention\" in that elimination of hepatitis C in one individual prevents its onward transmission. - Mod.LM\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/186.]\nSee Also\nHepatitis B & C - Australia: increasing incidence, corr 20131206.2096779\nHepatitis B & C - Australia: increasing incidence 20131110.2048183\nHepatitis C - Australia (02): (AC) prison needle-exchange proposal, comment 20130717.1830676\nHepatitis C - Australia: (AC) prison needle-exchange proposal 20130604.1754883\n2012\n----\nHepatitis B & C - Australia (02): liver cancer increase, vaccination 20120912.1291534\nHepatitis B & C - Australia: liver cancer increase 20120910.1288861\n.................................................ll/lm", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "hepatitis a", "hepatitis b", "hepatitis c"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2013-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00"], "locations": []}]}, {"archive_id": "2813150", "headline": "PRO/EDR> Hepatitis B - India: (BR)", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=2813150", "date": "2013-11-10 22:02:54", "main_text": "HEPATITIS B AND C - AUSTRALIA: INCREASING INCIDENCE\n***************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n[There is a correction of this report: Hepatitis B & C - Australia: increasing incidence, corr. 20131206.2096779]\n\nDate: Sun 10 Nov 2013\nSource: Star Observer [edited]\nhttp://www.starobserver.com.au/news/local-news/new-south-wales-news/our-hidden-epidemic-hepatitis-in-australia/111558\n\n\nNearly half of the estimated 207 000 people living with chronic hepatitis B in Australia continue to remain undiagnosed, while 15 percent of people living with chronic hepatitis C in Australia have not yet been diagnosed, according to official figures released this week.

Scott Harrington's dental surgical practice.\n\nCompleted laboratory tests on 3122 people who were treated at W. Scott Harrington's dental surgical practice have identified 57 individuals who tested positive for hepatitis C and 3 individuals who tested positive for hepatitis B, the Oklahoma State Department of Health and the Tulsa Health Department announced on 18 Apr 2013. \"Positive results have been reported for HIV, but OSDH Data Security Policy regarding HIV disclosure prohibits public reporting of numbers less than 3,\" the 2 agencies stated in a statement posted that day.\n\nThis confirmation came after the 1st round of results from the testing. On 28 Mar 2013, public health officials announced they were notifying current and former patients of the practice that they may have been exposed to bloodborne viruses at Harrington's Tulsa and Owasso offices and urged them to be tested.\n\nThe Oklahoma State Department of Health's Public Health Laboratory completed the testing for 3122 people; 3235 people as of 18 Apr 2013 had visited county health departments to have blood drawn for testing, and an unknown number of others have sought testing through private health care providers, the statement says.

Only 10 percent to 20 percent of hepatitis cases are detected, said Rino Gani, head of the Indonesia Liver Research Association (PPHI). \"Not everyone knows about the status of their infection and not everyone has had themselves examined,\" Rino said at a news conference ahead of World Hepatitis Day on 28 Jul 2012. Hepatitis takes a long time to show symptoms, but the disease can cause liver cirrhosis and cancer, Rino said. \"The damage only becomes known when it is already too late and not much can be done,\" Rino said. One of the problems is money, Rino said. Tests and treatment are only affordable for a small segment of society. Another is stigma. People who know they are infected often do not seek out treatment because they do not want people to know about their condition. Since the disease does not cause them pain, they are able to ignore it.\n\nAccording to H.M. Subuh, a director at the Health Ministry, rapid detection tests cost between Rp 30 000 [USD 3.18] and Rp 50 000 [5.29], and more sophisticated tests cost Rp 100 000 to Rp 150 000. [One USD approximates to 9445 Indonesian Rupiah]. \"The problem is that after someone is declared hepatitis B or C positive, another series of tests have to be undergone and the costs is about Rp 2 million [USD 211.75] and has to be done repeatedly before being eligible for therapy\" which can cost tens or hundreds of millions of rupiah, he said. The government's Jamkesmas health insurance scheme covers treatment for poor people, he added. Rino said an alternative to expensive therapies was needed. He praised a partnership between the University of Indonesia and the University of Kobe in Japan to develop an herbal-based cure for hepatitis C.\n\nA 2007 Health Ministry study found that 9.4 percent of Indonesians, or about 30 million people, were positive for hepatitis B or C. Globally, 170 million people are infected, and the disease[s] causes 1.5 million deaths annually. Several groups are especially vulnerable to hepatitis, including health workers, intravenous drug users and children whose mothers are infected, Rino said. Soldiers also carry a high risk of infection because of bleeding during exercise or sharing razors. Unsterile tattooing can also spread hepatitis.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Hepatitis B is a potentially life-threatening liver infection caused by the hepatitis B virus. It is a major global health problem and the most serious type of viral hepatitis. It can cause chronic liver disease and puts people at high risk of death from cirrhosis of the liver and liver cancer. Worldwide, an estimated 2 billion people have been infected with the hepatitis B virus and more than 240 million have chronic (long-term) liver infections. About 600 000 people die every year due to the acute or chronic consequences of hepatitis. Hepatitis B virus is transmitted between people by direct blood-to-blood contact or semen and vaginal fluid of an infected person. Modes of transmission are the same as those for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), but the hepatitis B virus is 50 to 100 times more infectious. Unlike HIV, the hepatitis B virus can survive outside the body for at least 7 days. During this time, the virus can still cause infection if it enters the body of a person who is not protected by the vaccine. A vaccine against hepatitis B has been available since 1982. Hepatitis B vaccine is 95 percent effective in preventing infection and its chronic consequences, and is the 1st vaccine against a major human cancer. (For more detailed information, see http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs204/en/index.html).\n\nHepatitis C is a contagious liver disease that results from infection with the hepatitis C virus. It can range in severity from a mild illness lasting a few weeks to a serious, lifelong illness. Hepatitis C virus is usually spread when blood from an infected person enters the body of a susceptible person. It is among the most common viruses that infect the liver. Every year, 3-4 million people are infected with the hepatitis C virus. About 150 million people are chronically infected and at risk of developing liver cirrhosis and/or liver cancer. More than 350 000 people die from hepatitis C-related liver diseases every year. Hepatitis C may be transmitted through sex with an infected person or sharing of personal items contaminated with infectious blood, but these are less common. Hepatitis C is not spread through breast milk, food or water or by casual contact such as hugging, kissing and sharing food or drinks with an infected person. There is no generally available vaccine for prevention of hepatitis C virus infection. However antiviral drugs are becoming available which are effective in the treatment of hepatitis caused by some strains of hepatitis C virus. (For more detailed information, see: http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs164/en/index.html).\n\nThe World Health Organisation also organizes World Hepatitis Day on 28 July every year to increase awareness and understanding of viral hepatitis.\n\nThe interactive HealthMap of indonesia can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/r/01dp. - Mod.CP]\nSee Also\nHepatitis A - Indonesia: (WJ) 20111115.3370\n.................................................mpp/cp/mpp", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "hepatitis a", "hepatitis b", "hepatitis c", "hepatitis d"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2021-03-19 00:00:00", "2007-03-16 00:00:00", "1982-03-16 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Japan", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Indonesia", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "1487843", "headline": "PRO/EDR> Hepatitis B - Uganda: (MO, AI)", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=1487843", "date": "2012-07-21 20:35:19", "main_text": "HEPATITIS B AND C - INDONESIA: UNDERESTIMATED\n*********************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Sat 21 Jul 2012\nSource: The Jakarta Globe [edited]\nhttp://www.thejakartaglobe.com/news/hepatitis-cases-lurk-unchecked-in-indonesia/531776\n\n\nHepatitis Cases Lurk Unchecked in Indonesia\n----------------------\nHidden symptoms and a strong stigma are reasons many people with hepatitis B and C do not know they are infected, a medical researcher said on Friday [20 Jul 2012].

One of the problems is money, Rino said. Tests and treatment are only affordable for a small segment of society. Another is stigma. People who know they are infected often do not seek out treatment because they do not want people to know about their condition. Since the disease does not cause them pain, they are able to ignore it.\n\nAccording to H.M. Subuh, a director at the Health Ministry, rapid detection tests cost between Rp 30 000 [USD 3.18] and Rp 50 000 [5.29], and more sophisticated tests cost Rp 100 000 to Rp 150 000. [One USD approximates to 9445 Indonesian Rupiah]. \"The problem is that after someone is declared hepatitis B or C positive, another series of tests have to be undergone and the costs is about Rp 2 million [USD 211.75] and has to be done repeatedly before being eligible for therapy\" which can cost tens or hundreds of millions of rupiah, he said. The government's Jamkesmas health insurance scheme covers treatment for poor people, he added. Rino said an alternative to expensive therapies was needed. He praised a partnership between the University of Indonesia and the University of Kobe in Japan to develop an herbal-based cure for hepatitis C.\n\nA 2007 Health Ministry study found that 9.4 percent of Indonesians, or about 30 million people, were positive for hepatitis B or C. Globally, 170 million people are infected, and the disease[s] causes 1.5 million deaths annually. Several groups are especially vulnerable to hepatitis, including health workers, intravenous drug users and children whose mothers are infected, Rino said. Soldiers also carry a high risk of infection because of bleeding during exercise or sharing razors. Unsterile tattooing can also spread hepatitis.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Hepatitis B is a potentially life-threatening liver infection caused by the hepatitis B virus. It is a major global health problem and the most serious type of viral hepatitis. It can cause chronic liver disease and puts people at high risk of death from cirrhosis of the liver and liver cancer. Worldwide, an estimated 2 billion people have been infected with the hepatitis B virus and more than 240 million have chronic (long-term) liver infections. About 600 000 people die every year due to the acute or chronic consequences of hepatitis. Hepatitis B virus is transmitted between people by direct blood-to-blood contact or semen and vaginal fluid of an infected person. Modes of transmission are the same as those for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), but the hepatitis B virus is 50 to 100 times more infectious. Unlike HIV, the hepatitis B virus can survive outside the body for at least 7 days. During this time, the virus can still cause infection if it enters the body of a person who is not protected by the vaccine. A vaccine against hepatitis B has been available since 1982. Hepatitis B vaccine is 95 percent effective in preventing infection and its chronic consequences, and is the 1st vaccine against a major human cancer. (For more detailed information, see http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs204/en/index.html).\n\nHepatitis C is a contagious liver disease that results from infection with the hepatitis C virus. It can range in severity from a mild illness lasting a few weeks to a serious, lifelong illness. Hepatitis C virus is usually spread when blood from an infected person enters the body of a susceptible person. It is among the most common viruses that infect the liver. Every year, 3-4 million people are infected with the hepatitis C virus. About 150 million people are chronically infected and at risk of developing liver cirrhosis and/or liver cancer. More than 350 000 people die from hepatitis C-related liver diseases every year. Hepatitis C may be transmitted through sex with an infected person or sharing of personal items contaminated with infectious blood, but these are less common. Hepatitis C is not spread through breast milk, food or water or by casual contact such as hugging, kissing and sharing food or drinks with an infected person. There is no generally available vaccine for prevention of hepatitis C virus infection. However antiviral drugs are becoming available which are effective in the treatment of hepatitis caused by some strains of hepatitis C virus.

Only 10 percent to 20 percent of hepatitis cases are detected, said Rino Gani, head of the Indonesia Liver Research Association (PPHI). \"Not everyone knows about the status of their infection and not everyone has had themselves examined,\" Rino said at a news conference ahead of World Hepatitis Day on 28 Jul 2012. Hepatitis takes a long time to show symptoms, but the disease can cause liver cirrhosis and cancer, Rino said. \"The damage only becomes known when it is already too late and not much can be done,\" Rino said. One of the problems is money, Rino said. Tests and treatment are only affordable for a small segment of society. Another is stigma. People who know they are infected often do not seek out treatment because they do not want people to know about their condition. Since the disease does not cause them pain, they are able to ignore it.\n\nAccording to H.M. Subuh, a director at the Health Ministry, rapid detection tests cost between Rp 30 000 [USD 3.18] and Rp 50 000 [5.29], and more sophisticated tests cost Rp 100 000 to Rp 150 000. [One USD approximates to 9445 Indonesian Rupiah]. \"The problem is that after someone is declared hepatitis B or C positive, another series of tests have to be undergone and the costs is about Rp 2 million [USD 211.75] and has to be done repeatedly before being eligible for therapy\" which can cost tens or hundreds of millions of rupiah, he said. The government's Jamkesmas health insurance scheme covers treatment for poor people, he added. Rino said an alternative to expensive therapies was needed. He praised a partnership between the University of Indonesia and the University of Kobe in Japan to develop an herbal-based cure for hepatitis C.\n\nA 2007 Health Ministry study found that 9.4 percent of Indonesians, or about 30 million people, were positive for hepatitis B or C. Globally, 170 million people are infected, and the disease[s] causes 1.5 million deaths annually. Several groups are especially vulnerable to hepatitis, including health workers, intravenous drug users and children whose mothers are infected, Rino said. Soldiers also carry a high risk of infection because of bleeding during exercise or sharing razors. Unsterile tattooing can also spread hepatitis.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Hepatitis B is a potentially life-threatening liver infection caused by the hepatitis B virus. It is a major global health problem and the most serious type of viral hepatitis. It can cause chronic liver disease and puts people at high risk of death from cirrhosis of the liver and liver cancer. Worldwide, an estimated 2 billion people have been infected with the hepatitis B virus and more than 240 million have chronic (long-term) liver infections. About 600 000 people die every year due to the acute or chronic consequences of hepatitis. Hepatitis B virus is transmitted between people by direct blood-to-blood contact or semen and vaginal fluid of an infected person. Modes of transmission are the same as those for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), but the hepatitis B virus is 50 to 100 times more infectious. Unlike HIV, the hepatitis B virus can survive outside the body for at least 7 days. During this time, the virus can still cause infection if it enters the body of a person who is not protected by the vaccine. A vaccine against hepatitis B has been available since 1982. Hepatitis B vaccine is 95 percent effective in preventing infection and its chronic consequences, and is the 1st vaccine against a major human cancer. (For more detailed information, see http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs204/en/index.html).\n\nHepatitis C is a contagious liver disease that results from infection with the hepatitis C virus. It can range in severity from a mild illness lasting a few weeks to a serious, lifelong illness. Hepatitis C virus is usually spread when blood from an infected person enters the body of a susceptible person. It is among the most common viruses that infect the liver. Every year, 3-4 million people are infected with the hepatitis C virus. About 150 million people are chronically infected and at risk of developing liver cirrhosis and/or liver cancer. More than 350 000 people die from hepatitis C-related liver diseases every year. Hepatitis C may be transmitted through sex with an infected person or sharing of personal items contaminated with infectious blood, but these are less common. Hepatitis C is not spread through breast milk, food or water or by casual contact such as hugging, kissing and sharing food or drinks with an infected person. There is no generally available vaccine for prevention of hepatitis C virus infection. However antiviral drugs are becoming available which are effective in the treatment of hepatitis caused by some strains of hepatitis C virus.

The state government has yet to make public the cause and\nspread of the disease and also investigate whether few doctors' medical\nmalpractices led to the outbreak.\n\nA paper by deputy director (epidemic) in the state health department claims\nthat the hepatitis B virus detected in Modasa was noticed in the 2001 focal\noutbreak of hepatitis B in Mehsana. Further details on the virus have been\nwilfully avoided. This, the officer claims, is a certain ayw subtype, which\nbecame lethal this year [2009].\n\nHowever, the virus this time claimed lives in 3 talukas Modasa, Idar, and\nMeghraj in Sabarkantha district, which is believed to be the epicentre of\nthe outbreak.

Health authorities started calling\npatients of the dentist on Tuesday [17 Jun 2008]. The dentist has\npractised in Alberta since 2001. Dr Gerry Predy, vice-president of\nCapital Health, said the chance the disease was transmitted to any of\nthe dentist's 1400 patients is very low -- somewhere between one in\n10 000 and one in 100 000. \"We don't anticipate that this is\nsomething people should be overly concerned about,\" said Predy.\n\nAlthough the chances are small, officials decided to inform the\npublic upfront rather then having it be found out later where it\ncould \"generate concern beyond what it should generate.\" Predy said\nit took until now for an expert panel to determine how to handle the\nsituation, complete a risk analysis, and compile a list of his\npatients. \"He wasn't putting anyone else at risk by virtue of this\ntime frame that's elapsed,\" Predy said.\n\nHe said the 37-year-old dentist has been co-operative and gave\npermission for his name to be released so that his current and past\npatients can be tested as a precaution.

HBV\nis transmitted through activities that involve percutaneous or\nmucosal contact with infectious blood or body fluids (such as, semen,\nsaliva). HBV is not spread through food or water, sharing eating\nutensils, breastfeeding, hugging, kissing, hand contact, coughing, or sneezing.\n\nThe risk of transmission of HBV from dentist to patient is therefore\nminimal unless there is exposure of the patient to blood or\nsecretions from the dentist. Under normal circumstances a dentist\nmight be at greater risk of contracting HBV from a patient rather\nthan the reverse. Further information would be appreciated with\nregard to Dr Predy's statement that \"There's a number of complexities\nfollowing this situation, which are very unique,\" but which he would\nnot disclose.\n\nEdmonton in the province of Alberta can be located on the\nHealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map of Canada at\n<http://healthmap.org/promed?v=55.4,-101.9,4>. - Mod.CP]\nSee Also\nHepatitis B & C, HIV, nosocomial (03): USA (NV) 20080302.0854\nHepatitis B & C, HIV, nosocomial (02): USA (NV) 20080228.0809\nHepatitis B & C, HIV, nosocomial - USA: (NV), alert, RFI 20080228.0802\n2001\n----\nHepatitis B, infection from surgeon - UK (Scotland) 20010829.2052\n1996\n----\nHepatitis B and aesthetics (3) 19960316.0487\nHepatitis B and aesthetics (2) 19960314.0473\nHepatitis B and aesthetics 19960313.0470\n...................................cp/mj/dk\n\n*##########################################################*\n************************************************************\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.

They suffered 145 cases in 2001 but it was not known\nhow many people died that year. There were no comparable data for a\nneighboring tribe, the Sharpas, who were also at risk. UNICEF aims to\nvaccinate all the 150 babies in the tribe 3 times before they are one\nyear old to try to eradicate the disease, which can cause liver\nfailure. The cause of the outbreak is a mystery, as is the reason for\nthe \"amazingly\" high mortality rate in a disease that often takes 20\nto 25 years to manifest itself, said UNICEF spokesman Damien\nPersonnaz.\n\nThe tribes live along the Pastaza and Morona rivers in an area of the\nAmazon basin so remote that travel from any of the 124 communities in\nwhich they live to the nearest health center can take 4 days.\n\n--\nJaime R. Torres\nProMED-ESP\n<torresj@iname.com>\n\n[Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is endemic in tropical regions of\nthe Amazon river basin. Periodic epidemics of severe acute disease\nwith rapid progression to fulminant hepatitis (with case-fatality\nrates of 10-20 percent) have been observed among chronic HBV carriers\nin these regions. These outbreaks of severe disease have been\nassociated in some instances (see the reference below for more\ndetailed information) with co-infection by hepatitis D virus, a\ndefective (and genetically unrelated) virus, which can propagate\nitself only in the presence of HBV, and which is also present in the\nAmazon river basin. It may be that hepatitis D virus plays a role in\nthe epidemiology of hepatitis in these 2 small tribal populations.\nControl of HBV infection using HBV vaccine would eradicate\nsimultaneously any hepatitis D virus, since it is dependent on HBV\nfor its replication. - Mod.CP]\nSee Also\nHepatitis D virus, children - Peru (Villa Rica) 20030712.1718\n..............mj/cp/pg/lm\n\n*##########################################################*\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.

They suffered 145 cases in 2001 but it was not known\nhow many people died that year. There were no comparable data for a\nneighboring tribe, the Sharpas, who were also at risk. UNICEF aims to\nvaccinate all the 150 babies in the tribe 3 times before they are one\nyear old to try to eradicate the disease, which can cause liver\nfailure. The cause of the outbreak is a mystery, as is the reason for\nthe \"amazingly\" high mortality rate in a disease that often takes 20\nto 25 years to manifest itself, said UNICEF spokesman Damien\nPersonnaz.\n\nThe tribes live along the Pastaza and Morona rivers in an area of the\nAmazon basin so remote that travel from any of the 124 communities in\nwhich they live to the nearest health center can take 4 days.\n\n--\nJaime R.

He said early surveys indicated that two\nthirds of China's 1.26 billion people had been infected, compared with\nabout one in 20 Americans. As with HIV, hepatitis B is spread by contact\nwith infected blood or through sex, but hepatitis B is easier to catch\nbecause it is 100 times more concentrated in the blood and can survive\nbriefly outside the human body.\nBecause of years of screening, most of China's blood supply is probably\nsafe from hepatitis B, said Liu Chongbo, a researcher at the China Academy\nof Medical Prevention.\nAbout 60 per cent of those who have had the disease caught it during\nchildhood, usually during routine vaccinations. Mothers also infect their\nchildren during birth or while breastfeeding, Liu said. Most of those\ninfected with hepatitis B survive. But in some cases, the virus [continues\nto] attack the liver, causing cirrhosis and cancer. These diseases kill\nabout 300 000 people in China each year, about 80 per cent of whom had\nhepatitis B, Liu said.\nExperts also blame an illegal trade in needles that have been inadequately\ncleaned and repackaged.

As I exhaust the possible means of transmission, I\nhave come across some theoretical concerns regarding the\ntransmission of HBV and aggressive manicure/pedicure. This\nquestion comes as we are trying to develop Public Health guidelines\nfor \"Salons\". Much appreciated if anyone has heard of this as a\nreal issue or has read literature on it.

An outbreak of hepatitis in Ontario attributed to such\nelectrodes was reported the other day by the national television news, and\nthe Ontario College of Physicians & Surgeons has (according to Canada News\nWire) just urged its members to immediately ban reusable subdermal needle\nelectrodes.
