The cases were confirmed in Jean Marie River and Fort Simpson, according to an advisory issued Wednesday [13 Jan 2021] morning. Last week, officials advised of 4 people that had been diagnosed in Fort Simpson [https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/4-people-diagnosed-whooping-cough-fort-simpson-1.5861325].\n\nPertussis is a vaccine-preventable disease that affects the lungs and respiratory tract. It's particularly dangerous to children under one year of age.\n\nThis is the 2nd year in a row the territory has declared a pertussis outbreak. An outbreak declared in January 2020 in the Yellowknife and Tlicho regions led to at least 55 confirmed cases [https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/whooping-cough-nwt-1.5585871].\n\nResidents of Jean Marie River and Fort Simpson are being asked to confirm their pertussis vaccinations as soon as possible by contacting their health centre, the advisory states. While the vaccine is safe and effective, the advisory says, immunity from it may fade over time. Boosters are typically offered in Grade 7, and then every 10 years as an adult. Pregnant women are also advised to get a vaccine between 27 and 32 weeks of their pregnancy, regardless of their last dose, in order to protect the newborn.\n\nAccording to the advisory, the 1st symptoms of pertussis appear 7-10 days after exposure but may take as long as 21 days to develop. They include mild fever; runny nose; red, watery eyes; sneezing; and mild cough. The cough becomes worse about 10 days after exposure, 'leading to severe, repeated, and forceful coughing spells that end with a whooping sound before the next breath,' the advisory says. The cough tends to be worse at night and may lead to vomiting or difficulty breathing, and babies and small children may turn blue.\n\nAnyone who thinks they may have been exposed to someone with pertussis or is showing symptoms is asked to contact their health centre as soon as possible.\n\nAnyone confirmed to have pertussis is strongly advised to stay at home, and in particular away from infants, young children, women in the last 3 months of pregnancy, and large public gatherings until their antibiotic treatment is completed.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[An outbreak of pertussis is reported above in the villages of Fort Simpson and Jean Marie River, Dehcho Region, Northwest Territories (NWT), Canada.

The public health advisory is intended to prevent the spread of this highly contagious infection within the Hudson Bay community of about 900, Dr Michael Patterson said during the Government of Nunavut's [GN] update on COVID-19 on Thursday [28 May 2020]. But 'we do not think this represents a risk or a threat to any other communities in Nunavut', Patterson said.\n\nWhooping cough can be spread easily from person to person, he said. 'Anyone can get whooping cough, but the most severe cases are in young children,' said Patterson. 'For that reason, the daycare in Sanikiluaq will remain closed for the time being.' Normally the GN would not take this action, but the decision was based on the possible risk of infection, he said. Daycares in Nunavut are slated to reopen on 1 Jun 2020 as part of the easing of COVID-19 restrictions in the territory. 'If we open up the daycares and there is transmission of pertussis in Sanikiluaq, then we have exposed children to an increased risk of transmission and acquisition of pertussis,' said Patterson. For children in daycares, Patterson said pertussis is 'far more dangerous than COVID', so 'that's the rationale for doing it the way we did'.\n\nAs well, he recommended that everyone in Sanikiluaq continue social distancing, as they have been doing for COVID-19, 'at least until we know if there are any other cases in Sanikiluaq'. Whooping cough is caused by the bacterium _Bordetella pertussis_, which can cause uncontrollable, violent coughing that often makes it hard to breathe. Nunavut has been hit by several outbreaks of whooping cough in recent years, with the most recent big outbreak taking place in 2017 (https://nunatsiaq.com/stories/article/65674whooping_cough_outbreak_over_say_nunavut_health_officials/).\n\nEvery year in Canada, there are 1 to 3 deaths due to whooping cough, mostly in babies under the age of 3 months who have not been immunized, according to Health Canada (https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/immunization/vaccine-preventable-diseases/pertussis-whooping-cough/health-professionals.html).\n\n[byline: Jane George]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[2]\nDate: Thu 18 Jun 2020 13:30 EDT\nSource: Nunatsiaq News [abridged, edited]\nhttps://nunatsiaq.com/stories/article/whooping-cough-outbreak-continues-in-nunavut-community/\n\n\nAn outbreak of pertussis, also known as whooping cough, continues in the Hudson Bay community of Sanikiluaq.

About 900 people live in Sanikiluaq. 'Health staff have been conducting contact tracing and investigation of symptoms to determine if there are additional undetected cases of pertussis within the community,' the department said. 'Health staff has also been reviewing and updating pertussis vaccinations for community members.'\n\nDue to the outbreak, no daycare is open in Sanikiluaq, although others in Nunavut have reopened.

Public health officials say there have been 23 confirmed cases of the disease [pertussis], also known as whooping cough, since 1 Jun [2019]. People who caught the disease range in age from 5 months to 15 years.\n\nOfficials say older children, adults, people who've been vaccinated, and those who've had whooping cough before may experience a milder illness but can still spread it to others.\n\nWhooping cough is spread by coughing or sneezing, or coming in direct contact with respiratory secretions of people who are infected, health officials say. The most common symptom is uncontrollable coughing spells often followed by a characteristic 'whoop' sound. An infected person can spread the disease starting when symptoms begin to 3 weeks after the coughing begins. Coughing frequently lasts for several weeks. County Public Health Director Ginger Hall says pertussis is highly communicable and can be prevented by the vaccine known as Tdap, which protects against tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Jefferson County, with a population of 116 229 residents in 2010, is on the northeastern border of the U.S. state of New York, adjacent to Lake Ontario and the St. Laurence River; its county seat is Watertown (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jefferson_County,_New_York).

The number of cases of whooping cough increased to more than 10 cases per 100 000 people.\n\nKnight [a nurse at the Purchase District Health Department] said the lack of vaccines for adults and a false sense of security [are] contributing to this increase.

Preliminary data for 2019 shows there were 25 cases of pertussis in infants less than 6 months old in Minnesota. Of those, 8 were hospitalized, and 2 of the hospitalized cases were severe. 'Infants who get pertussis can get very sick, and many need to be hospitalized,' Ehresmann said. 'The severe cases often require lengthy hospital stays with weeks to months in an intensive care unit. It can be devastating for the family.'\n\nHealth officials are emphasizing the importance of vaccination, especially during pregnancy, to help prevent pertussis. The tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis, or Tdap, vaccine is recommended during the 3rd trimester of each pregnancy. This recommendation has been around since 2012. Ehresmann explained that when the Tdap vaccine is given during pregnancy, the mother's body creates antibodies to fight off the pertussis bacteria. Some of those antibodies are passed to the baby before birth and offer short-term protection until the baby can start to receive their own vaccines.\n\nIn 2018 and 2019, Minnesota had 41 cases of pertussis among infants less than 6 months of age. Upon review, only 18 (44%) of the mothers received Tdap during pregnancy. 'We're missing opportunities to vaccinate during pregnancy and protect vulnerable infants from a serious disease,' Ehresmann said in the release. 'We are working with partners to make sure healthcare providers and pregnant women have the information they need to ensure on-time vaccination with this safe and effective vaccine.'\n\nMany infants who get pertussis are infected by older siblings, parents, or other caregivers. These people often do not know they have the disease because symptoms can be less severe in adolescents and adults.\n\nThere are 2 pertussis vaccines, and your age determines when you get each vaccine. The diphtheria, tetanus, and acellular pertussis, or DTaP vaccine, is given to children starting at age 2 months. The Tdap vaccine is given to adolescents at age 11-12 years and adults. Families should talk to their healthcare provider to see what vaccines they need and when. People who have completed some or all of the recommended vaccinations for pertussis may still get the disease but will generally have a milder illness.\n\nFor more information, go to http://www.health.state.mn.us/diseases/pertussis/index.html.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Minnesota, with an estimated population of over 5.6 million residents in 2019, is a state in the Upper Midwest, Great Lakes Region, of the United States; nearly 55% of its residents live in the Minneapolis-Saint Paul metropolitan area (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota).

According to Michael Charley, public health director of the Oak Park Health Department, as of 16 Dec [2019], there are 10 confirmed cases in Oak Park, which has averaged 3.1 cases per year between 2008 and 2018.\n\nWithin public schools, according to Charley, District 200 has 5 confirmed cases (4 students and one teacher), and District 97 has 2 confirmed cases, both students. In River Forest, District 90 has 3 confirmed cases of pertussis as of 16 Dec [2019]: 2 at Roosevelt Middle School and one at Willard School. It could not be confirmed at time of publication whether the confirmed cases in D200, D97, or D90 were in vaccinated or unvaccinated children.\n\nIn 10 Dec and 16 Dec [2019] memos to D90 parents, the steps the district was taking to help prevent further infections were outlined, and information from the Cook County Department of Public Health was forwarded.\n\n'Please be assured that all of the district's nurses are aware of this situation and are monitoring the situation,' read the memo. 'Our nurses are following the recommended protocols of the Illinois Department of Public Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).'\n\nThe custodial staff at all D90 locations have been intensifying disinfection of classrooms, bathrooms, desks, door handles, and other common areas throughout the school.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) website, pertussis diagnoses have been on the rise since the early 1980s. The CDC has identified several explanations for this, including 'increased awareness, improved diagnostic tests, better reporting, more circulation of the bacteria, and waning immunity.'\n\nAdditionally, according to the CDC, there is evidence that the bacteria that causes pertussis is 'changing at a genetic level,' though studies suggest that the current vaccines are still effective even as the bacteria transforms.\n\nHowever, the currently used pertussis vaccines may be less effective than those used prior to the 1990s, which could account, in part, for pertussis cases being on the rise since the 1980s. The vaccines currently given, DTaP and Tdap, are acellular vaccines, which contain only some organic material from _Bordetella pertussis_, the bacteria that causes the disease. These vaccines may not provide protection as effective as DTP, a whole-cell vaccine, which contains the entire inactivated _B. pertussis_ organism.\n\nIn the 1990s, according to the CDC, doctors in the United States switched from DTP, the whole-cell vaccine, to DTaP and Tdap, the acellular vaccines, because they had less major and minor side effects. But this change may have left Americans slightly less protected against the disease. According to the CDC website, 'Acellular pertussis vaccines may not prevent colonization (carrying the bacteria in your body without getting sick) or spread of the bacteria.' Additionally, waning immunity to the vaccine can leave even vaccinated people less protected than they might believe.\n\nAccording to the 10 Dec [2019] Cook County Department of Public Health's memo regarding the Roosevelt Middle School student with pertussis, required vaccinations for the illness should be given at ages 2, 4, 6, and 15 months. A booster should be given between the ages of 4 and 6. However, according to the memo, 'immunity begins to wane 3-5 years after the last shot. Protection can be completely gone by the time a child enters middle school.'\n\nThe CDC confirms this, estimating that 'in the 1st year after getting vaccinated with Tdap, it protects about 7 out of 10 people who receive it. There is a decrease in effectiveness in each following year. About 3 or 4 out of 10 people are fully protected 4 years after getting Tdap.' For this reason, states the Cook County Department of Health, a Tdap booster is recommended for preteens at age 11 or 12. The department states that being up-to-date with Tdap is especially important for teens who will be around babies.\n\nRecommendations from the CDC also include Tdap for children 7-10 years old who are not fully vaccinated with DTaP, adults 65 years and older who are in close contact with young infants, and healthcare workers. It is recommended that pregnant women should receive a dose of Tdap during each pregnancy between 27 and 36 weeks of gestation.\n\n[Byline: Maria Maxham]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Oak Park River Forest High School, or OPRF, is a public 4-year high school located in Oak Park, Illinois, a western suburb of Chicago, Illinois, in the United States (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oak_Park_and_River_Forest_High_School).

Of those, 190 presented to the emergency department, up from 124 the same time last year [2018]. 'This year across the state we've had roughly a 50 per cent increase in diagnoses of whooping cough, which is really terrible news,' Dr Redmond said. '[It is] an unexpected and unwanted rise.' The condition causes severe respiratory problems and can be fatal for babies.\n\nDr Redmond said more education was needed to improve vaccination rates in pregnant women. 'I think a lot of people engaging in good obstetric care know about it, but not everyone knows about it,' he said.\n\n(Only 34 per cent of women take up recommended vaccinations in pregnancy. Respiratory infections are the leading cause of death in babies up to 6 months old. Pertussis (whooping cough) is the most common fatal infection in babies under 2 months. 42 per cent of babies hospitalised for pertussis are under 6 months old.)\n\nRBWH obstetric physician and director of women's and newborn services, Karin Lust, said babies with whooping cough often got very sick with terrible coughing and reductions in their oxygen that could result in problems breathing and feeding. 'It's very tragic for families and obviously it is awful to see your child unwell, it is very distressing,' she said. Dr Lust said getting the vaccination while pregnant was the best protection, reducing the risk of infection by 90 per cent.\n\n'Whooping cough vaccination during pregnancy boosts maternal antibodies, which are transferred to the foetus through the placenta, providing some immunity to the newborn baby until they can receive their 1st dose of vaccine around 6 weeks of age.'\n\nThe vaccination schedule changed recently, meaning expectant mothers can get vaccinated earlier, from 20 to 32 weeks. 'It gives women a greater window of opportunity to actually have their vaccination so that they don't miss out on the protective benefits for their newborn baby,' Dr Lust said. 'Also, it actually will afford babies who are born premature a level of immunity as well.'\n\n[Byline: Louisa Rebgetz]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Queensland, located in the northeast of the country, is the 2nd-largest and 3rd-most populous state in Australia, with a population of 5 million residents in 2018 that is concentrated along the coast, particularly in the state's South East, where Brisbane, the capital and largest city in the state is located (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queensland).

The 4th school district is Blairsville-Saltsburg School District, which straddles both Indian and Westmoreland counties.\n\nThe free, walk-in vaccination clinic will be administering the 'Tdap' vaccination shot -- for tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis -- from 2 to 6 pm [Thu 5 Dec 2019] at the Indiana County State Health Center, 75 N Main St, Indiana.\n\nThe state is encouraging anyone from 10 to 64 years old in the county to take advantage of the clinic, particularly anyone who is pregnant or works or lives with or around pregnant women or infants, who are the most susceptible to the worst effects of whooping cough.\n\nBut the vaccine's potency can fade after that without an adolescent or adult booster shot. That may be what explains the outbreak's spread in Indiana County, which has one of the highest vaccination rates in the state for the Tdap vaccine at 97.6% for kindergartners and 99% for 12th graders, but a lower 88.8 % rate for the county's 8th graders. Indiana Area's 6 or 7 cases have all been of students who had previously been vaccinated, though they may not have been vaccinated since kindergarten.\n\n'There does appear to be a gap for students there between kindergarten and 12th grade who are headed to college,' said Nate Wardle, a department of health spokesman. 'That could be a sign of where this is coming from.' High school senior vaccination levels may jump because they are preparing to head to colleges and universities, which require tetanus shots, which means they would probably get the whole Tdap booster then, Mr Wardle said.\n\nHow it spread across 4 school districts is still being studied, Mr Wardle said, though some of the earliest cases could have been kids at the same movie, mall, vocational technology center, or some other gathering point. 'We don't have any information as to what the exact cause was yet,' he said. Mr Heinrich said Indiana Area has tried to piece together what put their cases in common, too. 'We couldn't find a pattern whether it was a group of wrestlers, cheerleaders, or some specific building,' he said.\n\nMr Wardle said the last outbreak like this occurred 3 years ago, during the same time of year, with a similar number of cases, and also among school kids, in Chambersburg, Franklin County.\n\nThe district has responded to each case with letters home to all of the students' families in the buildings where the students attended -- the district has had cases in 4 of its 6 buildings so far -- providing basic information about the disease and listing a contact number for the state health department.\n\nThe district also specifically reached out to the families of students who were either immuocompromised or not yet vaccinated to warn them again of the dangers of staying unvaccinated. Though state law says in cases like this the school district may exclude unvaccinated students, the district has not yet done that.\n\nBut once a student or the one faculty member was confirmed with whooping cough, they were told to stay home at least 15 days from the onset of symptoms, or for 5 days after they began taking antibiotics, which is included in the state law, too.\n\nThe district had all of the cases closer to the beginning of the year, but has one unconfirmed case still being investigated from just last week, Mr. Heinrich said.

Frankovich says this is particularly important before kids head back to school, where it is even easier for pertussis to circulate.\n\nShe says there have been 10 cases in the past month or so, and 80% of the cases have been in children. Cases have occurred in the Dickinson-Iron, Delta-Menominee and Marquette County Health Department districts. Most medical providers and all health departments have vaccine on hand.\n\nFrankovich notes that children normally receive the DTaP vaccine, which provides protection against pertussis, at 2, 4, 6 and 12-15 months of age, and a booster dose at 4-6 years of age. 'Some parents may not realize that another booster dose (called Tdap), is now required for children at 11 years of age. This one-time booster is also recommended for adults who have not had a pertussis vaccine since childhood and is recommended for pregnant women with each pregnancy.'

More than 46 cases of pertussis have been reported in the county this year [2019] and 2 in West Linn.\n\nWith cold and flu season officially underway, health officials in Clackamas County and the tri-county region [Clackamas, Multnomah, and Washington counties] have observed an uptick in cases of pertussis, also known as whooping cough, since July [2019].\n\nAs of the week of [4 Nov 2019], between 45-50 cases of pertussis have been reported to the county, which is double the number of cases [in 2019 than] last year [2018].\n\nOf those, most have been school-age children. On [7 Nov 2019], the Clackamas Community Health Division released a statement to West Linn High School students citing a case of pertussis.\n\n'There have been a few cases, I believe, at West Linn High School and there have been a number of cases at several high schools in the county and in the region,' said Dr Sarah Present, a Clackamas County health officer. [On 20 Nov 2019] the district announced another case at Bolton Primary School.\n\n'We are in a hot year for pertussis and we know that we have a communitywide spread of it, and we actually have more cases of it in Clackamas than we do in the other 2 counties (Multnomah and Washington) in our region with which we share data.'\n\nAccording to Present, pertussis is unusual in that it is hard to initially diagnose because its earliest symptoms are the same as the common cold. It isn't until the 2nd week of infection that more aggressive symptoms begin to manifest. 'Whooping cough does follow 3- to 5-year waves, and we're at a time to have an uptick in pertussis. The amount that we've had, in Clackamas County, in particular, has been the most we've had in many, many years,' Present said.\n\n'And it is at many elementary schools and middle schools. But when we have a case that's seen at a school, we know that those are places where kids, many of whom are going to be susceptible to getting it, are in close contact with other kids, so it's a high-risk for transmission place,' she said. 'When we do have cases, we want to make sure that the whole school community that could have been exposed to know that they could have been exposed.'\n\n'There are a few misconceptions or misperceptions about pertussis that are important to know,' Present said. 'One thing we have noticed is that while the pertussis vaccine is a recommended health vaccine and most people are vaccinated, and it is absolutely the best way of protecting against pertussis, it's not 100% and the immunity does wane over time. So, we recommend a pertussis booster around 11 or 12 years old, and not as many people get that booster.'\n\nPresent stressed that getting the vaccine is by far the best way to protect against contracting pertussis, but she also said everyone's immunities are different and having been vaccinated is not a protection guarantee. In order to protect other students and the community, Present recommends those who have been exposed to pertussis to stay home if they start to show signs of getting sick, even if they are mild, and to get tested by a healthcare provider. If a case is confirmed, County officials caution that the patient should stay home until they've completed a full course of antibiotics.\n\n[Byline: Claire Green]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Clackamas County, with a population of 375 992 residents in 2010, is in the US state of Oregon and is part of the Portland-Vancouver-Hillsboro, OR-WA Metropolitan Statistical Area; Multnomah and Washington are adjacent counties (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clackamas_County,_Oregon).

PERTUSSIS UPDATE (12): AMERICAS (CANADA, USA)\n*********************************************\n \n\n\nEast Penn students in elementary, middle, and high schools have been diagnosed with pertussis, or whooping cough, the district informed parents in a letter [Thu 14 Nov 2019]. As of the week of [4 Nov 2019], between 45-50 cases of pertussis have been reported to the county, which is double the number of cases [in 2019 than] last year [2018]. USA\n---\n Canada\n---\n \n\nCheck with your health care provider or the Timiskaming Health Unit to ensure you and your family are up to date on your whooping cough (pertussis) vaccination. USA\n---\n \n\n'We are in a hot year for pertussis and we know that we have a communitywide spread of it, and we actually have more cases of it in Clackamas than we do in the other 2 counties (Multnomah and Washington) in our region with which we share data.' \n\n'Since learning of each confirmed case, we have worked closely with the PA [Pennsylvania] Department of Health to ensure that all procedures and protocols related to pertussis are implemented,' Palmer stated, adding that the district has stepped up its cleaning and is using a disinfectant known to be effective against the disease. \n\nCases of pertussis, or whooping cough, are rapidly spreading. [6] Oregon (Clackamas County)\n\n******\n \n\nPregnant or immunocompromised individuals should follow-up with their healthcare provider to confirm their history of vaccination against whooping cough (pertussis). \n\nThe letters were sent to the parents of students at Emmaus High School, Lower Macungie Middle School, and Wescosville and Shoemaker elementary schools. \n\nPrior to wide availability of pertussis vaccines in the 1940s, roughly 200 000 children were sickened with the disease each year, resulting in about 9000 fatalities, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \n\n--\n \n\n--\n [Byline: Michelle Merlin]\n\n--\n [Byline: Liz Bonis]\n\n--\n [Byline: Claire Green]\n\n--\n \n\nPresent stressed that getting the vaccine is by far the best way to protect against contracting pertussis, but she also said everyone's immunities are different and having been vaccinated is not a protection guarantee. \n\nSpringboro Schools spokesman Scott Marshall said those treated stayed home for at least 5 days, but they want to let the community know that they are recommending vaccinations for families because to very young children and also to older adults, this illness can be life-threatening.

Maine's pertussis rate of 33.16 per 100 000 in 2018 was more than 8x the national average. Maine had 446 pertussis cases in 2018, but 2019 could eclipse last year, which was the worst year for pertussis since 2012.\n\nRecent outbreaks occurred at Portland schools in May [2019], as well as earlier this year [2019] at Falmouth High School and Thornton Academy in Saco. Schools have been the source of many outbreaks this year, and 51 percent of all cases in 2019 -- 106 of the 208 cases -- have occurred in those between the ages of 11 and 19.\n\nMeghan May, associate professor of microbiology at the University of New England, said low vaccination rates in Maine are 'absolutely' a contributing factor, but there doesn't seem to be any one reason that pertussis is a problem in comparison to other infectious diseases such as measles. 'It's a multifaceted problem with several different dynamics,' said May, who has researched pertussis. 'We don't know why it's pertussis here and not measles.'\n\nMaine is especially vulnerable to the return of infectious diseases such as pertussis, public health experts have said, because of the state's dangerously low levels of immunization rates in schools. Maine has consistently been among the worst in the nation for parents forgoing vaccines for non-medical reasons for students entering kindergarten, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThe pertussis vaccine's effectiveness wanes, which is why pediatricians recommend a booster shot in middle school. Though Maine now requires the booster for incoming 7th-graders, it was among the last states in the nation to add the middle school booster, in 2017-18. And like all other school-required vaccines, parents can opt out of the pertussis booster or other immunizations for their children by signing a form. That will change for the 2021-22 school year.\n\nMaine lawmakers passed a bill this spring and Gov. Janet Mills signed into law a measure that, starting in 2021, would eliminate philosophic and religious exemptions to school-required vaccines. Maine had 5.6 percent of parents signing philosophic or religious exemptions to vaccines for children entering kindergarten in 2018-19, according to the Maine CDC. 43 elementary schools had 15 percent or higher non-medical opt-out rates, putting those schools at increased risk of infectious disease outbreaks. Peter Michaud, counsel for the Maine Medical Association, which represents doctors before the Legislature, said over time, the new law will improve vaccination rates and Maine's pertussis rate should decline. 'We are taking the steps that are available to us to protect Maine's children,' Michaud said. 'In the meantime, parents who have children who need their vaccines shouldn't wait until the law goes into effect. They can protect their children from contagions now.'\n\n[Byline: Joe Lawlor]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[HealthMap/ProMED-mail map Maine, United States: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/222\nMaine, with a population of about 1.34 million in 2018, is a state in the New England region of northeastern United States (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maine).

The research was published today [10 Jun 20190] in Pediatrics [1].\n\nDTaP vaccine, which protects against pertussis, diphtheria, and tetanus, is given in 5 doses between the ages of 2 months and 6 years. In this study, researchers from Kaiser Permanente Northern California followed children born between 1999 and 2016 who were diagnosed as having whooping cough.\n\nThe researchers identified 738 pertussis cases, with 99 cases in unvaccinated children, 36 in under-vaccinated children, 515 in fully vaccinated children (5 DTaP doses), and 88 in children who had received 6 doses of DTaP.\n\nMore than 80% of cases occurred in fully vaccinated children. Children only partially vaccinated were 1.9 times more likely to contract whooping cough than fully vaccinated peers.\n\n'Although noncompliance with the vaccination schedule is an important public health problem that leads to increased pertussis risk, most children in our study received all their recommended DTaP doses,' the authors wrote. 'Our results reveal that waning of DTaP immunity was an important cause of pertussis in children.'\n\nIn 2010 and 2014, California experienced 2 large pertussis outbreaks, with more than 9000 cases each.\n\nThis is the 3rd study completed by this researcher group to provide evidence of waning pertussis immunity, and the authors said results are consistent with other recent data that showed the odds of pertussis increased by 33% for every additional year after the third or the fifth DTaP dose.\n\nKathryn Edwards, MD, of the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, said in a commentary on the study [2] that the waning efficacy is likely because DTaP is an acellular vaccine, which replaced a whole-cell vaccine, DTwP, in 1997. Whole-cell vaccines, Edwards explains, generate more protective T-cell responses. After the introduction of a whole-cell pertussis vaccine in the United States, annual rates of the disease dropped from 150 per 100 000 in the 1940s to 1 per 100 000 in the 1970s in the United States.\n\nThough efficacious, DTwP caused more reactions than DTaP, including febrile seizures and local injection-site reactions.\n\nDTwP is no longer available in the United States or other high-income countries, so other strategies to boost pertussis immunity must be explored, including maternal vaccination and an intranasal booster dose of the vaccine, Edwards said.\n\n[Byline: Stephanie Soucheray]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[References\n-----------\n1.

School District 27 distributed letters from Interior Health [IH] this week [week of 3 Jun 2019] for parents outlining the symptoms and the fact pertussis can spread easily.\n\nThere have been about 30 cases throughout the IH region, and the majority of them have been in the Thompson-Cariboo so far in 2019, said Dr Karin Goodison, medical health officer with IH. 'What we know about pertussis is, it sort of goes through cycles,' Goodison said. 'Every 3 to 5 years we see more cases. Last year [2018] we did not see many at all, but in 2016 and 2017 we saw a lot of cases. In 2019 we are starting to see some clusters of cases so we are going to be keeping an eye on that.'\n\nVaccines are helpful in preventing pertussis, but they are not 100 per cent effective, Goodison added. 'Unfortunately it's one of our vaccines that doesn't work as well as some of our other vaccines. Your chances of getting pertussis are much lower if you are a vaccinated, but you still can get the infection if you are exposed to someone who has it, particularly if it's been quite a while since you were immunized.'\n\nPeople at the highest risk are those who are under the age of one [year] and pregnant women, Goodison said. 'When we are looking at offering pertussis immunization, our goal of the program is to protect those groups of people.'\n\nOverall in the Thompson-Cariboo, about 77 per cent of 2 year olds are up-to-date with pertussis immunizations and 74 per cent of 7 year olds, Goodison confirmed. 'That's pretty good, compared to the rest of Interior Health, but we would like to see it higher.'\n\nIf a person has had a persistent cough or been exposed to someone they know that has been diagnosed with pertussis, they should visit a care provider to get tested. 'We see a few more cases throughout the spring and summer typically, so it's kind of got a seasonal pattern. It's quite interesting to look at it over time. If you look back in 2016 and 2017, the Thompson-Cariboo Shuswap had a very similar rate of illness as it does right now.'\n\nWork is being done to develop a better vaccine, recognizing that the protection from pertussis is not as long lasting, she added. In Canada, children are immunized for pertussis under the age of 2 and again when they are in school.\n\n[Byline: Monica Lamb-Yorski]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[HealthMap/ProMED-mail map of British Columbia, Canada: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/18209\nThompson-Cariboo, with a population of 118 618 in 2011, is a federal electoral district in the province of British Columbia, Canada; about 3/4 of the population in this district live in the city of Kamloops (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamloops--Thompson--Cariboo).

' \n\nPertussis is a persistent public health problem in Maine, as the state has the worst per-capita pertussis rate in the nation. \n\nDTwP is no longer available in the United States or other high-income countries, so other strategies to boost pertussis immunity must be explored, including maternal vaccination and an intranasal booster dose of the vaccine, Edwards said. \n\nThe proceedings were initiated that same day, with the application of the protocol for pertussis surveillance and outbreak control, which includes recommendations for treatment and isolation of cases, and identification of contacts to review their vaccination status and administer prophylaxis antibiotic if applicable. \n\n\nThe [Cordoba] Provincial Health Ministry has verified a total of 56 cases of whooping cough in 2019, caused by the bacterium _Bordetella pertussis_, against the 19 registered in the same period last year [2018]. \n\nMeghan May, associate professor of microbiology at the University of New England, said low vaccination rates in Maine are 'absolutely' a contributing factor, but there doesn't seem to be any one reason that pertussis is a problem in comparison to other infectious diseases such as measles. \n\nMaine is especially vulnerable to the return of infectious diseases such as pertussis, public health experts have said, because of the state's dangerously low levels of immunization rates in schools. \n\nDTaP vaccine, which protects against pertussis, diphtheria, and tetanus, is given in 5 doses between the ages of 2 months and 6 years. Europe\n---\n Americas\n---\n \n\nRecent outbreaks occurred at Portland schools in May [2019], as well as earlier this year [2019] at Falmouth High School and Thornton Academy in Saco. \n\nThat same day, this information was also communicated to the school management so that they could send the parents an informative circular about whooping cough and its prevention, so that they could check the children's immunization status and contact their doctor or pediatrician in case of being high-risk contact. \n\n--\n [Byline: Monica Lamb-Yorski]\n\n--\n \n\n--\n A child who has never been vaccinated against pertussis, or whooping cough, is 13 times more likely to suffer from an infection of _Bordetella pertussis_ than is a child who is up-to-date on his or her vaccines.

Schools have been the source of many outbreaks this year, and 51 percent of all cases in 2019 -- 106 of the 208 cases -- have occurred in those between the ages of 11 and 19. \n\nThere have been about 30 cases throughout the IH region, and the majority of them have been in the Thompson-Cariboo so far in 2019, said Dr Karin Goodison, medical health officer with IH.

That's nearly double the number of cases from last month [April 2019], when Dr Na-Koshie Lamptey declared a whooping cough outbreak for the capital region.\n\nPublic health will be offering immunization clinics over the next week for those most at risk of the bacterial respiratory infection easily spread through droplets in the air from coughing and sneezing, Lamptey said on Tuesday [21 May 2019]. That includes people who have been in close contact with any of the confirmed cases and do not have a primary care provider who can immunize them, she said.\n\nNo details about the affected individuals have been released, but the affected schools include: Garden Creek Elementary, Park Street Elementary, Gibson-Neill Memorial Elementary, Nashwaaksis Middle School, Fredericton Christian Academy, and George Street Middle School.\n\nThe clinics will also be for infants without a primary care provider, as well as preschoolers and adults who don't have the recommended booster dose or a primary care provider. Health officials did not provide any information about the locations or times of the clinics.\n\nIn New Brunswick, children should have doses of the pertussis vaccine when they are 2, 4, 6, and 18 months old and again at age 4, followed by a booster dose in grade 7, said Lamptey. Adults should receive one dose of a pertussis-containing vaccine, because immunity from the vaccine decreases over time.\n\nDr Na-Koshie Lamptey, regional medical officer of health, said parents who seek medical attention should tell their primary care provider that they and their children may have had contact with a confirmed case of whooping cough. Last month [April 2019], Lamptey said 10 children and 2 adults in the Fredericton health region had been diagnosed since January [2019]. Normally, the region, which encompasses the Upper St John River Valley, sees no more than one case a year, while the entire province sees about 27 confirmed cases.

'For a little perspective, this time last year [2018] we were at 21 cases,' said Stacey Anderson, a state preventable disease epidemiologist with the Department of Public Health and Human Services. 'This is a vaccine-preventable disease,' Anderson said. 'If a person is not up-to-date on their pertussis vaccine, it's a good time to do so.'\n\nThe state's tally of cases as of 16 May [2019] lapped last year's [2018] total of 143. That has health workers behind the scenes trying to stop its spread.\n\nMatt Kelley, public health officer with the Gallatin City-County Health Department, said 34 county residents were diagnosed with pertussis since January [2019], a jump of 7 cases in less than a week. That includes a new Belgrade illness the department began investigating Tuesday [21 May 2019]. 'We're seeing it community-wide,' Kelley said. 'We have cases at MSU [Montana State University], within the Bozeman School District, and we have cases that don't seem to be related to any of the above.' That stands out from previous years where outbreaks were centralized.\n\nKelley said after the department learns of a new case, it finds people who could be exposed and, in some cases, advises they get antibiotics to avoid the illness. He said people with symptoms should reach out to their doctor and get tested. 'We're hoping for the best but planning for additional cases because I'm sure we'll see them,' Kelley said. 'We're trying to build a wall of protection around the people who are most vulnerable.' The situation isn't the same statewide. Anderson said 16 counties reported pertussis cases since January [2019] with Missoula County leading the pack. But there's concern that number will increase.\n\nThe infection typically has a spike in cases every 3-5 years. Kids in school have their last required pertussis vaccine in 7th grade. Anderson said it seems to have a weaning protection after roughly 3-4 years. She said so far this year [2019], most Montanans with the infection have been between 16 and 18 years old. Montana's last pertussis peak happened in 2013 with 663 cases. Anderson said the illness resurfacing every few years is likely a perfect storm of its natural cycle and people who may be due for a vaccination. 'There's some concern we're kind of falling into that cycle,' she said.\n\n[byline: Katheryn Houghton]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[3] Montana (Lake County/Flathead Reservation)\nDate: Wed 22 May 2019\nSource: KULR8 [edited]\nhttps://www.kulr8.com/regional/pertussis-cases-in-lake-co-grow-to-includes-infants/article_402d9020-54ba-5d3b-ac98-4bfdcde7b99b.html\n\n\nThe number of whooping cough cases in Lake County has now grown to 19, and health officials said on Wednesday [22 May 2019] that 4 of the cases are infants.\n\nThe following post is from the Lake County Public Health Facebook page:\n\nLake County/Flathead Reservation has bumped up to 19 confirmed pertussis cases.

'In this last few days, the number of new cases has dropped from about 6 per day to just one per day for the last several days,' said Leahy. 'We're encouraged by that, of course, but we're still doing a lot of follow-up work on the known cases.'\n\nLeahy contrasted the number of double-digit confirmed cases from previous weeks to the past few days. 'We have 134 cases total as of Thursday night [23 May 2019], and going into the week, we had 125, so the number of new cases is slowing down,' she said. 'This is a very encouraging sign, but there is a bit of a caveat, and that is that we changed our protocol again going into the week. Our follow-up is still very assertive, but our case-finding is less so, so that may affect it a little bit. But when you look at the current epidemic from the beginning, you see kind of a peak area for a couple of weeks, and now you're starting to see it go down.'\n\nThere were concerns that the pertussis vaccine's effectiveness was beginning to wane; however, with patient numbers dropping, healthcare officials are more optimistic that the outbreak may soon be over.

Luckily, my kids are vaccinated, but that doesn't mean other kids aren't at risk,' said SG, a parent in the area. The contagious respiratory infection primarily affects young children.\n\nWhooping cough starts out like a cold, but the bouts of coughing are much worse. Doctors say the bouts often leave kids gasping for air in between fits, hence that name. 'The problem with pertussis is when young babies are exposed, the effects can be very serious. In 2010, there was an outbreak of pertussis and 10 infants died of the disease that year,' said Dr. Matt Willi, Public Health Officer for Marin County.\n\nThe health department says almost every single school in the county has had at least one confirmed case of whooping cough. At Sir Francis Drake High School, 56 cases were confirmed. 'It's probably been about half of the kids in each class,' said Sir Francis Drake sophomore Isaac Dorfmaan. 'It's been really common this year (2018).' The health department says any child with a confirmed case immediately gets sent home from school for 3 days and is put on antibiotics before notifying the child's parents.\n\nThe department says low vaccination rates in the county are partly to blame for the high number of cases. Officials suggest parents keep a close eye on their kids' coughs.

Symptoms usually begin appearing as cold symptoms such as a cough, runny nose, sore throat and usually little or no fever. After several days, the cough may become more severe; it may come in spasms or as a series of coughs without a chance to breathe between coughs. There may be a gasp or 'whoop' and/or gagging or vomiting at the end of the coughing spasm.

The illness is a very contagious disease that spreads through coughing or sneezing, but it can take up to 3 weeks for symptoms to appear. Late-stage symptoms may include rapid coughing followed by a high-pitched 'whoop' sound, vomiting and exhaustion.\n\n'The best way to prevent pertussis is to be up-to-date on vaccinations,' Quick said. 'Children should receive 5 doses of DTaP [diphtheria, tetanus, and whooping cough (pertussis)] as part of their routine vaccination schedule starting at 2 months of age. Pregnant women during each pregnancy, regardless of when their previous pregnancy occurred, are strongly recommended to receive Tdap vaccine during their 3rd trimester.

As of last week there have been at least 17 confirmed measles cases this year [2019]. In addition to the measles, there have been 2 reported cases of whooping cough, or pertussis, on Vancouver Island this week.\n\nThe spread of communicable diseases increases when less than 90 to 95% of the population is immunized. 'That (a lower rate of immunization) is considered to be a contributing factor' to the increase of pertussis, said Dr. Manish Sadarangani, director of the vaccine evaluation centre at the B.C. Children's Hospital.\n\nChildren should be immunized against pertussis at 2, 4, 6 and 18 months, in preschool, and in Grade 9, he said. And pregnant women are immunized to protect their newborns up to the age of 2 months, he said. Pertussis after age 15 or so causes a bad cough that's annoying but not dangerous. But a baby with whooping cough could cough till they're blue or vomiting and that could lead to a lack of oxygen. In a worst case, that can be fatal, he said.\n\n'There is a push to have requirements for people to have all their (vaccination) documents before they go to school,' said Sadarangani. A Health Ministry spokeswoman said pertussis is among the diseases that it recommends immunizing against.\n\nPertussis in B.C., like elsewhere, 'remains an endemic disease' that goes through cyclical peaks every 3 to 5 years, according to the B.C. Centre for Disease Control website. It says there has been a 'gradual increase in overall pertussis activity' since 2012 and that 'may reflect changes in population-level immunity.'\n\nIn B.C., there were fewer than 13 confirmed cases per 100 000 population in 2017, which was slightly lower than the fewer than 20 cases in 2015 and 2016. But it's higher than rates of fewer than 5 to 10 per 100 000 in 2008 through 2014, according to the Centre. The highest rates were in Vancouver Island and Interior health authorities, particularly in Kootenay Boundary, South Vancouver Island and Okanagan regions, it said.\n\nIn 2017, the highest rates of pertussis were among babies one year and under, children 10 to 14 years old, and children 5 to 9. The lowest rates were recorded for children one to 4 years old, children 15 to 19, and adults 20 and older, it said.\n\nAn Angus Reid Institute poll released last month [February 2019] showed 70% of respondents believed vaccines against deadly diseases should be mandatory for schoolchildren. And a B.C. petition signed so far by more than 45 000 people is calling for mandatory vaccination for babies and kids. In its report, Angus Reid notes that reasons for not vaccinating children include philosophical, religious or personal reasons. It notes some parents believe chiropractic practices and naturopathy are alternatives to vaccination, which Health Canada says is not true.\n\nSadarangani said it's rare for people to receive a medical exemption for vaccinations, perhaps for a child sick with cancer, and it's important to immunize those who can be vaccinated to help protect those who can't be, the so-called herd immunity. He said if he would meet families who choose not to immunize, 'I would try to talk to them to find out the reason.'\n\n[Byline: Susan Lazaruk]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[A recent news report (22 Mar 2019) confirmed a 5th case of pertussis in south Vancouver Island (https://www.vicnews.com/news/island-health-confirms-5th-case-of-whooping-cough-in-south-island/).

In fact, all 90 people who have recently come down with pertussis - the official name for whooping cough - in Los Angeles County this year had been immunized against it, according to county officials.\n\nIt turns out that 4 years after someone receives the booster shot in about the 7th grade, the vaccine's protection nearly vanishes, endangering high schoolers such as those at Harvard-Westlake, said Dr. James Cherry, a UCLA expert on pediatric infectious diseases. 'It is not surprising at all,' Cherry said of the recent cases.\n\nThe outbreak is a real-life example of something that experts have been noticing since doctors switched to a new form of the pertussis vaccine in 1997: Immunity wanes quickly.\n\nThe pertussis outbreak raises questions about how to best administer a vaccine when its protection fades so quickly. People now in high school are one of the 1st generations to receive only the new, shorter-lived form of the vaccine, making them test cases for these problems.\n\nThese recent whooping cough cases also serve as a contrast to the measles outbreaks across the country, which are mostly among people who declined vaccinations. In those cases, immunization probably would have prevented most of the illnesses.\n\nLos Angeles County officials announced last month [February 2019] that there were 3 clusters of whooping cough cases among adolescents across the county: 46 students have been diagnosed with pertussis at Harvard-Westlake, where enrollment is about 1600. A total of 18 students there have not been vaccinated against pertussis, but none of them has caught the illness, school spokesman Ari Engelberg said; 10 students at St. Anastasia Catholic School in Westchester also caught pertussis. All had been vaccinated, according to school officials;\n\nUnder California law, children must receive all of their doses of whooping cough vaccine to be allowed to attend school, unless they have a medical reason not to be vaccinated. By the time they turn 6, most children have received 5 doses of the diphtheria-tetanus-acellular-pertussis vaccine, or DTaP. Then they must get a booster before entering 7th grade. The immunizations are concentrated in the earliest years of life because babies are the most likely to die from whooping cough, named for the sound people make when they're gasping for air. 'Deaths virtually all occur in the first 2 months of life,' Cherry said.\n\nBut studies have found that immunity drops quickly after getting the shot. One study from Kaiser Permanente found that protection fell an average of 42% a year after the last childhood dose at about age 6.\n\nThe rapidly waning immunity is linked to the kind of vaccine children receive, experts say. Before 1997, children received a form known as whole cell, which sometimes caused side effects, such as convulsions and severe fevers. So officials switched to the current acellular vaccine, which has fewer side effects but does not provide immunity for as long.\n\nEven the middle school booster, intended to extend immunity, protects about 80% of people who receive it for about a year but mostly stops providing immunity after that, another Kaiser study found.\n\nL.A. County public health officials said the recent cases may be focused in young adults because they are more susceptible to the illness because they received only the acellular vaccine.\n\n'There is no increase in the current overall number of cases compared to past years, but the number of reported clusters has risen in 11- to 18-year-olds,' officials said in a statement to The Times. 'Waning immunity is a well-recognized phenomenon ... [and] seems to be the most plausible explanation for the recent clusters seen by the department.'\n\nSome scientists have suggested that it would make more sense to administer the vaccine in a targeted fashion, such as before an outbreak or when one has just begun. But Dr. Armand Dorian, chief medical officer at USC Verdugo Hills Hospital, said waiting to administer it when an outbreak has begun doesn't make sense. At that point, antibiotics are needed. 'It's too late to do brush clearance. You have to come in with a helicopter and douse a fire,' he said. Dorian said that even though the vaccine's immunity wanes, increasing coverage rates in the community would help prevent pertussis outbreaks.\n\nIn the 2017-2018 school year, 96% of kindergartners had all their doses of the pertussis vaccine and 98% of 7th-graders had received the booster, according to state data. Both of those percentages dropped slightly from the previous school year.\n\nDoctors recommend that pregnant mothers get an additional dose of the vaccine so they can protect their newborns. But only 52% of new mothers in 2016 were vaccinated, according to a report from the California Department of Public Health.\n\nIf vaccination rates were higher, Dorian said, pertussis would not be able to enter a community in the 1st place. The bacterium is much more likely to spread among people who have not been vaccinated.\n\nPeople who have been vaccinated and still get pertussis also contract a less severe form of the illness that is likely to be less contagious. So it's possible that the recent outbreaks originated with someone who had not been immunized, even though the disease is now spreading among people who have been vaccinated, Dorian said. 'Once there's a chink in the armor and that unvaccinated population grows, then the actual protection of the vaccination significantly drops, even for those who are vaccinated,' he said.\n\nThe real concern now is that a baby could contract whooping cough. Pertussis kills about 20 people in the United States each year, almost all of them infants. The last person to die from pertussis in California was a baby in San Bernardino County in 2018. 'It's a cough, a whooping cough, which means it loves to spread,' Dorian\nsaid.\n\n[Byline: Soumya Karlamangla]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Los Angeles county is the most populous county in the US, with more than 10 million inhabitants as of 2017 and is the 3rd-largest metropolitan economy in the world, with a nominal GDP of over USD 700 billion; its county seat is the city of Los Angeles, with a population of about 4 million residents (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_County,_California).

Maine consistently has among the highest rates of pertussis -- also known as whooping cough -- in the nation.\n\nThe state is on pace to nearly match the 410 pertussis cases in 2017, which was the most since 557 cases were recorded in 2014. Maine's pertussis rate of 27.7 cases per 100 000 population was the worst in the nation in 2017 and more than 5 times the national average, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nScarborough, Biddeford, and Kennebunk schools reported pertussis outbreaks this fall [2018], and on [8 Nov 2018] the Middle School of the Kennebunks canceled its annual community Thanksgiving dinner to avoid potentially exposing the community, especially babies and senior citizens, to the disease. An outbreak is defined as 3 or more cases in one location, such as a school, day care facility, church or workplace.\n\nYork county has been a hot spot for pertussis, with 37 of the 64 cases in October [2018] recorded in Maine's southernmost county, including an outbreak at Ninny's House Childcare in Buxton.\n\nHealth experts cite 3 major reasons why Maine is vulnerable to pertussis infections: parents opting their children out of school-required vaccines; the waning effectiveness of the vaccine, which requires a booster shot; and Maine being late to adopt a required booster shot for middle school students. The state didn't establish the requirement until the 2017-18 school year.\n\nDr Laura Blaisdell, a Yarmouth pediatrician and vaccine researcher, said the high rates of pertussis are 'most likely related to low vaccination rates. We can and should do better.\n\nVaccines are overwhelmingly safe and research has proved that they do not cause autism, but myths that the vaccines are contributing to autism have persisted since the late 1990s.\n\nMaine typically has one of the highest rates of parents opting out of school-required vaccines for children entering kindergarten. Opt-out rates increased for the 2017-18 school year to 5 percent of kindergartners for non-medical reasons, on philosophic or religious grounds. Democratic lawmakers have said they intend to introduce bills that would make it more difficult for parents to forgo vaccines for schoolchildren, after Gov.-elect Janet Mills assumes office in January [2019]. Mills has said she's open to bills that would improve 'Maine's disturbingly low rates of vaccination in some parts of the state.' Outgoing Gov. Paul LePage vetoed an attempt to make it more difficult to opt out, and a Legislature override effort fell 5 votes short.\n\n[Byline: Joe Lawlor]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[HealthMap/ProMED-mail map of Maine, United States: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/222]\n\n******\n[5] South Dakota\nDate: Fri 16 Nov 2018\nSource: KDLT News [edited]\nhttps://www.kdlt.com/2018/11/16/cases-of-pertussis-on-the-rise-in-south-dakota/\n\n\nThere has been an increase in the number of cases of pertussis reported.

Of nearly 450 reported cases of pertussis in Maine in 2018, York county had the most, with 174 reported cases. 20 outbreaks were identified in Maine last year [2018], with 9 occurring in York county and 4 in Hancock county.\n\nIn Hancock county, concern about the spread of pertussis last month [January 2019] prompted school officials with Regional School Unit [RSU] 24, which serves 9 towns, and at Ellsworth Elementary Middle School to send out notifications to parents. One case was confirmed at the Ellsworth school, but information about whether any cases were confirmed at RSU 24 schools was not made public.

In particular, the Sioux Falls School District has seen 10 cases in 11 different schools since December [2018].\n\nWe spoke with Dr Joshua Clayton, the state epidemiologist for the South Dakota Department of Health, to find out what you need to know. Nationwide, there are between 10 000 and 40 000 cases of pertussis per year on average. Out of the 27 cases in South Dakota so far in 2019, 18 of them have been in children under 5 years old, Clayton said.\n\nWhy is South Dakota seeing more pertussis cases? Pertussis outbreaks tend to be cyclical, with spikes occurring every 3 to 5 years in general, Clayton said. In 2014, there were 109 cases, but that number dropped to as low as 9 in 2017 before skyrocketing to 162 cases in 2018. 'Every 3 to 5 years we do see an increase,' Clayton said. 'Part of that is due to waning immunity.' Unlike some vaccines, pertussis vaccines are only 85 percent effective, Clayton said, meaning there is a chance people who have been vaccinated will still get sick. Immunity typically only lasts about 2 years before beginning to decline.\n\nMolly Satter, the health services coordinator for the Sioux Falls School District, said 9 out of the 10 cases seen in the district this winter [2018-19] were up to date on their shots. Of the more than 23 000 students enrolled in the district, upward of 98 percent are fully vaccinated, she said.\n\nIn addition, the CDC says getting the pertussis vaccine can help prevent infection and lessen the severity of symptoms, even if you do get the disease. Before the pertussis vaccine was introduced in the 1940s, about 200 000 children contracted pertussis and 9000 died each year from it. Now, out of the 10 000 to 40 000 cases seen nationwide each year (https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/images/incidence-graph-2017.jpg), only 20 people die each year.\n\n[Byline: Katie Nelson]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[HealthMap/ProMED-mail map of South Dakota, United States: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/16863\nSouth Dakota is a US state in the midwestern region of the United States (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Dakota).

The children were born in May and June [2018], and died in a neonatal intensive care unit around a month after their birth. They had been born and received initial treatment in 2 different hospitals and were transferred to the neonatal unit at the Papa Giovanni XXIII hospital after being diagnosed with whooping cough.\n\nLombardy's Councillor for Welfare, Giulio Gallera, confirmed that the 2 cases occurred at different times and geographical locations, but said: 'There is no outbreak [of the disease] in the Bergamo area. The only protection remains the vaccination of mothers.'\n\nHe said that an already planned campaign would begin the [week of 6 Aug 2018] in Bergamo to raise awareness of the recommended vaccines for pregnant women, which include the whooping cough vaccine. Neither of their mothers had had difficulties during their pregnancy or childbirth, but neither had been vaccinated against the disease, l'Eco di Bergamo reported. Tests showed that the women had also suffered from whooping cough, which had not been diagnosed -- in adults, the symptoms of the disease can be similar to those of a common cold or flu virus.\n\nThe whooping cough inoculation was also among 10 made compulsory for Italian children starting at a state school in a controversial law passed last year [2017].

'What we see in Margaret River, is what we see in most of the state, and that is from time to time we have an increase or cluster of cases,' she said. 'That is because it is a disease which is easily transmitted from droplets spread through coughing. So people who are not vaccinated or waning immunity are more likely to get it.'\n\nUnder the WA schedule, children are due to be vaccinated between 6 and 8 weeks old, 4 months and 6 months, before they have a booster shot at 3.5 years old and in year 8. Pregnant women can get a free vaccine shot during their 3rd trimester. Dr Huppatz said although the vaccine was not 'perfect' it was proven to help stop the spread among infants. 'Those newborn kids, who cannot be vaccinated, can end up in hospital and with a serious disease,' she said. 'So everyone getting vaccinated helps protect them.'\n\nIn March 2018, Health Department figures showed the number of cases of whooping cough in WA had fallen 20 per cent since the tragic death of [a] baby 3 years ago. [The baby] was only 32 days old when he died in March 2015 from whooping cough complications, prompting his parents to successfully campaign for a free vaccine for pregnant women in WA. At the time, [the baby's] mum, director of the Immunisation Foundation of Australia, said it was reassuring whooping cough in WA was declining. But she said no one could afford to be complacent because the disease still posed a real risk to babies and young children, particularly if they were not immunised.\n\n[Byline: Mitchell Woodcock]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map of Australia can be seen at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/64511.

According to a press release, 32 cases have been reported to the department this year [2018], and department officials told NBC Montana that 5 cases were reported Wednesday [28 Nov 2018].\n\nPertussis can only be confirmed through a nasal swab test. It's a notifiable infectious disease, meaning cases must be reported to the health department. If a case is confirmed, the patient and members of their household are given antibiotics, Dennison said. The Flathead City-County Health Department will also investigate the case to determine others who might have been in contact with the patient and could be at risk.\n\nDennison said most cases reported to the health department this year [2018] have been among elementary- and middle school-age children. 'We've had multiple schools in Flathead County that have been impacted with pertussis,' Dennison said.\n\nIf a student is diagnosed with pertussis, the school will notify parents. 'If your child is considered to be a contact, you will be contacted by the health department,' Dennison said.\n\nWhile the health department reported an increase in pertussis activity in Flathead County, data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System shows that cases in the state are down from this time last year [2017]. Last year [2017], 98 cases of pertussis were reported in Montana through 18 Nov [2017]. This year [2018], 59 cases have been reported through Nov. 17 [2018].\n\nThe number of cases has trended down nationally since 2012. According to CDC data, 48 227 cases were reported in 2012; 28 639 cases were reported in 2013; 32 971 cases were reported in 2014; 20 762 cases were reported in 2015; 17 972 cases were reported in 2016; and 18 975 cases were reported in 2018.\n\nThere is a vaccine for pertussis, and in Montana, children are required to be vaccinated to enter preschool or kindergarten. Children are also required to get another pertussis-containing vaccine before starting 7th grade.\n\nDennison said adults should make sure their pertussis vaccine is up-to-date. Even if it doesn't prevent the illness, it could mitigate the symptoms.\n\n'It's concerning, the fact that it's so highly contagious and that it is a very dangerous illness,' Dennison said.

'While pertussis vaccines are the most effective tool to prevent this disease, no vaccine is 100% effective,' said Newburn. 'When pertussis circulates in a community, there is a chance that a fully vaccinated person, of any age, can catch this disease, but your symptoms will typically be much less severe.'\n\nPertussis is caused by a type of bacterium called _Bordetella pertussis_. The bacteria attach to the cilia, the tiny hair-like extensions that line part of the upper respiratory system, and release toxins that damage the cilia and cause airways to swell. Pertussis is spread by coughing and sneezing. Infected people are most contagious up to about 2 weeks after the cough begins.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend the pertussis vaccine for all babies, children, teens, and pregnant women. The 2 kinds of vaccines used today also help protect against other diseases: the diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis (DTaP) vaccine is for babies and children younger than 7 [years of age]; the tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis (Tdap) vaccine is for older children and adults.\n\n'Since the 1st dose of DTaP vaccine begins at 2 months of age, newborns are especially at risk for pertussis, a very important reason for parents and caregivers to get vaccinated if they have not already done so,' said Newburn. 'About half of babies younger than one year who get the disease need care in the hospital. The younger the baby, the more likely they will need treatment in the hospital.' The 5 DTaP doses are recommended at 2, 4, and 6 months; 15-18 months; and 4-6 years.'\n\nInitially, pertussis starts with cold-like symptoms, including a mild cough or fever. After one to 2 weeks, the symptoms of pertussis typically include rapid fits of cough followed by a high-pitched 'whoop' sound, vomiting during or after coughing, and exhaustion after coughing fits.\n\n'Babies may or may not cough,' Newburn said. 'A significant complication (along with the cough) is 'apnea,' or a pause in the breathing. In worst-case scenarios, the disease may cause them to stop breathing and turn blue.'\n\n'Pertussis can usually be successfully treated with a 5-day course of antibiotics,' said Newburn. 'A good general rule for older children is that if a cough is not getting better after 7 days, or if there are other characteristic findings consistent with pertussis, it's wise to make a doctor's appointment. With babies, don't wait to seek care.'\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Tuscarawas (population 92 582 residents), Harrison (population 15 864 residents), and Carroll (population 28 836 residents) are adjacent counties in the eastern-central region of the US state of Ohio; New Philadelphia, with a population of 17 288 residents in 2010, is the county seat of Tuscarawas County (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Philadelphia,_Ohio).

An outbreak earlier this year [2018] on the Northern Rivers saw 21 cases within 4 weeks\n\nDr Vicky Sheppeard, NSW Health's Director of Communicable Diseases, said that in October 2018, almost 800 people in NSW were notified with whooping cough (pertussis), the highest number since October 2016. 'Whooping cough is challenging to control at the community level, as it is a highly infectious disease, and immunity against whooping cough wanes over time, regardless of whether that immunity is from having the disease or as a result of vaccination,' Dr Sheppeard said. 'This means that the number of people susceptible to whooping cough in the community builds up over time, and this can cause periodic spikes or larger outbreaks of the disease. The aim of whooping cough control is to protect infants, who are at highest risk of severe disease or death if they contract whooping cough. Whooping cough vaccination is effective in preventing severe infection.'\n\nA GP can test for whooping cough and prescribe antibiotics. People suspected of whooping cough should stay home until they have completed a 5-day course of antibiotics.\n\nSince NSW Health introduced free whooping cough vaccination for pregnant women in April 2015 to protect infants in the 1st weeks of life, there have been no infant deaths from whooping cough in NSW, compared to 4 deaths in the previous 6 years. 'People in close contact with newborn infants, such as grandparents, partners, and close family members, should ensure that they have had a whooping cough vaccine in the previous 10 years,' Dr Sheppeard said. 'Those that need to get vaccinated should do so at least 2 weeks before any infant contact.'\n\nIn May this year [2018], federal health minister Greg Hunt urged all parents-to-be to get vaccinated. His comments came in the wake of the infant who contracted the illness and died when he was just 32 days old.\n\nFor more information, see http://www.health.nsw.gov.au/infectious/whoopingcough/pages/default.aspx.\nFind a whooping cough fact sheet at http://www.health.nsw.gov.au/Infectious/whoopingcough/Pages/factsheet.aspx.\n\n[Byline: Alison Paterson]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[New South Wales, with a population of over 7.9 million residents in 2018, is a state on the east coast of Australia, bordering Queensland to the north, Victoria to the south, and South Australia to the west; its state capital, Sydney, with a population of 5.1 million residents, is Australia's most populous city (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales).

This is the 1st confirmed infant death from the disease since 2016, when 2 deaths occurred.\n\n'This baby's death is a tragedy for the family and for California as a community, as this is a preventable disease,' said Dr Karen Smith, CDPH director and state public health officer. 'This serves as a grim reminder that whooping cough is always present in our communities, and immunizations are the 1st line of defense.'\n\nEach year, 50-200 California infants are hospitalized with pertussis. CDPH and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend that expectant mothers receive the whooping cough booster shot (also called Tdap, or tetanus, diphtheria and acellular pertussis vaccine) at the earliest opportunity between 27 and 36 weeks of every pregnancy, even if previously immunized. Getting immunized during pregnancy boosts a mother's immunity and passes on protective antibodies directly to their babies before birth. This helps protect newborns until they are old enough to begin receiving their own whooping cough immunizations at 6 to 8 weeks of age.\n\n'No baby should have to be hospitalized due to a vaccine-preventable disease, and certainly no baby should die,' said Dr Smith. 'To give babies the best protection, I urge all pregnant women to get vaccinated against whooping cough as early as possible during the 3rd trimester of every pregnancy.'\n\nTo avoid the spread of whooping cough, CDPH also recommends that:\n- parents immunize their babies against whooping cough as soon as possible. The 1st dose is recommended at 2 months of age, but can be given as early as 6 weeks of age;\n- California 7th grade students [should] receive the whooping cough booster, Tdap;\n- adults should receive a whooping cough booster once in their lives.\n\nMore information about pertussis is available on CDPH's website.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\nCanada\n---\n[5] Ontario (Parry Sound district)\nDate: Thu 5 Jul 2018, 7:00 AM ET\nSource: CBC News [edited]\nhttps://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/sudbury/whooping-cough-powassan-health-unit-vaccination-1.4734371\n\n\nConfirmed cases of whooping cough have been identified in Powassan and surrounding area.

Children need 5 doses of DTaP (diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis) vaccine. The series of shots is given at ages 2, 4, 6 and 15 months with a booster between the ages of 4 and 6. Teenagers should get the Tdap (tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis) vaccine around age 11 or 12.

Rather, incomplete coverage among children -- possibly fueled by the anti-vaccination movement -- is responsible for the pertussis increases, along with natural population turnover and slowly waning protection from the vaccine, researchers say.\n\nIn the study published online in Science Translational Medicine, the team found little evidence that the switch in the 1990s from the whole cell to the combined acellular pertussis vaccine contributed to the resurgence in whooping cough [1].\n\nDuring the 1970s and 1980s, an average of 2000 to 3000 pertussis cases were reported annually, according to figures from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) [https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/surv-reporting/cases-by-year.html].\n\nIn 2003, pertussis cases in the U.S. increased to more than 10 000 for the 1st time in almost 4 decades and have not dropped below this number since. In 2012, there were 48 277 reported cases, followed by 28 639, 32 971, 20 772, and 17 972 cases in 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2016, respectively.\n\nThe CDC recommends a series of 5 pertussis shots to be given before age 7, combined with the diphtheria and tetanus vaccines (DTaP), with a booster dose (Tdap) recommended around the age of 11. 'The conventional wisdom has been that the current vaccine may not protect for very long, but we found strong evidence that this is not the case,' study co-author Aaron King, PhD, of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, told MedPage Today. 'A small fraction of people who get the vaccine appear to be capable of being infected again after a relatively short period of time. But this is such a small number that the overall efficacy of the vaccine is quite high.'\n\nThe researchers employed disease-transition models and statistical analysis to examine 3 potential modes of failure: primary vaccine failure; failure in the duration in the waning of vaccine-induced protection with time and failure in the degree of protection, also known as vaccine 'leakiness. We formulated transmission models comprising competing hypotheses regarding vaccine failure and challenged them to explain 16 years of highly resolved incidence data from Massachusetts,' the researchers wrote. 'Our results suggest that the resurgence of pertussis is a predictable consequence of incomplete historical coverage with an imperfect vaccine that confers slowly waning immunity.'\n\nSpecifically, the team examined age-stratified pertussis incidence data from Massachusetts from 1990 through 2005, which was before the introduction of the Tdap booster, employing statistical methods for extracting information from the data that could be generalized to the entire U.S. and to western Europe.\n\nKing explained that the introduction of the 1st pertussis vaccine in the late 1940s led to what the researchers refer to as a honeymoon period where very low disease incidence was seen. The analysis suggested that the resurgence of pertussis in recent decades signals the end of this honeymoon period.\n\nPertussis was a common, and deadly, childhood disease before the 1950s. But the combination of the introduction of the vaccine and natural immunity among a large percentage of adults who had the disease as children led to dramatic declines in incidence.\n\nKing said the cyclical increase in pertussis cases in recent decades does not support the idea that the vaccine is ineffective or that changes in the vaccine have contributed to the resurgence: 'The roots of the resurgence go back 2 decades before the switch from the whole cell vaccine was made. What we are seeing is in part due to the fact that we are not vaccinating enough people and in part due to the decline in adults with naturally acquired immunity.'\n\nHe said that even though protection from the pertussis vaccine gradually wanes over time, it lasts far longer than many in the field have suggested. 'For 90% of people who get the vaccine, immunity is lasting longer than 10 years, and for over half, it is lasting an entire lifetime.'\n\nThe finding that schoolchildren now represent a core transmission group has implications for public health efforts to address the pertussis resurgence, the researchers noted. 'Efforts aimed at curtailing transmission in the population at large, and especially in vulnerable infants, are more likely to succeed if targeted at schoolchildren, rather than adults.'\n\n[1.

The underlying causes have been the subject of much speculation, with particular attention paid to the shortcomings of the latest generation of vaccines. We formulated transmission models comprising competing hypotheses regarding vaccine failure and challenged them to explain 16 years of highly resolved incidence data from Massachusetts, United States. Our results suggest that the resurgence of pertussis is a predictable consequence of incomplete historical coverage with an imperfect vaccine that confers slowly waning immunity. We found evidence that the vaccine itself is effective at reducing overall transmission, yet that routine vaccination alone would be insufficient for elimination of the disease. Our results indicated that the core transmission group is schoolchildren. Therefore, efforts aimed at curtailing transmission in the population at large, and especially in vulnerable infants, are more likely to succeed if targeted at schoolchildren, rather than adults. - Mod.ML]\n\n******\n[6] China (Hong Kong)\nDate: Tue 13 Mar 2018\nSource: 7th Space [edited]\nhttp://7thspace.com/headlines/540411/cluster_of_bordetella_pertussis_cases_in_prince_of_wales_hospital.html\n\n\nThe following is issued on behalf of the Hospital Authority:\n\nThe spokesperson for Prince of Wales Hospital made the following announcement today 13 Mar [2018]:\n\nThree babies (2 male and one female, aged 28 days to 30 days) in a postnatal ward presented with respiratory symptoms since February 25 [2018].

The district was notified [Thu 1 Feb 2018] by South Central Public Health District. 'We are working with local health officials to monitor the situation, and at this time, the school will remain open and operating normally,' Twin Falls School District spokeswoman Eva Craner wrote in a statement.\n\nWhooping cough - also known as pertussis - is also affecting other Magic Valley communities. An outbreak was reported [Mon 29 Jan 2018] at multiple Kimberly schools and it's affecting Minidioka County schools, too. Across south-central Idaho, 13 cases of whooping cough among children or adults have been reported since [Mon 1 Jan 2018]. Those are just cases confirmed by a medical provider or laboratory. Three school districts have been affected: 3 students in Kimberly, one student in Twin Falls and 2 students in Minidoka County.\n\nIt's hard to compare the number of cases with previous years because they ebb and flow, said Logan Hudson, nurse manager at South Central Public Health District. 'It's difficult with pertussis because it sort of cycles.' In 2014, there were 53 cases reported here in south-central Idaho. But numbers dropped to just one case in 2016 and 6 last year. 'We know that (pertussis is) always in the community,' Hudson said. 'It's never not here. It's whether cases are identified.'\n\nThose affected can return to school after 5 days of antibiotic treatment. In Twin Falls, Canyon Ridge High will send home letters to parents with information about the reported case of whooping cough. School employees have been directed to be diligent about cleaning and sanitizing surfaces, Craner wrote in a statement, to help stop the spread of illnesses. Each of the school district's 16 campuses also has a plan to help prevent the spread of infectious diseases. The Minidoka County School District found out about its 2 confirmed cases of whooping cough - both at Minco High School in Rupert - a couple of weeks ago, Superintendent Ken Cox said. Notices in English and Spanish were sent home to parents, he said. 'This is something we take seriously. As soon as it was confirmed, we made sure parents were made aware of it.'\n\nIn Kimberly, students or school employees who exhibit symptoms of whooping cough will be required to go home, Kimberly School District Superintendent Luke Schroeder wrote in a Tuesday letter to staff and parents. They won't be allowed to return to school without written documentation from a health care provider. Twin Falls students who are coughing are also asked to stay home. 'In addition, with flu season in full swing we are urging caution for families and advise that everyone practice healthy habits like regular hand washing,' Craner wrote in the statement. It's extremely important for community members to know the difference between influenza - also known as the flu - and whooping cough, Hudson said. 'Right now, we're seeing both. It's a stronger than usual influenza year, along with pertussis. We want people to go to the doctor for any kind of cough illness, but pertussis tends to last a lot longer,' he said.\n\nSouth Central Public Health District recommends students and teachers should watch for symptoms and update their immunizations if they're not current on the pertussis vaccine. Children are required by state law to receive immunizations before entering preschool through 12th grade schools. But parents can fill out a state exemption form if they choose not to immunize their child. They must cite a reason for their decision such as a philosophical, medical or religious objection. Under state law, immunization requirements include 4 doses of the diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis (DTaP) vaccine for children born before 1 Sep 1999, and 5 doses for children born after 1 Sep 2005. In addition, children entering 7th grade must receive one dose of DTaP. For adults, the Centers on Disease Control and Prevention recommend one DTaP dose in their lifetime. The exception is pregnant women, who should receive one dose during every pregnancy. Oftentimes, people will get a tetanus shot after sustaining a wound or cut, Hudson said, but it may not include the pertussis protection.\n\n[Byline: Julie Wooton-Greener]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The Magic Valley is a region in south-central Idaho consisting of Blaine, Camas, Cassia, Gooding, Jerome, Lincoln, Minidoka and Twin Falls Counties (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_Valley). - Mod.ML]\n\n******\n[2] USA (Wisconsin)\nDate: Wed 21 Feb 2018\nSource: Florence Forest News [edited]\nhttps://www.florence-forestnews.com/2018/02/21/florence-county-pertussis-count-continues-to-rise/\n\n\nPertussis has increased to 17 laboratory-confirmed cases for 2018 in Florence County.

The symptoms start out like a common cold but can transform in serious cases to fits of coughing and a whooping sound while gasping for air.\n\nPleasanton school officials said they are declining to disclose the exact number of cases because county health officials think doing so would make it easier for the public to identify the infected individuals. In all of Alameda county, there have been 98 pertussis cases so far this year [2017], and there were 77 cases in 2016, according to county and state public health departments.\n\nOn [14 Dec 2017], the Pleasanton school system finished emailing notices about whooping cough to families of students in the Foothill classes with a student suspected of being infected, said spokesman Patrick Gannon. The message told the families that students may have been exposed to the bacterial disease and should take steps to minimize the risk and monitor for symptoms, he said.\n\nProtective measures include people getting vaccinations and covering noses and mouths when coughing or sneezing to prevent the spreading of droplets with the contagious bacteria, health officials said.\n\nWhooping cough had been relatively rare in California until an outbreak in 2010, when there were more than 9447 cases with 10 deaths, the most in 65 years in the state. Other states also reported a surge that year. In California, the number of cases declined after 2010, but surged again to 11 203 cases in 2014 with 365 of them in Alameda county, state health officials reported. As of [3 Dec 2017], California has reported 2084 cases. Alameda county has had 98 cases so far this year, according to Alameda County Public Health Department.\n\nScientists and medical experts have suggested the increase in cases may be related to fewer parents vaccinating their children, and the effectiveness of the vaccines wearing off in youngsters as they reach their early teen years. Particularly vulnerable are high school students who have only received acellular pertussis vaccines even if they received a so-called Tdap booster before they were in the 7th grade, according to the state Department of Public Health.\n\nPertussis cases also appear to rise and drop in cycles that last from 3 to 5 years, health officials added.\n\n[byline: Denis Cuff]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Alameda county, with a population of about 1.5 million residents in 2010, is located in the San Francisco Bay Area of the state of California in the United States; its county seat is the city of Oakland, across the San Francisco Bay Area, from the city of San Francisco (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alameda_County,_California).

The best celebration [for the mother] this new year will be enjoying the good health of her baby daughter, who has spent 3 of her 8 weeks of life battling whooping cough. Before Christmas, she was admitted to Planet Sunshine at Gisborne Hospital, where the frightening coughing fits finally started to subside. [The baby] is her 1st child. 'Watching my baby struggling to breathe, her lips blue and her face turning pink, then purple, is terrifying. I wouldn't wish this on anyone. 'When she coughed she would choke. The nurses showed me how to sit her up and rub her back. If that didn't work, I would blow on her face. I couldn't leave her side and I was worried when I fell asleep.'\n\n[The mother an her baby] are not alone, says Margot McLean. New Zealand is in the early stages of a whooping cough epidemic and other areas have also seen a rise in cases. 'In the past 2 weeks, 2 babies have been admitted to Gisborne Hospital with whooping cough.'\n\nWhooping cough causes prolonged bouts of coughing that can end in vomiting or breathlessness. 'It can be very serious, especially for those under one.' The best prevention is immunisation. 'Pregnant mums should get their free immunisation between 28 and 38 weeks of pregnancy. Babies receive their 1st free immunisation at 6 weeks, 3 months, and 5 months. Don't delay with vaccinations, as young babies are the most at risk and need to get their protection as soon as possible.'\n\nDr McLean says [the mother] did the right thing. She was immunised while pregnant, giving [her baby] some protection through the shared bloodstream. This might have prevented [her baby] becoming more unwell when she contracted whooping cough at five weeks, just before her first vaccination.\n\nWhooping cough spreads through coughing and sneezing. People with whooping cough are infectious from 6 days after exposure to the bacteria, when symptoms are like a normal cold, to 3 weeks after the ''whooping'' cough begins, unless treated with antibiotics. Dr McLean says many babies catch whooping cough from older siblings or parents, often before they are old enough to be vaccinated. 'That is why staff from maternity, neonatal and Planet Sunshine teams at Gisborne Hospital are all immunised. If babies catch whooping cough, they might not be able to feed or breathe properly, become so ill they need to go to hospital, and could end up with complications such as pneumonia and brain damage.'\n\nAnyone with a cough that does not go away should avoid contact with babies and young children, and get advice from a health professional or from Healthline 0800 611 116.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Gisborne, with a population of 36 600 residents in 2017, is a coastal city in the Gisborne Region in the north eastern part of the North Island of New Zealand (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gisborne,_New_Zealand).

This August [2017] there are currently 5 confirmed cases in an isolated population cluster to date.\n\n'Contacts of confirmed cases are being tested and/or prophylaxed (treated to prevent illness),' stated Dr Carol Calderwood, Health Officer for Ravalli County Public Health. 'We are working to identify, educate, and treat before more people become symptomatic.'\n\nRavalli County Public Health is working proactively with local physicians to identify close contacts of confirmed cases. A close contact is a household member of a confirmed case, anyone who has been within 3 feet for an hour, or has been coughed on directly. Public Health wants the public to be aware, especially with the current smoky conditions, upcoming flu season, and increased congregation (school, fair, sports, etc.), to take steps to protect themselves and their loved ones.\n\n'We are advising that people experiencing a progressive cough be seen. Also, any person in close contact to a person with confirmed pertussis should be seen by their primary care provider or at a walk-in clinic,' stated Calderwood.\n\nUntreated, exposed people may be spreading pertussis even before they become symptomatic. Pertussis has an incubation period of 21 days. An untreated close contact is able to spread the disease for that period.\n\nContacts without symptoms and taking the 5-day course of antibiotics may continue their normal activities. Contacts with symptoms and taking antibiotics should remain home until all treatment is taken. Contacts not yet taking prophylaxis should remain home. 'If you are a close contact not receiving treatment we are asking that you stay home for 21 days,' Calderwood reiterated.\n\nWith cooperation between Public Health and the community, this current cluster can be quickly contained. Public Health is also working closely with community partners to have proactive intervention plans in place; including exclusion protocols, to help protect our most vulnerable citizens. As always, you may also contact Public Health at 375-6671 with questions or to obtain vaccination.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Ravalli County, with a population of 40 212 residents in 2010, is located in the southwestern part of the U.S. state of Montana; it is often referred to as the Bitterroot Valley, with the Sapphire Mountains on the East and the Bitterroot Mountains and is on the West on the western side of the Continental Divide (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravalli_County,_Montana). - Mod.ML\n\n******\n[2] Michigan\nDate: Fri 25 Aug 2017 11:11 AM\nSource: The Daily Reporter [edited]\nhttp://www.thedailyreporter.com/news/20170825/whooping-cough-outbreak-continues\n\n\nThe Branch-Hillsdale-St. Joseph Community Health Agency [CHA] is continuing their investigation into an outbreak of pertussis -- also known as whooping cough -- in St Joseph County.\n\nThe CHA has treated approximately 233 people for pertussis with antibiotics over the last month [August 2017], according to CHA Prevention Services Director Val Newton.\n\nThe outbreak began in June [2017] with one Amish family and spread through that community.

Pertussis cases have occurred across the state, including multiple outbreaks in Calhoun and Chambers counties.\n\n'Patients should be aware that this is a serious disease that can affect people of all ages,' said Dr Karen Landers, Assistant State Health Officer. 'It can even be deadly for babies less than a year old. That's why it's especially important for parents and grandparents who are in close contact with infants to make sure they are up to date on their vaccinations.'\n\nThe CDC says the best way to protect against the whooping cough is the vaccine:\nAll students 11 [years of age] and older entering the 6th grade in Alabama schools must have a tetanus-diphtheria-acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccine. Each pupil 11 or older who enters the 6th grade will be required to have a new certificate of immunization. This is because of the change from tetanus-diphtheria (Td) to (Tdap) vaccine. The Tdap vaccine will protect adolescents from pertussis and keep them from spreading disease to siblings, other family members and other students. The Tdap school requirement will go up by one higher grade each school year. For example, Tdap is now required for students entering 7th grade through 10th grade in 2014-2015, and will be required for students up through 12th grade in 2016-2017.\n\n- Adolescents who have already received a booster dose of Td are encouraged to\nreceive a dose of Tdap. A 5-year interval from the last Td dose is encouraged, but an interval as short as 2 years may be used if pertussis immunity is needed.\n- All adults should receive a booster dose of Td every 10 years. Tdap is licensed for only one lifetime dose per person. Adults who have never received a dose of Tdap should substitute it for their next booster dose.\n- A dose of Tdap is recommended for adults who expect to have close contact with an infant younger than 12 months of age.\n- Healthcare workers who have direct patient contact should receive a dose of Tdap.\n- New mothers who have never received Tdap should get a dose as soon as possible after delivery. If vaccination is needed during pregnancy, Td is usually preferred over Tdap.\n- Adolescents and adults who require a tetanus-containing vaccine as part of wound management should receive a dose of Tdap instead of Td if they have not previously received Tdap. If Tdap is not available or was previously administered, Td should be administered.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The U.S. state of Alabama, located in the southeast along the Gulf of Mexico, has 67 counties, a map of which can be found at (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_counties_in_Alabama). - Mod.ML]\n\n******\n[4] Alberta\nDate: Thu 24 Aug 2017\nSource: Medicine Hat News [edited]\nhttp://medicinehatnews.com/news/local-news/2017/08/24/whooping-cough-continues-to-spike/\n\n\nThe number of people affected by an outbreak of whooping cough continues to increase in southern Alberta, including Medicine Hat, says Alberta Health\nServices [AHS].\n\nA total of 305 cases of whooping cough (pertussis) have been diagnosed in the south zone, said Dr. Lena Derie-Gillespie, medical officer of health in the AHS south zone. The number of cases only in Medicine Hat was not available.\n\nOf the 305 cases, there are 257 related to the initial outbreak that was in the western part of the south zone, in particular communities that don't have high immunization rates, said Derie-Gillespie, who declined to name a specific community.\n\nMedicine Hat was initially considered a 'cluster' and not considered related to the outbreak. 'In the last couple weeks we are seeing outbreak cases that are occurring outside of that west zone,' said Derie-Gillespie. 'We consider now the entire zone (including Medicine Hat) is part of the outbreak.'\n\nIn an outbreak, most cases are among unimmunized people particularly in children, said Derrie-Gillespie. In diagnosed cases, of those who have been immunized, there seems to be a spike in the kids about 11-and 12-years-old. 'This does not mean that the 11-and 12-year-olds are most at risk to get pertussis,' she explained. 'The younger unimmunized ones are still most at risk.'\n\nThis age group may be experiencing 'waning benefits' from the last vaccine, she said. To address this, those between the ages of 10 and 12 can register to receive a booster dose of the vaccine. Booster doses will be administered by appointment at clinics in Medicine Hat today, Aug. 30 and Aug. 31 [2017]. These will take place at Higdon Hall on the Medicine Hat Stampede Grounds. Clinics will also take place in Brooks on [Wed Thu 30 and 31 2017]. To make an appointment, call the local community health office at 403-502-8215.\n\nPregnant women in their 3rd trimester are also offered the vaccine routinely as their pregnancy progresses in order to offer some protection to newborns, who are particularly vulnerable.\n\nIf you get whooping cough you will be infectious for 3 weeks starting from the early symptoms, said Derrie-Gillespie. With symptoms that could seem like just a cold initially, there is a judgment call about the point at which you need to seek medical attention and a diagnosis. However, take all the precautions you would to avoid spreading germs: Hand hygiene, coughing into your arm and washing your hands regularly.\n\nIf you are not well don't go about mixing with other people in the community, particularly around babies, said Derrie-Gillespie. If you have a cough that is lasting a long time or symptoms that seem a little different to your normal colds, or if you know you were exposed to someone with pertussis, stay home and call your health-care provider or Health Link for instructions, said Derrie-Gillespie.\n\n[Byline: Gillian Slade]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[South Zone, with a population of 281 934 residents in 2010, is the area south of Calgary, the largest city in the Canadian province of Alberta (http://www.albertahealthservices.ca/about/southzone.aspx).

All 3 schools have notified parents through a letter.\n\n'Of course, those students with pertussis are immediately refrained from attending school,' said Lisa Bakos, communications officer with Northern Gateway Public Schools. She added that regular janitorial duties have been scaled up at Hilltop and Pat Hardy to prevent the spread of the infection. Bakos advised that parents read the letter carefully and that students continue to keep themselves clean. 'Hand washing, of course, is always so important in schools,' she said.\n\nDr Kathryn Koliaska, a north zone medical officer with Alberta Health Services, said the levels of whooping cough in Alberta fluctuate year to year and that outbreaks in schools are not uncommon. 'There's obviously large groups of kids together in schools,' Koliaska said.\n\nThe group most vulnerable to whooping cough is babies, especially during their 1st year of life. Koliaska encouraged parents to immunize their infants and for pregnant women or anyone who spends extended time around newborns to immunize themselves.\n\nWhooping cough symptoms include persistent coughing, gagging and vomiting following coughing and spasms of coughing followed by a 'whoop' sound.\n\nHowever, Koliaska said going to the doctor is the surest way to diagnose whooping cough. 'It's very hard to tell the difference symptom-wise from a common cold,' Koliaska said. 'Of course, the test takes a couple of days, so it will also be the conversation at your doctor's office.'\n\nAs of [28 Sep 2017], the north zone has 83 confirmed cases with Alberta having 744 overall.

Epub 2017 Jun 20\n\nSignificance\n------------\nPertussis has been on the rise in the United States, and, in 2012, the United States had the highest number of reported pertussis (whooping cough) cases since 1955. This study provides evidence of spatial clustering of nonmedical vaccine exemptions in kindergarteners and spatial clustering of pertussis cases in children age groups 5 years and younger and 10 to 14 years at the community level. The results suggest that states should reconsider allowing nonmedical vaccine exemptions. The data also suggest a need for the creation of a longer-acting pertussis vaccine or improved regimen and a revised vaccination schedule for the current acellular pertussis vaccine.\n\nAbstract\n------\nBecause of increased numbers of recorded pertussis cases in the United States, this study sought to understand the role of nonmedical vaccine exemptions and waning immunity may have had on the resurgence of pertussis in the United States at the community level. We used geospatial scan statistics, SaTScan, version 9.4, to analyze nonmedical vaccine exemptions of children entering kindergarten in 2011 and 2012 and reported pertussis cases in 2012 for children in age groups 5 years and younger and 10 to 14 years. Eight statistically significant clusters of nonmedical vaccine exemptions in kindergarteners and 11 statistically significant clusters of pertussis cases in children and adolescents were identified and geospatially linked. Forty-five percent of the counties in the study had high rates of nonmedical vaccine exemptions. The proportion of kindergarteners with nonmedical vaccine exemptions was 2.8 times larger in the identified exemption clusters. In addition, 31 counties had geographic clusters of high rates of pertussis in children ages 10 to 14 years old, consistent with waning immunity. Our findings are consistent with the view that geographic clusters of nonmedical vaccine exemptions and waning immunity may have been factors contributing to community-level pertussis outbreaks.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[2] Washington (Grant County)\nDate: Wed 28 Jun 2017\nSource: KHQ [edited]\nhttp://www.khq.com/story/35771723/grant-county-health-district-investigates-confirmed-whooping-cough-cases\n\n\nGrant County Health District staff are investigating 12 confirmed cases of pertussis (whooping cough), with additional tests pending.

To prevent the concern of parents, a health surveillance procedure has been initiated at the Regional Health Agency (ARS).\n\nThe director of the Saint-Jean-Baptiste school (where 247 children are enrolled), Christophe Leuwers, takes the problem seriously but does not want to dramatize: 'What worries us the most are families who have already taken off for the holidays, and they will have to be contacted so that they can arrange a visit with their doctor for a medical check.'\n\nOnly one [additional] case was identified and medically monitored at the Torchy Nursery, located in the social center of the same name. The ARS was informed, and the city provided individual information to families, children and supervisors. Children were also checked for their vaccines. A health watch is being provided by a pediatrician.\n\nIt is difficult to distinguish whooping cough from a cold or a recurrent cough. A parent of a student, who is a doctor, 1st suspected this contamination in the school where a sibling seemed to be infected a fortnight ago. The family has since been followed medically, and the children have been confined to their homes.\n\n[Byline: Nicolas Andre]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Arras, located in Northern France, is 182 km (113 miles) north of Paris, with a population of 43 693 residents, and the capital city of the Pas-de-Calais department, which forms part of the region of Hauts-de-France (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arras).

'We do have over 30 cases that are confirmed,' said Hanley. 'And it does not yet appear to have peaked.'\n\nHanley said it seems outbreaks of whooping cough happen every few years when herd immunity drops. 'Every 4-5 years, you can almost predict that you'll see pertussis popping up in the community,' he said.\n\nIt's important that people know that pertussis is still spreading, and it's useful for people to know how to protect themselves and others. Hanley said there are 3 main pillars for protection: immunization, staying away from others until you're no longer contagious, and using antibiotics to reduce the spread of the disease.\n\nImmunization is the most effective way to lower the risk of whooping cough, said Hanley. It's especially important for infants and pregnant women to get the vaccine, he said. While antibiotics can help reduce the spread of whooping cough, people are still contagious for approximately 5 days after they start the treatment. 'Pertussis is very contagious, and, unfortunately, it's contagious for quite awhile,' said Hanley. He urges people to keep this in mind when they start thinking about going back to work or sending their kids to daycare or other group settings.\n\n[Byline: Jamie-Lee McKenzie]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Yukon is the smallest and westernmost of Canada's 3 federal territories (the other 2 are the Northwest Territories and Nunavut).

In the last 3 months, 14 pertussis cases were reported in Ada County. That's twice the number compared to the same time last year [2016].\n\nMost cases are in kids and young adults between 13 and 20-years-old, and one-quarter are older than 40. Some people had been vaccinated against pertussis and showed a milder cough than the traditional 'whoop' so many recognize. That's why health care providers are urged to test all instances of a cough, according to a news release from St. Luke's.\n\nThe Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology says the number of cases is on the rise. Two thousand and twelve saw a peak with more than 48 000 reported cases. In 2015, nearly 21 000 cases of pertussis were reported. While that's a decrease compared to 2014, annual case numbers are still significantly higher.\n\n[APIC] says there are many factors that may account for the rise in pertussis cases: Not all babies get the vaccination to protect them; Protection against whooping cough decreases over time, and teens and adults can become infected repeatedly; and pertussis rates among adults have risen 400 percent since 1990.\n\n[Byline: Christina Lords]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Ada County, the most populous county in Idaho with a population of 392 365 residents in 2010, is located in the southwestern part of the U.S. state of Idaho (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_County,_Idaho).

The siblings are 2-years-old and 7-months-old, respectively. He added that, on top of isolating the siblings for 2 weeks, health authorities would conduct immunisation tests in the affected area.\n\n'We will test the immunisation status of the people around there and ensure that all of them are vaccinated. We also ensure that these (infected) children are being isolated, so that they don't spread to others until we are confident that the risk of spreading will not be there,' asserted Subramaniam. 'This will usually take not more than 2 weeks,' added Subramaniam, after solemnising the foundation stone laying ceremony of Sekolah Jenis Kebangsaan Tamil (SJKT) Heawood, in Sungai Siput, last week [week of Sun 30 Jul 2017].\n\nPrior to this, Health Director-General Datuk Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah commented on the state of the non-Malaysian siblings as well. According to him, the siblings - who were receiving treatment at the Keningau Hospital - had never received their whooping cough immunisations.\n\nPresident of Malaysian Paediatric Association (MPA), Dr N Thiyagar said some vaccines wear off as children grow older. He added that teenagers in some countries have been encouraged to take vaccinations for the cough. 'We especially encourage teenagers and the elderly to be vaccinated, so they don't become a source of infection for young children,' advised Thiyagar. 'The elderly are also encouraged to get the jab because their immune system would have weakened and make them susceptible to various infectious diseases, including pertussis,' he elaborated.\n\nIn Thiyagar's personal experience, most pertussis cases were among babies who were too young to be immunised. The majority of cases are also made up of babies who fail to complete the 3-dose regime when they catch the infection.\n\nAn internal circular from the Keningau Health Office to the Health Department went viral on [Fri 4 Aug 2017]. It requested that a pertussis outbreak be declared after the detected cases. This leaked memo largely sparked anxiety amongst the Malaysian society. At that time, State Health director Dr Christina Rundi, neither denied nor confirmed the matter. She merely stated that the internal circular was not meant for the public eye.\n\nNoor Hisham advised the public to stay calm as the incident in Sabah was remote. 'The State Health Department has stepped up prevention and control by visiting their homes and giving immunisation to the children,' he said.\n\nNoor Hisham explained that the bacterium, _Bordetella pertussis_, causes whooping cough. This airborne infection, subsequently, causes inflammation of the mouth, nose and throat. It has the potential to infect every individual, but children who are not fully immunised are more prone to contracting this infection.\n\n[Byline: Reshmin Kaur Cheema]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Sabah, with a population of about 3.5 million residents, is one of the 2 East Malaysian states situated on the northern coast of the island of Borneo, bordering the Malaysian state of Sarawak to the southwest, and Kalimantan of Indonesia to the south; Kota Kinabalu is the capital city (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabah).\nKeningau, with a population of about 200 000 residents, is a district and 5th largest town in Interior Division, Sabah (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keningau).

The Forsyth County Department of Public Health is urging people to update their vaccine.\n\nPertussis is a highly contagious but preventable bacterial infection that causes uncontrollable, violent coughing lasting up to 10 weeks. Although easily spread in schools, the disease does not only affect children; adults can develop whooping cough and are often not diagnosed until later in the illness.\n\nSymptoms [include]: Severe fits of coughing, including rapid coughs followed by a high-pitched, 'whoop' sound; Coughing fits followed by vomiting; Exhaustion after coughing fits; Apnea (temporarily stopped breathing-usually in infants). Symptoms can vary by individuals. Contact your doctor if you suspect you or your child is experiencing pertussis symptoms.\n\nState law requires all kindergartners and rising 7th grade students be up to date on their pertussis vaccination before the beginning of the school year. Children under 7 years of age should receive 5 doses of DTaP. DTaP is a vaccine series that helps children younger than age 7 develop immunity against diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis. It is recommended that the DTaP series begin at 2 months of age, and continue at 4 months, 6 months, 15-18 months, and 4-6 years of age.\n\nFor older children and adults a different vaccine, the Tdap, is given. Children 7 through 10 years of age should receive one dose of Tdap if they were not fully vaccinated with DTaP. Adolescents through age 18 should receive one dose of Tdap, preferably between the ages of 11 and 12. Everyone 19 years of age or older should receive one dose of Tdap.\n\nThe Tdap vaccine is highly recommended for the following populations: Women who are pregnant or may become pregnant; Anyone who has close contact with infants under 12 months of age (parents, siblings, grandparents, household contacts, child care providers); [and] Anyone with a pre-existing, chronic respiratory disease.\n\nPertussis vaccine (DTaP and/or Tdap) is available through all state immunization providers, including private healthcare providers, and may be available at no cost for those with Medicaid or no insurance at the Forsyth County Department of Public Health. The immunization clinic is a walk-in clinic and does not require appointments.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Forsyth County, with a population of 350 670 residents, is located in the northwestern portion of the U.S. state of North Carolina; its county seat is the city of Winston-Salem (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forsyth_County,_North_Carolina).

Thirteen years ago, [their son] became ill with whooping cough. At just 7-weeks-old, he nearly died. 'It was awful. He couldn't breathe,' [his] mother said. The memory of that time still brings the Canmore mom to tears. 'I will never forget it - they had to suck out his lungs. A 7-week-old baby and they had to suck out his lungs just so he could breathe.' [The mother] says her son spent 22 terrifying days in hospital, fighting to survive an infection that can be fatal for babies. 'Children can still die from pertussis (whooping cough) even in the care of a physician. We were certainly told that when [her son] was in the oxygen tent and going through that process,' said [the son's] dad.\n\nIt's what health officials in southern Alberta are most afraid of as an outbreak of whooping cough continues more than a month after it was 1st declared. There are 168 cases now connected to the outbreak in the south zone, while there have been 394 cases so far this year [2017] province-wide. 'We have had infants in the past who have died (from whooping cough) at a very young age, so that's what we're hoping to avoid with all of this - we want to protect those most vulnerable,' said Dr. Karin Goodison, Alberta Health Services Medical Officer of Health for the south zone.\n\nThe best protection against whooping cough is immunization, but in pockets around the province, Goodison says vaccination rates are very low. As a result, outbreaks of diseases like whooping cough, measles and mumps have become common.

Notifications of suspected pertussis, also known as whooping cough, and confirmed cases in Central Otago had both increased since about March [2017], Dr Gough said.\n\nShe said in Otago there would normally be 3 or 4 notifications of suspected pertussis, which typically included 1 or 2 confirmed cases, every week. In the past 3 weeks there had been 25 notifications of possible pertussis in Central Otago, of which 6 were confirmed. Most of those were from people who had in fact been sick about a month ago, and the spike had now settled, Dr Gough said.\n\nThere had also been a spike in Central Otago in March [2017], and in Dunedin and Invercargill earlier in the year [2017]. There had been no increase in pertussis this year in Queenstown or Wanaka.\n\nDr Gough said the reasons for the increase could be twofold. The first group of reasons was increased awareness of pertussis, the SDHB asking GPs to report all cases of suspected pertussis, and improvement in the testing for pertussis.\n\nSecondly, there seemed to be a 4-yearly cycle of pertussis outbreaks nationally. The last significant outbreak in Central Otago was about 4 years ago, Dr Gough said. She said it was important to note pertussis was always in the community and its circulation and spikes were normal, although the SDHB was increasingly noticing clusters of pertussis in communities.\n\nBut it was also important to remember how highly contagious the bacterial infection was, and the importance of taking adequate measures if someone got sick with it. People with pertussis were typically contagious for about 3 weeks and could be prescribed a 5-day course of antibiotics. They were advised to stay at home until they had finished taking the antibiotics.\n\nIt could be ''annoying'' to have to stay at home, but whooping cough was very dangerous to young unimmunised babies and to older people and those who were undergoing chemotherapy or had otherwise compromised immune systems, Dr\nGough said. She said some people with pertussis had only minor coughing and might not realise they had the disease.\n\nShe recommended families check their immunisations were up-to-date, and also consider getting influenza vaccinations.\n\n[Byline: Pam Jones]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Otago is a region of New Zealand in the south of the South Island; Central Otago is an informal name for the inland part of the Otago region https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Otago.

The Webster County Health Unit used word of mouth and set up an immunization clinic at a country store last week. In 2 days, they vaccinated more than 300 adults and children.

A total of 22 cases and 66 controls (plus or less 15 days of age difference) were included in the study. Cases were non-vaccinated infants less than 3 months of age at disease onset testing positive for pertussis by real-time PCR. For every case 3 unvaccinated controls were selected. Odds ratios (OR) were calculated by multiple conditional logistic regression for association between maternal vaccination and infant pertussis. Other children in the household, as well as mother- and environmental covariates were taken into account. The VE was calculated as 1 minus OR. Mothers of 5 cases (23 percent) and of 41 controls (62 percent) were vaccinated during pregnancy. The adjusted VE was 90.9 percent (95 percent confidence interval (CI): 56.6 to 98.1).

A 'mini epidemic' of whooping cough has afflicted Canterbury for the past 20 months. Health officials are calling for mothers and family members to immunise themselves as well as their children.\n\nBetween November 2016 and March 2017, 50 confirmed cases and 39 probable cases of whooping cough were reported to the Canterbury District Health Board. Canterbury Medical Officer of Health Dr Ramon Pink said the demographic of people afflicted was similar to a major epidemic, with the bulk of cases in people under the age of 15.\n\nThe last major whooping cough epidemic was in 2012, during which there were more than 100 cases reported in Canterbury in [a few] months. Pink said the situation was an increase above the 'endemic' \u00ad or normal \u00ad infection levels. 'Maybe what we we're seeing is an increase in the endemic level rather than a mini epidemic.' He said infant vaccination levels were very good in Canterbury, at 95 per cent for the last 15 months reported. 'Vaccination, with vaccine-preventable diseases, is still the most effective tool we have.'\n\nPink said the mini epidemic was not a major concern, but it was a reminder to healthcare providers to be vigilant. 'The fact that we have occasional clusters in different communities is not uncommon. And so we would address those as we usually would. We would just be more concerted in our effort to encourage timely vaccination. Which is what we have been doing.'\n\nHe said an area to work on was encouraging expecting mothers to get vaccinated between 28 weeks and 38 weeks of pregnancy. Pink said immunity to whooping cough wanes over time, so adults and teenagers might need another vaccination, particularly if they are going to be around children.\n\n'An adult who has whooping cough is pretty crook, but the real risk for the littlies, particularly down to 1 [year old], since their airways are really tiny.' People with a cold should avoid visiting young babies, he said. 'If you want to be sure, go to your GP and get vaccinated against whooping cough so that when you visit you're minimizing the risk to that newborn.' More information on whooping cough, and who should be immunised and when, is available on the Ministry of Health website.\n\n[Byline: Jamie Small]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Canterbury, with a population of 600 100 residents, is a region of New Zealand, located in the central-eastern South Island; Christchurch is the South Island's largest city with 65 percent of the region's population (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canterbury,_New_Zealand). - Mod.ML]\n\n******\n[3] New Zealand (Bay of Plenty)\nDate: Wed 8 Mar 2017, 5:00 PM\nSource: Bay of Plenty Times [edited]\nhttp://www.nzherald.co.nz/bay-of-plenty-times/news/article.cfm?c_id=1503343&objectid=11814447\n\n\nIn the first 7 weeks of 2017 there have been 7 cases of whooping cough in the Bay of Plenty, 2 of which were babies.

A total of 10 of these were babies, who were at most risk of complications, and 11 were young children aged from 1 to 4 years old. Already this year [2017] small children have been admitted to hospital with the disease. Babies under 1-year-old are at the most risk of serious complications from the illness such as pneumonia and brain damage.\n\nPregnant women could get a whooping cough booster vaccination free between 28 and 38 weeks of pregnancy. This was the time she could pass her immunity on to the baby, helping protect them until they were old enough to be vaccinated against whooping cough themselves as part of their free childhood immunisation at 6 weeks, 3 months and 5 months old.\n\nMr. Shoemack said as children have now gone back to school and preschool, it was a good time to check if family was up to date with immunisations.

Adolescents 11 through 18 years of age (preferably at age 11-12 years) should receive a single dose of Tdap (https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/dtap-tdap-td/hcp/recommendations.html). One dose of Tdap is also recommended for adults 19 years of age and older who did not get Tdap as an adolescent. Expectant mothers should receive Tdap during each pregnancy, preferably at 27 through 36 weeks, because maternal antibodies are acquired by the fetus following maternal vaccination during this time.

'Health Canada is working with First Nations communities to promote the voluntary childhood vaccination program which ensures that children are up to date with their routine vaccinations,' Dr Ibrahim Khan, regional medical health officer for Health Canada in Saskatchewan, said in a press release. 'Health Canada is working with and supporting the efforts of affected First Nation communities in providing enhanced immunization services for prenatal women in their third trimester.'\n\nPAPHR medical health officer Dr Khami Chokani is urging people to check their vaccination status. Health officials said young children who have not been immunized get sicker than older children and adults. 'Our immediate focus is to bring children and adults up-to-date with the pertussis vaccine,' Chokani said. 'It is also important for parents and other caregivers to check their immunization status. In order to help contain the virus, it is important for everyone who can to be immunized.'\n\nChokani added that if people are unsure about whether or not they are up to date with immunizations, they should contact their local public health office. According to PAPHR, people do not develop a permanent immunity to whooping cough and the disease may occur in those who have been vaccinated but symptoms are typically milder.\n\n[Byline: Thomas Piller]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Maps of Canada can be seen at http://mapsof.net/uploads/static-maps/Canada_Provinces_and_territories_map.png and http://healthmap.org/promed/p/4218.\n\nThe Prince Albert Parkland Regional Health Region, located in the center of the Canadian province of Saskatchewan, is one of 12 health regions in the province and is responsible for the delivery of health-care services for a population of 82 578 people, including 12 First Nations people, with a total on-reserve population of more than 9000 residents (http://paphr.ca/about-us); the largest community is the city of Prince Albert, with a population exceeding 44 000.

The entire county had none in 2016.

Stanton said there are no pertussis cases in the Grandview School District.\n\nThis sometimes happens in the spring,' she said of outbreaks. 'Pertussis is not so bad for adults or school age children. The problem is they can have a light case and they give it to a grandparent or the parent of a newborn baby. It's something to keep an eye on.'\n\nMabton School Superintendent Minerva Morales said her district has no cases to date. The same is true in Sunnyside schools, a district nurse, Becky Norem, said.

There are 3 cases at the high school, 2 at the middle school and 1 each at Eagle and Slingerlands elementary schools, county spokeswoman Mary Rozak said. The outbreak is the 1st to occur statewide this year [2017], according to the state Health Department.\n\nOnly 4 of the Bethlehem cases have been confirmed by laboratory reports. 3 students have symptoms fitting the definition of pertussis and also had contact with students whose cases were laboratory-confirmed, according to a note to parents from Jody Monroe, superintendent of the Bethlehem Central School District.\n\nPertussis is highly contagious, and spreads through air droplets after an infected person sneezes or coughs. Infected people can spread the disease up to three weeks after they develop a cough from the illness. The illness is usually not serious, except for infants, said Dr Eric Schnakenberg of Community Care Family Medicine in Clifton Park. 'Typically, this is sort of a lingering cold, it will be kicking around for 6 weeks,' Schnakenberg said. Treatment is recommended, however, to keep the illness from spreading, he said. Serious complications include pneumonia, impaired brain function and even death, according to the state Health Department.\n\nMost schoolchildren in New York must be vaccinated for pertussis. The vaccine is effective, but wanes over time, requiring booster shots. Because the protection decreases over time, even people who have been vaccinated can catch pertussis. 'The immunity tends to wane, so at age 11 we recommend all the kids get a booster,' Schnakenberg said. Booster vaccinations are also recommended for anyone who expects to be in close contact with babies, he said, including pregnant women, child-care or health-care workers, or parents and grandparents of infants.\n\nThere have been no other reported cases of pertussis in the county this year [2017]. Last year [2016], there were 10 cases countywide, and in 2015, there were 5. Statewide, so far in 2017, there have been 119 cases of pertussis, compared to 220 cases at this time last year. There have been isolated clusters and sporadic cases around the state this year, but no outbreaks outside Bethlehem, according to the state Health Department. Schnakenberg said outbreaks are infrequent.\n\n'Since the pertussis vaccine has been available since 1990, there's been a dramatic decrease in whooping cough in this country,' he said. Pertussis does tend to spike every three to five years, however, according to state health officials. The last such increase was in 2012, when more than 3000 New Yorkers contracted the illness. More than 500 of those patients were in Suffolk County, according to state Health Department data. There were 58 cases in Albany County that year, and 168 in the 4-county Capital Region.\n\n[Byline: Claire Hughes]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Bethlehem, with a population of 33 656 residents, is a town in Albany County in the US state of New York.

But the outbreak has since spread to include 32 confirmed or suspected cases of whooping cough, said Salt Lake County Health Department spokesman Nicholas Rupp, putting roughly 180 unvaccinated students at risk for infection.\n\nWhile symptomatic children have been encouraged to stay home, Rupp said unvaccinated students are no longer being 'excluded' -- or quarantined -- because classes are scheduled to end [2 Jun 2017]. 'Now it's more or less everywhere,' Rupp said. 'We've elected to not pursue those exclusions and just let the school year play out.'\n\nRupp said whooping cough is relatively common, with roughly 50 cases reported in Salt Lake County during 2016. The disease ebbs and flows on a multiyear cycle, he said, with the county reporting more than 60 confirmed or suspected cases so far this year. 'We're on the upswing,' Rupp said. 'AISU is certainly contributing to that increase.'\n\nUtah law requires that public school students be vaccinated, but allows parents to declare an exemption and opt out for any reason. The Salt Lake County Health Department recommends schools have an opt-out rate no higher than 5 percent to achieve 'herd immunity,' or the rate at which vaccination is so prevalent the spread of a disease is effectively halted.\n\nAt the American International School of Utah in Murray, the vaccination opt-out rate is 11 percent. Rupp said there is 'no doubt' the high number of unvaccinated children contributed to the spread of pertussis. 'We are struggling to control the outbreak because of that exemption rate,' he said. 'The lack of vaccination is a problem.'\n\nThe health department sent a letter to AISU staff and parents [Tue 16 May 2017], encouraging sick children be treated by medical providers and kept home. The letter also encouraged families to complete immunizations if they had not already done so. 'The most important message is that if your child is not vaccinated, not adequately immunized, please consider getting it done,' Rupp said.\n\nKelly Casaday, AISU's director of operations, said the school's attendance rates have returned to normal since last month's [April 2017] school closure, but the outbreak disrupted end-of-year events like testing, and a choir concert other schools were invited to participate in has been rescheduled. We're going to postpone that two weeks,' Casaday said. 'We don't want to put anybody else at risk.' He said students and staff have been told to assume any health issues are the result of whooping cough and to stay home from school. He also said several parents have indicated they will reconsider their vaccine exemptions as a result of the outbreak.\n\n[Byline: Benjamin Wood]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The American International School of Utah is a 3-year-old public charter school for tuition-paying international and non- tuition-paying local students from grades K-12 in Murray, Utah.

But with the potential for 8 cases in students, KDHE decided this week [week of Sun 22 Apr 2017] to declare an outbreak. Baugher said health department personnel are tracking the cases to find connections among patients and try to find the source.\n\nThe disease was 1st found in a high school student, but most of the recent victims are from middle-school age students at Meadow View Grade School. Baugher said a 4 month old infant [had been] admitted to Labette Health with pertussis. A family member who attends Labette County High School and had been exposed to the disease was in the presence of the infant. The infant was born with respiratory issues and was too young to be fully vaccinated.\n\nTesting continues for suspected cases, but results have been slow to come back. Baugher said her department worked with KDHE, where cultures are tested, and arranged to reduce that delay for those who get the pertussis test at the hospital's lab. Baugher said the tests had been returning in 5 to 6 days. 'If they take a 5-day treatment they're already done with the treatment before we know what caused it,' Baugher said. Because of the outbreak, KDHE has agreed to test cultures immediately when the hospital lab calls ahead. 'As soon as they get it they test it, so we have a much shorter turn-around time. So we cut it about in half.'\n\nBaugher said as soon as the health department is able to connect the cases, KDHE will quit testing.

Whooping cough usually begins with the same symptoms of a common cold like a sore throat and runny nose. It often develops into a severe cough after a few weeks. The cough can last for several weeks or more, according to the Maine CDC.\n\nTo prevent the spread of pertussis, the Yarmouth School Department made the following recommendations: if you or your child has a severe cough, which may include coughing to the point of gagging, vomiting after coughing or difficulty breathing, or a prolonged cough lasting 2 weeks or longer, please keep your child home and contact your health care provider. If your provider suspects pertussis, they will obtain a specimen to be sent for pertussis testing.\n\nChildren and adults with severe cough, prolonged cough or confirmed pertussis will be started on antibiotics and will need to remain at home for five days while taking these antibiotics.

Maternal pertussis immunisation: clinical gains and epidemiological legacy. Euro Surveill. 2017; 22(15): pii=30510. doi: 10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2017.22.15.30510\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nAbstract\n--------\nThe increase in whooping cough (pertussis) incidence in many countries with high routine vaccination coverage is alarming, with incidence in the US reaching almost 50 000 reported cases per year, reflecting incidence levels not seen since the 1950s. While the potential explanations for this resurgence remain debated, we face an urgent need to protect newborns, especially during the time window between birth and the 1st routine vaccination dose. Maternal immunisation has been proposed as an effective strategy for protecting neonates, who are at higher risk of severe pertussis disease and mortality. However, if maternally derived antibodies adversely affect the immunogenicity of the routine schedule, through blunting effects, we may observe a gradual degradation of herd immunity. 'Wasted' vaccines would result in an accumulation of susceptible children in the population, specifically leading to an overall increase in incidence in older age groups. In this Perspective, we discuss potential long-term epidemiological effects of maternal immunisation, as determined by possible immune interference outcomes.\n\nConcluding remarks\n------------------\nMaternal pertussis immunisation is safe for both mother and infant [2,11] and is currently recommended in Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Portugal, the UK, and the US, in response to the rise in incidence [2,18]. Its principal aim is to reduce pertussis mortality and morbidity in neonates. There is good reason to stress the direct benefits of maternal immunisation to both mother and infant. However, its potential adverse effects on routine vaccination efficacy and the subsequent long-term epidemiological legacy remain the subject of debate [11,12,16,17,20-23].\n\nGiven these unknowns, mathematical transmission models can be instrumental in predicting the magnitude and time scale of potential effects of maternal antibody interference at the population level. Our recent modelling study [12] identified a trade-off between the direct protection of infants via maternal immunisation and the reduced indirect effects of herd immunity, leading to a gradual increase in incidence among older age cohorts.\n\nUltimately, quantifying the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of maternal immunisation requires a 2-pronged approach combining long-term clinical trials (such as the ongoing and recently finished studies in the UK, Canada, and the US [18]) with epidemiological and health economics modelling. Longitudinal clinical trials can resolve the immunological effects of MatAbs in response to routine vaccination. Furthermore, such research can shed light on the nature of any interference effect.

Students who have already been vaccinated have been confirmed with whooping cough, underlining the importance of receiving booster shots since the shot does not provide lifetime immunity.\n\nThe school district has worked closely with public health officials since October [2016], when the 1st cases were reported at 2 different schools, said Jorge Quintana, Palo Alto Unified's communications coordinator. Out of an abundance of caution, any student with a cough has been sent home with instructions to be tested by a physician. Students are not allowed back to school until they have tested negative for the disease or received appropriate antibiotics.\n\nThe local outbreak is marked by students who have already been vaccinated, according to the Santa Clara County Public Health Department. The vast majority of cases are part of outbreaks among vaccinated middle and high school students 'because immunity from the vaccines wanes rapidly, leading to cyclical increases in pertussis cases every few years,' county officials said in a 8 Dec [2016] advisory. Booster doses are needed throughout life.\n\nWhooping cough is marked by weeks of severe spasmodic coughing, vomiting and gasping for breath with a deep 'whooping' inhalation. Pertussis has 3 stages, which include with what is called a catarrhal stage of flu-like symptoms, sneezing and occasional cough, (but rarely a fever) lasting 1 to 2 weeks, according to the California Department of Public Health. The coughing gradually becomes more severe and the patient enters a 2nd, or paroxysmal, stage characterized by spasms of severe coughing and whooping.\n\nCoughing, whooping and vomiting decrease over time, but they may return with subsequent respiratory infections. This 3rd, or convalescent, stage typically lasts 6 to 10 weeks, according to the state public health department.\n\nThe disease is especially harmful to very young children, and deaths do occur in some cases. Infants less than a year old might have a shorter 1st stage, but they might gag, gasp or stop breathing, according to the public health department. Their face might also turn blue, purple or red. They might not have the noticeable cough or whoop, officials said.\n\nBecause pertussis is spread by coughing, Quintana said any report of a possible case is taken seriously. The district follows county health department protocol and has communicated the health risks to parents, sending letters to parents at the 3 schools about the outbreak and a more general message to parents of students at all other schools, he said.\n\nThe school district and public health department are currently working to address 'numerous' cases, but Quintana did not provide a specific number. Santa Clara County had 44 cases of suspected whooping cough between October and 6 Dec [2016]. As of 14 Dec [2016], 22 cases were confirmed, according to Santa Clara County Public Health Department officials. That number is not much higher than last year [2015] at this time, however, when 17 cases were confirmed, department spokeswoman Joy Alexiou said. But the number could rise once the probable and suspected cases are confirmed, she added.\n\nThe state health department recommends that infants start receiving the whooping cough vaccination series, or DTaP, as early as 6 weeks old. Even one dose of the vaccine may offer some protection against fatal whooping cough disease in infants, the department noted. Young children need 5 doses of vaccine by kindergarten. Students in 7th grade need to have a booster (Tdap), but adults should also receive a booster shot, especially if they are in contact with infants or are health care workers. Most adults have not yet received Tdap, the health department said.\n\nPregnant women should also receive the booster in their 3rd trimester at the earliest opportunity. Officials recommend the booster during each pregnancy, even when a woman has received the shot beforehand. The booster will help babies during the most vulnerable period after birth until they are old enough to receive the vaccine, officials said.\n\nThe latest information on whooping cough can be found on the California Department of Public Health webpage.\n\n[Byline: Sue Dremann]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[For a discussion of pertussis, please see my moderator comments in a prior ProMED-mail post Pertussis - USA: (CA) fatal 20150115.3093551 and my colleague Mod.LL's comments in Pertussis - USA (07) 20160917.4495935.\n\nPalo Alto, with a population of 64 403, is one of the most expensive cities in the U.

Yet despite the rise, thousands of women are still not being vaccinated, with 40 percent of pregnant women not taking the protection it offers to their newborn child. A regional campaign has been launched to raise awareness of the risks and promote uptake of the vaccine among pregnant women.\n\nWhooping cough \u00ad- known medically as pertussis -- is an infection which can create serious breathing difficulties, particularly in babies and young children. It can lead to major health complications such as brain damage and pneumonia and can be fatal. In the south region, there were 1141 cases of whooping cough in 2014, increasing by over 25 percent to 1432 in 2015. In 2012, 14 babies died in England and Wales following a whooping cough infection. Newborn and young babies are particularly vulnerable, but a highly effective vaccine is routinely available to pregnant women, who then pass the immunity to their unborn child, protecting the baby from birth until they are old enough to receive their childhood immunizations starting at around 2 months old [2 months in the USA - Mod.LL]. The vaccine is given at a GP practice or in maternity units at the point of the fetal abnormality scan, from 20 weeks of pregnancy. Ideally, it should be given before 32 weeks, but it can still be given right up to the point of labor, but with reduced effectiveness.\n\nThe national average coverage of eligible pregnant women is around 60%.

In just the last 2 weeks, over 800 cases of pertussis, also known as whooping cough, have been reported in the state. Already, almost 3500 cases have been reported this year [2016], which is more than all the cases in 2013.\n\nWhile the number of cases is alarming, officials have said that the sickness spikes every 3 to 5 years, and the last time it spiked was in 2010. That makes it very possible that the sickness is spiking this year [2016], which would result in such a large number of reported cases.\n\nWhooping cough is extremely contagious and is spread through the air. Infants and young children are most likely to get it, as adults have been vaccinated for the disease. However, even adults who have gotten vaccinated may still get the disease. 'Unlike some other vaccine-preventable diseases like measles, neither vaccination nor illness from pertussis offers lifetime immunity,' Dr Ron Chapman, director of the California Department of Public Health, said in a statement. 'However, vaccination is still the best defense against the potentially fatal diseases.'\n\nWhooping cough has a number of symptoms. The disease begins with mild symptoms, such as coughing, having a runny nose, sneezing, and other symptoms usually attributed to the common cold. After a week or 2, the symptoms can become worse, and may include a shortness of breath, vomiting, severe coughing attacks, and more. Although some of the symptoms are bad, the disease does not generally lead to death. If a patient does catch whooping cough, he or she is usually treated with antibiotics. The total length of the illness is about 6-8 weeks, although some of the worst symptoms will fade away before then.\n\n[Byline: Clinton Hesler]\n\n--\nCommunicate by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[For discussions of pertussis, please see my colleague moderator LL's comments in prior ProMED-mail posts below.\n\nThe state of California can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at < http://healthmap.org/promed/p/204>.

It is the 1st confirmed death from the disease in Kern County since 2009. 'This baby's death is a tragedy for the family and for our community,' said Matt Constantine, Director of Kern County Public Health Services Department.\n\nPertussis is cyclical with peaks in incidence every 3 to 5 years. In 2010, California experienced a pertussis epidemic with more than 9100 cases, including 376 in Kern County. Another epidemic with more than 11 000 cases in California and 166 cases in Kern County was seen in 2014. Last year [2015], there were 145 cases of pertussis reported in Kern County; 90 percent of those cases were children less than 18 years of age. Of the pediatric cases, 14 percent were in infants who were less than 6 months of age.\n\n'Immunizations are the 1st line of defense, especially to protect those who are not yet old enough to be vaccinated,' said Dr Claudia Jonah, Public Health Officer for Kern County Public Health Services Department. 'We strongly encourage pregnant women to get vaccinated as well as all those who will be in the household of children who are less than 12 months of age. Adults should keep current with their booster shots to reduce the spread of the disease, and all parents should vaccinate their children on time.'\n\nThe Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends that all pregnant women receive a tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccine during each pregnancy. While Tdap can be administered at any time during pregnancy, optimal timing is during the 3rd trimester, between 27 and 36 weeks.\n\nFor infants, pertussis vaccinations typically start at 2 months of age, but adequate protection doesn't occur until about 6 months of age. It is important that both children and adults are up-to-date on their immunizations. Booster shots for pertussis are critical because, unlike some other vaccine-preventable diseases, neither the pertussis disease nor vaccine confers lifelong immunity.\n\n'You know this is a situation where it's not like the parents didn't vaccinate their child. The child is too young to be vaccinated and so it's extremely important for all of the rest of us to be vaccinated so that we don't pass on infection to people who can't get their own,' said Dr Jonah.\n\nTo reduce the spread of pertussis, the California Department of Public Health recommends that:\n- Pregnant women receive a pertussis vaccine booster during 3rd third trimester of each pregnancy, even if they received it before.\n- Infants be vaccinated against pertussis as soon as possible. The 1st dose is recommended at 2 months of age. Young children need 5 doses of pertussis vaccine by kindergarten (ages 4-6 years).\n- California 7th grade students receive the pertussis vaccine booster as required.\n- Adults receive a pertussis vaccine booster, especially if they are in contact with infants or are healthcare workers who may have contact with infants or pregnant women.\n\nThe symptoms of pertussis vary by age. For children, a typical case of pertussis starts with a cough and runny nose for one to 2 weeks. The cough then worsens and children may have rapid coughing spells that end with a whooping sound. Young infants may not have typical pertussis symptoms and may have no apparent cough. Parents may describe episodes in which the infant's face turns red or purple. For adults, pertussis may simply be a cough illness that persists for several weeks. Pertussis can be treated with antibiotics. If you think you may have pertussis, see your healthcare provider right away. Vaccinations are offered at Kern County Public Health Services as well as other locations throughout the county.

[The city of Rochester, Minnesota is the Olmsted County seat and home to Mayo Medical School and the Mayo Clinic.]\n\nThe new recent cases bring Olmsted County's 2016 total to 173, which is by far the most in Minnesota and the highest local level since the 2012 outbreak. Hennepin County [where Minneapolis is located] had the 2nd highest annual total in the state with 62, according to the [30 Jun 2016] report from Minnesota Department of Health; a new state report is expected to be released next week.\n\nWhile more than half of the state has reported zero pertussis cases, Olmsted County has nearly matched Hennepin's total for 3 straight months, including 52 in May, 46 in June and 58 so far in July [2016].\n\n'Pertussis spreads through the air when a person who is contagious with pertussis coughs or sneezes and exposes others close[by],' said Pete Giesen, director of Olmsted County Public Health. 'Although the cough can last more than 100 days, a person is no longer spreading it after the 3rd week or after 5 days of taking antibiotics, which is why it is so important to follow the guidance to prevent further transmission.'\n\nThe local health department says that the pertussis outbreak continues to impact day cares, youth camps and sporting groups. After just 7 cases were counted between [11-17 Jul 2016], that number nearly tripled to dash hopes that the outbreak was subsiding.\n\nPertussis, which is also called whooping cough, mimics the common cold for about a week before symptoms worsen. Coughing often comes in uncontrollable fits that can cause vomiting and is often marked by a whooping-like noise. It's highly contagious and most commonly found in teenagers, but it's considered especially dangerous for infants and the elderly.\n\n[Byline: Brett Boese]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[2] Oklahoma\nDate: Thu 28 Jul 2016\nSource: Tulsa World [edited]\nhttp://www.tulsaworld.com/news/health/oklahoma-sees-increase-in-whooping-cough-as-vaccination-rate-declines/article_1bc1e9cb-4099-56b3-a1db-035c1e609f1b.html\n\n\nOklahoma sees increase in whooping cough as vaccination rate declines.

Known clinically as pertussis, whooping cough is a common, vaccine-preventable disease.\n\nHaley Evans, epidemiologist for the Central Virginia Health District, said whooping cough is a persistent respiratory infection and can be contracted by those who are vaccinated against the illness. 'No vaccine is perfect; vaccinated people can still come down with pertussis,' Evans said. They typically will experience milder symptoms, she said, but still are contagious.\n\nPertussis has a debilitating effect, according to Evans. 'Anyone diagnosed with pertussis would be excluded from school, work, or daycare, until they have completed 5 days of antibiotics therapy,' she said. 'Anyone with a cough that has lasted more than 2 weeks, we would recommend that they see their primary care physician,' Evans said. 'People with pertussis will continue to cough for many weeks after they have been appropriately treated. They are no longer contagious, but we just can't stop the cough; the cough kind of has to run its course,' she explained. Evans added that unvaccinated children and adults are at the highest risk for pertussis, which she described as highly contagious.\n\nIn 2015, there were 334 reported cases of whooping cough in Virginia, according to the CDC 2015 Provisional Pertussis Surveillance Report, released in January 2016.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[3] New Jersey (Morris County)\nDate: Tue 13 Sep 2016\nSource: NJ.com [edited]\nhttp://www.nj.com/morris/index.ssf/2016/09/case_of_whooping_cough_confirmed_at_chatham_high_s.html\n\n\nA high school student was treated over the summer for a case of pertussis, more commonly known as whooping cough, the district said in a notice to parents on Monday, 12 Sep 2016. The Madison Health Department informed the district on Monday, 12 Sep 2016, the student had tested positive for the disease and has since been treated, superintendent Michael LaSusa said Tuesday morning [13 Sep 2016].

According to the state health department, about 9500 New Jersey school children skipped receiving vaccines for the 2015-16 school year. Under state law, children are permitted to opt out of receiving vaccinations for religious reasons.\n\n[byline: Justin Zaremba]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The evolution of new clones of _Bordetella pertussis_, which are less prevented by the current acellular vaccine, and the presence of an underimmunized cohort of individuals may play a role in the number of cases described here. It certainly appears that the current DTaP (diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis vaccine) vaccination protocol (1) results in waning pertussis immunity, which creates a reservoir for _B. pertussis_ that can infect infants less than 1 year of age, and particularly less than 6 months old, who are particularly at risk for morbidity and mortality. Vaccination of the pregnant woman should assist in protecting this susceptible cohort.\n\nA recent paper in Pediatrics (2) included 224 378 children from Minnesota and 179 011 children from Oregon. Both Minnesota and Oregon had very high numbers of pertussis cases in 2010 and 2012. The researchers reviewed 458 of the children in the Minnesota group and 89 of the children in the Oregon group for the full time period studied. Over that time, the number of pertussis cases that occurred rose each year.\n\nDuring the 1st year of follow-up of the study, a rate of 15.6 out of 100 000 children contracted pertussis in Minnesota. By the 6th year of the study, that rate had risen to 138.4 out of 100 000 children. In Oregon, the rate of pertussis in the 1st year was 6.2 out of 100 000 children, which rose to 24.4 out of 100 000 children by the 6th year of the study.\n\nIn Minnesota, a child was twice as likely in the 2nd year of the study as in the 1st year to contract pertussis. By the 6th year, a child was 9 times more likely to catch whooping cough than they were in the 1st year of the study. In Oregon, a child was 30 per cent more likely to catch pertussis in the 2nd year of the study than in the 1st year. By the 6th year, children were 4 times more likely to catch pertussis than they were in the 1st year.\n\nAn additional recent publication, in Clinical Infectious Disease (3), utilized a large cohort of young people receiving all of their health care at the Kaiser Permanente Medical Center in San Rafael, California, USA, and reported that a markedly increased risk of pertussis was associated with those who received only acellular pertussis vaccine. As compared to those who received at least 1 dose of the killed, whole cell pertussis vaccine (prior to the switch to all-acellular dosing), the relative risk of acquiring pertussis was 8.57 in those receiving 5 doses of the acellular vaccine but fell to a relative risk of 3.55 in those receiving 6 doses of the acellular vaccine.\n\nReferences\n----------\n1.

As Dutchess County's Director of Communicable Disease Control Linda Squires says, the number then continued to rise.\n\n'From between [1 Jan 2016] through the current date, we've had a total of 47 confirmed cases of pertussis but, fortunately, we are seeing a decline in the past 2 weeks, with only 5 cases reported since [15 Mar 2016],' says Squires. While the numbers of new cases have waned in the past few weeks, health experts say the recurrence of the disease, in general, is puzzling, and urge vaccination.\n\nAccording to the New York State Department of Health, pertussis is a serious lung infection caused by bacteria. It is also very contagious and causes coughing fits. 'Well, pertussis incidents sort of wax and wane over time and we do see clusters that are not really explainable,' says Squires. 'In 2011 we had 100 cases reported, but between 2012 and 2014 we've probably stayed under 20-30 cases each of those years, so it's variable.'\n\nDr Stuart Feinstein is an infectious disease specialist at Vassar Brothers Medical Center in Poughkeepsie and with Health Quest Medical Practice. 'It's just not something that seems to go away. It seems like every time they get it snuffed out, it's popping up somewhere,' says Dr Feinstein. 'It's been unusual.'\n\nSquires underscores the importance of vaccinating against pertussis. 'Vaccinations are extremely important in reducing the risk and the severity of pertussis,' says Squires. 'The recommendations begin at 2 months of age. And now there's Tdap [tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis] vaccine, which is a booster for adolescents and adults, and is particularly recommended for those persons who are going to be around infants younger than 2 months, so that you could almost cocoon them against pertussis because they cannot be vaccinated themselves.'\n\nDr Feinstein agrees and says the fluctuation in annual cases defies easy explanation. 'I think it's very hard to say why the fluctuation in cases occurs. I know there is certainly an effort, a successful effort, to vaccinate, re-vaccinate adults, to give the Tdap vaccine, and to keep the children on tabs,' Dr Feinstein says. 'It's something that's never been totally wiped out. I think in the last 10 years, there's been waves of it back and forth.'\n\nMeanwhile, Squires says her department a few weeks ago sent an advisory to area health care providers to be on alert for screening and treatment of pertussis. She says the cases in Dutchess County were reported as far south as Beacon and as far north as the Rhinebeck/Red Hook area.

According to the WA Centre for Disease Control (CDC), the rate of weekly pertussis notifications steadily increased over 2015, which the department fears points to another outbreak being due.\n\nThe bacterial infection, which is passed on by sneezing and coughing, is always present in Western Australia but outbreaks occur in roughly 3- to 5-year cycles. There were 1784 cases in the state in 2015, up from 1753 in 2014. The last big spike in cases was in 2011, with 4005 recorded, up from 1446 in 2010.\n\nThe CDC has issued a warning that newborns will be particularly at risk, with more than 80 percent of deaths from the disease occurring in children less than 3 months of age.\n\nPregnant women are being urged to get vaccinated in their 3rd trimester, so antibodies can be transferred to the baby in utero to protect it in the first few months after birth.

The report Mortality and morbidity of pertussis in children and young people in New Zealand: Special Report 2002-2014, was released today by the Child and Youth Mortality Review Committee (CYMRC). It shows rates of whooping cough (also known as pertussis) in New Zealand using data from 2002-2014, for children and young people under the age of 25.\n\nPertussis is a contagious disease, characterised by long coughing episodes. It can be very serious and in some cases fatal. Nearly 13 000 cases of whooping cough were recorded, an average of 992 cases per year, including 8 deaths. 7 deaths were in infants under 3 months old. There were 1515 hospital admissions and more than 75 percent were for infants under 6 months old.\n\nDr Felicity Dumble, CYMRC chair, says that among the easiest and safest ways to prevent or reduce the severity of the illness is to immunize mothers during pregnancy. 'All pregnant women should receive a booster shot in their 3rd trimester and should be given information by their GP or lead maternity carer about where and how to get one. Many women don't know a booster shot is required,' says Dr Dumble.\n\nImmunization during pregnancy is safe for mothers and babies and is now funded during the 3rd trimester.\n\n'GPs and midwives play an important part in education about whooping cough, so it is crucial they take the lead in informing pregnant women about the need for immunization.'\n\nThe Committee endorses the work the Ministry of Health is doing in this area, including the release of new 'let's talk about immunisation' resources and a focus on whooping cough and influenza immunisation during 2016's National Immunisation Week.\n\nThe report also makes a number of other recommendations to reduce the rates and impact of whooping cough.\n\nRecommendations include:\n- giving pregnant women whooping cough booster shots should be a quality improvement measure or target for DHBs [district health boards]\n- booster shots given to pregnant women should be captured in the National Immunization Register and recorded as part of a baby's immunization record\n- the Ministry of Health should develop education resources for pregnant women, lead maternity carers and other health care providers on the benefits of immunization against whooping cough during pregnancy (work on this is already underway)\n- DHB-funded community antenatal education classes should include information about the need for a whooping cough booster shot in the 3rd trimester\n- when confirming a woman is pregnant, their GP or other provider should put in place a plan to ensure they are recalled for a pertussis booster shot in their 3rd trimester\n- a national system should be developed that enables general practices, lead maternity carers and other immunization providers to communicate with each other on whooping cough booster shots given to pregnant women\n- lead maternity carers and other health care providers should ensure pregnant women are aware that they need a whooping cough booster in their 3rd trimester and they know where to go to get it\n- pregnant women should be offered whooping cough booster shots in a wide range of settings, including general practice, secondary care and outreach community settings, to reduce access barriers for hard-to-reach groups.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The full commission report can be found at http://www.hqsc.govt.nz/assets/CYMRC/Publications/pertussis-special-report-Dec-2015.pdf.\n\nNeonatal pertussis is observed to be especially severe, with as much as a 3 percent risk of death.

All adults are also advised to obtain the vaccination if they have not had the vaccination. Residents are advised to check with their health care provider or call the health department if they are uncertain about their vaccination status.\n\nProwers County Public Health and Environment will be offering clinic times to ensure that residents, including children and adults, who need vaccination can make an appointment to come in. These clinics are an ongoing effort to prevent the further spread of pertussis in Prowers County and possible spread to other counties and states. Children will not be denied due to inability to pay.\n\n'Vaccination is the safest and most effective tool against pertussis,' said Director of Public Health, Tammie Clark, RN, BSN. 'We are continuing to work with the healthcare providers and the community, to prevent the further spread of pertussis. Our work focuses on increasing vaccination rates, particularly in adults and adolescents, and preventing transmission to vulnerable populations, where the disease can have devastating results, such as pregnant women, infants, and those with weakened immune systems.\n\n'Pertussis is a vaccine-preventable disease that is also known as whooping cough, or the '100-day cough.' It is highly contagious and caused by a bacterial infection of the respiratory tract. People with suspected or confirmed diagnosis of pertussis should stay home from work, school, or childcare until they have been on antimicrobials for at least 5 days.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[It is not stated if the mother of the 8-week-old infant diagnosed with pertussis had received pertussis immunization during the 2nd or 3rd trimester, which will dramatically decrease the incidence of this infection in such young infants, who represent the most vulnerable age group for morbidity and mortality.\n\nNeonatal pertussis is observed to be especially severe, with as much as a 3 percent risk of death.

'There will be an immediate effect.' Under the law signed by Gov. Jerry Brown in July 2015, all children will have to be vaccinated against a variety of infectious diseases before they enter school or day care, unless they have a medical exemption signed by a licensed physician. Children with personal-belief exemptions on file prior to 1 Jan 2016, will be able to stay in school, but will have to meet the requirements of the new law before advancing from preschool to elementary school (grades K-6) or from elementary school to secondary school (grades 7-12). All new students would be subject to the new law after 1 Jul 2016.\n\nSB 277 applies to public and private schools, including elementary and secondary schools, day-care centers and nursery schools.\nCountywide, private schools tended to have higher personal-belief exemption rates than public schools, and it was in those schools with high exemption rates where outbreaks of infectious diseases like pertussis were most likely to occur, Chapman said.\n\nStatewide, infants under the age of 1 and teens between the ages of 14 and 17 had the highest pertussis rates in 2015. Among residents of all ages, only Humboldt County had a higher incident rate than Yolo County. As of the end of November 2015, Yolo had documented 80 pertussis cases, for an incident rate of 38.8 per 100 000 residents. 'It's bad,' Chapman noted.\n\nThe reason why is not clear, he said, but Yolo is among a cluster of Northern California counties, the others being Marin, Sonoma and Napa, where pertussis rates have been higher than the rest of the state for the past 2 years. 'There seems to be a geographic area with higher rates,' Chapman said, 'but it's not totally clear why. I don't have an explanation.'\n\nThe good news is that cases of pertussis in Yolo County decreased from 147 in 2014 to 80 by the end of November 2015. However, given that the county historically had fewer than 5 cases annually, 'the rate is still high,' Chapman said. He expects the new state law not only will reduce the number of pertussis cases being seen locally but also other childhood infectious diseases like measles and chicken pox, and that's good news for those most vulnerable to infectious disease.\n\nNewborns, for example, cannot receive their 1st pertussis vaccine until they are 6 weeks old and remain particularly vulnerable to infection. Of the 176 pertussis cases that resulted in hospitalization in California in 2015, 70 percent (120) were infants under the age of 4 months.\n\n[Byline: Anne Ternus-Bellamy]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[State laws such as the new California law can go a long way in decreasing the incidence of vaccine-preventable diseases ONLY if physicians do not sign medical exemptions on request of parents for children who truly do not have a real medical reason for the exemption.\n\nThe location of Yolo County in the state of California can be found on a map at: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yolo_County,_California#/media/File:Map_of_California_highlighting_Yolo_County.svg. - Mod.LL]\n\n*****\n[3] Ohio (Franklin County)\nDate: Wed 23 Dec 2015\nSource: This Week News [edited]\nhttp://www.thisweeknews.com/content/stories/grandview/news/2015/12/22/whooping-cough-sweeps-through-schools.html\n\n\nWhooping cough sweeps through schools\n-----------\nGrandview Heights City School District officials are asking parents to help them contain a highly contagious disease. 21 cases of pertussis, also called whooping cough, have been reported in the district starting with the school year. Students at the high school and Edison Intermediate/Larson Middle School have been impacted. There have been no cases reported at Stevenson Elementary School.\n\n'It's an outbreak, not an epidemic,' school nurse Mary Mauro said. 'I do think it's interesting that we haven't had a case at the elementary school,' she said. 'Usually that is where you might expect to see it.' In a typical year, few if any cases are reported, Mauro said.\n\nThe cases have been spread throughout grade levels at the high school, with 2 seniors, 4 juniors, 3 sophomores and a freshman diagnosed.\nAt Edison/Larson, 7 8th-graders and 4 4th-grade students have come down with whooping cough.\n\nThe outbreak of the disease is not unique to Grandview, Superintendent Andy Culp said. 'We're just representative of what is happening statewide,' he said.\n\nPertussis is highly contagious and spread through the air by coughing and sneezing, Mauro said. The 1st case in Grandview was diagnosed in September 2015, Mauro added. 'It's 1 or maybe 2 or 3 cases identified in a week, then a couple weeks go by before we see another case,' she said.\n\nParents should make sure their children are up to date on immunizations, Mauro said. But the immunity from vaccinations decreases over time, and most of the Grandview students diagnosed with pertussis were up to date in their vaccines, she said.\n\n[Byline: Alan Froman]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The evolution of new clones of _B. pertussis_, which are less prevented by the current acellular vaccine, and the presence of an underimmunized cohort of individuals may play a role in the number of cases described here. It certainly appears that the current DTaP (diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis vaccine) vaccination protocol (1) results in waning pertussis immunity, which creates a reservoir for _B. pertussis_ that can infect infants less than 1 year of age, and particularly less than 6 months old, who are particularly at risk for morbidity and mortality. Vaccination of the pregnant woman should assist in protecting this susceptible cohort.\n\nA recent paper in Pediatrics (2) included 224 378 children from Minnesota and 179 011 children from Oregon. Both Minnesota and Oregon had very high numbers of pertussis cases in 2010 and 2012. The researchers reviewed 458 of the children in the Minnesota group and 89 of the children in the Oregon group for the full time period studied. Over that time, the number of pertussis cases that occurred rose each year.\n\nDuring the 1st year of follow-up of the study, a rate of 15.6 out of 100 000 children contracted pertussis in Minnesota. By the 6th year of the study, that rate had risen to 138.4 out of 100 000 children. In Oregon, the rate of pertussis in the 1st year was 6.2 out of 100 000 children, which rose to 24.4 out of 100 000 children by the 6th year of the study.\n\nIn Minnesota, a child was twice as likely in the 2nd year of the study as in the 1st year to contract pertussis. By the 6th year, a child was 9 times more likely to catch whooping cough than they were in the 1st year of the study. In Oregon, a child was 30 percent more likely to catch pertussis in the 2nd year of the study than in the 1st year. By the 6th year, children were 4 times more likely to catch pertussis than they were in the 1st year.\n\nAn additional recent publication, in Clinical Infectious Disease (3), utilized a large cohort of young people receiving all of their health care at the Kaiser Permanente Medical Center in San Rafael, California, USA, and reported that a markedly increased risk of pertussis was associated with those who received only acellular pertussis vaccine. As compared to those who received at least 1 dose of the killed, whole cell pertussis vaccine (prior to the switch to all-acellular dosing), the relative risk of acquiring pertussis was 8.57 in those receiving 5 doses of the acellular vaccine but fell to a relative risk of 3.55 in those receiving 6 doses of the acellular vaccine.\n\nReferences\n----------\n1.

The [President of the Community of Madrid], Cristina Cifuentes, said that the decision responds to the recommendations of experts from the Vaccine Advisory Committee and indications agreed to by the Public Health Commission of the Interterritorial Council of the National Health Service, after assessing the nationwide increase in cases of whooping cough in recent years and the highest incidence in children younger than 1 year, an age group in which the disease can be severe.\n\nThe new vaccination strategy of the Community of Madrid includes pertussis vaccine for pregnant women in the 3rd trimester of pregnancy (between weeks 28 and 36). It is safe for pregnant women and protects the baby early in life until the immunization sequence for pertussis (combined with tetanus and diphtheria toxoids - Mod.LL] begins, with doses at 2, 4, 6, and 18 months of age. A booster is administered at 6 years of age. However, following the recommendations of experts, Madrid plans to adjust the calendar as a result of the worldwide shortage of vaccine and is expected to suspend temporarily the dose given at 6 years of age until the situation is resolved. The disease is far more deadly in infants than in children who have already received the initial doses.\n\nAccording to the National Epidemiology Center (NEC), until October 2015, the cumulative number of pertussis cases nationwide was 6816, almost triple compared to those recorded during the same period of the previous 5 years. Regional reports show data along the same lines. For example, in Aragon, in 2015 there has been a remarkable increase in the incidence (71 so far in 2015, against the 12 expected). If during the period between 2000 and 2006 an average of 1 death per year was recorded, between 2011 and 2014, the average annual deaths increased to 5.5, all young infants. So far in 2015, there have been 4 known deaths, according to the National Epidemiology Center.\n\nThe Spanish Society of Gynecology and Obstetrics (SEGO) already warned of the surge of cases a year ago after conducting a study of prevalence of the disease. It is for this reason that the recommendation to vaccinate all pregnant to avoid infection in newborns was established. 'There has been an increase in cases because there are women from other countries who have not been vaccinated or because there is a tendency not to vaccinate,' explains Jose Maria Lailla, professor of gynecology at the University of Barcelona.\n\nThere are 7 autonomous communities in Spain that recommend vaccination between weeks 27 and 36 of gestation (Catalonia, Asturias, Navarra, Valencia, Basque Country, Canary Islands, and Extremadura) after it was observed that in recent years, the incidence in Spain has increased to 325 cases per 100 000 in infants under 30 days old. The line followed by these regions is similar to that of other European countries, such as the UK, that follow the same recommendation\n\n[Byline: Rocio Ruiz]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-ESP\n<promed-esp@promedmail.org>\n\n[Neonatal pertussis is observed to be especially severe with as much as a 3 percent risk of death.

At the beginning of October 2015, there were about 40 cases. Since then, that number has tripled. Whooping cough is a highly contagious bacterial infection that affects the lungs and upper respiratory system, releasing toxins that cause inflammation and swelling.\n\nThe Mauricie-Central Quebec outbreak has mostly affected young children. Close to a dozen elementary schools, 2 high schools and at least 10 daycare centers in the region reported cases of whooping cough earlier this fall. The outbreak is already 4 times the annual average.\n\nBabies are at the highest risk of complications from pertussis, and they most often are infected by adult caregivers who might not realize they're infected. It takes 2 weeks to get the results of a test for pertussis, and because of that, public health authorities in the region have told doctors to advise patients to stay at home if whooping cough is suspected until they receive a firm diagnosis.\n\nIn Canada, between 1000 and 3000 people a year contract whooping cough, according to the Public Health Agency of Canada. Worldwide, the airborne bacterium that causes the illness affects 20 to 40 million people annually, killing some 400 000 people each year.\n\nThere is a vaccine for whooping cough which prevents the disease or, at least, leads to fewer complications. Quebec's Health Ministry recommends that all children be vaccinated with a 1st shot at 2 months. Children must receive 5 shots in all to be protected from the disease: at 2 months, 4 months, 6 months and 18 months, then a final booster between the age of 4 and 6. Teens receive a 6th dose of the vaccine in their 3rd year of high school. Adults need to get a one-time booster as well to be fully protected. The whooping cough booster is a combination vaccine, with diphtheria and tetanus. Once an adult receives the combination booster, they still need a further booster for diphtheria and tetanus once every 10 years.\n\n[Byline: Jae C. Hong]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[2] Canada\nDate: Thu 12 Nov 2015\nSource: Canadian Press [edited]\nhttps://blackburnnews.com/bri-lifestyle/2015/11/12/parts-of-canada-seeing-spikes-in-whooping-cough/\n\n\nSeveral provinces and at least one territory are experiencing outbreaks of pertussis, better known as whooping cough, and public health officials are encouraging Canadians of all ages to make sure their vaccinations are up to date. The bacterial infection, which often but not always causes a 'whoop' sound when breathing or coughing, is particularly dangerous for very young babies, say doctors. The disease can lead to hospitalization and, in rare cases, death.\n\nManitoba is dealing with an outbreak of pertussis in its southern region, where 44 of the province's 51 cases so far in 2015 have been reported. Most of those who developed the infection had not been inoculated against pertussis, which is included in a vaccine that typically also protects against diphtheria, tetanus and polio. Some provinces also include _Haemophilus influenzae_ type B vaccine (Hib) or hepatitis B vaccine in the shot.\n\n'You have outbreaks from time to time, but we're usually around 10 per year, so this is significant,' Dr. Michael Routledge, Manitoba's chief public health officer, said Thursday, 12 Nov 2015, from Winnipeg. Most of those who got sick were young children, but some teens and adults also contracted the infection, Routledge added. 'We're concerned this is happening in kids who are quite young, and they can have serious complications from it.' While the disease is endemic, or always present in the community to some extent, outbreaks tend to be cyclical, with a spike in cases every 2 to 5 years.\n\nNew Brunswick has also been dealing with a pertussis outbreak. The province has recorded 56 confirmed cases in 2015, all in the Greater Moncton area, including 4 new cases reported between 6 Nov 2015 and 12 Nov 2015 in residents aged 9 to 24, a spokesman said. The Northwest Territories has also had a jump in whooping cough cases in 2015.\n\nWhile Ontario has had some isolated outbreaks, Dr. Shelley Deeks said 2015 has 'not been a huge year' for pertussis, at least compared to some previous years. Deeks, medical director of immunization and vaccine-preventable diseases, said Public Health Ontario has received reports of about 500 cases to date, far below the peak of more than 1200 cases recorded in 2006. Deeks said: 'So adults should talk to their physicians and make sure they receive a dose of pertussis [vaccine],' she said, noting that the shot would typically also contain diphtheria and tetanus components. 'It's really important for their health, but the other thing we know is that parents and grandparents are an important source of pertussis for babies. And because the disease can be quite severe in infants, we want to make sure adults are protected for it so they don't pass it onto their children, especially newborns.'\n\nBritish Columbia is also seeing a bit of a jump in whooping cough in 2015, with double the number of cases reported in 2012, but half the case count in 2000, reflecting the cyclical nature of the infection, said Dr. Danuta Skowronski, an infectious disease expert at the BC Center for Disease Control. The highest proportion of cases in BC is among pre-teens aged 10 to 13, suggesting that waning immunity could be at play, as children that age would have had their most recent dose as 4 to 6 year olds, said Skowronski. While the goal of public health officials isn't to eradicate pertussis -- an impossible goal given its endemic nature -- it's not clear how more consistent protection can be achieved. Giving boosters more often would be like 'chasing a moving target,' Skowronski said. 'Do you add more doses? Or are we approaching the kind of program like we have with influenza ... where you have to give it annually or at least every few years?'\n\nBecause about 80 per cent of the serious outcomes due to whooping cough occur in babies under 3 months, Skowronski believes that's where the primary focus of immunization should be placed. 'It's most important that we get that 1st dose into children in a timely way, without delaying. Parents should be on that.' At the same time, drug companies may need to come up with a better vaccine that could be given sooner than 2 months old, offering earlier protection, she said. 'We're getting signals now of concern that we need to address, and especially if we are accumulating cohorts (groups) of children with waning immunity,' Skowronski said of the outbreaks. 'It's not scary monsters right now. But we want to look to the future and anticipate if this gets higher yet with the next cyclical peak. And what are the options that we might implement to try to mitigate that?'\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[In the latest Public Health Agency of Canada's Update on Pertussis Vaccination in Pregnancy http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/naci-ccni/acs-dcc/2014/pvip-vcpg_0214-eng.php, last published in 2014, it is stated:\n\n'National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) does not recommend a universal program for vaccination of pregnant women given the current epidemiology in Canada.\n\n'In special circumstances, such as a regional outbreak situation, immunization with Tdap may be offered to pregnant women (26 weeks or more of gestation) irrespective of their immunization history.\n\n'Every effort should be made to administer one dose of pertussis containing vaccine in adulthood. Therefore, one dose of combined diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis containing vaccine (Tdap) can be offered to pregnant women (at 26 weeks of gestation or more) who have not been previously vaccinated against pertussis in adulthood.'\n\nIn the USA, however, the CDC Advisory Committee on Immunization (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6207a4.htm) states: 'In October 2011, in an effort to reduce the burden of pertussis in infants, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended that unvaccinated pregnant women receive a dose of tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis vaccine (Tdap). Vaccination of women with Tdap during pregnancy is expected to provide some protection to infants from pertussis until they are old enough to be vaccinated themselves. Tdap given to pregnant women will stimulate the development of maternal antipertussis antibodies, which will pass through the placenta, likely providing the newborn with protection against pertussis in early life, and will protect the mother from pertussis around the time of delivery, making her less likely to become infected and transmit pertussis to her infant. The 2011 Tdap recommendation did not call for vaccinating pregnant women previously vaccinated with Tdap. On 24 Oct 2012, ACIP voted to recommend use of Tdap during every pregnancy. This report summarizes data considered and conclusions made by ACIP and provides guidance for implementing its recommendations. These updated recommendations on use of Tdap in pregnant women aim to optimize strategies for preventing pertussis morbidity and mortality in infants.'\n\nMost of the morbidity and mortality from pertussis occurs in infants less than 6 months of age, especially neonates.

The infant had her 1st whooping cough vaccination at 2 months of age. A month later, she started to cough. 'It really just started with a cough here and then and then progressively got worse throughout the day.' The mother took her to the walk-in clinic. The doctor did a swab, and 2 days later, she was diagnosed.\n\nAnd she's not alone. Manitoba Health says the Southern Regional Health Authority [RHA] would typically see a handful of cases per year. But in 2015, there are more than 40 cases.\n\nWhooping cough (pertussis) is highly contagious disease that can cause severe coughing spells with a 'whoop' sound between as people try to take a big breath. The cough can last 6 to 12 weeks. It is most common among infants.\n\nDr Tim Hilderman, Manitoba's Medical Officer of Health for Vaccines, says in some cases it can be life-threatening. 'One of the most complications is a severe pneumonia that can result in hospitalization and, in rare cases, death.'\n\nThis infant had to be hospitalized. 'We went over to the Children's Hospital where they put her in isolation and then because she was not breathing. There are a few times where she would go blue. They put us into 24-hour monitoring and isolation, so we were in a plastic-wrapped room basically and they were all gowning up... It was pretty horrible for us,' she said. The infant was in the 'danger zone' for 2 days and was in the hospital for a week.\n\nHilderman says pertussis is cyclical -- there was a larger outbreak in Manitoba in 2012. But he says most of the patients they are seeing in the Southern RHA are not vaccinated. Others, like this infant, have had some of the vaccine. But immunity built up over time. So he says cases are more prevalent among infants less than 6 months, even those following the vaccine schedule, like this infant.\n\n'They haven't had enough vaccine and enough time to build up that immunity so this is where it become very important to have high levels of immunization in a community to prevent spread,' he said. 'I think what we're learning here is that the coverage rates that we have aren't high enough to prevent these kinds of clusters or outbreaks from occurring. It's very difficult for me to say whether or not that's a phenomenon that's due to the rate today or whether that's more of a phenomenon of the cyclical nature of the disease and the rates over time,' he said.\n\nHilderman says adults who haven't been vaccinated should get a booster shot. He says they also try to boost infant caregivers as well.\n\n[Byline: Kim Lawson]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[2] Northwest Territories\nDate: Tue 3 Nov 2015\nSource: CBC (Canadian Broadcasting Corporation) News [edited]\nhttp://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/range-lake-north-school-student-diagnosed-with-whooping-cough-1.3302740\n\n\nHealth officials are warning parents and guardians of children at Range Lake North School in Yellowknife [Northwest Territories, NT] that their child may have been exposed to a student with whooping cough. The school sent out a letter today [3 Nov 2015] about the bacterial infection, also called pertussis, which is transmitted though sneezing and coughing. Symptoms include a persistent cough, fever, runny nose, and sneezing.\n\nThe risk of serious and sometimes deadly complications is highest in babies and young children, especially those who have not been vaccinated. The Public Health Agency of Canada recommends adults be immunized against whooping cough if they are in regular contact with an infant.\n\nThe pertussis vaccine is part of the routine NT immunization schedule, but according to the health authority the protection from immunizations can start to wane or be less effective by age 9 or 10. The immunization schedule calls for booster vaccinations for tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis in Grade 9 and every 10 years for adults over 18.\n\nA similar letter was sent out to parents of students attending Yellowknife's William McDonald school in September 2015 after a child at that school was diagnosed with pertussis.\n\nAlberta Health Services declared a pertussis outbreak in northern Alberta in August 2015.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[3] New Brunswick\nDate: Thu 29 Oct 2015\nSource: CBC (Canadian Broadcasting Corporation) News [edited]\nhttp://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/whooping-cough-outbreak-1.3293947\n\n\nDr Yves Lager, the medical officer of health in the eastern region, released the updated numbers on the whooping cough outbreak on Thursday morning, 29 Oct 2015. He said most of the whooping cough, or pertussis, cases are in the greater Moncton area [southeastern New Brunswick].\n\n'The profile of the cases we've seen in the last week remains really similar to what we've seen so far in this outbreak,' said Lager. 'Most cases have been in children and adolescents. Most cases for which we have vaccine information indicates that they are up to date with their pertussis vaccine.'\n\nLager said with this outbreak, public health has been closely monitoring its supply of the vaccines due to an increase in demand. 'We've received a large shipment on [Tue 27 Oct 2015], which will be more than enough to meet both our routine and outbreak needs,' said Lager. Approximately 12 000 doses of whooping cough vaccine were delivered in that shipment.\n\nWhile confirmed cases have been reported among people who have been vaccinated, Lager said that likely has to do with a decreased effectiveness. He said this can happen as people get closer to the time when they are due for their next pertussis booster immunization.\n\nLager said the number of confirmed cases in October 2015 is similar to the number of confirmed cases in September 2015.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[In the latest Public Health Agency of Canada's Update on Pertussis Vaccination in Pregnancy http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/naci-ccni/acs-dcc/2014/pvip-vcpg_0214-eng.php published in 2014, it is stated:\n\n'National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) does not recommend a universal program for vaccination of pregnant women given the current epidemiology in Canada.\n\nIn special circumstances, such as a regional outbreak situation, immunization with Tdap may be offered to pregnant women (26 weeks or more of gestation) irrespective of their immunization history.\n\nEvery effort should be made to administer one dose of pertussis containing vaccine in adulthood. Therefore, one dose of combined diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis containing vaccine (Tdap) can be offered to pregnant women (at 26 weeks of gestation or more) who have not been previously vaccinated against pertussis in adulthood.'\n\nIn the USA, however, the CDC Advisory Committee on Immunization (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6207a4.htm) states:\n'In October 2011, in an effort to reduce the burden of pertussis in infants, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended that unvaccinated pregnant women receive a dose of tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis vaccine (Tdap). Vaccination of women with Tdap during pregnancy is expected to provide some protection to infants from pertussis until they are old enough to be vaccinated themselves. Tdap given to pregnant women will stimulate the development of maternal antipertussis antibodies, which will pass through the placenta, likely providing the newborn with protection against pertussis in early life, and will protect the mother from pertussis around the time of delivery, making her less likely to become infected and transmit pertussis to her infant. The 2011 Tdap recommendation did not call for vaccinating pregnant women previously vaccinated with Tdap. On 24 Oct 2012, ACIP voted to recommend use of Tdap during every pregnancy. This report summarizes data considered and conclusions made by ACIP and provides guidance for implementing its recommendations. These updated recommendations on use of Tdap in pregnant women aim to optimize strategies for preventing pertussis morbidity and mortality in infants.'\n\nMost of the morbidity and mortality from pertussis occurs in infants less than 6 months of age, especially neonates. Neonatal pertussis is observed to be especially severe with as much as a 3 percent risk of death. Symptoms can be substantially different with periods of apnea [breathing arrest] sometimes with hypoxia-induced [low oxygen] seizures usually the most common manifestation of infection.

However, the risk of childhood epilepsy following pertussis is unknown.\n\nOBJECTIVE:\nTo examine whether pertussis is associated with the long-term risk of epilepsy.\n\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS:\nWe used individually linked data from population-based medical registries covering all Danish hospitals to identify a cohort of all patients with pertussis born between 1978 and 2011, followed up through 2011. We used the Civil Registration System to identify 10 individuals from the general population for each patient with pertussis, matched on sex and year of birth.\n\nEXPOSURES:\nInpatient or hospital-based outpatient diagnosis of pertussis.\n\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES:\nCumulative incidence and hazard ratio of time to hospital-based epilepsy diagnosis (pertussis cohort vs general population cohort), adjusted for birth year, sex, maternal history of epilepsy, presence of congenital malformations, and gestational age. Unique personal identifiers permitted unambiguous data linkage and complete follow-up for death, emigration, and hospital contacts.\n\nRESULTS:\nWe identified 4700 patients with pertussis (48 percent male), of whom 90 developed epilepsy during the follow-up.

The CDC predicts the protection provided from the pertussis vaccine may last a decade or less. Those in whom the vaccine is no longer effective can become infected and transmit the disease to others through respiratory droplets.\n\nPertussis, in its early stages, mimics the common cold. It is often not suspected or diagnosed until the more-severe symptoms appear. Symptoms can include fits of rapid, high-pitched coughs, vomiting, and exhaustion. Antimicrobials can shorten the amount of time a patient is contagious. In most cases, children under 1 year old are most severely affected. Infants can receive the 1st vaccination at 2 months of age, though it takes several doses to attain protection.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Plano is located mostly within Collin County but a small portion extends into Denton County. - Mod.LL\n\nHealthMap: Collin County, Texas: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/4306]\n\n******\n[2] New Mexico (Curry County)\nDate: Sun 2 Nov 2015\nSource: Deming Headlight [edited]\nhttp://www.demingheadlight.com/story/news/2015/11/02/whooping-cough-cases-increase/75060900/\n\n\nThe New Mexico Department of Health announced today [2 Nov 2015] an increase in whooping cough (pertussis) cases in Curry County. 13 cases have been confirmed in Curry County residents in 2015, including 7 school-aged children and 2 infants who were hospitalized.

From October 2014 through October 2015, 109 cases of pertussis have been reported to the New York City (NYC) Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH), with an increase in cases over the past 4 months. The majority of cases (90 percent) are children aged less than 19 years (median age 4 years), of whom 52 percent were unvaccinated or not up to date with pertussis-containing vaccine. Infants aged less than 1 year account for 34 percent (n=37) of cases. Of the 37 mothers of infants with pertussis, only 3 (8 percent) received the recommended tetanus-diphtheria-acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccination during their most recent pregnancy. Five infants were hospitalized, including 1 who had pneumonia.\n\nTo control the outbreak, we urge you to:\n1. Recall patients who are not up to date with DTaP and Tdap vaccines\n2. Vaccinate pregnant women with Tdap during every pregnancy\n3. Report suspect cases\n4. Follow droplet precautions\n5. Obtain optimal specimens for diagnostic testing\n6. Provide prompt antimicrobial treatment and/or post-exposure prophylaxis\n\nDelays in on-time initiation and completion of the pertussis-containing vaccine series remain problematic in the affected communities, facilitating ongoing transmission. Young infants are at greatest risk of severe pertussis infection and its complications. Recommended strategies to protect these infants include ensuring that the mother receives Tdap during her pregnancy and that the infant starts the vaccine series on time at 2 months of age. Subsequent doses should be given 4, 6 and 15-18 months and at 4-6 years of age. Pertussis-containing vaccines are required for children to attend child care, head start, pre-kindergarten and both private and public school programs. Providers caring for patients in the Orthodox Jewish communities should recall patients aged 2 months and older and who have not received recommended pertussis containing vaccines for immediate vaccination.\n\nPertussis is a highly contagious bacterial infection that begins with nonspecific upper respiratory symptoms that last for 7-10 days, followed by onset of cough. The classic pertussis cough includes persistent paroxysms (coughing fits), an inspiratory 'whoop,' apnea, and/or post-tussive vomiting. Cough may last weeks to months if not treated early.\n\nPeople with prior history of disease or vaccination may have milder symptoms and lack classic features of disease, making diagnosis more difficult. Maintain a high level of suspicion of pertussis in all patients with a persistent cough. In infants, apnea can be a prominent feature and complications of pertussis include pneumonia, encephalitis, and death. In adults, complications of pertussis include post-tussive syncope and rib fracture, in addition to persistent cough.\n\nIndividuals are infectious for up to 3 weeks or until 5 days after the start of effective antimicrobial treatment. If pertussis is suspected based on clinical presentation or known exposure to a pertussis case, clinicians should collect a nasopharyngeal (NP) swab and send it to a commercial laboratory for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing. Provide treatment after collecting diagnostic specimens. Do not wait for the results. Waiting for results facilitates disease transmission. Specimens are most likely to be positive when patients have a clinically compatible illness and specimens are collected within the first 3 weeks of cough onset and before completion of antimicrobials.\n\nDOHMH does not recommend serologic testing for pertussis because standardized tests are not available, making the results of commercially available tests difficult to interpret. More information about pertussis diagnostics can be found at http://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/clinical/downloads/diagnosis-pcr-bestpractices.pdf.\n\nAntimicrobial treatment can alleviate symptoms and reduce pertussis transmission if given early in the course of illness. Treatment should be provided to persons aged 1 year or older within 3 weeks of cough onset and to infants less than 1 year of age and pregnant women within 6 weeks of cough onset. Children receiving treatment must stay home and cannot attend child care or school until they have received 5 days of antimicrobials; similarly, adults should also stay home for the same time period. Treatment beyond this period is not thought to alter the duration of cough nor transmission to others and is not recommended. Physicians should prescribe either a macrolide or, for macrolide allergic patients, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.\n\nAntimicrobials should also be provided to close contacts (e.g. household members) of confirmed pertussis cases as post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) to prevent illness and transmission. The antibacterial and dosing for treatment and prophylaxis are the same. If pertussis is strongly suspected, then PEP should begin while awaiting laboratory confirmation. For details, see Table 4 at http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/PDF/rr/rr5414.pdf.\n\nIn healthcare facilities, a dose of Tdap is routinely recommended for all healthcare personnel (HCP). HCPs should observe droplet precautions, such as wearing surgical masks, while evaluating suspect pertussis cases. Precautions should be observed regardless of the vaccination status of HCP. HCP with known unprotected exposure to pertussis and who are likely to expose pregnant women or neonates should receive PEP. Other HCP should either receive PEP or be monitored daily for 21 days after pertussis exposure and treated if pertussis symptoms develop. Clinicians should report all suspected cases of pertussis to DOHMH. Do not wait until laboratory confirmation to report. Early reporting allows DOHMH to investigate cases and assist the facility in identifying those who need post-exposure prophylaxis to prevent further infections. To report a suspected case, clinicians should call DOHMH at 866-692-3641.\n\n[Authors: Jennifer Rosen, MD Director, Epidemiology and Surveillance Bureau of Immunization and Jane R.

The number of cases confirmed compared to just a year ago was way up, especially in northern Kentucky. Those cases were reported in both children and adults, but public health experts were especially concerned those infected will transmit the virus to babies.\n\nLocal 12 News got a report from the northern Kentucky Health Department that said compared to a year ago at the same time, there were 2 confirmed cases reported. In 2015 already in August, there were 9.\n\nThis was a big concern for those who were pregnant or taking care of young children. Local 12 News spent the day in the maternity ward at Saint Elizabeth Healthcare in Edgewood [Kentucky] to share more on what they want every new mom to know. Christina Rust, education specialist at Saint Elizabeth Healthcare, said, 'By immunizing the mother during her pregnancy she can pass those antibodies on to the baby.' Whooping cough is a respiratory infection which can cause serious complications. Pertussis is fatal in most cases for babies under 3 months of age. So those around [the newborn baby] must get the pertussis vaccine so whooping cough can't be transmitted to [the newborn] from someone else. 'That's called a cocoon. So we are making a cocoon of immunized moms, dads, uncles, aunts around the baby,' said Rust.\n\nAdults only need to have that vaccine once and it will protect them and those around them. A quick reminder for everyone as this starts to circulate and children go back to school; hand-washing is the best defense. Whooping cough is highly contagious. The initial symptoms of whooping cough are a lot like the common cold but if parents hear that 'hoop' sound they need to seek medical attention for them or anyone around them. Doctors are on high alert to diagnose this infection and are being asked to recommend the vaccine for anyone who has not had it between the ages of 10 and 60. The CDC recommended a booster vaccine called T-dap for children, at age 11 or 12. As well as for all adolescents and adults who did not receive the vaccine as a preteen. This vaccine helps to prevent whooping cough, as well as tetanus and diphtheria.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The pertussis immunization recommendations given in the news report above are incomplete. The following is recommended by the CDC (http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd-vac/pertussis/recs-summary.htm):\n\nExpectant mothers should receive Tdap during EACH pregnancy, preferably at 27 through 36 weeks, because maternal antibodies are acquired by the fetus following maternal vaccination during this time.\n\nDTaP is given to children younger than 7 years of age, and Tdap is given to older children and adults. Children should get 5 doses of DTaP, one dose at each of the following ages: 2, 4, 6, and 15 through 18 months, and 4 through 6 years of age. Tdap should be given to 7-10 year olds who are not fully immunized against pertussis. Adolescents 11 through 18 years of age (preferably at age 11-12 years) should also receive a single dose of Tdap. One dose of Tdap is also recommended for adults 19 years of age and older who did not get Tdap as an adolescent.\n\nBecause infants who are too young to be fully vaccinated are the most vulnerable to severe, sometimes fatal, cases of pertussis, it is important for all those in close contact with newborns and infants (such as parents, grandparents, siblings, and other care givers) to have up-to-date vaccination. In 2014, over 10 percent of cases occurred in children under 6 months of age and the incidence rate of pertussis among infants in this age group (about 150 cases per 100 000) exceeded that of all other age groups (http://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/downloads/pertuss-surv-report-2014.pdf).

The infection is growing.\n\nIn just 8 months in 2015, there were more cases recorded than in all of 2014. Additionally, in 32 weeks, the Carlos III Institute certified 4822 new cases; 1699 more are ill from this disease than in the 12 months of 2014, a jump of 54 percent without finishing this year.\n\nDoctors have spent months reporting people increasingly infected by the bacterium _Bordetella pertussis_, which causes the disease. The rebound has been continuing since at least 2011. In 2011, by comparison, Carlos III Institute in late December had more than 800 cases. 'It is also true that now diagnostic capability is greater,' said officials.\n\nDr. Amos Garcia Rojas, president of the Spanish Vaccinology Association (AEV), said that 'the original vaccine for pertussis (whole cell) had a lot of power but had a high rate of side effects.

Over 200 people have reported having whooping cough in the last month, and the number is expected to rise. The outbreak is spreading across the South Island, after being centered in Central Otago. An increasing number of cases are being detected in Southland and further afield in Otago, including Dunedin.\n\nHistorically, a whooping cough outbreak happens once every 4 years -- with the last taking place in 2011/12.

Over the last week there had been less than 5 notifications per day of people having whooping cough. At the peak of the outbreak, it was about 15 people per day. A notification included suspected cases, and only about 1/3 of notifications have been confirmed as whooping cough. She said the difference between suspected and confirmed cases highlighted the fact it was a 'difficult disease to diagnose and doctors are being vigilant for possible cases'.\n\nIn about half of the cases, the patient had not been immunized against whooping cough, or their vaccinations were not up-to-date.\n\n[Byline: Ashleigh Stewart]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Maps of New Zealand can be seen at http://www.ezilon.com/maps/images/oceania/political-map-of-New-Zealan.gif and http://healthmap.org/promed/p/23916. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ\n\nA recently published paper in PLoS Computational Biology suggests waning immunity from the acellular pertussis vaccine as the main reason for the dramatic increase in pertussis cases:\nGambhir M, Clark TA, Cauchemez S, et al: A change in vaccine efficacy and duration of protection explains recent rises in pertussis incidence in the United States.

The last new case the agency began investigating was Friday [24 Jul 2015], Baldetti said. An outbreak is not considered contained until 2 full cycles of the disease -- a cycle is 21 days -- pass without a new case. At this point, that would be 4 Sep [2015].\n\n'I'm not confident to say we won't get any more,' Baldetti said. 'It seems we get one to 3 new cases a day. It just seems like it builds up. We don't have any for several days, and then we get 3 or 4.'\n\nWhooping cough is a contagious respiratory disease caused by _Bordetella pertussis_ bacteria. Initial symptoms include runny nose, sneezing and a mild cough, which may seem like a typical cold, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Usually, the cough slowly becomes more severe, and eventually the patient may experience bouts of rapid, violent coughing followed by the 'whooping' sound that gives the disease its common name when trying to take a breath. The disease can cause serious and sometimes life-threatening complications, permanent disability, and even death, especially in infants and young children.\n\nAs of Friday [24 Jul 2015], the Kansas Department of Health and Environment listed Reno County with 41 confirmed or probable cases of pertussis, accounting for 20 percent of all cases in the state. That was up from 18 on Jun 29 [2015]. The state figures showed additional new cases in 4 counties that abut Reno -- Kingman, Harvey, McPherson and Sedgwick -- as well as in 2 other counties in the region.\n\nThe Reno County Health Department is actively working with area school districts to be prepared, 'but we can't put the onus on schools to get out in front of it. We hope to have (vaccination) clinics for Buhler, Haven and Nickerson [3 of the 7 Reno County school districts],' Baldetti said. '(USD) 308 [Unified School District 308, also called Hutchinson] has committed to not allow anyone to enroll without the vaccination or an acceptance form.'\n\nWhile the pertussis vaccine offers '90 percent protection' from the disease, new research shows antibodies decline in 2-5 years. That has health officials advising anyone who has regular contact with children, particularly infants, or immune compromised adults, to get a Tdap (tetanus-diphtheria-acelluar pertussis) booster. The health department has at least 450 doses of vaccine and is offering the shots free.\n\n'It's really important for people to be proactive and be on guard for symptoms,' Baldetti said. 'Anyone suspected of being sick needs [to be] checked immediately. We cannot let cold symptoms be unchecked. It's too widespread now; it's better to be safe than sorry.' They are particularly focusing on families with school age children, school staff who work with children, and daycare providers.\n\n'There's serious concern for a potential exponential spread through our schools,' Baldetti said. 'When they get back to school, it will be concentrated, so we want to focus on that group.' Active cases, however, range from infants to high school to adults 'and everywhere in between,' he said. 'We're not isolating our effort to elementary, middle or high school, but all levels of education, daycare providers, churches and businesses. This is truly a widespread outbreak. And it is truly on us, as a community, to ensure we are protecting those in our community that cannot protect themselves. If your children have been vaccinated, but it has been more years than you can count on one hand, I encourage you to see your local provider and ask for a Tdap booster,' he said. 'It's not a bad idea for parents or even grandparents to check and see if they're outside that window.'\n\n[Byline: John Green]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Kansas, with a population of 2 904 021 in 2014, is a state located in the Midwestern United States (https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=Kansas). A map of Kansas counties is available at http://www.digital-topo-maps.com/county-map/kansas.shtml.\n\nThe news article above reports increasing numbers of cases of pertussis in Reno County, with a population of 64 511 in 2011, which is located in the south-central part of Kansas, and also reports additional new cases in 4 counties that abut Reno (Kingman, Harvey, McPherson and Sedgwick Counties) (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reno_County,_Kansas#Education). Last month [June 2015], ProMED-mail also reported cases of pertussis this year (2015) in nearby Barton County, Kansas (Pertussis - USA (10): (KS) fatal, update 20150618.3446509).\n\nThe following is extracted from the moderator comments in ProMED post Pertussis - USA (10): (KS) fatal, update 20150618.3446509:\n\nIn the U.S., DTaP and Tdap vaccines are used for pertussis immunization (http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd-vac/pertussis/default.htm#vacc). Upper-case letters in these abbreviations denote full-strength doses of diphtheria (D), tetanus (T) toxoids, and pertussis (P) vaccine. Lower-case 'd' and 'p' denote reduced doses of diphtheria and pertussis used in the adolescent/adult-formulations. The 'a' in DTaP and Tdap stands for 'acellular,' meaning that the pertussis component contains only a part of the pertussis organism.\n\nDTaP is given to children younger than 7 years of age, and Tdap is given to older children and adults. Children should get 5 doses of DTaP, one dose at each of the following ages: 2, 4, 6, and 15 through 18 months and 4 through 6 years of age. Adolescents 11 through 18 years of age (preferably at age 11-12 years) should receive a single dose of Tdap. One dose of Tdap is also recommended for adults 19 years of age and older who did not get Tdap as an adolescent. Expectant mothers should receive Tdap during each pregnancy, preferably at 27 through 36 weeks, because maternal antibodies are acquired by the fetus following maternal vaccination during this time. Tdap should also be given to 7-10 year olds who are not fully immunized against pertussis.\n\nPertussis is nationally notifiable to the CDC (http://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/outbreaks/trends.html). Following the introduction of pertussis vaccines in the 1940s when case counts frequently exceeded 100 000 cases per year, case counts declined dramatically to fewer than 10 000 by 1965. During the 1980s the incidence of pertussis began increasing gradually, and peaked in 2012 at 48 277 cases of pertussis (http://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/images/incidence-graph.jpg). This was the most reported cases since 1955. Pertussis again declined during 2013 and by 2014, more than 28 000 cases were reported nationwide.\n\nBecause infants who are too young to be fully vaccinated are the most vulnerable to severe, sometimes fatal, cases of pertussis, it is important for all those in close contact with newborns and infants (such as, parents, grandparents, siblings, and other care givers) to have up-to-date vaccination. In 2014, over 10 percent of cases occurred in children under 6 months of age and the incidence rate of pertussis among infants in this age group (about 150 cases per 100 000) exceeded that of all other age groups (http://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/downloads/pertuss-surv-report-2014.pdf).

Children should get 5 doses of DTaP, one dose at each of the following ages: 2, 4, 6, and 15 through 18 months and 4 through 6 years of age.

'Our local health-care providers and schools are aware of the pertussis outbreak in Greenlee County and are taking proper measures to bring this occurrence to a close,' said Brian Douglas, Graham County Health director.\n\nThere are 8 confirmed cases of pertussis -- known as whooping cough -- in Greenlee County, with contact in Graham. In an e-mail, Douglas said pertussis 'is highly contagious, and one of the most commonly occurring vaccine-preventable diseases in the United States. People with pertussis usually spread the disease by coughing or sneezing while in close contact with others, who then breathe in the pertussis bacteria. Many infants who get pertussis are infected by older siblings, parents, or other caregivers who might not even know they have the disease. Pertussis is most severe for infants. This is the age group we're most concerned about when it comes to this infection.'\n\nHe said pertussis occurs in a cyclical pattern, with the number of cases peaking every three to five years. He also said that even with the success of pertussis vaccines, people continue to get pertussis because no vaccine is guaranteed 100 percent effective.\n\nPertussis symptoms include: cold-like symptoms for the 1st one to 2 weeks with cough becoming more severe; after the initial few weeks, bursts of numerous, rapid coughs with difficulty in catching one's breath after the coughing episode; [and] possible vomiting from sticky mucus.\n\nTo reduce the risk of contracting pertussis, parents need to make sure everyone in the household is up to date with recommended pertussis vaccines (DTaP for infants/children and Tdap for adolescents/adults). Those planning on becoming pregnant or who are currently pregnant should talk to a doctor about getting the Tdap vaccine. To avoid spreading the disease to infants, make sure all people around the baby are vaccinated with Tdap, including siblings, grandparents, aunts, uncles, nannies, caregivers, child-care staff, etc. People with a cough illness or other communicable disease should always stay away from young infants.\n\nFor information regarding the signs and symptoms of pertussis, go to the CDC website at http://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/ or contact the Graham County Health Department at 928-428-1962.\n\n[Byline: David Bell]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The news report above fails to say the ages of the 8 pertussis cases in Greenlee County, Arizona, or their pertussis vaccination status.\n\nDTaP is given to children younger than 7 years of age, and Tdap is given to older children and adults.

One dose of Tdap is also recommended for adults 19 years of age and older who did not get Tdap as an adolescent. Expectant mothers should receive Tdap during each pregnancy, preferably at 27 through 36 weeks, because maternal antibodies are acquired by the fetus following maternal vaccination during this time. Tdap should also be given to 7-10 year olds who are not fully immunized against pertussis.\n\nBecause infants who are too young to be fully vaccinated are the most vulnerable to severe, sometimes fatal, cases of pertussis, it is important for all those in close contact with newborns and infants (such as, parents, grandparents, siblings, and other care givers) to have up-to-date vaccination.

When more cases were confirmed, Barton County's Health Department held a free TDaP [DTaP] vaccination clinic and had over 1000 people immunized.\n\nWhooping cough can appear just like a cold or allergies when it first starts. 'It depends on if it's associated with a low-grade fever; pertussis does have just kind of like cold-like symptoms, viral-like symptoms in the beginning. If that progresses and doesn't go away you need to go see your provider,' said Debra Brockel a physician's assistant with Clara Barton Hospital.\n\nJust because it's summer doesn't mean that whooping cough will be less prevalent. 'Just because school isn't in session doesn't mean kids aren't in close proximity; they're at the pool; they're at camp, so that doesn't lessen the risk any,' said Brockel.\n\nImmunizations are the key to preventing whooping cough, but good hand-washing can help.\n\nSo far, there have been 143 total confirmed cases of whooping cough in the state this year [2015].\n\n[Byline: Molly Hadfield]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[In the US, DTaP and Tdap vaccines are used for pertussis immunization (http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd-vac/pertussis/default.htm#vacc).

These authors show that the 1st vaccine used to prime the infant immune system largely determines the efficacy of subsequent vaccinations. This study suggests that, in contrast to what Dr Benjamin suggests, for the 1st vaccination a WCV [whole-cell vaccine] should be used, or a vaccine (to be developed) which primes the immune system in a similar way as the WCV.\n\nAnother important intervention is, of course, maternal vaccination which has been shown to be safe and very effective in the UK (2, 3). Indeed, in the short term, this seems to me the only measure possible to protect infants too young to be fully vaccinated.\n\nFinally, the resurgence of pertussis is probably multi-factorial, whereby the limited duration of immunity conferred by current vaccines is aggravated by pathogen adaptation (4).\n\nReferences\n----------\n1.

JAMA 2012; 308(5): 454-6; available at http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=1273011) is reproduced below:\n\nTo the Editor: Due to their lower rate of adverse events, acellular pertussis vaccines (diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis; DTaP) replaced whole cell vaccines (diphtheria-tetanus-whole cell pertussis; DTwP) in many developed countries during the 1990s. DTaP became available in Queensland, Australia, in 1996 and replaced DTwP for publicly funded primary course immunizations delivered at ages 2 months, 4 months, and 6 months in March 1999. This meant children born in 1998 could receive a primary course consisting of only DTwP, only DTaP, or a mixed schedule.\n\nSimilar to North America (1), Australia is experiencing a sustained pertussis epidemic (2) with the highest incidence rates in Queensland during 2011 in children aged 6 to 11 years. The recent changes in pertussis epidemiology may be related to the shift from DTwP to DTaP. To test this hypothesis, we compared pertussis reporting rates by primary course vaccination in the 1998 birth cohort.\n\nMethods\n-------\nReporting pertussis cases to the health department is mandatory in Queensland. For children born in 1998, we calculated pertussis reporting rates in both the preepidemic (1998-2008) and outbreak periods (2009-2011), by number and order of DTwP doses given before their first birthday. We linked data from the Queensland vaccination register (QVR) with case reports of pertussis. The QVR is not a population-based register so we could not construct a group of wholly unvaccinated children for comparison. Children were censored following initial reporting. We calculated average annual incidence rates, incidence rate differences, incidence rate ratios, and 95 percent confidence intervals using Stata version 12 (StataCorp). The Queensland Children's Health Services ethics committee approved the study.\n\nResults\n-------\nOf 58 233 children born in 1998 identified in the QVR, 40 694 (69.9 percent) received at least 3 doses of any pertussis-containing vaccine during the 1st year from a Queensland vaccine service provider and were included in the analysis. Overall, 267 1st pertussis cases were reported from this cohort between 1999 and 2011; 2 2nd reports were excluded.\n\nChildren who received a 3-dose DTaP primary course had higher rates of pertussis than those who received a 3-dose DTwP primary course in the preepidemic and outbreak periods (Table and Figure [available at the source URL above. - Mod.LL]). Among those who received mixed courses, rates in the current epidemic were highest for children receiving DTaP as their 1st dose. This pattern remained when looking at subgroups with 1 or 2 DTwP doses in the 1st year of life, although it did not reach statistical significance. Children who received a mixed course with DTwP as the initial dose had incidence rates that were between rates for the pure course DTwP and DTaP cohorts.\n\nComment\n-------\nInfant priming with DTwP was associated with a lower risk of subsequent pertussis than DTaP only primed children in this cohort. This difference persisted for more than a decade, being evident in preepidemic and outbreak periods. A primary course using even a moderately effective DTwP vaccine may be more protective than DTaP (3). In the preacellular era, Australia used a locally produced DTwP vaccine with very good to excellent effectiveness (4). Our findings suggest the most important factor, in this cohort, may be the initial vaccine received.\n\nIt is unlikely our findings during the current outbreak are the result of detection bias because this would require health care-seeking behavior, or the likelihood of laboratory testing or reporting, to be associated with the primary course received by children over a decade previously.\n\nPossible explanations for our findings could include antigenic shifts in circulating Bordetella pertussis strains (2) or the different immune responses from acellular and whole-cell priming (5). The lesser protection provided by DTaP, both as the initial vaccine or full primary course, may be due to linked epitope suppression, when the initial exposure locks in the immune response to certain epitopes and inhibits response to other linked epitopes on subsequent exposures (6).\n\nThe challenge for future pertussis vaccine development is to address the benefit-risk trade-off highlighted by our study, and to develop vaccines that induce long-lasting protection from the first dose, without the adverse events associated with DTwP use.\n\nReferences\n----------\n1.

The number of patients diagnosed with the contagious infection has also risen across the Black Country and Staffordshire [West Midlands].\n\nWhooping cough -- a bacterial infection of the lungs and airways -- affects all ages, but newborns and infants under 3 months of age are at highest risk of severe complications and death.\n\nDuring 2014 there were 135 cases in the West Midlands -- 39 of those were in the Black Country and Staffordshire. This is up by 42 per cent compared with 2013's figures when there were a total of 95 cases in the West Midlands.\n\nHealth chiefs have urged pregnant women to have a vaccination to protect themselves and their unborn babies against the risk of the infection, also known as pertussis. It protects the baby from developing whooping cough in the first few weeks of life as the mother passes immunity on to her unborn child, protecting the youngster until they receive their first vaccination at 2 months old. All pregnant women are offered vaccination against whooping cough when they are 28-38 weeks pregnant.\n\nIn 2014, the highest number of cases were diagnosed in Sandwell and Walsall with 12 patients in each borough suffering from the infection. This is compared with 4 cases and 6 cases respectively in 2013. The figure has also risen in Wolverhampton from 2 to 3 cases.\n\nBut the number of people being diagnosed fell in Dudley from 10 cases to 4, in Cannock from 3 to 2 and in Stafford from 4 to 2. The number of cases remained static in Wyre Forest with 2 reported in both 2013 and 2014.\n\nJyoti Atri, director of public health at Sandwell Council, said it was important to get vaccinated to prevent the risk of catching the infection, adding: 'Whooping cough is highly contagious and newborns are particularly vulnerable. It's vital that babies are protected from the day they are born - that's why the vaccine is being offered to all pregnant women. If you are pregnant, getting vaccinated is the best way you can protect your baby against whooping cough.'\n\nThe condition usually begins with a persistent dry and irritating cough that progresses to intense bouts of coughing. The gasping for breath after one of these coughing bouts causes a distinctive 'whooping' noise, which is how the infection gets its name. The coughing can last for around three months.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[For a discussion of pertussis, see moderators' comments in prior ProMED-mail pertussis posts.\n\nMaps of England can be seen at http://www.picturesofengland.com/images/mapofengland/regions-uk.gif and http://healthmap.org/promed/p/4481.\n\nThe Midlands is an area spanning central England, with a population of 9 439 516 (2001 census), but does not correspond to any current administrative area.

PLoS Comput Biol. 2015; 11(4): e1004138. doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004138 http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004138) comparing the efficacy and duration of both the whole cell and acellular vaccines mirrors what Australia, and we, here in California, have been experiencing.

I put this forward as an option which I believe needs to be studied. While whole cell pertussis vaccine is no longer currently used in the USA, it was, and should still be licensed for use. It is still being manufactured and used in other countries and so should still be available.\n\nI suggest this because it is clear that simply increasing dosing frequency (that is, possible boosting at transition from middle school to high school) using a less effective acellular vaccine, leaves us complacently resigned to endemicity.\n\nUltimately, we need a new, re-engineered vaccine which addresses these issues, but this will take large amounts of resources and time, by far, to clear FDA approval.\n\n--\nRobert Benjamin, MD, MPH\n<robert.benjamin.md@gmail.com>\n\n[ProMED-mail thanks Dr Benjamin for his comments. While the evolution of new clones of _B. pertussis_ and the presence of an under immunized cohort of individuals may play a role, it certainly appears that the current DTaP (diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis vaccine) vaccination protocol (1) results in waning pertussis immunity, which creates a reservoir for _B. pertussis_ that can infect infants less than one year of age, and particularly less than 6 months old, who are particularly at risk for morbidity and mortality. Vaccination of the pregnant woman should assist in protecting this susceptible cohort.\n\nA recent paper in Pediatrics (2) included 224 378 children from Minnesota and 179 011 children from Oregon. Both Minnesota and Oregon had very high numbers of pertussis cases in 2010 and 2012. The researchers reviewed 458 of the children in the Minnesota group and 89 of the children in the Oregon group for the full time period studied. Over that time, the number of pertussis cases that occurred rose each year.\n\nDuring the 1st year of follow-up of the study, a rate of 15.6 out of 100 000 children contracted pertussis in Minnesota. By the 6th year of the study, that rate had risen to 138.4 out of 100 000 children. In Oregon, the rate of pertussis in the 1st year was 6.2 out of 100 000 children, which rose to 24.4 out of 100 000 children by the 6th year of the study.\n\nIn Minnesota, a child was twice as likely in the 2nd year of the study as in the 1st year to contract pertussis. By the 6th year, a child was 9 times more likely to catch whooping cough than they were in the 1st year of the study. In Oregon, a child was 30 percent more likely to catch pertussis in the 2nd year of the study than in the 1st year. By the 6th year, children were 4 times more likely to catch pertussis than they were in the 1st year.\n\nAn additional recent publication, in Clinical Infectious Disease (3), utilized a large cohort of young people receiving all of their health care at the Kaiser Permanente Medical Center in San Rafael, California, USA, and reported that a markedly increased risk of pertussis occurred associated with those who received only acellular pertussis vaccine. As compared to those who received at least one dose of the killed, whole cell pertussis vaccine (prior to the switch to all acellular dosing), the relative risk of acquiring pertussis was 8.57 in those receiving 5 doses of the acellular vaccine but fell to a relative risk of 3.55 in those receiving 6 doses of the acellular vaccine.\n\nReferences\n----------\n1.

So far this year [2015], 115 cases of the illness have been reported to ACT Health, compared with 49 for the same period in 2014.\n\nACT chief health officer Dr Paul Kelly said whooping cough, or pertussis, was a serious respiratory infection that could be life-threatening for infants. 'In babies, the infection can sometimes lead to pneumonia and occasionally brain damage, and can be life threatening,' he said.\n\n'There has already been an increase in the number of pertussis notifications in the ACT so far in 2015. This has mainly been across the 0- to 14-year age group compared to the same time in 2014 (45 cases in 2015 to 13 cases in 2014). Especially children aged 10 to 12 (21 cases in 2015 compared to 3 cases in 2014).'\n\nBut Dr Kelly said it was usual for the number of cases to spike once every few years. 'The increased number of notifications is expected, as pertussis notifications tend to increase every few years, as they last did in 2010-11,' he said.\n\n'One of the issues with the vaccine is that it's very effective but it doesn't last as long as previous vaccines we've had.'\n\nDr Kelly said there were discussions with companies to develop a longer lasting vaccine. 'We need to improve the immunogenicity as it's called of the vaccine so that it can last longer,' he said. '[But] it is vital that parents ensure all their children are up to date with their scheduled vaccinations to minimise the risk of whooping cough circulating not only in their own families but in the wider community including schools.'\n\nFrom today, pregnant women in their 3rd trimester can access free whooping cough vaccinations. 'I encourage all pregnant women to ensure they are vaccinated in their 3rd trimester, ideally at 28 weeks or as soon as possible after, as it offers the best protection for babies until they have completed their primary immunisation for pertussis at six months of age,' Dr Kelly said.\n\n'Family members and other adults in close contact with young babies should also discuss the benefits of the vaccine.'\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n\n[A recently published paper in PLoS Computational Biology suggests waning immunity from the acellular pertussis vaccine as the main reason for the dramatic increase in pertussis cases:\nGambhir M, Clark TA, Cauchemez S, et al: A change in vaccine efficacy and duration of protection explains recent rises in pertussis incidence in the United States.

There has also been a shift over the same time period in the age group reporting the largest number of cases (aside from infants), from adolescents to 7-11 year olds. We use epidemiological modelling and a large case incidence dataset to explain the upsurge. We investigate several hypotheses for the upsurge in pertussis cases by fitting a suite of dynamic epidemiological models to incidence data from the National Notifiable Disease Surveillance System (NNDSS) between 1990-2009, as well as incidence data from a variety of sources from 1950-1989.\n\nWe find that: the best-fitting model is one in which vaccine efficacy and duration of protection of the acellular pertussis (aP) vaccine is lower than that of the whole-cell (wP) vaccine, (efficacy of the first 3 doses 80 per cent [95 per cent CI: 78-82] versus 90 per cent [95 per cent CI: 87-94]), increasing the rate at which disease is reported to NNDSS is not sufficient to explain the upsurge and 3) 2010-2012 disease incidence is predicted well. In this study, we use all available USA surveillance data to: 1) fit a set of mathematical models and determine which best explains these data and 2) determine the epidemiological and vaccine-related parameter values of this model. We find evidence of a difference in efficacy and duration of protection between the 2 vaccine types, wP and aP (aP efficacy and duration lower than wP).

Symptoms usually begin with cold- or flu-like symptoms such as a runny nose, mild cough, watery eyes, sneezing, and a low-grade fever. The cough becomes worse and often includes rapid coughs followed by a high-pitched whoop; the cough can be severe enough to break a person's rib or cause vomiting.\n\nTransylvania County Department of Public Health is working to find any links between the cases and identify people who have had contact with the sick individuals in order to control the spread of the disease. In late 2014, the county had 31 confirmed cases of pertussis and followed up with more than 450 individuals who had possibly been exposed to the disease.\n\nAll of the cases in 2015 have been in infants 7 months of age and younger, and 2 of these children have been hospitalized. Infants and young children have a higher risk for serious whooping cough, and are more likely to experience serious illness and complications, such as pneumonia, encephalitis and seizures.\n\nOne of the children diagnosed with pertussis was a 4-week-old [girl]. After she developed a cough, she was tested for both RSV [respiratory syncytial virus] and pertussis at her pediatrician's office. 'She didn't really have a 'whoop' like you hear about,' [her mother] said, 'But you don't always have that at such a young age.' The RSV test was positive, so she was taken to Mission Children's Hospital in Asheville [North Carolina] to begin treatment. Then, the pertussis test results also came back positive. 'It was scary,' [her mother] said. 'She's 4 weeks old. She's little. There's not much you can do.'\n\nSuction helped to clear the mucus from [girl's] airways. She and the rest of her family were put on a course of antibiotics, which are used to control the symptoms and help prevent infected people from spreading the disease.\n\nBecause pertussis is so contagious, it is very important for infected people to stay away from others and take the entire course of antibiotics as prescribed. 'It's miserable and awful, but when they say quarantine, you have to stay home,' [her mother] said.\n\nThe best way to prevent pertussis is through immunization: the CDC recommends 5 doses of 'DTaP' [diphtheria, pertussis, and tetanus] for young children beginning at 2 months of age. However, the vaccine's protection only lasts 5-10 years, so additional doses of 'Tdap' should be given at age 11 or 12 and as an adult. Pregnant women should receive a dose during each pregnancy to fully protect their newborns.\n\n'It's so important to 'cocoon' very young babies by ensuring that all the people around the baby are up-to-date on their pertussis shots,' said Elaine Russell, health director for Transylvania County.

Bill Emminger, a manager of environmental health with the Benton County Health Department, said there also were confirmed cases in Philomath schools. Corvallis School District sent out alerts about the outbreak [Fri 6 Mar 2015].\n\nPertussis also broke out in Benton County schools in November [2014].\n\nEmminger said that the Health Department's main message on pertussis is that it is particularly dangerous to children who are less than a year old. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on its website that half of such infants require hospitalization if they contract pertussis. Of those hospitalized, 1 or 2 in 100 will die from it.\n\nAccording to Emminger, babies can begin to receive pertussis vaccinations at 2 months, but the health department also emphasizes protecting infants by having everyone who has contact with the babies vaccinated against pertussis.\n\nHe added that pertussis is distinctive because of the persistent 'whooping' cough it causes as patients struggle for air. He said people should stay home if [they] believe they have pertussis because it is highly contagious, and they should see a doctor.\n\nPeople with pertussis usually get a course of antibiotics and remain contagious for a week, Emminger said.\n\nSince October [2014], 37 cases of pertussis have been confirmed in Benton County. The most in a month was 13 in November [2014]. 8 confirmed cases were reported in February [2015]. The cases in Corvallis mostly have been at Corvallis High School and Crescent Valley High School. Of the people infected, 27 were ages 10 to 19; one was an infant.\n\nNo deaths have been reported.\n\n[Byline: Anthony Rimel]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The news report above does not say the percent of pertussis cases that were unimmunized. Although in some regions low immunization rates account for pertussis outbreaks, the California Department of Public Health said that low immunization rates could not account for the current pertussis outbreak in the state, because 90 per cent of those children infected in 2014 had been vaccinated against pertussis (see ProMED-mail post Pertussis - USA (29) 20141222.3044440); increased virulence and a mismatch between the vaccine strain and the current circulating clones of _Bordetella pertussis_, attributed to genetic changes, as well as a waning immune response after vaccination may be other causes of the current outbreaks.\n\nIn the US, DTaP and Tdap vaccines are used for pertussis immunization (http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd-vac/pertussis/default.htm#vacc. Upper-case letters in these abbreviations denote full-strength doses of diphtheria (D), tetanus (T) toxoids, and pertussis (P) vaccine. Lower-case 'd' and 'p' denote reduced doses of diphtheria and pertussis used in the adolescent/adult-formulations. The 'a' in DTaP and Tdap stands for 'acellular,' meaning that the pertussis component contains only a part of the pertussis organism.)\n\nDTaP is given to children younger than 7 years of age, and Tdap is given to older children and adults. Children should get 5 doses of DTaP, one dose at each of the following ages: 2, 4, 6, and 15 through 18 months and 4 through 6 years of age. Adolescents 11 through 18 years of age (preferably at age 11-12 years) should receive a single dose of Tdap. One dose of Tdap is also recommended for adults 19 years of age and older who did not get Tdap as an adolescent. Expectant mothers should receive Tdap during each pregnancy, preferably at 27 through 36 weeks, because maternal antibodies are acquired by the fetus following maternal vaccination during this time. Tdap should also be given to 7-10 year olds who are not fully immunized against pertussis.\n\nBecause infants who are too young to be fully vaccinated are the most vulnerable to severe, sometimes fatal, cases of pertussis, it is important for all those in close contact with newborns and infants (such as, parents, grandparents, siblings, and other care givers) to have up-to-date vaccines.\n\nThe state of Oregon can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/26499.

Public health directors in Walla Walla and Umatilla Counties explain the surge. Another pertussis epidemic is in full swing in Washington. Hardest hit is Walla Walla County, which has seen the highest rate of infection in the state.\n\nWalla Walla has 28 confirmed cases so far in 2015 with additional suspected cases boosting the number to about 55, said Walla Walla County public health director Harvey Crowder. The official rate is 47 per 100 000 persons.\n\nPublic health officials attribute the surge in pertussis, or whooping cough, to a weaker vaccine first used in 1997 to replace an earlier vaccine that triggered high fevers and seizures in some children. The current vaccine is safer, but protection seems to wane faster. In the mid-2000s, fully immunized people started coming down with whooping cough.\n\nCrowder said he wasn't surprised by the upsurge in 2015. 'For whatever reason the vaccine doesn't provide long-lived immunity,' Crowder said. 'We're going to see this again and again and again every 3-5 years until we get a vaccine that is longer-lived.' He said the majority of people coming down with whooping cough were fully vaccinated as children. 'Most of our cases have been adolescents and young adults,' he said.\n\nAcross the border in Oregon, Umatilla County has had only 2 confirmed cases, according to public health director Meghan DeBolt, and no current ones. 'There are no active pertussis cases in Umatilla County,' DeBolt said. 'We haven't seen a surge here.' That doesn't mean Umatilla County residents should feel invincible, however. Crowder and DeBolt urged people to get boosters, especially if they spend time around babies. Pregnant women should get vaccinated every time they get pregnant. Infants are particularly susceptible, they said.\n\nTo put the current outbreak in perspective, Washington saw epidemic numbers in 2012 with nearly 5000 whooping cough cases, dozens of hospitalizations and 1 infant death. So far, in 2015, 341 cases statewide have been reported. In 2014, at this time, there were 57 confirmed cases.\n\nOregon has seen 144 cases so far in 2015 after ending last year with 413.\n\n[byline: Kathy Aney]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Walla Walla county is in south eastern Washington State and shares a border with Umatilla county, Oregon.

PLoS Comput Biol. 2015; 11(4): e1004138. doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004138:\n\nAbstract\n--------\nOver the past 10 years the incidence of pertussis in the USA has risen steadily, with 2012 seeing the highest case number since 1955. There has also been a shift over the same time period in the age group reporting the largest number of cases (aside from infants), from adolescents to 7-11 year olds. We use epidemiological modelling and a large case incidence dataset to explain the upsurge. We investigate several hypotheses for the upsurge in pertussis cases by fitting a suite of dynamic epidemiological models to incidence data from the National Notifiable Disease Surveillance System (NNDSS) between 1990-2009, as well as incidence data from a variety of sources from 1950-1989.\n\nWe find that: the best-fitting model is one in which vaccine efficacy and duration of protection of the acellular pertussis (aP) vaccine is lower than that of the whole-cell (wP) vaccine, (efficacy of the first 3 doses 80 per cent [95 per cent CI: 78 - 82] versus 90 per cent [95 per cent CI: 87-94]), increasing the rate at which disease is reported to NNDSS is not sufficient to explain the upsurge and 3) 2010-2012 disease incidence is predicted well. In this study, we use all available USA surveillance data to: 1) fit a set of mathematical models and determine which best explains these data and 2) determine the epidemiological and vaccine-related parameter values of this model. We find evidence of a difference in efficacy and duration of protection between the 2 vaccine types, wP and aP (aP efficacy and duration lower than wP). Future refinement of the model presented here will allow for an exploration of alternative vaccination strategies such as different age-spacings, further booster doses, and cocooning. - Mod.LL\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/106.]", "summary": "Statewide: 319\n\u2022 Cowlitz: 7\n\u2022 Clark: 39\n\u2022 Lewis: 5\n\u2022 Pacific: 4\n\nWith 319 cases of whooping cough confirmed statewide this year, health officials are urging people to get vaccinated against the highly contagious disease.

The HCW experienced onset of diarrhea and malaise (non-respiratory symptoms atypical of the catarrhal phase of pertussis) on 26 Aug 2014. By 2 Sep 2014, paroxysms of coughing led the HCW to consult a colleague, who ordered the PCR test, prescribed a 5-day course of azithromycin, and advised avoidance of patient care until treatment completion. Contrary to the hospital's infection control policy, neither the HCW nor the colleague reported the presumptive diagnosis of pertussis to the hospital's public health department. The HCW continued to work in the outpatient department until the positive PCR result was received on 5 Sep 2014, at which time the hospital's public health department was first notified. The hospital barred the HCW from further work at the hospital while ill, and, in collaboration with local and state public health counterparts, began a contact investigation and stratified patient and HCW contacts by level of exposure.\n\nThe HCW had received tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis vaccine (Tdap) in 2010 and reported an ill family member who had been exposed at school during a widespread outbreak of pertussis affecting the surrounding community in August [2014] (1). In all, 47 persons were identified as being exposed to the HCW, including 31 patients ranging in age from 7 days to 12 years (six of whom were too young to receive diphtheria, tetanus, and acellular pertussis vaccine [DTaP]) and 15 HCWs. Of these exposed persons, 22 were considered high-risk contacts (7 patients and 15 HCWs) because they were aged less than 12 months, or contacts who themselves have close contact with infants under 12 months, pregnant women, or persons with preexisting health conditions at risk for severe illness or complications from pertussis. All 22 high-risk contacts were assessed for symptoms and received postexposure prophylaxis according to established guidelines (2). Additionally, 6 HCW high-risk contacts (3 staff physicians, 2 residents, and a nurse) reported symptoms suggestive of pertussis and were excluded from work until completion of a course of antibiotics. No patient contacts reported symptoms. Nasopharyngeal swabs obtained from all symptomatic high-risk contacts were negative for pertussis by PCR. The remaining low-risk contacts, or their identified parents or guardians, were screened for symptoms, informed of the low-risk nature of the exposure, and provided education on the signs and symptoms of pertussis. All 47 persons identified as exposed were contacted by public health investigators.\n\nHCW presenteeism (that is, working while sick) can jeopardize the well-being of patients and coworkers (3). Because of the need to investigate and limit exposures, clinical activities in a facility can be disrupted when staff members are potentially exposed to transmissible disease. HCWs should not work while ill with a potentially contagious condition.\n\nReferences\n----------\n1. St. George D: Whooping cough outbreak in Montgomery includes students at public, private schools.

I have always favored the policy of putting such potentially infectious health care workers on 'leave' without requiring them to use sick days.\n\nPrimum non nocere (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primum_non_nocere) is a Latin phrase that means 'first, do no harm.' The phrase is sometimes recorded as primum nil nocere. Non-maleficence, which is derived from the maxim, is one of the principal precepts of bioethics that all healthcare students are taught in school and is a fundamental principle throughout the world. Another way to state it is that, 'given an existing problem, it may be better not to do something, or even to do nothing, than to risk causing more harm than good.' It reminds the health care provider that they must consider the possible harm that any intervention might do. It is invoked when debating the use of an intervention that carries an obvious risk of harm but a less certain chance of benefit. Non-maleficence is often contrasted with its corollary, beneficence. The origin of the phrase is uncertain. The Hippocratic Oath includes the promise 'to abstain from doing harm' but does not include the precise phrase. Perhaps the closest approximation in the Hippocratic Corpus is in Epidemics: 'The physician must ... have 2 special objects in view with regard to disease, namely, to do good or to do no harm.' - Mod.LL\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/223.]", "summary": "Of these exposed persons, 22 were considered high-risk contacts (7 patients and 15 HCWs) because they were aged less than 12 months, or contacts who themselves have close contact with infants under 12 months, pregnant women, or persons with preexisting health conditions at risk for severe illness or complications from pertussis.

However, as of 15 Dec 2014, the number of pertussis cases reported in California in 2014 (9935) was the highest number in 70 years. San Diego County is among the hardest hit. The cases included an infant who died (ProMED-mail post Pertussis - USA (29) 20141222.3044440).\n\nAlthough in some regions low immunization rates account for pertussis outbreaks, the California Department of Public Health said that low inoculation rates could not account for the current pertussis outbreak in the state, because 90 per cent of those children infected in 2014 had been vaccinated against pertussis; increased virulence and a mismatch between the vaccine strain and the current circulating clones of _Bordetella pertussis_, attributed to genetic changes, as well as a waning immune response after vaccination may be other causes of the current outbreaks.\n\nIn the US, DTaP and Tdap vaccines are used for pertussis immunization (http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd-vac/pertussis/default.htm#vacc).

Children should get 5 doses of DTaP, one dose at each of the following ages: 2, 4, 6, and 15 through 18 months and 4 through 6 years of age. Adolescents 11 through 18 years of age (preferably at age 11-12 years) should receive a single dose of Tdap. One dose of Tdap is also recommended for adults 19 years of age and older who did not get Tdap as an adolescent. Expectant mothers should receive Tdap during each pregnancy, preferably at 27 through 36 weeks, because maternal antibodies are acquired by the fetus following maternal vaccination during this time. Tdap should also be given to 7-10 year olds who are not fully immunized against pertussis.\n\nBecause infants who are too young to be fully vaccinated are the most vulnerable to severe, sometimes fatal, cases of pertussis, it is important for all those in close contact with newborns and infants (such as, parents, grandparents, siblings, and other care givers) to have up-to-date vaccines.\n\nCalifornia of can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/204. - Mod.ML]", "summary": "Although in some regions low immunization rates account for pertussis outbreaks, the California Department of Public Health said that low inoculation rates could not account for the current pertussis outbreak in the state, because 90 per cent of those children infected in 2014 had been vaccinated against pertussis; increased virulence and a mismatch between the vaccine strain and the current circulating clones of _Bordetella pertussis_, attributed to genetic changes, as well as a waning immune response after vaccination may be other causes of the current outbreaks.

According to the director of health surveillance of the Municipal Foundation of Health (FMS), Amariles Borba, pertussis is on the rise due to low efficacy of immunization of the vaccine.\n\nThe Ministry of Health has been attempting to deploy the vaccine for the entire population, but 'there were difficulties in production to meet the demand of the Brazilian market,' says the director. Another problem, according to Amariles, is poor adherence to the vaccination schedule.\n\nThe only preventive vaccination was the pentavalent against tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis, _Haemophilus influenza_ and hepatitis B. It is intended for babies of 2, 4 and 6 months, but 70 per cent of the cases affect newborns in the 1st 3 months.

Four babies younger than 12 months have been affected, the health department reported on Tue 22 Dec 2014.\n\nAn advisory [notice] from the health department regarding pertussis, also called whooping cough, encourages residents to take precautions with holiday travel and get-togethers to prevent the spread of disease. Children and adults are advised be up-to-date on vaccinations, including booster shots for pertussis. And people are urged to stay home if they are sick.\n\nThe pertussis outbreak has affected students at 22 schools in the county. The health department also reports 21 cases of parapertussis, an illness similar to pertussis.\n\nA hotline set up to answer questions from those who have been exposed to pertussis has received more than 3900 phone calls. 'Preventing severe disease and death in infants is our highest priority,' the advisory says. The health department 'urges all pregnant women to get vaccinated and parents to vaccinate infants as soon as possible.'\n\nInfants who are too young to be vaccinated are the most vulnerable to severe, sometimes fatal, cases of pertussis. The health department says it is important for all those in close contact with newborns and infants to have up-to-date vaccines, an approach called cocooning. Mothers, fathers, siblings, grandparents, aunts, uncles and anyone who might be around an infant during the holidays should be vaccinated, said Wendy Trute, the Grand Traverse health officer.\n\n[byline: Sue Thoms]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Grand Traverse County is located in the north west part of Michigan's Lower Peninsula http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan.

'The doctor said he's got pertussis or whooping cough,' the teenager's father said. That meant even though no one else in the family has it yet, it was home for the holidays. 'It is a terrible gift to give, so we don't want to give this to anybody,' the mother said. The family even left gifts they were going to take to relatives out on their porch. 'They didn't say, 'Hi,' or nothing. They picked it up and drove off,' the teenager said.\n\nNo one appreciates that more than health officials in Lincoln, faced with all the cases in 2014. 'It's the highest we had recorded. The last numbers even close to that were in 2005, and we had 87,' supervisor of the Communicable Disease Program Tim Timmons said.\n\nPertussis outbreaks are occurring all across the country. Health officials said the vaccination apparently wears off. Kids are supposed to get 4 doses of it by age 2, another when they enter grade school, and a booster shot in high school. 'The immunity doesn't seem to last as long, maybe 3-4 years,' Timmons said. That's why so many middle and high school students, like this teenager, seem to be getting the disease even when they had their shots.\n\n[byline: Andrew Ozaki]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Nebraska (http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebraska) gets its name from the archaic Otoe words 'ni brasge' meaning 'flat water', after the Platte River that flows through the state.

It may have 'serious consequences' in future outbreaks, UK researchers state in the Journal of Infectious Diseases. But experts stressed that the vaccine remains highly effective in protecting the most vulnerable young babies.\n\nRising figures prompted health officials to recommend vaccination of pregnant women so immunity could be passed to their newborns, a strategy that a recent study showed was working well. But there has been much debate among experts about whether the introduction of a new vaccine in 2004 has been a factor in rising rates of whooping cough.\n\nOne issue is that immunity from the newer acellular vaccine does not seem to last as long as the previous whole cell version, leaving teenagers and adults lacking protection. In the latest study, researchers analysed the genes coding for the proteins on the surface of the pertussis bacterium responsible for the UK outbreak. They found proteins being targeted by the vaccine were mutating at a faster rate than other surface proteins not included in the vaccine. Potentially, it means the bacteria are changing quickly to get around the immune system's defenses put in place with immunization.\n\nBut the researchers are still trying to work out what the changes mean in reality; for example, do the mutations boost the ability of the bacteria to cause infection. 'We wanted to look at strains from the UK to see if there was anything sudden that had occurred that had led to these really large outbreaks,' said study leader Dr Andrew Preston from the University of Bath. The 'million dollar question,' he said, was what, if anything, could be done to improve the vaccine, which is still the best defense we have, and prevent future outbreaks.\n\nOptions to consider include adding more or different proteins to the vaccine, adding novel adjuvants (chemicals which boost the immune response), or even revisiting the old-style whole cell vaccine, he said. 'Pertussis has a cyclical nature, and another big question is are we going to see another increase in late 2015?,' he added.\n\nProf Adam Finn, a paediatric immunology expert at the University of Bristol, said the importance, or not, of the subtle changes found in the study was, as yet, unclear. 'But the control of pertussis is a significant worry,' he added.\n\n[byline: Emma Wilkinson]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The publication mentioned is Sealey KL, Harris SR, Fry NK, et al.

A worldwide resurgence of pertussis has been linked to switch to the use of acellular pertussis vaccines and the evolution of _B. pertussis_ away from vaccine-mediated immunity. We have conducted genomic analyses of multiple strains from the UK outbreak. We show that the UK outbreak was polyclonal in nature, caused by multiple distinct but closely related strains. Importantly, we demonstrate that acellular vaccine antigen encoding genes are evolving at higher rates than other surface protein encoding genes. This was true even prior to the introduction of pertussis vaccines but has become more pronounced since the introduction of the current acellular vaccines. The fast evolution of vaccine antigen genes has serious consequences for the ability of current vaccines to continue to control pertussis.'\n\nAnother recently published study (van Gent M, Heuvelman CJ, van der Heide HG, et al.

With the exception of Poland, European countries have replaced whole-cell vaccines (WCVs) by acellular vaccines (ACVs) in the 1990s. Worldwide, antigenic divergence in vaccine antigens has been found between vaccine strains and circulating strains. In this work, 466 _Bordetella pertussis_ isolates collected in the period 1998-2012 from 13 European countries were characterized by multi-locus antigen sequence typing (MAST) of the pertussis toxin promoter (ptxP) and of the genes coding for proteins used in the ACVs: pertussis toxin (Ptx), pertactin (Prn), type 2 fimbriae (Fim2) and type 3 fimbriae (Fim3). Isolates were further characterised by fimbrial serotyping, multi-locus variable-number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA), and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). The results showed a very similar _B. pertussis_ population for 12 countries using ACVs, while Poland, which uses a WCV, was quite distinct, suggesting that ACVs and WCVs select for different _B. pertussis_ populations. This study forms a baseline for future studies on the effect of vaccination programs on _B. pertussis_ populations.'\n\nTo me, the evolutionary changes in current pertussis strains documented in the USA, Europe and Australia are playing a significant, but not at all the sole role in the upswing of pertussis throughout the world, and alteration of the current vaccine may be needed. - Mod.LL\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/106.]", "summary": "\n\n[byline: Andrew Ozaki]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Nebraska (http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebraska) gets its name from the archaic Otoe words 'ni brasge' meaning 'flat water', after the Platte River that flows through the state. \n\n[byline: Sue Thoms]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Grand Traverse County is located in the north west part of Michigan's Lower Peninsula http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan.

Cases of whooping cough and measles have impacted hundreds of families, overwhelmed local doctors and public health officials, and put parents who don't vaccinate their children on the defensive.\n\n'Nobody likes to be the person who says, 'I told you so,'' but what's unfolding now is exactly the scenario feared by those worried about the region's low immunization numbers, said Dr. Bradley Goodwin, a Traverse City family physician who is president of the Grand Traverse County Medical Society. Grand Traverse County has one of Michigan's highest rates of schoolchildren opting out of vaccines -- twice the state average and 6 times the national rate for kindergartners in 2013-14. In some schools, the rate is even higher. That includes Grand Traverse Academy, the 1200-student charter school associated with the initial outbreak of whooping cough, also known as pertussis, an illness nicknamed 'the 100-day cough.'\n\nA teacher at Grand Traverse Academy was diagnosed with whooping cough on 16 Oct 2014. Once introduced into the school community, the disease took off. To date, a total of 151 confirmed and probable cases of whooping cough have been linked to the school. One reason the illness swept through the academy: A significant number of its students are unvaccinated. In 2013-14, 17 percent of Grand Traverse Academy kindergartners had parents who signed a waiver exempting their children from the required childhood immunizations. 'When you have (pertussis) spread so fast through a school community with high waiver rates, that's not coincidental,' Goodwin said.\n\nAlso fueling the outbreak: When the teacher was 1st diagnosed, students classified as 'close contacts' were told to take antimicrobials as a preventive measure, but not all followed the directive, said Wendy Trute, health director for the Grand Traverse County Health Department. Some parents didn't want to give antibiotics to children who don't seem sick. But whooping cough is contagious before symptoms appear. '2 families didn't get or take antimicrobials, and they account for 8 or 9 of the confirmed cases,' Trute said. 'People not following through (with medical directives) is one of the issues.'\n\nThe school had so many cases of whooping cough that school officials canceled the elementary fall carnival as well as 4 days of classes. While the school was shuttered, the 1200 students were told to stay at home in quarantine to prevent spreading the disease further.\n\nThat was the 2nd week of November 2014. Since then, whooping cough cases have been reported at 14 other school buildings across the region and new cases are still coming in, Trute said.\n\nTrute said about 1/3rd of the pertussis cases in the Traverse City area involve people who are vaccinated. Particularly vulnerable have been children around age 10 or 11, because the immunizations they received in infancy are wearing off and they haven't yet had a booster shot. It didn't help that the outbreak at Grand Traverse Academy started in the upper elementary grades, Trute said. Still, it's clear that unvaccinated children were those most at risk. A state epidemiologist ran the numbers for the Traverse City pertussis outbreak and calculated that children who aren't vaccinated have been 5 times more likely to come down with pertussis than those who have been immunized, Trute said.\n\nThe pertussis outbreak has become a hot-button issue in Traverse City, pitting parents who vaccinate their children against those who don't, said Beth Milligan, a reporter for The Ticker, a Traverse City news website. 'People on the pro-vaccination side are very angry at the anti-vaxers for exposing their children to disease,' Milligan said. Meanwhile, 'the anti-vaxers are latching onto the fact' that some fully vaccinated people are getting whooping cough, which they say proves their point that vaccinations are ineffective, Milligan added.\n\n'A lot of people who don't vaccinate don't see the need,' said Milligan, who wrote an in-depth story in September 2014 about the county's low vaccination rate. 'Many are families who are into holistic medicine,' and feel there are better ways to build the immune system and ward off disease.\n\nThe problem with that thinking, Goodwin said, is that unvaccinated people are much more likely to spread disease compared to those who are immunized, even if the unvaccinated people don't appear sick. 'I'm a big believer in better living through better living,' Goodwin said. 'But while your immune system is fighting off an illness, you can still be contagious and infect others, and those others may not be as healthy as you.'\n\nIf anything, Trute said, the fact the pertussis vaccine is not 100 percent effective is all the more reason to maintain high immunization rates, to prevent the disease from getting a foothold in the community. Her fear, she said, is that what's happening in 2014 will become a semi-regular event in Grand Traverse County.\n\n'It's also helping people to reconsider and re-evaluate their stance against vaccines,' Goodwin added. 'Most people are seeing now that there is a value to getting vaccines, and realizing their previous premise about going without being vaccinated was overzealous.'\n\nTrute agreed there has been a 'fair amount of conversation' in recent weeks about trying to reduce the number of schoolchildren with vaccination waivers. 'A lot of people are becoming vocal now because it's affecting them,' she said. 'I do think it's possible that once we get through this craziness, there will be a call to positive action.'\n\nSome educators are thinking the same way. Susan Wagner-Dameron, director of Grand Traverse Academy, said it is important to remain respectful of parents who choose not to vaccinate their children. But she is also thinking of hosting an immunization clinic at the school next year.\n\nMeanwhile, The Children's House, a Montessori school in Traverse City, which also had a student with whooping cough, has been educating parents on the value of vaccinations.\n\n'I don't think you're ever going to change the minds of some people,' Trute said. 'We're trying to affect people on the fence.' Milligan agreed that some opposed to vaccinations are 'digging in their heels,' but recent events are changing attitudes on vaccinations.\n\n'When you're faced with a highly contagious outbreak, it creates a lot of fear and that fear can be a useful catalyst,' Milligan said. 'Sometimes you need something scary to happen to realize the consequences of not vaccinating.'\n\n[Byline: Julie Mack]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[In a previous posting on the outbreak of pertussis in Grand Traverse County, Michigan, particularly at the Grand Traverse Academy (Pertussis - USA (23), archive no. 20141116.2947034), I wrote, 'With a large jump in probable cases in a number that could represent more than 10 per cent or more of the students, it would be important to know the vaccination status of the school's students.'\n\nIt is now clear that undervaccination at the school (estimated at 17 percent) has played a large role in this outbreak of _Bordetella pertussis_ infection. The truths and untruths surrounding the anti-vaccine movement are complex and multifactorial. What is clear is that today's parents do not appreciate what these vaccine-preventable diseases have produced in their heydays, including pertussis's severe morbidity and mortality in infants less than 3 months of age, the deaths from encephalitis and pneumonia from measles and paralytic disease putting children in Drinker respirators (the 'iron lung') with poliomyelitis.\n\nBut the times and the distrusting mindset of parents are clearly different than in 1955. In the well-publicized Cutter incident in April 1955, more than 200 000 children in 5 Western and Midwestern USA states received a polio vaccine in which the process of inactivating the live virus proved to be defective (1). Within days there were reports of paralysis, and within a month the 1st mass vaccination program against polio had to be abandoned. Subsequent investigations revealed that the vaccine, manufactured by the California-based family firm of Cutter Laboratories, had caused 40 000 cases of polio, leaving 200 children with varying degrees of paralysis and killing 10. Although the vaccination against poliomyelitis took a hit, it was nothing compared to what would have happened to vaccine acceptance if it were to happen today.\n\n1.

Students at 19 schools in the county have been affected by the disease, also known as whooping cough. The county health department has received 3750 calls to the hotline set up to field questions from parents of children who may have been exposed to the illness.\n\nAs they announced the update on the outbreak on Thu 18 Dec 2014, health officials urged residents to get vaccinated in advance of holiday travel and get-togethers. 'Preventing severe disease and death in infants is our highest priority,' said Wendy Trute, the Grand Traverse health officer. 'We urge all pregnant women to get vaccinated. We also urge parents to vaccinate infants as soon as possible.'\n\nA pertussis outbreak was reported in November 2014 at Grand Traverse Academy, a charter school.

Doctors emphasize that the inoculation has led to fewer deaths than in the past and in instances where people do get sick, their illnesses aren't as severe. But California officials say the limited protection of the vaccine introduced in the 1990s has led to the rise in cases. Research has shown it doesn't last as long as the one it replaced, and a new study suggests the vaccine may not prevent the spread of the disease. Whooping cough peaks every 3 to 5 years, and California's last epidemic was in 2010. But despite an aggressive public health campaign in response, the current outbreak is worse.\n\nA total of 9935 cases were reported to the California Department of Public Health from 1 Jan 2014 to 26 Nov 2014, the highest number in 70 years. The cases included an infant who died. Elementary, middle and high school outbreaks have occurred across the state. San Diego County is among the hardest hit areas with 1819 cases reported so far in 2014.\n\n'We'd have to go way back to the 1940s to find more cases,' said Dr Eric McDonald, medical director of the epidemiology and immunization branch for public health services in San Diego County. That's when whooping cough was common, causing hundreds of thousands of illnesses annually and thousands of deaths. But after a vaccine was introduced in the 1940s, cases dropped to fewer than 5000 a year. That vaccine was replaced in the 1990s because of side effects, which included pain and swelling from the shot and fever. The newer vaccine is part of routine childhood vaccinations as well as adult booster shots. [the older killed whole cell vaccine was thought to be too reactogenic in adults. - Mod.LL]\n\n2013 was the nation's worst year for whooping cough in 6 decades; health officials received reports of more than 48 000 cases, including 18 deaths. In 2014, the number of reported cases nationwide dropped to about 20 000.\n\nDr Gil Chavez, epidemiologist with the California Department of Public Health, does not believe low inoculation rates are the primary cause of the current epidemic: Of this year's [2014] pediatric cases that had information on the child's vaccination history, only 10 per cent of those infected in 2014 had not been vaccinated against pertussis. Chavez says the new vaccine's limitations and better tests have led to the increase in cases.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[5] Ohio (Holmes County)\nDate: Thu 18 Dec 2014\nSource: Fox 8 Cleveland [edited]\nhttp://fox8.com/2014/12/18/whooping-cough-concerns-force-78-holmes-county-students-to-stay-home-from-school/\n\n\nThe East Holmes School District [Holmes County, Ohio] is telling 78 students from 2 elementary schools to stay at home after they might have been exposed to whooping cough, and have either not been vaccinated or their vaccinations are not complete. Holmes County Health Department director Dr DJ McFadden said 3 cases of whooping cough, also known as pertussis, have been confirmed in the county.\n\n'It does happen, but it doesn't happen as regularly as it is happening now. I mean, we are back to higher, as high of rates as we had before vaccinations in some parts of the country,' McFadden said.\n\nMcFadden made the recommendation to the school district to keep the kids home to try and limit the spread of the disease. 'They are well at this time and I certainly hope they are excluded for no good reason. There's about a week-long process to display symptoms so these children could be ill and we just don't know it yet so they are excluded as that precaution because if they are sick those symptoms will show up soon and they could be exposing other people at the same time,' said East Holmes superintendent Joe Edinger.\n\nEdinger said parents make decisions regarding the immunizations based on a number of good reasons. 'Maybe history with other children having reactions to the immunizations or for religious and cultural reasons and with that decision they accept the fact that when an outbreak occurs they will be asked to stay home,' Edinger said. Although the county has a large Amish population, Edinger said most of the kids who are being told to stay home are not Amish.\n\nThe timing means students will miss only about a week of classes before Christmas break. They will also miss their school's Christmas activities, but the school and the health district are not stopping them from attending family functions or other community events.\n\n[byline: Dave Nethers]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[6] Texas\nDate: Fri 19 Dec 2014\nSource: KTRE [edited]\nhttp://www.ktre.com/story/27669239/whooping-cough-moves-through-etx\n\n\nIt's a startling sound, especially if you're the parent of a small child. A deep cough with a 'whoop' sound is the sign of pertussis, also called whooping cough. It starts like a cold with a low fever and even a runny nose, but if left untreated, a lingering cough with the recognizable sound could lead to some serious health problems.\n\nThe number of pertussis cases is rising around the country, and has claimed 2 lives in Texas this year [2014]. More than 25 per cent of pertussis cases in children result in a hospital stay, according to health reports. Pediatrician Melanie Wick said adults or teenagers can be the culprits when it comes to spreading pertussis.

The incidence of pertussis in the USA is cyclical, with peaks every 3-5 years, as the number of susceptible persons in the population increases. The last pertussis epidemic in California occurred in 2010, when approximately 9000 cases were reported, including 808 hospitalizations and 10 infant deaths, for a statewide incidence of 24.6 cases per 100 000 population (1). During 1 Jan-26 Nov 2014, a total of 9935 cases of pertussis with onset in 2014 were reported to CDPH, for a statewide incidence of 26.0 cases per 100 000. CDPH is working closely with local health departments to prioritize public health activities, with the primary goal of preventing severe cases of pertussis, which typically occurs in infants. All prenatal care providers are being encouraged to provide tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis vaccine (Tdap) to pregnant women during each pregnancy, ideally at 27-36 weeks' gestation, as is recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) (4), or refer patients to an alternative provider, such as a pharmacy or local public health department, to receive Tdap.\n\nFor this analysis, case report forms with preliminary data on demographics, symptoms, clinical course, and exposures were completed by local and state health department investigators through patient interviews and medical record reviews and were available for 8562 (86 percent) cases. All cases met either the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists definition for confirmed pertussis, its definition for probable pertussis,* or the CDPH definition for suspected pertussis (2).\n\nDisease incidence in California among infants aged less than 12 months was 174.6 cases per 100 000 during 1 Jan-26 Nov 2014, and was significantly higher among Hispanic infants (rate ratio = 1.7; 95 percent confidence interval [CI] = 1.5-2.1) and lower among Asian/Pacific Islander infants (rate ratio = 0.4; CI = 0.3-0.6) than among white, non-Hispanic infants (Table 1 [for Tables, see source URL above. - Mod.LL]). Of 6790 cases with available data, 347 patients had been hospitalized, including 275 (79 percent) who were aged less than 12 months, of whom 214 (62 percent of those hospitalized) were aged less than 4 months. Among hospitalized infants aged less than 12 months with complete information, 33 percent required intensive care; few (24 percent) had received any doses of diphtheria, tetanus, and acellular pertussis vaccine (DTaP) (Table 2). One death was reported in an infant aged 5 weeks at the time of illness onset. 2 additional fatal cases in infants who became ill in 2013 were also reported in early 2014; both were aged less than 5 weeks at the time of illness onset, and 1 was hospitalized for more than a year before succumbing to pertussis-related complications.\n\nOf 211 (50 percent) infants aged less than 4 months whose mothers' Tdap immunization histories were available, only 35 (17 percent) had mothers who reported receiving Tdap at 27-36 weeks' gestation during their most recent pregnancy. Among mothers not vaccinated during pregnancy, 56 (36 percent) received Tdap within 7 days after delivery.\n\nDisease incidence was also high among older children and adolescents, peaking at 137.8 cases per 100 000 among adolescents aged 15 years (Figure [for Figure, see source URL above - Mod.LL]). Among the 2006 cases in adolescents aged 14-16 years, 5 patients (0.2 percent) were hospitalized; 4 were admitted for 2 days or less, and 1 was admitted for 5 days. Among the 83 percent of adolescent cases aged 14-16 years with known vaccination histories, only 2.2 percent reported never receiving any doses of pertussis-containing vaccine. Of those vaccinated adolescents with complete data, 87 percent had previously received the Tdap booster vaccine, and the median length of time since prior Tdap dose was 3 years (range = 0-7 years). Of the 1321 (66 percent) adolescents aged 14-16 years with known race and ethnicity, rates were highest among non-Hispanic white (166.2 cases per 100 000) adolescents and lower among Hispanic (64.2 per 100,000), Asian/Pacific Islander (43.9 per 100 000) and non-Hispanic black (23.7 per 100 000) adolescents.\n\n* Available at http://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/script/casedef.aspx?condyrid=950&datepub=1/1/2014%2012:00:00%20am.\n\nDiscussion\n----------\nBecause infants aged less than 12 months have the greatest risk for hospitalization and death from pertussis, public health strategies have been prioritized towards preventing disease in this age group. During the 2010 pertussis epidemic in California, the main strategy used to protect infants was 'cocooning' (that is, vaccinating contacts of infants so they do not transmit pertussis to the infant). However, this strategy is difficult to implement, and even if all anticipated contacts could be immunized, infants could still be exposed to infected persons in the community.\n\nIn 2011, data became available demonstrating efficient transplacental transfer of antipertussis antibodies to the fetus, which might protect vulnerable infants until they are old enough to receive the primary DTaP series beginning at aged 2 months. In that year, ACIP recommended that pregnant women who had never received Tdap receive a dose after 20 weeks' gestation (3). In 2012, ACIP reviewed data indicating that antipertussis antibody concentrations declined substantially 1 year after vaccination; therefore, ACIP recommended that Tdap be administered during the third trimester of every pregnancy. Since the immune response to Tdap peaks about 2 weeks after administration and the majority of maternal antibodies are acquired by the fetus at 36-40 weeks' gestation, Tdap is currently recommended at 27-36 weeks gestation to optimize antibody transfer and protection at birth (4,5). Preliminary data indicate that infants born to vaccinated mothers have a lower risk for pertussis early in life (6).\n\nVery few mothers of infants with pertussis had received Tdap during pregnancy; many more were vaccinated after delivery, which does not confer any direct protection to the infant and is no longer a preferred strategy. Recently published data indicate that Tdap vaccination coverage among pregnant women was only 19.5 percent in 2012 across California Vaccine Safety Datalink sites (7). Similarly, in a survey conducted at 100 birthing hospitals in California during October 2013, only 25 percent of new mothers reported receiving Tdap during pregnancy, whereas an additional 44 percent received Tdap in the hospital after delivery (CDPH, unpublished data, 2013). However, efforts to increase vaccine coverage have been successful among Northern California Kaiser patients, and in the third quarter of 2014, an estimated 84 percent of pregnant women received Tdap vaccine in their third trimester (T. Flanagan; Northern California Kaiser; personal communications; 26 Nov 2014).\n\nPrenatal care providers should vaccinate all pregnant patients with Tdap during the third trimester of each pregnancy, ideally at 27-36 weeks' gestation, as is recommended by ACIP (4). If Tdap cannot be administered on-site during routine prenatal care visits, CDPH encourages prenatal care providers to take the following steps: 1) provide the patient with a strong recommendation and patient-specific prescription for Tdap; 2) refer the patient to specific alternative sites for vaccine, such as pharmacies, primary care providers, or local health departments; and 3) assess Tdap status at follow-up visits to confirm and record receipt of vaccine. In addition, timely initiation of the primary DTaP infant series is essential for reducing severe disease in young infants. According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, DTaP can be administered to infants at an accelerated schedule, with the first dose administered as early as age 6 weeks, when pertussis is prevalent in the community. Even 1 dose of DTaP might offer some protection against serious pertussis disease in infants (8).\n\nHispanic infants age less than 12 months have the highest and Asian/Pacific Islanders of all ages have the lowest rates of disease compared with other racial and ethnic groups. However, the Hispanic overrepresentation among infants disappeared by age 1 year, and disease incidence among older children and adolescents was highest among non-Hispanic whites, similar to trends reported previously in California (1). Nationally, since the 1990s, Hispanic infants have been noted to have higher rates of reported disease and pertussis-related deaths compared with non-Hispanic infants (8). The causes of these disparities are unknown, and data are needed to assess the contributing factors. Current hypotheses attribute the disparities to larger household size and/or cultural practices that increase the number of persons in contact with young infants.\n\nNotably, the peak age of disease incidence beyond infancy increased to age 14-16 years in 2014 compared with the peak among children aged 10 years during the 2010 pertussis epidemic (1). Children and teenagers born in the USA since 1997 have only received acellular pertussis vaccine, and the upper age of this cohort correlates with the peak age in incidence during both epidemic years. Data available since the 2010 epidemic indicate that immunity conferred by acellular vaccines, particularly when used for the primary series, wanes more rapidly than that conferred by older, whole-cell vaccines that were used in the United States from the 1940s to the 1990s. Because of vaccine safety concerns related to whole-cell pertussis vaccines, acellular pertussis vaccines were developed and recommended in 1992 for the 4th and 5th doses of the pertussis vaccine series and for all 5 doses in 1997. Acellular pertussis vaccines are less reactogenic than whole-cell vaccines, but the immunity conferred by them wanes more quickly. Most of the cases among adolescents aged 14-16 years were among those who had previously received Tdap 3 years or more earlier, suggesting that their illness was the result of waning immunity. It is likely that increased incidence will continue to be observed among this cohort in the absence of a new vaccine or more effective vaccination strategy. Although the highest burden of disease is currently being observed in adolescents aged 14-16 years, severe disease is uncommon at this age, and less than 0.5 percent of reported cases in this age group resulted in hospitalization. More data are needed to assess the potential benefit and timing of Tdap booster doses.\n\nCDPH is working with local public health departments as well as prenatal and pediatric health care providers, with the primary goal of encouraging vaccination of pregnant women and infants. In addition, CDPH is providing free Tdap to local health departments and community health centers to support vaccination of uninsured and underinsured pregnant women and is working to identify and mitigate barriers to Tdap vaccination for pregnant women. CDPH has been working closely with California local health departments to modify guidance for managing the high burden of disease in older children and teenagers, including school outbreaks of pertussis, by prioritizing follow-up of patients and contacts who are at higher risk for developing severe disease (9).\n\nAs long as currently available acellular pertussis vaccines are in use, it is likely that the 'new normal' will be higher disease incidence throughout pertussis cycles. The number of reported cases in 2014 has surpassed that of the 2010 epidemic and represents the most cases reported in California in nearly 70 years (1). However, it is important to put the current pertussis epidemic in historical perspective. In the immediate prevaccine era, there were approximately 157 reported cases of pertussis per 100 000 population in the USA, with 1.5 deaths per 1000 infants (10). Therefore, despite the limitations of currently available pertussis vaccines, they continue to have an important impact on pertussis. Strategies to prevent the most severe cases of pertussis, which occur primarily in young infants, should be prioritized.\n\nReferences\n----------\n1.

Similarly, in a survey conducted at 100 birthing hospitals in California during October 2013, only 25 percent of new mothers reported receiving Tdap during pregnancy, whereas an additional 44 percent received Tdap in the hospital after delivery (CDPH, unpublished data, 2013). \nOf 123 494 women with singleton pregnancies ending in a live birth between 1 Jan 2010, and 15 Nov 2012, 26 229 (21 percent) received Tdap during pregnancy and 97 265 did not. \n\nCDPH is working with local public health departments as well as prenatal and pediatric health care providers, with the primary goal of encouraging vaccination of pregnant women and infants. Children and teenagers born in the USA since 1997 have only received acellular pertussis vaccine, and the upper age of this cohort correlates with the peak age in incidence during both epidemic years. Nationally, since the 1990s, Hispanic infants have been noted to have higher rates of reported disease and pertussis-related deaths compared with non-Hispanic infants (8). CDPH has been working closely with California local health departments to modify guidance for managing the high burden of disease in older children and teenagers, including school outbreaks of pertussis, by prioritizing follow-up of patients and contacts who are at higher risk for developing severe disease (9). \n\nDisease incidence was also high among older children and adolescents, peaking at 137.8 cases per 100 000 among adolescents aged 15 years (Figure [for Figure, see source URL above - Mod. MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep 2013; 63(48); 1129-32 [summ., edited]\nhttp://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6348a2.htm?s_cid=mm6348a2_e\n\n\nPertussis epidemic -- California, 2014\n However, efforts to increase vaccine coverage have been successful among Northern California Kaiser patients, and in the third quarter of 2014, an estimated 84 percent of pregnant women received Tdap vaccine in their third trimester (T. Flanagan; Northern California Kaiser; personal communications; 26 Nov 2014). In the immediate prevaccine era, there were approximately 157 reported cases of pertussis per 100 000 population in the USA, with 1.5 deaths per 1000 infants (10). However, the Hispanic overrepresentation among infants disappeared by age 1 year, and disease incidence among older children and adolescents was highest among non-Hispanic whites, similar to trends reported previously in California (1). Of those vaccinated adolescents with complete data, 87 percent had previously received the Tdap booster vaccine, and the median length of time since prior Tdap dose was 3 years (range = 0-7 years). promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Neonatal pertussis is observed to be especially severe with as much as a 3 percent risk of death.

The number of reported cases in 2014 has surpassed that of the 2010 epidemic and represents the most cases reported in California in nearly 70 years (1).

As of Wed 12 Nov 2014, there are 12 confirmed cases and 161 probable cases of the illness, also known as whooping cough. That is up from 10 confirmed and 83 probable cases 2 days ago.\n\nGrand Traverse Academy administrators chose to close for the week as the number of students and staff with the illness continued to grow. The academy, a K-12 charter school, is closed for all classes, extra-curricular activities and athletic events through Sun 16 Nov 2014 according to a notice posted on the school's website.\n\nArea physician offices, urgent care locations and clinics are bogged down handling the outbreak as Grand Traverse Health Department staff continue to urge any students and teachers to begin a course of preventative antimicrobials. A pertussis hotline designed to coordinate prescriptions has been staffed daily, and the health department staff has responded to more than 900 calls.\n\nStudents, staff members and their families are strongly urged to get the vaccine against pertussis. The CDC recommends vaccinating children in a 5-shot series beginning at 2 months. All children should receive an additional single dose at age 11 that provides additional protection. Adolescents and adults who have not received the vaccination in the past are urged to get a single dose to reduce their risk of contracting or spreading the sickness to others.\n\nEarlier this week, county health officer Wendy Trute shared her hope that those infected would not grow to include other community members. But because the academy's more than 1000 students come from beyond an area that would normally be restricted by district lines, it is very possible that would happen, she said.\n\n[byline: Heidi Fenton]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[With a large jump in probable cases in a number that could represent more than 10 per cent or more of the students, it be important to know the vaccination status of the school's students. - Mod.LL]\n\n******\n[2] California (Santa Barbara County): commentary\nDate: Thu 6 Nov 2014\nSource: The Independent [edited]\nhttp://www.independent.com/news/2014/nov/06/whooping-cough-outbreak-public-health-perspective/\n\n\nWhile today's [6 Nov 2014] headlines in the media highlight the threat of Ebola, and our local health care community has appropriately been planning and preparing for months should this risk materialize, we have a real infectious disease danger already here in Santa Barbara County. 13 cases of pertussis, or whooping cough, have been identified just in the last few weeks. That makes almost 90 cases in our county so far in 2014, the most cases in one year since we have been collecting electronic reporting data, which goes back over 10 years.\n\nWe hope that the children affected fully recover, as whooping cough can cause serious illness. Of the almost 9000 cases statewide in 2014, over 300 resulted in hospitalizations, and there have been a handful of deaths. This is one of the largest epidemics of pertussis statewide in 60 years. What makes this particularly concerning is that whooping cough is largely a vaccine preventable disease.\n\nPertussis is often cyclical in nature, and there have been years of large outbreaks in the past. The vaccine isn't perfect as even those that had the vaccine can sometimes come down with mild symptoms. But a closer look at our current cases and contact tracing finds that almost all of the recent cases were linked to Waldorf School. That could be an unfortunate coincidence, as we always have some naturally occurring cases every year, but would it surprise anyone that this outbreak is occurring at a school where only 28 percent of the children are up-to-date on all of their vaccines?\n\nWhile Waldorf schoolchildren are particularly low in their vaccination rates, it would not be appropriate to assume this problem of unvaccinated children is isolated to that one school. In fact, many local schools fall below our target of having 90 per cent of children fully vaccinated. This is the level at which we generally have 'herd immunity', meaning that the number of vaccinated individuals in a group is sufficiently high enough to prevent an outbreak when someone comes down with the illness. (To find your school or child care center's immunization rates, go to http://www.sbcphd.org).\n\nWhy are there an increasing number of parents filing personal belief exemptions (PBEs) so their children do not need to comply with school vaccination requirements? There are many reasons. A small percentage have legitimate medical conditions or a documented history of adverse reactions that preclude them from safely receiving all of the vaccines. A few may have religious beliefs that do not approve of immunizations. Other parents are simply not adequately informed and still falsely believe there is a link between vaccines and autism: countless research studies have failed to find a causal association. Some believe that their children don't need to be vaccinated because almost everyone else is vaccinated. As mentioned previously, 'herd immunity' only holds when vaccination rates are typically above 90 per cent, and many of the schools where PBEs are common are well below this threshold. Some just don't like seeing their little ones getting all those shots (and I can relate as a parent of 3 young children myself; I still turn away when they get pricked).\n\nAnd yet others are part of a growing group of parents who are highly educated but still choose to file PBEs so their children do not need to get their vaccines upon school entry. For some of them, the miniscule risk, legitimate in their minds or not, is still not worth receiving immunizations because they would rather take the chance that their children catch the diseases naturally, hopefully have only mild symptoms, and develop their own immunity. There are even parties and play dates where parents intentionally expose their children to these vaccine preventable diseases in order for them to get infected and develop immunity.\n\nThe problem with these attitudes is that the diseases can be serious; these parents are rolling the dice that their children will not be one of the unfortunate cases that ends up in the hospital or worse. In addition, there is risk to the larger community. Even if one of these unvaccinated children contracts the illness and recovers fully, others around them -- pregnant women, infants too young to receive vaccines, children and adults with immunologic deficits or cancer -- may contract the disease and not be so fortunate.\n\nWhat can be done about this alarming trend? Several prominent area pediatricians are taking their own measures and have decided they will no longer accept unvaccinated children with PBEs into their medical practices. For them, the risk of vaccine preventable diseases coming in and sitting in their waiting rooms and possibly infecting other children is simply too great.\n\nPublic health professionals, the medical community, and schools also need to do a better job at education and outreach about the safety and efficacy of immunizations. After all, vaccines are one of the greatest public health successes in history. In the early 1900s, here in the USA, there were typically 500 000 cases of measles annually, with 8000 deaths. There were 20 000 cases and 1000 deaths from serious _Haemophilus influenzae_ b (Hib) illnesses, which cause meningitis and pneumonia in children under 5 years of age. There were 100 000 cases of pertussis and 5000 deaths. All of these diseases had been almost driven to zero at the start of the 21st century, and maybe that's why many current parents don't feel the immediate threat. But those very diseases are reemerging, and we need to increase awareness of this fact. We can work with the schools to help us with this effort. Local pediatricians need to be ready for these discussions with facts and may need some guidance on how to persuade reluctant parents. There is action at the state level to tighten up the PBE process to make it more difficult to exempt out of vaccines.\n\nEbola and other new infectious diseases like enterovirus D-68 are scary, and we need to prepare and find effective ways to control them, but there is no current vaccine to protect us against those threats. There is an immunization to prevent pertussis and many other communicable diseases. So, to the parents who choose not to vaccinate their children, I urge you to reconsider. This is not just for the health and well-being of your own children, but for the health of everyone around you, your friends, neighbors, and the community. It is the responsible thing to do.\n\n[byline: Takashi Wada]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Takashi Wada, MD, MPH, is director of the Santa Barbara County Public Health Department. - Mod.LL]\n\n******\n[3] Ohio (Hamilton County)\nDate: Tue 11 Nov 2014\nSource: Fox19 [edited]\nhttp://www.fox19.com/story/27356205/whooping-cough-outbreak-strikes-two-area-schools\n\n\nThe Cincinnati Health Department is reporting outbreaks of pertussis, also known as whooping cough, across the city including Elder High School and Cincinnati Hills Christian Academy. The outbreak at Elder began a month ago with one student and quickly spread to 20 students, but before things got out of hand, Principal Tom Otten says the Cincinnati Health Department was called in.\n\n'One of the students came to the school nurse,' Otten said. 'She realized what she was dealing with at the time, so she alerted the Cincinnati Health Department.' Otten, says the health department advised them to follow a strict protocol when a student or faculty member shows symptoms of pertussis. 'He goes to his physician and either gets a positive or negative. If it comes out negative, then he's allowed back in class. If it comes up positive that he's got whooping cough, then there's a mandatory 5 day antimicrobial treatment,' said Otten.\n\nDuring those 5 days, the student must stay home. Elder school nurse, Linda Giessler says pertussis is highly contagious. 'Pertussis spreads. It can start off like the common cold, you know, cough, sneezing, and because it's respiratory in nature, it's very contagious,' Giessler said.\n\nCustodian Jeff Hillgrove says he uses special wipes to sanitize the entire building because the disease stubbornly clings to surfaces. 'It actually will live on a surface for up to 7 days, so we've been doing this daily, trying to knock it out, get it out of the school building,' Hillgrove said.\n\nSimilar steps are being taken at Cincinnati Hills Christian Academy, which has reported 5 cases of whooping cough.

Vaccination of persons who are not up-to-date for pertussis provides long-term protection. Getting your child the vaccine helps protect them against whooping cough. It also protects other people who cannot get the vaccine, especially newborn babies, who can get very ill and can die from this infection. The division asks that you make sure your family's vaccinations are up-to-date. Older children and adults, including pregnant women, should get a pertussis booster shot called to protect themselves and infants near or around them. If you need the vaccine, contact your doctor. Early treatment of pertussis is very important. If treatment for pertussis is started early in the course of illness, during the 1st one to 2 weeks before coughing attacks occur, symptoms may be lessened.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The state of Nevada can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/35393.

Cases of whooping cough appear to be spreading quickly. At last report, there were 24 confirmed cases of the illness in public and private schools in Staunton. The disease got its name from the sound babies make when they have pertussis or whooping cough. Classrooms are getting a deep cleaning.\n\nHealth officials said some people in the community are on edge after a toddler recently died [in Staunton]. They want everyone to know the child's death had nothing to do with whooping cough.

Another student at the same school tested positive for whooping cough in late September [2014]. A student from Riverside Elementary School [Princeton] also tested positive for whooping cough.\n\nWhooping cough is a highly contagious bacterial disease of the nose, throat, and lungs that causes long bursts of coughing. It is caused by the bacterium _Bordetella pertussis_. Whooping cough can cause violent coughing fits as children choke and gasp for air while making a whooping sound. Adults and older children still get whooping cough, but they may not make the characteristic 'whooping' noise when coughing and are often not diagnosed.\n\nBabies need protection from whooping cough because this disease can make them very sick and is very contagious. People with whooping cough usually spread the disease by coughing or sneezing while in close contact with others, who then breathe in the bacteria that cause the disease. Many babies who get whooping cough are infected by parents, older siblings, or other caregivers who might not even know they have the disease. When babies catch whooping cough, the symptoms can be very serious. Young babies could get pneumonia and many have trouble breathing. About half of babies younger than 1 year of age who get whooping cough end up in the hospital, and a few even die from the disease.\n\nBecause the disease can make babies so sick, and they can catch it from anyone around them, they need protection. If you are pregnant, you'll need the whooping cough vaccine in your 3rd trimester. Surround your baby with vaccinated family members and caregivers and make sure your baby gets all his doses of the whooping cough vaccine according to the CDC's recommended schedule.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The state of New Jersey can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/8024.

Vaccination of the pregnant woman should assist in protecting this susceptible cohort.\n\nA recent paper in Pediatrics (2) included 224 378 children from Minnesota and 179 011 children from Oregon. Both Minnesota and Oregon had very high numbers of pertussis cases in 2010 and 2012. The researchers reviewed 458 of the children in the Minnesota group and 89 of the children in the Oregon group for the full time period studied. Over that time, the number of pertussis cases that occurred rose each year.\n\nDuring the 1st year of follow-up of the study, a rate of 15.6 out of 100 000 children contracted pertussis in Minnesota. By the 6th year of the study, that rate had risen to 138.4 out of 100 000 children. In Oregon, the rate of pertussis in the 1st year was 6.2 out of 100 000 children, which rose to 24.4 out of 100 000 children by the 6th year of the study.\n\nIn Minnesota, a child was twice as likely in the 2nd year of the study as in the 1st year to contract pertussis. By the 6th year, a child was 9 times more likely to catch whooping cough than they were in the 1st year of the study. In Oregon, a child was 30 percent more likely to catch pertussis in the 2nd year of the study than in the 1st year. By the 6th year, children were 4 times more likely to catch pertussis than they were in the 1st year.\n\nAn additional recent publication, in Clinical Infectious Disease (3), utilized a large cohort of young people receiving all of their health care at the Kaiser Permanente Medical Center in San Rafael, California, USA, and reported that a markedly increased risk of pertussis occurred associated with those who received only acellular pertussis vaccine. As compared to those who received at least one dose of the killed, whole cell pertussis vaccine (prior to the switch to all acellular dosing), the relative risk of acquiring pertussis was 8.57 in those receiving 5 doses of the acellular vaccine but fell to a relative risk of 3.55 in those receiving 6 doses of the acellular vaccine.\n\nReferences\n----------\n1.

'We're definitely having an upswing of whooping cough in Shasta County,' said Andrew Deckert, the county's public health officer.\n\nWhile the 28 cases reported so far this year [2014] are quadruple the 7 cases in 2013, and even further from the mere 2 cases the county saw in 2012, health officials weren't caught too off-guard because the disease is cyclical, meaning it tends to have a steep uptick every 3 to 5 years. For example, 2010 saw 32 cases in the same time period in Shasta County, Deckert said.\n\nIn Tehama County, there also has been a massive uptick this year [2014], with 38 reported cases to 2013's zero, according to CDPH data.\n\nDespite the cyclical nature of the illness, the sharp rise in cases is pushing local health officials to remind the public to get vaccinated for the airborne illness that's also known as pertussis. 'Having the disease is absolutely miserable, and I inspire you to get caught up and current on your Tdap [tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis] ... for your own preservation,' Lloyd Braemer, a pediatrician at Mercy Medical Center, said of the 2nd anti-whooping cough shot people are supposed to get after the DtaP shot as young children.\n\nThe vaccines, however, aren't required if parents object to them over philosophical or religious beliefs in California. So while the shot is technically considered mandatory for schoolchildren, it really isn't in California, since parents who object can use a 'personal belief exemption' form to avoid shots for their children. A full 10 percent of 7th-grade students and 8.56 percent of kindergarten students in Shasta County got a belief exemption in the last school year -- a rise from the year before, according to California Department of Public Health.\n\n'Personal belief exemptions definitely have an impact, not only on whooping cough, but other childhood diseases, as well,' said Valerie Lucero, executive director of the Tehama County Health Services Agency.\n\nIn addition to vaccines, there also are preventive antibiotics people can take up to 21 days after suspected exposure to the bacteria.\n\nThe incubation period for the bacterium that causes the illness is 5 to 21 days, Deckert said, after which people start showing general cold symptoms such as coughing and sneezing. But pertussis takes on a life of its own after a while, with the cough becoming so severe that it can induce vomiting or break patients' ribs and last for months.\n\nThe illness isn't just unpleasant -- it can be deadly, especially for infants, the youngest of whom can't be vaccinated, and is incredibly infectious ['contagious' is the appropriate descriptor here, rather than 'infectious'; see below] compared to more common ailments such as the flu. For example, Deckert said each person with the flu generally infects one to 2 other people, but every pertussis patient infects another 12 to 17 people. 'It's a huge difference -- much more infectious than the flu,' Deckert said.\n\nThe illness has hospitalized 288 people statewide, so far this year [2014], including 68 intensive-care stays, according to the California Department of Public Health. There also have been 3 deaths, so far in 2014, though 2 of those happened in children who contracted the illness in 2013. All told, 8278 people statewide have contracted the disease, so far this year, compared to 1249 in roughly the same period last year.\n\nBraemer said he hasn't seen many cases of whooping cough this year [2014]. 'I kept waiting for it. I haven't seen squat,' Braemer said. But, he said, it's also not the holiday season yet, when people traveling to more populous areas are likely to bring the illness back with them. 'I would think the travel time at Thanksgiving is going to be clinically relevant to rapidly spreading the pertussis disease, because we don't need to fly anywhere to get the heavy-hitters -- we just need to drive to the greater regions of California,' he said.\n\nFor information on [Shasta] county's shot clinics, call 530-225-5591. In Tehama County, call 530-527-6824. Whooping cough vaccines are recommended for everyone 6 weeks old and older, including pregnant women in their 3rd trimester, regardless of whether they were vaccinated earlier.\n\n[Byline: Alayna Shulman]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The term 'infectious' refers to the ability of an organism to cause disease, while 'contagious' refers to its ability to spread from person to person. Some organisms can be infectious without being contagious.\n\nThere were 7980 cases of pertussis in California reported statewide as of the 3rd week in September (2014), according to a news report posted recently by ProMED-mail (Pertussis - USA (19): (CA) increasing incidence, update 20140921.2792202). There are now 8278 cases statewide so far this year, compared to 1249 in the same period last year (2013), according to the news report above.\n\nPertussis has been on the increase throughout most of the world. This has been attributed in part to increased virulence and other genetic changes in the circulating clones of _Bordetella pertussis_, as well as waning or an ineffective immune response after vaccination.

DTaP is given to children younger than 7 years of age, and Tdap is given to older children and adults. Children should get 5 doses of DTaP, one dose at each of the following ages: 2, 4, 6, and 15 through 18 months and 4 through 6 years. Adolescents 11 through 18 years of age (preferably at age 11-12 years) should receive a single dose of Tdap. One dose of Tdap is also recommended for adults 19 years of age and older who did not get Tdap as an adolescent. Expectant mothers should receive Tdap during each pregnancy, preferably at 27 through 36 weeks. Tdap should also be given to 7-10 year olds who are not fully immunized against pertussis. (Upper-case letters in these abbreviations denote full-strength doses of diphtheria (D) and tetanus (T) toxoids and pertussis (P) vaccine. Lower-case 'd' and 'p' denote reduced doses of diphtheria and pertussis used in the adolescent/adult-formulations. The 'a' in DTaP and Tdap stands for 'acellular,' meaning that the pertussis component contains only a part of the pertussis organism.)\n\nAntibiotic post exposure prophylaxis is used in all asymptomatic household contacts within 21 days of onset of cough in the index patient with pertussis and in persons within 21 days of exposure who are at high risk of developing severe pertussis and in persons who will have close contact with those at high risk of developing severe pertussis such as infants aged less than 12 months and women in their 3rd trimester of pregnancy, immunocompromised persons, and patients with moderate to severe medically treated asthma (http://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/outbreaks/PEP.html). - Mod.ML\n\nThe state of can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/204.

'We are seeing more than we would expect right now,' said Haley Philips, a Virginia Department of Health epidemiologist, this week. The increase is in the department's Southwestern region of Virginia, which encompasses an area that includes Alleghany, the Cumberland Plateau, Central Virginia, Mount Rogers, New River, Pittsylvania County/Danville, Lenowisco, Roanoke, and West Piedmont.\n\nPhilips would not identify the number of cases occurring either in Lynchburg or the Southwestern region, but according to Virginia Department of Health surveillance reports, 18 Virginians died as a result of pertussis in October [2014], the most recent month for which data is available. [It is unlikely that the figure quoted was for deaths from pertussis. - Mod.LL]\n\nNone of those cases occurred in the Central Virginia Health District, which includes Lynchburg and the counties of Appomattox, Amherst, Bedford, and Campbell. Philips said Tue, 9 Dec 2014, that 'pertussis is always a concern' for health departments. Pertussis is one of a number of diseases the health department continually monitors.

The school also conducted on-site immunizations for roughly 30 students who had not yet received pertussis, or whooping cough, vaccinations, East High School Principal Paul Sagers said. 'We've personally called every student who has not been immunized,' Sagers said. 'We have basically told them that they need to be immunized.' The school's quick reaction to contain the cluster comes as whooping cough cases have declined in Utah, after a spike 2 years ago.\n\nThere have been 748 confirmed cases of whooping cough in Utah in 2014, according to Rebecca Ward, a health educator with the Utah Department of Health. That's down from 1132 at this time in 2013. In 2012, there were 1544 cases.\n\nUnlike the cold or flu, which peak during the winter season, pertussis circulates throughout the year, said Ward. Schools in Weber County and Sevier County were hit with outbreaks in February and May 2014. 'It's not as high as it has been and that's a good thing,' Ward said. 'We're probably not going to get to 1000 cases by the end of 2014.'\n\nSalt Lake County health officials were told of the 1st case of whooping cough 2 weeks ago, department spokeswoman Pamela Davenport said.

Within the past week, students in the Nebraska City and Syracuse districts [Otoe County] have contracted pertussis. Nebraska City School Superintendent Dr Jeff Edwards tells KMA News reports were received from students at Nebraska City Middle School and Hayward Elementary School. Edwards says school officials worked with the Southeast District Health Department to inform students and parents about the illnesses.\n\n'Through the health department,' said Edwards, 'we received a letter from them, and then a fax sheet, that we mailed out to all of our parents in the middle school and at Hayward. Basically, that fact sheet talked about what parents should look for, what are some of the symptoms of the whooping cough, and if their child has not received immunization, how they can go about doing that.' Edwards says it's hard to tell how many students contracted whooping cough.\n\n'There's a lot of crud going around out there,' he said. 'Whether it's from the pertussis or whooping cough, or whether it's from the general flu, I would say our numbers (of absences) are typical for this time of year. Anytime you've got weekends where it's 60 deg F [15.5 deg C], and the next day, it's 20 [deg F/-6.6 deg C], wearing a jacket and not wearing a jacket, there's all kinds of different factors out there.'\n\n[Byline: Mike Peterson]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The state of Nebraska can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/43100.

'I've been in public health since 1984 and I have never seen anything like this,' Tooker said.\n\nThere were 4 cases of whooping cough in Allegan County in 2011. Tooker said that was typical. In 2012, there were 27 cases. There were 25 case in 2013. There have already been 26 cases in 2014. 21 of those have happened since August. Most have affected Hamilton High School students, but there have also been cases reported involving middle school students.\n\nTooker said there are many more cases that his office expected, even though the number of cases has been on the rise for the last decade. The problem isn't that the children getting sick haven't received their pertussis vaccination. All of the Hamilton students who have been diagnosed with the illness have been properly vaccinated.\n\n'We recognize, in all likelihood, the vaccine doesn't produce long-term immunity like it used to,' Tooker said.\n\nThe CDC says the problem is nationwide. In 2012, there were 48 277 cases in the US -- the most since 1955. Whooping cough claimed 20 lives nationwide that year. Most of the deaths were of infants under the age of 3 months.\n\nThe Michigan Department of Community Health says there have been 1079 cases through 30 Nov 2014. In 2013, there were 766 in the same time period -- that's a 41 percent increase. There have been no whooping cough deaths in Allegan County. But there have been a few in the state in the last couple of years. Tooker said that is unacceptable. He said that even given waning efficacy, vaccination is still the best protection.\n\nTooker said he expects the CDC to begin convening expert panels to address the issue. He said that there currently seems to be no end in sight to the steady increase in the number of cases.\n\n[Byline: Steve Kelso and 24 Hour News 8 web staff]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The state of Michigan can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/225.

Building on a surge of 50 additional cases per week in the spring months, the county continues to lead the state by a wide margin in the rate of pertussis cases this year [2014].\n\nThe most recent report from the California Department of Public Health shows almost 7980 cases in the state, 684 of them in Sonoma County, leading to 5 hospitalizations but no deaths. While larger counties have had more cases, the incidence rate in Sonoma tops the list, over 137 cases per 100 000 persons. The next highest rates lag far behind, about 93/100 000 in Napa County, followed by 80 in Marin. Overall, the state rate is 20.9 per 100 000.\n\nThe geographical focus of the highest rates of pertussis does not escape Dr. Karen Holbrook, the deputy health officer for the county's Department of Health Services. 'That's how it spreads, person to person, and our populations between counties do intermix.'\n\nAs students returned to primary and secondary schools last month, they were faced with stricter requirements for immunizations against communicable diseases. Since 1962, California has required certain vaccinations for children starting kindergartens, including whooping cough. Additionally, now students entering 7th grade are required to have an up-to-date Tdap vaccination (which covers tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis). But a disturbing number of parents are pursuing the 'personal belief exemption' (PBE) option for their children, refusing some or all of the inoculations due, in many cases, to fears of vaccines and their perceived side effects.\n\n'I do have concerns about the rate of PBEs and the number of people not getting vaccinations -- it poses a risk to the individual and those around them,' said Holbrook. The side effects of refusing vaccination are themselves cause for concern, since the so-called 'herd immunity' theory holds that for a population at large to be resistant to wide-spread outbreaks of diseases like pertussis, at least 90 percent and preferably 95 percent or more should be immunized.\n\n'We are close to 90 percent overall, across Sonoma County,' said Dr. Holbrook. 'Do I want it to be better? Absolutely. But we also have pockets where it's not that. West County is an area where the proportion of kindergarteners that are up to date on all vaccines is lower. It's 67 percent in that area, but it varies by school between 23 percent and 91 percent.'\n\nPetaluma City Schools' elementary district overall had approximately 15 percent of parents sign PBE for the 2013-14 school year, for a vaccination rate around 85 percent, below the margin needed for herd immunity. While some schools boast 100 percent vaccination compliance, like St. Vincent de Paul Elementary, others have unusually low compliance. Only 35.7 percent of 7th graders at Live Oak Charter have received a Tdap immunization, a school where 2/3rds of parents have signed PBE.\n\nNumbers are only slightly better for the kindergarten immunization program, with vaccinations at Live Oak Charter under 44 percent and PBEs at 56 percent. Mary Collins Charter School has the next highest rate of PBEs among kindergarteners, at 25 percent. The figures cited are for the 2013-14 school year, according to the state's Shotsforschools.org website. Results for the current school year's [2014-15] immunization rates will not be available until October [2014] at the earliest, according to Petaluma public schools nurse Darian Chandler.\n\nBut she has reason to hope the numbers will improve this year [2014]. 'The law changed [1 Jan 2014], which no longer gives a parent the right to walk into school, register their child and sign an immunization waiver so their kid can start school,' she said, referring to AB 2109. 'Now they have to go to a medical provider with an appointment, sit down with the provider and go over the (risks of) lack of immunization in the hopes that the provider can convince the parent to start immunization.' That provider then must co-sign the PBE request to validate it.\n\nThe Tdap immunization now required for 7th-graders, and recommended for adults, was approved about 10 years ago as a replacement for the once-every-decade TD (tetanus-diphtheria) shots. 'Tdap' refers to tetanus-diphtheria-acelluar pertussis, the 'acellular' being a less potent form of immunization, but one with fewer side-effects.\n\nTdap shots are also recommended for pregnant women during their 3rd trimester with each pregnancy, as well as others who will be around newborns, such as parents and grandparents. This is because, Holbrook emphasizes, infants too young to be fully immunized are at highest risk for severe illness.\n\n'When we had grandchildren,' said Chandler, 'everyone in our family all went in and got a pertussis booster, even the great grandfather who was 90 years old.'\n\nThe recent PBS Nova program, 'Immunization -- Calling the Shots' that aired [10 Sep 2014] outlines the current issue and its historical context, not just for pertussis but measles, polio and other vaccine-preventable diseases as well. Chandler herself affirmed that of the people she has worked with in medicine, 'We all strongly support immunization because we've seen what happens. We've seen the infant that died of pertussis, and I've seen polio in the 50s and 60s.' She recalled caring for polio patients in iron lungs, and pointed out that polio has been all but wiped out in the US thanks to immunization.\n\nNow, she says, 'It shocks me when people do not immunize their children against polio.' And it's not just polio: 'In family practice pediatric care there are people that come in, they want the waiver signed, and there's no way to convince them that the immunizations are safe, much safer than they used to be. The risk of getting the disease outweighs any statistical risk of complications.'\n\nThe new requirement that parents consult with physicians about the risks of immunization should help increase immunization rates -- at least that's the purpose of AB 1209. But a law on its own cannot change people's behavior. Holbrook intends to focus on making this dialog productive in the near future by convening a task force to develop best practices for clinicians to work with vaccine-hesitant parents.\n\n'I don't want to vilify people choosing to exempt, I want to work with them,' said Holbrook. 'I want them to work with their providers to address their concerns and their fears. If it becomes an antagonistic relationship, then the listening shuts down.'\n\n[Byline: Christian Kallen]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[There were 6930 cases of pertussis in California reported statewide as of the 1st week in August (2014), according to a news report posted recently by ProMED-mail (Pertussis - USA (16): (CA) increased incidence, update 20140809.2675224).

The overall incidence rate for the state is 20.9 per 100 000.\n\nPertussis has been on the increase throughout most of the world.

DTaP is given to children younger than 7 years of age, and Tdap is given to older children and adults. Children should get 5 doses of DTaP, one dose at each of the following ages: 2, 4, 6, and 15 through 18 months and 4 through 6 years. Adolescents 11 through 18 years of age (preferably at age 11-12 years) should receive a single dose of Tdap. One dose of Tdap is also recommended for adults 19 years of age and older who did not get Tdap as an adolescent. Expectant mothers should receive Tdap during each pregnancy, preferably at 27 through 36 weeks. Tdap should also be given to 7-10 year olds who are not fully immunized against pertussis. (Upper-case letters in these abbreviations denote full-strength doses of diphtheria (D) and tetanus (T) toxoids and pertussis (P) vaccine. Lower-case 'd' and 'p' denote reduced doses of diphtheria and pertussis used in the adolescent/adult-formulations.

The illness can turn deadly. It starts as a persistent cough and runny nose followed by weeks of rapid coughing fits. Pertussis is more common in the very young or very old, but if you're not protected, you're not immune.\n\n'Whooping cough is something that's prevented, and your child could die, your parent could die,' stated Dr Lila Schmidt.\n\nThe numbers are staggering -- record-breaking, in fact. There have been 1183 cases of pertussis or whooping cough in San Diego County so far this year [2014]. Last year, there was a total of 431 cases. Although the very contagious respiratory bacteria peaks every 3 to 4 years, this is shocking public health officials.\n\nSo what can you do to protect your family? Get vaccinated, says Dr Schmidt, especially if you're pregnant.\n\n'It's a series of 5 -- not just one and good to go. It's starts at a couple months old; by the time you are 5, you are finished with the series. Kids in the old days were okay, but now, a lot of parents opt out of vaccinations.'\n\nDr Schmidt says now is not the time to avoid having your child get shots as whooping coughs whip through the county. It's risk versus reward, she says. To prevent the spread of the bacteria, wash your hands with soap and hot water. Use hot towels to dry your hands, avoid hand sanitizers and those air-dry machines. If you are healthier, your chances of getting a disease -- even if you're exposed -- go down.\n\n'I would get vaccinated and do the basics mom taught you: wash your hands, get enough sleep, eat vegetables, drink water, and if someone is sick, stay away from them.'\n\nThey sound like simple reminders, but wash your hands before you eat, use your knuckle to call for the elevator, cough into your elbow.

Several other states, including Ohio, California, and Florida, are reporting similar increases.\n\n'Children are routinely recommended to receive a series of pertussis vaccine doses in infancy and early childhood,' said Dr Matthew Davis, chief medical executive of MDCH. 'Adolescents and adults should receive a booster dose of the vaccine. In addition, pregnant women should get a booster in the 3rd trimester of each pregnancy to help protect newborns, who are most vulnerable to the illness in the 1st few months of life.'\n\nPertussis is a respiratory infection caused by a bacterium that results in a prolonged illness. Severe coughing episodes are often accompanied by vomiting and difficulty breathing. In some cases, a characteristic 'whooping' noise is heard as the afflicted person tries to catch their breath.\n\nOnce extremely common, vaccines developed in the US starting in the mid-1940s and helped drive down the occurrence of pertussis. But in recent decades, pertussis has been making a comeback.\n\n'Part of the challenge,' Davis explained, 'is that immunity to pertussis wears off, so getting a booster vaccine dose later in life can help extend the protection. Our primary focus is on preventing the disease in babies -- they have smaller airways and less developed respiratory systems, which puts them at higher risk for severe cases as well as hospitalization and death from pertussis.'\n\nBabies get a 1st dose of the vaccine at 2 months of age, but they are not optimally protected until completing the series of several more doses over the next year and half. MDCH strongly recommends that adults or adolescents who will be around infants receive the recommended pertussis booster vaccine dose, and that all residents receive their vaccines on time.\n\nIf you are uncertain about whether you or your children have had all recommended vaccines and doses, speak with your doctor or contact your local health department.

The locations are listed below.\n\n'The county and the state are experiencing an epidemic of pertussis,' said Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. 'Infants are at greatest risk for severe illness and death from pertussis, so we are urging parents to vaccinate their children and pregnant women to be vaccinated to protect their babies.'\n\nThere have been 895 confirmed cases of pertussis in 2014. There were only 120 cases reported at this same time last year [2013] and a total of 431 in [all of] 2013. Pertussis activity hit a record high in 2010 with 1179 cases.\n\nA typical case of pertussis starts with a cough and runny nose for one to 2 weeks, followed by weeks to months of rapid coughing fits that sometimes end with a whooping sound (http://www.whoopingcough.net/sound%20of%20whooping%20cough%20with%20much%20whooping.htm). Fever, if present, is usually mild. Antibiotics can lessen the severity of symptoms and prevent the spread of disease to others.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends the following vaccination schedule: Young children need 5 doses of DTaP by kindergarten: at 2 months, 4 months, 6 months, 15 to 18 months and 4 to 6 years; All students entering 7th grade need proof of a whooping cough booster immunization (Tdap). A Tdap booster is recommended for pregnant women during their 3rd trimester of each pregnancy, even if they got a booster before becoming pregnant. One dose of Tdap is recommended for adults 19 years of age and older who did not get Tdap as an adolescent.\n\nParents can obtain the DTaP vaccine series and the Tdap booster shot for themselves and their children through their primary care physicians. Local retail pharmacies offer vaccinations for a fee, and anyone who is not covered by a medical insurance plan can get the shot from a County Public Health Center at minimal or no cost (http://www.sdcounty.ca.gov/hhsa/programs/phs/immunization_branch/immunizations_free_for_children_under_age_two.html).\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[2]\nDate: Sat 19 Jul 2014\nSource: Daily Democrat [edited]\n<ww.dailydemocrat.com/breakingnews/ci_26180864/number-yolo-county-whooping-cough-cases-doubled-past>\n\n\nIn the midst of a state-wide whooping cough epidemic, the number of Yolo County cases jumped from 37 to 80 in the past month. [Yolo County is a relatively rural agricultural region located in the Sacramento Valley immediately east of Napa County and is included in the Sacramento-Roseville-Arden-Arcade, CA Metropolitan Statistical Area (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yolo_County,_California#Adjacent_counties).]\n\n'We have already seen over 5400 cases of pertussis in California this year [2014] as compared to a total of 2372 cases in all of 2013,' said Constance Caldwell, Yolo County health officer. 'In Yolo County, we have seen nearly 80 cases so far in 2014, compared to 4 cases in all of 2013.' These cases represent ages from 6 weeks to 60 years old.\n\nHealth officials continue to be alarmed that the number of cases has soared since 1 Jan [2014], with the traditional peak month of July [2014]. As of 11 Jul 2014, the number of cases is now at 5393, more than double the 2532 reported for all of 2013, according to the state's Department of Public Health. As of 10 Jun 2014, there had been only 3458 reported cases, for an increase of 1935 in the past month.\n\nWhooping cough, or pertussis, is a bacterial illness which causes severe coughing fits that can last for weeks, according to Caldwell. It is spread easily by coughing on others and is most dangerous in young infants who can become severely ill very quickly and even die from it.\n\nPertussis is cyclical and peaks every 3 to 5 years. The last peak in California occurred in 2010, so it is likely another peak is underway, according to the California Department of Public Health.\n\nAlthough Yolo County cases shot up to 80 in the past month, Marin, Napa and Sonoma counties [counties just north of the city of San Francisco] have the highest whooping cough rates in the state, with 168, 124, and 589 cases, respectively.\n\n'The symptoms of pertussis vary by age,' Caldwell said. 'For children, a typical case of pertussis starts with a cough and runny nose for one to 2 weeks. The cough then worsens, and children may have rapid coughing spells that end with a whooping sound.'\n\nOverall whooping cough rates are highest for babies under one year old, followed by adolescents and teens from 10 to 17 years old, with the peak age at 15 years old, according to the California Department of Public Health.\n\n'Young infants may not have typical pertussis symptoms and may have no apparent cough,' Caldwell noted. 'Parents may describe episodes in which the infant's face turns red or purple.' For adults, pertussis may simply be a cough that persists for several weeks.\n\n'Prevention of the illness with the vaccine is the best course of action,' she said. 'However, immunity from pertussis is not life-long.'\n\nInfants too young to be fully immunized remain most vulnerable to severe and fatal cases of pertussis. Two infant deaths have been reported and 2/3rds of pertussis hospitalizations have been in children 4 months or younger. One of the deaths was a 2-month-old infant who was 5 weeks old at time of disease onset.\n\nThe Tdap vaccination for pregnant women is the best way to protect infants who are too young to be vaccinated. All pregnant women should be vaccinated with Tdap in the 3rd trimester of each pregnancy, regardless of previous Tdap vaccination. Pertussis antibodies are transferred from vaccinated mothers to their infants and will help protect them until they are old enough to be vaccinated. In addition, infants should be vaccinated as soon as possible. The 1st dose of pertussis vaccine can be given as early as 6 weeks of age.\n\n'Students entering 7th grade also receive a booster dose, as should health care workers and others working with infants and young children,' Caldwell said.\n\n[Byline: Sarah Dowling]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Pertussis has been on the increase throughout most of the world.

'We are off to a really bad start in 2014,' said state epidemiologist Gil Chavez, of the California Department of Public Health, during a phone call with reporters on Friday.\n\nChavez delivered his comments as the state health department released a new report summarizing the latest data on this year's [2014] pertussis, or whooping cough, epidemic. Of this year's cases thus far, 3614, or 84 percent, have occurred in patients 18 or younger. Out of 142 illnesses that required hospitalization, 89, or 63 percent, were in infants 4 months old or younger.\n\nA total of 3 babies in the state have died from pertussis infections in 2014, Chavez said, though 2 of those will be attributed to 2013's case count because they initially became ill in 2013.\n\nBecause infants less than a year old are at the highest risk of hospitalization and death from pertussis, and because babies generally do not receive pertussis vaccinations until they're 8 weeks old, Chavez said that all pregnant women should receive a dose of the Tdap vaccine during their 3rd trimester.\n\n'Vaccination of pregnant women is the most important thing that can be done to protect infants,' he said, because the mothers' antibodies can get passed along to their newborns.\n\nBased on historical patterns, Chavez said, it is likely that disease activity will remain high throughout the summer. But he said it was too soon to know if this year [2014] would be worse than 2010, the last year pertussis peaked. That year, more than 9000 Californians were sickened with the disease.\n\n[Byline: Eryn Brown]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The number of cases of pertussis over time tends to have upswing cycles every 3-5 years, but the case increases have been greater and more prolonged in the past several years.

Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 2013; 111(2): 787-92.\n\n'Significance\n-------------\nPertussis has reemerged as an important public health concern since current acellular pertussis vaccines (aP) replaced older whole-cell vaccines (wP). In this study, we show nonhuman primates vaccinated with aP were protected from severe symptoms but not infection and readily transmitted _Bordetella pertussis_ to contacts. Vaccination with wP and previous infection induced a more rapid clearance compared with naive and aP-vaccinated animals. While all groups possessed robust antibody responses, key differences in T-cell memory suggest that aP vaccination induces a suboptimal immune response that is unable to prevent infection. These data provide a plausible explanation for pertussis resurgence and suggest that attaining herd immunity will require the development of improved vaccination strategies that prevent _B. pertussis_ colonization and transmission.\n\nAbstract\n--------\nPertussis is a highly contagious respiratory illness caused by the bacterial pathogen _Bordetella pertussis_. Pertussis rates in the United States have been rising and reached a 50-year high of 42 000 cases in 2012. Although pertussis resurgence is not completely understood, we hypothesize that current acellular pertussis (aP) vaccines fail to prevent colonization and transmission. To test our hypothesis, infant baboons were vaccinated at 2, 4, and 6 months of age with aP or whole-cell pertussis (wP) vaccines and challenged with _B. pertussis_ at 7 months. Infection was followed by quantifying colonization in nasopharyngeal washes and monitoring leukocytosis and symptoms. Baboons vaccinated with aP were protected from severe pertussis-associated symptoms but not from colonization, did not clear the infection faster than naive animals, and readily transmitted _B. pertussis_ to unvaccinated contacts. Vaccination with wP induced a more rapid clearance compared with naive and aP-vaccinated animals. By comparison, previously infected animals were not colonized upon secondary infection. Although all vaccinated and previously infected animals had robust serum antibody responses, we found key differences in T-cell immunity. Previously infected animals and wP-vaccinated animals possess strong _B. pertussis_- specific T helper 17 (Th17) memory and Th1 memory, whereas aP vaccination induced a Th1/Th2 response instead. The observation that aP, which induces an immune response mismatched to that induced by natural infection, fails to prevent colonization or transmission provides a plausible explanation for the resurgence of pertussis and suggests that optimal control of pertussis will require the development of improved vaccines.'\n\nMore evidence continues to accumulate regarding issues revolving around the protective efficacy of the current acellular pertussis vaccines and the need for an improvement in the current product. - Mod.LL]", "summary": "A ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n Communicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The state of Alabama can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/8322.

But so far, we've seen 179 reports in 2014 and it's only June.\n\nThe Idaho Department of Health and Welfare says a large part of the problem could be that many people aren't staying up to date on their Tdap [combined tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis] vaccination. It's a shot most people get as a child, but booster shots are required to keep the vaccine active. When enough older children and adults neglect to get their boosters, whooping cough can begin spreading.\n\nNearly 1/3 of 2014's infections have been in newborns who are too young to get the vaccination and have a harder time fighting off the cough. 'Babies under 6 months, very often they're hospitalized,' said Sarah Correll, an epidemiologist at Central District Health Department in Boise. 'And when they're less than 4 months they definitely can die, so it is important that everyone in the home stay up to date on their vaccines and they protect the baby while it's trying to build up its immunity.'\n\nAccording to Health and Welfare, there has been one death due to whooping cough in Idaho in 2014, and it was a baby.\n\n[Byline: Jacqulyn Powell]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The state of Idaho can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/215. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ]\n\n******\n[3] Pennsylvania (Allegheny County)\nDate: Wed 18 Jun 2014\nSource: Pittsburgh Tribune-Review [edited]\nhttp://triblive.com/news/healthnews/6300738-74/pertussis-cases-vaccine#axzz35T0GHSER\n\n\nAt least 50 people in Allegheny County have come down with whooping cough in 2014, putting the region on pace for one of its worst bouts in a decade with the respiratory disease. Most of the reported cases involve school-age children, all of whom recovered, according to county health officials. North Allegheny in McCandless was the most recent school district to confirm cases, announcing in June 2014 that 2 high school students contracted the bacterial ailment that doctors call pertussis.\n\n'It's probably going to be on the high side this year. Usually, we get 50 or less' cases, said Dr Kristen Mertz, a medical epidemiologist at the Allegheny County Health Department. Although the department hasn't listed any pertussis-linked deaths in 2014, the disease is blamed in at least 2 fatalities in California, where an epidemic led to more than 3450 cases since January 2014. Reported cases nationwide topped 24 000 in 2013, about half the tally from 2012 but up from 11 651 in 2003, according to the CDC.\n\nThe illnesses in 2012 marked one of the largest pertussis epidemics since the 1950s and could foreshadow worse outbreaks, said Dr Wilbert van Panhuis, an assistant professor of epidemiology at the University of Pittsburgh. 'It was almost as bad as it was before the vaccine was introduced,' said van Panhuis. Early pertussis shots went mainstream starting in the late 1940s.\n\n'You're seeing adults and teenagers getting pertussis because their vaccinations are not working well,' van Panhuis said. He said that trend, paired with some people's reluctance over vaccinations, might lead to more epidemics until pharmaceutical manufacturers introduce another pertussis vaccine. Preliminary state health data last month suggested as many as 177 confirmed pertussis cases in Pennsylvania since January 2014. The state recorded 633 cases in 2013, down from 1934 in 2012. Doctors said cyclical peaks in case volumes typically develop every 3 to 5 years.\n\nThe CDC is investigating the waning effectiveness of the current pertussis inoculation, given as part of so-called DTap [diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis vaccine for children 2 months through 6 years of age] and Tdap vaccines. 'The message isn't that the vaccine is no good. It's still good. It's still effective,' Dr. Mertz said. 'Most kids are not getting the disease.'\n\n[Byline: Adam Smeltz]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The state of Pennsylvania can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/3520.

'We have been so inundated (with patients showing symptoms) we have cancelled routine well-baby visits,' she said. That reason is 2-fold -- to be able to care for those affected and to keep healthy children from being exposed from pertussis.\n\n'We have reorganized our clinic space and staff to handle the influx of patients,' she said. 'It has been this way for several weeks but increased in severity recently.' A diagnostic culture takes 10 days to 2 weeks to receive results. The results go to the state for confirmation. A quicker test, the respiratory DFA [direct fluorescent antibody] test, is done in 2 to 3 days. 'Many of the preliminary results are positive for pertussis. Cultures are pending on those,' she said.\n\nAnderson said patients who have been exposed and are showing symptoms are being tested and treated. Those who had had been exposed but are not yet showing symptoms are being tested and also treated due to the outbreak. 'In all cases, we evaluate the vaccine status for the patient and family members and vaccinate if indicated,' she said. 'Treatment is antibiotics. You have to be on antibiotics for 5 days before you aren't considered contagious.'\n\nThe increased number of cases in Spearfish prompted one childcare facility to close its doors until 2 Jun 2014. The board of directors at Children First, in Spearfish, held an emergency meeting where they voted to shut down for the rest of the school year.\n\nEarlier in May 2014, the South Dakota Department of Health released information stating that 23 children had tested positive for the disease.

Whooping cough, or pertussis, is a bacterial lung infection that poses a serious risk to babies. Adults can show much milder symptoms, which can help in its spread.\n\n'With those individuals they can actually have pertussis, have a mild cough and not know it, and then pass it on to vulnerable infants,' said Dr David Sabapathy, the province's deputy chief health officer. The outbreak started with 6 confirmed cases in February 2014. There are now 24. A total of 4 babies have been hospitalized.\n\nMost of the cases in this outbreak happened in Western PEI. Several of those afflicted were not immunized, he said, but should have been. 'It often will happen in pockets of people, in communities that are under-immunized with pertussis vaccine, so we encourage you to get your vaccine,' said Sabapathy.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[A ProMED-mail/HealthMap interactive map showing Prince Edward Island is available at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/270.]\n\n******\n[2] British Columbia (Haida Gwaii)\nDate: Wed 21 May 2014\nSource: Haida Gwaii Observer [edited]\nhttp://www.haidagwaiiobserver.com/Article.aspx?id=27267\n\n\nOf the 22 confirmed cases of pertussis (whooping cough) on the North Coast [of British Columbia Province], 20 of them are on the islands [Haida Gwaii], according to a Northern Health press release this week.

She was immediately prescribed antibiotics and said she is now just hoping the baby, which is due next week, will not be born until the 5-day cycle of antibiotics is over. 'It can be fatal for a newborn,' she said, and described herself upset and angry with the situation. 'I wish people were more aware of how this affects other people,' she said. 'It's your choice whether you immunize or not, but it's not all about you and your own little world.'\n\nMs Boutette said the people Northern Health worries about most are women in their 3rd trimester of pregnancy and infants under one year old. 'We're asking anyone who has signs or symptoms to go to a clinic, get swabbed and notify Northern Health if they've been in contact with infants or a pregnant woman.

Because of a large number of exposed and ill individuals in a very well-defined area, we are considering this a local outbreak,' states Dr. Alexander Brzezny, Grant County Health Officer. He adds, 'Preventing severe disease and death in infants is our highest priority. We urge all pregnant women to get vaccinated and urge parents to vaccinate infants and children if they are not up to date.' More cases related to this location are likely.\n\nIn an effort to control the spread of the disease, the Grant County Health Officer has recommended antibiotics for a defined number of individuals who have come into close contact, been housed with, or transported together with the ill individuals. Antibiotics are not recommended to the general public. The highest priority is given to those who come in contact with children under 12 months of age, to pregnant women and those with certain lung conditions. A pertussis (Tdap) shot is recommended for all who are not up to date, especially those who work, live, or have recently visited Mattawa or Quincy.\n\nBetween 3 and 7 Jul 2014, 210 patients received antibiotics. Also, a pertussis (Tdap) shot will be offered to all the workers.

Among 3 other counties in the capital region, only Yolo County is seeing a similarly dramatic increase, though the number of cases confirmed there is far lower.\n\nStatewide, the California Department of Public Health has counted 2649 pertussis -- or whooping cough -- cases from the start of 2014 through Tue 27 May 2014. In April alone, more than 800 people from Eureka to Escondido contracted the disease, said Dr Ron Chapman, the state's health officer. Infants are especially vulnerable to whooping cough, Chapman said, noting that before year's end, 'the number of pertussis cases is likely to continue to increase.'\n\nEveryone, particularly those who are around babies -- such as parents, care providers, and healthcare workers -- should get the pertussis immunization. It's especially important for women who are pregnant to receive a pertussis vaccine booster during their 3rd trimester so the shot's immune properties are transferred to their babies. Newborns are not old enough to receive whooping cough immunizations until 2 months of age, after which boosters are given at 4 months and 6 months.\n\nHealth officials in Sacramento County confirmed 137 cases so far, compared with 70 cases total in all of last year [2013]. In 2010, the worst year in recent memory, the county saw 175 cases. In Yolo County, 14 cases have been counted in 2014, up from 4 in 2013. El Dorado County has reported only 2 cases so far this year, compared with last year's total of 4. And Placer County has confirmed 37 cases, less than half of the 85 cases reported in 2013.\n\nSo far in 2014, 2 infants have died of pertussis in California, 1 in Placer County and the other in Riverside County. One of the babies contracted the disease last year.\n\n[Byline: Cynthia H Craft]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[It certainly appears that the current DTaP (diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis vaccine) vaccination protocol (1) results in waning pertussis immunity, which creates a reservoir for _Bordetella pertussis_ that can infect infants less than one year of age, and particularly less than 6 months old, that are particularly at risk for morbidity and mortality. Vaccination of the pregnant woman should assist in protecting the susceptible cohort.\n\nA recent paper in Pediatrics (2) included 224 378 children from Minnesota and 179 011 children from Oregon. Both Minnesota and Oregon had very high numbers of pertussis cases in 2010 and 2012. The researchers reviewed 458 of the children in the Minnesota group and 89 of the children in the Oregon group for the full time period studied. Over that time, the number of pertussis cases that occurred rose each year.\n\nDuring the 1st year of follow-up of the study, a rate of 15.6 out of 100 000 children contracted pertussis in Minnesota. By the 6th year of the study, that rate had risen to 138.4 out of 100 000 children. In Oregon, the rate of pertussis in the 1st year was 6.2 out of 100 000 children, which rose to 24.4 out of 100 000 children by the 6th year of the study.\n\nIn Minnesota, a child was twice as likely in the 2nd year of the study as in the 1st year to contract pertussis. By the 6th year, a child was 9 times more likely to catch whooping cough than they were in the 1st year of the study. In Oregon, a child was 30 percent more likely to catch pertussis in the 2nd year of the study than in the 1st year. By the 6th year, children were 4 times more likely to catch pertussis than they were in the 1st year.\n\nAn additional recent publication, in Clinical Infectious Disease (3), utilized a large cohort of young people receiving all of the health care at the Kaiser Permanente Medical Center in San Rafael, California, USA, and reported that a markedly increased risk of pertussis occurs associated with those who received only acellular pertussis vaccine. As compared to those who received at least one dose of the killed, whole cell pertussis vaccine (prior to the switch to all acellular dosing), the relative risk of acquiring pertussis was 8.57 in those receiving 5 doses of the acellular vaccine, but fell to a relative risk of 3.55 in those receiving 6 doses of the acellular vaccine.\n\nReferences\n----------\n1.

There were 10 new cases reported this week [week of 21 Apr 2014] in which others may have been exposed, bringing the total number of cases to 266 reported so far in 2014. There were 51 cases reported by this date in 2013 and a total of 430 that year [2014]. A high of 1179 cases was reported in 2010.\n\n'We are seeing a level of pertussis activity that should cause concern for parents and caregivers,' said Wilma Wooten, MD, MPH, County public health officer. 'We want everyone to receive the recommended vaccines so that they are protecting themselves as well as everyone around them.'\n\nA typical case of pertussis starts with a cough and runny nose for one to 2 weeks, followed by weeks to months of rapid coughing fits that sometimes end with a whooping sound (http://www.whoopingcough.net/sound%20of%20whooping%20cough%20with%20much%20whooping.htm). Fever, if present, is usually mild. Antibiotics can lessen the severity of symptoms and prevent the spread of disease to others.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends the following vaccination schedule:\n- young children need 5 doses of DTaP [diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis vaccine] by kindergarten: at 2 months, 4 months, 6 months, 15 to 18 months, and 4 to 6 years.\n- all students entering 7th grade need proof of a whooping cough booster immunization (Tdap).\n- a Tdap booster is recommended for pregnant women during their third trimester of each pregnancy, even if they got a booster before becoming pregnant.\n- one dose of Tdap is recommended for adults 19 years of age and older who did not get Tdap as an adolescent.\n\n[In San Diego County] parents can obtain the DTaP vaccine series and the Tdap booster shot for themselves and their children through their primary care physicians. Local retail pharmacies offer vaccinations for a fee, and anyone who is not covered by a medical insurance plan can get the shot from a County Public Health Center at minimal or no cost (http://www.sdcounty.ca.gov/hhsa/programs/phs/immunization_branch/immunizations_free_for_children_under_age_two.html).\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Pertussis has been on the increase throughout most of the world.

'If you have enough people immunized, you can stop it from spreading,' Kasirye said. 'It's spread through the air, through droplets -- usually, you have to be in pretty close contact with the person.'\n\nSchools and daycares are susceptible. What may appear to be a slight cough at first can get much worse. 'If it's a child, sometimes they go blue in the face,' Kasirye said. 'They might even start throwing up and they might have the characteristic whoop at the end of an episode (of) coughing.'

Napa County Public Health Officer Dr Karen Smith said 17 cases have been reported so far in 2013, 9 of them in the last 2 weeks. There were 13 pertussis cases in Napa County in all of 2013. All but 3 of this year's [2014], 17 reported cases have been in children of middle or high school age, Smith said.\n\nSmith urged women in their 3rd trimester of pregnancy to get vaccinated for pertussis to provide protection of the infant through transfer of antibodies from the mother before birth and by preventing the mother from passing a pertussis infection to the young infant after birth. Family members and childcare providers who have contact with the infant also should be vaccinated, health officials said.\n\nPertussis is cyclical and peaks every 3 to 5 years, health officials said. The last epidemic in California was in 2010 when there were 9100 cases statewide and 10 infant deaths.\n\nAll of Napa County's neighboring counties also are experiencing a high rate of pertussis, public health officials said.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[3] California (Contra Costa County)\nDate: Fri 9 May 20143\nSource: KTVU [edited]\nhttp://www.ktvu.com/news/news/local/contra-costa-county-sees-spike-whooping-cough-case/nfscD/\n\n\nContra Costa County has seen a jump in the amount of whooping cough cases in 2014, with 9 cases of the disease found in a single school.

This compared with parallel numbers of 28 per cent, 8.6 per cent, 0.7 per cent, 0.1 per cent, and less than 0.1 per cent in infants 6-11 months of age (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5104a1.htm).\n\nNeonatal pertussis is observed to be especially severe with as much as a 3 percent risk of death. Symptoms can be substantially different with periods of apnea [breathing arrest] sometimes with hypoxia-induced [low oxygen] seizures usually the most common manifestation of infection. The cough is present, but so weak that it may be unrecognized. In these children with so-called malignant pertussis, leukocytosis, particularly with white blood cell (WBC) counts of 30 000 to 100 000 and severe pulmonary hypertension are ominous signs for mortality. In a study comparing neonatal pertussis to other neonatal respiratory infections, pertussis-positive neonates had longer hospital stays, less fever, more apnea and cyanosis spells, and required more days of supplemental oxygen in the hospital and represented all the infants discharged on respiratory supportive care. - Mod.LL]", "summary": "[Byline: Gamaliel Ortiz]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The state of California can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/204.

Most of the confirmed cases have involved teenagers. The health department is contacting people who have been exposed to the disease in an effort to keep it from spreading.\n\nPertussis is a serious respiratory illness that can spread through close and prolonged person-to-person contact. People with pertussis can have symptoms ranging from runny nose and intermittent cough to severe uncontrollable coughing that can last for months. Pertussis is common in the United States, and there are frequent outbreaks, but it can cause serious illness and can even be life threatening, especially in infants.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend using antibiotics to treat those in close, prolonged contact with someone who is sick with pertussis. Antibiotics work best when given early in the course of the disease.\n\n'Another way to help protect our community is to get vaccinated,' said Karen Dobson Wandel, public health nurse supervisor at the health department. '5th and 6th graders who haven't had their pertussis booster yet should get it now. Adults, especially those who live and work with infants, should be sure they're up to date. Protection from the regular series of childhood shots wanes over time.'\n\nWomen also should be vaccinated during each pregnancy. The best time is during the 27th through 36th week, according to the CDC. Some of the protective antibodies in the vaccine will be passed to the infant, giving it short-term protection against pertussis until it's old enough to be vaccinated itself. [This statement is not exactly correct. The vaccine does not contain antibodies. Please see the moderator's comments below.]\n\nThe health department offers tetanus boosters that contain pertussis during regular walk-in immunization clinics Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays from 11 am to 4:30 pm at 1930 Ninth Ave. However, there will be no immunization clinic on Wed 23 Apr 2014 due to staff training.\n\nFor more information, contact your health-care provider or the Lewis and Clark City-County Health Department, 443-2584, or visit the CDC website at http://www.cdc.gov/pertussis.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map of Montana can be seen at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/18313.

Health officials say 42 cases have been reported since January [2014]. Although officials did not immediately have a breakdown for the cases reported in the same period last year, they said 15 cases were reported for all of 2013. 4 cases were reported in 2012.\n\nThis year [2014], most of the infected have been school-age children, officials said, adding that no deaths have been reported.

Typical symptoms in young infants may be more variable and severe, including intense coughing accompanied by a whooping sound and vomiting after coughing. Officials say complications, such as pneumonia and seizures, and in rare cases, death, can occur.\n\nAlthough most children receive 5 doses of pertussis vaccine before entering kindergarten, immunization wears off over time and booster shots are needed throughout life.

For a discussion of these problems, see moderator LL's comments in prior ProMED-mail posts on pertussis.\n\nThe incidence rate of pertussis among infants exceeds that of all other age groups, and the majority of deaths continue to occur among infants younger than 3 months of age. Because much of the morbidity and mortality from pertussis are in infants less than one year of age, especially less than 6 months, who are not as yet protected by active immunization, the CDC recommends 'cocooning,' a vaccination strategy that aims to protect infants from becoming infected with pertussis before the baby's whooping cough vaccinations start at 2 months of age, by vaccinating individuals, such as the mother and other caregivers, who would come into regular contact with the newborn infant.\n\nIn response to her pertussis vaccination, a pregnant woman will produce protective antibodies, which are passed transplacentally to her baby before birth. These antibodies provide the baby short-term protection against whooping cough in early life. Protective antibodies are at their highest about 2 weeks after getting the vaccine. So vaccination should be scheduled late in pregnancy, preferably during the 27th through 36th week, to give the baby the most protection when born and vaccination should be repeated with each pregnancy so high levels of protective antibodies are transferred to each of the babies.\n\nPregnant women should receive Tdap [combined tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis vaccines, with a reduced dose of the diphtheria and pertussis vaccines], the type of pertussis vaccine for those 11 years and older, including pregnant women.

The majority of the cases are school-age children. Among the vaccine-preventable diseases, pertussis is the most common, according to health department.\n\nPertussis is a highly contagious disease that is spread by the coughing of an infected person. Unimmunized or incompletely immunized young infants are particularly vulnerable and at increased risk for severe complications. In these cases, parents, older siblings and others in the household are often the source of their infection. A typical case of pertussis in a child or adult starts with a cough and runny nose lasting up to 2 weeks, followed by weeks to months of rapid coughing fits. Infants, not yet fully vaccinated are at highest risk of complications.\n\nTo ensure all family members are protected from pertussis, everyone in the home should be vaccinated. Young children need 5 doses by kindergarten (ages 4 to 6). All students entering, advancing or transferring into 7th grade need proof of an adolescent whooping cough booster immunization (called 'Tdap'). Pregnant women are recommended to receive a Tdap booster during their 3rd trimester of each pregnancy, even if they got it before pregnancy. Adults should receive Tdap in place of their routine 10-year tetanus (Td) booster, especially if they are in contact with infants or are healthcare workers.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n******\n[3] Montana (Lewis and Clark County)\nDate: Fri 2 May 2014\nSource: KXLH [edited]\nhttp://www.kxlh.com/news/nurses-warn-about-whooping-cough-outbreak-among-helena-students/\n\n\nLast week the Lewis and Clark County City-County Health Department was alerting the public to a rash of pertussis, or whooping cough, cases reported in the area.

It's not unusual to have a spike every 5 to 7 years, a little bit of whooping cough cycle, but what we do worry about is that the infants may be adversely affected because people aren't thinking whooping cough. This brings the total number of cases reported so far in 2014 to 154, a large increase compared to the only 33 reported cases during the same time in 2013. On Fri 28 Mar 2014, the San Diego County Health and Human Services Agency reported 10 new cases of pertussis, where others in the county may have been exposed to the disease.", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "pertussis"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2010-03-25 00:00:00", "2014-03-25 00:00:00", "1179-03-25 00:00:00", "2012-03-25 00:00:00", "2021-02-04 00:00:00", "2013-03-25 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "San Diego County", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Bellaire", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Canyon County", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Antrim County", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "MD", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Mancelona", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Ada County", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Tdap", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "2315829", "headline": "PRO/EDR> Pertussis - USA (02)", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=2315829", "date": "2014-03-06 15:20:51", "main_text": "PERTUSSIS - USA (02)\n********************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nIn this update:\n[1] Utah (Weber County)\n[2] Colorado (Weld County)\n[3] New York (Suffolk County)\n\n******\n[1] Utah (Weber County)\nDate: Fri 28 Feb 2014\nSource: KSTU, Fox 13 [edited]\nhttp://fox13now.com/2014/02/28/1-infant-hospitalized-as-officials-declare-pertussis-outbreak-at-schools-in-weber-co/\n\n\nHealth department officials in northern Utah are working with parents and teachers in several Weber County schools in order to contain an outbreak of pertussis, which is commonly known as whooping cough. According to a press release from the Weber-Morgan Health Department, an infant has been hospitalized due to pertussis and 5 more individuals are experiencing symptoms. The investigation involves family members and students at Wahlquist Junior High School, Plain City Elementary School, and Evergreen Montessori Academy.\n\nThe release states that an outbreak is defined as a period in which 2 or more cases present themselves in one school within 20 days. Amy Carter, who is a communicable disease nurse with the Weber-Morgan Health Department, said people should take precautionary measures. 'Pertussis is something we see all year long, not just during cold and flu season,' she stated in the press release. 'This reminds us that we all need to be diligent about getting vaccinated, frequent hand washing, covering your cough and staying home when you are ill.'\n\nCarter said they are concerned about those who are too young to be immunized. 'While the vaccines are very effective, we know there are some people who will not build full immunity,' Carter stated in the release. 'Our main goal is to protect infants who cannot be immunized and are most at-risk from severe complications and even death.'\n\nCarter said 'most' of the cases are recovering, and she said people 'should contact their medical provider if they are experiencing sneezing, a runny nose and other cold like symptoms especially if they have been exposed to someone who has had a lingering cough. Pertussis symptoms can last as long as 3 months if left untreated.' Those experiencing symptoms should remain home from school, work and other activities until they complete a 5-day course of antibiotics.\n\n[Byline: Mark Green]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The state of Utah can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at http://healthmap.org/r/2aBt.

'So far in 2014, we have 30 new cases of pertussis,' said Dr Mark Wallace, executive director of the Weld County Department of Public Health & Environment. In 2013, Weld had just more than 100 cases and typically averages only 4 cases per year.\n\nWallace stresses the following points:\n- 'Get vaccinated.' It is important to follow the recommended series of boosters for both adults and children, because the pertussis vaccine does not provide lifelong protection.\n- Pertussis can be treated. 'Get tested by a health care provider if a cough lasts longer than 2 weeks in order to receive the appropriate treatment.'\n- 'Always cover your cough and wash your hands.' The health department also recommends 'cocooning' vaccination efforts beyond just parents and siblings -- that is to encourage grandparents and caregivers to get vaccinated, in order to protect the infants and children they are caring for from pertussis.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The state of Colorado can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at http://healthmap.org/r/awAC.

'Please be advised that we continue to have new cases of pertussis in the Riverhead Central School District,' the notice said. 'The cases are not limited to 1 school.'

On 13 Nov 2013, the district reported on case of pertussis in the high school.\n\nThere have been 2048 cases reported in the USA so far in 2014 -- 75 in NY, according to the CDC. There were 131 cases reported in NY in 2013.\n\n[Byline: Denise Civiletti]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The state of New York can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at http://healthmap.org/r/9huu. Suffolk County can be seen on the map at http://www.digital-topo-maps.com/county-map/new-york.shtml. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ\n\nSometimes referred to as the 'pertussis paradox', the rise in reported cases of pertussis in the USA and other parts of the developed world after switching to a more tolerable, less reactogenic vaccine that could be given to adults as well as children, is probably multifactorial in origin, but is not just a case of 'post hoc ergo propter hoc', if it occurred after, it must be due to. An example of false 'post hoc logic' is if one eats a cheeseburger and an hour later gets fever and diarrhea with a stool culture growing a salmonella then the cheeseburger was the vehicle. This is not true since the incubation period of salmonellosis is far greater than an hour. Perhaps the well recognized up and down swings of pertussis outbreaks and/or the increased sensitivity of physicians to the diagnosis with better availability of specific diagnostic testing are involved here.\n\nThe current acellular (aP) pertussis vaccine, however, has had a role to play in the reemergence of pertussis' pertinence. The following summaries 2 issues in this regard (from: Lutwick LI, Preis J: Pertussis: In: Emerging Infectious Diseases: Clinical Case Studies. Ergonul O, Can F, Akova M, Madoff L (eds), 2014, Elsevier, (in press)):\n\n'Clearly, the current formulation of the acellular pertussis vaccine is less potent than its whole cell ancestor. Whether measuring specific antibodies to proteins in the vaccine during the primary sequence (34) or assessing pertussis incidence after the sequence ends at age 5 (35), immunity to pertussis promptly waned. Indeed, pertussis incidence and risk ratios rose in the 3 study states (36) at high as 8.8 times and 3.9 times in Minnesota between year 1 and year 6 after completion of the sequence. Currently 3 antigen and 5 antigen component acellular pertussis vaccines are available in the USA. The 5 component vaccine had greater efficacy in a head-to-head comparison (36). Interestingly, the relative risk of pertussis was 8.57 times higher in those with a 5-dose aP schedule as compared to those who had received at least 1 dose of whole cell vaccine (37) while those with 6 doses of aP had a relative risk of 3.55 as compared to the 1 or more whole cell group. Whether changing the balance of antigens in the vaccine or adding different antigens is unclear. In a response to the waning immunity observed following the primary immunization sequence of the acellular pertussis vaccine, further immunizations were recommended first for adolescents and then for adults 19-64 years old and then to adults 65 years and older. Finally, in order to best 'cocoon' the as yet unborn baby, recommendations now exist for aP vaccination of the pregnant woman in the 2nd or 3rd trimester (38).\n\nEvolutional changes have been observed in _B. pertussis_ that may have had a role in the organism's ability to persist in a highly immunized population. Despite the genetically monomorphic nature of the pathogen without horizontal acquisition of new genes, Mooi and colleagues have observed strains carrying a mutation in the gene for the pertussis toxin gene promoter which mediates increased production that was associated with pertussis resurgence (39) and other genetic differences between surface proteins including pertussis toxin, pertactin, and fimbriae (40). Additionally, Lan's Australian group (41,42) have divided _B. pertussis_ isolates into six clusters based on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The reemergence of pertussis seemed to coincide with the emergence of SNP cluster 1 of strains carrying pertactin and pertussis toxin genes (prn2 and ptxP3) able to evade acellular pertussis vaccine-induced selective pressure.\n\nReferences\n----------\n35.

So far, 334 local cases of pertussis have been reported, including 12 new cases in local school districts. Compare that to 165 cases reported in San Diego County in 2012. According to the HHSA, the dozen new cases of whooping cough involved patients between the ages of 6 and 16. All but the one case involved patients with up-to-date immunizations.\n\nGiven the up-tick in pertussis cases, county public health officer Wilma Wooten, MD, MPH says it's important for locals to be up-to-date on their vaccines and booster shots. 'It's likely that activity levels will remain elevated in the region,' Wooten said.\n\nIn order to combat whooping cough, the CDC says children should get doses of the DtaP vaccine at the ages of 2 months, 4 months, 6 months, 15 to 18 months, and 4 to 6 years. The CDC also recommends that preteens and adults get a Tdap booster shot.

Doctors admit cases have been growing because the bacterium has spread to unvaccinated adults. It's that time of year when coughs and sniffles return, but it's what the cough sounds like that doctors say is a cause for concern. Whooping cough isn't just for kids anymore.\n\n'Our older pertussis vaccines gave children a lot of side effects, local side effects, so they came out with a purified version. It's much safer, but the effect seems to wear off,' said Dr. Steven Bowers of Memorial Health System. That means many adults are susceptible to whooping cough, even if you had a vaccine years ago. For those who keep up to date on vaccinations, you may be covered.\n\nIn 2012, Illinois reported more than 2000 whooping cough cases.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[3] Idaho (Bannock County)\nDate: Fri 20 Dec 2013\nSource: Idaho State Journal [edited]\nhttp://www.idahostatejournal.com/news/state/idaho-schools-close-after-whooping-cough-reports/article_3ae5fbf4-14b6-5ab8-814e-2bbef347fc04.html\n\n\nSchools in eastern Idaho's Marsh Valley district have closed for the winter break 2 days early after several students were diagnosed with whooping cough.\n\nDistrict Superintendent Marvin Hansen told The Idaho State Journal (http://bit.ly/SxHTxs) that the health department notified the school this week that there were as many as 7 confirmed cases of pertussis, commonly called whooping cough, in the district.

Pertussis rates in the United States have been rising and reached a 50-year high of 42 000 cases in 2012. Although pertussis resurgence is not completely understood, we hypothesize that current acellular pertussis (aP) vaccines fail to prevent colonization and transmission. To test our hypothesis, infant baboons were vaccinated at 2, 4, and 6 months of age with aP or whole-cell pertussis (wP) vaccines and challenged with _B.. pertussis_ at 7 months. Infection was followed by quantifying colonization in nasopharyngeal washes and monitoring leukocytosis and symptoms. Baboons vaccinated with aP were protected from severe pertussis-associated symptoms but not from colonization, did not clear the infection faster than naive animals, and readily transmitted _B. pertussis_ to unvaccinated contacts. Vaccination with wP induced a more rapid clearance compared with naive and aP-vaccinated animals. By comparison, previously infected animals were not colonized upon secondary infection. Although all vaccinated and previously infected animals had robust serum antibody responses, we found key differences in T-cell immunity. Previously infected animals and wP-vaccinated animals possess strong _B. pertussis_- specific T helper 17 (Th17) memory and Th1 memory, whereas aP vaccination induced a Th1/Th2 response instead. The observation that aP, which induces an immune response mismatched to that induced by natural infection, fails to prevent colonization or transmission provides a plausible explanation for the resurgence of pertussis and suggests that optimal control of pertussis will require the development of improved vaccines.'\n\nMore evidence continues to accumulate regarding issues revolving around the protective efficacy of the current acellular pertussis vaccines and the need for an improvement in the current product. - Mod.LL\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/r/1hiS.]", "summary": "\n\nTo test this hypothesis, the investigators vaccinated infant baboons at 2, 4, and 6 months of age with acellular pertussis or whole-cell pertussis vaccines and challenged them with _B. pertussis_ at 7 months.

Dallas County counted the most cases of whooping cough, also called pertussis, in more than 2 decades with 404. Texas had to go back to the 1950s to find more cases than the 3908 confirmed last year [2013]. Its previous record was 5842 in 1959. But Tarrant County topped even that terrible distinction. Its 697 cases in 2013 beat the whooping cough record set there in 1940.\n\n'It was an awful year,' said Russell Jones, Tarrant County's chief epidemiologist. 'We had the most pertussis cases of every county in Texas.'\nOther counties reported high numbers including Denton County with 312 and Collin with 203.\n\nJones blamed the spike on the cyclical nature of pertussis. The respiratory disease reappears annually with a noticeable increase in cases every 3 to 5 years. 5 years ago, Tarrant recorded 312 pertussis cases, Jones said.

According to the Riverside County Department of Public Health, the 2-month-old had not been vaccinated for whooping cough, also known as pertussis, nor had the infant's mother received a booster shot while she was pregnant. The child was not identified, though county health department Communicable Diseases Specialist Barbara Cole confirmed the infant was from the southwest county area.\n\n'This serves as a sad reminder that illnesses like whooping cough are still very much with us, and immunizations are the 1st line of defense,' said Dr Cameron Kaiser, public health officer for Riverside County.\n\n'We strongly encourage pregnant women to get vaccinated, all parents to vaccinate their children on time, and for adults to keep current with their booster shots to reduce the spread of the disease.'\n\nCalifornia Department of Public Health Director Dr Ron Chapman said pregnant mothers can get a pertussis booster by their 3rd trimester. 'Preventing deaths in infants by ensuring that all pregnant women get vaccinated is our primary goal in pertussis control,' Chapman said. When pregnant women are vaccinated, the immunity they develop against pertussis is passed to their infants and helps protect infants until they are old enough to be vaccinated themselves. Young infants are at the greatest risk of severe or fatal pertussis.'\n\nHealth officials noted that whooping cough cases had moderated since peaking in 2010, when 9100 cases and 10 deaths were reported in California. However, the number of infections began to surge again last summer, and 83 percent of those with symptoms were youths under 18 --12 percent of whom were infants less than 6 months old, according to the state.\n\nOfficials said children need 5 doses of pertussis vaccine before they reach kindergarten, while adults should be inoculated if they're in regular contact with toddlers or are healthcare workers.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[5] Delaware (Kent County)\nDate: Fri 7 Feb 2014\nSource: Delaware Online [edited]\nhttp://www.delawareonline.com/article/20140208/HEALTH/302080029/Whooping-cough-hits-Kent-County-Amish-community\n\n\nA total of 48 people living in an Amish community in western Kent County have been infected with whooping cough, a highly contagious bacterial illness that causes violent coughing and can be fatal in infants. 80 percent of the cases are in children age 10 and younger, said Dr Karyl Rattay, director of the Delaware Division of Public Health. 25 of the cases have occurred in infants through age 6, while 15 are ages 7 to 10. The rest are older youth or adults. So far, no cases have been identified outside the Amish community. Students from at least 3 schools have fallen ill. There have been no deaths or hospitalizations, and none of those sickened is seriously ill.

The community has been supportive and helpful, with one of the elders opening their home as a meeting place for community education, antibiotics and vaccinations. 'Because of that, we believe we're going to be able to keep this well contained. They've been helping us with the investigation and ensuring that communications are reaching individuals, so we can get treatment and vaccines to individuals in the community,' Rattay said.\n\nIn 2004-2005, there was a bigger outbreak of pertussis in the Kent County Amish community, resulting in 345 identified cases, mostly among school-age children.\n\n[Byline: Jeff Montgomery, Kelly Bothum]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The state of Delaware can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at http://healthmap.org/r/1kc*.

The number of whooping cough cases in Utah jumped 142 percent between 2011 and 2012, health officials say. Concerns, especially for infants younger than one-year old who cannot be vaccinated, were the driving force. The state went from 618 reported cases in 2011 to 1497 in 2012.\n\n'By adults getting vaccinated, they are protecting themselves 1st,' said Davis County Health Department epidemiologist Brian Hatch. 'The other goal, perhaps more important, is to protect those who can't be vaccinated. During the 1st year of life, infants can't be [fully] vaccinated.'\n\nDavis County saw a 456 percent rise in whooping cough, or 139 cases over the year's time, 7 of them resulting in hospitalization, Hatch said.\n\nUtah is experiencing a dramatic increase in the number of pertussis cases. Utah's incidence rate is over 4 times the national average. More than half of infant pertussis cases must be hospitalized, according to a state Health Department press release. 83 percent of those infants were infected by a parent or other close family member. 90 percent of all pertussis deaths occur in infants.\n\nThe campaign is a collaboration by the Utah State Health Department and 9 of the 12 local health departments, including Davis. 'We're actively putting resources into the campaign,' Hatch said. 'We're actively doing everything we can to help control pertussis.'\n\nWhooping cough usually results in minor C but prolonged C illness in healthy adults, but it can be fatal in infants who are too young to be immunized against it.\n\n'So it's important that the adults and older children around an infant be adequately immunized by receiving a quick, easy, and relatively painless Tdap vaccine, according to the Health Department press release.\n\nThe campaign's website, StopWhoopingCough.org, helps visitors find a vaccination location near them. Those who get their Tdap vaccine from a participating health department clinic or at a Harmon's grocery store pharmacy will receive a free infant 'onsie' while supplies last.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n*****\n[2] Minnesota, Oregon\nDate: Mon 11 Mar 2013\nSource: Daily Rx [edited]\nhttp://www.dailyrx.com/pertussis-vaccine-effectiveness-appears-wear-rates-increased-over-time\n\n\nVaccines save lives by preventing a person from getting a disease or dramatically lowering their risks for the disease. But vaccines are not perfect. Their protection can wear off. A recent study found more evidence that the vaccine for whooping cough is wearing off sooner than researchers expected.\n\nThe researchers in this study found that the risk of catching pertussis among fully vaccinated children in 2 states increased considerably over a 6 year period. The study, led by Sara Y. Tartof, PhD, MPH, of the CDC, aimed to understand how the risk of catching pertussis changed as time passed after children were vaccinated against it. The disease can be fatal to babies, especially those under 2 months old who have not received their 1st vaccine for it.\n\nThe researchers tracked children in Minnesota and Oregon who were born between 1998 and 2003 and had received all 5 shots for the DTaP. These shots start with an initial one at 2 months old, with 4 booster shots following throughout early childhood.\n\nThe study included 224 378 children from Minnesota and 179 011 children from Oregon. Both Minnesota and Oregon had very high numbers of pertussis cases in 2010 and 2012. The researchers reviewed 458 of the children in the Minnesota group and 89 of the children in the Oregon group for the full time period studied. Over that time, the number of pertussis cases that occurred rose each year.\n\nDuring the 1st year of follow-up of the study, a rate of 15.6 out of 100 000 children contracted pertussis in Minnesota. By the 6th year of the study, that rate had risen to 138.4 out of 100 000 children.\n\nIn Oregon, the rate of pertussis in the 1st year was 6.2 out of 100 000 children, which rose to 24.4 out of 100 000 children by the 6th year of the study.\n\nIn Minnesota, a child was twice as likely in the 2nd year of the study as in the 1st year to contract pertussis. By the 6th year, a child was 9 times more likely to catch whooping cough than they were in the 1st year of the study.\n\nIn Oregon, a child was 30 percent more likely to catch pertussis in the 2nd year of the study than in the 1st year. By the 6th year, children were 4 times more likely to catch pertussis than they were in the 1st year.\n\n'This rise is likely attributable in part to waning immunity from DTaP vaccines,' the researchers wrote. Past studies in the last year have shown that the vaccine's effectiveness decreases over time more quickly than was expected.\n\nThis discovery of the decreasing effectiveness of the vaccine over time led the CDC's immunization policy group to recommend that pregnant women be vaccinated with the Tdap (the adult version of the DTaP) each time they are pregnant, even if they had the shot within the past 5 years.\n\nThe CDC group, called the Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices, hopes the extra shot during pregnancy will offer a bit of extra protection to the baby during its 1st year of life. The vaccine is still effective in the couple of years after it is given, and babies who receive the vaccine on time will be protected by it from whooping cough. Babies are at the highest risk from dying from the disease.\n\nThe study was published 11 Mar 2013 in the journal Pediatrics.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The number of cases of pertussis over time tends to have upswing cycles every 3-5 years but the case increases have been greater and more prolonged in the past several years.

A Corpus Christi baby of 6 months succumbed to the illness after a lengthy battle, having been hospitalized since 28 Aug 2013. Looking back on their records, the Health District states that the baby's death was the 1st in Corpus Christi for 2013, and may have been the 1st area death in over a decade from pertussis, otherwise known as whooping cough.\n\nA report from the Corpus Christi-Nueces County Public Health District states that the level of pertussis cases in Nueces County has been on a recent rise, with 16 cases reported in the area in 2013; 11 of those cases requiring hospitalization. With all of that being said, the fact remains, pertussis is preventable. 'Pertussis is preventable through vaccine and it is of vital importance that anyone who is around a pregnant female receives their pertussis vaccine,' said Annette Rodriguez, MPH, Director of Public Health.\n\nDr Jaime Fergie, Pediatric Infectious Diseases, Driscoll Children's Hospital, further stressed this point, stating that the most important thing to prevent pertussis is for pregnant females to receive the vaccination in their 3rd trimester, and for all other relatives who will come into close proximity with the newborn to receive the vaccination [at least] 2 weeks before the baby is due.\n\nAccording to the Corpus Christi-Nueces County Public Health District, pertussis is an extremely serious respiratory infection, with the pertussis bacteria attacking the lungs and breathing tubes. It causes uncontrollable coughing.\n\nDr Fergie states that the whooping cough infects adults, and can cause many problems, but when a child under 2 (such as an infant who has not built up a tolerance or acquired the antibodies to fight against the infection) contracts the illness, it can be extremely harmful, or even deadly.\n\nThe death reported on Wed 18 Dec 2013 may be the 1st in 2013, but once again, there is a rising trend in cases.

The Wood County Health Department is still seeing infections. Public health nurse Diane Rodd says they've had 31 cases of pertussis so far in 2013. 'Approximately 24 out of those 31 have occurred since 1 Nov 2013. So we are seeing an increase.'\n\nRodd says many of the people being infected are students who are nearly out of date with their shots. 'Because of that, the protection they got in kindergarten is starting to wane, and so they're a little more susceptible.' The early symptoms are much like catching a cold, but the mild cough progressively worsens to severe coughing spells. These coughing spells can include whooping and vomiting. Health officials say the illness can last nearly 6 weeks, and is contagious if left untreated. A course of antibiotics is available to help lessen the length of the disease, and Rodd says they need to do their job. 'We want to make sure people go through the entire cycle of antibiotics before going out into the public.'\n\n[Byline: Raymond Neupert]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The state of Wisconsin can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at http://healthmap.org/r/9BMx.

Health officials are urging individuals that have a cough, or have a family member that has a cough, that has lasted more than 14 days to see their healthcare provider, and to make sure family member vaccinations are up to date.\n\n'Pertussis has been circulating at epidemic levels in Colorado for the past couple of years so it's not surprising we're seeing increased cases in our area,' said Dr Tony Cappello, NCHD's public health director, in the release. 'While this infection can just be a nagging cough for some people, it can be very severe and even deadly for infants and others with compromised immune systems. This is not an illness you want to pass on to an infant that doesn't have the immunity to fight it off; whether it be your own grandchild, a neighbor's new baby, or your own newborn.\n\n'It can also be very hard to get rid of once it gets in a community,' continued Dr Cappello. 'Over the course of our case investigations in Phillips County we've had to touch base with several other school districts alerting them to probable exposures at school events. The best thing that people can do if they think they have pertussis is to visit their healthcare provider, stay home if they're ill, cover their cough, stay away from infants, wash their hands, and make sure they're up to date on vaccinations.'\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The state of Colorado can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at http://healthmap.org/r/9BMz.

Over the last few years, this once-common childhood illness, also known as whooping cough, has evolved in response to its own vaccine, according to a new study from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThe mutated pertussis is not more dangerous than the original, and vaccines against the illness are still effective. So the findings don't change researchers' and doctors' understanding of whooping cough as a public health problem. Instead, they're a glimpse into a fascinating natural phenomenon, and one that's happening as we speak. (Though this isn't the 1st time this has happened. Populations of pneumococcal illnesses changed after the introduction of its vaccine, prompting changes to the vaccine to deal with newly popular strains.) The whooping cough findings have kicked off research to determine whether this is related to the recent increase in whooping cough cases in the US.\n\nPaul Offit, chief of the division of infectious diseases at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, was not involved in the CDC study, but took part in a conference call about the study in which CDC researchers presented their results. He talked with Popular Science over the phone immediately after the call.\n\n'We discussed the data and what the data allow us to say and what they don't allow us to say,' he says. 'The data don't support the notion that the mutants are more virulent.' Babies who fall ill from un-mutated pertussis have the same symptoms as babies who fall ill from mutated pertussis, he says.\n\nThere's also no evidence yet that pertussis vaccines are less effective against the new strains, say all of the researchers Popular Science talked with, both in and outside of the CDC. Everyone recommended Americans continue to get vaccinated right on schedule. 'Currently, we know it's the best form of protection we have,' says Lucia Pawloski, the CDC scientist who led the new research. Kids who don't get vaccinated against pertussis are still 8 times as likely as vaccinated kids to get the disease, she adds.\n\nNevertheless, it's plausible whooping cough's changes do affect the vaccine's ability to protect. 'Yes, theoretically, there could be an issue, but we don't have any data to say that yet,' Pawloski says. The CDC is interested in answering this question and hopefully will have data to do so in 6 or 8 months, Offit says.\n\nSo what exactly is different about pertussis nowadays? Since 2010, Pawloski and her colleagues have recorded a sharp rise in the US in strains of the illness that don't make a protein called pertactin. Before 2010, researchers saw only one US pertussis infection, from 1994, in which the bacteria didn't make pertactin. By 2012, the majority of pertussis infections researchers studied were caused by non-pertactin-making pertussis. Pawloski and her team examined 1300 samples taken from whooping cough outbreaks between 1935 and 2012.\n\nPertussis bacteria make thousands of proteins, but pertactin happens to be one of the few included in many forms of the vaccine used in developed countries, including the US. 'We've created this selective pressure,' Offit says, by widely using vaccines with pertactin in them.\n\nWhen the proteins and other molecules in a vaccine enter your body through a shot, your immune system finds them, learns to recognize them, and develops defenses against them. Now, if you ever truly encounter that illness, your body will respond quickly to quash it. If the vaccine contains pertactin and the actual illness doesn't, that means your body is learning to recognize something that's useless to it when it encounters whooping cough.\n\nAll pertussis vaccines used in developed countries have one, 2, or 3 other pertussis molecules besides pertactin, so there's still stuff in there for your body to train on, even if pertactin is now useless. How much of a blow -- if any at all -- losing pertactin deals to vaccines that have other active molecules is still unclear. 'I think at this point it's hard to say exactly what it means for the vaccines' effectiveness,' says Nicola Klein, co-director of the Kaiser Permanente Vaccine Study Center in California. Klein was not involved in the CDC study.\n\nMeanwhile, pertussis vaccines often used in developing countries contain entire killed _Bordetella pertussis_ bacteria, so they actually contain perhaps thousands of things the body is able to use to learn to recognize whooping cough. Those vaccines, which are cheaper to make, were discontinued in developed countries because they cause severe, if non-permanent, side effects, such as seizures in babies.\n\nCDC researchers now are looking into whether losing pertactin is related to another phenomenon associated with the increasing popularity of the newer whooping cough vaccines. Recent studies have found that even those kids who get all their recommended pertussis shots -- in the US administered as the DTaP [diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis] shot -- are vulnerable again to whooping cough at about age 8 or 10. Researchers think the new vaccine is why the US saw more cases of whooping cough in 2012 than it has in any year since 1955. The older shot, with the killed bacteria, protected people for longer. Scientists are unsure what exactly made the tougher stuff longer-lasting, however.\n\nIs pertussis' evolution the answer? That's not certain yet. 'We couldn't say yes or no at this point whether pertactin had a role in the waning of immunity,' Pawloski says.\n\n[Byline: Francie Diep]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Palowski's paper, 'Prevalence and molecular characterization of pertactin-deficient _Bordetella pertussis_ in the US.

Utah is just one of a number of USA states including Washington and Wisconsin that have had substantial increase in the disease with, in addition, infant deaths related to cases transmitted by family members. Most up-to-date ACIP (Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices) recommendations continue to increase vaccination recommendations to order to 'cocoon' the susceptible infant cohort. The most recent recommendations include re-vaccination for pregnant women in the 2nd or 3rd trimester for each pregnancy (1).\n\nIn addition to the Tartlof paper (2), an additional recent publication, currently in press in Clinical Infectious Disease (3), utilizes a large cohort of young people receiving all of the health care at the Kaiser Permanente Medical Center in San Rafael, California, USA, and clearly shows that a markedly increased risk of pertussis occurs associated with those who received only acellular pertussis vaccine. As compared to those who received at least one dose of the killed, whole cell pertussis vaccine (prior to the switch to all acellular dosing), the relative risk of acquiring pertussis was 8.57 in those receiving 5 doses of the acellular vaccine, but fell to a relative risk of 3.55 in those receiving 6 doses of the acellular vaccine.\n\nReferences\n----------\n1.

Levin said at a conference on pediatric infectious diseases sponsored by the Children's Hospital Colorado.\n\nEvidence of waning immunity to the current 5-dose diphtheria, tetanus, and acellular pertussis (DTaP) vaccine has convinced some scientists that a better pertussis vaccine is needed. 'The question you might ask is, can we do a better job than nature? After all, pertussis infection doesn't cause lasting immunity, so could we do a better job than nature? I think so. And here's an example: We know that antibody is protective against HPV [human papillomavirus], and that the HPV vaccine gives a much stronger antibody response, often by 100-fold, than does natural infection with HPV,' observed Dr. Levin, who led development of the shingles vaccine.\n\nConvincing evidence of waning immunity to the current 5-dose diphtheria, tetanus, and acellular pertussis (DTaP) vaccine series completed before age 7 years in the USA comes from research conducted at the Kaiser Permanente Vaccine Study Center in Oakland, California. The investigators analyzed the large California pertussis outbreak of 2010. Their case-control study showed that the protection provided by the DTaP vaccine was short-lived, such that each year after completing the 5th dose the likelihood of developing PCR-proven pertussis climbed by an average of 42 percent (N. Engl. J. Med. 2012;367:1012-9). Thus, they calculated that if the initial effectiveness of DTaP was 90 percent, it would drop to a mere 42 percent 5 years after the 5th and final dose. In addition, there is a strong argument that the original estimate of the vaccine's efficacy of about 85 percent was inflated due to the case definition used. The efficacy rate after 5 years becomes disturbingly low if the actual efficacy rate was roughly 7 percent, as many now believe, noted Dr. Levin, professor of pediatrics and medicine at the University of Colorado, Denver.\n\nThe whole-cell pertussis vaccines were clearly more effective than the DTaP, which began replacing them in the early 1990s. In another Kaiser Permanente study that zeroed in on the transition period between the use of whole-cell pertussis vaccine and DTaP, patients who contracted PCR-confirmed pertussis did so an average of 14.7 years after receiving their last dose in the series if they received one or more doses of whole-cell vaccine compared with a mere 5.6 years after the last dose if they got the all-DTaP series.\n\nThe national switch to DTaP was carried out because the vaccine has fewer adverse effects than does the whole-cell pertussis vaccine. Components of whole-cell vaccines, including lipopolysaccharides and internal proteins, were important in signaling the innate immune system to shape a more robust response. Unfortunately, these whole-cell vaccine components also trigger unwanted reactogenic local and systemic effects.\n\n'Whenever a vaccine is cleaned up to decrease side effects, there is a great likelihood that the efficacy will be affected. This is almost certainly the case with acellular pertussis, and probably with the split-product flu vaccines as well. I would say we need to learn why the whole-cell pertussis vaccine was so effective -- which component was most important in directing the immune response -- and see if we can separate that from the side effects. This is a research issue,' said Dr. Levin.\n\nPossible ways to create a better DTaP vaccine might involve incorporating a detoxified lipopolysaccharide or adding additional adjuvants to increase the innate immune response to the pertussis antigen.\n\nVaccine development takes time. In the interim, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices of the CDC has taken steps to deal with the nation's worsening pertussis epidemic outbreak. Because the herd protection effect is probably low, a 'cocooning' strategy has been adopted. This involves targeted immunization of pregnant women and all close contacts of their babies during the 1st year of life, when pertussis has its highest morbidity and mortality. In addition, an adolescent dose of pertussis vaccine has been introduced. And consideration is being given to the possibility of universal once-per-decade booster doses in adults, but this has thus far been rejected as not being cost-effective.\n\n[Byline: Bruce Jancin]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[It certainly appears that the current DTaP vaccination protocol (1) results in waning pertussis immunity, which creates a reservoir for _Bordetella pertussis_ that can infect infants less than one year of age, and particularly less than 6 months old, that are particularly at risk for morbidity and mortality. Vaccination of the pregnant woman should assist in protecting the susceptible cohort.\n\nA recent paper in Pediatrics (2) included 224 378 children from Minnesota and 179 011 children from Oregon. Both Minnesota and Oregon had very high numbers of pertussis cases in 2010 and 2012. The researchers reviewed 458 of the children in the Minnesota group and 89 of the children in the Oregon group for the full time period studied. Over that time, the number of pertussis cases that occurred rose each year.\n\nDuring the 1st year of follow-up of the study, a rate of 15.6 out of 100 000 children contracted pertussis in Minnesota. By the 6th year of the study, that rate had risen to 138.4 out of 100 000 children. In Oregon, the rate of pertussis in the 1st year was 6.2 out of 100 000 children, which rose to 24.4 out of 100 000 children by the 6th year of the study.\n\nIn Minnesota, a child was twice as likely in the 2nd year of the study as in the 1st year to contract pertussis. By the 6th year, a child was 9 times more likely to catch whooping cough than they were in the 1st year of the study. In Oregon, a child was 30 percent more likely to catch pertussis in the 2nd year of the study than in the 1st year. By the 6th year, children were 4 times more likely to catch pertussis than they were in the 1st year.\n\nAn additional recent publication, in Clinical Infectious Disease (3), utilized a large cohort of young people receiving all of the health care at the Kaiser Permanente Medical Center in San Rafael, California, USA, and clearly shows that a markedly increased risk of pertussis occurs associated with those who received only acellular pertussis vaccine. As compared to those who received at least one dose of the killed, whole cell pertussis vaccine (prior to the switch to all acellular dosing), the relative risk of acquiring pertussis was 8.57 in those receiving 5 doses of the acellular vaccine, but fell to a relative risk of 3.55 in those receiving 6 doses of the acellular vaccine.\n\nReferences:\n1.

The USA, meanwhile, appears headed for its worst year for whooping cough in more than 5 decades, with more than 18 000 cases reported so far.\n\nAs health authorities on both sides of the border urge parents to get their children vaccinated, and start offering free vaccine clinics for adults, the outbreaks have fueled debate about the vaccine's effectiveness over time. The latest spread of the disease can be partially explained by parents who shun vaccinating their children. But health officials say a larger issue is at play: Children under 6 years need 5 doses of the whooping cough vaccine, with a booster in their teenage years. Routine vaccination efforts, however, have stopped by the time they reach adulthood.\n\n'We've got waned immunity,' said Doug Sider, Ontario's acting associate medical officer of health.

The recent outbreak, part of the upward trend in pertussis infections in Canada and the USA in the past year, is slowing now but remains a concern for Fraser Health officials.\n\nOf the 295 probable and reported cases, 247 were confirmed as pertussis in laboratory tests since the outbreak's start in November 2011 through 7 Jul 2012, according to Fraser Health spokesman Roy Thorpe-Dorward.\n\n'The number is above the historical average,' he said on Tuesday [24 Jul 2012].

Pertussis has also been a problem in Alberta, Ontario and New Brunswick. The maritime province has seen 1024 reported cases so far in 2012, but no deaths. In Ontario, there have been 260 confirmed cases in 2012. One baby has died in Alberta, where there were 42 cases.\n\nFraser Health statistics show the spike in new cases hitting a high in February 2012 and tapering off significantly since then. In mid-June 2012, the health authority announced the outbreak was now 'decreasing but ongoing,' and noted reported cases 'have significantly tailed off over the past 6 weeks.'\n\nPertussis is most serious in infants under a year old. 'We've had a total of 8 cases in children under age one, which are the ones that are most serious and the ones we worry about the most, but we haven't had any fatalities,' Thorpe-Dorward said.\n\nVancouver Coastal Health has seen 156 confirmed cases in 2012 as of 4 Jul 2012, with 3 requiring hospitalization, but no deaths.

There's been a 10-fold increase in the number of cases so far in 2012 compared with the same period in 2010, according to the Health Protection Agency. Furthermore, this outbreak is greater than the last major outbreak, already in 2012 nearly 1800 adults and children have been affected, almost double the number in the whole of 2008 (when cases of the disease last rose sharply).\n\nWhat marks out today's whooping cough outbreak is that the current peak is lasting longer than normal. Worryingly, the outbreak is increasingly affecting young babies for whom the disease can prove deadly, 5 babies have died of it already in 2012.\n\nThe Health Protection Agency (HPA) believes the surge in cases may be partly due to an increased awareness among doctors who have been warned to look out for the disease, but says it could also be due to waning immunity because the effects of the vaccine reduce in time.\n\nIndeed, the rise in cases is occurring despite a good uptake of the vaccination in younger children, 96.3 percent of 2-year-olds have completed their vaccination course against pertussis.\n\n'Cases do increase every 3 to 4 years and this is the case the world over, it seems to be a characteristic of the disease,' says Dr Gayatri Amirthalingam, a consultant epidemiologist at the HPA. 'Our last major outbreak was in 2008 when we had 900 cases, so we were due another one.'\n\nBut what marks out today's pertussis outbreak is that the current peak is lasting longer than normal. 'Normally, the outbreaks of whooping cough are seasonal, peak in the autumn, and are over by the spring,' says Dr Amirthalingam.\n\nThe key to protect yourself is childhood vaccination. The vaccine is not really designed to protect older children or adults, but instead to prevent them from passing the illness to babies. While it can be an unpleasant illness for anyone, whooping cough in infants can be extremely serious, it is fatal for one in every 500 babies who develop it.\n\n[Byline: Lucy Elkins]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The UK, like many of the developed nations, is currently experiencing a significant jump in cases of pertussis resulting in severe illnesses and deaths in neonates.

The number of new cases on the West Coast has decreased from the peak in 2011 but is still higher than normal levels.\n\nBetween 1 May 2011 and 22 Jun 2012, there have been 497 notifications of suspected pertussis received by Community & Public Health's West Coast Office. To date, 328 people have been confirmed as having the disease. The difference between the number of notifications and the numbers of confirmed cases indicates that general practices are being vigilant when patients present with a cough of more than 2 weeks' duration. Children under the age of 10 years continue to have the highest rates of the disease.\n\nIn the winter school holidays there may be more Coasters traveling or visitors to the region so the risk of coming into contact with the disease, or it being 'imported' to the Coast is higher. People who are unwell should avoid going to sports events, concerts, or other large gatherings where there is a possibility that they may pass on their illness to others.\n\n'The best protection against pertussis is for babies and children to receive their childhood vaccinations on time,' says Dr Cheryl Brunton, West Coast medical officer of health.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[It is not clear how many of the cases have occurred in the high risk group, infants under 6 months of age. The commonest complications of pertussis infection, especially in young infants, include apnea (stopping breathing), pneumonia, and weight loss secondary to feeding difficulties and post-coughing vomiting. Seizures and death also occur. Other complications include difficulty sleeping, pneumothorax, nose bleeds, subconjunctival hemorrhage, intracranial hematoma, rectal prolapse, urinary incontinence, and rib fracture. The overall complication rate of pertussis is 5-6 per cent, but among infants younger than 6 months, the complication rate can be 3-4 times that number.\n\nRecommendations on the use of 'cocooning' acellular pertussis vaccines have been developed in an attempt to expand protection in susceptibles to prevent the substantial morbidity and mortality in infants who have not yet been adequately immunized. The now recommended use of the vaccine in pregnant women further expands these recommendations.\n\nSusceptibility of older children and adults to pertussis, usually manifesting as chronic cough without the typical 'whoop', after appropriate primary immunization continues to be increasingly reported.

He said a hospital employee went to the staff clinic last week [week of 25 Jun 2012] complaining of a nasty cough. He was sent home as a precaution, and on Mon 2 Jul 2012, his test results came back positive for whooping cough. 'He probably had it for about 2 weeks or slightly more, perhaps,' Tural said.\n\nThat means the employee had 2 weeks of direct contact with patients and fellow employees at the hospital. Officials believe at least 53 employees have been exposed to the illness, but that number could end up being more than 300 after factoring in patients and visitors.\n\nThe hospital has been proactive. 'If they had direct exposure, then we automatically require them to be put on antimicrobials,' said Providence official Teresa Wenta.\n\nThe worker in question thought he had been proactive, too. He was vaccinated against pertussis, but it wasn't effective. Tural said sometimes the vaccination just doesn't work.

That is more than twice as many cases as there were at this time in 2011 and the 1st time since 1959 that so many cases have been reported by this time in the year.\n\nPertussis, or whooping cough, is a bacterial infection involving the respiratory tract that is easily spread by coughing and sneezing. It can start out like the common cold, but can be a very serious infection, particularly for infants under the age of one, who are too young to complete the full vaccination series.\n\nWhile some doctors say that part of the surge in reported cases can be credited to better diagnostic tests and increased awareness, the casualties thus far underscore a very real problem. Nine infants have died from pertussis so far in 2012 in the USA. The 13-to-14-year-old age group has been hit particularly hard. In Washington State, the number of cases this year [2012] has surpassed 3000, already more than 3 times as many as all of 2011. Washington state Secretary of Health Mary Selecky declared a statewide pertussis epidemic on 3 Apr 2012.\n\nThe vaccine for pertussis, known as DTaP, should be given to all children as a series at ages 2, 4, and 6 months, 15-18 months, and 4-6 years, according to the CDC. An additional booster, known as TDaP, is needed at age 11-12.\n\n'Unvaccinated kids are at 8 times higher risk for getting pertussis compared to kids who have been vaccinated,' said Schuchat. 'Vaccinated kids who do develop pertussis have a milder course. They're also less infectious than unvaccinated children.'\n\nHealth officials added that all adults who have not been vaccinated against pertussis should receive the TDaP vaccine, especially pregnant women and those who will have contact with babies. Pertussis outbreaks generally occur in peaks and waves. Even with vaccination, immunity tends to wane over time.\n\nAn estimated 84 percent of toddlers in the USA have received their complete course of vaccination. However, only 8 percent of adults are currently vaccinated. 'Our biggest work is to get adults immunized,' said Dr. Mark Sawyer, chairman of the CDC's pertussis work group and professor of pediatrics at UCSD. 'This is particularly relevant to pregnant women and new grandparents, who will have contact with infants.'\n\nWhat's unusual is the fact that so many 13- and 14-year-olds are falling ill with the infection. The CDC is looking into whether this could be attributed to a change implemented in 1997 that saw the vaccine used to immunize children change from a version that was taken off the market in the USA because of possible neurologic side effects.\n\nThe CDC is launching an investigation to find out what is contributing to the unusual features of this outbreak. Researchers are also looking at why the protection offered from the current vaccine is not complete.\n\nDr. Gregory Poland of the Mayo Clinic has had personal experience with pertussis, not only as a physician, but also as a father of a child who suffered through pertussis at the age of 13 despite being fully vaccinated. 'When I 1st heard my son cough, I knew he had pertussis,' Poland said. 'Even though I treated him immediately, the cough lasted for 100 days. He literally kept the family awake for months.'\n\nDr. Len Horovitz, an infectious disease specialist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York, is frustrated that despite the prevalence of media coverage, adults are not requesting the vaccine. 'How much relentless coverage and repetition of medical information [does it take] for the public to finally grasp an epidemic?' he asked. 'People aren't listening, aren't watching, or aren't paying attention.'\n\n[Byline: Dr. Laurie Handwerker]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map of the country is available at http://healthmap.org/r/1hiS.]\n\n******\n[2] North Dakota\nDate: Mon 30 Jul 2012\nSource: Grand Forks (ND) Herald [edited]\nhttp://www.grandforksherald.com/event/article/id/241764/group/homepage/\n\n\nNorth Dakota health officials also are seeing a spike in cases of whooping cough, said Abbi Pierce, immunization surveillance coordinator in the Division of Disease Control, North Dakota Department of Health.

These numbers are substantially higher than the 5 cases registered during the same period last year [2011]. The disease mainly affects children between 6 months and 1 year of age who are not [adequately] immunized, and in some cases can be life threatening.\n\nFor this reason, the province's Ministry of Health along with Central Vaccination insist on the importance of vaccination to prevent this disease, especially for pregnant women at 20 weeks of gestation and for children starting at 2 months of age, followed by subsequent doses as indicated by the official vaccination schedule.\n\n'Mendoza is also affected by the pertussis outbreak that exists globally and nationally, which in the epidemiological curve is in the red zone,' said the province's head of epidemiology, Adriana Koch.\n\nIn view of this situation, it is essential that pregnant women be vaccinated so that their children can develop antibodies through the placenta, because this respiratory disease, caused by the bacterium _Bordetella pertussis_, can be transmitted to infants with no defenses when an adult or older sibling is infected.\n\nThe situation is explained in part, because not everyone completes the vaccination schedule properly resulting in the circulation of the bacteria. In addition, immunization wanes after 10 years and revaccination is necessary.\n\n'Whooping cough or pertussis is a respiratory disease very easily transmitted. It is important to note that because neither the natural infection nor the vaccine confer lifelong immunity, several doses of vaccine are required,' says Carla Vizzotti, head of the National Program for Control of Vaccine-Preventable Diseases (Pronacei) of the Ministry of Health.\n\nAt the same time she noted that 'while in adults and adolescents, pertussis is usually not a serious problem, these groups are the source of infection for infants under one year who have a high probability of developing severe complications and even death.'\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[In the USA, as in Argentina, recommendations on the use of acellular pertussis vaccines have continued to expand in efforts to cocoon susceptible neonates to prevent the substantial morbidity and mortality in infants who have not been yet adequately immunized, like the ones described in this report.

It is likely, given the limited number of contacts small infants have, that the source for the infant is a family member.\n\nThe increasing susceptibility of older children and adults to pertussis, usually manifesting as chronic cough without the typical 'whoop,' after appropriate primary immunization continues to be increasingly reported.

Pertussis is characterized by common cold symptoms that can evolve into severe, rapid coughing spells.\n\nThe infection is a growing concern for health officials in Oregon, who have seen a total of 458 reported cases through Friday, 6 Jul 2012, compared with just 147 by the same time in 2011. Infants younger than one account for 63 of those cases.\n\nOnly 10 of this year's [2012] cases have been reported in Lane County, but officials are concerned that the number could climb. Most of the local cases involve children; the mean age among the 10 cases is 8.\n\n'We are not ready,' Lane County Public Health Officer Patrick Luedtke said Monday [9 Jul 2012]. 'The No. 1 prevention method is vaccination, and our vaccination rates are not high enough.'\n\nAccording to Luedtke, roughly 20 percent of Lane County children age 2 or younger are not vaccinated, about 3500 individuals. Infants younger than 3 months are particularly vulnerable because they are too young to be vaccinated and have not developed enough to properly handle the coughing fits, thus making it much more important for adults to be vaccinated to avoid passing the infection to infants, Luedtke said.\n\n'Whooping cough kills babies, period,' Luedtke said. 'And some people don't know that.'\n\nAccording to state figures, Lane ranks the 3rd highest among Oregon counties with 8.5 percent of residents declining vaccination on religious or philosophical grounds, including those who have concerns about possible side effects of vaccination.\n\n[Byline: Patrick Malee]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[An interactive ProMED-mail HealthMap can be seen at http://healthmap.org/r/1fWb.]\n\n******\n[2] Nevada (Clark County)\nDate: Wed 11 Jul 2012\nSource: 8 News Now [edited]\nhttp://www.8newsnow.com/story/18983109/health-district-reports-22-cases-of-pertussis\n\n\nThere have been 22 cases of pertussis reported in Clark County since the beginning of 2012, according to the Southern Nevada Health District.

'All teens and adults should get the Tdap shot. Even people who don't have close contact with babies can spread the illness to babies when they're in public.'\n\nAs of Friday, 6 Jul 2012, the Snohomish Health District had confirmed 408 cases of pertussis in Snohomish County since the start of 2012. 'This includes 6 hospitalizations, 5 of whom were infants,' said Suzanne Pate, public information officer for the Snohomish Health District, who noted that no infants in the county have died from pertussis in 2012, but one infant did die of it in August 2011.\n\nBabies younger than 2 months are not old enough to receive vaccinations and are at high risk for serious illnesses as a result. Statewide, there have been 173 reported cases of whooping cough among infants, 38 of whom were hospitalized.\n\nProtection provided by the childhood whooping cough vaccine series wears off over time, so teens and adults need a booster. People whose vaccine protection wears off may contract whooping cough themselves, but usually suffer from less severe symptoms and shorter illnesses and are less likely to spread the disease to others. Adults who aren't sure whether they've had the Tdap booster should check with their health care providers.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[An interactive ProMED-mail HealthMap can be seen at http://healthmap.org/r/1kJo.]\n\n******\n[4] Washington State (Yakima County)\nDate: Thu 12 Jul 2012\nSource: KIMA-TV [edited]\nhttp://www.kimatv.com/home/video/250-reported-cases-of-Whooping-Cough-in-Yakima-County-162295826.html\n\n\nThe Washington State Department of Health reports more than 2000 new cases [of whooping cough] since April 2012.

In fact, just in the 1st half of 2012, the county has had 5 times as many cases as in all of 2011.\n\nPertussis will typically peak every 3 to 5 years. While 2012 has been a peak year, it's unique in that the county is still seeing growing numbers of cases this far into summer.\n\n98 cases have been reported this year [2012] in Olmsted County, and the pattern is similar across Minnesota. According to Public Health, there's reason to believe many people are spreading the disease, and they don't even know they have it.\n\n'I do believe there are many people in the community that are unaware of the outbreak of pertussis but also about what the symptoms are,' said Linda Haeussinger of Olmsted County Public Health. 'The primary symptom of pertussis is coughing, and we cough for many reasons, bronchitis, pneumonia, allergies, etc.'\n\nFewer than 10 percent of adults across the country are vaccinated against the disease.

She added that Minnesota is 2nd to California in whooping cough cases in 2012. The bacterial disease, spread person to person through the air, goes in outbreak cycles between 7 to 10 years.\n\nMinkler added that there has been a drop in the pertussis immunization rate this year [2012], perhaps fueled by a fear from side effect reactions.

This increase continued into 2012 and extended into infants under 3 months who are at the highest risk of severe complications, hospitalisation, and death. A level 3 incident was declared in April 2012 to coordinate the response to the ongoing increased pertussis activity (1,2).\n\nPertussis is a cyclical disease with increases occurring every 3-4 years. The increase in 2011 has previously been reported (3), with the last peak occurring in 2008. During 2011, numbers of confirmed cases were high in age groups under 15 years, but in line with anticipated cyclical increases. The number of confirmed cases in the 15+ age group, however, exceeded expected levels; cases in this age group were nearly 50 per cent higher in 2011 than those in 2008. The data below update current pertussis activity to 30 Apr 2012.\n\nThe provisional total of confirmed cases of pertussis in 2012 in England and Wales to the end of April 2012 was 1080, compared with 248 in the same period in 2008 (table 1 [for tables, see source URL above. - Mod.LL]). High numbers of cases continue to be confirmed in individuals aged 15 years or older with 777 cases in this period in 2012, compared with 122 cases in 2008. Activity is also high in infants under 3 months with 100 cases in this period in 2012 compared with 49 cases in 2008. 5 pertussis-related deaths in infants were reported to 30 April 2012 and 3 to 30 Apr 2008.\n\nThis increase in reporting may, in part, be due to increased awareness among health professionals improving case ascertainment in older age groups. This is reflected by the increased demand for serology testing, which is the predominant method of confirmation in adolescents and adults who typically present with milder features late in the course of the illness. However, waning immunity following vaccination and/or natural infection is also likely to be an important contributory factor (4). The increase in pertussis activity has been observed across all regions in England with continuing reports of clusters in educational settings and incidents linked to health care settings. The highest numbers of confirmed cases in the first 4 months of 2012 have been in the South East and the South West regions (table 2 [see source URL above. - Mod.LL]).\n\nReferences/notes\n----------------\n1.

As of 22 May 2012, 548 confirmed cases have been reported to Public Health which is a significant increase compared with recent non-outbreak years (the last provincial outbreak In New Brunswick was reported in 2004 with 300 cases).\n\nThe outbreak is concentrated largely in the urban and surrounding areas of Moncton and Saint John, which are located in Health Region 1 and Health Region 2 of New Brunswick respectively. Approximately 53 percent of the cases are residents of Health Region 1 and 18 percent of the cases are from Health Region 2. A map outlining the 7 Health Regions of the Province can be found at: http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/82-583-x/2010001/article/11222-eng.pdf. However, cases continue to be reported in other areas of the province.\n\nThe highest proportion of cases are in children aged 10-14 years (47 percent of the cases), followed by people aged 20 years and up (19 percent of the cases), children aged 5-9 years (16 percent of the cases); adolescents aged 15-19 years (8 percent of the cases); children aged 1-4 years (6 percent of the cases) and infants under 1 year of age (3 percent of the cases). The highest rate of disease is in the 10-14 year age group (637 per 100 000); followed by 5-9 year olds (242 per 100 000); less than one year old (227 per 100 000); 1-4 year olds (114 per 100 000); 15-19 (93 per 100 000); and 20+ (18 per 100 000).\n\nIn New Brunswick pertussis containing vaccines are provided as primary series at 2, 4, 6 months of age; a booster at 18 months of age and between 4 and 6 years of age. 2 doses of vaccine are recommended for adolescents and adults. Most of the cases in the 10-14 age group (68 percent) and 4-9 age group (59 percent) have been immunized with 5 doses of pertussis containing vaccine: the primary series; the booster and the dose at 4-6 years.\n\nThe New Brunswick Office of the Chief Medical Officer of Health together with Regional Health Authorities implemented measures to improve immunization coverage of individuals who were not immunized in the last 5 years and who are in close contact with infants under one year of age and pregnant women. Immunization of pregnant women or postpartum immunization of mothers is recommended. A school-based Tdap immunization program for students in grades 6, 7 and 8 in the most affected areas is starting imminently to prevent the continued rise of pertussis in school age children and to further interrupt the transmission to infants. Students in less affected areas will be offered immunization in the 2012-2013 school year.\n\nMore information regarding the Pertussis outbreak, advice to physicians and the public is available at the Office of the Chief Medical Officer of Health website: http://www2.gnb.ca/content/gnb/en/departments/ocmoh/cdc/content/whooping_cough.html\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nNoortje Kunnen\nSenior Program Advisor\nCommunicable Disease Control Unit\nOffice of the Chief Medical Officer of Health\nDepartment of Health\nGovernment of New Brunswick, Canada\n<Noortje.Kunnen@gnb.ca>\n\n[Pro-MED sincerely thanks Noortje Kunnen from the New Brunswick Department of Health for this 1st-hand report of pertussis in New Brunswick.

The main victims of this acute respiratory infection caused by the bacterium _Bordetella pertussis_ (whooping cough), are infants younger than 6 months, usually acquired from their parents or teenage siblings, or even a member of the health care team. In infants, pertussis can be a serious disease that can lead to severe complications or even death, unlike what happens in adults or older children. The reemergence of the whooping cough or pertussis can be observed in the numbers of cases in the country.\n\nUp until 30 April 2012 597 cases of pertussis were confirmed by laboratory testing. In the same period of 2011, there were 315 cases: [this is] 90 percent more. The data comes from the National Reference Laboratory for_Bordetella pertussis_ of Argentina.\n\nThe cases reported in that period were in turn 1028 in 2011 and 2399 in 2012, which means an increase of 133 percent, perhaps explained by the deepening of the epidemiological surveillance that would result in greater reporting of suspect cases.\n\nThe Ministry of Health of Argentina reported thatin 2011 the cases reported were more than expected, a situation similar to that recorded in other countries of the region, such as Chile, Uruguay, Cuba and the USA, which also had outbreaks of the disease. In 2012, the situation has not changed, warned this week the head of the National Program for Control of vaccine-preventable diseases, Carla Vizzotti, who pointed out that the figures 'indicate a level of suspect cases confirms that we are in an outbreak, as happened in 2011.'\n\n\n[Byline: Marcela Fernandez]\n\n--\nCoomunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[In the USA as in Argentina, recommendations on the use of acellular pertussis vaccines have continued to expand in efforts to cocoon susceptible neonates to prevent the substantial morbidity and mortality in infants who have not been yet adequately immunized, like the ones described in this report. The use of the vaccine in pregnant women to provide passive immunity is a further expansion of these recommendations. It is likely, given the limited number of contacts small infants have, that the source for the infant is a family member.\n\nThe increasing susceptibility of older children and adults to pertussis, usually manifesting as chronic cough without the typical 'whoop,' after appropriate primary immunization continues to be increasingly reported. Waning immunity is generally thought to be the cause of the problem, but it is increasingly clear that _Bordetella pertussis_ clones are being selected by the acellular vaccine, against which we are no longer as well protected by the current vaccines.\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/r/1yJb.\n- Mod.

During 2011, the Laboratory Surveillance System (SIVILA, according to its Spanish initials) reported 1594 confirmed (pertussis) cases and 70 deaths in children less than one year old, and 91 percent of the total reported deaths occurred in children less than 4 years of age.\n\nIn 2011, notified cases were above the expected figures, and this situation was also observed in other countries in this region, such as the USA, Cuba, Chile, and Uruguay. These countries, together with Argentina, had pertussis outbreaks during 2011.\n\nFor the current year, 2012, data recorded in SIVILA up to the 16th epidemiological week (16-22 Apr 2012) indicates that there had been 2207 cases notified as compatible with pertussis, and 568 of them were reported to be positive for _Bordetella pertussis_.\n\nDr. Carla Vizotti, Head of the National Control Program for Immuno-Preventable Diseases, declared that 'this data indicates a number of suspected cases, confirming that we are still in the midst of an outbreak as it occurred in 2011.' The specialist pointed out that 'pertussis, also known as whooping cough, is a very contagious acute respiratory infection, and it is one of the main causes of morbidity and mortality in children.' She added: 'It is necessary to have boosters in vaccination, and we need to have a good vaccine coverage in order to stop the microorganism from circulating.'\n\nThe Argentinean Ministry of Health, alongside scientific societies who participate in the National Commission for Immunizations (CONIN, according to its Spanish initials), recommended in 2012 that a supplementary strategy -- purchasing and delivering vaccines to every province in the country -- should be developed, with the objective of immunizing 750 000 pregnant women during 2012.

Island County and school health officials say that more reports of cases of this contagious disease are possible at the 350 student school. The county health department reports at least 42 confirmed and probable cases of pertussis, also called whooping cough, on Whidbey and Camano islands as of 5 Jun 2012. 8 of the local students who contracted the disease had been vaccinated against pertussis, school nurse Tina Lewis said.\n\nIt is very likely most adults have not received the pertussis vaccine for adolescents and adults. Everyone over age 12 should have received at least one dose of the Tdap [or DTaP; tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis], said Island County health officer Roger Case. The immunization booster is required for school attendance for those over 11 years old. 'It is estimated that less than 10 per cent of the population has actually received the Tdap immunization,' Case said.\n\nBefore the development of the pertussis vaccine, the United States typically saw about 200 000 cases a year, she said. In 2010, 27 550 cases of whooping cough were reported across the nation, the highest number since 1959, she said.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has found that immunization reduces the odds of contracting pertussis, especially for children. 'Children who never received any doses of DTaP vaccine face odds of having whooping cough at least 8 times higher than children who received all 5 doses of the vaccine,' Patti said.\n\n[byline: Elisabeth Murray]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Washington State can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at http://healthmap.org/r/1kJo.

'Most disturbing is that one of the cases was not started on prophylaxis due to the health care provider not feeling it was necessary,' county health officer Joe Russell said. 'We follow the nationally recognized guidelines for identifying close contacts of known pertussis cases. Information regarding close contacts generally comes from the schools and the cases. When recommended intervention strategies are not followed, we can expect additional cases.'\n\nCommunity health director Jody White said, 'We are concerned with our infant population as they are too young to be immunized and don't have the naturally acquired abilities to fight the infection,' White said.

The diagnosis was whooping cough, a highly contagious respiratory disease that's breaking out in pockets across Maine. Most of the 80 cases reported in a surge of whooping cough, or pertussis, in the state in 2012 have struck middle school-aged children. In 4 cases, children under 6 months old were sickened.\n\nThe baby at MMC was treated with antibiotics and recovered, said Leah Mallory, a pediatric hospitalist at MMC. For other babies, the unrelenting cough can prove life threatening, according to Dr Lawrence Losey, a pediatrician at Parkview Adventist Medical Center in Brunswick. 'They are coughing so hard and so long that they run out of oxygen and it can cause brain damage and seizures,' he said.\n\n'Just over 60 per cent of infant pertussis is gotten from a family member; half of those are from mom,' said Losey, who was recognized last month [May 2012] by the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention for his work in childhood immunization. The danger pertussis poses to babies is one reason public health officials are pushing for better vaccination rates in Maine.\n\nCases of whooping cough are up significantly from 2011. So far in 2012, there have been 80 cases reported statewide, according to the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention. During the same period in 2011, 49 cases were reported. The spike in pertussis first cropped up in northern Maine, followed by outbreaks at schools in Skowhegan and Scarborough. Most cases this year have been reported in Somerset, Cumberland, York, and Penobscot counties.\n\nMaine is among 20 states that allow parents to exempt their children from school-required immunizations based on philosophical objections. Without an exemption, kindergarten students in Maine must be vaccinated against pertussis, diphtheria, tetanus, measles, mumps, rubella, polio, and chickenpox. About 3.5 per cent of Maine students attended school in 2009-10 without a vaccination, with the majority of parents citing religious and philosophical objections. Some cited medical reasons. The exemption rate inched up from 3.33 per cent the previous year, but remained lower than a peak rate of more than 4 per cent in 2007-08. Parents who skip vaccines say they object to the number of shots and fear a link between immunization and autism, according to a 2008 report by the Muskie School of Public Service.\n\n[byline: Jackie Farwell]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Maine can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at http://healthmap.org/r/1CfA.

Black Hawk County has seen 13 cases in April and May [2012], according to Kaitlin Emrich, disease surveillance program manager with the county health department. 4 of those were reported at East High School and another 4 at Hoover Middle School. However, numbers have slowed down the past few weeks. 'I don't know if that's because schools are letting out (for the summer), and kids are outside,' Emrich said. 'It's less likely to spread in an outdoor environment.'\n\nCommunicable disease staff has been working closely with school nurses to track down infected persons and alert those with whom they've been in contact, she said. As additional people display symptoms, health officials follow up to make sure they are tested and receive treatment if necessary.

The issue was raised this week during a board meeting of Wellington-Dufferin-Guelph Public Health.\n\nPertussis, commonly referred to as whooping cough, is highly contagious. Its presence was first confirmed in the Wellington-Dufferin-Guelph area on 15 Feb 2012, but the outbreak was declared elsewhere in late January 2012. The local health unit is one of 7 dealing with the problem.\n\nDr Nicola Mercer, medical officer of health, told board members that since the Low German Mennonite population generally does not seek medical attention or vaccination, fighting the outbreak is extremely difficult. She said public health officials are confident there are many other cases of whooping cough among the population. Immunization clinics have been set up, but are poorly attended.\n\nSo far 4 children have been hospitalized throughout the 7 health units. The family in the one case in Wellington-Dufferin-Guelph was provided access to antibiotic medications to treat the disease. The family refused immunization.\n\nAn outbreak roughly 2 years ago among the same Mennonite population left a number of people very sick. 'They continue to have an under-immunized population, so we likely will continue to have outbreaks,' Mercer said, adding that whooping cause can cause death. The most vulnerable are the very young. She added that an 85 percent immunization rate is generally what is needed to have a serious impact on a disease.\n\nThe hardest hit area so far is within the Elgin-St Thomas health unit, where there are 64 cases. Of the 82 confirmed cases within the district of the 7 health units, the median age of infection is 7 years.\n\nThe outbreak is occurring among members of the same religious community, who attend the same schools and churches.\n\n[Byline: Rob O'Flanagan]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Most of the ProMED-mail postings regarding pertussis have been related to outbreaks in immunized populations.

'We're seeing more cases than we would normally expect this time of year,' said Ruth Marx, epidemiologist with the department. 'We're up past 100 confirmed cases.'\n\nThe Health Department is working with area school districts: D.C. Everest, Wausau, Mosinee, Marathon and Newman Catholic, to help prevent the spread of the illness. Letters have been sent to parents of students who are classmates of children with whooping cough. If children who came in contact with others who have pertussis, commonly known as whooping cough, exhibit signs of cold symptoms, they should stay home and see a physician. People who are found to have whooping cough, and those who come in close contact with those who are ill, are prescribed a regimen of antibiotics.\n\nMost healthy teens and adults can recover from the illness, Marx said. But it's particularly dangerous to babies 6 months or younger or those who have compromised immune systems. 'It kills infants,' Marx said. 'Infants haven't received a full series of immunizations until they're 6 months old.'\n\n--\nCommunicated by\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[2] Montana (Ravalli County)\nDate: Tue 17 Apr 2012\nSource: NBC Montana [edited]\nhttp://www.nbcmontana.com/news/30910437/detail.html\n\n\nRavalli County reported one more pertussis case Tuesday [17 Apr 2012].

'I wasn't too worried.'\n\nBut a few days later, on 6 Jan 2012, his fever spiked to 104 degrees. So, in the middle of the night, the parents decided to take the baby to the emergency department at Baystate Children's Hospital in Springfield, Mass. near their home in Chicopee. He tested negative for flu and a common respiratory virus. By early morning, his fever was gone and the family was sent home. 3 weeks later he would be dead, a victim of pertussis, or whooping cough, a preventable but highly contagious bacterial disease that has been on the rise in recent decades.\n\nAt home, his breathing became slightly more labored; he'd been diagnosed with bronchiolitis, a swelling and buildup of mucus in the tiny air passages of the lungs, usually due to a viral infection. After another examination later in the week, a pediatrician prescribed albuterol to ease his symptoms.\n\nOn 16 Jan 2012, the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday, the infant started spitting up more and his breathing worsened. This time he was admitted to Baystate's pediatric ICU, his mother said. A medical team assessed him; and an infectious disease doctor suggested he might have pertussis, though the diagnosis remained uncertain. Indeed, the family didn't get confirmation of his pertussis until after his death, when a test for the disease came back positive. 'I could have bet my whole life that it wasn't pertussis,' the mother said, recalling her reaction when the illness was 1st mentioned. 'He wasn't coughing like I would have imagined. And I didn't know any infant who ever had pertussis.'\n\nBut pertussis, or whooping cough, or 'the cough of 100 days' for its generally long duration, has been on the rise since the 1980s, according to the CDC. The disease is characterized by violent, uncontrollable coughing (including the characteristic 'whoop' sound) that can make it hard to breathe. But sometimes there is no 'whoop.' And infants with pertussis don't always cough, but may have apnea, a long pause in their breathing. The disease is most common in young children; babies under one are particularly vulnerable and face the greatest risk of death.\n\nIn 2010, there were 27 550 reported cases of pertussis nationally, the CDC says. That year, in California, 9143 cases of pertussis, including 10 infant deaths, were reported, the greatest number of cases in 63 years, according to the CDC. Vermont had a pertussis outbreak in 2011. And on 3 Apr 2012, Washington State officials declared a pertussis 'epidemic,' with over 1000 cases reported.\n\nThe CDC recommends pertussis vaccines for infants, adolescents and adults (most recently, pregnant women), summarized here:\n\nInfants and children are recommended a dose of DTaP (Diphtheria, Tetanus, and Acellular Pertussis) vaccine at 2, 4 and 6 months, 15 through 18 months, and 4 through 6 years of age. Everyone 11 years and older, including pregnant women, is recommended one dose of Tdap (combined Tetanus, Diphtheria and Acellular Pertussis) vaccine, preferably at 11-12 years of age. Pregnant women are recommended to receive a dose of Tdap vaccine, preferably during the 3rd trimester or late 2nd trimester (after 20 weeks gestation). By getting Tdap vaccine during pregnancy, maternal pertussis antibodies transfer to the newborn, likely providing protection against pertussis in early life, before the baby starts getting DTaP vaccines. Tdap will also protect the mother at time of delivery, making her less likely to transmit pertussis to her infant. A CDC spokesperson adds: 'Everyone needs Tdap vaccine as an adolescent/adult even if they were fully vaccinated with DTaP or DTP vaccine as a child.'\n\nWhat, exactly, is driving the increase in pertussis cases isn't totally clear. Experts speak of a convergence of factors, including waning immunity after vaccination, low vaccine compliance among adults (who had coverage rates of only 8.2 percent in 2010, according to the CDC) and a general perception that whooping cough isn't a dire condition. Another factor may be that pertussis is going undiagnosed in many cases - since not everyone 'whoops' - allowing for disease to spread. In addition (though the CDC disputes this) declining use of antibiotics by doctors wary of overuse and drug resistance may also be a cause. Some put the blame on parents who refuse to vaccinate their children. But officials at the CDC say it's more likely that declining protection in vaccinated people rather than vaccine refusal is contributing to the increase.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[For a map showing the counties of Massachusetts, see http://www.digital-topo-maps.com/county-map/massachusetts.shtml. - Mod.MPP]\n\n*****\n[2] Idaho (Bannock County) infant fatality\nDate: Thu 3 May 2012\nSource: Local News 8 [edited]\nhttp://www.localnews8.com/news/31002886/detail.html\n\n\nAn infant from Pocatello died Thursday, from a once almost defeated disease now seeing a resurgence, pertussis. At 9 weeks old, this infant was too young to get a vaccine, but health professionals said if more people in the community made sure children got immunized, the baby likely wouldn't have caught this disease. The distinct wheezing noise a child infected with pertussis makes when gasping for breath in between fits of coughing, gave the disease its nickname, whooping cough.\n\n'Pertussis is a very contagious disease. It's a very debilitating, life-threatening disease also for little ones who can't fight it off,' Portneuf Medical Center Infection Preventionist Joyce Olson said. Olson said it is especially tragic when a child dies of a disease that has vaccines against it. 'It's very sad when any child that young, or any age, dies of pertussis, because it is a preventable one. It is a very sad situation,' Olson said.\n\nSoutheastern Idaho Public Health [SIPH] said if 90 percent of kids were vaccinated, the disease would be almost nonexistent. But many parents choose not to immunize their kids, some citing fears of a believed connection to autism. Those at SIPH said there's no significant danger from getting vaccinated. 'Vaccines are very, very safe. They are monitored so closely for any kind of adverse reaction, and the benefits of the vaccine, far, far, far and away outweigh any minimal risks,' SIPH District Director Maggie Mann said. It is a parents choice whether to immunize their kids, but those with SIPH said people should remember that one child not getting vaccinated means all children are more likely to get sick. 'While this is totally their call, whether or not to have their child vaccinated, it is critically important in protecting children against a variety of really serious childhood diseases,' Mann said.\n\nAccording to SIPH, in local communities 72 percent of children are immunized.\n\n[Byline: Jake Taylor]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[For a map of Idaho showing counties, see http://www.digital-topo-maps.com/county-map/idaho.shtml. - Mod.MPP]\n\n*****\n[3] Iowa (Howard County)\nDate; Wed 2 May 2012\nSource: Cresco Times [edited]\nhttp://www.crescotimes.com/articles/2012/05/02/news/doc4fa167dc61c09477724134.txt\n\n\nIn information released from Iowa Department of Public Health, as of [19 Apr 2012], 92 confirmed cases of pertussis have been reported in Iowa.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said pertussis is an endemic disease, meaning it's pretty common for outbreaks to occur on a regular basis at any time of the year in various parts of the country. \n\n\nA Maricopa County infant died of whooping cough in April 2012, the 1st such death since 2009, the county Department of Public Health said. 3 weeks later he would be dead, a victim of pertussis, or whooping cough, a preventable but highly contagious bacterial disease that has been on the rise in recent decades. This equates to an annualized overall rate of pertussis in Washington residents of 51.4 per 100 000 persons with a rate in infants of 269.5 per 100 000 should this trend continue throughout 2012.

A total of 35 cases of pertussis, or whooping cough, have been reported since 1 Jan 2012 in Hillsborough County. The 112 cases reported statewide so far indicate a possible spike not seen in several years, according to the Florida Department of Health.\n\nThe Hillsborough cases cropped up in the homes of 7 local families, said Warren McDougle, epidemiology program director at the Hillsborough County Health Department. In one case, an adult infected 6 children in the family who did not have vaccinations, he said. 'Pertussis has gotten in the adult population, and for them the experience is not unlike other respiratory illnesses where they cough and cough,' he said. 'It's not as severe as it is for children.'\n\nThis year-round illness is spreading beyond Florida. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also reports recent outbreaks in Montana, North Carolina, Texas, and Washington State.

Biedrzycki says the best prevention is vaccination, although the vaccine is not a 100 per cent guarantee an individual will not contract the illness.\n\n'It's all about vaccinating the siblings who are generally school age, or the adults who provide care to infants and toddlers as soon as possible, to interrupt the chain of transmission within the household or community setting,' Biedrzycki said.\n\nIn 3 months there have been 55 cases of pertussis in Milwaukee (from January 2012 to March 2012).

Pertussis (http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/967268-clinical) is a 6-week disease divided into catarrhal, paroxysmal, and convalescent stages, each lasting from 1-2 weeks. The 3 stages of disease progression are as follows:\n\nStage 1: the initial (catarrhal) phase is indistinguishable from common upper respiratory infections with nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, and sneezing, variably accompanied by low-grade fever, tearing, and conjunctival suffusion. Pertussis is most infectious when patients are in the catarrhal phase, but pertussis may remain communicable for 3 or more weeks after the onset of cough.\n\nStage 2: patients in the 2nd (paroxysmal) phase present with paroxysms of intense coughing lasting up to several minutes. In older infants and toddlers, the paroxysms of coughing occasionally are followed by a loud whoop as inspired air goes through a still partially closed airway. Infants younger than 6 months do not have the characteristic whoop but may have apneic episodes and are at risk for exhaustion. Posttussive vomiting and turning red with coughing are common in affected children.\n\nStage 3: patients in the 3rd (convalescent) stage have a chronic cough, which may last for weeks.\n\nPertussis (http://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/clinical/complications.html) can cause serious and potentially life-threatening complications in infants and young children who are not fully vaccinated.\n\nIn infants younger than 12 months of age who get pertussis, more than half must be hospitalized.

The disease is often referred to as whooping cough because of the sound that many people make as they gasp for breath.\n\nIt's a scary and sometimes fatal disease. Infants are most at risk for severe complications including pneumonia, dehydration and seizures. Even adults can have a hard time recovering from the intense cough.\n\n'Sometimes they can cough so hard that they break ribs or break the blood vessels in their eyes,' said nurse practitioner Patsy Stinchfield, director of Infectious Disease Services at Children's Hospitals and Clinics of Minnesota.\n\n'They call it the 100-day cough. And it really is true that you can have these cough spasms for up to 100 days,' she said.\n\nPeople who have pertussis are usually infectious for the 1st 3 weeks of their illness. The disease spreads easily during this time, which is why outbreaks are often seen in clusters at the community level.\n\nMinnesota's outbreak is scattered across several counties including Hennepin and Ramsey Counties. Nearby Wright County, just west of the metro area, is also reporting a higher than usual number of cases, with 77 so far. Pertussis clusters are centered mainly in the eastern part of the county around St. Michael, Rockford, Delano and Monticello.\n\n'All of 2010, we had 97 cases for the entire year, and that was a record for us,' said Christine Austin-Roehler, health promotion coordinator for Wright County Public Health. 'If you look at the fact that we have 77 cases already and the year's not even half over with, it is a lot of cases.'\n\nMost children are vaccinated for pertussis before enrolling in school. But the vaccine starts to wear off by adolescence. A booster vaccine has been available for adolescents and adults since 2005, but many people don't get the booster.\n\nThe state has had good vaccination rates among adolescents who are due for the booster shot, said Claudia Miller, the vaccine-preventable disease surveillance supervisor for the Minnesota Department of Health. That's because they tend to see their health care providers regularly. But Miller suspects the vaccination rate could be better among adults.\n\n'We don't have a good way to measure our coverage in the adult population, but we're concerned that we're not seeing the coverage that would be necessary to turn this pertussis incidence around,' Miller said. 'This is a vaccine-preventable disease, and we really should not be seeing hundreds of cases each year if we have good immunization coverage.'\n\nPertussis is a bacterial infection and can be treated with antibiotics. However, the drugs don't do a lot to cure the symptoms, but mainly help reduce the amount of infectious particles a person can pass on to others.\n\n[Byline: Lorna Benson]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[For a map of Minnesota with counties, see http://www.digital-topo-maps.com/county-map/minnesota.shtml. - Mod.MPP]\n\n******\n[2] Maine (statewide)\nDate: Thu 17 May 2012\nSource: Portland (ME) Press Herald [edited]\nhttp://www.onlinesentinel.com/news/whooping-cough-on-risein-maine-across-nation_2012-05-17.html\n\n\nThe number of whooping cough cases in Maine is on the rise, mirroring a nationwide trend that health officials attribute in part to children and adults failing to get booster shots every 10 years. Health officials began noticing an increase in whooping cough -- pertussis -- cases in 2011, mainly in Maine's northern counties. This month, May 2012, an outbreak of 8 cases in children was reported in Skowhegan, and Scarborough school officials notified parents of 4 cases in the elementary and middle schools.\n\nThe Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention has confirmed 67 cases in 2012, up 34 percent from the 50 cases reported through 17 May 2011. Only 53 cases were reported for all of 2010.\n\nThe 67 cases in Maine so far in 2012 include 13 in Cumberland County, 10 in York County and 12 in Somerset County. In 2011, a total of 205 cases were reported in Maine, far exceeding the 53 reported cases in 2010 and the 10-year average of 82 cases per year.\n\n'People thought this disease was gone, and we know it's not,' Sears said. He said the most effective way to protect against whooping cough is vaccination. Most children get the initial vaccination, but only 60 percent to 70 percent receive the booster shot around age 11, he said.\n\nDr. Ali Kopelman of Saco PrimeCare Pediatrics said that in the past year, she has treated 10 children with pertussis, including 3 in the past 3 months. All of the patients were ages 4 to 10 and were up to date on vaccinations.\n\n[Byline: Gillian Graham]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[For a map of Maine with counties, see http://www.digital-topo-maps.com/county-map/maine.shtml. - Mod.MPP]\n\n******\n[3] Pennsylvania (Allegheny County)\nDate: Thu 17 May 2012\nSource: Patch.com [edited]\nhttp://plum-oakmont.patch.com/articles/county-health-department-reports-growing-incidence-of-whooping-cough\n\n\nThe Allegheny County Health Department announced this week that a growing number of pertussis cases are being reported in the county.

Meanwhile, the state's pertussis cases jumped from 85 in 2009 to 274 in 2011, according to state Department of Health data.\n\nNew Mexico law allows parents to exempt their children from required vaccinations by claiming a religious or personal belief that forbids vaccinations. The rate of such exemptions was 5.8 per 1000 children in 2011, up from 2 per 1000 in 1999.\n\nAbout 112 pertussis cases were reported in 2012 through 5 May 2012, according to the Albuquerque Journal.\n\nState health officials remain uncertain what role vaccine exemptions play in outbreaks of preventable diseases such as pertussis, said David Selvage, a state Department of Health epidemiologist. 'When you look at cases of pertussis, if you are in an area where there are increased numbers of vaccine exemptions, there's an increased chance that you're going to be in a pertussis cluster,' Selvage said. The vaccine 'is the best protection we have against pertussis, but it's probably somewhere in the neighborhood of 80-to-85 percent effective,' Selvage said.\n\nA 2-month-old baby in San Miguel County died in May 2012, making it the 1st pertussis-related death of a New Mexico infant since 2005. Infants 6 months and younger are most vulnerable to whooping cough because they have not received multiple doses of the vaccine, said Dr. Joan Baumbach, the state's medical epidemiologist.

So far this year [2012], 1284 cases have been reported, a nearly 10-fold increase from 2011, according to the most recent update from the Washington State Department of Health (WSDH). On 3 Apr 2012, the state's health secretary, Mary Selecky, announced that the disease had reached epidemic levels. Fueled by concerns about the risks to babies who are too young to be vaccinated, the WSDH urged state residents to verify their vaccination status and launched public service radio announcements.\n\nOn 3 May 2012, Washington Governor Chris Gregoire tapped emergency funds to help curb the pertussis epidemic, urged healthcare professionals to get vaccinated and to vaccinate their patients, and announced that the CDC was allowing the state to redirect some funds to buy 27 000 doses of pertussis vaccine for uninsured and underinsured adults.\n\nRising numbers of cases in Skagit County have placed a burden on the local medical system, and county health officials have asked doctors to stop testing, which can be costly and delay diagnosis and treatment, and instead to use empiric antibiotic treatment on patients with pertussis symptoms, the New York Times reported on 12 May 2012.\n\nHoward Leibrand, MD, health officer for Skagit County, told the Times that the public health department's staff is half the size it was in 2008, thanks to years of budget cutting. Skagit County officials estimate that only one in 5 cases is being reported, which could mean the number of pertussis cases is much higher than official counts indicate.\n\nIn an update on national pertussis activity yesterday [13 May 2012], ProMED-mail, the online reporting system of the International Society for Infectious Diseases, highlighted 10 media reports detailing infant deaths or outbreaks since the end of April 2012 from 8 different states. The infant deaths were reported from Massachusetts, Idaho, and Arizona. In addition, the New Mexico Department of Health on 7 May 2012 reported the pertussis death of a 2-month old baby, the state's 1st from the disease since 2005.\n\nBesides staffing issues, health departments working to slow pertussis outbreaks have 2 other notable challenges: under-immunization and signs that the vaccine may not provide protection for as long as previously thought. For example, a 2011 report from the CDC of vaccination coverage in kindergarteners during the 2009-10 school year found that the level of school vaccine exemptions varied by state, with Washington state having the nation's highest level. As a result, Washington legislators last year [2011] tightened vaccine exemption laws, which now require parents to show they have consulted a physician before opting out of immunizations for their children, the Times reported.\n\nHowever, Thomas Clark, MD, an epidemiologist with the CDC's meningitis and vaccine-preventable disease branch, told the Times that many people sickened in outbreaks in Washington and other states received their childhood vaccinations, but changes in the vaccine in the early 1990s to reduce side effects may have had an impact on how long immunity lasts.\n\nPertussis outbreaks, especially a 2010 one in California that sickened more than 9100 people and led to the deaths of 10 babies, have prompted actions from the CDC's vaccine advisors. Earlier in 2012, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) streamlined its pertussis vaccine recommendation for adults, advising that anyone over age 19 receive one dose of tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis (Tdap) if they haven't received it already. In late 2010, ACIP also adjusted its pertussis vaccine recommendation to shore up a gap in protection in children ages 7 through 9 who haven't received all their recommended pertussis immunizations or whose status isn't known.\n\n[Byline: Lisa Schnirring]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[For a map of Washington State with counties, see http://www.digital-topo-maps.com/county-map/washington.shtml. - Mod.MPP]\n\n******\n[10] Wisconsin (La Crosse County)\nDate: Fri 18 May 2012\nSource: La Crosse (WI) Tribune [edited]\nhttp://lacrossetribune.com/news/local/county-reports-spike-in-whooping-cough-cases/article_aac24a22-a101-11e1-b8f2-001a4bcf887a.html\n\n\nThe number whooping cough cases in Wisconsin are at levels not seen since 2004.

The currently used acellular pertussis vaccine, as compared to the previously used whole cell killed vaccine, is much less reactogenic in children and able to be given to adults. However, research by both Dr Frits R Mooi from the Netherlands (Pertussis - Australia (04): newly emerging clones, discussion 20120322.1078115) and Dr Lyn Gilbert from Australia (Pertussis - Australia (03): newly emerging clones 20120321.1076103) has been previously highlighted in ProMED-mail reflecting antigenic changes in circulating clones of _Bordetella pertussis_ which may be causing the increased number of pertussis cases throughout the world. If so, these changes may result in a need for modifications to the currently used acellular pertussis vaccines, and without these modifications, selection and further spread of clones not as protected for by the vaccine will continue to increase.\n\nThe following is a discussion regarding pertussis from the CDC web site: http://www.cdc.gov/Features/Pertussis/):\n\nPertussis (whooping cough) is a very contagious disease caused by a type of bacterium called _Bordetella pertussis_. Among vaccine-preventable diseases, pertussis is one of the most commonly occurring ones in the USA.\n\nPertussis vaccine protection\n----------------------------\nThere is high pertussis vaccine coverage for children nationwide. However, protection from the childhood vaccine decreases over time. Preteens, teens and adults need to be revaccinated, even if they were completely vaccinated as children.\n\nAlso, pertussis vaccines are very effective but not 100 percent effective. If pertussis is circulating in the community, there is still a chance that a fully vaccinated person can catch this very contagious disease. When you or your child develops a cold that includes a prolonged or severe cough, it may be pertussis. The best way to know is to contact your doctor.\n\nPertussis symptoms\n------------------\nPertussis can cause serious illness in infants, children and adults. The disease starts like the common cold, with runny nose or congestion, sneezing, and maybe mild cough or fever. But after 1-2 weeks, severe coughing can begin.\n\nUnlike the common cold, pertussis can become a series of coughing fits that continues for weeks. Pertussis can cause violent and rapid coughing, over and over, until the air is gone from the lungs and you are forced to inhale with a loud 'whooping' sound. In infants, the cough can be minimal or not even there.\n\nWhen the source of whooping cough was identified, mothers were responsible for 30-40 percent of infant infections. If you are pregnant and have not been previously vaccinated with Tdap (the whooping cough booster shot), talk with your doctor about getting one dose of Tdap, preferably during the 3rd trimester or late 2nd trimester, or immediately after delivery before leaving the hospital or birthing center with your newborn.\n\nDisease complications\n---------------------\nPertussis is most severe for babies; more than half of infants younger than one year of age who get the disease must be hospitalized. About one in 5 infants with pertussis get pneumonia (lung infection), and about one in 100 will have convulsions. In rare cases (one in 100), pertussis can be deadly, especially in infants.\n\nHow pertussis spreads\n---------------------\nPeople with pertussis usually spread the disease by coughing or sneezing while in close contact with others, who then breathe in the pertussis bacteria. Many infants who get pertussis are infected by parents, older siblings, or other caregivers who might not even know they have the disease.\n\nPertussis trends\n----------------\nReported cases of pertussis vary from year to year and tend to peak every 3-5 years. In 2010, 27 550 cases of pertussis were reported in the USA, and many more cases go unreported. 27 deaths were reported, 25 of these deaths were in children younger than one year old. Since the 1980s, there has been an increase in the number of cases of pertussis, especially among teens (10-19 years of age) and babies younger than 6 months of age. In 2010, an increase in reported cases among 7-10 year olds was seen. This new trend reinforces the need for a routinely recommended booster dose of Tdap at age 11 or 12 years.\n\nPreventing pertussis\n--------------------\nThe best way to prevent pertussis is to get vaccinated. Parents can also help protect infants by keeping them away as much as possible from anyone who has cold symptoms or is coughing.\n\nVaccine recommendations\n-----------------------\nFor Infants and Children: In the USA, the recommended pertussis vaccine for children is called DTaP. This is a safe and effective combination vaccine that protects children against 3 diseases: diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis. For maximum protection against pertussis, children need 5 DTaP shots. The 3 shots are given at 2, 4, and 6 months of age. The 4th shot is given at 15 through 18 months of age, and a 5th shot is given when a child enters school, at 4 through 6 years of age. If a 7-10 year old is not up-to-date with DTaP vaccines, a dose of Tdap should be given before the 11-12 year old check up.\n\nFor Preteens and Teens: Vaccine protection for pertussis, tetanus, and diphtheria can decrease with time. Preteens going to the doctor for their regular check-up at age 11 or 12 years should get a booster vaccine, called Tdap. Teens and young adults who didn't get a booster of Tdap as a preteen should get one dose when they visit their health care provider.\n\nFor Pregnant Women: Pregnant women who have not been previously vaccinated with Tdap should get one dose of Tdap during the 3rd trimester or late 2nd trimester, or immediately postpartum, before leaving the hospital or birthing center. By getting Tdap during pregnancy, maternal pertussis antibodies transfer to the newborn, likely providing protection against pertussis in early life, before the baby starts getting DTaP vaccines. Tdap will also protect the mother at time of delivery, making her less likely to transmit pertussis to her infant.\n\nFor Adults: Adults who didn't get Tdap as a preteen or teen should get one dose of Tdap. Getting vaccinated with Tdap at least 2 weeks before coming into close contact with an infant is especially important for families with, and caregivers of, new infants. Adults 65 years and older who have close contact with infants should also get a dose of Tdap if they never have before.\n\nThe easiest thing for adults to do is to get Tdap instead of their next regular tetanus booster as the Td shot that is recommended for adults every 10 years.

' In 2011, a total of 205 cases were reported in Maine, far exceeding the 53 reported cases in 2010 and the 10-year average of 82 cases per year. \n\n[Byline: Elizabeth Donald]\n\n--\n \n\n[The current substantial increase in pertussis cases probably has multiple etiologies, including parental-signed exemptions to the vaccination, overall under-vaccination, and waning immunity of the vaccine protection. Another 5 cases of pertussis have been reported to the Madison County Health Department since the 1st 14 cases appeared almost overnight in late April 2012. http://www.bnd.com/2012/05/18/2180254/another-five-cases-of-whooping.html\n\n\nWhile Madison County's 'spike' in pertussis cases has slowed, health officials are still concerned about the sudden increase in so-called 'whooping cough' cases. On 3 May 2012, Washington Governor Chris Gregoire tapped emergency funds to help curb the pertussis epidemic, urged healthcare professionals to get vaccinated and to vaccinate their patients, and announced that the CDC was allowing the state to redirect some funds to buy 27 000 doses of pertussis vaccine for uninsured and underinsured adults. The number of children in New Mexico who were exempt from required vaccinations has tripled, as the number of cases of whooping cough reported in the state spiked in recent years, state health officials said. There have been 46 confirmed or probable pertussis cases since the beginning of 2012, well above the average of 7 reported cases in that period over the past several years. PERTUSSIS - USA (09)\n********************\n \n\nDr. Ali Kopelman of Saco PrimeCare Pediatrics said that in the past year, she has treated 10 children with pertussis, including 3 in the past 3 months. That's more than double the number of cases reported earlier this month [May 2012] and exceeds the total number of cases reported last year [2011]. Health officials began noticing an increase in whooping cough -- pertussis -- cases in 2011, mainly in Maine's northern counties. When you look at cases of pertussis, if you are in an area where there are increased numbers of vaccine exemptions, there's an increased chance that you're going to be in a pertussis cluster,' Selvage said. http://www.laureloutlook.com/news/article_91b949f2-9f6e-11e1-ad44-0019bb2963f4.html\n\n\nSix confirmed cases of pertussis, or 'whooping cough,' in Yellowstone County have been reported to county health officials. Earlier in 2012, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) streamlined its pertussis vaccine recommendation for adults, advising that anyone over age 19 receive one dose of tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis (Tdap) if they haven't received it already. Skagit County officials estimate that only one in 5 cases is being reported, which could mean the number of pertussis cases is much higher than official counts indicate. \n\nBesides staffing issues, health departments working to slow pertussis outbreaks have 2 other notable challenges: under-immunization and signs that the vaccine may not provide protection for as long as previously thought. [7] New Mexico (statewide) infant mortality\n[8] Iowa (Cerro Gordo County)\n \n\nA 2-month-old baby in San Miguel County died in May 2012, making it the 1st pertussis-related death of a New Mexico infant since 2005. \n\n'All of 2010, we had 97 cases for the entire year, and that was a record for us,' said Christine Austin-Roehler, health promotion coordinator for Wright County Public Health. ' ---------------------\nPertussis is most severe for babies; more than half of infants younger than one year of age who get the disease must be hospitalized. The number of pertussis cases in Minnesota is surging, approaching 700 cases of the highly-contagious respiratory disease, according to the Minnesota Department of Health. This month, May 2012, an outbreak of 8 cases in children was reported in Skowhegan, and Scarborough school officials notified parents of 4 cases in the elementary and middle schools. \n\nSeveral states have reported pertussis outbreaks in 2012, but Washington's outbreak appears to be the largest. If you have a child with reduced immunities, we encourage you to take precautionary measures including contacting your medical care provider.'\n\n--\n So far this year [2012], 1284 cases have been reported, a nearly 10-fold increase from 2011, according to the most recent update from the Washington State Department of Health (WSDH). In late 2010, ACIP also adjusted its pertussis vaccine recommendation to shore up a gap in protection in children ages 7 through 9 who haven't received all their recommended pertussis immunizations or whose status isn't known. \n\nThe state has had good vaccination rates among adolescents who are due for the booster shot, said Claudia Miller, the vaccine-preventable disease surveillance supervisor for the Minnesota Department of Health. The Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention has confirmed 67 cases in 2012, up 34 percent from the 50 cases reported through 17 May 2011. In addition, the New Mexico Department of Health on 7 May 2012 reported the pertussis death of a 2-month old baby, the state's 1st from the disease since 2005.

The strain is not 'new,' however, and was 1st identified in 2004 in the Netherlands (1). On the basis of a mutation in the pertussis toxin promoter region, we designated this strain the P3 strain (or lineage) and showed that it produced higher levels of pertussis toxin compared to the strains it replaced (2).\n\nThe emergence of P3 strains was found to be associated with increases in pertussis notifications in Finland and the Netherlands (2). We also found that the P3 strains have a global distribution and very likely evolved recently (3 and unpublished data).

'Have your child fully vaccinated and to be alert for symptoms in your child and if they do have symptoms, consult your physician.' says Butler. 'Keep the child away from infants, pregnant women, and people are immunocompromised in particular. If whooping cough is strongly suspected, they need to stay away from everyone.'\n\nOn average, Orange County sees about 3 cases of whooping cough per year.

Clin Infect Dis. (2012) doi: 10.1093/cid/cis287) is one of the 1st detailed analyses of a recent North American pertussis outbreak found widespread disease among fully vaccinated older children. Starting approximately 3 years after prior vaccine dose, attack rates markedly increased, suggesting inadequate protection or durability from the acellular vaccine.\n\n'Abstract\n---------\nBackground: Despite widespread childhood vaccination against _Bordetella pertussis_, disease remains prevalent. It has been suggested that acellular vaccine may be less effective than previously believed. During a large outbreak, we examined the incidence of pertussis and effectiveness of vaccination in a well-vaccinated, well-defined community.\n\n'Methods: Our center provides care to 135 000 patients, 40 percent of the population of Marin County, CA. 171 patients with a positive Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test for _B. pertussis_ from 1 Mar 2010 to 31 Oct 2010 were identified. Electronic medical records were reviewed for demographics and vaccination status.\n\n'Results: We identified 171 cases of clinical pertussis; 132 in pediatric patients. There was a notable increase in cases in patients aged 8-12. The rate of testing peaked in infants, but remained relatively constant until age 12. The rate of positive tests was low for ages zero to 6, and increased in preadolescents, peaking at age 12. Vaccination rates of PCR positive preadolescents were approximately equal to that of controls. Vaccine effectiveness was 41 percent, 24 percent, 79 percent, for ages 2-7, 8-12, 13-18, respectively.\n\n'Conclusions: Our data suggests that the current schedule of acellular pertussis vaccine doses is insufficient to prevent outbreaks of pertussis. We noted a markedly increased rate of disease from age 8 through 12, proportionate to the interval since the last scheduled vaccine. Stable rates of testing ruled out selection bias. The possibility of earlier or more numerous booster doses of acellular pertussis vaccine either as part of routine immunization or for outbreak control should be entertained.'\n\nThis paper along with further observations regarding shifting of the antigenicity of the recent clones of _B. pertussis_ (Pertussis - Australia (03): newly emerging clones Archive Number: 20120321.1076103) further underscore the need for potential revisions in the vaccine and vaccine schedule for pertussis prevention. - Mod.LL]", "summary": "A ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n Communicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The interactive HealthMap/ProMED map is available at:\nhttp://healthmap.org/r/1*XY - CopyEd.

The reason, according to Diaz, is that 'the vaccine confers\nprotective immunity for approximately 10 years, therefore, young\npeople and adults are likely to contract the disease and spread it to\ninfants younger than 6 months of age, who are at the greatest risk.'\n\nSo far, 11 deaths have been recorded, 6 of them in the Bio-Bio Region\nalone. 'Children younger than 6 months of age are at risk of a very\nserious disease, respiratory distress, and death,' said the official.\n\nThe cocoon vaccination campaign will begin in Bio-Bio and seeks to\naddress the 209 per cent increase in cases of whooping cough compared\nto those reported in 2010. '(Last year) to date we had 794 cases,\ntherefore there is an almost 3-fold increase in the numbers of\nprevious years (...)

The reason, according to Diaz, is that 'the vaccine confers\nprotective immunity for approximately 10 years, therefore, young\npeople and adults are likely to contract the disease and spread it to\ninfants younger than 6 months of age, who are at the greatest risk.' The overall\ncomplication rate of pertussis is 5-6 per cent, but among infants\nyounger than 6 months, the complication rate can be 3-4 times that\nnumber. \n\nUndersecretary Diaz explained to Radio Cooperativa the new 'cocoon\nvaccine' strategy, which consists in vaccinating pregnant mothers and\npeople older than 12 years of age whose families include newborn\ninfants. \n\nThe increasing susceptibility in older children and adults to\npertussis usually manifesting as chronic cough without the typical\n'whoop' after appropriate primary immunization continues to be\nincreasingly reported. \n\nRecommendations on the use of 'cocooning' acellular pertussis vaccines\nin the United States has existed in an attempt to expand protection in\nsusceptibles to prevent the substantial morbidity and mortality in\ninfants who have not been yet adequately immunized. The commonest\ncomplications of pertussis infection, especially in young infants\ninclude apnea, pneumonia, and weight loss secondary to feeding\ndifficulties and post-coughing vomiting. \n\n\nJorge Diaz, undersecretary for health, reported an anomalous situation\nwith the detection to date of 2030 cases of whooping cough, or\npertussis, which mainly affects infants younger than 1 year of age. \n\nThe cocoon vaccination campaign will begin in Bio-Bio and seeks to\naddress the 209 per cent increase in cases of whooping cough compared\nto those reported in 2010.

'We saw enough cases that we became concerned and decided it was time to act.'\n\nAdults and youth in contact with young children who have not had the pertussis vaccine in the last 5 years are urged to get vaccinated. The goal is to immunize adults, for whom pertussis is more of an irritant, so they don't act as carriers infecting infants, who are most at risk and are hospitalized in more than half of cases.\n\nThree children have already been hospitalized due to the outbreak, including a 2-week-old baby that ended up in intensive care for 5 weeks. All 3 have recovered. Most infants infected get it from parents or close family members.\n\nCalifornia had a huge outbreak in 2009 that claimed the lives of 10 children; 5 more died in Saskatchewan in 2010, and 2 more children died in 2011 just across the border in Washington State, where authorities are still battling an outbreak.\n\n[Byline: Jeff Nagel]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[In assessing the durability of pertussis vaccination in children, some researchers noted that: 'Reported cases and outbreaks in older children and young adults may reflect a less durable vaccine-induced protection than seen in natural disease (Cherry JD, Brunell PA, Golden GA, Karzon, DT.

The pertussis medication, which is usually 35 dollars, is now free for a limited time, and the department will be holding a communitywide vaccination clinic in March 2012.\n\nThe decision follows a countywide pertussis outbreak that has 82 confirmed, probable, suspected, or epidemiologically linked cases of pertussis, commonly known as whooping cough, since the middle of December 2011.\n\n'Epi-link' cases refer to pertussis cases in which the disease develops in a person who had been in close contact with someone who had a lab-confirmed case. 'Probable' defines a case of pertussis in which the patient has not been in close contact with a lab-confirmed case but has exhibited symptoms for 2 or more weeks, said Communicable Disease Program Coordinator Ayo White.\n\nTo date, said White, there have been 15 lab-confirmed, 31 epi-linked, 3 probable, and 3 suspect cases in Alamance County.

She said those at the highest risk take precedence, such as those children who have been in close proximity to confirmed cases and have poor immune systems.\n\nHealth officials are concentrating their efforts on immunizing as many people as possible, especially those at higher risk.

Babies, according to the letter, signed by Eileen Benoliel, a public health nurse in the Communicable Disease Epidemiology & Immunization Program at Public Health, Seattle & King County, can die from pertussis.\n\nThe letter was issued late Fri 25 Feb 2012, after officials learned there are 4 confirmed cases of pertussis at the Vashon School District and 2 confirmed cases of the disease in school-age children who attend a private school on Vashon. School officials believe there's a linkage to those cases, or 'evidence of contagion,' as Sarah Day, Vashon's school nurse, put it, which led to the county's letter.\n\nAccording to recently tabulated numbers, 33 percent of the students in the Vashon school district have not been fully vaccinated against whooping cough. What's more, according to health officials, the immunization is not highly effective or long-lasting. Health officials believe the pertussis vaccine is only 59 to 89 percent effective in preventing the disease.\n\nAccording to the state Department of Health, there were 728 cases of pertussis in Washington from 1 Jan to 17 Dec 2011. This compares with 529 cases in the same period in 2010. 86 infants under one had the illness and 29 were hospitalized, including 23 who were under 3 months. 2 infants died. In King County, there were 98 confirmed cases in 2011, according to James Apa, the communications manager for county health department.\n\nVashon School District currently has 75 students who don't have either a record of their immunizations or a signed waiver on file, Soltman said. Next week [week of 27 Feb 2012], he said, the district will issue letters to the parents or guardians of those students, telling them that they have 30 days to submit documentation of immunization or a waiver to the district. Those students whose families don't comply, he said, won't be allowed to attend public school.\n\n'In light of the concerns from the county health department,' Soltman said, 'we need to get Vashon's schools in compliance with the state's immunization laws.'\n\n[Byline: Leslie Brown]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The state of Washington can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at http://healthmap.org/r/1hcI.

'Babies who are not\nvaccinated or who have not completed the series of recommended\nvaccines are particularly vulnerable. The disease in this age group\noften results in hospitalization and can be fatal.'\n\nFor the 1st half of 2010, state health authorities reported 1337\ncases of pertussis in the state, a rate 3.4 cases per 100 000\ninhabitants, representing an increase of 500 percent over the same\nperiod in 2009.\n\nCDPH statistics show that the highest incidence of pertussis in\ninfants under 6 months of age occurs among Hispanics at a rate of\n94.2 cases per 100 000, more than double that of African Americans.\n\n'Studies have shown that half of children with whooping cough are\ninfected by their parents, particularly their mothers,' states the\nCDPH instructive about its prevention. 'Therefore, vaccination of\nparents and caregivers against whooping cough before or just after\nthe birth of the child is the most important way to protect babies.'\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The state of California can be seen on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail\ninteractive map at\n<http://healthmap.org/r/00aj>. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ]\n\n******\n[2] Michigan\nDate: Tue 13 Jul 2010\nSource: Michigan Public Radio [edited]\n<http://www.publicbroadcasting.net/michigan/news.newsmain/article/1/0/1674931/Michigan.News/Whooping.Cough.On.The.Rise.In.Michigan>\n\n\nMore people are getting pertussis in Michigan and across the nation.\nThe disease, better known as whooping cough, because of the intense\ncough that children with the disease often exhibit.\n\nFatima Mamou is an epidemiologist with Genesee County Health\nDepartment.

Health care facilities and\nproviders should institute policies to achieve these recommendations.\n\nCDPH recommends that all patients without documentation of full\nimmunization against pertussis be fully immunized at the earliest\nopportunity, particularly:\n\n- Women of childbearing age: CDPH recommends that all women of\nchildbearing age be vaccinated with Tdap, preferably before\npregnancy, but otherwise during or after pregnancy, although\npregnancy is not a contraindication to vaccination (1,4). The\nAmerican Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends that unvaccinated\npregnant adolescents be given the same consideration for Tdap\nvaccination as non-pregnant adolescents (1). The Advisory Committee\non Immunization Practices (ACIP) prefers Tdap vaccination in the\nimmediate postpartum period (4). AAP, ACIP, and the American College\nof Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommend that, when given\nduring pregnancy, it is preferable to administer Tdap during the 2nd\nor 3rd trimester to minimize the coincidental association of Tdap\nvaccination with adverse outcomes, which occur most often during the\n1st trimester (1,2,4,6).\n\n- Other close contacts of infants: CDPH recommends that birth\nhospitals and other immunizers provide Tdap to all close contacts of\ninfants without documentation of Tdap vaccination, especially parents\nand childcare providers. Contacts should be immunized before mother\nand baby are discharged after birth, regardless of when the contacts\nreceived any prior doses of Td.\n\n- Health care personnel: CDPH recommends that all health care\npersonnel, particularly those who have direct contact with infants\nand pregnant women, be immunized with Tdap to protect their patients\nand themselves. Effective 1 Sep 2010, the Cal/OSHA Aerosol\nTransmissible Disease Standard requires all hospitals, outpatient\nmedical facilities, and other employers covered by the standard to\noffer Tdap immunization to their employees who may be exposed to\npertussis. Employees who decline to be vaccinated must sign a\ndeclination form.\n\n- Patients with wounds: CDPH recommends that providers administer\nTdap (instead of Td or TT) whenever tetanus toxoid is indicated for\nwound management in patients 7 years of age and older.\n\nWhen the risk of contracting pertussis is elevated, as at present,\nACIP and AAP recommendations permit any interval between doses of Td\nand Tdap. In contrast to the grave potential risks of susceptible\npersons becoming infected and transmitting pertussis to vulnerable\ninfants, the most common adverse reaction to tetanus or diphtheria\nvaccines is a local reaction at the injection site, which may be more\nlikely after an increased number of prior doses (9); however, recent\nstudies and reports suggest that doses of Tdap given after previous\nTd or DTaP are well tolerated at intervals as brief as 1-18 months\n(3,7,8). An undocumented history of immunization with Tdap or Td is\nnot a valid reason to avoid or delay administration of Tdap.\n\nThe only contraindications to immunization with Tdap, both rare, are:\n- a documented history of anaphylaxis after receipt of Tdap, DTaP or\ntheir ingredients; or\n- encephalopathy occurring within 7 days after immunization against\npertussis that was not due to another identifiable cause (5,6).\n\nUse beyond licensed age groups is permitted by law:\n- 7-9 Years: CDPH recommends administration of Tdap to children 7\nthrough 9 years of age whenever vaccination against tetanus,\ndiphtheria, or pertussis is indicated. Existing data suggest that the\nuse of Tdap at these ages is safe (7, 10); in Canada, Tdap is\nlicensed for persons 4 years of age and older.\n\n- 65+ Years: CDPH recommends administration of Tdap to persons 65\nyears of age and older. Local and systemic events after Tdap\nvaccination have been reported less frequently in adults less than 65\nyears than in adolescents (5,11). Published data on the safety and\nvaccine efficacy of Tdap in persons 65 years and older are limited.\nEven if the immunogenicity of Tdap is found to decline with age, any\nadditional protection provided could help to limit transmission and\nprotect the vulnerable.\n\nUse of Tdap beyond licensed age groups may or may not be covered by\nprivate insurers.\n\nPertussis (whooping cough) is highly contagious and is spread by\ninhalation of respiratory droplets or aerosols. A high level of\ncommunity immunity is needed to reduce the incidence of pertussis,\nbut immunity from immunization or disease wanes over time. Most\nchildren vaccinated for pertussis before kindergarten are susceptible\nagain by early adolescence.\n\nTdap immunization rates in adolescents and adults are currently low.\nAs a result, pertussis continues to circulate widely, resulting in\nthe hospitalization and death of young infants who are too young for\nroutine immunization with DTaP. As of 15 Jul 2010, there have been 5\nreported 2010 infant deaths due to pertussis in California. Close\ncontacts, most often mothers, are the most common known source of\npertussis in infants (12). Thus, vaccinating household contacts,\nhealth care personnel, and child care workers against pertussis is\nrecommended at least 2 weeks before their contact with young infants\n(5,6). Increasing community immunity through widespread immunization\nwill also decrease the chances that vulnerable infants will be\nexposed to pertussis. Immunization will also prevent debilitating\ncases of pertussis in older children, adolescents, and adults.\n\n1. American Academy of Pediatrics. Pertussis.

A\nreally common report we hear is that an adult has a cough, but\ndoesn't feel that sick, and ends up passing pertussis on to a baby or\nyoung child.

Since 2004, a mean of 3055 infant\npertussis cases with more than 19 deaths has been reported each year\nthrough the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (CDC,\nunpublished data, 2011). The majority of pertussis cases,\nhospitalizations, and deaths occur in infants aged 2 months or\nyounger, who are too young to be vaccinated; therefore, other\nstrategies are required for prevention of pertussis in this age\ngroup.\n\nSince 2005, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP)\nhas recommended tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid and\nacellular pertussis (Tdap) booster vaccines to unvaccinated postpartum\nmothers and other family members of newborn infants to protect infants\nfrom pertussis, a strategy referred to as cocooning (1). Over the past\n5 years, cocooning programs have proven difficult to implement widely\n(2,3). Cocooning programs might achieve moderate vaccination coverage\namong postpartum mothers but have had limited success in vaccinating\nfathers or other family members. On 22 Jun 2011, ACIP made\nrecommendations for use of Tdap in unvaccinated pregnant women and\nupdated recommendations on cocooning and special situations. This\nreport summarizes data considered and conclusions made by ACIP and\nprovides guidance for implementing its recommendations.\n\nACIP recommends a single Tdap dose for persons aged 11 through 18\nyears who have completed the recommended childhood diphtheria and\ntetanus toxoids and pertussis/diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and\nacellular pertussis (DTP/DTaP) vaccination series and for adults aged\n19 through 64 years who have not previously received Tdap (1,4). ACIP\nalso recommends that adults aged 65 years and older receive a single\ndose of Tdap if they have or anticipate having close contact with an\ninfant aged <12 months and previously have not received Tdap (5). 2\nTdap vaccines are available in the United States. Adacel (Sanofi\nPasteur) is licensed for use in persons aged 11 through 64 years.\nBoostrix (GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals) is licensed for use in persons\naged 10 years or older (6).\n\nThe ACIP Pertussis Vaccines Work Group reviewed unpublished Tdap\nsafety data from pregnancy registries and the Vaccine Adverse Event\nReporting System (VAERS) and published studies on use of Tdap in\npregnant women. The Work Group also considered the epidemiology of\npertussis in infants and provider and program feedback, and then\npresented policy options for consideration to ACIP. These updated\nrecommendations on use of Tdap in pregnant women are consistent with\nthe goal of reducing the burden of pertussis in infants.\n\nSafety of Tdap in Pregnant Women\n--------------------------------\nIn prelicensure evaluations, the safety of administering a booster\ndose of Tdap to pregnant women was not studied. Because information on\nuse of Tdap in pregnant women was lacking, both manufacturers of Tdap\nestablished pregnancy registries to collect information and pregnancy\noutcomes from pregnant women vaccinated with Tdap. Data on the safety\nof administering Tdap to pregnant women are now available. ACIP\nreviewed published and unpublished data from VAERS, Sanofi Pasteur\n(Adacel) and GlaxoSmithKline (Boostrix) pregnancy registries, and\nsmall studies (7,8). ACIP concluded that available data from these\nstudies did not suggest any elevated frequency or unusual patterns of\nadverse events in pregnant women who received Tdap and that the few\nserious adverse events reported were unlikely to have been caused by\nthe vaccine. Both tetanus and diphtheria toxoids (Td) and tetanus\ntoxoid vaccines have been used extensively in pregnant women worldwide\nto prevent neonatal tetanus. Tetanus- and diphtheria-toxoid containing\nvaccines administered during pregnancy have not been shown to be\nteratogenic (9,10). From a safety perspective, ACIP concluded that\nadministration of Tdap after 20 weeks' gestation is preferred to\nminimize the risk for any low-frequency adverse event and the\npossibility that any spurious association might appear causative.\n\nTransplacental Maternal Antibodies\n----------------------------------\nFor infants, transplacentally transferred maternal antibodies might\nprovide protection against pertussis in early life and before\nbeginning the primary DTaP series. Several studies provide evidence\nsupporting the existence of efficient transplacental transfer of\npertussis antibodies (7,11,12). Cord blood from newborn infants whose\nmothers received Tdap during pregnancy or before pregnancy had higher\nconcentrations of pertussis antibodies when compared with cord blood\nfrom newborn infants of unvaccinated mothers (7,11). The half-life of\ntransferred maternal pertussis antibodies is approximately 6 weeks\n(12). The effectiveness of maternal antipertussis antibodies in\npreventing infant pertussis is not yet known, but pertussis-specific\nantibodies likely confer protection and modify the severity of\npertussis illness (13,14). In addition, a woman vaccinated with Tdap\nduring pregnancy likely will be protected at time of delivery, and\ntherefore less likely to transmit pertussis to her infant. After\nreceipt of Tdap, boosted pertussis-specific antibody levels peak after\nseveral weeks, followed by a decline over several months (15,16). To\noptimize the concentration of maternal antibodies transferred to the\nfetus, ACIP concluded that unvaccinated pregnant women should receive\nTdap, preferably in the 3rd or late 2nd (after 20 weeks gestation)\ntrimester.\n\nInterference with Infant Immune Response to Primary DTaP Vaccination\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nSeveral studies have suggested that maternal pertussis antibodies can\ninhibit active pertussis-specific antibody production after\nadministration of DTaP vaccine to infants of mothers vaccinated with\nTdap during pregnancy, referred to as blunting (12,17). Because\ncorrelates of protection are not fully understood, the clinical\nimportance of blunting of an infant's immune response is not clear.\nEvidence suggests that any blunting would be short-lived because\ncirculating maternal antibodies decline rapidly (12,18). Circulating\nmaternal pertussis antibodies might reduce an infant's risk for\npertussis in the 1st few months of life but slightly increase risk for\ndisease because of a blunted immune response after receipt of primary\nDTaP doses. The benefit would be to reduce the risk for disease and\ndeath in infants aged less than 3 months, but the trade-off might be\nto increase the occurrence of pertussis in older infants; however,\nthis group experiences a substantially lower burden of\nhospitalizations and mortality (National Notifiable Diseases\nSurveillance System, CDC, unpublished data, 2011).\n\nCurrently, 2 clinical trials are being conducted to measure the immune\nresponse of infants receiving DTaP immunization at ages 2, 4, and 6\nmonths whose mothers received Tdap during the 3rd trimester of\npregnancy (19,20). These trials also are designed to evaluate safety\nand immunogenicity of Tdap during pregnancy, but are not sufficiently\npowered to assess disease endpoints. Analysis of interim data from one\ntrial (19, unpublished data) measured infant antibody to pertussis\nantigens in a blinded fashion for 2 groups: infants whose mothers\nreceived Tdap and infants whose mothers received Td. The 1st group had\nelevated antipertussis antibody levels compared with the 2nd at birth\nand before dose 1, which might be the result of passive antibody\ntransfer, but had lower antipertussis antibody levels after dose 3. In\nboth groups, antipertussis antibody levels were comparable before\ndoses 2 and 3. Although the 1st group had lower antipertussis antibody\nlevels after dose 3, the evidence of sufficient immune response to\nDTaP doses compared with the 2nd group was reassuring. ACIP concluded\nthat the interim data are consistent with previously published\nliterature suggesting a short duration of blunting of the infant\nresponse, and that the potential benefit of protection from maternal\nantibodies in newborn infants outweighs the potential risk for\nshifting disease burden to later in infancy.\n\nCocooning\n---------\nCocooning is defined as the strategy of vaccinating pregnant women\nimmediately postpartum and all other close contacts of infants aged\nless than 12 months with Tdap to reduce the risk for transmission of\npertussis to infants. Cocooning has been recommended by ACIP since\n2005. Cocooning programs have achieved moderate postpartum coverage\namong mothers but have had limited success in vaccinating fathers or\nother family members (3) (CDC, unpublished data, 2011). Programmatic\nchallenges make implementation of cocooning programs complex and also\nimpede program expansion and sustainability (2). The effectiveness of\nvaccinating postpartum mothers and close contacts to protect infants\nfrom pertussis is not yet known, but the delay in antibody response\namong those vaccinated with Tdap after an infant's birth might result\nin insufficient protection to infants during the 1st weeks of life\n(21). ACIP concluded that cocooning alone is an insufficient strategy\nto prevent pertussis morbidity and mortality in newborn infants.\nRegardless, ACIP concluded that cocooning likely provides indirect\nprotection to infants and firmly supports vaccination with Tdap for\nunvaccinated persons who anticipate close contact with an infant.\n\nDecision and Cost Effectiveness Analysis\n----------------------------------------\nA decision analysis and cost effectiveness model was developed to\nassess the impact and cost effectiveness of maternal Tdap vaccination\nduring pregnancy compared with immediately postpartum. The model\nshowed that Tdap vaccination during pregnancy would prevent more\ninfant cases, hospitalizations, and deaths compared with the\npostpartum dose for 2 reasons: 1) vaccination during pregnancy\nbenefits the mother and infant by providing earlier protection to the\nmother, thereby protecting the infant at birth; and 2) vaccination\nduring late pregnancy maximizes transfer of maternal antibodies to the\ninfant, likely providing direct protection to the infant for a period\nafter birth. Model results were most sensitive to efficacy of maternal\nantibodies and risk for disease as a result of blunting; however, a\nsensitivity analysis in which infants were assumed to have as little\nas 20 percent efficacy of maternal antibodies and a 60 percent\nincrease in risk for disease as a result of blunting found that\nmaternal vaccination during pregnancy was more cost effective and\nprevented a greater proportion of infant cases and deaths than\npostpartum maternal vaccination (22).\n\nGuidance for Use\n----------------\nMaternal vaccination. ACIP recommends that women's health-care\npersonnel implement a Tdap vaccination program for pregnant women who\npreviously have not received Tdap. Health-care personnel should\nadminister Tdap during pregnancy, preferably during the 3rd or late\n2nd trimester (after 20 weeks' gestation). If not administered during\npregnancy, Tdap should be administered immediately postpartum.\n\nCocooning. ACIP recommends that adolescents and adults (e.g., parents,\nsiblings, grandparents, child-care providers, and health-care\npersonnel) who have or anticipate having close contact with an infant\naged less than 12 months should receive a single dose of Tdap to\nprotect against pertussis if they have not previously received Tdap.\nIdeally, these adolescents and adults should receive Tdap at least 2\nweeks before beginning close contact with the infant.\n\nSpecial Situations\n------------------\nPregnant women due for tetanus booster. If a tetanus and diphtheria\nbooster vaccination is indicated during pregnancy for a woman who has\npreviously not received Tdap (i.e., more than 10 years since previous\nTd), then Tdap should be administered during pregnancy, preferably\nduring the 3rd or late 2nd trimester (after 20 weeks' gestation).\n\nWound management for pregnant women. As part of standard wound\nmanagement care to prevent tetanus, a tetanus toxoid-containing\nvaccine might be recommended for wound management in a pregnant woman\nif 5 years or more have elapsed since last receiving Td. If a tetanus\nbooster is indicated for a pregnant woman who previously has not\nreceived Tdap, Tdap should be administered.\n\nPregnant women with unknown or incomplete tetanus vaccination. To\nensure protection against maternal and neonatal tetanus, pregnant\nwomen who have never been vaccinated against tetanus should receive 3\nvaccinations containing tetanus and reduced diphtheria toxoids. The\nrecommended schedule is 0, 4 weeks, and 6 to 12 months. Tdap should\nreplace 1 dose of Td, preferably during the 3rd or late 2nd trimester\n(after 20 weeks' gestation) of pregnancy.\n\nReferences\n----------\n1. CDC.

The effectiveness of\nvaccinating postpartum mothers and close contacts to protect infants\nfrom pertussis is not yet known, but the delay in antibody response\namong those vaccinated with Tdap after an infant's birth might result\nin insufficient protection to infants during the 1st weeks of life\n(21). pregnancy\nbenefits the mother and infant by providing earlier protection to the\nmother, thereby protecting the infant at birth; and 2) vaccination\nduring late pregnancy maximizes transfer of maternal antibodies to the\ninfant, likely providing direct protection to the infant for a period\nafter birth. The benefit would be to reduce the risk for disease and\ndeath in infants aged less than 3 months, but the trade-off might be\nto increase the occurrence of pertussis in older infants; however,\nthis group experiences a substantially lower burden of\nhospitalizations and mortality (National Notifiable Diseases\nSurveillance System, CDC, unpublished data, 2011). ACIP recommends that adolescents and adults (e.g., parents,\nsiblings, grandparents, child-care providers, and health-care\npersonnel) who have or anticipate having close contact with an infant\naged less than 12 months should receive a single dose of Tdap to\nprotect against pertussis if they have not previously received Tdap.\n ACIP concluded\nthat the interim data are consistent with previously published\nliterature suggesting a short duration of blunting of the infant\nresponse, and that the potential benefit of protection from maternal\nantibodies in newborn infants outweighs the potential risk for\nshifting disease burden to later in infancy.

Since 2005, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP)\nhas recommended tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid and\nacellular pertussis (Tdap) booster vaccines to unvaccinated postpartum\nmothers and other family members of newborn infants to protect infants\nfrom pertussis, a strategy referred to as cocooning (1). Circulating\nmaternal pertussis antibodies might reduce an infant's risk for\npertussis in the 1st few months of life but slightly increase risk for\ndisease because of a blunted immune response after receipt of primary\nDTaP doses. The majority of pertussis cases,\nhospitalizations, and deaths occur in infants aged 2 months or\nyounger, who are too young to be vaccinated; therefore, other\nstrategies are required for prevention of pertussis in this age\ngroup. If a tetanus and diphtheria\nbooster vaccination is indicated during pregnancy for a woman who has\npreviously not received Tdap (i.e., more than 10 years since previous\nTd), then Tdap should be administered during pregnancy, preferably\nduring the 3rd or late 2nd trimester (after 20 weeks' gestation). ACIP concluded that available data from these\nstudies did not suggest any elevated frequency or unusual patterns of\nadverse events in pregnant women who received Tdap and that the few\nserious adverse events reported were unlikely to have been caused by\nthe vaccine.

Several studies provide evidence\nsupporting the existence of efficient transplacental transfer of\npertussis antibodies (7,11,12). Although the 1st group had lower antipertussis antibody\nlevels after dose 3, the evidence of sufficient immune response to\nDTaP doses compared with the 2nd group was reassuring. Cocooning programs have achieved moderate postpartum coverage\namong mothers but have had limited success in vaccinating fathers or\nother family members (3) (CDC, unpublished data, 2011). If a tetanus\nbooster is indicated for a pregnant woman who previously has not\nreceived Tdap, Tdap should be administered. After fits of many\ncoughs, someone with pertussis often needs to take deep breathes which\nresult in a 'whooping' sound.

Indeed, all 5\nisolates initially identified at the Ontario Central Public Health\nLaboratory grew on Regan-Lowe charcoal agar with 20 ug/ml cephalexin,\nand we have been able to grow all 6 isolates (a 6th isolate was\nforwarded to us for reference identification) in the presence of up\nto 40 ug/ml cephalexin. As such, our experience differs from that\ndescribed in Massachusetts (reference: Mazengia E, et al, J Clin\nMicro 2000; 38(6): 2330-3).\n\nThe Moderator notes that Toronto has seen a marked increase in\npertussis rates since 2005, though the fact that most cases are IS481\nPCR-positive but culture negative, and clinically quite mild (no\npertussis-related hospitalizations noted at the region's major\nchildren's hospital) suggests that increased sensitivity of\nlaboratory methods may have led to the identification of individuals\nwith relatively mild infection and low organism burden. Nonetheless,\nof 1340 specimens that tested positive for pertussis between January\n2005 and March 2007, 104 (7.8 percent) were culture positive for _B.\npertussis_. In contrast, only 5 _B. holmesii_ isolates were\nidentified during the same period. As such, we think it unlikely that\n_B. holmesii_ is a major contributor to increased local pertussis\nrates. We recently presented a laboratory-based assessment of\npertussis epidemiology in the Greater Toronto Area at the meeting of\nthe Pediatric Academic Societies meeting; the abstract can be accessed at\n<http://www.pas-meeting.org/2007Toronto/Abstracts/LB%20Sessions%2007.pdf>.\n--\nDavid N.

David Fisman and Frances Jamieson report:\n'Between January and May 2007, the Ontario Central Public Health\nLaboratory (CPHL) has identified 5 isolates of _Bordetella holmesii_\nin individuals being tested for pertussis. An additional isolate had\nbeen identified in August 2005. The CPHL performs parallel culture\nand real-time PCR [polymerase chain reaction] (using the IS481\ntarget) on all specimens submitted for pertussis testing, and also\nserves as a reference laboratory for regional public health\nlaboratories. Colonies suspicious for _Bordetella_ spp. are\nsubcultured for purity, and then definitively identified through\ndirect fluorescent antibody (DFA) and serum agglutination (for _B.\npertussis_ and _B. parapertussis_). Isolates that do not react with\nDFA and agglutination reagents are identified by cellular fatty acid\n(CFA) analysis (Sherlock, MIDI Inc, Newark, DE), and biochemical\nprofile. Isolates are also tested by real-time PCR for the presence\nof IS481 and IS1001.\nOf 6 isolates, 5 were from individuals in the Greater Toronto Area\n(GTA), Canada's largest metropolitan area with a population of\napproximately 5.5 million people in 2006. The 6th isolate was from an\nindividual in the a health region approximately 70 miles (about 113\nkm) northwest of Toronto. In addition to being culture-positive and\nphenotypically identified as _B. holmesii_, 4 nasopharyngeal swab\nspecimens tested positive by PCR for IS481. PCR using the IS481\ntarget will detect _B. holmesii_, as this organism also contains the\nIS481 insertion sequence.\nThere were 3 male and 3 female source patients. All were adolescents\n(age range 11 to 17) at the time of presentation. As such, this group\nmay have received primary vaccination against pertussis with a whole\ncell vaccine that is believed to have been poorly immunogenic. Most\npertussis test specimens received by the laboratory are obtained from\nsource patients under 10 years; for example, from January 2005 to the\npresent the lab received 4008 pertussis specimens from children under\n10, and only 615 for those aged 10 to 19. The P-value for all 6 _B.\nholmesii_ isolates having come from the latter group is smaller than\n0.001, and the lower bound confidence limit for the relative risk is\n7.2 (the RR itself is undefined, as no isolates came from children under 10).\nPrimary care providers who submitted the specimens were contacted.\nAll 6 individuals presented with cough illness. Duration of cough\nprior to presentation was 3 days to 2 weeks. Cough was described as\n'slightly productive' or 'wet' in 2 individuals, and dry in others.\nFour individuals had a history of paroxysmal cough or coughing 'until\nchest was sore'. No post-tussive vomiting, no whoop, and no fever\nwere reported in any of the 6. All 6 are reported to have had normal\nphysical examinations; 2 individuals had chest radiographs, both of\nwhich were normal. It was volunteered that 2 of the cases (both in\nthe GTA) had history of 'pertussis exposure' (at school or summer\ncamp). Macrolide therapy was given to 5 of the 6 (3 received\nclarithromycin; 2 received azithromycin).\nIt is possible that _B. holmesii_ is a true cause of pertussis-like\nillness, and interestingly, the link between B. holmesii and teens\nhas been seen in Massachusetts as well. A dispatch in Emerging\nInfectious Diseases described this microorganism as being isolated\nprimarily from adolescents with cough (see\n<http://www.cdc.gov/Ncidod/eid/vol5no3/yih.htm>).\n_B. holmesii_ has also caused bacteremia in asplenic individuals (see\nShepard CW et al., Clin Infect Dis 2004; 38: 799-804).\nOur identification of this microorganism has been possible due to our\nlaboratory's ongoing performance of both PCR and culture on submitted\nspecimens. We would be very interested in 'comparing notes' with\ncolleagues in other jurisdictions in terms of their experience with\nthis microorganism, and their thoughts related to whether or not _B.\nholmesii_ is a true pathogen. We thank ProMED-mail in advance for\nconsideration of posting this description, and we hope that this\nstimulates discussion on ProMED-mail.

And, just as for the toddler, initial\ntesting confirmed they carried the bacterium.\nBut now, more than 3 months after the child fell ill, disease\ninvestigators are no longer certain that the respiratory illnesses\nthat struck workers and another patient at Children's Hospital were\ncaused by whooping cough, also known as pertussis. Additional\ntesting, using approaches different from the 1st round, could find\nlittle evidence of the highly contagious germ.\nStill, no one can say for sure what made the workers sick -- they all\nrecovered -- and disease specialists can't definitively rule out\npertussis as the cause.\nThe cluster of illnesses is proving so intriguing that federal\ndisease sleuths and even a lab in Canada have joined specialists from\nBoston and the state who are trying to crack the mystery.\nThe episode at Children's Hospital is a cautionary tale about the\nlimits of science, particularly the ability of laboratories to\nproduce absolute, unimpeachable results when disease strikes.\n'People think laboratory tests are 100 percent accurate: If they're\npositive, they're positive; if they're negative, they're negative,'\nsaid David Warshauer, a top official at the Wisconsin State\nLaboratory of Hygiene, which oversaw testing during a pertussis\noutbreak in 2003 and 2004 that spawned more than 5000 cases. 'But\nthat's not the case with any laboratory test. And when you're looking\nfor an infectious agent like pertussis, there's a lot of variables.'\nThe mystery began 18 Sep 2006, when a toddler came down with symptoms\nof whooping cough, typically heralded by a runny nose, sneezing,\nslight fever, and mild cough. The disease can develop far more severe\nmanifestations, most notably spasmodic coughing that can last for\nmonths, and be ferocious enough to shatter ribs.\nWhile symptoms can provide strong clues about whether a patient has\nthe disease, laboratory tests provide far more robust proof,\nespecially for pertussis, with early symptoms similar to the common\ncold. To collect a specimen for testing, a cotton swab-like probe is\nthreaded through the nose and into the back of the throat\n[nasopharyngeal culture. - Mod.LL]. 'People generally don't like it\nmuch when you do that,' said Dr. Alfred DeMaria, director of\ncommunicable disease control for the state. 'But you can't get to\nthat area through the mouth.'\nThe sample is then used 2 ways. One is a laboratory classic called\nculturing: Material from the patient is placed in a dish with a\ngrowth medium that will allow the bacterium to reproduce if it's\npresent. The other approach is more modern: polymerase chain\nreaction, or PCR, involves looking for the genetic fingerprint of the\ndisease. PCR has emerged in the past decade as a favorite testing\ntechnology in state labs across the nation, including the\nMassachusetts State Laboratory Institute in Jamaica Plain, in large\npart because it's easier and faster than culturing. It was that lab\nthat tested most of the samples collected from Children's Hospital,\ninitially using PCR. There were hundreds of tests performed, and 38\n-- 2 patients and 36 healthcare workers -- came back positive for pertussis.\n'Children's [Hospital], much like the local health department, really\nrelies on laboratory tests to guide us on what the diagnosis is,\nespecially illnesses that can look like a lot of different things,'\nsaid Dr. Anita Barry, top disease tracker at the Boston Public Health\nCommission. 'Having accurate test results early on, particularly when\nthey're consistent with the clinical symptoms, really launches us\ninto control steps.' And that is what happened at Children's\nHospital, with measures designed to hem in the bacterium and prevent\nit from colonizing more victims.\n'You think you know what's going on,' said Dr. Manisha Patel, a\ndisease investigator at the CDC, 'and you want to make sure it\ndoesn't spread to the most vulnerable patients in the hospital.' But\neven as those steps appeared to be reining in the outbreak, something\ncurious began happening at the state lab.\nSpecialists rarely rely on a single testing method to confirm a\ndiagnosis if multiple methods exist. So state lab workers, in\naddition to performing PCR testing, proceeded with the laborious task\nof culturing samples. They also tested blood samples from the\nhospital workers. The results of those additional tests: They were\nalmost uniformly negative for pertussis, DeMaria said.\n'What was going through my head at the time was what might explain\nthis?' Barry said. 'Is there some type of problem with one of the\ntests? Could it be something closely related to pertussis?'\nSamples were sent to the CDC in the quest for answers. Researchers in\nAtlanta performed a more elaborate, 2-tier PCR test. 'The results\nwere inconclusive,' said Dr. Amanda Cohn, a medical epidemiologist\nfor the federal agency.\nIt turned out that one part of the PCR test suggested the presence of\nthe pertussis bacterium, while the other part didn't. The state lab,\nwhich initially performed just one phase of the PCR test, decided to\nconduct the 2nd phase and, like the federal lab, came back with\nnegative results on that 2nd phase.\n'One of our group's highest priorities at [CDC] is working out better\nlaboratory diagnostics for pertussis,' Cohn said. 'The laboratory\ndiagnostics for pertussis are difficult. It's a priority for us to\nfind reliable, rapid, standardized testing for pertussis.'\nThe federal agency and Massachusetts health authorities continue to\nwork with Children's Hospital to ascertain what made the 36 adults\nand 2 children ill. There are competing theories, ranging from a cold\nvirus to a bacterial relative of pertussis to the virus that causes\nthe condition commonly known as walking pneumonia. It's unlikely that\nthe causes of all the respiratory illnesses will ever be fully known.\n'What I can say is that whatever it was, it went away,' Barry said.\n'And that's the good news.'\n[Byline: Stephen Smith]\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[Polymerase chain reaction relies on amplification of a specific DNA\nsegment analogous to a primer used to anneal it to.

Those workers were sent home until they can finish\na 5-day course of the antibiotic azithromycin, said Dr. Thomas\nSandora, an epidemiologist at Children's.\nLetters have been sent to the parents of about 1000 patients who may\nhave come into contact with potentially infectious staff members,\nproviding information about the disease and directions on what to do\nif symptoms appear, Sandora said.\n'Many of those patients probably weren't exposed, but we're taking a\nvery cautious approach,' Sandora said.\nIt appeared last night that Children's did not follow the law in\nalerting local health authorities about the outbreak, which began in\nSeptember 2006, in a timely fashion. State law requires that\nsuspected cases of many infectious diseases, including whooping\ncough, be reported to the local board of health within 24 hours of\nbeing identified, a measure designed to contain dangerous outbreaks.\nHospital and city investigators said they believe the outbreak began\nafter a 19-month-old boy was admitted to the hospital 21 Sep 2006\nwith a fever, cough, and wheezing. Initially, the child was\ndiagnosed with a disease called respiratory syncytial virus, but\nbecause of worsening symptoms, he was sent to intensive care and\nsubsequently diagnosed with whooping cough, also known as\npertussis. From that case, the outbreak radiated outward, infecting\nnurses, clinical assistants, and administrative staff members,\nSandora said. The toddler has recovered and none of the hospital\nworkers became seriously ill, he added.\nAt St. Vincent Hospital in Worcester (MA), an outbreak in September\n2006 infected 30 staff members. Officials said they believe a\ngastrointestinal surgeon who is a military reservist contracted the\ndisease while on duty and unknowingly carried it into the hospital.\nDr. Katrina Kretsinger, medical epidemiologist at the CDC, said one\nCanadian study had shown that healthcare workers are 1.7 times more\nlikely than the general public to suffer from whooping cough, an\nincrease attributed to their contact with infected\npatients. Hospital-based outbreaks, she said, 'are fairly common,\nand they're quite disruptive when they do occur because of the risk\nof transmitting pertussis to vulnerable patients in the hospital.'\nWhooping cough is a highly infectious bacterial disease transmitted\nby coughing and sneezing. Typically, the disease arrives with\nsymptoms similar to those of the common cold. 'But then,' Barry said,\n'patients move into the coughing phase, with spasms of coughing.'\nAt its worst, a rattling, rib-cracking cough can linger for months\nand cause patients to lose sleep and weight. Studies have shown that\n62 percent of adults with pertussis are still coughing 3 months after\nsymptoms appear.\nWhile symptoms can be persistent, the disease rarely kills adults.\nBut it can be deadly in children under 6 months for 2 pivotal\nreasons: they have yet to receive a full course of vaccines against\nthe disease, and their immature immune systems may not be sufficient\nto respond to the infection.\nThe number of infants dying from the disease, while still small, has\nbeen increasing in recent years, Kretsinger said, with 54 deaths\nbetween 1980 and 1989, but 92 deaths in the first half of this decade.\nChildren today routinely get a series of 5 vaccinations against\npertussis. The vaccine's effectiveness wanes within 5-10 years,\nleaving recipients vulnerable to infection. In 2005, US health\nregulators approved the 1st pertussis booster shot for adults and\nadolescents, a lower dose than what is given to infants and, thus,\nless likely to cause adverse effects.\n'If we could just get that shot into everybody, we wouldn't be having\nthese problems,' said Dr. Alfred DeMaria, the state's director of\ncommunicable disease control.\n[Byline: Stephen Smith]\n--\nBrent Barrett\nMicrobiologist\nIndianapolis, IN\n<salbrent@sbcglobal.net>\n[The most recent CDC statement regarding adult immunization (CDC:\nRecommended Adult Immunization Schedule --- United States, October\n2006--September 2007 MMWR 2006;55; Q1-Q4)\n<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5540-Immunizationa1.htm>\nstates this about the tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis vaccine in adults:\n'Adults with uncertain histories of a complete primary\nvaccination series with diphtheria and tetanus toxoid-containing\nvaccines should begin or complete a primary vaccination series.

There were 172 cases that year -- 8 more in 12 months than\nToronto has logged in 3 months this winter.\nMost of those diagnosed have been children under the age of 4, making\nthe mini-epidemic a tough challenge for city daycares. 'Dealing with\nthis has been a full-time job since we got back from the holidays,'\nsaid preschool supervisor Georgia Bowen. The supervisor at the\nCreative Preschool of East Toronto on St. Matthews Road said that in\nher 27 years in the daycare business, she had never seen an outbreak\nof whooping cough like the one that has torn through her Riverdale\npreschool this winter.\nSince Dec 2005, 9 children have tested positive for the respiratory\nillness; as of 25 Jan 2006 all 104 of her tiny charges were either on\nantibiotics to prevent the spread of the disease or, if their parents\nobjected to that, barred from the preschool for 21 days.\nMiriam Mifshud of Ms. Miriam's Nursery School and Play Centre on\nDanforth Avenue also said she was 'absolutely stunned' by the 7 cases\ndiagnosed at her daycare this winter. 'In 3 or 4 decades of\nteaching, I just haven't seen this,' she said. At both Creative\nPreschool and Ms. Miriam's, every child had been vaccinated.\nDr. Shahin said it is difficult to pinpoint what caused the unusual\nspike in pertussis, commonly called the whooping cough because of the\nhigh-pitched wheezing noise sufferers make at the end of its\ncharacteristic prolonged coughing fits.\n'A lot of the infectious diseases tend to peak certain years and then\ngo back down again, and we don't really know what the cause is,' said\nDr. Shahin. 'Sometimes it may be that the vaccine might be a little\nless effective.'\nDr. Shahin said the public health authority is reviewing all 164\ncases to determine if all those afflicted had received the full 5\ndoses of the whooping cough vaccine, 4 of which should be given\nbefore a child is 18 months old. 'Maybe some of them weren't\nimmunized completely,' Dr. Shahin said. The outbreak appears to be\nlimited to Toronto.\n'We're aware of the Toronto outbreak, but we haven't heard of any\nothers elsewhere in Canada,' said Michael Tansey, a spokesman for the\nPublic Health Agency of Canada.\nOf the 164 Torontonians diagnosed in the past 3 months, 44 were\nchildren younger than 1, 90 were children between the ages of 1 and\n4, and the rest were older than 4. While cases have popped up all\nover the city, there is a large concentration in its eastern and\nsouthern portions.\nMost of the children infected in Toronto have displayed only mild\nsymptoms akin to a cough or cold, Dr. Shahin said. Still, for\naffected parents, the outbreak has caused concern and headaches.\n[Byline: Kelly Patrick]\n--\nNita Madhav, MSPH\nResearch Analyst\nAIR Worldwide\nBoston, MA, USA\n<nmadhav@alum.emory.edu>\n[The reason for this impressive cluster of cases of pertussis in\nOntario is as yet unclear, but at least some of the cases occurred in\nfully immunized children.

The\nvaccine will be marketed as Adacel by Aventis Pasteur Limited located in\nToronto, Canada. It is the 1st vaccine approved as a pertussis booster for\nadults. Vaccines for prevention of tetanus and diphtheria (Td vaccine) in\nadolescents and adults have been available for many years.\nThe vaccine is a Tetanus Toxoid (T), Reduced Diphtheria Toxoid (d) and\nAcellular Pertussis Vaccine (ap), Adsorbed. It contains the same components\nas DTaP vaccine indicated for infants and children, but the diphtheria\ntoxoid and one of the pertussis components are in reduced quantities.\nRecently, FDA approved a similar vaccine called Boostrix, manufactured by\nGlaxoSmithKline, for use in adolescents 10-18 years of age.\nPertussis is a highly communicable and potentially serious illness in\nadolescents and adults, and can cause prolonged cough and missed days at\nschool and work. In young infants, pertussis is more frequently severe and\ncan be fatal, particularly in those too young to be fully vaccinated. Since\n1980, the rates of reported pertussis cases have been increasing in\nadolescents and adults, as well as in young infants. Adolescents and\nadults have been implicated as the source of pertussis infection for\nsusceptible young infants, and other family members.\nThe ability of this vaccine to protect against pertussis was assessed by\ncomparing the antibody responses of adolescents and adults who received it\nwith the antibody responses of infants who had received the pediatric\nvaccine in a clinical trial. The antibody responses of the adolescents and\nadults who received a single dose of this vaccine were at least as good as\nthose observed in the infants following 3 doses of the pediatric vaccine.\nFor diphtheria and tetanus, the antibody responses following this vaccine\nwere comparable to those following immunization with a USA-licensed Td vaccine.\nIn clinical trials, the safety of this vaccine was compared to a\nUSA-licensed Td vaccine. Among adolescent recipients of this vaccine,\ninjection site pain and low-grade fever were observed more frequently than\namong those who received Td vaccine. Rates of adverse reactions were\nsimilar in adults receiving this vaccine or receiving Td vaccine.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n******\n[2]\nDate: Sun, Jun 12, 2005\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: Utica Observer-Dispatch [edited]\n<http://www.uticaod.com/archive/2005/06/12/news/30899.html>\n\nWhooping cough worries\n----------------------\nWith 8 cases of whooping cough diagnosed in Oneida County [NY] schools,\nparents are learning 1st-hand that immunizations against the disease may\nnot be enough to prevent onset of the illness.

The vaccine will be marketed as Boostrix by\nGlaxoSmithKline (GSK) in Philadelphia, PA.\nPertussis is a highly communicable disease of the respiratory tract that\ncan be especially serious for infants under 1 year old, and may even be\nfatal. Pertussis can cause spells of coughing and choking that make\nbreathing difficult. The disease is generally less severe in adolescents,\nbut it is thought that they might transmit the disease to susceptible\ninfants and other family members. In the last 20 years, rates of pertussis\ninfection have been increasing in very young infants who have not received\nall their immunizations and in adolescents and adults.\nBoostrix is a tetanus toxoid (T), reduced diphtheria toxoid (d) and\nacellular pertussis vaccine (ap), adsorbed. Although booster vaccines for\nadolescents containing T and d are currently licensed and marketed for use\nin this age group, none contains a pertussis component. Boostrix has the\nsame components as Infanrix, a DTaP vaccine for infants and young children,\nbut in reduced quantities. Boostrix is indicated for use as a single\nbooster dose to adolescents 10-18 years of age.\nThe efficacy of the vaccine was measured by looking at the immune response\nto the vaccine, as measured by antibody concentrations. The response to the\nT and d components was at least as good as the response to a licensed Td\nvaccine. Boostrix also induced an antibody response to the pertussis\ncomponent of the vaccine. The response to the pertussis component was\ncompared to the response induced by a 3-dose series of Infanrix given to\ninfants in a previous study. The response of adolescents to Boostrix was\nconsidered adequate. It is not known how long immunity to pertussis will\nlast. Adolescents who received Boostrix experienced pain, redness, and\nswelling at the injection site. The frequency of redness and swelling after\nBoostrix was similar to what is expected following the administration of a\nTd vaccine. However, pain reactions at the injection site were more\nfrequent with those who received Boostrix. Other side effects included\nheadaches, fever and fatigue for a short period of time after the injection.\n******\n[2]\nDate: Wed, 10 May 2005\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: Channel 36 Austin, TX [edited]\n<http://www.kxan.com/Global/story.asp?S=3327321&nav=0s3dZhYd>\n\nWhooping cough cases increasing\n-------------------------------\nThere have been 58 confirmed cases of whooping cough in Travis County\nschools in 2005. 100 more are suspected.

Central Lee superintendent Chuck Reighard said the school has responded to\nthe outbreak by determining who had close contact with the infected student\nand then making contact with the families of those who may have been\nexposed to urge seeking treatment with the family doctor. Reighard said\nthat now that the Lee County Health Department has become involved, the\nschool will determine close contacts, and the health department will take\non the role of contacting families. In 2004, we had 300 cases\nreported in to us in the whole year, and we've already had more than 50\npercent of that number reported to us, just in the last 6 weeks,' Dr Adolfo\n \nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n Source: FDA.gov [edited]\n<http://www.fda.gov/bbs/topics/ANSWERS/2005/ANS01354.html>\n\nCombination vaccine approved to protect adolescents against whooping cough\n As noted above, the Tdap variation is\nnow approved in adolescents and contains lower amounts of both diphtheria\nand pertussis components than the pediatric vaccine. Reighard said the majority of the 16 cases at Central Lee are among\nstudents in the middle school, although he said there have been a few at\nthe elementary and high school levels. The response to the pertussis component was\ncompared to the response induced by a 3-dose series of Infanrix given to\ninfants in a previous study. Although booster vaccines for\nadolescents containing T and d are currently licensed and marketed for use\nin this age group, none contains a pertussis component. Whooping cough looks like a regular cold or influenza in the beginning, but\ngradually gets worse, becoming especially dangerous for children with\nasthma.

The outbreak has been concentrated in children 10 to 15 years old,\nages when immunity from the childhood vaccine wanes. While Chicago has\nconfirmed an increase in whooping cough cases in 2004 compared with\nprevious years, the biggest jump in numbers appears to be happening in\nsuburban Cook and the collar [surrounding - Mod.LL] counties. McHenry\nCounty, for example, averages about 8 cases annually. In 2004, it's already\nup to 143.\nHealth officials couldn't explain what's driving the increase. 'Part of it\nmay be increased surveillance,' said Dr Julie Morita, medical director of\nthe Chicago Department of Public Health's immunization program.\nAlso known as pertussis, whooping cough is a bacterial infection that\nspread easily through coughing or sneezing. It's called whooping cough\nbecause those who get it -- especially children -- sometimes make a\n'whooping' sound when inhaling. The first symptoms usually appear about a\nweek after someone is exposed. They can mimic the symptoms of a cold: runny\nnose, sneezing, a low fever and a mild cough. Whooping cough symptoms can\nprogress, though, to severe coughing fits, particularly at night, and\ncoughing attacks are sometimes followed by vomiting.\nThe potentially fatal disease tends to be most serious in infants and\npeople who have compromised immune systems. The last whooping cough death\nin Illinois was that of a 2 month old baby in 2001.\nEach child should get the pertussis vaccine at 2, 4, 6, and 15 months,\nfollowed by a booster between ages 4 and 6 years, experts say. The vaccine\nisn't recommended for anyone over 7, but a booster shot for older people is\nin development and could be available in a year, said Dr Eric Whitaker,\ndirector of the Illinois Department of Public Health.\nHe urged parents to get their children vaccinated and to practice 'plain\nold good hygiene,' including frequent handwashing and covering your mouth\nand nose while coughing or sneezing. People exposed to someone with\npertussis should see a doctor and begin antibiotic treatment immediately.\n[byline: Lori Rackl]\n******\n[2] New York\nDate: Wed, 22 Sep 2004\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: NY Newsday.com [edited]\n<http://www.newsday.com/news/local/wire/ny-bc-ny--whoopingcough0922sep22,0,6987317.story?coll=ny-ap-regional-wire>\n\nWhooping cough on the rise in New York\n--------------------------------------\nAfter several years under the public health radar, whooping cough is making\na comeback in New York. The number of New Yorkers affected by the highly\ncontagious respiratory illness passed the 1000 mark for the 2nd straight\nyear, prompting health officials to step up efforts to stave off the disease.\nEarlier in 2004, the state Health Department posted a bulletin to community\nhealth departments and health care providers about the recent trend. A\nsimilar alert was sent in Jun 2004 to directors and nurses at summer camps,\nwhere whooping cough outbreaks are not uncommon since children live\ntogether in tight quarters and often have direct contact with one another,\nmaking the disease easier to spread.\nNow with the fall school year underway, the focus is shifting to school\nnurses and teachers to be on the alert. New York is among 7 states that\ncurrently do not require school-age children to be vaccinated against\nwhooping cough, although most received the shot as infants as part of a\ncombination vaccine. Starting in 2005, babies born after 1 Jan would be\nrequired to be vaccinated against whooping cough before they enter school\nor day care, under a new law.\n'We are taking some unusual and strong measures here to try to deal with\nthis problem,' said Dr Gus Birkhead, the director of the Center for\nCommunity Health at the state Health Department. So far in 2004, there were\n1448 confirmed cases of whooping cough, up from 388 in 2000. The average is\n300 cases annually.\nHealth experts say a number of factors may be responsible for the spike in\nwhooping cough cases in recent years, a trend that is mirrored nationwide,\nalthough they have been unable to pinpoint an exact cause. In 2003, 229\npeople, in the newborn to age 14 category, were hospitalized with\npertussis. Hospitalization data for 2004 were incomplete.\n'Public health officials are somewhat exasperated by not being able to get\nthis quickly under control,' said Dr Lloyd Novick, the commissioner of the\nOnondaga County Health Department in central New York, whose county is\nconsidered a whooping cough hotspot. Onondaga County, which includes the\ncity of Syracuse, normally has 10 cases of pertussis annually. So far this\nyear, the county is leading the state with the highest number of cases at\n128, according to state Health Department figures.\nHistorically, the incidence of whooping cough has fluctuated, peaking every\n3 to 5 years, and health officials say it's possible that the past 2 years\nare part of the natural peak cycle. Health officials also point out there's\nincreased awareness in the medical community and doctors now have more\nadvanced technology to detect the disease than in previous years.\nThe federal government is debating whether it should allow booster shots\nagainst the cough, since protection begins to drop 5 to 10 years after the\nlast shot.\n[byline: Alicia Chang]\n******\n[3] Kansas\nDate: Thu, 23 Sep 2004\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org> Source: Johnson County Sun [edited]\n<http://www.zwire.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=12984252&BRD=1459&PAG=461>\n\nWhooping cough is cyclical in Kansas\n------------------------------------\nThe upsurge in whooping cough or pertussis cases in Kansas in 2004,\nparticularly in the northeast part of the state, may be cyclical, said\nSharon Watson, spokeswoman for the Kansas Department of Health and Environment.\nThe department said that, from May through Sep 2004, there were 31\nconfirmed cases reported in the state, compared with an average of 9 cases\nin the previous 3 years for the same months.\nIn Johnson County, there have been 8 confirmed cases since 1 May 2004.

Erythromycin has well-established side effects, and so its\nuse should be limited to situations in which it is likely to be of greatest\nbenefit.\nIf a clinically suspected or confirmed case of pertussis is identified who\nis also in household contact with someone at greatest risk from pertussis\n-- young infants, especially neonates -- then erythromycin chemoprophylaxis\nshould be considered. The aim is to protect those at greatest risk from\npertussis by offering chemoprophylaxis to them, to all their household\ncontacts who are unimmunized, and to contacts who are 5 years or older if\nthey did not receive a preschool pertussis booster (not given to those born\nbefore 1996 in the United Kingdom).

The state Department of Health and Environmental Control (DHEC)\nsaid on Tuesday that there are 15 more probable cases of whooping cough, or\npertussis. Over 300 people who have come in close contact with the patients\nhave begun taking antibiotics as a preventive measure.\nThose 300 people include school and day care workers as well as household\nmembers who have come in contact with a coughing patient, said Dr Robert\nBall, an infectious disease consultant and epidemiologist at DHEC's\nWaccamaw and Trident public health districts. Hugging, kissing, and sharing\ncups, utensils, and food can also spread the highly contagious disease of\nthe respiratory system.\nBall urged parents to make sure children are up-to-date on required\nvaccinations, particularly for whooping cough. 'The patients are in\ntreatment, and there have been no complications,' he said. 'While the\nnumber of actual cases and those under preventive treatment are high, we\nfeel the actions of everyone involved have reduced the chances of more\ninfections and serious illness, especially in the elderly or very young.'\nThose most at risk are children younger than 12 months who may not be\nvaccinated. Shots are recommended at 2, 4, and 6 months and at 12 to 18\nmonths with a booster after age 4 but before entering school. Severe cases\n[may suffer] pneumonia, seizures, brain damage and even death. From 6 to 21\ndays after exposure, patients suffer a runny nose and cough. That may\nprogress to whooping, a coughing spasm that ends in a prolonged,\nhigh-pitched intake of breath.\nWhooping cough is caused by bacteria [_Bordetella pertussis_] found in the\nmouth, nose and throat of an infected person. Ball said it's usual to see\noutbreaks of pertussis throughout the country each year, but it's unclear\nwhere the disease originated this year. The first cases of the outbreak in\nGeorgetown were seen in early May 2003 and continued into July. Related\ncases have been found in Horry, Williamsburg and Charleston counties, but\nGeorgetown has had more than 30 confirmed cases. South Carolina had just 48\npertussis cases in 2002.

That's\nprompting renewed efforts to shed light on the disease and vaccinate\nchildren who are particularly susceptible.\nIn Pierce County, an average of 2.9 people each month were diagnosed\nwith the infectious disease from Nov 1998 through Sep 2002. From Oct\n2002 to May 2003, the monthly average rose to 12.3, according to the\nhealth department. King County has recorded 113 cases of whooping\ncough, compared with 155 in 2002 and 39 in 2001.\nThis year, as many as 600 cases of whooping cough may be reported statewide.\nThat would exceed last year's 575 cases and far outstrip the 184 reported in\n2001. The worst recent year was in 1996, when 830 cases were reported. The\nlowest recent year was in 1993, with fewer than 100 cases.\nPart of the problem, heath officials say, is that parents are not\nhaving their children vaccinated for the disease. Health officials\nrecommend children get four shots before age 2 to build up\nimmunization to whooping cough. Most children get the first 3, but\nthe number drops to about 80 percent for the fourth shot, said Cindy\nGleason, a health educator with the state Department of Health\nimmunization program.\n'The real danger with pertussis is that it tends to be very severe in\nsmall kids, particularly those under 6 months of age,' said Marcia\nPatrick, a registered nurse for MultiCare Health Systems, which\nincludes Mary Bridge, Tacoma General and Allenmore hospitals.\nThough children are most susceptible to whooping cough, health\nofficials note adults can be afflicted as well. Last year, several\nstaff members at Mary Bridge's Children's Hospital and Health Center\nand its sister facility, Tacoma General Hospital, caught pertussis.\nThe hospitals treated nearly 1,000 workers with antibiotics to make\nsure the disease didn't spread to patients.\n[Byline: Sheila B.

The outbreak was recognised on 23 May 2002, the first case\nhaving developed symptoms on 25 Mar 2002.\nThe Head Teacher of the school had first reported concerns that children at\nthe school had whooping cough at the beginning of May, and contacted the\nLeicestershire Health Protection Team again on 15 May 2002. When contacted,\nlocal general practitioners (GPs) reported that they did not think that\nthey were seeing children with pertussis. [Certainly, the diagnosis of\npertussis may be difficult, but earlier diagnosis may have minimized the\noutbreak - Mod.LL] A further report on 22 May 2002 that nearly half of the\npupils were coughing prompted a visit to the school by the Health\nProtection Team on 23 May 2002. At the visit, children were observed to\nhave paroxysmal cough typical of whooping cough.\nThe school is in a small village. It has 86 full-time pupils aged between 5\nand 10 years, 21 part-time pupils aged under 5 years, and 16 teaching and\nother staff members. Children aged 5 and under are taught in a mobile\nclassroom. Other children are taught in 2 classrooms in the main school\nbuilding: children in years one and 2 (aged between 5 and 7) in one\nclassroom and years 3, 4, and 5 (aged between 7 and 10) in the other classroom.\nAfter consultation with the PHLS Communicable Disease Surveillance Centre\nand the Respiratory and Systemic Infection Laboratory at CPHL, initial\naction was agreed that included: (1) information about the outbreak and\npertussis to be sent to parents of all children at the school; (2)\ninformation about the outbreak and whooping cough to be sent to all local\nGP practices with advice on the immediate management of suspected cases;\n(3) a symptom questionnaire to be administered to all children and staff in\nthe school; (4) rapid confirmation of disease to be attempted by obtaining\npernasal swabs for _Bordetella pertussis_ PCR from those with early coryzal\nsymptoms, and blood for serological evidence of recent _B. pertussis_ in\nthose with a 2-week history of typical paroxysmal cough (>100 EU/mL of _B.\npertussis_ IgG is suggestive of recent infection, in the absence of recent\nimmunization).\nA 7-day course of erythromycin was initially offered to all children and\nstaff at the school because so many appeared to have early coryzal\nsymptoms. Chemoprophylaxis with erythromycin was offered to vulnerable\nhousehold contacts of cases. NHS Direct was briefed to enable them to\nhandle enquiries from parents, and pediatricians in local NHS Trusts were\ninformed of the outbreak. An outbreak control team first met on 27 May 2002.\nInformation from the questionnaires suggested a continuing outbreak. The\nfirst child became unwell before the Easter holiday break and returned to\nschool on 8 Apr 2002. A household contact of this child became unwell a\nweek later followed by several more within the next fortnight. The epidemic\ncurve demonstrated the continuing progression of the outbreak. There was a\ntotal of 23 confirmed and probable cases, including 7 members of staff.\nWithin 24 hours of receipt of the samples, 6 cases were microbiologically\nconfirmed by RSIL-CPHL, using culture, PCR, or serology, and 17 were\nprobable cases (cough for more than 2 weeks) including 7 members of staff.\nPupils and staff throughout the school were affected, but most cases were\naged 5 to 7 years. Childhood vaccine uptake in the area is very high, and\nonly 1 child was identified who had not received a primary course of\npertussis vaccine. Few children were young enough to have benefited from\nthe addition of acellular pertussis to the preschool booster in November 2001.\nThe further measures to investigate and control the outbreak were agreed\nare as follows, taking into account factors such as the known widespread\nintolerance to erythromycin: (1) Active case finding by providing\ninformation and raising awareness through primary care, local schools, and\nNHS Direct. (2) Active treatment of suspected cases, including anyone with\ncoryzal symptoms and direct epidemiological links to the outbreak. (3)\nSentinel microbiological surveillance in selected practices in the Vale of\nBelvoir, with pernasal swabs for _B. pertussis_ culture from patients\npresenting with coryzal symptoms and serological testing for pertussis\ntoxin IgG from patients with cough of more than 2 weeks duration. (4)\nStrain typing of _B. pertussis_ isolates obtained to determine whether the\nstrain was similar to other circulating strains. (5) Given the likely\nintolerance to erythromycin among those offered treatment, azithromycin for\n6 days (dosage as per British National Formulary) should be the treatment\nof choice in order to ensure compliance. (6) All children in the school\nwould be offered a DTaP (diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis) booster\ninjection, as would other vulnerable children in the area ie those under\nthe age of 4 months who would not be fully immunized, and other children\nwith immune deficiencies or lung conditions such as cystic fibrosis for\nwhom whooping cough would potentially be a life-threatening illness.\nThe outbreak control team met again on 7 Jun 2002 to review the management\nof the outbreak. It appeared that the outbreak at the school had been\nbrought under control. Active case finding and sentinel surveillance had\nidentified a small number of additional cases in the local community, but\nno evidence consistent with a widespread community outbreak. It was agreed\nthat no further control measures were necessary. A further questionnaire\nwill be administered to parents of all children at the school to document\nthe true extent of the outbreak. The 80 children who had been given an\nadditional DTaP booster were asked to complete symptom diaries that will be\nanalyzed to determine the extent of adverse reactions that can sometimes\noccur when children receive more DT than in the routine schedule (there is\nno available monovalent pertussis vaccine).\nThe strain of _B. pertussis_ has been identified by RSIL-CPHL as serotype\n1,3 and appears similar to other strains circulating in England and Wales.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[The description of the circumstances of this pertussis outbreak\nunderscores how difficult control of this infection can be in a school even\nwith what seems to be adherence to immunization schedules and how important\nearly suspicion and diagnosis remain.

On 14 Aug 2002, a worker aged 39 years reported to the\nplant's health unit with a cough lasting 14 days. On the same day, the\nworker's supervisor aged 50 years visited the health unit for a paroxysmal\ncough of 3 days' duration and an incident of cough syncope. Both patients\nwere referred to private health-care providers; blood samples from both\npatients had serologic test results suggestive of recent _Bordetella\npertussis_ infection, and CCHD was contacted. On 18 Sep 2002 IDPH and CCHD\ninitiated active surveillance and case investigations. This report\nsummarizes the results of that investigation, which found that during 1\nAug-9 Oct 2002 pertussis was diagnosed in 15 (10 percent) of 150 oil\nrefinery workers from 2 separate operations (n=95) and maintenance (n=55)\ncomplexes, who were linked by contact with the ill supervisor. Through\nenhanced case finding, 24 cases of pertussis, 21 (88 percent) of which\noccurred in adults aged >20 years, were identified in this outbreak,\nunderscoring the need to recognize this highly infectious disease in adults\nand to improve national diagnostic and preventive strategies.\nA clinical case was defined as an acute cough illness lasting >2 weeks in a\nperson with 1) at least one of the following: paroxysms of coughing,\ninspiratory 'whoop,' or post-tussive vomiting, without other apparent cause\nor 2) >14 days of cough in a person in an outbreak setting. A confirmed\ncase was defined as a cough illness of any duration in a person with\nisolation by culture of _B. pertussis_ or a case that met the clinical case\ndefinition and was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for _B.\npertussis_ DNA or by epidemiologic linkage to a laboratory-confirmed case.\nA probable case met the clinical case definition, was not\nlaboratory-confirmed, and was not linked by direct contact with a\nlaboratory-confirmed case. At the oil refinery, any worker reporting a\ncough illness to the health unit was referred to the local community\nhospital for evaluation for pertussis and interviewed by CCHD or IDPH staff\nto establish onset of illness, symptoms, area of work and work schedules,\nand information on all close contacts. Community cases were identified\nthrough standard IDPH case report forms submitted by health-care providers\nto CCHD for suspected cases of pertussis and then reviewed by the IDPH\nimmunization section to determine if the case definition was met.\nAs of 13 Dec 2002, a total of 17 cases of pertussis have been associated\nwith the oil refinery: 4 confirmed cases (including one culture-positive\ncase, one PCR-positive case, and 2 epidemiologically linked cases) and 13\nprobable cases; 10 patients were males. A pulsed-field gel electrophoresis\n(PFGE) DNA fingerprint from the _B. pertussis_ isolate from the\nculture-confirmed case (illness onset date: 10 Sep 2002) was PFGE profile\n13. The median age of patients was 40 years (range: 16-53 years). 6\npatients worked in the same work unit. 8 of 14 patients tested by a\nprivate diagnostic laboratory had serologic testing results (anti-_B.\npertussis_ IgA, IgM, or IgG enzyme immunoassay) suggestive of recent _B.\npertussis_ infection. In addition to the 17 patients identified from the\noil refinery, 7 patients in the community who were unrelated\nepidemiologically to the oil refinery also were identified as having\nprobable cases of pertussis; 4 were males with a median age of 24 years\n(range: 5-33 years). All 24 patients received treatment with macrolide\nantibiotics and were encouraged to be tested for pertussis by PCR and\nnasopharyngeal culture. On 19 Sep 2002, with the cooperation of the oil\nrefinery management, 150 close work contacts of the 17 patients at the oil\nrefinery plant were prescribed azithromycin prophylaxis at a dose schedule\nof 500 mg for the first day, followed by 250 mg daily for the next 4 days.\nOther than a meeting lasting approximately 5 minutes conducted indoors each\nmorning, daily work assignments at the plant are performed outdoors.\nHowever, workers may congregate in an indoor dining area reserved for lunch.\nNo cases of pertussis at the oil refinery have been reported since 9 Oct\n2002. School officials and health-care providers within the community have\nbeen given guidelines on pertussis case recognition, reporting, and\nprophylaxis measures. IDPH and the local health department continue to\nperform ongoing case ascertainment.\nEditorial Note:\nAmong the diseases for which universal childhood vaccination is recommended\nin the United States, only pertussis has increased in incidence in the\nUnited States during the preceding 20 years, from 1730 cases in 1980 to\n8296 cases provisionally reported in 2002 (1; CDC, unpublished data, 2002).\nThe outbreak described in this report reflects the changing demographics of\npertussis in the United States, with reported incidence rates in adults\nincreasing 400 percent during 1990-2001 (2; CDC, unpublished data, 2002).\nAdults and adolescents might be a reservoir for _B. pertussis_ in the\ncommunity, because immunity from childhood vaccination declines beginning\n5-15 years after the last pertussis vaccine dose (3). Despite increasing\nrecognition of pertussis as a disease affecting older children and adults,\npertussis often is overlooked in the differential diagnosis of cough\nillness in this population (4). Pertussis can be highly infectious during\nthe 3 weeks after illness onset, and infection can spread to exposed\ninfants, who have the highest rates for complications and death (5). In\nthis outbreak, pertussis was not considered initially in the index\npatient's 14-day cough illness until the patient's supervisor reported to\nthe oil refinery health unit concurrently with cough syncope, triggering\nreferral of both patients to the local community hospital for evaluation\nfor pertussis. Emblematic in this outbreak was the protracted duration of\ncough symptoms in the first patient, followed by a comprehensive public\nhealth response once several close contacts became infected and, late in\nthe outbreak, _B. pertussis_ was cultured successfully from an oil refinery\nworker; isolation of _B. pertussis_ from an adult is uncommon.\nIn Illinois, 46 of 191 cases (24 percent) of reported pertussis in 2001\noccurred in adults aged >20 years (incidence rate: 0.5 per 100 000\npopulation), a proportion similar to that of cases in the United States\namong this age group (1). Persons aged 10-19 years comprised 18 percent of\nall cases in 2001 in Illinois. Waning vaccine-induced immunity probably\naccounts for susceptibility to _B. pertussis_ infection in both adults and\nadolescents (3,6). Since the 1980s, the reported incidence rates in\nadolescents and adults in the United States have increased as a result of\nchanges in reporting, a true increase in incidence, or both (1,2). In 1995,\nthe case definition for pertussis was expanded to include PCR-positive\ntests and epidemiologic linking of pertussis cases as confirmation\ncriteria. In addition, a possible increase in awareness of pertussis in\nolder age groups within the medical community during the 1990s might have\ncontributed to increased diagnosis rates in this population (7).\nAdults with pertussis can have mild symptoms and might not seek medical\ncare, and clinicians might not consider pertussis as a cause of illness\n(8). Although the fastidious _B. pertussis_ bacterium often cannot be\nisolated, to confirm diagnosis in symptomatic adults, health-care providers\nshould obtain a nasopharyngeal aspirate or swab for _B. pertussis_ culture\nwithin 2 weeks of cough onset. In this outbreak, serologic testing for\ndiagnosis of recent _B. pertussis_ infection was performed in the majority\nof cases. No serologic assay for a single convalescent sera is currently\napproved or recommended for serodiagnosis of pertussis. Because adults\nmight report to health-care providers late in the disease course, a\nstandardized and valid serologic test is needed to diagnose recent _B.\npertussis_ infection in adults (9).\nAs one of several state health departments with enhanced pertussis\nsurveillance systems, IDPH analyzes _B. pertussis_ isolates from cases by\nPFGE. The single isolate in this outbreak indicated PFGE profile 13, the\nmost frequently identified pattern from _B. pertussis_ isolates in the\nUnited States. Identification of pertussis DNA fingerprints by PFGE might\nallow health officials to track disease transmission and associated outbreaks.\nA 14-day course of erythromycin, a macrolide antibiotic with substantial in\nvitro and in vivo activity against _B. pertussis_, is the recommended\nantimicrobial for treatment of patients with pertussis and for prophylaxis\nof close contacts. Treatment and prophylaxis are most effective when\nerythromycin is administered to patients within 3 weeks of illness onset\nand to close contacts within 3 weeks of cough onset in the primary case\n(9). During an outbreak, repeated exposure to pertussis might warrant\nrepeated courses of erythromycin. If erythromycin is poorly tolerated\nbecause of gastrointestinal side effects, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole can\nbe prescribed; azithromycin and clarithromycin might be effective\nalternatives in the eradication of _B. pertussis_ in symptomatic patients\n(9,10). However, effectiveness of azithromycin or clarithromycin as\nprophylaxis for asymptomatic close contacts in an outbreak setting is not\nwell documented.\nOutbreaks of pertussis in adults are controlled through prompt treatment of\npatients and antimicrobial prophylaxis for close contacts. Acellular\npertussis vaccines are licensed in the United States for infants and\nchildren aged 6 weeks-6 years (i.e., before the seventh birthday). These\nvaccines might have a future role in the prevention of disease and control\nof outbreaks in older age groups (4,5,7).\nReferences\n1. CDC. Pertussis---United States, 1997--2000.

Among the diseases for which universal childhood vaccination is recommended\nin the United States, only pertussis has increased in incidence in the\nUnited States during the preceding 20 years, from 1730 cases in 1980 to\n8296 cases provisionally reported in 2002 (1; CDC, unpublished data, 2002). 8 of 14 patients tested by a\nprivate diagnostic laboratory had serologic testing results (anti-_B.\npertussis_ IgA, IgM, or IgG enzyme immunoassay) suggestive of recent _B.\npertussis_ infection. In 1995,\nthe case definition for pertussis was expanded to include PCR-positive\ntests and epidemiologic linking of pertussis cases as confirmation\ncriteria. Because adults\nmight report to health-care providers late in the disease course, a\nstandardized and valid serologic test is needed to diagnose recent _B.\npertussis_ infection in adults (9). On 19 Sep 2002, with the cooperation of the oil\nrefinery management, 150 close work contacts of the 17 patients at the oil\nrefinery plant were prescribed azithromycin prophylaxis at a dose schedule\nof 500 mg for the first day, followed by 250 mg daily for the next 4 days. On 16 Sep 2002, the Crawford County Health Department (CCHD) reported to\nthe Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH) 4 cases of cough illness\namong workers at an oil refinery (total worker population: 750) in Crawford\nCounty, Illinois. Both patients\nwere referred to private health-care providers; blood samples from both\npatients had serologic test results suggestive of recent _Bordetella\npertussis_ infection, and CCHD was contacted. A pulsed-field gel electrophoresis\n(PFGE) DNA fingerprint from the _B. pertussis_ isolate from the\nculture-confirmed case (illness onset date: 10 Sep 2002) was PFGE profile\n13. Treatment and prophylaxis are most effective when\nerythromycin is administered to patients within 3 weeks of illness onset\nand to close contacts within 3 weeks of cough onset in the primary case\n(9). A clinical case was defined as an acute cough illness lasting >2 weeks in a\nperson with 1) at least one of the following: paroxysms of coughing,\ninspiratory 'whoop,' or post-tussive vomiting, without other apparent cause\nor 2) >14 days of cough in a person in an outbreak setting. [Given the changing epidemiology of pertussis in the USA, one wonders if\nand when the acellular pertussis vaccine, may become part of the\nonce-a-decade routine booster for tetanus-diphtheria (Td) to become TdaP.\n-Mods. \nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n Adults and adolescents might be a reservoir for _B. pertussis_ in the\ncommunity, because immunity from childhood vaccination declines beginning\n5-15 years after the last pertussis vaccine dose (3). Adults with pertussis can have mild symptoms and might not seek medical\ncare, and clinicians might not consider pertussis as a cause of illness\n As one of several state health departments with enhanced pertussis\nsurveillance systems, IDPH analyzes _B. pertussis_ isolates from cases by\nPFGE. The outbreak described in this report reflects the changing demographics of\npertussis in the United States, with reported incidence rates in adults\nincreasing 400 percent during 1990-2001 (2; CDC, unpublished data, 2002). School officials and health-care providers within the community have\nbeen given guidelines on pertussis case recognition, reporting, and\nprophylaxis measures. Pertussis can be highly infectious during\nthe 3 weeks after illness onset, and infection can spread to exposed\ninfants, who have the highest rates for complications and death (5). In this outbreak, serologic testing for\ndiagnosis of recent _B. pertussis_ infection was performed in the majority\nof cases. Changing epidemiology of\npertussis in the United States: increasing reported incidence among\nadolescents and adults, 1990--1996. In addition, a possible increase in awareness of pertussis in\nolder age groups within the medical community during the 1990s might have\ncontributed to increased diagnosis rates in this population (7).

She said\ninformation has been sent home with schoolchildren, and doctors have been\nasked to be on the lookout for symptoms.\nSince January 2001, 9 children in Texas have died of the disease. A total\nof 615 cases were reported in Texas that year, the most since 1968. This\nyear, 766 cases already have been reported.\nThe number of reported cases is unusually high, according to David Bastis,\na program director in the immunization division of the Texas Department of\nHealth. 'Usually we see no deaths or one death,' he said.\n[Byline: Roger Croteau]\n--\nH.Larry Penning\n<hlpenning@yahoo.com>\n[The number of cases and deaths in this continuing outbreak of pertussis is\nquite noteworthy. It would be very informative to know the age and\nimmunization status of pertussis cases, particularly of the fatalities, as\nwell as the entire cohort of cases. Generally, 2 different circumstances\nare noted: children who were never adequately immunized against pertussis\nand those (often older children or adolescents) in whom the immunity of the\nprimary series they had received has waned. In both circumstances, it is\ncommon that adults with more atypical pertussis represent the reservoir to\ninfect the children. In addition to reaching 100 percent childhood\nimmunization, immunization of adults with the acellular pertussis vaccine,\nreasonably well tolerated in this group (unlike the old killed whole cell\nproduct), may be the answer.\nThis reference with abstract is an example of one study from Australia that\ndemonstrated the utility of the product in adults:\nTurnbull FM, Heath TC, Jalaludin BB, et al:A randomized trial of two\nacellular pertussis vaccines (dTpa and pa) and a licensed\ndiphtheria-tetanus vaccine (Td) in adults. Vaccine 2000; 19:628-36\nAbstract: A single blinded randomized controlled trial to compare the\nreactogenicity and immunogenicity of adult formulated dTpa and monovalent\npa vaccines with a licensed Td vaccine. 548 healthy adults aged 19-70 years\nreceived a single injection of dTpa or separate injections of pa or Td\n(with the alternate vaccine 1 month later). Local and systemic reactions\nwere monitored for 15 days after each vaccination. Serum antibody levels\nwere measured immediately prior to and 1 month after vaccination. Antibody\nlevels were measured 12 months after vaccination in 100 subjects. There was\nno difference in the total frequency of symptoms and signs between subjects\nreceiving any of the three vaccines. There was a significantly lower\nincidence of local reactions following pa (60 percent) than dTpa (80\npercent, P=0.002) or Td (93 percent, P=0.0008). The incidence of clinically\nsignificant (Grade 2 or 3) swelling (> or =20 mm) was higher for Td (20\npercent, P=0.002) than for dTpa (11 percent) or for pa (2 percent),\nhowever, there were no other significant differences in the incidence of\nGrade 2 or 3 reactions between the vaccines. A high anti-pertussis\nseroconversion rate (>97 percent) against all the studied pertussis\nantigens was seen 1 month after vaccination with dTpa and pa. A total of 96\nand 99 percent of subjects receiving dTpa and Td, respectively, had\nanti-diphtheria titres > or =0.01 IU/ml, and all but one subject had\nanti-tetanus titres > or =0.1 IU/ml after 1 month. Twelve months after\nvaccination the majority (90-100 percent) of the subjects were still\nseropositive for each antigen and although GMTs had decreased they were\nsubstantially higher than pre-vaccination levels. The dTpa vaccine was well\ntolerated and capable of eliciting an immune response against all the\nantigens in a broad spectrum of the adult population and could potentially\nreplace Td for routine boosters in adults. - Mod.LL]\n[Information on the age distribution and vaccination histories of the\nreported cases of pertussis in Texas was not available on the Texas State\nDepartment of Health webpages on\npertussis. <http://www.tdh.state.tx.us/immunize/pertussis.htm> There is\nmention that 30 percent of the reported cases in 2002 were in children less\nthan 1 year of age.

With the release of the\nacellular vaccine, studies are now showing the safety of\nadministration of this vaccine in older age groups. Other studies\nare being directed towards addressing the probable need to implement\npertussis boosters in older age groups (3).\nWhile waning immunity has been documented, there are conflicting\nreports in the literature of the duration of immunity following\nprimary immunization schedules. Many of these studies have measured\npertussis antibody levels by number of years following last pertussis\ndose (either primary series or after booster doses). One questions\nwhy we have not seen more outbreaks of pertussis in school-aged\nchildren in the developing world, where primary immunization with 3\ndoses of vaccine is the norm for the majority of the population.\n(One may argue that there probably is a significant problem, but\ndiagnosis of the disease in older children is less frequent, and\ntherefore reporting via disease surveillance systems is suboptimal to\nidentify this problem.)\nA note of caution on the interpretation of studies measuring duration\nof immunity. A 1997 Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices\nreport on the use of the acellular pertussis vaccine stated: 'It\nshould be mentioned that findings of efficacy studies have not\ndemonstrated a direct correlation between antibody responses and\nprotection against pertussis disease. However, antibody studies are\nuseful to compare immune responses elicited by a single vaccine under\ndifferent conditions or in different studies. Thus, efficacy studies\nare required to measure clinical protection conferred by each\npertussis vaccine.'\nWith respect to the outbreak in England, according to the newswire\nreports, only one of 87 students was not vaccinated. Assuming that\nthe unvaccinated child was one of the 23 reported cases, the\nestimated vaccine efficacy in this outbreak would be 74 percent,\nsomewhat decreased from a reported vaccine efficacy of approximately\n80 percent following 3 doses of the whole-cell vaccine.\nIn a recent MMWR article on the trends in pertussis in the USA, the\nauthors noted that the pertussis incidence continues to increase in\ninfants too young to receive 3 doses of pertussis-containing vaccine\nand in adolescents and adults (4). There was also reference to an\nobserved vaccine efficacy of 77-90 percent previously estimated using\nthe screening method (surveillance data) for whole-cell vaccine\nduring 1992--1994, comparing it to an observed vaccine efficacy of 88\npercent in 1998/1999. This observed efficacy range for the\nwhole-cell pertussis vaccine is not far off from the estimated\nvaccine efficacy in this current outbreak.\nOf additional mention is a study on an outbreak in the Netherlands in\n1996, which noted a probable decrease in vaccine efficacy among the\n1- to 4-year-old population. (The term 'probable' is being used, as\nthere was the question of possible increased reporting of cases that\nwas never fully resolved.) In this case, it was postulated that\nthere may have been changes in the pertussis organism in circulation\n(8,9).\nHence, one might question the actual etiology of this current\noutbreak of pertussis in a highly immunized population. Is it a\nwarning that a primary series of 3 doses of pertussis vaccine can\nresult in a vaccine efficacy that is too low to impact on disease\ntransmission? Is it a wake-up call for the need to further adjust\nimmunization schedules so that all children in primary schools in the\nUK receive at least 4 doses of pertussis vaccine (3 doses DPT, and 1\nbooster DaPT), thus highlighting the need for catchup boosters for\nchildren attending school prior to the addition of the school entry\ndose in the office immunization schedule in the UK? Or could we be\ndetecting the presence of a changing organism, as postulated in the\nDutch experience?\nLest we fall victim to becoming a listserve on immunization\npractices, this thread is now cut. - Mod.MPP\n1.

In this\nsetting, where we can assume a high proportion of actual infections, the\nnumber of culture positives achieved will be interesting. I hope we hear\nfrom public health authorities what the aggregate test results are. In some\npediatric settings in the US, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests are\nbeing used instead of cultures. One pediatric hospital in Fort Worth, Texas\nhas switched over to PCR entirely. The jury is still out on whether these\nare more sensitive and specific, although I have heard the Fort Worth\nhospital is happy with the change.\n--\nBrad Walsh\nParkland Health & Hospital System\nDallas, Texas, USA\n<epibeemie@hotmail.com>\n[Although culture of _B. pertussis_ on specific media has been considered\nto be the gold standard for diagnosis, its sensitivity is limited,\nparticularly if the patient has received antimicrobial therapy. In\naddition, even if positive, the results take 5 to 7 days, as this Gram\nnegative bacillus is slow-growing.

On 8 Apr 2002, the adoptive parents\npicked him up in the orphan ward at hospital A in Bryansk and noticed that\nthe child had upper respiratory congestion and cough. The adoptive parents\nreported that the infant had not received any vaccinations and that another\ninfant living in the same room in hospital A had a severe cough. The\nadopted infant subsequently was examined by a local physician, who\ndiagnosed his condition as a 'cold,' and the infant was taken to the U.S.\nEmbassy in Moscow, where the parents were interviewed for an immigrant visa\nfor the child.\nOn 24 Apr 2002, the infant and his parents traveled from Moscow to Raleigh,\nNorth Carolina, through New York on commercial airline flights. On 26 Apr\n2002, the infant was seen as an outpatient at a local clinic; a culture of\na nasopharyngeal swab confirmed infection with _Bordetella pertussis_. The\ninfant improved after treatment with clarithromycin and was administered\nthe first dose of diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and acellular pertussis\nvaccine (DTaP). The parents were placed on azithromycin for prophylaxis.\nCDC is collaborating with the U.S. Embassy, adoption agencies, visa\napplicant medical clinics in Moscow, and the airline to identify and notify\npersons who might have been exposed to the infant during his communicable\nperiod. The airline is working to identify those passengers who might have\nbeen exposed to the infant during his flights to North Carolina. CDC is\ncollaborating with state health departments, who are notifying and ensuring\nappropriate chemoprophylaxis and vaccination for exposed passengers in\ntheir jurisdiction.\nHealth-care providers and public health officials are advised to consider\npertussis when evaluating or notified of a person with an acute illness\ncharacterized by cough with paroxysms, whoop, or post-tussive gagging or\nvomiting. Following are CDC guidelines on the management of patients with\npertussis and their contacts:\nFor symptomatic patients, test by culture of nasopharyngeal aspirate or\nswab; a nasopharyngeal Dacron swab should be used. Swabs or aspirate should\nbe placed in Regan Lowe transport media if direct inoculation of selective\nmedia is not possible.\nFor hospitalized patients, respiratory isolation (droplet precautions) is\nrecommended for at least the first 5 days of antimicrobial treatment.\nFor symptomatic patients, the treatment of choice for pertussis is\nerythromycin for 14 days. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxozole is an alternative\nantibiotic. Limited clinical data suggest that newer macrolides, such as\nazithromycin for 5-7 days or clarithromycin for 14 days, might be as\neffective as erythromycin in the treatment of pertussis and are\nalternatives for patients who cannot tolerate erythromycin.\nFor exposed persons, chemoprophylaxis is recommended to limit secondary\ntransmission. Exposure is defined as having face-to-face contact, having\ndirect contact with respiratory, oral, or nasal secretions, or being in the\nsame room with a coughing pertussis case-patient. The recommended\nchemoprophylaxis regimen is erythromycin for 14 days. Alternative therapies\nare the same as for symptomatic patients.\nPertussis vaccination should be initiated or continued according to the\nrecommended schedule for exposed children aged under 7 years who are\nundervaccinated or who have received fewer than 4 DTaP doses. Exposed\nchildren may receive DTaP dose 2 or 3 if 4 weeks have elapsed after dose 1\nor 2, respectively. Children may receive DTaP dose 4 as early as age 12\nmonths, and preferably 6 months after dose 3. Children should be\nadministered DTaP dose 5 unless a dose was given within the last 3 years or\nthey are aged over 7 years.\nAdditional information about pertussis is available at:\n<http://www.cdc.gov/nip/publications/pertussis/guide.htm>\nReported by: see Source URL.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[The occurrence of pertussis in an unvaccinated child is not unusual in\nmany parts of the world.

I worked in 11\ncountries of the former Soviet Union, including Russia, starting from 1992\nuntil 1999 to provide technical support for vaccination programs. This\nwork was funded by USAID and carried out by the REACH and BASICS projects.\n\nIt will come as a surprise to most of your readers that most of the\ncountries of the former Soviet Union do not collect data on coverage with\n'DPT'. It is true that when reporting to international agencies, they\nreport their coverage invariably as DPT. However, these countries\ninternally reported, and most still report, coverage separately by each\nspecific antigen: that is, coverage with D, P, and T.\n\nIn the case of Russia, the difference between reported coverage with D and\ncoverage with P was significant, as much as 15 absolute percentage points\nin the late 1980s and early 1990s. This disparity reflected the concerns\ntypically heard from pediatricians that the DPT vaccine was 'too strong'\nand the children had become 'too weak' to be able to tolerate the pertussis\ncomponent of DPT. Consequently, many providers opted to use DT (and even Td\n!!) for pediatric immunization. Practitioners in the USA need to make\ncareful evaluation of adopted children's vaccination records to determine\nwhether or not they indeed received the pertussis component.\n\nThe countries of the former Soviet Union also never reported coverage on\nchildren under 12 months of age, which is the international standard. While\nthe countries of the former Soviet Union had an excellent system of\ntracking individual children in need of vaccination by pediatric catchment\nareas, they did not adopt this global standard of monitoring and reporting\nvaccination coverage by 12 months of age. Instead the numerator to\ncalculate coverage typically included children irrespective of age of\nvaccination and the denominator excluded the sizeable number of children\nwith permanent or temporary contraindications to vaccination. Consequently,\ntimely vaccination coverage was (and is) considerably less well reported in\nmany of these countries. In fact, as part of their applications for funding\nfrom GAVI (the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization), several of\nthe former Soviet countries conducted population-based 30-cluster\nvaccination coverage surveys. These surveys have all shown coverage by 12\nmonths of age to be about 20 percent (or more in some cases) lower than the\nreported figures.\n\nEach of these surveys also shows that the mean age of DPT vaccination is\nquite delayed, most likely due to the frequency of temporary contraindications.\n\nMuch of our work in collaboration with WHO was devoted to exposing these\nnew countries to recent developments in western science to guide policy\nreformulation, to encourage them to streamline their immunization\nschedules, to reduce their excessive lists of contraindications, and to\nestablish active monitoring systems (in Kyrgyzstan and Ukraine) so that\nhealth workers at all levels could indeed start to track their cumulative\nmonthly DPT coverage in infants. In most of the other countries of the\nformer Soviet Union, coverage is still monitored in the former Soviet\nfashion as described above.\n--\nRobert Steinglass\nImmunization Team Leader\nBASICS\n1600 Wilson Blvd., Suite 300\nArlington, VA. 22209\nUSA\n<rsteingl@basics.org>\n\n[Thank you very much for this clarification Robert. As someone who had\nworked fairly extensively in vaccination program activities internationally\n(but never in the Russian Federation), I still was unaware that the\npertussis component had been optionally removed as part of routine\nvaccination activities in that region. Hence, it is possible that many of\nthe children coming from the Russian Federation are behind in the pertussis\nvaccine component and that a careful review of the vaccination histories\nmight identify this. The additional information that many children's\nvaccinations are delayed for 'temporary reasons' may also explain the lower\ncoverages. Adjusting the reported coverage of 97 percent for the\ninformation from the coverage surveys would have the DPT coverages by age\n12 months to be approximately 77 percent overall, and indicative of the\nneed to improve vaccination activities, as well as highlighting the need to\ncarefully screen vaccination histories of children coming from the Russian\nFederation. - Mod.MPP]\n\n******\n[2]\nDate: Mon, 13 May 2002 15:11:02 -0400\nFrom: Sharon Ludwig <SLudwig@comdt.uscg.mil>\n\nAlthough the immunization records of internationally adopted children are\ncarefully reviewed by the US Embassy and INS officials, the children are\noften routinely completely re-vaccinated when they visit their primary care\nphysician in the US.

Adjusting the reported coverage of 97 percent for the\ninformation from the coverage surveys would have the DPT coverages by age\n12 months to be approximately 77 percent overall, and indicative of the\nneed to improve vaccination activities, as well as highlighting the need to\ncarefully screen vaccination histories of children coming from the Russian\nFederation. --\nSharon L.

While\nthe countries of the former Soviet Union had an excellent system of\ntracking individual children in need of vaccination by pediatric catchment\nareas, they did not adopt this global standard of monitoring and reporting\nvaccination coverage by 12 months of age. 2100 Second Street SW\nWashington, DC 20593\n<sludwig@comdt.uscg.mil>\n\n[Taking into consideration the information given by Robert Steinglass\nabove, it does not appear to be unwise to consider revaccination as\nmentioned here. Instead the numerator to\ncalculate coverage typically included children irrespective of age of\nvaccination and the denominator excluded the sizeable number of children\nwith permanent or temporary contraindications to vaccination. Although the immunization records of internationally adopted children are\ncarefully reviewed by the US Embassy and INS officials, the children are\noften routinely completely re-vaccinated when they visit their primary care\nphysician in the US. In fact, as part of their applications for funding\nfrom GAVI (the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization), several of\nthe former Soviet countries conducted population-based 30-cluster\nvaccination coverage surveys. Hence, it is possible that many of\nthe children coming from the Russian Federation are behind in the pertussis\nvaccine component and that a careful review of the vaccination histories\nmight identify this.

Shortages are greatest in the public sector. Despite high\nvaccination rates, pertussis continues to cause serious illness and\ndeath, particularly among infants aged over 6 months who are too\nyoung to have completed the 3-dose primary series of DTaP. In 2000, a\ntotal of 1873 pertussis cases (rate: 99 per 100,000 infants aged over\n6 months) and 16 deaths were reported among infants aged over 6\nmonths. Vaccinating infants on time with the 3-dose primary series of\nDTaP to protect them from serious disease remains a priority during\nthis vaccine shortage.\nThe shortage began in 2000 when 2 manufacturers (Wyeth Lederle, Pearl\nRiver, New York, and Baxter Hyland Immuno Vaccines, Baltimore,\nMaryland) stopped production of DTaP (1). Aventis Pasteur\n(Swiftwater, Pennsylvania) and GlaxoSmithKline (Philadelphia,\nPennsylvania), producers of Tripedia and Infanrix, respectively, are\nthe only 2 U.S. suppliers.\nDTaP is recommended as a 5-dose series: 3 doses administered to\ninfants at ages 2, 4, and 6 months, followed by 2 additional doses at\nage 15--18 months and at age 4--6 years (2). During the shortage of\nDTaP, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommends\nthat providers who do not have enough DTaP to vaccinate all children\nwith 5 doses give priority to vaccinating infants with the first 3\ndoses. To ensure an adequate supply of DTaP to vaccinate infants,\nproviders should first defer vaccination of children aged 15--18\nmonths with the fourth DTaP dose. If deferring the fourth dose does\nnot leave enough DTaP to vaccinate infants, then the fifth DTaP dose\n(given to children aged 4--6 years) also should be deferred*. In\nareas with severe DTaP shortages, local public health officials might\nelect to recommend communitywide deferral of the fourth DTaP dose,\nand, if necessary, the fifth DTaP dose.\nWhen the DTaP shortage ends, providers should recall and administer\nDTaP to all children who missed a dose. Vaccination of children aged\n4--6 years is needed to ensure immunity to pertussis, diphtheria, and\ntetanus during the elementary school years (2).\nReferences\n1. CDC.

Although not all potential surveillance artifacts could\nbe excluded, it is highly probable that the data reflect a true\noutbreak. However, the cause of this increase has not yet been\ndetermined. Further research is directed to the severity of\ndisease and a possible mismatch between the vaccine and the\ncirculating Bordetella strains.\n[Excerpts]\nIn 1996, 2,771 cases of pertussis were reported to the Inspectorate of\nHealth in the Netherlands (population 15 million), compared with 319 cases\nin 1995. With epidemic cycles expected every 3 to 5 years and a recent\noutbreak in 1994, this rise was unexpected (1). After the introduction of\npertussis immunization with a whole-cell vaccine in the National\nImmunization Program (1952), the incidence of pertussis in the Netherlands\ndecreased significantly. Children are immunized at ages 3, 4, 5, and 11\nmonths with a diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, and inactivated polio vaccine\n(DTP-IPV), and vaccine coverage for pertussis, for at least three\nimmunizations, is 96% at the age of 12 months. Until the 1980s, the\nincidence of pertussis seemed very low, because only incidental cases were\nreported. However, in the last two decades, pertussis has been endemic, and\nepidemic peaks have appeared......\nAlthough not all potential surveillance artifacts could be excluded, it is\nhighly probable that the surveillance data reflect a true pertussis\noutbreak. The outbreak could have been caused by 1) decrease in vaccination\ncoverage, 2) decrease in vaccine quality, 3) interference with other\nvaccines, 4) changes in circulating strains of B. pertussis that are not\ncovered by vaccine-induced immunity, or 5) a combination of these factors.\nA decrease in vaccination coverage has not been observed in the (accurate)\nreporting system. The whole-cell vaccine used was produced in the National\nInstitute of Public Health and the Environment and meets international\nstandards. There was no sign of a gradual deterioration of vaccine quality\nas determined for product release by the mouse protection test......\nMolecular typing of B. pertussis isolates collected since 1945 indicated a\nshift in population structure, possibly due to the introduction of\nwhole-cell vaccine (5). Further, antigenic variants of B. pertussis\ndistinct from the strains incorporated in the vaccine appear to have\nemerged (6). It might be possible that circulating strains of B. pertussis\nhave become less sensitive to vaccine-induced immunity. The abrupt increase\nin the proportion of vaccinated patients reported in all age groups\nsuggests such a change.\nData from other countries in Europe indicate that the pertussis epidemic is\nrestricted to the Netherlands. However, a resurgence of pertussis has been\nnoted in the United States since the late 1980s and in Canada since 1991.\nNo single factor has been found to explain this resurgence (7-10).....\nA prospective study is being considered to assess efficacy of the\nwhole-cell vaccine, including differentiation of severity of illness and\nnumber of immunizations received, if the outbreak continues. Cooperative\nstudies to determine the distribution of restriction fragment length\npolymorphism types and antigenic variants of B. pertussis in various\ncountries in Europe, Asia, and North America are under way. Also, the\nimmunogenicity of the Dutch whole-cell vaccine is being assessed: whether\nit has changed over time and how it compares to published immunogenicity\ndata of whole-cell vaccines with known, prospectively determined, vaccine\nefficacy (11).\nIn conclusion, in the Netherlands a sudden increase of pertussis\nnotification has been observed, which seems to reflect a true increase in\nincidence. Nevertheless, the cause of this increase has not been\ndefinitively determined. A possible mismatch between the vaccine and the\ncirculating Bordetella strains is being investigated.\nH.E. de Melker,* M.A.E. Conyn-van Spaendonck,* H.C. R=FCmke,* J.K. van\nWijngaarden,=86 F.R.

In 1996, a sudden increase in pertussis incidence was reported\nin the Netherlands (2.1 per 100,000 in 1995, 18 per 100,000 in\n1996). Although not all potential surveillance artifacts could be excluded, it is\nhighly probable that the surveillance data reflect a true pertussis\noutbreak. Antigenic variation\nof the accellular vaccine component pertactin in the Dutch B.\npertussis population. In 1996, 2,771 cases of pertussis were reported to the Inspectorate of\nHealth in the Netherlands (population 15 million), compared with 319 cases\nin 1995. In conclusion, in the Netherlands a sudden increase of pertussis\nnotification has been observed, which seems to reflect a true increase in\nincidence. A prospective study is being considered to assess efficacy of the\nwhole-cell vaccine, including differentiation of severity of illness and\nnumber of immunizations received, if the outbreak continues. Until the 1980s, the\nincidence of pertussis seemed very low, because only incidental cases were\nreported. There was no sign of a gradual deterioration of vaccine quality\nas determined for product release by the mouse protection test......\n However, in the last two decades, pertussis has been endemic, and\nepidemic peaks have appeared......\n The whole-cell vaccine used was produced in the National\nInstitute of Public Health and the Environment and meets international\nstandards. Although not all potential surveillance artifacts could\nbe excluded, it is highly probable that the data reflect a true\noutbreak. The abrupt increase\nin the proportion of vaccinated patients reported in all age groups\nsuggests such a change. H.C. R=FCmke,* J.K. van\nWijngaarden,=86 F.R. Mooi,* and J.F.P.

It might be possible that circulating strains of B. pertussis\nhave become less sensitive to vaccine-induced immunity.
