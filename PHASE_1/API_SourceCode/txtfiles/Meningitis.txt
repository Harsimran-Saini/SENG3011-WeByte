We shouldn't think that all mosquitoes are infected with the virus. The individual protection is the availability of repellents, the other is within the reach of the state \" Dr. Tatiana Chervenyakova, said in an interview for Bulgaria ON ON AIR.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[This report deals with mosquito-borne virus infections, but does not indicate which one, nor is the number of cases to date given. There are 2 possible arboviruses involved as the etiological agents of these cases: West Nile virus or Usutu virus. Both have been found in Central Europe. As noted in a previous ProMED-mail post, \"West Nile virus (WNV) and Usutu virus (USUV) are phylogenetically closely related mosquito-borne members of the family _Flaviviridae_, and belong to the Japanese encephalitis antigenic complex of the _Flavivirus genus_ (1,2). Both viruses have been isolated from numerous ornithophilic mosquito species, mainly _Culex_ spp. (1,2). In the enzootic cycle of WNV and USUV, avian species are also involved and serve as amplifying hosts. Mosquitoes facilitate virus transmission to humans and equids which then remain incidental hosts as they are not able to produce a level of viraemia sufficient for further virus transmission by mosquito bites (2).\" (see https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2019.24.28.1900038 for complete reference list, including those cited here).\n\nProMED-mail would appreciate a response indicating which virus or viruses are involved in these cases in Bulgaria. - Mod.TY\n\nHealthMap/ProMED map available at:\nBulgaria: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/81]\nSee Also\nWest Nile virus (23): Europe (Greece) 20190804.6605638\nWest Nile virus (21): Europe (Greece) ECDC update 20190727.6590710\nWest Nile virus (18): Europe (Hungary) Usutu, ECDC 20190719.6567315\n.................................................sb/jh/ty/ao/lxl", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "west nile virus", "encephalitis", "meningitis"], "syndromes": ["encephalitis", "meningitis"], "event_date": [], "locations": [{"location": "Greece", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Bulgaria", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Hungary", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "6398266", "headline": "PRO/EDR> Meningitis, meningococcal - Niger (02): counterfeit vaccines, alert", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=6398266", "date": "2018-11-08 21:20:39", "main_text": "MENINGITIS, MENINGOCOCCAL - NEW ZEALAND: EMERGENCE OF SEROGROUP W\n*****************************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Tue 6 Nov 2018\nSource: Ministry of Health (New Zealand) [edited]\nhttps://www.health.govt.nz/our-work/diseases-and-conditions/meningococcal/meningococcal-disease-information-general-practitioners-and-emergency-departments\n\n\nThere has been a significant increase in _Neisseria meningitidis_ serogroup W (MenW) in New Zealand since mid-2017. Between 1 Jan 2017 and 31 Dec 2017, there were 12 cases of MenW reported, including 3 deaths. This number has doubled to date for 2018, with 24 cases reported so far (as of 5 Nov [2018]), including 6 deaths. Prior to 2017, 0 to 6 MenW cases were reported each year. The Northland region has been the most affected in 2018, with 7 of the 24 cases reported in this region, including 4 cases in September and October [2018].\n\nThis particular strain of MenW (sequence type ST11) affects all age groups and is associated with a high case-fatality rate. MenW can present with the classical signs of meningococcal disease but also atypically with gastrointestinal symptoms, as well as pneumonia, septic arthritis, endocarditis, or epi/supraglottitis. MenW was previously referred to as W135. Similar increases in MenW have been seen in other countries, including the UK and Australia.\n\nOverall, the annual number of meningococcal disease cases due to all serogroups has been increasing steadily since 2014, when there were 45 cases, to 112 cases in 2017. There [have] been 96 cases to date this year [2018] (as of 5 Nov [2018]). Group B remains the most prevalent serogroup, though this year [2018] the number of group B infections is lower (43 cases) than in 2017 (60 cases) at the same time of the year.\n\nKey messages\n-----\n- General practitioners and emergency departments should be aware that there has been an increase in meningococcal disease caused by serogroup W in New Zealand over the past 2 years. They should be aware that this strain presents atypically, and they should keep a high level of suspicion for the disease.\n- Because of the fulminant nature of meningococcal sepsis, antibiotics should be administered on suspicion of diagnosis before transferring the patient to the hospital.\n- GPs do not need to be concerned that administering antibiotics will obscure the diagnosis for hospital clinicians. Overtreatment is acceptable in this case, as failure to treat may be fatal.\n- The antibiotics recommended prior to transfer to hospital are as follows:\nAdults: Benzyl penicillin: 1.2 g (2 megaunits) IV (or IM); amoxycillin: 1-2 g IV (or IM)\nChildren: Benzyl penicillin: 25-50 mg/kg IV (or IM); amoxycillin: 50-100 mg/kg IV (or IM)\n- Antibiotics given prior to transfer should be clearly noted on the clinical information that accompanies the patient to the hospital.\n- Patients with a documented history of anaphylaxis to penicillin and who are suspected of suffering from meningococcal disease should be sent immediately to the hospital without pre-admission antibiotics.\n- A blood sample should be taken as soon as possible for laboratory testing but should not delay patient treatment or transfer.\n- If you are not sure if it is meningococcal disease, (1) advise parents/caregivers to check the sick person frequently (e.g., every hour). The sick person should not remain alone; (2) make sure the case seeks immediate medical attention if he or she deteriorates; and (3) reassess the case within 6 hours.\n- The quadrivalent MCV4-D vaccine (Menactra) protects against MenW and is available in New Zealand. It is recommended for high-risk groups and is funded for some of them (please refer to the meningococcal disease chapter in the immunisation handbook). Please make sure that high-risk patients for whom the vaccine is funded are protected.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Kunihiko Iizuka\n\n[Meningococci are classified into serogroups based on the antigenic specificity of their polysaccharide capsule. Six serogroups (A, B, C, W, and Y) cause almost all invasive disease globally. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST), based on DNA sequence of 7 housekeeping genes, is used to classify meningococci into lineages (sequence types, ST). Closely related STs are termed \"clonal complex.\"\n\nPrior to 2000, serogroup W was not a very common cause of meningococcal disease. However, in 2000 and 2001, serogroup W ST-11 strains caused an outbreak related to the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca, Saudi Arabia. The outbreak spread internationally through pilgrims, with cases identified among Hajj pilgrims and their close contacts globally, including countries in Europe, Africa, and Asia, but following mandatory quadrivalent meningococcal vaccination for pilgrims in 2001, W ST-11 cases declined among Hajj pilgrims (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971216310207).\n\nNevertheless, both Hajj-related and non-Hajj serogroup W ST-11 strains then continued to circulate, causing disease worldwide. Hajj-related W ST-11 strains have caused outbreaks in the African meningitis belt and South Africa. Non-Hajj serogroup W ST-11 strains emerged in South America, and a descendant of this strain was responsible for the initial increase in invasive W ST-11 disease in the UK (https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2016.21.24.30259) and other European countries (France, Netherlands, Sweden) (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971218300201). Other W lineages persist in low numbers in Europe, North America, and the meningitis belt (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26876439).\n\nPatients with serogroup W ST-11 infection may present with more severe disease; unusual clinical presentations, including gastrointestinal symptoms, septic arthritis, necrotising fasciitis, pneumonia, and myopericarditis; and a high case-fatality ratio. Atypical clinical presentations may lead to delays in diagnosis and treatment as well as delays in public health notification, contact tracing, and timely administration of antibiotic chemoprophylaxis to close contacts for prevention of secondary invasive meningococcal disease.\n\nIn some countries like the UK, the emergence of serogroup W disease has followed the near-elimination of serogroup C disease after the introduction of meningococcal C vaccine into the national childhood vaccine schedule (ProMED-mail post Meningitis, meningococcal - UK: emergence of serogroup W, changed vaccine policy 20150926.3673122). However, in New Zealand, meningococal vaccines are not included in the childhood immunization schedule (https://www.health.govt.nz/system/files/documents/publications/immshandbook-national-immunisation-schedule-mar18.pdf). The conjugated quadrivalent (serogroups A, C, Y, and W) MCV4-D (Menactra) and the conjugated meningococcal serogroup C vaccine MenCCV (NeisVac-C) are available, but only publicly funded for the following high-risk groups (https://www.health.govt.nz/system/files/documents/publications/immshandbook-12-meningococcal-disease-mar18-v2.pdf):\n\u2022 patients pre- or post-splenectomy or with functional asplenia;\n\u2022 patients with HIV, complement deficiency (acquired, including monoclonal antibody therapy against C5, or inherited) or pre- or post-solid organ transplant;\n\u2022 HSCT [human stem cell transplant] (bone marrow transplant) patients;\n\u2022 patients following immunosuppression; and\n\u2022 close contacts of meningococcal cases (of relevant serotype).\n\nThe news report above says that the Northland region has been the most affected by the emergence of serogroup W disease. The Northland is the northernmost of New Zealand's 16 local government regions; a map of these regions can be found at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regions_of_New_Zealand. - Mod.ML\n\nHealthMap/ProMED-mail map:\nNew Zealand: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/164]\nSee Also\nMeningitis, meningococcal - Netherlands: emergence of hypervirulent sg.

Overtreatment is acceptable in this case, as failure to treat may be fatal.\n- The antibiotics recommended prior to transfer to hospital are as follows:\nAdults: Benzyl penicillin: 1.2 g (2 megaunits) IV (or IM); amoxycillin: 1-2 g IV (or IM)\nChildren: Benzyl penicillin: 25-50 mg/kg IV (or IM); amoxycillin: 50-100 mg/kg IV (or IM)\n- Antibiotics given prior to transfer should be clearly noted on the clinical information that accompanies the patient to the hospital.\n- Patients with a documented history of anaphylaxis to penicillin and who are suspected of suffering from meningococcal disease should be sent immediately to the hospital without pre-admission antibiotics.\n- A blood sample should be taken as soon as possible for laboratory testing but should not delay patient treatment or transfer.\n- If you are not sure if it is meningococcal disease, (1) advise parents/caregivers to check the sick person frequently (e.g., every hour). The sick person should not remain alone; (2) make sure the case seeks immediate medical attention if he or she deteriorates; and (3) reassess the case within 6 hours.\n- The quadrivalent MCV4-D vaccine (Menactra) protects against MenW and is available in New Zealand. It is recommended for high-risk groups and is funded for some of them (please refer to the meningococcal disease chapter in the immunisation handbook). Please make sure that high-risk patients for whom the vaccine is funded are protected.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Kunihiko Iizuka\n\n[Meningococci are classified into serogroups based on the antigenic specificity of their polysaccharide capsule. Six serogroups (A, B, C, W, and Y) cause almost all invasive disease globally. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST), based on DNA sequence of 7 housekeeping genes, is used to classify meningococci into lineages (sequence types, ST). Closely related STs are termed \"clonal complex.\"\n\nPrior to 2000, serogroup W was not a very common cause of meningococcal disease. However, in 2000 and 2001, serogroup W ST-11 strains caused an outbreak related to the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca, Saudi Arabia. The outbreak spread internationally through pilgrims, with cases identified among Hajj pilgrims and their close contacts globally, including countries in Europe, Africa, and Asia, but following mandatory quadrivalent meningococcal vaccination for pilgrims in 2001, W ST-11 cases declined among Hajj pilgrims (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971216310207).\n\nNevertheless, both Hajj-related and non-Hajj serogroup W ST-11 strains then continued to circulate, causing disease worldwide. Hajj-related W ST-11 strains have caused outbreaks in the African meningitis belt and South Africa. Non-Hajj serogroup W ST-11 strains emerged in South America, and a descendant of this strain was responsible for the initial increase in invasive W ST-11 disease in the UK (https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2016.21.24.30259) and other European countries (France, Netherlands, Sweden) (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971218300201). Other W lineages persist in low numbers in Europe, North America, and the meningitis belt (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26876439).\n\nPatients with serogroup W ST-11 infection may present with more severe disease; unusual clinical presentations, including gastrointestinal symptoms, septic arthritis, necrotising fasciitis, pneumonia, and myopericarditis; and a high case-fatality ratio. Atypical clinical presentations may lead to delays in diagnosis and treatment as well as delays in public health notification, contact tracing, and timely administration of antibiotic chemoprophylaxis to close contacts for prevention of secondary invasive meningococcal disease.\n\nIn some countries like the UK, the emergence of serogroup W disease has followed the near-elimination of serogroup C disease after the introduction of meningococcal C vaccine into the national childhood vaccine schedule (ProMED-mail post Meningitis, meningococcal - UK: emergence of serogroup W, changed vaccine policy 20150926.3673122). However, in New Zealand, meningococal vaccines are not included in the childhood immunization schedule (https://www.health.govt.nz/system/files/documents/publications/immshandbook-national-immunisation-schedule-mar18.pdf). The conjugated quadrivalent (serogroups A, C, Y, and W) MCV4-D (Menactra) and the conjugated meningococcal serogroup C vaccine MenCCV (NeisVac-C) are available, but only publicly funded for the following high-risk groups (https://www.health.govt.nz/system/files/documents/publications/immshandbook-12-meningococcal-disease-mar18-v2.pdf):\n\u2022 patients pre- or post-splenectomy or with functional asplenia;\n\u2022 patients with HIV, complement deficiency (acquired, including monoclonal antibody therapy against C5, or inherited) or pre- or post-solid organ transplant;\n\u2022 HSCT [human stem cell transplant] (bone marrow transplant) patients;\n\u2022 patients following immunosuppression; and\n\u2022 close contacts of meningococcal cases (of relevant serotype).\n\nThe news report above says that the Northland region has been the most affected by the emergence of serogroup W disease.

Between 1 Jan 2017 and 31 Dec 2017, there were 12 cases of MenW reported, including 3 deaths. This number has doubled to date for 2018, with 24 cases reported so far (as of 5 Nov [2018]), including 6 deaths. Prior to 2017, 0 to 6 MenW cases were reported each year. The Northland region has been the most affected in 2018, with 7 of the 24 cases reported in this region, including 4 cases in September and October [2018].\n\nThis particular strain of MenW (sequence type ST11) affects all age groups and is associated with a high case-fatality rate. MenW can present with the classical signs of meningococcal disease but also atypically with gastrointestinal symptoms, as well as pneumonia, septic arthritis, endocarditis, or epi/supraglottitis. MenW was previously referred to as W135. Similar increases in MenW have been seen in other countries, including the UK and Australia.\n\nOverall, the annual number of meningococcal disease cases due to all serogroups has been increasing steadily since 2014, when there were 45 cases, to 112 cases in 2017. There [have] been 96 cases to date this year [2018] (as of 5 Nov [2018]).

The conjugated quadrivalent (serogroups A, C, Y, and W) MCV4-D (Menactra) and the conjugated meningococcal serogroup C vaccine MenCCV (NeisVac-C) are available, but only publicly funded for the following high-risk groups (https://www.health.govt.nz/system/files/documents/publications/immshandbook-12-meningococcal-disease-mar18-v2.pdf):\n\u2022 patients pre- or post-splenectomy or with functional asplenia;\n\u2022 patients with HIV, complement deficiency (acquired, including monoclonal antibody therapy against C5, or inherited) or pre- or post-solid organ transplant;\n\u2022 HSCT [human stem cell transplant] (bone marrow transplant) patients;\n\u2022 patients following immunosuppression; and\n\u2022 close contacts of meningococcal cases (of relevant serotype).\n\nThe news report above says that the Northland region has been the most affected by the emergence of serogroup W disease.

Between 1 Jan 2017 and 31 Dec 2017, there were 12 cases of MenW reported, including 3 deaths. This number has doubled to date for 2018, with 24 cases reported so far (as of 5 Nov [2018]), including 6 deaths. Prior to 2017, 0 to 6 MenW cases were reported each year. The Northland region has been the most affected in 2018, with 7 of the 24 cases reported in this region, including 4 cases in September and October [2018].\n\nThis particular strain of MenW (sequence type ST11) affects all age groups and is associated with a high case-fatality rate. MenW can present with the classical signs of meningococcal disease but also atypically with gastrointestinal symptoms, as well as pneumonia, septic arthritis, endocarditis, or epi/supraglottitis. MenW was previously referred to as W135. Similar increases in MenW have been seen in other countries, including the UK and Australia.\n\nOverall, the annual number of meningococcal disease cases due to all serogroups has been increasing steadily since 2014, when there were 45 cases, to 112 cases in 2017. There [have] been 96 cases to date this year [2018] (as of 5 Nov [2018]). Group B remains the most prevalent serogroup, though this year [2018] the number of group B infections is lower (43 cases) than in 2017 (60 cases) at the same time of the year.\n\nKey messages\n-----\n- General practitioners and emergency departments should be aware that there has been an increase in meningococcal disease caused by serogroup W in New Zealand over the past 2 years. They should be aware that this strain presents atypically, and they should keep a high level of suspicion for the disease.\n- Because of the fulminant nature of meningococcal sepsis, antibiotics should be administered on suspicion of diagnosis before transferring the patient to the hospital.\n- GPs do not need to be concerned that administering antibiotics will obscure the diagnosis for hospital clinicians. Overtreatment is acceptable in this case, as failure to treat may be fatal.\n- The antibiotics recommended prior to transfer to hospital are as follows:\nAdults: Benzyl penicillin: 1.2 g (2 megaunits) IV (or IM); amoxycillin: 1-2 g IV (or IM)\nChildren: Benzyl penicillin: 25-50 mg/kg IV (or IM); amoxycillin: 50-100 mg/kg IV (or IM)\n- Antibiotics given prior to transfer should be clearly noted on the clinical information that accompanies the patient to the hospital.\n- Patients with a documented history of anaphylaxis to penicillin and who are suspected of suffering from meningococcal disease should be sent immediately to the hospital without pre-admission antibiotics.\n- A blood sample should be taken as soon as possible for laboratory testing but should not delay patient treatment or transfer.\n- If you are not sure if it is meningococcal disease, (1) advise parents/caregivers to check the sick person frequently (e.g., every hour). The sick person should not remain alone; (2) make sure the case seeks immediate medical attention if he or she deteriorates; and (3) reassess the case within 6 hours.\n- The quadrivalent MCV4-D vaccine (Menactra) protects against MenW and is available in New Zealand. It is recommended for high-risk groups and is funded for some of them (please refer to the meningococcal disease chapter in the immunisation handbook). Please make sure that high-risk patients for whom the vaccine is funded are protected.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Kunihiko Iizuka\n\n[Meningococci are classified into serogroups based on the antigenic specificity of their polysaccharide capsule. Six serogroups (A, B, C, W, and Y) cause almost all invasive disease globally. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST), based on DNA sequence of 7 housekeeping genes, is used to classify meningococci into lineages (sequence types, ST). Closely related STs are termed \"clonal complex.\"\n\nPrior to 2000, serogroup W was not a very common cause of meningococcal disease. However, in 2000 and 2001, serogroup W ST-11 strains caused an outbreak related to the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca, Saudi Arabia. The outbreak spread internationally through pilgrims, with cases identified among Hajj pilgrims and their close contacts globally, including countries in Europe, Africa, and Asia, but following mandatory quadrivalent meningococcal vaccination for pilgrims in 2001, W ST-11 cases declined among Hajj pilgrims (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971216310207).\n\nNevertheless, both Hajj-related and non-Hajj serogroup W ST-11 strains then continued to circulate, causing disease worldwide. Hajj-related W ST-11 strains have caused outbreaks in the African meningitis belt and South Africa. Non-Hajj serogroup W ST-11 strains emerged in South America, and a descendant of this strain was responsible for the initial increase in invasive W ST-11 disease in the UK (https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2016.21.24.30259) and other European countries (France, Netherlands, Sweden) (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971218300201). Other W lineages persist in low numbers in Europe, North America, and the meningitis belt (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26876439).\n\nPatients with serogroup W ST-11 infection may present with more severe disease; unusual clinical presentations, including gastrointestinal symptoms, septic arthritis, necrotising fasciitis, pneumonia, and myopericarditis; and a high case-fatality ratio. Atypical clinical presentations may lead to delays in diagnosis and treatment as well as delays in public health notification, contact tracing, and timely administration of antibiotic chemoprophylaxis to close contacts for prevention of secondary invasive meningococcal disease.\n\nIn some countries like the UK, the emergence of serogroup W disease has followed the near-elimination of serogroup C disease after the introduction of meningococcal C vaccine into the national childhood vaccine schedule (ProMED-mail post Meningitis, meningococcal - UK: emergence of serogroup W, changed vaccine policy 20150926.3673122).

Between 1 Jan 2017 and 31 Dec 2017, there were 12 cases of MenW reported, including 3 deaths. This number has doubled to date for 2018, with 24 cases reported so far (as of 5 Nov [2018]), including 6 deaths. Prior to 2017, 0 to 6 MenW cases were reported each year. The Northland region has been the most affected in 2018, with 7 of the 24 cases reported in this region, including 4 cases in September and October [2018].\n\nThis particular strain of MenW (sequence type ST11) affects all age groups and is associated with a high case-fatality rate. MenW can present with the classical signs of meningococcal disease but also atypically with gastrointestinal symptoms, as well as pneumonia, septic arthritis, endocarditis, or epi/supraglottitis. MenW was previously referred to as W135. Similar increases in MenW have been seen in other countries, including the UK and Australia.\n\nOverall, the annual number of meningococcal disease cases due to all serogroups has been increasing steadily since 2014, when there were 45 cases, to 112 cases in 2017. There [have] been 96 cases to date this year [2018] (as of 5 Nov [2018]). Group B remains the most prevalent serogroup, though this year [2018] the number of group B infections is lower (43 cases) than in 2017 (60 cases) at the same time of the year.\n\nKey messages\n-----\n- General practitioners and emergency departments should be aware that there has been an increase in meningococcal disease caused by serogroup W in New Zealand over the past 2 years. They should be aware that this strain presents atypically, and they should keep a high level of suspicion for the disease.\n- Because of the fulminant nature of meningococcal sepsis, antibiotics should be administered on suspicion of diagnosis before transferring the patient to the hospital.\n- GPs do not need to be concerned that administering antibiotics will obscure the diagnosis for hospital clinicians. Overtreatment is acceptable in this case, as failure to treat may be fatal.\n- The antibiotics recommended prior to transfer to hospital are as follows:\nAdults: Benzyl penicillin: 1.2 g (2 megaunits) IV (or IM); amoxycillin: 1-2 g IV (or IM)\nChildren: Benzyl penicillin: 25-50 mg/kg IV (or IM); amoxycillin: 50-100 mg/kg IV (or IM)\n- Antibiotics given prior to transfer should be clearly noted on the clinical information that accompanies the patient to the hospital.\n- Patients with a documented history of anaphylaxis to penicillin and who are suspected of suffering from meningococcal disease should be sent immediately to the hospital without pre-admission antibiotics.\n- A blood sample should be taken as soon as possible for laboratory testing but should not delay patient treatment or transfer.\n- If you are not sure if it is meningococcal disease, (1) advise parents/caregivers to check the sick person frequently (e.g., every hour). The sick person should not remain alone; (2) make sure the case seeks immediate medical attention if he or she deteriorates; and (3) reassess the case within 6 hours.\n- The quadrivalent MCV4-D vaccine (Menactra) protects against MenW and is available in New Zealand. It is recommended for high-risk groups and is funded for some of them (please refer to the meningococcal disease chapter in the immunisation handbook). Please make sure that high-risk patients for whom the vaccine is funded are protected.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Kunihiko Iizuka\n\n[Meningococci are classified into serogroups based on the antigenic specificity of their polysaccharide capsule. Six serogroups (A, B, C, W, and Y) cause almost all invasive disease globally. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST), based on DNA sequence of 7 housekeeping genes, is used to classify meningococci into lineages (sequence types, ST). Closely related STs are termed \"clonal complex.\"\n\nPrior to 2000, serogroup W was not a very common cause of meningococcal disease. However, in 2000 and 2001, serogroup W ST-11 strains caused an outbreak related to the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca, Saudi Arabia. The outbreak spread internationally through pilgrims, with cases identified among Hajj pilgrims and their close contacts globally, including countries in Europe, Africa, and Asia, but following mandatory quadrivalent meningococcal vaccination for pilgrims in 2001, W ST-11 cases declined among Hajj pilgrims (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971216310207).\n\nNevertheless, both Hajj-related and non-Hajj serogroup W ST-11 strains then continued to circulate, causing disease worldwide. Hajj-related W ST-11 strains have caused outbreaks in the African meningitis belt and South Africa. Non-Hajj serogroup W ST-11 strains emerged in South America, and a descendant of this strain was responsible for the initial increase in invasive W ST-11 disease in the UK (https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2016.21.24.30259) and other European countries (France, Netherlands, Sweden) (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971218300201). Other W lineages persist in low numbers in Europe, North America, and the meningitis belt (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26876439).\n\nPatients with serogroup W ST-11 infection may present with more severe disease; unusual clinical presentations, including gastrointestinal symptoms, septic arthritis, necrotising fasciitis, pneumonia, and myopericarditis; and a high case-fatality ratio. Atypical clinical presentations may lead to delays in diagnosis and treatment as well as delays in public health notification, contact tracing, and timely administration of antibiotic chemoprophylaxis to close contacts for prevention of secondary invasive meningococcal disease.\n\nIn some countries like the UK, the emergence of serogroup W disease has followed the near-elimination of serogroup C disease after the introduction of meningococcal C vaccine into the national childhood vaccine schedule (ProMED-mail post Meningitis, meningococcal - UK: emergence of serogroup W, changed vaccine policy 20150926.3673122). However, in New Zealand, meningococal vaccines are not included in the childhood immunization schedule (https://www.health.govt.nz/system/files/documents/publications/immshandbook-national-immunisation-schedule-mar18.pdf). The conjugated quadrivalent (serogroups A, C, Y, and W) MCV4-D (Menactra) and the conjugated meningococcal serogroup C vaccine MenCCV (NeisVac-C) are available, but only publicly funded for the following high-risk groups (https://www.health.govt.nz/system/files/documents/publications/immshandbook-12-meningococcal-disease-mar18-v2.pdf):\n\u2022 patients pre- or post-splenectomy or with functional asplenia;\n\u2022 patients with HIV, complement deficiency (acquired, including monoclonal antibody therapy against C5, or inherited) or pre- or post-solid organ transplant;\n\u2022 HSCT [human stem cell transplant] (bone marrow transplant) patients;\n\u2022 patients following immunosuppression; and\n\u2022 close contacts of meningococcal cases (of relevant serotype).\n\nThe news report above says that the Northland region has been the most affected by the emergence of serogroup W disease. The Northland is the northernmost of New Zealand's 16 local government regions; a map of these regions can be found at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regions_of_New_Zealand. - Mod.ML\n\nHealthMap/ProMED-mail map:\nNew Zealand: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/164]\nSee Also\nMeningitis, meningococcal - Netherlands: emergence of hypervirulent sg.

After investigation, another 2 soldiers who served in the same base with the index case developed symptoms of meningitis and were reported subsequently. Blood cultures from all 3 cases yielded serogroup B _Neisseria meningitidis_ with indistinguishable pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns. A total of 114 contacts received chemoprophylaxis with rifampin or ciprofloxacin. Nevertheless, the hospital laboratory found that the isolate from the index case was resistant to ciprofloxacin. Of the 98 contacts receiving ciprofloxacin as initial chemoprophylaxis, 54 contacts were offered azithromycin, while the rest 44 contacts declined. No secondary cases were identified in the contacts during the one-month follow-up period. The outbreak underscores the importance of antimicrobial surveillance of _Neisseria meningitidis_. The antimicrobial profiles of isolates from the cases should be reviewed and taken into consideration in terms of chemoprophylaxis for contacts.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Angela Song-En Huang\n\n[Household and other close contacts of persons with invasive meningococcal disease have a higher risk for carriage and invasive disease, for which they should receive antibiotic chemoprophylaxis to eliminate nasopharyngeal carriage of _N. meningitidis_ as soon as possible. Ciprofloxacin has been an effective single-dose oral chemoprophylaxis agent. However, sporadic isolates ciprofloxacin-resistant meningococci disease began to appear in the Americas, Europe, Australia, China, and India. As a result, in 2008, the U.S. CDC recommended ciprofloxacin should no longer be used for chemoprophylaxis of meningococcal disease in communities where fiprofloxacin-resistant strains have been identified (selected U.S. counties in North Dakota and Minnesota).

Over recent years Fiji has had an increase in cases of meningococcal disease. Prior to 2016, there were 1 to 10 cases per year reported. In 2016 there were 29 cases, and in 2017 there were 48 cases. In 2018, there have been 18 cases as of [21 Feb 2018].\n\nEven with the recent increase in cases, meningococcal disease remains uncommon in Fiji; however, this disease has a high death rate. According to WHO, without appropriate medical treatment, up to 5 per cent of people who get the disease will die. Most people who get the disease, and are treated appropriately, will recover fully; however 10-15 per cent will still die, and around 2 per cent will have permanent disabilities, including severe brain damage.\n\nIn 2017, 14.4 per cent of all people who had meningococcal disease in Fiji died. To put this in context, the death rate for dengue fever in Fiji is 0.4-0.6 per cent annually, even during outbreaks. This is why the Ministry of Health and Medical Services is taking nationwide action.\n\nThe meningococcal disease bacteria are not easily transmitted but are spread from person to person via transfer of saliva or spit. This can happen when a person with the bacteria coughs on an uninfected person, or deeply kisses an uninfected person on the mouth. It may also be spread through sharing of drinks from the same glass/cup, water bottle or bowl, such as kava or taki alcohol at a nightclub. Babies and children under the age of 5 frequently put things into their mouths, therefore they are also at risk of getting the bacteria.\n\n[byline: Akosita Talei]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The news report above fails to characterize the patients with invasive meningococcal disease; for example, were they part of the population at increased risk for meningococcal disease because of age; a medical condition (complement component deficiencies), HIV infection, or absent spleen; travel or residence in countries in which the disease is common; or being a college student or military recruit living in a residence hall. We are also not told the meningococcal serogroups involved.\n\nHowever, ProMED-mail reported in 2017 that a total of 8 cases, including 1 fatal case, of meningococcal serogroup C meningitis occurred on the campus of St John's College, a Roman Catholic secondary school located on the Fiji island of Ovalau (see alsos below).

School officials did not detail how they would enforce the vaccination requirement but indicated they would have rules that could not be easily circumvented. \"If you are not vaccinated against this disease and you are a student on that campus, you are at risk for meningococcal infection,\" said Dr Paul Cieslak, medical director for communicable diseases and immunizations at the Oregon Health Authority Public Health Division. \"We do feel that now, because there is a break between classes, that this is the best time for students to get vaccinated.\"\n\nMeningococcal disease is not a highly contagious disease, but it has a 100 percent fatality rate without antibiotic treatment. Even with antibiotics, some 15 percent of those infected will die. Another 15 to 20 percent will incur long-term consequences such as brain damage or the loss of fingers or limbs. \"This disease can progress from sort of feeling like you have the flu and feeling crummy to being catastrophic very quickly,\" said Charlie Fautin, deputy director of the Benton County Health Department. \"We've been very fortunate in this outbreak. The 5 previous students all made full recoveries.\"\n\nThe outbreak began in November 2016 when 2 students were hospitalized with meningococcal B disease in less than a week. A 3rd student was diagnosed in March [2017], prompting a formal declaration of an outbreak.\n\nSchool officials organized 2 mass vaccination clinics in the spring and 3 more this fall [2017]. Vaccination efforts mainly targeted students with frequent close contact, including those living in residences and group housing, and on athletic teams. The school already had a requirement to get a meningococcal vaccine that protects against the A, C, Y, and W strains of the disease. But that vaccine offers no protection against the B strain that is currently circulating on the Corvallis campus. The school revised its vaccination guidelines for the current school year, requiring all incoming freshmen and transfer students to be vaccinated specifically for meningococcal B disease by the 1st week of November [2017] in order to register for winter term classes.\n\nBut a 4th student was diagnosed in October and a 5th in November [2017] while home for Thanksgiving [23 Nov 2017] outside of Corvallis. The 6th case was a 21-year-old student hospitalized [17 Dec 2017] while visiting family. Testing to confirm the strain has not been completed.\n\n\"We realize now, with this case which involves an older student not living in congregate housing, like residence halls or group living, that we need to up our requirements,\" said Steve Clark, OSU vice president for university relations and marketing, who has spearheaded the school's response to the outbreak.\n\nThe standard approach with a single case of meningococcal disease is to provide antibiotics to those in close contact with the infected person. But as the outbreak spread across the campus, with no obvious link between the 6 cases, officials had to broaden the scope of their interventions. \"The problem is the cat's out of the bag. It's spread completely through the campus,\" Cieslak said. \"It's not like it's in one dorm, one fraternity or one athletic team. Therefore the only way to protect people is to get them all immune.\"\n\nMeningococcal disease can include meningitis, an infection of the fluids that line the brain and spinal cord. Meningitis symptoms can include fever, headache, stiff neck, nausea and confusion. The bacteria can also cause a blood infection, known as meningococcemia, with symptoms such as fever, shaking chills, rash, fatigue, severe aches and pains and rapid breathing. The disease is spread when a healthy person comes in close contact with an infected person's nose or throat fluids, such as droplets from a sneeze, spit or saliva. It occurs most often among large groups of people living in close quarters, such as in university residences, group housing or fraternities or sororities. The bacteria are being spread from student to student on campus with most infections not causing recognizable symptoms. \"We don't know who they are, and we don't know who it's going to strike next,\" Cieslak said.\n\nPublic health officials urged families and friends to be on the lookout for symptoms of meningococcal disease, and recommend that doctors have a low threshold for suspecting the condition, particularly in OSU students.\n\nIn 2015, the University of Oregon had a meningococcal B outbreak affecting 6 students, one of whom died. The university held 4 mass vaccination clinics with the goal of immunizing all undergraduate students, but according to public health officials, only an estimated 6 percent of students were fully vaccinated.\n\n\"The best prevention is vaccination,\" Fautin said. \"This is the proven way to disrupt these kinds of outbreaks and our uptake unfortunately has not been as great as we would like.\" 2 brands of meningococcal vaccine are licensed for use in the United States from age 10 to 25. Bexsoro requires 2 doses given at least one month apart for full coverage. Trumemba requires 3 doses, with follow-up doses one month and 6 months after the 1st. Cieslak said a single dose of either vaccine is likely to provide only 40 to 60 percent effectiveness, compared to 80 to 90 percent effectiveness for the full series. The vaccines are not interchangeable so follow-up doses should be of the same brand.\n\nDoctors and county health officials in Central Oregon have been on alert for cases, particularly those involving college students. Deschutes County Health Services offers the vaccine and is compiling a list of pharmacies that offer it, including Rite Aid, Walgreens, Fred Meyer, and Safeway on Century Drive. St Charles Health System offers the vaccines in its family care and school-based clinics. The vaccine costs about USD 300 but is covered by insurance plans. Some university students, however, had trouble getting insurance coverage for the vaccine on campus because the providers were out-of-network. The Oregon Legislature passed House Bill 3276 to address that issue during outbreaks, and the governor signs the bill into law in August [2017].\n\nThe holiday break, however, often brings students back to their familiar doctors and pharmacists, or back home where parents can ensure their children get vaccinated. Cieslak stressed the importance of prevention as well as timely treatment if symptoms arise. \"It's a nasty virulent bacterium that can affect even perfectly healthy people,\" he said. \"And if you have it in your spinal fluid and you don't get antibiotics promptly, you are going to die.\"\n\n[Byline: Markian Hawryluk]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[In November 2016, ProMED-mail posted a report that 2 Oregon State University (OSU) students in Corvallis, Oregon were diagnosed with invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) due to _Neisseria meningitidis_ serogroup B (see ProMED-mail post Meningitis, meningococcal - USA (02): (OR) college, sg B, sg B vaccine 20161123.4649319) and in March 2017, meningococcal serogroup B meningitis was reported in a 3rd student on the Corvallis campus (see ProMED-mail post Meningitis, meningococcal - USA: (OR) college, sg B, sg B vaccine, RFI 20170305.4881298).\n\nIn October 2017, we posted a report of a 4th OSU student on the Corvallis campus with IMD; although we were not told at that time what the serogroup of the pathogen was, it apparently was also serogroup B (ProMED-mail post Meningitis, meningococcal - USA (02): (OR) college 20171030.5412497) and in Nov 2017 we were told of a 5th OSU student has developed IMD due to serogroup B (Meningitis, meningococcal - USA (06): (OR) college, sg B 20171130.5473532).

School officials did not detail how they would enforce the vaccination requirement but indicated they would have rules that could not be easily circumvented. \"If you are not vaccinated against this disease and you are a student on that campus, you are at risk for meningococcal infection,\" said Dr Paul Cieslak, medical director for communicable diseases and immunizations at the Oregon Health Authority Public Health Division. \"We do feel that now, because there is a break between classes, that this is the best time for students to get vaccinated.\"\n\nMeningococcal disease is not a highly contagious disease, but it has a 100 percent fatality rate without antibiotic treatment. Even with antibiotics, some 15 percent of those infected will die. Another 15 to 20 percent will incur long-term consequences such as brain damage or the loss of fingers or limbs. \"This disease can progress from sort of feeling like you have the flu and feeling crummy to being catastrophic very quickly,\" said Charlie Fautin, deputy director of the Benton County Health Department. \"We've been very fortunate in this outbreak. The 5 previous students all made full recoveries.\"\n\nThe outbreak began in November 2016 when 2 students were hospitalized with meningococcal B disease in less than a week. A 3rd student was diagnosed in March [2017], prompting a formal declaration of an outbreak.\n\nSchool officials organized 2 mass vaccination clinics in the spring and 3 more this fall [2017]. Vaccination efforts mainly targeted students with frequent close contact, including those living in residences and group housing, and on athletic teams. The school already had a requirement to get a meningococcal vaccine that protects against the A, C, Y, and W strains of the disease. But that vaccine offers no protection against the B strain that is currently circulating on the Corvallis campus. The school revised its vaccination guidelines for the current school year, requiring all incoming freshmen and transfer students to be vaccinated specifically for meningococcal B disease by the 1st week of November [2017] in order to register for winter term classes.\n\nBut a 4th student was diagnosed in October and a 5th in November [2017] while home for Thanksgiving [23 Nov 2017] outside of Corvallis. The 6th case was a 21-year-old student hospitalized [17 Dec 2017] while visiting family. Testing to confirm the strain has not been completed.\n\n\"We realize now, with this case which involves an older student not living in congregate housing, like residence halls or group living, that we need to up our requirements,\" said Steve Clark, OSU vice president for university relations and marketing, who has spearheaded the school's response to the outbreak.\n\nThe standard approach with a single case of meningococcal disease is to provide antibiotics to those in close contact with the infected person. But as the outbreak spread across the campus, with no obvious link between the 6 cases, officials had to broaden the scope of their interventions. \"The problem is the cat's out of the bag. It's spread completely through the campus,\" Cieslak said. \"It's not like it's in one dorm, one fraternity or one athletic team. Therefore the only way to protect people is to get them all immune.\"\n\nMeningococcal disease can include meningitis, an infection of the fluids that line the brain and spinal cord. Meningitis symptoms can include fever, headache, stiff neck, nausea and confusion. The bacteria can also cause a blood infection, known as meningococcemia, with symptoms such as fever, shaking chills, rash, fatigue, severe aches and pains and rapid breathing. The disease is spread when a healthy person comes in close contact with an infected person's nose or throat fluids, such as droplets from a sneeze, spit or saliva. It occurs most often among large groups of people living in close quarters, such as in university residences, group housing or fraternities or sororities. The bacteria are being spread from student to student on campus with most infections not causing recognizable symptoms. \"We don't know who they are, and we don't know who it's going to strike next,\" Cieslak said.\n\nPublic health officials urged families and friends to be on the lookout for symptoms of meningococcal disease, and recommend that doctors have a low threshold for suspecting the condition, particularly in OSU students.\n\nIn 2015, the University of Oregon had a meningococcal B outbreak affecting 6 students, one of whom died. The university held 4 mass vaccination clinics with the goal of immunizing all undergraduate students, but according to public health officials, only an estimated 6 percent of students were fully vaccinated.\n\n\"The best prevention is vaccination,\" Fautin said. \"This is the proven way to disrupt these kinds of outbreaks and our uptake unfortunately has not been as great as we would like.\" 2 brands of meningococcal vaccine are licensed for use in the United States from age 10 to 25. Bexsoro requires 2 doses given at least one month apart for full coverage. Trumemba requires 3 doses, with follow-up doses one month and 6 months after the 1st. Cieslak said a single dose of either vaccine is likely to provide only 40 to 60 percent effectiveness, compared to 80 to 90 percent effectiveness for the full series. The vaccines are not interchangeable so follow-up doses should be of the same brand.\n\nDoctors and county health officials in Central Oregon have been on alert for cases, particularly those involving college students. Deschutes County Health Services offers the vaccine and is compiling a list of pharmacies that offer it, including Rite Aid, Walgreens, Fred Meyer, and Safeway on Century Drive.

School officials did not detail how they would enforce the vaccination requirement but indicated they would have rules that could not be easily circumvented. \"If you are not vaccinated against this disease and you are a student on that campus, you are at risk for meningococcal infection,\" said Dr Paul Cieslak, medical director for communicable diseases and immunizations at the Oregon Health Authority Public Health Division. \"We do feel that now, because there is a break between classes, that this is the best time for students to get vaccinated.\"\n\nMeningococcal disease is not a highly contagious disease, but it has a 100 percent fatality rate without antibiotic treatment. Even with antibiotics, some 15 percent of those infected will die. Another 15 to 20 percent will incur long-term consequences such as brain damage or the loss of fingers or limbs. \"This disease can progress from sort of feeling like you have the flu and feeling crummy to being catastrophic very quickly,\" said Charlie Fautin, deputy director of the Benton County Health Department. \"We've been very fortunate in this outbreak. The 5 previous students all made full recoveries.\"\n\nThe outbreak began in November 2016 when 2 students were hospitalized with meningococcal B disease in less than a week. A 3rd student was diagnosed in March [2017], prompting a formal declaration of an outbreak.\n\nSchool officials organized 2 mass vaccination clinics in the spring and 3 more this fall [2017]. Vaccination efforts mainly targeted students with frequent close contact, including those living in residences and group housing, and on athletic teams. The school already had a requirement to get a meningococcal vaccine that protects against the A, C, Y, and W strains of the disease. But that vaccine offers no protection against the B strain that is currently circulating on the Corvallis campus. The school revised its vaccination guidelines for the current school year, requiring all incoming freshmen and transfer students to be vaccinated specifically for meningococcal B disease by the 1st week of November [2017] in order to register for winter term classes.\n\nBut a 4th student was diagnosed in October and a 5th in November [2017] while home for Thanksgiving [23 Nov 2017] outside of Corvallis. The 6th case was a 21-year-old student hospitalized [17 Dec 2017] while visiting family. Testing to confirm the strain has not been completed.\n\n\"We realize now, with this case which involves an older student not living in congregate housing, like residence halls or group living, that we need to up our requirements,\" said Steve Clark, OSU vice president for university relations and marketing, who has spearheaded the school's response to the outbreak.\n\nThe standard approach with a single case of meningococcal disease is to provide antibiotics to those in close contact with the infected person. But as the outbreak spread across the campus, with no obvious link between the 6 cases, officials had to broaden the scope of their interventions. \"The problem is the cat's out of the bag. It's spread completely through the campus,\" Cieslak said. \"It's not like it's in one dorm, one fraternity or one athletic team. Therefore the only way to protect people is to get them all immune.\"\n\nMeningococcal disease can include meningitis, an infection of the fluids that line the brain and spinal cord. Meningitis symptoms can include fever, headache, stiff neck, nausea and confusion. The bacteria can also cause a blood infection, known as meningococcemia, with symptoms such as fever, shaking chills, rash, fatigue, severe aches and pains and rapid breathing. The disease is spread when a healthy person comes in close contact with an infected person's nose or throat fluids, such as droplets from a sneeze, spit or saliva. It occurs most often among large groups of people living in close quarters, such as in university residences, group housing or fraternities or sororities. The bacteria are being spread from student to student on campus with most infections not causing recognizable symptoms. \"We don't know who they are, and we don't know who it's going to strike next,\" Cieslak said.\n\nPublic health officials urged families and friends to be on the lookout for symptoms of meningococcal disease, and recommend that doctors have a low threshold for suspecting the condition, particularly in OSU students.\n\nIn 2015, the University of Oregon had a meningococcal B outbreak affecting 6 students, one of whom died. The university held 4 mass vaccination clinics with the goal of immunizing all undergraduate students, but according to public health officials, only an estimated 6 percent of students were fully vaccinated.\n\n\"The best prevention is vaccination,\" Fautin said. \"This is the proven way to disrupt these kinds of outbreaks and our uptake unfortunately has not been as great as we would like.\" 2 brands of meningococcal vaccine are licensed for use in the United States from age 10 to 25. Bexsoro requires 2 doses given at least one month apart for full coverage. Trumemba requires 3 doses, with follow-up doses one month and 6 months after the 1st. Cieslak said a single dose of either vaccine is likely to provide only 40 to 60 percent effectiveness, compared to 80 to 90 percent effectiveness for the full series. The vaccines are not interchangeable so follow-up doses should be of the same brand.\n\nDoctors and county health officials in Central Oregon have been on alert for cases, particularly those involving college students. Deschutes County Health Services offers the vaccine and is compiling a list of pharmacies that offer it, including Rite Aid, Walgreens, Fred Meyer, and Safeway on Century Drive. St Charles Health System offers the vaccines in its family care and school-based clinics. The vaccine costs about USD 300 but is covered by insurance plans. Some university students, however, had trouble getting insurance coverage for the vaccine on campus because the providers were out-of-network. The Oregon Legislature passed House Bill 3276 to address that issue during outbreaks, and the governor signs the bill into law in August [2017].\n\nThe holiday break, however, often brings students back to their familiar doctors and pharmacists, or back home where parents can ensure their children get vaccinated. Cieslak stressed the importance of prevention as well as timely treatment if symptoms arise. \"It's a nasty virulent bacterium that can affect even perfectly healthy people,\" he said. \"And if you have it in your spinal fluid and you don't get antibiotics promptly, you are going to die.\"\n\n[Byline: Markian Hawryluk]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[In November 2016, ProMED-mail posted a report that 2 Oregon State University (OSU) students in Corvallis, Oregon were diagnosed with invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) due to _Neisseria meningitidis_ serogroup B (see ProMED-mail post Meningitis, meningococcal - USA (02): (OR) college, sg B, sg B vaccine 20161123.4649319) and in March 2017, meningococcal serogroup B meningitis was reported in a 3rd student on the Corvallis campus (see ProMED-mail post Meningitis, meningococcal - USA: (OR) college, sg B, sg B vaccine, RFI 20170305.4881298).\n\nIn October 2017, we posted a report of a 4th OSU student on the Corvallis campus with IMD; although we were not told at that time what the serogroup of the pathogen was, it apparently was also serogroup B (ProMED-mail post Meningitis, meningococcal - USA (02): (OR) college 20171030.5412497) and in Nov 2017 we were told of a 5th OSU student has developed IMD due to serogroup B (Meningitis, meningococcal - USA (06): (OR) college, sg B 20171130.5473532).

It's spread completely through the campus,\" Cieslak said. \"It's not like it's in one dorm, one fraternity or one athletic team.

Meningitis symptoms can include fever, headache, stiff neck, nausea and confusion. The bacteria can also cause a blood infection, known as meningococcemia, with symptoms such as fever, shaking chills, rash, fatigue, severe aches and pains and rapid breathing. The disease is spread when a healthy person comes in close contact with an infected person's nose or throat fluids, such as droplets from a sneeze, spit or saliva. It occurs most often among large groups of people living in close quarters, such as in university residences, group housing or fraternities or sororities. The bacteria are being spread from student to student on campus with most infections not causing recognizable symptoms. \"We don't know who they are, and we don't know who it's going to strike next,\" Cieslak said.\n\nPublic health officials urged families and friends to be on the lookout for symptoms of meningococcal disease, and recommend that doctors have a low threshold for suspecting the condition, particularly in OSU students.\n\nIn 2015, the University of Oregon had a meningococcal B outbreak affecting 6 students, one of whom died. The university held 4 mass vaccination clinics with the goal of immunizing all undergraduate students, but according to public health officials, only an estimated 6 percent of students were fully vaccinated.\n\n\"The best prevention is vaccination,\" Fautin said. \"This is the proven way to disrupt these kinds of outbreaks and our uptake unfortunately has not been as great as we would like.\" 2 brands of meningococcal vaccine are licensed for use in the United States from age 10 to 25. Bexsoro requires 2 doses given at least one month apart for full coverage. Trumemba requires 3 doses, with follow-up doses one month and 6 months after the 1st. Cieslak said a single dose of either vaccine is likely to provide only 40 to 60 percent effectiveness, compared to 80 to 90 percent effectiveness for the full series. The vaccines are not interchangeable so follow-up doses should be of the same brand.\n\nDoctors and county health officials in Central Oregon have been on alert for cases, particularly those involving college students. Deschutes County Health Services offers the vaccine and is compiling a list of pharmacies that offer it, including Rite Aid, Walgreens, Fred Meyer, and Safeway on Century Drive. St Charles Health System offers the vaccines in its family care and school-based clinics. The vaccine costs about USD 300 but is covered by insurance plans. Some university students, however, had trouble getting insurance coverage for the vaccine on campus because the providers were out-of-network. The Oregon Legislature passed House Bill 3276 to address that issue during outbreaks, and the governor signs the bill into law in August [2017].\n\nThe holiday break, however, often brings students back to their familiar doctors and pharmacists, or back home where parents can ensure their children get vaccinated.

School officials did not detail how they would enforce the vaccination requirement but indicated they would have rules that could not be easily circumvented. \"If you are not vaccinated against this disease and you are a student on that campus, you are at risk for meningococcal infection,\" said Dr Paul Cieslak, medical director for communicable diseases and immunizations at the Oregon Health Authority Public Health Division. \"We do feel that now, because there is a break between classes, that this is the best time for students to get vaccinated.\"\n\nMeningococcal disease is not a highly contagious disease, but it has a 100 percent fatality rate without antibiotic treatment. Even with antibiotics, some 15 percent of those infected will die. Another 15 to 20 percent will incur long-term consequences such as brain damage or the loss of fingers or limbs. \"This disease can progress from sort of feeling like you have the flu and feeling crummy to being catastrophic very quickly,\" said Charlie Fautin, deputy director of the Benton County Health Department. \"We've been very fortunate in this outbreak. The 5 previous students all made full recoveries.\"\n\nThe outbreak began in November 2016 when 2 students were hospitalized with meningococcal B disease in less than a week. A 3rd student was diagnosed in March [2017], prompting a formal declaration of an outbreak.\n\nSchool officials organized 2 mass vaccination clinics in the spring and 3 more this fall [2017]. Vaccination efforts mainly targeted students with frequent close contact, including those living in residences and group housing, and on athletic teams. The school already had a requirement to get a meningococcal vaccine that protects against the A, C, Y, and W strains of the disease. But that vaccine offers no protection against the B strain that is currently circulating on the Corvallis campus. The school revised its vaccination guidelines for the current school year, requiring all incoming freshmen and transfer students to be vaccinated specifically for meningococcal B disease by the 1st week of November [2017] in order to register for winter term classes.\n\nBut a 4th student was diagnosed in October and a 5th in November [2017] while home for Thanksgiving [23 Nov 2017] outside of Corvallis. The 6th case was a 21-year-old student hospitalized [17 Dec 2017] while visiting family. Testing to confirm the strain has not been completed.\n\n\"We realize now, with this case which involves an older student not living in congregate housing, like residence halls or group living, that we need to up our requirements,\" said Steve Clark, OSU vice president for university relations and marketing, who has spearheaded the school's response to the outbreak.\n\nThe standard approach with a single case of meningococcal disease is to provide antibiotics to those in close contact with the infected person.

Do we know what strain(s) of meningococcal disease the Taiwan cases had? Were they all the same? If the organisms are distinguishable, we would not consider this an outbreak but, rather, a cluster.\n2. Much of the evidence on which chemoprophylaxis policies are based is now rather old. At the time, it was far more common for students to live in \"dormitories\", with 2 or more students sharing a bedroom. Now -- at least in the UK -- this is extremely unusual: most student accommodation has only one student (or couple) per bedroom - no sharing with a relative stranger. A high proportion even have en-suite bathroom facilities. Is that the same in USA? Perhaps the Taiwanese military provides less comfortable lodgings!\n3. What is the basis for the moderator's comment that \"The choice of vaccine will depend on knowing the serogroup of the outbreak strain, because the quadrivalent (ACYW) meningococcal vaccine will cover serogroups A, C, Y, and W, and the serogroup B vaccine will cover only serogroup B, without cross-coverage.\" I'm particularly interested in the comment that the \"serogroup B vaccine will only cover...\". Since the so-called serogroup B vaccines do not use the polysaccharide capsule ABCWY antigens, but rather antigens from different part of the organism, they are independent of the ABCWY antigens, and the group B vaccines can be expected to be effective against meningococci independent of the ABCWY classification.\n4. Experience with these new so-called serogroup B vaccines remains limited. At present we do not have evidence to clarify the extent of \"herd immunity\" they will provide, but we have some evidence to suggest that they prevent disease (invasion), but not colonization (infection), and are therefore unlikely to have a significant effect on herd immunity.\n5. The rationale for chemoprophylaxis based on the hypothesis that a more-than-usually virulent strain has evolved, with the argument going as follows:\na. Meningococcal carriage is common - in some studies, over a 3rd of 1rst-year university students will be carrying the organism after 2-3 months at university (a combination of the carriage rates in this age-group, and the social-mixing effect of starting at university, presumably).\nb. People [who] become ill with invasive meningococcal disease almost invariably get sick within 5 days of acquiring the organism. If somebody has been colonized for 7 days or more, they are extremely unlikely to get sick with it.\nc. Some strains -- like the C strain that caused outbreaks in teenagers in the UK in the 90s -- are considerably more virulent, with very little asymptomatic carriage. (The virulence genes are unrelated to the capsular phenotype, and capsular switching, maintaining the same virulence factors, is possible and appears to have happened with the increase in W serogroup disease in the UK, for example.[1])\nd. For the less virulent strains at least...\ne. When somebody becomes ill, it could be because of individual factors (the case was unusually susceptible -- for underlying reasons, such as inherited complement deficiencies, or because of an unfortunate timing eg recent viral infection); or because of pathogen associated factors -- the organism had evolved to become more than usually virulent.\nf. Given the high carriage rates, there's little point in chemoprophylaxis for normally virulent organisms.\ng. So chemoprophylaxis is based on the hypothesis that the case may have acquired their infection from a healthy carrier of a more virulent organism. The purpose is to eliminate carriage of this organism. The contacts targeted are therefore those from whom the case is most likely to have acquired their infection. (There is very little evidence of benefit for treating other people exposed to the case.)\nh. There is also a hypothesis -- supported, I believe, by some evidence -- that healthy carriers of meningococci and related organisms (such as _N. lactamica_) can benefit from \"competitive inhibition\". This means that the presence of the organism they are carrying reduces their chances of acquiring a new, potentially more virulent strain - see b. above.\ni. For this reason, extending chemoprophylaxis to people other than those from whom the case acquired their infection might do more harm than good (by increasing people's susceptibility to new infections).\n\n1.

Protection against invasive meningococcal disease is conferred mainly by complement-mediated antibody-dependent killing of _Neisseria meningitidis_. Studies that tested in an in vitro bactericidal assay against serogroup C, W and Y meningococci using sera collected in the UK, Germany, France and Brazil from individuals immunized with one of the B serogroup vaccines found that sera from was bactericidal \"in a range from 45 per cent to 90 per cent\" (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4755123/#R11), the preliminary data having been presented in poster sessions.\n\nHowever, on the basis of what we know for sure at present, \"experts from the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\" (http://www.immunize.org/askexperts/experts_meningococcal_b.asp), say that meningococcal polysaccharide and conjugate vaccines \"provide no protection against serogroup B disease, and meningococcal serogroup B vaccines (MenB) provide no protection against serogroup A, C, W, or Y disease. For protection against all 5 serogroups of meningococcus, it is necessary to receive MenACWY or MPSV4 and MenB.\" And the CDC's recommendations (https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/vis/vis-statements/mening-serogroup.html) clearly state, \"Serogroup B meningococcal (MenB) vaccines can help prevent meningococcal disease caused by serogroup B. Other meningococcal vaccines are recommended to help protect against serogroups A, C, W, and Y.\"\n\nIn regard to antimicrobial chemoprophylaxis, its rationale for close contacts of cases of meningococcal disease is based on the high attack rate of secondary meningococcal disease among these contacts, which has been estimated to be 500-800 times greater than for the general population (https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00046263.htm). Because the attack rate for close contacts is highest during the 1st few days after onset of disease in the primary patient, antimicrobial chemoprophylaxis should be administered as soon as possible. - Mod.ML]\nSee Also\nMeningitis, meningococcal - Taiwan: fatal, military base 20170801.5218924\n.................................................ml/ec/sh", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "meningitis"], "syndromes": ["meningitis"], "event_date": ["2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2015-07-16 00:00:00", "2016-01-16 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "MILITARY", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "TAIWAN", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "ABCWY", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Germany", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "France", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "United Kingdom", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "USA", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "UK", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "England", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Brazil", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "abcwy", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "FATAL", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Taiwan", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "5391253", "headline": "PRO/EDR> Meningitis, meningococcal - Japan: airplane exposure, boy scouts, 2015", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=5391253", "date": "2017-08-05 14:56:51", "main_text": "MENINGITIS, MENINGOCOCCAL - TAIWAN (02): FATAL, MILITARY BASE, COMMENT\n**********************************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Wed 2 Aug 2017\nFrom: Peter M B English <peter.english@phe.gov.uk> [edited]\n\n\nI was particularly interested to see this report from Taiwan, having just been involved in a vaccination programme in response to 3 cases of meningococcal disease at the University of Surrey (Guildford, United Kingdom).\n\nA few points...\n1.

If the organisms are distinguishable, we would not consider this an outbreak but, rather, a cluster.\n2. Much of the evidence on which chemoprophylaxis policies are based is now rather old. At the time, it was far more common for students to live in \"dormitories\", with 2 or more students sharing a bedroom. Now -- at least in the UK -- this is extremely unusual: most student accommodation has only one student (or couple) per bedroom - no sharing with a relative stranger. A high proportion even have en-suite bathroom facilities. Is that the same in USA? Perhaps the Taiwanese military provides less comfortable lodgings!\n3. What is the basis for the moderator's comment that \"The choice of vaccine will depend on knowing the serogroup of the outbreak strain, because the quadrivalent (ACYW) meningococcal vaccine will cover serogroups A, C, Y, and W, and the serogroup B vaccine will cover only serogroup B, without cross-coverage.\" I'm particularly interested in the comment that the \"serogroup B vaccine will only cover...\". Since the so-called serogroup B vaccines do not use the polysaccharide capsule ABCWY antigens, but rather antigens from different part of the organism, they are independent of the ABCWY antigens, and the group B vaccines can be expected to be effective against meningococci independent of the ABCWY classification.\n4. Experience with these new so-called serogroup B vaccines remains limited. At present we do not have evidence to clarify the extent of \"herd immunity\" they will provide, but we have some evidence to suggest that they prevent disease (invasion), but not colonization (infection), and are therefore unlikely to have a significant effect on herd immunity.\n5. The rationale for chemoprophylaxis based on the hypothesis that a more-than-usually virulent strain has evolved, with the argument going as follows:\na. Meningococcal carriage is common - in some studies, over a 3rd of 1rst-year university students will be carrying the organism after 2-3 months at university (a combination of the carriage rates in this age-group, and the social-mixing effect of starting at university, presumably).\nb. People [who] become ill with invasive meningococcal disease almost invariably get sick within 5 days of acquiring the organism. If somebody has been colonized for 7 days or more, they are extremely unlikely to get sick with it.\nc. Some strains -- like the C strain that caused outbreaks in teenagers in the UK in the 90s -- are considerably more virulent, with very little asymptomatic carriage. (The virulence genes are unrelated to the capsular phenotype, and capsular switching, maintaining the same virulence factors, is possible and appears to have happened with the increase in W serogroup disease in the UK, for example.[1])\nd. For the less virulent strains at least...\ne. When somebody becomes ill, it could be because of individual factors (the case was unusually susceptible -- for underlying reasons, such as inherited complement deficiencies, or because of an unfortunate timing eg recent viral infection); or because of pathogen associated factors -- the organism had evolved to become more than usually virulent.\nf. Given the high carriage rates, there's little point in chemoprophylaxis for normally virulent organisms.\ng. So chemoprophylaxis is based on the hypothesis that the case may have acquired their infection from a healthy carrier of a more virulent organism. The purpose is to eliminate carriage of this organism. The contacts targeted are therefore those from whom the case is most likely to have acquired their infection. (There is very little evidence of benefit for treating other people exposed to the case.)\nh. There is also a hypothesis -- supported, I believe, by some evidence -- that healthy carriers of meningococci and related organisms (such as _N. lactamica_) can benefit from \"competitive inhibition\". This means that the presence of the organism they are carrying reduces their chances of acquiring a new, potentially more virulent strain - see b. above.\ni. For this reason, extending chemoprophylaxis to people other than those from whom the case acquired their infection might do more harm than good (by increasing people's susceptibility to new infections).\n\n1.

Protection against invasive meningococcal disease is conferred mainly by complement-mediated antibody-dependent killing of _Neisseria meningitidis_. Studies that tested in an in vitro bactericidal assay against serogroup C, W and Y meningococci using sera collected in the UK, Germany, France and Brazil from individuals immunized with one of the B serogroup vaccines found that sera from was bactericidal \"in a range from 45 per cent to 90 per cent\" (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4755123/#R11), the preliminary data having been presented in poster sessions.\n\nHowever, on the basis of what we know for sure at present, \"experts from the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\" (http://www.immunize.org/askexperts/experts_meningococcal_b.asp), say that meningococcal polysaccharide and conjugate vaccines \"provide no protection against serogroup B disease, and meningococcal serogroup B vaccines (MenB) provide no protection against serogroup A, C, W, or Y disease. For protection against all 5 serogroups of meningococcus, it is necessary to receive MenACWY or MPSV4 and MenB.\" And the CDC's recommendations (https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/vis/vis-statements/mening-serogroup.html) clearly state, \"Serogroup B meningococcal (MenB) vaccines can help prevent meningococcal disease caused by serogroup B. Other meningococcal vaccines are recommended to help protect against serogroups A, C, W, and Y.\"\n\nIn regard to antimicrobial chemoprophylaxis, its rationale for close contacts of cases of meningococcal disease is based on the high attack rate of secondary meningococcal disease among these contacts, which has been estimated to be 500-800 times greater than for the general population (https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00046263.htm). Because the attack rate for close contacts is highest during the 1st few days after onset of disease in the primary patient, antimicrobial chemoprophylaxis should be administered as soon as possible. - Mod.ML]\nSee Also\nMeningitis, meningococcal - Taiwan: fatal, military base 20170801.5218924\n.................................................ml/ec/sh", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "meningitis"], "syndromes": ["meningitis"], "event_date": ["2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2015-07-16 00:00:00", "2016-01-16 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "MILITARY", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "TAIWAN", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "ABCWY", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Germany", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "France", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "United Kingdom", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "USA", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "UK", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "England", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Brazil", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "abcwy", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "FATAL", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Taiwan", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "5376391", "headline": "PRO/EDR> Meningitis, meningococcal - Australia (03): (NT) sg W, Aboriginal children", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=5376391", "date": "2017-08-05 14:56:51", "main_text": "MENINGITIS, MENINGOCOCCAL - TAIWAN (02): FATAL, MILITARY BASE, COMMENT\n**********************************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Wed 2 Aug 2017\nFrom: Peter M B English <peter.english@phe.gov.uk> [edited]\n\n\nI was particularly interested to see this report from Taiwan, having just been involved in a vaccination programme in response to 3 cases of meningococcal disease at the University of Surrey (Guildford, United Kingdom).\n\nA few points...\n1.

The rationale for chemoprophylaxis based on the hypothesis that a more-than-usually virulent strain has evolved, with the argument going as follows:\na. Meningococcal carriage is common - in some studies, over a 3rd of 1rst-year university students will be carrying the organism after 2-3 months at university (a combination of the carriage rates in this age-group, and the social-mixing effect of starting at university, presumably).\nb. People [who] become ill with invasive meningococcal disease almost invariably get sick within 5 days of acquiring the organism. If somebody has been colonized for 7 days or more, they are extremely unlikely to get sick with it.\nc. Some strains -- like the C strain that caused outbreaks in teenagers in the UK in the 90s -- are considerably more virulent, with very little asymptomatic carriage. (The virulence genes are unrelated to the capsular phenotype, and capsular switching, maintaining the same virulence factors, is possible and appears to have happened with the increase in W serogroup disease in the UK, for example.[1])\nd. For the less virulent strains at least...\ne. When somebody becomes ill, it could be because of individual factors (the case was unusually susceptible -- for underlying reasons, such as inherited complement deficiencies, or because of an unfortunate timing eg recent viral infection); or because of pathogen associated factors -- the organism had evolved to become more than usually virulent.\nf. Given the high carriage rates, there's little point in chemoprophylaxis for normally virulent organisms.\ng. So chemoprophylaxis is based on the hypothesis that the case may have acquired their infection from a healthy carrier of a more virulent organism. The purpose is to eliminate carriage of this organism. The contacts targeted are therefore those from whom the case is most likely to have acquired their infection. (There is very little evidence of benefit for treating other people exposed to the case.)\nh. There is also a hypothesis -- supported, I believe, by some evidence -- that healthy carriers of meningococci and related organisms (such as _N. lactamica_) can benefit from \"competitive inhibition\". This means that the presence of the organism they are carrying reduces their chances of acquiring a new, potentially more virulent strain - see b. above.\ni. For this reason, extending chemoprophylaxis to people other than those from whom the case acquired their infection might do more harm than good (by increasing people's susceptibility to new infections).\n\n1.

Protection against invasive meningococcal disease is conferred mainly by complement-mediated antibody-dependent killing of _Neisseria meningitidis_. Studies that tested in an in vitro bactericidal assay against serogroup C, W and Y meningococci using sera collected in the UK, Germany, France and Brazil from individuals immunized with one of the B serogroup vaccines found that sera from was bactericidal \"in a range from 45 per cent to 90 per cent\" (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4755123/#R11), the preliminary data having been presented in poster sessions.\n\nHowever, on the basis of what we know for sure at present, \"experts from the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\" (http://www.immunize.org/askexperts/experts_meningococcal_b.asp), say that meningococcal polysaccharide and conjugate vaccines \"provide no protection against serogroup B disease, and meningococcal serogroup B vaccines (MenB) provide no protection against serogroup A, C, W, or Y disease. For protection against all 5 serogroups of meningococcus, it is necessary to receive MenACWY or MPSV4 and MenB.\" And the CDC's recommendations (https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/vis/vis-statements/mening-serogroup.html) clearly state, \"Serogroup B meningococcal (MenB) vaccines can help prevent meningococcal disease caused by serogroup B. Other meningococcal vaccines are recommended to help protect against serogroups A, C, W, and Y.\"\n\nIn regard to antimicrobial chemoprophylaxis, its rationale for close contacts of cases of meningococcal disease is based on the high attack rate of secondary meningococcal disease among these contacts, which has been estimated to be 500-800 times greater than for the general population (https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00046263.htm). Because the attack rate for close contacts is highest during the 1st few days after onset of disease in the primary patient, antimicrobial chemoprophylaxis should be administered as soon as possible. - Mod.ML]\nSee Also\nMeningitis, meningococcal - Taiwan: fatal, military base 20170801.5218924\n.................................................ml/ec/sh", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "meningitis"], "syndromes": ["meningitis"], "event_date": ["2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2015-07-16 00:00:00", "2016-01-16 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "MILITARY", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "TAIWAN", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "ABCWY", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Germany", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "France", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "United Kingdom", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "USA", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "UK", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "England", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Brazil", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "abcwy", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "FATAL", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Taiwan", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "5287927", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Meningitis - Yemen: susp. bacterial, not, RFI", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=5287927", "date": "2017-08-05 14:56:51", "main_text": "MENINGITIS, MENINGOCOCCAL - TAIWAN (02): FATAL, MILITARY BASE, COMMENT\n**********************************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Wed 2 Aug 2017\nFrom: Peter M B English <peter.english@phe.gov.uk> [edited]\n\n\nI was particularly interested to see this report from Taiwan, having just been involved in a vaccination programme in response to 3 cases of meningococcal disease at the University of Surrey (Guildford, United Kingdom).\n\nA few points...\n1. Do we know what strain(s) of meningococcal disease the Taiwan cases had? Were they all the same? If the organisms are distinguishable, we would not consider this an outbreak but, rather, a cluster.\n2. Much of the evidence on which chemoprophylaxis policies are based is now rather old. At the time, it was far more common for students to live in \"dormitories\", with 2 or more students sharing a bedroom. Now -- at least in the UK -- this is extremely unusual: most student accommodation has only one student (or couple) per bedroom - no sharing with a relative stranger. A high proportion even have en-suite bathroom facilities. Is that the same in USA? Perhaps the Taiwanese military provides less comfortable lodgings!\n3. What is the basis for the moderator's comment that \"The choice of vaccine will depend on knowing the serogroup of the outbreak strain, because the quadrivalent (ACYW) meningococcal vaccine will cover serogroups A, C, Y, and W, and the serogroup B vaccine will cover only serogroup B, without cross-coverage.\" I'm particularly interested in the comment that the \"serogroup B vaccine will only cover...\". Since the so-called serogroup B vaccines do not use the polysaccharide capsule ABCWY antigens, but rather antigens from different part of the organism, they are independent of the ABCWY antigens, and the group B vaccines can be expected to be effective against meningococci independent of the ABCWY classification.\n4. Experience with these new so-called serogroup B vaccines remains limited. At present we do not have evidence to clarify the extent of \"herd immunity\" they will provide, but we have some evidence to suggest that they prevent disease (invasion), but not colonization (infection), and are therefore unlikely to have a significant effect on herd immunity.\n5.

Their number reached 200 by [18 Jun 2017], reports local News.ro.\n\nMoreover, 18 young people were admitted to the Hospital for Infectious Diseases in Brasov, on suspicion of meningitis. One of them was diagnosed with this disease.\n\nMeanwhile, the authorities disinfected the high school where the young boy was a student, as well as the Pediatric Hospital, which doesn't have a department for infectious diseases.\n\nThe 17-year-old student who died last week [15 Jun 2017] was from the Tarlungeni commune, in Brasov county. He and his friends had attended a party in the Purcareni village [Brasov county] tone week before. The students started to feel bad after this party.\n\nMeningitis is an inflammation (swelling) of the protective membranes covering the brain and spinal cord. A bacterial or viral infection of the fluid surrounding the brain and spinal cord usually causes the swelling. However, injuries, cancer, certain drugs, and other types of infections can also cause meningitis, according to information posted on the website of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nMeningitis symptoms include sudden onset of fever, headache, and stiff neck, but there are also other symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, photophobia (increased sensitivity to light), and altered mental status (confusion).\n\n[Byline: Irina Marica]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The news report above says that one teenage boy has died of bacterial meningitis and 18 of his friends were hospitalized with suspected meningitis; this diagnosis was subsequently confirmed in one. However, the bacterial species that caused the disease is not specified.\n\nAcute bacterial meningitis is a rapidly progressive disease. In a patient with suspected acute bacterial meningitis, blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cultures will indicate the causative organism and its antibiotic susceptibilities. An empiric intravenous antibiotic regimen that has a spectrum broad enough to cover the most likely bacterial pathogens is started as quickly as possible until the specific bacterial etiology is known. It is vital to begin treatment as early as possible in the course of the disease, as delay may contribute significantly to morbidity and mortality. Adjunctive dexamethasone is also given before or with the 1st antibiotic dose. Once a pathogen is known, the antibiotic regimen can be tailored to the antibiotic susceptibilities of the pathogen.\n\nCommon causes of bacterial meningitis vary by age group. Outbreaks of meningitis in the community are often due to _Neisseria meningitidis_.

Malta will have to wait its turn, manufacturers say. Global demand for the vaccine outstrips supply, manufacturers say.\n\nA one-year-old baby died of [meningococcal] meningitis [serogroup] B, a disease against which vaccines are currently unavailable, this newspaper is informed. Sources said the baby died last month [January 2017] after contracting the disease that affects the lining around the brain and spinal cord. The Central Procurement and Supplies Unit (CPSU) was informed that the local agent for the meningitis B vaccine had a stock of vaccines available in a number of local pharmacies, a Health Ministry spokeswoman said.\n\nThe representatives of international pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) in Malta were in liaison with their suppliers to hasten further delivery, and the CPSU was in liaison with both companies to monitor the situation, the spokeswoman added.\n\nThe ministry was also asked about the baby's death, but no reference was made to it in its reply late yesterday [23 Feb 2017] evening.\n\nThe government does not supply the vaccine against the specific strain that affected the infant, which can, however, be purchased from private hospitals and pharmacies. Paediatricians said private hospitals had purchased the vaccine from pharmacies abroad, but these too had since run out.\n\nAccording to one paediatrician, the unavailability of such a vaccine in light of the baby's death was very worrying, particularly to parents. Another paediatrician, however, warned against the matter getting out of hand, saying the issue was not as worrying as parents were making it out to be. Babies who were not vaccinated were not in any immediate danger, he said.\n\nA spokeswoman for the local representative of GSK confirmed that the vaccine was not available and it would not be for some time. She said no fixed date had yet been given as to when a supply would be made available to the local market. According to the spokeswoman, the vaccine was in high demand all over the world, and as GSK [GlaxoSmithKline] had agreements with a number of governments abroad, supplies would be shipped to these countries 1st. At present, demand exceeded the quantity manufactured.\n\n\"It's important to understand that, in these cases, we need to stock enough for boosters, so before sufficient doses are available, this will not be made available,\" the GSK spokeswoman said.\n\nAccording to the Maltese Paediatric Association, about 10 cases of meningitis have been reported among children. The signs of meningitis are fever, severe headache, neck stiffness, vomiting, dislike of bright light and drowsiness. Infants and younger children may not always show such symptoms but, instead, feed poorly or become very lethargic.\n\n[Byline: Claire Caruana]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Although there are at least 13 _ Neisseria meningitidis_ serogroups, based on the antigenic specificity of their capsular polysaccharides, disease due to serogroups A, B, C, Y, and W is most common. Meningococcal vaccines contain capsular polysaccharide for _Neisseria meningitidis_ serogroups A, C, Y, and W, either alone or conjugated to protein. The conjugate capsular polysaccharide vaccines are preferable, because, unlike the polysaccharide vaccines, conjugate vaccines immunize infants, reduce the carriage of meningococci in the throat and thus its transmission, as well as confer a more sustained immune response, and, therefore, longer-term protection than the polysaccharide vaccines.\n\nSerogroup B vaccines are based upon meningococcal B outer membrane vesicle protein antigens, because group B polysaccharide is poorly immunogenic in humans and is a potential auto-antigen. At least 2 serogroup B meningococcal vaccines -- Bexsero (GlaxoSmithKline, GSK) and Trumenba (Pfizer) -- are available.\n\nMeningococcal disease often occurs without warning and frequently progresses rapidly to death, even when it is treated appropriately. In addition, about 10-20 percent of survivors of meningococcal disease will suffer disabilities such as hearing loss, brain damage, and amputations. Vaccines are used to prevent meningococcal disease, not treat someone already ill from the disease. Immunity following use of a meningococcal vaccine is specific for the type of capsular polysaccharide the vaccine contains regarding the A, C, Y, and W polysaccharide or conjugate vaccines or the surface proteins regarding serogroup B vaccines, with no cross-protection against infection due to other meningococcal groups.\n\nVaccines are frequently used to prevent spread of meningococcal disease in the face of an institutional or community outbreak (https://www.cdc.gov/meningococcal/downloads/interim-guidance.pdf). Antibiotics are also used to prevent spread of meningococcal disease in persons who are at high risk because they have been in close contact (coughing or kissing) or lengthy contact, especially among people living in the same household.\n\nAccording to the 2017 Malta National Immunization Schedule, meningococcal vaccines are not included in the series of vaccines for infants and children (https://health.gov.mt/en/phc/pchyhi/Pages/National-Immunisation-Schedule.aspx). In the U.S., vaccination against meningococcal disease due to serogroups A, C, Y, and W is only recommended for children aged 2 months through 10 years who are at increased risk for meningococcal disease, i.e., have complement component deficiencies, have functional or anatomic asplenia (including sickle cell disease), are in the risk group for an outbreak for which vaccination is recommended, or are traveling to or residing in regions where meningitis is epidemic or hyper-endemic (for specifics, see Table at https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6324a2.htm#Tab). The serogroup B vaccines Bexsero and Trumenba have been licensed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) only for individuals aged 10 through 25 years. However, the European Medicines Agency has approved Bexsero for use in individuals of 2 months of age and older, and Bexsero has been added to the routine childhood immunization schedule in the UK and Ireland (http://www.meningitis.org/menb-vaccine).\n\nMalta, a member of the EU, is a southern European island country consisting of an archipelago in the Mediterranean Sea, 80 km (50 miles) south of Italy, with a population of just under 450 000 residents (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malta). - Mod.ML\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/77.]\nSee Also\n2016\n----\nMeningitis, meningococcal - USA (02): (OR) college, sg B, sg B vaccine 20161123.4649319\nMeningitis, meningococcal - Australia (04): (SA) sg B and W 20161118.4639691\nMeningitis, meningococcal - Australia (02): (SA) sg.

The Central Procurement and Supplies Unit (CPSU) was informed that the local agent for the meningitis B vaccine had a stock of vaccines available in a number of local pharmacies, a Health Ministry spokeswoman said.\n\nThe representatives of international pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) in Malta were in liaison with their suppliers to hasten further delivery, and the CPSU was in liaison with both companies to monitor the situation, the spokeswoman added.\n\nThe ministry was also asked about the baby's death, but no reference was made to it in its reply late yesterday [23 Feb 2017] evening.\n\nThe government does not supply the vaccine against the specific strain that affected the infant, which can, however, be purchased from private hospitals and pharmacies. Paediatricians said private hospitals had purchased the vaccine from pharmacies abroad, but these too had since run out.\n\nAccording to one paediatrician, the unavailability of such a vaccine in light of the baby's death was very worrying, particularly to parents. Another paediatrician, however, warned against the matter getting out of hand, saying the issue was not as worrying as parents were making it out to be. Babies who were not vaccinated were not in any immediate danger, he said.\n\nA spokeswoman for the local representative of GSK confirmed that the vaccine was not available and it would not be for some time. She said no fixed date had yet been given as to when a supply would be made available to the local market. According to the spokeswoman, the vaccine was in high demand all over the world, and as GSK [GlaxoSmithKline] had agreements with a number of governments abroad, supplies would be shipped to these countries 1st. At present, demand exceeded the quantity manufactured.\n\n\"It's important to understand that, in these cases, we need to stock enough for boosters, so before sufficient doses are available, this will not be made available,\" the GSK spokeswoman said.\n\nAccording to the Maltese Paediatric Association, about 10 cases of meningitis have been reported among children. The signs of meningitis are fever, severe headache, neck stiffness, vomiting, dislike of bright light and drowsiness. Infants and younger children may not always show such symptoms but, instead, feed poorly or become very lethargic.\n\n[Byline: Claire Caruana]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Although there are at least 13 _ Neisseria meningitidis_ serogroups, based on the antigenic specificity of their capsular polysaccharides, disease due to serogroups A, B, C, Y, and W is most common. Meningococcal vaccines contain capsular polysaccharide for _Neisseria meningitidis_ serogroups A, C, Y, and W, either alone or conjugated to protein. The conjugate capsular polysaccharide vaccines are preferable, because, unlike the polysaccharide vaccines, conjugate vaccines immunize infants, reduce the carriage of meningococci in the throat and thus its transmission, as well as confer a more sustained immune response, and, therefore, longer-term protection than the polysaccharide vaccines.\n\nSerogroup B vaccines are based upon meningococcal B outer membrane vesicle protein antigens, because group B polysaccharide is poorly immunogenic in humans and is a potential auto-antigen. At least 2 serogroup B meningococcal vaccines -- Bexsero (GlaxoSmithKline, GSK) and Trumenba (Pfizer) -- are available.\n\nMeningococcal disease often occurs without warning and frequently progresses rapidly to death, even when it is treated appropriately. In addition, about 10-20 percent of survivors of meningococcal disease will suffer disabilities such as hearing loss, brain damage, and amputations. Vaccines are used to prevent meningococcal disease, not treat someone already ill from the disease. Immunity following use of a meningococcal vaccine is specific for the type of capsular polysaccharide the vaccine contains regarding the A, C, Y, and W polysaccharide or conjugate vaccines or the surface proteins regarding serogroup B vaccines, with no cross-protection against infection due to other meningococcal groups.\n\nVaccines are frequently used to prevent spread of meningococcal disease in the face of an institutional or community outbreak (https://www.cdc.gov/meningococcal/downloads/interim-guidance.pdf). Antibiotics are also used to prevent spread of meningococcal disease in persons who are at high risk because they have been in close contact (coughing or kissing) or lengthy contact, especially among people living in the same household.\n\nAccording to the 2017 Malta National Immunization Schedule, meningococcal vaccines are not included in the series of vaccines for infants and children (https://health.gov.mt/en/phc/pchyhi/Pages/National-Immunisation-Schedule.aspx). In the U.S., vaccination against meningococcal disease due to serogroups A, C, Y, and W is only recommended for children aged 2 months through 10 years who are at increased risk for meningococcal disease, i.e., have complement component deficiencies, have functional or anatomic asplenia (including sickle cell disease), are in the risk group for an outbreak for which vaccination is recommended, or are traveling to or residing in regions where meningitis is epidemic or hyper-endemic (for specifics, see Table at https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6324a2.htm#Tab). The serogroup B vaccines Bexsero and Trumenba have been licensed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) only for individuals aged 10 through 25 years. However, the European Medicines Agency has approved Bexsero for use in individuals of 2 months of age and older, and Bexsero has been added to the routine childhood immunization schedule in the UK and Ireland (http://www.meningitis.org/menb-vaccine).\n\nMalta, a member of the EU, is a southern European island country consisting of an archipelago in the Mediterranean Sea, 80 km (50 miles) south of Italy, with a population of just under 450 000 residents (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malta). - Mod.ML\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/77.]\nSee Also\n2016\n----\nMeningitis, meningococcal - USA (02): (OR) college, sg B, sg B vaccine 20161123.4649319\nMeningitis, meningococcal - Australia (04): (SA) sg B and W 20161118.4639691\nMeningitis, meningococcal - Australia (02): (SA) sg.

In addition, about 10-20 percent of survivors of meningococcal disease will suffer disabilities such as hearing loss, brain damage, and amputations. Vaccines are used to prevent meningococcal disease, not treat someone already ill from the disease. Immunity following use of a meningococcal vaccine is specific for the type of capsular polysaccharide the vaccine contains regarding the A, C, Y, and W polysaccharide or conjugate vaccines or the surface proteins regarding serogroup B vaccines, with no cross-protection against infection due to other meningococcal groups.\n\nVaccines are frequently used to prevent spread of meningococcal disease in the face of an institutional or community outbreak (https://www.cdc.gov/meningococcal/downloads/interim-guidance.pdf). Antibiotics are also used to prevent spread of meningococcal disease in persons who are at high risk because they have been in close contact (coughing or kissing) or lengthy contact, especially among people living in the same household.\n\nAccording to the 2017 Malta National Immunization Schedule, meningococcal vaccines are not included in the series of vaccines for infants and children (https://health.gov.mt/en/phc/pchyhi/Pages/National-Immunisation-Schedule.aspx). In the U.S., vaccination against meningococcal disease due to serogroups A, C, Y, and W is only recommended for children aged 2 months through 10 years who are at increased risk for meningococcal disease, i.e., have complement component deficiencies, have functional or anatomic asplenia (including sickle cell disease), are in the risk group for an outbreak for which vaccination is recommended, or are traveling to or residing in regions where meningitis is epidemic or hyper-endemic (for specifics, see Table at https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6324a2.htm#Tab). The serogroup B vaccines Bexsero and Trumenba have been licensed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) only for individuals aged 10 through 25 years. However, the European Medicines Agency has approved Bexsero for use in individuals of 2 months of age and older, and Bexsero has been added to the routine childhood immunization schedule in the UK and Ireland (http://www.meningitis.org/menb-vaccine).\n\nMalta, a member of the EU, is a southern European island country consisting of an archipelago in the Mediterranean Sea, 80 km (50 miles) south of Italy, with a population of just under 450 000 residents (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malta). - Mod.ML\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/77.]\nSee Also\n2016\n----\nMeningitis, meningococcal - USA (02): (OR) college, sg B, sg B vaccine 20161123.4649319\nMeningitis, meningococcal - Australia (04): (SA) sg B and W 20161118.4639691\nMeningitis, meningococcal - Australia (02): (SA) sg.

Babies who were not vaccinated were not in any immediate danger, he said.\n\nA spokeswoman for the local representative of GSK confirmed that the vaccine was not available and it would not be for some time. She said no fixed date had yet been given as to when a supply would be made available to the local market. According to the spokeswoman, the vaccine was in high demand all over the world, and as GSK [GlaxoSmithKline] had agreements with a number of governments abroad, supplies would be shipped to these countries 1st. At present, demand exceeded the quantity manufactured.\n\n\"It's important to understand that, in these cases, we need to stock enough for boosters, so before sufficient doses are available, this will not be made available,\" the GSK spokeswoman said.\n\nAccording to the Maltese Paediatric Association, about 10 cases of meningitis have been reported among children. The signs of meningitis are fever, severe headache, neck stiffness, vomiting, dislike of bright light and drowsiness.

However, the European Medicines Agency has approved Bexsero for use in individuals of 2 months of age and older, and Bexsero has been added to the routine childhood immunization schedule in the UK and Ireland (http://www.meningitis.org/menb-vaccine).\n\nMalta, a member of the EU, is a southern European island country consisting of an archipelago in the Mediterranean Sea, 80 km (50 miles) south of Italy, with a population of just under 450 000 residents (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malta). - Mod.ML\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/77.]\nSee Also\n2016\n----\nMeningitis, meningococcal - USA (02): (OR) college, sg B, sg B vaccine 20161123.4649319\nMeningitis, meningococcal - Australia (04): (SA) sg B and W 20161118.4639691\nMeningitis, meningococcal - Australia (02): (SA) sg.

Type B [_Neisseria meningitidis_ serogroup B] caused the other 3.\n\nMeningococcal disease is a rare, life-threatening illness caused by a bacterial infection of the blood or the membranes that line the spinal cord and brain.\n\nA young WA child -- the 12th case this year [2016] -- died from the disease last week. In the past, there have been virtually no local cases caused by W strains, but there were 2 in 2014, 4 cases last year [2015] and 9 this year. The WA Health Department said this week it was monitoring the trend, which was also being seen in states including Victoria and could have implications for vaccination recommendations.\n\nVictorian authorities have seen a sharp rise in a group W strain known as ST11, which was responsible for 4 per cent of meningococcal cases in 2013 but 30 percent of cases last year [2015].\n\nAt present, a vaccine to protect against type C meningococcal disease, historically the most common in Australia, is free for children and given at 12 months [of age]. A vaccine against meningococcal B, the most common type in WA [the 1st paragraph above says that this year [2016] serogroup W, not serogroup B, is the most common serogroup], is available but not government-funded. There is a privately funded vaccine against W strains, but it is usually only advised for overseas travellers.\n\nThe Health Department spokesman said that while the overall number of invasive meningococcal disease cases in WA had been falling since 2000, there had been a recent increase in cases linked to W strains.\n\nThe Telethon Kids Institute is doing a trial of a vaccine against the A, C, W and Y strains in young children.\n\n[Byline: Cathy O'Leary]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[_Neisseria meningitidis_ only infects humans; there is no animal reservoir, and the organism dies quickly outside the human host. _N. meningitidis_ colonizes the mucosal membranes of the nose and throat; up to 5-10 percent of a population may be asymptomatic nasopharyngeal carriers, but the carrier rate may be higher in epidemic situations. Droplets of nasopharyngeal secretions from these carriers are responsible for the spread of the disease. Close and prolonged contact with an infected person or a carrier facilitates the spread of the disease. The average incubation period is 4 days but can range between 2 and 10 days.\n\nImmunity following use of a meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine is specific for the type of capsular polysaccharide that the vaccine contains, with no cross-protection against infection due to other meningococcal polysaccharide groups. Although there are at least 13 _N. meningitidis_ serogroups, based on the antigenic specificity of their capsular polysaccharides, disease due to serogroups A, B, C, Y, and W135 are most common.\n\nThere are vaccines that contain capsular polysaccharide (A, C, Y, W135), either alone or conjugated to protein. Conjugate vaccines are preferable, because, unlike the polysaccharide vaccines, conjugate vaccines immunize infants, reduce the carriage of meningococci in the throat and thus its transmission, as well as confer a more sustained immune response, and, therefore, longer-term protection than the polysaccharide vaccines. Serogroup B vaccines are based upon meningococcal B protein antigens, because group B polysaccharide is poorly immunogenic in humans and is a potential auto-antigen.\n\nFollowing the mass introduction into the population of a vaccine specific for one particular serogroup, the incidence of disease due to that serogroup has been found to fall dramatically, e.g., serogroup C disease in the UK following the introduction of C vaccine and serogroup A in the African Meningitis Belt following A vaccine, only to be replaced by emergence of disease due to other meningococcal serogroups.\n\nSimilarly, serotype replacement has been observed following pneumococcal vaccination programs, which necessitated expansion of serotypes covered by the vaccine (see ProMED-mail post Streptococcus pneumoniae, non-vaccine strain emergence - USA (AK) 20070425.1348).\n\nBecause of the replacement of serogroup C by serogroup W ST-11 as a cause of invasive meningococcal disease in the UK, the UK is now offering an expanded conjugated serogroup vaccine, Men ACWY, for adolescents, who are more likely to carry meningococcal bacteria than any other age group, to stop the spread of serogroup W.

Type B [_Neisseria meningitidis_ serogroup B] caused the other 3.\n\nMeningococcal disease is a rare, life-threatening illness caused by a bacterial infection of the blood or the membranes that line the spinal cord and brain.\n\nA young WA child -- the 12th case this year [2016] -- died from the disease last week. In the past, there have been virtually no local cases caused by W strains, but there were 2 in 2014, 4 cases last year [2015] and 9 this year. The WA Health Department said this week it was monitoring the trend, which was also being seen in states including Victoria and could have implications for vaccination recommendations.\n\nVictorian authorities have seen a sharp rise in a group W strain known as ST11, which was responsible for 4 per cent of meningococcal cases in 2013 but 30 percent of cases last year [2015].\n\nAt present, a vaccine to protect against type C meningococcal disease, historically the most common in Australia, is free for children and given at 12 months [of age]. A vaccine against meningococcal B, the most common type in WA [the 1st paragraph above says that this year [2016] serogroup W, not serogroup B, is the most common serogroup], is available but not government-funded. There is a privately funded vaccine against W strains, but it is usually only advised for overseas travellers.\n\nThe Health Department spokesman said that while the overall number of invasive meningococcal disease cases in WA had been falling since 2000, there had been a recent increase in cases linked to W strains.\n\nThe Telethon Kids Institute is doing a trial of a vaccine against the A, C, W and Y strains in young children.\n\n[Byline: Cathy O'Leary]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[_Neisseria meningitidis_ only infects humans; there is no animal reservoir, and the organism dies quickly outside the human host. _N. meningitidis_ colonizes the mucosal membranes of the nose and throat; up to 5-10 percent of a population may be asymptomatic nasopharyngeal carriers, but the carrier rate may be higher in epidemic situations. Droplets of nasopharyngeal secretions from these carriers are responsible for the spread of the disease. Close and prolonged contact with an infected person or a carrier facilitates the spread of the disease. The average incubation period is 4 days but can range between 2 and 10 days.\n\nImmunity following use of a meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine is specific for the type of capsular polysaccharide that the vaccine contains, with no cross-protection against infection due to other meningococcal polysaccharide groups. Although there are at least 13 _N. meningitidis_ serogroups, based on the antigenic specificity of their capsular polysaccharides, disease due to serogroups A, B, C, Y, and W135 are most common.\n\nThere are vaccines that contain capsular polysaccharide (A, C, Y, W135), either alone or conjugated to protein. Conjugate vaccines are preferable, because, unlike the polysaccharide vaccines, conjugate vaccines immunize infants, reduce the carriage of meningococci in the throat and thus its transmission, as well as confer a more sustained immune response, and, therefore, longer-term protection than the polysaccharide vaccines.

Serogroup A meningococcus has been the main cause of epidemic meningococcal disease in this region (http://www.who.int/csr/resources/publications/meningitis/whoemcbac983.pdf). However, since the introduction of the meningococcal A conjugate vaccine in countries of the African meningitis belt in 2010, the WHO noted a decrease in the number of cases of meningitis; in fact, the number of cases in 2013 was the lowest recorded during the epidemic season in the last 10 years (http://www.who.int/csr/don/2013_06_06_menin/en/). In addition, _Neisseria meningitidis_ serogroup A was noted to be no longer the predominant pathogen.\n\nWe are not told the microbial etiology of the meningitis outbreak in Morocco and Morocco is not part of the African meningitis belt, but the occurrence of serogroup A meningococcus outbreaks in Morocco in 1987 and 1989 may have been provoked by the introduction of a virulent strain of serogroup A meningococcus imported by returning pilgrims. ProMED-mail would appreciate more information on this current outbreak in Morocco from knowledgeable sources.\n\nTinghir, with a population of 36 000 according to the 2004 census, is a city in central Morocco (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinghir).

The CDC has been working with the Food and Drug Administration about gaining access to this particular vaccine, CDC spokeswoman Barbara Reynolds told CNN. \"We just got the approval from FDA this week to import the vaccine under the Investigational New Drug Application program,\" Reynolds said, \"Now we're consulting with the Princeton University officials and New Jersey Health Department officials about the next step.\"\n\nMeningococcal meningitis is caused by a bacteria called _N. meningitidis_ that can infect the lining of the brain and spinal cord.

Mbugua would not talk about the nature of those discussions or what day they would be held. \"I will not pre-empt the trustees' discussion by talking about it beforehand,\" he said.\n\nReynolds said she did not have a timetable for how quickly the vaccine could be available. Its use would be optional for students at Princeton, she said. The most recent case at the school was diagnosed last Sunday, Mbugua said. Six of those affected are students, and one was a visitor, he said.\n\nThe student who most recently became ill remains hospitalized, according to the New Jersey Department of Health. Five other students have recovered, and the visitor's case is being followed by another state health department. The 1st case was reported in March 2013.\n\nMeningitis is a serious disease that is spread through coughing and exchanges of saliva, and people living in dormitories or other crowded living quarters are especially at risk. There is a vaccine available in the United States for other strains of the disease, Reynolds said. The CDC recommends the vaccine for children and students before they head off to college.\n\nBacterial meningitis can cause the membranes covering the brain and spinal cord to swell. The most severe cases can result in death, hearing loss, brain damage, kidney disease or require the amputation of limbs. Symptoms include fever, headaches and stiff neck.\n\n[Byline: Noreen O'Donnell, Colleen Jenkins, Eric Beech]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[For a discussion of invasive meningococcal disease on a college campus, see moderator ML's comments in ProMED-mail Meningitis, meningococcal - USA: (PA) 20090218.0674.\n\nThe annual incidence has been 0.3-1.1 per 100 000 persons, or approximately 1400 to 2800 cases, which usually occur as either sporadic cases or at times as outbreaks, usually in closed communities (e.g., college students living in dormitories, particularly freshman, and new military recruits). The highest incidence of meningococcal disease occurs in infants, with a secondary peak in adolescents.\n\n13 serogroups of _Neisseria meningitidis_, the cause of invasive meningococcal disease, have been identified based on the bacterial outer polysaccharide capsule, of which 5 serogroups, A, B, C, W-135, and Y, cause the majority of meningococcal disease globally. In the United States, the majority of invasive meningococcal disease is caused by serogroups B, C, W-135, and Y. However, serogroup B accounts for approximately 1/3rd of all invasive meningococcal infections and about half of invasive infections in infants.\n\nThe CDC recommends the meningococcal conjugate vaccination for college students and any persons aged 11 to 18 years, military recruits, microbiologists who are routinely exposed to isolates of _N. meningitidis_, persons who travel to Mecca during the annual Hajj or to countries in which _N. meningitidis_ is hyper-endemic or epidemic, particularly if contact with the local population will be prolonged, persons who have terminal complement component deficiencies, and persons who have anatomic or functional asplenia [without normal spleen function] (http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/559807 and http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5407a1.htm). Also, in an outbreak, the population at risk should be vaccinated with the meningococcal vaccine appropriate for the serogroup causing the outbreak as soon as possible after an outbreak has been declared http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00046237.htm.\n\nAlthough there are several vaccines based on the meningococcal capsular polysaccharide that cover serogroups A, C, W-135, and Y, there has been no licensed serogroup B vaccine in the U.S. Because group B polysaccharide is poorly immunogenic in humans and is a potential auto-antigen, group B vaccines cannot be based on capsular polysaccharide. Vaccines that use outer membrane vesicle protein from an outbreak strain have been used successfully in New Zealand and Cuba to control epidemics in those countries caused by the targeted serogroup B strain, but these vaccines do not cover other strains of serogroup B organisms.\n\nThe Novartis Bexsero vaccine contains 4 antigenic components: Factor H Binding Protein (fHbp), Neisseria Heparin Binding Antigen (NHBA), Neisserial Adhesin A (NadA), and the outer membrane vesicle protein that is in the New Zealand MenB Vaccine (MenZB) derived from the New Zealand outbreak strain of MenB (strain NZ 98/254) (http://www.meningitis.org/menb-vaccine). The NZ98/254 component, which contains PorA serosubtype 1.4, was effective in a strain-specific outbreak in New Zealand. The Bexsero vaccine contains surface proteins that occur across most serogroup B strains and elicits bactericidal antibodies that can confer protective immune responses (http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2010/10/19/1013758107.full.pdf). Bexsero is the 1st and only broad coverage vaccine to help protect all age groups against serogroup B disease, including infants who are at the greatest risk of infection (Cohn AC, Messonnier ME. Inching Toward a Serogroup B Meningococcal Vaccine for Infants. JAMA 2012;307(6):614-615.; and, Stephens DS. Comment. Prevention of serogroup B meningococcal disease. Lancet 2012;379(9816):592-594).\n\nThe Bexsero vaccine side effects may include soreness at the injection site, and sometimes fever, lack of appetite, muscle aches, irritability and rashes. Almost 8000 people, including more than 5000 infants and toddlers, have had the new vaccine during clinical trials, and the side effects are said to be the usual ones expected with any of the current childhood vaccines (http://www.meningitis.org/menb-vaccine and http://www.meningitis.org/menb-vaccine#sthash.GLMd4xiU.dpuf).\n\nPrinceton University is a private university ranked either 1st or 2nd among national universities by U.S. News & World Report from 2001 to 2013, with a highly selective undergraduate program, located in Princeton, New Jersey, United States. There are 5113 undergraduates and 2479 postgraduates (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princeton_University#Organization). More than 98 percent of students live on campus in dormitories. Freshmen and sophomores must live in one of 6 residential colleges, while juniors and seniors typically live in designated upperclassman dormitories with the option of living off-campus (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princeton_University#Organization). 11 eating clubs serve as dining halls and communal spaces for their members throughout the academic year (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_club_(Princeton_University)). - Mod.ML\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/r/35Bq.]\nSee Also\n2012\n----\nMeningitis, meningococcal - USA: (CA) lab-acquired, fatal 20120505.1124002\n2009\n----\nMeningitis, meningococcal - USA: (PA) 20090218.0674\n2006\n----\nMeningococcal disease cluster - USA (NY) (02) 20060630.1808\nMeningococcal disease cluster - USA (NY): RFI 20060607.1584\n.................................................sb/ml/lm", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "meningitis"], "syndromes": ["meningitis"], "event_date": ["2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2013-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-20 00:00:00", "2013-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-01 00:00:00", "5113-03-16 00:00:00", "2479-03-16 00:00:00", "2006-03-16 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Princeton", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "U.S.", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Mecca", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Cuba", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Australia", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "United States", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "US", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "New Jersey", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "NEW JERSEY", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "New Zealand", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "the United States", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "2249691", "headline": "PRO/EDR> Meningitis, meningococcal - USA: (CA) college, sg.

Vaccines that use outer membrane vesicle protein from an outbreak strain have been used successfully in New Zealand and Cuba to control epidemics in those countries caused by the targeted serogroup B strain, but these vaccines do not cover other strains of serogroup B organisms.\n\nThe Novartis Bexsero vaccine contains 4 antigenic components: Factor H Binding Protein (fHbp), Neisseria Heparin Binding Antigen (NHBA), Neisserial Adhesin A (NadA), and the outer membrane vesicle protein that is in the New Zealand MenB Vaccine (MenZB) derived from the New Zealand outbreak strain of MenB (strain NZ 98/254) (http://www.meningitis.org/menb-vaccine). The NZ98/254 component, which contains PorA serosubtype 1.4, was effective in a strain-specific outbreak in New Zealand. The Bexsero vaccine contains surface proteins that occur across most serogroup B strains and elicits bactericidal antibodies that can confer protective immune responses (http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2010/10/19/1013758107.full.pdf). Bexsero is the 1st and only broad coverage vaccine to help protect all age groups against serogroup B disease, including infants who are at the greatest risk of infection (Cohn AC, Messonnier ME. Inching Toward a Serogroup B Meningococcal Vaccine for Infants. JAMA 2012;307(6):614-615.; and, Stephens DS. Comment. Prevention of serogroup B meningococcal disease. Lancet 2012;379(9816):592-594).\n\nThe Bexsero vaccine side effects may include soreness at the injection site, and sometimes fever, lack of appetite, muscle aches, irritability and rashes. Almost 8000 people, including more than 5000 infants and toddlers, have had the new vaccine during clinical trials, and the side effects are said to be the usual ones expected with any of the current childhood vaccines (http://www.meningitis.org/menb-vaccine and http://www.meningitis.org/menb-vaccine#sthash.GLMd4xiU.dpuf).\n\nPrinceton University is a private university ranked either 1st or 2nd among national universities by U.S. News & World Report from 2001 to 2013, with a highly selective undergraduate program, located in Princeton, New Jersey, United States. There are 5113 undergraduates and 2479 postgraduates (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princeton_University#Organization). More than 98 percent of students live on campus in dormitories. Freshmen and sophomores must live in one of 6 residential colleges, while juniors and seniors typically live in designated upperclassman dormitories with the option of living off-campus (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princeton_University#Organization). 11 eating clubs serve as dining halls and communal spaces for their members throughout the academic year (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_club_(Princeton_University)). - Mod.ML\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/r/35Bq.]\nSee Also\n2012\n----\nMeningitis, meningococcal - USA: (CA) lab-acquired, fatal 20120505.1124002\n2009\n----\nMeningitis, meningococcal - USA: (PA) 20090218.0674\n2006\n----\nMeningococcal disease cluster - USA (NY) (02) 20060630.1808\nMeningococcal disease cluster - USA (NY): RFI 20060607.1584\n.................................................sb/ml/lm", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "meningitis"], "syndromes": ["meningitis"], "event_date": ["2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2013-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-20 00:00:00", "2013-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-01 00:00:00", "5113-03-16 00:00:00", "2479-03-16 00:00:00", "2006-03-16 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Princeton", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "U.S.", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Mecca", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Cuba", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Australia", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "United States", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "US", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "New Jersey", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "NEW JERSEY", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "New Zealand", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "the United States", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "2089794", "headline": "PRO/EDR> Meningitis, meningococcal - USA (07): (CA,NJ) college, add'l case, new vaccine", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=2089794", "date": "2013-11-17 18:27:26", "main_text": "MENINGITIS, MENINGOCOCCAL - USA (03): (NEW JERSEY), COLLEGE, SEROGROUP B, NEW VACCINE\n*************************************************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n[1]\nDate: Sat 16 Nov 2013\nSource: The Global Dispatch [edited]\nhttp://www.theglobaldispatch.com/princeton-considers-the-use-of-bexsero-meningitis-vaccine-to-curb-spread-of-meningitis-b-60884/\n\n\nFollowing the 7th confirmed case of _Neisseria meningitidis_ [serogroup] B infection at Princeton University since March 2013, the school is considering the use of a European Union/Australia-approved vaccine that will protect against this strain of the potentially lethal infection.\n\nCBS New York reports that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has offered the school to use the Novartis vaccine, Bexsero. The CDC has been working with the Food and Drug Administration about gaining access to this particular vaccine, CDC spokeswoman Barbara Reynolds told CNN. \"We just got the approval from FDA this week to import the vaccine under the Investigational New Drug Application program,\" Reynolds said, \"Now we're consulting with the Princeton University officials and New Jersey Health Department officials about the next step.\"\n\nMeningococcal meningitis is caused by a bacteria called _N. meningitidis_ that can infect the lining of the brain and spinal cord.

Mbugua would not talk about the nature of those discussions or what day they would be held. \"I will not pre-empt the trustees' discussion by talking about it beforehand,\" he said.\n\nReynolds said she did not have a timetable for how quickly the vaccine could be available. Its use would be optional for students at Princeton, she said. The most recent case at the school was diagnosed last Sunday, Mbugua said. Six of those affected are students, and one was a visitor, he said.\n\nThe student who most recently became ill remains hospitalized, according to the New Jersey Department of Health. Five other students have recovered, and the visitor's case is being followed by another state health department. The 1st case was reported in March 2013.\n\nMeningitis is a serious disease that is spread through coughing and exchanges of saliva, and people living in dormitories or other crowded living quarters are especially at risk. There is a vaccine available in the United States for other strains of the disease, Reynolds said. The CDC recommends the vaccine for children and students before they head off to college.\n\nBacterial meningitis can cause the membranes covering the brain and spinal cord to swell. The most severe cases can result in death, hearing loss, brain damage, kidney disease or require the amputation of limbs. Symptoms include fever, headaches and stiff neck.\n\n[Byline: Noreen O'Donnell, Colleen Jenkins, Eric Beech]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[For a discussion of invasive meningococcal disease on a college campus, see moderator ML's comments in ProMED-mail Meningitis, meningococcal - USA: (PA) 20090218.0674.\n\nThe annual incidence has been 0.3-1.1 per 100 000 persons, or approximately 1400 to 2800 cases, which usually occur as either sporadic cases or at times as outbreaks, usually in closed communities (e.g., college students living in dormitories, particularly freshman, and new military recruits). The highest incidence of meningococcal disease occurs in infants, with a secondary peak in adolescents.\n\n13 serogroups of _Neisseria meningitidis_, the cause of invasive meningococcal disease, have been identified based on the bacterial outer polysaccharide capsule, of which 5 serogroups, A, B, C, W-135, and Y, cause the majority of meningococcal disease globally.

The CDC has been working with the Food and Drug Administration about gaining access to this particular vaccine, CDC spokeswoman Barbara Reynolds told CNN. \"We just got the approval from FDA this week to import the vaccine under the Investigational New Drug Application program,\" Reynolds said, \"Now we're consulting with the Princeton University officials and New Jersey Health Department officials about the next step.\"\n\nMeningococcal meningitis is caused by a bacteria called _N. meningitidis_ that can infect the lining of the brain and spinal cord.

Mbugua would not talk about the nature of those discussions or what day they would be held. \"I will not pre-empt the trustees' discussion by talking about it beforehand,\" he said.\n\nReynolds said she did not have a timetable for how quickly the vaccine could be available. Its use would be optional for students at Princeton, she said. The most recent case at the school was diagnosed last Sunday, Mbugua said. Six of those affected are students, and one was a visitor, he said.\n\nThe student who most recently became ill remains hospitalized, according to the New Jersey Department of Health. Five other students have recovered, and the visitor's case is being followed by another state health department. The 1st case was reported in March 2013.\n\nMeningitis is a serious disease that is spread through coughing and exchanges of saliva, and people living in dormitories or other crowded living quarters are especially at risk. There is a vaccine available in the United States for other strains of the disease, Reynolds said. The CDC recommends the vaccine for children and students before they head off to college.\n\nBacterial meningitis can cause the membranes covering the brain and spinal cord to swell. The most severe cases can result in death, hearing loss, brain damage, kidney disease or require the amputation of limbs. Symptoms include fever, headaches and stiff neck.\n\n[Byline: Noreen O'Donnell, Colleen Jenkins, Eric Beech]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[For a discussion of invasive meningococcal disease on a college campus, see moderator ML's comments in ProMED-mail Meningitis, meningococcal - USA: (PA) 20090218.0674.\n\nThe annual incidence has been 0.3-1.1 per 100 000 persons, or approximately 1400 to 2800 cases, which usually occur as either sporadic cases or at times as outbreaks, usually in closed communities (e.g., college students living in dormitories, particularly freshman, and new military recruits). The highest incidence of meningococcal disease occurs in infants, with a secondary peak in adolescents.\n\n13 serogroups of _Neisseria meningitidis_, the cause of invasive meningococcal disease, have been identified based on the bacterial outer polysaccharide capsule, of which 5 serogroups, A, B, C, W-135, and Y, cause the majority of meningococcal disease globally. In the United States, the majority of invasive meningococcal disease is caused by serogroups B, C, W-135, and Y. However, serogroup B accounts for approximately 1/3rd of all invasive meningococcal infections and about half of invasive infections in infants.\n\nThe CDC recommends the meningococcal conjugate vaccination for college students and any persons aged 11 to 18 years, military recruits, microbiologists who are routinely exposed to isolates of _N. meningitidis_, persons who travel to Mecca during the annual Hajj or to countries in which _N. meningitidis_ is hyper-endemic or epidemic, particularly if contact with the local population will be prolonged, persons who have terminal complement component deficiencies, and persons who have anatomic or functional asplenia [without normal spleen function] (http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/559807 and http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5407a1.htm). Also, in an outbreak, the population at risk should be vaccinated with the meningococcal vaccine appropriate for the serogroup causing the outbreak as soon as possible after an outbreak has been declared http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00046237.htm.\n\nAlthough there are several vaccines based on the meningococcal capsular polysaccharide that cover serogroups A, C, W-135, and Y, there has been no licensed serogroup B vaccine in the U.S. Because group B polysaccharide is poorly immunogenic in humans and is a potential auto-antigen, group B vaccines cannot be based on capsular polysaccharide. Vaccines that use outer membrane vesicle protein from an outbreak strain have been used successfully in New Zealand and Cuba to control epidemics in those countries caused by the targeted serogroup B strain, but these vaccines do not cover other strains of serogroup B organisms.\n\nThe Novartis Bexsero vaccine contains 4 antigenic components: Factor H Binding Protein (fHbp), Neisseria Heparin Binding Antigen (NHBA), Neisserial Adhesin A (NadA), and the outer membrane vesicle protein that is in the New Zealand MenB Vaccine (MenZB) derived from the New Zealand outbreak strain of MenB (strain NZ 98/254) (http://www.meningitis.org/menb-vaccine). The NZ98/254 component, which contains PorA serosubtype 1.4, was effective in a strain-specific outbreak in New Zealand. The Bexsero vaccine contains surface proteins that occur across most serogroup B strains and elicits bactericidal antibodies that can confer protective immune responses (http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2010/10/19/1013758107.full.pdf). Bexsero is the 1st and only broad coverage vaccine to help protect all age groups against serogroup B disease, including infants who are at the greatest risk of infection (Cohn AC, Messonnier ME. Inching Toward a Serogroup B Meningococcal Vaccine for Infants. JAMA 2012;307(6):614-615.; and, Stephens DS. Comment. Prevention of serogroup B meningococcal disease. Lancet 2012;379(9816):592-594).\n\nThe Bexsero vaccine side effects may include soreness at the injection site, and sometimes fever, lack of appetite, muscle aches, irritability and rashes. Almost 8000 people, including more than 5000 infants and toddlers, have had the new vaccine during clinical trials, and the side effects are said to be the usual ones expected with any of the current childhood vaccines (http://www.meningitis.org/menb-vaccine and http://www.meningitis.org/menb-vaccine#sthash.GLMd4xiU.dpuf).\n\nPrinceton University is a private university ranked either 1st or 2nd among national universities by U.S. News & World Report from 2001 to 2013, with a highly selective undergraduate program, located in Princeton, New Jersey, United States.

Mbugua would not talk about the nature of those discussions or what day they would be held. \"I will not pre-empt the trustees' discussion by talking about it beforehand,\" he said.\n\nReynolds said she did not have a timetable for how quickly the vaccine could be available. Its use would be optional for students at Princeton, she said. The most recent case at the school was diagnosed last Sunday, Mbugua said. Six of those affected are students, and one was a visitor, he said.\n\nThe student who most recently became ill remains hospitalized, according to the New Jersey Department of Health. Five other students have recovered, and the visitor's case is being followed by another state health department. The 1st case was reported in March 2013.\n\nMeningitis is a serious disease that is spread through coughing and exchanges of saliva, and people living in dormitories or other crowded living quarters are especially at risk. There is a vaccine available in the United States for other strains of the disease, Reynolds said. The CDC recommends the vaccine for children and students before they head off to college.\n\nBacterial meningitis can cause the membranes covering the brain and spinal cord to swell. The most severe cases can result in death, hearing loss, brain damage, kidney disease or require the amputation of limbs. Symptoms include fever, headaches and stiff neck.\n\n[Byline: Noreen O'Donnell, Colleen Jenkins, Eric Beech]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[For a discussion of invasive meningococcal disease on a college campus, see moderator ML's comments in ProMED-mail Meningitis, meningococcal - USA: (PA) 20090218.0674.\n\nThe annual incidence has been 0.3-1.1 per 100 000 persons, or approximately 1400 to 2800 cases, which usually occur as either sporadic cases or at times as outbreaks, usually in closed communities (e.g., college students living in dormitories, particularly freshman, and new military recruits). The highest incidence of meningococcal disease occurs in infants, with a secondary peak in adolescents.\n\n13 serogroups of _Neisseria meningitidis_, the cause of invasive meningococcal disease, have been identified based on the bacterial outer polysaccharide capsule, of which 5 serogroups, A, B, C, W-135, and Y, cause the majority of meningococcal disease globally. In the United States, the majority of invasive meningococcal disease is caused by serogroups B, C, W-135, and Y. However, serogroup B accounts for approximately 1/3rd of all invasive meningococcal infections and about half of invasive infections in infants.\n\nThe CDC recommends the meningococcal conjugate vaccination for college students and any persons aged 11 to 18 years, military recruits, microbiologists who are routinely exposed to isolates of _N. meningitidis_, persons who travel to Mecca during the annual Hajj or to countries in which _N. meningitidis_ is hyper-endemic or epidemic, particularly if contact with the local population will be prolonged, persons who have terminal complement component deficiencies, and persons who have anatomic or functional asplenia [without normal spleen function] (http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/559807 and http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5407a1.htm). Also, in an outbreak, the population at risk should be vaccinated with the meningococcal vaccine appropriate for the serogroup causing the outbreak as soon as possible after an outbreak has been declared http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00046237.htm.\n\nAlthough there are several vaccines based on the meningococcal capsular polysaccharide that cover serogroups A, C, W-135, and Y, there has been no licensed serogroup B vaccine in the U.S. Because group B polysaccharide is poorly immunogenic in humans and is a potential auto-antigen, group B vaccines cannot be based on capsular polysaccharide. Vaccines that use outer membrane vesicle protein from an outbreak strain have been used successfully in New Zealand and Cuba to control epidemics in those countries caused by the targeted serogroup B strain, but these vaccines do not cover other strains of serogroup B organisms.\n\nThe Novartis Bexsero vaccine contains 4 antigenic components: Factor H Binding Protein (fHbp), Neisseria Heparin Binding Antigen (NHBA), Neisserial Adhesin A (NadA), and the outer membrane vesicle protein that is in the New Zealand MenB Vaccine (MenZB) derived from the New Zealand outbreak strain of MenB (strain NZ 98/254) (http://www.meningitis.org/menb-vaccine). The NZ98/254 component, which contains PorA serosubtype 1.4, was effective in a strain-specific outbreak in New Zealand. The Bexsero vaccine contains surface proteins that occur across most serogroup B strains and elicits bactericidal antibodies that can confer protective immune responses (http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2010/10/19/1013758107.full.pdf). Bexsero is the 1st and only broad coverage vaccine to help protect all age groups against serogroup B disease, including infants who are at the greatest risk of infection (Cohn AC, Messonnier ME. Inching Toward a Serogroup B Meningococcal Vaccine for Infants. JAMA 2012;307(6):614-615.; and, Stephens DS. Comment. Prevention of serogroup B meningococcal disease. Lancet 2012;379(9816):592-594).\n\nThe Bexsero vaccine side effects may include soreness at the injection site, and sometimes fever, lack of appetite, muscle aches, irritability and rashes. Almost 8000 people, including more than 5000 infants and toddlers, have had the new vaccine during clinical trials, and the side effects are said to be the usual ones expected with any of the current childhood vaccines (http://www.meningitis.org/menb-vaccine and http://www.meningitis.org/menb-vaccine#sthash.GLMd4xiU.dpuf).\n\nPrinceton University is a private university ranked either 1st or 2nd among national universities by U.S. News & World Report from 2001 to 2013, with a highly selective undergraduate program, located in Princeton, New Jersey, United States.

According to the CDC, the man had snail soup with 5 of his friends a few days before exhibiting symptoms of headaches and neck stiffness.\n\nCDC official, Doctor Luo Yi-jun said \"he started to have fever and headaches a week to a month after eating the snail soup and his doctor found that _A. cantonensis_ had affected his brain.\" According to the CDC, the patient is still undergoing medical treatment in a hospital. Meanwhile, his friends who had snail soup with him have not shown any symptoms of infection.\n\nLuo said that snails are the primary intermediate hosts of _A. cantonensis_. Humans are incidental hosts of this roundworm, and may become infected through ingestion of larvae in raw or undercooked snails or other vectors, or from contaminated water and vegetables. \"When _A. cantonensis_ infects human brains,\" Luo said, \"the most common symptoms are headaches and neck stiffness associated with fever, confusion or altered consciousness, and vomiting.\" According to the CDC, aside from this patient, 8 out of the 9 people who were infected with _A. cantonensis_ last year [2012] had consumed snails. They all made full recoveries after receiving medical treatments.\n\nThe CDC said that people should wear gloves when handling snails and boil them for at least 3 minutes to avoid infection. _A. cantonensis_, also known as the rat lungworm, is prevalent in Southeast Asia and tropical Pacific islands.

Meanwhile, his friends who had snail soup with him have not shown any symptoms of infection.\n\nLuo said that snails are the primary intermediate hosts of _A. cantonensis_. Humans are incidental hosts of this roundworm, and may become infected through ingestion of larvae in raw or undercooked snails or other vectors, or from contaminated water and vegetables. \"When _A. cantonensis_ infects human brains,\" Luo said, \"the most common symptoms are headaches and neck stiffness associated with fever, confusion or altered consciousness, and vomiting.\" According to the CDC, aside from this patient, 8 out of the 9 people who were infected with _A. cantonensis_ last year [2012] had consumed snails. They all made full recoveries after receiving medical treatments.\n\nThe CDC said that people should wear gloves when handling snails and boil them for at least 3 minutes to avoid infection. _A. cantonensis_, also known as the rat lungworm, is prevalent in Southeast Asia and tropical Pacific islands.

The increase is mainly observed in 2 Chilean regions: the Metropolitan Region (RM), which includes Santiago, with 58 percent of cases and the region of Valparaiso with 21 percent of cases. The RM is divided into several health administrative regions; of those, 3 were mostly affected.\n\nInterestingly, in the RM 76 percent of cases were caused by serogroup W135, compared with 14 percent and 48 percent in the years 2010 and 2011, respectively. This epidemiological change is not observed in the other regions, where serogroup B is predominant.\n\nThe most affected age groups are children under the age of 5 (48 percent of cases); almost half of those are 9 months or younger. In the age group under 5 years, 55 percent of the cases are caused by serogroup W135.\n\nThe reported case fatality rate reached 20 percent (17/83) and seems to be higher than in previous years (2011: 15 percent).

By 9 Aug 2010, 114 cases had been notified. Most of the cases were\nregistered in the city and amalgamated municipality of Daugavpils and\nneighbouring territories. According to current evidence, 2 types of\nenteroviruses, coxsackie A-9 virus and echovirus 30, are the causative\nagents of the outbreak.\n\nDiscussion and conclusions\n--------------------------\nA large aseptic meningitis outbreak caused by at least 2 enteroviruses\n(coxsackie A-9 virus and echovirus 30) is still ongoing in the\nsouth-eastern part of Latvia. The epidemiological pattern of the outbreak\n(age and sex distribution of cases) corresponds to the usual characteristic\nof the enteroviral infection, with the majority of cases in males and young\nchildren or adolescents. The incidence of aseptic meningitis was high in\n2006 and 2007, and low in 2008 and 2009. Although in previous non-epidemic\nyears (2007-2009), seasonal increases of enteroviral meningitis began in\nMay to June, this year [2010] the outbreak started later, at the end of June.\n\nIn view of the seasonal character (summer-autumn) of enteroviral infections\nand taking into account reopening of schools after the summer holidays,\nfurther spread, importation, and transmission of infection to other Latvian\nregions cannot be excluded. The risk of international spread is assessed as\nnot significant. Further monitoring and data analysis are to be performed\non a regular basis.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map of Latvia can be accessed at\n<http://healthmap.org/r/02yo>. - Mod.CP]\n\n******\n[2] Serbia\nDate: Thu 12 Aug 2010\nSource: Eurosurveillance edition 2010; 15(32) [edited]\n<http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=19638>\n\n\nOngoing outbreak of aseptic meningitis associated with echovirus 30 in the\ncity of Novi Sad, Autonomous province of Vojvodina, Serbia, Jun-Jul 2010\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n[authors: G Cosic 1, P Duric 1, V Milosevic 2, J Dekic 1, G Canak 3, V\nTurkulov3\n1.

From 2 Jun to 25 Jul 2010, 80\ncases of aseptic meningitis were notified, with an incidence rate ranging\nfrom 10 to 366 per 100 000 population in different local communities. The\nmajority of cases (n=64) were aged between 2 and 15 years. Echovirus 30 was\ncultured from 2 of 4 cerebrospinal fluid specimens. The outbreak, for which\nno common source has yet been identified, is ongoing.\n\nDiscussion\n----------\nOutbreaks of aseptic enteroviral meningitis are notified in the Autonomous\nProvince of Vojvodina every 4 to 5 years. The largest previous outbreak\noccurred in 2000, with 461 cases reported that year (the incidence rate in\nthe province was 23 per 100 000 population and incidence rate in the City\nof Novi Sad was 28 per 100 000 population). Outbreaks of aseptic\nenteroviral meningitis were notified in all neighbouring countries\n(Croatia, Hungary, and Romania) in the last 2 decades. In Kosovo under\nUnited Nations Security Council Resolution 1244, an outbreak with a total\nof 878 cases of acute neurological syndrome was reported in 2006 to the\nWorld Health Organization Regional Office for Europe: enteroviral origin\nwas detected. Enteroviral meningitis outbreaks involved many communities\nthroughout other countries within Europe and also other continents.\n\nAs expected in temperate climate, the ongoing outbreak has occurred in hot\nsummer months, spreading by direct or indirect contact. Although none of\nthe common sources (contaminated food or water) has yet been implicated,\nsince viral meningitis outbreaks are sometimes associated with recreational\nuse of water, the use of public swimming pools had been considered a\npotential source of infection in this outbreak but no such exposure of\ncases has been identified.\n\nPreviously reported outbreaks of enteroviral meningitis have demonstrated a\npredominance of males in child cases, with a sex ratio of 2:1. Our findings\nare consistent with this. They are also in line with these reports that\nfind a large proportion (70 per cent) of cases under 15 years of age, but\nthere was a higher incidence rate (149 per 100 000 population) in children\naged 5-15 years.\n\nAccording to its epidemiological features, this outbreak is likely to\ncontinue towards the autumn months. No specific control measures are\navailable for non-polio enteroviruses. Good personal and communal hygiene\nis recommended (thorough hand washing as a routine practice, prompt and\nsafe disposal of waste and faeces, and prompt washing or disposal of the\nsoiled articles in preschool and nursery facilities), as well as\ndisinfection of contaminated surfaces with household cleaning products, and\navoidance of shared utensils and drinking containers. All susceptible\npeople and parents of young children are advised to ask for medical help\nimmediately when there is onset of sudden headaches, fever, nausea, and\nvomiting.\n\nA 3-step model has been suggested for diagnostic procedures in order to\nensure comprehensive diagnostic investigation, including local medical\ninvestigation and usual analysis (polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and\nserology) of acute cases, then as a 2nd step, extended analysis of\nsuspected cases by a reference laboratory for commonly recognised causative\nagents (or less common agents if indicated, such as, in returning\ntravellers), and finally identification of specific pathogens in cases with\nunknown aetiology.\n\nMonitoring circulating enteroviruses is important because individual\nserotypes have different temporal patterns of circulation and the changes\nin predominant serotypes can be accompanied by large-scale outbreaks of\nenteroviral illnesses. Environmental surveillance has been used\nsuccessfully in monitoring enterovirus circulation and assessing the extent\nor duration of epidemic non-poliovirus enteroviruses in specific populations.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map of Serbia can be accessed at\n<http://healthmap.org/r/02yq>.\n\nViral (\"aseptic\") meningitis is serious but rarely fatal in people with\nnormal immune systems. Usually, the symptoms last from 7 to 10 days and the\npatient recovers completely. Different viral infections can lead to viral\nmeningitis. But most cases, particularly during the summer and fall months,\nare caused by enteroviruses (which include enteroviruses, coxsackieviruses,\nand echoviruses). Most people who are infected with enteroviruses either\nhave no symptoms or only get a cold, rash, or mouth sores with low-grade\nfever. And, only a small number of people with enterovirus infections\ndevelop meningitis.\n\nEnteroviruses, the most common cause of viral meningitis, are most often\nspread through direct contact with an infected person's stool. The virus is\nspread through this route mainly among small children who are not yet\ntoilet trained. It can also be spread this way to adults changing the\ndiapers of an infected infant.\n\nEnteroviruses and other viruses can also be spread through direct or\nindirect contact with respiratory secretions (saliva, sputum, or nasal\nmucus) of an infected person. This usually happens through kissing or\nshaking hands with an infected person or by touching something they have\nhandled and then rubbing your own nose or mouth. The viruses can also stay\non surfaces for days and can be transferred from objects. Viruses also can\nspread directly when infected people cough or sneeze and send droplets\ncontaining the virus into the air we breathe.\n\nThe time from when a person is infected until they develop symptoms\n(incubation period) is usually between 3 and 7 days for enteroviruses. An\ninfected person is usually contagious from the time they develop symptoms\nuntil the symptoms go away. Young children and people with low immune\nsystems may spread the infection even after symptoms have resolved.

By 9 Aug 2010, 114 cases had been notified. Most of the cases were\nregistered in the city and amalgamated municipality of Daugavpils and\nneighbouring territories. According to current evidence, 2 types of\nenteroviruses, coxsackie A-9 virus and echovirus 30, are the causative\nagents of the outbreak.\n\nDiscussion and conclusions\n--------------------------\nA large aseptic meningitis outbreak caused by at least 2 enteroviruses\n(coxsackie A-9 virus and echovirus 30) is still ongoing in the\nsouth-eastern part of Latvia. The epidemiological pattern of the outbreak\n(age and sex distribution of cases) corresponds to the usual characteristic\nof the enteroviral infection, with the majority of cases in males and young\nchildren or adolescents. The incidence of aseptic meningitis was high in\n2006 and 2007, and low in 2008 and 2009. Although in previous non-epidemic\nyears (2007-2009), seasonal increases of enteroviral meningitis began in\nMay to June, this year [2010] the outbreak started later, at the end of June.\n\nIn view of the seasonal character (summer-autumn) of enteroviral infections\nand taking into account reopening of schools after the summer holidays,\nfurther spread, importation, and transmission of infection to other Latvian\nregions cannot be excluded. The risk of international spread is assessed as\nnot significant. Further monitoring and data analysis are to be performed\non a regular basis.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map of Latvia can be accessed at\n<http://healthmap.org/r/02yo>. - Mod.CP]\n\n******\n[2] Serbia\nDate: Thu 12 Aug 2010\nSource: Eurosurveillance edition 2010; 15(32) [edited]\n<http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=19638>\n\n\nOngoing outbreak of aseptic meningitis associated with echovirus 30 in the\ncity of Novi Sad, Autonomous province of Vojvodina, Serbia, Jun-Jul 2010\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n[authors: G Cosic 1, P Duric 1, V Milosevic 2, J Dekic 1, G Canak 3, V\nTurkulov3\n1.

And, only a small number of people with enterovirus infections\ndevelop meningitis.\n\nEnteroviruses, the most common cause of viral meningitis, are most often\nspread through direct contact with an infected person's stool. The virus is\nspread through this route mainly among small children who are not yet\ntoilet trained. It can also be spread this way to adults changing the\ndiapers of an infected infant.\n\nEnteroviruses and other viruses can also be spread through direct or\nindirect contact with respiratory secretions (saliva, sputum, or nasal\nmucus) of an infected person. This usually happens through kissing or\nshaking hands with an infected person or by touching something they have\nhandled and then rubbing your own nose or mouth. The viruses can also stay\non surfaces for days and can be transferred from objects. Viruses also can\nspread directly when infected people cough or sneeze and send droplets\ncontaining the virus into the air we breathe.\n\nThe time from when a person is infected until they develop symptoms\n(incubation period) is usually between 3 and 7 days for enteroviruses. An\ninfected person is usually contagious from the time they develop symptoms\nuntil the symptoms go away. Young children and people with low immune\nsystems may spread the infection even after symptoms have resolved.

The children had been taken to Mangobo and Kisangani\nhospitals, they reported.\n\nThe provincial education minister, Polydore Latigo, has decided to\nmomentarily close down Maikazo Institute. \"This is a preventive\nmeasure to allow the administrative and medical authorities to carry\nout investigation on the situation,\" he said. The mayor of Kisangani\nhas brought together all education and health partners in the town to\nfind a way to curb the spread of the disease while awaiting the\nresults of tests on the samples taken to the capital Kinshasa and\nSouth Africa to determine the type of the virus.\n\n[Byline: Xiong Tong]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[2]\nDate: Tue 8 Dec 2009\nSource: Irin (UN Integrated Regional Information Ne2rks) Africa [edited]\n<http://www.irinnews.org/report.aspx?ReportID=87364>\n\n\nAn outbreak of meningitis that killed more than a dozen students from\nthe same school last week has spread throughout the city of\nKisangani, in central Democratic Republic of Congo, officials said\nMonday [30 Nov 2009?]. The strain of the meningococcal [serogroup] C,\nwhich was confirmed last week, had infected at least 100 people\nthroughout the port city on the Congo River, said the Minister of\nHealth, August Mopipi, on 7 Dec 2009. He visited the city to assess\nwhat local leaders have called an \"epidemic\". By 6 Dec 2009,\naccording to hospital officials and the UN radio service in\nKisangani, 17 had died from the bacterial infection, all students at\nthe local Maikazo Technical Institute.\n\n\"It's a source of hope that this deadly disease remains curable,\"\nMopipi said, adding that more than 40 of the cases had been cured.\nThe minister said the government was working on distributing\nvaccinations but warned they could be \"prohibitively\" expensive.\nAccording to Kisangani mayor Guy Shilton, crisis meetings between\nhospitals, local government authorities and religious leaders had\nbeen organized and an \"emergency protocol\" had been put in place,\nproviding for the distribution of drugs. \"Once the epidemic is\ndeclared, we will attack it in every way possible,\" Shilton said.\n\nThe 1st fatalities took place at the Maikazo Technical Institute,\nwhen 9 students from the school died at end-November 2009 after being\nchecked into the local hospital. According to the UN, doctors said\nthe patients all had signs of meningitis, but it could not be\nconfirmed. A 10th student died a week ago, and the school was closed\ndown by the state minister of education. \"It's a preventative and\ntemporary measure,\" said Minister Polydor Latigo, \"but we need to\ninvestigate the problem safely.\" Andre Kitenge, a press officer for\nthe UN in Kisangani, said that while all deaths related to the\noutbreak were from the school, cases in other parts of Kisangani were\n\"prevalent\".\n\nKisangani, one of the largest cities in the Congo, lies in the middle\nof Africa's \"meningitis belt\". During the dry season, it infects\nhundreds more people than the global average of 3 per 100 000.\nAccording to the World Health Organization, an affordable vaccine is\nsupposed to be on the way, but for poor and densely populated areas\nsuch as Kisangani, it still poses a serious threat. An outbreak of\nmeningitis at the beginning of 2009 across the \"belt\" infected nearly\n25 000, according to the UN, and killed more than 1500.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Orientale is a province in the northeastern corner of the Democratic\nRepublic of Congo (DRC). The 2005 Constitution divided Orientale\nProvince into 4 new provinces: Ituri, Haut-Uele, Tshopo, and Bas-Uele\n(<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Republic_of_the_Congo>).\nThe provincial capital of Tshopo is Kisangani.\n\nEastern DRC has been the site of ongoing civil unrest. From an USAID\nreport: \"regional armed conflict across the Democratic Republic of\nthe Congo (DRC) has resulted in an estimated 5.4 million deaths since\n1998.

The strain of the meningococcal [serogroup] C,\nwhich was confirmed last week, had infected at least 100 people\nthroughout the port city on the Congo River, said the Minister of\nHealth, August Mopipi, on 7 Dec 2009. He visited the city to assess\nwhat local leaders have called an \"epidemic\". By 6 Dec 2009,\naccording to hospital officials and the UN radio service in\nKisangani, 17 had died from the bacterial infection, all students at\nthe local Maikazo Technical Institute.\n\n\"It's a source of hope that this deadly disease remains curable,\"\nMopipi said, adding that more than 40 of the cases had been cured.\nThe minister said the government was working on distributing\nvaccinations but warned they could be \"prohibitively\" expensive.\nAccording to Kisangani mayor Guy Shilton, crisis meetings between\nhospitals, local government authorities and religious leaders had\nbeen organized and an \"emergency protocol\" had been put in place,\nproviding for the distribution of drugs. \"Once the epidemic is\ndeclared, we will attack it in every way possible,\" Shilton said.\n\nThe 1st fatalities took place at the Maikazo Technical Institute,\nwhen 9 students from the school died at end-November 2009 after being\nchecked into the local hospital. According to the UN, doctors said\nthe patients all had signs of meningitis, but it could not be\nconfirmed. A 10th student died a week ago, and the school was closed\ndown by the state minister of education. \"It's a preventative and\ntemporary measure,\" said Minister Polydor Latigo, \"but we need to\ninvestigate the problem safely.\" Andre Kitenge, a press officer for\nthe UN in Kisangani, said that while all deaths related to the\noutbreak were from the school, cases in other parts of Kisangani were\n\"prevalent\".\n\nKisangani, one of the largest cities in the Congo, lies in the middle\nof Africa's \"meningitis belt\". During the dry season, it infects\nhundreds more people than the global average of 3 per 100 000.\nAccording to the World Health Organization, an affordable vaccine is\nsupposed to be on the way, but for poor and densely populated areas\nsuch as Kisangani, it still poses a serious threat. An outbreak of\nmeningitis at the beginning of 2009 across the \"belt\" infected nearly\n25 000, according to the UN, and killed more than 1500.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Orientale is a province in the northeastern corner of the Democratic\nRepublic of Congo (DRC).

The number of reported cases has\nclimbed more than 8-fold to 47 902 over the same period. About 2-3rds\nof Nigeria's 36 states are affected by the epidemic, the ministry\nsaid. Nigeria is Africa's most populous country with a population of\nmore than 140 million.\n\nUNICEF said last month [April 2009] that more than 2500 people had\nbeen killed by meningitis this year in West and Central Africa in\nwhat could be the worst epidemic for 5 years. Nigeria, Niger, Burkina\nFaso and Chad are considered Africa's high-risk zone.\n\nMeningitis is the inflammation of the tissue surrounding the brain\nand spinal cord, and can be caused by viral or bacterial infections.\nIt spreads mainly through kisses, sneezes, coughs and in close living quarters.\n\nThe meningitis death toll in Nigeria since December [2008] is almost\n50 times the number of people killed worldwide by the H1N1 swine flu\nvirus. But the speed with which it has spread underscores the\npotential dangers if swine flu reaches Africa. Basic healthcare is\nlimited in rural parts of Nigeria, where most people live on less\nthan USD 2.00 a day, despite the country's huge oil resources. Many\nNigerians fear that an outbreak of swine flu would be devastating.\nThe Health Ministry said no suspected case of swine flu had been\nrecorded in the country but that it had taken steps to contain any outbreak.\n\nThe worst recent meningitis epidemic in West and Central Africa\noccurred in 1996-97 when an estimated 100 000 people were infected in\nNigeria and 50 000 in Niger.\n\n[Byline: Camillus Eboh, Tume Ahemba, and Nick Tattersall]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED Rapporteur Brent Barrett\n\n[Numerous cases of meningococcal meningitis are reported in the\nAfrican region known as the \"Meningitis Belt\" each year during the\ndry season, between December and June, and every 8-12 years large\noutbreaks occur\n(<http://wwwn.cdc.gov/travel/yellowBookCh4-Menin.aspx>).

Many\nNigerians fear that an outbreak of swine flu would be devastating.\nThe Health Ministry said no suspected case of swine flu had been\nrecorded in the country but that it had taken steps to contain any outbreak.\n\nThe worst recent meningitis epidemic in West and Central Africa\noccurred in 1996-97 when an estimated 100 000 people were infected in\nNigeria and 50 000 in Niger.\n\n[Byline: Camillus Eboh, Tume Ahemba, and Nick Tattersall]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED Rapporteur Brent Barrett\n\n[Numerous cases of meningococcal meningitis are reported in the\nAfrican region known as the \"Meningitis Belt\" each year during the\ndry season, between December and June, and every 8-12 years large\noutbreaks occur\n(<http://wwwn.cdc.gov/travel/yellowBookCh4-Menin.aspx>). The\n\"Meningitis Belt\" extends from Senegal in the west to Ethiopia and\nEritrea in the east, and includes Nigeria\n(<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/eid/vol9no10/03-0170.htm>).\n\nNigeria seems to have been hit hardest by the outbreak this year. WHO\nreported on 11 Mar 2009 that in Nigeria there were 9086 cases with\n562 deaths from meningococcal meningitis (see ProMED post Meningitis,\nbacterial - Africa (02): Nigeria, WHO meningitis region\n20090313.1038) and that both serogroup A and W135 were involved.

The inquiry by\nMartini, an official and former director of the Izquieta Perez\nInstitute of Hygiene, began after 10 patients were diagnosed with\neosinophilic meningoencephalitis, caused by a parasite found in snails.\n\nThe symptoms were: neurological disorders, constipation, vomiting,\nnausea, abdominal pain (see graphics in original). The 1st to be\naffected were from the coastal province.

These figures are 29 per\ncent lower than those reported in the same 6 week period in 2007 (3274\ncases, 413 deaths) indicating lower levels of meningitis activity so far in\n2008.\n\nAmong countries reporting cases to the MDSC, Burkina Faso, the Central\nAfrican Republic and the Democratic Republic of the Congo have been\nreporting outbreaks since the beginning of the season. Other countries\nreporting meningitis activity without reaching the epidemic threshold at\ndistrict level include Benin, Cote d'Ivoire, Ethiopia, Ghana, Mali, Niger,\nNigeria and Togo. Cameroon and Chad have not reported any cases. Burkina\nFaso is the most affected country with a total of 1422 cases, including 204\ndeaths (case fatality ratio [CFR] 14.3 per cent) reported from 1 Jan to 10\nFeb 2008. These cases represent more than 61 per cent of all cases reported\nto MDSC in 2008 (against 64 per cent for the same period in 2007).\n\n_Neisseria meningitidis_ [seogroup] A (Nm A) was identified as the\ncausative agent in Mangodara and Sapouy districts. Vaccination was carried\nout in these districts as well as in Gaoua, targeting the 2 to 29 year old\npopulation. A cross border assessment is being carried out on the situation\nin Ivory Coast in the area neighboring Mangodara district. Although the\nepidemiological trend in Burkina Faso is similar to the one observed last\nyear [2007], the 1st 6 weeks of 2007 saw more cases reported in total as\nwell as more districts reaching the epidemic threshold (8 as against 2 in\n2008).\n\nThe Ministry of Health in the Central African Republic is launching\nreactive mass vaccination campaigns in some of the communes that have\nreached the epidemic threshold in the northern prefecture of Nana-Gribizi.\nA total of 45 cases, including 5 deaths (CFR 11.1 per cent) had been\nreported by the end of week 6, and Nm A has been identified as the\nresponsible pathogen. International partners including WHO and the\nInternational Coordination Group (ICG) are providing support for the\nvaccination campaigns.\n\nIn the Democratic Republic of the Congo, a situation assessment is being\ncarried out in Aru district (that neighbours Arua district in Uganda),\nwhere 167 cases, including 17 deaths (CFR 10.2 per cent) were reported\nduring the period from 1 Jan to 10 Feb 2008. The most affected areas\ninclude Laybo, Ariwara and Aungba health zones. The Aru district also\nexperienced an outbreak in early 2007.\n\nIn southern Sudan, a situation assessment is being carried out in areas\nwhere suspected cases were reported, including in Awerial, Bor, Jur River\nand Torit Counties. Uganda experienced an outbreak in Arua district, West\nNile region, with a total of 380 cases, including 17 deaths (CFR 4.5 per\ncent) reported from 13 Dec 2007 to 28 Jan 2008. A sharp decline in the\nweekly case count was observed following a mass vaccination campaign that\nwas implemented in week 4. No suspected cases have been reported from other\ncountries within the meningitis belt, namely Eritrea, Guinea, the Gambia,\nKenya, Mauritania and Senegal.\n\nSo far in 2008, the ICG has provided 40 000 vaccine doses, injection\nmaterial and safety disposal boxes for vaccination campaigns in the Central\nAfrican Republic. The current ICG stockpile, available for outbreak\nresponse in this meningitis season stands at 7 million doses of bivalent\npolysaccharide A/C vaccine and 3.3 million doses of trivalent\npolysaccharide vaccine A/C/W135.\n\nFor more information on submitting requests for vaccines through the ICG\nand regional meningitis surveillance, see links below.\n- International Coordinating Group (ICG) on Vaccine Provision for Epidemic\nMeningitis Control\n<http://www.who.int/csr/disease/meningococcal/icg/en/index.html>\n- Epidemiological information\n<http://www.who.int/csr/disease/meningococcal/epidemiological/en/index/html>.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[This is a nice up to date summary from WHO concerning the ongoing\nmeningococcal meningitis outbreak in the African bacterial meningitis belt.\nSee prior ProMED-mail posts listed below for more information.

These figures are 29 per\ncent lower than those reported in the same 6 week period in 2007 (3274\ncases, 413 deaths) indicating lower levels of meningitis activity so far in\n2008.\n\nAmong countries reporting cases to the MDSC, Burkina Faso, the Central\nAfrican Republic and the Democratic Republic of the Congo have been\nreporting outbreaks since the beginning of the season. Other countries\nreporting meningitis activity without reaching the epidemic threshold at\ndistrict level include Benin, Cote d'Ivoire, Ethiopia, Ghana, Mali, Niger,\nNigeria and Togo. Cameroon and Chad have not reported any cases. Burkina\nFaso is the most affected country with a total of 1422 cases, including 204\ndeaths (case fatality ratio [CFR] 14.3 per cent) reported from 1 Jan to 10\nFeb 2008. These cases represent more than 61 per cent of all cases reported\nto MDSC in 2008 (against 64 per cent for the same period in 2007).\n\n_Neisseria meningitidis_ [seogroup] A (Nm A) was identified as the\ncausative agent in Mangodara and Sapouy districts. Vaccination was carried\nout in these districts as well as in Gaoua, targeting the 2 to 29 year old\npopulation. A cross border assessment is being carried out on the situation\nin Ivory Coast in the area neighboring Mangodara district. Although the\nepidemiological trend in Burkina Faso is similar to the one observed last\nyear [2007], the 1st 6 weeks of 2007 saw more cases reported in total as\nwell as more districts reaching the epidemic threshold (8 as against 2 in\n2008).\n\nThe Ministry of Health in the Central African Republic is launching\nreactive mass vaccination campaigns in some of the communes that have\nreached the epidemic threshold in the northern prefecture of Nana-Gribizi.\nA total of 45 cases, including 5 deaths (CFR 11.1 per cent) had been\nreported by the end of week 6, and Nm A has been identified as the\nresponsible pathogen. International partners including WHO and the\nInternational Coordination Group (ICG) are providing support for the\nvaccination campaigns.\n\nIn the Democratic Republic of the Congo, a situation assessment is being\ncarried out in Aru district (that neighbours Arua district in Uganda),\nwhere 167 cases, including 17 deaths (CFR 10.2 per cent) were reported\nduring the period from 1 Jan to 10 Feb 2008. The most affected areas\ninclude Laybo, Ariwara and Aungba health zones. The Aru district also\nexperienced an outbreak in early 2007.\n\nIn southern Sudan, a situation assessment is being carried out in areas\nwhere suspected cases were reported, including in Awerial, Bor, Jur River\nand Torit Counties. Uganda experienced an outbreak in Arua district, West\nNile region, with a total of 380 cases, including 17 deaths (CFR 4.5 per\ncent) reported from 13 Dec 2007 to 28 Jan 2008. A sharp decline in the\nweekly case count was observed following a mass vaccination campaign that\nwas implemented in week 4. No suspected cases have been reported from other\ncountries within the meningitis belt, namely Eritrea, Guinea, the Gambia,\nKenya, Mauritania and Senegal.\n\nSo far in 2008, the ICG has provided 40 000 vaccine doses, injection\nmaterial and safety disposal boxes for vaccination campaigns in the Central\nAfrican Republic. The current ICG stockpile, available for outbreak\nresponse in this meningitis season stands at 7 million doses of bivalent\npolysaccharide A/C vaccine and 3.3 million doses of trivalent\npolysaccharide vaccine A/C/W135.\n\nFor more information on submitting requests for vaccines through the ICG\nand regional meningitis surveillance, see links below.\n- International Coordinating Group (ICG) on Vaccine Provision for Epidemic\nMeningitis Control\n<http://www.who.int/csr/disease/meningococcal/icg/en/index.html>\n- Epidemiological information\n<http://www.who.int/csr/disease/meningococcal/epidemiological/en/index/html>.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[This is a nice up to date summary from WHO concerning the ongoing\nmeningococcal meningitis outbreak in the African bacterial meningitis belt.\nSee prior ProMED-mail posts listed below for more information.

These figures are 29 per\ncent lower than those reported in the same 6 week period in 2007 (3274\ncases, 413 deaths) indicating lower levels of meningitis activity so far in\n2008.\n\nAmong countries reporting cases to the MDSC, Burkina Faso, the Central\nAfrican Republic and the Democratic Republic of the Congo have been\nreporting outbreaks since the beginning of the season. Other countries\nreporting meningitis activity without reaching the epidemic threshold at\ndistrict level include Benin, Cote d'Ivoire, Ethiopia, Ghana, Mali, Niger,\nNigeria and Togo. Cameroon and Chad have not reported any cases. Burkina\nFaso is the most affected country with a total of 1422 cases, including 204\ndeaths (case fatality ratio [CFR] 14.3 per cent) reported from 1 Jan to 10\nFeb 2008. These cases represent more than 61 per cent of all cases reported\nto MDSC in 2008 (against 64 per cent for the same period in 2007).\n\n_Neisseria meningitidis_ [seogroup] A (Nm A) was identified as the\ncausative agent in Mangodara and Sapouy districts. Vaccination was carried\nout in these districts as well as in Gaoua, targeting the 2 to 29 year old\npopulation. A cross border assessment is being carried out on the situation\nin Ivory Coast in the area neighboring Mangodara district. Although the\nepidemiological trend in Burkina Faso is similar to the one observed last\nyear [2007], the 1st 6 weeks of 2007 saw more cases reported in total as\nwell as more districts reaching the epidemic threshold (8 as against 2 in\n2008).\n\nThe Ministry of Health in the Central African Republic is launching\nreactive mass vaccination campaigns in some of the communes that have\nreached the epidemic threshold in the northern prefecture of Nana-Gribizi.\nA total of 45 cases, including 5 deaths (CFR 11.1 per cent) had been\nreported by the end of week 6, and Nm A has been identified as the\nresponsible pathogen. International partners including WHO and the\nInternational Coordination Group (ICG) are providing support for the\nvaccination campaigns.\n\nIn the Democratic Republic of the Congo, a situation assessment is being\ncarried out in Aru district (that neighbours Arua district in Uganda),\nwhere 167 cases, including 17 deaths (CFR 10.2 per cent) were reported\nduring the period from 1 Jan to 10 Feb 2008. The most affected areas\ninclude Laybo, Ariwara and Aungba health zones. The Aru district also\nexperienced an outbreak in early 2007.\n\nIn southern Sudan, a situation assessment is being carried out in areas\nwhere suspected cases were reported, including in Awerial, Bor, Jur River\nand Torit Counties. Uganda experienced an outbreak in Arua district, West\nNile region, with a total of 380 cases, including 17 deaths (CFR 4.5 per\ncent) reported from 13 Dec 2007 to 28 Jan 2008. A sharp decline in the\nweekly case count was observed following a mass vaccination campaign that\nwas implemented in week 4. No suspected cases have been reported from other\ncountries within the meningitis belt, namely Eritrea, Guinea, the Gambia,\nKenya, Mauritania and Senegal.\n\nSo far in 2008, the ICG has provided 40 000 vaccine doses, injection\nmaterial and safety disposal boxes for vaccination campaigns in the Central\nAfrican Republic. The current ICG stockpile, available for outbreak\nresponse in this meningitis season stands at 7 million doses of bivalent\npolysaccharide A/C vaccine and 3.3 million doses of trivalent\npolysaccharide vaccine A/C/W135.\n\nFor more information on submitting requests for vaccines through the ICG\nand regional meningitis surveillance, see links below.\n- International Coordinating Group (ICG) on Vaccine Provision for Epidemic\nMeningitis Control\n<http://www.who.int/csr/disease/meningococcal/icg/en/index.html>\n- Epidemiological information\n<http://www.who.int/csr/disease/meningococcal/epidemiological/en/index/html>.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[This is a nice up to date summary from WHO concerning the ongoing\nmeningococcal meningitis outbreak in the African bacterial meningitis belt.\nSee prior ProMED-mail posts listed below for more information.

These figures are 29 per\ncent lower than those reported in the same 6 week period in 2007 (3274\ncases, 413 deaths) indicating lower levels of meningitis activity so far in\n2008.\n\nAmong countries reporting cases to the MDSC, Burkina Faso, the Central\nAfrican Republic and the Democratic Republic of the Congo have been\nreporting outbreaks since the beginning of the season. Other countries\nreporting meningitis activity without reaching the epidemic threshold at\ndistrict level include Benin, Cote d'Ivoire, Ethiopia, Ghana, Mali, Niger,\nNigeria and Togo. Cameroon and Chad have not reported any cases. Burkina\nFaso is the most affected country with a total of 1422 cases, including 204\ndeaths (case fatality ratio [CFR] 14.3 per cent) reported from 1 Jan to 10\nFeb 2008. These cases represent more than 61 per cent of all cases reported\nto MDSC in 2008 (against 64 per cent for the same period in 2007).\n\n_Neisseria meningitidis_ [seogroup] A (Nm A) was identified as the\ncausative agent in Mangodara and Sapouy districts. Vaccination was carried\nout in these districts as well as in Gaoua, targeting the 2 to 29 year old\npopulation. A cross border assessment is being carried out on the situation\nin Ivory Coast in the area neighboring Mangodara district. Although the\nepidemiological trend in Burkina Faso is similar to the one observed last\nyear [2007], the 1st 6 weeks of 2007 saw more cases reported in total as\nwell as more districts reaching the epidemic threshold (8 as against 2 in\n2008).\n\nThe Ministry of Health in the Central African Republic is launching\nreactive mass vaccination campaigns in some of the communes that have\nreached the epidemic threshold in the northern prefecture of Nana-Gribizi.\nA total of 45 cases, including 5 deaths (CFR 11.1 per cent) had been\nreported by the end of week 6, and Nm A has been identified as the\nresponsible pathogen. International partners including WHO and the\nInternational Coordination Group (ICG) are providing support for the\nvaccination campaigns.\n\nIn the Democratic Republic of the Congo, a situation assessment is being\ncarried out in Aru district (that neighbours Arua district in Uganda),\nwhere 167 cases, including 17 deaths (CFR 10.2 per cent) were reported\nduring the period from 1 Jan to 10 Feb 2008. The most affected areas\ninclude Laybo, Ariwara and Aungba health zones. The Aru district also\nexperienced an outbreak in early 2007.\n\nIn southern Sudan, a situation assessment is being carried out in areas\nwhere suspected cases were reported, including in Awerial, Bor, Jur River\nand Torit Counties. Uganda experienced an outbreak in Arua district, West\nNile region, with a total of 380 cases, including 17 deaths (CFR 4.5 per\ncent) reported from 13 Dec 2007 to 28 Jan 2008. A sharp decline in the\nweekly case count was observed following a mass vaccination campaign that\nwas implemented in week 4. No suspected cases have been reported from other\ncountries within the meningitis belt, namely Eritrea, Guinea, the Gambia,\nKenya, Mauritania and Senegal.\n\nSo far in 2008, the ICG has provided 40 000 vaccine doses, injection\nmaterial and safety disposal boxes for vaccination campaigns in the Central\nAfrican Republic. The current ICG stockpile, available for outbreak\nresponse in this meningitis season stands at 7 million doses of bivalent\npolysaccharide A/C vaccine and 3.3 million doses of trivalent\npolysaccharide vaccine A/C/W135.\n\nFor more information on submitting requests for vaccines through the ICG\nand regional meningitis surveillance, see links below.\n- International Coordinating Group (ICG) on Vaccine Provision for Epidemic\nMeningitis Control\n<http://www.who.int/csr/disease/meningococcal/icg/en/index.html>\n- Epidemiological information\n<http://www.who.int/csr/disease/meningococcal/epidemiological/en/index/html>.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[This is a nice up to date summary from WHO concerning the ongoing\nmeningococcal meningitis outbreak in the African bacterial meningitis belt.\nSee prior ProMED-mail posts listed below for more information.

Viral or \"aseptic\"\nmeningitis, which is the most common type, is caused by an infection\nwith one of several types of viruses. In the United States, there are\nbetween 25 000 and 50 000 hospitalizations due to viral meningitis\neach year. The more common symptoms of meningitis are fever, severe\nheadache, stiff neck, bright lights hurting the eyes, drowsiness or\nconfusion, and nausea and vomiting. In babies, the symptoms may\ninclude fever, fretfulness or irritability, difficulty in awakening\nthe baby, or the baby refuses to eat.\nViral meningitis is serious but rarely fatal in persons with normal\nimmune systems. Usually, the symptoms last from 7 to 10 days, and the\npatient recovers completely. Bacterial meningitis, on the other hand,\ncan be very serious and result in disability or death if not treated\npromptly. Often, the symptoms of viral meningitis and bacterial\nmeningitis are the same. For this reason, healthcare specialists\nadvise that whenever there is suspicion of meningitis in a child, a\ndoctor should be consulted without delay.\nMany different viruses can cause meningitis. About 90 percent of\ncases of viral meningitis are caused by enteroviruses, such as\ncoxsackieviruses and echoviruses. But herpesviruses and mumps virus\ncan also cause viral meningitis. There is no specific treatment for\nviral meningitis other than supportive care. Enteroviruses are\ntransmitted by contact predominantly through direct contact with\nrespiratory and other secretions (e.g., saliva, sputum, or nasal\nmucus) of an infected person. The incubation period for enteroviruses\nis usually between 3 and 7 days. Frequent and thorough hand washing\nis the best protection from infection.\nOutbreaks of viral meningitis are frequently indicative of fecal\ncontamination of food products, deficiencies in the supply of clean\ndrinking water or the inadequate treatment and disposal of sewage.

Viral or \"aseptic\"\nmeningitis, which is the most common type, is caused by an infection\nwith one of several types of viruses. In the United States, there are\nbetween 25 000 and 50 000 hospitalizations due to viral meningitis\neach year. The more common symptoms of meningitis are fever, severe\nheadache, stiff neck, bright lights hurting the eyes, drowsiness or\nconfusion, and nausea and vomiting. In babies, the symptoms may\ninclude fever, fretfulness or irritability, difficulty in awakening\nthe baby, or the baby refuses to eat.\nViral meningitis is serious but rarely fatal in persons with normal\nimmune systems. Usually, the symptoms last from 7 to 10 days, and the\npatient recovers completely. Bacterial meningitis, on the other hand,\ncan be very serious and result in disability or death if not treated\npromptly. Often, the symptoms of viral meningitis and bacterial\nmeningitis are the same. For this reason, healthcare specialists\nadvise that whenever there is suspicion of meningitis in a child, a\ndoctor should be consulted without delay.\nMany different viruses can cause meningitis. About 90 percent of\ncases of viral meningitis are caused by enteroviruses, such as\ncoxsackieviruses and echoviruses. But herpesviruses and mumps virus\ncan also cause viral meningitis. There is no specific treatment for\nviral meningitis other than supportive care. Enteroviruses are\ntransmitted by contact predominantly through direct contact with\nrespiratory and other secretions (e.g., saliva, sputum, or nasal\nmucus) of an infected person.

Usually, experts say doctors only report\na couple of cases a year.\nViral meningitis is the less serious form of meningitis. Health\nexperts say it can be spread in a variety of ways: through water,\nthrough saliva, mucus or fecal matter of an infected person. Right\nnow, they have not isolated a common cause among the 14 cases and say\nthey are working on it. In the meantime, they hope you wash your\nhands frequently, don't eat or drink after one another [i.e. don't\nshare food and drink], and avoid swallowing water from pools, creeks\nor lakes.\nA mother in Perryville said her 8-year-old son was one of the 14\ninfected, and she immediately took him to their family doctor when he\nbegan feeling nauseous and started vomiting. \"They did a spinal tap\non him to draw out the spinal fluid and see what kind of meningitis\nhe had, and turns out, he had viral meningitis,\" she said. Her son\nwas treated at a Cape Girardeau hospital and is doing fine now, but\nshe was very worried while he was ill. \"You always think of the worst\nwhen you hear the word meningitis,\" she said. Her son is now back\nhome safe and sound.\nMeanwhile, a spokesperson for the Perry County Memorial Hospital said\npatients have been canceling their appointments for fear of\ncontracting the virus. She said to keep in mind that the virus is not\nairborne, so please do keep your scheduled appointment.\n[Byline: C. J. Cassidy]\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Brent Barrett\n[Meningitis is an illness in which there is inflammation of the\ntissues that cover the brain and spinal cord. Viral or \"aseptic\"\nmeningitis, which is the most common type, is caused by an infection\nwith one of several types of viruses. In the United States, there are\nbetween 25 000 and 50 000 hospitalizations due to viral meningitis\neach year. The more common symptoms of meningitis are fever, severe\nheadache, stiff neck, bright lights hurting the eyes, drowsiness or\nconfusion, and nausea and vomiting. In babies, the symptoms may\ninclude fever, fretfulness or irritability, difficulty in awakening\nthe baby, or the baby refuses to eat.\nViral meningitis is serious but rarely fatal in persons with normal\nimmune systems. Usually, the symptoms last from 7 to 10 days, and the\npatient recovers completely. Bacterial meningitis, on the other hand,\ncan be very serious and result in disability or death if not treated\npromptly. Often, the symptoms of viral meningitis and bacterial\nmeningitis are the same. For this reason, healthcare specialists\nadvise that whenever there is suspicion of meningitis in a child, a\ndoctor should be consulted without delay.\nMany different viruses can cause meningitis. About 90 percent of\ncases of viral meningitis are caused by enteroviruses, such as\ncoxsackieviruses and echoviruses. But herpesviruses and mumps virus\ncan also cause viral meningitis. There is no specific treatment for\nviral meningitis other than supportive care. Enteroviruses are\ntransmitted by contact predominantly through direct contact with\nrespiratory and other secretions (e.g., saliva, sputum, or nasal\nmucus) of an infected person. The incubation period for enteroviruses\nis usually between 3 and 7 days. Frequent and thorough hand washing\nis the best protection from infection.\nOutbreaks of viral meningitis are frequently indicative of fecal\ncontamination of food products, deficiencies in the supply of clean\ndrinking water or the inadequate treatment and disposal of sewage. In\nthe case of the Missouri outbreak, the source of the infection has\nnot been established so far.\nFurther information can be obtained from the U.S. CDC (Centers for\nDisease Control and Prevention) website at\n<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvrd/revb/enterovirus/viral_meningitis.htm>.\nFor the location of Perry County, Missouri, see:\n<http://www.perryvillemo.com>.\n- Mod.CP]\nSee Also\n2005\n----\nViral meningitis - USA (UT) 20050724.2137\n2003\n----\nViral meningitis update 2003 (03) 20031008.2522\nViral meningitis update 2003 (02) 20030915.2335\nViral meningitis update 2003 (01) 20030816.2047\n...........................................cp/msp/jw\n*##########################################################*\n************************************************************\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.

Most of the 20 or so\nchildren who are currently in hospital with viral meningitis are between one\nand 6 years old, Morales said.\nHe added that schools in the province of Chiriqui would remain closed to\navoid contagion, since there is no vaccine against the disease and the only\nway to prevent it is by practicing thorough personal hygiene.\nMorales said that viral meningitis is caused by an enterovirus that lodges\nin the intestinal wall, and he added that it spreads through oral contagion\nand poor hygienic practices. He described meningitis as an infection or\nswelling of the membrane that covers the brain and the spinal cord. Symptoms\nusually include severe headaches, vomiting, and neck pain and stiffness. A\nhealth official said that bacterial meningitis must be immediately treated\nwith specific antibiotics, but that there is no specific treatment for viral\nmeningitis.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[Viral meningitis is usually associated with enterovirus infection, in\nparticular, coxsackieviruses (A and B types) and some echoviruses.

The first\ncases were reported in late December 1996 and the epidemic threshold was\nreached on 5 January 1997 in Tone District. Mass immunization activities\nhave covered 159 000 persons (100% of the population) in the Tandjouare\nand Oti areas neighbouring Tone District. In other areas, efforts are\nbeing made to convince the population still reluctant towards\nvaccination.\nBurkina Faso: The epidemic threshold has been reached in 5 districts\nsince the second week of 1997. The weekly reported number of cases\ncontinued to increase; the epidemic has extended to more than 10\ndistricts and continues to spread. Intensive vaccination campaigns are\nunder way, as well as social mobilization to convince more people to be\nvaccinated in the affected areas.\nGhana: Cases have been reported from northern Ghana since the beginning\nof November 1996. The threshold was reached during the last week of\nJanuary. Since then, the epidemic has continued to spread. The weekly\nattack rates are over 15 per 100 000 population in 6 districts in the\nUpper East and Northern Regions. The population at greatest risk is\nestimated at more than 1.7 million. The national crisis committee\nmonitors the epidemic situation and determines the needs. Intensive\nvaccination campaigns are in progress. Other countries [in the region]\nhave reported sporadic cases. National health authorities have been re-\nquested to reinforce disease surveillance and initiate vaccination\nactivities as soon as the epidemic threshold is reached.\n(Based on: A report from the WHO Regional Office for Africa.)\nWER Editorial Note: An international Appeal has been launched by WHO\njointly with the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent\nSocieties, Medecins sans Frontieres and UNICEF to raise funds for the\ncontrol of meningitis in Africa in the 1997 epidemic season.

No only that, but\nelimination of these strains was durable. I'll have to look up the times in\nthe data but it was surprising. I think that the role of chemoprophylaxis (or\nthe lack of it) in populations is largely a matter of conjecture. It is true\nthat when there is no germ there is no meningitis and than certain\nantibiotics can get rid of carriage. When carriage rates are up around 30%\nantibiotics might have a role for Group B strains. The current\nrecommendations in textbooks and from the CDC et al are based on secondary\nattack rates in small groups. They are conservative and justified based on\nwhat we know about these settings. It is difficult to go beyond these data\nin a positive or negative way and be on firm ground.\n--\nJBL McClain\ne-mail: T10B9@aol.com\n[Because PROMED-EDR is for reports of disease outbreaks or emergency measures,\nin order to maintain the selectivity of EDR any further discussion on this\ntopic will now be switched to the \"regular\" PROMED list after this\nposting.
