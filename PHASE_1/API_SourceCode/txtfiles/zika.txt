To assess fetal protection, Van Rompay et al immunized nonhuman primates with a DNA vaccine before conception and then performed multiple Zika virus challenges in the first few months of pregnancy. Compared to unvaccinated controls, vaccinated animals had reduced viremia in terms of both magnitude and duration. Early fetal loss and fetal pathology was accordingly reduced. These results show that Zika virus vaccines given to women of childbearing age may help prevent damaging sequelae in offspring.\n\nAbstract\n--------\nZika virus (ZIKV) infection of pregnant women is associated with congenital Zika syndrome (CZS) and no vaccine is available, although several are being tested in clinical trials. We tested the efficacy of ZIKV DNA vaccine VRC5283 in a rhesus macaque model of congenital ZIKV infection. Most animal vaccine experiments have a set pathogen exposure several weeks or months after vaccination. In the real world, people encounter pathogens years or decades after vaccination, or may be repeatedly exposed if the virus is endemic. To more accurately mimic how this vaccine would be used, we immunized macaques before conception and then exposed them repeatedly to ZIKV during early and mid-gestation. In comparison to unimmunized animals, vaccinated animals had a significant reduction in peak magnitude and duration of maternal viremia, early fetal loss, fetal infection, and placental and fetal brain pathology. Vaccine-induced neutralizing antibody titers on the day of 1st ZIKV exposure were negatively associated with the magnitude of maternal viremia, and the absence of prolonged viremia was associated with better fetal outcomes. These data support further clinical development of ZIKV vaccine strategies to protect against negative fetal outcomes.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nMary Marshall\n<mjm2020@googlemail.org>\n\n[This vaccine looks promising for reducing Zika fetal syndrome.

NS1 expressed in the ER lumen induced ER perinuclear aggregation with an ultrastructure resembling that of the replication compartment.

We restricted the analysis to nonsmoking, nonwhite women and adjusted for maternal characteristics. Among women with antenatal Zika virus infection, we used modified Poisson regression to assess risks of having an SGA neonate and of delivering preterm, and linear regression to assess the association of infection with mean birth weight of term neonates.\n\nResults:\nOf 116 034 deliveries of singleton neonates in New York City in 2016, 251 (0.2%) were to women with antenatal Zika virus infection. A higher percentage of women with Zika virus infection delivered an SGA neonate compared with those without (11.2% vs 5.8%; adjusted relative risk [RR] 1.8; 95% CI 1.3-2.6). There was no difference in preterm birth prevalence for women with and without Zika virus infection (adjusted RR 1.0; 95% CI 0.69-1.6). Mean birth weight of term neonates born to women with Zika virus infection was 47 g less (95% I -105 to 11 g); this difference was not statistically significant in crude or adjusted analyses.\n\nConclusion:\nFor a cohort of New York City women, antenatal Zika virus infection was associated with an increased risk of having an SGA neonate, but not preterm birth or lower mean birth weight of term neonates.

Congenital Zika syndrome is associated with maternal protein malnutrition. Sci Adv. 2020; 6(2): eaaw6284. doi: 10.1126/sciadv.aaw6284\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAbstract\n--------\nZika virus (ZIKV) infection during pregnancy is associated with a spectrum of developmental impairments known as congenital Zika syndrome (CZS). The prevalence of this syndrome varies across ZIKV endemic regions, suggesting that its occurrence could depend on cofactors. Here, we evaluate the relevance of protein malnutrition for the emergence of CZS. Epidemiological data from the ZIKV outbreak in the Americas suggest a relationship between undernutrition and cases of microcephaly. To experimentally examine this relationship, we use immunocompetent pregnant mice, which were subjected to protein malnutrition and infected with a Brazilian ZIKV strain. We found that the combination of protein restriction and ZIKV infection leads to severe alterations of placental structure and embryonic body growth, with offspring displaying a reduction in neurogenesis and postnatal brain size. RNA-seq analysis reveals gene expression deregulation required for brain development in infected low-protein progeny. These results suggest that maternal protein malnutrition increases susceptibility to CZS.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[It would be interesting to see if protein restriction of Zika virus infected non-human primates has the same severe alteration of placental structure. If it does, it would be worthwhile to see if women who are protein malnourished are more prone to having CZS infants than women who are not. This mouse model suggests that a study of the nutritional status of pregnant women in areas of Zika virus transmission would be worthwhile. - Mod.TY]\nSee Also\n2019\n----\nZika virus (07): Americas, Asia, Africa, Europe, research, observations 20191108.6768177\nZika virus (06): Americas, Asia, research, observations 20190803.6603479\nZika virus (05): Americas, Africa, Middle East research, observations 20190710.6560062\nZika virus (04): Americas, research, observations 20190509.6462043\nZika virus (03): Americas, Asia, research, observations 20190418.6429589\nZika virus (02): Americas, Asia, research, observations 20190320.6377153\nZika virus (01): Americas, Asia research, observations 20190204.6293304\n.................................................sb/dk/jh/lxl/sh/ty/mj/jh", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "chikungunya", "dengue", "zika"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2021-03-01 00:00:00", "2019-12-16 00:00:00", "2019-12-16 00:00:00", "2019-12-16 00:00:00", "1064-03-16 00:00:00", "2019-12-16 00:00:00", "2020-01-10 00:00:00", "2019-03-16 00:00:00", "3827-03-16 00:00:00", "2018-03-16 00:00:00", "2019-12-16 00:00:00", "2019-12-16 00:00:00", "2016-03-16 00:00:00", "2019-03-16 00:00:00", "2020-01-09 00:00:00", "2019-03-16 00:00:00", "2019-03-16 00:00:00", "2019-03-16 00:00:00", "2020-03-16 00:00:00", "2019-12-16 00:00:00", "2019-03-16 00:00:00", "2016-03-16 00:00:00", "2016-03-16 00:00:00", "2020-03-16 00:00:00", "2019-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-07 00:00:00", "2021-03-01 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Haiti", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Utah", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Texas", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Guangdong Province", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Cuba", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "New York City", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "ER", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Putumayo", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Nevada", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Puerto Rico", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Los Angeles", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "San Diego", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Valle", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "China", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "California", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "SB", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Virginia", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Nebraska", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Oregon", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "New Jersey / 3", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Georgia", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Brazil", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "New York /", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "the United States", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "7933722", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Zika virus (06): Americas, research, observations", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=7933722", "date": "2020-01-13 17:17:03", "main_text": "ZIKA VIRUS (01): AMERICAS, ASIA , RESEARCH, OBSERVATIONS\n********************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nIn this update:\n[1] Cases in various countries\nAmericas\nMexico\n---\n\nSouth America\n---\nBrazil\n- Petropolis, Rio de Janeiro state\n- Rio de Janeiro municipality\n- Minas Gerais state\n- Pernambuco state\nColombia\n\nImported cases with little or no possibility of ongoing mosquito transmission\nChina (Guangdong Province) ex abroad\nUSA\n- California cases\n- Florida cases\n\n[2] Vaccination of pregnant monkeys\n[3] Virus-cell interaction\n[4] USA (NY): antenatal infection\n[5] Maternal nutrition and CZS\n\n******\n[1] Cases in various countries\n[Maps showing the location of the affected countries in the Americas mentioned below can be accessed at\nhttp://healthmap.org/promed/p/35574;\nCentral America at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/39455;\nSouth America at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/6186.\n- Mod.TY]\n\nMexico\n---\n- National. 26 Dec 2019.

Sci Adv. 2020; 6(2): eaaw6284. doi: 10.1126/sciadv.aaw6284\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAbstract\n--------\nZika virus (ZIKV) infection during pregnancy is associated with a spectrum of developmental impairments known as congenital Zika syndrome (CZS). The prevalence of this syndrome varies across ZIKV endemic regions, suggesting that its occurrence could depend on cofactors. Here, we evaluate the relevance of protein malnutrition for the emergence of CZS. Epidemiological data from the ZIKV outbreak in the Americas suggest a relationship between undernutrition and cases of microcephaly. To experimentally examine this relationship, we use immunocompetent pregnant mice, which were subjected to protein malnutrition and infected with a Brazilian ZIKV strain. We found that the combination of protein restriction and ZIKV infection leads to severe alterations of placental structure and embryonic body growth, with offspring displaying a reduction in neurogenesis and postnatal brain size. RNA-seq analysis reveals gene expression deregulation required for brain development in infected low-protein progeny. These results suggest that maternal protein malnutrition increases susceptibility to CZS.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[It would be interesting to see if protein restriction of Zika virus infected non-human primates has the same severe alteration of placental structure. If it does, it would be worthwhile to see if women who are protein malnourished are more prone to having CZS infants than women who are not. This mouse model suggests that a study of the nutritional status of pregnant women in areas of Zika virus transmission would be worthwhile. - Mod.TY]\nSee Also\n2019\n----\nZika virus (07): Americas, Asia, Africa, Europe, research, observations 20191108.6768177\nZika virus (06): Americas, Asia, research, observations 20190803.6603479\nZika virus (05): Americas, Africa, Middle East research, observations 20190710.6560062\nZika virus (04): Americas, research, observations 20190509.6462043\nZika virus (03): Americas, Asia, research, observations 20190418.6429589\nZika virus (02): Americas, Asia, research, observations 20190320.6377153\nZika virus (01): Americas, Asia research, observations 20190204.6293304\n.................................................sb/dk/jh/lxl/sh/ty/mj/jh", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "chikungunya", "dengue", "zika"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2021-03-01 00:00:00", "2019-12-16 00:00:00", "2019-12-16 00:00:00", "2019-12-16 00:00:00", "1064-03-16 00:00:00", "2019-12-16 00:00:00", "2020-01-10 00:00:00", "2019-03-16 00:00:00", "3827-03-16 00:00:00", "2018-03-16 00:00:00", "2019-12-16 00:00:00", "2019-12-16 00:00:00", "2016-03-16 00:00:00", "2019-03-16 00:00:00", "2020-01-09 00:00:00", "2019-03-16 00:00:00", "2019-03-16 00:00:00", "2019-03-16 00:00:00", "2020-03-16 00:00:00", "2019-12-16 00:00:00", "2019-03-16 00:00:00", "2016-03-16 00:00:00", "2016-03-16 00:00:00", "2020-03-16 00:00:00", "2019-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-07 00:00:00", "2021-03-01 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Haiti", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Utah", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Texas", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Guangdong Province", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Cuba", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "New York City", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "ER", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Putumayo", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Nevada", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Puerto Rico", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Los Angeles", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "San Diego", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Valle", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "China", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "California", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "SB", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Virginia", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Nebraska", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Oregon", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "New Jersey / 3", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Georgia", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Brazil", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "New York /", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "the United States", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "7733723", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Zika virus (05): Americas, research, observations", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=7733723", "date": "2020-01-13 17:17:03", "main_text": "ZIKA VIRUS (01): AMERICAS, ASIA , RESEARCH, OBSERVATIONS\n********************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nIn this update:\n[1] Cases in various countries\nAmericas\nMexico\n---\n\nSouth America\n---\nBrazil\n- Petropolis, Rio de Janeiro state\n- Rio de Janeiro municipality\n- Minas Gerais state\n- Pernambuco state\nColombia\n\nImported cases with little or no possibility of ongoing mosquito transmission\nChina (Guangdong Province) ex abroad\nUSA\n- California cases\n- Florida cases\n\n[2] Vaccination of pregnant monkeys\n[3] Virus-cell interaction\n[4] USA (NY): antenatal infection\n[5] Maternal nutrition and CZS\n\n******\n[1] Cases in various countries\n[Maps showing the location of the affected countries in the Americas mentioned below can be accessed at\nhttp://healthmap.org/promed/p/35574;\nCentral America at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/39455;\nSouth America at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/6186.\n- Mod.TY]\n\nMexico\n---\n- National. 26 Dec 2019.

To assess fetal protection, Van Rompay et al immunized nonhuman primates with a DNA vaccine before conception and then performed multiple Zika virus challenges in the first few months of pregnancy. Compared to unvaccinated controls, vaccinated animals had reduced viremia in terms of both magnitude and duration. Early fetal loss and fetal pathology was accordingly reduced. These results show that Zika virus vaccines given to women of childbearing age may help prevent damaging sequelae in offspring.\n\nAbstract\n--------\nZika virus (ZIKV) infection of pregnant women is associated with congenital Zika syndrome (CZS) and no vaccine is available, although several are being tested in clinical trials. We tested the efficacy of ZIKV DNA vaccine VRC5283 in a rhesus macaque model of congenital ZIKV infection. Most animal vaccine experiments have a set pathogen exposure several weeks or months after vaccination. In the real world, people encounter pathogens years or decades after vaccination, or may be repeatedly exposed if the virus is endemic. To more accurately mimic how this vaccine would be used, we immunized macaques before conception and then exposed them repeatedly to ZIKV during early and mid-gestation. In comparison to unimmunized animals, vaccinated animals had a significant reduction in peak magnitude and duration of maternal viremia, early fetal loss, fetal infection, and placental and fetal brain pathology. Vaccine-induced neutralizing antibody titers on the day of 1st ZIKV exposure were negatively associated with the magnitude of maternal viremia, and the absence of prolonged viremia was associated with better fetal outcomes. These data support further clinical development of ZIKV vaccine strategies to protect against negative fetal outcomes.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nMary Marshall\n<mjm2020@googlemail.org>\n\n[This vaccine looks promising for reducing Zika fetal syndrome.

The proteins that are responsible for the biogenesis of replication compartments are not well defined. Here, we show that Zika nonstructural protein 1 (NS1)-induced ER remodeling is essential for viral replication. NS1 expressed in the ER lumen induced ER perinuclear aggregation with an ultrastructure resembling that of the replication compartment. Data from model membrane system indicated that the membrane-binding and membrane-remodeling properties of NS1 depend on its hydrophobic insertion into the membrane. These findings demonstrate that NS1 plays a crucial role in flavivirus replication compartment formation by remodeling the ER structure.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[This report explains how Zika virus NS1 restructures ER that facilitates virus replication.

We restricted the analysis to nonsmoking, nonwhite women and adjusted for maternal characteristics. Among women with antenatal Zika virus infection, we used modified Poisson regression to assess risks of having an SGA neonate and of delivering preterm, and linear regression to assess the association of infection with mean birth weight of term neonates.\n\nResults:\nOf 116 034 deliveries of singleton neonates in New York City in 2016, 251 (0.2%) were to women with antenatal Zika virus infection. A higher percentage of women with Zika virus infection delivered an SGA neonate compared with those without (11.2% vs 5.8%; adjusted relative risk [RR] 1.8; 95% CI 1.3-2.6). There was no difference in preterm birth prevalence for women with and without Zika virus infection (adjusted RR 1.0; 95% CI 0.69-1.6). Mean birth weight of term neonates born to women with Zika virus infection was 47 g less (95% I -105 to 11 g); this difference was not statistically significant in crude or adjusted analyses.\n\nConclusion:\nFor a cohort of New York City women, antenatal Zika virus infection was associated with an increased risk of having an SGA neonate, but not preterm birth or lower mean birth weight of term neonates. This supports a putative association between Zika virus infection during pregnancy and SGA.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Kunihiko Iizuka\n\n[SGA is another parameter to be monitored for infants delivered by women who were infected by Zika virus during pregnancy.

These results show that Zika virus vaccines given to women of childbearing age may help prevent damaging sequelae in offspring.\n\nAbstract\n--------\nZika virus (ZIKV) infection of pregnant women is associated with congenital Zika syndrome (CZS) and no vaccine is available, although several are being tested in clinical trials. We tested the efficacy of ZIKV DNA vaccine VRC5283 in a rhesus macaque model of congenital ZIKV infection. Most animal vaccine experiments have a set pathogen exposure several weeks or months after vaccination. In the real world, people encounter pathogens years or decades after vaccination, or may be repeatedly exposed if the virus is endemic. To more accurately mimic how this vaccine would be used, we immunized macaques before conception and then exposed them repeatedly to ZIKV during early and mid-gestation. In comparison to unimmunized animals, vaccinated animals had a significant reduction in peak magnitude and duration of maternal viremia, early fetal loss, fetal infection, and placental and fetal brain pathology. Vaccine-induced neutralizing antibody titers on the day of 1st ZIKV exposure were negatively associated with the magnitude of maternal viremia, and the absence of prolonged viremia was associated with better fetal outcomes. These data support further clinical development of ZIKV vaccine strategies to protect against negative fetal outcomes.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nMary Marshall\n<mjm2020@googlemail.org>\n\n[This vaccine looks promising for reducing Zika fetal syndrome.

We restricted the analysis to nonsmoking, nonwhite women and adjusted for maternal characteristics. Among women with antenatal Zika virus infection, we used modified Poisson regression to assess risks of having an SGA neonate and of delivering preterm, and linear regression to assess the association of infection with mean birth weight of term neonates.\n\nResults:\nOf 116 034 deliveries of singleton neonates in New York City in 2016, 251 (0.2%) were to women with antenatal Zika virus infection. A higher percentage of women with Zika virus infection delivered an SGA neonate compared with those without (11.2% vs 5.8%; adjusted relative risk [RR] 1.8; 95% CI 1.3-2.6). There was no difference in preterm birth prevalence for women with and without Zika virus infection (adjusted RR 1.0; 95% CI 0.69-1.6). Mean birth weight of term neonates born to women with Zika virus infection was 47 g less (95% I -105 to 11 g); this difference was not statistically significant in crude or adjusted analyses.\n\nConclusion:\nFor a cohort of New York City women, antenatal Zika virus infection was associated with an increased risk of having an SGA neonate, but not preterm birth or lower mean birth weight of term neonates.

The prevalence of this syndrome varies across ZIKV endemic regions, suggesting that its occurrence could depend on cofactors. Here, we evaluate the relevance of protein malnutrition for the emergence of CZS. Epidemiological data from the ZIKV outbreak in the Americas suggest a relationship between undernutrition and cases of microcephaly. To experimentally examine this relationship, we use immunocompetent pregnant mice, which were subjected to protein malnutrition and infected with a Brazilian ZIKV strain. We found that the combination of protein restriction and ZIKV infection leads to severe alterations of placental structure and embryonic body growth, with offspring displaying a reduction in neurogenesis and postnatal brain size. RNA-seq analysis reveals gene expression deregulation required for brain development in infected low-protein progeny. These results suggest that maternal protein malnutrition increases susceptibility to CZS.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[It would be interesting to see if protein restriction of Zika virus infected non-human primates has the same severe alteration of placental structure. If it does, it would be worthwhile to see if women who are protein malnourished are more prone to having CZS infants than women who are not. This mouse model suggests that a study of the nutritional status of pregnant women in areas of Zika virus transmission would be worthwhile. - Mod.TY]\nSee Also\n2019\n----\nZika virus (07): Americas, Asia, Africa, Europe, research, observations 20191108.6768177\nZika virus (06): Americas, Asia, research, observations 20190803.6603479\nZika virus (05): Americas, Africa, Middle East research, observations 20190710.6560062\nZika virus (04): Americas, research, observations 20190509.6462043\nZika virus (03): Americas, Asia, research, observations 20190418.6429589\nZika virus (02): Americas, Asia, research, observations 20190320.6377153\nZika virus (01): Americas, Asia research, observations 20190204.6293304\n.................................................sb/dk/jh/lxl/sh/ty/mj/jh", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "chikungunya", "dengue", "zika"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2021-03-01 00:00:00", "2019-12-16 00:00:00", "2019-12-16 00:00:00", "2019-12-16 00:00:00", "1064-03-16 00:00:00", "2019-12-16 00:00:00", "2020-01-10 00:00:00", "2019-03-16 00:00:00", "3827-03-16 00:00:00", "2018-03-16 00:00:00", "2019-12-16 00:00:00", "2019-12-16 00:00:00", "2016-03-16 00:00:00", "2019-03-16 00:00:00", "2020-01-09 00:00:00", "2019-03-16 00:00:00", "2019-03-16 00:00:00", "2019-03-16 00:00:00", "2020-03-16 00:00:00", "2019-12-16 00:00:00", "2019-03-16 00:00:00", "2016-03-16 00:00:00", "2016-03-16 00:00:00", "2020-03-16 00:00:00", "2019-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-07 00:00:00", "2021-03-01 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Haiti", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Utah", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Texas", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Guangdong Province", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Cuba", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "New York City", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "ER", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Putumayo", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Nevada", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Puerto Rico", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Los Angeles", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "San Diego", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Valle", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "China", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "California", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "SB", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Virginia", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Nebraska", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Oregon", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "New Jersey / 3", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Georgia", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Brazil", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "New York /", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "the United States", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "7454687", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Zika virus (03): Americas, Asia research, observations", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=7454687", "date": "2020-01-13 17:17:03", "main_text": "ZIKA VIRUS (01): AMERICAS, ASIA , RESEARCH, OBSERVATIONS\n********************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nIn this update:\n[1] Cases in various countries\nAmericas\nMexico\n---\n\nSouth America\n---\nBrazil\n- Petropolis, Rio de Janeiro state\n- Rio de Janeiro municipality\n- Minas Gerais state\n- Pernambuco state\nColombia\n\nImported cases with little or no possibility of ongoing mosquito transmission\nChina (Guangdong Province) ex abroad\nUSA\n- California cases\n- Florida cases\n\n[2] Vaccination of pregnant monkeys\n[3] Virus-cell interaction\n[4] USA (NY): antenatal infection\n[5] Maternal nutrition and CZS\n\n******\n[1] Cases in various countries\n[Maps showing the location of the affected countries in the Americas mentioned below can be accessed at\nhttp://healthmap.org/promed/p/35574;\nCentral America at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/39455;\nSouth America at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/6186.\n- Mod.TY]\n\nMexico\n---\n- National. 26 Dec 2019.

To assess fetal protection, Van Rompay et al immunized nonhuman primates with a DNA vaccine before conception and then performed multiple Zika virus challenges in the first few months of pregnancy. Compared to unvaccinated controls, vaccinated animals had reduced viremia in terms of both magnitude and duration. Early fetal loss and fetal pathology was accordingly reduced. These results show that Zika virus vaccines given to women of childbearing age may help prevent damaging sequelae in offspring.\n\nAbstract\n--------\nZika virus (ZIKV) infection of pregnant women is associated with congenital Zika syndrome (CZS) and no vaccine is available, although several are being tested in clinical trials. We tested the efficacy of ZIKV DNA vaccine VRC5283 in a rhesus macaque model of congenital ZIKV infection. Most animal vaccine experiments have a set pathogen exposure several weeks or months after vaccination. In the real world, people encounter pathogens years or decades after vaccination, or may be repeatedly exposed if the virus is endemic. To more accurately mimic how this vaccine would be used, we immunized macaques before conception and then exposed them repeatedly to ZIKV during early and mid-gestation. In comparison to unimmunized animals, vaccinated animals had a significant reduction in peak magnitude and duration of maternal viremia, early fetal loss, fetal infection, and placental and fetal brain pathology. Vaccine-induced neutralizing antibody titers on the day of 1st ZIKV exposure were negatively associated with the magnitude of maternal viremia, and the absence of prolonged viremia was associated with better fetal outcomes. These data support further clinical development of ZIKV vaccine strategies to protect against negative fetal outcomes.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nMary Marshall\n<mjm2020@googlemail.org>\n\n[This vaccine looks promising for reducing Zika fetal syndrome.

The proteins that are responsible for the biogenesis of replication compartments are not well defined. Here, we show that Zika nonstructural protein 1 (NS1)-induced ER remodeling is essential for viral replication. NS1 expressed in the ER lumen induced ER perinuclear aggregation with an ultrastructure resembling that of the replication compartment. Data from model membrane system indicated that the membrane-binding and membrane-remodeling properties of NS1 depend on its hydrophobic insertion into the membrane. These findings demonstrate that NS1 plays a crucial role in flavivirus replication compartment formation by remodeling the ER structure.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[This report explains how Zika virus NS1 restructures ER that facilitates virus replication.

We restricted the analysis to nonsmoking, nonwhite women and adjusted for maternal characteristics. Among women with antenatal Zika virus infection, we used modified Poisson regression to assess risks of having an SGA neonate and of delivering preterm, and linear regression to assess the association of infection with mean birth weight of term neonates.\n\nResults:\nOf 116 034 deliveries of singleton neonates in New York City in 2016, 251 (0.2%) were to women with antenatal Zika virus infection. A higher percentage of women with Zika virus infection delivered an SGA neonate compared with those without (11.2% vs 5.8%; adjusted relative risk [RR] 1.8; 95% CI 1.3-2.6). There was no difference in preterm birth prevalence for women with and without Zika virus infection (adjusted RR 1.0; 95% CI 0.69-1.6). Mean birth weight of term neonates born to women with Zika virus infection was 47 g less (95% I -105 to 11 g); this difference was not statistically significant in crude or adjusted analyses.\n\nConclusion:\nFor a cohort of New York City women, antenatal Zika virus infection was associated with an increased risk of having an SGA neonate, but not preterm birth or lower mean birth weight of term neonates. This supports a putative association between Zika virus infection during pregnancy and SGA.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Kunihiko Iizuka\n\n[SGA is another parameter to be monitored for infants delivered by women who were infected by Zika virus during pregnancy.

Congenital Zika syndrome is associated with maternal protein malnutrition. Sci Adv. 2020; 6(2): eaaw6284. doi: 10.1126/sciadv.aaw6284\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAbstract\n--------\nZika virus (ZIKV) infection during pregnancy is associated with a spectrum of developmental impairments known as congenital Zika syndrome (CZS). The prevalence of this syndrome varies across ZIKV endemic regions, suggesting that its occurrence could depend on cofactors. Here, we evaluate the relevance of protein malnutrition for the emergence of CZS. Epidemiological data from the ZIKV outbreak in the Americas suggest a relationship between undernutrition and cases of microcephaly. To experimentally examine this relationship, we use immunocompetent pregnant mice, which were subjected to protein malnutrition and infected with a Brazilian ZIKV strain. We found that the combination of protein restriction and ZIKV infection leads to severe alterations of placental structure and embryonic body growth, with offspring displaying a reduction in neurogenesis and postnatal brain size. RNA-seq analysis reveals gene expression deregulation required for brain development in infected low-protein progeny. These results suggest that maternal protein malnutrition increases susceptibility to CZS.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[It would be interesting to see if protein restriction of Zika virus infected non-human primates has the same severe alteration of placental structure.

We restricted the analysis to nonsmoking, nonwhite women and adjusted for maternal characteristics. Among women with antenatal Zika virus infection, we used modified Poisson regression to assess risks of having an SGA neonate and of delivering preterm, and linear regression to assess the association of infection with mean birth weight of term neonates.\n\nResults:\nOf 116 034 deliveries of singleton neonates in New York City in 2016, 251 (0.2%) were to women with antenatal Zika virus infection. A higher percentage of women with Zika virus infection delivered an SGA neonate compared with those without (11.2% vs 5.8%; adjusted relative risk [RR] 1.8; 95% CI 1.3-2.6). There was no difference in preterm birth prevalence for women with and without Zika virus infection (adjusted RR 1.0; 95% CI 0.69-1.6). Mean birth weight of term neonates born to women with Zika virus infection was 47 g less (95% I -105 to 11 g); this difference was not statistically significant in crude or adjusted analyses.\n\nConclusion:\nFor a cohort of New York City women, antenatal Zika virus infection was associated with an increased risk of having an SGA neonate, but not preterm birth or lower mean birth weight of term neonates.

The prevalence of this syndrome varies across ZIKV endemic regions, suggesting that its occurrence could depend on cofactors. Here, we evaluate the relevance of protein malnutrition for the emergence of CZS. Epidemiological data from the ZIKV outbreak in the Americas suggest a relationship between undernutrition and cases of microcephaly. To experimentally examine this relationship, we use immunocompetent pregnant mice, which were subjected to protein malnutrition and infected with a Brazilian ZIKV strain. We found that the combination of protein restriction and ZIKV infection leads to severe alterations of placental structure and embryonic body growth, with offspring displaying a reduction in neurogenesis and postnatal brain size. RNA-seq analysis reveals gene expression deregulation required for brain development in infected low-protein progeny. These results suggest that maternal protein malnutrition increases susceptibility to CZS.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[It would be interesting to see if protein restriction of Zika virus infected non-human primates has the same severe alteration of placental structure. If it does, it would be worthwhile to see if women who are protein malnourished are more prone to having CZS infants than women who are not. This mouse model suggests that a study of the nutritional status of pregnant women in areas of Zika virus transmission would be worthwhile. - Mod.TY]\nSee Also\n2019\n----\nZika virus (07): Americas, Asia, Africa, Europe, research, observations 20191108.6768177\nZika virus (06): Americas, Asia, research, observations 20190803.6603479\nZika virus (05): Americas, Africa, Middle East research, observations 20190710.6560062\nZika virus (04): Americas, research, observations 20190509.6462043\nZika virus (03): Americas, Asia, research, observations 20190418.6429589\nZika virus (02): Americas, Asia, research, observations 20190320.6377153\nZika virus (01): Americas, Asia research, observations 20190204.6293304\n.................................................sb/dk/jh/lxl/sh/ty/mj/jh", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "chikungunya", "dengue", "zika"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2021-03-01 00:00:00", "2019-12-16 00:00:00", "2019-12-16 00:00:00", "2019-12-16 00:00:00", "1064-03-16 00:00:00", "2019-12-16 00:00:00", "2020-01-10 00:00:00", "2019-03-16 00:00:00", "3827-03-16 00:00:00", "2018-03-16 00:00:00", "2019-12-16 00:00:00", "2019-12-16 00:00:00", "2016-03-16 00:00:00", "2019-03-16 00:00:00", "2020-01-09 00:00:00", "2019-03-16 00:00:00", "2019-03-16 00:00:00", "2019-03-16 00:00:00", "2020-03-16 00:00:00", "2019-12-16 00:00:00", "2019-03-16 00:00:00", "2016-03-16 00:00:00", "2016-03-16 00:00:00", "2020-03-16 00:00:00", "2019-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-07 00:00:00", "2021-03-01 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Haiti", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Utah", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Texas", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Guangdong Province", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Cuba", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "New York City", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "ER", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Putumayo", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Nevada", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Puerto Rico", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Los Angeles", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "San Diego", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Valle", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "China", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "California", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "SB", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Virginia", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Nebraska", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Oregon", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "New Jersey / 3", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Georgia", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Brazil", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "New York /", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "the United States", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "6768177", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Zika virus (07): Americas, Asia, Africa, Europe, research, observations", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=6768177", "date": "2020-01-13 17:17:03", "main_text": "ZIKA VIRUS (01): AMERICAS, ASIA , RESEARCH, OBSERVATIONS\n********************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nIn this update:\n[1] Cases in various countries\nAmericas\nMexico\n---\n\nSouth America\n---\nBrazil\n- Petropolis, Rio de Janeiro state\n- Rio de Janeiro municipality\n- Minas Gerais state\n- Pernambuco state\nColombia\n\nImported cases with little or no possibility of ongoing mosquito transmission\nChina (Guangdong Province) ex abroad\nUSA\n- California cases\n- Florida cases\n\n[2] Vaccination of pregnant monkeys\n[3] Virus-cell interaction\n[4] USA (NY): antenatal infection\n[5] Maternal nutrition and CZS\n\n******\n[1] Cases in various countries\n[Maps showing the location of the affected countries in the Americas mentioned below can be accessed at\nhttp://healthmap.org/promed/p/35574;\nCentral America at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/39455;\nSouth America at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/6186.\n- Mod.TY]\n\nMexico\n---\n- National. 26 Dec 2019.

To assess fetal protection, Van Rompay et al immunized nonhuman primates with a DNA vaccine before conception and then performed multiple Zika virus challenges in the first few months of pregnancy. Compared to unvaccinated controls, vaccinated animals had reduced viremia in terms of both magnitude and duration. Early fetal loss and fetal pathology was accordingly reduced. These results show that Zika virus vaccines given to women of childbearing age may help prevent damaging sequelae in offspring.\n\nAbstract\n--------\nZika virus (ZIKV) infection of pregnant women is associated with congenital Zika syndrome (CZS) and no vaccine is available, although several are being tested in clinical trials. We tested the efficacy of ZIKV DNA vaccine VRC5283 in a rhesus macaque model of congenital ZIKV infection. Most animal vaccine experiments have a set pathogen exposure several weeks or months after vaccination. In the real world, people encounter pathogens years or decades after vaccination, or may be repeatedly exposed if the virus is endemic. To more accurately mimic how this vaccine would be used, we immunized macaques before conception and then exposed them repeatedly to ZIKV during early and mid-gestation. In comparison to unimmunized animals, vaccinated animals had a significant reduction in peak magnitude and duration of maternal viremia, early fetal loss, fetal infection, and placental and fetal brain pathology. Vaccine-induced neutralizing antibody titers on the day of 1st ZIKV exposure were negatively associated with the magnitude of maternal viremia, and the absence of prolonged viremia was associated with better fetal outcomes. These data support further clinical development of ZIKV vaccine strategies to protect against negative fetal outcomes.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nMary Marshall\n<mjm2020@googlemail.org>\n\n[This vaccine looks promising for reducing Zika fetal syndrome.

Brazil is a dengue-endemic country where all 4 dengue virus serotypes circulate and cause seasonal epidemics. Recently, chikungunya and Zika viruses were also introduced. In Rio de Janeiro city, the 3 diseases co-circulated for the 1st time in 2015-2016, resulting in what is known as the \"triple epidemic.\" In this study, we identify space-time clusters of dengue, chikungunya, and Zika to understand the dynamics and interaction between these simultaneously circulating arboviruses in a densely populated and heterogeneous city. We conducted a spatio-temporal analysis of weekly notified cases of the 3 diseases in Rio de Janeiro city (July 2015-January 2017), georeferenced by 160 neighbourhoods, using Kulldorff's scan statistic with discrete Poisson probability models. There were 26 549, 13 662, and 35 905 notified cases of dengue, chikungunya, and Zika, respectively. The 17 dengue clusters and 15 Zika clusters were spread all over the city, while the 14 chikungunya clusters were more concentrated in the north and downtown areas. Zika clusters persisted over a longer period of time. The multivariate scan statistic -- used to analyse the 3 diseases simultaneously -- detected 17 clusters, 9 of which included all 3 diseases. This is the 1st study exploring space-time clustering of dengue, chikungunya, and Zika in an intra-urban area. In general, the clusters did not coincide in time and space. This is probably the result of the competition between viruses for host resources and of vector-control attitudes promoted by previous arbovirus outbreaks. The main affected area -- the north region -- is characterised by a combination of high population density and low human-development index, highlighting the importance of targeting interventions in this area. Spatio-temporal scan statistics have the potential to direct interventions to high-risk locations in a timely manner and should be considered as part of the municipal surveillance routine as a tool to optimize prevention strategies.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n[This approach depends on accurate surveillance, diagnosis, and reporting of clinical cases of infections by the 6 viruses (4 dengue and one each chikungunya and Zika viruses). One wonders if reporting of clinical cases is the same across the various economic groups across the city. Could it be that marginal populations, which might have higher incidences of infection, also have underreporting because residents seek medical attention less frequently or medical facilities are less readily available than in neighborhoods of higher economic status? Defining high-risk neighborhoods will be a useful tool for focusing medical attention, public education, and vector control efforts. - Mod.TY\n\nHealthMap/ProMED-mail map:\nRio de Janeiro, Brazil: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/63696]\nSee Also\nZika virus (12): Americas, Africa, Pacific, Asia research, observations 20181226.6223397\nChikungunya (01): Americas, Africa, Asia 20190103.6241396\nDengue/DHF update (01): Americas 20190103.6240824\n.................................................lm/ty/tw/lxl", "reports": [{"diseases": ["chikungunya", "dengue", "zika"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2019-01-17 00:00:00", "2019-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-01 00:00:00", "2021-03-01 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Brazil", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Americas", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Rio de Janeiro", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "BRAZIL", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Pacific", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "BioRxIv", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "6560062", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Zika virus (05): Americas, Africa, Middle East research, observations", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=6560062", "date": "2019-01-25 21:17:21", "main_text": "DENGUE, CHIKUNGUNYA, ZIKA VIRUSES - AMERICAS: BRAZIL (RIO DE JANEIRO) CO-CIRCULATION\n************************************************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Thu 17 Jan 2019\nSource: Space-time clusters of dengue, chikungunya, and Zika cases in the city of Rio de Janeiro.\n[BioRxIv, edited]\nhttps://www.biorxiv.org/node/153774.abstract?%3Fcollection=%3E\n\n\nref: Picinini Freitas L, Goncalves Cruz O, Lowe R, Sa Carvalho M.

Brazil is a dengue-endemic country where all 4 dengue virus serotypes circulate and cause seasonal epidemics. Recently, chikungunya and Zika viruses were also introduced. In Rio de Janeiro city, the 3 diseases co-circulated for the 1st time in 2015-2016, resulting in what is known as the \"triple epidemic.\" In this study, we identify space-time clusters of dengue, chikungunya, and Zika to understand the dynamics and interaction between these simultaneously circulating arboviruses in a densely populated and heterogeneous city. We conducted a spatio-temporal analysis of weekly notified cases of the 3 diseases in Rio de Janeiro city (July 2015-January 2017), georeferenced by 160 neighbourhoods, using Kulldorff's scan statistic with discrete Poisson probability models.

CDC analyzed data from 15 U.S. jurisdictions conducting population-based surveillance for birth defects potentially related to Zika virus infection. All 15 U.S. jurisdictions included in this report had existing birth defects surveillance systems that were rapidly adapted to monitor birth defects potentially related to Zika virus infection. These jurisdictions provided data on live births and pregnancy losses occurring from 1 Jan - 31 Dec 2016. The prevalence of reported birth defects cases potentially related to Zika virus infection increased in jurisdictions with confirmed local transmission, from 2.8 per 1000 live births (182 cases) during the 1st half of 2016 to 3.0 per 1000 live births (211 cases) during the 2nd half (CI = 2.4-3.2 and CI = 2.6-3.4, respectively; p = 0.10). In \"higher\" Zika prevalence jurisdictions, the monitored birth defects prevalence was 3.0 per 1000 live births in both the 1st (753 cases) and 2nd (775 cases) halves of 2016. In \"lower\" prevalence jurisdictions, the monitored birth defects prevalence declined significantly from 3.4 per 1000 live births (549 cases) during the 1st half of 2016 to 3.0 (492 cases) per 1000 live births during the 2nd half (CI = 3.2-3.7 and CI = 2.8-3.3, respectively; p = 0.002).\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/67/wr/mm6703a2.htm?s_cid=mm6703a2_w\n\n- Preparedness USA.

Cardiac findings in infants with in utero exposure to Zika virus - a cross sectional study.\n\nAbstract\nBackground\nAntenatal exposure to Zika virus (ZIKV) is related to severe neurological manifestations. A previous study in Brazil reported an increased incidence of non-severe congenital heart defects in infants with diagnosis of congenital Zika syndrome but without laboratory confirmation of ZIKV infection in the mother or infant. The objective of this study is to report echocardiographic (ECHO) findings in infants with laboratory confirmed antenatal exposure to ZIKV.\nMethodology\nCross sectional study of cardiologic assessments of infants born between November 2015 and January 2017 with confirmed vertical exposure to ZIKV in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.\nResults\nThe study enrolled 120 children with a median age of 97 days (1 - 376 days). In utero exposure to ZIKV was confirmed in 97 children (80.8 percent) through positive maternal polymerase chain reaction (PCR) results during pregnancy or a positive PCR result at birth; 23 additional children (19.2 percent) had maternal positive PCR results during pregnancy and postnatally. Of the 120, 48 infants (40 percent) had cardiac defects noted on ECHO and 13 infants (10.8 percent) had major cardiac defects (atrial septal defect, ventricular septal defect, patent ductus arteriosus). None of the defects were severe. The frequency of major defects was higher in infants whose mothers had a rash in the 2nd trimester of pregnancy, or who had altered central nervous system (CNS) imaging postnatally or were preterm.\nConclusions\nInfants with in utero ZIKV exposure have a higher prevalence of major cardiac defects, however none were severe enough to require immediate intervention. For this reason, guidelines for performance of postnatal ECHO in this population should follow general newborn screening guidelines, which significantly reduces the burden of performing emergent fetal or neonatal ECHOs in a setting where resources are not available, such as most Brazilian municipalities.\nAuthor summary\nWe performed cardiologic assessment of 120 infants born between November 2015 and January 2017 with confirmed vertical exposure to Zika virus (ZIKV). The diagnosis of ZIKV exposure was confirmed by PCR in maternal blood specimens and/or amniotic fluid during pregnancy and/or infant specimens including PCR of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and/or urine following birth. Our study found a 10.8 percent incidence of structural heart defects in infants with a history of intrauterine exposure to ZIKV, a rate considerably higher than that observed in the general population. However, no patients were found to have severe structural heart defects. The presence of major defects was increased in infants whose mothers had a history of rash in the 2nd trimester, infants with altered CNS imaging and/or preterm infants. As severe heart defects requiring immediate intervention were not identified, guidelines for performance of postnatal ECHO in this population should follow the same criteria as the ones applicable to newborns in general, particularly since resources for performance of fetal and neonatal echocardiograms are not routinely available in most Brazilian municipalities\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n[Although structural heart defects were detected in 11 percent of the infants infected by Zika virus in utero, fortunately, none of these defects was serious enough to require immediate intervention.

Congenital Zika virus infection as a silent pathology with loss of neurogenic output in the fetal brain.\n\nAbstract\nZika virus (ZIKV) is a flavivirus with teratogenic effects on fetal brain, but the spectrum of ZIKV-induced brain injury is unknown, particularly when ultrasound imaging is normal. In a pregnant pigtail macaque (_Macaca nemestrina_) model of ZIKV infection, we demonstrate that ZIKV-induced injury to fetal brain is substantial, even in the absence of microcephaly, and may be challenging to detect in a clinical setting. A common and subtle injury pattern was identified, including (i) periventricular T2-hyperintense foci and loss of fetal noncortical brain volume, (ii) injury to the ependymal epithelium with underlying gliosis and (iii) loss of late fetal neuronal progenitor cells in the subventricular zone (temporal cortex) and subgranular zone (dentate gyrus, hippocampus) with dysmorphic granule neuron patterning. Attenuation of fetal neurogenic output demonstrates potentially considerable teratogenic effects of congenital ZIKV infection even without microcephaly. Our findings suggest that all children exposed to ZIKV in utero should receive long-term monitoring for neurocognitive deficits, regardless of head size at birth.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[It will be of interest to find out if children infected in utero with Zika virus have any of the same teratogenic, long-term effects described in these cases in experimentally infected monkeys. - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[5] Fetal genetics and congenital Zika syndrome\nDate: Fri 2 Feb 2018\nSource: Nature Communications 9: 475 doi:10.1038/s41467-017-02790-9 [edited]\nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-017-02790-9#Sec12\n\n\nLuiz Carlos Caires-J\u00fanior, Ernesto Goulart, Uir\u00e1 Souto Melo, Bruno Silva Henrique Araujo, Lucas Alvizi, Alessandra Soares-Schanoski, et al. Discordant congenital Zika syndrome twins show differential in vitro viral susceptibility of neural progenitor cells.\n\nAbstract\nCongenital Zika syndrome (CZS) causes early brain development impairment by affecting neural progenitor cells (NPCs). Here, we analyze NPCs from 3 pairs of dizygotic twins discordant for CZS. We compare by RNA-Seq the NPCs derived from CZS-affected and CZS-unaffected twins. Prior to Zika virus (ZIKV) infection the NPCs from CZS babies show a significantly different gene expression signature of mTOR and Wnt pathway regulators, key to a neurodevelopmental program. Following ZIKV in vitro infection, cells from affected individuals have significantly higher ZIKV replication and reduced cell growth. Whole-exome analysis in 18 affected CZS babies as compared to 5 unaffected twins and 609 controls excludes a monogenic model to explain resistance or increased susceptibility to CZS development. Overall, our results indicate that CZS is not a stochastic event and depends on NPC intrinsic susceptibility, possibly related to oligogenic and/or epigenetic mechanisms.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Results of this study confirm the hypothesis of a genetic influence on susceptibility to the congenital Zika syndrome and microcephaly. - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[6] Mosquito vectors\nDate: Thu 15 Feb 2018\nSource: Peer J 6:e4324 https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.4324 [edited]\nhttps://peerj.com/articles/4324/\n\n\nDodson BL, Pujhari S, Rasgon JL. (2018) Vector competence of selected North American Anopheles and Culex mosquitoes for Zika virus. PeerJ 6:e4324https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.4324\n\nAbstract\nZika virus (ZIKV) is a vector-borne flavivirus that has caused recent outbreaks associated with serious disease in infants and newborns in the Americas. _Aedes_ mosquitoes are the primary vectors for ZIKV, but little is known about the diversity of mosquitoes that can transmit ZIKV in North America. We chose 3 abundant North American mosquito species (_Anopheles freeborni_, _Anopheles quadrimaculatus_, and _Culex tarsalis_) and one known vector species (_Aedes aegypti_), fed them blood meals supplemented with a recent outbreak ZIKV strain, and tested bodies, legs, and saliva for infectious ZIKV. ZIKV was able to infect, disseminate, and be transmitted by _Aedes aegypti_. However, _Anopheles freeborni_, _Anopheles quadrimaculatus_, and _Culex tarsalis_ were unable to be infected. We conclude that these species are unlikely to be involved in ZIKV transmission in North America. However, we should continue to examine the ability for other mosquito species to potentially act as ZIKV vectors in North America.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[It is reassuring to learn that these 3 species of widely-distributed mosquitoes in North America are refractory to Zika virus infection, leaving the main focus for vector control with _Aedes aegypti_, which has very limited distribution in North America. - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[7] Mosquito salivary enhancement\nDate: Mon 5 Mar 2018\nSource: Nature Immunology doi:10.1038/s41590-018-0063-9 [edited]\nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/s41590-018-0063-9\n\n\nLin Jin, Xiaomin Guo, Chuanbin Shen, Xue Hao, Peng Sun, et al. Salivary factor LTRIN from Aedes aegyptifacilitates the transmission of Zika virus by interfering with the lymphotoxin-\u03b2 receptor\n\nAbstract\nPathogens have co-evolved with mosquitoes to optimize transmission to hosts. Mosquito salivary-gland extract is known to modulate host immune responses and facilitate pathogen transmission, but the underlying molecular mechanisms of this have remained unknown. In this study, we identified and characterized a prominent 15-kilodalton protein, LTRIN, obtained from the salivary glands of the mosquito _Aedes aegypti_. LTRIN expression was upregulated in blood-fed mosquitoes, and LTRIN facilitated the transmission of Zika virus (ZIKV) and exacerbated its pathogenicity by interfering with signaling through the lymphotoxin-\u03b2 receptor (LT\u03b2R). Mechanically, LTRIN bound to LT\u03b2R and 'preferentially' inhibited signaling via the transcription factor NF-\u03baB and the production of inflammatory cytokines by interfering with the dimerization of LT\u03b2R during infection with ZIKV. Furthermore, treatment with antibody to LTRIN inhibited mosquito-mediated infection with ZIKV, and abolishing LT\u03b2R potentiated the infectivity of ZIKV both in vitro and in vivo. This study provides deeper insight into the transmission of mosquito-borne diseases in nature and supports the therapeutic potential of inhibiting the action of LTRIN to disrupt ZIKV transmission.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n******\n[8] Chimeric vaccine\nDate: Tue 27 Feb 2018\nSource: bioRxiv doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/272625 [edited]\nhttps://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/02/27/272625\n\n\nFranck Touret, Magali Gilles, Raphaelle Klitting, Fabien Aubry, Xavier de Lamballerie, Antoine Nougairede. Live Zika virus chimeric vaccine candidate based on a yellow fever 17-D attenuated backbone.\n\nAbstract\nZika virus (ZIKV) recently dispersed throughout the tropics and sub-tropics causing epidemics associated with congenital disease and neurological complications. There is currently no commercial vaccine for ZIKV. Here we describe the initial development of a chimeric virus containing the prM/E proteins of a ZIKV epidemic strain incorporated into a yellow fever 17-D attenuated backbone. Using the versatile and rapid ISA (Infectious Subgenomic Amplicons) reverse genetics method, we compared different constructs and confirmed the need to modify the cleavage site between the pre-peptide and prM protein. Using an immunocompromised mouse model, we demonstrate that mice infected with the chimeric virus produced levels of neutralizing antibodies close to those observed following infection with ZIKV and that pre-immunized mice were protected against subsequent viscerotropic and neuroinvasive virus following challenge with a heterologous strain of ZIKV. These data provide a sound basis for the future development of this ZIKV vaccine candidate.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[These results are very promising.

A recent report indicated development of t a high-density microarray comprising nonredundant 12-mer peptides that tile, with one-residue overlap, the proteomes of Zika, dengue, yellow fever, West Nile, Ilheus, Oropouche, and chikungunya viruses. Serological analysis enabled discovery of a ZIKV NS2B 20-residue peptide that had high sensitivity (96.0 percent) and specificity (95.9 percent) versus natural infection with or vaccination against dengue, chikungunya, yellow fever, West Nile, tick-borne encephalitis, or Japanese encephalitis virus in a microarray assay and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) of early-convalescent-phase sera (2 to 3 weeks after onset of symptomatic infection).

O'Neal, et al.\nPostnatal Zika virus infection is associated with persistent abnormalities in brain structure, function, and behavior in infant macaques.\n\nPostnatal perturbation by Zika virus\nMuch of the concern surrounding Zika virus infections focuses on fetuses infected in utero. Mavigner et al. reasoned that this neurotropic virus may have deleterious effects even after birth, so they set up a postnatal infection model to investigate. They found that infant rhesus macaques infected with Zika virus also had peripheral and central nervous system pathology. Longitudinal magnetic resonance imaging studies revealed that macaques that had been infected with Zika virus had structural and functional abnormalities and also altered emotional responses. These differences persisted months after the virus had been cleared. Although the work involved a small number of animals, their results suggest that infants and young children exposed to Zika virus should undergo more than just routine monitoring.\n\nAbstract\nThe Zika virus (ZIKV) epidemic is associated with fetal brain lesions and other serious birth defects classified as congenital ZIKV syndrome. Postnatal ZIKV infection in infants and children has been reported; however, data on brain anatomy, function, and behavioral outcomes following infection are absent. We show that postnatal ZIKV infection of infant rhesus macaques (RMs) results in persistent structural and functional alterations of the central nervous system compared to age-matched controls. We demonstrate ZIKV lymphoid tropism and neurotropism in infant RMs and histopathologic abnormalities in the peripheral and central nervous systems including inflammatory infiltrates, astrogliosis, and Wallerian degeneration. Structural and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI/rs-fMRI) show persistent enlargement of lateral ventricles, maturational changes in specific brain regions, and altered functional connectivity (FC) between brain areas involved in emotional behavior and arousal functions, including weakened amygdala-hippocampal connectivity in 2 of 2 ZIKV-infected infant RMs several months after clearance of ZIKV RNA from peripheral blood. ZIKV infection also results in distinct alterations in the species-typical emotional reactivity to acute stress, which were predicted by the weak amygdala-hippocampal FC. We demonstrate that postnatal ZIKV infection of infants in this model affects neurodevelopment, suggesting that long-term clinical monitoring of pediatric cases is warranted.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\nAnd\nHoward Steinberg\n<howard.steinberg@wisc.edu>\n\n[Although the numbers of infant monkeys is small, it provides enough evidence to justify evaluation of infants that have been infected with Zika virus as neonates. - Mod.TY]\n\n[The Zika virus outbreak in the Americas has diminished compared to the past 2 years (2016 and 2017), perhaps due to a smaller susceptible cohort of the human population. There are no reports yet of wide-spread reduction in the population of vector mosquitoes (_Aedes aegypti_) in the areas where Zika virus transmission has been frequent. It seems unlikely that Zika virus has disappeared from the Americas, and occurrence of sporadic outbreaks in the Americas would not be surprising. An epidemiologically important but yet unanswered question is if Zika virus has become established in non-human primates in the tropical Americas and can be transmitted by forest mosquitoes, in a sylvan maintenance cycle, as yellow fever virus has. -

Cardiac findings in infants with in utero exposure to Zika virus - a cross sectional study.\n\nAbstract\nBackground\nAntenatal exposure to Zika virus (ZIKV) is related to severe neurological manifestations. A previous study in Brazil reported an increased incidence of non-severe congenital heart defects in infants with diagnosis of congenital Zika syndrome but without laboratory confirmation of ZIKV infection in the mother or infant. The objective of this study is to report echocardiographic (ECHO) findings in infants with laboratory confirmed antenatal exposure to ZIKV.\nMethodology\nCross sectional study of cardiologic assessments of infants born between November 2015 and January 2017 with confirmed vertical exposure to ZIKV in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.\nResults\nThe study enrolled 120 children with a median age of 97 days (1 - 376 days). In utero exposure to ZIKV was confirmed in 97 children (80.8 percent) through positive maternal polymerase chain reaction (PCR) results during pregnancy or a positive PCR result at birth; 23 additional children (19.2 percent) had maternal positive PCR results during pregnancy and postnatally. Of the 120, 48 infants (40 percent) had cardiac defects noted on ECHO and 13 infants (10.8 percent) had major cardiac defects (atrial septal defect, ventricular septal defect, patent ductus arteriosus). None of the defects were severe. The frequency of major defects was higher in infants whose mothers had a rash in the 2nd trimester of pregnancy, or who had altered central nervous system (CNS) imaging postnatally or were preterm.\nConclusions\nInfants with in utero ZIKV exposure have a higher prevalence of major cardiac defects, however none were severe enough to require immediate intervention. For this reason, guidelines for performance of postnatal ECHO in this population should follow general newborn screening guidelines, which significantly reduces the burden of performing emergent fetal or neonatal ECHOs in a setting where resources are not available, such as most Brazilian municipalities.\nAuthor summary\nWe performed cardiologic assessment of 120 infants born between November 2015 and January 2017 with confirmed vertical exposure to Zika virus (ZIKV). The diagnosis of ZIKV exposure was confirmed by PCR in maternal blood specimens and/or amniotic fluid during pregnancy and/or infant specimens including PCR of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and/or urine following birth. Our study found a 10.8 percent incidence of structural heart defects in infants with a history of intrauterine exposure to ZIKV, a rate considerably higher than that observed in the general population.

The presence of major defects was increased in infants whose mothers had a history of rash in the 2nd trimester, infants with altered CNS imaging and/or preterm infants.

Congenital Zika virus infection as a silent pathology with loss of neurogenic output in the fetal brain.\n\nAbstract\nZika virus (ZIKV) is a flavivirus with teratogenic effects on fetal brain, but the spectrum of ZIKV-induced brain injury is unknown, particularly when ultrasound imaging is normal. In a pregnant pigtail macaque (_Macaca nemestrina_) model of ZIKV infection, we demonstrate that ZIKV-induced injury to fetal brain is substantial, even in the absence of microcephaly, and may be challenging to detect in a clinical setting. A common and subtle injury pattern was identified, including (i) periventricular T2-hyperintense foci and loss of fetal noncortical brain volume, (ii) injury to the ependymal epithelium with underlying gliosis and (iii) loss of late fetal neuronal progenitor cells in the subventricular zone (temporal cortex) and subgranular zone (dentate gyrus, hippocampus) with dysmorphic granule neuron patterning. Attenuation of fetal neurogenic output demonstrates potentially considerable teratogenic effects of congenital ZIKV infection even without microcephaly. Our findings suggest that all children exposed to ZIKV in utero should receive long-term monitoring for neurocognitive deficits, regardless of head size at birth.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[It will be of interest to find out if children infected in utero with Zika virus have any of the same teratogenic, long-term effects described in these cases in experimentally infected monkeys. - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[5] Fetal genetics and congenital Zika syndrome\nDate: Fri 2 Feb 2018\nSource: Nature Communications 9: 475 doi:10.1038/s41467-017-02790-9 [edited]\nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-017-02790-9#Sec12\n\n\nLuiz Carlos Caires-J\u00fanior, Ernesto Goulart, Uir\u00e1 Souto Melo, Bruno Silva Henrique Araujo, Lucas Alvizi, Alessandra Soares-Schanoski, et al. Discordant congenital Zika syndrome twins show differential in vitro viral susceptibility of neural progenitor cells.\n\nAbstract\nCongenital Zika syndrome (CZS) causes early brain development impairment by affecting neural progenitor cells (NPCs). Here, we analyze NPCs from 3 pairs of dizygotic twins discordant for CZS. We compare by RNA-Seq the NPCs derived from CZS-affected and CZS-unaffected twins. Prior to Zika virus (ZIKV) infection the NPCs from CZS babies show a significantly different gene expression signature of mTOR and Wnt pathway regulators, key to a neurodevelopmental program. Following ZIKV in vitro infection, cells from affected individuals have significantly higher ZIKV replication and reduced cell growth. Whole-exome analysis in 18 affected CZS babies as compared to 5 unaffected twins and 609 controls excludes a monogenic model to explain resistance or increased susceptibility to CZS development. Overall, our results indicate that CZS is not a stochastic event and depends on NPC intrinsic susceptibility, possibly related to oligogenic and/or epigenetic mechanisms.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Results of this study confirm the hypothesis of a genetic influence on susceptibility to the congenital Zika syndrome and microcephaly. - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[6] Mosquito vectors\nDate: Thu 15 Feb 2018\nSource: Peer J 6:e4324 https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.4324 [edited]\nhttps://peerj.com/articles/4324/\n\n\nDodson BL, Pujhari S, Rasgon JL. (2018) Vector competence of selected North American Anopheles and Culex mosquitoes for Zika virus. PeerJ 6:e4324https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.4324\n\nAbstract\nZika virus (ZIKV) is a vector-borne flavivirus that has caused recent outbreaks associated with serious disease in infants and newborns in the Americas. _Aedes_ mosquitoes are the primary vectors for ZIKV, but little is known about the diversity of mosquitoes that can transmit ZIKV in North America. We chose 3 abundant North American mosquito species (_Anopheles freeborni_, _Anopheles quadrimaculatus_, and _Culex tarsalis_) and one known vector species (_Aedes aegypti_), fed them blood meals supplemented with a recent outbreak ZIKV strain, and tested bodies, legs, and saliva for infectious ZIKV. ZIKV was able to infect, disseminate, and be transmitted by _Aedes aegypti_. However, _Anopheles freeborni_, _Anopheles quadrimaculatus_, and _Culex tarsalis_ were unable to be infected. We conclude that these species are unlikely to be involved in ZIKV transmission in North America. However, we should continue to examine the ability for other mosquito species to potentially act as ZIKV vectors in North America.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[It is reassuring to learn that these 3 species of widely-distributed mosquitoes in North America are refractory to Zika virus infection, leaving the main focus for vector control with _Aedes aegypti_, which has very limited distribution in North America. - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[7] Mosquito salivary enhancement\nDate: Mon 5 Mar 2018\nSource: Nature Immunology doi:10.1038/s41590-018-0063-9 [edited]\nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/s41590-018-0063-9\n\n\nLin Jin, Xiaomin Guo, Chuanbin Shen, Xue Hao, Peng Sun, et al. Salivary factor LTRIN from Aedes aegyptifacilitates the transmission of Zika virus by interfering with the lymphotoxin-\u03b2 receptor\n\nAbstract\nPathogens have co-evolved with mosquitoes to optimize transmission to hosts. Mosquito salivary-gland extract is known to modulate host immune responses and facilitate pathogen transmission, but the underlying molecular mechanisms of this have remained unknown. In this study, we identified and characterized a prominent 15-kilodalton protein, LTRIN, obtained from the salivary glands of the mosquito _Aedes aegypti_. LTRIN expression was upregulated in blood-fed mosquitoes, and LTRIN facilitated the transmission of Zika virus (ZIKV) and exacerbated its pathogenicity by interfering with signaling through the lymphotoxin-\u03b2 receptor (LT\u03b2R). Mechanically, LTRIN bound to LT\u03b2R and 'preferentially' inhibited signaling via the transcription factor NF-\u03baB and the production of inflammatory cytokines by interfering with the dimerization of LT\u03b2R during infection with ZIKV. Furthermore, treatment with antibody to LTRIN inhibited mosquito-mediated infection with ZIKV, and abolishing LT\u03b2R potentiated the infectivity of ZIKV both in vitro and in vivo. This study provides deeper insight into the transmission of mosquito-borne diseases in nature and supports the therapeutic potential of inhibiting the action of LTRIN to disrupt ZIKV transmission.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n******\n[8] Chimeric vaccine\nDate: Tue 27 Feb 2018\nSource: bioRxiv doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/272625 [edited]\nhttps://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/02/27/272625\n\n\nFranck Touret, Magali Gilles, Raphaelle Klitting, Fabien Aubry, Xavier de Lamballerie, Antoine Nougairede. Live Zika virus chimeric vaccine candidate based on a yellow fever 17-D attenuated backbone.\n\nAbstract\nZika virus (ZIKV) recently dispersed throughout the tropics and sub-tropics causing epidemics associated with congenital disease and neurological complications. There is currently no commercial vaccine for ZIKV. Here we describe the initial development of a chimeric virus containing the prM/E proteins of a ZIKV epidemic strain incorporated into a yellow fever 17-D attenuated backbone. Using the versatile and rapid ISA (Infectious Subgenomic Amplicons) reverse genetics method, we compared different constructs and confirmed the need to modify the cleavage site between the pre-peptide and prM protein. Using an immunocompromised mouse model, we demonstrate that mice infected with the chimeric virus produced levels of neutralizing antibodies close to those observed following infection with ZIKV and that pre-immunized mice were protected against subsequent viscerotropic and neuroinvasive virus following challenge with a heterologous strain of ZIKV. These data provide a sound basis for the future development of this ZIKV vaccine candidate.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[These results are very promising.

O'Neal, et al.\nPostnatal Zika virus infection is associated with persistent abnormalities in brain structure, function, and behavior in infant macaques.\n\nPostnatal perturbation by Zika virus\nMuch of the concern surrounding Zika virus infections focuses on fetuses infected in utero. Mavigner et al. reasoned that this neurotropic virus may have deleterious effects even after birth, so they set up a postnatal infection model to investigate. They found that infant rhesus macaques infected with Zika virus also had peripheral and central nervous system pathology. Longitudinal magnetic resonance imaging studies revealed that macaques that had been infected with Zika virus had structural and functional abnormalities and also altered emotional responses. These differences persisted months after the virus had been cleared. Although the work involved a small number of animals, their results suggest that infants and young children exposed to Zika virus should undergo more than just routine monitoring.\n\nAbstract\nThe Zika virus (ZIKV) epidemic is associated with fetal brain lesions and other serious birth defects classified as congenital ZIKV syndrome. Postnatal ZIKV infection in infants and children has been reported; however, data on brain anatomy, function, and behavioral outcomes following infection are absent. We show that postnatal ZIKV infection of infant rhesus macaques (RMs) results in persistent structural and functional alterations of the central nervous system compared to age-matched controls. We demonstrate ZIKV lymphoid tropism and neurotropism in infant RMs and histopathologic abnormalities in the peripheral and central nervous systems including inflammatory infiltrates, astrogliosis, and Wallerian degeneration. Structural and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI/rs-fMRI) show persistent enlargement of lateral ventricles, maturational changes in specific brain regions, and altered functional connectivity (FC) between brain areas involved in emotional behavior and arousal functions, including weakened amygdala-hippocampal connectivity in 2 of 2 ZIKV-infected infant RMs several months after clearance of ZIKV RNA from peripheral blood. ZIKV infection also results in distinct alterations in the species-typical emotional reactivity to acute stress, which were predicted by the weak amygdala-hippocampal FC. We demonstrate that postnatal ZIKV infection of infants in this model affects neurodevelopment, suggesting that long-term clinical monitoring of pediatric cases is warranted.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\nAnd\nHoward Steinberg\n<howard.steinberg@wisc.edu>\n\n[Although the numbers of infant monkeys is small, it provides enough evidence to justify evaluation of infants that have been infected with Zika virus as neonates. - Mod.TY]\n\n[The Zika virus outbreak in the Americas has diminished compared to the past 2 years (2016 and 2017), perhaps due to a smaller susceptible cohort of the human population. There are no reports yet of wide-spread reduction in the population of vector mosquitoes (_Aedes aegypti_) in the areas where Zika virus transmission has been frequent. It seems unlikely that Zika virus has disappeared from the Americas, and occurrence of sporadic outbreaks in the Americas would not be surprising. An epidemiologically important but yet unanswered question is if Zika virus has become established in non-human primates in the tropical Americas and can be transmitted by forest mosquitoes, in a sylvan maintenance cycle, as yellow fever virus has. -

CDC analyzed data from 15 U.S. jurisdictions conducting population-based surveillance for birth defects potentially related to Zika virus infection. All 15 U.S. jurisdictions included in this report had existing birth defects surveillance systems that were rapidly adapted to monitor birth defects potentially related to Zika virus infection. These jurisdictions provided data on live births and pregnancy losses occurring from 1 Jan - 31 Dec 2016. The prevalence of reported birth defects cases potentially related to Zika virus infection increased in jurisdictions with confirmed local transmission, from 2.8 per 1000 live births (182 cases) during the 1st half of 2016 to 3.0 per 1000 live births (211 cases) during the 2nd half (CI = 2.4-3.2 and CI = 2.6-3.4, respectively; p = 0.10). In \"higher\" Zika prevalence jurisdictions, the monitored birth defects prevalence was 3.0 per 1000 live births in both the 1st (753 cases) and 2nd (775 cases) halves of 2016. In \"lower\" prevalence jurisdictions, the monitored birth defects prevalence declined significantly from 3.4 per 1000 live births (549 cases) during the 1st half of 2016 to 3.0 (492 cases) per 1000 live births during the 2nd half (CI = 3.2-3.7 and CI = 2.8-3.3, respectively; p = 0.002).\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/67/wr/mm6703a2.htm?s_cid=mm6703a2_w\n\n- Preparedness USA.

Cardiac findings in infants with in utero exposure to Zika virus - a cross sectional study.\n\nAbstract\nBackground\nAntenatal exposure to Zika virus (ZIKV) is related to severe neurological manifestations. A previous study in Brazil reported an increased incidence of non-severe congenital heart defects in infants with diagnosis of congenital Zika syndrome but without laboratory confirmation of ZIKV infection in the mother or infant. The objective of this study is to report echocardiographic (ECHO) findings in infants with laboratory confirmed antenatal exposure to ZIKV.\nMethodology\nCross sectional study of cardiologic assessments of infants born between November 2015 and January 2017 with confirmed vertical exposure to ZIKV in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.\nResults\nThe study enrolled 120 children with a median age of 97 days (1 - 376 days). In utero exposure to ZIKV was confirmed in 97 children (80.8 percent) through positive maternal polymerase chain reaction (PCR) results during pregnancy or a positive PCR result at birth; 23 additional children (19.2 percent) had maternal positive PCR results during pregnancy and postnatally. Of the 120, 48 infants (40 percent) had cardiac defects noted on ECHO and 13 infants (10.8 percent) had major cardiac defects (atrial septal defect, ventricular septal defect, patent ductus arteriosus). None of the defects were severe. The frequency of major defects was higher in infants whose mothers had a rash in the 2nd trimester of pregnancy, or who had altered central nervous system (CNS) imaging postnatally or were preterm.\nConclusions\nInfants with in utero ZIKV exposure have a higher prevalence of major cardiac defects, however none were severe enough to require immediate intervention. For this reason, guidelines for performance of postnatal ECHO in this population should follow general newborn screening guidelines, which significantly reduces the burden of performing emergent fetal or neonatal ECHOs in a setting where resources are not available, such as most Brazilian municipalities.\nAuthor summary\nWe performed cardiologic assessment of 120 infants born between November 2015 and January 2017 with confirmed vertical exposure to Zika virus (ZIKV). The diagnosis of ZIKV exposure was confirmed by PCR in maternal blood specimens and/or amniotic fluid during pregnancy and/or infant specimens including PCR of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and/or urine following birth. Our study found a 10.8 percent incidence of structural heart defects in infants with a history of intrauterine exposure to ZIKV, a rate considerably higher than that observed in the general population. However, no patients were found to have severe structural heart defects. The presence of major defects was increased in infants whose mothers had a history of rash in the 2nd trimester, infants with altered CNS imaging and/or preterm infants. As severe heart defects requiring immediate intervention were not identified, guidelines for performance of postnatal ECHO in this population should follow the same criteria as the ones applicable to newborns in general, particularly since resources for performance of fetal and neonatal echocardiograms are not routinely available in most Brazilian municipalities\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n[Although structural heart defects were detected in 11 percent of the infants infected by Zika virus in utero, fortunately, none of these defects was serious enough to require immediate intervention.

Congenital Zika virus infection as a silent pathology with loss of neurogenic output in the fetal brain.\n\nAbstract\nZika virus (ZIKV) is a flavivirus with teratogenic effects on fetal brain, but the spectrum of ZIKV-induced brain injury is unknown, particularly when ultrasound imaging is normal. In a pregnant pigtail macaque (_Macaca nemestrina_) model of ZIKV infection, we demonstrate that ZIKV-induced injury to fetal brain is substantial, even in the absence of microcephaly, and may be challenging to detect in a clinical setting. A common and subtle injury pattern was identified, including (i) periventricular T2-hyperintense foci and loss of fetal noncortical brain volume, (ii) injury to the ependymal epithelium with underlying gliosis and (iii) loss of late fetal neuronal progenitor cells in the subventricular zone (temporal cortex) and subgranular zone (dentate gyrus, hippocampus) with dysmorphic granule neuron patterning. Attenuation of fetal neurogenic output demonstrates potentially considerable teratogenic effects of congenital ZIKV infection even without microcephaly. Our findings suggest that all children exposed to ZIKV in utero should receive long-term monitoring for neurocognitive deficits, regardless of head size at birth.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[It will be of interest to find out if children infected in utero with Zika virus have any of the same teratogenic, long-term effects described in these cases in experimentally infected monkeys. - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[5] Fetal genetics and congenital Zika syndrome\nDate: Fri 2 Feb 2018\nSource: Nature Communications 9: 475 doi:10.1038/s41467-017-02790-9 [edited]\nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-017-02790-9#Sec12\n\n\nLuiz Carlos Caires-J\u00fanior, Ernesto Goulart, Uir\u00e1 Souto Melo, Bruno Silva Henrique Araujo, Lucas Alvizi, Alessandra Soares-Schanoski, et al. Discordant congenital Zika syndrome twins show differential in vitro viral susceptibility of neural progenitor cells.\n\nAbstract\nCongenital Zika syndrome (CZS) causes early brain development impairment by affecting neural progenitor cells (NPCs). Here, we analyze NPCs from 3 pairs of dizygotic twins discordant for CZS. We compare by RNA-Seq the NPCs derived from CZS-affected and CZS-unaffected twins. Prior to Zika virus (ZIKV) infection the NPCs from CZS babies show a significantly different gene expression signature of mTOR and Wnt pathway regulators, key to a neurodevelopmental program. Following ZIKV in vitro infection, cells from affected individuals have significantly higher ZIKV replication and reduced cell growth. Whole-exome analysis in 18 affected CZS babies as compared to 5 unaffected twins and 609 controls excludes a monogenic model to explain resistance or increased susceptibility to CZS development. Overall, our results indicate that CZS is not a stochastic event and depends on NPC intrinsic susceptibility, possibly related to oligogenic and/or epigenetic mechanisms.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Results of this study confirm the hypothesis of a genetic influence on susceptibility to the congenital Zika syndrome and microcephaly. - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[6] Mosquito vectors\nDate: Thu 15 Feb 2018\nSource: Peer J 6:e4324 https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.4324 [edited]\nhttps://peerj.com/articles/4324/\n\n\nDodson BL, Pujhari S, Rasgon JL. (2018) Vector competence of selected North American Anopheles and Culex mosquitoes for Zika virus. PeerJ 6:e4324https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.4324\n\nAbstract\nZika virus (ZIKV) is a vector-borne flavivirus that has caused recent outbreaks associated with serious disease in infants and newborns in the Americas. _Aedes_ mosquitoes are the primary vectors for ZIKV, but little is known about the diversity of mosquitoes that can transmit ZIKV in North America. We chose 3 abundant North American mosquito species (_Anopheles freeborni_, _Anopheles quadrimaculatus_, and _Culex tarsalis_) and one known vector species (_Aedes aegypti_), fed them blood meals supplemented with a recent outbreak ZIKV strain, and tested bodies, legs, and saliva for infectious ZIKV. ZIKV was able to infect, disseminate, and be transmitted by _Aedes aegypti_. However, _Anopheles freeborni_, _Anopheles quadrimaculatus_, and _Culex tarsalis_ were unable to be infected. We conclude that these species are unlikely to be involved in ZIKV transmission in North America. However, we should continue to examine the ability for other mosquito species to potentially act as ZIKV vectors in North America.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[It is reassuring to learn that these 3 species of widely-distributed mosquitoes in North America are refractory to Zika virus infection, leaving the main focus for vector control with _Aedes aegypti_, which has very limited distribution in North America. - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[7] Mosquito salivary enhancement\nDate: Mon 5 Mar 2018\nSource: Nature Immunology doi:10.1038/s41590-018-0063-9 [edited]\nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/s41590-018-0063-9\n\n\nLin Jin, Xiaomin Guo, Chuanbin Shen, Xue Hao, Peng Sun, et al. Salivary factor LTRIN from Aedes aegyptifacilitates the transmission of Zika virus by interfering with the lymphotoxin-\u03b2 receptor\n\nAbstract\nPathogens have co-evolved with mosquitoes to optimize transmission to hosts. Mosquito salivary-gland extract is known to modulate host immune responses and facilitate pathogen transmission, but the underlying molecular mechanisms of this have remained unknown. In this study, we identified and characterized a prominent 15-kilodalton protein, LTRIN, obtained from the salivary glands of the mosquito _Aedes aegypti_. LTRIN expression was upregulated in blood-fed mosquitoes, and LTRIN facilitated the transmission of Zika virus (ZIKV) and exacerbated its pathogenicity by interfering with signaling through the lymphotoxin-\u03b2 receptor (LT\u03b2R). Mechanically, LTRIN bound to LT\u03b2R and 'preferentially' inhibited signaling via the transcription factor NF-\u03baB and the production of inflammatory cytokines by interfering with the dimerization of LT\u03b2R during infection with ZIKV. Furthermore, treatment with antibody to LTRIN inhibited mosquito-mediated infection with ZIKV, and abolishing LT\u03b2R potentiated the infectivity of ZIKV both in vitro and in vivo. This study provides deeper insight into the transmission of mosquito-borne diseases in nature and supports the therapeutic potential of inhibiting the action of LTRIN to disrupt ZIKV transmission.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n******\n[8] Chimeric vaccine\nDate: Tue 27 Feb 2018\nSource: bioRxiv doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/272625 [edited]\nhttps://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/02/27/272625\n\n\nFranck Touret, Magali Gilles, Raphaelle Klitting, Fabien Aubry, Xavier de Lamballerie, Antoine Nougairede. Live Zika virus chimeric vaccine candidate based on a yellow fever 17-D attenuated backbone.\n\nAbstract\nZika virus (ZIKV) recently dispersed throughout the tropics and sub-tropics causing epidemics associated with congenital disease and neurological complications. There is currently no commercial vaccine for ZIKV. Here we describe the initial development of a chimeric virus containing the prM/E proteins of a ZIKV epidemic strain incorporated into a yellow fever 17-D attenuated backbone. Using the versatile and rapid ISA (Infectious Subgenomic Amplicons) reverse genetics method, we compared different constructs and confirmed the need to modify the cleavage site between the pre-peptide and prM protein. Using an immunocompromised mouse model, we demonstrate that mice infected with the chimeric virus produced levels of neutralizing antibodies close to those observed following infection with ZIKV and that pre-immunized mice were protected against subsequent viscerotropic and neuroinvasive virus following challenge with a heterologous strain of ZIKV. These data provide a sound basis for the future development of this ZIKV vaccine candidate.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[These results are very promising.

O'Neal, et al.\nPostnatal Zika virus infection is associated with persistent abnormalities in brain structure, function, and behavior in infant macaques.\n\nPostnatal perturbation by Zika virus\nMuch of the concern surrounding Zika virus infections focuses on fetuses infected in utero. Mavigner et al. reasoned that this neurotropic virus may have deleterious effects even after birth, so they set up a postnatal infection model to investigate. They found that infant rhesus macaques infected with Zika virus also had peripheral and central nervous system pathology. Longitudinal magnetic resonance imaging studies revealed that macaques that had been infected with Zika virus had structural and functional abnormalities and also altered emotional responses. These differences persisted months after the virus had been cleared. Although the work involved a small number of animals, their results suggest that infants and young children exposed to Zika virus should undergo more than just routine monitoring.\n\nAbstract\nThe Zika virus (ZIKV) epidemic is associated with fetal brain lesions and other serious birth defects classified as congenital ZIKV syndrome. Postnatal ZIKV infection in infants and children has been reported; however, data on brain anatomy, function, and behavioral outcomes following infection are absent. We show that postnatal ZIKV infection of infant rhesus macaques (RMs) results in persistent structural and functional alterations of the central nervous system compared to age-matched controls. We demonstrate ZIKV lymphoid tropism and neurotropism in infant RMs and histopathologic abnormalities in the peripheral and central nervous systems including inflammatory infiltrates, astrogliosis, and Wallerian degeneration. Structural and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI/rs-fMRI) show persistent enlargement of lateral ventricles, maturational changes in specific brain regions, and altered functional connectivity (FC) between brain areas involved in emotional behavior and arousal functions, including weakened amygdala-hippocampal connectivity in 2 of 2 ZIKV-infected infant RMs several months after clearance of ZIKV RNA from peripheral blood. ZIKV infection also results in distinct alterations in the species-typical emotional reactivity to acute stress, which were predicted by the weak amygdala-hippocampal FC. We demonstrate that postnatal ZIKV infection of infants in this model affects neurodevelopment, suggesting that long-term clinical monitoring of pediatric cases is warranted.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\nAnd\nHoward Steinberg\n<howard.steinberg@wisc.edu>\n\n[Although the numbers of infant monkeys is small, it provides enough evidence to justify evaluation of infants that have been infected with Zika virus as neonates. - Mod.TY]\n\n[The Zika virus outbreak in the Americas has diminished compared to the past 2 years (2016 and 2017), perhaps due to a smaller susceptible cohort of the human population. There are no reports yet of wide-spread reduction in the population of vector mosquitoes (_Aedes aegypti_) in the areas where Zika virus transmission has been frequent. It seems unlikely that Zika virus has disappeared from the Americas, and occurrence of sporadic outbreaks in the Americas would not be surprising. An epidemiologically important but yet unanswered question is if Zika virus has become established in non-human primates in the tropical Americas and can be transmitted by forest mosquitoes, in a sylvan maintenance cycle, as yellow fever virus has. -

CDC analyzed data from 15 U.S. jurisdictions conducting population-based surveillance for birth defects potentially related to Zika virus infection. All 15 U.S. jurisdictions included in this report had existing birth defects surveillance systems that were rapidly adapted to monitor birth defects potentially related to Zika virus infection. These jurisdictions provided data on live births and pregnancy losses occurring from 1 Jan - 31 Dec 2016. The prevalence of reported birth defects cases potentially related to Zika virus infection increased in jurisdictions with confirmed local transmission, from 2.8 per 1000 live births (182 cases) during the 1st half of 2016 to 3.0 per 1000 live births (211 cases) during the 2nd half (CI = 2.4-3.2 and CI = 2.6-3.4, respectively; p = 0.10). In \"higher\" Zika prevalence jurisdictions, the monitored birth defects prevalence was 3.0 per 1000 live births in both the 1st (753 cases) and 2nd (775 cases) halves of 2016. In \"lower\" prevalence jurisdictions, the monitored birth defects prevalence declined significantly from 3.4 per 1000 live births (549 cases) during the 1st half of 2016 to 3.0 (492 cases) per 1000 live births during the 2nd half (CI = 3.2-3.7 and CI = 2.8-3.3, respectively; p = 0.002).\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/67/wr/mm6703a2.htm?s_cid=mm6703a2_w\n\n- Preparedness USA.

Cardiac findings in infants with in utero exposure to Zika virus - a cross sectional study.\n\nAbstract\nBackground\nAntenatal exposure to Zika virus (ZIKV) is related to severe neurological manifestations. A previous study in Brazil reported an increased incidence of non-severe congenital heart defects in infants with diagnosis of congenital Zika syndrome but without laboratory confirmation of ZIKV infection in the mother or infant. The objective of this study is to report echocardiographic (ECHO) findings in infants with laboratory confirmed antenatal exposure to ZIKV.\nMethodology\nCross sectional study of cardiologic assessments of infants born between November 2015 and January 2017 with confirmed vertical exposure to ZIKV in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.\nResults\nThe study enrolled 120 children with a median age of 97 days (1 - 376 days). In utero exposure to ZIKV was confirmed in 97 children (80.8 percent) through positive maternal polymerase chain reaction (PCR) results during pregnancy or a positive PCR result at birth; 23 additional children (19.2 percent) had maternal positive PCR results during pregnancy and postnatally. Of the 120, 48 infants (40 percent) had cardiac defects noted on ECHO and 13 infants (10.8 percent) had major cardiac defects (atrial septal defect, ventricular septal defect, patent ductus arteriosus). None of the defects were severe. The frequency of major defects was higher in infants whose mothers had a rash in the 2nd trimester of pregnancy, or who had altered central nervous system (CNS) imaging postnatally or were preterm.\nConclusions\nInfants with in utero ZIKV exposure have a higher prevalence of major cardiac defects, however none were severe enough to require immediate intervention. For this reason, guidelines for performance of postnatal ECHO in this population should follow general newborn screening guidelines, which significantly reduces the burden of performing emergent fetal or neonatal ECHOs in a setting where resources are not available, such as most Brazilian municipalities.\nAuthor summary\nWe performed cardiologic assessment of 120 infants born between November 2015 and January 2017 with confirmed vertical exposure to Zika virus (ZIKV). The diagnosis of ZIKV exposure was confirmed by PCR in maternal blood specimens and/or amniotic fluid during pregnancy and/or infant specimens including PCR of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and/or urine following birth. Our study found a 10.8 percent incidence of structural heart defects in infants with a history of intrauterine exposure to ZIKV, a rate considerably higher than that observed in the general population. However, no patients were found to have severe structural heart defects. The presence of major defects was increased in infants whose mothers had a history of rash in the 2nd trimester, infants with altered CNS imaging and/or preterm infants. As severe heart defects requiring immediate intervention were not identified, guidelines for performance of postnatal ECHO in this population should follow the same criteria as the ones applicable to newborns in general, particularly since resources for performance of fetal and neonatal echocardiograms are not routinely available in most Brazilian municipalities\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n[Although structural heart defects were detected in 11 percent of the infants infected by Zika virus in utero, fortunately, none of these defects was serious enough to require immediate intervention.

Congenital Zika virus infection as a silent pathology with loss of neurogenic output in the fetal brain.\n\nAbstract\nZika virus (ZIKV) is a flavivirus with teratogenic effects on fetal brain, but the spectrum of ZIKV-induced brain injury is unknown, particularly when ultrasound imaging is normal. In a pregnant pigtail macaque (_Macaca nemestrina_) model of ZIKV infection, we demonstrate that ZIKV-induced injury to fetal brain is substantial, even in the absence of microcephaly, and may be challenging to detect in a clinical setting. A common and subtle injury pattern was identified, including (i) periventricular T2-hyperintense foci and loss of fetal noncortical brain volume, (ii) injury to the ependymal epithelium with underlying gliosis and (iii) loss of late fetal neuronal progenitor cells in the subventricular zone (temporal cortex) and subgranular zone (dentate gyrus, hippocampus) with dysmorphic granule neuron patterning. Attenuation of fetal neurogenic output demonstrates potentially considerable teratogenic effects of congenital ZIKV infection even without microcephaly. Our findings suggest that all children exposed to ZIKV in utero should receive long-term monitoring for neurocognitive deficits, regardless of head size at birth.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[It will be of interest to find out if children infected in utero with Zika virus have any of the same teratogenic, long-term effects described in these cases in experimentally infected monkeys. - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[5] Fetal genetics and congenital Zika syndrome\nDate: Fri 2 Feb 2018\nSource: Nature Communications 9: 475 doi:10.1038/s41467-017-02790-9 [edited]\nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-017-02790-9#Sec12\n\n\nLuiz Carlos Caires-J\u00fanior, Ernesto Goulart, Uir\u00e1 Souto Melo, Bruno Silva Henrique Araujo, Lucas Alvizi, Alessandra Soares-Schanoski, et al. Discordant congenital Zika syndrome twins show differential in vitro viral susceptibility of neural progenitor cells.\n\nAbstract\nCongenital Zika syndrome (CZS) causes early brain development impairment by affecting neural progenitor cells (NPCs). Here, we analyze NPCs from 3 pairs of dizygotic twins discordant for CZS. We compare by RNA-Seq the NPCs derived from CZS-affected and CZS-unaffected twins. Prior to Zika virus (ZIKV) infection the NPCs from CZS babies show a significantly different gene expression signature of mTOR and Wnt pathway regulators, key to a neurodevelopmental program. Following ZIKV in vitro infection, cells from affected individuals have significantly higher ZIKV replication and reduced cell growth. Whole-exome analysis in 18 affected CZS babies as compared to 5 unaffected twins and 609 controls excludes a monogenic model to explain resistance or increased susceptibility to CZS development. Overall, our results indicate that CZS is not a stochastic event and depends on NPC intrinsic susceptibility, possibly related to oligogenic and/or epigenetic mechanisms.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Results of this study confirm the hypothesis of a genetic influence on susceptibility to the congenital Zika syndrome and microcephaly. - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[6] Mosquito vectors\nDate: Thu 15 Feb 2018\nSource: Peer J 6:e4324 https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.4324 [edited]\nhttps://peerj.com/articles/4324/\n\n\nDodson BL, Pujhari S, Rasgon JL. (2018) Vector competence of selected North American Anopheles and Culex mosquitoes for Zika virus. PeerJ 6:e4324https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.4324\n\nAbstract\nZika virus (ZIKV) is a vector-borne flavivirus that has caused recent outbreaks associated with serious disease in infants and newborns in the Americas. _Aedes_ mosquitoes are the primary vectors for ZIKV, but little is known about the diversity of mosquitoes that can transmit ZIKV in North America. We chose 3 abundant North American mosquito species (_Anopheles freeborni_, _Anopheles quadrimaculatus_, and _Culex tarsalis_) and one known vector species (_Aedes aegypti_), fed them blood meals supplemented with a recent outbreak ZIKV strain, and tested bodies, legs, and saliva for infectious ZIKV. ZIKV was able to infect, disseminate, and be transmitted by _Aedes aegypti_. However, _Anopheles freeborni_, _Anopheles quadrimaculatus_, and _Culex tarsalis_ were unable to be infected. We conclude that these species are unlikely to be involved in ZIKV transmission in North America. However, we should continue to examine the ability for other mosquito species to potentially act as ZIKV vectors in North America.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[It is reassuring to learn that these 3 species of widely-distributed mosquitoes in North America are refractory to Zika virus infection, leaving the main focus for vector control with _Aedes aegypti_, which has very limited distribution in North America. - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[7] Mosquito salivary enhancement\nDate: Mon 5 Mar 2018\nSource: Nature Immunology doi:10.1038/s41590-018-0063-9 [edited]\nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/s41590-018-0063-9\n\n\nLin Jin, Xiaomin Guo, Chuanbin Shen, Xue Hao, Peng Sun, et al. Salivary factor LTRIN from Aedes aegyptifacilitates the transmission of Zika virus by interfering with the lymphotoxin-\u03b2 receptor\n\nAbstract\nPathogens have co-evolved with mosquitoes to optimize transmission to hosts. Mosquito salivary-gland extract is known to modulate host immune responses and facilitate pathogen transmission, but the underlying molecular mechanisms of this have remained unknown. In this study, we identified and characterized a prominent 15-kilodalton protein, LTRIN, obtained from the salivary glands of the mosquito _Aedes aegypti_. LTRIN expression was upregulated in blood-fed mosquitoes, and LTRIN facilitated the transmission of Zika virus (ZIKV) and exacerbated its pathogenicity by interfering with signaling through the lymphotoxin-\u03b2 receptor (LT\u03b2R). Mechanically, LTRIN bound to LT\u03b2R and 'preferentially' inhibited signaling via the transcription factor NF-\u03baB and the production of inflammatory cytokines by interfering with the dimerization of LT\u03b2R during infection with ZIKV. Furthermore, treatment with antibody to LTRIN inhibited mosquito-mediated infection with ZIKV, and abolishing LT\u03b2R potentiated the infectivity of ZIKV both in vitro and in vivo. This study provides deeper insight into the transmission of mosquito-borne diseases in nature and supports the therapeutic potential of inhibiting the action of LTRIN to disrupt ZIKV transmission.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n******\n[8] Chimeric vaccine\nDate: Tue 27 Feb 2018\nSource: bioRxiv doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/272625 [edited]\nhttps://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/02/27/272625\n\n\nFranck Touret, Magali Gilles, Raphaelle Klitting, Fabien Aubry, Xavier de Lamballerie, Antoine Nougairede. Live Zika virus chimeric vaccine candidate based on a yellow fever 17-D attenuated backbone.\n\nAbstract\nZika virus (ZIKV) recently dispersed throughout the tropics and sub-tropics causing epidemics associated with congenital disease and neurological complications. There is currently no commercial vaccine for ZIKV. Here we describe the initial development of a chimeric virus containing the prM/E proteins of a ZIKV epidemic strain incorporated into a yellow fever 17-D attenuated backbone. Using the versatile and rapid ISA (Infectious Subgenomic Amplicons) reverse genetics method, we compared different constructs and confirmed the need to modify the cleavage site between the pre-peptide and prM protein. Using an immunocompromised mouse model, we demonstrate that mice infected with the chimeric virus produced levels of neutralizing antibodies close to those observed following infection with ZIKV and that pre-immunized mice were protected against subsequent viscerotropic and neuroinvasive virus following challenge with a heterologous strain of ZIKV. These data provide a sound basis for the future development of this ZIKV vaccine candidate.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[These results are very promising.

A recent report indicated development of t a high-density microarray comprising nonredundant 12-mer peptides that tile, with one-residue overlap, the proteomes of Zika, dengue, yellow fever, West Nile, Ilheus, Oropouche, and chikungunya viruses. Serological analysis enabled discovery of a ZIKV NS2B 20-residue peptide that had high sensitivity (96.0 percent) and specificity (95.9 percent) versus natural infection with or vaccination against dengue, chikungunya, yellow fever, West Nile, tick-borne encephalitis, or Japanese encephalitis virus in a microarray assay and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) of early-convalescent-phase sera (2 to 3 weeks after onset of symptomatic infection).

O'Neal, et al.\nPostnatal Zika virus infection is associated with persistent abnormalities in brain structure, function, and behavior in infant macaques.\n\nPostnatal perturbation by Zika virus\nMuch of the concern surrounding Zika virus infections focuses on fetuses infected in utero. Mavigner et al. reasoned that this neurotropic virus may have deleterious effects even after birth, so they set up a postnatal infection model to investigate. They found that infant rhesus macaques infected with Zika virus also had peripheral and central nervous system pathology. Longitudinal magnetic resonance imaging studies revealed that macaques that had been infected with Zika virus had structural and functional abnormalities and also altered emotional responses. These differences persisted months after the virus had been cleared. Although the work involved a small number of animals, their results suggest that infants and young children exposed to Zika virus should undergo more than just routine monitoring.\n\nAbstract\nThe Zika virus (ZIKV) epidemic is associated with fetal brain lesions and other serious birth defects classified as congenital ZIKV syndrome. Postnatal ZIKV infection in infants and children has been reported; however, data on brain anatomy, function, and behavioral outcomes following infection are absent. We show that postnatal ZIKV infection of infant rhesus macaques (RMs) results in persistent structural and functional alterations of the central nervous system compared to age-matched controls. We demonstrate ZIKV lymphoid tropism and neurotropism in infant RMs and histopathologic abnormalities in the peripheral and central nervous systems including inflammatory infiltrates, astrogliosis, and Wallerian degeneration. Structural and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI/rs-fMRI) show persistent enlargement of lateral ventricles, maturational changes in specific brain regions, and altered functional connectivity (FC) between brain areas involved in emotional behavior and arousal functions, including weakened amygdala-hippocampal connectivity in 2 of 2 ZIKV-infected infant RMs several months after clearance of ZIKV RNA from peripheral blood. ZIKV infection also results in distinct alterations in the species-typical emotional reactivity to acute stress, which were predicted by the weak amygdala-hippocampal FC. We demonstrate that postnatal ZIKV infection of infants in this model affects neurodevelopment, suggesting that long-term clinical monitoring of pediatric cases is warranted.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\nAnd\nHoward Steinberg\n<howard.steinberg@wisc.edu>\n\n[Although the numbers of infant monkeys is small, it provides enough evidence to justify evaluation of infants that have been infected with Zika virus as neonates. - Mod.TY]\n\n[The Zika virus outbreak in the Americas has diminished compared to the past 2 years (2016 and 2017), perhaps due to a smaller susceptible cohort of the human population. There are no reports yet of wide-spread reduction in the population of vector mosquitoes (_Aedes aegypti_) in the areas where Zika virus transmission has been frequent. It seems unlikely that Zika virus has disappeared from the Americas, and occurrence of sporadic outbreaks in the Americas would not be surprising. An epidemiologically important but yet unanswered question is if Zika virus has become established in non-human primates in the tropical Americas and can be transmitted by forest mosquitoes, in a sylvan maintenance cycle, as yellow fever virus has. -

Cardiac findings in infants with in utero exposure to Zika virus - a cross sectional study.\n\nAbstract\nBackground\nAntenatal exposure to Zika virus (ZIKV) is related to severe neurological manifestations. A previous study in Brazil reported an increased incidence of non-severe congenital heart defects in infants with diagnosis of congenital Zika syndrome but without laboratory confirmation of ZIKV infection in the mother or infant. The objective of this study is to report echocardiographic (ECHO) findings in infants with laboratory confirmed antenatal exposure to ZIKV.\nMethodology\nCross sectional study of cardiologic assessments of infants born between November 2015 and January 2017 with confirmed vertical exposure to ZIKV in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.\nResults\nThe study enrolled 120 children with a median age of 97 days (1 - 376 days). In utero exposure to ZIKV was confirmed in 97 children (80.8 percent) through positive maternal polymerase chain reaction (PCR) results during pregnancy or a positive PCR result at birth; 23 additional children (19.2 percent) had maternal positive PCR results during pregnancy and postnatally. Of the 120, 48 infants (40 percent) had cardiac defects noted on ECHO and 13 infants (10.8 percent) had major cardiac defects (atrial septal defect, ventricular septal defect, patent ductus arteriosus). None of the defects were severe. The frequency of major defects was higher in infants whose mothers had a rash in the 2nd trimester of pregnancy, or who had altered central nervous system (CNS) imaging postnatally or were preterm.\nConclusions\nInfants with in utero ZIKV exposure have a higher prevalence of major cardiac defects, however none were severe enough to require immediate intervention. For this reason, guidelines for performance of postnatal ECHO in this population should follow general newborn screening guidelines, which significantly reduces the burden of performing emergent fetal or neonatal ECHOs in a setting where resources are not available, such as most Brazilian municipalities.\nAuthor summary\nWe performed cardiologic assessment of 120 infants born between November 2015 and January 2017 with confirmed vertical exposure to Zika virus (ZIKV). The diagnosis of ZIKV exposure was confirmed by PCR in maternal blood specimens and/or amniotic fluid during pregnancy and/or infant specimens including PCR of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and/or urine following birth. Our study found a 10.8 percent incidence of structural heart defects in infants with a history of intrauterine exposure to ZIKV, a rate considerably higher than that observed in the general population.

The presence of major defects was increased in infants whose mothers had a history of rash in the 2nd trimester, infants with altered CNS imaging and/or preterm infants.

Congenital Zika virus infection as a silent pathology with loss of neurogenic output in the fetal brain.\n\nAbstract\nZika virus (ZIKV) is a flavivirus with teratogenic effects on fetal brain, but the spectrum of ZIKV-induced brain injury is unknown, particularly when ultrasound imaging is normal. In a pregnant pigtail macaque (_Macaca nemestrina_) model of ZIKV infection, we demonstrate that ZIKV-induced injury to fetal brain is substantial, even in the absence of microcephaly, and may be challenging to detect in a clinical setting. A common and subtle injury pattern was identified, including (i) periventricular T2-hyperintense foci and loss of fetal noncortical brain volume, (ii) injury to the ependymal epithelium with underlying gliosis and (iii) loss of late fetal neuronal progenitor cells in the subventricular zone (temporal cortex) and subgranular zone (dentate gyrus, hippocampus) with dysmorphic granule neuron patterning. Attenuation of fetal neurogenic output demonstrates potentially considerable teratogenic effects of congenital ZIKV infection even without microcephaly. Our findings suggest that all children exposed to ZIKV in utero should receive long-term monitoring for neurocognitive deficits, regardless of head size at birth.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[It will be of interest to find out if children infected in utero with Zika virus have any of the same teratogenic, long-term effects described in these cases in experimentally infected monkeys. - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[5] Fetal genetics and congenital Zika syndrome\nDate: Fri 2 Feb 2018\nSource: Nature Communications 9: 475 doi:10.1038/s41467-017-02790-9 [edited]\nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-017-02790-9#Sec12\n\n\nLuiz Carlos Caires-J\u00fanior, Ernesto Goulart, Uir\u00e1 Souto Melo, Bruno Silva Henrique Araujo, Lucas Alvizi, Alessandra Soares-Schanoski, et al. Discordant congenital Zika syndrome twins show differential in vitro viral susceptibility of neural progenitor cells.\n\nAbstract\nCongenital Zika syndrome (CZS) causes early brain development impairment by affecting neural progenitor cells (NPCs). Here, we analyze NPCs from 3 pairs of dizygotic twins discordant for CZS. We compare by RNA-Seq the NPCs derived from CZS-affected and CZS-unaffected twins. Prior to Zika virus (ZIKV) infection the NPCs from CZS babies show a significantly different gene expression signature of mTOR and Wnt pathway regulators, key to a neurodevelopmental program. Following ZIKV in vitro infection, cells from affected individuals have significantly higher ZIKV replication and reduced cell growth. Whole-exome analysis in 18 affected CZS babies as compared to 5 unaffected twins and 609 controls excludes a monogenic model to explain resistance or increased susceptibility to CZS development. Overall, our results indicate that CZS is not a stochastic event and depends on NPC intrinsic susceptibility, possibly related to oligogenic and/or epigenetic mechanisms.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Results of this study confirm the hypothesis of a genetic influence on susceptibility to the congenital Zika syndrome and microcephaly. - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[6] Mosquito vectors\nDate: Thu 15 Feb 2018\nSource: Peer J 6:e4324 https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.4324 [edited]\nhttps://peerj.com/articles/4324/\n\n\nDodson BL, Pujhari S, Rasgon JL. (2018) Vector competence of selected North American Anopheles and Culex mosquitoes for Zika virus. PeerJ 6:e4324https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.4324\n\nAbstract\nZika virus (ZIKV) is a vector-borne flavivirus that has caused recent outbreaks associated with serious disease in infants and newborns in the Americas. _Aedes_ mosquitoes are the primary vectors for ZIKV, but little is known about the diversity of mosquitoes that can transmit ZIKV in North America. We chose 3 abundant North American mosquito species (_Anopheles freeborni_, _Anopheles quadrimaculatus_, and _Culex tarsalis_) and one known vector species (_Aedes aegypti_), fed them blood meals supplemented with a recent outbreak ZIKV strain, and tested bodies, legs, and saliva for infectious ZIKV. ZIKV was able to infect, disseminate, and be transmitted by _Aedes aegypti_. However, _Anopheles freeborni_, _Anopheles quadrimaculatus_, and _Culex tarsalis_ were unable to be infected. We conclude that these species are unlikely to be involved in ZIKV transmission in North America. However, we should continue to examine the ability for other mosquito species to potentially act as ZIKV vectors in North America.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[It is reassuring to learn that these 3 species of widely-distributed mosquitoes in North America are refractory to Zika virus infection, leaving the main focus for vector control with _Aedes aegypti_, which has very limited distribution in North America. - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[7] Mosquito salivary enhancement\nDate: Mon 5 Mar 2018\nSource: Nature Immunology doi:10.1038/s41590-018-0063-9 [edited]\nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/s41590-018-0063-9\n\n\nLin Jin, Xiaomin Guo, Chuanbin Shen, Xue Hao, Peng Sun, et al. Salivary factor LTRIN from Aedes aegyptifacilitates the transmission of Zika virus by interfering with the lymphotoxin-\u03b2 receptor\n\nAbstract\nPathogens have co-evolved with mosquitoes to optimize transmission to hosts. Mosquito salivary-gland extract is known to modulate host immune responses and facilitate pathogen transmission, but the underlying molecular mechanisms of this have remained unknown. In this study, we identified and characterized a prominent 15-kilodalton protein, LTRIN, obtained from the salivary glands of the mosquito _Aedes aegypti_. LTRIN expression was upregulated in blood-fed mosquitoes, and LTRIN facilitated the transmission of Zika virus (ZIKV) and exacerbated its pathogenicity by interfering with signaling through the lymphotoxin-\u03b2 receptor (LT\u03b2R). Mechanically, LTRIN bound to LT\u03b2R and 'preferentially' inhibited signaling via the transcription factor NF-\u03baB and the production of inflammatory cytokines by interfering with the dimerization of LT\u03b2R during infection with ZIKV. Furthermore, treatment with antibody to LTRIN inhibited mosquito-mediated infection with ZIKV, and abolishing LT\u03b2R potentiated the infectivity of ZIKV both in vitro and in vivo. This study provides deeper insight into the transmission of mosquito-borne diseases in nature and supports the therapeutic potential of inhibiting the action of LTRIN to disrupt ZIKV transmission.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n******\n[8] Chimeric vaccine\nDate: Tue 27 Feb 2018\nSource: bioRxiv doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/272625 [edited]\nhttps://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/02/27/272625\n\n\nFranck Touret, Magali Gilles, Raphaelle Klitting, Fabien Aubry, Xavier de Lamballerie, Antoine Nougairede. Live Zika virus chimeric vaccine candidate based on a yellow fever 17-D attenuated backbone.\n\nAbstract\nZika virus (ZIKV) recently dispersed throughout the tropics and sub-tropics causing epidemics associated with congenital disease and neurological complications. There is currently no commercial vaccine for ZIKV. Here we describe the initial development of a chimeric virus containing the prM/E proteins of a ZIKV epidemic strain incorporated into a yellow fever 17-D attenuated backbone. Using the versatile and rapid ISA (Infectious Subgenomic Amplicons) reverse genetics method, we compared different constructs and confirmed the need to modify the cleavage site between the pre-peptide and prM protein. Using an immunocompromised mouse model, we demonstrate that mice infected with the chimeric virus produced levels of neutralizing antibodies close to those observed following infection with ZIKV and that pre-immunized mice were protected against subsequent viscerotropic and neuroinvasive virus following challenge with a heterologous strain of ZIKV. These data provide a sound basis for the future development of this ZIKV vaccine candidate.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[These results are very promising.

O'Neal, et al.\nPostnatal Zika virus infection is associated with persistent abnormalities in brain structure, function, and behavior in infant macaques.\n\nPostnatal perturbation by Zika virus\nMuch of the concern surrounding Zika virus infections focuses on fetuses infected in utero. Mavigner et al. reasoned that this neurotropic virus may have deleterious effects even after birth, so they set up a postnatal infection model to investigate. They found that infant rhesus macaques infected with Zika virus also had peripheral and central nervous system pathology. Longitudinal magnetic resonance imaging studies revealed that macaques that had been infected with Zika virus had structural and functional abnormalities and also altered emotional responses. These differences persisted months after the virus had been cleared. Although the work involved a small number of animals, their results suggest that infants and young children exposed to Zika virus should undergo more than just routine monitoring.\n\nAbstract\nThe Zika virus (ZIKV) epidemic is associated with fetal brain lesions and other serious birth defects classified as congenital ZIKV syndrome. Postnatal ZIKV infection in infants and children has been reported; however, data on brain anatomy, function, and behavioral outcomes following infection are absent. We show that postnatal ZIKV infection of infant rhesus macaques (RMs) results in persistent structural and functional alterations of the central nervous system compared to age-matched controls. We demonstrate ZIKV lymphoid tropism and neurotropism in infant RMs and histopathologic abnormalities in the peripheral and central nervous systems including inflammatory infiltrates, astrogliosis, and Wallerian degeneration. Structural and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI/rs-fMRI) show persistent enlargement of lateral ventricles, maturational changes in specific brain regions, and altered functional connectivity (FC) between brain areas involved in emotional behavior and arousal functions, including weakened amygdala-hippocampal connectivity in 2 of 2 ZIKV-infected infant RMs several months after clearance of ZIKV RNA from peripheral blood. ZIKV infection also results in distinct alterations in the species-typical emotional reactivity to acute stress, which were predicted by the weak amygdala-hippocampal FC. We demonstrate that postnatal ZIKV infection of infants in this model affects neurodevelopment, suggesting that long-term clinical monitoring of pediatric cases is warranted.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\nAnd\nHoward Steinberg\n<howard.steinberg@wisc.edu>\n\n[Although the numbers of infant monkeys is small, it provides enough evidence to justify evaluation of infants that have been infected with Zika virus as neonates. - Mod.TY]\n\n[The Zika virus outbreak in the Americas has diminished compared to the past 2 years (2016 and 2017), perhaps due to a smaller susceptible cohort of the human population. There are no reports yet of wide-spread reduction in the population of vector mosquitoes (_Aedes aegypti_) in the areas where Zika virus transmission has been frequent. It seems unlikely that Zika virus has disappeared from the Americas, and occurrence of sporadic outbreaks in the Americas would not be surprising. An epidemiologically important but yet unanswered question is if Zika virus has become established in non-human primates in the tropical Americas and can be transmitted by forest mosquitoes, in a sylvan maintenance cycle, as yellow fever virus has. -

CDC analyzed data from 15 U.S. jurisdictions conducting population-based surveillance for birth defects potentially related to Zika virus infection. All 15 U.S. jurisdictions included in this report had existing birth defects surveillance systems that were rapidly adapted to monitor birth defects potentially related to Zika virus infection. These jurisdictions provided data on live births and pregnancy losses occurring from 1 Jan - 31 Dec 2016. The prevalence of reported birth defects cases potentially related to Zika virus infection increased in jurisdictions with confirmed local transmission, from 2.8 per 1000 live births (182 cases) during the 1st half of 2016 to 3.0 per 1000 live births (211 cases) during the 2nd half (CI = 2.4-3.2 and CI = 2.6-3.4, respectively; p = 0.10). In \"higher\" Zika prevalence jurisdictions, the monitored birth defects prevalence was 3.0 per 1000 live births in both the 1st (753 cases) and 2nd (775 cases) halves of 2016. In \"lower\" prevalence jurisdictions, the monitored birth defects prevalence declined significantly from 3.4 per 1000 live births (549 cases) during the 1st half of 2016 to 3.0 (492 cases) per 1000 live births during the 2nd half (CI = 3.2-3.7 and CI = 2.8-3.3, respectively; p = 0.002).\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/67/wr/mm6703a2.htm?s_cid=mm6703a2_w\n\n- Preparedness USA.

Cardiac findings in infants with in utero exposure to Zika virus - a cross sectional study.\n\nAbstract\nBackground\nAntenatal exposure to Zika virus (ZIKV) is related to severe neurological manifestations. A previous study in Brazil reported an increased incidence of non-severe congenital heart defects in infants with diagnosis of congenital Zika syndrome but without laboratory confirmation of ZIKV infection in the mother or infant. The objective of this study is to report echocardiographic (ECHO) findings in infants with laboratory confirmed antenatal exposure to ZIKV.\nMethodology\nCross sectional study of cardiologic assessments of infants born between November 2015 and January 2017 with confirmed vertical exposure to ZIKV in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.\nResults\nThe study enrolled 120 children with a median age of 97 days (1 - 376 days). In utero exposure to ZIKV was confirmed in 97 children (80.8 percent) through positive maternal polymerase chain reaction (PCR) results during pregnancy or a positive PCR result at birth; 23 additional children (19.2 percent) had maternal positive PCR results during pregnancy and postnatally. Of the 120, 48 infants (40 percent) had cardiac defects noted on ECHO and 13 infants (10.8 percent) had major cardiac defects (atrial septal defect, ventricular septal defect, patent ductus arteriosus). None of the defects were severe. The frequency of major defects was higher in infants whose mothers had a rash in the 2nd trimester of pregnancy, or who had altered central nervous system (CNS) imaging postnatally or were preterm.\nConclusions\nInfants with in utero ZIKV exposure have a higher prevalence of major cardiac defects, however none were severe enough to require immediate intervention. For this reason, guidelines for performance of postnatal ECHO in this population should follow general newborn screening guidelines, which significantly reduces the burden of performing emergent fetal or neonatal ECHOs in a setting where resources are not available, such as most Brazilian municipalities.\nAuthor summary\nWe performed cardiologic assessment of 120 infants born between November 2015 and January 2017 with confirmed vertical exposure to Zika virus (ZIKV). The diagnosis of ZIKV exposure was confirmed by PCR in maternal blood specimens and/or amniotic fluid during pregnancy and/or infant specimens including PCR of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and/or urine following birth. Our study found a 10.8 percent incidence of structural heart defects in infants with a history of intrauterine exposure to ZIKV, a rate considerably higher than that observed in the general population. However, no patients were found to have severe structural heart defects. The presence of major defects was increased in infants whose mothers had a history of rash in the 2nd trimester, infants with altered CNS imaging and/or preterm infants. As severe heart defects requiring immediate intervention were not identified, guidelines for performance of postnatal ECHO in this population should follow the same criteria as the ones applicable to newborns in general, particularly since resources for performance of fetal and neonatal echocardiograms are not routinely available in most Brazilian municipalities\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n[Although structural heart defects were detected in 11 percent of the infants infected by Zika virus in utero, fortunately, none of these defects was serious enough to require immediate intervention.

Congenital Zika virus infection as a silent pathology with loss of neurogenic output in the fetal brain.\n\nAbstract\nZika virus (ZIKV) is a flavivirus with teratogenic effects on fetal brain, but the spectrum of ZIKV-induced brain injury is unknown, particularly when ultrasound imaging is normal. In a pregnant pigtail macaque (_Macaca nemestrina_) model of ZIKV infection, we demonstrate that ZIKV-induced injury to fetal brain is substantial, even in the absence of microcephaly, and may be challenging to detect in a clinical setting. A common and subtle injury pattern was identified, including (i) periventricular T2-hyperintense foci and loss of fetal noncortical brain volume, (ii) injury to the ependymal epithelium with underlying gliosis and (iii) loss of late fetal neuronal progenitor cells in the subventricular zone (temporal cortex) and subgranular zone (dentate gyrus, hippocampus) with dysmorphic granule neuron patterning. Attenuation of fetal neurogenic output demonstrates potentially considerable teratogenic effects of congenital ZIKV infection even without microcephaly. Our findings suggest that all children exposed to ZIKV in utero should receive long-term monitoring for neurocognitive deficits, regardless of head size at birth.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[It will be of interest to find out if children infected in utero with Zika virus have any of the same teratogenic, long-term effects described in these cases in experimentally infected monkeys. - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[5] Fetal genetics and congenital Zika syndrome\nDate: Fri 2 Feb 2018\nSource: Nature Communications 9: 475 doi:10.1038/s41467-017-02790-9 [edited]\nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-017-02790-9#Sec12\n\n\nLuiz Carlos Caires-J\u00fanior, Ernesto Goulart, Uir\u00e1 Souto Melo, Bruno Silva Henrique Araujo, Lucas Alvizi, Alessandra Soares-Schanoski, et al. Discordant congenital Zika syndrome twins show differential in vitro viral susceptibility of neural progenitor cells.\n\nAbstract\nCongenital Zika syndrome (CZS) causes early brain development impairment by affecting neural progenitor cells (NPCs). Here, we analyze NPCs from 3 pairs of dizygotic twins discordant for CZS. We compare by RNA-Seq the NPCs derived from CZS-affected and CZS-unaffected twins. Prior to Zika virus (ZIKV) infection the NPCs from CZS babies show a significantly different gene expression signature of mTOR and Wnt pathway regulators, key to a neurodevelopmental program. Following ZIKV in vitro infection, cells from affected individuals have significantly higher ZIKV replication and reduced cell growth. Whole-exome analysis in 18 affected CZS babies as compared to 5 unaffected twins and 609 controls excludes a monogenic model to explain resistance or increased susceptibility to CZS development. Overall, our results indicate that CZS is not a stochastic event and depends on NPC intrinsic susceptibility, possibly related to oligogenic and/or epigenetic mechanisms.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Results of this study confirm the hypothesis of a genetic influence on susceptibility to the congenital Zika syndrome and microcephaly. - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[6] Mosquito vectors\nDate: Thu 15 Feb 2018\nSource: Peer J 6:e4324 https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.4324 [edited]\nhttps://peerj.com/articles/4324/\n\n\nDodson BL, Pujhari S, Rasgon JL. (2018) Vector competence of selected North American Anopheles and Culex mosquitoes for Zika virus. PeerJ 6:e4324https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.4324\n\nAbstract\nZika virus (ZIKV) is a vector-borne flavivirus that has caused recent outbreaks associated with serious disease in infants and newborns in the Americas. _Aedes_ mosquitoes are the primary vectors for ZIKV, but little is known about the diversity of mosquitoes that can transmit ZIKV in North America. We chose 3 abundant North American mosquito species (_Anopheles freeborni_, _Anopheles quadrimaculatus_, and _Culex tarsalis_) and one known vector species (_Aedes aegypti_), fed them blood meals supplemented with a recent outbreak ZIKV strain, and tested bodies, legs, and saliva for infectious ZIKV. ZIKV was able to infect, disseminate, and be transmitted by _Aedes aegypti_. However, _Anopheles freeborni_, _Anopheles quadrimaculatus_, and _Culex tarsalis_ were unable to be infected. We conclude that these species are unlikely to be involved in ZIKV transmission in North America. However, we should continue to examine the ability for other mosquito species to potentially act as ZIKV vectors in North America.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[It is reassuring to learn that these 3 species of widely-distributed mosquitoes in North America are refractory to Zika virus infection, leaving the main focus for vector control with _Aedes aegypti_, which has very limited distribution in North America. - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[7] Mosquito salivary enhancement\nDate: Mon 5 Mar 2018\nSource: Nature Immunology doi:10.1038/s41590-018-0063-9 [edited]\nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/s41590-018-0063-9\n\n\nLin Jin, Xiaomin Guo, Chuanbin Shen, Xue Hao, Peng Sun, et al. Salivary factor LTRIN from Aedes aegyptifacilitates the transmission of Zika virus by interfering with the lymphotoxin-\u03b2 receptor\n\nAbstract\nPathogens have co-evolved with mosquitoes to optimize transmission to hosts. Mosquito salivary-gland extract is known to modulate host immune responses and facilitate pathogen transmission, but the underlying molecular mechanisms of this have remained unknown. In this study, we identified and characterized a prominent 15-kilodalton protein, LTRIN, obtained from the salivary glands of the mosquito _Aedes aegypti_. LTRIN expression was upregulated in blood-fed mosquitoes, and LTRIN facilitated the transmission of Zika virus (ZIKV) and exacerbated its pathogenicity by interfering with signaling through the lymphotoxin-\u03b2 receptor (LT\u03b2R). Mechanically, LTRIN bound to LT\u03b2R and 'preferentially' inhibited signaling via the transcription factor NF-\u03baB and the production of inflammatory cytokines by interfering with the dimerization of LT\u03b2R during infection with ZIKV. Furthermore, treatment with antibody to LTRIN inhibited mosquito-mediated infection with ZIKV, and abolishing LT\u03b2R potentiated the infectivity of ZIKV both in vitro and in vivo. This study provides deeper insight into the transmission of mosquito-borne diseases in nature and supports the therapeutic potential of inhibiting the action of LTRIN to disrupt ZIKV transmission.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n******\n[8] Chimeric vaccine\nDate: Tue 27 Feb 2018\nSource: bioRxiv doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/272625 [edited]\nhttps://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/02/27/272625\n\n\nFranck Touret, Magali Gilles, Raphaelle Klitting, Fabien Aubry, Xavier de Lamballerie, Antoine Nougairede. Live Zika virus chimeric vaccine candidate based on a yellow fever 17-D attenuated backbone.\n\nAbstract\nZika virus (ZIKV) recently dispersed throughout the tropics and sub-tropics causing epidemics associated with congenital disease and neurological complications. There is currently no commercial vaccine for ZIKV. Here we describe the initial development of a chimeric virus containing the prM/E proteins of a ZIKV epidemic strain incorporated into a yellow fever 17-D attenuated backbone. Using the versatile and rapid ISA (Infectious Subgenomic Amplicons) reverse genetics method, we compared different constructs and confirmed the need to modify the cleavage site between the pre-peptide and prM protein. Using an immunocompromised mouse model, we demonstrate that mice infected with the chimeric virus produced levels of neutralizing antibodies close to those observed following infection with ZIKV and that pre-immunized mice were protected against subsequent viscerotropic and neuroinvasive virus following challenge with a heterologous strain of ZIKV. These data provide a sound basis for the future development of this ZIKV vaccine candidate.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[These results are very promising.

O'Neal, et al.\nPostnatal Zika virus infection is associated with persistent abnormalities in brain structure, function, and behavior in infant macaques.\n\nPostnatal perturbation by Zika virus\nMuch of the concern surrounding Zika virus infections focuses on fetuses infected in utero. Mavigner et al. reasoned that this neurotropic virus may have deleterious effects even after birth, so they set up a postnatal infection model to investigate. They found that infant rhesus macaques infected with Zika virus also had peripheral and central nervous system pathology. Longitudinal magnetic resonance imaging studies revealed that macaques that had been infected with Zika virus had structural and functional abnormalities and also altered emotional responses. These differences persisted months after the virus had been cleared. Although the work involved a small number of animals, their results suggest that infants and young children exposed to Zika virus should undergo more than just routine monitoring.\n\nAbstract\nThe Zika virus (ZIKV) epidemic is associated with fetal brain lesions and other serious birth defects classified as congenital ZIKV syndrome. Postnatal ZIKV infection in infants and children has been reported; however, data on brain anatomy, function, and behavioral outcomes following infection are absent. We show that postnatal ZIKV infection of infant rhesus macaques (RMs) results in persistent structural and functional alterations of the central nervous system compared to age-matched controls. We demonstrate ZIKV lymphoid tropism and neurotropism in infant RMs and histopathologic abnormalities in the peripheral and central nervous systems including inflammatory infiltrates, astrogliosis, and Wallerian degeneration. Structural and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI/rs-fMRI) show persistent enlargement of lateral ventricles, maturational changes in specific brain regions, and altered functional connectivity (FC) between brain areas involved in emotional behavior and arousal functions, including weakened amygdala-hippocampal connectivity in 2 of 2 ZIKV-infected infant RMs several months after clearance of ZIKV RNA from peripheral blood. ZIKV infection also results in distinct alterations in the species-typical emotional reactivity to acute stress, which were predicted by the weak amygdala-hippocampal FC. We demonstrate that postnatal ZIKV infection of infants in this model affects neurodevelopment, suggesting that long-term clinical monitoring of pediatric cases is warranted.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\nAnd\nHoward Steinberg\n<howard.steinberg@wisc.edu>\n\n[Although the numbers of infant monkeys is small, it provides enough evidence to justify evaluation of infants that have been infected with Zika virus as neonates. - Mod.TY]\n\n[The Zika virus outbreak in the Americas has diminished compared to the past 2 years (2016 and 2017), perhaps due to a smaller susceptible cohort of the human population. There are no reports yet of wide-spread reduction in the population of vector mosquitoes (_Aedes aegypti_) in the areas where Zika virus transmission has been frequent. It seems unlikely that Zika virus has disappeared from the Americas, and occurrence of sporadic outbreaks in the Americas would not be surprising. An epidemiologically important but yet unanswered question is if Zika virus has become established in non-human primates in the tropical Americas and can be transmitted by forest mosquitoes, in a sylvan maintenance cycle, as yellow fever virus has. -

CDC analyzed data from 15 U.S. jurisdictions conducting population-based surveillance for birth defects potentially related to Zika virus infection. All 15 U.S. jurisdictions included in this report had existing birth defects surveillance systems that were rapidly adapted to monitor birth defects potentially related to Zika virus infection. These jurisdictions provided data on live births and pregnancy losses occurring from 1 Jan - 31 Dec 2016. The prevalence of reported birth defects cases potentially related to Zika virus infection increased in jurisdictions with confirmed local transmission, from 2.8 per 1000 live births (182 cases) during the 1st half of 2016 to 3.0 per 1000 live births (211 cases) during the 2nd half (CI = 2.4-3.2 and CI = 2.6-3.4, respectively; p = 0.10). In \"higher\" Zika prevalence jurisdictions, the monitored birth defects prevalence was 3.0 per 1000 live births in both the 1st (753 cases) and 2nd (775 cases) halves of 2016. In \"lower\" prevalence jurisdictions, the monitored birth defects prevalence declined significantly from 3.4 per 1000 live births (549 cases) during the 1st half of 2016 to 3.0 (492 cases) per 1000 live births during the 2nd half (CI = 3.2-3.7 and CI = 2.8-3.3, respectively; p = 0.002).\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/67/wr/mm6703a2.htm?s_cid=mm6703a2_w\n\n- Preparedness USA.

Cardiac findings in infants with in utero exposure to Zika virus - a cross sectional study.\n\nAbstract\nBackground\nAntenatal exposure to Zika virus (ZIKV) is related to severe neurological manifestations. A previous study in Brazil reported an increased incidence of non-severe congenital heart defects in infants with diagnosis of congenital Zika syndrome but without laboratory confirmation of ZIKV infection in the mother or infant. The objective of this study is to report echocardiographic (ECHO) findings in infants with laboratory confirmed antenatal exposure to ZIKV.\nMethodology\nCross sectional study of cardiologic assessments of infants born between November 2015 and January 2017 with confirmed vertical exposure to ZIKV in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.\nResults\nThe study enrolled 120 children with a median age of 97 days (1 - 376 days). In utero exposure to ZIKV was confirmed in 97 children (80.8 percent) through positive maternal polymerase chain reaction (PCR) results during pregnancy or a positive PCR result at birth; 23 additional children (19.2 percent) had maternal positive PCR results during pregnancy and postnatally. Of the 120, 48 infants (40 percent) had cardiac defects noted on ECHO and 13 infants (10.8 percent) had major cardiac defects (atrial septal defect, ventricular septal defect, patent ductus arteriosus). None of the defects were severe. The frequency of major defects was higher in infants whose mothers had a rash in the 2nd trimester of pregnancy, or who had altered central nervous system (CNS) imaging postnatally or were preterm.\nConclusions\nInfants with in utero ZIKV exposure have a higher prevalence of major cardiac defects, however none were severe enough to require immediate intervention. For this reason, guidelines for performance of postnatal ECHO in this population should follow general newborn screening guidelines, which significantly reduces the burden of performing emergent fetal or neonatal ECHOs in a setting where resources are not available, such as most Brazilian municipalities.\nAuthor summary\nWe performed cardiologic assessment of 120 infants born between November 2015 and January 2017 with confirmed vertical exposure to Zika virus (ZIKV). The diagnosis of ZIKV exposure was confirmed by PCR in maternal blood specimens and/or amniotic fluid during pregnancy and/or infant specimens including PCR of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and/or urine following birth. Our study found a 10.8 percent incidence of structural heart defects in infants with a history of intrauterine exposure to ZIKV, a rate considerably higher than that observed in the general population. However, no patients were found to have severe structural heart defects. The presence of major defects was increased in infants whose mothers had a history of rash in the 2nd trimester, infants with altered CNS imaging and/or preterm infants. As severe heart defects requiring immediate intervention were not identified, guidelines for performance of postnatal ECHO in this population should follow the same criteria as the ones applicable to newborns in general, particularly since resources for performance of fetal and neonatal echocardiograms are not routinely available in most Brazilian municipalities\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n[Although structural heart defects were detected in 11 percent of the infants infected by Zika virus in utero, fortunately, none of these defects was serious enough to require immediate intervention.

Congenital Zika virus infection as a silent pathology with loss of neurogenic output in the fetal brain.\n\nAbstract\nZika virus (ZIKV) is a flavivirus with teratogenic effects on fetal brain, but the spectrum of ZIKV-induced brain injury is unknown, particularly when ultrasound imaging is normal. In a pregnant pigtail macaque (_Macaca nemestrina_) model of ZIKV infection, we demonstrate that ZIKV-induced injury to fetal brain is substantial, even in the absence of microcephaly, and may be challenging to detect in a clinical setting. A common and subtle injury pattern was identified, including (i) periventricular T2-hyperintense foci and loss of fetal noncortical brain volume, (ii) injury to the ependymal epithelium with underlying gliosis and (iii) loss of late fetal neuronal progenitor cells in the subventricular zone (temporal cortex) and subgranular zone (dentate gyrus, hippocampus) with dysmorphic granule neuron patterning. Attenuation of fetal neurogenic output demonstrates potentially considerable teratogenic effects of congenital ZIKV infection even without microcephaly. Our findings suggest that all children exposed to ZIKV in utero should receive long-term monitoring for neurocognitive deficits, regardless of head size at birth.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[It will be of interest to find out if children infected in utero with Zika virus have any of the same teratogenic, long-term effects described in these cases in experimentally infected monkeys. - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[5] Fetal genetics and congenital Zika syndrome\nDate: Fri 2 Feb 2018\nSource: Nature Communications 9: 475 doi:10.1038/s41467-017-02790-9 [edited]\nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-017-02790-9#Sec12\n\n\nLuiz Carlos Caires-J\u00fanior, Ernesto Goulart, Uir\u00e1 Souto Melo, Bruno Silva Henrique Araujo, Lucas Alvizi, Alessandra Soares-Schanoski, et al. Discordant congenital Zika syndrome twins show differential in vitro viral susceptibility of neural progenitor cells.\n\nAbstract\nCongenital Zika syndrome (CZS) causes early brain development impairment by affecting neural progenitor cells (NPCs). Here, we analyze NPCs from 3 pairs of dizygotic twins discordant for CZS. We compare by RNA-Seq the NPCs derived from CZS-affected and CZS-unaffected twins. Prior to Zika virus (ZIKV) infection the NPCs from CZS babies show a significantly different gene expression signature of mTOR and Wnt pathway regulators, key to a neurodevelopmental program. Following ZIKV in vitro infection, cells from affected individuals have significantly higher ZIKV replication and reduced cell growth. Whole-exome analysis in 18 affected CZS babies as compared to 5 unaffected twins and 609 controls excludes a monogenic model to explain resistance or increased susceptibility to CZS development. Overall, our results indicate that CZS is not a stochastic event and depends on NPC intrinsic susceptibility, possibly related to oligogenic and/or epigenetic mechanisms.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Results of this study confirm the hypothesis of a genetic influence on susceptibility to the congenital Zika syndrome and microcephaly. - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[6] Mosquito vectors\nDate: Thu 15 Feb 2018\nSource: Peer J 6:e4324 https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.4324 [edited]\nhttps://peerj.com/articles/4324/\n\n\nDodson BL, Pujhari S, Rasgon JL. (2018) Vector competence of selected North American Anopheles and Culex mosquitoes for Zika virus. PeerJ 6:e4324https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.4324\n\nAbstract\nZika virus (ZIKV) is a vector-borne flavivirus that has caused recent outbreaks associated with serious disease in infants and newborns in the Americas. _Aedes_ mosquitoes are the primary vectors for ZIKV, but little is known about the diversity of mosquitoes that can transmit ZIKV in North America. We chose 3 abundant North American mosquito species (_Anopheles freeborni_, _Anopheles quadrimaculatus_, and _Culex tarsalis_) and one known vector species (_Aedes aegypti_), fed them blood meals supplemented with a recent outbreak ZIKV strain, and tested bodies, legs, and saliva for infectious ZIKV. ZIKV was able to infect, disseminate, and be transmitted by _Aedes aegypti_. However, _Anopheles freeborni_, _Anopheles quadrimaculatus_, and _Culex tarsalis_ were unable to be infected. We conclude that these species are unlikely to be involved in ZIKV transmission in North America. However, we should continue to examine the ability for other mosquito species to potentially act as ZIKV vectors in North America.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[It is reassuring to learn that these 3 species of widely-distributed mosquitoes in North America are refractory to Zika virus infection, leaving the main focus for vector control with _Aedes aegypti_, which has very limited distribution in North America. - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[7] Mosquito salivary enhancement\nDate: Mon 5 Mar 2018\nSource: Nature Immunology doi:10.1038/s41590-018-0063-9 [edited]\nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/s41590-018-0063-9\n\n\nLin Jin, Xiaomin Guo, Chuanbin Shen, Xue Hao, Peng Sun, et al. Salivary factor LTRIN from Aedes aegyptifacilitates the transmission of Zika virus by interfering with the lymphotoxin-\u03b2 receptor\n\nAbstract\nPathogens have co-evolved with mosquitoes to optimize transmission to hosts. Mosquito salivary-gland extract is known to modulate host immune responses and facilitate pathogen transmission, but the underlying molecular mechanisms of this have remained unknown. In this study, we identified and characterized a prominent 15-kilodalton protein, LTRIN, obtained from the salivary glands of the mosquito _Aedes aegypti_. LTRIN expression was upregulated in blood-fed mosquitoes, and LTRIN facilitated the transmission of Zika virus (ZIKV) and exacerbated its pathogenicity by interfering with signaling through the lymphotoxin-\u03b2 receptor (LT\u03b2R). Mechanically, LTRIN bound to LT\u03b2R and 'preferentially' inhibited signaling via the transcription factor NF-\u03baB and the production of inflammatory cytokines by interfering with the dimerization of LT\u03b2R during infection with ZIKV. Furthermore, treatment with antibody to LTRIN inhibited mosquito-mediated infection with ZIKV, and abolishing LT\u03b2R potentiated the infectivity of ZIKV both in vitro and in vivo. This study provides deeper insight into the transmission of mosquito-borne diseases in nature and supports the therapeutic potential of inhibiting the action of LTRIN to disrupt ZIKV transmission.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n******\n[8] Chimeric vaccine\nDate: Tue 27 Feb 2018\nSource: bioRxiv doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/272625 [edited]\nhttps://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/02/27/272625\n\n\nFranck Touret, Magali Gilles, Raphaelle Klitting, Fabien Aubry, Xavier de Lamballerie, Antoine Nougairede. Live Zika virus chimeric vaccine candidate based on a yellow fever 17-D attenuated backbone.\n\nAbstract\nZika virus (ZIKV) recently dispersed throughout the tropics and sub-tropics causing epidemics associated with congenital disease and neurological complications. There is currently no commercial vaccine for ZIKV. Here we describe the initial development of a chimeric virus containing the prM/E proteins of a ZIKV epidemic strain incorporated into a yellow fever 17-D attenuated backbone. Using the versatile and rapid ISA (Infectious Subgenomic Amplicons) reverse genetics method, we compared different constructs and confirmed the need to modify the cleavage site between the pre-peptide and prM protein. Using an immunocompromised mouse model, we demonstrate that mice infected with the chimeric virus produced levels of neutralizing antibodies close to those observed following infection with ZIKV and that pre-immunized mice were protected against subsequent viscerotropic and neuroinvasive virus following challenge with a heterologous strain of ZIKV. These data provide a sound basis for the future development of this ZIKV vaccine candidate.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[These results are very promising.

A recent report indicated development of t a high-density microarray comprising nonredundant 12-mer peptides that tile, with one-residue overlap, the proteomes of Zika, dengue, yellow fever, West Nile, Ilheus, Oropouche, and chikungunya viruses. Serological analysis enabled discovery of a ZIKV NS2B 20-residue peptide that had high sensitivity (96.0 percent) and specificity (95.9 percent) versus natural infection with or vaccination against dengue, chikungunya, yellow fever, West Nile, tick-borne encephalitis, or Japanese encephalitis virus in a microarray assay and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) of early-convalescent-phase sera (2 to 3 weeks after onset of symptomatic infection).

O'Neal, et al.\nPostnatal Zika virus infection is associated with persistent abnormalities in brain structure, function, and behavior in infant macaques.\n\nPostnatal perturbation by Zika virus\nMuch of the concern surrounding Zika virus infections focuses on fetuses infected in utero. Mavigner et al. reasoned that this neurotropic virus may have deleterious effects even after birth, so they set up a postnatal infection model to investigate. They found that infant rhesus macaques infected with Zika virus also had peripheral and central nervous system pathology. Longitudinal magnetic resonance imaging studies revealed that macaques that had been infected with Zika virus had structural and functional abnormalities and also altered emotional responses. These differences persisted months after the virus had been cleared. Although the work involved a small number of animals, their results suggest that infants and young children exposed to Zika virus should undergo more than just routine monitoring.\n\nAbstract\nThe Zika virus (ZIKV) epidemic is associated with fetal brain lesions and other serious birth defects classified as congenital ZIKV syndrome. Postnatal ZIKV infection in infants and children has been reported; however, data on brain anatomy, function, and behavioral outcomes following infection are absent. We show that postnatal ZIKV infection of infant rhesus macaques (RMs) results in persistent structural and functional alterations of the central nervous system compared to age-matched controls. We demonstrate ZIKV lymphoid tropism and neurotropism in infant RMs and histopathologic abnormalities in the peripheral and central nervous systems including inflammatory infiltrates, astrogliosis, and Wallerian degeneration. Structural and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI/rs-fMRI) show persistent enlargement of lateral ventricles, maturational changes in specific brain regions, and altered functional connectivity (FC) between brain areas involved in emotional behavior and arousal functions, including weakened amygdala-hippocampal connectivity in 2 of 2 ZIKV-infected infant RMs several months after clearance of ZIKV RNA from peripheral blood. ZIKV infection also results in distinct alterations in the species-typical emotional reactivity to acute stress, which were predicted by the weak amygdala-hippocampal FC. We demonstrate that postnatal ZIKV infection of infants in this model affects neurodevelopment, suggesting that long-term clinical monitoring of pediatric cases is warranted.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\nAnd\nHoward Steinberg\n<howard.steinberg@wisc.edu>\n\n[Although the numbers of infant monkeys is small, it provides enough evidence to justify evaluation of infants that have been infected with Zika virus as neonates. - Mod.TY]\n\n[The Zika virus outbreak in the Americas has diminished compared to the past 2 years (2016 and 2017), perhaps due to a smaller susceptible cohort of the human population. There are no reports yet of wide-spread reduction in the population of vector mosquitoes (_Aedes aegypti_) in the areas where Zika virus transmission has been frequent. It seems unlikely that Zika virus has disappeared from the Americas, and occurrence of sporadic outbreaks in the Americas would not be surprising. An epidemiologically important but yet unanswered question is if Zika virus has become established in non-human primates in the tropical Americas and can be transmitted by forest mosquitoes, in a sylvan maintenance cycle, as yellow fever virus has. -

Cardiac findings in infants with in utero exposure to Zika virus - a cross sectional study.\n\nAbstract\nBackground\nAntenatal exposure to Zika virus (ZIKV) is related to severe neurological manifestations. A previous study in Brazil reported an increased incidence of non-severe congenital heart defects in infants with diagnosis of congenital Zika syndrome but without laboratory confirmation of ZIKV infection in the mother or infant. The objective of this study is to report echocardiographic (ECHO) findings in infants with laboratory confirmed antenatal exposure to ZIKV.\nMethodology\nCross sectional study of cardiologic assessments of infants born between November 2015 and January 2017 with confirmed vertical exposure to ZIKV in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.\nResults\nThe study enrolled 120 children with a median age of 97 days (1 - 376 days). In utero exposure to ZIKV was confirmed in 97 children (80.8 percent) through positive maternal polymerase chain reaction (PCR) results during pregnancy or a positive PCR result at birth; 23 additional children (19.2 percent) had maternal positive PCR results during pregnancy and postnatally. Of the 120, 48 infants (40 percent) had cardiac defects noted on ECHO and 13 infants (10.8 percent) had major cardiac defects (atrial septal defect, ventricular septal defect, patent ductus arteriosus). None of the defects were severe. The frequency of major defects was higher in infants whose mothers had a rash in the 2nd trimester of pregnancy, or who had altered central nervous system (CNS) imaging postnatally or were preterm.\nConclusions\nInfants with in utero ZIKV exposure have a higher prevalence of major cardiac defects, however none were severe enough to require immediate intervention. For this reason, guidelines for performance of postnatal ECHO in this population should follow general newborn screening guidelines, which significantly reduces the burden of performing emergent fetal or neonatal ECHOs in a setting where resources are not available, such as most Brazilian municipalities.\nAuthor summary\nWe performed cardiologic assessment of 120 infants born between November 2015 and January 2017 with confirmed vertical exposure to Zika virus (ZIKV). The diagnosis of ZIKV exposure was confirmed by PCR in maternal blood specimens and/or amniotic fluid during pregnancy and/or infant specimens including PCR of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and/or urine following birth. Our study found a 10.8 percent incidence of structural heart defects in infants with a history of intrauterine exposure to ZIKV, a rate considerably higher than that observed in the general population. However, no patients were found to have severe structural heart defects. The presence of major defects was increased in infants whose mothers had a history of rash in the 2nd trimester, infants with altered CNS imaging and/or preterm infants. As severe heart defects requiring immediate intervention were not identified, guidelines for performance of postnatal ECHO in this population should follow the same criteria as the ones applicable to newborns in general, particularly since resources for performance of fetal and neonatal echocardiograms are not routinely available in most Brazilian municipalities\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n[Although structural heart defects were detected in 11 percent of the infants infected by Zika virus in utero, fortunately, none of these defects was serious enough to require immediate intervention.

Congenital Zika virus infection as a silent pathology with loss of neurogenic output in the fetal brain.\n\nAbstract\nZika virus (ZIKV) is a flavivirus with teratogenic effects on fetal brain, but the spectrum of ZIKV-induced brain injury is unknown, particularly when ultrasound imaging is normal. In a pregnant pigtail macaque (_Macaca nemestrina_) model of ZIKV infection, we demonstrate that ZIKV-induced injury to fetal brain is substantial, even in the absence of microcephaly, and may be challenging to detect in a clinical setting. A common and subtle injury pattern was identified, including (i) periventricular T2-hyperintense foci and loss of fetal noncortical brain volume, (ii) injury to the ependymal epithelium with underlying gliosis and (iii) loss of late fetal neuronal progenitor cells in the subventricular zone (temporal cortex) and subgranular zone (dentate gyrus, hippocampus) with dysmorphic granule neuron patterning. Attenuation of fetal neurogenic output demonstrates potentially considerable teratogenic effects of congenital ZIKV infection even without microcephaly. Our findings suggest that all children exposed to ZIKV in utero should receive long-term monitoring for neurocognitive deficits, regardless of head size at birth.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[It will be of interest to find out if children infected in utero with Zika virus have any of the same teratogenic, long-term effects described in these cases in experimentally infected monkeys. - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[5] Fetal genetics and congenital Zika syndrome\nDate: Fri 2 Feb 2018\nSource: Nature Communications 9: 475 doi:10.1038/s41467-017-02790-9 [edited]\nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-017-02790-9#Sec12\n\n\nLuiz Carlos Caires-J\u00fanior, Ernesto Goulart, Uir\u00e1 Souto Melo, Bruno Silva Henrique Araujo, Lucas Alvizi, Alessandra Soares-Schanoski, et al. Discordant congenital Zika syndrome twins show differential in vitro viral susceptibility of neural progenitor cells.\n\nAbstract\nCongenital Zika syndrome (CZS) causes early brain development impairment by affecting neural progenitor cells (NPCs). Here, we analyze NPCs from 3 pairs of dizygotic twins discordant for CZS. We compare by RNA-Seq the NPCs derived from CZS-affected and CZS-unaffected twins. Prior to Zika virus (ZIKV) infection the NPCs from CZS babies show a significantly different gene expression signature of mTOR and Wnt pathway regulators, key to a neurodevelopmental program. Following ZIKV in vitro infection, cells from affected individuals have significantly higher ZIKV replication and reduced cell growth. Whole-exome analysis in 18 affected CZS babies as compared to 5 unaffected twins and 609 controls excludes a monogenic model to explain resistance or increased susceptibility to CZS development. Overall, our results indicate that CZS is not a stochastic event and depends on NPC intrinsic susceptibility, possibly related to oligogenic and/or epigenetic mechanisms.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Results of this study confirm the hypothesis of a genetic influence on susceptibility to the congenital Zika syndrome and microcephaly. - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[6] Mosquito vectors\nDate: Thu 15 Feb 2018\nSource: Peer J 6:e4324 https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.4324 [edited]\nhttps://peerj.com/articles/4324/\n\n\nDodson BL, Pujhari S, Rasgon JL. (2018) Vector competence of selected North American Anopheles and Culex mosquitoes for Zika virus. PeerJ 6:e4324https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.4324\n\nAbstract\nZika virus (ZIKV) is a vector-borne flavivirus that has caused recent outbreaks associated with serious disease in infants and newborns in the Americas. _Aedes_ mosquitoes are the primary vectors for ZIKV, but little is known about the diversity of mosquitoes that can transmit ZIKV in North America. We chose 3 abundant North American mosquito species (_Anopheles freeborni_, _Anopheles quadrimaculatus_, and _Culex tarsalis_) and one known vector species (_Aedes aegypti_), fed them blood meals supplemented with a recent outbreak ZIKV strain, and tested bodies, legs, and saliva for infectious ZIKV. ZIKV was able to infect, disseminate, and be transmitted by _Aedes aegypti_. However, _Anopheles freeborni_, _Anopheles quadrimaculatus_, and _Culex tarsalis_ were unable to be infected. We conclude that these species are unlikely to be involved in ZIKV transmission in North America. However, we should continue to examine the ability for other mosquito species to potentially act as ZIKV vectors in North America.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[It is reassuring to learn that these 3 species of widely-distributed mosquitoes in North America are refractory to Zika virus infection, leaving the main focus for vector control with _Aedes aegypti_, which has very limited distribution in North America. - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[7] Mosquito salivary enhancement\nDate: Mon 5 Mar 2018\nSource: Nature Immunology doi:10.1038/s41590-018-0063-9 [edited]\nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/s41590-018-0063-9\n\n\nLin Jin, Xiaomin Guo, Chuanbin Shen, Xue Hao, Peng Sun, et al. Salivary factor LTRIN from Aedes aegyptifacilitates the transmission of Zika virus by interfering with the lymphotoxin-\u03b2 receptor\n\nAbstract\nPathogens have co-evolved with mosquitoes to optimize transmission to hosts. Mosquito salivary-gland extract is known to modulate host immune responses and facilitate pathogen transmission, but the underlying molecular mechanisms of this have remained unknown. In this study, we identified and characterized a prominent 15-kilodalton protein, LTRIN, obtained from the salivary glands of the mosquito _Aedes aegypti_. LTRIN expression was upregulated in blood-fed mosquitoes, and LTRIN facilitated the transmission of Zika virus (ZIKV) and exacerbated its pathogenicity by interfering with signaling through the lymphotoxin-\u03b2 receptor (LT\u03b2R). Mechanically, LTRIN bound to LT\u03b2R and 'preferentially' inhibited signaling via the transcription factor NF-\u03baB and the production of inflammatory cytokines by interfering with the dimerization of LT\u03b2R during infection with ZIKV. Furthermore, treatment with antibody to LTRIN inhibited mosquito-mediated infection with ZIKV, and abolishing LT\u03b2R potentiated the infectivity of ZIKV both in vitro and in vivo. This study provides deeper insight into the transmission of mosquito-borne diseases in nature and supports the therapeutic potential of inhibiting the action of LTRIN to disrupt ZIKV transmission.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n******\n[8] Chimeric vaccine\nDate: Tue 27 Feb 2018\nSource: bioRxiv doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/272625 [edited]\nhttps://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/02/27/272625\n\n\nFranck Touret, Magali Gilles, Raphaelle Klitting, Fabien Aubry, Xavier de Lamballerie, Antoine Nougairede. Live Zika virus chimeric vaccine candidate based on a yellow fever 17-D attenuated backbone.\n\nAbstract\nZika virus (ZIKV) recently dispersed throughout the tropics and sub-tropics causing epidemics associated with congenital disease and neurological complications. There is currently no commercial vaccine for ZIKV. Here we describe the initial development of a chimeric virus containing the prM/E proteins of a ZIKV epidemic strain incorporated into a yellow fever 17-D attenuated backbone. Using the versatile and rapid ISA (Infectious Subgenomic Amplicons) reverse genetics method, we compared different constructs and confirmed the need to modify the cleavage site between the pre-peptide and prM protein. Using an immunocompromised mouse model, we demonstrate that mice infected with the chimeric virus produced levels of neutralizing antibodies close to those observed following infection with ZIKV and that pre-immunized mice were protected against subsequent viscerotropic and neuroinvasive virus following challenge with a heterologous strain of ZIKV. These data provide a sound basis for the future development of this ZIKV vaccine candidate.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[These results are very promising.

O'Neal, et al.\nPostnatal Zika virus infection is associated with persistent abnormalities in brain structure, function, and behavior in infant macaques.\n\nPostnatal perturbation by Zika virus\nMuch of the concern surrounding Zika virus infections focuses on fetuses infected in utero. Mavigner et al. reasoned that this neurotropic virus may have deleterious effects even after birth, so they set up a postnatal infection model to investigate. They found that infant rhesus macaques infected with Zika virus also had peripheral and central nervous system pathology. Longitudinal magnetic resonance imaging studies revealed that macaques that had been infected with Zika virus had structural and functional abnormalities and also altered emotional responses. These differences persisted months after the virus had been cleared. Although the work involved a small number of animals, their results suggest that infants and young children exposed to Zika virus should undergo more than just routine monitoring.\n\nAbstract\nThe Zika virus (ZIKV) epidemic is associated with fetal brain lesions and other serious birth defects classified as congenital ZIKV syndrome. Postnatal ZIKV infection in infants and children has been reported; however, data on brain anatomy, function, and behavioral outcomes following infection are absent. We show that postnatal ZIKV infection of infant rhesus macaques (RMs) results in persistent structural and functional alterations of the central nervous system compared to age-matched controls. We demonstrate ZIKV lymphoid tropism and neurotropism in infant RMs and histopathologic abnormalities in the peripheral and central nervous systems including inflammatory infiltrates, astrogliosis, and Wallerian degeneration. Structural and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI/rs-fMRI) show persistent enlargement of lateral ventricles, maturational changes in specific brain regions, and altered functional connectivity (FC) between brain areas involved in emotional behavior and arousal functions, including weakened amygdala-hippocampal connectivity in 2 of 2 ZIKV-infected infant RMs several months after clearance of ZIKV RNA from peripheral blood. ZIKV infection also results in distinct alterations in the species-typical emotional reactivity to acute stress, which were predicted by the weak amygdala-hippocampal FC. We demonstrate that postnatal ZIKV infection of infants in this model affects neurodevelopment, suggesting that long-term clinical monitoring of pediatric cases is warranted.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\nAnd\nHoward Steinberg\n<howard.steinberg@wisc.edu>\n\n[Although the numbers of infant monkeys is small, it provides enough evidence to justify evaluation of infants that have been infected with Zika virus as neonates. - Mod.TY]\n\n[The Zika virus outbreak in the Americas has diminished compared to the past 2 years (2016 and 2017), perhaps due to a smaller susceptible cohort of the human population. There are no reports yet of wide-spread reduction in the population of vector mosquitoes (_Aedes aegypti_) in the areas where Zika virus transmission has been frequent. It seems unlikely that Zika virus has disappeared from the Americas, and occurrence of sporadic outbreaks in the Americas would not be surprising. An epidemiologically important but yet unanswered question is if Zika virus has become established in non-human primates in the tropical Americas and can be transmitted by forest mosquitoes, in a sylvan maintenance cycle, as yellow fever virus has. - Mod.TY]\nSee Also\nZika virus (04): Americas, research, observations 20180209.5616866\nZika virus (03): Americas, Asia, research, observations

Effect of acute Zika virus infection on sperm and virus clearance in body fluids: a prospective observational study.

[Epub ahead of print]\n\nSummary\n-------\nBackground\nEvidence of human sexual transmission during Zika virus emergence is a matter of concern, particularly in procreation, but to date, kinetics of seminal shedding and the effects of infection on human reproductive function have not been described. To investigate the effects of Zika virus infection on semen and clearance of Zika virus from semen and body fluids, we aimed to study a cohort of Zika virus-infected men.\n\nMethods\nThis prospective observational study recruited men presenting with acute Zika virus infection at Pointe-a-Pitre University Hospital in Guadeloupe, French Caribbean, where a Zika virus outbreak occurred between April and November, 2016. Blood, urine, and semen were collected at days 7, 11, 20, 30, 60, 90, and 120 after symptom onset, and semen characteristics, such as total sperm count, sperm motility, vitality, and morphology, and reproductive hormone concentrations, such as testosterone, inhibin, follicle-stimulating hormone, and luteinising hormone, were assessed. At days 7, 11, and 20, semen was processed to isolate motile spermatozoa. Zika virus RNA was detected by RT-PCR using whole blood, serum, urine, seminal plasma, semen cells, and motile spermatozoa fractions. Zika virus was isolated from different sperm fractions on Vero E6 cultures.\n\nFindings\nA total of 15 male volunteers (mean age 35 years [SD 5; range 25-44]) with acute Zika virus infection and positive Zika virus RNA detection in blood or urine were enrolled. Total sperm count was decreased from median 119 x 10^6 spermatozoa (IQR 22-234) at day 7 to 45 x 10^6 (16.5-89.6) at day 30 and 70 x 10^6 (28.5-81.4) at day 60, respectively, after Zika virus infection. Inhibin values increased from 93.5 pg/mL (IQR 55-162) at day 7 to 150 pg/mL (78-209) at day 120 when total sperm count recovered. In motile spermatozoa obtained after density gradient separation, Zika virus RNA was found in 3 of 14 patients at day 7, 4 of 15 at day 11, and 4 of 15 at day 20, and replication-competent virus was found in the tested patient. Seminal shedding kinetics seemed heterogeneous among patients. Whole blood was the fluid most frequently positive for Zika virus RNA (62 of 92 samples) and 3 patients remained positive at day 120.\n\nInterpretation\nSemen alterations early after acute Zika virus infection might affect fertility and could be explained by virus effects on the testis and epididymis. Frequency of shedding and high viral load in semen, together with the presence of replicative virus in a motile spermatozoa fraction, can lead to Zika virus transmission during sexual contact and assisted reproduction procedures. Whole blood seems to be the best specimen for Zika virus RNA detection, diagnosis, and follow-up.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nRoland H\u00fcbner\nSuperior Health Council\nBrussels\nBelgium\n<roland.hubner@sante.belgique.be>\n\n[This study addresses 2 important questions that have been raised from the previous studies that detected Zika virus RNA in semen and seminal fluids: is transmissible virus present in those RNA positive specimens and are there effects on spermatozoa that could affect fertility. In the above study, replication-competent Zika virus was found in motile spermatozoa at post-infection day 20. Additional studies will be necessary to determine if active virus occurs in those infected men beyond 20 days, and in those individuals who have detectable Zika virus RNA for up to 6 months. The above study clearly demonstrates that Zika virus infections of testis and epididymis can decrease sperm numbers and an increase of multiple sperm anomalies, especially in patients with Zika virus RNA-positive seminal specimens that could adversely affect fertility.

The risk of sustained sexual transmission of Zika is underestimated. PLoS Pathog. 2017;13(9):e1006633. doi: 10.1371/journal.ppat.1006633. [Epub ahead of print]\n\nAbstract\n--------\nPathogens often follow more than one transmission route during outbreaks--from needle sharing plus sexual transmission of HIV to small droplet aerosol plus fomite transmission of influenza. Thus, controlling an infectious disease outbreak often requires characterizing the risk associated with multiple mechanisms of transmission. For example, during the Ebola virus outbreak in West Africa, weighing the relative importance of funeral versus health care worker transmission was essential to stopping disease spread. As a result, strategic policy decisions regarding interventions must rely on accurately characterizing risks associated with multiple transmission routes. The ongoing Zika virus (ZIKV) outbreak challenges our conventional methodologies for translating case-counts into route-specific transmission risk. Critically, most approaches will fail to accurately estimate the risk of sustained sexual transmission of a pathogen that is primarily vectored by a mosquito--such as the risk of sustained sexual transmission of ZIKV. By computationally investigating a novel mathematical approach for multi-route pathogens, our results suggest that previous epidemic threshold estimates could under-estimate the risk of sustained sexual transmission by at least an order of magnitude. This result, coupled with emerging clinical, epidemiological, and experimental evidence for an increased risk of sexual transmission, would strongly support recent calls to classify ZIKV as a sexually transmitted infection.\n\nAuthor summary\n--------------\nThe national and international community is grappling with how to respond to the ongoing Zika virus outbreak. One of the most uncertain aspects of this disease is its potential for sustained sexual transmission. Recent studies have suggested that there are large differences in the age- and sex-specific Zika virus attack rates--with women of childbearing age having the highest incidence of infection--and that the risk of sustained sexual transmission may be low. Here we investigate the novel epidemiological behavior of an infection that is transmitted both sexually and by a mosquito vector. Using data-driven simulations, we demonstrate how conventional methods can substantially underestimate the risk of sustained sexual transmission for Zika outbreaks. More specifically, we find that the threshold for large-scale, sustained sexual transmission could easily be underestimated by a factor of 10 or higher using existing models. Finally, we discuss how such an underestimate will lead to ineffective responses and a drastic underestimation of the risk associated with Zika persistence and re-emergence.\n\nDiscussion\n----------\nSustained sexual transmissions of ZIKV in the MSM community would lead to sporadic sub-critical, but potentially dramatic spillover outbreaks in the heterosexual community, and would increase the probability of endemic establishment of ZIKV. Our result that sexual transmission increases the potential epidemic size and the probability of establishment supports earlier findings from Gao et al. (2016). Public health decision- and policy-makers rely on accurate characterizations of transmission risk to decide on interventions and strategically allocate limited resources. For pathogens, like ZIKV which are both vectored by an insect and transmitted sexually (with sex-based asymmetry in transmission rate), conventional approaches will underestimate the risk associated with sexual transmission. Underestimating the risk of sexual transmission, both in terms of the average transmission risk and variation in transmission risk, will lead both to biased intervention efforts and to an underestimate of the potential for disease persistence. Additionally, given the differential rates of ZIKV testing in MSM versus non-MSM communities and the known heterogeneity between their contact distributions, the data on sexual transmission are almost certainly biased. We also do not have sufficient experimental or epidemiological evidence for the per-contact probability of transmission in the MSM community. Here we advocate for the decision-making and disease modeling communities to better embrace contact network methods when characterizing transmission risk and for increased ZIKV testing in both MSM and non-MSM communities. The resulting estimates of transmission risk and the key epidemiological measures, e.g Ro and the likelihood of disease persistence, will be more accurate.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The authors point out that both heterosexual transmission and between men who have sex with men (MSM) have been documented. So far, observations of instances of sexual transmission have overwhelmingly been men to women. However, the authors state that given the high level of asymmetry between probabilities of men-to-women and women-to-men transmissions, there is a potential for sustained epidemics within the MSM community but sub-critical in the rest of the population. This statistical model and its conclusions deserve verification in the populations at risk. Because mosquito transmission of Zika virus in the population in area of risk are common, determination of MSM sustained transmission would have to be determined in areas without active mosquito transmission. - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[4] Vaccine and pregnancy\nDate: Fri 22 Sep 2017\nSource: Nature Communications [edited]\nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-017-00737-8\n\n\nShan C, Muruato AE, Jagger BW, et al. A single-dose live-attenuated vaccine prevents Zika virus pregnancy transmission and testis damage. Nat Commun. 2017;8(1):676. doi: 10.1038/s41467-017-00737-8.\n\nAbstract\n--------\nZika virus infection during pregnancy can cause congenital abnormities or fetal demise. The persistence of Zika virus in the male reproductive system poses a risk of sexual transmission. Here we demonstrate that live-attenuated Zika virus vaccine candidates containing deletions in the 3' untranslated region of the Zika virus genome (ZIKV-3'UTR-LAV) prevent viral transmission during pregnancy and testis damage in mice, as well as infection of nonhuman primates. After a single-dose vaccination, pregnant mice challenged with Zika virus at embryonic day 6 and evaluated at embryonic day 13 show markedly diminished levels of viral RNA in maternal, placental, and fetal tissues. Vaccinated male mice challenged with Zika virus were protected against testis infection, injury, and oligospermia. A single immunization of rhesus macaques elicited a rapid and robust antibody response, conferring complete protection upon challenge. Furthermore, the ZIKV-3'UTR-LAV vaccine candidates have a desirable safety profile. These results suggest that further development of ZIKV-3'UTR-LAV is warranted for humans.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n[The results of these tests in mice indicated that vaccination protects against testis infection and reduces virus RNA in maternal, placental and fetal tissues. Although immunization elicited a protective antibody response in rhesus macaques, the next step will be to vaccinate pregnant rhesus macaques and determine if protection is provided to placental tissue and fetuses. - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[5] Zika virus encephalitis in adult\nDate: Sun 24 Sep 2017\nSource: Occup Med Health Aff [edited]\nhttps://www.omicsonline.org/open-access/zika-virus-encefalitis-2329-6879-1000306.pdf\n\n\nGonzalez LZ, Vergara JC, Jauregui JS.

He reported no headache, neck stiffness or seizures. Physical examination the patient was somnolent, with reactive isochoric pupils, quadriparetic with hyporeflexia. He became stuporous with shock and leukocytosis. Treatment with meropenem and vancomycin were initiated empirically. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain revealed hyper intense lesions in the brain stem, fornix and bilateral thalamus (Figures 1A and 1B) with no midline shift. The CSF analysis results were non-specific with mild protein elevation. CSF molecular biology testing with PCR RNA for Zika virus was positive. A diagnosis of acute disseminated Zika virus encephalitis was made. Immunomodulatory therapy with IVIG was initiated. Follow-up MRI of the brain showed progression of lesions to midbrain, basal ganglia and brain cortex (Figures 1C and 1D). He had no response to 5 days of IVIG therapy and subsequently the patient died.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[This reports another case of the neuropathological consequences of Zika virus infection in an adult.

Effect of acute Zika virus infection on sperm and virus clearance in body fluids: a prospective observational study. Lancet Infect Dis. 2017. pii: S1473-3099(17)30444-9. doi: 10.1016/S1473-3099(17)30444-9. [Epub ahead of print]\n\nSummary\n-------\nBackground\nEvidence of human sexual transmission during Zika virus emergence is a matter of concern, particularly in procreation, but to date, kinetics of seminal shedding and the effects of infection on human reproductive function have not been described. To investigate the effects of Zika virus infection on semen and clearance of Zika virus from semen and body fluids, we aimed to study a cohort of Zika virus-infected men.\n\nMethods\nThis prospective observational study recruited men presenting with acute Zika virus infection at Pointe-a-Pitre University Hospital in Guadeloupe, French Caribbean, where a Zika virus outbreak occurred between April and November, 2016. Blood, urine, and semen were collected at days 7, 11, 20, 30, 60, 90, and 120 after symptom onset, and semen characteristics, such as total sperm count, sperm motility, vitality, and morphology, and reproductive hormone concentrations, such as testosterone, inhibin, follicle-stimulating hormone, and luteinising hormone, were assessed. At days 7, 11, and 20, semen was processed to isolate motile spermatozoa. Zika virus RNA was detected by RT-PCR using whole blood, serum, urine, seminal plasma, semen cells, and motile spermatozoa fractions. Zika virus was isolated from different sperm fractions on Vero E6 cultures.\n\nFindings\nA total of 15 male volunteers (mean age 35 years [SD 5; range 25-44]) with acute Zika virus infection and positive Zika virus RNA detection in blood or urine were enrolled. Total sperm count was decreased from median 119 x 10^6 spermatozoa (IQR 22-234) at day 7 to 45 x 10^6 (16.5-89.6) at day 30 and 70 x 10^6 (28.5-81.4) at day 60, respectively, after Zika virus infection. Inhibin values increased from 93.5 pg/mL (IQR 55-162) at day 7 to 150 pg/mL (78-209) at day 120 when total sperm count recovered. In motile spermatozoa obtained after density gradient separation, Zika virus RNA was found in 3 of 14 patients at day 7, 4 of 15 at day 11, and 4 of 15 at day 20, and replication-competent virus was found in the tested patient. Seminal shedding kinetics seemed heterogeneous among patients. Whole blood was the fluid most frequently positive for Zika virus RNA (62 of 92 samples) and 3 patients remained positive at day 120.\n\nInterpretation\nSemen alterations early after acute Zika virus infection might affect fertility and could be explained by virus effects on the testis and epididymis. Frequency of shedding and high viral load in semen, together with the presence of replicative virus in a motile spermatozoa fraction, can lead to Zika virus transmission during sexual contact and assisted reproduction procedures. Whole blood seems to be the best specimen for Zika virus RNA detection, diagnosis, and follow-up.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nRoland H\u00fcbner\nSuperior Health Council\nBrussels\nBelgium\n<roland.hubner@sante.belgique.be>\n\n[This study addresses 2 important questions that have been raised from the previous studies that detected Zika virus RNA in semen and seminal fluids: is transmissible virus present in those RNA positive specimens and are there effects on spermatozoa that could affect fertility. In the above study, replication-competent Zika virus was found in motile spermatozoa at post-infection day 20. Additional studies will be necessary to determine if active virus occurs in those infected men beyond 20 days, and in those individuals who have detectable Zika virus RNA for up to 6 months. The above study clearly demonstrates that Zika virus infections of testis and epididymis can decrease sperm numbers and an increase of multiple sperm anomalies, especially in patients with Zika virus RNA-positive seminal specimens that could adversely affect fertility.

The risk of sustained sexual transmission of Zika is underestimated. PLoS Pathog. 2017;13(9):e1006633. doi: 10.1371/journal.ppat.1006633. [Epub ahead of print]\n\nAbstract\n--------\nPathogens often follow more than one transmission route during outbreaks--from needle sharing plus sexual transmission of HIV to small droplet aerosol plus fomite transmission of influenza. Thus, controlling an infectious disease outbreak often requires characterizing the risk associated with multiple mechanisms of transmission. For example, during the Ebola virus outbreak in West Africa, weighing the relative importance of funeral versus health care worker transmission was essential to stopping disease spread. As a result, strategic policy decisions regarding interventions must rely on accurately characterizing risks associated with multiple transmission routes. The ongoing Zika virus (ZIKV) outbreak challenges our conventional methodologies for translating case-counts into route-specific transmission risk. Critically, most approaches will fail to accurately estimate the risk of sustained sexual transmission of a pathogen that is primarily vectored by a mosquito--such as the risk of sustained sexual transmission of ZIKV. By computationally investigating a novel mathematical approach for multi-route pathogens, our results suggest that previous epidemic threshold estimates could under-estimate the risk of sustained sexual transmission by at least an order of magnitude. This result, coupled with emerging clinical, epidemiological, and experimental evidence for an increased risk of sexual transmission, would strongly support recent calls to classify ZIKV as a sexually transmitted infection.\n\nAuthor summary\n--------------\nThe national and international community is grappling with how to respond to the ongoing Zika virus outbreak. One of the most uncertain aspects of this disease is its potential for sustained sexual transmission. Recent studies have suggested that there are large differences in the age- and sex-specific Zika virus attack rates--with women of childbearing age having the highest incidence of infection--and that the risk of sustained sexual transmission may be low. Here we investigate the novel epidemiological behavior of an infection that is transmitted both sexually and by a mosquito vector. Using data-driven simulations, we demonstrate how conventional methods can substantially underestimate the risk of sustained sexual transmission for Zika outbreaks. More specifically, we find that the threshold for large-scale, sustained sexual transmission could easily be underestimated by a factor of 10 or higher using existing models. Finally, we discuss how such an underestimate will lead to ineffective responses and a drastic underestimation of the risk associated with Zika persistence and re-emergence.\n\nDiscussion\n----------\nSustained sexual transmissions of ZIKV in the MSM community would lead to sporadic sub-critical, but potentially dramatic spillover outbreaks in the heterosexual community, and would increase the probability of endemic establishment of ZIKV. Our result that sexual transmission increases the potential epidemic size and the probability of establishment supports earlier findings from Gao et al. (2016). Public health decision- and policy-makers rely on accurate characterizations of transmission risk to decide on interventions and strategically allocate limited resources. For pathogens, like ZIKV which are both vectored by an insect and transmitted sexually (with sex-based asymmetry in transmission rate), conventional approaches will underestimate the risk associated with sexual transmission. Underestimating the risk of sexual transmission, both in terms of the average transmission risk and variation in transmission risk, will lead both to biased intervention efforts and to an underestimate of the potential for disease persistence. Additionally, given the differential rates of ZIKV testing in MSM versus non-MSM communities and the known heterogeneity between their contact distributions, the data on sexual transmission are almost certainly biased. We also do not have sufficient experimental or epidemiological evidence for the per-contact probability of transmission in the MSM community. Here we advocate for the decision-making and disease modeling communities to better embrace contact network methods when characterizing transmission risk and for increased ZIKV testing in both MSM and non-MSM communities. The resulting estimates of transmission risk and the key epidemiological measures, e.g Ro and the likelihood of disease persistence, will be more accurate.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The authors point out that both heterosexual transmission and between men who have sex with men (MSM) have been documented. So far, observations of instances of sexual transmission have overwhelmingly been men to women. However, the authors state that given the high level of asymmetry between probabilities of men-to-women and women-to-men transmissions, there is a potential for sustained epidemics within the MSM community but sub-critical in the rest of the population. This statistical model and its conclusions deserve verification in the populations at risk. Because mosquito transmission of Zika virus in the population in area of risk are common, determination of MSM sustained transmission would have to be determined in areas without active mosquito transmission. - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[4] Vaccine and pregnancy\nDate: Fri 22 Sep 2017\nSource: Nature Communications [edited]\nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-017-00737-8\n\n\nShan C, Muruato AE, Jagger BW, et al. A single-dose live-attenuated vaccine prevents Zika virus pregnancy transmission and testis damage. Nat Commun. 2017;8(1):676. doi: 10.1038/s41467-017-00737-8.\n\nAbstract\n--------\nZika virus infection during pregnancy can cause congenital abnormities or fetal demise. The persistence of Zika virus in the male reproductive system poses a risk of sexual transmission. Here we demonstrate that live-attenuated Zika virus vaccine candidates containing deletions in the 3' untranslated region of the Zika virus genome (ZIKV-3'UTR-LAV) prevent viral transmission during pregnancy and testis damage in mice, as well as infection of nonhuman primates. After a single-dose vaccination, pregnant mice challenged with Zika virus at embryonic day 6 and evaluated at embryonic day 13 show markedly diminished levels of viral RNA in maternal, placental, and fetal tissues. Vaccinated male mice challenged with Zika virus were protected against testis infection, injury, and oligospermia. A single immunization of rhesus macaques elicited a rapid and robust antibody response, conferring complete protection upon challenge. Furthermore, the ZIKV-3'UTR-LAV vaccine candidates have a desirable safety profile. These results suggest that further development of ZIKV-3'UTR-LAV is warranted for humans.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n[The results of these tests in mice indicated that vaccination protects against testis infection and reduces virus RNA in maternal, placental and fetal tissues. Although immunization elicited a protective antibody response in rhesus macaques, the next step will be to vaccinate pregnant rhesus macaques and determine if protection is provided to placental tissue and fetuses. - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[5] Zika virus encephalitis in adult\nDate: Sun 24 Sep 2017\nSource: Occup Med Health Aff [edited]\nhttps://www.omicsonline.org/open-access/zika-virus-encefalitis-2329-6879-1000306.pdf\n\n\nGonzalez LZ, Vergara JC, Jauregui JS.

He reported no headache, neck stiffness or seizures. Physical examination the patient was somnolent, with reactive isochoric pupils, quadriparetic with hyporeflexia. He became stuporous with shock and leukocytosis. Treatment with meropenem and vancomycin were initiated empirically. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain revealed hyper intense lesions in the brain stem, fornix and bilateral thalamus (Figures 1A and 1B) with no midline shift. The CSF analysis results were non-specific with mild protein elevation. CSF molecular biology testing with PCR RNA for Zika virus was positive. A diagnosis of acute disseminated Zika virus encephalitis was made. Immunomodulatory therapy with IVIG was initiated. Follow-up MRI of the brain showed progression of lesions to midbrain, basal ganglia and brain cortex (Figures 1C and 1D). He had no response to 5 days of IVIG therapy and subsequently the patient died.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[This reports another case of the neuropathological consequences of Zika virus infection in an adult.

Effect of acute Zika virus infection on sperm and virus clearance in body fluids: a prospective observational study. Lancet Infect Dis. 2017. pii: S1473-3099(17)30444-9. doi: 10.1016/S1473-3099(17)30444-9. [Epub ahead of print]\n\nSummary\n-------\nBackground\nEvidence of human sexual transmission during Zika virus emergence is a matter of concern, particularly in procreation, but to date, kinetics of seminal shedding and the effects of infection on human reproductive function have not been described. To investigate the effects of Zika virus infection on semen and clearance of Zika virus from semen and body fluids, we aimed to study a cohort of Zika virus-infected men.\n\nMethods\nThis prospective observational study recruited men presenting with acute Zika virus infection at Pointe-a-Pitre University Hospital in Guadeloupe, French Caribbean, where a Zika virus outbreak occurred between April and November, 2016. Blood, urine, and semen were collected at days 7, 11, 20, 30, 60, 90, and 120 after symptom onset, and semen characteristics, such as total sperm count, sperm motility, vitality, and morphology, and reproductive hormone concentrations, such as testosterone, inhibin, follicle-stimulating hormone, and luteinising hormone, were assessed. At days 7, 11, and 20, semen was processed to isolate motile spermatozoa. Zika virus RNA was detected by RT-PCR using whole blood, serum, urine, seminal plasma, semen cells, and motile spermatozoa fractions. Zika virus was isolated from different sperm fractions on Vero E6 cultures.\n\nFindings\nA total of 15 male volunteers (mean age 35 years [SD 5; range 25-44]) with acute Zika virus infection and positive Zika virus RNA detection in blood or urine were enrolled. Total sperm count was decreased from median 119 x 10^6 spermatozoa (IQR 22-234) at day 7 to 45 x 10^6 (16.5-89.6) at day 30 and 70 x 10^6 (28.5-81.4) at day 60, respectively, after Zika virus infection. Inhibin values increased from 93.5 pg/mL (IQR 55-162) at day 7 to 150 pg/mL (78-209) at day 120 when total sperm count recovered. In motile spermatozoa obtained after density gradient separation, Zika virus RNA was found in 3 of 14 patients at day 7, 4 of 15 at day 11, and 4 of 15 at day 20, and replication-competent virus was found in the tested patient. Seminal shedding kinetics seemed heterogeneous among patients. Whole blood was the fluid most frequently positive for Zika virus RNA (62 of 92 samples) and 3 patients remained positive at day 120.\n\nInterpretation\nSemen alterations early after acute Zika virus infection might affect fertility and could be explained by virus effects on the testis and epididymis. Frequency of shedding and high viral load in semen, together with the presence of replicative virus in a motile spermatozoa fraction, can lead to Zika virus transmission during sexual contact and assisted reproduction procedures. Whole blood seems to be the best specimen for Zika virus RNA detection, diagnosis, and follow-up.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nRoland H\u00fcbner\nSuperior Health Council\nBrussels\nBelgium\n<roland.hubner@sante.belgique.be>\n\n[This study addresses 2 important questions that have been raised from the previous studies that detected Zika virus RNA in semen and seminal fluids: is transmissible virus present in those RNA positive specimens and are there effects on spermatozoa that could affect fertility. In the above study, replication-competent Zika virus was found in motile spermatozoa at post-infection day 20. Additional studies will be necessary to determine if active virus occurs in those infected men beyond 20 days, and in those individuals who have detectable Zika virus RNA for up to 6 months. The above study clearly demonstrates that Zika virus infections of testis and epididymis can decrease sperm numbers and an increase of multiple sperm anomalies, especially in patients with Zika virus RNA-positive seminal specimens that could adversely affect fertility.

The risk of sustained sexual transmission of Zika is underestimated. PLoS Pathog. 2017;13(9):e1006633. doi: 10.1371/journal.ppat.1006633. [Epub ahead of print]\n\nAbstract\n--------\nPathogens often follow more than one transmission route during outbreaks--from needle sharing plus sexual transmission of HIV to small droplet aerosol plus fomite transmission of influenza. Thus, controlling an infectious disease outbreak often requires characterizing the risk associated with multiple mechanisms of transmission. For example, during the Ebola virus outbreak in West Africa, weighing the relative importance of funeral versus health care worker transmission was essential to stopping disease spread. As a result, strategic policy decisions regarding interventions must rely on accurately characterizing risks associated with multiple transmission routes. The ongoing Zika virus (ZIKV) outbreak challenges our conventional methodologies for translating case-counts into route-specific transmission risk. Critically, most approaches will fail to accurately estimate the risk of sustained sexual transmission of a pathogen that is primarily vectored by a mosquito--such as the risk of sustained sexual transmission of ZIKV. By computationally investigating a novel mathematical approach for multi-route pathogens, our results suggest that previous epidemic threshold estimates could under-estimate the risk of sustained sexual transmission by at least an order of magnitude. This result, coupled with emerging clinical, epidemiological, and experimental evidence for an increased risk of sexual transmission, would strongly support recent calls to classify ZIKV as a sexually transmitted infection.\n\nAuthor summary\n--------------\nThe national and international community is grappling with how to respond to the ongoing Zika virus outbreak. One of the most uncertain aspects of this disease is its potential for sustained sexual transmission. Recent studies have suggested that there are large differences in the age- and sex-specific Zika virus attack rates--with women of childbearing age having the highest incidence of infection--and that the risk of sustained sexual transmission may be low. Here we investigate the novel epidemiological behavior of an infection that is transmitted both sexually and by a mosquito vector. Using data-driven simulations, we demonstrate how conventional methods can substantially underestimate the risk of sustained sexual transmission for Zika outbreaks. More specifically, we find that the threshold for large-scale, sustained sexual transmission could easily be underestimated by a factor of 10 or higher using existing models. Finally, we discuss how such an underestimate will lead to ineffective responses and a drastic underestimation of the risk associated with Zika persistence and re-emergence.\n\nDiscussion\n----------\nSustained sexual transmissions of ZIKV in the MSM community would lead to sporadic sub-critical, but potentially dramatic spillover outbreaks in the heterosexual community, and would increase the probability of endemic establishment of ZIKV. Our result that sexual transmission increases the potential epidemic size and the probability of establishment supports earlier findings from Gao et al. (2016). Public health decision- and policy-makers rely on accurate characterizations of transmission risk to decide on interventions and strategically allocate limited resources. For pathogens, like ZIKV which are both vectored by an insect and transmitted sexually (with sex-based asymmetry in transmission rate), conventional approaches will underestimate the risk associated with sexual transmission. Underestimating the risk of sexual transmission, both in terms of the average transmission risk and variation in transmission risk, will lead both to biased intervention efforts and to an underestimate of the potential for disease persistence. Additionally, given the differential rates of ZIKV testing in MSM versus non-MSM communities and the known heterogeneity between their contact distributions, the data on sexual transmission are almost certainly biased. We also do not have sufficient experimental or epidemiological evidence for the per-contact probability of transmission in the MSM community. Here we advocate for the decision-making and disease modeling communities to better embrace contact network methods when characterizing transmission risk and for increased ZIKV testing in both MSM and non-MSM communities. The resulting estimates of transmission risk and the key epidemiological measures, e.g Ro and the likelihood of disease persistence, will be more accurate.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The authors point out that both heterosexual transmission and between men who have sex with men (MSM) have been documented. So far, observations of instances of sexual transmission have overwhelmingly been men to women. However, the authors state that given the high level of asymmetry between probabilities of men-to-women and women-to-men transmissions, there is a potential for sustained epidemics within the MSM community but sub-critical in the rest of the population. This statistical model and its conclusions deserve verification in the populations at risk. Because mosquito transmission of Zika virus in the population in area of risk are common, determination of MSM sustained transmission would have to be determined in areas without active mosquito transmission. - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[4] Vaccine and pregnancy\nDate: Fri 22 Sep 2017\nSource: Nature Communications [edited]\nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-017-00737-8\n\n\nShan C, Muruato AE, Jagger BW, et al. A single-dose live-attenuated vaccine prevents Zika virus pregnancy transmission and testis damage. Nat Commun. 2017;8(1):676. doi: 10.1038/s41467-017-00737-8.\n\nAbstract\n--------\nZika virus infection during pregnancy can cause congenital abnormities or fetal demise. The persistence of Zika virus in the male reproductive system poses a risk of sexual transmission. Here we demonstrate that live-attenuated Zika virus vaccine candidates containing deletions in the 3' untranslated region of the Zika virus genome (ZIKV-3'UTR-LAV) prevent viral transmission during pregnancy and testis damage in mice, as well as infection of nonhuman primates. After a single-dose vaccination, pregnant mice challenged with Zika virus at embryonic day 6 and evaluated at embryonic day 13 show markedly diminished levels of viral RNA in maternal, placental, and fetal tissues. Vaccinated male mice challenged with Zika virus were protected against testis infection, injury, and oligospermia. A single immunization of rhesus macaques elicited a rapid and robust antibody response, conferring complete protection upon challenge. Furthermore, the ZIKV-3'UTR-LAV vaccine candidates have a desirable safety profile. These results suggest that further development of ZIKV-3'UTR-LAV is warranted for humans.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n[The results of these tests in mice indicated that vaccination protects against testis infection and reduces virus RNA in maternal, placental and fetal tissues. Although immunization elicited a protective antibody response in rhesus macaques, the next step will be to vaccinate pregnant rhesus macaques and determine if protection is provided to placental tissue and fetuses. - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[5] Zika virus encephalitis in adult\nDate: Sun 24 Sep 2017\nSource: Occup Med Health Aff [edited]\nhttps://www.omicsonline.org/open-access/zika-virus-encefalitis-2329-6879-1000306.pdf\n\n\nGonzalez LZ, Vergara JC, Jauregui JS.

He reported no headache, neck stiffness or seizures. Physical examination the patient was somnolent, with reactive isochoric pupils, quadriparetic with hyporeflexia. He became stuporous with shock and leukocytosis. Treatment with meropenem and vancomycin were initiated empirically. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain revealed hyper intense lesions in the brain stem, fornix and bilateral thalamus (Figures 1A and 1B) with no midline shift. The CSF analysis results were non-specific with mild protein elevation. CSF molecular biology testing with PCR RNA for Zika virus was positive. A diagnosis of acute disseminated Zika virus encephalitis was made. Immunomodulatory therapy with IVIG was initiated. Follow-up MRI of the brain showed progression of lesions to midbrain, basal ganglia and brain cortex (Figures 1C and 1D). He had no response to 5 days of IVIG therapy and subsequently the patient died.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[This reports another case of the neuropathological consequences of Zika virus infection in an adult.

Effect of acute Zika virus infection on sperm and virus clearance in body fluids: a prospective observational study. Lancet Infect Dis. 2017. pii: S1473-3099(17)30444-9. doi: 10.1016/S1473-3099(17)30444-9. [Epub ahead of print]\n\nSummary\n-------\nBackground\nEvidence of human sexual transmission during Zika virus emergence is a matter of concern, particularly in procreation, but to date, kinetics of seminal shedding and the effects of infection on human reproductive function have not been described. To investigate the effects of Zika virus infection on semen and clearance of Zika virus from semen and body fluids, we aimed to study a cohort of Zika virus-infected men.\n\nMethods\nThis prospective observational study recruited men presenting with acute Zika virus infection at Pointe-a-Pitre University Hospital in Guadeloupe, French Caribbean, where a Zika virus outbreak occurred between April and November, 2016. Blood, urine, and semen were collected at days 7, 11, 20, 30, 60, 90, and 120 after symptom onset, and semen characteristics, such as total sperm count, sperm motility, vitality, and morphology, and reproductive hormone concentrations, such as testosterone, inhibin, follicle-stimulating hormone, and luteinising hormone, were assessed. At days 7, 11, and 20, semen was processed to isolate motile spermatozoa. Zika virus RNA was detected by RT-PCR using whole blood, serum, urine, seminal plasma, semen cells, and motile spermatozoa fractions. Zika virus was isolated from different sperm fractions on Vero E6 cultures.\n\nFindings\nA total of 15 male volunteers (mean age 35 years [SD 5; range 25-44]) with acute Zika virus infection and positive Zika virus RNA detection in blood or urine were enrolled. Total sperm count was decreased from median 119 x 10^6 spermatozoa (IQR 22-234) at day 7 to 45 x 10^6 (16.5-89.6) at day 30 and 70 x 10^6 (28.5-81.4) at day 60, respectively, after Zika virus infection. Inhibin values increased from 93.5 pg/mL (IQR 55-162) at day 7 to 150 pg/mL (78-209) at day 120 when total sperm count recovered. In motile spermatozoa obtained after density gradient separation, Zika virus RNA was found in 3 of 14 patients at day 7, 4 of 15 at day 11, and 4 of 15 at day 20, and replication-competent virus was found in the tested patient. Seminal shedding kinetics seemed heterogeneous among patients. Whole blood was the fluid most frequently positive for Zika virus RNA (62 of 92 samples) and 3 patients remained positive at day 120.\n\nInterpretation\nSemen alterations early after acute Zika virus infection might affect fertility and could be explained by virus effects on the testis and epididymis. Frequency of shedding and high viral load in semen, together with the presence of replicative virus in a motile spermatozoa fraction, can lead to Zika virus transmission during sexual contact and assisted reproduction procedures. Whole blood seems to be the best specimen for Zika virus RNA detection, diagnosis, and follow-up.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nRoland H\u00fcbner\nSuperior Health Council\nBrussels\nBelgium\n<roland.hubner@sante.belgique.be>\n\n[This study addresses 2 important questions that have been raised from the previous studies that detected Zika virus RNA in semen and seminal fluids: is transmissible virus present in those RNA positive specimens and are there effects on spermatozoa that could affect fertility. In the above study, replication-competent Zika virus was found in motile spermatozoa at post-infection day 20. Additional studies will be necessary to determine if active virus occurs in those infected men beyond 20 days, and in those individuals who have detectable Zika virus RNA for up to 6 months. The above study clearly demonstrates that Zika virus infections of testis and epididymis can decrease sperm numbers and an increase of multiple sperm anomalies, especially in patients with Zika virus RNA-positive seminal specimens that could adversely affect fertility.

The risk of sustained sexual transmission of Zika is underestimated. PLoS Pathog. 2017;13(9):e1006633. doi: 10.1371/journal.ppat.1006633. [Epub ahead of print]\n\nAbstract\n--------\nPathogens often follow more than one transmission route during outbreaks--from needle sharing plus sexual transmission of HIV to small droplet aerosol plus fomite transmission of influenza. Thus, controlling an infectious disease outbreak often requires characterizing the risk associated with multiple mechanisms of transmission. For example, during the Ebola virus outbreak in West Africa, weighing the relative importance of funeral versus health care worker transmission was essential to stopping disease spread. As a result, strategic policy decisions regarding interventions must rely on accurately characterizing risks associated with multiple transmission routes. The ongoing Zika virus (ZIKV) outbreak challenges our conventional methodologies for translating case-counts into route-specific transmission risk. Critically, most approaches will fail to accurately estimate the risk of sustained sexual transmission of a pathogen that is primarily vectored by a mosquito--such as the risk of sustained sexual transmission of ZIKV. By computationally investigating a novel mathematical approach for multi-route pathogens, our results suggest that previous epidemic threshold estimates could under-estimate the risk of sustained sexual transmission by at least an order of magnitude. This result, coupled with emerging clinical, epidemiological, and experimental evidence for an increased risk of sexual transmission, would strongly support recent calls to classify ZIKV as a sexually transmitted infection.\n\nAuthor summary\n--------------\nThe national and international community is grappling with how to respond to the ongoing Zika virus outbreak. One of the most uncertain aspects of this disease is its potential for sustained sexual transmission. Recent studies have suggested that there are large differences in the age- and sex-specific Zika virus attack rates--with women of childbearing age having the highest incidence of infection--and that the risk of sustained sexual transmission may be low. Here we investigate the novel epidemiological behavior of an infection that is transmitted both sexually and by a mosquito vector. Using data-driven simulations, we demonstrate how conventional methods can substantially underestimate the risk of sustained sexual transmission for Zika outbreaks. More specifically, we find that the threshold for large-scale, sustained sexual transmission could easily be underestimated by a factor of 10 or higher using existing models. Finally, we discuss how such an underestimate will lead to ineffective responses and a drastic underestimation of the risk associated with Zika persistence and re-emergence.\n\nDiscussion\n----------\nSustained sexual transmissions of ZIKV in the MSM community would lead to sporadic sub-critical, but potentially dramatic spillover outbreaks in the heterosexual community, and would increase the probability of endemic establishment of ZIKV. Our result that sexual transmission increases the potential epidemic size and the probability of establishment supports earlier findings from Gao et al. (2016). Public health decision- and policy-makers rely on accurate characterizations of transmission risk to decide on interventions and strategically allocate limited resources. For pathogens, like ZIKV which are both vectored by an insect and transmitted sexually (with sex-based asymmetry in transmission rate), conventional approaches will underestimate the risk associated with sexual transmission. Underestimating the risk of sexual transmission, both in terms of the average transmission risk and variation in transmission risk, will lead both to biased intervention efforts and to an underestimate of the potential for disease persistence. Additionally, given the differential rates of ZIKV testing in MSM versus non-MSM communities and the known heterogeneity between their contact distributions, the data on sexual transmission are almost certainly biased. We also do not have sufficient experimental or epidemiological evidence for the per-contact probability of transmission in the MSM community. Here we advocate for the decision-making and disease modeling communities to better embrace contact network methods when characterizing transmission risk and for increased ZIKV testing in both MSM and non-MSM communities. The resulting estimates of transmission risk and the key epidemiological measures, e.g Ro and the likelihood of disease persistence, will be more accurate.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The authors point out that both heterosexual transmission and between men who have sex with men (MSM) have been documented. So far, observations of instances of sexual transmission have overwhelmingly been men to women. However, the authors state that given the high level of asymmetry between probabilities of men-to-women and women-to-men transmissions, there is a potential for sustained epidemics within the MSM community but sub-critical in the rest of the population. This statistical model and its conclusions deserve verification in the populations at risk. Because mosquito transmission of Zika virus in the population in area of risk are common, determination of MSM sustained transmission would have to be determined in areas without active mosquito transmission. - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[4] Vaccine and pregnancy\nDate: Fri 22 Sep 2017\nSource: Nature Communications [edited]\nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-017-00737-8\n\n\nShan C, Muruato AE, Jagger BW, et al. A single-dose live-attenuated vaccine prevents Zika virus pregnancy transmission and testis damage. Nat Commun. 2017;8(1):676. doi: 10.1038/s41467-017-00737-8.\n\nAbstract\n--------\nZika virus infection during pregnancy can cause congenital abnormities or fetal demise. The persistence of Zika virus in the male reproductive system poses a risk of sexual transmission. Here we demonstrate that live-attenuated Zika virus vaccine candidates containing deletions in the 3' untranslated region of the Zika virus genome (ZIKV-3'UTR-LAV) prevent viral transmission during pregnancy and testis damage in mice, as well as infection of nonhuman primates. After a single-dose vaccination, pregnant mice challenged with Zika virus at embryonic day 6 and evaluated at embryonic day 13 show markedly diminished levels of viral RNA in maternal, placental, and fetal tissues. Vaccinated male mice challenged with Zika virus were protected against testis infection, injury, and oligospermia. A single immunization of rhesus macaques elicited a rapid and robust antibody response, conferring complete protection upon challenge. Furthermore, the ZIKV-3'UTR-LAV vaccine candidates have a desirable safety profile. These results suggest that further development of ZIKV-3'UTR-LAV is warranted for humans.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n[The results of these tests in mice indicated that vaccination protects against testis infection and reduces virus RNA in maternal, placental and fetal tissues. Although immunization elicited a protective antibody response in rhesus macaques, the next step will be to vaccinate pregnant rhesus macaques and determine if protection is provided to placental tissue and fetuses. - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[5] Zika virus encephalitis in adult\nDate: Sun 24 Sep 2017\nSource: Occup Med Health Aff [edited]\nhttps://www.omicsonline.org/open-access/zika-virus-encefalitis-2329-6879-1000306.pdf\n\n\nGonzalez LZ, Vergara JC, Jauregui JS.

He reported no headache, neck stiffness or seizures. Physical examination the patient was somnolent, with reactive isochoric pupils, quadriparetic with hyporeflexia. He became stuporous with shock and leukocytosis. Treatment with meropenem and vancomycin were initiated empirically. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain revealed hyper intense lesions in the brain stem, fornix and bilateral thalamus (Figures 1A and 1B) with no midline shift. The CSF analysis results were non-specific with mild protein elevation. CSF molecular biology testing with PCR RNA for Zika virus was positive. A diagnosis of acute disseminated Zika virus encephalitis was made. Immunomodulatory therapy with IVIG was initiated. Follow-up MRI of the brain showed progression of lesions to midbrain, basal ganglia and brain cortex (Figures 1C and 1D). He had no response to 5 days of IVIG therapy and subsequently the patient died.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[This reports another case of the neuropathological consequences of Zika virus infection in an adult.

Effect of acute Zika virus infection on sperm and virus clearance in body fluids: a prospective observational study. Lancet Infect Dis. 2017. pii: S1473-3099(17)30444-9. doi: 10.1016/S1473-3099(17)30444-9. [Epub ahead of print]\n\nSummary\n-------\nBackground\nEvidence of human sexual transmission during Zika virus emergence is a matter of concern, particularly in procreation, but to date, kinetics of seminal shedding and the effects of infection on human reproductive function have not been described. To investigate the effects of Zika virus infection on semen and clearance of Zika virus from semen and body fluids, we aimed to study a cohort of Zika virus-infected men.\n\nMethods\nThis prospective observational study recruited men presenting with acute Zika virus infection at Pointe-a-Pitre University Hospital in Guadeloupe, French Caribbean, where a Zika virus outbreak occurred between April and November, 2016. Blood, urine, and semen were collected at days 7, 11, 20, 30, 60, 90, and 120 after symptom onset, and semen characteristics, such as total sperm count, sperm motility, vitality, and morphology, and reproductive hormone concentrations, such as testosterone, inhibin, follicle-stimulating hormone, and luteinising hormone, were assessed. At days 7, 11, and 20, semen was processed to isolate motile spermatozoa. Zika virus RNA was detected by RT-PCR using whole blood, serum, urine, seminal plasma, semen cells, and motile spermatozoa fractions. Zika virus was isolated from different sperm fractions on Vero E6 cultures.\n\nFindings\nA total of 15 male volunteers (mean age 35 years [SD 5; range 25-44]) with acute Zika virus infection and positive Zika virus RNA detection in blood or urine were enrolled. Total sperm count was decreased from median 119 x 10^6 spermatozoa (IQR 22-234) at day 7 to 45 x 10^6 (16.5-89.6) at day 30 and 70 x 10^6 (28.5-81.4) at day 60, respectively, after Zika virus infection. Inhibin values increased from 93.5 pg/mL (IQR 55-162) at day 7 to 150 pg/mL (78-209) at day 120 when total sperm count recovered. In motile spermatozoa obtained after density gradient separation, Zika virus RNA was found in 3 of 14 patients at day 7, 4 of 15 at day 11, and 4 of 15 at day 20, and replication-competent virus was found in the tested patient. Seminal shedding kinetics seemed heterogeneous among patients. Whole blood was the fluid most frequently positive for Zika virus RNA (62 of 92 samples) and 3 patients remained positive at day 120.\n\nInterpretation\nSemen alterations early after acute Zika virus infection might affect fertility and could be explained by virus effects on the testis and epididymis. Frequency of shedding and high viral load in semen, together with the presence of replicative virus in a motile spermatozoa fraction, can lead to Zika virus transmission during sexual contact and assisted reproduction procedures. Whole blood seems to be the best specimen for Zika virus RNA detection, diagnosis, and follow-up.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nRoland H\u00fcbner\nSuperior Health Council\nBrussels\nBelgium\n<roland.hubner@sante.belgique.be>\n\n[This study addresses 2 important questions that have been raised from the previous studies that detected Zika virus RNA in semen and seminal fluids: is transmissible virus present in those RNA positive specimens and are there effects on spermatozoa that could affect fertility. In the above study, replication-competent Zika virus was found in motile spermatozoa at post-infection day 20. Additional studies will be necessary to determine if active virus occurs in those infected men beyond 20 days, and in those individuals who have detectable Zika virus RNA for up to 6 months. The above study clearly demonstrates that Zika virus infections of testis and epididymis can decrease sperm numbers and an increase of multiple sperm anomalies, especially in patients with Zika virus RNA-positive seminal specimens that could adversely affect fertility.

The risk of sustained sexual transmission of Zika is underestimated. PLoS Pathog. 2017;13(9):e1006633. doi: 10.1371/journal.ppat.1006633. [Epub ahead of print]\n\nAbstract\n--------\nPathogens often follow more than one transmission route during outbreaks--from needle sharing plus sexual transmission of HIV to small droplet aerosol plus fomite transmission of influenza. Thus, controlling an infectious disease outbreak often requires characterizing the risk associated with multiple mechanisms of transmission. For example, during the Ebola virus outbreak in West Africa, weighing the relative importance of funeral versus health care worker transmission was essential to stopping disease spread. As a result, strategic policy decisions regarding interventions must rely on accurately characterizing risks associated with multiple transmission routes. The ongoing Zika virus (ZIKV) outbreak challenges our conventional methodologies for translating case-counts into route-specific transmission risk. Critically, most approaches will fail to accurately estimate the risk of sustained sexual transmission of a pathogen that is primarily vectored by a mosquito--such as the risk of sustained sexual transmission of ZIKV. By computationally investigating a novel mathematical approach for multi-route pathogens, our results suggest that previous epidemic threshold estimates could under-estimate the risk of sustained sexual transmission by at least an order of magnitude. This result, coupled with emerging clinical, epidemiological, and experimental evidence for an increased risk of sexual transmission, would strongly support recent calls to classify ZIKV as a sexually transmitted infection.\n\nAuthor summary\n--------------\nThe national and international community is grappling with how to respond to the ongoing Zika virus outbreak. One of the most uncertain aspects of this disease is its potential for sustained sexual transmission. Recent studies have suggested that there are large differences in the age- and sex-specific Zika virus attack rates--with women of childbearing age having the highest incidence of infection--and that the risk of sustained sexual transmission may be low. Here we investigate the novel epidemiological behavior of an infection that is transmitted both sexually and by a mosquito vector. Using data-driven simulations, we demonstrate how conventional methods can substantially underestimate the risk of sustained sexual transmission for Zika outbreaks. More specifically, we find that the threshold for large-scale, sustained sexual transmission could easily be underestimated by a factor of 10 or higher using existing models. Finally, we discuss how such an underestimate will lead to ineffective responses and a drastic underestimation of the risk associated with Zika persistence and re-emergence.\n\nDiscussion\n----------\nSustained sexual transmissions of ZIKV in the MSM community would lead to sporadic sub-critical, but potentially dramatic spillover outbreaks in the heterosexual community, and would increase the probability of endemic establishment of ZIKV. Our result that sexual transmission increases the potential epidemic size and the probability of establishment supports earlier findings from Gao et al. (2016). Public health decision- and policy-makers rely on accurate characterizations of transmission risk to decide on interventions and strategically allocate limited resources. For pathogens, like ZIKV which are both vectored by an insect and transmitted sexually (with sex-based asymmetry in transmission rate), conventional approaches will underestimate the risk associated with sexual transmission. Underestimating the risk of sexual transmission, both in terms of the average transmission risk and variation in transmission risk, will lead both to biased intervention efforts and to an underestimate of the potential for disease persistence. Additionally, given the differential rates of ZIKV testing in MSM versus non-MSM communities and the known heterogeneity between their contact distributions, the data on sexual transmission are almost certainly biased. We also do not have sufficient experimental or epidemiological evidence for the per-contact probability of transmission in the MSM community. Here we advocate for the decision-making and disease modeling communities to better embrace contact network methods when characterizing transmission risk and for increased ZIKV testing in both MSM and non-MSM communities. The resulting estimates of transmission risk and the key epidemiological measures, e.g Ro and the likelihood of disease persistence, will be more accurate.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The authors point out that both heterosexual transmission and between men who have sex with men (MSM) have been documented. So far, observations of instances of sexual transmission have overwhelmingly been men to women. However, the authors state that given the high level of asymmetry between probabilities of men-to-women and women-to-men transmissions, there is a potential for sustained epidemics within the MSM community but sub-critical in the rest of the population. This statistical model and its conclusions deserve verification in the populations at risk. Because mosquito transmission of Zika virus in the population in area of risk are common, determination of MSM sustained transmission would have to be determined in areas without active mosquito transmission. - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[4] Vaccine and pregnancy\nDate: Fri 22 Sep 2017\nSource: Nature Communications [edited]\nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-017-00737-8\n\n\nShan C, Muruato AE, Jagger BW, et al. A single-dose live-attenuated vaccine prevents Zika virus pregnancy transmission and testis damage. Nat Commun. 2017;8(1):676. doi: 10.1038/s41467-017-00737-8.\n\nAbstract\n--------\nZika virus infection during pregnancy can cause congenital abnormities or fetal demise. The persistence of Zika virus in the male reproductive system poses a risk of sexual transmission. Here we demonstrate that live-attenuated Zika virus vaccine candidates containing deletions in the 3' untranslated region of the Zika virus genome (ZIKV-3'UTR-LAV) prevent viral transmission during pregnancy and testis damage in mice, as well as infection of nonhuman primates. After a single-dose vaccination, pregnant mice challenged with Zika virus at embryonic day 6 and evaluated at embryonic day 13 show markedly diminished levels of viral RNA in maternal, placental, and fetal tissues. Vaccinated male mice challenged with Zika virus were protected against testis infection, injury, and oligospermia. A single immunization of rhesus macaques elicited a rapid and robust antibody response, conferring complete protection upon challenge. Furthermore, the ZIKV-3'UTR-LAV vaccine candidates have a desirable safety profile. These results suggest that further development of ZIKV-3'UTR-LAV is warranted for humans.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n[The results of these tests in mice indicated that vaccination protects against testis infection and reduces virus RNA in maternal, placental and fetal tissues. Although immunization elicited a protective antibody response in rhesus macaques, the next step will be to vaccinate pregnant rhesus macaques and determine if protection is provided to placental tissue and fetuses. - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[5] Zika virus encephalitis in adult\nDate: Sun 24 Sep 2017\nSource: Occup Med Health Aff [edited]\nhttps://www.omicsonline.org/open-access/zika-virus-encefalitis-2329-6879-1000306.pdf\n\n\nGonzalez LZ, Vergara JC, Jauregui JS.

He reported no headache, neck stiffness or seizures. Physical examination the patient was somnolent, with reactive isochoric pupils, quadriparetic with hyporeflexia. He became stuporous with shock and leukocytosis. Treatment with meropenem and vancomycin were initiated empirically. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain revealed hyper intense lesions in the brain stem, fornix and bilateral thalamus (Figures 1A and 1B) with no midline shift. The CSF analysis results were non-specific with mild protein elevation. CSF molecular biology testing with PCR RNA for Zika virus was positive. A diagnosis of acute disseminated Zika virus encephalitis was made. Immunomodulatory therapy with IVIG was initiated. Follow-up MRI of the brain showed progression of lesions to midbrain, basal ganglia and brain cortex (Figures 1C and 1D). He had no response to 5 days of IVIG therapy and subsequently the patient died.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[This reports another case of the neuropathological consequences of Zika virus infection in an adult.

Effect of acute Zika virus infection on sperm and virus clearance in body fluids: a prospective observational study. Lancet Infect Dis. 2017. pii: S1473-3099(17)30444-9. doi: 10.1016/S1473-3099(17)30444-9. [Epub ahead of print]\n\nSummary\n-------\nBackground\nEvidence of human sexual transmission during Zika virus emergence is a matter of concern, particularly in procreation, but to date, kinetics of seminal shedding and the effects of infection on human reproductive function have not been described. To investigate the effects of Zika virus infection on semen and clearance of Zika virus from semen and body fluids, we aimed to study a cohort of Zika virus-infected men.\n\nMethods\nThis prospective observational study recruited men presenting with acute Zika virus infection at Pointe-a-Pitre University Hospital in Guadeloupe, French Caribbean, where a Zika virus outbreak occurred between April and November, 2016. Blood, urine, and semen were collected at days 7, 11, 20, 30, 60, 90, and 120 after symptom onset, and semen characteristics, such as total sperm count, sperm motility, vitality, and morphology, and reproductive hormone concentrations, such as testosterone, inhibin, follicle-stimulating hormone, and luteinising hormone, were assessed. At days 7, 11, and 20, semen was processed to isolate motile spermatozoa. Zika virus RNA was detected by RT-PCR using whole blood, serum, urine, seminal plasma, semen cells, and motile spermatozoa fractions. Zika virus was isolated from different sperm fractions on Vero E6 cultures.\n\nFindings\nA total of 15 male volunteers (mean age 35 years [SD 5; range 25-44]) with acute Zika virus infection and positive Zika virus RNA detection in blood or urine were enrolled. Total sperm count was decreased from median 119 x 10^6 spermatozoa (IQR 22-234) at day 7 to 45 x 10^6 (16.5-89.6) at day 30 and 70 x 10^6 (28.5-81.4) at day 60, respectively, after Zika virus infection. Inhibin values increased from 93.5 pg/mL (IQR 55-162) at day 7 to 150 pg/mL (78-209) at day 120 when total sperm count recovered. In motile spermatozoa obtained after density gradient separation, Zika virus RNA was found in 3 of 14 patients at day 7, 4 of 15 at day 11, and 4 of 15 at day 20, and replication-competent virus was found in the tested patient. Seminal shedding kinetics seemed heterogeneous among patients. Whole blood was the fluid most frequently positive for Zika virus RNA (62 of 92 samples) and 3 patients remained positive at day 120.\n\nInterpretation\nSemen alterations early after acute Zika virus infection might affect fertility and could be explained by virus effects on the testis and epididymis. Frequency of shedding and high viral load in semen, together with the presence of replicative virus in a motile spermatozoa fraction, can lead to Zika virus transmission during sexual contact and assisted reproduction procedures. Whole blood seems to be the best specimen for Zika virus RNA detection, diagnosis, and follow-up.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nRoland H\u00fcbner\nSuperior Health Council\nBrussels\nBelgium\n<roland.hubner@sante.belgique.be>\n\n[This study addresses 2 important questions that have been raised from the previous studies that detected Zika virus RNA in semen and seminal fluids: is transmissible virus present in those RNA positive specimens and are there effects on spermatozoa that could affect fertility. In the above study, replication-competent Zika virus was found in motile spermatozoa at post-infection day 20. Additional studies will be necessary to determine if active virus occurs in those infected men beyond 20 days, and in those individuals who have detectable Zika virus RNA for up to 6 months. The above study clearly demonstrates that Zika virus infections of testis and epididymis can decrease sperm numbers and an increase of multiple sperm anomalies, especially in patients with Zika virus RNA-positive seminal specimens that could adversely affect fertility.

The risk of sustained sexual transmission of Zika is underestimated. PLoS Pathog. 2017;13(9):e1006633. doi: 10.1371/journal.ppat.1006633. [Epub ahead of print]\n\nAbstract\n--------\nPathogens often follow more than one transmission route during outbreaks--from needle sharing plus sexual transmission of HIV to small droplet aerosol plus fomite transmission of influenza. Thus, controlling an infectious disease outbreak often requires characterizing the risk associated with multiple mechanisms of transmission. For example, during the Ebola virus outbreak in West Africa, weighing the relative importance of funeral versus health care worker transmission was essential to stopping disease spread. As a result, strategic policy decisions regarding interventions must rely on accurately characterizing risks associated with multiple transmission routes. The ongoing Zika virus (ZIKV) outbreak challenges our conventional methodologies for translating case-counts into route-specific transmission risk. Critically, most approaches will fail to accurately estimate the risk of sustained sexual transmission of a pathogen that is primarily vectored by a mosquito--such as the risk of sustained sexual transmission of ZIKV. By computationally investigating a novel mathematical approach for multi-route pathogens, our results suggest that previous epidemic threshold estimates could under-estimate the risk of sustained sexual transmission by at least an order of magnitude. This result, coupled with emerging clinical, epidemiological, and experimental evidence for an increased risk of sexual transmission, would strongly support recent calls to classify ZIKV as a sexually transmitted infection.\n\nAuthor summary\n--------------\nThe national and international community is grappling with how to respond to the ongoing Zika virus outbreak. One of the most uncertain aspects of this disease is its potential for sustained sexual transmission. Recent studies have suggested that there are large differences in the age- and sex-specific Zika virus attack rates--with women of childbearing age having the highest incidence of infection--and that the risk of sustained sexual transmission may be low. Here we investigate the novel epidemiological behavior of an infection that is transmitted both sexually and by a mosquito vector. Using data-driven simulations, we demonstrate how conventional methods can substantially underestimate the risk of sustained sexual transmission for Zika outbreaks. More specifically, we find that the threshold for large-scale, sustained sexual transmission could easily be underestimated by a factor of 10 or higher using existing models. Finally, we discuss how such an underestimate will lead to ineffective responses and a drastic underestimation of the risk associated with Zika persistence and re-emergence.\n\nDiscussion\n----------\nSustained sexual transmissions of ZIKV in the MSM community would lead to sporadic sub-critical, but potentially dramatic spillover outbreaks in the heterosexual community, and would increase the probability of endemic establishment of ZIKV. Our result that sexual transmission increases the potential epidemic size and the probability of establishment supports earlier findings from Gao et al. (2016). Public health decision- and policy-makers rely on accurate characterizations of transmission risk to decide on interventions and strategically allocate limited resources. For pathogens, like ZIKV which are both vectored by an insect and transmitted sexually (with sex-based asymmetry in transmission rate), conventional approaches will underestimate the risk associated with sexual transmission. Underestimating the risk of sexual transmission, both in terms of the average transmission risk and variation in transmission risk, will lead both to biased intervention efforts and to an underestimate of the potential for disease persistence. Additionally, given the differential rates of ZIKV testing in MSM versus non-MSM communities and the known heterogeneity between their contact distributions, the data on sexual transmission are almost certainly biased. We also do not have sufficient experimental or epidemiological evidence for the per-contact probability of transmission in the MSM community. Here we advocate for the decision-making and disease modeling communities to better embrace contact network methods when characterizing transmission risk and for increased ZIKV testing in both MSM and non-MSM communities. The resulting estimates of transmission risk and the key epidemiological measures, e.g Ro and the likelihood of disease persistence, will be more accurate.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The authors point out that both heterosexual transmission and between men who have sex with men (MSM) have been documented. So far, observations of instances of sexual transmission have overwhelmingly been men to women. However, the authors state that given the high level of asymmetry between probabilities of men-to-women and women-to-men transmissions, there is a potential for sustained epidemics within the MSM community but sub-critical in the rest of the population. This statistical model and its conclusions deserve verification in the populations at risk. Because mosquito transmission of Zika virus in the population in area of risk are common, determination of MSM sustained transmission would have to be determined in areas without active mosquito transmission. - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[4] Vaccine and pregnancy\nDate: Fri 22 Sep 2017\nSource: Nature Communications [edited]\nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-017-00737-8\n\n\nShan C, Muruato AE, Jagger BW, et al. A single-dose live-attenuated vaccine prevents Zika virus pregnancy transmission and testis damage. Nat Commun. 2017;8(1):676. doi: 10.1038/s41467-017-00737-8.\n\nAbstract\n--------\nZika virus infection during pregnancy can cause congenital abnormities or fetal demise. The persistence of Zika virus in the male reproductive system poses a risk of sexual transmission. Here we demonstrate that live-attenuated Zika virus vaccine candidates containing deletions in the 3' untranslated region of the Zika virus genome (ZIKV-3'UTR-LAV) prevent viral transmission during pregnancy and testis damage in mice, as well as infection of nonhuman primates. After a single-dose vaccination, pregnant mice challenged with Zika virus at embryonic day 6 and evaluated at embryonic day 13 show markedly diminished levels of viral RNA in maternal, placental, and fetal tissues. Vaccinated male mice challenged with Zika virus were protected against testis infection, injury, and oligospermia. A single immunization of rhesus macaques elicited a rapid and robust antibody response, conferring complete protection upon challenge. Furthermore, the ZIKV-3'UTR-LAV vaccine candidates have a desirable safety profile. These results suggest that further development of ZIKV-3'UTR-LAV is warranted for humans.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n[The results of these tests in mice indicated that vaccination protects against testis infection and reduces virus RNA in maternal, placental and fetal tissues. Although immunization elicited a protective antibody response in rhesus macaques, the next step will be to vaccinate pregnant rhesus macaques and determine if protection is provided to placental tissue and fetuses. - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[5] Zika virus encephalitis in adult\nDate: Sun 24 Sep 2017\nSource: Occup Med Health Aff [edited]\nhttps://www.omicsonline.org/open-access/zika-virus-encefalitis-2329-6879-1000306.pdf\n\n\nGonzalez LZ, Vergara JC, Jauregui JS.

He reported no headache, neck stiffness or seizures. Physical examination the patient was somnolent, with reactive isochoric pupils, quadriparetic with hyporeflexia. He became stuporous with shock and leukocytosis. Treatment with meropenem and vancomycin were initiated empirically. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain revealed hyper intense lesions in the brain stem, fornix and bilateral thalamus (Figures 1A and 1B) with no midline shift. The CSF analysis results were non-specific with mild protein elevation. CSF molecular biology testing with PCR RNA for Zika virus was positive. A diagnosis of acute disseminated Zika virus encephalitis was made. Immunomodulatory therapy with IVIG was initiated. Follow-up MRI of the brain showed progression of lesions to midbrain, basal ganglia and brain cortex (Figures 1C and 1D). He had no response to 5 days of IVIG therapy and subsequently the patient died.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[This reports another case of the neuropathological consequences of Zika virus infection in an adult.

Effect of acute Zika virus infection on sperm and virus clearance in body fluids: a prospective observational study. Lancet Infect Dis. 2017. pii: S1473-3099(17)30444-9. doi: 10.1016/S1473-3099(17)30444-9. [Epub ahead of print]\n\nSummary\n-------\nBackground\nEvidence of human sexual transmission during Zika virus emergence is a matter of concern, particularly in procreation, but to date, kinetics of seminal shedding and the effects of infection on human reproductive function have not been described. To investigate the effects of Zika virus infection on semen and clearance of Zika virus from semen and body fluids, we aimed to study a cohort of Zika virus-infected men.\n\nMethods\nThis prospective observational study recruited men presenting with acute Zika virus infection at Pointe-a-Pitre University Hospital in Guadeloupe, French Caribbean, where a Zika virus outbreak occurred between April and November, 2016. Blood, urine, and semen were collected at days 7, 11, 20, 30, 60, 90, and 120 after symptom onset, and semen characteristics, such as total sperm count, sperm motility, vitality, and morphology, and reproductive hormone concentrations, such as testosterone, inhibin, follicle-stimulating hormone, and luteinising hormone, were assessed. At days 7, 11, and 20, semen was processed to isolate motile spermatozoa. Zika virus RNA was detected by RT-PCR using whole blood, serum, urine, seminal plasma, semen cells, and motile spermatozoa fractions. Zika virus was isolated from different sperm fractions on Vero E6 cultures.\n\nFindings\nA total of 15 male volunteers (mean age 35 years [SD 5; range 25-44]) with acute Zika virus infection and positive Zika virus RNA detection in blood or urine were enrolled. Total sperm count was decreased from median 119 x 10^6 spermatozoa (IQR 22-234) at day 7 to 45 x 10^6 (16.5-89.6) at day 30 and 70 x 10^6 (28.5-81.4) at day 60, respectively, after Zika virus infection. Inhibin values increased from 93.5 pg/mL (IQR 55-162) at day 7 to 150 pg/mL (78-209) at day 120 when total sperm count recovered. In motile spermatozoa obtained after density gradient separation, Zika virus RNA was found in 3 of 14 patients at day 7, 4 of 15 at day 11, and 4 of 15 at day 20, and replication-competent virus was found in the tested patient. Seminal shedding kinetics seemed heterogeneous among patients. Whole blood was the fluid most frequently positive for Zika virus RNA (62 of 92 samples) and 3 patients remained positive at day 120.\n\nInterpretation\nSemen alterations early after acute Zika virus infection might affect fertility and could be explained by virus effects on the testis and epididymis. Frequency of shedding and high viral load in semen, together with the presence of replicative virus in a motile spermatozoa fraction, can lead to Zika virus transmission during sexual contact and assisted reproduction procedures. Whole blood seems to be the best specimen for Zika virus RNA detection, diagnosis, and follow-up.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nRoland H\u00fcbner\nSuperior Health Council\nBrussels\nBelgium\n<roland.hubner@sante.belgique.be>\n\n[This study addresses 2 important questions that have been raised from the previous studies that detected Zika virus RNA in semen and seminal fluids: is transmissible virus present in those RNA positive specimens and are there effects on spermatozoa that could affect fertility. In the above study, replication-competent Zika virus was found in motile spermatozoa at post-infection day 20. Additional studies will be necessary to determine if active virus occurs in those infected men beyond 20 days, and in those individuals who have detectable Zika virus RNA for up to 6 months. The above study clearly demonstrates that Zika virus infections of testis and epididymis can decrease sperm numbers and an increase of multiple sperm anomalies, especially in patients with Zika virus RNA-positive seminal specimens that could adversely affect fertility.

The risk of sustained sexual transmission of Zika is underestimated. PLoS Pathog. 2017;13(9):e1006633. doi: 10.1371/journal.ppat.1006633. [Epub ahead of print]\n\nAbstract\n--------\nPathogens often follow more than one transmission route during outbreaks--from needle sharing plus sexual transmission of HIV to small droplet aerosol plus fomite transmission of influenza. Thus, controlling an infectious disease outbreak often requires characterizing the risk associated with multiple mechanisms of transmission. For example, during the Ebola virus outbreak in West Africa, weighing the relative importance of funeral versus health care worker transmission was essential to stopping disease spread. As a result, strategic policy decisions regarding interventions must rely on accurately characterizing risks associated with multiple transmission routes. The ongoing Zika virus (ZIKV) outbreak challenges our conventional methodologies for translating case-counts into route-specific transmission risk. Critically, most approaches will fail to accurately estimate the risk of sustained sexual transmission of a pathogen that is primarily vectored by a mosquito--such as the risk of sustained sexual transmission of ZIKV. By computationally investigating a novel mathematical approach for multi-route pathogens, our results suggest that previous epidemic threshold estimates could under-estimate the risk of sustained sexual transmission by at least an order of magnitude. This result, coupled with emerging clinical, epidemiological, and experimental evidence for an increased risk of sexual transmission, would strongly support recent calls to classify ZIKV as a sexually transmitted infection.\n\nAuthor summary\n--------------\nThe national and international community is grappling with how to respond to the ongoing Zika virus outbreak. One of the most uncertain aspects of this disease is its potential for sustained sexual transmission. Recent studies have suggested that there are large differences in the age- and sex-specific Zika virus attack rates--with women of childbearing age having the highest incidence of infection--and that the risk of sustained sexual transmission may be low. Here we investigate the novel epidemiological behavior of an infection that is transmitted both sexually and by a mosquito vector. Using data-driven simulations, we demonstrate how conventional methods can substantially underestimate the risk of sustained sexual transmission for Zika outbreaks. More specifically, we find that the threshold for large-scale, sustained sexual transmission could easily be underestimated by a factor of 10 or higher using existing models. Finally, we discuss how such an underestimate will lead to ineffective responses and a drastic underestimation of the risk associated with Zika persistence and re-emergence.\n\nDiscussion\n----------\nSustained sexual transmissions of ZIKV in the MSM community would lead to sporadic sub-critical, but potentially dramatic spillover outbreaks in the heterosexual community, and would increase the probability of endemic establishment of ZIKV. Our result that sexual transmission increases the potential epidemic size and the probability of establishment supports earlier findings from Gao et al. (2016). Public health decision- and policy-makers rely on accurate characterizations of transmission risk to decide on interventions and strategically allocate limited resources. For pathogens, like ZIKV which are both vectored by an insect and transmitted sexually (with sex-based asymmetry in transmission rate), conventional approaches will underestimate the risk associated with sexual transmission. Underestimating the risk of sexual transmission, both in terms of the average transmission risk and variation in transmission risk, will lead both to biased intervention efforts and to an underestimate of the potential for disease persistence. Additionally, given the differential rates of ZIKV testing in MSM versus non-MSM communities and the known heterogeneity between their contact distributions, the data on sexual transmission are almost certainly biased. We also do not have sufficient experimental or epidemiological evidence for the per-contact probability of transmission in the MSM community. Here we advocate for the decision-making and disease modeling communities to better embrace contact network methods when characterizing transmission risk and for increased ZIKV testing in both MSM and non-MSM communities. The resulting estimates of transmission risk and the key epidemiological measures, e.g Ro and the likelihood of disease persistence, will be more accurate.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The authors point out that both heterosexual transmission and between men who have sex with men (MSM) have been documented. So far, observations of instances of sexual transmission have overwhelmingly been men to women. However, the authors state that given the high level of asymmetry between probabilities of men-to-women and women-to-men transmissions, there is a potential for sustained epidemics within the MSM community but sub-critical in the rest of the population. This statistical model and its conclusions deserve verification in the populations at risk. Because mosquito transmission of Zika virus in the population in area of risk are common, determination of MSM sustained transmission would have to be determined in areas without active mosquito transmission. - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[4] Vaccine and pregnancy\nDate: Fri 22 Sep 2017\nSource: Nature Communications [edited]\nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-017-00737-8\n\n\nShan C, Muruato AE, Jagger BW, et al. A single-dose live-attenuated vaccine prevents Zika virus pregnancy transmission and testis damage. Nat Commun. 2017;8(1):676. doi: 10.1038/s41467-017-00737-8.\n\nAbstract\n--------\nZika virus infection during pregnancy can cause congenital abnormities or fetal demise. The persistence of Zika virus in the male reproductive system poses a risk of sexual transmission. Here we demonstrate that live-attenuated Zika virus vaccine candidates containing deletions in the 3' untranslated region of the Zika virus genome (ZIKV-3'UTR-LAV) prevent viral transmission during pregnancy and testis damage in mice, as well as infection of nonhuman primates. After a single-dose vaccination, pregnant mice challenged with Zika virus at embryonic day 6 and evaluated at embryonic day 13 show markedly diminished levels of viral RNA in maternal, placental, and fetal tissues. Vaccinated male mice challenged with Zika virus were protected against testis infection, injury, and oligospermia. A single immunization of rhesus macaques elicited a rapid and robust antibody response, conferring complete protection upon challenge. Furthermore, the ZIKV-3'UTR-LAV vaccine candidates have a desirable safety profile. These results suggest that further development of ZIKV-3'UTR-LAV is warranted for humans.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n[The results of these tests in mice indicated that vaccination protects against testis infection and reduces virus RNA in maternal, placental and fetal tissues. Although immunization elicited a protective antibody response in rhesus macaques, the next step will be to vaccinate pregnant rhesus macaques and determine if protection is provided to placental tissue and fetuses. - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[5] Zika virus encephalitis in adult\nDate: Sun 24 Sep 2017\nSource: Occup Med Health Aff [edited]\nhttps://www.omicsonline.org/open-access/zika-virus-encefalitis-2329-6879-1000306.pdf\n\n\nGonzalez LZ, Vergara JC, Jauregui JS.

He reported no headache, neck stiffness or seizures. Physical examination the patient was somnolent, with reactive isochoric pupils, quadriparetic with hyporeflexia. He became stuporous with shock and leukocytosis. Treatment with meropenem and vancomycin were initiated empirically. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain revealed hyper intense lesions in the brain stem, fornix and bilateral thalamus (Figures 1A and 1B) with no midline shift. The CSF analysis results were non-specific with mild protein elevation. CSF molecular biology testing with PCR RNA for Zika virus was positive. A diagnosis of acute disseminated Zika virus encephalitis was made. Immunomodulatory therapy with IVIG was initiated. Follow-up MRI of the brain showed progression of lesions to midbrain, basal ganglia and brain cortex (Figures 1C and 1D). He had no response to 5 days of IVIG therapy and subsequently the patient died.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[This reports another case of the neuropathological consequences of Zika virus infection in an adult.

Effect of acute Zika virus infection on sperm and virus clearance in body fluids: a prospective observational study. Lancet Infect Dis. 2017. pii: S1473-3099(17)30444-9. doi: 10.1016/S1473-3099(17)30444-9. [Epub ahead of print]\n\nSummary\n-------\nBackground\nEvidence of human sexual transmission during Zika virus emergence is a matter of concern, particularly in procreation, but to date, kinetics of seminal shedding and the effects of infection on human reproductive function have not been described. To investigate the effects of Zika virus infection on semen and clearance of Zika virus from semen and body fluids, we aimed to study a cohort of Zika virus-infected men.\n\nMethods\nThis prospective observational study recruited men presenting with acute Zika virus infection at Pointe-a-Pitre University Hospital in Guadeloupe, French Caribbean, where a Zika virus outbreak occurred between April and November, 2016. Blood, urine, and semen were collected at days 7, 11, 20, 30, 60, 90, and 120 after symptom onset, and semen characteristics, such as total sperm count, sperm motility, vitality, and morphology, and reproductive hormone concentrations, such as testosterone, inhibin, follicle-stimulating hormone, and luteinising hormone, were assessed. At days 7, 11, and 20, semen was processed to isolate motile spermatozoa. Zika virus RNA was detected by RT-PCR using whole blood, serum, urine, seminal plasma, semen cells, and motile spermatozoa fractions. Zika virus was isolated from different sperm fractions on Vero E6 cultures.\n\nFindings\nA total of 15 male volunteers (mean age 35 years [SD 5; range 25-44]) with acute Zika virus infection and positive Zika virus RNA detection in blood or urine were enrolled. Total sperm count was decreased from median 119 x 10^6 spermatozoa (IQR 22-234) at day 7 to 45 x 10^6 (16.5-89.6) at day 30 and 70 x 10^6 (28.5-81.4) at day 60, respectively, after Zika virus infection. Inhibin values increased from 93.5 pg/mL (IQR 55-162) at day 7 to 150 pg/mL (78-209) at day 120 when total sperm count recovered. In motile spermatozoa obtained after density gradient separation, Zika virus RNA was found in 3 of 14 patients at day 7, 4 of 15 at day 11, and 4 of 15 at day 20, and replication-competent virus was found in the tested patient. Seminal shedding kinetics seemed heterogeneous among patients. Whole blood was the fluid most frequently positive for Zika virus RNA (62 of 92 samples) and 3 patients remained positive at day 120.\n\nInterpretation\nSemen alterations early after acute Zika virus infection might affect fertility and could be explained by virus effects on the testis and epididymis. Frequency of shedding and high viral load in semen, together with the presence of replicative virus in a motile spermatozoa fraction, can lead to Zika virus transmission during sexual contact and assisted reproduction procedures. Whole blood seems to be the best specimen for Zika virus RNA detection, diagnosis, and follow-up.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nRoland H\u00fcbner\nSuperior Health Council\nBrussels\nBelgium\n<roland.hubner@sante.belgique.be>\n\n[This study addresses 2 important questions that have been raised from the previous studies that detected Zika virus RNA in semen and seminal fluids: is transmissible virus present in those RNA positive specimens and are there effects on spermatozoa that could affect fertility. In the above study, replication-competent Zika virus was found in motile spermatozoa at post-infection day 20. Additional studies will be necessary to determine if active virus occurs in those infected men beyond 20 days, and in those individuals who have detectable Zika virus RNA for up to 6 months. The above study clearly demonstrates that Zika virus infections of testis and epididymis can decrease sperm numbers and an increase of multiple sperm anomalies, especially in patients with Zika virus RNA-positive seminal specimens that could adversely affect fertility.

The risk of sustained sexual transmission of Zika is underestimated. PLoS Pathog. 2017;13(9):e1006633. doi: 10.1371/journal.ppat.1006633. [Epub ahead of print]\n\nAbstract\n--------\nPathogens often follow more than one transmission route during outbreaks--from needle sharing plus sexual transmission of HIV to small droplet aerosol plus fomite transmission of influenza. Thus, controlling an infectious disease outbreak often requires characterizing the risk associated with multiple mechanisms of transmission. For example, during the Ebola virus outbreak in West Africa, weighing the relative importance of funeral versus health care worker transmission was essential to stopping disease spread. As a result, strategic policy decisions regarding interventions must rely on accurately characterizing risks associated with multiple transmission routes. The ongoing Zika virus (ZIKV) outbreak challenges our conventional methodologies for translating case-counts into route-specific transmission risk. Critically, most approaches will fail to accurately estimate the risk of sustained sexual transmission of a pathogen that is primarily vectored by a mosquito--such as the risk of sustained sexual transmission of ZIKV. By computationally investigating a novel mathematical approach for multi-route pathogens, our results suggest that previous epidemic threshold estimates could under-estimate the risk of sustained sexual transmission by at least an order of magnitude. This result, coupled with emerging clinical, epidemiological, and experimental evidence for an increased risk of sexual transmission, would strongly support recent calls to classify ZIKV as a sexually transmitted infection.\n\nAuthor summary\n--------------\nThe national and international community is grappling with how to respond to the ongoing Zika virus outbreak. One of the most uncertain aspects of this disease is its potential for sustained sexual transmission. Recent studies have suggested that there are large differences in the age- and sex-specific Zika virus attack rates--with women of childbearing age having the highest incidence of infection--and that the risk of sustained sexual transmission may be low. Here we investigate the novel epidemiological behavior of an infection that is transmitted both sexually and by a mosquito vector. Using data-driven simulations, we demonstrate how conventional methods can substantially underestimate the risk of sustained sexual transmission for Zika outbreaks. More specifically, we find that the threshold for large-scale, sustained sexual transmission could easily be underestimated by a factor of 10 or higher using existing models. Finally, we discuss how such an underestimate will lead to ineffective responses and a drastic underestimation of the risk associated with Zika persistence and re-emergence.\n\nDiscussion\n----------\nSustained sexual transmissions of ZIKV in the MSM community would lead to sporadic sub-critical, but potentially dramatic spillover outbreaks in the heterosexual community, and would increase the probability of endemic establishment of ZIKV. Our result that sexual transmission increases the potential epidemic size and the probability of establishment supports earlier findings from Gao et al. (2016). Public health decision- and policy-makers rely on accurate characterizations of transmission risk to decide on interventions and strategically allocate limited resources. For pathogens, like ZIKV which are both vectored by an insect and transmitted sexually (with sex-based asymmetry in transmission rate), conventional approaches will underestimate the risk associated with sexual transmission. Underestimating the risk of sexual transmission, both in terms of the average transmission risk and variation in transmission risk, will lead both to biased intervention efforts and to an underestimate of the potential for disease persistence. Additionally, given the differential rates of ZIKV testing in MSM versus non-MSM communities and the known heterogeneity between their contact distributions, the data on sexual transmission are almost certainly biased. We also do not have sufficient experimental or epidemiological evidence for the per-contact probability of transmission in the MSM community. Here we advocate for the decision-making and disease modeling communities to better embrace contact network methods when characterizing transmission risk and for increased ZIKV testing in both MSM and non-MSM communities. The resulting estimates of transmission risk and the key epidemiological measures, e.g Ro and the likelihood of disease persistence, will be more accurate.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The authors point out that both heterosexual transmission and between men who have sex with men (MSM) have been documented. So far, observations of instances of sexual transmission have overwhelmingly been men to women. However, the authors state that given the high level of asymmetry between probabilities of men-to-women and women-to-men transmissions, there is a potential for sustained epidemics within the MSM community but sub-critical in the rest of the population. This statistical model and its conclusions deserve verification in the populations at risk. Because mosquito transmission of Zika virus in the population in area of risk are common, determination of MSM sustained transmission would have to be determined in areas without active mosquito transmission. - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[4] Vaccine and pregnancy\nDate: Fri 22 Sep 2017\nSource: Nature Communications [edited]\nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-017-00737-8\n\n\nShan C, Muruato AE, Jagger BW, et al. A single-dose live-attenuated vaccine prevents Zika virus pregnancy transmission and testis damage. Nat Commun. 2017;8(1):676. doi: 10.1038/s41467-017-00737-8.\n\nAbstract\n--------\nZika virus infection during pregnancy can cause congenital abnormities or fetal demise. The persistence of Zika virus in the male reproductive system poses a risk of sexual transmission. Here we demonstrate that live-attenuated Zika virus vaccine candidates containing deletions in the 3' untranslated region of the Zika virus genome (ZIKV-3'UTR-LAV) prevent viral transmission during pregnancy and testis damage in mice, as well as infection of nonhuman primates. After a single-dose vaccination, pregnant mice challenged with Zika virus at embryonic day 6 and evaluated at embryonic day 13 show markedly diminished levels of viral RNA in maternal, placental, and fetal tissues. Vaccinated male mice challenged with Zika virus were protected against testis infection, injury, and oligospermia. A single immunization of rhesus macaques elicited a rapid and robust antibody response, conferring complete protection upon challenge. Furthermore, the ZIKV-3'UTR-LAV vaccine candidates have a desirable safety profile. These results suggest that further development of ZIKV-3'UTR-LAV is warranted for humans.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n[The results of these tests in mice indicated that vaccination protects against testis infection and reduces virus RNA in maternal, placental and fetal tissues. Although immunization elicited a protective antibody response in rhesus macaques, the next step will be to vaccinate pregnant rhesus macaques and determine if protection is provided to placental tissue and fetuses. - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[5] Zika virus encephalitis in adult\nDate: Sun 24 Sep 2017\nSource: Occup Med Health Aff [edited]\nhttps://www.omicsonline.org/open-access/zika-virus-encefalitis-2329-6879-1000306.pdf\n\n\nGonzalez LZ, Vergara JC, Jauregui JS.

He reported no headache, neck stiffness or seizures. Physical examination the patient was somnolent, with reactive isochoric pupils, quadriparetic with hyporeflexia. He became stuporous with shock and leukocytosis. Treatment with meropenem and vancomycin were initiated empirically. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain revealed hyper intense lesions in the brain stem, fornix and bilateral thalamus (Figures 1A and 1B) with no midline shift. The CSF analysis results were non-specific with mild protein elevation. CSF molecular biology testing with PCR RNA for Zika virus was positive. A diagnosis of acute disseminated Zika virus encephalitis was made. Immunomodulatory therapy with IVIG was initiated. Follow-up MRI of the brain showed progression of lesions to midbrain, basal ganglia and brain cortex (Figures 1C and 1D). He had no response to 5 days of IVIG therapy and subsequently the patient died.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[This reports another case of the neuropathological consequences of Zika virus infection in an adult.

Local transmission of Zika virus was reported in U.S. territories in 2016.\n\nWhat is added by this report?\nOverall, about 5 percent of fetuses and infants born to women with laboratory evidence of recent possible Zika virus infection in the U.S. territories had possible Zika-associated birth defects, the same as the percentage reported in the 50 U.S. states during 2016. Possible Zika-associated birth defects including brain abnormalities and/or microcephaly were reported following Zika virus infection during every trimester of pregnancy. Among completed pregnancies with positive nucleic acid tests confirming Zika virus infection identified in the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd trimesters, the percentages of fetuses or infants with possible Zika-associated birth defects was 8, 5, and 4 percent, respectively.\n\nWhat are the implications for public health practice?\nCurrent data suggest that Zika virus infection during any trimester of pregnancy might result in Zika-associated birth defects. Identification and follow-up of infants born to women with laboratory evidence of recent possible Zika virus infection during pregnancy can facilitate timely and appropriate clinical intervention services and assessment of future needs. Information about adherence to the recommended newborn testing and screening can improve monitoring and care of infants affected by Zika.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The risks of teratogenic effects when Zika virus infection occurs during any phase of pregnancy are real.

The samples were also tested for West Nile virus, Chagas and dengue, recombinant dengue virus, recombinant chikungunya virus, human papilloma virus, herpes simplex virus 1, herpes simplex virus 2, _Chlamydia_, and gonorrhea. The experiment was repeated 3 times and in triplicates each time.\n\nThe assay was found to be 100 percent sensitive and 100 percent specific to ZIKV RNA from semen samples with a limit of detection of 5 viral copies per mL of semen.\n\nZika fever symptoms are often misdiagnosed due to its nonspecific clinical symptoms, so an accurate diagnosis is of paramount importance for management of the disease and to prevent neonatal infections.

Nat Commun. 2017 Jun 7;8:15743. doi: 10.1038/ncomms15743\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nAbstract\n--------\nZika virus (ZIKV) is an emerging pathogen causally associated with serious sequelae in fetuses, inducing fetal microcephaly and other neurodevelopment defects. ZIKV is primarily transmitted by mosquitoes, but can persist in human semen and sperm, and sexual transmission has been documented. Moreover, exposure of type-I interferon knockout mice to ZIKV results in severe damage to the testes, epididymis, and sperm. Candidate ZIKV vaccines have shown protective efficacy in preclinical studies carried out in animal models, and several vaccines have entered clinical trials. Here, we report that administration of a synthetic DNA vaccine encoding ZIKV pre-membrane and envelope (prME) completely protects mice against ZIKV-associated damage to the testes and sperm and prevents viral persistence in the testes following challenge with a contemporary strain of ZIKV. These data suggest that DNA vaccination merits further investigation as a potential means to reduce ZIKV persistence in the male reproductive tract.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n[It will be interesting to see the results when the vaccine has completed tests in non-human primates. - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[5] Dual Zika and chikungunya virus transmission\nDate: Thu 1 Jun 2017\nSource: PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases [edited]\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0005654 [edited]\n<http://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0005654\n\n\nref: G\u00f6ertz GP, Vogels CBF, Geertsema C, et al: Mosquito co-infection with Zika and chikungunya virus allows simultaneous transmission without affecting vector competence of _Aedes aegypti_. PLoS Negl Trop Dis. 2017 Jun 1;11(6):e0005654. doi: 10.1371/journal.pntd.0005654\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nAbstract\n--------\nBackground. Zika virus (ZIKV) and chikungunya virus (CHIKV) are highly pathogenic arthropod-borne viruses that are currently a serious health burden in the Americas, and elsewhere in the world. ZIKV and CHIKV co-circulate in the same geographical regions and are mainly transmitted by _Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes. There is a growing number of case reports of ZIKV and CHIKV co-infections in humans, but it is uncertain whether co-infection occurs via single or multiple mosquito bites. Here we investigate the potential of _Ae. aegypti_ mosquitoes to transmit both ZIKV and CHIKV in one bite, and we assess the consequences of co-infection on vector competence\n\nMethodology/principal findings. 1st, growth curves indicated that co-infection with CHIKV negatively affects ZIKV production in mammalian, but not in mosquito cells. Next, _Ae. aegypti_ mosquitoes were infected with ZIKV, CHIKV, or co-infected via an infectious blood meal or intrathoracic injections. Infection and transmission rates, as well as viral titers of positive mosquitoes, were determined at 14 days after blood meal or 7 days after injection. Saliva and bodies of (co-)infected mosquitoes were scored concurrently for the presence of ZIKV and/or CHIKV using a dual-colour immunofluorescence assay. The results show that orally exposed _Ae. aegypti_ mosquitoes are highly competent, with transmission rates of up to 73 percent for ZIKV, 21 percent for CHIKV, and 12 percent of mosquitoes transmitting both viruses in one bite. However, simultaneous oral exposure to both viruses did not change infection and transmission rates compared to exposure to a single virus. Intrathoracic injections indicate that the selected strain of _Ae. aegypti_ has a strong salivary gland barrier for CHIKV, but a less profound barrier for ZIKV.\n\nConclusions/significance. This study shows that _Ae. aegypti_ can transmit both ZIKV and CHIKV via a single bite. Furthermore, co-infection of ZIKV and CHIKV does not influence the vector competence of _Ae. aegypti_.\n\nAuthor summary\n--------------\nZika virus (ZIKV) and chikungunya virus (CHIKV) are highly pathogenic arthropod-borne viruses that present a serious health threat to humans. Since 2015, both viruses circulate in the same geographical regions of the Americas and are predominantly transmitted by the yellow fever mosquito _Ae. aegypti_. There is a growing number of case reports of ZIKV and CHIKV co-infections in humans, but it is uncertain whether co-infection occurred via single or multiple mosquito bites. Therefore, we infected _Ae. aegypti_ mosquitoes via an infectious blood meal with ZIKV, CHIKV, or both and scored the saliva of (co-)infected mosquitoes 14 days post infection for the presence of ZIKV, CHIKV or both. _Ae. aegypti_ was competent for both viruses with transmission rates up to 73 percent (ZIKV) and 21 percent (CHIKV). A substantial proportion of mosquitoes became saliva-positive for both viruses (12 percent), suggesting that _Ae. aegypti_ can transmit both CHIKV and ZIKV via a single bite. Additionally, co-infections did not influence the infection or transmission rates of either ZIKV or CHIKV. Our results indicate that co-infection of CHIKV and ZIKV can lead to simultaneous transmission by the same mosquito in the field.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n[George Robertson (grobertson@path.org>) also sent in this report, and is thanked. - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[6] NS1 vaccine\nDate: Sun 4 Jun 2017\nSource: American Society for Microbiology [edited]\nhttps://www.asm.org/index.php/newsroom/item/6507-development-of-a-novel-vaccine-for-zika\n\n\nResearch presented by Farshad Guirakhoo, PhD, Chief Scientific Officer, GeoVax, Inc, at the ASM Microbe 2017 meeting showed a new Zika virus vaccine that gives 100 percent protection in mice. The vaccine is the 1st to be based on the Zika virus NS1 protein, and the 1st to show single-dose protection against Zika in an immunocompetent lethal mouse challenge model. Results of the study were presented on [4 Jun 2017] at the American Society for Microbiology (ASM) Microbe conference in New Orleans [1-5 Jun 2017].\n\nIn the presented study, outbred immunocompetent mice were exposed to a lethal challenge dose of Zika virus delivered directly into the brain. \"A single dose of GeoVax's NS1 vaccine candidate protected 100 percent of vaccinated animals,\" said Guirakhoo. In contrast, 80-90 percent of sham-immunized control animals died within 7-10 days.\n\nBecause the NS1 antigen is not presented on the surface of the virus, it was chosen as the target immunogen for the vaccine to avoid a potential risk of disease enhancement when vaccines are developed based on Zika virus envelope proteins. This antibody dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection phenomena has been shown between Zika virus and a related flavivirus, dengue, in both in vitro and in vivo studies.\n\nAn NS1-based vaccine could also limit or block transmission of Zika virus in its mosquito vector. The NS1 protein is abundantly produced by flaviviruses in infected hosts and is picked up together with the virus after the mosquito takes a blood meal from humans. The NS1 proteins interfere with the innate immune system of the mosquito, evolved to fight foreign pathogens, allowing the flavivirus to replicate and disseminate in mosquitoes. Therefore, said Guirakhoo, \"a vaccine that can induce effective antibodies to NS1 and disable its function has the potential to reduce growth and transmission of Zika virus in its mosquito vector.

Local transmission of Zika virus was reported in U.S. territories in 2016.\n\nWhat is added by this report?\nOverall, about 5 percent of fetuses and infants born to women with laboratory evidence of recent possible Zika virus infection in the U.S. territories had possible Zika-associated birth defects, the same as the percentage reported in the 50 U.S. states during 2016. Possible Zika-associated birth defects including brain abnormalities and/or microcephaly were reported following Zika virus infection during every trimester of pregnancy. Among completed pregnancies with positive nucleic acid tests confirming Zika virus infection identified in the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd trimesters, the percentages of fetuses or infants with possible Zika-associated birth defects was 8, 5, and 4 percent, respectively.\n\nWhat are the implications for public health practice?\nCurrent data suggest that Zika virus infection during any trimester of pregnancy might result in Zika-associated birth defects. Identification and follow-up of infants born to women with laboratory evidence of recent possible Zika virus infection during pregnancy can facilitate timely and appropriate clinical intervention services and assessment of future needs. Information about adherence to the recommended newborn testing and screening can improve monitoring and care of infants affected by Zika.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The risks of teratogenic effects when Zika virus infection occurs during any phase of pregnancy are real.

Nat Commun. 2017 Jun 7;8:15743. doi: 10.1038/ncomms15743\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nAbstract\n--------\nZika virus (ZIKV) is an emerging pathogen causally associated with serious sequelae in fetuses, inducing fetal microcephaly and other neurodevelopment defects. ZIKV is primarily transmitted by mosquitoes, but can persist in human semen and sperm, and sexual transmission has been documented. Moreover, exposure of type-I interferon knockout mice to ZIKV results in severe damage to the testes, epididymis, and sperm. Candidate ZIKV vaccines have shown protective efficacy in preclinical studies carried out in animal models, and several vaccines have entered clinical trials. Here, we report that administration of a synthetic DNA vaccine encoding ZIKV pre-membrane and envelope (prME) completely protects mice against ZIKV-associated damage to the testes and sperm and prevents viral persistence in the testes following challenge with a contemporary strain of ZIKV. These data suggest that DNA vaccination merits further investigation as a potential means to reduce ZIKV persistence in the male reproductive tract.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n[It will be interesting to see the results when the vaccine has completed tests in non-human primates. - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[5] Dual Zika and chikungunya virus transmission\nDate: Thu 1 Jun 2017\nSource: PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases [edited]\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0005654 [edited]\n<http://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0005654\n\n\nref: G\u00f6ertz GP, Vogels CBF, Geertsema C, et al: Mosquito co-infection with Zika and chikungunya virus allows simultaneous transmission without affecting vector competence of _Aedes aegypti_. PLoS Negl Trop Dis. 2017 Jun 1;11(6):e0005654. doi: 10.1371/journal.pntd.0005654\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nAbstract\n--------\nBackground. Zika virus (ZIKV) and chikungunya virus (CHIKV) are highly pathogenic arthropod-borne viruses that are currently a serious health burden in the Americas, and elsewhere in the world. ZIKV and CHIKV co-circulate in the same geographical regions and are mainly transmitted by _Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes. There is a growing number of case reports of ZIKV and CHIKV co-infections in humans, but it is uncertain whether co-infection occurs via single or multiple mosquito bites. Here we investigate the potential of _Ae. aegypti_ mosquitoes to transmit both ZIKV and CHIKV in one bite, and we assess the consequences of co-infection on vector competence\n\nMethodology/principal findings. 1st, growth curves indicated that co-infection with CHIKV negatively affects ZIKV production in mammalian, but not in mosquito cells. Next, _Ae. aegypti_ mosquitoes were infected with ZIKV, CHIKV, or co-infected via an infectious blood meal or intrathoracic injections. Infection and transmission rates, as well as viral titers of positive mosquitoes, were determined at 14 days after blood meal or 7 days after injection. Saliva and bodies of (co-)infected mosquitoes were scored concurrently for the presence of ZIKV and/or CHIKV using a dual-colour immunofluorescence assay. The results show that orally exposed _Ae. aegypti_ mosquitoes are highly competent, with transmission rates of up to 73 percent for ZIKV, 21 percent for CHIKV, and 12 percent of mosquitoes transmitting both viruses in one bite. However, simultaneous oral exposure to both viruses did not change infection and transmission rates compared to exposure to a single virus. Intrathoracic injections indicate that the selected strain of _Ae. aegypti_ has a strong salivary gland barrier for CHIKV, but a less profound barrier for ZIKV.\n\nConclusions/significance. This study shows that _Ae. aegypti_ can transmit both ZIKV and CHIKV via a single bite. Furthermore, co-infection of ZIKV and CHIKV does not influence the vector competence of _Ae. aegypti_.\n\nAuthor summary\n--------------\nZika virus (ZIKV) and chikungunya virus (CHIKV) are highly pathogenic arthropod-borne viruses that present a serious health threat to humans. Since 2015, both viruses circulate in the same geographical regions of the Americas and are predominantly transmitted by the yellow fever mosquito _Ae. aegypti_. There is a growing number of case reports of ZIKV and CHIKV co-infections in humans, but it is uncertain whether co-infection occurred via single or multiple mosquito bites. Therefore, we infected _Ae. aegypti_ mosquitoes via an infectious blood meal with ZIKV, CHIKV, or both and scored the saliva of (co-)infected mosquitoes 14 days post infection for the presence of ZIKV, CHIKV or both. _Ae. aegypti_ was competent for both viruses with transmission rates up to 73 percent (ZIKV) and 21 percent (CHIKV). A substantial proportion of mosquitoes became saliva-positive for both viruses (12 percent), suggesting that _Ae. aegypti_ can transmit both CHIKV and ZIKV via a single bite. Additionally, co-infections did not influence the infection or transmission rates of either ZIKV or CHIKV. Our results indicate that co-infection of CHIKV and ZIKV can lead to simultaneous transmission by the same mosquito in the field.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n[George Robertson (grobertson@path.org>) also sent in this report, and is thanked. - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[6] NS1 vaccine\nDate: Sun 4 Jun 2017\nSource: American Society for Microbiology [edited]\nhttps://www.asm.org/index.php/newsroom/item/6507-development-of-a-novel-vaccine-for-zika\n\n\nResearch presented by Farshad Guirakhoo, PhD, Chief Scientific Officer, GeoVax, Inc, at the ASM Microbe 2017 meeting showed a new Zika virus vaccine that gives 100 percent protection in mice. The vaccine is the 1st to be based on the Zika virus NS1 protein, and the 1st to show single-dose protection against Zika in an immunocompetent lethal mouse challenge model. Results of the study were presented on [4 Jun 2017] at the American Society for Microbiology (ASM) Microbe conference in New Orleans [1-5 Jun 2017].\n\nIn the presented study, outbred immunocompetent mice were exposed to a lethal challenge dose of Zika virus delivered directly into the brain. \"A single dose of GeoVax's NS1 vaccine candidate protected 100 percent of vaccinated animals,\" said Guirakhoo. In contrast, 80-90 percent of sham-immunized control animals died within 7-10 days.\n\nBecause the NS1 antigen is not presented on the surface of the virus, it was chosen as the target immunogen for the vaccine to avoid a potential risk of disease enhancement when vaccines are developed based on Zika virus envelope proteins. This antibody dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection phenomena has been shown between Zika virus and a related flavivirus, dengue, in both in vitro and in vivo studies.\n\nAn NS1-based vaccine could also limit or block transmission of Zika virus in its mosquito vector. The NS1 protein is abundantly produced by flaviviruses in infected hosts and is picked up together with the virus after the mosquito takes a blood meal from humans. The NS1 proteins interfere with the innate immune system of the mosquito, evolved to fight foreign pathogens, allowing the flavivirus to replicate and disseminate in mosquitoes.

Local transmission of Zika virus was reported in U.S. territories in 2016.\n\nWhat is added by this report?\nOverall, about 5 percent of fetuses and infants born to women with laboratory evidence of recent possible Zika virus infection in the U.S. territories had possible Zika-associated birth defects, the same as the percentage reported in the 50 U.S. states during 2016. Possible Zika-associated birth defects including brain abnormalities and/or microcephaly were reported following Zika virus infection during every trimester of pregnancy. Among completed pregnancies with positive nucleic acid tests confirming Zika virus infection identified in the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd trimesters, the percentages of fetuses or infants with possible Zika-associated birth defects was 8, 5, and 4 percent, respectively.\n\nWhat are the implications for public health practice?\nCurrent data suggest that Zika virus infection during any trimester of pregnancy might result in Zika-associated birth defects. Identification and follow-up of infants born to women with laboratory evidence of recent possible Zika virus infection during pregnancy can facilitate timely and appropriate clinical intervention services and assessment of future needs. Information about adherence to the recommended newborn testing and screening can improve monitoring and care of infants affected by Zika.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The risks of teratogenic effects when Zika virus infection occurs during any phase of pregnancy are real.

Nat Commun. 2017 Jun 7;8:15743. doi: 10.1038/ncomms15743\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nAbstract\n--------\nZika virus (ZIKV) is an emerging pathogen causally associated with serious sequelae in fetuses, inducing fetal microcephaly and other neurodevelopment defects. ZIKV is primarily transmitted by mosquitoes, but can persist in human semen and sperm, and sexual transmission has been documented. Moreover, exposure of type-I interferon knockout mice to ZIKV results in severe damage to the testes, epididymis, and sperm. Candidate ZIKV vaccines have shown protective efficacy in preclinical studies carried out in animal models, and several vaccines have entered clinical trials. Here, we report that administration of a synthetic DNA vaccine encoding ZIKV pre-membrane and envelope (prME) completely protects mice against ZIKV-associated damage to the testes and sperm and prevents viral persistence in the testes following challenge with a contemporary strain of ZIKV. These data suggest that DNA vaccination merits further investigation as a potential means to reduce ZIKV persistence in the male reproductive tract.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n[It will be interesting to see the results when the vaccine has completed tests in non-human primates. - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[5] Dual Zika and chikungunya virus transmission\nDate: Thu 1 Jun 2017\nSource: PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases [edited]\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0005654 [edited]\n<http://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0005654\n\n\nref: G\u00f6ertz GP, Vogels CBF, Geertsema C, et al: Mosquito co-infection with Zika and chikungunya virus allows simultaneous transmission without affecting vector competence of _Aedes aegypti_. PLoS Negl Trop Dis. 2017 Jun 1;11(6):e0005654. doi: 10.1371/journal.pntd.0005654\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nAbstract\n--------\nBackground. Zika virus (ZIKV) and chikungunya virus (CHIKV) are highly pathogenic arthropod-borne viruses that are currently a serious health burden in the Americas, and elsewhere in the world. ZIKV and CHIKV co-circulate in the same geographical regions and are mainly transmitted by _Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes. There is a growing number of case reports of ZIKV and CHIKV co-infections in humans, but it is uncertain whether co-infection occurs via single or multiple mosquito bites. Here we investigate the potential of _Ae. aegypti_ mosquitoes to transmit both ZIKV and CHIKV in one bite, and we assess the consequences of co-infection on vector competence\n\nMethodology/principal findings. 1st, growth curves indicated that co-infection with CHIKV negatively affects ZIKV production in mammalian, but not in mosquito cells. Next, _Ae. aegypti_ mosquitoes were infected with ZIKV, CHIKV, or co-infected via an infectious blood meal or intrathoracic injections. Infection and transmission rates, as well as viral titers of positive mosquitoes, were determined at 14 days after blood meal or 7 days after injection. Saliva and bodies of (co-)infected mosquitoes were scored concurrently for the presence of ZIKV and/or CHIKV using a dual-colour immunofluorescence assay. The results show that orally exposed _Ae. aegypti_ mosquitoes are highly competent, with transmission rates of up to 73 percent for ZIKV, 21 percent for CHIKV, and 12 percent of mosquitoes transmitting both viruses in one bite. However, simultaneous oral exposure to both viruses did not change infection and transmission rates compared to exposure to a single virus. Intrathoracic injections indicate that the selected strain of _Ae. aegypti_ has a strong salivary gland barrier for CHIKV, but a less profound barrier for ZIKV.\n\nConclusions/significance. This study shows that _Ae. aegypti_ can transmit both ZIKV and CHIKV via a single bite. Furthermore, co-infection of ZIKV and CHIKV does not influence the vector competence of _Ae. aegypti_.\n\nAuthor summary\n--------------\nZika virus (ZIKV) and chikungunya virus (CHIKV) are highly pathogenic arthropod-borne viruses that present a serious health threat to humans. Since 2015, both viruses circulate in the same geographical regions of the Americas and are predominantly transmitted by the yellow fever mosquito _Ae. aegypti_. There is a growing number of case reports of ZIKV and CHIKV co-infections in humans, but it is uncertain whether co-infection occurred via single or multiple mosquito bites. Therefore, we infected _Ae. aegypti_ mosquitoes via an infectious blood meal with ZIKV, CHIKV, or both and scored the saliva of (co-)infected mosquitoes 14 days post infection for the presence of ZIKV, CHIKV or both. _Ae. aegypti_ was competent for both viruses with transmission rates up to 73 percent (ZIKV) and 21 percent (CHIKV). A substantial proportion of mosquitoes became saliva-positive for both viruses (12 percent), suggesting that _Ae. aegypti_ can transmit both CHIKV and ZIKV via a single bite. Additionally, co-infections did not influence the infection or transmission rates of either ZIKV or CHIKV. Our results indicate that co-infection of CHIKV and ZIKV can lead to simultaneous transmission by the same mosquito in the field.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n[George Robertson (grobertson@path.org>) also sent in this report, and is thanked. - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[6] NS1 vaccine\nDate: Sun 4 Jun 2017\nSource: American Society for Microbiology [edited]\nhttps://www.asm.org/index.php/newsroom/item/6507-development-of-a-novel-vaccine-for-zika\n\n\nResearch presented by Farshad Guirakhoo, PhD, Chief Scientific Officer, GeoVax, Inc, at the ASM Microbe 2017 meeting showed a new Zika virus vaccine that gives 100 percent protection in mice. The vaccine is the 1st to be based on the Zika virus NS1 protein, and the 1st to show single-dose protection against Zika in an immunocompetent lethal mouse challenge model. Results of the study were presented on [4 Jun 2017] at the American Society for Microbiology (ASM) Microbe conference in New Orleans [1-5 Jun 2017].\n\nIn the presented study, outbred immunocompetent mice were exposed to a lethal challenge dose of Zika virus delivered directly into the brain. \"A single dose of GeoVax's NS1 vaccine candidate protected 100 percent of vaccinated animals,\" said Guirakhoo. In contrast, 80-90 percent of sham-immunized control animals died within 7-10 days.\n\nBecause the NS1 antigen is not presented on the surface of the virus, it was chosen as the target immunogen for the vaccine to avoid a potential risk of disease enhancement when vaccines are developed based on Zika virus envelope proteins. This antibody dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection phenomena has been shown between Zika virus and a related flavivirus, dengue, in both in vitro and in vivo studies.\n\nAn NS1-based vaccine could also limit or block transmission of Zika virus in its mosquito vector. The NS1 protein is abundantly produced by flaviviruses in infected hosts and is picked up together with the virus after the mosquito takes a blood meal from humans. The NS1 proteins interfere with the innate immune system of the mosquito, evolved to fight foreign pathogens, allowing the flavivirus to replicate and disseminate in mosquitoes.

Local transmission of Zika virus was reported in U.S. territories in 2016.\n\nWhat is added by this report?\nOverall, about 5 percent of fetuses and infants born to women with laboratory evidence of recent possible Zika virus infection in the U.S. territories had possible Zika-associated birth defects, the same as the percentage reported in the 50 U.S. states during 2016. Possible Zika-associated birth defects including brain abnormalities and/or microcephaly were reported following Zika virus infection during every trimester of pregnancy. Among completed pregnancies with positive nucleic acid tests confirming Zika virus infection identified in the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd trimesters, the percentages of fetuses or infants with possible Zika-associated birth defects was 8, 5, and 4 percent, respectively.\n\nWhat are the implications for public health practice?\nCurrent data suggest that Zika virus infection during any trimester of pregnancy might result in Zika-associated birth defects. Identification and follow-up of infants born to women with laboratory evidence of recent possible Zika virus infection during pregnancy can facilitate timely and appropriate clinical intervention services and assessment of future needs. Information about adherence to the recommended newborn testing and screening can improve monitoring and care of infants affected by Zika.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The risks of teratogenic effects when Zika virus infection occurs during any phase of pregnancy are real.

Nat Commun. 2017 Jun 7;8:15743. doi: 10.1038/ncomms15743\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nAbstract\n--------\nZika virus (ZIKV) is an emerging pathogen causally associated with serious sequelae in fetuses, inducing fetal microcephaly and other neurodevelopment defects. ZIKV is primarily transmitted by mosquitoes, but can persist in human semen and sperm, and sexual transmission has been documented. Moreover, exposure of type-I interferon knockout mice to ZIKV results in severe damage to the testes, epididymis, and sperm. Candidate ZIKV vaccines have shown protective efficacy in preclinical studies carried out in animal models, and several vaccines have entered clinical trials. Here, we report that administration of a synthetic DNA vaccine encoding ZIKV pre-membrane and envelope (prME) completely protects mice against ZIKV-associated damage to the testes and sperm and prevents viral persistence in the testes following challenge with a contemporary strain of ZIKV. These data suggest that DNA vaccination merits further investigation as a potential means to reduce ZIKV persistence in the male reproductive tract.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n[It will be interesting to see the results when the vaccine has completed tests in non-human primates. - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[5] Dual Zika and chikungunya virus transmission\nDate: Thu 1 Jun 2017\nSource: PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases [edited]\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0005654 [edited]\n<http://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0005654\n\n\nref: G\u00f6ertz GP, Vogels CBF, Geertsema C, et al: Mosquito co-infection with Zika and chikungunya virus allows simultaneous transmission without affecting vector competence of _Aedes aegypti_. PLoS Negl Trop Dis. 2017 Jun 1;11(6):e0005654. doi: 10.1371/journal.pntd.0005654\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nAbstract\n--------\nBackground. Zika virus (ZIKV) and chikungunya virus (CHIKV) are highly pathogenic arthropod-borne viruses that are currently a serious health burden in the Americas, and elsewhere in the world. ZIKV and CHIKV co-circulate in the same geographical regions and are mainly transmitted by _Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes. There is a growing number of case reports of ZIKV and CHIKV co-infections in humans, but it is uncertain whether co-infection occurs via single or multiple mosquito bites. Here we investigate the potential of _Ae. aegypti_ mosquitoes to transmit both ZIKV and CHIKV in one bite, and we assess the consequences of co-infection on vector competence\n\nMethodology/principal findings. 1st, growth curves indicated that co-infection with CHIKV negatively affects ZIKV production in mammalian, but not in mosquito cells. Next, _Ae. aegypti_ mosquitoes were infected with ZIKV, CHIKV, or co-infected via an infectious blood meal or intrathoracic injections. Infection and transmission rates, as well as viral titers of positive mosquitoes, were determined at 14 days after blood meal or 7 days after injection. Saliva and bodies of (co-)infected mosquitoes were scored concurrently for the presence of ZIKV and/or CHIKV using a dual-colour immunofluorescence assay. The results show that orally exposed _Ae. aegypti_ mosquitoes are highly competent, with transmission rates of up to 73 percent for ZIKV, 21 percent for CHIKV, and 12 percent of mosquitoes transmitting both viruses in one bite. However, simultaneous oral exposure to both viruses did not change infection and transmission rates compared to exposure to a single virus. Intrathoracic injections indicate that the selected strain of _Ae. aegypti_ has a strong salivary gland barrier for CHIKV, but a less profound barrier for ZIKV.\n\nConclusions/significance. This study shows that _Ae. aegypti_ can transmit both ZIKV and CHIKV via a single bite. Furthermore, co-infection of ZIKV and CHIKV does not influence the vector competence of _Ae. aegypti_.\n\nAuthor summary\n--------------\nZika virus (ZIKV) and chikungunya virus (CHIKV) are highly pathogenic arthropod-borne viruses that present a serious health threat to humans. Since 2015, both viruses circulate in the same geographical regions of the Americas and are predominantly transmitted by the yellow fever mosquito _Ae. aegypti_. There is a growing number of case reports of ZIKV and CHIKV co-infections in humans, but it is uncertain whether co-infection occurred via single or multiple mosquito bites. Therefore, we infected _Ae. aegypti_ mosquitoes via an infectious blood meal with ZIKV, CHIKV, or both and scored the saliva of (co-)infected mosquitoes 14 days post infection for the presence of ZIKV, CHIKV or both. _Ae. aegypti_ was competent for both viruses with transmission rates up to 73 percent (ZIKV) and 21 percent (CHIKV). A substantial proportion of mosquitoes became saliva-positive for both viruses (12 percent), suggesting that _Ae. aegypti_ can transmit both CHIKV and ZIKV via a single bite. Additionally, co-infections did not influence the infection or transmission rates of either ZIKV or CHIKV. Our results indicate that co-infection of CHIKV and ZIKV can lead to simultaneous transmission by the same mosquito in the field.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n[George Robertson (grobertson@path.org>) also sent in this report, and is thanked. - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[6] NS1 vaccine\nDate: Sun 4 Jun 2017\nSource: American Society for Microbiology [edited]\nhttps://www.asm.org/index.php/newsroom/item/6507-development-of-a-novel-vaccine-for-zika\n\n\nResearch presented by Farshad Guirakhoo, PhD, Chief Scientific Officer, GeoVax, Inc, at the ASM Microbe 2017 meeting showed a new Zika virus vaccine that gives 100 percent protection in mice. The vaccine is the 1st to be based on the Zika virus NS1 protein, and the 1st to show single-dose protection against Zika in an immunocompetent lethal mouse challenge model. Results of the study were presented on [4 Jun 2017] at the American Society for Microbiology (ASM) Microbe conference in New Orleans [1-5 Jun 2017].\n\nIn the presented study, outbred immunocompetent mice were exposed to a lethal challenge dose of Zika virus delivered directly into the brain. \"A single dose of GeoVax's NS1 vaccine candidate protected 100 percent of vaccinated animals,\" said Guirakhoo. In contrast, 80-90 percent of sham-immunized control animals died within 7-10 days.\n\nBecause the NS1 antigen is not presented on the surface of the virus, it was chosen as the target immunogen for the vaccine to avoid a potential risk of disease enhancement when vaccines are developed based on Zika virus envelope proteins. This antibody dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection phenomena has been shown between Zika virus and a related flavivirus, dengue, in both in vitro and in vivo studies.\n\nAn NS1-based vaccine could also limit or block transmission of Zika virus in its mosquito vector. The NS1 protein is abundantly produced by flaviviruses in infected hosts and is picked up together with the virus after the mosquito takes a blood meal from humans. The NS1 proteins interfere with the innate immune system of the mosquito, evolved to fight foreign pathogens, allowing the flavivirus to replicate and disseminate in mosquitoes.

Local transmission of Zika virus was reported in U.S. territories in 2016.\n\nWhat is added by this report?\nOverall, about 5 percent of fetuses and infants born to women with laboratory evidence of recent possible Zika virus infection in the U.S. territories had possible Zika-associated birth defects, the same as the percentage reported in the 50 U.S. states during 2016. Possible Zika-associated birth defects including brain abnormalities and/or microcephaly were reported following Zika virus infection during every trimester of pregnancy. Among completed pregnancies with positive nucleic acid tests confirming Zika virus infection identified in the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd trimesters, the percentages of fetuses or infants with possible Zika-associated birth defects was 8, 5, and 4 percent, respectively.\n\nWhat are the implications for public health practice?\nCurrent data suggest that Zika virus infection during any trimester of pregnancy might result in Zika-associated birth defects. Identification and follow-up of infants born to women with laboratory evidence of recent possible Zika virus infection during pregnancy can facilitate timely and appropriate clinical intervention services and assessment of future needs. Information about adherence to the recommended newborn testing and screening can improve monitoring and care of infants affected by Zika.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The risks of teratogenic effects when Zika virus infection occurs during any phase of pregnancy are real.

Nat Commun. 2017 Jun 7;8:15743. doi: 10.1038/ncomms15743\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nAbstract\n--------\nZika virus (ZIKV) is an emerging pathogen causally associated with serious sequelae in fetuses, inducing fetal microcephaly and other neurodevelopment defects. ZIKV is primarily transmitted by mosquitoes, but can persist in human semen and sperm, and sexual transmission has been documented. Moreover, exposure of type-I interferon knockout mice to ZIKV results in severe damage to the testes, epididymis, and sperm. Candidate ZIKV vaccines have shown protective efficacy in preclinical studies carried out in animal models, and several vaccines have entered clinical trials. Here, we report that administration of a synthetic DNA vaccine encoding ZIKV pre-membrane and envelope (prME) completely protects mice against ZIKV-associated damage to the testes and sperm and prevents viral persistence in the testes following challenge with a contemporary strain of ZIKV. These data suggest that DNA vaccination merits further investigation as a potential means to reduce ZIKV persistence in the male reproductive tract.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n[It will be interesting to see the results when the vaccine has completed tests in non-human primates. - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[5] Dual Zika and chikungunya virus transmission\nDate: Thu 1 Jun 2017\nSource: PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases [edited]\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0005654 [edited]\n<http://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0005654\n\n\nref: G\u00f6ertz GP, Vogels CBF, Geertsema C, et al: Mosquito co-infection with Zika and chikungunya virus allows simultaneous transmission without affecting vector competence of _Aedes aegypti_. PLoS Negl Trop Dis. 2017 Jun 1;11(6):e0005654. doi: 10.1371/journal.pntd.0005654\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nAbstract\n--------\nBackground. Zika virus (ZIKV) and chikungunya virus (CHIKV) are highly pathogenic arthropod-borne viruses that are currently a serious health burden in the Americas, and elsewhere in the world. ZIKV and CHIKV co-circulate in the same geographical regions and are mainly transmitted by _Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes. There is a growing number of case reports of ZIKV and CHIKV co-infections in humans, but it is uncertain whether co-infection occurs via single or multiple mosquito bites. Here we investigate the potential of _Ae. aegypti_ mosquitoes to transmit both ZIKV and CHIKV in one bite, and we assess the consequences of co-infection on vector competence\n\nMethodology/principal findings. 1st, growth curves indicated that co-infection with CHIKV negatively affects ZIKV production in mammalian, but not in mosquito cells. Next, _Ae. aegypti_ mosquitoes were infected with ZIKV, CHIKV, or co-infected via an infectious blood meal or intrathoracic injections. Infection and transmission rates, as well as viral titers of positive mosquitoes, were determined at 14 days after blood meal or 7 days after injection. Saliva and bodies of (co-)infected mosquitoes were scored concurrently for the presence of ZIKV and/or CHIKV using a dual-colour immunofluorescence assay. The results show that orally exposed _Ae. aegypti_ mosquitoes are highly competent, with transmission rates of up to 73 percent for ZIKV, 21 percent for CHIKV, and 12 percent of mosquitoes transmitting both viruses in one bite. However, simultaneous oral exposure to both viruses did not change infection and transmission rates compared to exposure to a single virus. Intrathoracic injections indicate that the selected strain of _Ae. aegypti_ has a strong salivary gland barrier for CHIKV, but a less profound barrier for ZIKV.\n\nConclusions/significance. This study shows that _Ae. aegypti_ can transmit both ZIKV and CHIKV via a single bite. Furthermore, co-infection of ZIKV and CHIKV does not influence the vector competence of _Ae. aegypti_.\n\nAuthor summary\n--------------\nZika virus (ZIKV) and chikungunya virus (CHIKV) are highly pathogenic arthropod-borne viruses that present a serious health threat to humans. Since 2015, both viruses circulate in the same geographical regions of the Americas and are predominantly transmitted by the yellow fever mosquito _Ae. aegypti_. There is a growing number of case reports of ZIKV and CHIKV co-infections in humans, but it is uncertain whether co-infection occurred via single or multiple mosquito bites. Therefore, we infected _Ae. aegypti_ mosquitoes via an infectious blood meal with ZIKV, CHIKV, or both and scored the saliva of (co-)infected mosquitoes 14 days post infection for the presence of ZIKV, CHIKV or both. _Ae. aegypti_ was competent for both viruses with transmission rates up to 73 percent (ZIKV) and 21 percent (CHIKV). A substantial proportion of mosquitoes became saliva-positive for both viruses (12 percent), suggesting that _Ae. aegypti_ can transmit both CHIKV and ZIKV via a single bite. Additionally, co-infections did not influence the infection or transmission rates of either ZIKV or CHIKV. Our results indicate that co-infection of CHIKV and ZIKV can lead to simultaneous transmission by the same mosquito in the field.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n[George Robertson (grobertson@path.org>) also sent in this report, and is thanked. - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[6] NS1 vaccine\nDate: Sun 4 Jun 2017\nSource: American Society for Microbiology [edited]\nhttps://www.asm.org/index.php/newsroom/item/6507-development-of-a-novel-vaccine-for-zika\n\n\nResearch presented by Farshad Guirakhoo, PhD, Chief Scientific Officer, GeoVax, Inc, at the ASM Microbe 2017 meeting showed a new Zika virus vaccine that gives 100 percent protection in mice. The vaccine is the 1st to be based on the Zika virus NS1 protein, and the 1st to show single-dose protection against Zika in an immunocompetent lethal mouse challenge model. Results of the study were presented on [4 Jun 2017] at the American Society for Microbiology (ASM) Microbe conference in New Orleans [1-5 Jun 2017].\n\nIn the presented study, outbred immunocompetent mice were exposed to a lethal challenge dose of Zika virus delivered directly into the brain. \"A single dose of GeoVax's NS1 vaccine candidate protected 100 percent of vaccinated animals,\" said Guirakhoo. In contrast, 80-90 percent of sham-immunized control animals died within 7-10 days.\n\nBecause the NS1 antigen is not presented on the surface of the virus, it was chosen as the target immunogen for the vaccine to avoid a potential risk of disease enhancement when vaccines are developed based on Zika virus envelope proteins. This antibody dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection phenomena has been shown between Zika virus and a related flavivirus, dengue, in both in vitro and in vivo studies.\n\nAn NS1-based vaccine could also limit or block transmission of Zika virus in its mosquito vector. The NS1 protein is abundantly produced by flaviviruses in infected hosts and is picked up together with the virus after the mosquito takes a blood meal from humans. The NS1 proteins interfere with the innate immune system of the mosquito, evolved to fight foreign pathogens, allowing the flavivirus to replicate and disseminate in mosquitoes.

Local transmission of Zika virus was reported in U.S. territories in 2016.\n\nWhat is added by this report?\nOverall, about 5 percent of fetuses and infants born to women with laboratory evidence of recent possible Zika virus infection in the U.S. territories had possible Zika-associated birth defects, the same as the percentage reported in the 50 U.S. states during 2016. Possible Zika-associated birth defects including brain abnormalities and/or microcephaly were reported following Zika virus infection during every trimester of pregnancy. Among completed pregnancies with positive nucleic acid tests confirming Zika virus infection identified in the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd trimesters, the percentages of fetuses or infants with possible Zika-associated birth defects was 8, 5, and 4 percent, respectively.\n\nWhat are the implications for public health practice?\nCurrent data suggest that Zika virus infection during any trimester of pregnancy might result in Zika-associated birth defects. Identification and follow-up of infants born to women with laboratory evidence of recent possible Zika virus infection during pregnancy can facilitate timely and appropriate clinical intervention services and assessment of future needs. Information about adherence to the recommended newborn testing and screening can improve monitoring and care of infants affected by Zika.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The risks of teratogenic effects when Zika virus infection occurs during any phase of pregnancy are real.

Nat Commun. 2017 Jun 7;8:15743. doi: 10.1038/ncomms15743\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nAbstract\n--------\nZika virus (ZIKV) is an emerging pathogen causally associated with serious sequelae in fetuses, inducing fetal microcephaly and other neurodevelopment defects. ZIKV is primarily transmitted by mosquitoes, but can persist in human semen and sperm, and sexual transmission has been documented. Moreover, exposure of type-I interferon knockout mice to ZIKV results in severe damage to the testes, epididymis, and sperm. Candidate ZIKV vaccines have shown protective efficacy in preclinical studies carried out in animal models, and several vaccines have entered clinical trials. Here, we report that administration of a synthetic DNA vaccine encoding ZIKV pre-membrane and envelope (prME) completely protects mice against ZIKV-associated damage to the testes and sperm and prevents viral persistence in the testes following challenge with a contemporary strain of ZIKV. These data suggest that DNA vaccination merits further investigation as a potential means to reduce ZIKV persistence in the male reproductive tract.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n[It will be interesting to see the results when the vaccine has completed tests in non-human primates. - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[5] Dual Zika and chikungunya virus transmission\nDate: Thu 1 Jun 2017\nSource: PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases [edited]\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0005654 [edited]\n<http://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0005654\n\n\nref: G\u00f6ertz GP, Vogels CBF, Geertsema C, et al: Mosquito co-infection with Zika and chikungunya virus allows simultaneous transmission without affecting vector competence of _Aedes aegypti_. PLoS Negl Trop Dis. 2017 Jun 1;11(6):e0005654. doi: 10.1371/journal.pntd.0005654\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nAbstract\n--------\nBackground. Zika virus (ZIKV) and chikungunya virus (CHIKV) are highly pathogenic arthropod-borne viruses that are currently a serious health burden in the Americas, and elsewhere in the world. ZIKV and CHIKV co-circulate in the same geographical regions and are mainly transmitted by _Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes. There is a growing number of case reports of ZIKV and CHIKV co-infections in humans, but it is uncertain whether co-infection occurs via single or multiple mosquito bites. Here we investigate the potential of _Ae. aegypti_ mosquitoes to transmit both ZIKV and CHIKV in one bite, and we assess the consequences of co-infection on vector competence\n\nMethodology/principal findings. 1st, growth curves indicated that co-infection with CHIKV negatively affects ZIKV production in mammalian, but not in mosquito cells. Next, _Ae. aegypti_ mosquitoes were infected with ZIKV, CHIKV, or co-infected via an infectious blood meal or intrathoracic injections. Infection and transmission rates, as well as viral titers of positive mosquitoes, were determined at 14 days after blood meal or 7 days after injection. Saliva and bodies of (co-)infected mosquitoes were scored concurrently for the presence of ZIKV and/or CHIKV using a dual-colour immunofluorescence assay. The results show that orally exposed _Ae. aegypti_ mosquitoes are highly competent, with transmission rates of up to 73 percent for ZIKV, 21 percent for CHIKV, and 12 percent of mosquitoes transmitting both viruses in one bite. However, simultaneous oral exposure to both viruses did not change infection and transmission rates compared to exposure to a single virus. Intrathoracic injections indicate that the selected strain of _Ae. aegypti_ has a strong salivary gland barrier for CHIKV, but a less profound barrier for ZIKV.\n\nConclusions/significance. This study shows that _Ae. aegypti_ can transmit both ZIKV and CHIKV via a single bite. Furthermore, co-infection of ZIKV and CHIKV does not influence the vector competence of _Ae. aegypti_.\n\nAuthor summary\n--------------\nZika virus (ZIKV) and chikungunya virus (CHIKV) are highly pathogenic arthropod-borne viruses that present a serious health threat to humans. Since 2015, both viruses circulate in the same geographical regions of the Americas and are predominantly transmitted by the yellow fever mosquito _Ae. aegypti_. There is a growing number of case reports of ZIKV and CHIKV co-infections in humans, but it is uncertain whether co-infection occurred via single or multiple mosquito bites. Therefore, we infected _Ae. aegypti_ mosquitoes via an infectious blood meal with ZIKV, CHIKV, or both and scored the saliva of (co-)infected mosquitoes 14 days post infection for the presence of ZIKV, CHIKV or both. _Ae. aegypti_ was competent for both viruses with transmission rates up to 73 percent (ZIKV) and 21 percent (CHIKV). A substantial proportion of mosquitoes became saliva-positive for both viruses (12 percent), suggesting that _Ae. aegypti_ can transmit both CHIKV and ZIKV via a single bite. Additionally, co-infections did not influence the infection or transmission rates of either ZIKV or CHIKV. Our results indicate that co-infection of CHIKV and ZIKV can lead to simultaneous transmission by the same mosquito in the field.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n[George Robertson (grobertson@path.org>) also sent in this report, and is thanked. - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[6] NS1 vaccine\nDate: Sun 4 Jun 2017\nSource: American Society for Microbiology [edited]\nhttps://www.asm.org/index.php/newsroom/item/6507-development-of-a-novel-vaccine-for-zika\n\n\nResearch presented by Farshad Guirakhoo, PhD, Chief Scientific Officer, GeoVax, Inc, at the ASM Microbe 2017 meeting showed a new Zika virus vaccine that gives 100 percent protection in mice. The vaccine is the 1st to be based on the Zika virus NS1 protein, and the 1st to show single-dose protection against Zika in an immunocompetent lethal mouse challenge model. Results of the study were presented on [4 Jun 2017] at the American Society for Microbiology (ASM) Microbe conference in New Orleans [1-5 Jun 2017].\n\nIn the presented study, outbred immunocompetent mice were exposed to a lethal challenge dose of Zika virus delivered directly into the brain. \"A single dose of GeoVax's NS1 vaccine candidate protected 100 percent of vaccinated animals,\" said Guirakhoo. In contrast, 80-90 percent of sham-immunized control animals died within 7-10 days.\n\nBecause the NS1 antigen is not presented on the surface of the virus, it was chosen as the target immunogen for the vaccine to avoid a potential risk of disease enhancement when vaccines are developed based on Zika virus envelope proteins. This antibody dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection phenomena has been shown between Zika virus and a related flavivirus, dengue, in both in vitro and in vivo studies.\n\nAn NS1-based vaccine could also limit or block transmission of Zika virus in its mosquito vector. The NS1 protein is abundantly produced by flaviviruses in infected hosts and is picked up together with the virus after the mosquito takes a blood meal from humans. The NS1 proteins interfere with the innate immune system of the mosquito, evolved to fight foreign pathogens, allowing the flavivirus to replicate and disseminate in mosquitoes.

Local transmission of Zika virus was reported in U.S. territories in 2016.\n\nWhat is added by this report?\nOverall, about 5 percent of fetuses and infants born to women with laboratory evidence of recent possible Zika virus infection in the U.S. territories had possible Zika-associated birth defects, the same as the percentage reported in the 50 U.S. states during 2016. Possible Zika-associated birth defects including brain abnormalities and/or microcephaly were reported following Zika virus infection during every trimester of pregnancy. Among completed pregnancies with positive nucleic acid tests confirming Zika virus infection identified in the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd trimesters, the percentages of fetuses or infants with possible Zika-associated birth defects was 8, 5, and 4 percent, respectively.\n\nWhat are the implications for public health practice?\nCurrent data suggest that Zika virus infection during any trimester of pregnancy might result in Zika-associated birth defects. Identification and follow-up of infants born to women with laboratory evidence of recent possible Zika virus infection during pregnancy can facilitate timely and appropriate clinical intervention services and assessment of future needs. Information about adherence to the recommended newborn testing and screening can improve monitoring and care of infants affected by Zika.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The risks of teratogenic effects when Zika virus infection occurs during any phase of pregnancy are real.

Nat Commun. 2017 Jun 7;8:15743. doi: 10.1038/ncomms15743\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nAbstract\n--------\nZika virus (ZIKV) is an emerging pathogen causally associated with serious sequelae in fetuses, inducing fetal microcephaly and other neurodevelopment defects. ZIKV is primarily transmitted by mosquitoes, but can persist in human semen and sperm, and sexual transmission has been documented. Moreover, exposure of type-I interferon knockout mice to ZIKV results in severe damage to the testes, epididymis, and sperm. Candidate ZIKV vaccines have shown protective efficacy in preclinical studies carried out in animal models, and several vaccines have entered clinical trials. Here, we report that administration of a synthetic DNA vaccine encoding ZIKV pre-membrane and envelope (prME) completely protects mice against ZIKV-associated damage to the testes and sperm and prevents viral persistence in the testes following challenge with a contemporary strain of ZIKV. These data suggest that DNA vaccination merits further investigation as a potential means to reduce ZIKV persistence in the male reproductive tract.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n[It will be interesting to see the results when the vaccine has completed tests in non-human primates. - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[5] Dual Zika and chikungunya virus transmission\nDate: Thu 1 Jun 2017\nSource: PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases [edited]\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0005654 [edited]\n<http://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0005654\n\n\nref: G\u00f6ertz GP, Vogels CBF, Geertsema C, et al: Mosquito co-infection with Zika and chikungunya virus allows simultaneous transmission without affecting vector competence of _Aedes aegypti_. PLoS Negl Trop Dis. 2017 Jun 1;11(6):e0005654. doi: 10.1371/journal.pntd.0005654\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nAbstract\n--------\nBackground. Zika virus (ZIKV) and chikungunya virus (CHIKV) are highly pathogenic arthropod-borne viruses that are currently a serious health burden in the Americas, and elsewhere in the world. ZIKV and CHIKV co-circulate in the same geographical regions and are mainly transmitted by _Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes. There is a growing number of case reports of ZIKV and CHIKV co-infections in humans, but it is uncertain whether co-infection occurs via single or multiple mosquito bites. Here we investigate the potential of _Ae. aegypti_ mosquitoes to transmit both ZIKV and CHIKV in one bite, and we assess the consequences of co-infection on vector competence\n\nMethodology/principal findings. 1st, growth curves indicated that co-infection with CHIKV negatively affects ZIKV production in mammalian, but not in mosquito cells. Next, _Ae. aegypti_ mosquitoes were infected with ZIKV, CHIKV, or co-infected via an infectious blood meal or intrathoracic injections. Infection and transmission rates, as well as viral titers of positive mosquitoes, were determined at 14 days after blood meal or 7 days after injection. Saliva and bodies of (co-)infected mosquitoes were scored concurrently for the presence of ZIKV and/or CHIKV using a dual-colour immunofluorescence assay. The results show that orally exposed _Ae. aegypti_ mosquitoes are highly competent, with transmission rates of up to 73 percent for ZIKV, 21 percent for CHIKV, and 12 percent of mosquitoes transmitting both viruses in one bite. However, simultaneous oral exposure to both viruses did not change infection and transmission rates compared to exposure to a single virus. Intrathoracic injections indicate that the selected strain of _Ae. aegypti_ has a strong salivary gland barrier for CHIKV, but a less profound barrier for ZIKV.\n\nConclusions/significance. This study shows that _Ae. aegypti_ can transmit both ZIKV and CHIKV via a single bite. Furthermore, co-infection of ZIKV and CHIKV does not influence the vector competence of _Ae. aegypti_.\n\nAuthor summary\n--------------\nZika virus (ZIKV) and chikungunya virus (CHIKV) are highly pathogenic arthropod-borne viruses that present a serious health threat to humans. Since 2015, both viruses circulate in the same geographical regions of the Americas and are predominantly transmitted by the yellow fever mosquito _Ae. aegypti_. There is a growing number of case reports of ZIKV and CHIKV co-infections in humans, but it is uncertain whether co-infection occurred via single or multiple mosquito bites. Therefore, we infected _Ae. aegypti_ mosquitoes via an infectious blood meal with ZIKV, CHIKV, or both and scored the saliva of (co-)infected mosquitoes 14 days post infection for the presence of ZIKV, CHIKV or both. _Ae. aegypti_ was competent for both viruses with transmission rates up to 73 percent (ZIKV) and 21 percent (CHIKV). A substantial proportion of mosquitoes became saliva-positive for both viruses (12 percent), suggesting that _Ae. aegypti_ can transmit both CHIKV and ZIKV via a single bite. Additionally, co-infections did not influence the infection or transmission rates of either ZIKV or CHIKV. Our results indicate that co-infection of CHIKV and ZIKV can lead to simultaneous transmission by the same mosquito in the field.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n[George Robertson (grobertson@path.org>) also sent in this report, and is thanked. - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[6] NS1 vaccine\nDate: Sun 4 Jun 2017\nSource: American Society for Microbiology [edited]\nhttps://www.asm.org/index.php/newsroom/item/6507-development-of-a-novel-vaccine-for-zika\n\n\nResearch presented by Farshad Guirakhoo, PhD, Chief Scientific Officer, GeoVax, Inc, at the ASM Microbe 2017 meeting showed a new Zika virus vaccine that gives 100 percent protection in mice. The vaccine is the 1st to be based on the Zika virus NS1 protein, and the 1st to show single-dose protection against Zika in an immunocompetent lethal mouse challenge model. Results of the study were presented on [4 Jun 2017] at the American Society for Microbiology (ASM) Microbe conference in New Orleans [1-5 Jun 2017].\n\nIn the presented study, outbred immunocompetent mice were exposed to a lethal challenge dose of Zika virus delivered directly into the brain. \"A single dose of GeoVax's NS1 vaccine candidate protected 100 percent of vaccinated animals,\" said Guirakhoo. In contrast, 80-90 percent of sham-immunized control animals died within 7-10 days.\n\nBecause the NS1 antigen is not presented on the surface of the virus, it was chosen as the target immunogen for the vaccine to avoid a potential risk of disease enhancement when vaccines are developed based on Zika virus envelope proteins. This antibody dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection phenomena has been shown between Zika virus and a related flavivirus, dengue, in both in vitro and in vivo studies.\n\nAn NS1-based vaccine could also limit or block transmission of Zika virus in its mosquito vector. The NS1 protein is abundantly produced by flaviviruses in infected hosts and is picked up together with the virus after the mosquito takes a blood meal from humans. The NS1 proteins interfere with the innate immune system of the mosquito, evolved to fight foreign pathogens, allowing the flavivirus to replicate and disseminate in mosquitoes.

Local transmission of Zika virus was reported in U.S. territories in 2016.\n\nWhat is added by this report?\nOverall, about 5 percent of fetuses and infants born to women with laboratory evidence of recent possible Zika virus infection in the U.S. territories had possible Zika-associated birth defects, the same as the percentage reported in the 50 U.S. states during 2016. Possible Zika-associated birth defects including brain abnormalities and/or microcephaly were reported following Zika virus infection during every trimester of pregnancy. Among completed pregnancies with positive nucleic acid tests confirming Zika virus infection identified in the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd trimesters, the percentages of fetuses or infants with possible Zika-associated birth defects was 8, 5, and 4 percent, respectively.\n\nWhat are the implications for public health practice?\nCurrent data suggest that Zika virus infection during any trimester of pregnancy might result in Zika-associated birth defects. Identification and follow-up of infants born to women with laboratory evidence of recent possible Zika virus infection during pregnancy can facilitate timely and appropriate clinical intervention services and assessment of future needs. Information about adherence to the recommended newborn testing and screening can improve monitoring and care of infants affected by Zika.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The risks of teratogenic effects when Zika virus infection occurs during any phase of pregnancy are real.

Nat Commun. 2017 Jun 7;8:15743. doi: 10.1038/ncomms15743\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nAbstract\n--------\nZika virus (ZIKV) is an emerging pathogen causally associated with serious sequelae in fetuses, inducing fetal microcephaly and other neurodevelopment defects. ZIKV is primarily transmitted by mosquitoes, but can persist in human semen and sperm, and sexual transmission has been documented. Moreover, exposure of type-I interferon knockout mice to ZIKV results in severe damage to the testes, epididymis, and sperm. Candidate ZIKV vaccines have shown protective efficacy in preclinical studies carried out in animal models, and several vaccines have entered clinical trials. Here, we report that administration of a synthetic DNA vaccine encoding ZIKV pre-membrane and envelope (prME) completely protects mice against ZIKV-associated damage to the testes and sperm and prevents viral persistence in the testes following challenge with a contemporary strain of ZIKV. These data suggest that DNA vaccination merits further investigation as a potential means to reduce ZIKV persistence in the male reproductive tract.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n[It will be interesting to see the results when the vaccine has completed tests in non-human primates. - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[5] Dual Zika and chikungunya virus transmission\nDate: Thu 1 Jun 2017\nSource: PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases [edited]\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0005654 [edited]\n<http://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0005654\n\n\nref: G\u00f6ertz GP, Vogels CBF, Geertsema C, et al: Mosquito co-infection with Zika and chikungunya virus allows simultaneous transmission without affecting vector competence of _Aedes aegypti_. PLoS Negl Trop Dis. 2017 Jun 1;11(6):e0005654. doi: 10.1371/journal.pntd.0005654\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nAbstract\n--------\nBackground. Zika virus (ZIKV) and chikungunya virus (CHIKV) are highly pathogenic arthropod-borne viruses that are currently a serious health burden in the Americas, and elsewhere in the world. ZIKV and CHIKV co-circulate in the same geographical regions and are mainly transmitted by _Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes. There is a growing number of case reports of ZIKV and CHIKV co-infections in humans, but it is uncertain whether co-infection occurs via single or multiple mosquito bites. Here we investigate the potential of _Ae. aegypti_ mosquitoes to transmit both ZIKV and CHIKV in one bite, and we assess the consequences of co-infection on vector competence\n\nMethodology/principal findings. 1st, growth curves indicated that co-infection with CHIKV negatively affects ZIKV production in mammalian, but not in mosquito cells. Next, _Ae. aegypti_ mosquitoes were infected with ZIKV, CHIKV, or co-infected via an infectious blood meal or intrathoracic injections. Infection and transmission rates, as well as viral titers of positive mosquitoes, were determined at 14 days after blood meal or 7 days after injection. Saliva and bodies of (co-)infected mosquitoes were scored concurrently for the presence of ZIKV and/or CHIKV using a dual-colour immunofluorescence assay. The results show that orally exposed _Ae. aegypti_ mosquitoes are highly competent, with transmission rates of up to 73 percent for ZIKV, 21 percent for CHIKV, and 12 percent of mosquitoes transmitting both viruses in one bite. However, simultaneous oral exposure to both viruses did not change infection and transmission rates compared to exposure to a single virus. Intrathoracic injections indicate that the selected strain of _Ae. aegypti_ has a strong salivary gland barrier for CHIKV, but a less profound barrier for ZIKV.\n\nConclusions/significance. This study shows that _Ae. aegypti_ can transmit both ZIKV and CHIKV via a single bite. Furthermore, co-infection of ZIKV and CHIKV does not influence the vector competence of _Ae. aegypti_.\n\nAuthor summary\n--------------\nZika virus (ZIKV) and chikungunya virus (CHIKV) are highly pathogenic arthropod-borne viruses that present a serious health threat to humans. Since 2015, both viruses circulate in the same geographical regions of the Americas and are predominantly transmitted by the yellow fever mosquito _Ae. aegypti_. There is a growing number of case reports of ZIKV and CHIKV co-infections in humans, but it is uncertain whether co-infection occurred via single or multiple mosquito bites. Therefore, we infected _Ae. aegypti_ mosquitoes via an infectious blood meal with ZIKV, CHIKV, or both and scored the saliva of (co-)infected mosquitoes 14 days post infection for the presence of ZIKV, CHIKV or both. _Ae. aegypti_ was competent for both viruses with transmission rates up to 73 percent (ZIKV) and 21 percent (CHIKV). A substantial proportion of mosquitoes became saliva-positive for both viruses (12 percent), suggesting that _Ae. aegypti_ can transmit both CHIKV and ZIKV via a single bite. Additionally, co-infections did not influence the infection or transmission rates of either ZIKV or CHIKV. Our results indicate that co-infection of CHIKV and ZIKV can lead to simultaneous transmission by the same mosquito in the field.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n[George Robertson (grobertson@path.org>) also sent in this report, and is thanked. - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[6] NS1 vaccine\nDate: Sun 4 Jun 2017\nSource: American Society for Microbiology [edited]\nhttps://www.asm.org/index.php/newsroom/item/6507-development-of-a-novel-vaccine-for-zika\n\n\nResearch presented by Farshad Guirakhoo, PhD, Chief Scientific Officer, GeoVax, Inc, at the ASM Microbe 2017 meeting showed a new Zika virus vaccine that gives 100 percent protection in mice. The vaccine is the 1st to be based on the Zika virus NS1 protein, and the 1st to show single-dose protection against Zika in an immunocompetent lethal mouse challenge model. Results of the study were presented on [4 Jun 2017] at the American Society for Microbiology (ASM) Microbe conference in New Orleans [1-5 Jun 2017].\n\nIn the presented study, outbred immunocompetent mice were exposed to a lethal challenge dose of Zika virus delivered directly into the brain. \"A single dose of GeoVax's NS1 vaccine candidate protected 100 percent of vaccinated animals,\" said Guirakhoo. In contrast, 80-90 percent of sham-immunized control animals died within 7-10 days.\n\nBecause the NS1 antigen is not presented on the surface of the virus, it was chosen as the target immunogen for the vaccine to avoid a potential risk of disease enhancement when vaccines are developed based on Zika virus envelope proteins. This antibody dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection phenomena has been shown between Zika virus and a related flavivirus, dengue, in both in vitro and in vivo studies.\n\nAn NS1-based vaccine could also limit or block transmission of Zika virus in its mosquito vector. The NS1 protein is abundantly produced by flaviviruses in infected hosts and is picked up together with the virus after the mosquito takes a blood meal from humans. The NS1 proteins interfere with the innate immune system of the mosquito, evolved to fight foreign pathogens, allowing the flavivirus to replicate and disseminate in mosquitoes. Therefore, said Guirakhoo, \"a vaccine that can induce effective antibodies to NS1 and disable its function has the potential to reduce growth and transmission of Zika virus in its mosquito vector. This could enhance vaccine effectiveness in endemic areas by blocking the virus transmission from infected individuals to other members of the community.\"\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[This approach to NS-1 antigen selection for a vaccine, to avoid the risk of ADE, is interesting. Presumably, the next steps will be to test the vaccine in non-human primates and in vector mosquitoes. - Mod.TY]\nSee Also\nZika virus (11): Americas, research, observations 20170604.5083731\nZika

Americas\n---------------------------------\nSince epidemiological week (EW) 44 of 2016 [29 Oct-4 Nov 2016], no additional countries or territories of the Americas have confirmed autochthonous, vector-borne transmission of Zika virus. To date, 48 countries and territories in the Americas have confirmed autochthonous, vector-borne transmission of Zika virus since 2015 (Figure 1). In addition, 5 countries in the Americas have reported sexually transmitted Zika cases.\n\nFigure 1 [map]. Countries and territories in the Americas with confirmed autochthonous (vector-borne) Zika virus cases, 2015 - 2017.\n[Footnote to map:\n(1) Anguilla; Antigua and Barbuda; Argentina; Aruba; the Bahamas; Barbados; Belize; Bolivia (Plurinational State of); Bonaire, Sint Eustatius, and Saba; Brazil; the British Virgin Islands; Cayman Islands; Colombia; Costa Rica; Cuba; Cura\u00e7ao; Dominica; the Dominican Republic; Ecuador; El Salvador; French Guiana; Grenada; Guadeloupe; Guatemala; Guyana; Haiti; Honduras; Jamaica; Martinique; Mexico; Montserrat; Nicaragua; Panama; Paraguay; Peru; Puerto Rico; Saint Barth\u00e9lemy; Saint Kitts and Nevis; Saint Lucia; Saint Martin; Saint Vincent and the Grenadines; Sint Maarten; Suriname; Trinidad and Tobago; Turks and Caicos Islands; the United States of America; the United States Virgin Islands; and Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of).\n(2) Argentina, Canada, Chile, Peru, and the United States of America.\n\nNorth America\nIn the United States of America, the Florida Department of Health reported isolated local transmission cases.\n\nIn Mexico, new cases continue to be reported, although they have been decreasing since EW 40 of 2016 [week ending 7 Oct 2016].\n\nCentral America\nThe number of reported cases in Central America continues to decrease, with a weekly average of 335 cases, 275 suspected, and 60 confirmed, in the last 4 weeks (EW 6 to EW 9 of 2017) [4 Feb-3 Mar 2017].\n\nIn Costa Rica a slight increase of suspected and confirmed cases was reported in EW 5 of 2017 [week ending 3 Feb 2017].\n\nIn Panama there was increasing trend of suspected and confirmed cases between EW 30 of 2016 and EW 1 of 2017 [23 Jul 2016-6 Jan 2017]. Although there was a decrease in EW 2 of 2017 [week ending 13 Jan 2017], suspected and confirmed cases continue to be reported at a weekly average of 229 suspected and confirmed cases in the last 4 weeks.\n\nCaribbean\nIn Aruba an increasing trend in suspected and confirmed cases was reported between EW 29 of 2016 and EW 4 of 2017 [16 Jul 2016-27 Jan 2017]. In the last 4 weeks, there was a weekly average of 53 suspected and confirmed cases.\n\nIn Cura\u00e7ao, there is an increasing trend in the number of suspected and confirmed cases between EW 31 and EW 47 of 2016 [30 Jul-25 Nov 2017].\n\nIn Guadeloupe and Martinique a low circulation of the virus continues to be reported with a few sporadic confirmed cases in the last five weeks (EW 1 of EW 5 of 2017) [1 Jan-3 Feb 2017].\n\nWhile other countries and territories in the Caribbean continue to report cases, there is a decreasing trend in the sub-region with a weekly average of 340 cases in the last 4 weeks.\n\nSouth America\nIn Argentina in EW 8 of 2017 [week ending 24 Feb 2017], 2 autochthonous cases were confirmed for the 1st time in the province of Salta (one case) and in the province of Chaco (one case), the latter case had a history of having stayed in the province of Formosa during the probable period of infection. In 2016, autochthonous cases had been confirmed in the provinces of C\u00f3rdoba and Tucum\u00e1n.\n\nIn Paraguay, the trend of suspected cases increased between EW 42 of 2016 and EW 5 of 2017 [14 Oct 2016-3 Feb 2017].\n\nIn Peru, there was an increase in the number of cases reported between EW 1 and EW 3 of 2017 [1 Jan-20 Jan 2017]; the increase is related to an outbreak occurring in the department of Loreto. In 2017 cases were reported in new districts of the departments of Loreto, San Mart\u00edn, and Ucayali.\n\nIn other countries of South America, the number of cases reported remains stable with a weekly average of 396 cases (353 suspected and 43 confirmed) in the last 4 weeks.\n\nTrend in the Caribbean, Central America, and South America\nFigure 2 shows the trend of suspected and confirmed cases in the Caribbean, Central America, and South America. Incidence rate peaked in EW 7 of 2016 [week ending 19 Feb 2016] for all 3 sub-regions; from that point onwards in Central America and South America a downward trend occurs. In contrast, in the Caribbean, a growing trend occurred with a peak observed in EW 23 of 2016 [week ending 10 Jun 2016]. Since EW 40 of 2016 [week ending 7 Oct 2016], the trend has remained stable in all 3 sub-regions.\n\nFigure 2 [graph]. Distribution of incidence rate by EW and sub-region.

Emerg Infect Dis. 2017; 23(3): 405-14. doi: 10.3201/eid2303.161499\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nAbstract\n--------\nZika virus is causally linked with congenital microcephaly and may be associated with pregnancy loss. However, the mechanisms of Zika virus intrauterine transmission and replication and its tropism and persistence in tissues are poorly understood. We tested tissues from 52 case-patients: 8 infants with microcephaly who died and 44 women suspected of being infected with Zika virus during pregnancy. By reverse transcription PCR, tissues from 32 (62 percent) case-patients (brains from 8 infants with microcephaly and placental/fetal tissues from 24 women) were positive for Zika virus. In situ hybridization localized replicative Zika virus RNA in brains of 7 infants and in placentas of 9 women who had pregnancy losses during the 1st or 2nd trimester. These findings demonstrate that Zika virus replicates and persists in fetal brains and placentas, providing direct evidence of its association with microcephaly. Tissue-based reverse transcription PCR extends the time frame of Zika virus detection in congenital and pregnancy-associated infections.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The evidence of Zika virus infection of and persistence in fetal tissues and the placenta continue to accumulate. This study adds to those observations.\n\nA 9 Mar 2017 report indicates that a new study shows the human fetus may be most vulnerable to Zika infection very early in pregnancy.

All but one patient developed a dangerous heart rhythm problem and 2/3 had evidence of heart failure, a condition in which the heart can't pump enough blood to meet the body's needs.\n\n\"Our report provides clear evidence that there is a relationship between the Zika virus infection and cardiovascular complications,\" said Karina Gonzalez Carta, MD, cardiologist and research fellow at the department of cardiovascular diseases at Mayo Clinic and the study's lead author. \"Based on these initial results, people need to be aware that if they travel to or live in a place with known Zika virus and develop a rash, fever or conjunctivitis, and within a short timeframe also feel other symptoms such as fatigue, shortness of breath or their heart skipping beats, they should see their doctor.\"\n\nCarta and her team were not entirely surprised by their findings as they follow trends seen with other mosquito-borne diseases known to affect the heart, including the dengue and chikungunya virus [infections]. However, she noted that the burden and severity of heart problems, including rapidly progressive heart failure and potentially life-threatening arrhythmias, among these patients was unexpected.\n\nThe 9 patients who were seen in the clinic in Caracas within one week of having Zika-type symptoms and who subsequently reported common symptoms of heart problems, most commonly palpitations followed by shortness of breath and fatigue, were included in this small, prospective case report. Only one patient had any previous cardiovascular problems (well-controlled high blood pressure), and lab tests confirmed that all had active Zika infection. Patients were asked to fill out a form to record their symptoms and underwent an initial electrocardiogram, a test that displays the electrical activity of the heart, which in 8 cases was suggestive of a problem with the rate or rhythm of their heartbeat. These findings prompted researchers to perform a full cardiovascular work up using an echocardiogram, (24-hour) Holter monitor, and a cardiac magnetic resonance imaging study. Of the 9 patients, 6 were female with a mean age of 47 \u00b1 17 years. They were followed for an average of 6 months, beginning in July 2016.\n\nDangerous arrhythmias were detected in 8 of the 9 patients: 3 cases of atrial fibrillation, 2 cases of non-sustained atrial tachycardia and 2 cases of ventricular arrhythmias, which can be deadly. Heart failure was present in 6 cases. Of these, 5 patients had heart failure with low ejection fraction -- when the amount of blood the heart is able to squeeze out is much less than what it normally would be -- and one had heart failure with preserved ejection fraction along with pre-eclampsia and a moderate to severe amount of fluid around the heart (called pericardial effusion). So far, none of the patients' cardiac issues have resolved, though symptoms are much improved due to guideline-directed treatment for heart failure or atrial fibrillation. Of note, cardiovascular symptoms tend to manifest later in the process. Data show an average lag of 10 days from patients' initial complaints of Zika symptoms to reports of symptoms suggestive of heart problems.\n\n\"Since the majority of people with Zika virus infections present with mild or non-specific symptoms and symptoms of cardiovascular complications may not occur right away, we need to raise awareness about the possible association,\" Carta said.\n\nAlthough cardiovascular manifestations are fairly rare against the total number of patients treated at the clinic, Carta believes many more cases will be diagnosed, not only in patients with clear symptoms, but also among those with less severe or no signs of myocarditis, an inflammation of the myocardium, the middle layer of the heart wall. Myocarditis can affect the heart's muscle and electrical system.\n\n\"It's likely that many more people are affected, especially as many clinicians and people may not make the connection between symptoms,\" Carta said. \"We need larger, systematic studies to understand the actual risk of Zika-related cardiac problems and what makes one patient more prone to develop them.\"\n\nFor now, she advises that people who are traveling to areas with known Zika virus consider talking with their doctor so they know what basic measures can be taken to prevent infection. Researchers are continuing to follow these patients and are setting up new strategies to screen more patients for cardiovascular problems.\n\nSymptoms of the Zika virus usually include mild fever, skin rash, conjunctivitis (pink eye), muscle and joint pain, malaise or headache, which typically last for 2 to 7 days, according to the World Health Organization. The best way to prevent the Zika virus is by preventing mosquito bites.\n\nWhile this study points to another potential risk of Zika virus infection, it is limited due to its small size. What remains unclear is whether and how the Zika virus might affect people with existing heart disease. However, Carta says that based on our knowledge of other arboviral infections, patients who have pre-existing cardiovascular disease tend to have worse outcomes.\n\nCarta will present the study, \"Myocarditis, Heart Failure and Arrhythmias in Patients With Zika,\" on Sat 18 Mar 2017, at the American College of Cardiology's 66th Annual Scientific Session in Washington.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Zika virus infections continue to provide unpleasant surprises.

Emerg Infect Dis. 2017; 23(5); doi: 10.3201/eid2305.161631\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nAbstract\n--------\nWe tested whole-blood and plasma samples from immunocompetent patients who had had benign Zika virus infections and found that Zika virus RNA persisted in whole blood substantially longer than in plasma. This finding may have implications for diagnosis of acute symptomatic and asymptomatic infections and for testing of blood donations.\n\n[Results]\n---------\nResults from the follow-up (18 whole-blood and 21 plasma samples) showed that the median duration of Zika virus was 22 (range 14-100) days in whole blood and 10 (range 7-37) days in plasma (p=0.058). Mean viral loads of positive samples were 3.39 log copies/mL in whole blood (n=13) and 2.52 log copies/mL in plasma (n=6; p=0.001). Viral loads in the last positive samples varied from 2.7 to 3.9 log copies/mL in whole blood and 2.2 to 2.8 log copies/mL in plasma (p=0.06). Whole-blood samples from 2 patients remained positive at 14 and 63 days after their plasma samples had become negative.\n\n[Conclusion]\n------------\nOverall, our data show that use of whole-blood specimens is much more sensitive than use of plasma samples to detect Zika virus RNA. These data could be useful in recommending the use of whole blood instead of plasma for the molecular diagnosis of acute symptomatic and asymptomatic Zika virus infections and for the safety of whole blood and blood components from donors, as well as for the safety of organs, tissues, and cells from deceased and living donors.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[This information should be useful for blood banks screening for Zika virus presence. - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[6] Virus in banked sperm\nDate: Tue 14 Mar 2017 0351 GMT\nSource: CNN [edited]\nhttp://edition.cnn.com/2017/03/13/health/zika-florida-sperm-warning/index.html\n\n\nSperm donated in 3 Florida counties since [15 Jun 2016] may be infected with the Zika virus, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention cautioned [Mon 13 Mar 2017]. \"When semen is donated it can be stored frozen for periods of time. It does not necessarily inactivate Zika, so it could be stored in tissue banks, used subsequently, and people should be made aware,\" said Dr Peter Marks, director of the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research at the US Food and Drug Administration. He went on to say having this information can help individuals make informed decisions and they \"might want to use these donations from other sources.\" Sources other than the 12 sperm banks in Miami-Dade, Palm Beach, and Broward counties of Florida, that is.\n\nThe agency had previously designated only Miami-Dade County as an area to take precautions after the 1st local transmission of the virus in the continental United States was confirmed in the Wynwood neighborhood of Miami in July [2016]. The area was declared Zika free in December [2016].\n\nThe 1st known sexual transmission of Zika virus in US was 8 years ago. However, the CDC is now warning anyone in Palm Beach and Broward counties to also consider themselves at an increased risk for the virus. This applies to anyone who has traveled to or between these 3 counties since 15 Jun 2016, a change from previous guidance that designated 29 Jun [2016] as the start of the increased risk period.\n\nIt is possible that someone could have Zika without knowing, because an estimated 80 percent of those infected have no symptoms. When symptoms occur, they can include fever, rash, joint pain, and red eyes, and they can last from a few days to about a week.\n\nPregnant women are at greatest risk because they can unknowingly pass the virus to their fetus, causing devastating consequences including miscarriage and neurological deficits that last a lifetime.\n\nBecause the virus can also be sexually transmitted, pregnant women or those trying to become pregnant have been advised to avoid unprotected sex with a partner who has been infected or who has lived in or traveled to an area where the virus is circulating.\n\nThe ongoing investigation into reported cases of the virus in Florida has found that residents of Miami-Dade, Palm Beach, and Broward counties travel frequently between the counties and either forget, or fail to, consider that they've visited an area of increased risk, thus not realizing they could be infected.\n\nWomen who live in these 3 counties who have become pregnant since 15 Jun [2016] are advised to speak with their physicians about the potential increased risk as are women who want to use a sperm donation from a donor in these counties, advised Dr. Denise Jamieson, incident commander for the CDC Zika emergency response and chief of the women's health and fertility branch at the CDC's division of reproductive health.\n\nCDC officials said they are acting only out of an abundance of caution and there have not been any reports of the virus being transmitted through donated sperm.\n\n\"Now we understand more than we did months ago is that evidence of the Zika virus is present in semen for up to 3 months after a man is infected and people may not have accurately recalled potential exposure [to the virus] especially if in a local area,\" said Dr Matthew Kuehnert, who is part of the CDC Zika emergency response team and director of the CDC office of blood, organ and other tissue safety.\n\nUnlike blood donations, which are routinely screened for the virus in the United States, there is no available test to screen semen for Zika. The existing test is still in the research phase and accuracy is being assessed, which is why men in these counties should not donate sperm. Their donated sperm may be infected.\n\nThe Florida Department of Health last reported a case of local transmission of the virus on [2 Mar 2017]. However, that report included confirmation of 2 cases from October of last year [2016]. A 3rd case was also reported then but this was an individual who donated blood in January [2017] and through routine blood screening was found to have previously been infected but no longer had an active case of the virus.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Although this may seem like an over precautious stance, the risk of Zika virus transmission from donated sperm is small but real. The consequence of fetal infections is serious for families that have to deal with the consequences of a child with microcephaly or other birth defects. - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[7] _Culex quinquefasciatus_ and _Aedes taeniorhynchus_ refractory\nDate: March 2017 [ahead of print]\nSource: Emerging Infectious Diseases journal [edited]\nhttps://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/23/3/16-1636_article\n\n\nRef: Hart CE, Roundy CM, Azar SR, et al: Zika virus vector competency of mosquitoes, Gulf Coast, United States.

We applied multiple sequencing approaches to generate 100 ZIKV genomes from clinical and mosquito samples from 10 countries and territories, greatly expanding the observed viral genetic diversity from this outbreak. We analyzed the timing and patterns of introductions into distinct geographic regions, confirming phylogenetic evidence for the origin and rapid expansion of the outbreak in Brazil, and for multiple introductions from Brazil into Honduras, Colombia, Puerto Rico, other Caribbean islands, and the continental US. We find that ZIKV circulated undetected in many regions of the Americas for up to a year before the 1st locally transmitted cases were confirmed, highlighting the challenge of effective surveillance for this virus. We further characterize genetic variation across the outbreak to identify mutations with possible functional implications for ZIKV biology and pathogenesis.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n[This report provides a recent historical overview of Zika virus in the Americas.

To date, 48 countries and territories in the Americas have confirmed autochthonous, vector-borne transmission of Zika virus since 2015 (Figure 1). In addition, 5 countries in the Americas have reported sexually transmitted Zika cases.\n\nFigure 1 [map]. Countries and territories in the Americas with confirmed autochthonous (vector-borne) Zika virus cases, 2015 - 2017.\n[Footnote to map:\n(1) Anguilla; Antigua and Barbuda; Argentina; Aruba; the Bahamas; Barbados; Belize; Bolivia (Plurinational State of); Bonaire, Sint Eustatius, and Saba; Brazil; the British Virgin Islands; Cayman Islands; Colombia; Costa Rica; Cuba; Cura\u00e7ao; Dominica; the Dominican Republic; Ecuador; El Salvador; French Guiana; Grenada; Guadeloupe; Guatemala; Guyana; Haiti; Honduras; Jamaica; Martinique; Mexico; Montserrat; Nicaragua; Panama; Paraguay; Peru; Puerto Rico; Saint Barth\u00e9lemy; Saint Kitts and Nevis; Saint Lucia; Saint Martin; Saint Vincent and the Grenadines; Sint Maarten; Suriname; Trinidad and Tobago; Turks and Caicos Islands; the United States of America; the United States Virgin Islands; and Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of).\n(2) Argentina, Canada, Chile, Peru, and the United States of America.\n\nNorth America\nIn the United States of America, the Florida Department of Health reported isolated local transmission cases.\n\nIn Mexico, new cases continue to be reported, although they have been decreasing since EW 40 of 2016 [week ending 7 Oct 2016].\n\nCentral America\nThe number of reported cases in Central America continues to decrease, with a weekly average of 335 cases, 275 suspected, and 60 confirmed, in the last 4 weeks (EW 6 to EW 9 of 2017) [4 Feb-3 Mar 2017].\n\nIn Costa Rica a slight increase of suspected and confirmed cases was reported in EW 5 of 2017 [week ending 3 Feb 2017].\n\nIn Panama there was increasing trend of suspected and confirmed cases between EW 30 of 2016 and EW 1 of 2017 [23 Jul 2016-6 Jan 2017]. Although there was a decrease in EW 2 of 2017 [week ending 13 Jan 2017], suspected and confirmed cases continue to be reported at a weekly average of 229 suspected and confirmed cases in the last 4 weeks.\n\nCaribbean\nIn Aruba an increasing trend in suspected and confirmed cases was reported between EW 29 of 2016 and EW 4 of 2017 [16 Jul 2016-27 Jan 2017]. In the last 4 weeks, there was a weekly average of 53 suspected and confirmed cases.\n\nIn Cura\u00e7ao, there is an increasing trend in the number of suspected and confirmed cases between EW 31 and EW 47 of 2016 [30 Jul-25 Nov 2017].\n\nIn Guadeloupe and Martinique a low circulation of the virus continues to be reported with a few sporadic confirmed cases in the last five weeks (EW 1 of EW 5 of 2017) [1 Jan-3 Feb 2017].\n\nWhile other countries and territories in the Caribbean continue to report cases, there is a decreasing trend in the sub-region with a weekly average of 340 cases in the last 4 weeks.\n\nSouth America\nIn Argentina in EW 8 of 2017 [week ending 24 Feb 2017], 2 autochthonous cases were confirmed for the 1st time in the province of Salta (one case) and in the province of Chaco (one case), the latter case had a history of having stayed in the province of Formosa during the probable period of infection. In 2016, autochthonous cases had been confirmed in the provinces of C\u00f3rdoba and Tucum\u00e1n.\n\nIn Paraguay, the trend of suspected cases increased between EW 42 of 2016 and EW 5 of 2017 [14 Oct 2016-3 Feb 2017].\n\nIn Peru, there was an increase in the number of cases reported between EW 1 and EW 3 of 2017 [1 Jan-20 Jan 2017]; the increase is related to an outbreak occurring in the department of Loreto. In 2017 cases were reported in new districts of the departments of Loreto, San Mart\u00edn, and Ucayali.\n\nIn other countries of South America, the number of cases reported remains stable with a weekly average of 396 cases (353 suspected and 43 confirmed) in the last 4 weeks.\n\nTrend in the Caribbean, Central America, and South America\nFigure 2 shows the trend of suspected and confirmed cases in the Caribbean, Central America, and South America. Incidence rate peaked in EW 7 of 2016 [week ending 19 Feb 2016] for all 3 sub-regions; from that point onwards in Central America and South America a downward trend occurs. In contrast, in the Caribbean, a growing trend occurred with a peak observed in EW 23 of 2016 [week ending 10 Jun 2016]. Since EW 40 of 2016 [week ending 7 Oct 2016], the trend has remained stable in all 3 sub-regions.\n\nFigure 2 [graph]. Distribution of incidence rate by EW and sub-region.

However, the mechanisms of Zika virus intrauterine transmission and replication and its tropism and persistence in tissues are poorly understood. We tested tissues from 52 case-patients: 8 infants with microcephaly who died and 44 women suspected of being infected with Zika virus during pregnancy. By reverse transcription PCR, tissues from 32 (62 percent) case-patients (brains from 8 infants with microcephaly and placental/fetal tissues from 24 women) were positive for Zika virus. In situ hybridization localized replicative Zika virus RNA in brains of 7 infants and in placentas of 9 women who had pregnancy losses during the 1st or 2nd trimester. These findings demonstrate that Zika virus replicates and persists in fetal brains and placentas, providing direct evidence of its association with microcephaly. Tissue-based reverse transcription PCR extends the time frame of Zika virus detection in congenital and pregnancy-associated infections.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The evidence of Zika virus infection of and persistence in fetal tissues and the placenta continue to accumulate. This study adds to those observations.\n\nA 9 Mar 2017 report indicates that a new study shows the human fetus may be most vulnerable to Zika infection very early in pregnancy.

All but one patient developed a dangerous heart rhythm problem and 2/3 had evidence of heart failure, a condition in which the heart can't pump enough blood to meet the body's needs.\n\n\"Our report provides clear evidence that there is a relationship between the Zika virus infection and cardiovascular complications,\" said Karina Gonzalez Carta, MD, cardiologist and research fellow at the department of cardiovascular diseases at Mayo Clinic and the study's lead author. \"Based on these initial results, people need to be aware that if they travel to or live in a place with known Zika virus and develop a rash, fever or conjunctivitis, and within a short timeframe also feel other symptoms such as fatigue, shortness of breath or their heart skipping beats, they should see their doctor.\"\n\nCarta and her team were not entirely surprised by their findings as they follow trends seen with other mosquito-borne diseases known to affect the heart, including the dengue and chikungunya virus [infections]. However, she noted that the burden and severity of heart problems, including rapidly progressive heart failure and potentially life-threatening arrhythmias, among these patients was unexpected.\n\nThe 9 patients who were seen in the clinic in Caracas within one week of having Zika-type symptoms and who subsequently reported common symptoms of heart problems, most commonly palpitations followed by shortness of breath and fatigue, were included in this small, prospective case report. Only one patient had any previous cardiovascular problems (well-controlled high blood pressure), and lab tests confirmed that all had active Zika infection. Patients were asked to fill out a form to record their symptoms and underwent an initial electrocardiogram, a test that displays the electrical activity of the heart, which in 8 cases was suggestive of a problem with the rate or rhythm of their heartbeat. These findings prompted researchers to perform a full cardiovascular work up using an echocardiogram, (24-hour) Holter monitor, and a cardiac magnetic resonance imaging study. Of the 9 patients, 6 were female with a mean age of 47 \u00b1 17 years. They were followed for an average of 6 months, beginning in July 2016.\n\nDangerous arrhythmias were detected in 8 of the 9 patients: 3 cases of atrial fibrillation, 2 cases of non-sustained atrial tachycardia and 2 cases of ventricular arrhythmias, which can be deadly. Heart failure was present in 6 cases. Of these, 5 patients had heart failure with low ejection fraction -- when the amount of blood the heart is able to squeeze out is much less than what it normally would be -- and one had heart failure with preserved ejection fraction along with pre-eclampsia and a moderate to severe amount of fluid around the heart (called pericardial effusion). So far, none of the patients' cardiac issues have resolved, though symptoms are much improved due to guideline-directed treatment for heart failure or atrial fibrillation. Of note, cardiovascular symptoms tend to manifest later in the process. Data show an average lag of 10 days from patients' initial complaints of Zika symptoms to reports of symptoms suggestive of heart problems.\n\n\"Since the majority of people with Zika virus infections present with mild or non-specific symptoms and symptoms of cardiovascular complications may not occur right away, we need to raise awareness about the possible association,\" Carta said.\n\nAlthough cardiovascular manifestations are fairly rare against the total number of patients treated at the clinic, Carta believes many more cases will be diagnosed, not only in patients with clear symptoms, but also among those with less severe or no signs of myocarditis, an inflammation of the myocardium, the middle layer of the heart wall. Myocarditis can affect the heart's muscle and electrical system.\n\n\"It's likely that many more people are affected, especially as many clinicians and people may not make the connection between symptoms,\" Carta said. \"We need larger, systematic studies to understand the actual risk of Zika-related cardiac problems and what makes one patient more prone to develop them.\"\n\nFor now, she advises that people who are traveling to areas with known Zika virus consider talking with their doctor so they know what basic measures can be taken to prevent infection. Researchers are continuing to follow these patients and are setting up new strategies to screen more patients for cardiovascular problems.\n\nSymptoms of the Zika virus usually include mild fever, skin rash, conjunctivitis (pink eye), muscle and joint pain, malaise or headache, which typically last for 2 to 7 days, according to the World Health Organization. The best way to prevent the Zika virus is by preventing mosquito bites.\n\nWhile this study points to another potential risk of Zika virus infection, it is limited due to its small size. What remains unclear is whether and how the Zika virus might affect people with existing heart disease. However, Carta says that based on our knowledge of other arboviral infections, patients who have pre-existing cardiovascular disease tend to have worse outcomes.\n\nCarta will present the study, \"Myocarditis, Heart Failure and Arrhythmias in Patients With Zika,\" on Sat 18 Mar 2017, at the American College of Cardiology's 66th Annual Scientific Session in Washington.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Zika virus infections continue to provide unpleasant surprises.

Emerg Infect Dis. 2017; 23(5); doi: 10.3201/eid2305.161631\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nAbstract\n--------\nWe tested whole-blood and plasma samples from immunocompetent patients who had had benign Zika virus infections and found that Zika virus RNA persisted in whole blood substantially longer than in plasma. This finding may have implications for diagnosis of acute symptomatic and asymptomatic infections and for testing of blood donations.\n\n[Results]\n---------\nResults from the follow-up (18 whole-blood and 21 plasma samples) showed that the median duration of Zika virus was 22 (range 14-100) days in whole blood and 10 (range 7-37) days in plasma (p=0.058). Mean viral loads of positive samples were 3.39 log copies/mL in whole blood (n=13) and 2.52 log copies/mL in plasma (n=6; p=0.001). Viral loads in the last positive samples varied from 2.7 to 3.9 log copies/mL in whole blood and 2.2 to 2.8 log copies/mL in plasma (p=0.06). Whole-blood samples from 2 patients remained positive at 14 and 63 days after their plasma samples had become negative.\n\n[Conclusion]\n------------\nOverall, our data show that use of whole-blood specimens is much more sensitive than use of plasma samples to detect Zika virus RNA. These data could be useful in recommending the use of whole blood instead of plasma for the molecular diagnosis of acute symptomatic and asymptomatic Zika virus infections and for the safety of whole blood and blood components from donors, as well as for the safety of organs, tissues, and cells from deceased and living donors.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[This information should be useful for blood banks screening for Zika virus presence. - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[6] Virus in banked sperm\nDate: Tue 14 Mar 2017 0351 GMT\nSource: CNN [edited]\nhttp://edition.cnn.com/2017/03/13/health/zika-florida-sperm-warning/index.html\n\n\nSperm donated in 3 Florida counties since [15 Jun 2016] may be infected with the Zika virus, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention cautioned [Mon 13 Mar 2017]. \"When semen is donated it can be stored frozen for periods of time. It does not necessarily inactivate Zika, so it could be stored in tissue banks, used subsequently, and people should be made aware,\" said Dr Peter Marks, director of the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research at the US Food and Drug Administration. He went on to say having this information can help individuals make informed decisions and they \"might want to use these donations from other sources.\" Sources other than the 12 sperm banks in Miami-Dade, Palm Beach, and Broward counties of Florida, that is.\n\nThe agency had previously designated only Miami-Dade County as an area to take precautions after the 1st local transmission of the virus in the continental United States was confirmed in the Wynwood neighborhood of Miami in July [2016]. The area was declared Zika free in December [2016].\n\nThe 1st known sexual transmission of Zika virus in US was 8 years ago. However, the CDC is now warning anyone in Palm Beach and Broward counties to also consider themselves at an increased risk for the virus. This applies to anyone who has traveled to or between these 3 counties since 15 Jun 2016, a change from previous guidance that designated 29 Jun [2016] as the start of the increased risk period.\n\nIt is possible that someone could have Zika without knowing, because an estimated 80 percent of those infected have no symptoms. When symptoms occur, they can include fever, rash, joint pain, and red eyes, and they can last from a few days to about a week.\n\nPregnant women are at greatest risk because they can unknowingly pass the virus to their fetus, causing devastating consequences including miscarriage and neurological deficits that last a lifetime.\n\nBecause the virus can also be sexually transmitted, pregnant women or those trying to become pregnant have been advised to avoid unprotected sex with a partner who has been infected or who has lived in or traveled to an area where the virus is circulating.\n\nThe ongoing investigation into reported cases of the virus in Florida has found that residents of Miami-Dade, Palm Beach, and Broward counties travel frequently between the counties and either forget, or fail to, consider that they've visited an area of increased risk, thus not realizing they could be infected.\n\nWomen who live in these 3 counties who have become pregnant since 15 Jun [2016] are advised to speak with their physicians about the potential increased risk as are women who want to use a sperm donation from a donor in these counties, advised Dr. Denise Jamieson, incident commander for the CDC Zika emergency response and chief of the women's health and fertility branch at the CDC's division of reproductive health.\n\nCDC officials said they are acting only out of an abundance of caution and there have not been any reports of the virus being transmitted through donated sperm.\n\n\"Now we understand more than we did months ago is that evidence of the Zika virus is present in semen for up to 3 months after a man is infected and people may not have accurately recalled potential exposure [to the virus] especially if in a local area,\" said Dr Matthew Kuehnert, who is part of the CDC Zika emergency response team and director of the CDC office of blood, organ and other tissue safety.\n\nUnlike blood donations, which are routinely screened for the virus in the United States, there is no available test to screen semen for Zika. The existing test is still in the research phase and accuracy is being assessed, which is why men in these counties should not donate sperm. Their donated sperm may be infected.\n\nThe Florida Department of Health last reported a case of local transmission of the virus on [2 Mar 2017]. However, that report included confirmation of 2 cases from October of last year [2016]. A 3rd case was also reported then but this was an individual who donated blood in January [2017] and through routine blood screening was found to have previously been infected but no longer had an active case of the virus.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Although this may seem like an over precautious stance, the risk of Zika virus transmission from donated sperm is small but real. The consequence of fetal infections is serious for families that have to deal with the consequences of a child with microcephaly or other birth defects. - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[7] _Culex quinquefasciatus_ and _Aedes taeniorhynchus_ refractory\nDate: March 2017 [ahead of print]\nSource: Emerging Infectious Diseases journal [edited]\nhttps://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/23/3/16-1636_article\n\n\nRef: Hart CE, Roundy CM, Azar SR, et al: Zika virus vector competency of mosquitoes, Gulf Coast, United States.

We applied multiple sequencing approaches to generate 100 ZIKV genomes from clinical and mosquito samples from 10 countries and territories, greatly expanding the observed viral genetic diversity from this outbreak. We analyzed the timing and patterns of introductions into distinct geographic regions, confirming phylogenetic evidence for the origin and rapid expansion of the outbreak in Brazil, and for multiple introductions from Brazil into Honduras, Colombia, Puerto Rico, other Caribbean islands, and the continental US. We find that ZIKV circulated undetected in many regions of the Americas for up to a year before the 1st locally transmitted cases were confirmed, highlighting the challenge of effective surveillance for this virus. We further characterize genetic variation across the outbreak to identify mutations with possible functional implications for ZIKV biology and pathogenesis.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n[This report provides a recent historical overview of Zika virus in the Americas.

To date, 48 countries and territories in the Americas have confirmed autochthonous, vector-borne transmission of Zika virus since 2015 (Figure 1). In addition, 5 countries in the Americas have reported sexually transmitted Zika cases.\n\nFigure 1 [map]. Countries and territories in the Americas with confirmed autochthonous (vector-borne) Zika virus cases, 2015 - 2017.\n[Footnote to map:\n(1) Anguilla; Antigua and Barbuda; Argentina; Aruba; the Bahamas; Barbados; Belize; Bolivia (Plurinational State of); Bonaire, Sint Eustatius, and Saba; Brazil; the British Virgin Islands; Cayman Islands; Colombia; Costa Rica; Cuba; Cura\u00e7ao; Dominica; the Dominican Republic; Ecuador; El Salvador; French Guiana; Grenada; Guadeloupe; Guatemala; Guyana; Haiti; Honduras; Jamaica; Martinique; Mexico; Montserrat; Nicaragua; Panama; Paraguay; Peru; Puerto Rico; Saint Barth\u00e9lemy; Saint Kitts and Nevis; Saint Lucia; Saint Martin; Saint Vincent and the Grenadines; Sint Maarten; Suriname; Trinidad and Tobago; Turks and Caicos Islands; the United States of America; the United States Virgin Islands; and Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of).\n(2) Argentina, Canada, Chile, Peru, and the United States of America.\n\nNorth America\nIn the United States of America, the Florida Department of Health reported isolated local transmission cases.\n\nIn Mexico, new cases continue to be reported, although they have been decreasing since EW 40 of 2016 [week ending 7 Oct 2016].\n\nCentral America\nThe number of reported cases in Central America continues to decrease, with a weekly average of 335 cases, 275 suspected, and 60 confirmed, in the last 4 weeks (EW 6 to EW 9 of 2017) [4 Feb-3 Mar 2017].\n\nIn Costa Rica a slight increase of suspected and confirmed cases was reported in EW 5 of 2017 [week ending 3 Feb 2017].\n\nIn Panama there was increasing trend of suspected and confirmed cases between EW 30 of 2016 and EW 1 of 2017 [23 Jul 2016-6 Jan 2017]. Although there was a decrease in EW 2 of 2017 [week ending 13 Jan 2017], suspected and confirmed cases continue to be reported at a weekly average of 229 suspected and confirmed cases in the last 4 weeks.\n\nCaribbean\nIn Aruba an increasing trend in suspected and confirmed cases was reported between EW 29 of 2016 and EW 4 of 2017 [16 Jul 2016-27 Jan 2017]. In the last 4 weeks, there was a weekly average of 53 suspected and confirmed cases.\n\nIn Cura\u00e7ao, there is an increasing trend in the number of suspected and confirmed cases between EW 31 and EW 47 of 2016 [30 Jul-25 Nov 2017].\n\nIn Guadeloupe and Martinique a low circulation of the virus continues to be reported with a few sporadic confirmed cases in the last five weeks (EW 1 of EW 5 of 2017) [1 Jan-3 Feb 2017].\n\nWhile other countries and territories in the Caribbean continue to report cases, there is a decreasing trend in the sub-region with a weekly average of 340 cases in the last 4 weeks.\n\nSouth America\nIn Argentina in EW 8 of 2017 [week ending 24 Feb 2017], 2 autochthonous cases were confirmed for the 1st time in the province of Salta (one case) and in the province of Chaco (one case), the latter case had a history of having stayed in the province of Formosa during the probable period of infection. In 2016, autochthonous cases had been confirmed in the provinces of C\u00f3rdoba and Tucum\u00e1n.\n\nIn Paraguay, the trend of suspected cases increased between EW 42 of 2016 and EW 5 of 2017 [14 Oct 2016-3 Feb 2017].\n\nIn Peru, there was an increase in the number of cases reported between EW 1 and EW 3 of 2017 [1 Jan-20 Jan 2017]; the increase is related to an outbreak occurring in the department of Loreto. In 2017 cases were reported in new districts of the departments of Loreto, San Mart\u00edn, and Ucayali.\n\nIn other countries of South America, the number of cases reported remains stable with a weekly average of 396 cases (353 suspected and 43 confirmed) in the last 4 weeks.\n\nTrend in the Caribbean, Central America, and South America\nFigure 2 shows the trend of suspected and confirmed cases in the Caribbean, Central America, and South America. Incidence rate peaked in EW 7 of 2016 [week ending 19 Feb 2016] for all 3 sub-regions; from that point onwards in Central America and South America a downward trend occurs. In contrast, in the Caribbean, a growing trend occurred with a peak observed in EW 23 of 2016 [week ending 10 Jun 2016]. Since EW 40 of 2016 [week ending 7 Oct 2016], the trend has remained stable in all 3 sub-regions.\n\nFigure 2 [graph]. Distribution of incidence rate by EW and sub-region.

Emerg Infect Dis. 2017; 23(3): 405-14. doi: 10.3201/eid2303.161499\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nAbstract\n--------\nZika virus is causally linked with congenital microcephaly and may be associated with pregnancy loss. However, the mechanisms of Zika virus intrauterine transmission and replication and its tropism and persistence in tissues are poorly understood. We tested tissues from 52 case-patients: 8 infants with microcephaly who died and 44 women suspected of being infected with Zika virus during pregnancy. By reverse transcription PCR, tissues from 32 (62 percent) case-patients (brains from 8 infants with microcephaly and placental/fetal tissues from 24 women) were positive for Zika virus. In situ hybridization localized replicative Zika virus RNA in brains of 7 infants and in placentas of 9 women who had pregnancy losses during the 1st or 2nd trimester. These findings demonstrate that Zika virus replicates and persists in fetal brains and placentas, providing direct evidence of its association with microcephaly. Tissue-based reverse transcription PCR extends the time frame of Zika virus detection in congenital and pregnancy-associated infections.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The evidence of Zika virus infection of and persistence in fetal tissues and the placenta continue to accumulate. This study adds to those observations.\n\nA 9 Mar 2017 report indicates that a new study shows the human fetus may be most vulnerable to Zika infection very early in pregnancy.

All but one patient developed a dangerous heart rhythm problem and 2/3 had evidence of heart failure, a condition in which the heart can't pump enough blood to meet the body's needs.\n\n\"Our report provides clear evidence that there is a relationship between the Zika virus infection and cardiovascular complications,\" said Karina Gonzalez Carta, MD, cardiologist and research fellow at the department of cardiovascular diseases at Mayo Clinic and the study's lead author. \"Based on these initial results, people need to be aware that if they travel to or live in a place with known Zika virus and develop a rash, fever or conjunctivitis, and within a short timeframe also feel other symptoms such as fatigue, shortness of breath or their heart skipping beats, they should see their doctor.\"\n\nCarta and her team were not entirely surprised by their findings as they follow trends seen with other mosquito-borne diseases known to affect the heart, including the dengue and chikungunya virus [infections]. However, she noted that the burden and severity of heart problems, including rapidly progressive heart failure and potentially life-threatening arrhythmias, among these patients was unexpected.\n\nThe 9 patients who were seen in the clinic in Caracas within one week of having Zika-type symptoms and who subsequently reported common symptoms of heart problems, most commonly palpitations followed by shortness of breath and fatigue, were included in this small, prospective case report. Only one patient had any previous cardiovascular problems (well-controlled high blood pressure), and lab tests confirmed that all had active Zika infection. Patients were asked to fill out a form to record their symptoms and underwent an initial electrocardiogram, a test that displays the electrical activity of the heart, which in 8 cases was suggestive of a problem with the rate or rhythm of their heartbeat. These findings prompted researchers to perform a full cardiovascular work up using an echocardiogram, (24-hour) Holter monitor, and a cardiac magnetic resonance imaging study. Of the 9 patients, 6 were female with a mean age of 47 \u00b1 17 years. They were followed for an average of 6 months, beginning in July 2016.\n\nDangerous arrhythmias were detected in 8 of the 9 patients: 3 cases of atrial fibrillation, 2 cases of non-sustained atrial tachycardia and 2 cases of ventricular arrhythmias, which can be deadly. Heart failure was present in 6 cases. Of these, 5 patients had heart failure with low ejection fraction -- when the amount of blood the heart is able to squeeze out is much less than what it normally would be -- and one had heart failure with preserved ejection fraction along with pre-eclampsia and a moderate to severe amount of fluid around the heart (called pericardial effusion). So far, none of the patients' cardiac issues have resolved, though symptoms are much improved due to guideline-directed treatment for heart failure or atrial fibrillation. Of note, cardiovascular symptoms tend to manifest later in the process. Data show an average lag of 10 days from patients' initial complaints of Zika symptoms to reports of symptoms suggestive of heart problems.\n\n\"Since the majority of people with Zika virus infections present with mild or non-specific symptoms and symptoms of cardiovascular complications may not occur right away, we need to raise awareness about the possible association,\" Carta said.\n\nAlthough cardiovascular manifestations are fairly rare against the total number of patients treated at the clinic, Carta believes many more cases will be diagnosed, not only in patients with clear symptoms, but also among those with less severe or no signs of myocarditis, an inflammation of the myocardium, the middle layer of the heart wall. Myocarditis can affect the heart's muscle and electrical system.\n\n\"It's likely that many more people are affected, especially as many clinicians and people may not make the connection between symptoms,\" Carta said. \"We need larger, systematic studies to understand the actual risk of Zika-related cardiac problems and what makes one patient more prone to develop them.\"\n\nFor now, she advises that people who are traveling to areas with known Zika virus consider talking with their doctor so they know what basic measures can be taken to prevent infection. Researchers are continuing to follow these patients and are setting up new strategies to screen more patients for cardiovascular problems.\n\nSymptoms of the Zika virus usually include mild fever, skin rash, conjunctivitis (pink eye), muscle and joint pain, malaise or headache, which typically last for 2 to 7 days, according to the World Health Organization. The best way to prevent the Zika virus is by preventing mosquito bites.\n\nWhile this study points to another potential risk of Zika virus infection, it is limited due to its small size. What remains unclear is whether and how the Zika virus might affect people with existing heart disease. However, Carta says that based on our knowledge of other arboviral infections, patients who have pre-existing cardiovascular disease tend to have worse outcomes.\n\nCarta will present the study, \"Myocarditis, Heart Failure and Arrhythmias in Patients With Zika,\" on Sat 18 Mar 2017, at the American College of Cardiology's 66th Annual Scientific Session in Washington.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Zika virus infections continue to provide unpleasant surprises.

Emerg Infect Dis. 2017; 23(5); doi: 10.3201/eid2305.161631\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nAbstract\n--------\nWe tested whole-blood and plasma samples from immunocompetent patients who had had benign Zika virus infections and found that Zika virus RNA persisted in whole blood substantially longer than in plasma. This finding may have implications for diagnosis of acute symptomatic and asymptomatic infections and for testing of blood donations.\n\n[Results]\n---------\nResults from the follow-up (18 whole-blood and 21 plasma samples) showed that the median duration of Zika virus was 22 (range 14-100) days in whole blood and 10 (range 7-37) days in plasma (p=0.058). Mean viral loads of positive samples were 3.39 log copies/mL in whole blood (n=13) and 2.52 log copies/mL in plasma (n=6; p=0.001). Viral loads in the last positive samples varied from 2.7 to 3.9 log copies/mL in whole blood and 2.2 to 2.8 log copies/mL in plasma (p=0.06). Whole-blood samples from 2 patients remained positive at 14 and 63 days after their plasma samples had become negative.\n\n[Conclusion]\n------------\nOverall, our data show that use of whole-blood specimens is much more sensitive than use of plasma samples to detect Zika virus RNA. These data could be useful in recommending the use of whole blood instead of plasma for the molecular diagnosis of acute symptomatic and asymptomatic Zika virus infections and for the safety of whole blood and blood components from donors, as well as for the safety of organs, tissues, and cells from deceased and living donors.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[This information should be useful for blood banks screening for Zika virus presence. - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[6] Virus in banked sperm\nDate: Tue 14 Mar 2017 0351 GMT\nSource: CNN [edited]\nhttp://edition.cnn.com/2017/03/13/health/zika-florida-sperm-warning/index.html\n\n\nSperm donated in 3 Florida counties since [15 Jun 2016] may be infected with the Zika virus, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention cautioned [Mon 13 Mar 2017]. \"When semen is donated it can be stored frozen for periods of time. It does not necessarily inactivate Zika, so it could be stored in tissue banks, used subsequently, and people should be made aware,\" said Dr Peter Marks, director of the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research at the US Food and Drug Administration. He went on to say having this information can help individuals make informed decisions and they \"might want to use these donations from other sources.\" Sources other than the 12 sperm banks in Miami-Dade, Palm Beach, and Broward counties of Florida, that is.\n\nThe agency had previously designated only Miami-Dade County as an area to take precautions after the 1st local transmission of the virus in the continental United States was confirmed in the Wynwood neighborhood of Miami in July [2016]. The area was declared Zika free in December [2016].\n\nThe 1st known sexual transmission of Zika virus in US was 8 years ago. However, the CDC is now warning anyone in Palm Beach and Broward counties to also consider themselves at an increased risk for the virus. This applies to anyone who has traveled to or between these 3 counties since 15 Jun 2016, a change from previous guidance that designated 29 Jun [2016] as the start of the increased risk period.\n\nIt is possible that someone could have Zika without knowing, because an estimated 80 percent of those infected have no symptoms. When symptoms occur, they can include fever, rash, joint pain, and red eyes, and they can last from a few days to about a week.\n\nPregnant women are at greatest risk because they can unknowingly pass the virus to their fetus, causing devastating consequences including miscarriage and neurological deficits that last a lifetime.\n\nBecause the virus can also be sexually transmitted, pregnant women or those trying to become pregnant have been advised to avoid unprotected sex with a partner who has been infected or who has lived in or traveled to an area where the virus is circulating.\n\nThe ongoing investigation into reported cases of the virus in Florida has found that residents of Miami-Dade, Palm Beach, and Broward counties travel frequently between the counties and either forget, or fail to, consider that they've visited an area of increased risk, thus not realizing they could be infected.\n\nWomen who live in these 3 counties who have become pregnant since 15 Jun [2016] are advised to speak with their physicians about the potential increased risk as are women who want to use a sperm donation from a donor in these counties, advised Dr. Denise Jamieson, incident commander for the CDC Zika emergency response and chief of the women's health and fertility branch at the CDC's division of reproductive health.\n\nCDC officials said they are acting only out of an abundance of caution and there have not been any reports of the virus being transmitted through donated sperm.\n\n\"Now we understand more than we did months ago is that evidence of the Zika virus is present in semen for up to 3 months after a man is infected and people may not have accurately recalled potential exposure [to the virus] especially if in a local area,\" said Dr Matthew Kuehnert, who is part of the CDC Zika emergency response team and director of the CDC office of blood, organ and other tissue safety.\n\nUnlike blood donations, which are routinely screened for the virus in the United States, there is no available test to screen semen for Zika. The existing test is still in the research phase and accuracy is being assessed, which is why men in these counties should not donate sperm. Their donated sperm may be infected.\n\nThe Florida Department of Health last reported a case of local transmission of the virus on [2 Mar 2017]. However, that report included confirmation of 2 cases from October of last year [2016]. A 3rd case was also reported then but this was an individual who donated blood in January [2017] and through routine blood screening was found to have previously been infected but no longer had an active case of the virus.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Although this may seem like an over precautious stance, the risk of Zika virus transmission from donated sperm is small but real. The consequence of fetal infections is serious for families that have to deal with the consequences of a child with microcephaly or other birth defects. - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[7] _Culex quinquefasciatus_ and _Aedes taeniorhynchus_ refractory\nDate: March 2017 [ahead of print]\nSource: Emerging Infectious Diseases journal [edited]\nhttps://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/23/3/16-1636_article\n\n\nRef: Hart CE, Roundy CM, Azar SR, et al: Zika virus vector competency of mosquitoes, Gulf Coast, United States.

We applied multiple sequencing approaches to generate 100 ZIKV genomes from clinical and mosquito samples from 10 countries and territories, greatly expanding the observed viral genetic diversity from this outbreak. We analyzed the timing and patterns of introductions into distinct geographic regions, confirming phylogenetic evidence for the origin and rapid expansion of the outbreak in Brazil, and for multiple introductions from Brazil into Honduras, Colombia, Puerto Rico, other Caribbean islands, and the continental US. We find that ZIKV circulated undetected in many regions of the Americas for up to a year before the 1st locally transmitted cases were confirmed, highlighting the challenge of effective surveillance for this virus. We further characterize genetic variation across the outbreak to identify mutations with possible functional implications for ZIKV biology and pathogenesis.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n[This report provides a recent historical overview of Zika virus in the Americas.

To date, 48 countries and territories in the Americas have confirmed autochthonous, vector-borne transmission of Zika virus since 2015 (Figure 1). In addition, 5 countries in the Americas have reported sexually transmitted Zika cases.\n\nFigure 1 [map]. Countries and territories in the Americas with confirmed autochthonous (vector-borne) Zika virus cases, 2015 - 2017.\n[Footnote to map:\n(1) Anguilla; Antigua and Barbuda; Argentina; Aruba; the Bahamas; Barbados; Belize; Bolivia (Plurinational State of); Bonaire, Sint Eustatius, and Saba; Brazil; the British Virgin Islands; Cayman Islands; Colombia; Costa Rica; Cuba; Cura\u00e7ao; Dominica; the Dominican Republic; Ecuador; El Salvador; French Guiana; Grenada; Guadeloupe; Guatemala; Guyana; Haiti; Honduras; Jamaica; Martinique; Mexico; Montserrat; Nicaragua; Panama; Paraguay; Peru; Puerto Rico; Saint Barth\u00e9lemy; Saint Kitts and Nevis; Saint Lucia; Saint Martin; Saint Vincent and the Grenadines; Sint Maarten; Suriname; Trinidad and Tobago; Turks and Caicos Islands; the United States of America; the United States Virgin Islands; and Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of).\n(2) Argentina, Canada, Chile, Peru, and the United States of America.\n\nNorth America\nIn the United States of America, the Florida Department of Health reported isolated local transmission cases.\n\nIn Mexico, new cases continue to be reported, although they have been decreasing since EW 40 of 2016 [week ending 7 Oct 2016].\n\nCentral America\nThe number of reported cases in Central America continues to decrease, with a weekly average of 335 cases, 275 suspected, and 60 confirmed, in the last 4 weeks (EW 6 to EW 9 of 2017) [4 Feb-3 Mar 2017].\n\nIn Costa Rica a slight increase of suspected and confirmed cases was reported in EW 5 of 2017 [week ending 3 Feb 2017].\n\nIn Panama there was increasing trend of suspected and confirmed cases between EW 30 of 2016 and EW 1 of 2017 [23 Jul 2016-6 Jan 2017]. Although there was a decrease in EW 2 of 2017 [week ending 13 Jan 2017], suspected and confirmed cases continue to be reported at a weekly average of 229 suspected and confirmed cases in the last 4 weeks.\n\nCaribbean\nIn Aruba an increasing trend in suspected and confirmed cases was reported between EW 29 of 2016 and EW 4 of 2017 [16 Jul 2016-27 Jan 2017]. In the last 4 weeks, there was a weekly average of 53 suspected and confirmed cases.\n\nIn Cura\u00e7ao, there is an increasing trend in the number of suspected and confirmed cases between EW 31 and EW 47 of 2016 [30 Jul-25 Nov 2017].\n\nIn Guadeloupe and Martinique a low circulation of the virus continues to be reported with a few sporadic confirmed cases in the last five weeks (EW 1 of EW 5 of 2017) [1 Jan-3 Feb 2017].\n\nWhile other countries and territories in the Caribbean continue to report cases, there is a decreasing trend in the sub-region with a weekly average of 340 cases in the last 4 weeks.\n\nSouth America\nIn Argentina in EW 8 of 2017 [week ending 24 Feb 2017], 2 autochthonous cases were confirmed for the 1st time in the province of Salta (one case) and in the province of Chaco (one case), the latter case had a history of having stayed in the province of Formosa during the probable period of infection. In 2016, autochthonous cases had been confirmed in the provinces of C\u00f3rdoba and Tucum\u00e1n.\n\nIn Paraguay, the trend of suspected cases increased between EW 42 of 2016 and EW 5 of 2017 [14 Oct 2016-3 Feb 2017].\n\nIn Peru, there was an increase in the number of cases reported between EW 1 and EW 3 of 2017 [1 Jan-20 Jan 2017]; the increase is related to an outbreak occurring in the department of Loreto. In 2017 cases were reported in new districts of the departments of Loreto, San Mart\u00edn, and Ucayali.\n\nIn other countries of South America, the number of cases reported remains stable with a weekly average of 396 cases (353 suspected and 43 confirmed) in the last 4 weeks.\n\nTrend in the Caribbean, Central America, and South America\nFigure 2 shows the trend of suspected and confirmed cases in the Caribbean, Central America, and South America. Incidence rate peaked in EW 7 of 2016 [week ending 19 Feb 2016] for all 3 sub-regions; from that point onwards in Central America and South America a downward trend occurs. In contrast, in the Caribbean, a growing trend occurred with a peak observed in EW 23 of 2016 [week ending 10 Jun 2016]. Since EW 40 of 2016 [week ending 7 Oct 2016], the trend has remained stable in all 3 sub-regions.\n\nFigure 2 [graph]. Distribution of incidence rate by EW and sub-region.

Emerg Infect Dis. 2017; 23(3): 405-14. doi: 10.3201/eid2303.161499\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nAbstract\n--------\nZika virus is causally linked with congenital microcephaly and may be associated with pregnancy loss. However, the mechanisms of Zika virus intrauterine transmission and replication and its tropism and persistence in tissues are poorly understood. We tested tissues from 52 case-patients: 8 infants with microcephaly who died and 44 women suspected of being infected with Zika virus during pregnancy. By reverse transcription PCR, tissues from 32 (62 percent) case-patients (brains from 8 infants with microcephaly and placental/fetal tissues from 24 women) were positive for Zika virus. In situ hybridization localized replicative Zika virus RNA in brains of 7 infants and in placentas of 9 women who had pregnancy losses during the 1st or 2nd trimester. These findings demonstrate that Zika virus replicates and persists in fetal brains and placentas, providing direct evidence of its association with microcephaly. Tissue-based reverse transcription PCR extends the time frame of Zika virus detection in congenital and pregnancy-associated infections.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The evidence of Zika virus infection of and persistence in fetal tissues and the placenta continue to accumulate. This study adds to those observations.\n\nA 9 Mar 2017 report indicates that a new study shows the human fetus may be most vulnerable to Zika infection very early in pregnancy.

All but one patient developed a dangerous heart rhythm problem and 2/3 had evidence of heart failure, a condition in which the heart can't pump enough blood to meet the body's needs.\n\n\"Our report provides clear evidence that there is a relationship between the Zika virus infection and cardiovascular complications,\" said Karina Gonzalez Carta, MD, cardiologist and research fellow at the department of cardiovascular diseases at Mayo Clinic and the study's lead author. \"Based on these initial results, people need to be aware that if they travel to or live in a place with known Zika virus and develop a rash, fever or conjunctivitis, and within a short timeframe also feel other symptoms such as fatigue, shortness of breath or their heart skipping beats, they should see their doctor.\"\n\nCarta and her team were not entirely surprised by their findings as they follow trends seen with other mosquito-borne diseases known to affect the heart, including the dengue and chikungunya virus [infections]. However, she noted that the burden and severity of heart problems, including rapidly progressive heart failure and potentially life-threatening arrhythmias, among these patients was unexpected.\n\nThe 9 patients who were seen in the clinic in Caracas within one week of having Zika-type symptoms and who subsequently reported common symptoms of heart problems, most commonly palpitations followed by shortness of breath and fatigue, were included in this small, prospective case report. Only one patient had any previous cardiovascular problems (well-controlled high blood pressure), and lab tests confirmed that all had active Zika infection. Patients were asked to fill out a form to record their symptoms and underwent an initial electrocardiogram, a test that displays the electrical activity of the heart, which in 8 cases was suggestive of a problem with the rate or rhythm of their heartbeat. These findings prompted researchers to perform a full cardiovascular work up using an echocardiogram, (24-hour) Holter monitor, and a cardiac magnetic resonance imaging study. Of the 9 patients, 6 were female with a mean age of 47 \u00b1 17 years. They were followed for an average of 6 months, beginning in July 2016.\n\nDangerous arrhythmias were detected in 8 of the 9 patients: 3 cases of atrial fibrillation, 2 cases of non-sustained atrial tachycardia and 2 cases of ventricular arrhythmias, which can be deadly. Heart failure was present in 6 cases. Of these, 5 patients had heart failure with low ejection fraction -- when the amount of blood the heart is able to squeeze out is much less than what it normally would be -- and one had heart failure with preserved ejection fraction along with pre-eclampsia and a moderate to severe amount of fluid around the heart (called pericardial effusion). So far, none of the patients' cardiac issues have resolved, though symptoms are much improved due to guideline-directed treatment for heart failure or atrial fibrillation. Of note, cardiovascular symptoms tend to manifest later in the process. Data show an average lag of 10 days from patients' initial complaints of Zika symptoms to reports of symptoms suggestive of heart problems.\n\n\"Since the majority of people with Zika virus infections present with mild or non-specific symptoms and symptoms of cardiovascular complications may not occur right away, we need to raise awareness about the possible association,\" Carta said.\n\nAlthough cardiovascular manifestations are fairly rare against the total number of patients treated at the clinic, Carta believes many more cases will be diagnosed, not only in patients with clear symptoms, but also among those with less severe or no signs of myocarditis, an inflammation of the myocardium, the middle layer of the heart wall. Myocarditis can affect the heart's muscle and electrical system.\n\n\"It's likely that many more people are affected, especially as many clinicians and people may not make the connection between symptoms,\" Carta said. \"We need larger, systematic studies to understand the actual risk of Zika-related cardiac problems and what makes one patient more prone to develop them.\"\n\nFor now, she advises that people who are traveling to areas with known Zika virus consider talking with their doctor so they know what basic measures can be taken to prevent infection. Researchers are continuing to follow these patients and are setting up new strategies to screen more patients for cardiovascular problems.\n\nSymptoms of the Zika virus usually include mild fever, skin rash, conjunctivitis (pink eye), muscle and joint pain, malaise or headache, which typically last for 2 to 7 days, according to the World Health Organization. The best way to prevent the Zika virus is by preventing mosquito bites.\n\nWhile this study points to another potential risk of Zika virus infection, it is limited due to its small size. What remains unclear is whether and how the Zika virus might affect people with existing heart disease. However, Carta says that based on our knowledge of other arboviral infections, patients who have pre-existing cardiovascular disease tend to have worse outcomes.\n\nCarta will present the study, \"Myocarditis, Heart Failure and Arrhythmias in Patients With Zika,\" on Sat 18 Mar 2017, at the American College of Cardiology's 66th Annual Scientific Session in Washington.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Zika virus infections continue to provide unpleasant surprises.

Emerg Infect Dis. 2017; 23(5); doi: 10.3201/eid2305.161631\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nAbstract\n--------\nWe tested whole-blood and plasma samples from immunocompetent patients who had had benign Zika virus infections and found that Zika virus RNA persisted in whole blood substantially longer than in plasma. This finding may have implications for diagnosis of acute symptomatic and asymptomatic infections and for testing of blood donations.\n\n[Results]\n---------\nResults from the follow-up (18 whole-blood and 21 plasma samples) showed that the median duration of Zika virus was 22 (range 14-100) days in whole blood and 10 (range 7-37) days in plasma (p=0.058). Mean viral loads of positive samples were 3.39 log copies/mL in whole blood (n=13) and 2.52 log copies/mL in plasma (n=6; p=0.001). Viral loads in the last positive samples varied from 2.7 to 3.9 log copies/mL in whole blood and 2.2 to 2.8 log copies/mL in plasma (p=0.06). Whole-blood samples from 2 patients remained positive at 14 and 63 days after their plasma samples had become negative.\n\n[Conclusion]\n------------\nOverall, our data show that use of whole-blood specimens is much more sensitive than use of plasma samples to detect Zika virus RNA. These data could be useful in recommending the use of whole blood instead of plasma for the molecular diagnosis of acute symptomatic and asymptomatic Zika virus infections and for the safety of whole blood and blood components from donors, as well as for the safety of organs, tissues, and cells from deceased and living donors.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[This information should be useful for blood banks screening for Zika virus presence. - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[6] Virus in banked sperm\nDate: Tue 14 Mar 2017 0351 GMT\nSource: CNN [edited]\nhttp://edition.cnn.com/2017/03/13/health/zika-florida-sperm-warning/index.html\n\n\nSperm donated in 3 Florida counties since [15 Jun 2016] may be infected with the Zika virus, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention cautioned [Mon 13 Mar 2017]. \"When semen is donated it can be stored frozen for periods of time. It does not necessarily inactivate Zika, so it could be stored in tissue banks, used subsequently, and people should be made aware,\" said Dr Peter Marks, director of the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research at the US Food and Drug Administration. He went on to say having this information can help individuals make informed decisions and they \"might want to use these donations from other sources.\" Sources other than the 12 sperm banks in Miami-Dade, Palm Beach, and Broward counties of Florida, that is.\n\nThe agency had previously designated only Miami-Dade County as an area to take precautions after the 1st local transmission of the virus in the continental United States was confirmed in the Wynwood neighborhood of Miami in July [2016]. The area was declared Zika free in December [2016].\n\nThe 1st known sexual transmission of Zika virus in US was 8 years ago. However, the CDC is now warning anyone in Palm Beach and Broward counties to also consider themselves at an increased risk for the virus. This applies to anyone who has traveled to or between these 3 counties since 15 Jun 2016, a change from previous guidance that designated 29 Jun [2016] as the start of the increased risk period.\n\nIt is possible that someone could have Zika without knowing, because an estimated 80 percent of those infected have no symptoms. When symptoms occur, they can include fever, rash, joint pain, and red eyes, and they can last from a few days to about a week.\n\nPregnant women are at greatest risk because they can unknowingly pass the virus to their fetus, causing devastating consequences including miscarriage and neurological deficits that last a lifetime.\n\nBecause the virus can also be sexually transmitted, pregnant women or those trying to become pregnant have been advised to avoid unprotected sex with a partner who has been infected or who has lived in or traveled to an area where the virus is circulating.\n\nThe ongoing investigation into reported cases of the virus in Florida has found that residents of Miami-Dade, Palm Beach, and Broward counties travel frequently between the counties and either forget, or fail to, consider that they've visited an area of increased risk, thus not realizing they could be infected.\n\nWomen who live in these 3 counties who have become pregnant since 15 Jun [2016] are advised to speak with their physicians about the potential increased risk as are women who want to use a sperm donation from a donor in these counties, advised Dr. Denise Jamieson, incident commander for the CDC Zika emergency response and chief of the women's health and fertility branch at the CDC's division of reproductive health.\n\nCDC officials said they are acting only out of an abundance of caution and there have not been any reports of the virus being transmitted through donated sperm.\n\n\"Now we understand more than we did months ago is that evidence of the Zika virus is present in semen for up to 3 months after a man is infected and people may not have accurately recalled potential exposure [to the virus] especially if in a local area,\" said Dr Matthew Kuehnert, who is part of the CDC Zika emergency response team and director of the CDC office of blood, organ and other tissue safety.\n\nUnlike blood donations, which are routinely screened for the virus in the United States, there is no available test to screen semen for Zika. The existing test is still in the research phase and accuracy is being assessed, which is why men in these counties should not donate sperm. Their donated sperm may be infected.\n\nThe Florida Department of Health last reported a case of local transmission of the virus on [2 Mar 2017]. However, that report included confirmation of 2 cases from October of last year [2016]. A 3rd case was also reported then but this was an individual who donated blood in January [2017] and through routine blood screening was found to have previously been infected but no longer had an active case of the virus.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Although this may seem like an over precautious stance, the risk of Zika virus transmission from donated sperm is small but real. The consequence of fetal infections is serious for families that have to deal with the consequences of a child with microcephaly or other birth defects. - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[7] _Culex quinquefasciatus_ and _Aedes taeniorhynchus_ refractory\nDate: March 2017 [ahead of print]\nSource: Emerging Infectious Diseases journal [edited]\nhttps://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/23/3/16-1636_article\n\n\nRef: Hart CE, Roundy CM, Azar SR, et al: Zika virus vector competency of mosquitoes, Gulf Coast, United States.

We applied multiple sequencing approaches to generate 100 ZIKV genomes from clinical and mosquito samples from 10 countries and territories, greatly expanding the observed viral genetic diversity from this outbreak. We analyzed the timing and patterns of introductions into distinct geographic regions, confirming phylogenetic evidence for the origin and rapid expansion of the outbreak in Brazil, and for multiple introductions from Brazil into Honduras, Colombia, Puerto Rico, other Caribbean islands, and the continental US. We find that ZIKV circulated undetected in many regions of the Americas for up to a year before the 1st locally transmitted cases were confirmed, highlighting the challenge of effective surveillance for this virus. We further characterize genetic variation across the outbreak to identify mutations with possible functional implications for ZIKV biology and pathogenesis.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n[This report provides a recent historical overview of Zika virus in the Americas.

To date, 48 countries and territories in the Americas have confirmed autochthonous, vector-borne transmission of Zika virus since 2015 (Figure 1). In addition, 5 countries in the Americas have reported sexually transmitted Zika cases.\n\nFigure 1 [map]. Countries and territories in the Americas with confirmed autochthonous (vector-borne) Zika virus cases, 2015 - 2017.\n[Footnote to map:\n(1) Anguilla; Antigua and Barbuda; Argentina; Aruba; the Bahamas; Barbados; Belize; Bolivia (Plurinational State of); Bonaire, Sint Eustatius, and Saba; Brazil; the British Virgin Islands; Cayman Islands; Colombia; Costa Rica; Cuba; Cura\u00e7ao; Dominica; the Dominican Republic; Ecuador; El Salvador; French Guiana; Grenada; Guadeloupe; Guatemala; Guyana; Haiti; Honduras; Jamaica; Martinique; Mexico; Montserrat; Nicaragua; Panama; Paraguay; Peru; Puerto Rico; Saint Barth\u00e9lemy; Saint Kitts and Nevis; Saint Lucia; Saint Martin; Saint Vincent and the Grenadines; Sint Maarten; Suriname; Trinidad and Tobago; Turks and Caicos Islands; the United States of America; the United States Virgin Islands; and Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of).\n(2) Argentina, Canada, Chile, Peru, and the United States of America.\n\nNorth America\nIn the United States of America, the Florida Department of Health reported isolated local transmission cases.\n\nIn Mexico, new cases continue to be reported, although they have been decreasing since EW 40 of 2016 [week ending 7 Oct 2016].\n\nCentral America\nThe number of reported cases in Central America continues to decrease, with a weekly average of 335 cases, 275 suspected, and 60 confirmed, in the last 4 weeks (EW 6 to EW 9 of 2017) [4 Feb-3 Mar 2017].\n\nIn Costa Rica a slight increase of suspected and confirmed cases was reported in EW 5 of 2017 [week ending 3 Feb 2017].\n\nIn Panama there was increasing trend of suspected and confirmed cases between EW 30 of 2016 and EW 1 of 2017 [23 Jul 2016-6 Jan 2017]. Although there was a decrease in EW 2 of 2017 [week ending 13 Jan 2017], suspected and confirmed cases continue to be reported at a weekly average of 229 suspected and confirmed cases in the last 4 weeks.\n\nCaribbean\nIn Aruba an increasing trend in suspected and confirmed cases was reported between EW 29 of 2016 and EW 4 of 2017 [16 Jul 2016-27 Jan 2017]. In the last 4 weeks, there was a weekly average of 53 suspected and confirmed cases.\n\nIn Cura\u00e7ao, there is an increasing trend in the number of suspected and confirmed cases between EW 31 and EW 47 of 2016 [30 Jul-25 Nov 2017].\n\nIn Guadeloupe and Martinique a low circulation of the virus continues to be reported with a few sporadic confirmed cases in the last five weeks (EW 1 of EW 5 of 2017) [1 Jan-3 Feb 2017].\n\nWhile other countries and territories in the Caribbean continue to report cases, there is a decreasing trend in the sub-region with a weekly average of 340 cases in the last 4 weeks.\n\nSouth America\nIn Argentina in EW 8 of 2017 [week ending 24 Feb 2017], 2 autochthonous cases were confirmed for the 1st time in the province of Salta (one case) and in the province of Chaco (one case), the latter case had a history of having stayed in the province of Formosa during the probable period of infection. In 2016, autochthonous cases had been confirmed in the provinces of C\u00f3rdoba and Tucum\u00e1n.\n\nIn Paraguay, the trend of suspected cases increased between EW 42 of 2016 and EW 5 of 2017 [14 Oct 2016-3 Feb 2017].\n\nIn Peru, there was an increase in the number of cases reported between EW 1 and EW 3 of 2017 [1 Jan-20 Jan 2017]; the increase is related to an outbreak occurring in the department of Loreto. In 2017 cases were reported in new districts of the departments of Loreto, San Mart\u00edn, and Ucayali.\n\nIn other countries of South America, the number of cases reported remains stable with a weekly average of 396 cases (353 suspected and 43 confirmed) in the last 4 weeks.\n\nTrend in the Caribbean, Central America, and South America\nFigure 2 shows the trend of suspected and confirmed cases in the Caribbean, Central America, and South America. Incidence rate peaked in EW 7 of 2016 [week ending 19 Feb 2016] for all 3 sub-regions; from that point onwards in Central America and South America a downward trend occurs. In contrast, in the Caribbean, a growing trend occurred with a peak observed in EW 23 of 2016 [week ending 10 Jun 2016]. Since EW 40 of 2016 [week ending 7 Oct 2016], the trend has remained stable in all 3 sub-regions.\n\nFigure 2 [graph]. Distribution of incidence rate by EW and sub-region.

Emerg Infect Dis. 2017; 23(3): 405-14. doi: 10.3201/eid2303.161499\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nAbstract\n--------\nZika virus is causally linked with congenital microcephaly and may be associated with pregnancy loss. However, the mechanisms of Zika virus intrauterine transmission and replication and its tropism and persistence in tissues are poorly understood. We tested tissues from 52 case-patients: 8 infants with microcephaly who died and 44 women suspected of being infected with Zika virus during pregnancy. By reverse transcription PCR, tissues from 32 (62 percent) case-patients (brains from 8 infants with microcephaly and placental/fetal tissues from 24 women) were positive for Zika virus. In situ hybridization localized replicative Zika virus RNA in brains of 7 infants and in placentas of 9 women who had pregnancy losses during the 1st or 2nd trimester. These findings demonstrate that Zika virus replicates and persists in fetal brains and placentas, providing direct evidence of its association with microcephaly. Tissue-based reverse transcription PCR extends the time frame of Zika virus detection in congenital and pregnancy-associated infections.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The evidence of Zika virus infection of and persistence in fetal tissues and the placenta continue to accumulate. This study adds to those observations.\n\nA 9 Mar 2017 report indicates that a new study shows the human fetus may be most vulnerable to Zika infection very early in pregnancy.

All but one patient developed a dangerous heart rhythm problem and 2/3 had evidence of heart failure, a condition in which the heart can't pump enough blood to meet the body's needs.\n\n\"Our report provides clear evidence that there is a relationship between the Zika virus infection and cardiovascular complications,\" said Karina Gonzalez Carta, MD, cardiologist and research fellow at the department of cardiovascular diseases at Mayo Clinic and the study's lead author. \"Based on these initial results, people need to be aware that if they travel to or live in a place with known Zika virus and develop a rash, fever or conjunctivitis, and within a short timeframe also feel other symptoms such as fatigue, shortness of breath or their heart skipping beats, they should see their doctor.\"\n\nCarta and her team were not entirely surprised by their findings as they follow trends seen with other mosquito-borne diseases known to affect the heart, including the dengue and chikungunya virus [infections]. However, she noted that the burden and severity of heart problems, including rapidly progressive heart failure and potentially life-threatening arrhythmias, among these patients was unexpected.\n\nThe 9 patients who were seen in the clinic in Caracas within one week of having Zika-type symptoms and who subsequently reported common symptoms of heart problems, most commonly palpitations followed by shortness of breath and fatigue, were included in this small, prospective case report. Only one patient had any previous cardiovascular problems (well-controlled high blood pressure), and lab tests confirmed that all had active Zika infection. Patients were asked to fill out a form to record their symptoms and underwent an initial electrocardiogram, a test that displays the electrical activity of the heart, which in 8 cases was suggestive of a problem with the rate or rhythm of their heartbeat. These findings prompted researchers to perform a full cardiovascular work up using an echocardiogram, (24-hour) Holter monitor, and a cardiac magnetic resonance imaging study. Of the 9 patients, 6 were female with a mean age of 47 \u00b1 17 years. They were followed for an average of 6 months, beginning in July 2016.\n\nDangerous arrhythmias were detected in 8 of the 9 patients: 3 cases of atrial fibrillation, 2 cases of non-sustained atrial tachycardia and 2 cases of ventricular arrhythmias, which can be deadly. Heart failure was present in 6 cases. Of these, 5 patients had heart failure with low ejection fraction -- when the amount of blood the heart is able to squeeze out is much less than what it normally would be -- and one had heart failure with preserved ejection fraction along with pre-eclampsia and a moderate to severe amount of fluid around the heart (called pericardial effusion). So far, none of the patients' cardiac issues have resolved, though symptoms are much improved due to guideline-directed treatment for heart failure or atrial fibrillation. Of note, cardiovascular symptoms tend to manifest later in the process. Data show an average lag of 10 days from patients' initial complaints of Zika symptoms to reports of symptoms suggestive of heart problems.\n\n\"Since the majority of people with Zika virus infections present with mild or non-specific symptoms and symptoms of cardiovascular complications may not occur right away, we need to raise awareness about the possible association,\" Carta said.\n\nAlthough cardiovascular manifestations are fairly rare against the total number of patients treated at the clinic, Carta believes many more cases will be diagnosed, not only in patients with clear symptoms, but also among those with less severe or no signs of myocarditis, an inflammation of the myocardium, the middle layer of the heart wall. Myocarditis can affect the heart's muscle and electrical system.\n\n\"It's likely that many more people are affected, especially as many clinicians and people may not make the connection between symptoms,\" Carta said. \"We need larger, systematic studies to understand the actual risk of Zika-related cardiac problems and what makes one patient more prone to develop them.\"\n\nFor now, she advises that people who are traveling to areas with known Zika virus consider talking with their doctor so they know what basic measures can be taken to prevent infection. Researchers are continuing to follow these patients and are setting up new strategies to screen more patients for cardiovascular problems.\n\nSymptoms of the Zika virus usually include mild fever, skin rash, conjunctivitis (pink eye), muscle and joint pain, malaise or headache, which typically last for 2 to 7 days, according to the World Health Organization. The best way to prevent the Zika virus is by preventing mosquito bites.\n\nWhile this study points to another potential risk of Zika virus infection, it is limited due to its small size. What remains unclear is whether and how the Zika virus might affect people with existing heart disease. However, Carta says that based on our knowledge of other arboviral infections, patients who have pre-existing cardiovascular disease tend to have worse outcomes.\n\nCarta will present the study, \"Myocarditis, Heart Failure and Arrhythmias in Patients With Zika,\" on Sat 18 Mar 2017, at the American College of Cardiology's 66th Annual Scientific Session in Washington.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Zika virus infections continue to provide unpleasant surprises.

Emerg Infect Dis. 2017; 23(5); doi: 10.3201/eid2305.161631\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nAbstract\n--------\nWe tested whole-blood and plasma samples from immunocompetent patients who had had benign Zika virus infections and found that Zika virus RNA persisted in whole blood substantially longer than in plasma. This finding may have implications for diagnosis of acute symptomatic and asymptomatic infections and for testing of blood donations.\n\n[Results]\n---------\nResults from the follow-up (18 whole-blood and 21 plasma samples) showed that the median duration of Zika virus was 22 (range 14-100) days in whole blood and 10 (range 7-37) days in plasma (p=0.058). Mean viral loads of positive samples were 3.39 log copies/mL in whole blood (n=13) and 2.52 log copies/mL in plasma (n=6; p=0.001). Viral loads in the last positive samples varied from 2.7 to 3.9 log copies/mL in whole blood and 2.2 to 2.8 log copies/mL in plasma (p=0.06). Whole-blood samples from 2 patients remained positive at 14 and 63 days after their plasma samples had become negative.\n\n[Conclusion]\n------------\nOverall, our data show that use of whole-blood specimens is much more sensitive than use of plasma samples to detect Zika virus RNA. These data could be useful in recommending the use of whole blood instead of plasma for the molecular diagnosis of acute symptomatic and asymptomatic Zika virus infections and for the safety of whole blood and blood components from donors, as well as for the safety of organs, tissues, and cells from deceased and living donors.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[This information should be useful for blood banks screening for Zika virus presence. - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[6] Virus in banked sperm\nDate: Tue 14 Mar 2017 0351 GMT\nSource: CNN [edited]\nhttp://edition.cnn.com/2017/03/13/health/zika-florida-sperm-warning/index.html\n\n\nSperm donated in 3 Florida counties since [15 Jun 2016] may be infected with the Zika virus, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention cautioned [Mon 13 Mar 2017]. \"When semen is donated it can be stored frozen for periods of time. It does not necessarily inactivate Zika, so it could be stored in tissue banks, used subsequently, and people should be made aware,\" said Dr Peter Marks, director of the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research at the US Food and Drug Administration. He went on to say having this information can help individuals make informed decisions and they \"might want to use these donations from other sources.\" Sources other than the 12 sperm banks in Miami-Dade, Palm Beach, and Broward counties of Florida, that is.\n\nThe agency had previously designated only Miami-Dade County as an area to take precautions after the 1st local transmission of the virus in the continental United States was confirmed in the Wynwood neighborhood of Miami in July [2016]. The area was declared Zika free in December [2016].\n\nThe 1st known sexual transmission of Zika virus in US was 8 years ago. However, the CDC is now warning anyone in Palm Beach and Broward counties to also consider themselves at an increased risk for the virus. This applies to anyone who has traveled to or between these 3 counties since 15 Jun 2016, a change from previous guidance that designated 29 Jun [2016] as the start of the increased risk period.\n\nIt is possible that someone could have Zika without knowing, because an estimated 80 percent of those infected have no symptoms. When symptoms occur, they can include fever, rash, joint pain, and red eyes, and they can last from a few days to about a week.\n\nPregnant women are at greatest risk because they can unknowingly pass the virus to their fetus, causing devastating consequences including miscarriage and neurological deficits that last a lifetime.\n\nBecause the virus can also be sexually transmitted, pregnant women or those trying to become pregnant have been advised to avoid unprotected sex with a partner who has been infected or who has lived in or traveled to an area where the virus is circulating.\n\nThe ongoing investigation into reported cases of the virus in Florida has found that residents of Miami-Dade, Palm Beach, and Broward counties travel frequently between the counties and either forget, or fail to, consider that they've visited an area of increased risk, thus not realizing they could be infected.\n\nWomen who live in these 3 counties who have become pregnant since 15 Jun [2016] are advised to speak with their physicians about the potential increased risk as are women who want to use a sperm donation from a donor in these counties, advised Dr. Denise Jamieson, incident commander for the CDC Zika emergency response and chief of the women's health and fertility branch at the CDC's division of reproductive health.\n\nCDC officials said they are acting only out of an abundance of caution and there have not been any reports of the virus being transmitted through donated sperm.\n\n\"Now we understand more than we did months ago is that evidence of the Zika virus is present in semen for up to 3 months after a man is infected and people may not have accurately recalled potential exposure [to the virus] especially if in a local area,\" said Dr Matthew Kuehnert, who is part of the CDC Zika emergency response team and director of the CDC office of blood, organ and other tissue safety.\n\nUnlike blood donations, which are routinely screened for the virus in the United States, there is no available test to screen semen for Zika. The existing test is still in the research phase and accuracy is being assessed, which is why men in these counties should not donate sperm. Their donated sperm may be infected.\n\nThe Florida Department of Health last reported a case of local transmission of the virus on [2 Mar 2017]. However, that report included confirmation of 2 cases from October of last year [2016]. A 3rd case was also reported then but this was an individual who donated blood in January [2017] and through routine blood screening was found to have previously been infected but no longer had an active case of the virus.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Although this may seem like an over precautious stance, the risk of Zika virus transmission from donated sperm is small but real. The consequence of fetal infections is serious for families that have to deal with the consequences of a child with microcephaly or other birth defects. - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[7] _Culex quinquefasciatus_ and _Aedes taeniorhynchus_ refractory\nDate: March 2017 [ahead of print]\nSource: Emerging Infectious Diseases journal [edited]\nhttps://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/23/3/16-1636_article\n\n\nRef: Hart CE, Roundy CM, Azar SR, et al: Zika virus vector competency of mosquitoes, Gulf Coast, United States.

We applied multiple sequencing approaches to generate 100 ZIKV genomes from clinical and mosquito samples from 10 countries and territories, greatly expanding the observed viral genetic diversity from this outbreak. We analyzed the timing and patterns of introductions into distinct geographic regions, confirming phylogenetic evidence for the origin and rapid expansion of the outbreak in Brazil, and for multiple introductions from Brazil into Honduras, Colombia, Puerto Rico, other Caribbean islands, and the continental US. We find that ZIKV circulated undetected in many regions of the Americas for up to a year before the 1st locally transmitted cases were confirmed, highlighting the challenge of effective surveillance for this virus. We further characterize genetic variation across the outbreak to identify mutations with possible functional implications for ZIKV biology and pathogenesis.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n[This report provides a recent historical overview of Zika virus in the Americas.

To date, 48 countries and territories in the Americas have confirmed autochthonous, vector-borne transmission of Zika virus since 2015 (Figure 1). In addition, 5 countries in the Americas have reported sexually transmitted Zika cases.\n\nFigure 1 [map]. Countries and territories in the Americas with confirmed autochthonous (vector-borne) Zika virus cases, 2015 - 2017.\n[Footnote to map:\n(1) Anguilla; Antigua and Barbuda; Argentina; Aruba; the Bahamas; Barbados; Belize; Bolivia (Plurinational State of); Bonaire, Sint Eustatius, and Saba; Brazil; the British Virgin Islands; Cayman Islands; Colombia; Costa Rica; Cuba; Cura\u00e7ao; Dominica; the Dominican Republic; Ecuador; El Salvador; French Guiana; Grenada; Guadeloupe; Guatemala; Guyana; Haiti; Honduras; Jamaica; Martinique; Mexico; Montserrat; Nicaragua; Panama; Paraguay; Peru; Puerto Rico; Saint Barth\u00e9lemy; Saint Kitts and Nevis; Saint Lucia; Saint Martin; Saint Vincent and the Grenadines; Sint Maarten; Suriname; Trinidad and Tobago; Turks and Caicos Islands; the United States of America; the United States Virgin Islands; and Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of).\n(2) Argentina, Canada, Chile, Peru, and the United States of America.\n\nNorth America\nIn the United States of America, the Florida Department of Health reported isolated local transmission cases.\n\nIn Mexico, new cases continue to be reported, although they have been decreasing since EW 40 of 2016 [week ending 7 Oct 2016].\n\nCentral America\nThe number of reported cases in Central America continues to decrease, with a weekly average of 335 cases, 275 suspected, and 60 confirmed, in the last 4 weeks (EW 6 to EW 9 of 2017) [4 Feb-3 Mar 2017].\n\nIn Costa Rica a slight increase of suspected and confirmed cases was reported in EW 5 of 2017 [week ending 3 Feb 2017].\n\nIn Panama there was increasing trend of suspected and confirmed cases between EW 30 of 2016 and EW 1 of 2017 [23 Jul 2016-6 Jan 2017]. Although there was a decrease in EW 2 of 2017 [week ending 13 Jan 2017], suspected and confirmed cases continue to be reported at a weekly average of 229 suspected and confirmed cases in the last 4 weeks.\n\nCaribbean\nIn Aruba an increasing trend in suspected and confirmed cases was reported between EW 29 of 2016 and EW 4 of 2017 [16 Jul 2016-27 Jan 2017]. In the last 4 weeks, there was a weekly average of 53 suspected and confirmed cases.\n\nIn Cura\u00e7ao, there is an increasing trend in the number of suspected and confirmed cases between EW 31 and EW 47 of 2016 [30 Jul-25 Nov 2017].\n\nIn Guadeloupe and Martinique a low circulation of the virus continues to be reported with a few sporadic confirmed cases in the last five weeks (EW 1 of EW 5 of 2017) [1 Jan-3 Feb 2017].\n\nWhile other countries and territories in the Caribbean continue to report cases, there is a decreasing trend in the sub-region with a weekly average of 340 cases in the last 4 weeks.\n\nSouth America\nIn Argentina in EW 8 of 2017 [week ending 24 Feb 2017], 2 autochthonous cases were confirmed for the 1st time in the province of Salta (one case) and in the province of Chaco (one case), the latter case had a history of having stayed in the province of Formosa during the probable period of infection. In 2016, autochthonous cases had been confirmed in the provinces of C\u00f3rdoba and Tucum\u00e1n.\n\nIn Paraguay, the trend of suspected cases increased between EW 42 of 2016 and EW 5 of 2017 [14 Oct 2016-3 Feb 2017].\n\nIn Peru, there was an increase in the number of cases reported between EW 1 and EW 3 of 2017 [1 Jan-20 Jan 2017]; the increase is related to an outbreak occurring in the department of Loreto. In 2017 cases were reported in new districts of the departments of Loreto, San Mart\u00edn, and Ucayali.\n\nIn other countries of South America, the number of cases reported remains stable with a weekly average of 396 cases (353 suspected and 43 confirmed) in the last 4 weeks.\n\nTrend in the Caribbean, Central America, and South America\nFigure 2 shows the trend of suspected and confirmed cases in the Caribbean, Central America, and South America. Incidence rate peaked in EW 7 of 2016 [week ending 19 Feb 2016] for all 3 sub-regions; from that point onwards in Central America and South America a downward trend occurs. In contrast, in the Caribbean, a growing trend occurred with a peak observed in EW 23 of 2016 [week ending 10 Jun 2016]. Since EW 40 of 2016 [week ending 7 Oct 2016], the trend has remained stable in all 3 sub-regions.\n\nFigure 2 [graph]. Distribution of incidence rate by EW and sub-region.

Emerg Infect Dis. 2017; 23(3): 405-14. doi: 10.3201/eid2303.161499\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nAbstract\n--------\nZika virus is causally linked with congenital microcephaly and may be associated with pregnancy loss. However, the mechanisms of Zika virus intrauterine transmission and replication and its tropism and persistence in tissues are poorly understood. We tested tissues from 52 case-patients: 8 infants with microcephaly who died and 44 women suspected of being infected with Zika virus during pregnancy. By reverse transcription PCR, tissues from 32 (62 percent) case-patients (brains from 8 infants with microcephaly and placental/fetal tissues from 24 women) were positive for Zika virus. In situ hybridization localized replicative Zika virus RNA in brains of 7 infants and in placentas of 9 women who had pregnancy losses during the 1st or 2nd trimester. These findings demonstrate that Zika virus replicates and persists in fetal brains and placentas, providing direct evidence of its association with microcephaly. Tissue-based reverse transcription PCR extends the time frame of Zika virus detection in congenital and pregnancy-associated infections.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The evidence of Zika virus infection of and persistence in fetal tissues and the placenta continue to accumulate. This study adds to those observations.\n\nA 9 Mar 2017 report indicates that a new study shows the human fetus may be most vulnerable to Zika infection very early in pregnancy.

All but one patient developed a dangerous heart rhythm problem and 2/3 had evidence of heart failure, a condition in which the heart can't pump enough blood to meet the body's needs.\n\n\"Our report provides clear evidence that there is a relationship between the Zika virus infection and cardiovascular complications,\" said Karina Gonzalez Carta, MD, cardiologist and research fellow at the department of cardiovascular diseases at Mayo Clinic and the study's lead author. \"Based on these initial results, people need to be aware that if they travel to or live in a place with known Zika virus and develop a rash, fever or conjunctivitis, and within a short timeframe also feel other symptoms such as fatigue, shortness of breath or their heart skipping beats, they should see their doctor.\"\n\nCarta and her team were not entirely surprised by their findings as they follow trends seen with other mosquito-borne diseases known to affect the heart, including the dengue and chikungunya virus [infections]. However, she noted that the burden and severity of heart problems, including rapidly progressive heart failure and potentially life-threatening arrhythmias, among these patients was unexpected.\n\nThe 9 patients who were seen in the clinic in Caracas within one week of having Zika-type symptoms and who subsequently reported common symptoms of heart problems, most commonly palpitations followed by shortness of breath and fatigue, were included in this small, prospective case report. Only one patient had any previous cardiovascular problems (well-controlled high blood pressure), and lab tests confirmed that all had active Zika infection. Patients were asked to fill out a form to record their symptoms and underwent an initial electrocardiogram, a test that displays the electrical activity of the heart, which in 8 cases was suggestive of a problem with the rate or rhythm of their heartbeat. These findings prompted researchers to perform a full cardiovascular work up using an echocardiogram, (24-hour) Holter monitor, and a cardiac magnetic resonance imaging study. Of the 9 patients, 6 were female with a mean age of 47 \u00b1 17 years. They were followed for an average of 6 months, beginning in July 2016.\n\nDangerous arrhythmias were detected in 8 of the 9 patients: 3 cases of atrial fibrillation, 2 cases of non-sustained atrial tachycardia and 2 cases of ventricular arrhythmias, which can be deadly. Heart failure was present in 6 cases. Of these, 5 patients had heart failure with low ejection fraction -- when the amount of blood the heart is able to squeeze out is much less than what it normally would be -- and one had heart failure with preserved ejection fraction along with pre-eclampsia and a moderate to severe amount of fluid around the heart (called pericardial effusion). So far, none of the patients' cardiac issues have resolved, though symptoms are much improved due to guideline-directed treatment for heart failure or atrial fibrillation. Of note, cardiovascular symptoms tend to manifest later in the process. Data show an average lag of 10 days from patients' initial complaints of Zika symptoms to reports of symptoms suggestive of heart problems.\n\n\"Since the majority of people with Zika virus infections present with mild or non-specific symptoms and symptoms of cardiovascular complications may not occur right away, we need to raise awareness about the possible association,\" Carta said.\n\nAlthough cardiovascular manifestations are fairly rare against the total number of patients treated at the clinic, Carta believes many more cases will be diagnosed, not only in patients with clear symptoms, but also among those with less severe or no signs of myocarditis, an inflammation of the myocardium, the middle layer of the heart wall. Myocarditis can affect the heart's muscle and electrical system.\n\n\"It's likely that many more people are affected, especially as many clinicians and people may not make the connection between symptoms,\" Carta said. \"We need larger, systematic studies to understand the actual risk of Zika-related cardiac problems and what makes one patient more prone to develop them.\"\n\nFor now, she advises that people who are traveling to areas with known Zika virus consider talking with their doctor so they know what basic measures can be taken to prevent infection. Researchers are continuing to follow these patients and are setting up new strategies to screen more patients for cardiovascular problems.\n\nSymptoms of the Zika virus usually include mild fever, skin rash, conjunctivitis (pink eye), muscle and joint pain, malaise or headache, which typically last for 2 to 7 days, according to the World Health Organization. The best way to prevent the Zika virus is by preventing mosquito bites.\n\nWhile this study points to another potential risk of Zika virus infection, it is limited due to its small size. What remains unclear is whether and how the Zika virus might affect people with existing heart disease. However, Carta says that based on our knowledge of other arboviral infections, patients who have pre-existing cardiovascular disease tend to have worse outcomes.\n\nCarta will present the study, \"Myocarditis, Heart Failure and Arrhythmias in Patients With Zika,\" on Sat 18 Mar 2017, at the American College of Cardiology's 66th Annual Scientific Session in Washington.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Zika virus infections continue to provide unpleasant surprises.

Emerg Infect Dis. 2017; 23(5); doi: 10.3201/eid2305.161631\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nAbstract\n--------\nWe tested whole-blood and plasma samples from immunocompetent patients who had had benign Zika virus infections and found that Zika virus RNA persisted in whole blood substantially longer than in plasma. This finding may have implications for diagnosis of acute symptomatic and asymptomatic infections and for testing of blood donations.\n\n[Results]\n---------\nResults from the follow-up (18 whole-blood and 21 plasma samples) showed that the median duration of Zika virus was 22 (range 14-100) days in whole blood and 10 (range 7-37) days in plasma (p=0.058). Mean viral loads of positive samples were 3.39 log copies/mL in whole blood (n=13) and 2.52 log copies/mL in plasma (n=6; p=0.001). Viral loads in the last positive samples varied from 2.7 to 3.9 log copies/mL in whole blood and 2.2 to 2.8 log copies/mL in plasma (p=0.06). Whole-blood samples from 2 patients remained positive at 14 and 63 days after their plasma samples had become negative.\n\n[Conclusion]\n------------\nOverall, our data show that use of whole-blood specimens is much more sensitive than use of plasma samples to detect Zika virus RNA. These data could be useful in recommending the use of whole blood instead of plasma for the molecular diagnosis of acute symptomatic and asymptomatic Zika virus infections and for the safety of whole blood and blood components from donors, as well as for the safety of organs, tissues, and cells from deceased and living donors.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[This information should be useful for blood banks screening for Zika virus presence. - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[6] Virus in banked sperm\nDate: Tue 14 Mar 2017 0351 GMT\nSource: CNN [edited]\nhttp://edition.cnn.com/2017/03/13/health/zika-florida-sperm-warning/index.html\n\n\nSperm donated in 3 Florida counties since [15 Jun 2016] may be infected with the Zika virus, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention cautioned [Mon 13 Mar 2017]. \"When semen is donated it can be stored frozen for periods of time. It does not necessarily inactivate Zika, so it could be stored in tissue banks, used subsequently, and people should be made aware,\" said Dr Peter Marks, director of the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research at the US Food and Drug Administration. He went on to say having this information can help individuals make informed decisions and they \"might want to use these donations from other sources.\" Sources other than the 12 sperm banks in Miami-Dade, Palm Beach, and Broward counties of Florida, that is.\n\nThe agency had previously designated only Miami-Dade County as an area to take precautions after the 1st local transmission of the virus in the continental United States was confirmed in the Wynwood neighborhood of Miami in July [2016]. The area was declared Zika free in December [2016].\n\nThe 1st known sexual transmission of Zika virus in US was 8 years ago. However, the CDC is now warning anyone in Palm Beach and Broward counties to also consider themselves at an increased risk for the virus. This applies to anyone who has traveled to or between these 3 counties since 15 Jun 2016, a change from previous guidance that designated 29 Jun [2016] as the start of the increased risk period.\n\nIt is possible that someone could have Zika without knowing, because an estimated 80 percent of those infected have no symptoms. When symptoms occur, they can include fever, rash, joint pain, and red eyes, and they can last from a few days to about a week.\n\nPregnant women are at greatest risk because they can unknowingly pass the virus to their fetus, causing devastating consequences including miscarriage and neurological deficits that last a lifetime.\n\nBecause the virus can also be sexually transmitted, pregnant women or those trying to become pregnant have been advised to avoid unprotected sex with a partner who has been infected or who has lived in or traveled to an area where the virus is circulating.\n\nThe ongoing investigation into reported cases of the virus in Florida has found that residents of Miami-Dade, Palm Beach, and Broward counties travel frequently between the counties and either forget, or fail to, consider that they've visited an area of increased risk, thus not realizing they could be infected.\n\nWomen who live in these 3 counties who have become pregnant since 15 Jun [2016] are advised to speak with their physicians about the potential increased risk as are women who want to use a sperm donation from a donor in these counties, advised Dr. Denise Jamieson, incident commander for the CDC Zika emergency response and chief of the women's health and fertility branch at the CDC's division of reproductive health.\n\nCDC officials said they are acting only out of an abundance of caution and there have not been any reports of the virus being transmitted through donated sperm.\n\n\"Now we understand more than we did months ago is that evidence of the Zika virus is present in semen for up to 3 months after a man is infected and people may not have accurately recalled potential exposure [to the virus] especially if in a local area,\" said Dr Matthew Kuehnert, who is part of the CDC Zika emergency response team and director of the CDC office of blood, organ and other tissue safety.\n\nUnlike blood donations, which are routinely screened for the virus in the United States, there is no available test to screen semen for Zika. The existing test is still in the research phase and accuracy is being assessed, which is why men in these counties should not donate sperm. Their donated sperm may be infected.\n\nThe Florida Department of Health last reported a case of local transmission of the virus on [2 Mar 2017]. However, that report included confirmation of 2 cases from October of last year [2016]. A 3rd case was also reported then but this was an individual who donated blood in January [2017] and through routine blood screening was found to have previously been infected but no longer had an active case of the virus.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Although this may seem like an over precautious stance, the risk of Zika virus transmission from donated sperm is small but real. The consequence of fetal infections is serious for families that have to deal with the consequences of a child with microcephaly or other birth defects. - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[7] _Culex quinquefasciatus_ and _Aedes taeniorhynchus_ refractory\nDate: March 2017 [ahead of print]\nSource: Emerging Infectious Diseases journal [edited]\nhttps://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/23/3/16-1636_article\n\n\nRef: Hart CE, Roundy CM, Azar SR, et al: Zika virus vector competency of mosquitoes, Gulf Coast, United States.

We applied multiple sequencing approaches to generate 100 ZIKV genomes from clinical and mosquito samples from 10 countries and territories, greatly expanding the observed viral genetic diversity from this outbreak. We analyzed the timing and patterns of introductions into distinct geographic regions, confirming phylogenetic evidence for the origin and rapid expansion of the outbreak in Brazil, and for multiple introductions from Brazil into Honduras, Colombia, Puerto Rico, other Caribbean islands, and the continental US. We find that ZIKV circulated undetected in many regions of the Americas for up to a year before the 1st locally transmitted cases were confirmed, highlighting the challenge of effective surveillance for this virus. We further characterize genetic variation across the outbreak to identify mutations with possible functional implications for ZIKV biology and pathogenesis.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n[This report provides a recent historical overview of Zika virus in the Americas.

To date, 48 countries and territories in the Americas have confirmed autochthonous, vector-borne transmission of Zika virus since 2015 (Figure 1). In addition, 5 countries in the Americas have reported sexually transmitted Zika cases.\n\nFigure 1 [map]. Countries and territories in the Americas with confirmed autochthonous (vector-borne) Zika virus cases, 2015 - 2017.\n[Footnote to map:\n(1) Anguilla; Antigua and Barbuda; Argentina; Aruba; the Bahamas; Barbados; Belize; Bolivia (Plurinational State of); Bonaire, Sint Eustatius, and Saba; Brazil; the British Virgin Islands; Cayman Islands; Colombia; Costa Rica; Cuba; Cura\u00e7ao; Dominica; the Dominican Republic; Ecuador; El Salvador; French Guiana; Grenada; Guadeloupe; Guatemala; Guyana; Haiti; Honduras; Jamaica; Martinique; Mexico; Montserrat; Nicaragua; Panama; Paraguay; Peru; Puerto Rico; Saint Barth\u00e9lemy; Saint Kitts and Nevis; Saint Lucia; Saint Martin; Saint Vincent and the Grenadines; Sint Maarten; Suriname; Trinidad and Tobago; Turks and Caicos Islands; the United States of America; the United States Virgin Islands; and Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of).\n(2) Argentina, Canada, Chile, Peru, and the United States of America.\n\nNorth America\nIn the United States of America, the Florida Department of Health reported isolated local transmission cases.\n\nIn Mexico, new cases continue to be reported, although they have been decreasing since EW 40 of 2016 [week ending 7 Oct 2016].\n\nCentral America\nThe number of reported cases in Central America continues to decrease, with a weekly average of 335 cases, 275 suspected, and 60 confirmed, in the last 4 weeks (EW 6 to EW 9 of 2017) [4 Feb-3 Mar 2017].\n\nIn Costa Rica a slight increase of suspected and confirmed cases was reported in EW 5 of 2017 [week ending 3 Feb 2017].\n\nIn Panama there was increasing trend of suspected and confirmed cases between EW 30 of 2016 and EW 1 of 2017 [23 Jul 2016-6 Jan 2017]. Although there was a decrease in EW 2 of 2017 [week ending 13 Jan 2017], suspected and confirmed cases continue to be reported at a weekly average of 229 suspected and confirmed cases in the last 4 weeks.\n\nCaribbean\nIn Aruba an increasing trend in suspected and confirmed cases was reported between EW 29 of 2016 and EW 4 of 2017 [16 Jul 2016-27 Jan 2017]. In the last 4 weeks, there was a weekly average of 53 suspected and confirmed cases.\n\nIn Cura\u00e7ao, there is an increasing trend in the number of suspected and confirmed cases between EW 31 and EW 47 of 2016 [30 Jul-25 Nov 2017].\n\nIn Guadeloupe and Martinique a low circulation of the virus continues to be reported with a few sporadic confirmed cases in the last five weeks (EW 1 of EW 5 of 2017) [1 Jan-3 Feb 2017].\n\nWhile other countries and territories in the Caribbean continue to report cases, there is a decreasing trend in the sub-region with a weekly average of 340 cases in the last 4 weeks.\n\nSouth America\nIn Argentina in EW 8 of 2017 [week ending 24 Feb 2017], 2 autochthonous cases were confirmed for the 1st time in the province of Salta (one case) and in the province of Chaco (one case), the latter case had a history of having stayed in the province of Formosa during the probable period of infection. In 2016, autochthonous cases had been confirmed in the provinces of C\u00f3rdoba and Tucum\u00e1n.\n\nIn Paraguay, the trend of suspected cases increased between EW 42 of 2016 and EW 5 of 2017 [14 Oct 2016-3 Feb 2017].\n\nIn Peru, there was an increase in the number of cases reported between EW 1 and EW 3 of 2017 [1 Jan-20 Jan 2017]; the increase is related to an outbreak occurring in the department of Loreto. In 2017 cases were reported in new districts of the departments of Loreto, San Mart\u00edn, and Ucayali.\n\nIn other countries of South America, the number of cases reported remains stable with a weekly average of 396 cases (353 suspected and 43 confirmed) in the last 4 weeks.\n\nTrend in the Caribbean, Central America, and South America\nFigure 2 shows the trend of suspected and confirmed cases in the Caribbean, Central America, and South America. Incidence rate peaked in EW 7 of 2016 [week ending 19 Feb 2016] for all 3 sub-regions; from that point onwards in Central America and South America a downward trend occurs. In contrast, in the Caribbean, a growing trend occurred with a peak observed in EW 23 of 2016 [week ending 10 Jun 2016]. Since EW 40 of 2016 [week ending 7 Oct 2016], the trend has remained stable in all 3 sub-regions.\n\nFigure 2 [graph]. Distribution of incidence rate by EW and sub-region.

Emerg Infect Dis. 2017; 23(3): 405-14. doi: 10.3201/eid2303.161499\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nAbstract\n--------\nZika virus is causally linked with congenital microcephaly and may be associated with pregnancy loss. However, the mechanisms of Zika virus intrauterine transmission and replication and its tropism and persistence in tissues are poorly understood. We tested tissues from 52 case-patients: 8 infants with microcephaly who died and 44 women suspected of being infected with Zika virus during pregnancy. By reverse transcription PCR, tissues from 32 (62 percent) case-patients (brains from 8 infants with microcephaly and placental/fetal tissues from 24 women) were positive for Zika virus. In situ hybridization localized replicative Zika virus RNA in brains of 7 infants and in placentas of 9 women who had pregnancy losses during the 1st or 2nd trimester. These findings demonstrate that Zika virus replicates and persists in fetal brains and placentas, providing direct evidence of its association with microcephaly. Tissue-based reverse transcription PCR extends the time frame of Zika virus detection in congenital and pregnancy-associated infections.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The evidence of Zika virus infection of and persistence in fetal tissues and the placenta continue to accumulate. This study adds to those observations.\n\nA 9 Mar 2017 report indicates that a new study shows the human fetus may be most vulnerable to Zika infection very early in pregnancy.

All but one patient developed a dangerous heart rhythm problem and 2/3 had evidence of heart failure, a condition in which the heart can't pump enough blood to meet the body's needs.\n\n\"Our report provides clear evidence that there is a relationship between the Zika virus infection and cardiovascular complications,\" said Karina Gonzalez Carta, MD, cardiologist and research fellow at the department of cardiovascular diseases at Mayo Clinic and the study's lead author. \"Based on these initial results, people need to be aware that if they travel to or live in a place with known Zika virus and develop a rash, fever or conjunctivitis, and within a short timeframe also feel other symptoms such as fatigue, shortness of breath or their heart skipping beats, they should see their doctor.\"\n\nCarta and her team were not entirely surprised by their findings as they follow trends seen with other mosquito-borne diseases known to affect the heart, including the dengue and chikungunya virus [infections]. However, she noted that the burden and severity of heart problems, including rapidly progressive heart failure and potentially life-threatening arrhythmias, among these patients was unexpected.\n\nThe 9 patients who were seen in the clinic in Caracas within one week of having Zika-type symptoms and who subsequently reported common symptoms of heart problems, most commonly palpitations followed by shortness of breath and fatigue, were included in this small, prospective case report. Only one patient had any previous cardiovascular problems (well-controlled high blood pressure), and lab tests confirmed that all had active Zika infection. Patients were asked to fill out a form to record their symptoms and underwent an initial electrocardiogram, a test that displays the electrical activity of the heart, which in 8 cases was suggestive of a problem with the rate or rhythm of their heartbeat. These findings prompted researchers to perform a full cardiovascular work up using an echocardiogram, (24-hour) Holter monitor, and a cardiac magnetic resonance imaging study. Of the 9 patients, 6 were female with a mean age of 47 \u00b1 17 years. They were followed for an average of 6 months, beginning in July 2016.\n\nDangerous arrhythmias were detected in 8 of the 9 patients: 3 cases of atrial fibrillation, 2 cases of non-sustained atrial tachycardia and 2 cases of ventricular arrhythmias, which can be deadly. Heart failure was present in 6 cases. Of these, 5 patients had heart failure with low ejection fraction -- when the amount of blood the heart is able to squeeze out is much less than what it normally would be -- and one had heart failure with preserved ejection fraction along with pre-eclampsia and a moderate to severe amount of fluid around the heart (called pericardial effusion). So far, none of the patients' cardiac issues have resolved, though symptoms are much improved due to guideline-directed treatment for heart failure or atrial fibrillation. Of note, cardiovascular symptoms tend to manifest later in the process. Data show an average lag of 10 days from patients' initial complaints of Zika symptoms to reports of symptoms suggestive of heart problems.\n\n\"Since the majority of people with Zika virus infections present with mild or non-specific symptoms and symptoms of cardiovascular complications may not occur right away, we need to raise awareness about the possible association,\" Carta said.\n\nAlthough cardiovascular manifestations are fairly rare against the total number of patients treated at the clinic, Carta believes many more cases will be diagnosed, not only in patients with clear symptoms, but also among those with less severe or no signs of myocarditis, an inflammation of the myocardium, the middle layer of the heart wall. Myocarditis can affect the heart's muscle and electrical system.\n\n\"It's likely that many more people are affected, especially as many clinicians and people may not make the connection between symptoms,\" Carta said. \"We need larger, systematic studies to understand the actual risk of Zika-related cardiac problems and what makes one patient more prone to develop them.\"\n\nFor now, she advises that people who are traveling to areas with known Zika virus consider talking with their doctor so they know what basic measures can be taken to prevent infection. Researchers are continuing to follow these patients and are setting up new strategies to screen more patients for cardiovascular problems.\n\nSymptoms of the Zika virus usually include mild fever, skin rash, conjunctivitis (pink eye), muscle and joint pain, malaise or headache, which typically last for 2 to 7 days, according to the World Health Organization. The best way to prevent the Zika virus is by preventing mosquito bites.\n\nWhile this study points to another potential risk of Zika virus infection, it is limited due to its small size. What remains unclear is whether and how the Zika virus might affect people with existing heart disease. However, Carta says that based on our knowledge of other arboviral infections, patients who have pre-existing cardiovascular disease tend to have worse outcomes.\n\nCarta will present the study, \"Myocarditis, Heart Failure and Arrhythmias in Patients With Zika,\" on Sat 18 Mar 2017, at the American College of Cardiology's 66th Annual Scientific Session in Washington.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Zika virus infections continue to provide unpleasant surprises.

Emerg Infect Dis. 2017; 23(5); doi: 10.3201/eid2305.161631\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nAbstract\n--------\nWe tested whole-blood and plasma samples from immunocompetent patients who had had benign Zika virus infections and found that Zika virus RNA persisted in whole blood substantially longer than in plasma. This finding may have implications for diagnosis of acute symptomatic and asymptomatic infections and for testing of blood donations.\n\n[Results]\n---------\nResults from the follow-up (18 whole-blood and 21 plasma samples) showed that the median duration of Zika virus was 22 (range 14-100) days in whole blood and 10 (range 7-37) days in plasma (p=0.058). Mean viral loads of positive samples were 3.39 log copies/mL in whole blood (n=13) and 2.52 log copies/mL in plasma (n=6; p=0.001). Viral loads in the last positive samples varied from 2.7 to 3.9 log copies/mL in whole blood and 2.2 to 2.8 log copies/mL in plasma (p=0.06). Whole-blood samples from 2 patients remained positive at 14 and 63 days after their plasma samples had become negative.\n\n[Conclusion]\n------------\nOverall, our data show that use of whole-blood specimens is much more sensitive than use of plasma samples to detect Zika virus RNA. These data could be useful in recommending the use of whole blood instead of plasma for the molecular diagnosis of acute symptomatic and asymptomatic Zika virus infections and for the safety of whole blood and blood components from donors, as well as for the safety of organs, tissues, and cells from deceased and living donors.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[This information should be useful for blood banks screening for Zika virus presence. - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[6] Virus in banked sperm\nDate: Tue 14 Mar 2017 0351 GMT\nSource: CNN [edited]\nhttp://edition.cnn.com/2017/03/13/health/zika-florida-sperm-warning/index.html\n\n\nSperm donated in 3 Florida counties since [15 Jun 2016] may be infected with the Zika virus, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention cautioned [Mon 13 Mar 2017]. \"When semen is donated it can be stored frozen for periods of time. It does not necessarily inactivate Zika, so it could be stored in tissue banks, used subsequently, and people should be made aware,\" said Dr Peter Marks, director of the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research at the US Food and Drug Administration. He went on to say having this information can help individuals make informed decisions and they \"might want to use these donations from other sources.\" Sources other than the 12 sperm banks in Miami-Dade, Palm Beach, and Broward counties of Florida, that is.\n\nThe agency had previously designated only Miami-Dade County as an area to take precautions after the 1st local transmission of the virus in the continental United States was confirmed in the Wynwood neighborhood of Miami in July [2016]. The area was declared Zika free in December [2016].\n\nThe 1st known sexual transmission of Zika virus in US was 8 years ago. However, the CDC is now warning anyone in Palm Beach and Broward counties to also consider themselves at an increased risk for the virus. This applies to anyone who has traveled to or between these 3 counties since 15 Jun 2016, a change from previous guidance that designated 29 Jun [2016] as the start of the increased risk period.\n\nIt is possible that someone could have Zika without knowing, because an estimated 80 percent of those infected have no symptoms. When symptoms occur, they can include fever, rash, joint pain, and red eyes, and they can last from a few days to about a week.\n\nPregnant women are at greatest risk because they can unknowingly pass the virus to their fetus, causing devastating consequences including miscarriage and neurological deficits that last a lifetime.\n\nBecause the virus can also be sexually transmitted, pregnant women or those trying to become pregnant have been advised to avoid unprotected sex with a partner who has been infected or who has lived in or traveled to an area where the virus is circulating.\n\nThe ongoing investigation into reported cases of the virus in Florida has found that residents of Miami-Dade, Palm Beach, and Broward counties travel frequently between the counties and either forget, or fail to, consider that they've visited an area of increased risk, thus not realizing they could be infected.\n\nWomen who live in these 3 counties who have become pregnant since 15 Jun [2016] are advised to speak with their physicians about the potential increased risk as are women who want to use a sperm donation from a donor in these counties, advised Dr. Denise Jamieson, incident commander for the CDC Zika emergency response and chief of the women's health and fertility branch at the CDC's division of reproductive health.\n\nCDC officials said they are acting only out of an abundance of caution and there have not been any reports of the virus being transmitted through donated sperm.\n\n\"Now we understand more than we did months ago is that evidence of the Zika virus is present in semen for up to 3 months after a man is infected and people may not have accurately recalled potential exposure [to the virus] especially if in a local area,\" said Dr Matthew Kuehnert, who is part of the CDC Zika emergency response team and director of the CDC office of blood, organ and other tissue safety.\n\nUnlike blood donations, which are routinely screened for the virus in the United States, there is no available test to screen semen for Zika. The existing test is still in the research phase and accuracy is being assessed, which is why men in these counties should not donate sperm. Their donated sperm may be infected.\n\nThe Florida Department of Health last reported a case of local transmission of the virus on [2 Mar 2017]. However, that report included confirmation of 2 cases from October of last year [2016]. A 3rd case was also reported then but this was an individual who donated blood in January [2017] and through routine blood screening was found to have previously been infected but no longer had an active case of the virus.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Although this may seem like an over precautious stance, the risk of Zika virus transmission from donated sperm is small but real. The consequence of fetal infections is serious for families that have to deal with the consequences of a child with microcephaly or other birth defects. - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[7] _Culex quinquefasciatus_ and _Aedes taeniorhynchus_ refractory\nDate: March 2017 [ahead of print]\nSource: Emerging Infectious Diseases journal [edited]\nhttps://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/23/3/16-1636_article\n\n\nRef: Hart CE, Roundy CM, Azar SR, et al: Zika virus vector competency of mosquitoes, Gulf Coast, United States.

We applied multiple sequencing approaches to generate 100 ZIKV genomes from clinical and mosquito samples from 10 countries and territories, greatly expanding the observed viral genetic diversity from this outbreak. We analyzed the timing and patterns of introductions into distinct geographic regions, confirming phylogenetic evidence for the origin and rapid expansion of the outbreak in Brazil, and for multiple introductions from Brazil into Honduras, Colombia, Puerto Rico, other Caribbean islands, and the continental US. We find that ZIKV circulated undetected in many regions of the Americas for up to a year before the 1st locally transmitted cases were confirmed, highlighting the challenge of effective surveillance for this virus. We further characterize genetic variation across the outbreak to identify mutations with possible functional implications for ZIKV biology and pathogenesis.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n[This report provides a recent historical overview of Zika virus in the Americas.

To date, 48 countries and territories in the Americas have confirmed autochthonous, vector-borne transmission of Zika virus since 2015 (Figure 1). In addition, 5 countries in the Americas have reported sexually transmitted Zika cases.\n\nFigure 1 [map]. Countries and territories in the Americas with confirmed autochthonous (vector-borne) Zika virus cases, 2015 - 2017.\n[Footnote to map:\n(1) Anguilla; Antigua and Barbuda; Argentina; Aruba; the Bahamas; Barbados; Belize; Bolivia (Plurinational State of); Bonaire, Sint Eustatius, and Saba; Brazil; the British Virgin Islands; Cayman Islands; Colombia; Costa Rica; Cuba; Cura\u00e7ao; Dominica; the Dominican Republic; Ecuador; El Salvador; French Guiana; Grenada; Guadeloupe; Guatemala; Guyana; Haiti; Honduras; Jamaica; Martinique; Mexico; Montserrat; Nicaragua; Panama; Paraguay; Peru; Puerto Rico; Saint Barth\u00e9lemy; Saint Kitts and Nevis; Saint Lucia; Saint Martin; Saint Vincent and the Grenadines; Sint Maarten; Suriname; Trinidad and Tobago; Turks and Caicos Islands; the United States of America; the United States Virgin Islands; and Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of).\n(2) Argentina, Canada, Chile, Peru, and the United States of America.\n\nNorth America\nIn the United States of America, the Florida Department of Health reported isolated local transmission cases.\n\nIn Mexico, new cases continue to be reported, although they have been decreasing since EW 40 of 2016 [week ending 7 Oct 2016].\n\nCentral America\nThe number of reported cases in Central America continues to decrease, with a weekly average of 335 cases, 275 suspected, and 60 confirmed, in the last 4 weeks (EW 6 to EW 9 of 2017) [4 Feb-3 Mar 2017].\n\nIn Costa Rica a slight increase of suspected and confirmed cases was reported in EW 5 of 2017 [week ending 3 Feb 2017].\n\nIn Panama there was increasing trend of suspected and confirmed cases between EW 30 of 2016 and EW 1 of 2017 [23 Jul 2016-6 Jan 2017]. Although there was a decrease in EW 2 of 2017 [week ending 13 Jan 2017], suspected and confirmed cases continue to be reported at a weekly average of 229 suspected and confirmed cases in the last 4 weeks.\n\nCaribbean\nIn Aruba an increasing trend in suspected and confirmed cases was reported between EW 29 of 2016 and EW 4 of 2017 [16 Jul 2016-27 Jan 2017]. In the last 4 weeks, there was a weekly average of 53 suspected and confirmed cases.\n\nIn Cura\u00e7ao, there is an increasing trend in the number of suspected and confirmed cases between EW 31 and EW 47 of 2016 [30 Jul-25 Nov 2017].\n\nIn Guadeloupe and Martinique a low circulation of the virus continues to be reported with a few sporadic confirmed cases in the last five weeks (EW 1 of EW 5 of 2017) [1 Jan-3 Feb 2017].\n\nWhile other countries and territories in the Caribbean continue to report cases, there is a decreasing trend in the sub-region with a weekly average of 340 cases in the last 4 weeks.\n\nSouth America\nIn Argentina in EW 8 of 2017 [week ending 24 Feb 2017], 2 autochthonous cases were confirmed for the 1st time in the province of Salta (one case) and in the province of Chaco (one case), the latter case had a history of having stayed in the province of Formosa during the probable period of infection. In 2016, autochthonous cases had been confirmed in the provinces of C\u00f3rdoba and Tucum\u00e1n.\n\nIn Paraguay, the trend of suspected cases increased between EW 42 of 2016 and EW 5 of 2017 [14 Oct 2016-3 Feb 2017].\n\nIn Peru, there was an increase in the number of cases reported between EW 1 and EW 3 of 2017 [1 Jan-20 Jan 2017]; the increase is related to an outbreak occurring in the department of Loreto. In 2017 cases were reported in new districts of the departments of Loreto, San Mart\u00edn, and Ucayali.\n\nIn other countries of South America, the number of cases reported remains stable with a weekly average of 396 cases (353 suspected and 43 confirmed) in the last 4 weeks.\n\nTrend in the Caribbean, Central America, and South America\nFigure 2 shows the trend of suspected and confirmed cases in the Caribbean, Central America, and South America. Incidence rate peaked in EW 7 of 2016 [week ending 19 Feb 2016] for all 3 sub-regions; from that point onwards in Central America and South America a downward trend occurs. In contrast, in the Caribbean, a growing trend occurred with a peak observed in EW 23 of 2016 [week ending 10 Jun 2016]. Since EW 40 of 2016 [week ending 7 Oct 2016], the trend has remained stable in all 3 sub-regions.\n\nFigure 2 [graph]. Distribution of incidence rate by EW and sub-region.

Emerg Infect Dis. 2017; 23(3): 405-14. doi: 10.3201/eid2303.161499\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nAbstract\n--------\nZika virus is causally linked with congenital microcephaly and may be associated with pregnancy loss. However, the mechanisms of Zika virus intrauterine transmission and replication and its tropism and persistence in tissues are poorly understood. We tested tissues from 52 case-patients: 8 infants with microcephaly who died and 44 women suspected of being infected with Zika virus during pregnancy. By reverse transcription PCR, tissues from 32 (62 percent) case-patients (brains from 8 infants with microcephaly and placental/fetal tissues from 24 women) were positive for Zika virus. In situ hybridization localized replicative Zika virus RNA in brains of 7 infants and in placentas of 9 women who had pregnancy losses during the 1st or 2nd trimester. These findings demonstrate that Zika virus replicates and persists in fetal brains and placentas, providing direct evidence of its association with microcephaly. Tissue-based reverse transcription PCR extends the time frame of Zika virus detection in congenital and pregnancy-associated infections.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The evidence of Zika virus infection of and persistence in fetal tissues and the placenta continue to accumulate. This study adds to those observations.\n\nA 9 Mar 2017 report indicates that a new study shows the human fetus may be most vulnerable to Zika infection very early in pregnancy.

All but one patient developed a dangerous heart rhythm problem and 2/3 had evidence of heart failure, a condition in which the heart can't pump enough blood to meet the body's needs.\n\n\"Our report provides clear evidence that there is a relationship between the Zika virus infection and cardiovascular complications,\" said Karina Gonzalez Carta, MD, cardiologist and research fellow at the department of cardiovascular diseases at Mayo Clinic and the study's lead author. \"Based on these initial results, people need to be aware that if they travel to or live in a place with known Zika virus and develop a rash, fever or conjunctivitis, and within a short timeframe also feel other symptoms such as fatigue, shortness of breath or their heart skipping beats, they should see their doctor.\"\n\nCarta and her team were not entirely surprised by their findings as they follow trends seen with other mosquito-borne diseases known to affect the heart, including the dengue and chikungunya virus [infections]. However, she noted that the burden and severity of heart problems, including rapidly progressive heart failure and potentially life-threatening arrhythmias, among these patients was unexpected.\n\nThe 9 patients who were seen in the clinic in Caracas within one week of having Zika-type symptoms and who subsequently reported common symptoms of heart problems, most commonly palpitations followed by shortness of breath and fatigue, were included in this small, prospective case report. Only one patient had any previous cardiovascular problems (well-controlled high blood pressure), and lab tests confirmed that all had active Zika infection. Patients were asked to fill out a form to record their symptoms and underwent an initial electrocardiogram, a test that displays the electrical activity of the heart, which in 8 cases was suggestive of a problem with the rate or rhythm of their heartbeat. These findings prompted researchers to perform a full cardiovascular work up using an echocardiogram, (24-hour) Holter monitor, and a cardiac magnetic resonance imaging study. Of the 9 patients, 6 were female with a mean age of 47 \u00b1 17 years. They were followed for an average of 6 months, beginning in July 2016.\n\nDangerous arrhythmias were detected in 8 of the 9 patients: 3 cases of atrial fibrillation, 2 cases of non-sustained atrial tachycardia and 2 cases of ventricular arrhythmias, which can be deadly. Heart failure was present in 6 cases. Of these, 5 patients had heart failure with low ejection fraction -- when the amount of blood the heart is able to squeeze out is much less than what it normally would be -- and one had heart failure with preserved ejection fraction along with pre-eclampsia and a moderate to severe amount of fluid around the heart (called pericardial effusion). So far, none of the patients' cardiac issues have resolved, though symptoms are much improved due to guideline-directed treatment for heart failure or atrial fibrillation. Of note, cardiovascular symptoms tend to manifest later in the process. Data show an average lag of 10 days from patients' initial complaints of Zika symptoms to reports of symptoms suggestive of heart problems.\n\n\"Since the majority of people with Zika virus infections present with mild or non-specific symptoms and symptoms of cardiovascular complications may not occur right away, we need to raise awareness about the possible association,\" Carta said.\n\nAlthough cardiovascular manifestations are fairly rare against the total number of patients treated at the clinic, Carta believes many more cases will be diagnosed, not only in patients with clear symptoms, but also among those with less severe or no signs of myocarditis, an inflammation of the myocardium, the middle layer of the heart wall. Myocarditis can affect the heart's muscle and electrical system.\n\n\"It's likely that many more people are affected, especially as many clinicians and people may not make the connection between symptoms,\" Carta said. \"We need larger, systematic studies to understand the actual risk of Zika-related cardiac problems and what makes one patient more prone to develop them.\"\n\nFor now, she advises that people who are traveling to areas with known Zika virus consider talking with their doctor so they know what basic measures can be taken to prevent infection. Researchers are continuing to follow these patients and are setting up new strategies to screen more patients for cardiovascular problems.\n\nSymptoms of the Zika virus usually include mild fever, skin rash, conjunctivitis (pink eye), muscle and joint pain, malaise or headache, which typically last for 2 to 7 days, according to the World Health Organization. The best way to prevent the Zika virus is by preventing mosquito bites.\n\nWhile this study points to another potential risk of Zika virus infection, it is limited due to its small size. What remains unclear is whether and how the Zika virus might affect people with existing heart disease. However, Carta says that based on our knowledge of other arboviral infections, patients who have pre-existing cardiovascular disease tend to have worse outcomes.\n\nCarta will present the study, \"Myocarditis, Heart Failure and Arrhythmias in Patients With Zika,\" on Sat 18 Mar 2017, at the American College of Cardiology's 66th Annual Scientific Session in Washington.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Zika virus infections continue to provide unpleasant surprises.

Emerg Infect Dis. 2017; 23(5); doi: 10.3201/eid2305.161631\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nAbstract\n--------\nWe tested whole-blood and plasma samples from immunocompetent patients who had had benign Zika virus infections and found that Zika virus RNA persisted in whole blood substantially longer than in plasma. This finding may have implications for diagnosis of acute symptomatic and asymptomatic infections and for testing of blood donations.\n\n[Results]\n---------\nResults from the follow-up (18 whole-blood and 21 plasma samples) showed that the median duration of Zika virus was 22 (range 14-100) days in whole blood and 10 (range 7-37) days in plasma (p=0.058). Mean viral loads of positive samples were 3.39 log copies/mL in whole blood (n=13) and 2.52 log copies/mL in plasma (n=6; p=0.001). Viral loads in the last positive samples varied from 2.7 to 3.9 log copies/mL in whole blood and 2.2 to 2.8 log copies/mL in plasma (p=0.06). Whole-blood samples from 2 patients remained positive at 14 and 63 days after their plasma samples had become negative.\n\n[Conclusion]\n------------\nOverall, our data show that use of whole-blood specimens is much more sensitive than use of plasma samples to detect Zika virus RNA. These data could be useful in recommending the use of whole blood instead of plasma for the molecular diagnosis of acute symptomatic and asymptomatic Zika virus infections and for the safety of whole blood and blood components from donors, as well as for the safety of organs, tissues, and cells from deceased and living donors.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[This information should be useful for blood banks screening for Zika virus presence. - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[6] Virus in banked sperm\nDate: Tue 14 Mar 2017 0351 GMT\nSource: CNN [edited]\nhttp://edition.cnn.com/2017/03/13/health/zika-florida-sperm-warning/index.html\n\n\nSperm donated in 3 Florida counties since [15 Jun 2016] may be infected with the Zika virus, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention cautioned [Mon 13 Mar 2017]. \"When semen is donated it can be stored frozen for periods of time. It does not necessarily inactivate Zika, so it could be stored in tissue banks, used subsequently, and people should be made aware,\" said Dr Peter Marks, director of the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research at the US Food and Drug Administration. He went on to say having this information can help individuals make informed decisions and they \"might want to use these donations from other sources.\" Sources other than the 12 sperm banks in Miami-Dade, Palm Beach, and Broward counties of Florida, that is.\n\nThe agency had previously designated only Miami-Dade County as an area to take precautions after the 1st local transmission of the virus in the continental United States was confirmed in the Wynwood neighborhood of Miami in July [2016]. The area was declared Zika free in December [2016].\n\nThe 1st known sexual transmission of Zika virus in US was 8 years ago. However, the CDC is now warning anyone in Palm Beach and Broward counties to also consider themselves at an increased risk for the virus. This applies to anyone who has traveled to or between these 3 counties since 15 Jun 2016, a change from previous guidance that designated 29 Jun [2016] as the start of the increased risk period.\n\nIt is possible that someone could have Zika without knowing, because an estimated 80 percent of those infected have no symptoms. When symptoms occur, they can include fever, rash, joint pain, and red eyes, and they can last from a few days to about a week.\n\nPregnant women are at greatest risk because they can unknowingly pass the virus to their fetus, causing devastating consequences including miscarriage and neurological deficits that last a lifetime.\n\nBecause the virus can also be sexually transmitted, pregnant women or those trying to become pregnant have been advised to avoid unprotected sex with a partner who has been infected or who has lived in or traveled to an area where the virus is circulating.\n\nThe ongoing investigation into reported cases of the virus in Florida has found that residents of Miami-Dade, Palm Beach, and Broward counties travel frequently between the counties and either forget, or fail to, consider that they've visited an area of increased risk, thus not realizing they could be infected.\n\nWomen who live in these 3 counties who have become pregnant since 15 Jun [2016] are advised to speak with their physicians about the potential increased risk as are women who want to use a sperm donation from a donor in these counties, advised Dr. Denise Jamieson, incident commander for the CDC Zika emergency response and chief of the women's health and fertility branch at the CDC's division of reproductive health.\n\nCDC officials said they are acting only out of an abundance of caution and there have not been any reports of the virus being transmitted through donated sperm.\n\n\"Now we understand more than we did months ago is that evidence of the Zika virus is present in semen for up to 3 months after a man is infected and people may not have accurately recalled potential exposure [to the virus] especially if in a local area,\" said Dr Matthew Kuehnert, who is part of the CDC Zika emergency response team and director of the CDC office of blood, organ and other tissue safety.\n\nUnlike blood donations, which are routinely screened for the virus in the United States, there is no available test to screen semen for Zika. The existing test is still in the research phase and accuracy is being assessed, which is why men in these counties should not donate sperm. Their donated sperm may be infected.\n\nThe Florida Department of Health last reported a case of local transmission of the virus on [2 Mar 2017]. However, that report included confirmation of 2 cases from October of last year [2016]. A 3rd case was also reported then but this was an individual who donated blood in January [2017] and through routine blood screening was found to have previously been infected but no longer had an active case of the virus.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Although this may seem like an over precautious stance, the risk of Zika virus transmission from donated sperm is small but real. The consequence of fetal infections is serious for families that have to deal with the consequences of a child with microcephaly or other birth defects. - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[7] _Culex quinquefasciatus_ and _Aedes taeniorhynchus_ refractory\nDate: March 2017 [ahead of print]\nSource: Emerging Infectious Diseases journal [edited]\nhttps://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/23/3/16-1636_article\n\n\nRef: Hart CE, Roundy CM, Azar SR, et al: Zika virus vector competency of mosquitoes, Gulf Coast, United States.

We applied multiple sequencing approaches to generate 100 ZIKV genomes from clinical and mosquito samples from 10 countries and territories, greatly expanding the observed viral genetic diversity from this outbreak. We analyzed the timing and patterns of introductions into distinct geographic regions, confirming phylogenetic evidence for the origin and rapid expansion of the outbreak in Brazil, and for multiple introductions from Brazil into Honduras, Colombia, Puerto Rico, other Caribbean islands, and the continental US. We find that ZIKV circulated undetected in many regions of the Americas for up to a year before the 1st locally transmitted cases were confirmed, highlighting the challenge of effective surveillance for this virus. We further characterize genetic variation across the outbreak to identify mutations with possible functional implications for ZIKV biology and pathogenesis.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n[This report provides a recent historical overview of Zika virus in the Americas.

Incidence of Zika virus disease by age and sex -- Puerto Rico, November 1, 2015-October 20, 2016. MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep. 2016;65(44):1219-1223. doi: 10.15585/mmwr.mm6544a4, PMID: 27832051.\n\nZika virus is a flavivirus transmitted primarily by _Aedes_ species mosquitoes; symptoms of infection include rash, arthralgia, fever, and conjunctivitis. Zika virus infection during pregnancy can cause microcephaly and other serious brain anomalies and in rare cases, Zika virus infection has been associated with Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome and severe thrombocytopenia. This report describes the incidence of reported symptomatic Zika virus disease in the US territory of Puerto Rico by age and sex. During 1 Nov to 20 Oct 2016, 62 500 suspected Zika virus disease cases were reported to the Puerto Rico Department of Health (PRDH); 29 345 (47 per cent) were confirmed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing, or were presumptively diagnosed based on serological testing. The highest incidence among confirmed or presumptive cases occurred among persons aged 20-29 years (1150 cases per 100 000 residents). Among 28 219 (96.2 per cent) nonpregnant patients with confirmed or presumptive Zika virus disease, incidence was higher among women (936 per 100 000 population) than men (576 per 100 000) for all age groups more or equal 20 years, and the majority (61 per cent) of reported Zika virus disease cases occurred in females. Among suspected Zika virus disease cases in nonpregnant adults aged more or equal 40 years, the percentage that tested positive among females (52 per cent) was higher than that among males (47 per cent) (p less than 0.01). Reasons for the higher incidence of Zika virus disease among women aged more or equal 20 years are not known; serosurveys of persons living near confirmed Zika virus disease cases might help to elucidate these findings. Residents of and travelers to Puerto Rico should remove or cover standing water, practice mosquito abatement, employ mosquito bite avoidance behaviors, take precautions to reduce the risk for sexual transmission, and seek medical care for any acute illness with rash or fever.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nRoland H\u00fcbner\nSuperior Health Council\nBrussels\nBelgium\nroland.hubner@sante.belgique.be\n\n[Puerto Rico is a focal area of intense Zika virus transmission, with no end in sight. Both visitors and residents should heed the advice of health authorities for mosquito bite avoidance behaviors, precautions to reduce the risk for sexual transmission, and seeking medical care for any acute illness with rash or fever. - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[3] Synthetic DNA vaccine\nDate: Thu 10 Nov 2016\nSource: Science Daily [edited]\nhttps://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/11/161110125203.htm\n\n\nAs the global spread of the Zika virus continues, efforts are under way to halt the disease's transmission. While no licensed therapies or vaccines to protect against the Zika virus are currently available, new research published in the journal npj Vaccines demonstrates how a synthetic DNA vaccine approach successfully protected against infection, brain damage and death caused by the mosquitoborne Zika virus in vivo.\n\nIn this preclinical study, 100 per cent of the animal models were protected from Zika after vaccination followed by a challenge with the Zika virus. In addition, they were protected from degeneration in the cerebral cortex and hippocampal areas of the brain, while the other cohort showed degeneration of the brain after Zika infection.\n\n\"Our results support the critical importance of immune responses for both preventing infection as well as ameliorating disease caused by the Zika virus,\" said lead researcher David B Weiner PhD, executive vice president and director of the Vaccine Center at The Wistar Institute and the WW Smith Charitable Trust professor in cancer research at Wistar. \"As the threat of Zika continues, these results provide insight into a new aspect of the possibly protective ability of such a vaccine as a preventative approach for Zika infection.\"\n\nThis study is the 1st of its kind to analyze a vaccine in an animal model that is susceptible to the disease, providing information regarding the protective impact of the immune response in susceptible individuals. Prior studies of the Zika virus have tested vaccines in animal models that are naturally resistant to Zika. This study extends these prior research studies in an important manner.\n\nJ Joseph Kim PhD, MBA, president and CEO of Inovio Pharmaceuticals Inc, added, \"Working with Wistar, we have clearly demonstrated the power and the speed of our product development platform when we and our collaborators moved our Zika vaccine from the bench to human studies in less than 6 months, taking advantage of our platform to help in this outbreak situation.\"\n\nIn this latest study, Weiner and colleagues demonstrated how a synthetic DNA vaccine expressed specific antigens for Zika in vivo. They observed that this novel vaccine generated robust antigen-specific antibody and T cell responses that neutralized the virus in preclinical animal models. Moreover, they found that the vaccine provided protection against the disease and death in animal models while also being neuroprotective, meaning that the disease was unable to spread to the brain. This is especially important given the risk that infants born with the disease have of developing microcephaly, a birth defect resulting in an abnormally small head and that may prevent the brain from developing properly.\n\nOne important aspect of Zika and many other mosquitoborne diseases is that not everyone infected with the virus will actually become ill as a result. With Zika, only about 20 to 25 per cent of individuals with the virus are actually impacted by the disease, according to previous studies from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). However, there is no way to know for certain who will be at risk for illness due to the virus, which is why it was crucial for this study to examine how a vaccine would operate in an infected, symptomatic host.\n\nThis Zika vaccine is being developed in collaboration between Inovio, The Wistar Institute, and GeneOne Life Science Inc and is currently being tested in 2 human clinical studies. Before the end of 2016, Inovio expects to report phase I data from the first 40-subject study being conducted in Miami, Philadelphia and Quebec City. In August, the companies also initiated a 2nd study in 160 subjects in Puerto Rico. CDC estimates that Zika will infect more than 25 percent of the Puerto Rican population by the end of the year, creating the potential for this study's placebo-controlled design to provide exploratory signals of vaccine efficacy in 2017.\n\nA total of nearly 4000 cases of Zika infection have been reported in the United States alone, according to CDC. While most of these are travel-associated cases, more than 100 cases of Zika infection originating within the United States have been reported. Globally, more than 60 countries have reported mosquitoborne transmission of the disease.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[These results are very encouraging. Because 80 per cent of individuals who contract Zika virus infections do not develop clinical signs, if these asymptomatic individuals have viremias of sufficiently high magnitude to provide infectious blood meals for vector mosquitoes, or can transmit the virus sexually, it appears that the vast majority, perhaps 80 per cent, of the population at risk would have to be vaccinated in order to halt transmission. It will be interesting to know if pregnant women, especially those in the 1st trimester, can tolerate the vaccine to prevent infection of their fetuses. - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[4] Zika virus origin in Americas, comment\nDate: Thu 10 Nov 2016\nFrom: Stephen Seligman <sseligman@mail.rockefeller.edu> [edited]\n\n\nPhylogenetic analysis of Zika isolates clearly indicates that the origin of the strains circulating in Latin America was in French Polynesia (Pettersson JH, Eldholm V, Seligman SJ, et al. How did Zika virus emerge in the Pacific Islands and Latin America? MBio. 2016;7(5). pii: e01239-16. doi: 10.1128/mBio.01239-16.). There appear to be 2 independent sources for the strains circulating in the Pacific Islands (Oceania). One caused an epidemic in Yap Island, Micronesia (2007) and a 2nd was responsible for the epidemic in French Polynesia (2013-14).\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nStephen J Seligman, MD\nResearch Professor\nNew York Medical College\nValhalla, NY\nAdjunct Professor\nThe Rockefeller University\nNew York, NY\n<sseligman@rockefeller.edu>\n\n\n[ProMED-mail thanks Dr Seligman for his comments, clarifying the origin of Zika virus in the Americas. The way in which the virus was brought from Oceania to the Americas has not been established, but speculation that a viremic person who attended international sporting events in Brazil brought the virus seems likely. -

Incidence of Zika virus disease by age and sex -- Puerto Rico, November 1, 2015-October 20, 2016. MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep. 2016;65(44):1219-1223. doi: 10.15585/mmwr.mm6544a4, PMID: 27832051.\n\nZika virus is a flavivirus transmitted primarily by _Aedes_ species mosquitoes; symptoms of infection include rash, arthralgia, fever, and conjunctivitis. Zika virus infection during pregnancy can cause microcephaly and other serious brain anomalies and in rare cases, Zika virus infection has been associated with Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome and severe thrombocytopenia. This report describes the incidence of reported symptomatic Zika virus disease in the US territory of Puerto Rico by age and sex. During 1 Nov to 20 Oct 2016, 62 500 suspected Zika virus disease cases were reported to the Puerto Rico Department of Health (PRDH); 29 345 (47 per cent) were confirmed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing, or were presumptively diagnosed based on serological testing. The highest incidence among confirmed or presumptive cases occurred among persons aged 20-29 years (1150 cases per 100 000 residents). Among 28 219 (96.2 per cent) nonpregnant patients with confirmed or presumptive Zika virus disease, incidence was higher among women (936 per 100 000 population) than men (576 per 100 000) for all age groups more or equal 20 years, and the majority (61 per cent) of reported Zika virus disease cases occurred in females. Among suspected Zika virus disease cases in nonpregnant adults aged more or equal 40 years, the percentage that tested positive among females (52 per cent) was higher than that among males (47 per cent) (p less than 0.01). Reasons for the higher incidence of Zika virus disease among women aged more or equal 20 years are not known; serosurveys of persons living near confirmed Zika virus disease cases might help to elucidate these findings. Residents of and travelers to Puerto Rico should remove or cover standing water, practice mosquito abatement, employ mosquito bite avoidance behaviors, take precautions to reduce the risk for sexual transmission, and seek medical care for any acute illness with rash or fever.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nRoland H\u00fcbner\nSuperior Health Council\nBrussels\nBelgium\nroland.hubner@sante.belgique.be\n\n[Puerto Rico is a focal area of intense Zika virus transmission, with no end in sight.

While no licensed therapies or vaccines to protect against the Zika virus are currently available, new research published in the journal npj Vaccines demonstrates how a synthetic DNA vaccine approach successfully protected against infection, brain damage and death caused by the mosquitoborne Zika virus in vivo.\n\nIn this preclinical study, 100 per cent of the animal models were protected from Zika after vaccination followed by a challenge with the Zika virus. In addition, they were protected from degeneration in the cerebral cortex and hippocampal areas of the brain, while the other cohort showed degeneration of the brain after Zika infection.\n\n\"Our results support the critical importance of immune responses for both preventing infection as well as ameliorating disease caused by the Zika virus,\" said lead researcher David B Weiner PhD, executive vice president and director of the Vaccine Center at The Wistar Institute and the WW Smith Charitable Trust professor in cancer research at Wistar. \"As the threat of Zika continues, these results provide insight into a new aspect of the possibly protective ability of such a vaccine as a preventative approach for Zika infection.\"\n\nThis study is the 1st of its kind to analyze a vaccine in an animal model that is susceptible to the disease, providing information regarding the protective impact of the immune response in susceptible individuals. Prior studies of the Zika virus have tested vaccines in animal models that are naturally resistant to Zika. This study extends these prior research studies in an important manner.\n\nJ Joseph Kim PhD, MBA, president and CEO of Inovio Pharmaceuticals Inc, added, \"Working with Wistar, we have clearly demonstrated the power and the speed of our product development platform when we and our collaborators moved our Zika vaccine from the bench to human studies in less than 6 months, taking advantage of our platform to help in this outbreak situation.\"\n\nIn this latest study, Weiner and colleagues demonstrated how a synthetic DNA vaccine expressed specific antigens for Zika in vivo. They observed that this novel vaccine generated robust antigen-specific antibody and T cell responses that neutralized the virus in preclinical animal models. Moreover, they found that the vaccine provided protection against the disease and death in animal models while also being neuroprotective, meaning that the disease was unable to spread to the brain. This is especially important given the risk that infants born with the disease have of developing microcephaly, a birth defect resulting in an abnormally small head and that may prevent the brain from developing properly.\n\nOne important aspect of Zika and many other mosquitoborne diseases is that not everyone infected with the virus will actually become ill as a result. With Zika, only about 20 to 25 per cent of individuals with the virus are actually impacted by the disease, according to previous studies from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). However, there is no way to know for certain who will be at risk for illness due to the virus, which is why it was crucial for this study to examine how a vaccine would operate in an infected, symptomatic host.\n\nThis Zika vaccine is being developed in collaboration between Inovio, The Wistar Institute, and GeneOne Life Science Inc and is currently being tested in 2 human clinical studies. Before the end of 2016, Inovio expects to report phase I data from the first 40-subject study being conducted in Miami, Philadelphia and Quebec City. In August, the companies also initiated a 2nd study in 160 subjects in Puerto Rico. CDC estimates that Zika will infect more than 25 percent of the Puerto Rican population by the end of the year, creating the potential for this study's placebo-controlled design to provide exploratory signals of vaccine efficacy in 2017.\n\nA total of nearly 4000 cases of Zika infection have been reported in the United States alone, according to CDC. While most of these are travel-associated cases, more than 100 cases of Zika infection originating within the United States have been reported. Globally, more than 60 countries have reported mosquitoborne transmission of the disease.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[These results are very encouraging. Because 80 per cent of individuals who contract Zika virus infections do not develop clinical signs, if these asymptomatic individuals have viremias of sufficiently high magnitude to provide infectious blood meals for vector mosquitoes, or can transmit the virus sexually, it appears that the vast majority, perhaps 80 per cent, of the population at risk would have to be vaccinated in order to halt transmission. It will be interesting to know if pregnant women, especially those in the 1st trimester, can tolerate the vaccine to prevent infection of their fetuses. - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[4] Zika virus origin in Americas, comment\nDate: Thu 10 Nov 2016\nFrom: Stephen Seligman <sseligman@mail.rockefeller.edu> [edited]\n\n\nPhylogenetic analysis of Zika isolates clearly indicates that the origin of the strains circulating in Latin America was in French Polynesia (Pettersson JH, Eldholm V, Seligman SJ, et al. How did Zika virus emerge in the Pacific Islands and Latin America? MBio. 2016;7(5). pii: e01239-16. doi: 10.1128/mBio.01239-16.). There appear to be 2 independent sources for the strains circulating in the Pacific Islands (Oceania). One caused an epidemic in Yap Island, Micronesia (2007) and a 2nd was responsible for the epidemic in French Polynesia (2013-14).\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nStephen J Seligman, MD\nResearch Professor\nNew York Medical College\nValhalla, NY\nAdjunct Professor\nThe Rockefeller University\nNew York, NY\n<sseligman@rockefeller.edu>\n\n\n[ProMED-mail thanks Dr Seligman for his comments, clarifying the origin of Zika virus in the Americas. The way in which the virus was brought from Oceania to the Americas has not been established, but speculation that a viremic person who attended international sporting events in Brazil brought the virus seems likely. -

Incidence of Zika virus disease by age and sex -- Puerto Rico, November 1, 2015-October 20, 2016. MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep. 2016;65(44):1219-1223. doi: 10.15585/mmwr.mm6544a4, PMID: 27832051.\n\nZika virus is a flavivirus transmitted primarily by _Aedes_ species mosquitoes; symptoms of infection include rash, arthralgia, fever, and conjunctivitis. Zika virus infection during pregnancy can cause microcephaly and other serious brain anomalies and in rare cases, Zika virus infection has been associated with Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome and severe thrombocytopenia. This report describes the incidence of reported symptomatic Zika virus disease in the US territory of Puerto Rico by age and sex. During 1 Nov to 20 Oct 2016, 62 500 suspected Zika virus disease cases were reported to the Puerto Rico Department of Health (PRDH); 29 345 (47 per cent) were confirmed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing, or were presumptively diagnosed based on serological testing. The highest incidence among confirmed or presumptive cases occurred among persons aged 20-29 years (1150 cases per 100 000 residents). Among 28 219 (96.2 per cent) nonpregnant patients with confirmed or presumptive Zika virus disease, incidence was higher among women (936 per 100 000 population) than men (576 per 100 000) for all age groups more or equal 20 years, and the majority (61 per cent) of reported Zika virus disease cases occurred in females. Among suspected Zika virus disease cases in nonpregnant adults aged more or equal 40 years, the percentage that tested positive among females (52 per cent) was higher than that among males (47 per cent) (p less than 0.01). Reasons for the higher incidence of Zika virus disease among women aged more or equal 20 years are not known; serosurveys of persons living near confirmed Zika virus disease cases might help to elucidate these findings. Residents of and travelers to Puerto Rico should remove or cover standing water, practice mosquito abatement, employ mosquito bite avoidance behaviors, take precautions to reduce the risk for sexual transmission, and seek medical care for any acute illness with rash or fever.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nRoland H\u00fcbner\nSuperior Health Council\nBrussels\nBelgium\nroland.hubner@sante.belgique.be\n\n[Puerto Rico is a focal area of intense Zika virus transmission, with no end in sight.

While no licensed therapies or vaccines to protect against the Zika virus are currently available, new research published in the journal npj Vaccines demonstrates how a synthetic DNA vaccine approach successfully protected against infection, brain damage and death caused by the mosquitoborne Zika virus in vivo.\n\nIn this preclinical study, 100 per cent of the animal models were protected from Zika after vaccination followed by a challenge with the Zika virus. In addition, they were protected from degeneration in the cerebral cortex and hippocampal areas of the brain, while the other cohort showed degeneration of the brain after Zika infection.\n\n\"Our results support the critical importance of immune responses for both preventing infection as well as ameliorating disease caused by the Zika virus,\" said lead researcher David B Weiner PhD, executive vice president and director of the Vaccine Center at The Wistar Institute and the WW Smith Charitable Trust professor in cancer research at Wistar. \"As the threat of Zika continues, these results provide insight into a new aspect of the possibly protective ability of such a vaccine as a preventative approach for Zika infection.\"\n\nThis study is the 1st of its kind to analyze a vaccine in an animal model that is susceptible to the disease, providing information regarding the protective impact of the immune response in susceptible individuals. Prior studies of the Zika virus have tested vaccines in animal models that are naturally resistant to Zika. This study extends these prior research studies in an important manner.\n\nJ Joseph Kim PhD, MBA, president and CEO of Inovio Pharmaceuticals Inc, added, \"Working with Wistar, we have clearly demonstrated the power and the speed of our product development platform when we and our collaborators moved our Zika vaccine from the bench to human studies in less than 6 months, taking advantage of our platform to help in this outbreak situation.\"\n\nIn this latest study, Weiner and colleagues demonstrated how a synthetic DNA vaccine expressed specific antigens for Zika in vivo. They observed that this novel vaccine generated robust antigen-specific antibody and T cell responses that neutralized the virus in preclinical animal models. Moreover, they found that the vaccine provided protection against the disease and death in animal models while also being neuroprotective, meaning that the disease was unable to spread to the brain. This is especially important given the risk that infants born with the disease have of developing microcephaly, a birth defect resulting in an abnormally small head and that may prevent the brain from developing properly.\n\nOne important aspect of Zika and many other mosquitoborne diseases is that not everyone infected with the virus will actually become ill as a result. With Zika, only about 20 to 25 per cent of individuals with the virus are actually impacted by the disease, according to previous studies from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). However, there is no way to know for certain who will be at risk for illness due to the virus, which is why it was crucial for this study to examine how a vaccine would operate in an infected, symptomatic host.\n\nThis Zika vaccine is being developed in collaboration between Inovio, The Wistar Institute, and GeneOne Life Science Inc and is currently being tested in 2 human clinical studies. Before the end of 2016, Inovio expects to report phase I data from the first 40-subject study being conducted in Miami, Philadelphia and Quebec City. In August, the companies also initiated a 2nd study in 160 subjects in Puerto Rico. CDC estimates that Zika will infect more than 25 percent of the Puerto Rican population by the end of the year, creating the potential for this study's placebo-controlled design to provide exploratory signals of vaccine efficacy in 2017.\n\nA total of nearly 4000 cases of Zika infection have been reported in the United States alone, according to CDC. While most of these are travel-associated cases, more than 100 cases of Zika infection originating within the United States have been reported. Globally, more than 60 countries have reported mosquitoborne transmission of the disease.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[These results are very encouraging. Because 80 per cent of individuals who contract Zika virus infections do not develop clinical signs, if these asymptomatic individuals have viremias of sufficiently high magnitude to provide infectious blood meals for vector mosquitoes, or can transmit the virus sexually, it appears that the vast majority, perhaps 80 per cent, of the population at risk would have to be vaccinated in order to halt transmission. It will be interesting to know if pregnant women, especially those in the 1st trimester, can tolerate the vaccine to prevent infection of their fetuses. - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[4] Zika virus origin in Americas, comment\nDate: Thu 10 Nov 2016\nFrom: Stephen Seligman <sseligman@mail.rockefeller.edu> [edited]\n\n\nPhylogenetic analysis of Zika isolates clearly indicates that the origin of the strains circulating in Latin America was in French Polynesia (Pettersson JH, Eldholm V, Seligman SJ, et al. How did Zika virus emerge in the Pacific Islands and Latin America? MBio. 2016;7(5). pii: e01239-16. doi: 10.1128/mBio.01239-16.). There appear to be 2 independent sources for the strains circulating in the Pacific Islands (Oceania). One caused an epidemic in Yap Island, Micronesia (2007) and a 2nd was responsible for the epidemic in French Polynesia (2013-14).\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nStephen J Seligman, MD\nResearch Professor\nNew York Medical College\nValhalla, NY\nAdjunct Professor\nThe Rockefeller University\nNew York, NY\n<sseligman@rockefeller.edu>\n\n\n[ProMED-mail thanks Dr Seligman for his comments, clarifying the origin of Zika virus in the Americas. The way in which the virus was brought from Oceania to the Americas has not been established, but speculation that a viremic person who attended international sporting events in Brazil brought the virus seems likely. -

Incidence of Zika virus disease by age and sex -- Puerto Rico, November 1, 2015-October 20, 2016. MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep. 2016;65(44):1219-1223. doi: 10.15585/mmwr.mm6544a4, PMID: 27832051.\n\nZika virus is a flavivirus transmitted primarily by _Aedes_ species mosquitoes; symptoms of infection include rash, arthralgia, fever, and conjunctivitis. Zika virus infection during pregnancy can cause microcephaly and other serious brain anomalies and in rare cases, Zika virus infection has been associated with Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome and severe thrombocytopenia. This report describes the incidence of reported symptomatic Zika virus disease in the US territory of Puerto Rico by age and sex. During 1 Nov to 20 Oct 2016, 62 500 suspected Zika virus disease cases were reported to the Puerto Rico Department of Health (PRDH); 29 345 (47 per cent) were confirmed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing, or were presumptively diagnosed based on serological testing. The highest incidence among confirmed or presumptive cases occurred among persons aged 20-29 years (1150 cases per 100 000 residents). Among 28 219 (96.2 per cent) nonpregnant patients with confirmed or presumptive Zika virus disease, incidence was higher among women (936 per 100 000 population) than men (576 per 100 000) for all age groups more or equal 20 years, and the majority (61 per cent) of reported Zika virus disease cases occurred in females. Among suspected Zika virus disease cases in nonpregnant adults aged more or equal 40 years, the percentage that tested positive among females (52 per cent) was higher than that among males (47 per cent) (p less than 0.01). Reasons for the higher incidence of Zika virus disease among women aged more or equal 20 years are not known; serosurveys of persons living near confirmed Zika virus disease cases might help to elucidate these findings. Residents of and travelers to Puerto Rico should remove or cover standing water, practice mosquito abatement, employ mosquito bite avoidance behaviors, take precautions to reduce the risk for sexual transmission, and seek medical care for any acute illness with rash or fever.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nRoland H\u00fcbner\nSuperior Health Council\nBrussels\nBelgium\nroland.hubner@sante.belgique.be\n\n[Puerto Rico is a focal area of intense Zika virus transmission, with no end in sight.

While no licensed therapies or vaccines to protect against the Zika virus are currently available, new research published in the journal npj Vaccines demonstrates how a synthetic DNA vaccine approach successfully protected against infection, brain damage and death caused by the mosquitoborne Zika virus in vivo.\n\nIn this preclinical study, 100 per cent of the animal models were protected from Zika after vaccination followed by a challenge with the Zika virus. In addition, they were protected from degeneration in the cerebral cortex and hippocampal areas of the brain, while the other cohort showed degeneration of the brain after Zika infection.\n\n\"Our results support the critical importance of immune responses for both preventing infection as well as ameliorating disease caused by the Zika virus,\" said lead researcher David B Weiner PhD, executive vice president and director of the Vaccine Center at The Wistar Institute and the WW Smith Charitable Trust professor in cancer research at Wistar. \"As the threat of Zika continues, these results provide insight into a new aspect of the possibly protective ability of such a vaccine as a preventative approach for Zika infection.\"\n\nThis study is the 1st of its kind to analyze a vaccine in an animal model that is susceptible to the disease, providing information regarding the protective impact of the immune response in susceptible individuals. Prior studies of the Zika virus have tested vaccines in animal models that are naturally resistant to Zika. This study extends these prior research studies in an important manner.\n\nJ Joseph Kim PhD, MBA, president and CEO of Inovio Pharmaceuticals Inc, added, \"Working with Wistar, we have clearly demonstrated the power and the speed of our product development platform when we and our collaborators moved our Zika vaccine from the bench to human studies in less than 6 months, taking advantage of our platform to help in this outbreak situation.\"\n\nIn this latest study, Weiner and colleagues demonstrated how a synthetic DNA vaccine expressed specific antigens for Zika in vivo. They observed that this novel vaccine generated robust antigen-specific antibody and T cell responses that neutralized the virus in preclinical animal models. Moreover, they found that the vaccine provided protection against the disease and death in animal models while also being neuroprotective, meaning that the disease was unable to spread to the brain. This is especially important given the risk that infants born with the disease have of developing microcephaly, a birth defect resulting in an abnormally small head and that may prevent the brain from developing properly.\n\nOne important aspect of Zika and many other mosquitoborne diseases is that not everyone infected with the virus will actually become ill as a result. With Zika, only about 20 to 25 per cent of individuals with the virus are actually impacted by the disease, according to previous studies from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). However, there is no way to know for certain who will be at risk for illness due to the virus, which is why it was crucial for this study to examine how a vaccine would operate in an infected, symptomatic host.\n\nThis Zika vaccine is being developed in collaboration between Inovio, The Wistar Institute, and GeneOne Life Science Inc and is currently being tested in 2 human clinical studies. Before the end of 2016, Inovio expects to report phase I data from the first 40-subject study being conducted in Miami, Philadelphia and Quebec City. In August, the companies also initiated a 2nd study in 160 subjects in Puerto Rico. CDC estimates that Zika will infect more than 25 percent of the Puerto Rican population by the end of the year, creating the potential for this study's placebo-controlled design to provide exploratory signals of vaccine efficacy in 2017.\n\nA total of nearly 4000 cases of Zika infection have been reported in the United States alone, according to CDC. While most of these are travel-associated cases, more than 100 cases of Zika infection originating within the United States have been reported. Globally, more than 60 countries have reported mosquitoborne transmission of the disease.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[These results are very encouraging. Because 80 per cent of individuals who contract Zika virus infections do not develop clinical signs, if these asymptomatic individuals have viremias of sufficiently high magnitude to provide infectious blood meals for vector mosquitoes, or can transmit the virus sexually, it appears that the vast majority, perhaps 80 per cent, of the population at risk would have to be vaccinated in order to halt transmission. It will be interesting to know if pregnant women, especially those in the 1st trimester, can tolerate the vaccine to prevent infection of their fetuses. - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[4] Zika virus origin in Americas, comment\nDate: Thu 10 Nov 2016\nFrom: Stephen Seligman <sseligman@mail.rockefeller.edu> [edited]\n\n\nPhylogenetic analysis of Zika isolates clearly indicates that the origin of the strains circulating in Latin America was in French Polynesia (Pettersson JH, Eldholm V, Seligman SJ, et al. How did Zika virus emerge in the Pacific Islands and Latin America? MBio. 2016;7(5). pii: e01239-16. doi: 10.1128/mBio.01239-16.). There appear to be 2 independent sources for the strains circulating in the Pacific Islands (Oceania). One caused an epidemic in Yap Island, Micronesia (2007) and a 2nd was responsible for the epidemic in French Polynesia (2013-14).\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nStephen J Seligman, MD\nResearch Professor\nNew York Medical College\nValhalla, NY\nAdjunct Professor\nThe Rockefeller University\nNew York, NY\n<sseligman@rockefeller.edu>\n\n\n[ProMED-mail thanks Dr Seligman for his comments, clarifying the origin of Zika virus in the Americas. The way in which the virus was brought from Oceania to the Americas has not been established, but speculation that a viremic person who attended international sporting events in Brazil brought the virus seems likely. -

Zika virus infection during pregnancy can cause microcephaly and other serious brain anomalies and in rare cases, Zika virus infection has been associated with Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome and severe thrombocytopenia. This report describes the incidence of reported symptomatic Zika virus disease in the US territory of Puerto Rico by age and sex. During 1 Nov to 20 Oct 2016, 62 500 suspected Zika virus disease cases were reported to the Puerto Rico Department of Health (PRDH); 29 345 (47 per cent) were confirmed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing, or were presumptively diagnosed based on serological testing. The highest incidence among confirmed or presumptive cases occurred among persons aged 20-29 years (1150 cases per 100 000 residents). Among 28 219 (96.2 per cent) nonpregnant patients with confirmed or presumptive Zika virus disease, incidence was higher among women (936 per 100 000 population) than men (576 per 100 000) for all age groups more or equal 20 years, and the majority (61 per cent) of reported Zika virus disease cases occurred in females. Among suspected Zika virus disease cases in nonpregnant adults aged more or equal 40 years, the percentage that tested positive among females (52 per cent) was higher than that among males (47 per cent) (p less than 0.01). Reasons for the higher incidence of Zika virus disease among women aged more or equal 20 years are not known; serosurveys of persons living near confirmed Zika virus disease cases might help to elucidate these findings. Residents of and travelers to Puerto Rico should remove or cover standing water, practice mosquito abatement, employ mosquito bite avoidance behaviors, take precautions to reduce the risk for sexual transmission, and seek medical care for any acute illness with rash or fever.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nRoland H\u00fcbner\nSuperior Health Council\nBrussels\nBelgium\nroland.hubner@sante.belgique.be\n\n[Puerto Rico is a focal area of intense Zika virus transmission, with no end in sight.

While no licensed therapies or vaccines to protect against the Zika virus are currently available, new research published in the journal npj Vaccines demonstrates how a synthetic DNA vaccine approach successfully protected against infection, brain damage and death caused by the mosquitoborne Zika virus in vivo.\n\nIn this preclinical study, 100 per cent of the animal models were protected from Zika after vaccination followed by a challenge with the Zika virus. In addition, they were protected from degeneration in the cerebral cortex and hippocampal areas of the brain, while the other cohort showed degeneration of the brain after Zika infection.\n\n\"Our results support the critical importance of immune responses for both preventing infection as well as ameliorating disease caused by the Zika virus,\" said lead researcher David B Weiner PhD, executive vice president and director of the Vaccine Center at The Wistar Institute and the WW Smith Charitable Trust professor in cancer research at Wistar. \"As the threat of Zika continues, these results provide insight into a new aspect of the possibly protective ability of such a vaccine as a preventative approach for Zika infection.\"\n\nThis study is the 1st of its kind to analyze a vaccine in an animal model that is susceptible to the disease, providing information regarding the protective impact of the immune response in susceptible individuals. Prior studies of the Zika virus have tested vaccines in animal models that are naturally resistant to Zika. This study extends these prior research studies in an important manner.\n\nJ Joseph Kim PhD, MBA, president and CEO of Inovio Pharmaceuticals Inc, added, \"Working with Wistar, we have clearly demonstrated the power and the speed of our product development platform when we and our collaborators moved our Zika vaccine from the bench to human studies in less than 6 months, taking advantage of our platform to help in this outbreak situation.\"\n\nIn this latest study, Weiner and colleagues demonstrated how a synthetic DNA vaccine expressed specific antigens for Zika in vivo. They observed that this novel vaccine generated robust antigen-specific antibody and T cell responses that neutralized the virus in preclinical animal models. Moreover, they found that the vaccine provided protection against the disease and death in animal models while also being neuroprotective, meaning that the disease was unable to spread to the brain. This is especially important given the risk that infants born with the disease have of developing microcephaly, a birth defect resulting in an abnormally small head and that may prevent the brain from developing properly.\n\nOne important aspect of Zika and many other mosquitoborne diseases is that not everyone infected with the virus will actually become ill as a result. With Zika, only about 20 to 25 per cent of individuals with the virus are actually impacted by the disease, according to previous studies from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). However, there is no way to know for certain who will be at risk for illness due to the virus, which is why it was crucial for this study to examine how a vaccine would operate in an infected, symptomatic host.\n\nThis Zika vaccine is being developed in collaboration between Inovio, The Wistar Institute, and GeneOne Life Science Inc and is currently being tested in 2 human clinical studies. Before the end of 2016, Inovio expects to report phase I data from the first 40-subject study being conducted in Miami, Philadelphia and Quebec City. In August, the companies also initiated a 2nd study in 160 subjects in Puerto Rico. CDC estimates that Zika will infect more than 25 percent of the Puerto Rican population by the end of the year, creating the potential for this study's placebo-controlled design to provide exploratory signals of vaccine efficacy in 2017.\n\nA total of nearly 4000 cases of Zika infection have been reported in the United States alone, according to CDC. While most of these are travel-associated cases, more than 100 cases of Zika infection originating within the United States have been reported. Globally, more than 60 countries have reported mosquitoborne transmission of the disease.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[These results are very encouraging. Because 80 per cent of individuals who contract Zika virus infections do not develop clinical signs, if these asymptomatic individuals have viremias of sufficiently high magnitude to provide infectious blood meals for vector mosquitoes, or can transmit the virus sexually, it appears that the vast majority, perhaps 80 per cent, of the population at risk would have to be vaccinated in order to halt transmission. It will be interesting to know if pregnant women, especially those in the 1st trimester, can tolerate the vaccine to prevent infection of their fetuses. - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[4] Zika virus origin in Americas, comment\nDate: Thu 10 Nov 2016\nFrom: Stephen Seligman <sseligman@mail.rockefeller.edu> [edited]\n\n\nPhylogenetic analysis of Zika isolates clearly indicates that the origin of the strains circulating in Latin America was in French Polynesia (Pettersson JH, Eldholm V, Seligman SJ, et al. How did Zika virus emerge in the Pacific Islands and Latin America? MBio. 2016;7(5). pii: e01239-16. doi: 10.1128/mBio.01239-16.). There appear to be 2 independent sources for the strains circulating in the Pacific Islands (Oceania). One caused an epidemic in Yap Island, Micronesia (2007) and a 2nd was responsible for the epidemic in French Polynesia (2013-14).\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nStephen J Seligman, MD\nResearch Professor\nNew York Medical College\nValhalla, NY\nAdjunct Professor\nThe Rockefeller University\nNew York, NY\n<sseligman@rockefeller.edu>\n\n\n[ProMED-mail thanks Dr Seligman for his comments, clarifying the origin of Zika virus in the Americas. The way in which the virus was brought from Oceania to the Americas has not been established, but speculation that a viremic person who attended international sporting events in Brazil brought the virus seems likely. -

Zika virus infection during pregnancy can cause microcephaly and other serious brain anomalies and in rare cases, Zika virus infection has been associated with Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome and severe thrombocytopenia. This report describes the incidence of reported symptomatic Zika virus disease in the US territory of Puerto Rico by age and sex. During 1 Nov to 20 Oct 2016, 62 500 suspected Zika virus disease cases were reported to the Puerto Rico Department of Health (PRDH); 29 345 (47 per cent) were confirmed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing, or were presumptively diagnosed based on serological testing. The highest incidence among confirmed or presumptive cases occurred among persons aged 20-29 years (1150 cases per 100 000 residents). Among 28 219 (96.2 per cent) nonpregnant patients with confirmed or presumptive Zika virus disease, incidence was higher among women (936 per 100 000 population) than men (576 per 100 000) for all age groups more or equal 20 years, and the majority (61 per cent) of reported Zika virus disease cases occurred in females. Among suspected Zika virus disease cases in nonpregnant adults aged more or equal 40 years, the percentage that tested positive among females (52 per cent) was higher than that among males (47 per cent) (p less than 0.01). Reasons for the higher incidence of Zika virus disease among women aged more or equal 20 years are not known; serosurveys of persons living near confirmed Zika virus disease cases might help to elucidate these findings. Residents of and travelers to Puerto Rico should remove or cover standing water, practice mosquito abatement, employ mosquito bite avoidance behaviors, take precautions to reduce the risk for sexual transmission, and seek medical care for any acute illness with rash or fever.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nRoland H\u00fcbner\nSuperior Health Council\nBrussels\nBelgium\nroland.hubner@sante.belgique.be\n\n[Puerto Rico is a focal area of intense Zika virus transmission, with no end in sight. Both visitors and residents should heed the advice of health authorities for mosquito bite avoidance behaviors, precautions to reduce the risk for sexual transmission, and seeking medical care for any acute illness with rash or fever. - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[3] Synthetic DNA vaccine\nDate: Thu 10 Nov 2016\nSource: Science Daily [edited]\nhttps://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/11/161110125203.htm\n\n\nAs the global spread of the Zika virus continues, efforts are under way to halt the disease's transmission. While no licensed therapies or vaccines to protect against the Zika virus are currently available, new research published in the journal npj Vaccines demonstrates how a synthetic DNA vaccine approach successfully protected against infection, brain damage and death caused by the mosquitoborne Zika virus in vivo.\n\nIn this preclinical study, 100 per cent of the animal models were protected from Zika after vaccination followed by a challenge with the Zika virus. In addition, they were protected from degeneration in the cerebral cortex and hippocampal areas of the brain, while the other cohort showed degeneration of the brain after Zika infection.\n\n\"Our results support the critical importance of immune responses for both preventing infection as well as ameliorating disease caused by the Zika virus,\" said lead researcher David B Weiner PhD, executive vice president and director of the Vaccine Center at The Wistar Institute and the WW Smith Charitable Trust professor in cancer research at Wistar. \"As the threat of Zika continues, these results provide insight into a new aspect of the possibly protective ability of such a vaccine as a preventative approach for Zika infection.\"\n\nThis study is the 1st of its kind to analyze a vaccine in an animal model that is susceptible to the disease, providing information regarding the protective impact of the immune response in susceptible individuals. Prior studies of the Zika virus have tested vaccines in animal models that are naturally resistant to Zika. This study extends these prior research studies in an important manner.\n\nJ Joseph Kim PhD, MBA, president and CEO of Inovio Pharmaceuticals Inc, added, \"Working with Wistar, we have clearly demonstrated the power and the speed of our product development platform when we and our collaborators moved our Zika vaccine from the bench to human studies in less than 6 months, taking advantage of our platform to help in this outbreak situation.\"\n\nIn this latest study, Weiner and colleagues demonstrated how a synthetic DNA vaccine expressed specific antigens for Zika in vivo. They observed that this novel vaccine generated robust antigen-specific antibody and T cell responses that neutralized the virus in preclinical animal models. Moreover, they found that the vaccine provided protection against the disease and death in animal models while also being neuroprotective, meaning that the disease was unable to spread to the brain. This is especially important given the risk that infants born with the disease have of developing microcephaly, a birth defect resulting in an abnormally small head and that may prevent the brain from developing properly.\n\nOne important aspect of Zika and many other mosquitoborne diseases is that not everyone infected with the virus will actually become ill as a result. With Zika, only about 20 to 25 per cent of individuals with the virus are actually impacted by the disease, according to previous studies from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). However, there is no way to know for certain who will be at risk for illness due to the virus, which is why it was crucial for this study to examine how a vaccine would operate in an infected, symptomatic host.\n\nThis Zika vaccine is being developed in collaboration between Inovio, The Wistar Institute, and GeneOne Life Science Inc and is currently being tested in 2 human clinical studies. Before the end of 2016, Inovio expects to report phase I data from the first 40-subject study being conducted in Miami, Philadelphia and Quebec City. In August, the companies also initiated a 2nd study in 160 subjects in Puerto Rico. CDC estimates that Zika will infect more than 25 percent of the Puerto Rican population by the end of the year, creating the potential for this study's placebo-controlled design to provide exploratory signals of vaccine efficacy in 2017.\n\nA total of nearly 4000 cases of Zika infection have been reported in the United States alone, according to CDC. While most of these are travel-associated cases, more than 100 cases of Zika infection originating within the United States have been reported. Globally, more than 60 countries have reported mosquitoborne transmission of the disease.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[These results are very encouraging. Because 80 per cent of individuals who contract Zika virus infections do not develop clinical signs, if these asymptomatic individuals have viremias of sufficiently high magnitude to provide infectious blood meals for vector mosquitoes, or can transmit the virus sexually, it appears that the vast majority, perhaps 80 per cent, of the population at risk would have to be vaccinated in order to halt transmission. It will be interesting to know if pregnant women, especially those in the 1st trimester, can tolerate the vaccine to prevent infection of their fetuses. - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[4] Zika virus origin in Americas, comment\nDate: Thu 10 Nov 2016\nFrom: Stephen Seligman <sseligman@mail.rockefeller.edu> [edited]\n\n\nPhylogenetic analysis of Zika isolates clearly indicates that the origin of the strains circulating in Latin America was in French Polynesia (Pettersson JH, Eldholm V, Seligman SJ, et al. How did Zika virus emerge in the Pacific Islands and Latin America? MBio. 2016;7(5). pii: e01239-16. doi: 10.1128/mBio.01239-16.). There appear to be 2 independent sources for the strains circulating in the Pacific Islands (Oceania). One caused an epidemic in Yap Island, Micronesia (2007) and a 2nd was responsible for the epidemic in French Polynesia (2013-14).\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nStephen J Seligman, MD\nResearch Professor\nNew York Medical College\nValhalla, NY\nAdjunct Professor\nThe Rockefeller University\nNew York, NY\n<sseligman@rockefeller.edu>\n\n\n[ProMED-mail thanks Dr Seligman for his comments, clarifying the origin of Zika virus in the Americas. The way in which the virus was brought from Oceania to the Americas has not been established, but speculation that a viremic person who attended international sporting events in Brazil brought the virus seems likely. -

Incidence of Zika virus disease by age and sex -- Puerto Rico, November 1, 2015-October 20, 2016. MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep. 2016;65(44):1219-1223. doi: 10.15585/mmwr.mm6544a4, PMID: 27832051.\n\nZika virus is a flavivirus transmitted primarily by _Aedes_ species mosquitoes; symptoms of infection include rash, arthralgia, fever, and conjunctivitis. Zika virus infection during pregnancy can cause microcephaly and other serious brain anomalies and in rare cases, Zika virus infection has been associated with Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome and severe thrombocytopenia. This report describes the incidence of reported symptomatic Zika virus disease in the US territory of Puerto Rico by age and sex. During 1 Nov to 20 Oct 2016, 62 500 suspected Zika virus disease cases were reported to the Puerto Rico Department of Health (PRDH); 29 345 (47 per cent) were confirmed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing, or were presumptively diagnosed based on serological testing. The highest incidence among confirmed or presumptive cases occurred among persons aged 20-29 years (1150 cases per 100 000 residents). Among 28 219 (96.2 per cent) nonpregnant patients with confirmed or presumptive Zika virus disease, incidence was higher among women (936 per 100 000 population) than men (576 per 100 000) for all age groups more or equal 20 years, and the majority (61 per cent) of reported Zika virus disease cases occurred in females. Among suspected Zika virus disease cases in nonpregnant adults aged more or equal 40 years, the percentage that tested positive among females (52 per cent) was higher than that among males (47 per cent) (p less than 0.01). Reasons for the higher incidence of Zika virus disease among women aged more or equal 20 years are not known; serosurveys of persons living near confirmed Zika virus disease cases might help to elucidate these findings. Residents of and travelers to Puerto Rico should remove or cover standing water, practice mosquito abatement, employ mosquito bite avoidance behaviors, take precautions to reduce the risk for sexual transmission, and seek medical care for any acute illness with rash or fever.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nRoland H\u00fcbner\nSuperior Health Council\nBrussels\nBelgium\nroland.hubner@sante.belgique.be\n\n[Puerto Rico is a focal area of intense Zika virus transmission, with no end in sight.

While no licensed therapies or vaccines to protect against the Zika virus are currently available, new research published in the journal npj Vaccines demonstrates how a synthetic DNA vaccine approach successfully protected against infection, brain damage and death caused by the mosquitoborne Zika virus in vivo.\n\nIn this preclinical study, 100 per cent of the animal models were protected from Zika after vaccination followed by a challenge with the Zika virus. In addition, they were protected from degeneration in the cerebral cortex and hippocampal areas of the brain, while the other cohort showed degeneration of the brain after Zika infection.\n\n\"Our results support the critical importance of immune responses for both preventing infection as well as ameliorating disease caused by the Zika virus,\" said lead researcher David B Weiner PhD, executive vice president and director of the Vaccine Center at The Wistar Institute and the WW Smith Charitable Trust professor in cancer research at Wistar. \"As the threat of Zika continues, these results provide insight into a new aspect of the possibly protective ability of such a vaccine as a preventative approach for Zika infection.\"\n\nThis study is the 1st of its kind to analyze a vaccine in an animal model that is susceptible to the disease, providing information regarding the protective impact of the immune response in susceptible individuals. Prior studies of the Zika virus have tested vaccines in animal models that are naturally resistant to Zika. This study extends these prior research studies in an important manner.\n\nJ Joseph Kim PhD, MBA, president and CEO of Inovio Pharmaceuticals Inc, added, \"Working with Wistar, we have clearly demonstrated the power and the speed of our product development platform when we and our collaborators moved our Zika vaccine from the bench to human studies in less than 6 months, taking advantage of our platform to help in this outbreak situation.\"\n\nIn this latest study, Weiner and colleagues demonstrated how a synthetic DNA vaccine expressed specific antigens for Zika in vivo. They observed that this novel vaccine generated robust antigen-specific antibody and T cell responses that neutralized the virus in preclinical animal models. Moreover, they found that the vaccine provided protection against the disease and death in animal models while also being neuroprotective, meaning that the disease was unable to spread to the brain. This is especially important given the risk that infants born with the disease have of developing microcephaly, a birth defect resulting in an abnormally small head and that may prevent the brain from developing properly.\n\nOne important aspect of Zika and many other mosquitoborne diseases is that not everyone infected with the virus will actually become ill as a result. With Zika, only about 20 to 25 per cent of individuals with the virus are actually impacted by the disease, according to previous studies from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). However, there is no way to know for certain who will be at risk for illness due to the virus, which is why it was crucial for this study to examine how a vaccine would operate in an infected, symptomatic host.\n\nThis Zika vaccine is being developed in collaboration between Inovio, The Wistar Institute, and GeneOne Life Science Inc and is currently being tested in 2 human clinical studies. Before the end of 2016, Inovio expects to report phase I data from the first 40-subject study being conducted in Miami, Philadelphia and Quebec City. In August, the companies also initiated a 2nd study in 160 subjects in Puerto Rico. CDC estimates that Zika will infect more than 25 percent of the Puerto Rican population by the end of the year, creating the potential for this study's placebo-controlled design to provide exploratory signals of vaccine efficacy in 2017.\n\nA total of nearly 4000 cases of Zika infection have been reported in the United States alone, according to CDC. While most of these are travel-associated cases, more than 100 cases of Zika infection originating within the United States have been reported. Globally, more than 60 countries have reported mosquitoborne transmission of the disease.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[These results are very encouraging. Because 80 per cent of individuals who contract Zika virus infections do not develop clinical signs, if these asymptomatic individuals have viremias of sufficiently high magnitude to provide infectious blood meals for vector mosquitoes, or can transmit the virus sexually, it appears that the vast majority, perhaps 80 per cent, of the population at risk would have to be vaccinated in order to halt transmission. It will be interesting to know if pregnant women, especially those in the 1st trimester, can tolerate the vaccine to prevent infection of their fetuses. - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[4] Zika virus origin in Americas, comment\nDate: Thu 10 Nov 2016\nFrom: Stephen Seligman <sseligman@mail.rockefeller.edu> [edited]\n\n\nPhylogenetic analysis of Zika isolates clearly indicates that the origin of the strains circulating in Latin America was in French Polynesia (Pettersson JH, Eldholm V, Seligman SJ, et al. How did Zika virus emerge in the Pacific Islands and Latin America? MBio. 2016;7(5). pii: e01239-16. doi: 10.1128/mBio.01239-16.). There appear to be 2 independent sources for the strains circulating in the Pacific Islands (Oceania). One caused an epidemic in Yap Island, Micronesia (2007) and a 2nd was responsible for the epidemic in French Polynesia (2013-14).\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nStephen J Seligman, MD\nResearch Professor\nNew York Medical College\nValhalla, NY\nAdjunct Professor\nThe Rockefeller University\nNew York, NY\n<sseligman@rockefeller.edu>\n\n\n[ProMED-mail thanks Dr Seligman for his comments, clarifying the origin of Zika virus in the Americas. The way in which the virus was brought from Oceania to the Americas has not been established, but speculation that a viremic person who attended international sporting events in Brazil brought the virus seems likely. -

Incidence of Zika virus disease by age and sex -- Puerto Rico, November 1, 2015-October 20, 2016. MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep. 2016;65(44):1219-1223. doi: 10.15585/mmwr.mm6544a4, PMID: 27832051.\n\nZika virus is a flavivirus transmitted primarily by _Aedes_ species mosquitoes; symptoms of infection include rash, arthralgia, fever, and conjunctivitis. Zika virus infection during pregnancy can cause microcephaly and other serious brain anomalies and in rare cases, Zika virus infection has been associated with Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome and severe thrombocytopenia. This report describes the incidence of reported symptomatic Zika virus disease in the US territory of Puerto Rico by age and sex. During 1 Nov to 20 Oct 2016, 62 500 suspected Zika virus disease cases were reported to the Puerto Rico Department of Health (PRDH); 29 345 (47 per cent) were confirmed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing, or were presumptively diagnosed based on serological testing. The highest incidence among confirmed or presumptive cases occurred among persons aged 20-29 years (1150 cases per 100 000 residents). Among 28 219 (96.2 per cent) nonpregnant patients with confirmed or presumptive Zika virus disease, incidence was higher among women (936 per 100 000 population) than men (576 per 100 000) for all age groups more or equal 20 years, and the majority (61 per cent) of reported Zika virus disease cases occurred in females. Among suspected Zika virus disease cases in nonpregnant adults aged more or equal 40 years, the percentage that tested positive among females (52 per cent) was higher than that among males (47 per cent) (p less than 0.01). Reasons for the higher incidence of Zika virus disease among women aged more or equal 20 years are not known; serosurveys of persons living near confirmed Zika virus disease cases might help to elucidate these findings. Residents of and travelers to Puerto Rico should remove or cover standing water, practice mosquito abatement, employ mosquito bite avoidance behaviors, take precautions to reduce the risk for sexual transmission, and seek medical care for any acute illness with rash or fever.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nRoland H\u00fcbner\nSuperior Health Council\nBrussels\nBelgium\nroland.hubner@sante.belgique.be\n\n[Puerto Rico is a focal area of intense Zika virus transmission, with no end in sight.

While no licensed therapies or vaccines to protect against the Zika virus are currently available, new research published in the journal npj Vaccines demonstrates how a synthetic DNA vaccine approach successfully protected against infection, brain damage and death caused by the mosquitoborne Zika virus in vivo.\n\nIn this preclinical study, 100 per cent of the animal models were protected from Zika after vaccination followed by a challenge with the Zika virus. In addition, they were protected from degeneration in the cerebral cortex and hippocampal areas of the brain, while the other cohort showed degeneration of the brain after Zika infection.\n\n\"Our results support the critical importance of immune responses for both preventing infection as well as ameliorating disease caused by the Zika virus,\" said lead researcher David B Weiner PhD, executive vice president and director of the Vaccine Center at The Wistar Institute and the WW Smith Charitable Trust professor in cancer research at Wistar. \"As the threat of Zika continues, these results provide insight into a new aspect of the possibly protective ability of such a vaccine as a preventative approach for Zika infection.\"\n\nThis study is the 1st of its kind to analyze a vaccine in an animal model that is susceptible to the disease, providing information regarding the protective impact of the immune response in susceptible individuals. Prior studies of the Zika virus have tested vaccines in animal models that are naturally resistant to Zika. This study extends these prior research studies in an important manner.\n\nJ Joseph Kim PhD, MBA, president and CEO of Inovio Pharmaceuticals Inc, added, \"Working with Wistar, we have clearly demonstrated the power and the speed of our product development platform when we and our collaborators moved our Zika vaccine from the bench to human studies in less than 6 months, taking advantage of our platform to help in this outbreak situation.\"\n\nIn this latest study, Weiner and colleagues demonstrated how a synthetic DNA vaccine expressed specific antigens for Zika in vivo. They observed that this novel vaccine generated robust antigen-specific antibody and T cell responses that neutralized the virus in preclinical animal models. Moreover, they found that the vaccine provided protection against the disease and death in animal models while also being neuroprotective, meaning that the disease was unable to spread to the brain. This is especially important given the risk that infants born with the disease have of developing microcephaly, a birth defect resulting in an abnormally small head and that may prevent the brain from developing properly.\n\nOne important aspect of Zika and many other mosquitoborne diseases is that not everyone infected with the virus will actually become ill as a result. With Zika, only about 20 to 25 per cent of individuals with the virus are actually impacted by the disease, according to previous studies from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). However, there is no way to know for certain who will be at risk for illness due to the virus, which is why it was crucial for this study to examine how a vaccine would operate in an infected, symptomatic host.\n\nThis Zika vaccine is being developed in collaboration between Inovio, The Wistar Institute, and GeneOne Life Science Inc and is currently being tested in 2 human clinical studies. Before the end of 2016, Inovio expects to report phase I data from the first 40-subject study being conducted in Miami, Philadelphia and Quebec City. In August, the companies also initiated a 2nd study in 160 subjects in Puerto Rico. CDC estimates that Zika will infect more than 25 percent of the Puerto Rican population by the end of the year, creating the potential for this study's placebo-controlled design to provide exploratory signals of vaccine efficacy in 2017.\n\nA total of nearly 4000 cases of Zika infection have been reported in the United States alone, according to CDC. While most of these are travel-associated cases, more than 100 cases of Zika infection originating within the United States have been reported. Globally, more than 60 countries have reported mosquitoborne transmission of the disease.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[These results are very encouraging. Because 80 per cent of individuals who contract Zika virus infections do not develop clinical signs, if these asymptomatic individuals have viremias of sufficiently high magnitude to provide infectious blood meals for vector mosquitoes, or can transmit the virus sexually, it appears that the vast majority, perhaps 80 per cent, of the population at risk would have to be vaccinated in order to halt transmission. It will be interesting to know if pregnant women, especially those in the 1st trimester, can tolerate the vaccine to prevent infection of their fetuses. - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[4] Zika virus origin in Americas, comment\nDate: Thu 10 Nov 2016\nFrom: Stephen Seligman <sseligman@mail.rockefeller.edu> [edited]\n\n\nPhylogenetic analysis of Zika isolates clearly indicates that the origin of the strains circulating in Latin America was in French Polynesia (Pettersson JH, Eldholm V, Seligman SJ, et al. How did Zika virus emerge in the Pacific Islands and Latin America? MBio. 2016;7(5). pii: e01239-16. doi: 10.1128/mBio.01239-16.). There appear to be 2 independent sources for the strains circulating in the Pacific Islands (Oceania). One caused an epidemic in Yap Island, Micronesia (2007) and a 2nd was responsible for the epidemic in French Polynesia (2013-14).\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nStephen J Seligman, MD\nResearch Professor\nNew York Medical College\nValhalla, NY\nAdjunct Professor\nThe Rockefeller University\nNew York, NY\n<sseligman@rockefeller.edu>\n\n\n[ProMED-mail thanks Dr Seligman for his comments, clarifying the origin of Zika virus in the Americas. The way in which the virus was brought from Oceania to the Americas has not been established, but speculation that a viremic person who attended international sporting events in Brazil brought the virus seems likely. -

(conf.) The patient is a 34-year-old male tourist, who visited the Maldives from 3-13 Jun 2016 (relevant for cross-reacting antibodies with regard to Zika virus assays). On 16 Jun 2016 he developed retro-orbital pain and on 17 Jun 2016 a diffuse maculopapular rash that spared his face and hands, and joint pains in the wrists, ankles, proximal interphalangeal joints. He presented initially on 22 Jun 2016 (day 6 after symptom onset) at the outpatient department of the Division of Infectious Diseases and Tropical Medicine at LMU. Upon presentation the only remaining symptom was arthralgia. No symptoms were present after 8 days.\n\nThe diagnosis of a ZIKV infection was established by ZIKV IgG and IgM through an IFAT assay. ZIKV was also confirmed directly using a commercially available real-time reverse transcriptase assay RealStar Zika RT PCR Kit (Altona, Hamburg, Germany) in whole blood and urine samples on day 6. Urine samples did not turn positive again, whereas whole blood remained positive until 26 Jul 2016 (day 40 after symptom onset). The symptoms subsided altogether after about 8 days. Ejaculate, oral swabs and serum did not show any positive result at any time. The viral strain was identified by an in-house PCR assay as the Asian lineage that is also responsible for the ZIKV outbreak in Latin America.\n\nThe Maldives are listed in the recent WHO Zika Situational Report of 22 Sep 2016 as a country with known prior ZIKV transmission (country category 3: transmission in 2015 and before) but with no reported transmission in 2016. However, this case is evidence of ongoing ZIKV transmission. The Maldives are widely considered as \"safe\" for honeymoon couples and those wishing to become pregnant (babymoon), for whom currently many destinations in the tropical regions of the world are off limits due to ongoing Zika transmission. However, the Maldives should now also be considered as a destination of ongoing transmission.\n\nReport submitted by Guenter Froeschl, Kristina Huber, Frank von Sonnenburg, and Silke Woelfel Munich GeoSentinel Site and Patricia Schlagenhauf, Chair - GeoSentinel Tracking & Communications Working Group via Davidson H.

South-east Asian Zika virus strain linked to cluster of cases in Singapore, August 2016.\n\nSummary\nZika virus (ZIKV) is an ongoing global public health emergency with 70 countries and territories reporting evidence of ZIKV transmission since 2015. On 27 Aug 2016, Singapore reported its 1st case of local ZIKV transmission and identified an ongoing cluster. Here, we report the genome sequences of ZIKV strains from 2 cases and find through phylogenetic analysis that these strains form an earlier branch distinct from the recent large outbreak in the Americas.\n\nConclusions from sequence and structure analysis\nAt least within the Asian lineage the antigenic protein E surface is highly conserved and homogeneous with, from 2007 onwards, typical identities from 99.4 percent to 100 percent (or 3 to zero mutations) relative to the consensus of recent strains from Brazil. Moreover all of the E proteins in this lineage contain the typical N-glycosylation site (N444 in polyprotein numbering which is N154 in the E protein). The lack of surface mutation drift over the past 50 years (99 percent identity between Malaysia 1966 and consensus of Brazil 2015) also suggests that immune pressure on the E protein has not been a dominant factor in the Asian lineages' virus fitness and evolution so far. While the highly similar surface E proteins of the different strains in the Asian lineage should facilitate global vaccine development it is too early to judge if the strain linked to the Singapore outbreak would show any different disease characteristics from the one in French Polynesia and the Americas. Further studies are necessary and underway in Singapore to collect more data.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n[It is interesting that the Zika virus circulating in Singapore is not the same as that currently circulating in the Americas. One wonders where in Asia it came from, and leads one to speculate that Zika virus is circulating in Asia at low levels and is often undetected or mistaken for dengue cases. - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[3] CDC travel advisory, Asia\nDate: Thu 29 Sep 2016\nSource: CDC [edited]\nhttps://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/zika-virus-southeast-asia\n\n\nZika Virus in Southeast Asia\n----------------------------\nWhat is the current situation?\nTravelers have returned from certain areas of Southeast Asia with Zika virus infection. While our understanding of the complications of Zika virus infection continues to evolve, and pending broader international surveillance efforts for Zika virus infection, we are providing pregnant women and their partners updated recommendations on reducing their risk for travel related Zika virus infection. CDC recommends pregnant women should consider postponing nonessential travel to Southeast Asia countries with reports of Zika virus infection from local transmission or related to travel to those countries, and those countries with adjacent borders where limited information is available to fully evaluate risk of Zika virus infection.\n\nZika virus has been present in areas of Southeast Asia for many years, and several countries have reported occasional cases or small outbreaks of Zika virus infections. Zika virus is considered endemic in some countries, and a large number of local residents are likely to be immune. However, US travelers to endemic areas may not be immune to Zika virus and infections have occurred among travelers to Southeast Asia. Recent variations have been observed in the number of cases reported in Southeast Asia. This can reflect changes in awareness of Zika virus, surveillance and testing for Zika virus, or changes in intensity of Zika virus transmission. Pregnant women traveling to Southeast Asia could become infected with Zika virus. The level of this risk is unknown and likely lower than in areas where Zika virus is newly introduced and spreading widely.\n\nCountries included in this travel message include those listed below. For country-specific information, please visit Health Information for Travelers for individual countries:\nBrunei\nBurma (Myanmar)\nCambodia\nIndonesia\nLaos\nMalaysia\nMaldives\nPhilippines\nThailand\nTimor-Leste (East Timor)\nVietnam\n\nTravel Considerations for Pregnant Women Traveling to Southeast Asia\nZika virus infection during pregnancy causes severe birth defects, including microcephaly and severe fetal brain abnormalities. Therefore, pregnant women should talk with their healthcare provider and consider postponing nonessential travel to Southeast Asia. Zika virus testing should be offered to pregnant women and considered for other people who have symptoms of Zika virus disease if they have recently traveled to Southeast Asia.\n\nWhat can travelers do to prevent Zika?\nThere is no vaccine or medicine for Zika virus infection. Travelers can protect themselves by preventing mosquito bites:\n- Cover exposed skin by wearing long-sleeved shirts and long pants.\n- Use EPA-registered insect repellents containing DEET, picaridin, oil of lemon eucalyptus (OLE, also called para-menthane-diol [PMD]), or IR3535. Always use as directed.\n- Pregnant and breastfeeding women can use all EPA-registered insect repellents, including DEET, according to the product label.\n- Most repellents, including DEET, can be used on children older than 2 months. (OLE should not be used on children younger than 3 years.)\n- Use permethrin-treated clothing and gear (such as boots, pants, socks, and tents). You can buy pre-treated clothing and gear or treat them yourself.\n- Stay in places with air conditioning and window and door screens to keep mosquitoes outside.\n- Sleep under a mosquito bed net if air conditioned or screened rooms are not available or if sleeping outdoors.\n- Mosquito netting can be used to cover babies younger than 2 months old in carriers, strollers, or cribs to protect them from mosquito bites.\n- Zika virus can be passed through sex from a person who has Zika virus to his or her sex partners. The use of condoms during sex (vaginal, anal, and oral) or abstaining from sex while traveling to these areas and after returning from these areas is recommended to avoid getting or passing Zika virus infection.\n\nAfter travel:\nMany people infected with Zika virus do not feel sick. If a mosquito bites an infected person while the virus is still in that person's blood, it can spread the virus by biting another person. Even if they do not feel sick, travelers returning to the United States from countries where Zika virus is endemic should take steps to prevent mosquito bites for 3 weeks so that they do not spread Zika virus to uninfected mosquitoes.\nTravelers returning from countries where Zika virus is endemic and who have a pregnant partner should either use condoms or not have sex for the rest of the pregnancy.\n\nFor more information, see Zika and Sexual Transmission [http://www.cdc.gov/zika/transmission/sexual-transmission.html].\n\nIf you feel sick and think you may have Zika virus:\n- Talk to your doctor if you develop a fever with a rash, joint pain, or red eyes. Tell him or her about your travel.\n- Take acetaminophen (paracetamol) to relieve fever and pain. Do not take aspirin, products containing aspirin, or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as ibuprofen.\n- Get lots of rest and drink plenty of liquids.\n\nIf you are pregnant:\nTalk to a doctor or other healthcare provider after your trip, even if you don't feel sick. Pregnant women who have symptoms and have traveled to these countries should be offered testing for Zika virus infection. Pregnant women who have symptoms and who have had a possible sexual exposure during pregnancy to a partner who traveled to these countries should be offered testing for Zika virus infection.\n- If you develop a fever with a rash, joint pain, or red eyes, talk to your doctor immediately and tell him or her about your travel or possible sexual exposure.\n\nClinician Information\nZika virus during pregnancy causes severe birth defects, including microcephaly and severe fetal brain abnormalities. All pregnant women should be evaluated for possible Zika virus exposure and signs or symptoms consistent with Zika virus disease at each prenatal care visit.\n\nPossible exposures include\n- Travel to an area where there is epidemic or endemic Zika virus transmission\n- Sex with a partner who has traveled to or lived in an area with epidemic or endemic Zika virus transmission\n\nThe recommendations for testing vary according to whether exposure occurred in an area where Zika virus has been newly introduced and is spreading widely or in an area with endemic Zika virus transmission. Dengue and Japanese encephalitis viruses circulate widely in Southeast Asia and might cause false positive results in blood tests. Because of this and related testing factors, routine serologic testing of asymptomatic pregnant women who have traveled to areas of Southeast Asia without epidemic Zika virus transmission is not recommended.

Hanson, M.D., M.H.S., Marc R. Couturier, Ph.D.. Fatal Zika Virus Infection with Secondary Nonsexual Transmission.\n\nEpidemic transmission of Zika virus (ZIKV) has rapidly occurred in the Americas, with most cases limited to mild or asymptomatic disease. To date, 9 deaths from ZIKV infection that were unrelated to the Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome have been confirmed in adults. Here, we report a rapidly progressive, fatal ZIKV infection acquired outside the United States and secondary local transmission in the absence of known risk factors for ZIKV infection.\n\nPatient 1, a 73-year-old man who had emigrated to the United States from Mexico in 2003, was admitted to a hospital in Salt Lake City [Utah] with hypotension and abdominal pain. Radiation therapy for stage IIB prostate cancer had been completed 1 month earlier, and he was receiving antiandrogen therapy but was otherwise not systemically immunocompromised. 8 days before admission, he had returned from a 3-week trip to the southwest coast of Mexico, where ZIKV transmission had been reported. He was well during his trip but reported being bitten by mosquitoes. After returning home, he reported having abdominal pain, pharyngitis, and fever, which was followed by conjunctivitis, nonbloody diarrhea, and myalgias.\n\nOn the day of admission, hypotension and dyspnea had developed. The patient was alert and oriented with no fever but with tachypnea and tachycardia. He remained hypotensive after the administration of intravenous fluids, and vasopressors and broad-spectrum antibiotics were initiated. The physical examination was remarkable for marked erythematous conjunctivitis with profuse tearing and soft-palate petechiae, tachypnea, and moderate, diffuse abdominal pain with mild guarding. A tourniquet test (which is often performed in patients in whom dengue is suspected) was negative.\n\nLaboratory testing revealed metabolic acidosis, an elevated venous lactate level, renal insufficiency, mild hypoglycemia, elevated aminotransferase levels, leukocytosis with 44 percent band forms, anemia, and marked thrombocytopenia. (Details are provided in the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this letter at NEJM.org.) Testing for malaria and blood cultures were negative. A presumptive diagnosis of dengue shock syndrome was made. The patient's clinical deterioration progressed, with progressive respiratory and renal failure, metabolic acidosis, and hepatitis. On day 4 of hospitalization, the patient died shortly after care was withdrawn.\n\nTesting was negative for dengue virus (DENV) on polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) assay. Serologic analysis for DENV was consistent with remote infection, with a highly elevated IgG level and an equivocal IgM level. Serum testing for ZIKV on real-time PCR assay was positive, with a threshold cycle of 17 and a very high estimated viral load of 2.0 x 10^8 ZIKV genome copies per milliliter. High-throughput sequencing of RNA revealed the presence of a ZIKV strain that shared 99.8 percent of the genome sequence with a strain isolated from a mosquito in Chiapas, Mexico, in 2016. No other putative pathogen was detected by routine diagnostic testing and RNA sequencing.\n\n5 days after Patient 1 died, Patient 2, a previously healthy 38-year-old man with no known coexisting illnesses who had visited Patient 1 in the hospital, reported having conjunctivitis, fevers, myalgia, and facial maculopapular rash. The rash became generalized but resolved within 7 days. On day 7 after the onset of symptoms, urinalysis was positive for ZIKV but serum was negative on PCR assay. Serum IgM antibody to ZIKV was positive. Patient 2 reported having assisted a nurse in repositioning Patient 1 in bed without using gloves. Patient 2 also reported having wiped Patient 1's eyes during the hospitalization but reported having had no other overt contact with blood or other body fluids, including splashes or mucous membrane exposure. No health care workers who had contact with Patient 1 reported having symptomatic illness.\n\nIt is likely that Patient 2 acquired the infection from Patient 1, since Patient 2 had not traveled to an area in which ZIKV is endemic in more than 9 months and had not had sex with a partner who had traveled to such areas. Given the very high level of viremia in Patient 1, infectious levels of virus may have been present in sweat or tears, both of which Patient 2 contacted without gloves. Transmission of the infection through a mosquito bite appears to be unlikely, since _Aedes_ species that are known to transmit ZIKV have not been detected in the Salt Lake City area. In addition, the 2nd case occurred 7 to 10 days after contact with the index patient in the hospital, which implicates direct contact during hospitalization.\n\nThese 2 cases illustrate several important points. The spectrum of those at risk for fulminant ZIKV infection may be broader than previously recognized, and those who are not severely immunocompromised or chronically ill may nevertheless be at risk for fatal infection. The effect of previous infection with related flaviviruses cannot be assessed and may increase the risk of severe ZIKV infection. The transmission of flaviviruses through intact skin or mucous membranes, although uncommon, has been shown in experimental animal models and in at least one human case. Whether contact with highly infectious body fluids from patients with severe ZIKV infection poses an increased risk of transmission is an important question that requires further research.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n[Zika virus shedding in tears has been demonstrated previously. Given Patient 1's high viremia, it seems entirely possible that this is the route of exposure of patient 2, who attended patient 1 without gloves. Perhaps patient 2 touched his eyes or mouth with virus contaminated hands or had a cut. This report establishes with 1st fatal case of Zika virus infection in the USA. It also is the 1st case of transmission by non-sexual direct contact. - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[5] Zika virus infections in children, USA\nDate: Fri 30 Sep 2016\nSource: MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep. ePub: 30 September 2016.

Characteristics of Children Aged Less Than 18 Years with Zika Virus Disease Acquired Postnatally -- U.S. States, January 2015-July 2016.\n\nGuillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome and other neurologic complications can occur in adults after Zika virus infection. However, there are few published reports describing postnatally acquired Zika virus disease among children. During January 2015-July 2016, a total of 158 cases of confirmed or probable postnatally acquired Zika virus disease among children aged less than 18 years were reported to CDC from U.S. states. The median age was 14 years (range = 1 month-17 years), and 88 (56 percent) were female. 2 (1 percent) patients were hospitalized; none developed Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, and none died. All reported cases were travel-associated. Overall, 129 (82 percent) children had rash, 87 (55 percent) had fever, 45 (29 percent) had conjunctivitis, and 44 (28 percent) had arthralgia. 5 (3 percent) patients were pregnant, all of whom were aged 16-17 years. No children were reported to have meningitis, encephalitis, or Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome. Health care providers should consider a diagnosis of Zika virus disease in children who have an epidemiologic risk factor and clinically compatible illness, and should report cases to their state or local health department.\n\nThe symptoms most frequently reported among children with Zika virus disease are common to many childhood illnesses. Health care providers should consider Zika virus disease in the differential diagnosis for children with the acute onset of fever, rash, arthralgia, or conjunctivitis, who reside in or have a history of travel to an area where active Zika virus transmission is occurring, or who have another epidemiologic risk factor for Zika virus disease. Children with suspected Zika virus disease should have blood and urine specimens collected and tested per current guidelines. Although Zika virus disease appears to be a mild illness in children, health care providers should report suspected cases to their state or local health department to facilitate diagnosis and mitigate the risk for local transmission. Providers should counsel sexually active adolescents who might be exposed to Zika virus regarding the risk for congenital Zika virus infection and prevention of unintended pregnancies. Guidance for health care providers caring for infants and children with possible postnatally acquired Zika virus disease is available online (http://www.cdc.gov/zika/hc-providers/infants-children.html).\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[More details are available in this report that can be accessed at the above URL. - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[6] Diagnostic test\nDate: Mon 26 Sep 2016\nSource: Reuters [edited]\nhttp://www.reuters.com/article/us-vela-diagnostics-fda-idUSKCN11W1BO\n\n\nVela Diagnostics said its test for the Zika virus had received \"emergency use authorization\" from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration [FDA].\n\nThe test, already approved in Europe, is validated for plasma, serum and urine samples, the Singapore-based company said on Monday [26 Sep 2016].\n\nThe FDA issues such emergency use authorization during public health emergencies, to quickly deploy unapproved medical products for as long as they are needed. The regulator last month [August 2016] issued a similar authorization for a Zika diagnostics test from Swiss drugmaker Roche.\n\nZika, which was detected in Brazil, has spread to the Americas and is associated with microcephaly, a birth defect characterized by an unusually small head and potential developmental problems. In adults, it has been linked to Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, a temporary paralysis.\n\nThe disease has since spread to parts of Southeast Asia.

Brazil has been the country hardest hit so far, with more than 1800 reported cases of microcephaly.\n\nWysoka's team cautioned that their work did not provide direct proof that Zika virus infects cranial neural crest cells in live animals or humans. Follow-up research would also be needed to look for any evidence that the virus' effect on these cells would be enough to cause microcephaly, they said.\n\n[Byline: Kate Kelland; editing by Alison

(conf.) The patient is a 34-year-old male tourist, who visited the Maldives from 3-13 Jun 2016 (relevant for cross-reacting antibodies with regard to Zika virus assays). On 16 Jun 2016 he developed retro-orbital pain and on 17 Jun 2016 a diffuse maculopapular rash that spared his face and hands, and joint pains in the wrists, ankles, proximal interphalangeal joints. He presented initially on 22 Jun 2016 (day 6 after symptom onset) at the outpatient department of the Division of Infectious Diseases and Tropical Medicine at LMU. Upon presentation the only remaining symptom was arthralgia. No symptoms were present after 8 days.\n\nThe diagnosis of a ZIKV infection was established by ZIKV IgG and IgM through an IFAT assay. ZIKV was also confirmed directly using a commercially available real-time reverse transcriptase assay RealStar Zika RT PCR Kit (Altona, Hamburg, Germany) in whole blood and urine samples on day 6. Urine samples did not turn positive again, whereas whole blood remained positive until 26 Jul 2016 (day 40 after symptom onset). The symptoms subsided altogether after about 8 days. Ejaculate, oral swabs and serum did not show any positive result at any time. The viral strain was identified by an in-house PCR assay as the Asian lineage that is also responsible for the ZIKV outbreak in Latin America.\n\nThe Maldives are listed in the recent WHO Zika Situational Report of 22 Sep 2016 as a country with known prior ZIKV transmission (country category 3: transmission in 2015 and before) but with no reported transmission in 2016. However, this case is evidence of ongoing ZIKV transmission. The Maldives are widely considered as \"safe\" for honeymoon couples and those wishing to become pregnant (babymoon), for whom currently many destinations in the tropical regions of the world are off limits due to ongoing Zika transmission. However, the Maldives should now also be considered as a destination of ongoing transmission.\n\nReport submitted by Guenter Froeschl, Kristina Huber, Frank von Sonnenburg, and Silke Woelfel Munich GeoSentinel Site and Patricia Schlagenhauf, Chair - GeoSentinel Tracking & Communications Working Group via Davidson H.

South-east Asian Zika virus strain linked to cluster of cases in Singapore, August 2016.\n\nSummary\nZika virus (ZIKV) is an ongoing global public health emergency with 70 countries and territories reporting evidence of ZIKV transmission since 2015. On 27 Aug 2016, Singapore reported its 1st case of local ZIKV transmission and identified an ongoing cluster. Here, we report the genome sequences of ZIKV strains from 2 cases and find through phylogenetic analysis that these strains form an earlier branch distinct from the recent large outbreak in the Americas.\n\nConclusions from sequence and structure analysis\nAt least within the Asian lineage the antigenic protein E surface is highly conserved and homogeneous with, from 2007 onwards, typical identities from 99.4 percent to 100 percent (or 3 to zero mutations) relative to the consensus of recent strains from Brazil. Moreover all of the E proteins in this lineage contain the typical N-glycosylation site (N444 in polyprotein numbering which is N154 in the E protein). The lack of surface mutation drift over the past 50 years (99 percent identity between Malaysia 1966 and consensus of Brazil 2015) also suggests that immune pressure on the E protein has not been a dominant factor in the Asian lineages' virus fitness and evolution so far. While the highly similar surface E proteins of the different strains in the Asian lineage should facilitate global vaccine development it is too early to judge if the strain linked to the Singapore outbreak would show any different disease characteristics from the one in French Polynesia and the Americas. Further studies are necessary and underway in Singapore to collect more data.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n[It is interesting that the Zika virus circulating in Singapore is not the same as that currently circulating in the Americas. One wonders where in Asia it came from, and leads one to speculate that Zika virus is circulating in Asia at low levels and is often undetected or mistaken for dengue cases. - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[3] CDC travel advisory, Asia\nDate: Thu 29 Sep 2016\nSource: CDC [edited]\nhttps://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/zika-virus-southeast-asia\n\n\nZika Virus in Southeast Asia\n----------------------------\nWhat is the current situation?\nTravelers have returned from certain areas of Southeast Asia with Zika virus infection. While our understanding of the complications of Zika virus infection continues to evolve, and pending broader international surveillance efforts for Zika virus infection, we are providing pregnant women and their partners updated recommendations on reducing their risk for travel related Zika virus infection. CDC recommends pregnant women should consider postponing nonessential travel to Southeast Asia countries with reports of Zika virus infection from local transmission or related to travel to those countries, and those countries with adjacent borders where limited information is available to fully evaluate risk of Zika virus infection.\n\nZika virus has been present in areas of Southeast Asia for many years, and several countries have reported occasional cases or small outbreaks of Zika virus infections. Zika virus is considered endemic in some countries, and a large number of local residents are likely to be immune. However, US travelers to endemic areas may not be immune to Zika virus and infections have occurred among travelers to Southeast Asia. Recent variations have been observed in the number of cases reported in Southeast Asia. This can reflect changes in awareness of Zika virus, surveillance and testing for Zika virus, or changes in intensity of Zika virus transmission. Pregnant women traveling to Southeast Asia could become infected with Zika virus. The level of this risk is unknown and likely lower than in areas where Zika virus is newly introduced and spreading widely.\n\nCountries included in this travel message include those listed below. For country-specific information, please visit Health Information for Travelers for individual countries:\nBrunei\nBurma (Myanmar)\nCambodia\nIndonesia\nLaos\nMalaysia\nMaldives\nPhilippines\nThailand\nTimor-Leste (East Timor)\nVietnam\n\nTravel Considerations for Pregnant Women Traveling to Southeast Asia\nZika virus infection during pregnancy causes severe birth defects, including microcephaly and severe fetal brain abnormalities. Therefore, pregnant women should talk with their healthcare provider and consider postponing nonessential travel to Southeast Asia. Zika virus testing should be offered to pregnant women and considered for other people who have symptoms of Zika virus disease if they have recently traveled to Southeast Asia.\n\nWhat can travelers do to prevent Zika?\nThere is no vaccine or medicine for Zika virus infection. Travelers can protect themselves by preventing mosquito bites:\n- Cover exposed skin by wearing long-sleeved shirts and long pants.\n- Use EPA-registered insect repellents containing DEET, picaridin, oil of lemon eucalyptus (OLE, also called para-menthane-diol [PMD]), or IR3535. Always use as directed.\n- Pregnant and breastfeeding women can use all EPA-registered insect repellents, including DEET, according to the product label.\n- Most repellents, including DEET, can be used on children older than 2 months. (OLE should not be used on children younger than 3 years.)\n- Use permethrin-treated clothing and gear (such as boots, pants, socks, and tents). You can buy pre-treated clothing and gear or treat them yourself.\n- Stay in places with air conditioning and window and door screens to keep mosquitoes outside.\n- Sleep under a mosquito bed net if air conditioned or screened rooms are not available or if sleeping outdoors.\n- Mosquito netting can be used to cover babies younger than 2 months old in carriers, strollers, or cribs to protect them from mosquito bites.\n- Zika virus can be passed through sex from a person who has Zika virus to his or her sex partners. The use of condoms during sex (vaginal, anal, and oral) or abstaining from sex while traveling to these areas and after returning from these areas is recommended to avoid getting or passing Zika virus infection.\n\nAfter travel:\nMany people infected with Zika virus do not feel sick. If a mosquito bites an infected person while the virus is still in that person's blood, it can spread the virus by biting another person. Even if they do not feel sick, travelers returning to the United States from countries where Zika virus is endemic should take steps to prevent mosquito bites for 3 weeks so that they do not spread Zika virus to uninfected mosquitoes.\nTravelers returning from countries where Zika virus is endemic and who have a pregnant partner should either use condoms or not have sex for the rest of the pregnancy.\n\nFor more information, see Zika and Sexual Transmission [http://www.cdc.gov/zika/transmission/sexual-transmission.html].\n\nIf you feel sick and think you may have Zika virus:\n- Talk to your doctor if you develop a fever with a rash, joint pain, or red eyes. Tell him or her about your travel.\n- Take acetaminophen (paracetamol) to relieve fever and pain. Do not take aspirin, products containing aspirin, or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as ibuprofen.\n- Get lots of rest and drink plenty of liquids.\n\nIf you are pregnant:\nTalk to a doctor or other healthcare provider after your trip, even if you don't feel sick. Pregnant women who have symptoms and have traveled to these countries should be offered testing for Zika virus infection. Pregnant women who have symptoms and who have had a possible sexual exposure during pregnancy to a partner who traveled to these countries should be offered testing for Zika virus infection.\n- If you develop a fever with a rash, joint pain, or red eyes, talk to your doctor immediately and tell him or her about your travel or possible sexual exposure.\n\nClinician Information\nZika virus during pregnancy causes severe birth defects, including microcephaly and severe fetal brain abnormalities. All pregnant women should be evaluated for possible Zika virus exposure and signs or symptoms consistent with Zika virus disease at each prenatal care visit.\n\nPossible exposures include\n- Travel to an area where there is epidemic or endemic Zika virus transmission\n- Sex with a partner who has traveled to or lived in an area with epidemic or endemic Zika virus transmission\n\nThe recommendations for testing vary according to whether exposure occurred in an area where Zika virus has been newly introduced and is spreading widely or in an area with endemic Zika virus transmission. Dengue and Japanese encephalitis viruses circulate widely in Southeast Asia and might cause false positive results in blood tests. Because of this and related testing factors, routine serologic testing of asymptomatic pregnant women who have traveled to areas of Southeast Asia without epidemic Zika virus transmission is not recommended.

Hanson, M.D., M.H.S., Marc R. Couturier, Ph.D.. Fatal Zika Virus Infection with Secondary Nonsexual Transmission.\n\nEpidemic transmission of Zika virus (ZIKV) has rapidly occurred in the Americas, with most cases limited to mild or asymptomatic disease. To date, 9 deaths from ZIKV infection that were unrelated to the Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome have been confirmed in adults. Here, we report a rapidly progressive, fatal ZIKV infection acquired outside the United States and secondary local transmission in the absence of known risk factors for ZIKV infection.\n\nPatient 1, a 73-year-old man who had emigrated to the United States from Mexico in 2003, was admitted to a hospital in Salt Lake City [Utah] with hypotension and abdominal pain. Radiation therapy for stage IIB prostate cancer had been completed 1 month earlier, and he was receiving antiandrogen therapy but was otherwise not systemically immunocompromised. 8 days before admission, he had returned from a 3-week trip to the southwest coast of Mexico, where ZIKV transmission had been reported. He was well during his trip but reported being bitten by mosquitoes. After returning home, he reported having abdominal pain, pharyngitis, and fever, which was followed by conjunctivitis, nonbloody diarrhea, and myalgias.\n\nOn the day of admission, hypotension and dyspnea had developed. The patient was alert and oriented with no fever but with tachypnea and tachycardia. He remained hypotensive after the administration of intravenous fluids, and vasopressors and broad-spectrum antibiotics were initiated. The physical examination was remarkable for marked erythematous conjunctivitis with profuse tearing and soft-palate petechiae, tachypnea, and moderate, diffuse abdominal pain with mild guarding. A tourniquet test (which is often performed in patients in whom dengue is suspected) was negative.\n\nLaboratory testing revealed metabolic acidosis, an elevated venous lactate level, renal insufficiency, mild hypoglycemia, elevated aminotransferase levels, leukocytosis with 44 percent band forms, anemia, and marked thrombocytopenia. (Details are provided in the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this letter at NEJM.org.) Testing for malaria and blood cultures were negative. A presumptive diagnosis of dengue shock syndrome was made. The patient's clinical deterioration progressed, with progressive respiratory and renal failure, metabolic acidosis, and hepatitis. On day 4 of hospitalization, the patient died shortly after care was withdrawn.\n\nTesting was negative for dengue virus (DENV) on polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) assay. Serologic analysis for DENV was consistent with remote infection, with a highly elevated IgG level and an equivocal IgM level. Serum testing for ZIKV on real-time PCR assay was positive, with a threshold cycle of 17 and a very high estimated viral load of 2.0 x 10^8 ZIKV genome copies per milliliter. High-throughput sequencing of RNA revealed the presence of a ZIKV strain that shared 99.8 percent of the genome sequence with a strain isolated from a mosquito in Chiapas, Mexico, in 2016. No other putative pathogen was detected by routine diagnostic testing and RNA sequencing.\n\n5 days after Patient 1 died, Patient 2, a previously healthy 38-year-old man with no known coexisting illnesses who had visited Patient 1 in the hospital, reported having conjunctivitis, fevers, myalgia, and facial maculopapular rash. The rash became generalized but resolved within 7 days. On day 7 after the onset of symptoms, urinalysis was positive for ZIKV but serum was negative on PCR assay. Serum IgM antibody to ZIKV was positive. Patient 2 reported having assisted a nurse in repositioning Patient 1 in bed without using gloves. Patient 2 also reported having wiped Patient 1's eyes during the hospitalization but reported having had no other overt contact with blood or other body fluids, including splashes or mucous membrane exposure. No health care workers who had contact with Patient 1 reported having symptomatic illness.\n\nIt is likely that Patient 2 acquired the infection from Patient 1, since Patient 2 had not traveled to an area in which ZIKV is endemic in more than 9 months and had not had sex with a partner who had traveled to such areas. Given the very high level of viremia in Patient 1, infectious levels of virus may have been present in sweat or tears, both of which Patient 2 contacted without gloves. Transmission of the infection through a mosquito bite appears to be unlikely, since _Aedes_ species that are known to transmit ZIKV have not been detected in the Salt Lake City area. In addition, the 2nd case occurred 7 to 10 days after contact with the index patient in the hospital, which implicates direct contact during hospitalization.\n\nThese 2 cases illustrate several important points. The spectrum of those at risk for fulminant ZIKV infection may be broader than previously recognized, and those who are not severely immunocompromised or chronically ill may nevertheless be at risk for fatal infection. The effect of previous infection with related flaviviruses cannot be assessed and may increase the risk of severe ZIKV infection. The transmission of flaviviruses through intact skin or mucous membranes, although uncommon, has been shown in experimental animal models and in at least one human case. Whether contact with highly infectious body fluids from patients with severe ZIKV infection poses an increased risk of transmission is an important question that requires further research.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n[Zika virus shedding in tears has been demonstrated previously. Given Patient 1's high viremia, it seems entirely possible that this is the route of exposure of patient 2, who attended patient 1 without gloves. Perhaps patient 2 touched his eyes or mouth with virus contaminated hands or had a cut. This report establishes with 1st fatal case of Zika virus infection in the USA. It also is the 1st case of transmission by non-sexual direct contact. - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[5] Zika virus infections in children, USA\nDate: Fri 30 Sep 2016\nSource: MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep. ePub: 30 September 2016.

Characteristics of Children Aged Less Than 18 Years with Zika Virus Disease Acquired Postnatally -- U.S. States, January 2015-July 2016.\n\nGuillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome and other neurologic complications can occur in adults after Zika virus infection. However, there are few published reports describing postnatally acquired Zika virus disease among children. During January 2015-July 2016, a total of 158 cases of confirmed or probable postnatally acquired Zika virus disease among children aged less than 18 years were reported to CDC from U.S. states. The median age was 14 years (range = 1 month-17 years), and 88 (56 percent) were female. 2 (1 percent) patients were hospitalized; none developed Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, and none died. All reported cases were travel-associated. Overall, 129 (82 percent) children had rash, 87 (55 percent) had fever, 45 (29 percent) had conjunctivitis, and 44 (28 percent) had arthralgia. 5 (3 percent) patients were pregnant, all of whom were aged 16-17 years. No children were reported to have meningitis, encephalitis, or Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome. Health care providers should consider a diagnosis of Zika virus disease in children who have an epidemiologic risk factor and clinically compatible illness, and should report cases to their state or local health department.\n\nThe symptoms most frequently reported among children with Zika virus disease are common to many childhood illnesses. Health care providers should consider Zika virus disease in the differential diagnosis for children with the acute onset of fever, rash, arthralgia, or conjunctivitis, who reside in or have a history of travel to an area where active Zika virus transmission is occurring, or who have another epidemiologic risk factor for Zika virus disease. Children with suspected Zika virus disease should have blood and urine specimens collected and tested per current guidelines. Although Zika virus disease appears to be a mild illness in children, health care providers should report suspected cases to their state or local health department to facilitate diagnosis and mitigate the risk for local transmission. Providers should counsel sexually active adolescents who might be exposed to Zika virus regarding the risk for congenital Zika virus infection and prevention of unintended pregnancies. Guidance for health care providers caring for infants and children with possible postnatally acquired Zika virus disease is available online (http://www.cdc.gov/zika/hc-providers/infants-children.html).\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[More details are available in this report that can be accessed at the above URL. - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[6] Diagnostic test\nDate: Mon 26 Sep 2016\nSource: Reuters [edited]\nhttp://www.reuters.com/article/us-vela-diagnostics-fda-idUSKCN11W1BO\n\n\nVela Diagnostics said its test for the Zika virus had received \"emergency use authorization\" from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration [FDA].\n\nThe test, already approved in Europe, is validated for plasma, serum and urine samples, the Singapore-based company said on Monday [26 Sep 2016].\n\nThe FDA issues such emergency use authorization during public health emergencies, to quickly deploy unapproved medical products for as long as they are needed. The regulator last month [August 2016] issued a similar authorization for a Zika diagnostics test from Swiss drugmaker Roche.\n\nZika, which was detected in Brazil, has spread to the Americas and is associated with microcephaly, a birth defect characterized by an unusually small head and potential developmental problems. In adults, it has been linked to Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, a temporary paralysis.\n\nThe disease has since spread to parts of Southeast Asia.

Brazil has been the country hardest hit so far, with more than 1800 reported cases of microcephaly.\n\nWysoka's team cautioned that their work did not provide direct proof that Zika virus infects cranial neural crest cells in live animals or humans. Follow-up research would also be needed to look for any evidence that the virus' effect on these cells would be enough to cause microcephaly, they said.\n\n[Byline: Kate Kelland; editing by Alison

(conf.) The patient is a 34-year-old male tourist, who visited the Maldives from 3-13 Jun 2016 (relevant for cross-reacting antibodies with regard to Zika virus assays). On 16 Jun 2016 he developed retro-orbital pain and on 17 Jun 2016 a diffuse maculopapular rash that spared his face and hands, and joint pains in the wrists, ankles, proximal interphalangeal joints. He presented initially on 22 Jun 2016 (day 6 after symptom onset) at the outpatient department of the Division of Infectious Diseases and Tropical Medicine at LMU. Upon presentation the only remaining symptom was arthralgia. No symptoms were present after 8 days.\n\nThe diagnosis of a ZIKV infection was established by ZIKV IgG and IgM through an IFAT assay. ZIKV was also confirmed directly using a commercially available real-time reverse transcriptase assay RealStar Zika RT PCR Kit (Altona, Hamburg, Germany) in whole blood and urine samples on day 6. Urine samples did not turn positive again, whereas whole blood remained positive until 26 Jul 2016 (day 40 after symptom onset). The symptoms subsided altogether after about 8 days. Ejaculate, oral swabs and serum did not show any positive result at any time. The viral strain was identified by an in-house PCR assay as the Asian lineage that is also responsible for the ZIKV outbreak in Latin America.\n\nThe Maldives are listed in the recent WHO Zika Situational Report of 22 Sep 2016 as a country with known prior ZIKV transmission (country category 3: transmission in 2015 and before) but with no reported transmission in 2016. However, this case is evidence of ongoing ZIKV transmission. The Maldives are widely considered as \"safe\" for honeymoon couples and those wishing to become pregnant (babymoon), for whom currently many destinations in the tropical regions of the world are off limits due to ongoing Zika transmission. However, the Maldives should now also be considered as a destination of ongoing transmission.\n\nReport submitted by Guenter Froeschl, Kristina Huber, Frank von Sonnenburg, and Silke Woelfel Munich GeoSentinel Site and Patricia Schlagenhauf, Chair - GeoSentinel Tracking & Communications Working Group via Davidson H.

South-east Asian Zika virus strain linked to cluster of cases in Singapore, August 2016.\n\nSummary\nZika virus (ZIKV) is an ongoing global public health emergency with 70 countries and territories reporting evidence of ZIKV transmission since 2015. On 27 Aug 2016, Singapore reported its 1st case of local ZIKV transmission and identified an ongoing cluster. Here, we report the genome sequences of ZIKV strains from 2 cases and find through phylogenetic analysis that these strains form an earlier branch distinct from the recent large outbreak in the Americas.\n\nConclusions from sequence and structure analysis\nAt least within the Asian lineage the antigenic protein E surface is highly conserved and homogeneous with, from 2007 onwards, typical identities from 99.4 percent to 100 percent (or 3 to zero mutations) relative to the consensus of recent strains from Brazil. Moreover all of the E proteins in this lineage contain the typical N-glycosylation site (N444 in polyprotein numbering which is N154 in the E protein). The lack of surface mutation drift over the past 50 years (99 percent identity between Malaysia 1966 and consensus of Brazil 2015) also suggests that immune pressure on the E protein has not been a dominant factor in the Asian lineages' virus fitness and evolution so far. While the highly similar surface E proteins of the different strains in the Asian lineage should facilitate global vaccine development it is too early to judge if the strain linked to the Singapore outbreak would show any different disease characteristics from the one in French Polynesia and the Americas. Further studies are necessary and underway in Singapore to collect more data.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n[It is interesting that the Zika virus circulating in Singapore is not the same as that currently circulating in the Americas. One wonders where in Asia it came from, and leads one to speculate that Zika virus is circulating in Asia at low levels and is often undetected or mistaken for dengue cases. - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[3] CDC travel advisory, Asia\nDate: Thu 29 Sep 2016\nSource: CDC [edited]\nhttps://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/zika-virus-southeast-asia\n\n\nZika Virus in Southeast Asia\n----------------------------\nWhat is the current situation?\nTravelers have returned from certain areas of Southeast Asia with Zika virus infection. While our understanding of the complications of Zika virus infection continues to evolve, and pending broader international surveillance efforts for Zika virus infection, we are providing pregnant women and their partners updated recommendations on reducing their risk for travel related Zika virus infection. CDC recommends pregnant women should consider postponing nonessential travel to Southeast Asia countries with reports of Zika virus infection from local transmission or related to travel to those countries, and those countries with adjacent borders where limited information is available to fully evaluate risk of Zika virus infection.\n\nZika virus has been present in areas of Southeast Asia for many years, and several countries have reported occasional cases or small outbreaks of Zika virus infections. Zika virus is considered endemic in some countries, and a large number of local residents are likely to be immune. However, US travelers to endemic areas may not be immune to Zika virus and infections have occurred among travelers to Southeast Asia. Recent variations have been observed in the number of cases reported in Southeast Asia. This can reflect changes in awareness of Zika virus, surveillance and testing for Zika virus, or changes in intensity of Zika virus transmission. Pregnant women traveling to Southeast Asia could become infected with Zika virus. The level of this risk is unknown and likely lower than in areas where Zika virus is newly introduced and spreading widely.\n\nCountries included in this travel message include those listed below. For country-specific information, please visit Health Information for Travelers for individual countries:\nBrunei\nBurma (Myanmar)\nCambodia\nIndonesia\nLaos\nMalaysia\nMaldives\nPhilippines\nThailand\nTimor-Leste (East Timor)\nVietnam\n\nTravel Considerations for Pregnant Women Traveling to Southeast Asia\nZika virus infection during pregnancy causes severe birth defects, including microcephaly and severe fetal brain abnormalities. Therefore, pregnant women should talk with their healthcare provider and consider postponing nonessential travel to Southeast Asia. Zika virus testing should be offered to pregnant women and considered for other people who have symptoms of Zika virus disease if they have recently traveled to Southeast Asia.\n\nWhat can travelers do to prevent Zika?\nThere is no vaccine or medicine for Zika virus infection. Travelers can protect themselves by preventing mosquito bites:\n- Cover exposed skin by wearing long-sleeved shirts and long pants.\n- Use EPA-registered insect repellents containing DEET, picaridin, oil of lemon eucalyptus (OLE, also called para-menthane-diol [PMD]), or IR3535. Always use as directed.\n- Pregnant and breastfeeding women can use all EPA-registered insect repellents, including DEET, according to the product label.\n- Most repellents, including DEET, can be used on children older than 2 months. (OLE should not be used on children younger than 3 years.)\n- Use permethrin-treated clothing and gear (such as boots, pants, socks, and tents). You can buy pre-treated clothing and gear or treat them yourself.\n- Stay in places with air conditioning and window and door screens to keep mosquitoes outside.\n- Sleep under a mosquito bed net if air conditioned or screened rooms are not available or if sleeping outdoors.\n- Mosquito netting can be used to cover babies younger than 2 months old in carriers, strollers, or cribs to protect them from mosquito bites.\n- Zika virus can be passed through sex from a person who has Zika virus to his or her sex partners. The use of condoms during sex (vaginal, anal, and oral) or abstaining from sex while traveling to these areas and after returning from these areas is recommended to avoid getting or passing Zika virus infection.\n\nAfter travel:\nMany people infected with Zika virus do not feel sick. If a mosquito bites an infected person while the virus is still in that person's blood, it can spread the virus by biting another person. Even if they do not feel sick, travelers returning to the United States from countries where Zika virus is endemic should take steps to prevent mosquito bites for 3 weeks so that they do not spread Zika virus to uninfected mosquitoes.\nTravelers returning from countries where Zika virus is endemic and who have a pregnant partner should either use condoms or not have sex for the rest of the pregnancy.\n\nFor more information, see Zika and Sexual Transmission [http://www.cdc.gov/zika/transmission/sexual-transmission.html].\n\nIf you feel sick and think you may have Zika virus:\n- Talk to your doctor if you develop a fever with a rash, joint pain, or red eyes. Tell him or her about your travel.\n- Take acetaminophen (paracetamol) to relieve fever and pain. Do not take aspirin, products containing aspirin, or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as ibuprofen.\n- Get lots of rest and drink plenty of liquids.\n\nIf you are pregnant:\nTalk to a doctor or other healthcare provider after your trip, even if you don't feel sick. Pregnant women who have symptoms and have traveled to these countries should be offered testing for Zika virus infection. Pregnant women who have symptoms and who have had a possible sexual exposure during pregnancy to a partner who traveled to these countries should be offered testing for Zika virus infection.\n- If you develop a fever with a rash, joint pain, or red eyes, talk to your doctor immediately and tell him or her about your travel or possible sexual exposure.\n\nClinician Information\nZika virus during pregnancy causes severe birth defects, including microcephaly and severe fetal brain abnormalities. All pregnant women should be evaluated for possible Zika virus exposure and signs or symptoms consistent with Zika virus disease at each prenatal care visit.\n\nPossible exposures include\n- Travel to an area where there is epidemic or endemic Zika virus transmission\n- Sex with a partner who has traveled to or lived in an area with epidemic or endemic Zika virus transmission\n\nThe recommendations for testing vary according to whether exposure occurred in an area where Zika virus has been newly introduced and is spreading widely or in an area with endemic Zika virus transmission. Dengue and Japanese encephalitis viruses circulate widely in Southeast Asia and might cause false positive results in blood tests. Because of this and related testing factors, routine serologic testing of asymptomatic pregnant women who have traveled to areas of Southeast Asia without epidemic Zika virus transmission is not recommended.

Hanson, M.D., M.H.S., Marc R. Couturier, Ph.D.. Fatal Zika Virus Infection with Secondary Nonsexual Transmission.\n\nEpidemic transmission of Zika virus (ZIKV) has rapidly occurred in the Americas, with most cases limited to mild or asymptomatic disease. To date, 9 deaths from ZIKV infection that were unrelated to the Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome have been confirmed in adults. Here, we report a rapidly progressive, fatal ZIKV infection acquired outside the United States and secondary local transmission in the absence of known risk factors for ZIKV infection.\n\nPatient 1, a 73-year-old man who had emigrated to the United States from Mexico in 2003, was admitted to a hospital in Salt Lake City [Utah] with hypotension and abdominal pain. Radiation therapy for stage IIB prostate cancer had been completed 1 month earlier, and he was receiving antiandrogen therapy but was otherwise not systemically immunocompromised. 8 days before admission, he had returned from a 3-week trip to the southwest coast of Mexico, where ZIKV transmission had been reported. He was well during his trip but reported being bitten by mosquitoes. After returning home, he reported having abdominal pain, pharyngitis, and fever, which was followed by conjunctivitis, nonbloody diarrhea, and myalgias.\n\nOn the day of admission, hypotension and dyspnea had developed. The patient was alert and oriented with no fever but with tachypnea and tachycardia. He remained hypotensive after the administration of intravenous fluids, and vasopressors and broad-spectrum antibiotics were initiated. The physical examination was remarkable for marked erythematous conjunctivitis with profuse tearing and soft-palate petechiae, tachypnea, and moderate, diffuse abdominal pain with mild guarding. A tourniquet test (which is often performed in patients in whom dengue is suspected) was negative.\n\nLaboratory testing revealed metabolic acidosis, an elevated venous lactate level, renal insufficiency, mild hypoglycemia, elevated aminotransferase levels, leukocytosis with 44 percent band forms, anemia, and marked thrombocytopenia. (Details are provided in the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this letter at NEJM.org.) Testing for malaria and blood cultures were negative. A presumptive diagnosis of dengue shock syndrome was made. The patient's clinical deterioration progressed, with progressive respiratory and renal failure, metabolic acidosis, and hepatitis. On day 4 of hospitalization, the patient died shortly after care was withdrawn.\n\nTesting was negative for dengue virus (DENV) on polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) assay. Serologic analysis for DENV was consistent with remote infection, with a highly elevated IgG level and an equivocal IgM level. Serum testing for ZIKV on real-time PCR assay was positive, with a threshold cycle of 17 and a very high estimated viral load of 2.0 x 10^8 ZIKV genome copies per milliliter. High-throughput sequencing of RNA revealed the presence of a ZIKV strain that shared 99.8 percent of the genome sequence with a strain isolated from a mosquito in Chiapas, Mexico, in 2016. No other putative pathogen was detected by routine diagnostic testing and RNA sequencing.\n\n5 days after Patient 1 died, Patient 2, a previously healthy 38-year-old man with no known coexisting illnesses who had visited Patient 1 in the hospital, reported having conjunctivitis, fevers, myalgia, and facial maculopapular rash. The rash became generalized but resolved within 7 days. On day 7 after the onset of symptoms, urinalysis was positive for ZIKV but serum was negative on PCR assay. Serum IgM antibody to ZIKV was positive. Patient 2 reported having assisted a nurse in repositioning Patient 1 in bed without using gloves. Patient 2 also reported having wiped Patient 1's eyes during the hospitalization but reported having had no other overt contact with blood or other body fluids, including splashes or mucous membrane exposure. No health care workers who had contact with Patient 1 reported having symptomatic illness.\n\nIt is likely that Patient 2 acquired the infection from Patient 1, since Patient 2 had not traveled to an area in which ZIKV is endemic in more than 9 months and had not had sex with a partner who had traveled to such areas. Given the very high level of viremia in Patient 1, infectious levels of virus may have been present in sweat or tears, both of which Patient 2 contacted without gloves. Transmission of the infection through a mosquito bite appears to be unlikely, since _Aedes_ species that are known to transmit ZIKV have not been detected in the Salt Lake City area. In addition, the 2nd case occurred 7 to 10 days after contact with the index patient in the hospital, which implicates direct contact during hospitalization.\n\nThese 2 cases illustrate several important points. The spectrum of those at risk for fulminant ZIKV infection may be broader than previously recognized, and those who are not severely immunocompromised or chronically ill may nevertheless be at risk for fatal infection. The effect of previous infection with related flaviviruses cannot be assessed and may increase the risk of severe ZIKV infection. The transmission of flaviviruses through intact skin or mucous membranes, although uncommon, has been shown in experimental animal models and in at least one human case. Whether contact with highly infectious body fluids from patients with severe ZIKV infection poses an increased risk of transmission is an important question that requires further research.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n[Zika virus shedding in tears has been demonstrated previously. Given Patient 1's high viremia, it seems entirely possible that this is the route of exposure of patient 2, who attended patient 1 without gloves. Perhaps patient 2 touched his eyes or mouth with virus contaminated hands or had a cut. This report establishes with 1st fatal case of Zika virus infection in the USA. It also is the 1st case of transmission by non-sexual direct contact. - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[5] Zika virus infections in children, USA\nDate: Fri 30 Sep 2016\nSource: MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep. ePub: 30 September 2016.

Characteristics of Children Aged Less Than 18 Years with Zika Virus Disease Acquired Postnatally -- U.S. States, January 2015-July 2016.\n\nGuillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome and other neurologic complications can occur in adults after Zika virus infection. However, there are few published reports describing postnatally acquired Zika virus disease among children. During January 2015-July 2016, a total of 158 cases of confirmed or probable postnatally acquired Zika virus disease among children aged less than 18 years were reported to CDC from U.S. states. The median age was 14 years (range = 1 month-17 years), and 88 (56 percent) were female. 2 (1 percent) patients were hospitalized; none developed Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, and none died. All reported cases were travel-associated. Overall, 129 (82 percent) children had rash, 87 (55 percent) had fever, 45 (29 percent) had conjunctivitis, and 44 (28 percent) had arthralgia. 5 (3 percent) patients were pregnant, all of whom were aged 16-17 years. No children were reported to have meningitis, encephalitis, or Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome. Health care providers should consider a diagnosis of Zika virus disease in children who have an epidemiologic risk factor and clinically compatible illness, and should report cases to their state or local health department.\n\nThe symptoms most frequently reported among children with Zika virus disease are common to many childhood illnesses. Health care providers should consider Zika virus disease in the differential diagnosis for children with the acute onset of fever, rash, arthralgia, or conjunctivitis, who reside in or have a history of travel to an area where active Zika virus transmission is occurring, or who have another epidemiologic risk factor for Zika virus disease. Children with suspected Zika virus disease should have blood and urine specimens collected and tested per current guidelines. Although Zika virus disease appears to be a mild illness in children, health care providers should report suspected cases to their state or local health department to facilitate diagnosis and mitigate the risk for local transmission. Providers should counsel sexually active adolescents who might be exposed to Zika virus regarding the risk for congenital Zika virus infection and prevention of unintended pregnancies. Guidance for health care providers caring for infants and children with possible postnatally acquired Zika virus disease is available online (http://www.cdc.gov/zika/hc-providers/infants-children.html).\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[More details are available in this report that can be accessed at the above URL. - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[6] Diagnostic test\nDate: Mon 26 Sep 2016\nSource: Reuters [edited]\nhttp://www.reuters.com/article/us-vela-diagnostics-fda-idUSKCN11W1BO\n\n\nVela Diagnostics said its test for the Zika virus had received \"emergency use authorization\" from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration [FDA].\n\nThe test, already approved in Europe, is validated for plasma, serum and urine samples, the Singapore-based company said on Monday [26 Sep 2016].\n\nThe FDA issues such emergency use authorization during public health emergencies, to quickly deploy unapproved medical products for as long as they are needed. The regulator last month [August 2016] issued a similar authorization for a Zika diagnostics test from Swiss drugmaker Roche.\n\nZika, which was detected in Brazil, has spread to the Americas and is associated with microcephaly, a birth defect characterized by an unusually small head and potential developmental problems. In adults, it has been linked to Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, a temporary paralysis.\n\nThe disease has since spread to parts of Southeast Asia. [The virus was already present in Southeast Asia. - Mod.TY]\n\n[Reporting by Akankshita Mukhopadhyay and Natalie Grover in Bengaluru; editing by Sriraj Kalluvila]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[There is an internal controversy within the CDC about which diagnostic test is best (https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2016/09/27/cdc-whistleblower-claims-agency-has-been-using-wrong-zika-test/). Because Zika, dengue and chikungunya virus infections are clinically similar in many cases, having a rapid and sensitive diagnostic test that can differentiate them is important, especially for pregnant women at risk of teratogenic effects of their fetuses. - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[7] Fetal skull formation\nDate: Thu 29 Sep 2016\nSource: Reuters [edited]\nhttp://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-zika-skull-idUSKCN11Z2CN\n\n\nThe Zika virus causing an epidemic in Brazil and spreading through the Americas can infect and alter cells in the human nervous system that are crucial for formation of bones and cartilage in the skull, a study found on Thursday [29 Sep 2016].\n\nThe research, published in the journal Cell Host & Microbe, may help explain why children born to mothers who have had the virus can have smaller-than-average skulls and disproportionate facial features.\n\nZika has already been shown to attack foetal brain cells known as neural progenitor cells -- a type of stem cell that gives rise to various kinds of brain cells.\n\nThe death of these cells is what disrupts brain development and leads to microcephaly, the severe birth defect seen in babies whose mothers were infected with Zika during pregnancy.\n\nAmerican scientists who conducted this latest study by infecting human cells with Zika in the lab, found the virus can infect another type of cell known as cranial neural crest cells -- which give rise to skull bones and cartilage -- and cause them to secrete signaling molecules that alter their function.\n\nIn the lab, the increased levels of these molecules were enough to induce premature differentiation, migration, and death of human neural progenitor cells, the researchers said.\n\n\"In addition to direct effects of Zika virus on neural progenitors and their derivatives, this virus could affect brain development indirectly, through a signaling cross-talk between embryonic cell types,\" says Joanna Wysocka, a chemical and systems biologist at the Stanford University School of Medicine who co-led the study.\n\nShe added that neural crest cells may be just one example, and that the same mechanism may also be relevant to other tissues that come in contact with a foetus' developing brain during head formation and could be infected by Zika.\n\nThe Zika virus has spread to almost 60 countries and territories since the current outbreak was identified last year in Brazil, raising alarm over its ability to cause microcephaly as well as other neurological disorders in infants and adults. Brazil has been the country hardest hit so far, with more than 1800 reported cases of microcephaly.\n\nWysoka's team cautioned that their work did not provide direct proof that Zika virus infects cranial neural crest cells in live animals or humans. Follow-up research would also be needed to look for any evidence that the virus' effect on these cells would be enough to cause microcephaly, they said.\n\n[Byline: Kate Kelland; editing by Alison Williams)\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n[This research adds anther piece to the puzzle of underlying mechanisms of teratogenic effects of Zika virus infections. -

(conf.) The patient is a 34-year-old male tourist, who visited the Maldives from 3-13 Jun 2016 (relevant for cross-reacting antibodies with regard to Zika virus assays). On 16 Jun 2016 he developed retro-orbital pain and on 17 Jun 2016 a diffuse maculopapular rash that spared his face and hands, and joint pains in the wrists, ankles, proximal interphalangeal joints. He presented initially on 22 Jun 2016 (day 6 after symptom onset) at the outpatient department of the Division of Infectious Diseases and Tropical Medicine at LMU. Upon presentation the only remaining symptom was arthralgia. No symptoms were present after 8 days.\n\nThe diagnosis of a ZIKV infection was established by ZIKV IgG and IgM through an IFAT assay. ZIKV was also confirmed directly using a commercially available real-time reverse transcriptase assay RealStar Zika RT PCR Kit (Altona, Hamburg, Germany) in whole blood and urine samples on day 6. Urine samples did not turn positive again, whereas whole blood remained positive until 26 Jul 2016 (day 40 after symptom onset). The symptoms subsided altogether after about 8 days. Ejaculate, oral swabs and serum did not show any positive result at any time. The viral strain was identified by an in-house PCR assay as the Asian lineage that is also responsible for the ZIKV outbreak in Latin America.\n\nThe Maldives are listed in the recent WHO Zika Situational Report of 22 Sep 2016 as a country with known prior ZIKV transmission (country category 3: transmission in 2015 and before) but with no reported transmission in 2016. However, this case is evidence of ongoing ZIKV transmission. The Maldives are widely considered as \"safe\" for honeymoon couples and those wishing to become pregnant (babymoon), for whom currently many destinations in the tropical regions of the world are off limits due to ongoing Zika transmission. However, the Maldives should now also be considered as a destination of ongoing transmission.\n\nReport submitted by Guenter Froeschl, Kristina Huber, Frank von Sonnenburg, and Silke Woelfel Munich GeoSentinel Site and Patricia Schlagenhauf, Chair - GeoSentinel Tracking & Communications Working Group via Davidson H.

South-east Asian Zika virus strain linked to cluster of cases in Singapore, August 2016.\n\nSummary\nZika virus (ZIKV) is an ongoing global public health emergency with 70 countries and territories reporting evidence of ZIKV transmission since 2015. On 27 Aug 2016, Singapore reported its 1st case of local ZIKV transmission and identified an ongoing cluster. Here, we report the genome sequences of ZIKV strains from 2 cases and find through phylogenetic analysis that these strains form an earlier branch distinct from the recent large outbreak in the Americas.\n\nConclusions from sequence and structure analysis\nAt least within the Asian lineage the antigenic protein E surface is highly conserved and homogeneous with, from 2007 onwards, typical identities from 99.4 percent to 100 percent (or 3 to zero mutations) relative to the consensus of recent strains from Brazil. Moreover all of the E proteins in this lineage contain the typical N-glycosylation site (N444 in polyprotein numbering which is N154 in the E protein). The lack of surface mutation drift over the past 50 years (99 percent identity between Malaysia 1966 and consensus of Brazil 2015) also suggests that immune pressure on the E protein has not been a dominant factor in the Asian lineages' virus fitness and evolution so far. While the highly similar surface E proteins of the different strains in the Asian lineage should facilitate global vaccine development it is too early to judge if the strain linked to the Singapore outbreak would show any different disease characteristics from the one in French Polynesia and the Americas. Further studies are necessary and underway in Singapore to collect more data.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n[It is interesting that the Zika virus circulating in Singapore is not the same as that currently circulating in the Americas. One wonders where in Asia it came from, and leads one to speculate that Zika virus is circulating in Asia at low levels and is often undetected or mistaken for dengue cases. - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[3] CDC travel advisory, Asia\nDate: Thu 29 Sep 2016\nSource: CDC [edited]\nhttps://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/zika-virus-southeast-asia\n\n\nZika Virus in Southeast Asia\n----------------------------\nWhat is the current situation?\nTravelers have returned from certain areas of Southeast Asia with Zika virus infection. While our understanding of the complications of Zika virus infection continues to evolve, and pending broader international surveillance efforts for Zika virus infection, we are providing pregnant women and their partners updated recommendations on reducing their risk for travel related Zika virus infection. CDC recommends pregnant women should consider postponing nonessential travel to Southeast Asia countries with reports of Zika virus infection from local transmission or related to travel to those countries, and those countries with adjacent borders where limited information is available to fully evaluate risk of Zika virus infection.\n\nZika virus has been present in areas of Southeast Asia for many years, and several countries have reported occasional cases or small outbreaks of Zika virus infections. Zika virus is considered endemic in some countries, and a large number of local residents are likely to be immune. However, US travelers to endemic areas may not be immune to Zika virus and infections have occurred among travelers to Southeast Asia. Recent variations have been observed in the number of cases reported in Southeast Asia. This can reflect changes in awareness of Zika virus, surveillance and testing for Zika virus, or changes in intensity of Zika virus transmission. Pregnant women traveling to Southeast Asia could become infected with Zika virus. The level of this risk is unknown and likely lower than in areas where Zika virus is newly introduced and spreading widely.\n\nCountries included in this travel message include those listed below. For country-specific information, please visit Health Information for Travelers for individual countries:\nBrunei\nBurma (Myanmar)\nCambodia\nIndonesia\nLaos\nMalaysia\nMaldives\nPhilippines\nThailand\nTimor-Leste (East Timor)\nVietnam\n\nTravel Considerations for Pregnant Women Traveling to Southeast Asia\nZika virus infection during pregnancy causes severe birth defects, including microcephaly and severe fetal brain abnormalities. Therefore, pregnant women should talk with their healthcare provider and consider postponing nonessential travel to Southeast Asia. Zika virus testing should be offered to pregnant women and considered for other people who have symptoms of Zika virus disease if they have recently traveled to Southeast Asia.\n\nWhat can travelers do to prevent Zika?\nThere is no vaccine or medicine for Zika virus infection. Travelers can protect themselves by preventing mosquito bites:\n- Cover exposed skin by wearing long-sleeved shirts and long pants.\n- Use EPA-registered insect repellents containing DEET, picaridin, oil of lemon eucalyptus (OLE, also called para-menthane-diol [PMD]), or IR3535. Always use as directed.\n- Pregnant and breastfeeding women can use all EPA-registered insect repellents, including DEET, according to the product label.\n- Most repellents, including DEET, can be used on children older than 2 months. (OLE should not be used on children younger than 3 years.)\n- Use permethrin-treated clothing and gear (such as boots, pants, socks, and tents). You can buy pre-treated clothing and gear or treat them yourself.\n- Stay in places with air conditioning and window and door screens to keep mosquitoes outside.\n- Sleep under a mosquito bed net if air conditioned or screened rooms are not available or if sleeping outdoors.\n- Mosquito netting can be used to cover babies younger than 2 months old in carriers, strollers, or cribs to protect them from mosquito bites.\n- Zika virus can be passed through sex from a person who has Zika virus to his or her sex partners. The use of condoms during sex (vaginal, anal, and oral) or abstaining from sex while traveling to these areas and after returning from these areas is recommended to avoid getting or passing Zika virus infection.\n\nAfter travel:\nMany people infected with Zika virus do not feel sick. If a mosquito bites an infected person while the virus is still in that person's blood, it can spread the virus by biting another person. Even if they do not feel sick, travelers returning to the United States from countries where Zika virus is endemic should take steps to prevent mosquito bites for 3 weeks so that they do not spread Zika virus to uninfected mosquitoes.\nTravelers returning from countries where Zika virus is endemic and who have a pregnant partner should either use condoms or not have sex for the rest of the pregnancy.\n\nFor more information, see Zika and Sexual Transmission [http://www.cdc.gov/zika/transmission/sexual-transmission.html].\n\nIf you feel sick and think you may have Zika virus:\n- Talk to your doctor if you develop a fever with a rash, joint pain, or red eyes. Tell him or her about your travel.\n- Take acetaminophen (paracetamol) to relieve fever and pain. Do not take aspirin, products containing aspirin, or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as ibuprofen.\n- Get lots of rest and drink plenty of liquids.\n\nIf you are pregnant:\nTalk to a doctor or other healthcare provider after your trip, even if you don't feel sick. Pregnant women who have symptoms and have traveled to these countries should be offered testing for Zika virus infection. Pregnant women who have symptoms and who have had a possible sexual exposure during pregnancy to a partner who traveled to these countries should be offered testing for Zika virus infection.\n- If you develop a fever with a rash, joint pain, or red eyes, talk to your doctor immediately and tell him or her about your travel or possible sexual exposure.\n\nClinician Information\nZika virus during pregnancy causes severe birth defects, including microcephaly and severe fetal brain abnormalities. All pregnant women should be evaluated for possible Zika virus exposure and signs or symptoms consistent with Zika virus disease at each prenatal care visit.\n\nPossible exposures include\n- Travel to an area where there is epidemic or endemic Zika virus transmission\n- Sex with a partner who has traveled to or lived in an area with epidemic or endemic Zika virus transmission\n\nThe recommendations for testing vary according to whether exposure occurred in an area where Zika virus has been newly introduced and is spreading widely or in an area with endemic Zika virus transmission. Dengue and Japanese encephalitis viruses circulate widely in Southeast Asia and might cause false positive results in blood tests. Because of this and related testing factors, routine serologic testing of asymptomatic pregnant women who have traveled to areas of Southeast Asia without epidemic Zika virus transmission is not recommended. For more information, please visit the Clinical Guidance for Healthcare Providers Caring for Pregnant Women webpage [http://www.cdc.gov/zika/hc-providers/pregnant-woman.html].\n\nClinical Guidance for Healthcare Providers Caring for Infants & Children is also available [http://www.cdc.gov/zika/hc-providers/infants-children.html].\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n[This advisory is applicable to travelers of any nationality going to the countries listed above.

Hanson, M.D., M.H.S., Marc R. Couturier, Ph.D.. Fatal Zika Virus Infection with Secondary Nonsexual Transmission.\n\nEpidemic transmission of Zika virus (ZIKV) has rapidly occurred in the Americas, with most cases limited to mild or asymptomatic disease. To date, 9 deaths from ZIKV infection that were unrelated to the Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome have been confirmed in adults. Here, we report a rapidly progressive, fatal ZIKV infection acquired outside the United States and secondary local transmission in the absence of known risk factors for ZIKV infection.\n\nPatient 1, a 73-year-old man who had emigrated to the United States from Mexico in 2003, was admitted to a hospital in Salt Lake City [Utah] with hypotension and abdominal pain. Radiation therapy for stage IIB prostate cancer had been completed 1 month earlier, and he was receiving antiandrogen therapy but was otherwise not systemically immunocompromised. 8 days before admission, he had returned from a 3-week trip to the southwest coast of Mexico, where ZIKV transmission had been reported. He was well during his trip but reported being bitten by mosquitoes. After returning home, he reported having abdominal pain, pharyngitis, and fever, which was followed by conjunctivitis, nonbloody diarrhea, and myalgias.\n\nOn the day of admission, hypotension and dyspnea had developed. The patient was alert and oriented with no fever but with tachypnea and tachycardia. He remained hypotensive after the administration of intravenous fluids, and vasopressors and broad-spectrum antibiotics were initiated. The physical examination was remarkable for marked erythematous conjunctivitis with profuse tearing and soft-palate petechiae, tachypnea, and moderate, diffuse abdominal pain with mild guarding. A tourniquet test (which is often performed in patients in whom dengue is suspected) was negative.\n\nLaboratory testing revealed metabolic acidosis, an elevated venous lactate level, renal insufficiency, mild hypoglycemia, elevated aminotransferase levels, leukocytosis with 44 percent band forms, anemia, and marked thrombocytopenia. (Details are provided in the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this letter at NEJM.org.) Testing for malaria and blood cultures were negative. A presumptive diagnosis of dengue shock syndrome was made. The patient's clinical deterioration progressed, with progressive respiratory and renal failure, metabolic acidosis, and hepatitis. On day 4 of hospitalization, the patient died shortly after care was withdrawn.\n\nTesting was negative for dengue virus (DENV) on polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) assay. Serologic analysis for DENV was consistent with remote infection, with a highly elevated IgG level and an equivocal IgM level. Serum testing for ZIKV on real-time PCR assay was positive, with a threshold cycle of 17 and a very high estimated viral load of 2.0 x 10^8 ZIKV genome copies per milliliter. High-throughput sequencing of RNA revealed the presence of a ZIKV strain that shared 99.8 percent of the genome sequence with a strain isolated from a mosquito in Chiapas, Mexico, in 2016. No other putative pathogen was detected by routine diagnostic testing and RNA sequencing.\n\n5 days after Patient 1 died, Patient 2, a previously healthy 38-year-old man with no known coexisting illnesses who had visited Patient 1 in the hospital, reported having conjunctivitis, fevers, myalgia, and facial maculopapular rash. The rash became generalized but resolved within 7 days. On day 7 after the onset of symptoms, urinalysis was positive for ZIKV but serum was negative on PCR assay. Serum IgM antibody to ZIKV was positive. Patient 2 reported having assisted a nurse in repositioning Patient 1 in bed without using gloves. Patient 2 also reported having wiped Patient 1's eyes during the hospitalization but reported having had no other overt contact with blood or other body fluids, including splashes or mucous membrane exposure. No health care workers who had contact with Patient 1 reported having symptomatic illness.\n\nIt is likely that Patient 2 acquired the infection from Patient 1, since Patient 2 had not traveled to an area in which ZIKV is endemic in more than 9 months and had not had sex with a partner who had traveled to such areas. Given the very high level of viremia in Patient 1, infectious levels of virus may have been present in sweat or tears, both of which Patient 2 contacted without gloves. Transmission of the infection through a mosquito bite appears to be unlikely, since _Aedes_ species that are known to transmit ZIKV have not been detected in the Salt Lake City area. In addition, the 2nd case occurred 7 to 10 days after contact with the index patient in the hospital, which implicates direct contact during hospitalization.\n\nThese 2 cases illustrate several important points. The spectrum of those at risk for fulminant ZIKV infection may be broader than previously recognized, and those who are not severely immunocompromised or chronically ill may nevertheless be at risk for fatal infection. The effect of previous infection with related flaviviruses cannot be assessed and may increase the risk of severe ZIKV infection. The transmission of flaviviruses through intact skin or mucous membranes, although uncommon, has been shown in experimental animal models and in at least one human case. Whether contact with highly infectious body fluids from patients with severe ZIKV infection poses an increased risk of transmission is an important question that requires further research.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n[Zika virus shedding in tears has been demonstrated previously. Given Patient 1's high viremia, it seems entirely possible that this is the route of exposure of patient 2, who attended patient 1 without gloves. Perhaps patient 2 touched his eyes or mouth with virus contaminated hands or had a cut. This report establishes with 1st fatal case of Zika virus infection in the USA. It also is the 1st case of transmission by non-sexual direct contact. - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[5] Zika virus infections in children, USA\nDate: Fri 30 Sep 2016\nSource: MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep. ePub: 30 September 2016.

Characteristics of Children Aged Less Than 18 Years with Zika Virus Disease Acquired Postnatally -- U.S. States, January 2015-July 2016.\n\nGuillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome and other neurologic complications can occur in adults after Zika virus infection. However, there are few published reports describing postnatally acquired Zika virus disease among children. During January 2015-July 2016, a total of 158 cases of confirmed or probable postnatally acquired Zika virus disease among children aged less than 18 years were reported to CDC from U.S. states. The median age was 14 years (range = 1 month-17 years), and 88 (56 percent) were female. 2 (1 percent) patients were hospitalized; none developed Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, and none died. All reported cases were travel-associated. Overall, 129 (82 percent) children had rash, 87 (55 percent) had fever, 45 (29 percent) had conjunctivitis, and 44 (28 percent) had arthralgia. 5 (3 percent) patients were pregnant, all of whom were aged 16-17 years. No children were reported to have meningitis, encephalitis, or Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome. Health care providers should consider a diagnosis of Zika virus disease in children who have an epidemiologic risk factor and clinically compatible illness, and should report cases to their state or local health department.\n\nThe symptoms most frequently reported among children with Zika virus disease are common to many childhood illnesses. Health care providers should consider Zika virus disease in the differential diagnosis for children with the acute onset of fever, rash, arthralgia, or conjunctivitis, who reside in or have a history of travel to an area where active Zika virus transmission is occurring, or who have another epidemiologic risk factor for Zika virus disease. Children with suspected Zika virus disease should have blood and urine specimens collected and tested per current guidelines. Although Zika virus disease appears to be a mild illness in children, health care providers should report suspected cases to their state or local health department to facilitate diagnosis and mitigate the risk for local transmission. Providers should counsel sexually active adolescents who might be exposed to Zika virus regarding the risk for congenital Zika virus infection and prevention of unintended pregnancies. Guidance for health care providers caring for infants and children with possible postnatally acquired Zika virus disease is available online (http://www.cdc.gov/zika/hc-providers/infants-children.html).\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[More details are available in this report that can be accessed at the above URL. - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[6] Diagnostic test\nDate: Mon 26 Sep 2016\nSource: Reuters [edited]\nhttp://www.reuters.com/article/us-vela-diagnostics-fda-idUSKCN11W1BO\n\n\nVela Diagnostics said its test for the Zika virus had received \"emergency use authorization\" from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration [FDA].\n\nThe test, already approved in Europe, is validated for plasma, serum and urine samples, the Singapore-based company said on Monday [26 Sep 2016].\n\nThe FDA issues such emergency use authorization during public health emergencies, to quickly deploy unapproved medical products for as long as they are needed. The regulator last month [August 2016] issued a similar authorization for a Zika diagnostics test from Swiss drugmaker Roche.\n\nZika, which was detected in Brazil, has spread to the Americas and is associated with microcephaly, a birth defect characterized by an unusually small head and potential developmental problems. In adults, it has been linked to Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, a temporary paralysis.\n\nThe disease has since spread to parts of Southeast Asia.

Brazil has been the country hardest hit so far, with more than 1800 reported cases of microcephaly.\n\nWysoka's team cautioned that their work did not provide direct proof that Zika virus infects cranial neural crest cells in live animals or humans. Follow-up research would also be needed to look for any evidence that the virus' effect on these cells would be enough to cause microcephaly, they said.\n\n[Byline: Kate Kelland; editing by Alison

(conf.) The patient is a 34-year-old male tourist, who visited the Maldives from 3-13 Jun 2016 (relevant for cross-reacting antibodies with regard to Zika virus assays). On 16 Jun 2016 he developed retro-orbital pain and on 17 Jun 2016 a diffuse maculopapular rash that spared his face and hands, and joint pains in the wrists, ankles, proximal interphalangeal joints. He presented initially on 22 Jun 2016 (day 6 after symptom onset) at the outpatient department of the Division of Infectious Diseases and Tropical Medicine at LMU. Upon presentation the only remaining symptom was arthralgia. No symptoms were present after 8 days.\n\nThe diagnosis of a ZIKV infection was established by ZIKV IgG and IgM through an IFAT assay. ZIKV was also confirmed directly using a commercially available real-time reverse transcriptase assay RealStar Zika RT PCR Kit (Altona, Hamburg, Germany) in whole blood and urine samples on day 6. Urine samples did not turn positive again, whereas whole blood remained positive until 26 Jul 2016 (day 40 after symptom onset). The symptoms subsided altogether after about 8 days. Ejaculate, oral swabs and serum did not show any positive result at any time. The viral strain was identified by an in-house PCR assay as the Asian lineage that is also responsible for the ZIKV outbreak in Latin America.\n\nThe Maldives are listed in the recent WHO Zika Situational Report of 22 Sep 2016 as a country with known prior ZIKV transmission (country category 3: transmission in 2015 and before) but with no reported transmission in 2016. However, this case is evidence of ongoing ZIKV transmission. The Maldives are widely considered as \"safe\" for honeymoon couples and those wishing to become pregnant (babymoon), for whom currently many destinations in the tropical regions of the world are off limits due to ongoing Zika transmission. However, the Maldives should now also be considered as a destination of ongoing transmission.\n\nReport submitted by Guenter Froeschl, Kristina Huber, Frank von Sonnenburg, and Silke Woelfel Munich GeoSentinel Site and Patricia Schlagenhauf, Chair - GeoSentinel Tracking & Communications Working Group via Davidson H.

South-east Asian Zika virus strain linked to cluster of cases in Singapore, August 2016.\n\nSummary\nZika virus (ZIKV) is an ongoing global public health emergency with 70 countries and territories reporting evidence of ZIKV transmission since 2015. On 27 Aug 2016, Singapore reported its 1st case of local ZIKV transmission and identified an ongoing cluster. Here, we report the genome sequences of ZIKV strains from 2 cases and find through phylogenetic analysis that these strains form an earlier branch distinct from the recent large outbreak in the Americas.\n\nConclusions from sequence and structure analysis\nAt least within the Asian lineage the antigenic protein E surface is highly conserved and homogeneous with, from 2007 onwards, typical identities from 99.4 percent to 100 percent (or 3 to zero mutations) relative to the consensus of recent strains from Brazil. Moreover all of the E proteins in this lineage contain the typical N-glycosylation site (N444 in polyprotein numbering which is N154 in the E protein). The lack of surface mutation drift over the past 50 years (99 percent identity between Malaysia 1966 and consensus of Brazil 2015) also suggests that immune pressure on the E protein has not been a dominant factor in the Asian lineages' virus fitness and evolution so far. While the highly similar surface E proteins of the different strains in the Asian lineage should facilitate global vaccine development it is too early to judge if the strain linked to the Singapore outbreak would show any different disease characteristics from the one in French Polynesia and the Americas. Further studies are necessary and underway in Singapore to collect more data.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n[It is interesting that the Zika virus circulating in Singapore is not the same as that currently circulating in the Americas. One wonders where in Asia it came from, and leads one to speculate that Zika virus is circulating in Asia at low levels and is often undetected or mistaken for dengue cases. - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[3] CDC travel advisory, Asia\nDate: Thu 29 Sep 2016\nSource: CDC [edited]\nhttps://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/zika-virus-southeast-asia\n\n\nZika Virus in Southeast Asia\n----------------------------\nWhat is the current situation?\nTravelers have returned from certain areas of Southeast Asia with Zika virus infection. While our understanding of the complications of Zika virus infection continues to evolve, and pending broader international surveillance efforts for Zika virus infection, we are providing pregnant women and their partners updated recommendations on reducing their risk for travel related Zika virus infection. CDC recommends pregnant women should consider postponing nonessential travel to Southeast Asia countries with reports of Zika virus infection from local transmission or related to travel to those countries, and those countries with adjacent borders where limited information is available to fully evaluate risk of Zika virus infection.\n\nZika virus has been present in areas of Southeast Asia for many years, and several countries have reported occasional cases or small outbreaks of Zika virus infections. Zika virus is considered endemic in some countries, and a large number of local residents are likely to be immune. However, US travelers to endemic areas may not be immune to Zika virus and infections have occurred among travelers to Southeast Asia. Recent variations have been observed in the number of cases reported in Southeast Asia. This can reflect changes in awareness of Zika virus, surveillance and testing for Zika virus, or changes in intensity of Zika virus transmission. Pregnant women traveling to Southeast Asia could become infected with Zika virus. The level of this risk is unknown and likely lower than in areas where Zika virus is newly introduced and spreading widely.\n\nCountries included in this travel message include those listed below. For country-specific information, please visit Health Information for Travelers for individual countries:\nBrunei\nBurma (Myanmar)\nCambodia\nIndonesia\nLaos\nMalaysia\nMaldives\nPhilippines\nThailand\nTimor-Leste (East Timor)\nVietnam\n\nTravel Considerations for Pregnant Women Traveling to Southeast Asia\nZika virus infection during pregnancy causes severe birth defects, including microcephaly and severe fetal brain abnormalities. Therefore, pregnant women should talk with their healthcare provider and consider postponing nonessential travel to Southeast Asia. Zika virus testing should be offered to pregnant women and considered for other people who have symptoms of Zika virus disease if they have recently traveled to Southeast Asia.\n\nWhat can travelers do to prevent Zika?\nThere is no vaccine or medicine for Zika virus infection. Travelers can protect themselves by preventing mosquito bites:\n- Cover exposed skin by wearing long-sleeved shirts and long pants.\n- Use EPA-registered insect repellents containing DEET, picaridin, oil of lemon eucalyptus (OLE, also called para-menthane-diol [PMD]), or IR3535. Always use as directed.\n- Pregnant and breastfeeding women can use all EPA-registered insect repellents, including DEET, according to the product label.\n- Most repellents, including DEET, can be used on children older than 2 months. (OLE should not be used on children younger than 3 years.)\n- Use permethrin-treated clothing and gear (such as boots, pants, socks, and tents). You can buy pre-treated clothing and gear or treat them yourself.\n- Stay in places with air conditioning and window and door screens to keep mosquitoes outside.\n- Sleep under a mosquito bed net if air conditioned or screened rooms are not available or if sleeping outdoors.\n- Mosquito netting can be used to cover babies younger than 2 months old in carriers, strollers, or cribs to protect them from mosquito bites.\n- Zika virus can be passed through sex from a person who has Zika virus to his or her sex partners. The use of condoms during sex (vaginal, anal, and oral) or abstaining from sex while traveling to these areas and after returning from these areas is recommended to avoid getting or passing Zika virus infection.\n\nAfter travel:\nMany people infected with Zika virus do not feel sick. If a mosquito bites an infected person while the virus is still in that person's blood, it can spread the virus by biting another person. Even if they do not feel sick, travelers returning to the United States from countries where Zika virus is endemic should take steps to prevent mosquito bites for 3 weeks so that they do not spread Zika virus to uninfected mosquitoes.\nTravelers returning from countries where Zika virus is endemic and who have a pregnant partner should either use condoms or not have sex for the rest of the pregnancy.\n\nFor more information, see Zika and Sexual Transmission [http://www.cdc.gov/zika/transmission/sexual-transmission.html].\n\nIf you feel sick and think you may have Zika virus:\n- Talk to your doctor if you develop a fever with a rash, joint pain, or red eyes. Tell him or her about your travel.\n- Take acetaminophen (paracetamol) to relieve fever and pain. Do not take aspirin, products containing aspirin, or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as ibuprofen.\n- Get lots of rest and drink plenty of liquids.\n\nIf you are pregnant:\nTalk to a doctor or other healthcare provider after your trip, even if you don't feel sick. Pregnant women who have symptoms and have traveled to these countries should be offered testing for Zika virus infection. Pregnant women who have symptoms and who have had a possible sexual exposure during pregnancy to a partner who traveled to these countries should be offered testing for Zika virus infection.\n- If you develop a fever with a rash, joint pain, or red eyes, talk to your doctor immediately and tell him or her about your travel or possible sexual exposure.\n\nClinician Information\nZika virus during pregnancy causes severe birth defects, including microcephaly and severe fetal brain abnormalities. All pregnant women should be evaluated for possible Zika virus exposure and signs or symptoms consistent with Zika virus disease at each prenatal care visit.\n\nPossible exposures include\n- Travel to an area where there is epidemic or endemic Zika virus transmission\n- Sex with a partner who has traveled to or lived in an area with epidemic or endemic Zika virus transmission\n\nThe recommendations for testing vary according to whether exposure occurred in an area where Zika virus has been newly introduced and is spreading widely or in an area with endemic Zika virus transmission. Dengue and Japanese encephalitis viruses circulate widely in Southeast Asia and might cause false positive results in blood tests. Because of this and related testing factors, routine serologic testing of asymptomatic pregnant women who have traveled to areas of Southeast Asia without epidemic Zika virus transmission is not recommended. For more information, please visit the Clinical Guidance for Healthcare Providers Caring for Pregnant Women webpage [http://www.cdc.gov/zika/hc-providers/pregnant-woman.html].\n\nClinical Guidance for Healthcare Providers Caring for Infants & Children is also available [http://www.cdc.gov/zika/hc-providers/infants-children.html].\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n[This advisory is applicable to travelers of any nationality going to the countries listed above.

Recommendations for women planning to conceive remain unchanged: women with possible Zika virus exposure are recommended to wait to conceive until at least 8 weeks after symptom onset (if symptomatic) or last possible Zika virus exposure (if asymptomatic). Couples with possible Zika virus exposure, who are not pregnant and do not plan to become pregnant, who want to minimize their risk for sexual transmission of Zika virus should use a condom or abstain from sex for the same periods for men and women described above.

Hanson, M.D., M.H.S., Marc R. Couturier, Ph.D.. Fatal Zika Virus Infection with Secondary Nonsexual Transmission.\n\nEpidemic transmission of Zika virus (ZIKV) has rapidly occurred in the Americas, with most cases limited to mild or asymptomatic disease. To date, 9 deaths from ZIKV infection that were unrelated to the Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome have been confirmed in adults. Here, we report a rapidly progressive, fatal ZIKV infection acquired outside the United States and secondary local transmission in the absence of known risk factors for ZIKV infection.\n\nPatient 1, a 73-year-old man who had emigrated to the United States from Mexico in 2003, was admitted to a hospital in Salt Lake City [Utah] with hypotension and abdominal pain. Radiation therapy for stage IIB prostate cancer had been completed 1 month earlier, and he was receiving antiandrogen therapy but was otherwise not systemically immunocompromised. 8 days before admission, he had returned from a 3-week trip to the southwest coast of Mexico, where ZIKV transmission had been reported. He was well during his trip but reported being bitten by mosquitoes. After returning home, he reported having abdominal pain, pharyngitis, and fever, which was followed by conjunctivitis, nonbloody diarrhea, and myalgias.\n\nOn the day of admission, hypotension and dyspnea had developed. The patient was alert and oriented with no fever but with tachypnea and tachycardia. He remained hypotensive after the administration of intravenous fluids, and vasopressors and broad-spectrum antibiotics were initiated. The physical examination was remarkable for marked erythematous conjunctivitis with profuse tearing and soft-palate petechiae, tachypnea, and moderate, diffuse abdominal pain with mild guarding. A tourniquet test (which is often performed in patients in whom dengue is suspected) was negative.\n\nLaboratory testing revealed metabolic acidosis, an elevated venous lactate level, renal insufficiency, mild hypoglycemia, elevated aminotransferase levels, leukocytosis with 44 percent band forms, anemia, and marked thrombocytopenia. (Details are provided in the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this letter at NEJM.org.) Testing for malaria and blood cultures were negative. A presumptive diagnosis of dengue shock syndrome was made. The patient's clinical deterioration progressed, with progressive respiratory and renal failure, metabolic acidosis, and hepatitis. On day 4 of hospitalization, the patient died shortly after care was withdrawn.\n\nTesting was negative for dengue virus (DENV) on polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) assay. Serologic analysis for DENV was consistent with remote infection, with a highly elevated IgG level and an equivocal IgM level. Serum testing for ZIKV on real-time PCR assay was positive, with a threshold cycle of 17 and a very high estimated viral load of 2.0 x 10^8 ZIKV genome copies per milliliter. High-throughput sequencing of RNA revealed the presence of a ZIKV strain that shared 99.8 percent of the genome sequence with a strain isolated from a mosquito in Chiapas, Mexico, in 2016. No other putative pathogen was detected by routine diagnostic testing and RNA sequencing.\n\n5 days after Patient 1 died, Patient 2, a previously healthy 38-year-old man with no known coexisting illnesses who had visited Patient 1 in the hospital, reported having conjunctivitis, fevers, myalgia, and facial maculopapular rash. The rash became generalized but resolved within 7 days. On day 7 after the onset of symptoms, urinalysis was positive for ZIKV but serum was negative on PCR assay. Serum IgM antibody to ZIKV was positive. Patient 2 reported having assisted a nurse in repositioning Patient 1 in bed without using gloves. Patient 2 also reported having wiped Patient 1's eyes during the hospitalization but reported having had no other overt contact with blood or other body fluids, including splashes or mucous membrane exposure. No health care workers who had contact with Patient 1 reported having symptomatic illness.\n\nIt is likely that Patient 2 acquired the infection from Patient 1, since Patient 2 had not traveled to an area in which ZIKV is endemic in more than 9 months and had not had sex with a partner who had traveled to such areas. Given the very high level of viremia in Patient 1, infectious levels of virus may have been present in sweat or tears, both of which Patient 2 contacted without gloves. Transmission of the infection through a mosquito bite appears to be unlikely, since _Aedes_ species that are known to transmit ZIKV have not been detected in the Salt Lake City area. In addition, the 2nd case occurred 7 to 10 days after contact with the index patient in the hospital, which implicates direct contact during hospitalization.\n\nThese 2 cases illustrate several important points. The spectrum of those at risk for fulminant ZIKV infection may be broader than previously recognized, and those who are not severely immunocompromised or chronically ill may nevertheless be at risk for fatal infection. The effect of previous infection with related flaviviruses cannot be assessed and may increase the risk of severe ZIKV infection. The transmission of flaviviruses through intact skin or mucous membranes, although uncommon, has been shown in experimental animal models and in at least one human case. Whether contact with highly infectious body fluids from patients with severe ZIKV infection poses an increased risk of transmission is an important question that requires further research.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n[Zika virus shedding in tears has been demonstrated previously. Given Patient 1's high viremia, it seems entirely possible that this is the route of exposure of patient 2, who attended patient 1 without gloves. Perhaps patient 2 touched his eyes or mouth with virus contaminated hands or had a cut. This report establishes with 1st fatal case of Zika virus infection in the USA. It also is the 1st case of transmission by non-sexual direct contact. - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[5] Zika virus infections in children, USA\nDate: Fri 30 Sep 2016\nSource: MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep. ePub: 30 September 2016.

Characteristics of Children Aged Less Than 18 Years with Zika Virus Disease Acquired Postnatally -- U.S. States, January 2015-July 2016.\n\nGuillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome and other neurologic complications can occur in adults after Zika virus infection. However, there are few published reports describing postnatally acquired Zika virus disease among children. During January 2015-July 2016, a total of 158 cases of confirmed or probable postnatally acquired Zika virus disease among children aged less than 18 years were reported to CDC from U.S. states. The median age was 14 years (range = 1 month-17 years), and 88 (56 percent) were female. 2 (1 percent) patients were hospitalized; none developed Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, and none died. All reported cases were travel-associated. Overall, 129 (82 percent) children had rash, 87 (55 percent) had fever, 45 (29 percent) had conjunctivitis, and 44 (28 percent) had arthralgia. 5 (3 percent) patients were pregnant, all of whom were aged 16-17 years. No children were reported to have meningitis, encephalitis, or Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome. Health care providers should consider a diagnosis of Zika virus disease in children who have an epidemiologic risk factor and clinically compatible illness, and should report cases to their state or local health department.\n\nThe symptoms most frequently reported among children with Zika virus disease are common to many childhood illnesses. Health care providers should consider Zika virus disease in the differential diagnosis for children with the acute onset of fever, rash, arthralgia, or conjunctivitis, who reside in or have a history of travel to an area where active Zika virus transmission is occurring, or who have another epidemiologic risk factor for Zika virus disease. Children with suspected Zika virus disease should have blood and urine specimens collected and tested per current guidelines. Although Zika virus disease appears to be a mild illness in children, health care providers should report suspected cases to their state or local health department to facilitate diagnosis and mitigate the risk for local transmission. Providers should counsel sexually active adolescents who might be exposed to Zika virus regarding the risk for congenital Zika virus infection and prevention of unintended pregnancies. Guidance for health care providers caring for infants and children with possible postnatally acquired Zika virus disease is available online (http://www.cdc.gov/zika/hc-providers/infants-children.html).\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[More details are available in this report that can be accessed at the above URL. - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[6] Diagnostic test\nDate: Mon 26 Sep 2016\nSource: Reuters [edited]\nhttp://www.reuters.com/article/us-vela-diagnostics-fda-idUSKCN11W1BO\n\n\nVela Diagnostics said its test for the Zika virus had received \"emergency use authorization\" from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration [FDA].\n\nThe test, already approved in Europe, is validated for plasma, serum and urine samples, the Singapore-based company said on Monday [26 Sep 2016].\n\nThe FDA issues such emergency use authorization during public health emergencies, to quickly deploy unapproved medical products for as long as they are needed. The regulator last month [August 2016] issued a similar authorization for a Zika diagnostics test from Swiss drugmaker Roche.\n\nZika, which was detected in Brazil, has spread to the Americas and is associated with microcephaly, a birth defect characterized by an unusually small head and potential developmental problems. In adults, it has been linked to Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, a temporary paralysis.\n\nThe disease has since spread to parts of Southeast Asia. [The virus was already present in Southeast Asia. - Mod.TY]\n\n[Reporting by Akankshita Mukhopadhyay and Natalie Grover in Bengaluru; editing by Sriraj Kalluvila]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[There is an internal controversy within the CDC about which diagnostic test is best (https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2016/09/27/cdc-whistleblower-claims-agency-has-been-using-wrong-zika-test/). Because Zika, dengue and chikungunya virus infections are clinically similar in many cases, having a rapid and sensitive diagnostic test that can differentiate them is important, especially for pregnant women at risk of teratogenic effects of their fetuses. - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[7] Fetal skull formation\nDate: Thu 29 Sep 2016\nSource: Reuters [edited]\nhttp://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-zika-skull-idUSKCN11Z2CN\n\n\nThe Zika virus causing an epidemic in Brazil and spreading through the Americas can infect and alter cells in the human nervous system that are crucial for formation of bones and cartilage in the skull, a study found on Thursday [29 Sep 2016].\n\nThe research, published in the journal Cell Host & Microbe, may help explain why children born to mothers who have had the virus can have smaller-than-average skulls and disproportionate facial features.\n\nZika has already been shown to attack foetal brain cells known as neural progenitor cells -- a type of stem cell that gives rise to various kinds of brain cells.\n\nThe death of these cells is what disrupts brain development and leads to microcephaly, the severe birth defect seen in babies whose mothers were infected with Zika during pregnancy.\n\nAmerican scientists who conducted this latest study by infecting human cells with Zika in the lab, found the virus can infect another type of cell known as cranial neural crest cells -- which give rise to skull bones and cartilage -- and cause them to secrete signaling molecules that alter their function.\n\nIn the lab, the increased levels of these molecules were enough to induce premature differentiation, migration, and death of human neural progenitor cells, the researchers said.\n\n\"In addition to direct effects of Zika virus on neural progenitors and their derivatives, this virus could affect brain development indirectly, through a signaling cross-talk between embryonic cell types,\" says Joanna Wysocka, a chemical and systems biologist at the Stanford University School of Medicine who co-led the study.\n\nShe added that neural crest cells may be just one example, and that the same mechanism may also be relevant to other tissues that come in contact with a foetus' developing brain during head formation and could be infected by Zika.\n\nThe Zika virus has spread to almost 60 countries and territories since the current outbreak was identified last year in Brazil, raising alarm over its ability to cause microcephaly as well as other neurological disorders in infants and adults. Brazil has been the country hardest hit so far, with more than 1800 reported cases of microcephaly.\n\nWysoka's team cautioned that their work did not provide direct proof that Zika virus infects cranial neural crest cells in live animals or humans. Follow-up research would also be needed to look for any evidence that the virus' effect on these cells would be enough to cause microcephaly, they said.\n\n[Byline: Kate Kelland; editing by Alison

(conf.) The patient is a 34-year-old male tourist, who visited the Maldives from 3-13 Jun 2016 (relevant for cross-reacting antibodies with regard to Zika virus assays). On 16 Jun 2016 he developed retro-orbital pain and on 17 Jun 2016 a diffuse maculopapular rash that spared his face and hands, and joint pains in the wrists, ankles, proximal interphalangeal joints. He presented initially on 22 Jun 2016 (day 6 after symptom onset) at the outpatient department of the Division of Infectious Diseases and Tropical Medicine at LMU. Upon presentation the only remaining symptom was arthralgia. No symptoms were present after 8 days.\n\nThe diagnosis of a ZIKV infection was established by ZIKV IgG and IgM through an IFAT assay. ZIKV was also confirmed directly using a commercially available real-time reverse transcriptase assay RealStar Zika RT PCR Kit (Altona, Hamburg, Germany) in whole blood and urine samples on day 6. Urine samples did not turn positive again, whereas whole blood remained positive until 26 Jul 2016 (day 40 after symptom onset). The symptoms subsided altogether after about 8 days. Ejaculate, oral swabs and serum did not show any positive result at any time. The viral strain was identified by an in-house PCR assay as the Asian lineage that is also responsible for the ZIKV outbreak in Latin America.\n\nThe Maldives are listed in the recent WHO Zika Situational Report of 22 Sep 2016 as a country with known prior ZIKV transmission (country category 3: transmission in 2015 and before) but with no reported transmission in 2016. However, this case is evidence of ongoing ZIKV transmission. The Maldives are widely considered as \"safe\" for honeymoon couples and those wishing to become pregnant (babymoon), for whom currently many destinations in the tropical regions of the world are off limits due to ongoing Zika transmission. However, the Maldives should now also be considered as a destination of ongoing transmission.\n\nReport submitted by Guenter Froeschl, Kristina Huber, Frank von Sonnenburg, and Silke Woelfel Munich GeoSentinel Site and Patricia Schlagenhauf, Chair - GeoSentinel Tracking & Communications Working Group via Davidson H.

South-east Asian Zika virus strain linked to cluster of cases in Singapore, August 2016.\n\nSummary\nZika virus (ZIKV) is an ongoing global public health emergency with 70 countries and territories reporting evidence of ZIKV transmission since 2015. On 27 Aug 2016, Singapore reported its 1st case of local ZIKV transmission and identified an ongoing cluster. Here, we report the genome sequences of ZIKV strains from 2 cases and find through phylogenetic analysis that these strains form an earlier branch distinct from the recent large outbreak in the Americas.\n\nConclusions from sequence and structure analysis\nAt least within the Asian lineage the antigenic protein E surface is highly conserved and homogeneous with, from 2007 onwards, typical identities from 99.4 percent to 100 percent (or 3 to zero mutations) relative to the consensus of recent strains from Brazil. Moreover all of the E proteins in this lineage contain the typical N-glycosylation site (N444 in polyprotein numbering which is N154 in the E protein). The lack of surface mutation drift over the past 50 years (99 percent identity between Malaysia 1966 and consensus of Brazil 2015) also suggests that immune pressure on the E protein has not been a dominant factor in the Asian lineages' virus fitness and evolution so far. While the highly similar surface E proteins of the different strains in the Asian lineage should facilitate global vaccine development it is too early to judge if the strain linked to the Singapore outbreak would show any different disease characteristics from the one in French Polynesia and the Americas. Further studies are necessary and underway in Singapore to collect more data.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n[It is interesting that the Zika virus circulating in Singapore is not the same as that currently circulating in the Americas. One wonders where in Asia it came from, and leads one to speculate that Zika virus is circulating in Asia at low levels and is often undetected or mistaken for dengue cases. - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[3] CDC travel advisory, Asia\nDate: Thu 29 Sep 2016\nSource: CDC [edited]\nhttps://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/zika-virus-southeast-asia\n\n\nZika Virus in Southeast Asia\n----------------------------\nWhat is the current situation?\nTravelers have returned from certain areas of Southeast Asia with Zika virus infection. While our understanding of the complications of Zika virus infection continues to evolve, and pending broader international surveillance efforts for Zika virus infection, we are providing pregnant women and their partners updated recommendations on reducing their risk for travel related Zika virus infection. CDC recommends pregnant women should consider postponing nonessential travel to Southeast Asia countries with reports of Zika virus infection from local transmission or related to travel to those countries, and those countries with adjacent borders where limited information is available to fully evaluate risk of Zika virus infection.\n\nZika virus has been present in areas of Southeast Asia for many years, and several countries have reported occasional cases or small outbreaks of Zika virus infections. Zika virus is considered endemic in some countries, and a large number of local residents are likely to be immune. However, US travelers to endemic areas may not be immune to Zika virus and infections have occurred among travelers to Southeast Asia. Recent variations have been observed in the number of cases reported in Southeast Asia. This can reflect changes in awareness of Zika virus, surveillance and testing for Zika virus, or changes in intensity of Zika virus transmission. Pregnant women traveling to Southeast Asia could become infected with Zika virus. The level of this risk is unknown and likely lower than in areas where Zika virus is newly introduced and spreading widely.\n\nCountries included in this travel message include those listed below. For country-specific information, please visit Health Information for Travelers for individual countries:\nBrunei\nBurma (Myanmar)\nCambodia\nIndonesia\nLaos\nMalaysia\nMaldives\nPhilippines\nThailand\nTimor-Leste (East Timor)\nVietnam\n\nTravel Considerations for Pregnant Women Traveling to Southeast Asia\nZika virus infection during pregnancy causes severe birth defects, including microcephaly and severe fetal brain abnormalities. Therefore, pregnant women should talk with their healthcare provider and consider postponing nonessential travel to Southeast Asia. Zika virus testing should be offered to pregnant women and considered for other people who have symptoms of Zika virus disease if they have recently traveled to Southeast Asia.\n\nWhat can travelers do to prevent Zika?\nThere is no vaccine or medicine for Zika virus infection. Travelers can protect themselves by preventing mosquito bites:\n- Cover exposed skin by wearing long-sleeved shirts and long pants.\n- Use EPA-registered insect repellents containing DEET, picaridin, oil of lemon eucalyptus (OLE, also called para-menthane-diol [PMD]), or IR3535. Always use as directed.\n- Pregnant and breastfeeding women can use all EPA-registered insect repellents, including DEET, according to the product label.\n- Most repellents, including DEET, can be used on children older than 2 months. (OLE should not be used on children younger than 3 years.)\n- Use permethrin-treated clothing and gear (such as boots, pants, socks, and tents). You can buy pre-treated clothing and gear or treat them yourself.\n- Stay in places with air conditioning and window and door screens to keep mosquitoes outside.\n- Sleep under a mosquito bed net if air conditioned or screened rooms are not available or if sleeping outdoors.\n- Mosquito netting can be used to cover babies younger than 2 months old in carriers, strollers, or cribs to protect them from mosquito bites.\n- Zika virus can be passed through sex from a person who has Zika virus to his or her sex partners. The use of condoms during sex (vaginal, anal, and oral) or abstaining from sex while traveling to these areas and after returning from these areas is recommended to avoid getting or passing Zika virus infection.\n\nAfter travel:\nMany people infected with Zika virus do not feel sick. If a mosquito bites an infected person while the virus is still in that person's blood, it can spread the virus by biting another person. Even if they do not feel sick, travelers returning to the United States from countries where Zika virus is endemic should take steps to prevent mosquito bites for 3 weeks so that they do not spread Zika virus to uninfected mosquitoes.\nTravelers returning from countries where Zika virus is endemic and who have a pregnant partner should either use condoms or not have sex for the rest of the pregnancy.\n\nFor more information, see Zika and Sexual Transmission [http://www.cdc.gov/zika/transmission/sexual-transmission.html].\n\nIf you feel sick and think you may have Zika virus:\n- Talk to your doctor if you develop a fever with a rash, joint pain, or red eyes. Tell him or her about your travel.\n- Take acetaminophen (paracetamol) to relieve fever and pain. Do not take aspirin, products containing aspirin, or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as ibuprofen.\n- Get lots of rest and drink plenty of liquids.\n\nIf you are pregnant:\nTalk to a doctor or other healthcare provider after your trip, even if you don't feel sick. Pregnant women who have symptoms and have traveled to these countries should be offered testing for Zika virus infection. Pregnant women who have symptoms and who have had a possible sexual exposure during pregnancy to a partner who traveled to these countries should be offered testing for Zika virus infection.\n- If you develop a fever with a rash, joint pain, or red eyes, talk to your doctor immediately and tell him or her about your travel or possible sexual exposure.\n\nClinician Information\nZika virus during pregnancy causes severe birth defects, including microcephaly and severe fetal brain abnormalities. All pregnant women should be evaluated for possible Zika virus exposure and signs or symptoms consistent with Zika virus disease at each prenatal care visit.\n\nPossible exposures include\n- Travel to an area where there is epidemic or endemic Zika virus transmission\n- Sex with a partner who has traveled to or lived in an area with epidemic or endemic Zika virus transmission\n\nThe recommendations for testing vary according to whether exposure occurred in an area where Zika virus has been newly introduced and is spreading widely or in an area with endemic Zika virus transmission. Dengue and Japanese encephalitis viruses circulate widely in Southeast Asia and might cause false positive results in blood tests. Because of this and related testing factors, routine serologic testing of asymptomatic pregnant women who have traveled to areas of Southeast Asia without epidemic Zika virus transmission is not recommended.

Hanson, M.D., M.H.S., Marc R. Couturier, Ph.D.. Fatal Zika Virus Infection with Secondary Nonsexual Transmission.\n\nEpidemic transmission of Zika virus (ZIKV) has rapidly occurred in the Americas, with most cases limited to mild or asymptomatic disease. To date, 9 deaths from ZIKV infection that were unrelated to the Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome have been confirmed in adults. Here, we report a rapidly progressive, fatal ZIKV infection acquired outside the United States and secondary local transmission in the absence of known risk factors for ZIKV infection.\n\nPatient 1, a 73-year-old man who had emigrated to the United States from Mexico in 2003, was admitted to a hospital in Salt Lake City [Utah] with hypotension and abdominal pain. Radiation therapy for stage IIB prostate cancer had been completed 1 month earlier, and he was receiving antiandrogen therapy but was otherwise not systemically immunocompromised. 8 days before admission, he had returned from a 3-week trip to the southwest coast of Mexico, where ZIKV transmission had been reported. He was well during his trip but reported being bitten by mosquitoes. After returning home, he reported having abdominal pain, pharyngitis, and fever, which was followed by conjunctivitis, nonbloody diarrhea, and myalgias.\n\nOn the day of admission, hypotension and dyspnea had developed. The patient was alert and oriented with no fever but with tachypnea and tachycardia. He remained hypotensive after the administration of intravenous fluids, and vasopressors and broad-spectrum antibiotics were initiated. The physical examination was remarkable for marked erythematous conjunctivitis with profuse tearing and soft-palate petechiae, tachypnea, and moderate, diffuse abdominal pain with mild guarding. A tourniquet test (which is often performed in patients in whom dengue is suspected) was negative.\n\nLaboratory testing revealed metabolic acidosis, an elevated venous lactate level, renal insufficiency, mild hypoglycemia, elevated aminotransferase levels, leukocytosis with 44 percent band forms, anemia, and marked thrombocytopenia. (Details are provided in the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this letter at NEJM.org.) Testing for malaria and blood cultures were negative. A presumptive diagnosis of dengue shock syndrome was made. The patient's clinical deterioration progressed, with progressive respiratory and renal failure, metabolic acidosis, and hepatitis. On day 4 of hospitalization, the patient died shortly after care was withdrawn.\n\nTesting was negative for dengue virus (DENV) on polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) assay. Serologic analysis for DENV was consistent with remote infection, with a highly elevated IgG level and an equivocal IgM level. Serum testing for ZIKV on real-time PCR assay was positive, with a threshold cycle of 17 and a very high estimated viral load of 2.0 x 10^8 ZIKV genome copies per milliliter. High-throughput sequencing of RNA revealed the presence of a ZIKV strain that shared 99.8 percent of the genome sequence with a strain isolated from a mosquito in Chiapas, Mexico, in 2016. No other putative pathogen was detected by routine diagnostic testing and RNA sequencing.\n\n5 days after Patient 1 died, Patient 2, a previously healthy 38-year-old man with no known coexisting illnesses who had visited Patient 1 in the hospital, reported having conjunctivitis, fevers, myalgia, and facial maculopapular rash. The rash became generalized but resolved within 7 days. On day 7 after the onset of symptoms, urinalysis was positive for ZIKV but serum was negative on PCR assay. Serum IgM antibody to ZIKV was positive. Patient 2 reported having assisted a nurse in repositioning Patient 1 in bed without using gloves. Patient 2 also reported having wiped Patient 1's eyes during the hospitalization but reported having had no other overt contact with blood or other body fluids, including splashes or mucous membrane exposure. No health care workers who had contact with Patient 1 reported having symptomatic illness.\n\nIt is likely that Patient 2 acquired the infection from Patient 1, since Patient 2 had not traveled to an area in which ZIKV is endemic in more than 9 months and had not had sex with a partner who had traveled to such areas. Given the very high level of viremia in Patient 1, infectious levels of virus may have been present in sweat or tears, both of which Patient 2 contacted without gloves. Transmission of the infection through a mosquito bite appears to be unlikely, since _Aedes_ species that are known to transmit ZIKV have not been detected in the Salt Lake City area. In addition, the 2nd case occurred 7 to 10 days after contact with the index patient in the hospital, which implicates direct contact during hospitalization.\n\nThese 2 cases illustrate several important points. The spectrum of those at risk for fulminant ZIKV infection may be broader than previously recognized, and those who are not severely immunocompromised or chronically ill may nevertheless be at risk for fatal infection. The effect of previous infection with related flaviviruses cannot be assessed and may increase the risk of severe ZIKV infection. The transmission of flaviviruses through intact skin or mucous membranes, although uncommon, has been shown in experimental animal models and in at least one human case. Whether contact with highly infectious body fluids from patients with severe ZIKV infection poses an increased risk of transmission is an important question that requires further research.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n[Zika virus shedding in tears has been demonstrated previously. Given Patient 1's high viremia, it seems entirely possible that this is the route of exposure of patient 2, who attended patient 1 without gloves. Perhaps patient 2 touched his eyes or mouth with virus contaminated hands or had a cut. This report establishes with 1st fatal case of Zika virus infection in the USA. It also is the 1st case of transmission by non-sexual direct contact. - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[5] Zika virus infections in children, USA\nDate: Fri 30 Sep 2016\nSource: MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep. ePub: 30 September 2016.

Characteristics of Children Aged Less Than 18 Years with Zika Virus Disease Acquired Postnatally -- U.S. States, January 2015-July 2016.\n\nGuillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome and other neurologic complications can occur in adults after Zika virus infection. However, there are few published reports describing postnatally acquired Zika virus disease among children. During January 2015-July 2016, a total of 158 cases of confirmed or probable postnatally acquired Zika virus disease among children aged less than 18 years were reported to CDC from U.S. states. The median age was 14 years (range = 1 month-17 years), and 88 (56 percent) were female. 2 (1 percent) patients were hospitalized; none developed Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, and none died. All reported cases were travel-associated. Overall, 129 (82 percent) children had rash, 87 (55 percent) had fever, 45 (29 percent) had conjunctivitis, and 44 (28 percent) had arthralgia. 5 (3 percent) patients were pregnant, all of whom were aged 16-17 years. No children were reported to have meningitis, encephalitis, or Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome. Health care providers should consider a diagnosis of Zika virus disease in children who have an epidemiologic risk factor and clinically compatible illness, and should report cases to their state or local health department.\n\nThe symptoms most frequently reported among children with Zika virus disease are common to many childhood illnesses. Health care providers should consider Zika virus disease in the differential diagnosis for children with the acute onset of fever, rash, arthralgia, or conjunctivitis, who reside in or have a history of travel to an area where active Zika virus transmission is occurring, or who have another epidemiologic risk factor for Zika virus disease. Children with suspected Zika virus disease should have blood and urine specimens collected and tested per current guidelines. Although Zika virus disease appears to be a mild illness in children, health care providers should report suspected cases to their state or local health department to facilitate diagnosis and mitigate the risk for local transmission. Providers should counsel sexually active adolescents who might be exposed to Zika virus regarding the risk for congenital Zika virus infection and prevention of unintended pregnancies. Guidance for health care providers caring for infants and children with possible postnatally acquired Zika virus disease is available online (http://www.cdc.gov/zika/hc-providers/infants-children.html).\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[More details are available in this report that can be accessed at the above URL. - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[6] Diagnostic test\nDate: Mon 26 Sep 2016\nSource: Reuters [edited]\nhttp://www.reuters.com/article/us-vela-diagnostics-fda-idUSKCN11W1BO\n\n\nVela Diagnostics said its test for the Zika virus had received \"emergency use authorization\" from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration [FDA].\n\nThe test, already approved in Europe, is validated for plasma, serum and urine samples, the Singapore-based company said on Monday [26 Sep 2016].\n\nThe FDA issues such emergency use authorization during public health emergencies, to quickly deploy unapproved medical products for as long as they are needed.

Brazil has been the country hardest hit so far, with more than 1800 reported cases of microcephaly.\n\nWysoka's team cautioned that their work did not provide direct proof that Zika virus infects cranial neural crest cells in live animals or humans. Follow-up research would also be needed to look for any evidence that the virus' effect on these cells would be enough to cause microcephaly, they said.\n\n[Byline: Kate Kelland; editing by Alison

(conf.) The patient is a 34-year-old male tourist, who visited the Maldives from 3-13 Jun 2016 (relevant for cross-reacting antibodies with regard to Zika virus assays). On 16 Jun 2016 he developed retro-orbital pain and on 17 Jun 2016 a diffuse maculopapular rash that spared his face and hands, and joint pains in the wrists, ankles, proximal interphalangeal joints. He presented initially on 22 Jun 2016 (day 6 after symptom onset) at the outpatient department of the Division of Infectious Diseases and Tropical Medicine at LMU. Upon presentation the only remaining symptom was arthralgia. No symptoms were present after 8 days.\n\nThe diagnosis of a ZIKV infection was established by ZIKV IgG and IgM through an IFAT assay. ZIKV was also confirmed directly using a commercially available real-time reverse transcriptase assay RealStar Zika RT PCR Kit (Altona, Hamburg, Germany) in whole blood and urine samples on day 6. Urine samples did not turn positive again, whereas whole blood remained positive until 26 Jul 2016 (day 40 after symptom onset). The symptoms subsided altogether after about 8 days. Ejaculate, oral swabs and serum did not show any positive result at any time. The viral strain was identified by an in-house PCR assay as the Asian lineage that is also responsible for the ZIKV outbreak in Latin America.\n\nThe Maldives are listed in the recent WHO Zika Situational Report of 22 Sep 2016 as a country with known prior ZIKV transmission (country category 3: transmission in 2015 and before) but with no reported transmission in 2016. However, this case is evidence of ongoing ZIKV transmission. The Maldives are widely considered as \"safe\" for honeymoon couples and those wishing to become pregnant (babymoon), for whom currently many destinations in the tropical regions of the world are off limits due to ongoing Zika transmission. However, the Maldives should now also be considered as a destination of ongoing transmission.\n\nReport submitted by Guenter Froeschl, Kristina Huber, Frank von Sonnenburg, and Silke Woelfel Munich GeoSentinel Site and Patricia Schlagenhauf, Chair - GeoSentinel Tracking & Communications Working Group via Davidson H.

On 27 Aug 2016, Singapore reported its 1st case of local ZIKV transmission and identified an ongoing cluster. Here, we report the genome sequences of ZIKV strains from 2 cases and find through phylogenetic analysis that these strains form an earlier branch distinct from the recent large outbreak in the Americas.\n\nConclusions from sequence and structure analysis\nAt least within the Asian lineage the antigenic protein E surface is highly conserved and homogeneous with, from 2007 onwards, typical identities from 99.4 percent to 100 percent (or 3 to zero mutations) relative to the consensus of recent strains from Brazil. Moreover all of the E proteins in this lineage contain the typical N-glycosylation site (N444 in polyprotein numbering which is N154 in the E protein). The lack of surface mutation drift over the past 50 years (99 percent identity between Malaysia 1966 and consensus of Brazil 2015) also suggests that immune pressure on the E protein has not been a dominant factor in the Asian lineages' virus fitness and evolution so far. While the highly similar surface E proteins of the different strains in the Asian lineage should facilitate global vaccine development it is too early to judge if the strain linked to the Singapore outbreak would show any different disease characteristics from the one in French Polynesia and the Americas. Further studies are necessary and underway in Singapore to collect more data.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n[It is interesting that the Zika virus circulating in Singapore is not the same as that currently circulating in the Americas. One wonders where in Asia it came from, and leads one to speculate that Zika virus is circulating in Asia at low levels and is often undetected or mistaken for dengue cases. - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[3] CDC travel advisory, Asia\nDate: Thu 29 Sep 2016\nSource: CDC [edited]\nhttps://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/zika-virus-southeast-asia\n\n\nZika Virus in Southeast Asia\n----------------------------\nWhat is the current situation?\nTravelers have returned from certain areas of Southeast Asia with Zika virus infection. While our understanding of the complications of Zika virus infection continues to evolve, and pending broader international surveillance efforts for Zika virus infection, we are providing pregnant women and their partners updated recommendations on reducing their risk for travel related Zika virus infection. CDC recommends pregnant women should consider postponing nonessential travel to Southeast Asia countries with reports of Zika virus infection from local transmission or related to travel to those countries, and those countries with adjacent borders where limited information is available to fully evaluate risk of Zika virus infection.\n\nZika virus has been present in areas of Southeast Asia for many years, and several countries have reported occasional cases or small outbreaks of Zika virus infections. Zika virus is considered endemic in some countries, and a large number of local residents are likely to be immune. However, US travelers to endemic areas may not be immune to Zika virus and infections have occurred among travelers to Southeast Asia. Recent variations have been observed in the number of cases reported in Southeast Asia. This can reflect changes in awareness of Zika virus, surveillance and testing for Zika virus, or changes in intensity of Zika virus transmission. Pregnant women traveling to Southeast Asia could become infected with Zika virus. The level of this risk is unknown and likely lower than in areas where Zika virus is newly introduced and spreading widely.\n\nCountries included in this travel message include those listed below. For country-specific information, please visit Health Information for Travelers for individual countries:\nBrunei\nBurma (Myanmar)\nCambodia\nIndonesia\nLaos\nMalaysia\nMaldives\nPhilippines\nThailand\nTimor-Leste (East Timor)\nVietnam\n\nTravel Considerations for Pregnant Women Traveling to Southeast Asia\nZika virus infection during pregnancy causes severe birth defects, including microcephaly and severe fetal brain abnormalities. Therefore, pregnant women should talk with their healthcare provider and consider postponing nonessential travel to Southeast Asia. Zika virus testing should be offered to pregnant women and considered for other people who have symptoms of Zika virus disease if they have recently traveled to Southeast Asia.\n\nWhat can travelers do to prevent Zika?\nThere is no vaccine or medicine for Zika virus infection. Travelers can protect themselves by preventing mosquito bites:\n- Cover exposed skin by wearing long-sleeved shirts and long pants.\n- Use EPA-registered insect repellents containing DEET, picaridin, oil of lemon eucalyptus (OLE, also called para-menthane-diol [PMD]), or IR3535. Always use as directed.\n- Pregnant and breastfeeding women can use all EPA-registered insect repellents, including DEET, according to the product label.\n- Most repellents, including DEET, can be used on children older than 2 months. (OLE should not be used on children younger than 3 years.)\n- Use permethrin-treated clothing and gear (such as boots, pants, socks, and tents). You can buy pre-treated clothing and gear or treat them yourself.\n- Stay in places with air conditioning and window and door screens to keep mosquitoes outside.\n- Sleep under a mosquito bed net if air conditioned or screened rooms are not available or if sleeping outdoors.\n- Mosquito netting can be used to cover babies younger than 2 months old in carriers, strollers, or cribs to protect them from mosquito bites.\n- Zika virus can be passed through sex from a person who has Zika virus to his or her sex partners. The use of condoms during sex (vaginal, anal, and oral) or abstaining from sex while traveling to these areas and after returning from these areas is recommended to avoid getting or passing Zika virus infection.\n\nAfter travel:\nMany people infected with Zika virus do not feel sick. If a mosquito bites an infected person while the virus is still in that person's blood, it can spread the virus by biting another person. Even if they do not feel sick, travelers returning to the United States from countries where Zika virus is endemic should take steps to prevent mosquito bites for 3 weeks so that they do not spread Zika virus to uninfected mosquitoes.\nTravelers returning from countries where Zika virus is endemic and who have a pregnant partner should either use condoms or not have sex for the rest of the pregnancy.\n\nFor more information, see Zika and Sexual Transmission [http://www.cdc.gov/zika/transmission/sexual-transmission.html].\n\nIf you feel sick and think you may have Zika virus:\n- Talk to your doctor if you develop a fever with a rash, joint pain, or red eyes. Tell him or her about your travel.\n- Take acetaminophen (paracetamol) to relieve fever and pain. Do not take aspirin, products containing aspirin, or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as ibuprofen.\n- Get lots of rest and drink plenty of liquids.\n\nIf you are pregnant:\nTalk to a doctor or other healthcare provider after your trip, even if you don't feel sick. Pregnant women who have symptoms and have traveled to these countries should be offered testing for Zika virus infection. Pregnant women who have symptoms and who have had a possible sexual exposure during pregnancy to a partner who traveled to these countries should be offered testing for Zika virus infection.\n- If you develop a fever with a rash, joint pain, or red eyes, talk to your doctor immediately and tell him or her about your travel or possible sexual exposure.\n\nClinician Information\nZika virus during pregnancy causes severe birth defects, including microcephaly and severe fetal brain abnormalities. All pregnant women should be evaluated for possible Zika virus exposure and signs or symptoms consistent with Zika virus disease at each prenatal care visit.\n\nPossible exposures include\n- Travel to an area where there is epidemic or endemic Zika virus transmission\n- Sex with a partner who has traveled to or lived in an area with epidemic or endemic Zika virus transmission\n\nThe recommendations for testing vary according to whether exposure occurred in an area where Zika virus has been newly introduced and is spreading widely or in an area with endemic Zika virus transmission. Dengue and Japanese encephalitis viruses circulate widely in Southeast Asia and might cause false positive results in blood tests. Because of this and related testing factors, routine serologic testing of asymptomatic pregnant women who have traveled to areas of Southeast Asia without epidemic Zika virus transmission is not recommended. For more information, please visit the Clinical Guidance for Healthcare Providers Caring for Pregnant Women webpage [http://www.cdc.gov/zika/hc-providers/pregnant-woman.html].\n\nClinical Guidance for Healthcare Providers Caring for Infants & Children is also available [http://www.cdc.gov/zika/hc-providers/infants-children.html].\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n[This advisory is applicable to travelers of any nationality going to the countries listed above.

Hanson, M.D., M.H.S., Marc R. Couturier, Ph.D.. Fatal Zika Virus Infection with Secondary Nonsexual Transmission.\n\nEpidemic transmission of Zika virus (ZIKV) has rapidly occurred in the Americas, with most cases limited to mild or asymptomatic disease. To date, 9 deaths from ZIKV infection that were unrelated to the Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome have been confirmed in adults. Here, we report a rapidly progressive, fatal ZIKV infection acquired outside the United States and secondary local transmission in the absence of known risk factors for ZIKV infection.\n\nPatient 1, a 73-year-old man who had emigrated to the United States from Mexico in 2003, was admitted to a hospital in Salt Lake City [Utah] with hypotension and abdominal pain. Radiation therapy for stage IIB prostate cancer had been completed 1 month earlier, and he was receiving antiandrogen therapy but was otherwise not systemically immunocompromised. 8 days before admission, he had returned from a 3-week trip to the southwest coast of Mexico, where ZIKV transmission had been reported. He was well during his trip but reported being bitten by mosquitoes. After returning home, he reported having abdominal pain, pharyngitis, and fever, which was followed by conjunctivitis, nonbloody diarrhea, and myalgias.\n\nOn the day of admission, hypotension and dyspnea had developed. The patient was alert and oriented with no fever but with tachypnea and tachycardia. He remained hypotensive after the administration of intravenous fluids, and vasopressors and broad-spectrum antibiotics were initiated. The physical examination was remarkable for marked erythematous conjunctivitis with profuse tearing and soft-palate petechiae, tachypnea, and moderate, diffuse abdominal pain with mild guarding. A tourniquet test (which is often performed in patients in whom dengue is suspected) was negative.\n\nLaboratory testing revealed metabolic acidosis, an elevated venous lactate level, renal insufficiency, mild hypoglycemia, elevated aminotransferase levels, leukocytosis with 44 percent band forms, anemia, and marked thrombocytopenia. (Details are provided in the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this letter at NEJM.org.) Testing for malaria and blood cultures were negative. A presumptive diagnosis of dengue shock syndrome was made. The patient's clinical deterioration progressed, with progressive respiratory and renal failure, metabolic acidosis, and hepatitis. On day 4 of hospitalization, the patient died shortly after care was withdrawn.\n\nTesting was negative for dengue virus (DENV) on polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) assay. Serologic analysis for DENV was consistent with remote infection, with a highly elevated IgG level and an equivocal IgM level. Serum testing for ZIKV on real-time PCR assay was positive, with a threshold cycle of 17 and a very high estimated viral load of 2.0 x 10^8 ZIKV genome copies per milliliter. High-throughput sequencing of RNA revealed the presence of a ZIKV strain that shared 99.8 percent of the genome sequence with a strain isolated from a mosquito in Chiapas, Mexico, in 2016. No other putative pathogen was detected by routine diagnostic testing and RNA sequencing.\n\n5 days after Patient 1 died, Patient 2, a previously healthy 38-year-old man with no known coexisting illnesses who had visited Patient 1 in the hospital, reported having conjunctivitis, fevers, myalgia, and facial maculopapular rash. The rash became generalized but resolved within 7 days. On day 7 after the onset of symptoms, urinalysis was positive for ZIKV but serum was negative on PCR assay. Serum IgM antibody to ZIKV was positive. Patient 2 reported having assisted a nurse in repositioning Patient 1 in bed without using gloves. Patient 2 also reported having wiped Patient 1's eyes during the hospitalization but reported having had no other overt contact with blood or other body fluids, including splashes or mucous membrane exposure. No health care workers who had contact with Patient 1 reported having symptomatic illness.\n\nIt is likely that Patient 2 acquired the infection from Patient 1, since Patient 2 had not traveled to an area in which ZIKV is endemic in more than 9 months and had not had sex with a partner who had traveled to such areas. Given the very high level of viremia in Patient 1, infectious levels of virus may have been present in sweat or tears, both of which Patient 2 contacted without gloves. Transmission of the infection through a mosquito bite appears to be unlikely, since _Aedes_ species that are known to transmit ZIKV have not been detected in the Salt Lake City area. In addition, the 2nd case occurred 7 to 10 days after contact with the index patient in the hospital, which implicates direct contact during hospitalization.\n\nThese 2 cases illustrate several important points. The spectrum of those at risk for fulminant ZIKV infection may be broader than previously recognized, and those who are not severely immunocompromised or chronically ill may nevertheless be at risk for fatal infection. The effect of previous infection with related flaviviruses cannot be assessed and may increase the risk of severe ZIKV infection. The transmission of flaviviruses through intact skin or mucous membranes, although uncommon, has been shown in experimental animal models and in at least one human case. Whether contact with highly infectious body fluids from patients with severe ZIKV infection poses an increased risk of transmission is an important question that requires further research.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n[Zika virus shedding in tears has been demonstrated previously. Given Patient 1's high viremia, it seems entirely possible that this is the route of exposure of patient 2, who attended patient 1 without gloves. Perhaps patient 2 touched his eyes or mouth with virus contaminated hands or had a cut. This report establishes with 1st fatal case of Zika virus infection in the USA. It also is the 1st case of transmission by non-sexual direct contact. - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[5] Zika virus infections in children, USA\nDate: Fri 30 Sep 2016\nSource: MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep. ePub: 30 September 2016.

Characteristics of Children Aged Less Than 18 Years with Zika Virus Disease Acquired Postnatally -- U.S. States, January 2015-July 2016.\n\nGuillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome and other neurologic complications can occur in adults after Zika virus infection. However, there are few published reports describing postnatally acquired Zika virus disease among children. During January 2015-July 2016, a total of 158 cases of confirmed or probable postnatally acquired Zika virus disease among children aged less than 18 years were reported to CDC from U.S. states. The median age was 14 years (range = 1 month-17 years), and 88 (56 percent) were female. 2 (1 percent) patients were hospitalized; none developed Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, and none died. All reported cases were travel-associated. Overall, 129 (82 percent) children had rash, 87 (55 percent) had fever, 45 (29 percent) had conjunctivitis, and 44 (28 percent) had arthralgia. 5 (3 percent) patients were pregnant, all of whom were aged 16-17 years. No children were reported to have meningitis, encephalitis, or Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome. Health care providers should consider a diagnosis of Zika virus disease in children who have an epidemiologic risk factor and clinically compatible illness, and should report cases to their state or local health department.\n\nThe symptoms most frequently reported among children with Zika virus disease are common to many childhood illnesses. Health care providers should consider Zika virus disease in the differential diagnosis for children with the acute onset of fever, rash, arthralgia, or conjunctivitis, who reside in or have a history of travel to an area where active Zika virus transmission is occurring, or who have another epidemiologic risk factor for Zika virus disease. Children with suspected Zika virus disease should have blood and urine specimens collected and tested per current guidelines. Although Zika virus disease appears to be a mild illness in children, health care providers should report suspected cases to their state or local health department to facilitate diagnosis and mitigate the risk for local transmission. Providers should counsel sexually active adolescents who might be exposed to Zika virus regarding the risk for congenital Zika virus infection and prevention of unintended pregnancies.

The regulator last month [August 2016] issued a similar authorization for a Zika diagnostics test from Swiss drugmaker Roche.\n\nZika, which was detected in Brazil, has spread to the Americas and is associated with microcephaly, a birth defect characterized by an unusually small head and potential developmental problems.

Brazil has been the country hardest hit so far, with more than 1800 reported cases of microcephaly.\n\nWysoka's team cautioned that their work did not provide direct proof that Zika virus infects cranial neural crest cells in live animals or humans. Follow-up research would also be needed to look for any evidence that the virus' effect on these cells would be enough to cause microcephaly, they said.\n\n[Byline: Kate Kelland; editing by Alison

(conf.) The patient is a 34-year-old male tourist, who visited the Maldives from 3-13 Jun 2016 (relevant for cross-reacting antibodies with regard to Zika virus assays). On 16 Jun 2016 he developed retro-orbital pain and on 17 Jun 2016 a diffuse maculopapular rash that spared his face and hands, and joint pains in the wrists, ankles, proximal interphalangeal joints. He presented initially on 22 Jun 2016 (day 6 after symptom onset) at the outpatient department of the Division of Infectious Diseases and Tropical Medicine at LMU. Upon presentation the only remaining symptom was arthralgia. No symptoms were present after 8 days.\n\nThe diagnosis of a ZIKV infection was established by ZIKV IgG and IgM through an IFAT assay. ZIKV was also confirmed directly using a commercially available real-time reverse transcriptase assay RealStar Zika RT PCR Kit (Altona, Hamburg, Germany) in whole blood and urine samples on day 6. Urine samples did not turn positive again, whereas whole blood remained positive until 26 Jul 2016 (day 40 after symptom onset). The symptoms subsided altogether after about 8 days. Ejaculate, oral swabs and serum did not show any positive result at any time. The viral strain was identified by an in-house PCR assay as the Asian lineage that is also responsible for the ZIKV outbreak in Latin America.\n\nThe Maldives are listed in the recent WHO Zika Situational Report of 22 Sep 2016 as a country with known prior ZIKV transmission (country category 3: transmission in 2015 and before) but with no reported transmission in 2016. However, this case is evidence of ongoing ZIKV transmission. The Maldives are widely considered as \"safe\" for honeymoon couples and those wishing to become pregnant (babymoon), for whom currently many destinations in the tropical regions of the world are off limits due to ongoing Zika transmission. However, the Maldives should now also be considered as a destination of ongoing transmission.\n\nReport submitted by Guenter Froeschl, Kristina Huber, Frank von Sonnenburg, and Silke Woelfel Munich GeoSentinel Site and Patricia Schlagenhauf, Chair - GeoSentinel Tracking & Communications Working Group via Davidson H.

South-east Asian Zika virus strain linked to cluster of cases in Singapore, August 2016.\n\nSummary\nZika virus (ZIKV) is an ongoing global public health emergency with 70 countries and territories reporting evidence of ZIKV transmission since 2015. On 27 Aug 2016, Singapore reported its 1st case of local ZIKV transmission and identified an ongoing cluster. Here, we report the genome sequences of ZIKV strains from 2 cases and find through phylogenetic analysis that these strains form an earlier branch distinct from the recent large outbreak in the Americas.\n\nConclusions from sequence and structure analysis\nAt least within the Asian lineage the antigenic protein E surface is highly conserved and homogeneous with, from 2007 onwards, typical identities from 99.4 percent to 100 percent (or 3 to zero mutations) relative to the consensus of recent strains from Brazil. Moreover all of the E proteins in this lineage contain the typical N-glycosylation site (N444 in polyprotein numbering which is N154 in the E protein). The lack of surface mutation drift over the past 50 years (99 percent identity between Malaysia 1966 and consensus of Brazil 2015) also suggests that immune pressure on the E protein has not been a dominant factor in the Asian lineages' virus fitness and evolution so far. While the highly similar surface E proteins of the different strains in the Asian lineage should facilitate global vaccine development it is too early to judge if the strain linked to the Singapore outbreak would show any different disease characteristics from the one in French Polynesia and the Americas. Further studies are necessary and underway in Singapore to collect more data.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n[It is interesting that the Zika virus circulating in Singapore is not the same as that currently circulating in the Americas. One wonders where in Asia it came from, and leads one to speculate that Zika virus is circulating in Asia at low levels and is often undetected or mistaken for dengue cases. - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[3] CDC travel advisory, Asia\nDate: Thu 29 Sep 2016\nSource: CDC [edited]\nhttps://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/zika-virus-southeast-asia\n\n\nZika Virus in Southeast Asia\n----------------------------\nWhat is the current situation?\nTravelers have returned from certain areas of Southeast Asia with Zika virus infection. While our understanding of the complications of Zika virus infection continues to evolve, and pending broader international surveillance efforts for Zika virus infection, we are providing pregnant women and their partners updated recommendations on reducing their risk for travel related Zika virus infection. CDC recommends pregnant women should consider postponing nonessential travel to Southeast Asia countries with reports of Zika virus infection from local transmission or related to travel to those countries, and those countries with adjacent borders where limited information is available to fully evaluate risk of Zika virus infection.\n\nZika virus has been present in areas of Southeast Asia for many years, and several countries have reported occasional cases or small outbreaks of Zika virus infections. Zika virus is considered endemic in some countries, and a large number of local residents are likely to be immune. However, US travelers to endemic areas may not be immune to Zika virus and infections have occurred among travelers to Southeast Asia. Recent variations have been observed in the number of cases reported in Southeast Asia. This can reflect changes in awareness of Zika virus, surveillance and testing for Zika virus, or changes in intensity of Zika virus transmission. Pregnant women traveling to Southeast Asia could become infected with Zika virus. The level of this risk is unknown and likely lower than in areas where Zika virus is newly introduced and spreading widely.\n\nCountries included in this travel message include those listed below. For country-specific information, please visit Health Information for Travelers for individual countries:\nBrunei\nBurma (Myanmar)\nCambodia\nIndonesia\nLaos\nMalaysia\nMaldives\nPhilippines\nThailand\nTimor-Leste (East Timor)\nVietnam\n\nTravel Considerations for Pregnant Women Traveling to Southeast Asia\nZika virus infection during pregnancy causes severe birth defects, including microcephaly and severe fetal brain abnormalities. Therefore, pregnant women should talk with their healthcare provider and consider postponing nonessential travel to Southeast Asia. Zika virus testing should be offered to pregnant women and considered for other people who have symptoms of Zika virus disease if they have recently traveled to Southeast Asia.\n\nWhat can travelers do to prevent Zika?\nThere is no vaccine or medicine for Zika virus infection. Travelers can protect themselves by preventing mosquito bites:\n- Cover exposed skin by wearing long-sleeved shirts and long pants.\n- Use EPA-registered insect repellents containing DEET, picaridin, oil of lemon eucalyptus (OLE, also called para-menthane-diol [PMD]), or IR3535. Always use as directed.\n- Pregnant and breastfeeding women can use all EPA-registered insect repellents, including DEET, according to the product label.\n- Most repellents, including DEET, can be used on children older than 2 months. (OLE should not be used on children younger than 3 years.)\n- Use permethrin-treated clothing and gear (such as boots, pants, socks, and tents). You can buy pre-treated clothing and gear or treat them yourself.\n- Stay in places with air conditioning and window and door screens to keep mosquitoes outside.\n- Sleep under a mosquito bed net if air conditioned or screened rooms are not available or if sleeping outdoors.\n- Mosquito netting can be used to cover babies younger than 2 months old in carriers, strollers, or cribs to protect them from mosquito bites.\n- Zika virus can be passed through sex from a person who has Zika virus to his or her sex partners. The use of condoms during sex (vaginal, anal, and oral) or abstaining from sex while traveling to these areas and after returning from these areas is recommended to avoid getting or passing Zika virus infection.\n\nAfter travel:\nMany people infected with Zika virus do not feel sick. If a mosquito bites an infected person while the virus is still in that person's blood, it can spread the virus by biting another person. Even if they do not feel sick, travelers returning to the United States from countries where Zika virus is endemic should take steps to prevent mosquito bites for 3 weeks so that they do not spread Zika virus to uninfected mosquitoes.\nTravelers returning from countries where Zika virus is endemic and who have a pregnant partner should either use condoms or not have sex for the rest of the pregnancy.\n\nFor more information, see Zika and Sexual Transmission [http://www.cdc.gov/zika/transmission/sexual-transmission.html].\n\nIf you feel sick and think you may have Zika virus:\n- Talk to your doctor if you develop a fever with a rash, joint pain, or red eyes. Tell him or her about your travel.\n- Take acetaminophen (paracetamol) to relieve fever and pain. Do not take aspirin, products containing aspirin, or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as ibuprofen.\n- Get lots of rest and drink plenty of liquids.\n\nIf you are pregnant:\nTalk to a doctor or other healthcare provider after your trip, even if you don't feel sick. Pregnant women who have symptoms and have traveled to these countries should be offered testing for Zika virus infection. Pregnant women who have symptoms and who have had a possible sexual exposure during pregnancy to a partner who traveled to these countries should be offered testing for Zika virus infection.\n- If you develop a fever with a rash, joint pain, or red eyes, talk to your doctor immediately and tell him or her about your travel or possible sexual exposure.\n\nClinician Information\nZika virus during pregnancy causes severe birth defects, including microcephaly and severe fetal brain abnormalities. All pregnant women should be evaluated for possible Zika virus exposure and signs or symptoms consistent with Zika virus disease at each prenatal care visit.\n\nPossible exposures include\n- Travel to an area where there is epidemic or endemic Zika virus transmission\n- Sex with a partner who has traveled to or lived in an area with epidemic or endemic Zika virus transmission\n\nThe recommendations for testing vary according to whether exposure occurred in an area where Zika virus has been newly introduced and is spreading widely or in an area with endemic Zika virus transmission. Dengue and Japanese encephalitis viruses circulate widely in Southeast Asia and might cause false positive results in blood tests. Because of this and related testing factors, routine serologic testing of asymptomatic pregnant women who have traveled to areas of Southeast Asia without epidemic Zika virus transmission is not recommended. For more information, please visit the Clinical Guidance for Healthcare Providers Caring for Pregnant Women webpage [http://www.cdc.gov/zika/hc-providers/pregnant-woman.html].\n\nClinical Guidance for Healthcare Providers Caring for Infants & Children is also available [http://www.cdc.gov/zika/hc-providers/infants-children.html].\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n[This advisory is applicable to travelers of any nationality going to the countries listed above.

Hanson, M.D., M.H.S., Marc R. Couturier, Ph.D.. Fatal Zika Virus Infection with Secondary Nonsexual Transmission.\n\nEpidemic transmission of Zika virus (ZIKV) has rapidly occurred in the Americas, with most cases limited to mild or asymptomatic disease. To date, 9 deaths from ZIKV infection that were unrelated to the Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome have been confirmed in adults. Here, we report a rapidly progressive, fatal ZIKV infection acquired outside the United States and secondary local transmission in the absence of known risk factors for ZIKV infection.\n\nPatient 1, a 73-year-old man who had emigrated to the United States from Mexico in 2003, was admitted to a hospital in Salt Lake City [Utah] with hypotension and abdominal pain. Radiation therapy for stage IIB prostate cancer had been completed 1 month earlier, and he was receiving antiandrogen therapy but was otherwise not systemically immunocompromised. 8 days before admission, he had returned from a 3-week trip to the southwest coast of Mexico, where ZIKV transmission had been reported. He was well during his trip but reported being bitten by mosquitoes. After returning home, he reported having abdominal pain, pharyngitis, and fever, which was followed by conjunctivitis, nonbloody diarrhea, and myalgias.\n\nOn the day of admission, hypotension and dyspnea had developed. The patient was alert and oriented with no fever but with tachypnea and tachycardia. He remained hypotensive after the administration of intravenous fluids, and vasopressors and broad-spectrum antibiotics were initiated. The physical examination was remarkable for marked erythematous conjunctivitis with profuse tearing and soft-palate petechiae, tachypnea, and moderate, diffuse abdominal pain with mild guarding. A tourniquet test (which is often performed in patients in whom dengue is suspected) was negative.\n\nLaboratory testing revealed metabolic acidosis, an elevated venous lactate level, renal insufficiency, mild hypoglycemia, elevated aminotransferase levels, leukocytosis with 44 percent band forms, anemia, and marked thrombocytopenia. (Details are provided in the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this letter at NEJM.org.) Testing for malaria and blood cultures were negative. A presumptive diagnosis of dengue shock syndrome was made. The patient's clinical deterioration progressed, with progressive respiratory and renal failure, metabolic acidosis, and hepatitis. On day 4 of hospitalization, the patient died shortly after care was withdrawn.\n\nTesting was negative for dengue virus (DENV) on polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) assay. Serologic analysis for DENV was consistent with remote infection, with a highly elevated IgG level and an equivocal IgM level. Serum testing for ZIKV on real-time PCR assay was positive, with a threshold cycle of 17 and a very high estimated viral load of 2.0 x 10^8 ZIKV genome copies per milliliter. High-throughput sequencing of RNA revealed the presence of a ZIKV strain that shared 99.8 percent of the genome sequence with a strain isolated from a mosquito in Chiapas, Mexico, in 2016. No other putative pathogen was detected by routine diagnostic testing and RNA sequencing.\n\n5 days after Patient 1 died, Patient 2, a previously healthy 38-year-old man with no known coexisting illnesses who had visited Patient 1 in the hospital, reported having conjunctivitis, fevers, myalgia, and facial maculopapular rash. The rash became generalized but resolved within 7 days. On day 7 after the onset of symptoms, urinalysis was positive for ZIKV but serum was negative on PCR assay. Serum IgM antibody to ZIKV was positive. Patient 2 reported having assisted a nurse in repositioning Patient 1 in bed without using gloves. Patient 2 also reported having wiped Patient 1's eyes during the hospitalization but reported having had no other overt contact with blood or other body fluids, including splashes or mucous membrane exposure. No health care workers who had contact with Patient 1 reported having symptomatic illness.\n\nIt is likely that Patient 2 acquired the infection from Patient 1, since Patient 2 had not traveled to an area in which ZIKV is endemic in more than 9 months and had not had sex with a partner who had traveled to such areas. Given the very high level of viremia in Patient 1, infectious levels of virus may have been present in sweat or tears, both of which Patient 2 contacted without gloves. Transmission of the infection through a mosquito bite appears to be unlikely, since _Aedes_ species that are known to transmit ZIKV have not been detected in the Salt Lake City area. In addition, the 2nd case occurred 7 to 10 days after contact with the index patient in the hospital, which implicates direct contact during hospitalization.\n\nThese 2 cases illustrate several important points. The spectrum of those at risk for fulminant ZIKV infection may be broader than previously recognized, and those who are not severely immunocompromised or chronically ill may nevertheless be at risk for fatal infection. The effect of previous infection with related flaviviruses cannot be assessed and may increase the risk of severe ZIKV infection. The transmission of flaviviruses through intact skin or mucous membranes, although uncommon, has been shown in experimental animal models and in at least one human case. Whether contact with highly infectious body fluids from patients with severe ZIKV infection poses an increased risk of transmission is an important question that requires further research.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n[Zika virus shedding in tears has been demonstrated previously. Given Patient 1's high viremia, it seems entirely possible that this is the route of exposure of patient 2, who attended patient 1 without gloves. Perhaps patient 2 touched his eyes or mouth with virus contaminated hands or had a cut. This report establishes with 1st fatal case of Zika virus infection in the USA. It also is the 1st case of transmission by non-sexual direct contact. - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[5] Zika virus infections in children, USA\nDate: Fri 30 Sep 2016\nSource: MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep. ePub: 30 September 2016.

Characteristics of Children Aged Less Than 18 Years with Zika Virus Disease Acquired Postnatally -- U.S. States, January 2015-July 2016.\n\nGuillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome and other neurologic complications can occur in adults after Zika virus infection. However, there are few published reports describing postnatally acquired Zika virus disease among children. During January 2015-July 2016, a total of 158 cases of confirmed or probable postnatally acquired Zika virus disease among children aged less than 18 years were reported to CDC from U.S. states. The median age was 14 years (range = 1 month-17 years), and 88 (56 percent) were female. 2 (1 percent) patients were hospitalized; none developed Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, and none died. All reported cases were travel-associated. Overall, 129 (82 percent) children had rash, 87 (55 percent) had fever, 45 (29 percent) had conjunctivitis, and 44 (28 percent) had arthralgia. 5 (3 percent) patients were pregnant, all of whom were aged 16-17 years. No children were reported to have meningitis, encephalitis, or Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome. Health care providers should consider a diagnosis of Zika virus disease in children who have an epidemiologic risk factor and clinically compatible illness, and should report cases to their state or local health department.\n\nThe symptoms most frequently reported among children with Zika virus disease are common to many childhood illnesses. Health care providers should consider Zika virus disease in the differential diagnosis for children with the acute onset of fever, rash, arthralgia, or conjunctivitis, who reside in or have a history of travel to an area where active Zika virus transmission is occurring, or who have another epidemiologic risk factor for Zika virus disease. Children with suspected Zika virus disease should have blood and urine specimens collected and tested per current guidelines. Although Zika virus disease appears to be a mild illness in children, health care providers should report suspected cases to their state or local health department to facilitate diagnosis and mitigate the risk for local transmission. Providers should counsel sexually active adolescents who might be exposed to Zika virus regarding the risk for congenital Zika virus infection and prevention of unintended pregnancies. Guidance for health care providers caring for infants and children with possible postnatally acquired Zika virus disease is available online (http://www.cdc.gov/zika/hc-providers/infants-children.html).\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[More details are available in this report that can be accessed at the above URL. - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[6] Diagnostic test\nDate: Mon 26 Sep 2016\nSource: Reuters [edited]\nhttp://www.reuters.com/article/us-vela-diagnostics-fda-idUSKCN11W1BO\n\n\nVela Diagnostics said its test for the Zika virus had received \"emergency use authorization\" from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration [FDA].\n\nThe test, already approved in Europe, is validated for plasma, serum and urine samples, the Singapore-based company said on Monday [26 Sep 2016].\n\nThe FDA issues such emergency use authorization during public health emergencies, to quickly deploy unapproved medical products for as long as they are needed. The regulator last month [August 2016] issued a similar authorization for a Zika diagnostics test from Swiss drugmaker Roche.\n\nZika, which was detected in Brazil, has spread to the Americas and is associated with microcephaly, a birth defect characterized by an unusually small head and potential developmental problems. In adults, it has been linked to Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, a temporary paralysis.\n\nThe disease has since spread to parts of Southeast Asia.

Because Zika, dengue and chikungunya virus infections are clinically similar in many cases, having a rapid and sensitive diagnostic test that can differentiate them is important, especially for pregnant women at risk of teratogenic effects of their fetuses. - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[7] Fetal skull formation\nDate: Thu 29 Sep 2016\nSource: Reuters [edited]\nhttp://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-zika-skull-idUSKCN11Z2CN\n\n\nThe Zika virus causing an epidemic in Brazil and spreading through the Americas can infect and alter cells in the human nervous system that are crucial for formation of bones and cartilage in the skull, a study found on Thursday [29 Sep 2016].\n\nThe research, published in the journal Cell Host & Microbe, may help explain why children born to mothers who have had the virus can have smaller-than-average skulls and disproportionate facial features.\n\nZika has already been shown to attack foetal brain cells known as neural progenitor cells -- a type of stem cell that gives rise to various kinds of brain cells.\n\nThe death of these cells is what disrupts brain development and leads to microcephaly, the severe birth defect seen in babies whose mothers were infected with Zika during pregnancy.\n\nAmerican scientists who conducted this latest study by infecting human cells with Zika in the lab, found the virus can infect another type of cell known as cranial neural crest cells -- which give rise to skull bones and cartilage -- and cause them to secrete signaling molecules that alter their function.\n\nIn the lab, the increased levels of these molecules were enough to induce premature differentiation, migration, and death of human neural progenitor cells, the researchers said.\n\n\"In addition to direct effects of Zika virus on neural progenitors and their derivatives, this virus could affect brain development indirectly, through a signaling cross-talk between embryonic cell types,\" says Joanna Wysocka, a chemical and systems biologist at the Stanford University School of Medicine who co-led the study.\n\nShe added that neural crest cells may be just one example, and that the same mechanism may also be relevant to other tissues that come in contact with a foetus' developing brain during head formation and could be infected by Zika.\n\nThe Zika virus has spread to almost 60 countries and territories since the current outbreak was identified last year in Brazil, raising alarm over its ability to cause microcephaly as well as other neurological disorders in infants and adults. Brazil has been the country hardest hit so far, with more than 1800 reported cases of microcephaly.\n\nWysoka's team cautioned that their work did not provide direct proof that Zika virus infects cranial neural crest cells in live animals or humans. Follow-up research would also be needed to look for any evidence that the virus' effect on these cells would be enough to cause microcephaly, they said.\n\n[Byline: Kate Kelland; editing by Alison

ALERT, TRAVEL ADVICE\n************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Tue 30 Aug 2016 6:37 pm EDT\nSource: Reuters [edited]\nhttp://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-zika-singapore-idUSKCN1150HM\n\n\nConfirmed cases of Zika virus in Singapore rose to 82 on [Tue 30 Aug 2016], as the United States joined a growing list of countries warning pregnant women or those trying to get pregnant to avoid travel to the city-state.\n\nThe mosquitoborne Zika virus, which has caused explosive outbreaks in the Americas and the Caribbean since late last year [2015], poses a particular risk to pregnant women because it can cause microcephaly, a severe birth defect in which babies are born with abnormally small heads and underdeveloped brains.\n\nOn [Tue 30 Aug 2016], the United States warned pregnant women not to travel to Singapore, joining Australia, Taiwan, and South Korea.\n\nThe warnings followed news that Zika transmission appears to be occurring outside of the original cluster, with at least 5 of 26 new cases confirmed late on [Tue 30 Aug 2016] detected in the Aljunied area in the southeast of Singapore, the health ministry and National Environment Agency (NEA) said in a joint statement.\n\nSingapore has advised pregnant women to take a free Zika test if they showed any symptoms or if their partners tested positive. \"This is regardless of whether they have been to Zika-affected areas,\" health officials said in a statement.\n\nThe outbreak and advisories come as the tourism industry in one of the world's busiest travel hubs already faces weak global economic growth. Singapore's Tourism Board said it was premature to consider any impact on the sector, adding it remained a \"safe travel destination\".\n\nMore than 55 million people pass through Singapore's Changi airport every year. In the 1st half of this year [2016], tourism arrivals topped 8 million, around 1 million more than a year earlier [2015].\n\nSingapore reported its 1st case of locally-transmitted Zika at the weekend [27-28 Aug 2016], and the number of confirmed infections has risen steadily since then. At least 3 dozen patients have made a full recovery.\n\nNeighboring Malaysia and Indonesia have stepped up protective measures, introducing thermal scanners at airports and border checkpoints with the island state. Such measures, however, will only identify symptomatic cases of Zika, but only one in 5 people have symptoms of the virus, which include fever, rash, joint pain, and pink eye.\n\nSingapore residents responded to government calls to be vigilant and to take precautions against mosquito bites. Online retailer Lazada Singapore said sales of insect repellents jumped 5-fold in the past 3 days. FairPrice supermarkets and Watsons pharmacies said their sales of such products had doubled.\n\nMost of the early infections were among foreign workers, hundreds of thousands of whom, mainly from the Asian sub-continent, work on Singapore's construction sites and in the marine sector. The Singapore government has not said where the infected foreign workers are from. The foreign ministry directed queries to the health ministry, which did not respond to Reuters questions on the issue. The Ministry of Manpower also did not respond to a request for comment made outside working hours.\n\nThe High Commission of Bangladesh, which represents the largest community of foreign workers, said none of those infected were Bangladeshis, and the Thai foreign ministry said none were from Thailand. The embassies of China, India, Sri Lanka, and Myanmar said they had not been notified by Singapore whether their citizens were among those infected.\n\nAuthorities inspected thousands of homes in 7 parts of Singapore, including 5 foreign worker dormitories, spraying insecticide, and removing potential mosquito breeding habitats. The NEA has inspected about 5000 premises in and around the initial outbreak area, issuing 400 notices to owners of buildings they could not access. The NEA can force entry into those premises if needed.\n\nZika was 1st discovered in Uganda in 1947. It caused clusters of human infections from the 1960s to 1980s across Africa and Asia, according to the World Health Organization. The outbreak in the Americas was caused by a Zika strain from Asia, possibly carried to Brazil through travel to a sporting event. Many experts believe once infected, Zika produces lifelong immunity. \"Unfortunately, it is not clear the level of immunity that is currently in Asia,\" said Alessandro Vespignani of Northeastern University in Boston. WHO declared Zika a global health emergency because of its link with microcephaly. In Brazil, Zika has been linked to more than 1800 cases of microcephaly.\n\n[byline: Marius Zaharia]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-MBDS\n<promed-mbds@promedmail.org>\n\n[Zika virus infection has similar clinical signs to dengue, and may be misdiagnosed in areas where dengue is common. There is no cure for Zika virus disease. Treatment is focused on relieving the symptoms.

Singapore's Tourism Board said it was premature to consider any impact on the sector, adding it remained a \"safe travel destination\".\n\nMore than 55 million people pass through Singapore's Changi airport every year. In the 1st half of this year [2016], tourism arrivals topped 8 million, around 1 million more than a year earlier [2015].\n\nSingapore reported its 1st case of locally-transmitted Zika at the weekend [27-28 Aug 2016], and the number of confirmed infections has risen steadily since then. At least 3 dozen patients have made a full recovery.\n\nNeighboring Malaysia and Indonesia have stepped up protective measures, introducing thermal scanners at airports and border checkpoints with the island state. Such measures, however, will only identify symptomatic cases of Zika, but only one in 5 people have symptoms of the virus, which include fever, rash, joint pain, and pink eye.\n\nSingapore residents responded to government calls to be vigilant and to take precautions against mosquito bites. Online retailer Lazada Singapore said sales of insect repellents jumped 5-fold in the past 3 days. FairPrice supermarkets and Watsons pharmacies said their sales of such products had doubled.\n\nMost of the early infections were among foreign workers, hundreds of thousands of whom, mainly from the Asian sub-continent, work on Singapore's construction sites and in the marine sector. The Singapore government has not said where the infected foreign workers are from. The foreign ministry directed queries to the health ministry, which did not respond to Reuters questions on the issue. The Ministry of Manpower also did not respond to a request for comment made outside working hours.\n\nThe High Commission of Bangladesh, which represents the largest community of foreign workers, said none of those infected were Bangladeshis, and the Thai foreign ministry said none were from Thailand. The embassies of China, India, Sri Lanka, and Myanmar said they had not been notified by Singapore whether their citizens were among those infected.\n\nAuthorities inspected thousands of homes in 7 parts of Singapore, including 5 foreign worker dormitories, spraying insecticide, and removing potential mosquito breeding habitats. The NEA has inspected about 5000 premises in and around the initial outbreak area, issuing 400 notices to owners of buildings they could not access. The NEA can force entry into those premises if needed.\n\nZika was 1st discovered in Uganda in 1947. It caused clusters of human infections from the 1960s to 1980s across Africa and Asia, according to the World Health Organization. The outbreak in the Americas was caused by a Zika strain from Asia, possibly carried to Brazil through travel to a sporting event. Many experts believe once infected, Zika produces lifelong immunity. \"Unfortunately, it is not clear the level of immunity that is currently in Asia,\" said Alessandro Vespignani of Northeastern University in Boston. WHO declared Zika a global health emergency because of its link with microcephaly. In Brazil, Zika has been linked to more than 1800 cases of microcephaly.\n\n[byline: Marius Zaharia]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-MBDS\n<promed-mbds@promedmail.org>\n\n[Zika virus infection has similar clinical signs to dengue, and may be misdiagnosed in areas where dengue is common.

Singapore's Tourism Board said it was premature to consider any impact on the sector, adding it remained a \"safe travel destination\".\n\nMore than 55 million people pass through Singapore's Changi airport every year. In the 1st half of this year [2016], tourism arrivals topped 8 million, around 1 million more than a year earlier [2015].\n\nSingapore reported its 1st case of locally-transmitted Zika at the weekend [27-28 Aug 2016], and the number of confirmed infections has risen steadily since then. At least 3 dozen patients have made a full recovery.\n\nNeighboring Malaysia and Indonesia have stepped up protective measures, introducing thermal scanners at airports and border checkpoints with the island state. Such measures, however, will only identify symptomatic cases of Zika, but only one in 5 people have symptoms of the virus, which include fever, rash, joint pain, and pink eye.\n\nSingapore residents responded to government calls to be vigilant and to take precautions against mosquito bites. Online retailer Lazada Singapore said sales of insect repellents jumped 5-fold in the past 3 days. FairPrice supermarkets and Watsons pharmacies said their sales of such products had doubled.\n\nMost of the early infections were among foreign workers, hundreds of thousands of whom, mainly from the Asian sub-continent, work on Singapore's construction sites and in the marine sector. The Singapore government has not said where the infected foreign workers are from. The foreign ministry directed queries to the health ministry, which did not respond to Reuters questions on the issue. The Ministry of Manpower also did not respond to a request for comment made outside working hours.\n\nThe High Commission of Bangladesh, which represents the largest community of foreign workers, said none of those infected were Bangladeshis, and the Thai foreign ministry said none were from Thailand. The embassies of China, India, Sri Lanka, and Myanmar said they had not been notified by Singapore whether their citizens were among those infected.\n\nAuthorities inspected thousands of homes in 7 parts of Singapore, including 5 foreign worker dormitories, spraying insecticide, and removing potential mosquito breeding habitats. The NEA has inspected about 5000 premises in and around the initial outbreak area, issuing 400 notices to owners of buildings they could not access. The NEA can force entry into those premises if needed.\n\nZika was 1st discovered in Uganda in 1947.

Singapore's Tourism Board said it was premature to consider any impact on the sector, adding it remained a \"safe travel destination\".\n\nMore than 55 million people pass through Singapore's Changi airport every year. In the 1st half of this year [2016], tourism arrivals topped 8 million, around 1 million more than a year earlier [2015].\n\nSingapore reported its 1st case of locally-transmitted Zika at the weekend [27-28 Aug 2016], and the number of confirmed infections has risen steadily since then. At least 3 dozen patients have made a full recovery.\n\nNeighboring Malaysia and Indonesia have stepped up protective measures, introducing thermal scanners at airports and border checkpoints with the island state. Such measures, however, will only identify symptomatic cases of Zika, but only one in 5 people have symptoms of the virus, which include fever, rash, joint pain, and pink eye.\n\nSingapore residents responded to government calls to be vigilant and to take precautions against mosquito bites. Online retailer Lazada Singapore said sales of insect repellents jumped 5-fold in the past 3 days. FairPrice supermarkets and Watsons pharmacies said their sales of such products had doubled.\n\nMost of the early infections were among foreign workers, hundreds of thousands of whom, mainly from the Asian sub-continent, work on Singapore's construction sites and in the marine sector. The Singapore government has not said where the infected foreign workers are from. The foreign ministry directed queries to the health ministry, which did not respond to Reuters questions on the issue. The Ministry of Manpower also did not respond to a request for comment made outside working hours.\n\nThe High Commission of Bangladesh, which represents the largest community of foreign workers, said none of those infected were Bangladeshis, and the Thai foreign ministry said none were from Thailand.

Health officials reported they are conducting an epidemiological investigation in collaboration with the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nNo details were provided regarding the potential mode of transmission. Zika is primarily transmitted by the bite of infected _Aedes aegypti_ and _Aedes albopictus_ mosquitoes, though the CDC has also reported cases of the virus spreading through blood transfusions, from pregnant mothers to their newborn children, and by sexual transmission.\n\nFlorida health officials reported 7 new cases of Zika infection on Tue [19 Jul 2016], all acquired by people while traveling outside the country. The cases included 3 in Broward County, 3 in Orange County and 1 in Miami-Dade. Miami-Dade has the state's largest number of Zika [virus] infections, with 88 people having contracted the virus this year.\n\nZika can be difficult to diagnose in part because only 1 in 5 infected people show symptoms, which include fever, joint pain, rash and red eyes lasting 7-10 days.\n\nWhile the CDC has not confirmed local transmission of Zika anywhere in the continental United States, evidence emerged this week that the virus is spreading in ways that are still a mystery to scientists. On Mon [18 Jul 2016], the CDC announced that epidemiologists are investigating a case in Utah involving a family member of an elderly man who contracted Zika while traveling outside the country and later died from complications of the disease after returning home. CDC officials reported that epidemiologists are interviewing and conducting blood tests of the dead man's family members and healthcare workers who may have had contact with the man, who died in Jun [2016].\n\nHealth officials are also trapping mosquitoes in Utah and testing them for the virus to assess the potential for local transmission. However, the 2 species known to transmit Zika are not known to be present in Utah.\n\nFlorida health officials said Zika prevention kits and repellent will be available for pick up in Miami-Dade and distributed in the area under investigation, which was not disclosed. Zika kits are intended for pregnant women, the health department said. County mosquito control has already conducted spraying and other prevention efforts in the neighborhood being investigated.\n\nPregnant women and their children are considered to be at greatest risk from the disease. Researchers have concluded that prenatal Zika infection can cause microcephaly and other brain disorders. According to the health department, there are 43 pregnant women in Florida who have contracted the virus this year.\n\n[Byline: Daniel Chang]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n[Presumably, a viremic individual returned to Florida and provided an infectious blood meal for a vector mosquito that subsequently infected a local person. This is not surprising. In the past, there have been locally transmitted dengue viruses in Florida. The same vector mosquito transmits both viruses. Additional locally acquired cases where _Aedes aegypti_ is present in the southern USA can be expected during this transmission season.\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map showing the location of Florida can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/6998 and map of Florida sowing the location of Miami-Dade county at the southern tip of the state can be accessed at http://geology.com/county-map/florida.shtml. - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[2] Utah: local transmission\nDate: Mon 18 Jul 2016\nSource: CDC Media Statement [edited]\nhttp://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2016/s0718-zika-utah-investigation.html\n\n\nCDC [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] is assisting in the investigation of a case of Zika in a Utah resident who is a family contact of the elderly Utah resident who died in late Jun [2016]. The deceased patient had traveled to an area with Zika and lab tests showed he had uniquely high amounts of virus -- more than 100 000 times higher than seen in other samples of infected people -- in his blood. Laboratories in Utah and at the CDC reported evidence of Zika infection in both Utah residents.\n\nState and local public health disease control specialists, along with CDC, are investigating how the 2nd resident became infected. The investigation includes additional interviews with and laboratory testing of family members and health care workers who may have had contact with the person who died and trapping mosquitoes and assessing the risk of local spread by mosquitoes.\n\nA CDC Emergency Response Team (CERT) is in Utah at the request of the Utah Department of Health. The team includes experts in infection control, virology, mosquito control, disease investigation, and health communications. \"The new case in Utah is a surprise, showing that we still have more to learn about Zika,\" said Erin Staples, MD, PhD, CDC's Medical Epidemiologist on the ground in Utah. \"Fortunately, the patient recovered quickly, and from what we have seen with more than 1300 travel-associated cases of Zika in the continental United States and Hawaii, non-sexual spread from one person to another does not appear to be common.\"\n\nAs of 13 Jul 2016, 1306 cases of Zika have been reported in the continental United States and Hawaii; none of these have been the result of local spread by mosquitoes. These cases include 14 believed to be the result of sexual transmission and 1 that was the result of a laboratory exposure.\n\nSince early 2016, CDC has worked with state, local, and territorial public health officials to protect pregnant women from Zika infection, through these activities:\n\n- Alerts to pregnant women to avoid travel to an area with active Zika transmission, to women in these areas to take steps to prevent mosquito bites, and to partners of pregnant women to use a condom to prevent sexual transmission during pregnancy.\n- Development and distribution of PCR and IgM testing kits to confirm Zika virus infection.\n- Establishment of CDC Emergency Response Teams to rapidly deploy to assist with Zika-related preparedness and response activities in the United States.\n- Deployment of experts to assist in enhancement of mosquito surveillance and testing.\n- Collaboration with FDA, blood collection centers, and other entities in the public and private sectors on enhancement of surveillance of blood donations.\n- Guidance to prevent sexual transmission, particularly to women who are pregnant.\n- Guidance for clinicians on the care of pregnant women who may have been exposed to Zika [virus].\n- Studies in collaboration with Brazil, Colombia, and other countries to better understand the link between Zika infection and birth defects, including microcephaly.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n[The obvious question is -- how did the caretaker become infected. Mosquitoes are unlikely as the source of the virus in this situation because no competent mosquito species is believed to be present in Utah. The source of the virus must have been the elderly man who subsequently died. He is reported to have had a very high viremia. Presumably there were substantial amounts of virus in urine and saliva as well. The importance of virus in saliva or urine as a source of transmissible virus has not been established.

Health officials reported they are conducting an epidemiological investigation in collaboration with the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nNo details were provided regarding the potential mode of transmission. Zika is primarily transmitted by the bite of infected _Aedes aegypti_ and _Aedes albopictus_ mosquitoes, though the CDC has also reported cases of the virus spreading through blood transfusions, from pregnant mothers to their newborn children, and by sexual transmission.\n\nFlorida health officials reported 7 new cases of Zika infection on Tue [19 Jul 2016], all acquired by people while traveling outside the country. The cases included 3 in Broward County, 3 in Orange County and 1 in Miami-Dade. Miami-Dade has the state's largest number of Zika [virus] infections, with 88 people having contracted the virus this year.\n\nZika can be difficult to diagnose in part because only 1 in 5 infected people show symptoms, which include fever, joint pain, rash and red eyes lasting 7-10 days.\n\nWhile the CDC has not confirmed local transmission of Zika anywhere in the continental United States, evidence emerged this week that the virus is spreading in ways that are still a mystery to scientists. On Mon [18 Jul 2016], the CDC announced that epidemiologists are investigating a case in Utah involving a family member of an elderly man who contracted Zika while traveling outside the country and later died from complications of the disease after returning home. CDC officials reported that epidemiologists are interviewing and conducting blood tests of the dead man's family members and healthcare workers who may have had contact with the man, who died in Jun [2016].\n\nHealth officials are also trapping mosquitoes in Utah and testing them for the virus to assess the potential for local transmission. However, the 2 species known to transmit Zika are not known to be present in Utah.\n\nFlorida health officials said Zika prevention kits and repellent will be available for pick up in Miami-Dade and distributed in the area under investigation, which was not disclosed. Zika kits are intended for pregnant women, the health department said. County mosquito control has already conducted spraying and other prevention efforts in the neighborhood being investigated.\n\nPregnant women and their children are considered to be at greatest risk from the disease. Researchers have concluded that prenatal Zika infection can cause microcephaly and other brain disorders.

The deceased patient had traveled to an area with Zika and lab tests showed he had uniquely high amounts of virus -- more than 100 000 times higher than seen in other samples of infected people -- in his blood. Laboratories in Utah and at the CDC reported evidence of Zika infection in both Utah residents.\n\nState and local public health disease control specialists, along with CDC, are investigating how the 2nd resident became infected. The investigation includes additional interviews with and laboratory testing of family members and health care workers who may have had contact with the person who died and trapping mosquitoes and assessing the risk of local spread by mosquitoes.\n\nA CDC Emergency Response Team (CERT) is in Utah at the request of the Utah Department of Health. The team includes experts in infection control, virology, mosquito control, disease investigation, and health communications. \"The new case in Utah is a surprise, showing that we still have more to learn about Zika,\" said Erin Staples, MD, PhD, CDC's Medical Epidemiologist on the ground in Utah. \"Fortunately, the patient recovered quickly, and from what we have seen with more than 1300 travel-associated cases of Zika in the continental United States and Hawaii, non-sexual spread from one person to another does not appear to be common.\"\n\nAs of 13 Jul 2016, 1306 cases of Zika have been reported in the continental United States and Hawaii; none of these have been the result of local spread by mosquitoes. These cases include 14 believed to be the result of sexual transmission and 1 that was the result of a laboratory exposure.\n\nSince early 2016, CDC has worked with state, local, and territorial public health officials to protect pregnant women from Zika infection, through these activities:\n\n- Alerts to pregnant women to avoid travel to an area with active Zika transmission, to women in these areas to take steps to prevent mosquito bites, and to partners of pregnant women to use a condom to prevent sexual transmission during pregnancy.\n- Development and distribution of PCR and IgM testing kits to confirm Zika virus infection.\n- Establishment of CDC Emergency Response Teams to rapidly deploy to assist with Zika-related preparedness and response activities in the United States.\n- Deployment of experts to assist in enhancement of mosquito surveillance and testing.\n- Collaboration with FDA, blood collection centers, and other entities in the public and private sectors on enhancement of surveillance of blood donations.\n- Guidance to prevent sexual transmission, particularly to women who are pregnant.\n- Guidance for clinicians on the care of pregnant women who may have been exposed to Zika [virus].\n- Studies in collaboration with Brazil, Colombia, and other countries to better understand the link between Zika infection and birth defects, including microcephaly.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n[The obvious question is -- how did the caretaker become infected.

Health officials reported they are conducting an epidemiological investigation in collaboration with the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nNo details were provided regarding the potential mode of transmission. Zika is primarily transmitted by the bite of infected _Aedes aegypti_ and _Aedes albopictus_ mosquitoes, though the CDC has also reported cases of the virus spreading through blood transfusions, from pregnant mothers to their newborn children, and by sexual transmission.\n\nFlorida health officials reported 7 new cases of Zika infection on Tue [19 Jul 2016], all acquired by people while traveling outside the country. The cases included 3 in Broward County, 3 in Orange County and 1 in Miami-Dade. Miami-Dade has the state's largest number of Zika [virus] infections, with 88 people having contracted the virus this year.\n\nZika can be difficult to diagnose in part because only 1 in 5 infected people show symptoms, which include fever, joint pain, rash and red eyes lasting 7-10 days.\n\nWhile the CDC has not confirmed local transmission of Zika anywhere in the continental United States, evidence emerged this week that the virus is spreading in ways that are still a mystery to scientists. On Mon [18 Jul 2016], the CDC announced that epidemiologists are investigating a case in Utah involving a family member of an elderly man who contracted Zika while traveling outside the country and later died from complications of the disease after returning home. CDC officials reported that epidemiologists are interviewing and conducting blood tests of the dead man's family members and healthcare workers who may have had contact with the man, who died in Jun [2016].\n\nHealth officials are also trapping mosquitoes in Utah and testing them for the virus to assess the potential for local transmission. However, the 2 species known to transmit Zika are not known to be present in Utah.\n\nFlorida health officials said Zika prevention kits and repellent will be available for pick up in Miami-Dade and distributed in the area under investigation, which was not disclosed. Zika kits are intended for pregnant women, the health department said. County mosquito control has already conducted spraying and other prevention efforts in the neighborhood being investigated.\n\nPregnant women and their children are considered to be at greatest risk from the disease. Researchers have concluded that prenatal Zika infection can cause microcephaly and other brain disorders.

The deceased patient had traveled to an area with Zika and lab tests showed he had uniquely high amounts of virus -- more than 100 000 times higher than seen in other samples of infected people -- in his blood. Laboratories in Utah and at the CDC reported evidence of Zika infection in both Utah residents.\n\nState and local public health disease control specialists, along with CDC, are investigating how the 2nd resident became infected. The investigation includes additional interviews with and laboratory testing of family members and health care workers who may have had contact with the person who died and trapping mosquitoes and assessing the risk of local spread by mosquitoes.\n\nA CDC Emergency Response Team (CERT) is in Utah at the request of the Utah Department of Health. The team includes experts in infection control, virology, mosquito control, disease investigation, and health communications. \"The new case in Utah is a surprise, showing that we still have more to learn about Zika,\" said Erin Staples, MD, PhD, CDC's Medical Epidemiologist on the ground in Utah. \"Fortunately, the patient recovered quickly, and from what we have seen with more than 1300 travel-associated cases of Zika in the continental United States and Hawaii, non-sexual spread from one person to another does not appear to be common.\"\n\nAs of 13 Jul 2016, 1306 cases of Zika have been reported in the continental United States and Hawaii; none of these have been the result of local spread by mosquitoes. These cases include 14 believed to be the result of sexual transmission and 1 that was the result of a laboratory exposure.\n\nSince early 2016, CDC has worked with state, local, and territorial public health officials to protect pregnant women from Zika infection, through these activities:\n\n- Alerts to pregnant women to avoid travel to an area with active Zika transmission, to women in these areas to take steps to prevent mosquito bites, and to partners of pregnant women to use a condom to prevent sexual transmission during pregnancy.\n- Development and distribution of PCR and IgM testing kits to confirm Zika virus infection.\n- Establishment of CDC Emergency Response Teams to rapidly deploy to assist with Zika-related preparedness and response activities in the United States.\n- Deployment of experts to assist in enhancement of mosquito surveillance and testing.\n- Collaboration with FDA, blood collection centers, and other entities in the public and private sectors on enhancement of surveillance of blood donations.\n- Guidance to prevent sexual transmission, particularly to women who are pregnant.\n- Guidance for clinicians on the care of pregnant women who may have been exposed to Zika [virus].\n- Studies in collaboration with Brazil, Colombia, and other countries to better understand the link between Zika infection and birth defects, including microcephaly.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n[The obvious question is -- how did the caretaker become infected.

Health officials reported they are conducting an epidemiological investigation in collaboration with the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nNo details were provided regarding the potential mode of transmission. Zika is primarily transmitted by the bite of infected _Aedes aegypti_ and _Aedes albopictus_ mosquitoes, though the CDC has also reported cases of the virus spreading through blood transfusions, from pregnant mothers to their newborn children, and by sexual transmission.\n\nFlorida health officials reported 7 new cases of Zika infection on Tue [19 Jul 2016], all acquired by people while traveling outside the country. The cases included 3 in Broward County, 3 in Orange County and 1 in Miami-Dade. Miami-Dade has the state's largest number of Zika [virus] infections, with 88 people having contracted the virus this year.\n\nZika can be difficult to diagnose in part because only 1 in 5 infected people show symptoms, which include fever, joint pain, rash and red eyes lasting 7-10 days.\n\nWhile the CDC has not confirmed local transmission of Zika anywhere in the continental United States, evidence emerged this week that the virus is spreading in ways that are still a mystery to scientists. On Mon [18 Jul 2016], the CDC announced that epidemiologists are investigating a case in Utah involving a family member of an elderly man who contracted Zika while traveling outside the country and later died from complications of the disease after returning home. CDC officials reported that epidemiologists are interviewing and conducting blood tests of the dead man's family members and healthcare workers who may have had contact with the man, who died in Jun [2016].\n\nHealth officials are also trapping mosquitoes in Utah and testing them for the virus to assess the potential for local transmission. However, the 2 species known to transmit Zika are not known to be present in Utah.\n\nFlorida health officials said Zika prevention kits and repellent will be available for pick up in Miami-Dade and distributed in the area under investigation, which was not disclosed. Zika kits are intended for pregnant women, the health department said. County mosquito control has already conducted spraying and other prevention efforts in the neighborhood being investigated.\n\nPregnant women and their children are considered to be at greatest risk from the disease. Researchers have concluded that prenatal Zika infection can cause microcephaly and other brain disorders.

The deceased patient had traveled to an area with Zika and lab tests showed he had uniquely high amounts of virus -- more than 100 000 times higher than seen in other samples of infected people -- in his blood. Laboratories in Utah and at the CDC reported evidence of Zika infection in both Utah residents.\n\nState and local public health disease control specialists, along with CDC, are investigating how the 2nd resident became infected. The investigation includes additional interviews with and laboratory testing of family members and health care workers who may have had contact with the person who died and trapping mosquitoes and assessing the risk of local spread by mosquitoes.\n\nA CDC Emergency Response Team (CERT) is in Utah at the request of the Utah Department of Health. The team includes experts in infection control, virology, mosquito control, disease investigation, and health communications. \"The new case in Utah is a surprise, showing that we still have more to learn about Zika,\" said Erin Staples, MD, PhD, CDC's Medical Epidemiologist on the ground in Utah. \"Fortunately, the patient recovered quickly, and from what we have seen with more than 1300 travel-associated cases of Zika in the continental United States and Hawaii, non-sexual spread from one person to another does not appear to be common.\"\n\nAs of 13 Jul 2016, 1306 cases of Zika have been reported in the continental United States and Hawaii; none of these have been the result of local spread by mosquitoes. These cases include 14 believed to be the result of sexual transmission and 1 that was the result of a laboratory exposure.\n\nSince early 2016, CDC has worked with state, local, and territorial public health officials to protect pregnant women from Zika infection, through these activities:\n\n- Alerts to pregnant women to avoid travel to an area with active Zika transmission, to women in these areas to take steps to prevent mosquito bites, and to partners of pregnant women to use a condom to prevent sexual transmission during pregnancy.\n- Development and distribution of PCR and IgM testing kits to confirm Zika virus infection.\n- Establishment of CDC Emergency Response Teams to rapidly deploy to assist with Zika-related preparedness and response activities in the United States.\n- Deployment of experts to assist in enhancement of mosquito surveillance and testing.\n- Collaboration with FDA, blood collection centers, and other entities in the public and private sectors on enhancement of surveillance of blood donations.\n- Guidance to prevent sexual transmission, particularly to women who are pregnant.\n- Guidance for clinicians on the care of pregnant women who may have been exposed to Zika [virus].\n- Studies in collaboration with Brazil, Colombia, and other countries to better understand the link between Zika infection and birth defects, including microcephaly.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n[The obvious question is -- how did the caretaker become infected.

Health officials reported they are conducting an epidemiological investigation in collaboration with the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nNo details were provided regarding the potential mode of transmission. Zika is primarily transmitted by the bite of infected _Aedes aegypti_ and _Aedes albopictus_ mosquitoes, though the CDC has also reported cases of the virus spreading through blood transfusions, from pregnant mothers to their newborn children, and by sexual transmission.\n\nFlorida health officials reported 7 new cases of Zika infection on Tue [19 Jul 2016], all acquired by people while traveling outside the country. The cases included 3 in Broward County, 3 in Orange County and 1 in Miami-Dade. Miami-Dade has the state's largest number of Zika [virus] infections, with 88 people having contracted the virus this year.\n\nZika can be difficult to diagnose in part because only 1 in 5 infected people show symptoms, which include fever, joint pain, rash and red eyes lasting 7-10 days.\n\nWhile the CDC has not confirmed local transmission of Zika anywhere in the continental United States, evidence emerged this week that the virus is spreading in ways that are still a mystery to scientists. On Mon [18 Jul 2016], the CDC announced that epidemiologists are investigating a case in Utah involving a family member of an elderly man who contracted Zika while traveling outside the country and later died from complications of the disease after returning home. CDC officials reported that epidemiologists are interviewing and conducting blood tests of the dead man's family members and healthcare workers who may have had contact with the man, who died in Jun [2016].\n\nHealth officials are also trapping mosquitoes in Utah and testing them for the virus to assess the potential for local transmission. However, the 2 species known to transmit Zika are not known to be present in Utah.\n\nFlorida health officials said Zika prevention kits and repellent will be available for pick up in Miami-Dade and distributed in the area under investigation, which was not disclosed. Zika kits are intended for pregnant women, the health department said. County mosquito control has already conducted spraying and other prevention efforts in the neighborhood being investigated.\n\nPregnant women and their children are considered to be at greatest risk from the disease. Researchers have concluded that prenatal Zika infection can cause microcephaly and other brain disorders. According to the health department, there are 43 pregnant women in Florida who have contracted the virus this year.\n\n[Byline: Daniel Chang]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n[Presumably, a viremic individual returned to Florida and provided an infectious blood meal for a vector mosquito that subsequently infected a local person. This is not surprising. In the past, there have been locally transmitted dengue viruses in Florida. The same vector mosquito transmits both viruses. Additional locally acquired cases where _Aedes aegypti_ is present in the southern USA can be expected during this transmission season.\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map showing the location of Florida can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/6998 and map of Florida sowing the location of Miami-Dade county at the southern tip of the state can be accessed at http://geology.com/county-map/florida.shtml. - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[2] Utah: local transmission\nDate: Mon 18 Jul 2016\nSource: CDC Media Statement [edited]\nhttp://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2016/s0718-zika-utah-investigation.html\n\n\nCDC [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] is assisting in the investigation of a case of Zika in a Utah resident who is a family contact of the elderly Utah resident who died in late Jun [2016]. The deceased patient had traveled to an area with Zika and lab tests showed he had uniquely high amounts of virus -- more than 100 000 times higher than seen in other samples of infected people -- in his blood. Laboratories in Utah and at the CDC reported evidence of Zika infection in both Utah residents.\n\nState and local public health disease control specialists, along with CDC, are investigating how the 2nd resident became infected. The investigation includes additional interviews with and laboratory testing of family members and health care workers who may have had contact with the person who died and trapping mosquitoes and assessing the risk of local spread by mosquitoes.\n\nA CDC Emergency Response Team (CERT) is in Utah at the request of the Utah Department of Health. The team includes experts in infection control, virology, mosquito control, disease investigation, and health communications. \"The new case in Utah is a surprise, showing that we still have more to learn about Zika,\" said Erin Staples, MD, PhD, CDC's Medical Epidemiologist on the ground in Utah. \"Fortunately, the patient recovered quickly, and from what we have seen with more than 1300 travel-associated cases of Zika in the continental United States and Hawaii, non-sexual spread from one person to another does not appear to be common.\"\n\nAs of 13 Jul 2016, 1306 cases of Zika have been reported in the continental United States and Hawaii; none of these have been the result of local spread by mosquitoes. These cases include 14 believed to be the result of sexual transmission and 1 that was the result of a laboratory exposure.\n\nSince early 2016, CDC has worked with state, local, and territorial public health officials to protect pregnant women from Zika infection, through these activities:\n\n- Alerts to pregnant women to avoid travel to an area with active Zika transmission, to women in these areas to take steps to prevent mosquito bites, and to partners of pregnant women to use a condom to prevent sexual transmission during pregnancy.\n- Development and distribution of PCR and IgM testing kits to confirm Zika virus infection.\n- Establishment of CDC Emergency Response Teams to rapidly deploy to assist with Zika-related preparedness and response activities in the United States.\n- Deployment of experts to assist in enhancement of mosquito surveillance and testing.\n- Collaboration with FDA, blood collection centers, and other entities in the public and private sectors on enhancement of surveillance of blood donations.\n- Guidance to prevent sexual transmission, particularly to women who are pregnant.\n- Guidance for clinicians on the care of pregnant women who may have been exposed to Zika [virus].\n- Studies in collaboration with Brazil, Colombia, and other countries to better understand the link between Zika infection and birth defects, including microcephaly.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n[The obvious question is -- how did the caretaker become infected. Mosquitoes are unlikely as the source of the virus in this situation because no competent mosquito species is believed to be present in Utah. The source of the virus must have been the elderly man who subsequently died. He is reported to have had a very high viremia. Presumably there were substantial amounts of virus in urine and saliva as well. The importance of virus in saliva or urine as a source of transmissible virus has not been established. Clearly, this is an unusual case. With over 1300 Zika virus infected individuals reported in the USA, the only locally acquired cases were sexually transmitted, until now.

Since the last Pan American Health Organization/World Health Organization (PAHO/WHO) Zika epidemiological update on 12 May 2016, Argentina has confirmed vectorborne autochthonous transmission of Zika virus.\n\nAs mentioned in previous Zika epidemiological updates, trends observed in the Region of the Americas vary depending on the timing of the epidemic onset and timing of the seasonal period of mosquitoborne diseases. In general, countries and territories where the epidemic started later have exhibited upward trends.\n\nColombia\nFollowing Brazil, Colombia was the 2nd country to report circulation of Zika virus in the Americas in 2015. Cases were initially reported in the Department of Bolivar and then spread to the rest of the country; as of epidemiological week (EW) 18 of 2016, 747 municipalities in the country have reported cases. Between EW 32 of 2015 and to EW 18 of 2016, a bimodal epidemic curve of Zika virus disease cases (suspected and confirmed) was observed. The peaks of the cases occurred in EW 5 of 2016 (6309 cases) and EW 13, 2016 (3609 cases) and have since demonstrated a downward trend.\n\nZika virus disease in pregnant women\nDetection of Zika virus disease in pregnant women is being heightened in countries in the region due to risk of congenital syndrome associated with Zika virus infection. There are 21 countries and territories in the Americas reporting confirmed and suspected cases of Zika virus disease in pregnant women; this number remains the same since the last PAHO/WHO Zika epidemiological update on 12 May 2016.\n\nCountries and territories reporting Zika virus disease in pregnant women:\nBarbados, Dominican Republic, Honduras, Puerto Rico, Brazil, Ecuador, Martinique Saint Martin, Bolivia, El Salvador, Mexico, Venezuela, Colombia, French Guiana, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Guadeloupe, Panama, Dominica, Guatemala, Paraguay.\n\nAcute flaccid paralysis trends in Bolivia\nFollowing the description of historical trends in increasing reports of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) in children under 15 years of age, as seen with Colombia, Ecuador, Guatemala, and Venezuela, the current situation in Bolivia is highlighted below.\n\nCompared to 2015, a slight increase in reported AFP is noted in Bolivia for 2016 as of EW 18. If the notifications continue at the same rate in 2016, a bigger increase in comparison to 2015 can be expected by the end of the year. While AFP is the manifestation of a wide spectrum of diseases, this situation highlights the importance for countries and territories with Zika virus circulation to analyze the trends in reports of AFP and investigate any unusual increase of cases.\n\nOf note, Bolivia, has not reported an increase of GBS cases to date.\n\nHighlighted below are the surveillance results of pregnant women with Zika virus disease in Ecuador and Panama.\n\nEcuador\nBetween EW 52 of 2015 and EW 17 of 2016, Zika virus disease has been laboratory confirmed in 8 pregnant women in Ecuador. Of these women, 4 are in the 2nd trimester of their pregnancy, and 2 are in the 3rd trimester. To date, no occurrences of congenital syndrome associated with Zika virus disease have been registered.\n\nPanama\nSince the beginning of the outbreak in Panama in EW 48 of 2015 until EW 18 of 2016, 31 pregnant women with suspected Zika virus disease have been detected; of those, 16 were laboratory confirmed, and 15 were negative for Zika virus.\n\nAs of EW 18 of 2016, Panama has reported 3 cases of laboratory confirmed congenital syndrome associated with Zika virus infection. The 3 mothers were asymptomatic, with one additional case of fetal death at 32 gestational weeks, all had positive laboratory samples for Zika virus.\n\nCongenital syndrome associated with Zika virus infection\nCountries and territories in the Americas with reported congenital syndrome associated with Zika virus infection:\nBrazil 1384 cases\nColombia 7 cases\nMartinique 3 cases\nPanama 4 cases\nPuerto Rico 1 case\nUnited States 2\n\nBrazil\nAccording to the Ministry of Health of Brazil, between 22 Oct 2015 and 14 May 2016, a total of 7534 suspected cases of microcephaly and other congenital malformation of the central nervous system (CNS) have been reported as per Brazil's Surveillance and Response protocol. Of these, the Brazil Ministry of Health confirmed 1384 cases of microcephaly by clinical, radiological and/or laboratory methods (207 have been confirmed by laboratory criteria). Out of the total reported cases, 2818 cases were discarded as being due to non-infectious causes or not fitting the case definition, and 3332 remain under investigation. The confirmed cases occurred in 499 municipalities, located in 26 out of 27 Federal Units.\n\nBetween EW 3 and EW 19 of 2016, the greatest number of microcephaly cases were confirmed in EW 4 (134 cases). During the same period, the range of cases investigated (confirmed and discarded) were between 80 and 381 (EW 12 and 4, respectively).\n\nGuillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS) and other neurological disorders\nTo date, 7 countries in the region have reported an increase in cases of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS) with at least one case laboratory confirmed for Zika virus. Paraguay continues to report an increase in GBS cases, none of which have laboratory results confirming Zika virus infection; 5 other countries and territories have not recorded increases but identified Zika virus-associated cases of GBS.\n\nIncrease in GBS plus Zika virus lab confirmation in at least one case of GBS\nBrazil, Colombia, Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Honduras, Suriname, Venezuela\n\nZika virus lab confirmation in at least one case of GBS\nFrench Guiana, Haiti, Panama, Puerto Rico, Martinique\n\nIncrease in GBS with no Zika virus lab confirmation in any of the cases\nParaguay\n\nTrend of neurological syndromes in Colombia\nSince 15 Dec 2015 until EW 18 of 2016, there were 517 cases of neurological syndromes reported in Colombia with history of febrile illness consistent with Zika virus infection. Of the total number of neurological syndromes, 65 per cent (335 cases) correspond to GBS. The epidemic curve of neurological syndromes shows a similar distribution to the Zika virus disease cases even though the neurological syndromes began 10 epidemiological weeks later and an elevation 2 weeks prior to the peak of Zika virus disease cases which occurred in EW 5 of 2016.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[2] Cases in various countries:\nAmericas\n\n[Maps showing the location of the affected islands and countries in the Americas mentioned below can be accessed at\nhttp://healthmap.org/promed/p/35574;\nNorth America at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/106;\nCentral America http://healthmap.org/promed/p/39455;\nCaribbean http://www.mapsofworld.com/caribbean-islands/ and\nSouth America at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/6186. - Mod.TY]\n\nCentral America\n---\nBelize. 16 May 2016.

The patient, in her 30s, was diagnosed with Zika virus infection using a ZIKV specific real-time RT-PCR1. The RT-PCR ZIKV positive serum sample was negative for flavivirus serology. A urine sample collected 4 days following the serum sample was also ZIKV RT-PCR positive. Several attempts to isolate virus from both the serum and urine were made using both cell culture (_Aedes albopictus_ C6/36 cells and African green monkey Vero cells) and suckling mice. A ZIKV isolate was recovered from the serum sample after one passage in suckling mouse brains 11 days post inoculation. This is the 1st known report of successful isolation of ZIKV from a human clinical sample in Australia. The ZIKV isolate from Tonga 2016 belongs to the Asian lineage.\n\nReference\nPyke AT, et al.

Public health officials are gathering data on the health consequences of the infection, including the rate at which fetuses develop abnormally shrunken heads and brain damage, a birth defect called microcephaly.\n\nAlso on Friday [20 May 2016], the World Health Organization confirmed that the strain of Zika virus in Cape Verde, just off the western coast of Africa, is the same strain that is spreading in Brazil. Almost 200 pregnant women in Cape Verde have been infected, and the virus has been blamed for 3 cases of microcephaly there.\n\nThe rising numbers of pregnant American women testing positive -- Friday's [20 May 2016] figure is more than double the previous count of 113 -- reflect a new case definition used by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention rather than a surge in cases, according to Dr Margaret Honein, the chief of the agency's birth defects division.\n\nNo cases transmitted by mosquito have yet been reported in the 50 states. The number of infected pregnant women in this country began rising dramatically in February [2016], probably reflecting the spread of the Zika virus from Brazil to more countries visited by Americans.\n\nMost of the 279 women are still pregnant, Dr Honein said, and fewer than a dozen have experienced \"adverse outcomes,\" such as stillbirths, microcephaly or other congenital problems. A \"relatively small number\" of the infections clearly resulted from sexual transmission rather than mosquito bites, she added. But in most cases, it was difficult to determine how the women became infected because they had lived in or had traveled to areas where mosquitoes carrying the virus were biting.\n\n[byline: Donald G McNeil, Jr]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[This prospective monitoring is very useful to come up with a more precise estimate of occurrences of fetal malformations in women who were infected with Zika virus during pregnancy. One hopes that the monitoring can continue, as the number of infected pregnant women is likely to increase during the summer travel season, perhaps with additional cases should local transmission of the virus in the USA occur during the upcoming mosquito transmission season.\n\nThe details of the study above, entitled \"Possible Zika virus infection among pregnant women -- United States and Territories, May 2016\", appeared in the 20 May 2016 issue of CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/65/wr/mm6520e1.htm?s_cid=mm6520e1_w). - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[4] Microcephaly studies in mice, monkeys\nDate: Wed 11 May 2016\nSource: Science [edited]\nhttp://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/05/zika-causes-microcephaly-mice\n\n\nBy far the most alarming feature of the Zika virus now marching across South America and the Caribbean is its threat to fetuses. Last month [April 2016], the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention declared that \"a causal relationship\" exists between the virus and brain abnormalities in newborns, most noticeably a small head, known as microcephaly. But just how a mother's infection harms the fetus, and how to prevent the damage, is uncertain.\n\nNew animal models are now pointing to answers. Pregnant monkeys are showing hints of fetal damage. But the most dramatic results come from mice. Mouse studies published this week in Cell and its sister journal Cell Stem Cell and in Nature show precisely how the virus slows fetal growth, damages the brain, and leads to miscarriage. The 2 of them also prove for the 1st time in an animal model that Zika virus can cause microcephaly in fetuses.\n\nTogether, the findings indicate that the virus by itself can wreak havoc, says Michael Diamond, a viral immunologist at Washington University in St Louis in Missouri who led the Cell study. \"Some people feel there are many cofactors like insecticides,\" Diamond says. \"Our study suggests at least you don't have to invoke other things.\" And by providing an animal model for the fetal damage, the studies should also ease the path for testing potential vaccines and treatments.\n\nMice normally cannot sustain a Zika infection because the virus triggers secretion of interferons, molecules that bolster immune responses. Diamond's lab circumvented this problem by creating female mice that had a key interferon gene knocked out; in a 2nd experiment, they treated pregnant animals with an anti-interferon antibody. The team then injected pregnant females with a virus isolated from a person in French Polynesia; the isolate is 99 per cent genetically similar to the one now circulating in Latin America.\n\nIn the knockout mice, the virus replicated to higher levels than in those treated with the antibody, killing most of the fetuses. The researchers found high levels of Zika virus in the placentas -- 1000 times more than in the mother's blood -- supporting the hypothesis that the virus harms the placenta, which, in turn, cuts the blood supply to the fetus, Diamond says.\n\nPregnant mice treated with the antibody still made enough interferon to partially control the infection and allow the pups to survive. Mirroring effects seen in humans, they were born small, a condition known as intrauterine growth restriction.\n\nIn both sets of mice, the virus also turned up in fetal heads, Diamond says, suggesting that it causes brain damage directly as well as by impairing the placenta. That's consistent with earlier in vitro findings that Zika can infect and damage human neural precursor cells. Neither set of pups developed microcephaly, which Diamond says could be because the researchers infected the mothers so early during pregnancy that not much brain development had yet occurred.\n\nThe 2 other mouse experiments, published in Cell Stem Cell and Nature, did document microcephaly. Neither team manipulated their mice to make them more susceptible to the virus. In the Cell Stem Cell study, Zhiheng Xu of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing sidestepped the mice's natural resistance to Zika virus by injecting a Samoan isolate directly into fetal brains. In Nature, Fernanda Cugola of the University of S\u00e3o Paulo in Brazil and co-workers injected a Brazilian isolate into the tails of a strain of mice that are naturally immunocompromised. Diamond notes that the Brazilian-led team injected an \"astronomical amount of virus\" through the intravenous route, which may have sent the virus directly to the placenta and helped dodge the antiviral immune response.\n\nBoth studies found malformations associated with microcephaly, including what's known as cortical thinning and smaller brains. The 2 reports also showed that Zika virus infected and damaged neuronal stem cells harvested from mice and humans. \"If you see consistent phenotypes in different models, the things that are happening are probably important,\" says Guo-li Ming of Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore, Maryland, who led the earlier studies of Zika in human neural progenitor cells.\n\nThe researchers who study these various mouse models acknowledge that they differ from humans in many critical ways. \"It's very difficult to study humans directly,\" Diamond notes. Yet he stresses that these mouse models give insights into pathogenesis and will allow for high-throughput screening of drugs and vaccines against the virus.\n\nMonkeys are naturally infected with Zika virus and are far closer to humans in many ways, and at least a half-dozen studies are under way. In an unusual twist for the primate research community, investigators from 4 US labs have been posting data from their monkey Zika experiments on their websites in near real time, before publication. \"We decided that the best thing for the community was that information be made available as widely as possible and freely available,\" says David O'Connor, whose group at the University of Wisconsin, Madison is furthest along in studying Zika infection of pregnant monkeys.\n\nOne pregnant rhesus macaque that O'Connor's group is following was 50 days post-infection at last report, and a little more than halfway through her pregnancy. Sonograms of the fetus -- which are posted online -- \"sort of\" show evidence that the head circumference is small, but O'Connor and colleagues \"are not drawing too much attention to it,\" he says, because it's not that far outside of the normal range. The group will know for sure after they perform a cesarean section on the mother, which will also let them obtain the placenta, normally eaten by rhesus mothers. \"I hope we can accelerate the information about what's going on in people,\" he says.\n\nO'Connor points out that Zika-infected monkeys do not perfectly reflect humans either, and he sees the various models as complementary. \"We can learn a lot from the fact that pregnancies are quick in the mice, and you can do much larger experiments, but in monkeys, we can do experiments that are much more relevant to human pregnancy,\" he says. \"Clearly, we have a lot of work to do, but these experiments are opening up the possibility that Zika's effects during pregnancy may be much more common than we initially thought.\"\n\n[byline: Jon Cohen]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Although the authors of these various studies point out that the experimental animals -- mice and monkeys -- are different from humans, they may provide some general insights into the pathophysiology of Zika virus infections that can lead to focused observations in human cases that occur in nature. -

epidemiological update\nDate: Thu 19 May 2016\nSource: WHO/PAHO Zika - epidemiological update [edited]\nhttp://www.paho.org/hq/index.php?option=com_docman&task=doc_view&Itemid=270&gid=34701&lang=en\n\n\nTo date, 39 countries and territories have confirmed local, vectorborne transmission of Zika virus in the Region of the Americas since 2015. Since the last Pan American Health Organization/World Health Organization (PAHO/WHO) Zika epidemiological update on 12 May 2016, Argentina has confirmed vectorborne autochthonous transmission of Zika virus.\n\nAs mentioned in previous Zika epidemiological updates, trends observed in the Region of the Americas vary depending on the timing of the epidemic onset and timing of the seasonal period of mosquitoborne diseases. In general, countries and territories where the epidemic started later have exhibited upward trends.\n\nColombia\nFollowing Brazil, Colombia was the 2nd country to report circulation of Zika virus in the Americas in 2015. Cases were initially reported in the Department of Bolivar and then spread to the rest of the country; as of epidemiological week (EW) 18 of 2016, 747 municipalities in the country have reported cases. Between EW 32 of 2015 and to EW 18 of 2016, a bimodal epidemic curve of Zika virus disease cases (suspected and confirmed) was observed. The peaks of the cases occurred in EW 5 of 2016 (6309 cases) and EW 13, 2016 (3609 cases) and have since demonstrated a downward trend.\n\nZika virus disease in pregnant women\nDetection of Zika virus disease in pregnant women is being heightened in countries in the region due to risk of congenital syndrome associated with Zika virus infection. There are 21 countries and territories in the Americas reporting confirmed and suspected cases of Zika virus disease in pregnant women; this number remains the same since the last PAHO/WHO Zika epidemiological update on 12 May 2016.\n\nCountries and territories reporting Zika virus disease in pregnant women:\nBarbados, Dominican Republic, Honduras, Puerto Rico, Brazil, Ecuador, Martinique Saint Martin, Bolivia, El Salvador, Mexico, Venezuela, Colombia, French Guiana, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Guadeloupe, Panama, Dominica, Guatemala, Paraguay.\n\nAcute flaccid paralysis trends in Bolivia\nFollowing the description of historical trends in increasing reports of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) in children under 15 years of age, as seen with Colombia, Ecuador, Guatemala, and Venezuela, the current situation in Bolivia is highlighted below.\n\nCompared to 2015, a slight increase in reported AFP is noted in Bolivia for 2016 as of EW 18. If the notifications continue at the same rate in 2016, a bigger increase in comparison to 2015 can be expected by the end of the year. While AFP is the manifestation of a wide spectrum of diseases, this situation highlights the importance for countries and territories with Zika virus circulation to analyze the trends in reports of AFP and investigate any unusual increase of cases.\n\nOf note, Bolivia, has not reported an increase of GBS cases to date.\n\nHighlighted below are the surveillance results of pregnant women with Zika virus disease in Ecuador and Panama.\n\nEcuador\nBetween EW 52 of 2015 and EW 17 of 2016, Zika virus disease has been laboratory confirmed in 8 pregnant women in Ecuador. Of these women, 4 are in the 2nd trimester of their pregnancy, and 2 are in the 3rd trimester. To date, no occurrences of congenital syndrome associated with Zika virus disease have been registered.\n\nPanama\nSince the beginning of the outbreak in Panama in EW 48 of 2015 until EW 18 of 2016, 31 pregnant women with suspected Zika virus disease have been detected; of those, 16 were laboratory confirmed, and 15 were negative for Zika virus.\n\nAs of EW 18 of 2016, Panama has reported 3 cases of laboratory confirmed congenital syndrome associated with Zika virus infection. The 3 mothers were asymptomatic, with one additional case of fetal death at 32 gestational weeks, all had positive laboratory samples for Zika virus.\n\nCongenital syndrome associated with Zika virus infection\nCountries and territories in the Americas with reported congenital syndrome associated with Zika virus infection:\nBrazil 1384 cases\nColombia 7 cases\nMartinique 3 cases\nPanama 4 cases\nPuerto Rico 1 case\nUnited States 2\n\nBrazil\nAccording to the Ministry of Health of Brazil, between 22 Oct 2015 and 14 May 2016, a total of 7534 suspected cases of microcephaly and other congenital malformation of the central nervous system (CNS) have been reported as per Brazil's Surveillance and Response protocol. Of these, the Brazil Ministry of Health confirmed 1384 cases of microcephaly by clinical, radiological and/or laboratory methods (207 have been confirmed by laboratory criteria). Out of the total reported cases, 2818 cases were discarded as being due to non-infectious causes or not fitting the case definition, and 3332 remain under investigation. The confirmed cases occurred in 499 municipalities, located in 26 out of 27 Federal Units.\n\nBetween EW 3 and EW 19 of 2016, the greatest number of microcephaly cases were confirmed in EW 4 (134 cases). During the same period, the range of cases investigated (confirmed and discarded) were between 80 and 381 (EW 12 and 4, respectively).\n\nGuillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS) and other neurological disorders\nTo date, 7 countries in the region have reported an increase in cases of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS) with at least one case laboratory confirmed for Zika virus. Paraguay continues to report an increase in GBS cases, none of which have laboratory results confirming Zika virus infection; 5 other countries and territories have not recorded increases but identified Zika virus-associated cases of GBS.\n\nIncrease in GBS plus Zika virus lab confirmation in at least one case of GBS\nBrazil, Colombia, Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Honduras, Suriname, Venezuela\n\nZika virus lab confirmation in at least one case of GBS\nFrench Guiana, Haiti, Panama, Puerto Rico, Martinique\n\nIncrease in GBS with no Zika virus lab confirmation in any of the cases\nParaguay\n\nTrend of neurological syndromes in Colombia\nSince 15 Dec 2015 until EW 18 of 2016, there were 517 cases of neurological syndromes reported in Colombia with history of febrile illness consistent with Zika virus infection. Of the total number of neurological syndromes, 65 per cent (335 cases) correspond to GBS. The epidemic curve of neurological syndromes shows a similar distribution to the Zika virus disease cases even though the neurological syndromes began 10 epidemiological weeks later and an elevation 2 weeks prior to the peak of Zika virus disease cases which occurred in EW 5 of 2016.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[2] Cases in various countries:\nAmericas\n\n[Maps showing the location of the affected islands and countries in the Americas mentioned below can be accessed at\nhttp://healthmap.org/promed/p/35574;\nNorth America at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/106;\nCentral America http://healthmap.org/promed/p/39455;\nCaribbean http://www.mapsofworld.com/caribbean-islands/ and\nSouth America at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/6186. - Mod.TY]\n\nCentral America\n---\nBelize. 16 May 2016.

(conf) Zika virus (ZIKV) has been isolated from a female traveler who recently returned from Tonga to Brisbane, Queensland, Australia in 2016. The patient, in her 30s, was diagnosed with Zika virus infection using a ZIKV specific real-time RT-PCR1. The RT-PCR ZIKV positive serum sample was negative for flavivirus serology. A urine sample collected 4 days following the serum sample was also ZIKV RT-PCR positive. Several attempts to isolate virus from both the serum and urine were made using both cell culture (_Aedes albopictus_ C6/36 cells and African green monkey Vero cells) and suckling mice. A ZIKV isolate was recovered from the serum sample after one passage in suckling mouse brains 11 days post inoculation. This is the 1st known report of successful isolation of ZIKV from a human clinical sample in Australia. The ZIKV isolate from Tonga 2016 belongs to the Asian lineage.\n\nReference\nPyke AT, et al.

Public health officials are gathering data on the health consequences of the infection, including the rate at which fetuses develop abnormally shrunken heads and brain damage, a birth defect called microcephaly.\n\nAlso on Friday [20 May 2016], the World Health Organization confirmed that the strain of Zika virus in Cape Verde, just off the western coast of Africa, is the same strain that is spreading in Brazil. Almost 200 pregnant women in Cape Verde have been infected, and the virus has been blamed for 3 cases of microcephaly there.\n\nThe rising numbers of pregnant American women testing positive -- Friday's [20 May 2016] figure is more than double the previous count of 113 -- reflect a new case definition used by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention rather than a surge in cases, according to Dr Margaret Honein, the chief of the agency's birth defects division.\n\nNo cases transmitted by mosquito have yet been reported in the 50 states. The number of infected pregnant women in this country began rising dramatically in February [2016], probably reflecting the spread of the Zika virus from Brazil to more countries visited by Americans.\n\nMost of the 279 women are still pregnant, Dr Honein said, and fewer than a dozen have experienced \"adverse outcomes,\" such as stillbirths, microcephaly or other congenital problems. A \"relatively small number\" of the infections clearly resulted from sexual transmission rather than mosquito bites, she added. But in most cases, it was difficult to determine how the women became infected because they had lived in or had traveled to areas where mosquitoes carrying the virus were biting.\n\n[byline: Donald G McNeil, Jr]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[This prospective monitoring is very useful to come up with a more precise estimate of occurrences of fetal malformations in women who were infected with Zika virus during pregnancy. One hopes that the monitoring can continue, as the number of infected pregnant women is likely to increase during the summer travel season, perhaps with additional cases should local transmission of the virus in the USA occur during the upcoming mosquito transmission season.\n\nThe details of the study above, entitled \"Possible Zika virus infection among pregnant women -- United States and Territories, May 2016\", appeared in the 20 May 2016 issue of CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/65/wr/mm6520e1.htm?s_cid=mm6520e1_w). - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[4] Microcephaly studies in mice, monkeys\nDate: Wed 11 May 2016\nSource: Science [edited]\nhttp://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/05/zika-causes-microcephaly-mice\n\n\nBy far the most alarming feature of the Zika virus now marching across South America and the Caribbean is its threat to fetuses. Last month [April 2016], the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention declared that \"a causal relationship\" exists between the virus and brain abnormalities in newborns, most noticeably a small head, known as microcephaly. But just how a mother's infection harms the fetus, and how to prevent the damage, is uncertain.\n\nNew animal models are now pointing to answers. Pregnant monkeys are showing hints of fetal damage. But the most dramatic results come from mice. Mouse studies published this week in Cell and its sister journal Cell Stem Cell and in Nature show precisely how the virus slows fetal growth, damages the brain, and leads to miscarriage. The 2 of them also prove for the 1st time in an animal model that Zika virus can cause microcephaly in fetuses.\n\nTogether, the findings indicate that the virus by itself can wreak havoc, says Michael Diamond, a viral immunologist at Washington University in St Louis in Missouri who led the Cell study. \"Some people feel there are many cofactors like insecticides,\" Diamond says. \"Our study suggests at least you don't have to invoke other things.\" And by providing an animal model for the fetal damage, the studies should also ease the path for testing potential vaccines and treatments.\n\nMice normally cannot sustain a Zika infection because the virus triggers secretion of interferons, molecules that bolster immune responses. Diamond's lab circumvented this problem by creating female mice that had a key interferon gene knocked out; in a 2nd experiment, they treated pregnant animals with an anti-interferon antibody. The team then injected pregnant females with a virus isolated from a person in French Polynesia; the isolate is 99 per cent genetically similar to the one now circulating in Latin America.\n\nIn the knockout mice, the virus replicated to higher levels than in those treated with the antibody, killing most of the fetuses. The researchers found high levels of Zika virus in the placentas -- 1000 times more than in the mother's blood -- supporting the hypothesis that the virus harms the placenta, which, in turn, cuts the blood supply to the fetus, Diamond says.\n\nPregnant mice treated with the antibody still made enough interferon to partially control the infection and allow the pups to survive. Mirroring effects seen in humans, they were born small, a condition known as intrauterine growth restriction.\n\nIn both sets of mice, the virus also turned up in fetal heads, Diamond says, suggesting that it causes brain damage directly as well as by impairing the placenta. That's consistent with earlier in vitro findings that Zika can infect and damage human neural precursor cells. Neither set of pups developed microcephaly, which Diamond says could be because the researchers infected the mothers so early during pregnancy that not much brain development had yet occurred.\n\nThe 2 other mouse experiments, published in Cell Stem Cell and Nature, did document microcephaly. Neither team manipulated their mice to make them more susceptible to the virus. In the Cell Stem Cell study, Zhiheng Xu of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing sidestepped the mice's natural resistance to Zika virus by injecting a Samoan isolate directly into fetal brains. In Nature, Fernanda Cugola of the University of S\u00e3o Paulo in Brazil and co-workers injected a Brazilian isolate into the tails of a strain of mice that are naturally immunocompromised. Diamond notes that the Brazilian-led team injected an \"astronomical amount of virus\" through the intravenous route, which may have sent the virus directly to the placenta and helped dodge the antiviral immune response.\n\nBoth studies found malformations associated with microcephaly, including what's known as cortical thinning and smaller brains. The 2 reports also showed that Zika virus infected and damaged neuronal stem cells harvested from mice and humans. \"If you see consistent phenotypes in different models, the things that are happening are probably important,\" says Guo-li Ming of Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore, Maryland, who led the earlier studies of Zika in human neural progenitor cells.\n\nThe researchers who study these various mouse models acknowledge that they differ from humans in many critical ways. \"It's very difficult to study humans directly,\" Diamond notes. Yet he stresses that these mouse models give insights into pathogenesis and will allow for high-throughput screening of drugs and vaccines against the virus.\n\nMonkeys are naturally infected with Zika virus and are far closer to humans in many ways, and at least a half-dozen studies are under way. In an unusual twist for the primate research community, investigators from 4 US labs have been posting data from their monkey Zika experiments on their websites in near real time, before publication. \"We decided that the best thing for the community was that information be made available as widely as possible and freely available,\" says David O'Connor, whose group at the University of Wisconsin, Madison is furthest along in studying Zika infection of pregnant monkeys.\n\nOne pregnant rhesus macaque that O'Connor's group is following was 50 days post-infection at last report, and a little more than halfway through her pregnancy. Sonograms of the fetus -- which are posted online -- \"sort of\" show evidence that the head circumference is small, but O'Connor and colleagues \"are not drawing too much attention to it,\" he says, because it's not that far outside of the normal range. The group will know for sure after they perform a cesarean section on the mother, which will also let them obtain the placenta, normally eaten by rhesus mothers. \"I hope we can accelerate the information about what's going on in people,\" he says.\n\nO'Connor points out that Zika-infected monkeys do not perfectly reflect humans either, and he sees the various models as complementary. \"We can learn a lot from the fact that pregnancies are quick in the mice, and you can do much larger experiments, but in monkeys, we can do experiments that are much more relevant to human pregnancy,\" he says. \"Clearly, we have a lot of work to do, but these experiments are opening up the possibility that Zika's effects during pregnancy may be much more common than we initially thought.\"\n\n[byline: Jon Cohen]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Although the authors of these various studies point out that the experimental animals -- mice and monkeys -- are different from humans, they may provide some general insights into the pathophysiology of Zika virus infections that can lead to focused observations in human cases that occur in nature. -

Since the last Pan American Health Organization/World Health Organization (PAHO/WHO) Zika epidemiological update on 12 May 2016, Argentina has confirmed vectorborne autochthonous transmission of Zika virus.\n\nAs mentioned in previous Zika epidemiological updates, trends observed in the Region of the Americas vary depending on the timing of the epidemic onset and timing of the seasonal period of mosquitoborne diseases. In general, countries and territories where the epidemic started later have exhibited upward trends.\n\nColombia\nFollowing Brazil, Colombia was the 2nd country to report circulation of Zika virus in the Americas in 2015. Cases were initially reported in the Department of Bolivar and then spread to the rest of the country; as of epidemiological week (EW) 18 of 2016, 747 municipalities in the country have reported cases. Between EW 32 of 2015 and to EW 18 of 2016, a bimodal epidemic curve of Zika virus disease cases (suspected and confirmed) was observed. The peaks of the cases occurred in EW 5 of 2016 (6309 cases) and EW 13, 2016 (3609 cases) and have since demonstrated a downward trend.\n\nZika virus disease in pregnant women\nDetection of Zika virus disease in pregnant women is being heightened in countries in the region due to risk of congenital syndrome associated with Zika virus infection. There are 21 countries and territories in the Americas reporting confirmed and suspected cases of Zika virus disease in pregnant women; this number remains the same since the last PAHO/WHO Zika epidemiological update on 12 May 2016.\n\nCountries and territories reporting Zika virus disease in pregnant women:\nBarbados, Dominican Republic, Honduras, Puerto Rico, Brazil, Ecuador, Martinique Saint Martin, Bolivia, El Salvador, Mexico, Venezuela, Colombia, French Guiana, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Guadeloupe, Panama, Dominica, Guatemala, Paraguay.\n\nAcute flaccid paralysis trends in Bolivia\nFollowing the description of historical trends in increasing reports of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) in children under 15 years of age, as seen with Colombia, Ecuador, Guatemala, and Venezuela, the current situation in Bolivia is highlighted below.\n\nCompared to 2015, a slight increase in reported AFP is noted in Bolivia for 2016 as of EW 18. If the notifications continue at the same rate in 2016, a bigger increase in comparison to 2015 can be expected by the end of the year. While AFP is the manifestation of a wide spectrum of diseases, this situation highlights the importance for countries and territories with Zika virus circulation to analyze the trends in reports of AFP and investigate any unusual increase of cases.\n\nOf note, Bolivia, has not reported an increase of GBS cases to date.\n\nHighlighted below are the surveillance results of pregnant women with Zika virus disease in Ecuador and Panama.\n\nEcuador\nBetween EW 52 of 2015 and EW 17 of 2016, Zika virus disease has been laboratory confirmed in 8 pregnant women in Ecuador. Of these women, 4 are in the 2nd trimester of their pregnancy, and 2 are in the 3rd trimester. To date, no occurrences of congenital syndrome associated with Zika virus disease have been registered.\n\nPanama\nSince the beginning of the outbreak in Panama in EW 48 of 2015 until EW 18 of 2016, 31 pregnant women with suspected Zika virus disease have been detected; of those, 16 were laboratory confirmed, and 15 were negative for Zika virus.\n\nAs of EW 18 of 2016, Panama has reported 3 cases of laboratory confirmed congenital syndrome associated with Zika virus infection. The 3 mothers were asymptomatic, with one additional case of fetal death at 32 gestational weeks, all had positive laboratory samples for Zika virus.\n\nCongenital syndrome associated with Zika virus infection\nCountries and territories in the Americas with reported congenital syndrome associated with Zika virus infection:\nBrazil 1384 cases\nColombia 7 cases\nMartinique 3 cases\nPanama 4 cases\nPuerto Rico 1 case\nUnited States 2\n\nBrazil\nAccording to the Ministry of Health of Brazil, between 22 Oct 2015 and 14 May 2016, a total of 7534 suspected cases of microcephaly and other congenital malformation of the central nervous system (CNS) have been reported as per Brazil's Surveillance and Response protocol. Of these, the Brazil Ministry of Health confirmed 1384 cases of microcephaly by clinical, radiological and/or laboratory methods (207 have been confirmed by laboratory criteria). Out of the total reported cases, 2818 cases were discarded as being due to non-infectious causes or not fitting the case definition, and 3332 remain under investigation. The confirmed cases occurred in 499 municipalities, located in 26 out of 27 Federal Units.\n\nBetween EW 3 and EW 19 of 2016, the greatest number of microcephaly cases were confirmed in EW 4 (134 cases). During the same period, the range of cases investigated (confirmed and discarded) were between 80 and 381 (EW 12 and 4, respectively).\n\nGuillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS) and other neurological disorders\nTo date, 7 countries in the region have reported an increase in cases of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS) with at least one case laboratory confirmed for Zika virus.

A urine sample collected 4 days following the serum sample was also ZIKV RT-PCR positive. Several attempts to isolate virus from both the serum and urine were made using both cell culture (_Aedes albopictus_ C6/36 cells and African green monkey Vero cells) and suckling mice. A ZIKV isolate was recovered from the serum sample after one passage in suckling mouse brains 11 days post inoculation. This is the 1st known report of successful isolation of ZIKV from a human clinical sample in Australia. The ZIKV isolate from Tonga 2016 belongs to the Asian lineage.\n\nReference\nPyke AT, et al.

Public health officials are gathering data on the health consequences of the infection, including the rate at which fetuses develop abnormally shrunken heads and brain damage, a birth defect called microcephaly.\n\nAlso on Friday [20 May 2016], the World Health Organization confirmed that the strain of Zika virus in Cape Verde, just off the western coast of Africa, is the same strain that is spreading in Brazil. Almost 200 pregnant women in Cape Verde have been infected, and the virus has been blamed for 3 cases of microcephaly there.\n\nThe rising numbers of pregnant American women testing positive -- Friday's [20 May 2016] figure is more than double the previous count of 113 -- reflect a new case definition used by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention rather than a surge in cases, according to Dr Margaret Honein, the chief of the agency's birth defects division.\n\nNo cases transmitted by mosquito have yet been reported in the 50 states. The number of infected pregnant women in this country began rising dramatically in February [2016], probably reflecting the spread of the Zika virus from Brazil to more countries visited by Americans.\n\nMost of the 279 women are still pregnant, Dr Honein said, and fewer than a dozen have experienced \"adverse outcomes,\" such as stillbirths, microcephaly or other congenital problems. A \"relatively small number\" of the infections clearly resulted from sexual transmission rather than mosquito bites, she added. But in most cases, it was difficult to determine how the women became infected because they had lived in or had traveled to areas where mosquitoes carrying the virus were biting.\n\n[byline: Donald G McNeil, Jr]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[This prospective monitoring is very useful to come up with a more precise estimate of occurrences of fetal malformations in women who were infected with Zika virus during pregnancy. One hopes that the monitoring can continue, as the number of infected pregnant women is likely to increase during the summer travel season, perhaps with additional cases should local transmission of the virus in the USA occur during the upcoming mosquito transmission season.\n\nThe details of the study above, entitled \"Possible Zika virus infection among pregnant women -- United States and Territories, May 2016\", appeared in the 20 May 2016 issue of CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/65/wr/mm6520e1.htm?s_cid=mm6520e1_w). - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[4] Microcephaly studies in mice, monkeys\nDate: Wed 11 May 2016\nSource: Science [edited]\nhttp://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/05/zika-causes-microcephaly-mice\n\n\nBy far the most alarming feature of the Zika virus now marching across South America and the Caribbean is its threat to fetuses. Last month [April 2016], the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention declared that \"a causal relationship\" exists between the virus and brain abnormalities in newborns, most noticeably a small head, known as microcephaly. But just how a mother's infection harms the fetus, and how to prevent the damage, is uncertain.\n\nNew animal models are now pointing to answers. Pregnant monkeys are showing hints of fetal damage. But the most dramatic results come from mice. Mouse studies published this week in Cell and its sister journal Cell Stem Cell and in Nature show precisely how the virus slows fetal growth, damages the brain, and leads to miscarriage. The 2 of them also prove for the 1st time in an animal model that Zika virus can cause microcephaly in fetuses.\n\nTogether, the findings indicate that the virus by itself can wreak havoc, says Michael Diamond, a viral immunologist at Washington University in St Louis in Missouri who led the Cell study. \"Some people feel there are many cofactors like insecticides,\" Diamond says. \"Our study suggests at least you don't have to invoke other things.\" And by providing an animal model for the fetal damage, the studies should also ease the path for testing potential vaccines and treatments.\n\nMice normally cannot sustain a Zika infection because the virus triggers secretion of interferons, molecules that bolster immune responses. Diamond's lab circumvented this problem by creating female mice that had a key interferon gene knocked out; in a 2nd experiment, they treated pregnant animals with an anti-interferon antibody. The team then injected pregnant females with a virus isolated from a person in French Polynesia; the isolate is 99 per cent genetically similar to the one now circulating in Latin America.\n\nIn the knockout mice, the virus replicated to higher levels than in those treated with the antibody, killing most of the fetuses. The researchers found high levels of Zika virus in the placentas -- 1000 times more than in the mother's blood -- supporting the hypothesis that the virus harms the placenta, which, in turn, cuts the blood supply to the fetus, Diamond says.\n\nPregnant mice treated with the antibody still made enough interferon to partially control the infection and allow the pups to survive. Mirroring effects seen in humans, they were born small, a condition known as intrauterine growth restriction.\n\nIn both sets of mice, the virus also turned up in fetal heads, Diamond says, suggesting that it causes brain damage directly as well as by impairing the placenta. That's consistent with earlier in vitro findings that Zika can infect and damage human neural precursor cells. Neither set of pups developed microcephaly, which Diamond says could be because the researchers infected the mothers so early during pregnancy that not much brain development had yet occurred.\n\nThe 2 other mouse experiments, published in Cell Stem Cell and Nature, did document microcephaly. Neither team manipulated their mice to make them more susceptible to the virus. In the Cell Stem Cell study, Zhiheng Xu of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing sidestepped the mice's natural resistance to Zika virus by injecting a Samoan isolate directly into fetal brains. In Nature, Fernanda Cugola of the University of S\u00e3o Paulo in Brazil and co-workers injected a Brazilian isolate into the tails of a strain of mice that are naturally immunocompromised. Diamond notes that the Brazilian-led team injected an \"astronomical amount of virus\" through the intravenous route, which may have sent the virus directly to the placenta and helped dodge the antiviral immune response.\n\nBoth studies found malformations associated with microcephaly, including what's known as cortical thinning and smaller brains. The 2 reports also showed that Zika virus infected and damaged neuronal stem cells harvested from mice and humans. \"If you see consistent phenotypes in different models, the things that are happening are probably important,\" says Guo-li Ming of Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore, Maryland, who led the earlier studies of Zika in human neural progenitor cells.\n\nThe researchers who study these various mouse models acknowledge that they differ from humans in many critical ways. \"It's very difficult to study humans directly,\" Diamond notes. Yet he stresses that these mouse models give insights into pathogenesis and will allow for high-throughput screening of drugs and vaccines against the virus.\n\nMonkeys are naturally infected with Zika virus and are far closer to humans in many ways, and at least a half-dozen studies are under way. In an unusual twist for the primate research community, investigators from 4 US labs have been posting data from their monkey Zika experiments on their websites in near real time, before publication. \"We decided that the best thing for the community was that information be made available as widely as possible and freely available,\" says David O'Connor, whose group at the University of Wisconsin, Madison is furthest along in studying Zika infection of pregnant monkeys.\n\nOne pregnant rhesus macaque that O'Connor's group is following was 50 days post-infection at last report, and a little more than halfway through her pregnancy. Sonograms of the fetus -- which are posted online -- \"sort of\" show evidence that the head circumference is small, but O'Connor and colleagues \"are not drawing too much attention to it,\" he says, because it's not that far outside of the normal range. The group will know for sure after they perform a cesarean section on the mother, which will also let them obtain the placenta, normally eaten by rhesus mothers. \"I hope we can accelerate the information about what's going on in people,\" he says.\n\nO'Connor points out that Zika-infected monkeys do not perfectly reflect humans either, and he sees the various models as complementary. \"We can learn a lot from the fact that pregnancies are quick in the mice, and you can do much larger experiments, but in monkeys, we can do experiments that are much more relevant to human pregnancy,\" he says. \"Clearly, we have a lot of work to do, but these experiments are opening up the possibility that Zika's effects during pregnancy may be much more common than we initially thought.\"\n\n[byline: Jon Cohen]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Although the authors of these various studies point out that the experimental animals -- mice and monkeys -- are different from humans, they may provide some general insights into the pathophysiology of Zika virus infections that can lead to focused observations in human cases that occur in nature. -

epidemiological update\nDate: Thu 19 May 2016\nSource: WHO/PAHO Zika - epidemiological update [edited]\nhttp://www.paho.org/hq/index.php?option=com_docman&task=doc_view&Itemid=270&gid=34701&lang=en\n\n\nTo date, 39 countries and territories have confirmed local, vectorborne transmission of Zika virus in the Region of the Americas since 2015. Since the last Pan American Health Organization/World Health Organization (PAHO/WHO) Zika epidemiological update on 12 May 2016, Argentina has confirmed vectorborne autochthonous transmission of Zika virus.\n\nAs mentioned in previous Zika epidemiological updates, trends observed in the Region of the Americas vary depending on the timing of the epidemic onset and timing of the seasonal period of mosquitoborne diseases. In general, countries and territories where the epidemic started later have exhibited upward trends.\n\nColombia\nFollowing Brazil, Colombia was the 2nd country to report circulation of Zika virus in the Americas in 2015. Cases were initially reported in the Department of Bolivar and then spread to the rest of the country; as of epidemiological week (EW) 18 of 2016, 747 municipalities in the country have reported cases. Between EW 32 of 2015 and to EW 18 of 2016, a bimodal epidemic curve of Zika virus disease cases (suspected and confirmed) was observed. The peaks of the cases occurred in EW 5 of 2016 (6309 cases) and EW 13, 2016 (3609 cases) and have since demonstrated a downward trend.\n\nZika virus disease in pregnant women\nDetection of Zika virus disease in pregnant women is being heightened in countries in the region due to risk of congenital syndrome associated with Zika virus infection. There are 21 countries and territories in the Americas reporting confirmed and suspected cases of Zika virus disease in pregnant women; this number remains the same since the last PAHO/WHO Zika epidemiological update on 12 May 2016.\n\nCountries and territories reporting Zika virus disease in pregnant women:\nBarbados, Dominican Republic, Honduras, Puerto Rico, Brazil, Ecuador, Martinique Saint Martin, Bolivia, El Salvador, Mexico, Venezuela, Colombia, French Guiana, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Guadeloupe, Panama, Dominica, Guatemala, Paraguay.\n\nAcute flaccid paralysis trends in Bolivia\nFollowing the description of historical trends in increasing reports of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) in children under 15 years of age, as seen with Colombia, Ecuador, Guatemala, and Venezuela, the current situation in Bolivia is highlighted below.\n\nCompared to 2015, a slight increase in reported AFP is noted in Bolivia for 2016 as of EW 18. If the notifications continue at the same rate in 2016, a bigger increase in comparison to 2015 can be expected by the end of the year. While AFP is the manifestation of a wide spectrum of diseases, this situation highlights the importance for countries and territories with Zika virus circulation to analyze the trends in reports of AFP and investigate any unusual increase of cases.\n\nOf note, Bolivia, has not reported an increase of GBS cases to date.\n\nHighlighted below are the surveillance results of pregnant women with Zika virus disease in Ecuador and Panama.\n\nEcuador\nBetween EW 52 of 2015 and EW 17 of 2016, Zika virus disease has been laboratory confirmed in 8 pregnant women in Ecuador. Of these women, 4 are in the 2nd trimester of their pregnancy, and 2 are in the 3rd trimester. To date, no occurrences of congenital syndrome associated with Zika virus disease have been registered.\n\nPanama\nSince the beginning of the outbreak in Panama in EW 48 of 2015 until EW 18 of 2016, 31 pregnant women with suspected Zika virus disease have been detected; of those, 16 were laboratory confirmed, and 15 were negative for Zika virus.\n\nAs of EW 18 of 2016, Panama has reported 3 cases of laboratory confirmed congenital syndrome associated with Zika virus infection. The 3 mothers were asymptomatic, with one additional case of fetal death at 32 gestational weeks, all had positive laboratory samples for Zika virus.\n\nCongenital syndrome associated with Zika virus infection\nCountries and territories in the Americas with reported congenital syndrome associated with Zika virus infection:\nBrazil 1384 cases\nColombia 7 cases\nMartinique 3 cases\nPanama 4 cases\nPuerto Rico 1 case\nUnited States 2\n\nBrazil\nAccording to the Ministry of Health of Brazil, between 22 Oct 2015 and 14 May 2016, a total of 7534 suspected cases of microcephaly and other congenital malformation of the central nervous system (CNS) have been reported as per Brazil's Surveillance and Response protocol. Of these, the Brazil Ministry of Health confirmed 1384 cases of microcephaly by clinical, radiological and/or laboratory methods (207 have been confirmed by laboratory criteria). Out of the total reported cases, 2818 cases were discarded as being due to non-infectious causes or not fitting the case definition, and 3332 remain under investigation. The confirmed cases occurred in 499 municipalities, located in 26 out of 27 Federal Units.\n\nBetween EW 3 and EW 19 of 2016, the greatest number of microcephaly cases were confirmed in EW 4 (134 cases). During the same period, the range of cases investigated (confirmed and discarded) were between 80 and 381 (EW 12 and 4, respectively).\n\nGuillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS) and other neurological disorders\nTo date, 7 countries in the region have reported an increase in cases of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS) with at least one case laboratory confirmed for Zika virus. Paraguay continues to report an increase in GBS cases, none of which have laboratory results confirming Zika virus infection; 5 other countries and territories have not recorded increases but identified Zika virus-associated cases of GBS.\n\nIncrease in GBS plus Zika virus lab confirmation in at least one case of GBS\nBrazil, Colombia, Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Honduras, Suriname, Venezuela\n\nZika virus lab confirmation in at least one case of GBS\nFrench Guiana, Haiti, Panama, Puerto Rico, Martinique\n\nIncrease in GBS with no Zika virus lab confirmation in any of the cases\nParaguay\n\nTrend of neurological syndromes in Colombia\nSince 15 Dec 2015 until EW 18 of 2016, there were 517 cases of neurological syndromes reported in Colombia with history of febrile illness consistent with Zika virus infection. Of the total number of neurological syndromes, 65 per cent (335 cases) correspond to GBS. The epidemic curve of neurological syndromes shows a similar distribution to the Zika virus disease cases even though the neurological syndromes began 10 epidemiological weeks later and an elevation 2 weeks prior to the peak of Zika virus disease cases which occurred in EW 5 of 2016.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[2] Cases in various countries:\nAmericas\n\n[Maps showing the location of the affected islands and countries in the Americas mentioned below can be accessed at\nhttp://healthmap.org/promed/p/35574;\nNorth America at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/106;\nCentral America http://healthmap.org/promed/p/39455;\nCaribbean http://www.mapsofworld.com/caribbean-islands/ and\nSouth America at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/6186. - Mod.TY]\n\nCentral America\n---\nBelize. 16 May 2016.

(conf) Zika virus (ZIKV) has been isolated from a female traveler who recently returned from Tonga to Brisbane, Queensland, Australia in 2016. The patient, in her 30s, was diagnosed with Zika virus infection using a ZIKV specific real-time RT-PCR1. The RT-PCR ZIKV positive serum sample was negative for flavivirus serology. A urine sample collected 4 days following the serum sample was also ZIKV RT-PCR positive. Several attempts to isolate virus from both the serum and urine were made using both cell culture (_Aedes albopictus_ C6/36 cells and African green monkey Vero cells) and suckling mice. A ZIKV isolate was recovered from the serum sample after one passage in suckling mouse brains 11 days post inoculation. This is the 1st known report of successful isolation of ZIKV from a human clinical sample in Australia. The ZIKV isolate from Tonga 2016 belongs to the Asian lineage.\n\nReference\nPyke AT, et al.

Public health officials are gathering data on the health consequences of the infection, including the rate at which fetuses develop abnormally shrunken heads and brain damage, a birth defect called microcephaly.\n\nAlso on Friday [20 May 2016], the World Health Organization confirmed that the strain of Zika virus in Cape Verde, just off the western coast of Africa, is the same strain that is spreading in Brazil. Almost 200 pregnant women in Cape Verde have been infected, and the virus has been blamed for 3 cases of microcephaly there.\n\nThe rising numbers of pregnant American women testing positive -- Friday's [20 May 2016] figure is more than double the previous count of 113 -- reflect a new case definition used by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention rather than a surge in cases, according to Dr Margaret Honein, the chief of the agency's birth defects division.\n\nNo cases transmitted by mosquito have yet been reported in the 50 states. The number of infected pregnant women in this country began rising dramatically in February [2016], probably reflecting the spread of the Zika virus from Brazil to more countries visited by Americans.\n\nMost of the 279 women are still pregnant, Dr Honein said, and fewer than a dozen have experienced \"adverse outcomes,\" such as stillbirths, microcephaly or other congenital problems. A \"relatively small number\" of the infections clearly resulted from sexual transmission rather than mosquito bites, she added. But in most cases, it was difficult to determine how the women became infected because they had lived in or had traveled to areas where mosquitoes carrying the virus were biting.\n\n[byline: Donald G McNeil, Jr]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[This prospective monitoring is very useful to come up with a more precise estimate of occurrences of fetal malformations in women who were infected with Zika virus during pregnancy. One hopes that the monitoring can continue, as the number of infected pregnant women is likely to increase during the summer travel season, perhaps with additional cases should local transmission of the virus in the USA occur during the upcoming mosquito transmission season.\n\nThe details of the study above, entitled \"Possible Zika virus infection among pregnant women -- United States and Territories, May 2016\", appeared in the 20 May 2016 issue of CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/65/wr/mm6520e1.htm?s_cid=mm6520e1_w). - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[4] Microcephaly studies in mice, monkeys\nDate: Wed 11 May 2016\nSource: Science [edited]\nhttp://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/05/zika-causes-microcephaly-mice\n\n\nBy far the most alarming feature of the Zika virus now marching across South America and the Caribbean is its threat to fetuses. Last month [April 2016], the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention declared that \"a causal relationship\" exists between the virus and brain abnormalities in newborns, most noticeably a small head, known as microcephaly. But just how a mother's infection harms the fetus, and how to prevent the damage, is uncertain.\n\nNew animal models are now pointing to answers. Pregnant monkeys are showing hints of fetal damage. But the most dramatic results come from mice. Mouse studies published this week in Cell and its sister journal Cell Stem Cell and in Nature show precisely how the virus slows fetal growth, damages the brain, and leads to miscarriage. The 2 of them also prove for the 1st time in an animal model that Zika virus can cause microcephaly in fetuses.\n\nTogether, the findings indicate that the virus by itself can wreak havoc, says Michael Diamond, a viral immunologist at Washington University in St Louis in Missouri who led the Cell study. \"Some people feel there are many cofactors like insecticides,\" Diamond says. \"Our study suggests at least you don't have to invoke other things.\" And by providing an animal model for the fetal damage, the studies should also ease the path for testing potential vaccines and treatments.\n\nMice normally cannot sustain a Zika infection because the virus triggers secretion of interferons, molecules that bolster immune responses. Diamond's lab circumvented this problem by creating female mice that had a key interferon gene knocked out; in a 2nd experiment, they treated pregnant animals with an anti-interferon antibody. The team then injected pregnant females with a virus isolated from a person in French Polynesia; the isolate is 99 per cent genetically similar to the one now circulating in Latin America.\n\nIn the knockout mice, the virus replicated to higher levels than in those treated with the antibody, killing most of the fetuses. The researchers found high levels of Zika virus in the placentas -- 1000 times more than in the mother's blood -- supporting the hypothesis that the virus harms the placenta, which, in turn, cuts the blood supply to the fetus, Diamond says.\n\nPregnant mice treated with the antibody still made enough interferon to partially control the infection and allow the pups to survive. Mirroring effects seen in humans, they were born small, a condition known as intrauterine growth restriction.\n\nIn both sets of mice, the virus also turned up in fetal heads, Diamond says, suggesting that it causes brain damage directly as well as by impairing the placenta. That's consistent with earlier in vitro findings that Zika can infect and damage human neural precursor cells. Neither set of pups developed microcephaly, which Diamond says could be because the researchers infected the mothers so early during pregnancy that not much brain development had yet occurred.\n\nThe 2 other mouse experiments, published in Cell Stem Cell and Nature, did document microcephaly. Neither team manipulated their mice to make them more susceptible to the virus. In the Cell Stem Cell study, Zhiheng Xu of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing sidestepped the mice's natural resistance to Zika virus by injecting a Samoan isolate directly into fetal brains. In Nature, Fernanda Cugola of the University of S\u00e3o Paulo in Brazil and co-workers injected a Brazilian isolate into the tails of a strain of mice that are naturally immunocompromised. Diamond notes that the Brazilian-led team injected an \"astronomical amount of virus\" through the intravenous route, which may have sent the virus directly to the placenta and helped dodge the antiviral immune response.\n\nBoth studies found malformations associated with microcephaly, including what's known as cortical thinning and smaller brains. The 2 reports also showed that Zika virus infected and damaged neuronal stem cells harvested from mice and humans. \"If you see consistent phenotypes in different models, the things that are happening are probably important,\" says Guo-li Ming of Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore, Maryland, who led the earlier studies of Zika in human neural progenitor cells.\n\nThe researchers who study these various mouse models acknowledge that they differ from humans in many critical ways. \"It's very difficult to study humans directly,\" Diamond notes. Yet he stresses that these mouse models give insights into pathogenesis and will allow for high-throughput screening of drugs and vaccines against the virus.\n\nMonkeys are naturally infected with Zika virus and are far closer to humans in many ways, and at least a half-dozen studies are under way. In an unusual twist for the primate research community, investigators from 4 US labs have been posting data from their monkey Zika experiments on their websites in near real time, before publication. \"We decided that the best thing for the community was that information be made available as widely as possible and freely available,\" says David O'Connor, whose group at the University of Wisconsin, Madison is furthest along in studying Zika infection of pregnant monkeys.\n\nOne pregnant rhesus macaque that O'Connor's group is following was 50 days post-infection at last report, and a little more than halfway through her pregnancy. Sonograms of the fetus -- which are posted online -- \"sort of\" show evidence that the head circumference is small, but O'Connor and colleagues \"are not drawing too much attention to it,\" he says, because it's not that far outside of the normal range. The group will know for sure after they perform a cesarean section on the mother, which will also let them obtain the placenta, normally eaten by rhesus mothers. \"I hope we can accelerate the information about what's going on in people,\" he says.\n\nO'Connor points out that Zika-infected monkeys do not perfectly reflect humans either, and he sees the various models as complementary. \"We can learn a lot from the fact that pregnancies are quick in the mice, and you can do much larger experiments, but in monkeys, we can do experiments that are much more relevant to human pregnancy,\" he says. \"Clearly, we have a lot of work to do, but these experiments are opening up the possibility that Zika's effects during pregnancy may be much more common than we initially thought.\"\n\n[byline: Jon Cohen]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Although the authors of these various studies point out that the experimental animals -- mice and monkeys -- are different from humans, they may provide some general insights into the pathophysiology of Zika virus infections that can lead to focused observations in human cases that occur in nature. -

Since the last Pan American Health Organization/World Health Organization (PAHO/WHO) Zika epidemiological update on 12 May 2016, Argentina has confirmed vectorborne autochthonous transmission of Zika virus.\n\nAs mentioned in previous Zika epidemiological updates, trends observed in the Region of the Americas vary depending on the timing of the epidemic onset and timing of the seasonal period of mosquitoborne diseases. In general, countries and territories where the epidemic started later have exhibited upward trends.\n\nColombia\nFollowing Brazil, Colombia was the 2nd country to report circulation of Zika virus in the Americas in 2015. Cases were initially reported in the Department of Bolivar and then spread to the rest of the country; as of epidemiological week (EW) 18 of 2016, 747 municipalities in the country have reported cases. Between EW 32 of 2015 and to EW 18 of 2016, a bimodal epidemic curve of Zika virus disease cases (suspected and confirmed) was observed. The peaks of the cases occurred in EW 5 of 2016 (6309 cases) and EW 13, 2016 (3609 cases) and have since demonstrated a downward trend.\n\nZika virus disease in pregnant women\nDetection of Zika virus disease in pregnant women is being heightened in countries in the region due to risk of congenital syndrome associated with Zika virus infection. There are 21 countries and territories in the Americas reporting confirmed and suspected cases of Zika virus disease in pregnant women; this number remains the same since the last PAHO/WHO Zika epidemiological update on 12 May 2016.\n\nCountries and territories reporting Zika virus disease in pregnant women:\nBarbados, Dominican Republic, Honduras, Puerto Rico, Brazil, Ecuador, Martinique Saint Martin, Bolivia, El Salvador, Mexico, Venezuela, Colombia, French Guiana, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Guadeloupe, Panama, Dominica, Guatemala, Paraguay.\n\nAcute flaccid paralysis trends in Bolivia\nFollowing the description of historical trends in increasing reports of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) in children under 15 years of age, as seen with Colombia, Ecuador, Guatemala, and Venezuela, the current situation in Bolivia is highlighted below.\n\nCompared to 2015, a slight increase in reported AFP is noted in Bolivia for 2016 as of EW 18. If the notifications continue at the same rate in 2016, a bigger increase in comparison to 2015 can be expected by the end of the year. While AFP is the manifestation of a wide spectrum of diseases, this situation highlights the importance for countries and territories with Zika virus circulation to analyze the trends in reports of AFP and investigate any unusual increase of cases.\n\nOf note, Bolivia, has not reported an increase of GBS cases to date.\n\nHighlighted below are the surveillance results of pregnant women with Zika virus disease in Ecuador and Panama.\n\nEcuador\nBetween EW 52 of 2015 and EW 17 of 2016, Zika virus disease has been laboratory confirmed in 8 pregnant women in Ecuador. Of these women, 4 are in the 2nd trimester of their pregnancy, and 2 are in the 3rd trimester. To date, no occurrences of congenital syndrome associated with Zika virus disease have been registered.\n\nPanama\nSince the beginning of the outbreak in Panama in EW 48 of 2015 until EW 18 of 2016, 31 pregnant women with suspected Zika virus disease have been detected; of those, 16 were laboratory confirmed, and 15 were negative for Zika virus.\n\nAs of EW 18 of 2016, Panama has reported 3 cases of laboratory confirmed congenital syndrome associated with Zika virus infection. The 3 mothers were asymptomatic, with one additional case of fetal death at 32 gestational weeks, all had positive laboratory samples for Zika virus.\n\nCongenital syndrome associated with Zika virus infection\nCountries and territories in the Americas with reported congenital syndrome associated with Zika virus infection:\nBrazil 1384 cases\nColombia 7 cases\nMartinique 3 cases\nPanama 4 cases\nPuerto Rico 1 case\nUnited States 2\n\nBrazil\nAccording to the Ministry of Health of Brazil, between 22 Oct 2015 and 14 May 2016, a total of 7534 suspected cases of microcephaly and other congenital malformation of the central nervous system (CNS) have been reported as per Brazil's Surveillance and Response protocol. Of these, the Brazil Ministry of Health confirmed 1384 cases of microcephaly by clinical, radiological and/or laboratory methods (207 have been confirmed by laboratory criteria). Out of the total reported cases, 2818 cases were discarded as being due to non-infectious causes or not fitting the case definition, and 3332 remain under investigation. The confirmed cases occurred in 499 municipalities, located in 26 out of 27 Federal Units.\n\nBetween EW 3 and EW 19 of 2016, the greatest number of microcephaly cases were confirmed in EW 4 (134 cases). During the same period, the range of cases investigated (confirmed and discarded) were between 80 and 381 (EW 12 and 4, respectively).\n\nGuillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS) and other neurological disorders\nTo date, 7 countries in the region have reported an increase in cases of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS) with at least one case laboratory confirmed for Zika virus.

A urine sample collected 4 days following the serum sample was also ZIKV RT-PCR positive. Several attempts to isolate virus from both the serum and urine were made using both cell culture (_Aedes albopictus_ C6/36 cells and African green monkey Vero cells) and suckling mice. A ZIKV isolate was recovered from the serum sample after one passage in suckling mouse brains 11 days post inoculation. This is the 1st known report of successful isolation of ZIKV from a human clinical sample in Australia. The ZIKV isolate from Tonga 2016 belongs to the Asian lineage.\n\nReference\nPyke AT, et al.

Public health officials are gathering data on the health consequences of the infection, including the rate at which fetuses develop abnormally shrunken heads and brain damage, a birth defect called microcephaly.\n\nAlso on Friday [20 May 2016], the World Health Organization confirmed that the strain of Zika virus in Cape Verde, just off the western coast of Africa, is the same strain that is spreading in Brazil. Almost 200 pregnant women in Cape Verde have been infected, and the virus has been blamed for 3 cases of microcephaly there.\n\nThe rising numbers of pregnant American women testing positive -- Friday's [20 May 2016] figure is more than double the previous count of 113 -- reflect a new case definition used by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention rather than a surge in cases, according to Dr Margaret Honein, the chief of the agency's birth defects division.\n\nNo cases transmitted by mosquito have yet been reported in the 50 states. The number of infected pregnant women in this country began rising dramatically in February [2016], probably reflecting the spread of the Zika virus from Brazil to more countries visited by Americans.\n\nMost of the 279 women are still pregnant, Dr Honein said, and fewer than a dozen have experienced \"adverse outcomes,\" such as stillbirths, microcephaly or other congenital problems. A \"relatively small number\" of the infections clearly resulted from sexual transmission rather than mosquito bites, she added. But in most cases, it was difficult to determine how the women became infected because they had lived in or had traveled to areas where mosquitoes carrying the virus were biting.\n\n[byline: Donald G McNeil, Jr]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[This prospective monitoring is very useful to come up with a more precise estimate of occurrences of fetal malformations in women who were infected with Zika virus during pregnancy. One hopes that the monitoring can continue, as the number of infected pregnant women is likely to increase during the summer travel season, perhaps with additional cases should local transmission of the virus in the USA occur during the upcoming mosquito transmission season.\n\nThe details of the study above, entitled \"Possible Zika virus infection among pregnant women -- United States and Territories, May 2016\", appeared in the 20 May 2016 issue of CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/65/wr/mm6520e1.htm?s_cid=mm6520e1_w). - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[4] Microcephaly studies in mice, monkeys\nDate: Wed 11 May 2016\nSource: Science [edited]\nhttp://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/05/zika-causes-microcephaly-mice\n\n\nBy far the most alarming feature of the Zika virus now marching across South America and the Caribbean is its threat to fetuses. Last month [April 2016], the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention declared that \"a causal relationship\" exists between the virus and brain abnormalities in newborns, most noticeably a small head, known as microcephaly. But just how a mother's infection harms the fetus, and how to prevent the damage, is uncertain.\n\nNew animal models are now pointing to answers. Pregnant monkeys are showing hints of fetal damage. But the most dramatic results come from mice. Mouse studies published this week in Cell and its sister journal Cell Stem Cell and in Nature show precisely how the virus slows fetal growth, damages the brain, and leads to miscarriage. The 2 of them also prove for the 1st time in an animal model that Zika virus can cause microcephaly in fetuses.\n\nTogether, the findings indicate that the virus by itself can wreak havoc, says Michael Diamond, a viral immunologist at Washington University in St Louis in Missouri who led the Cell study. \"Some people feel there are many cofactors like insecticides,\" Diamond says. \"Our study suggests at least you don't have to invoke other things.\" And by providing an animal model for the fetal damage, the studies should also ease the path for testing potential vaccines and treatments.\n\nMice normally cannot sustain a Zika infection because the virus triggers secretion of interferons, molecules that bolster immune responses. Diamond's lab circumvented this problem by creating female mice that had a key interferon gene knocked out; in a 2nd experiment, they treated pregnant animals with an anti-interferon antibody. The team then injected pregnant females with a virus isolated from a person in French Polynesia; the isolate is 99 per cent genetically similar to the one now circulating in Latin America.\n\nIn the knockout mice, the virus replicated to higher levels than in those treated with the antibody, killing most of the fetuses. The researchers found high levels of Zika virus in the placentas -- 1000 times more than in the mother's blood -- supporting the hypothesis that the virus harms the placenta, which, in turn, cuts the blood supply to the fetus, Diamond says.\n\nPregnant mice treated with the antibody still made enough interferon to partially control the infection and allow the pups to survive. Mirroring effects seen in humans, they were born small, a condition known as intrauterine growth restriction.\n\nIn both sets of mice, the virus also turned up in fetal heads, Diamond says, suggesting that it causes brain damage directly as well as by impairing the placenta. That's consistent with earlier in vitro findings that Zika can infect and damage human neural precursor cells. Neither set of pups developed microcephaly, which Diamond says could be because the researchers infected the mothers so early during pregnancy that not much brain development had yet occurred.\n\nThe 2 other mouse experiments, published in Cell Stem Cell and Nature, did document microcephaly. Neither team manipulated their mice to make them more susceptible to the virus. In the Cell Stem Cell study, Zhiheng Xu of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing sidestepped the mice's natural resistance to Zika virus by injecting a Samoan isolate directly into fetal brains. In Nature, Fernanda Cugola of the University of S\u00e3o Paulo in Brazil and co-workers injected a Brazilian isolate into the tails of a strain of mice that are naturally immunocompromised. Diamond notes that the Brazilian-led team injected an \"astronomical amount of virus\" through the intravenous route, which may have sent the virus directly to the placenta and helped dodge the antiviral immune response.\n\nBoth studies found malformations associated with microcephaly, including what's known as cortical thinning and smaller brains. The 2 reports also showed that Zika virus infected and damaged neuronal stem cells harvested from mice and humans. \"If you see consistent phenotypes in different models, the things that are happening are probably important,\" says Guo-li Ming of Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore, Maryland, who led the earlier studies of Zika in human neural progenitor cells.\n\nThe researchers who study these various mouse models acknowledge that they differ from humans in many critical ways. \"It's very difficult to study humans directly,\" Diamond notes. Yet he stresses that these mouse models give insights into pathogenesis and will allow for high-throughput screening of drugs and vaccines against the virus.\n\nMonkeys are naturally infected with Zika virus and are far closer to humans in many ways, and at least a half-dozen studies are under way. In an unusual twist for the primate research community, investigators from 4 US labs have been posting data from their monkey Zika experiments on their websites in near real time, before publication. \"We decided that the best thing for the community was that information be made available as widely as possible and freely available,\" says David O'Connor, whose group at the University of Wisconsin, Madison is furthest along in studying Zika infection of pregnant monkeys.\n\nOne pregnant rhesus macaque that O'Connor's group is following was 50 days post-infection at last report, and a little more than halfway through her pregnancy. Sonograms of the fetus -- which are posted online -- \"sort of\" show evidence that the head circumference is small, but O'Connor and colleagues \"are not drawing too much attention to it,\" he says, because it's not that far outside of the normal range. The group will know for sure after they perform a cesarean section on the mother, which will also let them obtain the placenta, normally eaten by rhesus mothers. \"I hope we can accelerate the information about what's going on in people,\" he says.\n\nO'Connor points out that Zika-infected monkeys do not perfectly reflect humans either, and he sees the various models as complementary. \"We can learn a lot from the fact that pregnancies are quick in the mice, and you can do much larger experiments, but in monkeys, we can do experiments that are much more relevant to human pregnancy,\" he says. \"Clearly, we have a lot of work to do, but these experiments are opening up the possibility that Zika's effects during pregnancy may be much more common than we initially thought.\"\n\n[byline: Jon Cohen]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Although the authors of these various studies point out that the experimental animals -- mice and monkeys -- are different from humans, they may provide some general insights into the pathophysiology of Zika virus infections that can lead to focused observations in human cases that occur in nature. -

epidemiological update\nDate: Thu 19 May 2016\nSource: WHO/PAHO Zika - epidemiological update [edited]\nhttp://www.paho.org/hq/index.php?option=com_docman&task=doc_view&Itemid=270&gid=34701&lang=en\n\n\nTo date, 39 countries and territories have confirmed local, vectorborne transmission of Zika virus in the Region of the Americas since 2015. Since the last Pan American Health Organization/World Health Organization (PAHO/WHO) Zika epidemiological update on 12 May 2016, Argentina has confirmed vectorborne autochthonous transmission of Zika virus.\n\nAs mentioned in previous Zika epidemiological updates, trends observed in the Region of the Americas vary depending on the timing of the epidemic onset and timing of the seasonal period of mosquitoborne diseases. In general, countries and territories where the epidemic started later have exhibited upward trends.\n\nColombia\nFollowing Brazil, Colombia was the 2nd country to report circulation of Zika virus in the Americas in 2015. Cases were initially reported in the Department of Bolivar and then spread to the rest of the country; as of epidemiological week (EW) 18 of 2016, 747 municipalities in the country have reported cases. Between EW 32 of 2015 and to EW 18 of 2016, a bimodal epidemic curve of Zika virus disease cases (suspected and confirmed) was observed. The peaks of the cases occurred in EW 5 of 2016 (6309 cases) and EW 13, 2016 (3609 cases) and have since demonstrated a downward trend.\n\nZika virus disease in pregnant women\nDetection of Zika virus disease in pregnant women is being heightened in countries in the region due to risk of congenital syndrome associated with Zika virus infection. There are 21 countries and territories in the Americas reporting confirmed and suspected cases of Zika virus disease in pregnant women; this number remains the same since the last PAHO/WHO Zika epidemiological update on 12 May 2016.\n\nCountries and territories reporting Zika virus disease in pregnant women:\nBarbados, Dominican Republic, Honduras, Puerto Rico, Brazil, Ecuador, Martinique Saint Martin, Bolivia, El Salvador, Mexico, Venezuela, Colombia, French Guiana, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Guadeloupe, Panama, Dominica, Guatemala, Paraguay.\n\nAcute flaccid paralysis trends in Bolivia\nFollowing the description of historical trends in increasing reports of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) in children under 15 years of age, as seen with Colombia, Ecuador, Guatemala, and Venezuela, the current situation in Bolivia is highlighted below.\n\nCompared to 2015, a slight increase in reported AFP is noted in Bolivia for 2016 as of EW 18. If the notifications continue at the same rate in 2016, a bigger increase in comparison to 2015 can be expected by the end of the year. While AFP is the manifestation of a wide spectrum of diseases, this situation highlights the importance for countries and territories with Zika virus circulation to analyze the trends in reports of AFP and investigate any unusual increase of cases.\n\nOf note, Bolivia, has not reported an increase of GBS cases to date.\n\nHighlighted below are the surveillance results of pregnant women with Zika virus disease in Ecuador and Panama.\n\nEcuador\nBetween EW 52 of 2015 and EW 17 of 2016, Zika virus disease has been laboratory confirmed in 8 pregnant women in Ecuador. Of these women, 4 are in the 2nd trimester of their pregnancy, and 2 are in the 3rd trimester. To date, no occurrences of congenital syndrome associated with Zika virus disease have been registered.\n\nPanama\nSince the beginning of the outbreak in Panama in EW 48 of 2015 until EW 18 of 2016, 31 pregnant women with suspected Zika virus disease have been detected; of those, 16 were laboratory confirmed, and 15 were negative for Zika virus.\n\nAs of EW 18 of 2016, Panama has reported 3 cases of laboratory confirmed congenital syndrome associated with Zika virus infection. The 3 mothers were asymptomatic, with one additional case of fetal death at 32 gestational weeks, all had positive laboratory samples for Zika virus.\n\nCongenital syndrome associated with Zika virus infection\nCountries and territories in the Americas with reported congenital syndrome associated with Zika virus infection:\nBrazil 1384 cases\nColombia 7 cases\nMartinique 3 cases\nPanama 4 cases\nPuerto Rico 1 case\nUnited States 2\n\nBrazil\nAccording to the Ministry of Health of Brazil, between 22 Oct 2015 and 14 May 2016, a total of 7534 suspected cases of microcephaly and other congenital malformation of the central nervous system (CNS) have been reported as per Brazil's Surveillance and Response protocol. Of these, the Brazil Ministry of Health confirmed 1384 cases of microcephaly by clinical, radiological and/or laboratory methods (207 have been confirmed by laboratory criteria). Out of the total reported cases, 2818 cases were discarded as being due to non-infectious causes or not fitting the case definition, and 3332 remain under investigation. The confirmed cases occurred in 499 municipalities, located in 26 out of 27 Federal Units.\n\nBetween EW 3 and EW 19 of 2016, the greatest number of microcephaly cases were confirmed in EW 4 (134 cases). During the same period, the range of cases investigated (confirmed and discarded) were between 80 and 381 (EW 12 and 4, respectively).\n\nGuillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS) and other neurological disorders\nTo date, 7 countries in the region have reported an increase in cases of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS) with at least one case laboratory confirmed for Zika virus. Paraguay continues to report an increase in GBS cases, none of which have laboratory results confirming Zika virus infection; 5 other countries and territories have not recorded increases but identified Zika virus-associated cases of GBS.\n\nIncrease in GBS plus Zika virus lab confirmation in at least one case of GBS\nBrazil, Colombia, Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Honduras, Suriname, Venezuela\n\nZika virus lab confirmation in at least one case of GBS\nFrench Guiana, Haiti, Panama, Puerto Rico, Martinique\n\nIncrease in GBS with no Zika virus lab confirmation in any of the cases\nParaguay\n\nTrend of neurological syndromes in Colombia\nSince 15 Dec 2015 until EW 18 of 2016, there were 517 cases of neurological syndromes reported in Colombia with history of febrile illness consistent with Zika virus infection. Of the total number of neurological syndromes, 65 per cent (335 cases) correspond to GBS. The epidemic curve of neurological syndromes shows a similar distribution to the Zika virus disease cases even though the neurological syndromes began 10 epidemiological weeks later and an elevation 2 weeks prior to the peak of Zika virus disease cases which occurred in EW 5 of 2016.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[2] Cases in various countries:\nAmericas\n\n[Maps showing the location of the affected islands and countries in the Americas mentioned below can be accessed at\nhttp://healthmap.org/promed/p/35574;\nNorth America at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/106;\nCentral America http://healthmap.org/promed/p/39455;\nCaribbean http://www.mapsofworld.com/caribbean-islands/ and\nSouth America at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/6186. - Mod.TY]\n\nCentral America\n---\nBelize. 16 May 2016.

(conf) Zika virus (ZIKV) has been isolated from a female traveler who recently returned from Tonga to Brisbane, Queensland, Australia in 2016. The patient, in her 30s, was diagnosed with Zika virus infection using a ZIKV specific real-time RT-PCR1. The RT-PCR ZIKV positive serum sample was negative for flavivirus serology. A urine sample collected 4 days following the serum sample was also ZIKV RT-PCR positive. Several attempts to isolate virus from both the serum and urine were made using both cell culture (_Aedes albopictus_ C6/36 cells and African green monkey Vero cells) and suckling mice. A ZIKV isolate was recovered from the serum sample after one passage in suckling mouse brains 11 days post inoculation. This is the 1st known report of successful isolation of ZIKV from a human clinical sample in Australia. The ZIKV isolate from Tonga 2016 belongs to the Asian lineage.\n\nReference\nPyke AT, et al.

Public health officials are gathering data on the health consequences of the infection, including the rate at which fetuses develop abnormally shrunken heads and brain damage, a birth defect called microcephaly.\n\nAlso on Friday [20 May 2016], the World Health Organization confirmed that the strain of Zika virus in Cape Verde, just off the western coast of Africa, is the same strain that is spreading in Brazil. Almost 200 pregnant women in Cape Verde have been infected, and the virus has been blamed for 3 cases of microcephaly there.\n\nThe rising numbers of pregnant American women testing positive -- Friday's [20 May 2016] figure is more than double the previous count of 113 -- reflect a new case definition used by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention rather than a surge in cases, according to Dr Margaret Honein, the chief of the agency's birth defects division.\n\nNo cases transmitted by mosquito have yet been reported in the 50 states. The number of infected pregnant women in this country began rising dramatically in February [2016], probably reflecting the spread of the Zika virus from Brazil to more countries visited by Americans.\n\nMost of the 279 women are still pregnant, Dr Honein said, and fewer than a dozen have experienced \"adverse outcomes,\" such as stillbirths, microcephaly or other congenital problems. A \"relatively small number\" of the infections clearly resulted from sexual transmission rather than mosquito bites, she added. But in most cases, it was difficult to determine how the women became infected because they had lived in or had traveled to areas where mosquitoes carrying the virus were biting.\n\n[byline: Donald G McNeil, Jr]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[This prospective monitoring is very useful to come up with a more precise estimate of occurrences of fetal malformations in women who were infected with Zika virus during pregnancy. One hopes that the monitoring can continue, as the number of infected pregnant women is likely to increase during the summer travel season, perhaps with additional cases should local transmission of the virus in the USA occur during the upcoming mosquito transmission season.\n\nThe details of the study above, entitled \"Possible Zika virus infection among pregnant women -- United States and Territories, May 2016\", appeared in the 20 May 2016 issue of CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/65/wr/mm6520e1.htm?s_cid=mm6520e1_w). - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[4] Microcephaly studies in mice, monkeys\nDate: Wed 11 May 2016\nSource: Science [edited]\nhttp://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/05/zika-causes-microcephaly-mice\n\n\nBy far the most alarming feature of the Zika virus now marching across South America and the Caribbean is its threat to fetuses. Last month [April 2016], the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention declared that \"a causal relationship\" exists between the virus and brain abnormalities in newborns, most noticeably a small head, known as microcephaly. But just how a mother's infection harms the fetus, and how to prevent the damage, is uncertain.\n\nNew animal models are now pointing to answers. Pregnant monkeys are showing hints of fetal damage. But the most dramatic results come from mice. Mouse studies published this week in Cell and its sister journal Cell Stem Cell and in Nature show precisely how the virus slows fetal growth, damages the brain, and leads to miscarriage. The 2 of them also prove for the 1st time in an animal model that Zika virus can cause microcephaly in fetuses.\n\nTogether, the findings indicate that the virus by itself can wreak havoc, says Michael Diamond, a viral immunologist at Washington University in St Louis in Missouri who led the Cell study. \"Some people feel there are many cofactors like insecticides,\" Diamond says. \"Our study suggests at least you don't have to invoke other things.\" And by providing an animal model for the fetal damage, the studies should also ease the path for testing potential vaccines and treatments.\n\nMice normally cannot sustain a Zika infection because the virus triggers secretion of interferons, molecules that bolster immune responses. Diamond's lab circumvented this problem by creating female mice that had a key interferon gene knocked out; in a 2nd experiment, they treated pregnant animals with an anti-interferon antibody. The team then injected pregnant females with a virus isolated from a person in French Polynesia; the isolate is 99 per cent genetically similar to the one now circulating in Latin America.\n\nIn the knockout mice, the virus replicated to higher levels than in those treated with the antibody, killing most of the fetuses. The researchers found high levels of Zika virus in the placentas -- 1000 times more than in the mother's blood -- supporting the hypothesis that the virus harms the placenta, which, in turn, cuts the blood supply to the fetus, Diamond says.\n\nPregnant mice treated with the antibody still made enough interferon to partially control the infection and allow the pups to survive. Mirroring effects seen in humans, they were born small, a condition known as intrauterine growth restriction.\n\nIn both sets of mice, the virus also turned up in fetal heads, Diamond says, suggesting that it causes brain damage directly as well as by impairing the placenta. That's consistent with earlier in vitro findings that Zika can infect and damage human neural precursor cells. Neither set of pups developed microcephaly, which Diamond says could be because the researchers infected the mothers so early during pregnancy that not much brain development had yet occurred.\n\nThe 2 other mouse experiments, published in Cell Stem Cell and Nature, did document microcephaly. Neither team manipulated their mice to make them more susceptible to the virus. In the Cell Stem Cell study, Zhiheng Xu of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing sidestepped the mice's natural resistance to Zika virus by injecting a Samoan isolate directly into fetal brains. In Nature, Fernanda Cugola of the University of S\u00e3o Paulo in Brazil and co-workers injected a Brazilian isolate into the tails of a strain of mice that are naturally immunocompromised. Diamond notes that the Brazilian-led team injected an \"astronomical amount of virus\" through the intravenous route, which may have sent the virus directly to the placenta and helped dodge the antiviral immune response.\n\nBoth studies found malformations associated with microcephaly, including what's known as cortical thinning and smaller brains. The 2 reports also showed that Zika virus infected and damaged neuronal stem cells harvested from mice and humans. \"If you see consistent phenotypes in different models, the things that are happening are probably important,\" says Guo-li Ming of Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore, Maryland, who led the earlier studies of Zika in human neural progenitor cells.\n\nThe researchers who study these various mouse models acknowledge that they differ from humans in many critical ways. \"It's very difficult to study humans directly,\" Diamond notes. Yet he stresses that these mouse models give insights into pathogenesis and will allow for high-throughput screening of drugs and vaccines against the virus.\n\nMonkeys are naturally infected with Zika virus and are far closer to humans in many ways, and at least a half-dozen studies are under way. In an unusual twist for the primate research community, investigators from 4 US labs have been posting data from their monkey Zika experiments on their websites in near real time, before publication. \"We decided that the best thing for the community was that information be made available as widely as possible and freely available,\" says David O'Connor, whose group at the University of Wisconsin, Madison is furthest along in studying Zika infection of pregnant monkeys.\n\nOne pregnant rhesus macaque that O'Connor's group is following was 50 days post-infection at last report, and a little more than halfway through her pregnancy. Sonograms of the fetus -- which are posted online -- \"sort of\" show evidence that the head circumference is small, but O'Connor and colleagues \"are not drawing too much attention to it,\" he says, because it's not that far outside of the normal range. The group will know for sure after they perform a cesarean section on the mother, which will also let them obtain the placenta, normally eaten by rhesus mothers. \"I hope we can accelerate the information about what's going on in people,\" he says.\n\nO'Connor points out that Zika-infected monkeys do not perfectly reflect humans either, and he sees the various models as complementary. \"We can learn a lot from the fact that pregnancies are quick in the mice, and you can do much larger experiments, but in monkeys, we can do experiments that are much more relevant to human pregnancy,\" he says. \"Clearly, we have a lot of work to do, but these experiments are opening up the possibility that Zika's effects during pregnancy may be much more common than we initially thought.\"\n\n[byline: Jon Cohen]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Although the authors of these various studies point out that the experimental animals -- mice and monkeys -- are different from humans, they may provide some general insights into the pathophysiology of Zika virus infections that can lead to focused observations in human cases that occur in nature. -

Since the last Pan American Health Organization/World Health Organization (PAHO/WHO) Zika epidemiological update on 12 May 2016, Argentina has confirmed vectorborne autochthonous transmission of Zika virus.\n\nAs mentioned in previous Zika epidemiological updates, trends observed in the Region of the Americas vary depending on the timing of the epidemic onset and timing of the seasonal period of mosquitoborne diseases. In general, countries and territories where the epidemic started later have exhibited upward trends.\n\nColombia\nFollowing Brazil, Colombia was the 2nd country to report circulation of Zika virus in the Americas in 2015. Cases were initially reported in the Department of Bolivar and then spread to the rest of the country; as of epidemiological week (EW) 18 of 2016, 747 municipalities in the country have reported cases. Between EW 32 of 2015 and to EW 18 of 2016, a bimodal epidemic curve of Zika virus disease cases (suspected and confirmed) was observed. The peaks of the cases occurred in EW 5 of 2016 (6309 cases) and EW 13, 2016 (3609 cases) and have since demonstrated a downward trend.\n\nZika virus disease in pregnant women\nDetection of Zika virus disease in pregnant women is being heightened in countries in the region due to risk of congenital syndrome associated with Zika virus infection. There are 21 countries and territories in the Americas reporting confirmed and suspected cases of Zika virus disease in pregnant women; this number remains the same since the last PAHO/WHO Zika epidemiological update on 12 May 2016.\n\nCountries and territories reporting Zika virus disease in pregnant women:\nBarbados, Dominican Republic, Honduras, Puerto Rico, Brazil, Ecuador, Martinique Saint Martin, Bolivia, El Salvador, Mexico, Venezuela, Colombia, French Guiana, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Guadeloupe, Panama, Dominica, Guatemala, Paraguay.\n\nAcute flaccid paralysis trends in Bolivia\nFollowing the description of historical trends in increasing reports of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) in children under 15 years of age, as seen with Colombia, Ecuador, Guatemala, and Venezuela, the current situation in Bolivia is highlighted below.\n\nCompared to 2015, a slight increase in reported AFP is noted in Bolivia for 2016 as of EW 18. If the notifications continue at the same rate in 2016, a bigger increase in comparison to 2015 can be expected by the end of the year. While AFP is the manifestation of a wide spectrum of diseases, this situation highlights the importance for countries and territories with Zika virus circulation to analyze the trends in reports of AFP and investigate any unusual increase of cases.\n\nOf note, Bolivia, has not reported an increase of GBS cases to date.\n\nHighlighted below are the surveillance results of pregnant women with Zika virus disease in Ecuador and Panama.\n\nEcuador\nBetween EW 52 of 2015 and EW 17 of 2016, Zika virus disease has been laboratory confirmed in 8 pregnant women in Ecuador. Of these women, 4 are in the 2nd trimester of their pregnancy, and 2 are in the 3rd trimester. To date, no occurrences of congenital syndrome associated with Zika virus disease have been registered.\n\nPanama\nSince the beginning of the outbreak in Panama in EW 48 of 2015 until EW 18 of 2016, 31 pregnant women with suspected Zika virus disease have been detected; of those, 16 were laboratory confirmed, and 15 were negative for Zika virus.\n\nAs of EW 18 of 2016, Panama has reported 3 cases of laboratory confirmed congenital syndrome associated with Zika virus infection. The 3 mothers were asymptomatic, with one additional case of fetal death at 32 gestational weeks, all had positive laboratory samples for Zika virus.\n\nCongenital syndrome associated with Zika virus infection\nCountries and territories in the Americas with reported congenital syndrome associated with Zika virus infection:\nBrazil 1384 cases\nColombia 7 cases\nMartinique 3 cases\nPanama 4 cases\nPuerto Rico 1 case\nUnited States 2\n\nBrazil\nAccording to the Ministry of Health of Brazil, between 22 Oct 2015 and 14 May 2016, a total of 7534 suspected cases of microcephaly and other congenital malformation of the central nervous system (CNS) have been reported as per Brazil's Surveillance and Response protocol. Of these, the Brazil Ministry of Health confirmed 1384 cases of microcephaly by clinical, radiological and/or laboratory methods (207 have been confirmed by laboratory criteria). Out of the total reported cases, 2818 cases were discarded as being due to non-infectious causes or not fitting the case definition, and 3332 remain under investigation. The confirmed cases occurred in 499 municipalities, located in 26 out of 27 Federal Units.\n\nBetween EW 3 and EW 19 of 2016, the greatest number of microcephaly cases were confirmed in EW 4 (134 cases). During the same period, the range of cases investigated (confirmed and discarded) were between 80 and 381 (EW 12 and 4, respectively).\n\nGuillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS) and other neurological disorders\nTo date, 7 countries in the region have reported an increase in cases of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS) with at least one case laboratory confirmed for Zika virus.

A urine sample collected 4 days following the serum sample was also ZIKV RT-PCR positive. Several attempts to isolate virus from both the serum and urine were made using both cell culture (_Aedes albopictus_ C6/36 cells and African green monkey Vero cells) and suckling mice. A ZIKV isolate was recovered from the serum sample after one passage in suckling mouse brains 11 days post inoculation. This is the 1st known report of successful isolation of ZIKV from a human clinical sample in Australia. The ZIKV isolate from Tonga 2016 belongs to the Asian lineage.\n\nReference\nPyke AT, et al.

Public health officials are gathering data on the health consequences of the infection, including the rate at which fetuses develop abnormally shrunken heads and brain damage, a birth defect called microcephaly.\n\nAlso on Friday [20 May 2016], the World Health Organization confirmed that the strain of Zika virus in Cape Verde, just off the western coast of Africa, is the same strain that is spreading in Brazil. Almost 200 pregnant women in Cape Verde have been infected, and the virus has been blamed for 3 cases of microcephaly there.\n\nThe rising numbers of pregnant American women testing positive -- Friday's [20 May 2016] figure is more than double the previous count of 113 -- reflect a new case definition used by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention rather than a surge in cases, according to Dr Margaret Honein, the chief of the agency's birth defects division.\n\nNo cases transmitted by mosquito have yet been reported in the 50 states. The number of infected pregnant women in this country began rising dramatically in February [2016], probably reflecting the spread of the Zika virus from Brazil to more countries visited by Americans.\n\nMost of the 279 women are still pregnant, Dr Honein said, and fewer than a dozen have experienced \"adverse outcomes,\" such as stillbirths, microcephaly or other congenital problems. A \"relatively small number\" of the infections clearly resulted from sexual transmission rather than mosquito bites, she added. But in most cases, it was difficult to determine how the women became infected because they had lived in or had traveled to areas where mosquitoes carrying the virus were biting.\n\n[byline: Donald G McNeil, Jr]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[This prospective monitoring is very useful to come up with a more precise estimate of occurrences of fetal malformations in women who were infected with Zika virus during pregnancy. One hopes that the monitoring can continue, as the number of infected pregnant women is likely to increase during the summer travel season, perhaps with additional cases should local transmission of the virus in the USA occur during the upcoming mosquito transmission season.\n\nThe details of the study above, entitled \"Possible Zika virus infection among pregnant women -- United States and Territories, May 2016\", appeared in the 20 May 2016 issue of CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/65/wr/mm6520e1.htm?s_cid=mm6520e1_w). - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[4] Microcephaly studies in mice, monkeys\nDate: Wed 11 May 2016\nSource: Science [edited]\nhttp://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/05/zika-causes-microcephaly-mice\n\n\nBy far the most alarming feature of the Zika virus now marching across South America and the Caribbean is its threat to fetuses. Last month [April 2016], the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention declared that \"a causal relationship\" exists between the virus and brain abnormalities in newborns, most noticeably a small head, known as microcephaly. But just how a mother's infection harms the fetus, and how to prevent the damage, is uncertain.\n\nNew animal models are now pointing to answers. Pregnant monkeys are showing hints of fetal damage. But the most dramatic results come from mice. Mouse studies published this week in Cell and its sister journal Cell Stem Cell and in Nature show precisely how the virus slows fetal growth, damages the brain, and leads to miscarriage. The 2 of them also prove for the 1st time in an animal model that Zika virus can cause microcephaly in fetuses.\n\nTogether, the findings indicate that the virus by itself can wreak havoc, says Michael Diamond, a viral immunologist at Washington University in St Louis in Missouri who led the Cell study. \"Some people feel there are many cofactors like insecticides,\" Diamond says. \"Our study suggests at least you don't have to invoke other things.\" And by providing an animal model for the fetal damage, the studies should also ease the path for testing potential vaccines and treatments.\n\nMice normally cannot sustain a Zika infection because the virus triggers secretion of interferons, molecules that bolster immune responses. Diamond's lab circumvented this problem by creating female mice that had a key interferon gene knocked out; in a 2nd experiment, they treated pregnant animals with an anti-interferon antibody. The team then injected pregnant females with a virus isolated from a person in French Polynesia; the isolate is 99 per cent genetically similar to the one now circulating in Latin America.\n\nIn the knockout mice, the virus replicated to higher levels than in those treated with the antibody, killing most of the fetuses. The researchers found high levels of Zika virus in the placentas -- 1000 times more than in the mother's blood -- supporting the hypothesis that the virus harms the placenta, which, in turn, cuts the blood supply to the fetus, Diamond says.\n\nPregnant mice treated with the antibody still made enough interferon to partially control the infection and allow the pups to survive. Mirroring effects seen in humans, they were born small, a condition known as intrauterine growth restriction.\n\nIn both sets of mice, the virus also turned up in fetal heads, Diamond says, suggesting that it causes brain damage directly as well as by impairing the placenta. That's consistent with earlier in vitro findings that Zika can infect and damage human neural precursor cells. Neither set of pups developed microcephaly, which Diamond says could be because the researchers infected the mothers so early during pregnancy that not much brain development had yet occurred.\n\nThe 2 other mouse experiments, published in Cell Stem Cell and Nature, did document microcephaly. Neither team manipulated their mice to make them more susceptible to the virus. In the Cell Stem Cell study, Zhiheng Xu of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing sidestepped the mice's natural resistance to Zika virus by injecting a Samoan isolate directly into fetal brains. In Nature, Fernanda Cugola of the University of S\u00e3o Paulo in Brazil and co-workers injected a Brazilian isolate into the tails of a strain of mice that are naturally immunocompromised. Diamond notes that the Brazilian-led team injected an \"astronomical amount of virus\" through the intravenous route, which may have sent the virus directly to the placenta and helped dodge the antiviral immune response.\n\nBoth studies found malformations associated with microcephaly, including what's known as cortical thinning and smaller brains. The 2 reports also showed that Zika virus infected and damaged neuronal stem cells harvested from mice and humans. \"If you see consistent phenotypes in different models, the things that are happening are probably important,\" says Guo-li Ming of Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore, Maryland, who led the earlier studies of Zika in human neural progenitor cells.\n\nThe researchers who study these various mouse models acknowledge that they differ from humans in many critical ways. \"It's very difficult to study humans directly,\" Diamond notes. Yet he stresses that these mouse models give insights into pathogenesis and will allow for high-throughput screening of drugs and vaccines against the virus.\n\nMonkeys are naturally infected with Zika virus and are far closer to humans in many ways, and at least a half-dozen studies are under way. In an unusual twist for the primate research community, investigators from 4 US labs have been posting data from their monkey Zika experiments on their websites in near real time, before publication. \"We decided that the best thing for the community was that information be made available as widely as possible and freely available,\" says David O'Connor, whose group at the University of Wisconsin, Madison is furthest along in studying Zika infection of pregnant monkeys.\n\nOne pregnant rhesus macaque that O'Connor's group is following was 50 days post-infection at last report, and a little more than halfway through her pregnancy. Sonograms of the fetus -- which are posted online -- \"sort of\" show evidence that the head circumference is small, but O'Connor and colleagues \"are not drawing too much attention to it,\" he says, because it's not that far outside of the normal range. The group will know for sure after they perform a cesarean section on the mother, which will also let them obtain the placenta, normally eaten by rhesus mothers. \"I hope we can accelerate the information about what's going on in people,\" he says.\n\nO'Connor points out that Zika-infected monkeys do not perfectly reflect humans either, and he sees the various models as complementary. \"We can learn a lot from the fact that pregnancies are quick in the mice, and you can do much larger experiments, but in monkeys, we can do experiments that are much more relevant to human pregnancy,\" he says. \"Clearly, we have a lot of work to do, but these experiments are opening up the possibility that Zika's effects during pregnancy may be much more common than we initially thought.\"\n\n[byline: Jon Cohen]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Although the authors of these various studies point out that the experimental animals -- mice and monkeys -- are different from humans, they may provide some general insights into the pathophysiology of Zika virus infections that can lead to focused observations in human cases that occur in nature. -

epidemiological update\nDate: Thu 19 May 2016\nSource: WHO/PAHO Zika - epidemiological update [edited]\nhttp://www.paho.org/hq/index.php?option=com_docman&task=doc_view&Itemid=270&gid=34701&lang=en\n\n\nTo date, 39 countries and territories have confirmed local, vectorborne transmission of Zika virus in the Region of the Americas since 2015. Since the last Pan American Health Organization/World Health Organization (PAHO/WHO) Zika epidemiological update on 12 May 2016, Argentina has confirmed vectorborne autochthonous transmission of Zika virus.\n\nAs mentioned in previous Zika epidemiological updates, trends observed in the Region of the Americas vary depending on the timing of the epidemic onset and timing of the seasonal period of mosquitoborne diseases. In general, countries and territories where the epidemic started later have exhibited upward trends.\n\nColombia\nFollowing Brazil, Colombia was the 2nd country to report circulation of Zika virus in the Americas in 2015. Cases were initially reported in the Department of Bolivar and then spread to the rest of the country; as of epidemiological week (EW) 18 of 2016, 747 municipalities in the country have reported cases. Between EW 32 of 2015 and to EW 18 of 2016, a bimodal epidemic curve of Zika virus disease cases (suspected and confirmed) was observed. The peaks of the cases occurred in EW 5 of 2016 (6309 cases) and EW 13, 2016 (3609 cases) and have since demonstrated a downward trend.\n\nZika virus disease in pregnant women\nDetection of Zika virus disease in pregnant women is being heightened in countries in the region due to risk of congenital syndrome associated with Zika virus infection. There are 21 countries and territories in the Americas reporting confirmed and suspected cases of Zika virus disease in pregnant women; this number remains the same since the last PAHO/WHO Zika epidemiological update on 12 May 2016.\n\nCountries and territories reporting Zika virus disease in pregnant women:\nBarbados, Dominican Republic, Honduras, Puerto Rico, Brazil, Ecuador, Martinique Saint Martin, Bolivia, El Salvador, Mexico, Venezuela, Colombia, French Guiana, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Guadeloupe, Panama, Dominica, Guatemala, Paraguay.\n\nAcute flaccid paralysis trends in Bolivia\nFollowing the description of historical trends in increasing reports of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) in children under 15 years of age, as seen with Colombia, Ecuador, Guatemala, and Venezuela, the current situation in Bolivia is highlighted below.\n\nCompared to 2015, a slight increase in reported AFP is noted in Bolivia for 2016 as of EW 18. If the notifications continue at the same rate in 2016, a bigger increase in comparison to 2015 can be expected by the end of the year. While AFP is the manifestation of a wide spectrum of diseases, this situation highlights the importance for countries and territories with Zika virus circulation to analyze the trends in reports of AFP and investigate any unusual increase of cases.\n\nOf note, Bolivia, has not reported an increase of GBS cases to date.\n\nHighlighted below are the surveillance results of pregnant women with Zika virus disease in Ecuador and Panama.\n\nEcuador\nBetween EW 52 of 2015 and EW 17 of 2016, Zika virus disease has been laboratory confirmed in 8 pregnant women in Ecuador. Of these women, 4 are in the 2nd trimester of their pregnancy, and 2 are in the 3rd trimester. To date, no occurrences of congenital syndrome associated with Zika virus disease have been registered.\n\nPanama\nSince the beginning of the outbreak in Panama in EW 48 of 2015 until EW 18 of 2016, 31 pregnant women with suspected Zika virus disease have been detected; of those, 16 were laboratory confirmed, and 15 were negative for Zika virus.\n\nAs of EW 18 of 2016, Panama has reported 3 cases of laboratory confirmed congenital syndrome associated with Zika virus infection. The 3 mothers were asymptomatic, with one additional case of fetal death at 32 gestational weeks, all had positive laboratory samples for Zika virus.\n\nCongenital syndrome associated with Zika virus infection\nCountries and territories in the Americas with reported congenital syndrome associated with Zika virus infection:\nBrazil 1384 cases\nColombia 7 cases\nMartinique 3 cases\nPanama 4 cases\nPuerto Rico 1 case\nUnited States 2\n\nBrazil\nAccording to the Ministry of Health of Brazil, between 22 Oct 2015 and 14 May 2016, a total of 7534 suspected cases of microcephaly and other congenital malformation of the central nervous system (CNS) have been reported as per Brazil's Surveillance and Response protocol. Of these, the Brazil Ministry of Health confirmed 1384 cases of microcephaly by clinical, radiological and/or laboratory methods (207 have been confirmed by laboratory criteria). Out of the total reported cases, 2818 cases were discarded as being due to non-infectious causes or not fitting the case definition, and 3332 remain under investigation. The confirmed cases occurred in 499 municipalities, located in 26 out of 27 Federal Units.\n\nBetween EW 3 and EW 19 of 2016, the greatest number of microcephaly cases were confirmed in EW 4 (134 cases). During the same period, the range of cases investigated (confirmed and discarded) were between 80 and 381 (EW 12 and 4, respectively).\n\nGuillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS) and other neurological disorders\nTo date, 7 countries in the region have reported an increase in cases of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS) with at least one case laboratory confirmed for Zika virus. Paraguay continues to report an increase in GBS cases, none of which have laboratory results confirming Zika virus infection; 5 other countries and territories have not recorded increases but identified Zika virus-associated cases of GBS.\n\nIncrease in GBS plus Zika virus lab confirmation in at least one case of GBS\nBrazil, Colombia, Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Honduras, Suriname, Venezuela\n\nZika virus lab confirmation in at least one case of GBS\nFrench Guiana, Haiti, Panama, Puerto Rico, Martinique\n\nIncrease in GBS with no Zika virus lab confirmation in any of the cases\nParaguay\n\nTrend of neurological syndromes in Colombia\nSince 15 Dec 2015 until EW 18 of 2016, there were 517 cases of neurological syndromes reported in Colombia with history of febrile illness consistent with Zika virus infection. Of the total number of neurological syndromes, 65 per cent (335 cases) correspond to GBS. The epidemic curve of neurological syndromes shows a similar distribution to the Zika virus disease cases even though the neurological syndromes began 10 epidemiological weeks later and an elevation 2 weeks prior to the peak of Zika virus disease cases which occurred in EW 5 of 2016.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[2] Cases in various countries:\nAmericas\n\n[Maps showing the location of the affected islands and countries in the Americas mentioned below can be accessed at\nhttp://healthmap.org/promed/p/35574;\nNorth America at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/106;\nCentral America http://healthmap.org/promed/p/39455;\nCaribbean http://www.mapsofworld.com/caribbean-islands/ and\nSouth America at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/6186. - Mod.TY]\n\nCentral America\n---\nBelize. 16 May 2016.

(conf) Zika virus (ZIKV) has been isolated from a female traveler who recently returned from Tonga to Brisbane, Queensland, Australia in 2016. The patient, in her 30s, was diagnosed with Zika virus infection using a ZIKV specific real-time RT-PCR1. The RT-PCR ZIKV positive serum sample was negative for flavivirus serology. A urine sample collected 4 days following the serum sample was also ZIKV RT-PCR positive. Several attempts to isolate virus from both the serum and urine were made using both cell culture (_Aedes albopictus_ C6/36 cells and African green monkey Vero cells) and suckling mice. A ZIKV isolate was recovered from the serum sample after one passage in suckling mouse brains 11 days post inoculation. This is the 1st known report of successful isolation of ZIKV from a human clinical sample in Australia. The ZIKV isolate from Tonga 2016 belongs to the Asian lineage.\n\nReference\nPyke AT, et al.

Public health officials are gathering data on the health consequences of the infection, including the rate at which fetuses develop abnormally shrunken heads and brain damage, a birth defect called microcephaly.\n\nAlso on Friday [20 May 2016], the World Health Organization confirmed that the strain of Zika virus in Cape Verde, just off the western coast of Africa, is the same strain that is spreading in Brazil. Almost 200 pregnant women in Cape Verde have been infected, and the virus has been blamed for 3 cases of microcephaly there.\n\nThe rising numbers of pregnant American women testing positive -- Friday's [20 May 2016] figure is more than double the previous count of 113 -- reflect a new case definition used by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention rather than a surge in cases, according to Dr Margaret Honein, the chief of the agency's birth defects division.\n\nNo cases transmitted by mosquito have yet been reported in the 50 states. The number of infected pregnant women in this country began rising dramatically in February [2016], probably reflecting the spread of the Zika virus from Brazil to more countries visited by Americans.\n\nMost of the 279 women are still pregnant, Dr Honein said, and fewer than a dozen have experienced \"adverse outcomes,\" such as stillbirths, microcephaly or other congenital problems. A \"relatively small number\" of the infections clearly resulted from sexual transmission rather than mosquito bites, she added. But in most cases, it was difficult to determine how the women became infected because they had lived in or had traveled to areas where mosquitoes carrying the virus were biting.\n\n[byline: Donald G McNeil, Jr]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[This prospective monitoring is very useful to come up with a more precise estimate of occurrences of fetal malformations in women who were infected with Zika virus during pregnancy. One hopes that the monitoring can continue, as the number of infected pregnant women is likely to increase during the summer travel season, perhaps with additional cases should local transmission of the virus in the USA occur during the upcoming mosquito transmission season.\n\nThe details of the study above, entitled \"Possible Zika virus infection among pregnant women -- United States and Territories, May 2016\", appeared in the 20 May 2016 issue of CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/65/wr/mm6520e1.htm?s_cid=mm6520e1_w). - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[4] Microcephaly studies in mice, monkeys\nDate: Wed 11 May 2016\nSource: Science [edited]\nhttp://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/05/zika-causes-microcephaly-mice\n\n\nBy far the most alarming feature of the Zika virus now marching across South America and the Caribbean is its threat to fetuses. Last month [April 2016], the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention declared that \"a causal relationship\" exists between the virus and brain abnormalities in newborns, most noticeably a small head, known as microcephaly. But just how a mother's infection harms the fetus, and how to prevent the damage, is uncertain.\n\nNew animal models are now pointing to answers. Pregnant monkeys are showing hints of fetal damage. But the most dramatic results come from mice. Mouse studies published this week in Cell and its sister journal Cell Stem Cell and in Nature show precisely how the virus slows fetal growth, damages the brain, and leads to miscarriage. The 2 of them also prove for the 1st time in an animal model that Zika virus can cause microcephaly in fetuses.\n\nTogether, the findings indicate that the virus by itself can wreak havoc, says Michael Diamond, a viral immunologist at Washington University in St Louis in Missouri who led the Cell study. \"Some people feel there are many cofactors like insecticides,\" Diamond says. \"Our study suggests at least you don't have to invoke other things.\" And by providing an animal model for the fetal damage, the studies should also ease the path for testing potential vaccines and treatments.\n\nMice normally cannot sustain a Zika infection because the virus triggers secretion of interferons, molecules that bolster immune responses. Diamond's lab circumvented this problem by creating female mice that had a key interferon gene knocked out; in a 2nd experiment, they treated pregnant animals with an anti-interferon antibody. The team then injected pregnant females with a virus isolated from a person in French Polynesia; the isolate is 99 per cent genetically similar to the one now circulating in Latin America.\n\nIn the knockout mice, the virus replicated to higher levels than in those treated with the antibody, killing most of the fetuses. The researchers found high levels of Zika virus in the placentas -- 1000 times more than in the mother's blood -- supporting the hypothesis that the virus harms the placenta, which, in turn, cuts the blood supply to the fetus, Diamond says.\n\nPregnant mice treated with the antibody still made enough interferon to partially control the infection and allow the pups to survive. Mirroring effects seen in humans, they were born small, a condition known as intrauterine growth restriction.\n\nIn both sets of mice, the virus also turned up in fetal heads, Diamond says, suggesting that it causes brain damage directly as well as by impairing the placenta. That's consistent with earlier in vitro findings that Zika can infect and damage human neural precursor cells. Neither set of pups developed microcephaly, which Diamond says could be because the researchers infected the mothers so early during pregnancy that not much brain development had yet occurred.\n\nThe 2 other mouse experiments, published in Cell Stem Cell and Nature, did document microcephaly. Neither team manipulated their mice to make them more susceptible to the virus. In the Cell Stem Cell study, Zhiheng Xu of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing sidestepped the mice's natural resistance to Zika virus by injecting a Samoan isolate directly into fetal brains. In Nature, Fernanda Cugola of the University of S\u00e3o Paulo in Brazil and co-workers injected a Brazilian isolate into the tails of a strain of mice that are naturally immunocompromised. Diamond notes that the Brazilian-led team injected an \"astronomical amount of virus\" through the intravenous route, which may have sent the virus directly to the placenta and helped dodge the antiviral immune response.\n\nBoth studies found malformations associated with microcephaly, including what's known as cortical thinning and smaller brains. The 2 reports also showed that Zika virus infected and damaged neuronal stem cells harvested from mice and humans. \"If you see consistent phenotypes in different models, the things that are happening are probably important,\" says Guo-li Ming of Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore, Maryland, who led the earlier studies of Zika in human neural progenitor cells.\n\nThe researchers who study these various mouse models acknowledge that they differ from humans in many critical ways. \"It's very difficult to study humans directly,\" Diamond notes. Yet he stresses that these mouse models give insights into pathogenesis and will allow for high-throughput screening of drugs and vaccines against the virus.\n\nMonkeys are naturally infected with Zika virus and are far closer to humans in many ways, and at least a half-dozen studies are under way. In an unusual twist for the primate research community, investigators from 4 US labs have been posting data from their monkey Zika experiments on their websites in near real time, before publication. \"We decided that the best thing for the community was that information be made available as widely as possible and freely available,\" says David O'Connor, whose group at the University of Wisconsin, Madison is furthest along in studying Zika infection of pregnant monkeys.\n\nOne pregnant rhesus macaque that O'Connor's group is following was 50 days post-infection at last report, and a little more than halfway through her pregnancy. Sonograms of the fetus -- which are posted online -- \"sort of\" show evidence that the head circumference is small, but O'Connor and colleagues \"are not drawing too much attention to it,\" he says, because it's not that far outside of the normal range. The group will know for sure after they perform a cesarean section on the mother, which will also let them obtain the placenta, normally eaten by rhesus mothers. \"I hope we can accelerate the information about what's going on in people,\" he says.\n\nO'Connor points out that Zika-infected monkeys do not perfectly reflect humans either, and he sees the various models as complementary. \"We can learn a lot from the fact that pregnancies are quick in the mice, and you can do much larger experiments, but in monkeys, we can do experiments that are much more relevant to human pregnancy,\" he says. \"Clearly, we have a lot of work to do, but these experiments are opening up the possibility that Zika's effects during pregnancy may be much more common than we initially thought.\"\n\n[byline: Jon Cohen]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Although the authors of these various studies point out that the experimental animals -- mice and monkeys -- are different from humans, they may provide some general insights into the pathophysiology of Zika virus infections that can lead to focused observations in human cases that occur in nature. -

Zika Virus and Birth Defects -- Reviewing the Evidence for Causality.\n\nSummary\n-------\nThe Zika virus has spread rapidly in the Americas since its 1st identification in Brazil in early 2015. Prenatal Zika virus infection has been linked to adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes, most notably microcephaly and other serious brain anomalies. To determine whether Zika virus infection during pregnancy causes these adverse outcomes, we evaluated available data using criteria that have been proposed for the assessment of potential teratogens. On the basis of this review, we conclude that a causal relationship exists between prenatal Zika virus infection and microcephaly and other serious brain anomalies. Evidence that was used to support this causal relationship included Zika virus infection at times during prenatal development that were consistent with the defects observed; a specific, rare phenotype involving microcephaly and associated brain anomalies in fetuses or infants with presumed or confirmed congenital Zika virus infection; and data that strongly support biologic plausibility, including the identification of Zika virus in the brain tissue of affected fetuses and infants. Given the recognition of this causal relationship, we need to intensify our efforts toward the prevention of adverse outcomes caused by congenital Zika virus infection. However, many questions that are critical to our prevention efforts remain, including the spectrum of defects caused by prenatal Zika virus infection, the degree of relative and absolute risks of adverse outcomes among fetuses whose mothers were infected at different times during pregnancy, and factors that might affect a woman's risk of adverse pregnancy or birth outcomes. Addressing these questions will improve our ability to reduce the burden of the effects of Zika virus infection during pregnancy.\n\n[Sections in the full article include:\n- Potential relationship between Zika virus infection and birth defects\n- Shepard's criteria\n- Other criteria\n- Assessment of criteria]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n[This paper presents an interesting counterpoint to the paper entitled \"Convicting Zika\" in the previous Zika virus: Americas update (ProMED-mail archive no. 20160411.4152933). That paper cautions that microcephaly has many causes, of which Zika is potentially just one. According to WHO, these include infection (e.g. toxoplasmosis, rubella, herpes, syphilis, cytomegalovirus, and HIV), exposure to toxic agents, alcohol, genetic abnormalities, and severe malnutrition during pregnancy. However, the above NEJM paper makes a strong case for Zika virus' causality. The USA CDC agrees that Zika virus infections can cause microcephaly. - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[3] _Aedes albopictus_ as vectors, Europe\nDate: Thu 14 Apr 2016\nSource: Euro Surveill. 21(15):pii=30199.

Assessing the potential risk of Zika virus epidemics in temperate areas with established Aedes albopictus populations.\n\nSummary\n-------\nBased on 2015 abundance of _Aedes albopictus_ in 9 northern Italian municipalities with temperate continental/oceanic climate, we estimated the basic reproductive number R0 for Zika virus (ZIKV) to be systematically below the epidemic threshold in most scenarios. Results were sensitive to the value of the probability of mosquito infection after biting a viraemic host. Therefore, further studies are required to improve models and predictions, namely evaluating vector competence and potential non-vector transmissions.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n[The geographic distribution of _Ae. albopictus_ may well influence the areas that are at risk of Zika virus transmission to humans. These assessments will be difficult to quantify until the vector efficiency of this mosquito for Zika viruses in those areas is established and its feeding preferences are known. - Mod.TY]\nSee Also\nZika virus (19): Americas 20160411.4152933\nZika virus (18): Americas 20160402.4134955\nZika virus (17): Americas, Pacific 20160401.4129524\nZika virus (16): Americas, Asia, Pacific, Atlantic 20160325.4118019\nZika virus (15): Americas 20160321.4109160\nZika virus (14): Americas, Europe, Atlantic Ocean 20160317.4102468\nZika virus (13): Americas, Asia, Europe, Pacific 20160311.4086075\nZika virus (12): Brazil, microcephaly 20160305.4070601\nZika virus (11): Americas, Europe, Asia 20160301.4059896\nZika virus (10): Americas, Asia, Europe, Pacific 20160229.4058161\nZika virus (09): Americas, Africa, Europe, Pacific 20160223.4042828\nZika virus (08): Americas, Asia, Europe, Pacific 20160217.4026836\nZika virus (07): update 20160216.4023810\nProMED-mail endorses sharing of Zika virus data 20160211.4012212\nZika virus (06): overview 20160209.4007411\nZika virus (05): Americas, Asia, Pacific 20160203.3990632\nZika virus (04): WHO declares worldwide PHEIC 20160201.3985366\nZika virus (03): Americas, Asia 20160128.3974426\nZika virus -

Zika Virus and Birth Defects -- Reviewing the Evidence for Causality.\n\nSummary\n-------\nThe Zika virus has spread rapidly in the Americas since its 1st identification in Brazil in early 2015. Prenatal Zika virus infection has been linked to adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes, most notably microcephaly and other serious brain anomalies. To determine whether Zika virus infection during pregnancy causes these adverse outcomes, we evaluated available data using criteria that have been proposed for the assessment of potential teratogens. On the basis of this review, we conclude that a causal relationship exists between prenatal Zika virus infection and microcephaly and other serious brain anomalies. Evidence that was used to support this causal relationship included Zika virus infection at times during prenatal development that were consistent with the defects observed; a specific, rare phenotype involving microcephaly and associated brain anomalies in fetuses or infants with presumed or confirmed congenital Zika virus infection; and data that strongly support biologic plausibility, including the identification of Zika virus in the brain tissue of affected fetuses and infants. Given the recognition of this causal relationship, we need to intensify our efforts toward the prevention of adverse outcomes caused by congenital Zika virus infection. However, many questions that are critical to our prevention efforts remain, including the spectrum of defects caused by prenatal Zika virus infection, the degree of relative and absolute risks of adverse outcomes among fetuses whose mothers were infected at different times during pregnancy, and factors that might affect a woman's risk of adverse pregnancy or birth outcomes. Addressing these questions will improve our ability to reduce the burden of the effects of Zika virus infection during pregnancy.\n\n[Sections in the full article include:\n- Potential relationship between Zika virus infection and birth defects\n- Shepard's criteria\n- Other criteria\n- Assessment of criteria]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n[This paper presents an interesting counterpoint to the paper entitled \"Convicting Zika\" in the previous Zika virus: Americas update (ProMED-mail archive no. 20160411.4152933). That paper cautions that microcephaly has many causes, of which Zika is potentially just one. According to WHO, these include infection (e.g. toxoplasmosis, rubella, herpes, syphilis, cytomegalovirus, and HIV), exposure to toxic agents, alcohol, genetic abnormalities, and severe malnutrition during pregnancy. However, the above NEJM paper makes a strong case for Zika virus' causality. The USA CDC agrees that Zika virus infections can cause microcephaly. - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[3] _Aedes albopictus_ as vectors, Europe\nDate: Thu 14 Apr 2016\nSource: Euro Surveill. 21(15):pii=30199.

Assessing the potential risk of Zika virus epidemics in temperate areas with established Aedes albopictus populations.\n\nSummary\n-------\nBased on 2015 abundance of _Aedes albopictus_ in 9 northern Italian municipalities with temperate continental/oceanic climate, we estimated the basic reproductive number R0 for Zika virus (ZIKV) to be systematically below the epidemic threshold in most scenarios. Results were sensitive to the value of the probability of mosquito infection after biting a viraemic host. Therefore, further studies are required to improve models and predictions, namely evaluating vector competence and potential non-vector transmissions.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n[The geographic distribution of _Ae. albopictus_ may well influence the areas that are at risk of Zika virus transmission to humans. These assessments will be difficult to quantify until the vector efficiency of this mosquito for Zika viruses in those areas is established and its feeding preferences are known. - Mod.TY]\nSee Also\nZika virus (19): Americas 20160411.4152933\nZika virus (18): Americas 20160402.4134955\nZika virus (17): Americas, Pacific 20160401.4129524\nZika virus (16): Americas, Asia, Pacific, Atlantic 20160325.4118019\nZika virus (15): Americas 20160321.4109160\nZika virus (14): Americas, Europe, Atlantic Ocean 20160317.4102468\nZika virus (13): Americas, Asia, Europe, Pacific 20160311.4086075\nZika virus (12): Brazil, microcephaly 20160305.4070601\nZika virus (11): Americas, Europe, Asia 20160301.4059896\nZika virus (10): Americas, Asia, Europe, Pacific 20160229.4058161\nZika virus (09): Americas, Africa, Europe, Pacific 20160223.4042828\nZika virus (08): Americas, Asia, Europe, Pacific 20160217.4026836\nZika virus (07): update 20160216.4023810\nProMED-mail endorses sharing of Zika virus data 20160211.4012212\nZika virus (06): overview 20160209.4007411\nZika virus (05): Americas, Asia, Pacific 20160203.3990632\nZika virus (04): WHO declares worldwide PHEIC 20160201.3985366\nZika virus (03): Americas, Asia 20160128.3974426\nZika virus -

Zika Virus and Birth Defects -- Reviewing the Evidence for Causality.\n\nSummary\n-------\nThe Zika virus has spread rapidly in the Americas since its 1st identification in Brazil in early 2015. Prenatal Zika virus infection has been linked to adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes, most notably microcephaly and other serious brain anomalies. To determine whether Zika virus infection during pregnancy causes these adverse outcomes, we evaluated available data using criteria that have been proposed for the assessment of potential teratogens. On the basis of this review, we conclude that a causal relationship exists between prenatal Zika virus infection and microcephaly and other serious brain anomalies. Evidence that was used to support this causal relationship included Zika virus infection at times during prenatal development that were consistent with the defects observed; a specific, rare phenotype involving microcephaly and associated brain anomalies in fetuses or infants with presumed or confirmed congenital Zika virus infection; and data that strongly support biologic plausibility, including the identification of Zika virus in the brain tissue of affected fetuses and infants. Given the recognition of this causal relationship, we need to intensify our efforts toward the prevention of adverse outcomes caused by congenital Zika virus infection. However, many questions that are critical to our prevention efforts remain, including the spectrum of defects caused by prenatal Zika virus infection, the degree of relative and absolute risks of adverse outcomes among fetuses whose mothers were infected at different times during pregnancy, and factors that might affect a woman's risk of adverse pregnancy or birth outcomes. Addressing these questions will improve our ability to reduce the burden of the effects of Zika virus infection during pregnancy.\n\n[Sections in the full article include:\n- Potential relationship between Zika virus infection and birth defects\n- Shepard's criteria\n- Other criteria\n- Assessment of criteria]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n[This paper presents an interesting counterpoint to the paper entitled \"Convicting Zika\" in the previous Zika virus: Americas update (ProMED-mail archive no. 20160411.4152933). That paper cautions that microcephaly has many causes, of which Zika is potentially just one. According to WHO, these include infection (e.g. toxoplasmosis, rubella, herpes, syphilis, cytomegalovirus, and HIV), exposure to toxic agents, alcohol, genetic abnormalities, and severe malnutrition during pregnancy. However, the above NEJM paper makes a strong case for Zika virus' causality. The USA CDC agrees that Zika virus infections can cause microcephaly. - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[3] _Aedes albopictus_ as vectors, Europe\nDate: Thu 14 Apr 2016\nSource: Euro Surveill. 21(15):pii=30199.

Assessing the potential risk of Zika virus epidemics in temperate areas with established Aedes albopictus populations.\n\nSummary\n-------\nBased on 2015 abundance of _Aedes albopictus_ in 9 northern Italian municipalities with temperate continental/oceanic climate, we estimated the basic reproductive number R0 for Zika virus (ZIKV) to be systematically below the epidemic threshold in most scenarios. Results were sensitive to the value of the probability of mosquito infection after biting a viraemic host. Therefore, further studies are required to improve models and predictions, namely evaluating vector competence and potential non-vector transmissions.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n[The geographic distribution of _Ae. albopictus_ may well influence the areas that are at risk of Zika virus transmission to humans. These assessments will be difficult to quantify until the vector efficiency of this mosquito for Zika viruses in those areas is established and its feeding preferences are known. - Mod.TY]\nSee Also\nZika virus (19): Americas 20160411.4152933\nZika virus (18): Americas 20160402.4134955\nZika virus (17): Americas, Pacific 20160401.4129524\nZika virus (16): Americas, Asia, Pacific, Atlantic 20160325.4118019\nZika virus (15): Americas 20160321.4109160\nZika virus (14): Americas, Europe, Atlantic Ocean 20160317.4102468\nZika virus (13): Americas, Asia, Europe, Pacific 20160311.4086075\nZika virus (12): Brazil, microcephaly 20160305.4070601\nZika virus (11): Americas, Europe, Asia 20160301.4059896\nZika virus (10): Americas, Asia, Europe, Pacific 20160229.4058161\nZika virus (09): Americas, Africa, Europe, Pacific 20160223.4042828\nZika virus (08): Americas, Asia, Europe, Pacific 20160217.4026836\nZika virus (07): update 20160216.4023810\nProMED-mail endorses sharing of Zika virus data 20160211.4012212\nZika virus (06): overview 20160209.4007411\nZika virus (05): Americas, Asia, Pacific 20160203.3990632\nZika virus (04): WHO declares worldwide PHEIC 20160201.3985366\nZika virus (03): Americas, Asia 20160128.3974426\nZika virus -

Zika Virus and Birth Defects -- Reviewing the Evidence for Causality.\n\nSummary\n-------\nThe Zika virus has spread rapidly in the Americas since its 1st identification in Brazil in early 2015. Prenatal Zika virus infection has been linked to adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes, most notably microcephaly and other serious brain anomalies. To determine whether Zika virus infection during pregnancy causes these adverse outcomes, we evaluated available data using criteria that have been proposed for the assessment of potential teratogens. On the basis of this review, we conclude that a causal relationship exists between prenatal Zika virus infection and microcephaly and other serious brain anomalies. Evidence that was used to support this causal relationship included Zika virus infection at times during prenatal development that were consistent with the defects observed; a specific, rare phenotype involving microcephaly and associated brain anomalies in fetuses or infants with presumed or confirmed congenital Zika virus infection; and data that strongly support biologic plausibility, including the identification of Zika virus in the brain tissue of affected fetuses and infants. Given the recognition of this causal relationship, we need to intensify our efforts toward the prevention of adverse outcomes caused by congenital Zika virus infection. However, many questions that are critical to our prevention efforts remain, including the spectrum of defects caused by prenatal Zika virus infection, the degree of relative and absolute risks of adverse outcomes among fetuses whose mothers were infected at different times during pregnancy, and factors that might affect a woman's risk of adverse pregnancy or birth outcomes. Addressing these questions will improve our ability to reduce the burden of the effects of Zika virus infection during pregnancy.\n\n[Sections in the full article include:\n- Potential relationship between Zika virus infection and birth defects\n- Shepard's criteria\n- Other criteria\n- Assessment of criteria]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n[This paper presents an interesting counterpoint to the paper entitled \"Convicting Zika\" in the previous Zika virus: Americas update (ProMED-mail archive no. 20160411.4152933). That paper cautions that microcephaly has many causes, of which Zika is potentially just one. According to WHO, these include infection (e.g. toxoplasmosis, rubella, herpes, syphilis, cytomegalovirus, and HIV), exposure to toxic agents, alcohol, genetic abnormalities, and severe malnutrition during pregnancy. However, the above NEJM paper makes a strong case for Zika virus' causality.

Assessing the potential risk of Zika virus epidemics in temperate areas with established Aedes albopictus populations.\n\nSummary\n-------\nBased on 2015 abundance of _Aedes albopictus_ in 9 northern Italian municipalities with temperate continental/oceanic climate, we estimated the basic reproductive number R0 for Zika virus (ZIKV) to be systematically below the epidemic threshold in most scenarios. Results were sensitive to the value of the probability of mosquito infection after biting a viraemic host. Therefore, further studies are required to improve models and predictions, namely evaluating vector competence and potential non-vector transmissions.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n[The geographic distribution of _Ae. albopictus_ may well influence the areas that are at risk of Zika virus transmission to humans.

Zika Virus and Birth Defects -- Reviewing the Evidence for Causality.\n\nSummary\n-------\nThe Zika virus has spread rapidly in the Americas since its 1st identification in Brazil in early 2015. Prenatal Zika virus infection has been linked to adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes, most notably microcephaly and other serious brain anomalies. To determine whether Zika virus infection during pregnancy causes these adverse outcomes, we evaluated available data using criteria that have been proposed for the assessment of potential teratogens. On the basis of this review, we conclude that a causal relationship exists between prenatal Zika virus infection and microcephaly and other serious brain anomalies. Evidence that was used to support this causal relationship included Zika virus infection at times during prenatal development that were consistent with the defects observed; a specific, rare phenotype involving microcephaly and associated brain anomalies in fetuses or infants with presumed or confirmed congenital Zika virus infection; and data that strongly support biologic plausibility, including the identification of Zika virus in the brain tissue of affected fetuses and infants. Given the recognition of this causal relationship, we need to intensify our efforts toward the prevention of adverse outcomes caused by congenital Zika virus infection. However, many questions that are critical to our prevention efforts remain, including the spectrum of defects caused by prenatal Zika virus infection, the degree of relative and absolute risks of adverse outcomes among fetuses whose mothers were infected at different times during pregnancy, and factors that might affect a woman's risk of adverse pregnancy or birth outcomes. Addressing these questions will improve our ability to reduce the burden of the effects of Zika virus infection during pregnancy.\n\n[Sections in the full article include:\n- Potential relationship between Zika virus infection and birth defects\n- Shepard's criteria\n- Other criteria\n- Assessment of criteria]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n[This paper presents an interesting counterpoint to the paper entitled \"Convicting Zika\" in the previous Zika virus: Americas update (ProMED-mail archive no. 20160411.4152933). That paper cautions that microcephaly has many causes, of which Zika is potentially just one. According to WHO, these include infection (e.g. toxoplasmosis, rubella, herpes, syphilis, cytomegalovirus, and HIV), exposure to toxic agents, alcohol, genetic abnormalities, and severe malnutrition during pregnancy. However, the above NEJM paper makes a strong case for Zika virus' causality.

Zika Virus and Birth Defects -- Reviewing the Evidence for Causality.\n\nSummary\n-------\nThe Zika virus has spread rapidly in the Americas since its 1st identification in Brazil in early 2015. Prenatal Zika virus infection has been linked to adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes, most notably microcephaly and other serious brain anomalies. To determine whether Zika virus infection during pregnancy causes these adverse outcomes, we evaluated available data using criteria that have been proposed for the assessment of potential teratogens. On the basis of this review, we conclude that a causal relationship exists between prenatal Zika virus infection and microcephaly and other serious brain anomalies. Evidence that was used to support this causal relationship included Zika virus infection at times during prenatal development that were consistent with the defects observed; a specific, rare phenotype involving microcephaly and associated brain anomalies in fetuses or infants with presumed or confirmed congenital Zika virus infection; and data that strongly support biologic plausibility, including the identification of Zika virus in the brain tissue of affected fetuses and infants. Given the recognition of this causal relationship, we need to intensify our efforts toward the prevention of adverse outcomes caused by congenital Zika virus infection. However, many questions that are critical to our prevention efforts remain, including the spectrum of defects caused by prenatal Zika virus infection, the degree of relative and absolute risks of adverse outcomes among fetuses whose mothers were infected at different times during pregnancy, and factors that might affect a woman's risk of adverse pregnancy or birth outcomes. Addressing these questions will improve our ability to reduce the burden of the effects of Zika virus infection during pregnancy.\n\n[Sections in the full article include:\n- Potential relationship between Zika virus infection and birth defects\n- Shepard's criteria\n- Other criteria\n- Assessment of criteria]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n[This paper presents an interesting counterpoint to the paper entitled \"Convicting Zika\" in the previous Zika virus: Americas update (ProMED-mail archive no. 20160411.4152933). That paper cautions that microcephaly has many causes, of which Zika is potentially just one. According to WHO, these include infection (e.g. toxoplasmosis, rubella, herpes, syphilis, cytomegalovirus, and HIV), exposure to toxic agents, alcohol, genetic abnormalities, and severe malnutrition during pregnancy. However, the above NEJM paper makes a strong case for Zika virus' causality. The USA CDC agrees that Zika virus infections can cause microcephaly. - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[3] _Aedes albopictus_ as vectors, Europe\nDate: Thu 14 Apr 2016\nSource: Euro Surveill. 21(15):pii=30199.

Zika Virus and Birth Defects -- Reviewing the Evidence for Causality.\n\nSummary\n-------\nThe Zika virus has spread rapidly in the Americas since its 1st identification in Brazil in early 2015. Prenatal Zika virus infection has been linked to adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes, most notably microcephaly and other serious brain anomalies. To determine whether Zika virus infection during pregnancy causes these adverse outcomes, we evaluated available data using criteria that have been proposed for the assessment of potential teratogens. On the basis of this review, we conclude that a causal relationship exists between prenatal Zika virus infection and microcephaly and other serious brain anomalies. Evidence that was used to support this causal relationship included Zika virus infection at times during prenatal development that were consistent with the defects observed; a specific, rare phenotype involving microcephaly and associated brain anomalies in fetuses or infants with presumed or confirmed congenital Zika virus infection; and data that strongly support biologic plausibility, including the identification of Zika virus in the brain tissue of affected fetuses and infants. Given the recognition of this causal relationship, we need to intensify our efforts toward the prevention of adverse outcomes caused by congenital Zika virus infection. However, many questions that are critical to our prevention efforts remain, including the spectrum of defects caused by prenatal Zika virus infection, the degree of relative and absolute risks of adverse outcomes among fetuses whose mothers were infected at different times during pregnancy, and factors that might affect a woman's risk of adverse pregnancy or birth outcomes. Addressing these questions will improve our ability to reduce the burden of the effects of Zika virus infection during pregnancy.\n\n[Sections in the full article include:\n- Potential relationship between Zika virus infection and birth defects\n- Shepard's criteria\n- Other criteria\n- Assessment of criteria]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n[This paper presents an interesting counterpoint to the paper entitled \"Convicting Zika\" in the previous Zika virus: Americas update (ProMED-mail archive no. 20160411.4152933). That paper cautions that microcephaly has many causes, of which Zika is potentially just one. According to WHO, these include infection (e.g. toxoplasmosis, rubella, herpes, syphilis, cytomegalovirus, and HIV), exposure to toxic agents, alcohol, genetic abnormalities, and severe malnutrition during pregnancy. However, the above NEJM paper makes a strong case for Zika virus' causality. The USA CDC agrees that Zika virus infections can cause microcephaly. - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[3] _Aedes albopictus_ as vectors, Europe\nDate: Thu 14 Apr 2016\nSource: Euro Surveill. 21(15):pii=30199.

Assessing the potential risk of Zika virus epidemics in temperate areas with established Aedes albopictus populations.\n\nSummary\n-------\nBased on 2015 abundance of _Aedes albopictus_ in 9 northern Italian municipalities with temperate continental/oceanic climate, we estimated the basic reproductive number R0 for Zika virus (ZIKV) to be systematically below the epidemic threshold in most scenarios. Results were sensitive to the value of the probability of mosquito infection after biting a viraemic host. Therefore, further studies are required to improve models and predictions, namely evaluating vector competence and potential non-vector transmissions.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n[The geographic distribution of _Ae. albopictus_ may well influence the areas that are at risk of Zika virus transmission to humans. These assessments will be difficult to quantify until the vector efficiency of this mosquito for Zika viruses in those areas is established and its feeding preferences are known. - Mod.TY]\nSee Also\nZika virus (19): Americas 20160411.4152933\nZika virus (18): Americas 20160402.4134955\nZika virus (17): Americas, Pacific 20160401.4129524\nZika virus (16): Americas, Asia, Pacific, Atlantic 20160325.4118019\nZika virus (15): Americas 20160321.4109160\nZika virus (14): Americas, Europe, Atlantic Ocean 20160317.4102468\nZika virus (13): Americas, Asia, Europe, Pacific 20160311.4086075\nZika virus (12): Brazil, microcephaly 20160305.4070601\nZika virus (11): Americas, Europe, Asia 20160301.4059896\nZika virus (10): Americas, Asia, Europe, Pacific 20160229.4058161\nZika virus (09): Americas, Africa, Europe, Pacific 20160223.4042828\nZika virus (08): Americas, Asia, Europe, Pacific 20160217.4026836\nZika virus (07): update 20160216.4023810\nProMED-mail endorses sharing of Zika virus data 20160211.4012212\nZika virus (06): overview 20160209.4007411\nZika virus (05): Americas, Asia, Pacific 20160203.3990632\nZika virus (04): WHO declares worldwide PHEIC 20160201.3985366\nZika virus (03): Americas, Asia 20160128.3974426\nZika virus -

Zika Virus and Birth Defects -- Reviewing the Evidence for Causality.\n\nSummary\n-------\nThe Zika virus has spread rapidly in the Americas since its 1st identification in Brazil in early 2015. Prenatal Zika virus infection has been linked to adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes, most notably microcephaly and other serious brain anomalies. To determine whether Zika virus infection during pregnancy causes these adverse outcomes, we evaluated available data using criteria that have been proposed for the assessment of potential teratogens. On the basis of this review, we conclude that a causal relationship exists between prenatal Zika virus infection and microcephaly and other serious brain anomalies. Evidence that was used to support this causal relationship included Zika virus infection at times during prenatal development that were consistent with the defects observed; a specific, rare phenotype involving microcephaly and associated brain anomalies in fetuses or infants with presumed or confirmed congenital Zika virus infection; and data that strongly support biologic plausibility, including the identification of Zika virus in the brain tissue of affected fetuses and infants. Given the recognition of this causal relationship, we need to intensify our efforts toward the prevention of adverse outcomes caused by congenital Zika virus infection. However, many questions that are critical to our prevention efforts remain, including the spectrum of defects caused by prenatal Zika virus infection, the degree of relative and absolute risks of adverse outcomes among fetuses whose mothers were infected at different times during pregnancy, and factors that might affect a woman's risk of adverse pregnancy or birth outcomes. Addressing these questions will improve our ability to reduce the burden of the effects of Zika virus infection during pregnancy.\n\n[Sections in the full article include:\n- Potential relationship between Zika virus infection and birth defects\n- Shepard's criteria\n- Other criteria\n- Assessment of criteria]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n[This paper presents an interesting counterpoint to the paper entitled \"Convicting Zika\" in the previous Zika virus: Americas update (ProMED-mail archive no. 20160411.4152933). That paper cautions that microcephaly has many causes, of which Zika is potentially just one. According to WHO, these include infection (e.g. toxoplasmosis, rubella, herpes, syphilis, cytomegalovirus, and HIV), exposure to toxic agents, alcohol, genetic abnormalities, and severe malnutrition during pregnancy. However, the above NEJM paper makes a strong case for Zika virus' causality. The USA CDC agrees that Zika virus infections can cause microcephaly. - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[3] _Aedes albopictus_ as vectors, Europe\nDate: Thu 14 Apr 2016\nSource: Euro Surveill. 21(15):pii=30199.

Assessing the potential risk of Zika virus epidemics in temperate areas with established Aedes albopictus populations.\n\nSummary\n-------\nBased on 2015 abundance of _Aedes albopictus_ in 9 northern Italian municipalities with temperate continental/oceanic climate, we estimated the basic reproductive number R0 for Zika virus (ZIKV) to be systematically below the epidemic threshold in most scenarios. Results were sensitive to the value of the probability of mosquito infection after biting a viraemic host. Therefore, further studies are required to improve models and predictions, namely evaluating vector competence and potential non-vector transmissions.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n[The geographic distribution of _Ae. albopictus_ may well influence the areas that are at risk of Zika virus transmission to humans. These assessments will be difficult to quantify until the vector efficiency of this mosquito for Zika viruses in those areas is established and its feeding preferences are known. - Mod.TY]\nSee Also\nZika virus (19): Americas 20160411.4152933\nZika virus (18): Americas 20160402.4134955\nZika virus (17): Americas, Pacific 20160401.4129524\nZika virus (16): Americas, Asia, Pacific, Atlantic 20160325.4118019\nZika virus (15): Americas 20160321.4109160\nZika virus (14): Americas, Europe, Atlantic Ocean 20160317.4102468\nZika virus (13): Americas, Asia, Europe, Pacific 20160311.4086075\nZika virus (12): Brazil, microcephaly 20160305.4070601\nZika virus (11): Americas, Europe, Asia 20160301.4059896\nZika virus (10): Americas, Asia, Europe, Pacific 20160229.4058161\nZika virus (09): Americas, Africa, Europe, Pacific 20160223.4042828\nZika virus (08): Americas, Asia, Europe, Pacific 20160217.4026836\nZika virus (07): update 20160216.4023810\nProMED-mail endorses sharing of Zika virus data 20160211.4012212\nZika virus (06): overview 20160209.4007411\nZika virus (05): Americas, Asia, Pacific 20160203.3990632\nZika virus (04): WHO declares worldwide PHEIC 20160201.3985366\nZika virus (03): Americas, Asia 20160128.3974426\nZika virus -

This represents 71.5 percent of cases notified.\n\nThe new report released on Tuesday (1 [Mar 2016]) points out, also, that 1046 notified cases have been discarded and 641 confirmed for microcephaly and other nervous system changes suggestive of [some] congenital infection.\n\nBy 27 Feb [2016], in all, 5909 suspected cases of microcephaly were recorded [reported]. The 641 confirmed cases occurred in 250 municipalities located in 15 Brazilian states: Alagoas, Bahia, Cear\u00e1, Maranh\u00e3o, Para\u00edba, Pernambuco, Piau\u00ed, Rio Grande do Norte, Esp\u00edrito Santo, Rio de Janeiro, Par\u00e1, Rond\u00f4nia, Goi\u00e1s, Mato Grosso do Sul and Rio Grande do Sul.\n\nThe 1046 cases were discarded based on normal complementary investigation [including transfontanel ultrasound and/or brain tomography], or in face of cases of microcephaly and/or central nervous system abnormalities not related to [congenital] infectious causes.\n\nNote that the Ministry of Health is investigating all microcephaly and[/or] other central nervous system disorder cases reported by the states and the possible link with the virus Zika and[/or] other congenital infections. Microcephaly may have the cause of various infectious agents beyond Zika such as syphilis, toxoplasmosis, rubella, cytomegalovirus and herpesvirus.\n\nAccording to the report, the 5909 cases that were reported since the beginning of investigations on 22 Oct last year [2015] were recorded in 1143 municipalities in 25 Brazilian states.\n\nThe Northeast region has 81 percent of reported cases, and Pernambuco continues with the greatest number of cases that remain under investigation (1672), followed by the states of Bahia (817), Para\u00edba (810), Rio Grande do Norte (383), Cear\u00e1 (352), Rio de Janeiro (261), Alagoas (222), Sergipe (192) and Maranhao (192).\n\nIn all, 139 deaths were reported as related to microcephaly and/or alteration of the central nervous system after birth (stillbirth) or during pregnancy (miscarriage or stillbirth). Of these, 31 were confirmed as microcephaly and / or central nervous system abnormalities. Another 96 are still under investigation and 12 have been not confirmed.\n\nOf the total confirmed cases of microcephaly, 82 were reported by specific laboratory criteria for Zika virus. However, the Ministry of Health points out that this figure does not represent suitably the total number of instances related to virus. The Ministry considers that there was Zika infection in the most mothers who had babies with a final diagnosis of microcephaly.\n\nTo date, there are 22 Brazilian states with autochthonous circulation [and potential transmission] of Zika virus: Goi\u00e1s, Minas Gerais, Federal District, Mato Grosso do Sul, Roraima, Amazonas, Par\u00e1, Rond\u00f4nia, Mato Grosso, Tocantins, Maranhao, Piaui, Ceara, Rio Grande do Norte, Paraiba, Pernambuco, Alagoas, Bahia, Espirito Santo, Rio de Janeiro, S\u00e3o Paulo and Paran\u00e1.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-PORT\nhttp://www.promedmail.org/pt\n\n[According the Ministry of Health of Brazil, the definition of criteria, including the confirmed and discarded, are the following:\n\n- \"Total cumulative reported cases from 2015 to 2016 (5909 cases)\": \"cumulative number of reported cases that met the previous operating case definitions (less than 33 cm) and the adopted in Surveillance Protocol (by 9 Dec 2015) that defined the head circumference 32 cm for newborns with 37 or more weeks of gestation and other protocol settings.\"\n\n- \"Investigated and confirmed (641 cases)\": \"The cases have typical changes: indicative of congenital infection, as intracranial calcifications, dilation of cerebral ventricles or changes in the posterior fossa and other clinical signs observed by any image diagnostic method or Zika virus identification in laboratory tests.\" \"82 cases were confirmed by specific laboratory testing for Zika virus (serology or PCR).\"\n\n- \"Investigated and discarded (1046 cases)\": discarded by normal exams or because presenting microcephaly and/or congenital malformations related by non-infectious causes or not framed in case definitions. - Mod.RNA]\n\n[A map showing the location of the states mentioned can be accessed at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/6. - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[2] Rio de Janeiro cases\nDate: Fri 4 Mar 2016\nSource: The New England Journal of Medicine DOI: 10.1056/NEJMoa1602412 [edited]\nhttp://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1602412\n\n\nPatr\u00edcia Brasil, M.D., Jose P.

To characterize the spectrum of ZIKV disease in pregnancy, we followed patients in Rio de Janeiro to describe clinical manifestations in mothers and repercussions of acute ZIKV infection in fetuses.\n\nMethods\n-------\nWe enrolled pregnant women in whom a rash had developed within the previous 5 days and tested blood and urine specimens for ZIKV by reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction assays. We followed the women prospectively and collected clinical and ultrasonographic data.\n\nResults\n-------\nA total of 88 women were enrolled from September 2015 through February 2016; of these 88 women, 72 (82 percent) tested positive for ZIKV in blood, urine, or both. The timing of acute ZIKV infection ranged from 5 to 38 weeks of gestation. Predominant clinical features included pruritic descending macular or maculopapular rash, arthralgias, conjunctival injection, and headache; 28 percent had fever (short-term and low-grade). Women who were positive for ZIKV were more likely than those who were negative for the virus to have maculopapular rash (44 percent vs. 12 percent, P=0.02), conjunctival involvement (58 percent vs. 13 percent, P=0.002), and lymphadenopathy (40 percent vs. 7 percent, P=0.02). Fetal ultrasonography was performed in 42 ZIKV-positive women (58 percent) and in all ZIKV-negative women. Fetal abnormalities were detected by Doppler ultrasonography in 12 of the 42 ZIKV-positive women (29 percent) and in none of the 16 ZIKV-negative women. Adverse findings included fetal deaths at 36 and 38 weeks of gestation (2 fetuses), in utero growth restriction with or without microcephaly (5 fetuses), ventricular calcifications or other central nervous system (CNS) lesions (7 fetuses), and abnormal amniotic fluid volume or cerebral or umbilical artery flow (7 fetuses). To date, 8 of the 42 women in whom fetal ultrasonography was performed have delivered their babies, and the ultrasonographic findings have been confirmed.\n\nConclusions\n-----------\nDespite mild clinical symptoms, ZIKV infection during pregnancy appears to be associated with grave outcomes, including fetal death, placental insufficiency, fetal growth restriction, and CNS injury.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nRoland Hubner\nSuperior Health Council\nBrussels\nBelgium\n<roland.hubner@sante.belgique.be>\n\n[This report provides additional evidence strengthening the relationship between Zika virus infections of pregnant women and fetal malformations. - Mod.TY\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/6.]\nSee Also\nZika virus (11): Americas, Europe, Asia 20160301.4059896\nZika virus (10): Americas, Asia, Europe, Pacific 20160229.4058161\nZika virus (09): Americas, Africa, Europe, Pacific 20160223.4042828\nZika virus (08): Americas, Asia, Europe, Pacific 20160217.4026836\nZika virus (07): update 20160216.4023810\nProMED-mail endorses sharing of Zika virus data 20160211.4012212\nZika virus (06): overview 20160209.4007411\nZika virus (05): Americas, Asia, Pacific 20160203.3990632\nZika virus (04): WHO declares worldwide PHEIC 20160201.3985366\nZika virus (03): Americas, Asia 20160128.3974426\nZika virus - Americas (02) 20160111.3925377\nZika virus - Americas (01) 20160108.3921447\n.................................................rna/jw/dk/ty/je/dk", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "rubella", "zika"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2016-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-16 00:00:00", "2016-03-16 00:00:00", "1046-03-16 00:00:00", "2016-03-16 00:00:00", "1046-03-16 00:00:00", "5909-03-16 00:00:00", "1143-03-16 00:00:00", "1672-03-16 00:00:00", "5909-03-16 00:00:00", "2015-12-16 00:00:00", "1046-03-16 00:00:00", "2016-03-16 00:00:00", "2015-09-16 00:00:00", "2016-02-16 00:00:00", "1972-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-08 00:00:00", "2021-03-07 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Microcephaly", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "M.S.", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Alagoas", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Paran\u00e1", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Machado Siqueira", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Roraima", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "BRAZIL", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Rond\u00f4nia", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Pernambuco", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Maranh\u00e3o", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Cear\u00e1", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Brussels", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Rio de Janeiro", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Background", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "microcephaly", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Para\u00edba", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Belgium", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Jr.", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Brazil", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "M.D.", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Bahia", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Rio Grande", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Amazonas", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "4134955", "headline": "PRO/EDR> Zika virus (18): Americas", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=4134955", "date": "2016-03-05 10:58:57", "main_text": "ZIKA VIRUS (12): BRAZIL, MICROCEPHALY\n*************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nNew microcephaly reports:\n[1] Brazil-wide\n[2] Rio de Janeiro cases\n\n******\n[1] Brazil-wide\nDate: Wed 2 Mar 2016\nSource: Brazil Ministry of Health [in Portuguese, trans.

This represents 71.5 percent of cases notified.\n\nThe new report released on Tuesday (1 [Mar 2016]) points out, also, that 1046 notified cases have been discarded and 641 confirmed for microcephaly and other nervous system changes suggestive of [some] congenital infection.\n\nBy 27 Feb [2016], in all, 5909 suspected cases of microcephaly were recorded [reported]. The 641 confirmed cases occurred in 250 municipalities located in 15 Brazilian states: Alagoas, Bahia, Cear\u00e1, Maranh\u00e3o, Para\u00edba, Pernambuco, Piau\u00ed, Rio Grande do Norte, Esp\u00edrito Santo, Rio de Janeiro, Par\u00e1, Rond\u00f4nia, Goi\u00e1s, Mato Grosso do Sul and Rio Grande do Sul.\n\nThe 1046 cases were discarded based on normal complementary investigation [including transfontanel ultrasound and/or brain tomography], or in face of cases of microcephaly and/or central nervous system abnormalities not related to [congenital] infectious causes.\n\nNote that the Ministry of Health is investigating all microcephaly and[/or] other central nervous system disorder cases reported by the states and the possible link with the virus Zika and[/or] other congenital infections. Microcephaly may have the cause of various infectious agents beyond Zika such as syphilis, toxoplasmosis, rubella, cytomegalovirus and herpesvirus.\n\nAccording to the report, the 5909 cases that were reported since the beginning of investigations on 22 Oct last year [2015] were recorded in 1143 municipalities in 25 Brazilian states.\n\nThe Northeast region has 81 percent of reported cases, and Pernambuco continues with the greatest number of cases that remain under investigation (1672), followed by the states of Bahia (817), Para\u00edba (810), Rio Grande do Norte (383), Cear\u00e1 (352), Rio de Janeiro (261), Alagoas (222), Sergipe (192) and Maranhao (192).\n\nIn all, 139 deaths were reported as related to microcephaly and/or alteration of the central nervous system after birth (stillbirth) or during pregnancy (miscarriage or stillbirth). Of these, 31 were confirmed as microcephaly and / or central nervous system abnormalities. Another 96 are still under investigation and 12 have been not confirmed.\n\nOf the total confirmed cases of microcephaly, 82 were reported by specific laboratory criteria for Zika virus. However, the Ministry of Health points out that this figure does not represent suitably the total number of instances related to virus. The Ministry considers that there was Zika infection in the most mothers who had babies with a final diagnosis of microcephaly.\n\nTo date, there are 22 Brazilian states with autochthonous circulation [and potential transmission] of Zika virus: Goi\u00e1s, Minas Gerais, Federal District, Mato Grosso do Sul, Roraima, Amazonas, Par\u00e1, Rond\u00f4nia, Mato Grosso, Tocantins, Maranhao, Piaui, Ceara, Rio Grande do Norte, Paraiba, Pernambuco, Alagoas, Bahia, Espirito Santo, Rio de Janeiro, S\u00e3o Paulo and Paran\u00e1.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-PORT\nhttp://www.promedmail.org/pt\n\n[According the Ministry of Health of Brazil, the definition of criteria, including the confirmed and discarded, are the following:\n\n- \"Total cumulative reported cases from 2015 to 2016 (5909 cases)\": \"cumulative number of reported cases that met the previous operating case definitions (less than 33 cm) and the adopted in Surveillance Protocol (by 9 Dec 2015) that defined the head circumference 32 cm for newborns with 37 or more weeks of gestation and other protocol settings.\"\n\n- \"Investigated and confirmed (641 cases)\": \"The cases have typical changes: indicative of congenital infection, as intracranial calcifications, dilation of cerebral ventricles or changes in the posterior fossa and other clinical signs observed by any image diagnostic method or Zika virus identification in laboratory tests.\" \"82 cases were confirmed by specific laboratory testing for Zika virus (serology or PCR).\"\n\n- \"Investigated and discarded (1046 cases)\": discarded by normal exams or because presenting microcephaly and/or congenital malformations related by non-infectious causes or not framed in case definitions. - Mod.RNA]\n\n[A map showing the location of the states mentioned can be accessed at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/6. - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[2] Rio de Janeiro cases\nDate: Fri 4 Mar 2016\nSource: The New England Journal of Medicine DOI: 10.1056/NEJMoa1602412 [edited]\nhttp://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1602412\n\n\nPatr\u00edcia Brasil, M.D., Jose P.

To characterize the spectrum of ZIKV disease in pregnancy, we followed patients in Rio de Janeiro to describe clinical manifestations in mothers and repercussions of acute ZIKV infection in fetuses.\n\nMethods\n-------\nWe enrolled pregnant women in whom a rash had developed within the previous 5 days and tested blood and urine specimens for ZIKV by reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction assays. We followed the women prospectively and collected clinical and ultrasonographic data.\n\nResults\n-------\nA total of 88 women were enrolled from September 2015 through February 2016; of these 88 women, 72 (82 percent) tested positive for ZIKV in blood, urine, or both. The timing of acute ZIKV infection ranged from 5 to 38 weeks of gestation. Predominant clinical features included pruritic descending macular or maculopapular rash, arthralgias, conjunctival injection, and headache; 28 percent had fever (short-term and low-grade). Women who were positive for ZIKV were more likely than those who were negative for the virus to have maculopapular rash (44 percent vs. 12 percent, P=0.02), conjunctival involvement (58 percent vs. 13 percent, P=0.002), and lymphadenopathy (40 percent vs. 7 percent, P=0.02). Fetal ultrasonography was performed in 42 ZIKV-positive women (58 percent) and in all ZIKV-negative women.

This represents 71.5 percent of cases notified.\n\nThe new report released on Tuesday (1 [Mar 2016]) points out, also, that 1046 notified cases have been discarded and 641 confirmed for microcephaly and other nervous system changes suggestive of [some] congenital infection.\n\nBy 27 Feb [2016], in all, 5909 suspected cases of microcephaly were recorded [reported]. The 641 confirmed cases occurred in 250 municipalities located in 15 Brazilian states: Alagoas, Bahia, Cear\u00e1, Maranh\u00e3o, Para\u00edba, Pernambuco, Piau\u00ed, Rio Grande do Norte, Esp\u00edrito Santo, Rio de Janeiro, Par\u00e1, Rond\u00f4nia, Goi\u00e1s, Mato Grosso do Sul and Rio Grande do Sul.\n\nThe 1046 cases were discarded based on normal complementary investigation [including transfontanel ultrasound and/or brain tomography], or in face of cases of microcephaly and/or central nervous system abnormalities not related to [congenital] infectious causes.\n\nNote that the Ministry of Health is investigating all microcephaly and[/or] other central nervous system disorder cases reported by the states and the possible link with the virus Zika and[/or] other congenital infections. Microcephaly may have the cause of various infectious agents beyond Zika such as syphilis, toxoplasmosis, rubella, cytomegalovirus and herpesvirus.\n\nAccording to the report, the 5909 cases that were reported since the beginning of investigations on 22 Oct last year [2015] were recorded in 1143 municipalities in 25 Brazilian states.\n\nThe Northeast region has 81 percent of reported cases, and Pernambuco continues with the greatest number of cases that remain under investigation (1672), followed by the states of Bahia (817), Para\u00edba (810), Rio Grande do Norte (383), Cear\u00e1 (352), Rio de Janeiro (261), Alagoas (222), Sergipe (192) and Maranhao (192).\n\nIn all, 139 deaths were reported as related to microcephaly and/or alteration of the central nervous system after birth (stillbirth) or during pregnancy (miscarriage or stillbirth). Of these, 31 were confirmed as microcephaly and / or central nervous system abnormalities. Another 96 are still under investigation and 12 have been not confirmed.\n\nOf the total confirmed cases of microcephaly, 82 were reported by specific laboratory criteria for Zika virus. However, the Ministry of Health points out that this figure does not represent suitably the total number of instances related to virus. The Ministry considers that there was Zika infection in the most mothers who had babies with a final diagnosis of microcephaly.\n\nTo date, there are 22 Brazilian states with autochthonous circulation [and potential transmission] of Zika virus: Goi\u00e1s, Minas Gerais, Federal District, Mato Grosso do Sul, Roraima, Amazonas, Par\u00e1, Rond\u00f4nia, Mato Grosso, Tocantins, Maranhao, Piaui, Ceara, Rio Grande do Norte, Paraiba, Pernambuco, Alagoas, Bahia, Espirito Santo, Rio de Janeiro, S\u00e3o Paulo and Paran\u00e1.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-PORT\nhttp://www.promedmail.org/pt\n\n[According the Ministry of Health of Brazil, the definition of criteria, including the confirmed and discarded, are the following:\n\n- \"Total cumulative reported cases from 2015 to 2016 (5909 cases)\": \"cumulative number of reported cases that met the previous operating case definitions (less than 33 cm) and the adopted in Surveillance Protocol (by 9 Dec 2015) that defined the head circumference 32 cm for newborns with 37 or more weeks of gestation and other protocol settings.\"\n\n- \"Investigated and confirmed (641 cases)\": \"The cases have typical changes: indicative of congenital infection, as intracranial calcifications, dilation of cerebral ventricles or changes in the posterior fossa and other clinical signs observed by any image diagnostic method or Zika virus identification in laboratory tests.\" \"82 cases were confirmed by specific laboratory testing for Zika virus (serology or PCR).\"\n\n- \"Investigated and discarded (1046 cases)\": discarded by normal exams or because presenting microcephaly and/or congenital malformations related by non-infectious causes or not framed in case definitions. - Mod.RNA]\n\n[A map showing the location of the states mentioned can be accessed at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/6. - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[2] Rio de Janeiro cases\nDate: Fri 4 Mar 2016\nSource: The New England Journal of Medicine DOI: 10.1056/NEJMoa1602412 [edited]\nhttp://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1602412\n\n\nPatr\u00edcia Brasil, M.D., Jose P.

To characterize the spectrum of ZIKV disease in pregnancy, we followed patients in Rio de Janeiro to describe clinical manifestations in mothers and repercussions of acute ZIKV infection in fetuses.\n\nMethods\n-------\nWe enrolled pregnant women in whom a rash had developed within the previous 5 days and tested blood and urine specimens for ZIKV by reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction assays. We followed the women prospectively and collected clinical and ultrasonographic data.\n\nResults\n-------\nA total of 88 women were enrolled from September 2015 through February 2016; of these 88 women, 72 (82 percent) tested positive for ZIKV in blood, urine, or both. The timing of acute ZIKV infection ranged from 5 to 38 weeks of gestation. Predominant clinical features included pruritic descending macular or maculopapular rash, arthralgias, conjunctival injection, and headache; 28 percent had fever (short-term and low-grade). Women who were positive for ZIKV were more likely than those who were negative for the virus to have maculopapular rash (44 percent vs. 12 percent, P=0.02), conjunctival involvement (58 percent vs. 13 percent, P=0.002), and lymphadenopathy (40 percent vs. 7 percent, P=0.02). Fetal ultrasonography was performed in 42 ZIKV-positive women (58 percent) and in all ZIKV-negative women.

This represents 71.5 percent of cases notified.\n\nThe new report released on Tuesday (1 [Mar 2016]) points out, also, that 1046 notified cases have been discarded and 641 confirmed for microcephaly and other nervous system changes suggestive of [some] congenital infection.\n\nBy 27 Feb [2016], in all, 5909 suspected cases of microcephaly were recorded [reported]. The 641 confirmed cases occurred in 250 municipalities located in 15 Brazilian states: Alagoas, Bahia, Cear\u00e1, Maranh\u00e3o, Para\u00edba, Pernambuco, Piau\u00ed, Rio Grande do Norte, Esp\u00edrito Santo, Rio de Janeiro, Par\u00e1, Rond\u00f4nia, Goi\u00e1s, Mato Grosso do Sul and Rio Grande do Sul.\n\nThe 1046 cases were discarded based on normal complementary investigation [including transfontanel ultrasound and/or brain tomography], or in face of cases of microcephaly and/or central nervous system abnormalities not related to [congenital] infectious causes.\n\nNote that the Ministry of Health is investigating all microcephaly and[/or] other central nervous system disorder cases reported by the states and the possible link with the virus Zika and[/or] other congenital infections. Microcephaly may have the cause of various infectious agents beyond Zika such as syphilis, toxoplasmosis, rubella, cytomegalovirus and herpesvirus.\n\nAccording to the report, the 5909 cases that were reported since the beginning of investigations on 22 Oct last year [2015] were recorded in 1143 municipalities in 25 Brazilian states.\n\nThe Northeast region has 81 percent of reported cases, and Pernambuco continues with the greatest number of cases that remain under investigation (1672), followed by the states of Bahia (817), Para\u00edba (810), Rio Grande do Norte (383), Cear\u00e1 (352), Rio de Janeiro (261), Alagoas (222), Sergipe (192) and Maranhao (192).\n\nIn all, 139 deaths were reported as related to microcephaly and/or alteration of the central nervous system after birth (stillbirth) or during pregnancy (miscarriage or stillbirth). Of these, 31 were confirmed as microcephaly and / or central nervous system abnormalities. Another 96 are still under investigation and 12 have been not confirmed.\n\nOf the total confirmed cases of microcephaly, 82 were reported by specific laboratory criteria for Zika virus. However, the Ministry of Health points out that this figure does not represent suitably the total number of instances related to virus. The Ministry considers that there was Zika infection in the most mothers who had babies with a final diagnosis of microcephaly.\n\nTo date, there are 22 Brazilian states with autochthonous circulation [and potential transmission] of Zika virus: Goi\u00e1s, Minas Gerais, Federal District, Mato Grosso do Sul, Roraima, Amazonas, Par\u00e1, Rond\u00f4nia, Mato Grosso, Tocantins, Maranhao, Piaui, Ceara, Rio Grande do Norte, Paraiba, Pernambuco, Alagoas, Bahia, Espirito Santo, Rio de Janeiro, S\u00e3o Paulo and Paran\u00e1.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-PORT\nhttp://www.promedmail.org/pt\n\n[According the Ministry of Health of Brazil, the definition of criteria, including the confirmed and discarded, are the following:\n\n- \"Total cumulative reported cases from 2015 to 2016 (5909 cases)\": \"cumulative number of reported cases that met the previous operating case definitions (less than 33 cm) and the adopted in Surveillance Protocol (by 9 Dec 2015) that defined the head circumference 32 cm for newborns with 37 or more weeks of gestation and other protocol settings.\"\n\n- \"Investigated and confirmed (641 cases)\": \"The cases have typical changes: indicative of congenital infection, as intracranial calcifications, dilation of cerebral ventricles or changes in the posterior fossa and other clinical signs observed by any image diagnostic method or Zika virus identification in laboratory tests.\" \"82 cases were confirmed by specific laboratory testing for Zika virus (serology or PCR).\"\n\n- \"Investigated and discarded (1046 cases)\": discarded by normal exams or because presenting microcephaly and/or congenital malformations related by non-infectious causes or not framed in case definitions. - Mod.RNA]\n\n[A map showing the location of the states mentioned can be accessed at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/6. - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[2] Rio de Janeiro cases\nDate: Fri 4 Mar 2016\nSource: The New England Journal of Medicine DOI: 10.1056/NEJMoa1602412 [edited]\nhttp://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1602412\n\n\nPatr\u00edcia Brasil, M.D., Jose P.

To characterize the spectrum of ZIKV disease in pregnancy, we followed patients in Rio de Janeiro to describe clinical manifestations in mothers and repercussions of acute ZIKV infection in fetuses.\n\nMethods\n-------\nWe enrolled pregnant women in whom a rash had developed within the previous 5 days and tested blood and urine specimens for ZIKV by reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction assays. We followed the women prospectively and collected clinical and ultrasonographic data.\n\nResults\n-------\nA total of 88 women were enrolled from September 2015 through February 2016; of these 88 women, 72 (82 percent) tested positive for ZIKV in blood, urine, or both. The timing of acute ZIKV infection ranged from 5 to 38 weeks of gestation. Predominant clinical features included pruritic descending macular or maculopapular rash, arthralgias, conjunctival injection, and headache; 28 percent had fever (short-term and low-grade). Women who were positive for ZIKV were more likely than those who were negative for the virus to have maculopapular rash (44 percent vs. 12 percent, P=0.02), conjunctival involvement (58 percent vs. 13 percent, P=0.002), and lymphadenopathy (40 percent vs. 7 percent, P=0.02). Fetal ultrasonography was performed in 42 ZIKV-positive women (58 percent) and in all ZIKV-negative women.

To date, 8 of the 42 women in whom fetal ultrasonography was performed have delivered their babies, and the ultrasonographic findings have been confirmed.\n\nConclusions\n-----------\nDespite mild clinical symptoms, ZIKV infection during pregnancy appears to be associated with grave outcomes, including fetal death, placental insufficiency, fetal growth restriction, and CNS injury.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nRoland Hubner\nSuperior Health Council\nBrussels\nBelgium\n<roland.hubner@sante.belgique.be>\n\n[This report provides additional evidence strengthening the relationship between Zika virus infections of pregnant women and fetal malformations. - Mod.TY\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/6.]\nSee Also\nZika virus (11): Americas, Europe, Asia 20160301.4059896\nZika virus (10): Americas, Asia, Europe, Pacific 20160229.4058161\nZika virus (09): Americas, Africa, Europe, Pacific 20160223.4042828\nZika virus (08): Americas, Asia, Europe, Pacific 20160217.4026836\nZika virus (07): update 20160216.4023810\nProMED-mail endorses sharing of Zika virus data 20160211.4012212\nZika virus (06): overview 20160209.4007411\nZika virus (05): Americas, Asia, Pacific 20160203.3990632\nZika virus (04): WHO declares worldwide PHEIC 20160201.3985366\nZika virus (03): Americas, Asia 20160128.3974426\nZika virus - Americas (02) 20160111.3925377\nZika virus - Americas (01) 20160108.3921447\n.................................................rna/jw/dk/ty/je/dk", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "rubella", "zika"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2016-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-16 00:00:00", "2016-03-16 00:00:00", "1046-03-16 00:00:00", "2016-03-16 00:00:00", "1046-03-16 00:00:00", "5909-03-16 00:00:00", "1143-03-16 00:00:00", "1672-03-16 00:00:00", "5909-03-16 00:00:00", "2015-12-16 00:00:00", "1046-03-16 00:00:00", "2016-03-16 00:00:00", "2015-09-16 00:00:00", "2016-02-16 00:00:00", "1972-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-08 00:00:00", "2021-03-07 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Microcephaly", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "M.S.", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Alagoas", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Paran\u00e1", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Machado Siqueira", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Roraima", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "BRAZIL", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Rond\u00f4nia", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Pernambuco", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Maranh\u00e3o", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Cear\u00e1", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Brussels", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Rio de Janeiro", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Background", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "microcephaly", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Para\u00edba", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Belgium", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Jr.", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Brazil", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "M.D.", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Bahia", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Rio Grande", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Amazonas", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "4059896", "headline": "PRO/EDR> Zika virus (11): Americas, Europe, Asia", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=4059896", "date": "2016-02-03 20:02:54", "main_text": "ZIKA VIRUS (05): AMERICAS, ASIA, PACIFIC\n****************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nIn this update:\nCases in various countries:\nAmericas\n\nWHO has an excellent question and answer video applicable to the situation in the Americas, available at\nhttp://who.int/emergencies/zika-virus/en/\n\nCentral America\n---\nEl Salvador (national)\nGuatemala (national)\nNicaragua (national)\nPanama (Guna Yala, San Blas province)\n\nCaribbean\n---\nPuerto Rico (national)\nJamaica (national)\nCuracao (national)\n\nSouth America\n---\nBrazil\n- Americana, Campinas Metro, Sao Paulo state\n- Vector control\n- Vector species\n- Olympic Games concerns\n- Microcephaly\n\nColombia\n- National\n- Guillain-Barre syndrome\nPeru (national)\nVenezuela (national)\n\nPacific\n---\nTonga (Nuku'alofa), Polynesia\n\nAsia\n---\nIndonesia (Sumatra Island)\n\nImported cases with no possibility of ongoing transmission\n---\nUSA\n- Boston, Massachusetts\n- New York\n- Texas\n- Virginia\nCanada (national)\nNetherlands (national)\nNew Zealand (national)\n\n[2] Vaccines\n\n******\n[1] Cases in various countries:\nAmericas\nCentral America\n---\nEl Salvador (national). 30 Jan 2016.

The Brazil Provisional Measure published today [1 Feb 2016] in the Union Official Daily authorizes forcible entry by public agents fighting the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito into public or private buildings that have been abandoned, or in the absence of the person who could permit entry. The document was signed by President Dilma Rousseff and by Health Minister Marcelo Castro, and grants permission to federal, state, and municipal health authorities. The measure permits the execution of actions to combat the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito and its breeding sites. (http://combateaedes.saude.gov.br/noticias/248-governo-federal-autoriza-entrada-em-casas-abandonadas-para-eliminacao-do-mosquito-aedes-aegypti [in Portuguese]\n\n- Vector species. 28 Jan 2016. Brazilian experts at Oswaldo Cruz Foundation said the virus -- thought to be confined to the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito in the tropics -- may have already crossed over to the _Culex_ mosquito, which would increase its chances of spreading around the world.\nhttp://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/zika-may-spread-to-britain-after-experts-find-virus-carrying-mosquitoes-a6838436.html\n\n[If _Culex_ spp turn out to be vectors of Zika virus, that would be a worrisome development indeed. Many steps must be completed before vector status can be established. Experimentally, the mosquitoes would have to become infected after consuming a blood meal containing a quantity of virus found in a viremic individual and subsequently transmit the virus by bite. In the field, virus would have to be found in mosquitoes captured in areas where human cases were occurring. - Mod.TY]\n\n- Olympic Games concerns. 29 Jan 2016. There is concern about Zika virus infections occurring during the Olympic Games, to be held 5-21 Aug 2016, in Rio de Janeiro. Athletes and visitors may be at risk of exposure. Some 10 000 athletes will be competing at the games with tens of thousands more staff, officials and media attending the world's biggest sporting event, apart from the hundreds of thousands of spectators and visitors in the Brazilian city. Rio de Janeiro's mayor says there is no cause for concern because \"the games will be held in the cooler and drier winter months, when the mosquito population is naturally lower.\" The IOC's [International Olympic Committee] medical commission says, \"We remain confident that there will be a safe environment for successful and enjoyable Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.\" There is concern that individuals participating in or visiting Rio could become infected and further disseminate the virus when they depart.\nhttp://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/01/29/464861254/zika-virus-spurs-concerns-over-summer-games-in-rio\n\n[The WHO has declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC).

New figures released [Wed 27 Jan 2016] by Brazil's Health Ministry as part of a probe into the Zika virus have found fewer confirmed cases of a rare brain defect than first feared. So far, only 270 of 4180 suspected cases have been confirmed as microcephaly, with the brain damage associated with the defect ruled out in 462 cases. Researchers are still studying 3448 of the cases, which were recorded from 22 Oct [2015]. Brazilian officials still say they believe there's a sharp increase in cases of microcephaly and strongly suspect the Zika virus, which appeared in the country last year, is to blame. The rare birth defect, which also can be caused by factors such as infections, malnutrition, or drugs, means babies have unusually small heads, 32 centimeters (12.6 inches) or less in circumference, and it can cause lasting developmental problems.\nhttp://medicalxpress.com/news/2016-01-brazil-microcephaly-cases.html\n\n[A 30 Jan 2016 report in the North Shore Journal raises questions about the relationship of Zika virus to microcephaly. It is followed by a lively discussion. Excerpts from the article follow. \"Is there an outbreak of microcephaly in Brazil? That is one of the 1st questions that ought to be asked when examining the topic of the potential effects of a prenatal Zika viral infection... Data exist that suggest that the number of confirmed cases of microcephaly in Brazil will be far lower than the number of reports. In addition, the actual number of cases of microcephaly per year in Brazil prior to the arrival of the Zika viral illness is less clear than it might be. It is impossible to draw a sound conclusion that the Zika outbreak has or has not added to the number of cases of microcephaly in Brazil. The data are suggestive that the number of microcephaly cases will range, in a given 12 months, from normal to 2 or 3 times normal. It remains an issue of great concern but the hype seems to have far exceeded the threat.\"\nhttp://northshorejournal.org/microcephaly-and-zika\n\nA 31 Jan 2016 comment From Stephen Berger, Geographic Medicine, Tel Aviv Medical Center, Tel Aviv Israel (<steve@gideononline.com>) states that \"Zika virus infection has been documented in sub-Saharan Africa since 1947, and numerous publications have already addressed the epidemiology of microcephaly on the continent. I would propose a simple case-control study of the seroprevalence of Zika virus( and other arthropod-borne viruses) among African microcephalics and their mothers.\" ProMED-mail thanks Steve Berger for this comment.\n\nIn a 28 Jan 2016 article, the USA CDC Principal Deputy Director Anne Schuchat told reporters that proving these links would require case-control studies that compare microcephalic babies with those born around the same time and area. That type of information will provide much-needed nuance about other exposures and factors that could influence the health of these mothers and their offspring.\n\nThere is evidence that Zika virus can cross the placenta and infect the fetus. The virus has been shown to be present in amniotic fluid in 2 cases, and in the tissues of a newborn who died shortly after birth. One hopes that the prospective study being done by an interdisciplinary team of medical specialists in Bahia will help to clarify the relationship of maternal Zika virus infection and transmission to the fetus. - Mod.TY]\n\nColombia\n- National. 30 Jan 2016.

The mosquito-borne virus was racing through countries in the Southern Hemisphere, but, at worst, it appeared to cause a mild fever and rash. No longer: on [1 Feb 2016], the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the \"extraordinary\" cluster of microcephaly and other neurological complications that have now been linked to Zika a public health emergency of international concern. And vaccine makers, big and small, have begun the race to head it off. They have a good shot at success, several experts say -- cautioning that vaccine development requires years of testing.\n\nZika [virus] first caused serious concern in May 2015 after it arrived in South America and suspicions grew that infection during pregnancy could cause brain-damaging microcephaly in babies. The link, WHO Director-General Margaret Chan stresses, is \"strongly suspected though not yet scientifically proven\"-- as is a potential connection to Guillain-Barre syndrome, which causes a temporary paralysis in adults. With viral spread increasing, a vaccine is now a top priority.\n\nVaccine pioneer, Stanley Plotkin of the University of Pennsylvania, predicts \"a straightforward developmental pathway\" for a vaccine. He notes that Zika belongs to the flavivirus family, and vaccines exist for several of its relatives, including dengue, yellow fever, and Japanese encephalitis. \"I don't see any technical issues such as the ones that obviously exist for vaccines against HIV, tuberculosis, and many other agents,\" says Plotkin, who consults with several vaccinemakers.\n\nStill, \"there are many puzzles,\" says Thomas Monath, a virologist who studied Zika [virus infections] in wild monkeys in Nigeria in the 1970s and is now the chief scientific officer at NewLink Genetics in Devens, Massachusetts, whose team helped develop a promising Ebola vaccine. For Zika [virus], one unknown is whether infection leads to lifelong protection -- a key feature of diseases for which vaccines are most effective, such as yellow fever. Another question is whether natural or vaccine-induced immunity against other related viruses -- particularly yellow fever -- could offer a measure of \"cross protection,\" which might confuse efforts to evaluate Zika vaccines. Nor have researchers yet established a much-needed monkey model to enable comparisons of candidate vaccines.\n\nApproaches have proliferated. Monath, who has developed vaccines against several flaviviruses, says NewLink will pursue a traditional strategy that inactivates, or kills, the virus with a chemical so it cannot replicate in the body. He thinks an inactivated vaccine has the best chance of winning regulatory approval for a product that pregnant women might use.\n\nAt the nonprofit Butantan Institute in Sao Paulo, Brazil, immunologist and director Jorge Kalil is betting that a weakened, live vaccine can be safe and potentially more effective than killed virus. His team plans to exploit a technology that researchers at the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) used to make a dengue vaccine, which Butantan licensed and is now testing in an efficacy trial. To weaken that virus, researchers deleted genes so it can copy itself but not cause disease. \"Perhaps we can attenuate the Zika virus by using the same deletions of the same sites,\" Kalil says, noting that Butantan likely would partner with NIAID to develop its vaccine. The Brazilian institute has a key advantage: Unlike almost every other institution in the world that does vaccine research, it has an industrial-scale manufacturing plant--last year the institute cranked out 40 million doses of influenza vaccine--so it might be able to supply enough product for Brazil without needing help from big pharma.\n\nNIAID Director Anthony Fauci says his institute has a \"head start\" with a different technology it used to make an experimental vaccine for West Nile, another flavivirus. The manufacturing process begins with a circular \"plasmid\" of DNA that holds key viral genes. When it is inserted into bacterial cells, they produce \"virus-like particles\" that can serve as an inactivated vaccine, because they cannot copy themselves. (The West Nile vaccine worked well in early human studies, but NIAID could not find a commercial partner to take it forward).\n\nInovio Pharmaceuticals of Plymouth Meeting, Pennsylvania, boasts it already has an experimental Zika [virus] vaccine containing nothing more than a plasmid made of Zika genes. With the help of an electrical zap on the skin, the plasmid goes directly into human cells, which make Zika proteins that stimulate the immune system. CEO Jerome Kim says his team already has begun tests in mice. But although researchers can quickly make such simple DNA vaccines, they have lost their luster over the past 20 years because they have not triggered strong immune responses against other diseases. \"There are people very knowledgeable in the field who have lost faith in this technology,\" Kim concedes. \"I want to prove to the field that this technology is viable and perhaps the best option for these types of outbreaks.\"\n\nThe small Jenner Institute in Oxford, UK, is putting the Zika surface protein into harmless chimpanzee adenoviruses, which serve as a \"vector\" -- an approach similar to one used in GSK's [GlaxoSmithKline] Ebola vaccine, which was tested during the West African epidemic. Vaccine makers Protein Sciences of Meriden, Connecticut, and Hawaii Biotech of Honolulu -- which both specialize in producing viral proteins in insect cell lines -- also have projects underway.\n\nPredicting when a vaccine will come to market is a mug's game, but NIAID's Fauci thinks animal studies could be completed in a few months and small human studies to evaluate safety and immune responses could begin by the end of 2016. Even if a promising candidate surfaces, large-scale efficacy trials are probably years away, he says. Getting a vaccine approved and supplying millions of doses could take the resources of a major manufacturer. Of the 4 big pharma companies that make vaccines, only Sanofi Pasteur of Lyon, France -- makers of 3 flavivirus vaccines -- has launched a Zika program, though the others say they are watching the field closely.\n\nAs a stopgap measure, Kalil says Butantan hopes to produce a protective serum for pregnant women, which the institute already makes for several diseases, by injecting Zika virus into horses and harvesting the antibodies the animals make. \"This would take a little over a year,\" Kalil says. \"That's the best timeline -- if you're very, very optimistic.\"\n\n[Byline: Jon Cohen]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n[The progress that these vaccines make will be watched with considerable interest. Even assuming no adverse reactions to a vaccine in phase 1 trials, proof of efficacy in phase 2 and 3 will require considerable time. The cost of development will be substantial. - Mod.TY]\nSee Also\nZika virus (04): WHO declares worldwide PHEIC 20160201.3985366\nZika virus (03): Americas, Asia 20160128.3974426\nZika virus (02):

The Brazil Provisional Measure published today [1 Feb 2016] in the Union Official Daily authorizes forcible entry by public agents fighting the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito into public or private buildings that have been abandoned, or in the absence of the person who could permit entry. The document was signed by President Dilma Rousseff and by Health Minister Marcelo Castro, and grants permission to federal, state, and municipal health authorities. The measure permits the execution of actions to combat the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito and its breeding sites. (http://combateaedes.saude.gov.br/noticias/248-governo-federal-autoriza-entrada-em-casas-abandonadas-para-eliminacao-do-mosquito-aedes-aegypti [in Portuguese]\n\n- Vector species. 28 Jan 2016. Brazilian experts at Oswaldo Cruz Foundation said the virus -- thought to be confined to the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito in the tropics -- may have already crossed over to the _Culex_ mosquito, which would increase its chances of spreading around the world.\nhttp://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/zika-may-spread-to-britain-after-experts-find-virus-carrying-mosquitoes-a6838436.html\n\n[If _Culex_ spp turn out to be vectors of Zika virus, that would be a worrisome development indeed. Many steps must be completed before vector status can be established. Experimentally, the mosquitoes would have to become infected after consuming a blood meal containing a quantity of virus found in a viremic individual and subsequently transmit the virus by bite. In the field, virus would have to be found in mosquitoes captured in areas where human cases were occurring. - Mod.TY]\n\n- Olympic Games concerns. 29 Jan 2016. There is concern about Zika virus infections occurring during the Olympic Games, to be held 5-21 Aug 2016, in Rio de Janeiro. Athletes and visitors may be at risk of exposure. Some 10 000 athletes will be competing at the games with tens of thousands more staff, officials and media attending the world's biggest sporting event, apart from the hundreds of thousands of spectators and visitors in the Brazilian city. Rio de Janeiro's mayor says there is no cause for concern because \"the games will be held in the cooler and drier winter months, when the mosquito population is naturally lower.\" The IOC's [International Olympic Committee] medical commission says, \"We remain confident that there will be a safe environment for successful and enjoyable Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.\" There is concern that individuals participating in or visiting Rio could become infected and further disseminate the virus when they depart.\nhttp://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/01/29/464861254/zika-virus-spurs-concerns-over-summer-games-in-rio\n\n[The WHO has declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). Declaring a PHEIC would be the kiss of death for Brazil's economy, killing the anticipated huge influx of foreign tourists for Carnival and the Rio Olympics, and most foreign investment. - Mod.JW\n\nIt will be interesting to see if release of genetically modified mosquitoes that produce larvae that do not survive (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20160128.3974426), that have reduced _Aedes aegypti_ populations in a pilot field trial in Piracicaba, Sao Paulo state, will be extended to other localities, such as Rio de Janeiro in time for the Olympic Games in August. - Mod.TY]\n\n- Microcephaly. 27 Jan 2016. New figures released [Wed 27 Jan 2016] by Brazil's Health Ministry as part of a probe into the Zika virus have found fewer confirmed cases of a rare brain defect than first feared. So far, only 270 of 4180 suspected cases have been confirmed as microcephaly, with the brain damage associated with the defect ruled out in 462 cases. Researchers are still studying 3448 of the cases, which were recorded from 22 Oct [2015]. Brazilian officials still say they believe there's a sharp increase in cases of microcephaly and strongly suspect the Zika virus, which appeared in the country last year, is to blame. The rare birth defect, which also can be caused by factors such as infections, malnutrition, or drugs, means babies have unusually small heads, 32 centimeters (12.6 inches) or less in circumference, and it can cause lasting developmental problems.\nhttp://medicalxpress.com/news/2016-01-brazil-microcephaly-cases.html\n\n[A 30 Jan 2016 report in the North Shore Journal raises questions about the relationship of Zika virus to microcephaly. It is followed by a lively discussion. Excerpts from the article follow. \"Is there an outbreak of microcephaly in Brazil? That is one of the 1st questions that ought to be asked when examining the topic of the potential effects of a prenatal Zika viral infection... Data exist that suggest that the number of confirmed cases of microcephaly in Brazil will be far lower than the number of reports. In addition, the actual number of cases of microcephaly per year in Brazil prior to the arrival of the Zika viral illness is less clear than it might be. It is impossible to draw a sound conclusion that the Zika outbreak has or has not added to the number of cases of microcephaly in Brazil. The data are suggestive that the number of microcephaly cases will range, in a given 12 months, from normal to 2 or 3 times normal. It remains an issue of great concern but the hype seems to have far exceeded the threat.\"\nhttp://northshorejournal.org/microcephaly-and-zika\n\nA 31 Jan 2016 comment From Stephen Berger, Geographic Medicine, Tel Aviv Medical Center, Tel Aviv Israel (<steve@gideononline.com>) states that \"Zika virus infection has been documented in sub-Saharan Africa since 1947, and numerous publications have already addressed the epidemiology of microcephaly on the continent. I would propose a simple case-control study of the seroprevalence of Zika virus( and other arthropod-borne viruses) among African microcephalics and their mothers.\" ProMED-mail thanks Steve Berger for this comment.\n\nIn a 28 Jan 2016 article, the USA CDC Principal Deputy Director Anne Schuchat told reporters that proving these links would require case-control studies that compare microcephalic babies with those born around the same time and area. That type of information will provide much-needed nuance about other exposures and factors that could influence the health of these mothers and their offspring.\n\nThere is evidence that Zika virus can cross the placenta and infect the fetus. The virus has been shown to be present in amniotic fluid in 2 cases, and in the tissues of a newborn who died shortly after birth. One hopes that the prospective study being done by an interdisciplinary team of medical specialists in Bahia will help to clarify the relationship of maternal Zika virus infection and transmission to the fetus. - Mod.TY]\n\nColombia\n- National. 30 Jan 2016.

(reported) Guillain-Barre syndrome cases following Zika virus infections increased from 15 a week ago to, \"In the past week we have seen a substantial increase in the number of people reported with Guillain-Barre,\" said health minister Alejandro Gaviria.\nhttp://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/28/zika-virus-colombia-paralysis-disorder-guillain-barre\n\nPeru (national). 29 Jan 2016.

The mosquito-borne virus was racing through countries in the Southern Hemisphere, but, at worst, it appeared to cause a mild fever and rash. No longer: on [1 Feb 2016], the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the \"extraordinary\" cluster of microcephaly and other neurological complications that have now been linked to Zika a public health emergency of international concern. And vaccine makers, big and small, have begun the race to head it off. They have a good shot at success, several experts say -- cautioning that vaccine development requires years of testing.\n\nZika [virus] first caused serious concern in May 2015 after it arrived in South America and suspicions grew that infection during pregnancy could cause brain-damaging microcephaly in babies. The link, WHO Director-General Margaret Chan stresses, is \"strongly suspected though not yet scientifically proven\"-- as is a potential connection to Guillain-Barre syndrome, which causes a temporary paralysis in adults. With viral spread increasing, a vaccine is now a top priority.\n\nVaccine pioneer, Stanley Plotkin of the University of Pennsylvania, predicts \"a straightforward developmental pathway\" for a vaccine. He notes that Zika belongs to the flavivirus family, and vaccines exist for several of its relatives, including dengue, yellow fever, and Japanese encephalitis. \"I don't see any technical issues such as the ones that obviously exist for vaccines against HIV, tuberculosis, and many other agents,\" says Plotkin, who consults with several vaccinemakers.\n\nStill, \"there are many puzzles,\" says Thomas Monath, a virologist who studied Zika [virus infections] in wild monkeys in Nigeria in the 1970s and is now the chief scientific officer at NewLink Genetics in Devens, Massachusetts, whose team helped develop a promising Ebola vaccine. For Zika [virus], one unknown is whether infection leads to lifelong protection -- a key feature of diseases for which vaccines are most effective, such as yellow fever. Another question is whether natural or vaccine-induced immunity against other related viruses -- particularly yellow fever -- could offer a measure of \"cross protection,\" which might confuse efforts to evaluate Zika vaccines. Nor have researchers yet established a much-needed monkey model to enable comparisons of candidate vaccines.\n\nApproaches have proliferated. Monath, who has developed vaccines against several flaviviruses, says NewLink will pursue a traditional strategy that inactivates, or kills, the virus with a chemical so it cannot replicate in the body. He thinks an inactivated vaccine has the best chance of winning regulatory approval for a product that pregnant women might use.\n\nAt the nonprofit Butantan Institute in Sao Paulo, Brazil, immunologist and director Jorge Kalil is betting that a weakened, live vaccine can be safe and potentially more effective than killed virus. His team plans to exploit a technology that researchers at the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) used to make a dengue vaccine, which Butantan licensed and is now testing in an efficacy trial. To weaken that virus, researchers deleted genes so it can copy itself but not cause disease. \"Perhaps we can attenuate the Zika virus by using the same deletions of the same sites,\" Kalil says, noting that Butantan likely would partner with NIAID to develop its vaccine. The Brazilian institute has a key advantage: Unlike almost every other institution in the world that does vaccine research, it has an industrial-scale manufacturing plant--last year the institute cranked out 40 million doses of influenza vaccine--so it might be able to supply enough product for Brazil without needing help from big pharma.\n\nNIAID Director Anthony Fauci says his institute has a \"head start\" with a different technology it used to make an experimental vaccine for West Nile, another flavivirus. The manufacturing process begins with a circular \"plasmid\" of DNA that holds key viral genes. When it is inserted into bacterial cells, they produce \"virus-like particles\" that can serve as an inactivated vaccine, because they cannot copy themselves. (The West Nile vaccine worked well in early human studies, but NIAID could not find a commercial partner to take it forward).\n\nInovio Pharmaceuticals of Plymouth Meeting, Pennsylvania, boasts it already has an experimental Zika [virus] vaccine containing nothing more than a plasmid made of Zika genes. With the help of an electrical zap on the skin, the plasmid goes directly into human cells, which make Zika proteins that stimulate the immune system. CEO Jerome Kim says his team already has begun tests in mice. But although researchers can quickly make such simple DNA vaccines, they have lost their luster over the past 20 years because they have not triggered strong immune responses against other diseases. \"There are people very knowledgeable in the field who have lost faith in this technology,\" Kim concedes. \"I want to prove to the field that this technology is viable and perhaps the best option for these types of outbreaks.\"\n\nThe small Jenner Institute in Oxford, UK, is putting the Zika surface protein into harmless chimpanzee adenoviruses, which serve as a \"vector\" -- an approach similar to one used in GSK's [GlaxoSmithKline] Ebola vaccine, which was tested during the West African epidemic. Vaccine makers Protein Sciences of Meriden, Connecticut, and Hawaii Biotech of Honolulu -- which both specialize in producing viral proteins in insect cell lines -- also have projects underway.\n\nPredicting when a vaccine will come to market is a mug's game, but NIAID's Fauci thinks animal studies could be completed in a few months and small human studies to evaluate safety and immune responses could begin by the end of 2016. Even if a promising candidate surfaces, large-scale efficacy trials are probably years away, he says. Getting a vaccine approved and supplying millions of doses could take the resources of a major manufacturer. Of the 4 big pharma companies that make vaccines, only Sanofi Pasteur of Lyon, France -- makers of 3 flavivirus vaccines -- has launched a Zika program, though the others say they are watching the field closely.\n\nAs a stopgap measure, Kalil says Butantan hopes to produce a protective serum for pregnant women, which the institute already makes for several diseases, by injecting Zika virus into horses and harvesting the antibodies the animals make. \"This would take a little over a year,\" Kalil says. \"That's the best timeline -- if you're very, very optimistic.\"\n\n[Byline: Jon Cohen]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n[The progress that these vaccines make will be watched with considerable interest. Even assuming no adverse reactions to a vaccine in phase 1 trials, proof of efficacy in phase 2 and 3 will require considerable time. The cost of development will be substantial. - Mod.TY]\nSee Also\nZika virus (04): WHO declares worldwide PHEIC 20160201.3985366\nZika virus (03): Americas, Asia 20160128.3974426\nZika virus (02):

The Brazil Provisional Measure published today [1 Feb 2016] in the Union Official Daily authorizes forcible entry by public agents fighting the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito into public or private buildings that have been abandoned, or in the absence of the person who could permit entry. The document was signed by President Dilma Rousseff and by Health Minister Marcelo Castro, and grants permission to federal, state, and municipal health authorities. The measure permits the execution of actions to combat the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito and its breeding sites. (http://combateaedes.saude.gov.br/noticias/248-governo-federal-autoriza-entrada-em-casas-abandonadas-para-eliminacao-do-mosquito-aedes-aegypti [in Portuguese]\n\n- Vector species. 28 Jan 2016. Brazilian experts at Oswaldo Cruz Foundation said the virus -- thought to be confined to the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito in the tropics -- may have already crossed over to the _Culex_ mosquito, which would increase its chances of spreading around the world.\nhttp://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/zika-may-spread-to-britain-after-experts-find-virus-carrying-mosquitoes-a6838436.html\n\n[If _Culex_ spp turn out to be vectors of Zika virus, that would be a worrisome development indeed. Many steps must be completed before vector status can be established. Experimentally, the mosquitoes would have to become infected after consuming a blood meal containing a quantity of virus found in a viremic individual and subsequently transmit the virus by bite. In the field, virus would have to be found in mosquitoes captured in areas where human cases were occurring. - Mod.TY]\n\n- Olympic Games concerns. 29 Jan 2016. There is concern about Zika virus infections occurring during the Olympic Games, to be held 5-21 Aug 2016, in Rio de Janeiro. Athletes and visitors may be at risk of exposure. Some 10 000 athletes will be competing at the games with tens of thousands more staff, officials and media attending the world's biggest sporting event, apart from the hundreds of thousands of spectators and visitors in the Brazilian city. Rio de Janeiro's mayor says there is no cause for concern because \"the games will be held in the cooler and drier winter months, when the mosquito population is naturally lower.\" The IOC's [International Olympic Committee] medical commission says, \"We remain confident that there will be a safe environment for successful and enjoyable Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.\" There is concern that individuals participating in or visiting Rio could become infected and further disseminate the virus when they depart.\nhttp://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/01/29/464861254/zika-virus-spurs-concerns-over-summer-games-in-rio\n\n[The WHO has declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). Declaring a PHEIC would be the kiss of death for Brazil's economy, killing the anticipated huge influx of foreign tourists for Carnival and the Rio Olympics, and most foreign investment. - Mod.JW\n\nIt will be interesting to see if release of genetically modified mosquitoes that produce larvae that do not survive (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20160128.3974426), that have reduced _Aedes aegypti_ populations in a pilot field trial in Piracicaba, Sao Paulo state, will be extended to other localities, such as Rio de Janeiro in time for the Olympic Games in August. - Mod.TY]\n\n- Microcephaly. 27 Jan 2016. New figures released [Wed 27 Jan 2016] by Brazil's Health Ministry as part of a probe into the Zika virus have found fewer confirmed cases of a rare brain defect than first feared. So far, only 270 of 4180 suspected cases have been confirmed as microcephaly, with the brain damage associated with the defect ruled out in 462 cases. Researchers are still studying 3448 of the cases, which were recorded from 22 Oct [2015]. Brazilian officials still say they believe there's a sharp increase in cases of microcephaly and strongly suspect the Zika virus, which appeared in the country last year, is to blame. The rare birth defect, which also can be caused by factors such as infections, malnutrition, or drugs, means babies have unusually small heads, 32 centimeters (12.6 inches) or less in circumference, and it can cause lasting developmental problems.\nhttp://medicalxpress.com/news/2016-01-brazil-microcephaly-cases.html\n\n[A 30 Jan 2016 report in the North Shore Journal raises questions about the relationship of Zika virus to microcephaly. It is followed by a lively discussion. Excerpts from the article follow. \"Is there an outbreak of microcephaly in Brazil? That is one of the 1st questions that ought to be asked when examining the topic of the potential effects of a prenatal Zika viral infection... Data exist that suggest that the number of confirmed cases of microcephaly in Brazil will be far lower than the number of reports. In addition, the actual number of cases of microcephaly per year in Brazil prior to the arrival of the Zika viral illness is less clear than it might be. It is impossible to draw a sound conclusion that the Zika outbreak has or has not added to the number of cases of microcephaly in Brazil. The data are suggestive that the number of microcephaly cases will range, in a given 12 months, from normal to 2 or 3 times normal. It remains an issue of great concern but the hype seems to have far exceeded the threat.\"\nhttp://northshorejournal.org/microcephaly-and-zika\n\nA 31 Jan 2016 comment From Stephen Berger, Geographic Medicine, Tel Aviv Medical Center, Tel Aviv Israel (<steve@gideononline.com>) states that \"Zika virus infection has been documented in sub-Saharan Africa since 1947, and numerous publications have already addressed the epidemiology of microcephaly on the continent. I would propose a simple case-control study of the seroprevalence of Zika virus( and other arthropod-borne viruses) among African microcephalics and their mothers.\" ProMED-mail thanks Steve Berger for this comment.\n\nIn a 28 Jan 2016 article, the USA CDC Principal Deputy Director Anne Schuchat told reporters that proving these links would require case-control studies that compare microcephalic babies with those born around the same time and area. That type of information will provide much-needed nuance about other exposures and factors that could influence the health of these mothers and their offspring.\n\nThere is evidence that Zika virus can cross the placenta and infect the fetus. The virus has been shown to be present in amniotic fluid in 2 cases, and in the tissues of a newborn who died shortly after birth. One hopes that the prospective study being done by an interdisciplinary team of medical specialists in Bahia will help to clarify the relationship of maternal Zika virus infection and transmission to the fetus. - Mod.TY]\n\nColombia\n- National. 30 Jan 2016.

The mosquito-borne virus was racing through countries in the Southern Hemisphere, but, at worst, it appeared to cause a mild fever and rash. No longer: on [1 Feb 2016], the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the \"extraordinary\" cluster of microcephaly and other neurological complications that have now been linked to Zika a public health emergency of international concern. And vaccine makers, big and small, have begun the race to head it off. They have a good shot at success, several experts say -- cautioning that vaccine development requires years of testing.\n\nZika [virus] first caused serious concern in May 2015 after it arrived in South America and suspicions grew that infection during pregnancy could cause brain-damaging microcephaly in babies. The link, WHO Director-General Margaret Chan stresses, is \"strongly suspected though not yet scientifically proven\"-- as is a potential connection to Guillain-Barre syndrome, which causes a temporary paralysis in adults. With viral spread increasing, a vaccine is now a top priority.\n\nVaccine pioneer, Stanley Plotkin of the University of Pennsylvania, predicts \"a straightforward developmental pathway\" for a vaccine. He notes that Zika belongs to the flavivirus family, and vaccines exist for several of its relatives, including dengue, yellow fever, and Japanese encephalitis. \"I don't see any technical issues such as the ones that obviously exist for vaccines against HIV, tuberculosis, and many other agents,\" says Plotkin, who consults with several vaccinemakers.\n\nStill, \"there are many puzzles,\" says Thomas Monath, a virologist who studied Zika [virus infections] in wild monkeys in Nigeria in the 1970s and is now the chief scientific officer at NewLink Genetics in Devens, Massachusetts, whose team helped develop a promising Ebola vaccine. For Zika [virus], one unknown is whether infection leads to lifelong protection -- a key feature of diseases for which vaccines are most effective, such as yellow fever. Another question is whether natural or vaccine-induced immunity against other related viruses -- particularly yellow fever -- could offer a measure of \"cross protection,\" which might confuse efforts to evaluate Zika vaccines. Nor have researchers yet established a much-needed monkey model to enable comparisons of candidate vaccines.\n\nApproaches have proliferated. Monath, who has developed vaccines against several flaviviruses, says NewLink will pursue a traditional strategy that inactivates, or kills, the virus with a chemical so it cannot replicate in the body. He thinks an inactivated vaccine has the best chance of winning regulatory approval for a product that pregnant women might use.\n\nAt the nonprofit Butantan Institute in Sao Paulo, Brazil, immunologist and director Jorge Kalil is betting that a weakened, live vaccine can be safe and potentially more effective than killed virus. His team plans to exploit a technology that researchers at the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) used to make a dengue vaccine, which Butantan licensed and is now testing in an efficacy trial. To weaken that virus, researchers deleted genes so it can copy itself but not cause disease. \"Perhaps we can attenuate the Zika virus by using the same deletions of the same sites,\" Kalil says, noting that Butantan likely would partner with NIAID to develop its vaccine. The Brazilian institute has a key advantage: Unlike almost every other institution in the world that does vaccine research, it has an industrial-scale manufacturing plant--last year the institute cranked out 40 million doses of influenza vaccine--so it might be able to supply enough product for Brazil without needing help from big pharma.\n\nNIAID Director Anthony Fauci says his institute has a \"head start\" with a different technology it used to make an experimental vaccine for West Nile, another flavivirus. The manufacturing process begins with a circular \"plasmid\" of DNA that holds key viral genes. When it is inserted into bacterial cells, they produce \"virus-like particles\" that can serve as an inactivated vaccine, because they cannot copy themselves. (The West Nile vaccine worked well in early human studies, but NIAID could not find a commercial partner to take it forward).\n\nInovio Pharmaceuticals of Plymouth Meeting, Pennsylvania, boasts it already has an experimental Zika [virus] vaccine containing nothing more than a plasmid made of Zika genes. With the help of an electrical zap on the skin, the plasmid goes directly into human cells, which make Zika proteins that stimulate the immune system. CEO Jerome Kim says his team already has begun tests in mice. But although researchers can quickly make such simple DNA vaccines, they have lost their luster over the past 20 years because they have not triggered strong immune responses against other diseases. \"There are people very knowledgeable in the field who have lost faith in this technology,\" Kim concedes. \"I want to prove to the field that this technology is viable and perhaps the best option for these types of outbreaks.\"\n\nThe small Jenner Institute in Oxford, UK, is putting the Zika surface protein into harmless chimpanzee adenoviruses, which serve as a \"vector\" -- an approach similar to one used in GSK's [GlaxoSmithKline] Ebola vaccine, which was tested during the West African epidemic. Vaccine makers Protein Sciences of Meriden, Connecticut, and Hawaii Biotech of Honolulu -- which both specialize in producing viral proteins in insect cell lines -- also have projects underway.\n\nPredicting when a vaccine will come to market is a mug's game, but NIAID's Fauci thinks animal studies could be completed in a few months and small human studies to evaluate safety and immune responses could begin by the end of 2016. Even if a promising candidate surfaces, large-scale efficacy trials are probably years away, he says. Getting a vaccine approved and supplying millions of doses could take the resources of a major manufacturer. Of the 4 big pharma companies that make vaccines, only Sanofi Pasteur of Lyon, France -- makers of 3 flavivirus vaccines -- has launched a Zika program, though the others say they are watching the field closely.\n\nAs a stopgap measure, Kalil says Butantan hopes to produce a protective serum for pregnant women, which the institute already makes for several diseases, by injecting Zika virus into horses and harvesting the antibodies the animals make. \"This would take a little over a year,\" Kalil says. \"That's the best timeline -- if you're very, very optimistic.\"\n\n[Byline: Jon Cohen]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n[The progress that these vaccines make will be watched with considerable interest. Even assuming no adverse reactions to a vaccine in phase 1 trials, proof of efficacy in phase 2 and 3 will require considerable time. The cost of development will be substantial. - Mod.TY]\nSee Also\nZika virus (04): WHO declares worldwide PHEIC 20160201.3985366\nZika virus (03): Americas, Asia 20160128.3974426\nZika virus (02):

Some 10 000 athletes will be competing at the games with tens of thousands more staff, officials and media attending the world's biggest sporting event, apart from the hundreds of thousands of spectators and visitors in the Brazilian city. Rio de Janeiro's mayor says there is no cause for concern because \"the games will be held in the cooler and drier winter months, when the mosquito population is naturally lower.\" The IOC's [International Olympic Committee] medical commission says, \"We remain confident that there will be a safe environment for successful and enjoyable Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.\" There is concern that individuals participating in or visiting Rio could become infected and further disseminate the virus when they depart.\nhttp://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/01/29/464861254/zika-virus-spurs-concerns-over-summer-games-in-rio\n\n[The WHO has declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC).

New figures released [Wed 27 Jan 2016] by Brazil's Health Ministry as part of a probe into the Zika virus have found fewer confirmed cases of a rare brain defect than first feared. So far, only 270 of 4180 suspected cases have been confirmed as microcephaly, with the brain damage associated with the defect ruled out in 462 cases. Researchers are still studying 3448 of the cases, which were recorded from 22 Oct [2015]. Brazilian officials still say they believe there's a sharp increase in cases of microcephaly and strongly suspect the Zika virus, which appeared in the country last year, is to blame. The rare birth defect, which also can be caused by factors such as infections, malnutrition, or drugs, means babies have unusually small heads, 32 centimeters (12.6 inches) or less in circumference, and it can cause lasting developmental problems.\nhttp://medicalxpress.com/news/2016-01-brazil-microcephaly-cases.html\n\n[A 30 Jan 2016 report in the North Shore Journal raises questions about the relationship of Zika virus to microcephaly. It is followed by a lively discussion. Excerpts from the article follow. \"Is there an outbreak of microcephaly in Brazil? That is one of the 1st questions that ought to be asked when examining the topic of the potential effects of a prenatal Zika viral infection... Data exist that suggest that the number of confirmed cases of microcephaly in Brazil will be far lower than the number of reports. In addition, the actual number of cases of microcephaly per year in Brazil prior to the arrival of the Zika viral illness is less clear than it might be. It is impossible to draw a sound conclusion that the Zika outbreak has or has not added to the number of cases of microcephaly in Brazil. The data are suggestive that the number of microcephaly cases will range, in a given 12 months, from normal to 2 or 3 times normal. It remains an issue of great concern but the hype seems to have far exceeded the threat.\"\nhttp://northshorejournal.org/microcephaly-and-zika\n\nA 31 Jan 2016 comment From Stephen Berger, Geographic Medicine, Tel Aviv Medical Center, Tel Aviv Israel (<steve@gideononline.com>) states that \"Zika virus infection has been documented in sub-Saharan Africa since 1947, and numerous publications have already addressed the epidemiology of microcephaly on the continent. I would propose a simple case-control study of the seroprevalence of Zika virus( and other arthropod-borne viruses) among African microcephalics and their mothers.\" ProMED-mail thanks Steve Berger for this comment.\n\nIn a 28 Jan 2016 article, the USA CDC Principal Deputy Director Anne Schuchat told reporters that proving these links would require case-control studies that compare microcephalic babies with those born around the same time and area. That type of information will provide much-needed nuance about other exposures and factors that could influence the health of these mothers and their offspring.\n\nThere is evidence that Zika virus can cross the placenta and infect the fetus. The virus has been shown to be present in amniotic fluid in 2 cases, and in the tissues of a newborn who died shortly after birth. One hopes that the prospective study being done by an interdisciplinary team of medical specialists in Bahia will help to clarify the relationship of maternal Zika virus infection and transmission to the fetus. - Mod.TY]\n\nColombia\n- National. 30 Jan 2016.

The mosquito-borne virus was racing through countries in the Southern Hemisphere, but, at worst, it appeared to cause a mild fever and rash. No longer: on [1 Feb 2016], the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the \"extraordinary\" cluster of microcephaly and other neurological complications that have now been linked to Zika a public health emergency of international concern. And vaccine makers, big and small, have begun the race to head it off. They have a good shot at success, several experts say -- cautioning that vaccine development requires years of testing.\n\nZika [virus] first caused serious concern in May 2015 after it arrived in South America and suspicions grew that infection during pregnancy could cause brain-damaging microcephaly in babies. The link, WHO Director-General Margaret Chan stresses, is \"strongly suspected though not yet scientifically proven\"-- as is a potential connection to Guillain-Barre syndrome, which causes a temporary paralysis in adults. With viral spread increasing, a vaccine is now a top priority.\n\nVaccine pioneer, Stanley Plotkin of the University of Pennsylvania, predicts \"a straightforward developmental pathway\" for a vaccine. He notes that Zika belongs to the flavivirus family, and vaccines exist for several of its relatives, including dengue, yellow fever, and Japanese encephalitis. \"I don't see any technical issues such as the ones that obviously exist for vaccines against HIV, tuberculosis, and many other agents,\" says Plotkin, who consults with several vaccinemakers.\n\nStill, \"there are many puzzles,\" says Thomas Monath, a virologist who studied Zika [virus infections] in wild monkeys in Nigeria in the 1970s and is now the chief scientific officer at NewLink Genetics in Devens, Massachusetts, whose team helped develop a promising Ebola vaccine. For Zika [virus], one unknown is whether infection leads to lifelong protection -- a key feature of diseases for which vaccines are most effective, such as yellow fever. Another question is whether natural or vaccine-induced immunity against other related viruses -- particularly yellow fever -- could offer a measure of \"cross protection,\" which might confuse efforts to evaluate Zika vaccines. Nor have researchers yet established a much-needed monkey model to enable comparisons of candidate vaccines.\n\nApproaches have proliferated. Monath, who has developed vaccines against several flaviviruses, says NewLink will pursue a traditional strategy that inactivates, or kills, the virus with a chemical so it cannot replicate in the body. He thinks an inactivated vaccine has the best chance of winning regulatory approval for a product that pregnant women might use.\n\nAt the nonprofit Butantan Institute in Sao Paulo, Brazil, immunologist and director Jorge Kalil is betting that a weakened, live vaccine can be safe and potentially more effective than killed virus. His team plans to exploit a technology that researchers at the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) used to make a dengue vaccine, which Butantan licensed and is now testing in an efficacy trial. To weaken that virus, researchers deleted genes so it can copy itself but not cause disease. \"Perhaps we can attenuate the Zika virus by using the same deletions of the same sites,\" Kalil says, noting that Butantan likely would partner with NIAID to develop its vaccine. The Brazilian institute has a key advantage: Unlike almost every other institution in the world that does vaccine research, it has an industrial-scale manufacturing plant--last year the institute cranked out 40 million doses of influenza vaccine--so it might be able to supply enough product for Brazil without needing help from big pharma.\n\nNIAID Director Anthony Fauci says his institute has a \"head start\" with a different technology it used to make an experimental vaccine for West Nile, another flavivirus. The manufacturing process begins with a circular \"plasmid\" of DNA that holds key viral genes. When it is inserted into bacterial cells, they produce \"virus-like particles\" that can serve as an inactivated vaccine, because they cannot copy themselves. (The West Nile vaccine worked well in early human studies, but NIAID could not find a commercial partner to take it forward).\n\nInovio Pharmaceuticals of Plymouth Meeting, Pennsylvania, boasts it already has an experimental Zika [virus] vaccine containing nothing more than a plasmid made of Zika genes. With the help of an electrical zap on the skin, the plasmid goes directly into human cells, which make Zika proteins that stimulate the immune system. CEO Jerome Kim says his team already has begun tests in mice. But although researchers can quickly make such simple DNA vaccines, they have lost their luster over the past 20 years because they have not triggered strong immune responses against other diseases. \"There are people very knowledgeable in the field who have lost faith in this technology,\" Kim concedes. \"I want to prove to the field that this technology is viable and perhaps the best option for these types of outbreaks.\"\n\nThe small Jenner Institute in Oxford, UK, is putting the Zika surface protein into harmless chimpanzee adenoviruses, which serve as a \"vector\" -- an approach similar to one used in GSK's [GlaxoSmithKline] Ebola vaccine, which was tested during the West African epidemic. Vaccine makers Protein Sciences of Meriden, Connecticut, and Hawaii Biotech of Honolulu -- which both specialize in producing viral proteins in insect cell lines -- also have projects underway.\n\nPredicting when a vaccine will come to market is a mug's game, but NIAID's Fauci thinks animal studies could be completed in a few months and small human studies to evaluate safety and immune responses could begin by the end of 2016. Even if a promising candidate surfaces, large-scale efficacy trials are probably years away, he says. Getting a vaccine approved and supplying millions of doses could take the resources of a major manufacturer. Of the 4 big pharma companies that make vaccines, only Sanofi Pasteur of Lyon, France -- makers of 3 flavivirus vaccines -- has launched a Zika program, though the others say they are watching the field closely.\n\nAs a stopgap measure, Kalil says Butantan hopes to produce a protective serum for pregnant women, which the institute already makes for several diseases, by injecting Zika virus into horses and harvesting the antibodies the animals make. \"This would take a little over a year,\" Kalil says. \"That's the best timeline -- if you're very, very optimistic.\"\n\n[Byline: Jon Cohen]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n[The progress that these vaccines make will be watched with considerable interest. Even assuming no adverse reactions to a vaccine in phase 1 trials, proof of efficacy in phase 2 and 3 will require considerable time. The cost of development will be substantial. - Mod.TY]\nSee Also\nZika virus (04): WHO declares worldwide PHEIC 20160201.3985366\nZika virus (03): Americas, Asia 20160128.3974426\nZika virus (02):

The Brazil Provisional Measure published today [1 Feb 2016] in the Union Official Daily authorizes forcible entry by public agents fighting the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito into public or private buildings that have been abandoned, or in the absence of the person who could permit entry. The document was signed by President Dilma Rousseff and by Health Minister Marcelo Castro, and grants permission to federal, state, and municipal health authorities. The measure permits the execution of actions to combat the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito and its breeding sites.

Brazilian experts at Oswaldo Cruz Foundation said the virus -- thought to be confined to the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito in the tropics -- may have already crossed over to the _Culex_ mosquito, which would increase its chances of spreading around the world.\nhttp://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/zika-may-spread-to-britain-after-experts-find-virus-carrying-mosquitoes-a6838436.html\n\n[If _Culex_ spp turn out to be vectors of Zika virus, that would be a worrisome development indeed. Many steps must be completed before vector status can be established. Experimentally, the mosquitoes would have to become infected after consuming a blood meal containing a quantity of virus found in a viremic individual and subsequently transmit the virus by bite. In the field, virus would have to be found in mosquitoes captured in areas where human cases were occurring. - Mod.TY]\n\n- Olympic Games concerns. 29 Jan 2016. There is concern about Zika virus infections occurring during the Olympic Games, to be held 5-21 Aug 2016, in Rio de Janeiro. Athletes and visitors may be at risk of exposure. Some 10 000 athletes will be competing at the games with tens of thousands more staff, officials and media attending the world's biggest sporting event, apart from the hundreds of thousands of spectators and visitors in the Brazilian city. Rio de Janeiro's mayor says there is no cause for concern because \"the games will be held in the cooler and drier winter months, when the mosquito population is naturally lower.\" The IOC's [International Olympic Committee] medical commission says, \"We remain confident that there will be a safe environment for successful and enjoyable Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.\" There is concern that individuals participating in or visiting Rio could become infected and further disseminate the virus when they depart.\nhttp://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/01/29/464861254/zika-virus-spurs-concerns-over-summer-games-in-rio\n\n[The WHO has declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC).

New figures released [Wed 27 Jan 2016] by Brazil's Health Ministry as part of a probe into the Zika virus have found fewer confirmed cases of a rare brain defect than first feared. So far, only 270 of 4180 suspected cases have been confirmed as microcephaly, with the brain damage associated with the defect ruled out in 462 cases. Researchers are still studying 3448 of the cases, which were recorded from 22 Oct [2015]. Brazilian officials still say they believe there's a sharp increase in cases of microcephaly and strongly suspect the Zika virus, which appeared in the country last year, is to blame. The rare birth defect, which also can be caused by factors such as infections, malnutrition, or drugs, means babies have unusually small heads, 32 centimeters (12.6 inches) or less in circumference, and it can cause lasting developmental problems.\nhttp://medicalxpress.com/news/2016-01-brazil-microcephaly-cases.html\n\n[A 30 Jan 2016 report in the North Shore Journal raises questions about the relationship of Zika virus to microcephaly. It is followed by a lively discussion. Excerpts from the article follow. \"Is there an outbreak of microcephaly in Brazil? That is one of the 1st questions that ought to be asked when examining the topic of the potential effects of a prenatal Zika viral infection... Data exist that suggest that the number of confirmed cases of microcephaly in Brazil will be far lower than the number of reports. In addition, the actual number of cases of microcephaly per year in Brazil prior to the arrival of the Zika viral illness is less clear than it might be. It is impossible to draw a sound conclusion that the Zika outbreak has or has not added to the number of cases of microcephaly in Brazil. The data are suggestive that the number of microcephaly cases will range, in a given 12 months, from normal to 2 or 3 times normal. It remains an issue of great concern but the hype seems to have far exceeded the threat.\"\nhttp://northshorejournal.org/microcephaly-and-zika\n\nA 31 Jan 2016 comment From Stephen Berger, Geographic Medicine, Tel Aviv Medical Center, Tel Aviv Israel (<steve@gideononline.com>) states that \"Zika virus infection has been documented in sub-Saharan Africa since 1947, and numerous publications have already addressed the epidemiology of microcephaly on the continent. I would propose a simple case-control study of the seroprevalence of Zika virus( and other arthropod-borne viruses) among African microcephalics and their mothers.\" ProMED-mail thanks Steve Berger for this comment.\n\nIn a 28 Jan 2016 article, the USA CDC Principal Deputy Director Anne Schuchat told reporters that proving these links would require case-control studies that compare microcephalic babies with those born around the same time and area. That type of information will provide much-needed nuance about other exposures and factors that could influence the health of these mothers and their offspring.\n\nThere is evidence that Zika virus can cross the placenta and infect the fetus. The virus has been shown to be present in amniotic fluid in 2 cases, and in the tissues of a newborn who died shortly after birth. One hopes that the prospective study being done by an interdisciplinary team of medical specialists in Bahia will help to clarify the relationship of maternal Zika virus infection and transmission to the fetus. - Mod.TY]\n\nColombia\n- National. 30 Jan 2016.

The mosquito-borne virus was racing through countries in the Southern Hemisphere, but, at worst, it appeared to cause a mild fever and rash. No longer: on [1 Feb 2016], the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the \"extraordinary\" cluster of microcephaly and other neurological complications that have now been linked to Zika a public health emergency of international concern. And vaccine makers, big and small, have begun the race to head it off. They have a good shot at success, several experts say -- cautioning that vaccine development requires years of testing.\n\nZika [virus] first caused serious concern in May 2015 after it arrived in South America and suspicions grew that infection during pregnancy could cause brain-damaging microcephaly in babies. The link, WHO Director-General Margaret Chan stresses, is \"strongly suspected though not yet scientifically proven\"-- as is a potential connection to Guillain-Barre syndrome, which causes a temporary paralysis in adults. With viral spread increasing, a vaccine is now a top priority.\n\nVaccine pioneer, Stanley Plotkin of the University of Pennsylvania, predicts \"a straightforward developmental pathway\" for a vaccine. He notes that Zika belongs to the flavivirus family, and vaccines exist for several of its relatives, including dengue, yellow fever, and Japanese encephalitis. \"I don't see any technical issues such as the ones that obviously exist for vaccines against HIV, tuberculosis, and many other agents,\" says Plotkin, who consults with several vaccinemakers.\n\nStill, \"there are many puzzles,\" says Thomas Monath, a virologist who studied Zika [virus infections] in wild monkeys in Nigeria in the 1970s and is now the chief scientific officer at NewLink Genetics in Devens, Massachusetts, whose team helped develop a promising Ebola vaccine. For Zika [virus], one unknown is whether infection leads to lifelong protection -- a key feature of diseases for which vaccines are most effective, such as yellow fever. Another question is whether natural or vaccine-induced immunity against other related viruses -- particularly yellow fever -- could offer a measure of \"cross protection,\" which might confuse efforts to evaluate Zika vaccines. Nor have researchers yet established a much-needed monkey model to enable comparisons of candidate vaccines.\n\nApproaches have proliferated. Monath, who has developed vaccines against several flaviviruses, says NewLink will pursue a traditional strategy that inactivates, or kills, the virus with a chemical so it cannot replicate in the body. He thinks an inactivated vaccine has the best chance of winning regulatory approval for a product that pregnant women might use.\n\nAt the nonprofit Butantan Institute in Sao Paulo, Brazil, immunologist and director Jorge Kalil is betting that a weakened, live vaccine can be safe and potentially more effective than killed virus. His team plans to exploit a technology that researchers at the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) used to make a dengue vaccine, which Butantan licensed and is now testing in an efficacy trial. To weaken that virus, researchers deleted genes so it can copy itself but not cause disease. \"Perhaps we can attenuate the Zika virus by using the same deletions of the same sites,\" Kalil says, noting that Butantan likely would partner with NIAID to develop its vaccine. The Brazilian institute has a key advantage: Unlike almost every other institution in the world that does vaccine research, it has an industrial-scale manufacturing plant--last year the institute cranked out 40 million doses of influenza vaccine--so it might be able to supply enough product for Brazil without needing help from big pharma.\n\nNIAID Director Anthony Fauci says his institute has a \"head start\" with a different technology it used to make an experimental vaccine for West Nile, another flavivirus. The manufacturing process begins with a circular \"plasmid\" of DNA that holds key viral genes. When it is inserted into bacterial cells, they produce \"virus-like particles\" that can serve as an inactivated vaccine, because they cannot copy themselves. (The West Nile vaccine worked well in early human studies, but NIAID could not find a commercial partner to take it forward).\n\nInovio Pharmaceuticals of Plymouth Meeting, Pennsylvania, boasts it already has an experimental Zika [virus] vaccine containing nothing more than a plasmid made of Zika genes. With the help of an electrical zap on the skin, the plasmid goes directly into human cells, which make Zika proteins that stimulate the immune system. CEO Jerome Kim says his team already has begun tests in mice. But although researchers can quickly make such simple DNA vaccines, they have lost their luster over the past 20 years because they have not triggered strong immune responses against other diseases. \"There are people very knowledgeable in the field who have lost faith in this technology,\" Kim concedes. \"I want to prove to the field that this technology is viable and perhaps the best option for these types of outbreaks.\"\n\nThe small Jenner Institute in Oxford, UK, is putting the Zika surface protein into harmless chimpanzee adenoviruses, which serve as a \"vector\" -- an approach similar to one used in GSK's [GlaxoSmithKline] Ebola vaccine, which was tested during the West African epidemic. Vaccine makers Protein Sciences of Meriden, Connecticut, and Hawaii Biotech of Honolulu -- which both specialize in producing viral proteins in insect cell lines -- also have projects underway.\n\nPredicting when a vaccine will come to market is a mug's game, but NIAID's Fauci thinks animal studies could be completed in a few months and small human studies to evaluate safety and immune responses could begin by the end of 2016. Even if a promising candidate surfaces, large-scale efficacy trials are probably years away, he says. Getting a vaccine approved and supplying millions of doses could take the resources of a major manufacturer. Of the 4 big pharma companies that make vaccines, only Sanofi Pasteur of Lyon, France -- makers of 3 flavivirus vaccines -- has launched a Zika program, though the others say they are watching the field closely.\n\nAs a stopgap measure, Kalil says Butantan hopes to produce a protective serum for pregnant women, which the institute already makes for several diseases, by injecting Zika virus into horses and harvesting the antibodies the animals make. \"This would take a little over a year,\" Kalil says. \"That's the best timeline -- if you're very, very optimistic.\"\n\n[Byline: Jon Cohen]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n[The progress that these vaccines make will be watched with considerable interest. Even assuming no adverse reactions to a vaccine in phase 1 trials, proof of efficacy in phase 2 and 3 will require considerable time. The cost of development will be substantial. - Mod.TY]\nSee Also\nZika virus (04): WHO declares worldwide PHEIC 20160201.3985366\nZika virus (03): Americas, Asia 20160128.3974426\nZika virus (02):

The Brazil Provisional Measure published today [1 Feb 2016] in the Union Official Daily authorizes forcible entry by public agents fighting the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito into public or private buildings that have been abandoned, or in the absence of the person who could permit entry. The document was signed by President Dilma Rousseff and by Health Minister Marcelo Castro, and grants permission to federal, state, and municipal health authorities. The measure permits the execution of actions to combat the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito and its breeding sites.

Brazilian experts at Oswaldo Cruz Foundation said the virus -- thought to be confined to the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito in the tropics -- may have already crossed over to the _Culex_ mosquito, which would increase its chances of spreading around the world.\nhttp://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/zika-may-spread-to-britain-after-experts-find-virus-carrying-mosquitoes-a6838436.html\n\n[If _Culex_ spp turn out to be vectors of Zika virus, that would be a worrisome development indeed. Many steps must be completed before vector status can be established. Experimentally, the mosquitoes would have to become infected after consuming a blood meal containing a quantity of virus found in a viremic individual and subsequently transmit the virus by bite. In the field, virus would have to be found in mosquitoes captured in areas where human cases were occurring. - Mod.TY]\n\n- Olympic Games concerns. 29 Jan 2016. There is concern about Zika virus infections occurring during the Olympic Games, to be held 5-21 Aug 2016, in Rio de Janeiro. Athletes and visitors may be at risk of exposure. Some 10 000 athletes will be competing at the games with tens of thousands more staff, officials and media attending the world's biggest sporting event, apart from the hundreds of thousands of spectators and visitors in the Brazilian city. Rio de Janeiro's mayor says there is no cause for concern because \"the games will be held in the cooler and drier winter months, when the mosquito population is naturally lower.\" The IOC's [International Olympic Committee] medical commission says, \"We remain confident that there will be a safe environment for successful and enjoyable Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.\" There is concern that individuals participating in or visiting Rio could become infected and further disseminate the virus when they depart.\nhttp://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/01/29/464861254/zika-virus-spurs-concerns-over-summer-games-in-rio\n\n[The WHO has declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). Declaring a PHEIC would be the kiss of death for Brazil's economy, killing the anticipated huge influx of foreign tourists for Carnival and the Rio Olympics, and most foreign investment. - Mod.JW\n\nIt will be interesting to see if release of genetically modified mosquitoes that produce larvae that do not survive (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20160128.3974426), that have reduced _Aedes aegypti_ populations in a pilot field trial in Piracicaba, Sao Paulo state, will be extended to other localities, such as Rio de Janeiro in time for the Olympic Games in August. - Mod.TY]\n\n- Microcephaly. 27 Jan 2016. New figures released [Wed 27 Jan 2016] by Brazil's Health Ministry as part of a probe into the Zika virus have found fewer confirmed cases of a rare brain defect than first feared. So far, only 270 of 4180 suspected cases have been confirmed as microcephaly, with the brain damage associated with the defect ruled out in 462 cases. Researchers are still studying 3448 of the cases, which were recorded from 22 Oct [2015]. Brazilian officials still say they believe there's a sharp increase in cases of microcephaly and strongly suspect the Zika virus, which appeared in the country last year, is to blame. The rare birth defect, which also can be caused by factors such as infections, malnutrition, or drugs, means babies have unusually small heads, 32 centimeters (12.6 inches) or less in circumference, and it can cause lasting developmental problems.\nhttp://medicalxpress.com/news/2016-01-brazil-microcephaly-cases.html\n\n[A 30 Jan 2016 report in the North Shore Journal raises questions about the relationship of Zika virus to microcephaly. It is followed by a lively discussion. Excerpts from the article follow. \"Is there an outbreak of microcephaly in Brazil? That is one of the 1st questions that ought to be asked when examining the topic of the potential effects of a prenatal Zika viral infection... Data exist that suggest that the number of confirmed cases of microcephaly in Brazil will be far lower than the number of reports. In addition, the actual number of cases of microcephaly per year in Brazil prior to the arrival of the Zika viral illness is less clear than it might be. It is impossible to draw a sound conclusion that the Zika outbreak has or has not added to the number of cases of microcephaly in Brazil. The data are suggestive that the number of microcephaly cases will range, in a given 12 months, from normal to 2 or 3 times normal. It remains an issue of great concern but the hype seems to have far exceeded the threat.\"\nhttp://northshorejournal.org/microcephaly-and-zika\n\nA 31 Jan 2016 comment From Stephen Berger, Geographic Medicine, Tel Aviv Medical Center, Tel Aviv Israel (<steve@gideononline.com>) states that \"Zika virus infection has been documented in sub-Saharan Africa since 1947, and numerous publications have already addressed the epidemiology of microcephaly on the continent. I would propose a simple case-control study of the seroprevalence of Zika virus( and other arthropod-borne viruses) among African microcephalics and their mothers.\" ProMED-mail thanks Steve Berger for this comment.\n\nIn a 28 Jan 2016 article, the USA CDC Principal Deputy Director Anne Schuchat told reporters that proving these links would require case-control studies that compare microcephalic babies with those born around the same time and area. That type of information will provide much-needed nuance about other exposures and factors that could influence the health of these mothers and their offspring.\n\nThere is evidence that Zika virus can cross the placenta and infect the fetus. The virus has been shown to be present in amniotic fluid in 2 cases, and in the tissues of a newborn who died shortly after birth. One hopes that the prospective study being done by an interdisciplinary team of medical specialists in Bahia will help to clarify the relationship of maternal Zika virus infection and transmission to the fetus. - Mod.TY]\n\nColombia\n- National. 30 Jan 2016.

The mosquito-borne virus was racing through countries in the Southern Hemisphere, but, at worst, it appeared to cause a mild fever and rash. No longer: on [1 Feb 2016], the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the \"extraordinary\" cluster of microcephaly and other neurological complications that have now been linked to Zika a public health emergency of international concern. And vaccine makers, big and small, have begun the race to head it off. They have a good shot at success, several experts say -- cautioning that vaccine development requires years of testing.\n\nZika [virus] first caused serious concern in May 2015 after it arrived in South America and suspicions grew that infection during pregnancy could cause brain-damaging microcephaly in babies. The link, WHO Director-General Margaret Chan stresses, is \"strongly suspected though not yet scientifically proven\"-- as is a potential connection to Guillain-Barre syndrome, which causes a temporary paralysis in adults. With viral spread increasing, a vaccine is now a top priority.\n\nVaccine pioneer, Stanley Plotkin of the University of Pennsylvania, predicts \"a straightforward developmental pathway\" for a vaccine. He notes that Zika belongs to the flavivirus family, and vaccines exist for several of its relatives, including dengue, yellow fever, and Japanese encephalitis. \"I don't see any technical issues such as the ones that obviously exist for vaccines against HIV, tuberculosis, and many other agents,\" says Plotkin, who consults with several vaccinemakers.\n\nStill, \"there are many puzzles,\" says Thomas Monath, a virologist who studied Zika [virus infections] in wild monkeys in Nigeria in the 1970s and is now the chief scientific officer at NewLink Genetics in Devens, Massachusetts, whose team helped develop a promising Ebola vaccine. For Zika [virus], one unknown is whether infection leads to lifelong protection -- a key feature of diseases for which vaccines are most effective, such as yellow fever. Another question is whether natural or vaccine-induced immunity against other related viruses -- particularly yellow fever -- could offer a measure of \"cross protection,\" which might confuse efforts to evaluate Zika vaccines. Nor have researchers yet established a much-needed monkey model to enable comparisons of candidate vaccines.\n\nApproaches have proliferated. Monath, who has developed vaccines against several flaviviruses, says NewLink will pursue a traditional strategy that inactivates, or kills, the virus with a chemical so it cannot replicate in the body. He thinks an inactivated vaccine has the best chance of winning regulatory approval for a product that pregnant women might use.\n\nAt the nonprofit Butantan Institute in Sao Paulo, Brazil, immunologist and director Jorge Kalil is betting that a weakened, live vaccine can be safe and potentially more effective than killed virus. His team plans to exploit a technology that researchers at the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) used to make a dengue vaccine, which Butantan licensed and is now testing in an efficacy trial. To weaken that virus, researchers deleted genes so it can copy itself but not cause disease. \"Perhaps we can attenuate the Zika virus by using the same deletions of the same sites,\" Kalil says, noting that Butantan likely would partner with NIAID to develop its vaccine. The Brazilian institute has a key advantage: Unlike almost every other institution in the world that does vaccine research, it has an industrial-scale manufacturing plant--last year the institute cranked out 40 million doses of influenza vaccine--so it might be able to supply enough product for Brazil without needing help from big pharma.\n\nNIAID Director Anthony Fauci says his institute has a \"head start\" with a different technology it used to make an experimental vaccine for West Nile, another flavivirus. The manufacturing process begins with a circular \"plasmid\" of DNA that holds key viral genes. When it is inserted into bacterial cells, they produce \"virus-like particles\" that can serve as an inactivated vaccine, because they cannot copy themselves. (The West Nile vaccine worked well in early human studies, but NIAID could not find a commercial partner to take it forward).\n\nInovio Pharmaceuticals of Plymouth Meeting, Pennsylvania, boasts it already has an experimental Zika [virus] vaccine containing nothing more than a plasmid made of Zika genes. With the help of an electrical zap on the skin, the plasmid goes directly into human cells, which make Zika proteins that stimulate the immune system. CEO Jerome Kim says his team already has begun tests in mice. But although researchers can quickly make such simple DNA vaccines, they have lost their luster over the past 20 years because they have not triggered strong immune responses against other diseases. \"There are people very knowledgeable in the field who have lost faith in this technology,\" Kim concedes. \"I want to prove to the field that this technology is viable and perhaps the best option for these types of outbreaks.\"\n\nThe small Jenner Institute in Oxford, UK, is putting the Zika surface protein into harmless chimpanzee adenoviruses, which serve as a \"vector\" -- an approach similar to one used in GSK's [GlaxoSmithKline] Ebola vaccine, which was tested during the West African epidemic. Vaccine makers Protein Sciences of Meriden, Connecticut, and Hawaii Biotech of Honolulu -- which both specialize in producing viral proteins in insect cell lines -- also have projects underway.\n\nPredicting when a vaccine will come to market is a mug's game, but NIAID's Fauci thinks animal studies could be completed in a few months and small human studies to evaluate safety and immune responses could begin by the end of 2016. Even if a promising candidate surfaces, large-scale efficacy trials are probably years away, he says. Getting a vaccine approved and supplying millions of doses could take the resources of a major manufacturer. Of the 4 big pharma companies that make vaccines, only Sanofi Pasteur of Lyon, France -- makers of 3 flavivirus vaccines -- has launched a Zika program, though the others say they are watching the field closely.\n\nAs a stopgap measure, Kalil says Butantan hopes to produce a protective serum for pregnant women, which the institute already makes for several diseases, by injecting Zika virus into horses and harvesting the antibodies the animals make. \"This would take a little over a year,\" Kalil says. \"That's the best timeline -- if you're very, very optimistic.\"\n\n[Byline: Jon Cohen]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n[The progress that these vaccines make will be watched with considerable interest. Even assuming no adverse reactions to a vaccine in phase 1 trials, proof of efficacy in phase 2 and 3 will require considerable time. The cost of development will be substantial. - Mod.TY]\nSee Also\nZika virus (04): WHO declares worldwide PHEIC 20160201.3985366\nZika virus (03): Americas, Asia 20160128.3974426\nZika virus (02):

The Brazil Provisional Measure published today [1 Feb 2016] in the Union Official Daily authorizes forcible entry by public agents fighting the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito into public or private buildings that have been abandoned, or in the absence of the person who could permit entry. The document was signed by President Dilma Rousseff and by Health Minister Marcelo Castro, and grants permission to federal, state, and municipal health authorities. The measure permits the execution of actions to combat the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito and its breeding sites. (http://combateaedes.saude.gov.br/noticias/248-governo-federal-autoriza-entrada-em-casas-abandonadas-para-eliminacao-do-mosquito-aedes-aegypti [in Portuguese]\n\n- Vector species. 28 Jan 2016. Brazilian experts at Oswaldo Cruz Foundation said the virus -- thought to be confined to the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito in the tropics -- may have already crossed over to the _Culex_ mosquito, which would increase its chances of spreading around the world.\nhttp://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/zika-may-spread-to-britain-after-experts-find-virus-carrying-mosquitoes-a6838436.html\n\n[If _Culex_ spp turn out to be vectors of Zika virus, that would be a worrisome development indeed. Many steps must be completed before vector status can be established. Experimentally, the mosquitoes would have to become infected after consuming a blood meal containing a quantity of virus found in a viremic individual and subsequently transmit the virus by bite. In the field, virus would have to be found in mosquitoes captured in areas where human cases were occurring. - Mod.TY]\n\n- Olympic Games concerns. 29 Jan 2016. There is concern about Zika virus infections occurring during the Olympic Games, to be held 5-21 Aug 2016, in Rio de Janeiro. Athletes and visitors may be at risk of exposure. Some 10 000 athletes will be competing at the games with tens of thousands more staff, officials and media attending the world's biggest sporting event, apart from the hundreds of thousands of spectators and visitors in the Brazilian city. Rio de Janeiro's mayor says there is no cause for concern because \"the games will be held in the cooler and drier winter months, when the mosquito population is naturally lower.\" The IOC's [International Olympic Committee] medical commission says, \"We remain confident that there will be a safe environment for successful and enjoyable Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.\" There is concern that individuals participating in or visiting Rio could become infected and further disseminate the virus when they depart.\nhttp://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/01/29/464861254/zika-virus-spurs-concerns-over-summer-games-in-rio\n\n[The WHO has declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). Declaring a PHEIC would be the kiss of death for Brazil's economy, killing the anticipated huge influx of foreign tourists for Carnival and the Rio Olympics, and most foreign investment. - Mod.JW\n\nIt will be interesting to see if release of genetically modified mosquitoes that produce larvae that do not survive (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20160128.3974426), that have reduced _Aedes aegypti_ populations in a pilot field trial in Piracicaba, Sao Paulo state, will be extended to other localities, such as Rio de Janeiro in time for the Olympic Games in August. - Mod.TY]\n\n- Microcephaly. 27 Jan 2016. New figures released [Wed 27 Jan 2016] by Brazil's Health Ministry as part of a probe into the Zika virus have found fewer confirmed cases of a rare brain defect than first feared. So far, only 270 of 4180 suspected cases have been confirmed as microcephaly, with the brain damage associated with the defect ruled out in 462 cases. Researchers are still studying 3448 of the cases, which were recorded from 22 Oct [2015]. Brazilian officials still say they believe there's a sharp increase in cases of microcephaly and strongly suspect the Zika virus, which appeared in the country last year, is to blame. The rare birth defect, which also can be caused by factors such as infections, malnutrition, or drugs, means babies have unusually small heads, 32 centimeters (12.6 inches) or less in circumference, and it can cause lasting developmental problems.\nhttp://medicalxpress.com/news/2016-01-brazil-microcephaly-cases.html\n\n[A 30 Jan 2016 report in the North Shore Journal raises questions about the relationship of Zika virus to microcephaly. It is followed by a lively discussion. Excerpts from the article follow. \"Is there an outbreak of microcephaly in Brazil? That is one of the 1st questions that ought to be asked when examining the topic of the potential effects of a prenatal Zika viral infection... Data exist that suggest that the number of confirmed cases of microcephaly in Brazil will be far lower than the number of reports. In addition, the actual number of cases of microcephaly per year in Brazil prior to the arrival of the Zika viral illness is less clear than it might be. It is impossible to draw a sound conclusion that the Zika outbreak has or has not added to the number of cases of microcephaly in Brazil. The data are suggestive that the number of microcephaly cases will range, in a given 12 months, from normal to 2 or 3 times normal. It remains an issue of great concern but the hype seems to have far exceeded the threat.\"\nhttp://northshorejournal.org/microcephaly-and-zika\n\nA 31 Jan 2016 comment From Stephen Berger, Geographic Medicine, Tel Aviv Medical Center, Tel Aviv Israel (<steve@gideononline.com>) states that \"Zika virus infection has been documented in sub-Saharan Africa since 1947, and numerous publications have already addressed the epidemiology of microcephaly on the continent. I would propose a simple case-control study of the seroprevalence of Zika virus( and other arthropod-borne viruses) among African microcephalics and their mothers.\" ProMED-mail thanks Steve Berger for this comment.\n\nIn a 28 Jan 2016 article, the USA CDC Principal Deputy Director Anne Schuchat told reporters that proving these links would require case-control studies that compare microcephalic babies with those born around the same time and area. That type of information will provide much-needed nuance about other exposures and factors that could influence the health of these mothers and their offspring.\n\nThere is evidence that Zika virus can cross the placenta and infect the fetus. The virus has been shown to be present in amniotic fluid in 2 cases, and in the tissues of a newborn who died shortly after birth. One hopes that the prospective study being done by an interdisciplinary team of medical specialists in Bahia will help to clarify the relationship of maternal Zika virus infection and transmission to the fetus. - Mod.TY]\n\nColombia\n- National. 30 Jan 2016.

(reported) Guillain-Barre syndrome cases following Zika virus infections increased from 15 a week ago to, \"In the past week we have seen a substantial increase in the number of people reported with Guillain-Barre,\" said health minister Alejandro Gaviria.\nhttp://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/28/zika-virus-colombia-paralysis-disorder-guillain-barre\n\nPeru (national). 29 Jan 2016.

The mosquito-borne virus was racing through countries in the Southern Hemisphere, but, at worst, it appeared to cause a mild fever and rash. No longer: on [1 Feb 2016], the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the \"extraordinary\" cluster of microcephaly and other neurological complications that have now been linked to Zika a public health emergency of international concern. And vaccine makers, big and small, have begun the race to head it off. They have a good shot at success, several experts say -- cautioning that vaccine development requires years of testing.\n\nZika [virus] first caused serious concern in May 2015 after it arrived in South America and suspicions grew that infection during pregnancy could cause brain-damaging microcephaly in babies. The link, WHO Director-General Margaret Chan stresses, is \"strongly suspected though not yet scientifically proven\"-- as is a potential connection to Guillain-Barre syndrome, which causes a temporary paralysis in adults. With viral spread increasing, a vaccine is now a top priority.\n\nVaccine pioneer, Stanley Plotkin of the University of Pennsylvania, predicts \"a straightforward developmental pathway\" for a vaccine. He notes that Zika belongs to the flavivirus family, and vaccines exist for several of its relatives, including dengue, yellow fever, and Japanese encephalitis. \"I don't see any technical issues such as the ones that obviously exist for vaccines against HIV, tuberculosis, and many other agents,\" says Plotkin, who consults with several vaccinemakers.\n\nStill, \"there are many puzzles,\" says Thomas Monath, a virologist who studied Zika [virus infections] in wild monkeys in Nigeria in the 1970s and is now the chief scientific officer at NewLink Genetics in Devens, Massachusetts, whose team helped develop a promising Ebola vaccine. For Zika [virus], one unknown is whether infection leads to lifelong protection -- a key feature of diseases for which vaccines are most effective, such as yellow fever. Another question is whether natural or vaccine-induced immunity against other related viruses -- particularly yellow fever -- could offer a measure of \"cross protection,\" which might confuse efforts to evaluate Zika vaccines. Nor have researchers yet established a much-needed monkey model to enable comparisons of candidate vaccines.\n\nApproaches have proliferated. Monath, who has developed vaccines against several flaviviruses, says NewLink will pursue a traditional strategy that inactivates, or kills, the virus with a chemical so it cannot replicate in the body. He thinks an inactivated vaccine has the best chance of winning regulatory approval for a product that pregnant women might use.\n\nAt the nonprofit Butantan Institute in Sao Paulo, Brazil, immunologist and director Jorge Kalil is betting that a weakened, live vaccine can be safe and potentially more effective than killed virus. His team plans to exploit a technology that researchers at the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) used to make a dengue vaccine, which Butantan licensed and is now testing in an efficacy trial. To weaken that virus, researchers deleted genes so it can copy itself but not cause disease. \"Perhaps we can attenuate the Zika virus by using the same deletions of the same sites,\" Kalil says, noting that Butantan likely would partner with NIAID to develop its vaccine. The Brazilian institute has a key advantage: Unlike almost every other institution in the world that does vaccine research, it has an industrial-scale manufacturing plant--last year the institute cranked out 40 million doses of influenza vaccine--so it might be able to supply enough product for Brazil without needing help from big pharma.\n\nNIAID Director Anthony Fauci says his institute has a \"head start\" with a different technology it used to make an experimental vaccine for West Nile, another flavivirus. The manufacturing process begins with a circular \"plasmid\" of DNA that holds key viral genes. When it is inserted into bacterial cells, they produce \"virus-like particles\" that can serve as an inactivated vaccine, because they cannot copy themselves. (The West Nile vaccine worked well in early human studies, but NIAID could not find a commercial partner to take it forward).\n\nInovio Pharmaceuticals of Plymouth Meeting, Pennsylvania, boasts it already has an experimental Zika [virus] vaccine containing nothing more than a plasmid made of Zika genes. With the help of an electrical zap on the skin, the plasmid goes directly into human cells, which make Zika proteins that stimulate the immune system. CEO Jerome Kim says his team already has begun tests in mice. But although researchers can quickly make such simple DNA vaccines, they have lost their luster over the past 20 years because they have not triggered strong immune responses against other diseases. \"There are people very knowledgeable in the field who have lost faith in this technology,\" Kim concedes. \"I want to prove to the field that this technology is viable and perhaps the best option for these types of outbreaks.\"\n\nThe small Jenner Institute in Oxford, UK, is putting the Zika surface protein into harmless chimpanzee adenoviruses, which serve as a \"vector\" -- an approach similar to one used in GSK's [GlaxoSmithKline] Ebola vaccine, which was tested during the West African epidemic. Vaccine makers Protein Sciences of Meriden, Connecticut, and Hawaii Biotech of Honolulu -- which both specialize in producing viral proteins in insect cell lines -- also have projects underway.\n\nPredicting when a vaccine will come to market is a mug's game, but NIAID's Fauci thinks animal studies could be completed in a few months and small human studies to evaluate safety and immune responses could begin by the end of 2016. Even if a promising candidate surfaces, large-scale efficacy trials are probably years away, he says. Getting a vaccine approved and supplying millions of doses could take the resources of a major manufacturer. Of the 4 big pharma companies that make vaccines, only Sanofi Pasteur of Lyon, France -- makers of 3 flavivirus vaccines -- has launched a Zika program, though the others say they are watching the field closely.\n\nAs a stopgap measure, Kalil says Butantan hopes to produce a protective serum for pregnant women, which the institute already makes for several diseases, by injecting Zika virus into horses and harvesting the antibodies the animals make. \"This would take a little over a year,\" Kalil says. \"That's the best timeline -- if you're very, very optimistic.\"\n\n[Byline: Jon Cohen]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n[The progress that these vaccines make will be watched with considerable interest. Even assuming no adverse reactions to a vaccine in phase 1 trials, proof of efficacy in phase 2 and 3 will require considerable time. The cost of development will be substantial. - Mod.TY]\nSee Also\nZika virus (04): WHO declares worldwide PHEIC 20160201.3985366\nZika virus (03): Americas, Asia 20160128.3974426\nZika virus (02):

The Brazil Provisional Measure published today [1 Feb 2016] in the Union Official Daily authorizes forcible entry by public agents fighting the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito into public or private buildings that have been abandoned, or in the absence of the person who could permit entry. The document was signed by President Dilma Rousseff and by Health Minister Marcelo Castro, and grants permission to federal, state, and municipal health authorities. The measure permits the execution of actions to combat the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito and its breeding sites. (http://combateaedes.saude.gov.br/noticias/248-governo-federal-autoriza-entrada-em-casas-abandonadas-para-eliminacao-do-mosquito-aedes-aegypti [in Portuguese]\n\n- Vector species. 28 Jan 2016. Brazilian experts at Oswaldo Cruz Foundation said the virus -- thought to be confined to the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito in the tropics -- may have already crossed over to the _Culex_ mosquito, which would increase its chances of spreading around the world.\nhttp://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/zika-may-spread-to-britain-after-experts-find-virus-carrying-mosquitoes-a6838436.html\n\n[If _Culex_ spp turn out to be vectors of Zika virus, that would be a worrisome development indeed. Many steps must be completed before vector status can be established. Experimentally, the mosquitoes would have to become infected after consuming a blood meal containing a quantity of virus found in a viremic individual and subsequently transmit the virus by bite. In the field, virus would have to be found in mosquitoes captured in areas where human cases were occurring. - Mod.TY]\n\n- Olympic Games concerns. 29 Jan 2016. There is concern about Zika virus infections occurring during the Olympic Games, to be held 5-21 Aug 2016, in Rio de Janeiro. Athletes and visitors may be at risk of exposure. Some 10 000 athletes will be competing at the games with tens of thousands more staff, officials and media attending the world's biggest sporting event, apart from the hundreds of thousands of spectators and visitors in the Brazilian city. Rio de Janeiro's mayor says there is no cause for concern because \"the games will be held in the cooler and drier winter months, when the mosquito population is naturally lower.\" The IOC's [International Olympic Committee] medical commission says, \"We remain confident that there will be a safe environment for successful and enjoyable Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.\" There is concern that individuals participating in or visiting Rio could become infected and further disseminate the virus when they depart.\nhttp://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/01/29/464861254/zika-virus-spurs-concerns-over-summer-games-in-rio\n\n[The WHO has declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). Declaring a PHEIC would be the kiss of death for Brazil's economy, killing the anticipated huge influx of foreign tourists for Carnival and the Rio Olympics, and most foreign investment. - Mod.JW\n\nIt will be interesting to see if release of genetically modified mosquitoes that produce larvae that do not survive (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20160128.3974426), that have reduced _Aedes aegypti_ populations in a pilot field trial in Piracicaba, Sao Paulo state, will be extended to other localities, such as Rio de Janeiro in time for the Olympic Games in August. - Mod.TY]\n\n- Microcephaly. 27 Jan 2016. New figures released [Wed 27 Jan 2016] by Brazil's Health Ministry as part of a probe into the Zika virus have found fewer confirmed cases of a rare brain defect than first feared. So far, only 270 of 4180 suspected cases have been confirmed as microcephaly, with the brain damage associated with the defect ruled out in 462 cases. Researchers are still studying 3448 of the cases, which were recorded from 22 Oct [2015]. Brazilian officials still say they believe there's a sharp increase in cases of microcephaly and strongly suspect the Zika virus, which appeared in the country last year, is to blame. The rare birth defect, which also can be caused by factors such as infections, malnutrition, or drugs, means babies have unusually small heads, 32 centimeters (12.6 inches) or less in circumference, and it can cause lasting developmental problems.\nhttp://medicalxpress.com/news/2016-01-brazil-microcephaly-cases.html\n\n[A 30 Jan 2016 report in the North Shore Journal raises questions about the relationship of Zika virus to microcephaly. It is followed by a lively discussion. Excerpts from the article follow. \"Is there an outbreak of microcephaly in Brazil? That is one of the 1st questions that ought to be asked when examining the topic of the potential effects of a prenatal Zika viral infection... Data exist that suggest that the number of confirmed cases of microcephaly in Brazil will be far lower than the number of reports. In addition, the actual number of cases of microcephaly per year in Brazil prior to the arrival of the Zika viral illness is less clear than it might be. It is impossible to draw a sound conclusion that the Zika outbreak has or has not added to the number of cases of microcephaly in Brazil. The data are suggestive that the number of microcephaly cases will range, in a given 12 months, from normal to 2 or 3 times normal. It remains an issue of great concern but the hype seems to have far exceeded the threat.\"\nhttp://northshorejournal.org/microcephaly-and-zika\n\nA 31 Jan 2016 comment From Stephen Berger, Geographic Medicine, Tel Aviv Medical Center, Tel Aviv Israel (<steve@gideononline.com>) states that \"Zika virus infection has been documented in sub-Saharan Africa since 1947, and numerous publications have already addressed the epidemiology of microcephaly on the continent. I would propose a simple case-control study of the seroprevalence of Zika virus( and other arthropod-borne viruses) among African microcephalics and their mothers.\" ProMED-mail thanks Steve Berger for this comment.\n\nIn a 28 Jan 2016 article, the USA CDC Principal Deputy Director Anne Schuchat told reporters that proving these links would require case-control studies that compare microcephalic babies with those born around the same time and area. That type of information will provide much-needed nuance about other exposures and factors that could influence the health of these mothers and their offspring.\n\nThere is evidence that Zika virus can cross the placenta and infect the fetus. The virus has been shown to be present in amniotic fluid in 2 cases, and in the tissues of a newborn who died shortly after birth. One hopes that the prospective study being done by an interdisciplinary team of medical specialists in Bahia will help to clarify the relationship of maternal Zika virus infection and transmission to the fetus. - Mod.TY]\n\nColombia\n- National. 30 Jan 2016.

The mosquito-borne virus was racing through countries in the Southern Hemisphere, but, at worst, it appeared to cause a mild fever and rash. No longer: on [1 Feb 2016], the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the \"extraordinary\" cluster of microcephaly and other neurological complications that have now been linked to Zika a public health emergency of international concern. And vaccine makers, big and small, have begun the race to head it off. They have a good shot at success, several experts say -- cautioning that vaccine development requires years of testing.\n\nZika [virus] first caused serious concern in May 2015 after it arrived in South America and suspicions grew that infection during pregnancy could cause brain-damaging microcephaly in babies. The link, WHO Director-General Margaret Chan stresses, is \"strongly suspected though not yet scientifically proven\"-- as is a potential connection to Guillain-Barre syndrome, which causes a temporary paralysis in adults. With viral spread increasing, a vaccine is now a top priority.\n\nVaccine pioneer, Stanley Plotkin of the University of Pennsylvania, predicts \"a straightforward developmental pathway\" for a vaccine. He notes that Zika belongs to the flavivirus family, and vaccines exist for several of its relatives, including dengue, yellow fever, and Japanese encephalitis. \"I don't see any technical issues such as the ones that obviously exist for vaccines against HIV, tuberculosis, and many other agents,\" says Plotkin, who consults with several vaccinemakers.\n\nStill, \"there are many puzzles,\" says Thomas Monath, a virologist who studied Zika [virus infections] in wild monkeys in Nigeria in the 1970s and is now the chief scientific officer at NewLink Genetics in Devens, Massachusetts, whose team helped develop a promising Ebola vaccine. For Zika [virus], one unknown is whether infection leads to lifelong protection -- a key feature of diseases for which vaccines are most effective, such as yellow fever. Another question is whether natural or vaccine-induced immunity against other related viruses -- particularly yellow fever -- could offer a measure of \"cross protection,\" which might confuse efforts to evaluate Zika vaccines. Nor have researchers yet established a much-needed monkey model to enable comparisons of candidate vaccines.\n\nApproaches have proliferated. Monath, who has developed vaccines against several flaviviruses, says NewLink will pursue a traditional strategy that inactivates, or kills, the virus with a chemical so it cannot replicate in the body. He thinks an inactivated vaccine has the best chance of winning regulatory approval for a product that pregnant women might use.\n\nAt the nonprofit Butantan Institute in Sao Paulo, Brazil, immunologist and director Jorge Kalil is betting that a weakened, live vaccine can be safe and potentially more effective than killed virus. His team plans to exploit a technology that researchers at the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) used to make a dengue vaccine, which Butantan licensed and is now testing in an efficacy trial. To weaken that virus, researchers deleted genes so it can copy itself but not cause disease. \"Perhaps we can attenuate the Zika virus by using the same deletions of the same sites,\" Kalil says, noting that Butantan likely would partner with NIAID to develop its vaccine. The Brazilian institute has a key advantage: Unlike almost every other institution in the world that does vaccine research, it has an industrial-scale manufacturing plant--last year the institute cranked out 40 million doses of influenza vaccine--so it might be able to supply enough product for Brazil without needing help from big pharma.\n\nNIAID Director Anthony Fauci says his institute has a \"head start\" with a different technology it used to make an experimental vaccine for West Nile, another flavivirus. The manufacturing process begins with a circular \"plasmid\" of DNA that holds key viral genes. When it is inserted into bacterial cells, they produce \"virus-like particles\" that can serve as an inactivated vaccine, because they cannot copy themselves. (The West Nile vaccine worked well in early human studies, but NIAID could not find a commercial partner to take it forward).\n\nInovio Pharmaceuticals of Plymouth Meeting, Pennsylvania, boasts it already has an experimental Zika [virus] vaccine containing nothing more than a plasmid made of Zika genes. With the help of an electrical zap on the skin, the plasmid goes directly into human cells, which make Zika proteins that stimulate the immune system. CEO Jerome Kim says his team already has begun tests in mice. But although researchers can quickly make such simple DNA vaccines, they have lost their luster over the past 20 years because they have not triggered strong immune responses against other diseases. \"There are people very knowledgeable in the field who have lost faith in this technology,\" Kim concedes. \"I want to prove to the field that this technology is viable and perhaps the best option for these types of outbreaks.\"\n\nThe small Jenner Institute in Oxford, UK, is putting the Zika surface protein into harmless chimpanzee adenoviruses, which serve as a \"vector\" -- an approach similar to one used in GSK's [GlaxoSmithKline] Ebola vaccine, which was tested during the West African epidemic. Vaccine makers Protein Sciences of Meriden, Connecticut, and Hawaii Biotech of Honolulu -- which both specialize in producing viral proteins in insect cell lines -- also have projects underway.\n\nPredicting when a vaccine will come to market is a mug's game, but NIAID's Fauci thinks animal studies could be completed in a few months and small human studies to evaluate safety and immune responses could begin by the end of 2016. Even if a promising candidate surfaces, large-scale efficacy trials are probably years away, he says. Getting a vaccine approved and supplying millions of doses could take the resources of a major manufacturer. Of the 4 big pharma companies that make vaccines, only Sanofi Pasteur of Lyon, France -- makers of 3 flavivirus vaccines -- has launched a Zika program, though the others say they are watching the field closely.\n\nAs a stopgap measure, Kalil says Butantan hopes to produce a protective serum for pregnant women, which the institute already makes for several diseases, by injecting Zika virus into horses and harvesting the antibodies the animals make. \"This would take a little over a year,\" Kalil says. \"That's the best timeline -- if you're very, very optimistic.\"\n\n[Byline: Jon Cohen]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n[The progress that these vaccines make will be watched with considerable interest. Even assuming no adverse reactions to a vaccine in phase 1 trials, proof of efficacy in phase 2 and 3 will require considerable time. The cost of development will be substantial. - Mod.TY]\nSee Also\nZika virus (04): WHO declares worldwide PHEIC 20160201.3985366\nZika virus (03): Americas, Asia 20160128.3974426\nZika virus (02): Americas 20160111.3925377\nZika virus -

Mod.TY, edited]\n<thiago.fructuoso@gmail.com>\n\n\nI lived outside of Brazil for 4 years, and in March [2015], I moved to Bahia. My wife, 3-4 months pregnant, was hit by [a] Zika [virus infection], and at this time, my [fetal] daughter was diagnosed with microcephaly at the 5th [gestational] month.\n\nThe 2 ultrasonographers who we visited stated that these cases have increased a lot in their practices. Last year [2014], neither of the 2 had any cases [of microcephaly] in Bahia, and this year [2015], each have had more than 8 cases due to be born in October-November 2015. My daughter was due to be born on 5 Nov [2015].\n\nI am convinced that there is a relationship [between Zika virus infection and microencephaly] and that we are not the only ones. A number of cases in Bahia, all related to Zika [virus infections] between the 4th and 5th month of gestation, coincided with due dates for births in October and November 2015.\n\n[2 days later, the contributor added these comments:]\n\nAt the time of the examination, dengue and other diseases were all negative. Symptoms appeared at the time that there was a great Zika epidemic in the north east, leading doctors to diagnose the disease without much difficulty. We also did tests for cytomegalovirus, toxoplasmosis, HIV, syphilis, rubella, and all were negative. I have pictures of my pregnant wife with patches on the skin characteristic of Zika.\n\nI found out that the government of Pernambuco created a page for the reporting of all cases born with microcephaly but are classifying such illnesses as an HC [head circumference] less than 33 cm, with which I do not agree. I have a friend here in Bahia and in Rio de Janeiro who had children born with an HC of 31cm and today are normal children 4 years old. I do not know whether there have always been the large numbers of microcephalic [children] or whether the system became more sensitive by the existence of the current suspicion of Zika virus infections.\n\n--\nThiago Fructuoso\nBradesco\n<thiago.fructuoso@gmail.com>\n\n[The fundamental question is whether cases of microencephaly are occurring coincident with maternal infection with Zika virus. There seems to be no standard, fixed measurement for microencephaly. I consulted a pediatrician at a large USA medical center to clarify the criteria used to define microencephaly. He wrote: \"The definition of microcephaly is not standardized. It is sometimes defined as an occipitofrontal circumference (OFC) more than 3 standard deviations (SD) below the mean for a given age, sex, and gestation. Other times, it is defined as an OFC of more than 2 SD below the appropriate mean (that is, less than the 3rd percentile). It is important to record measurements rather than percentiles, as head circumference charts vary, especially up to the age of 3 years, and to use the most recent culturally and ethnically relevant charts to determine percentiles.\n\n\"If microcephaly is defined as a head size less than 3 SD below the appropriate mean, it is more likely to be associated with genetic and non-genetic disorders affecting brain development. In contrast, if microcephaly is defined as more than 2 SD below the mean, many intellectually normal individuals who have a head circumference at the low end of the population distribution will be included.\"\n\nProMED-mail would appreciate receiving additional information on this case. Was the daughter truly microencephalic per the criteria given above (any standard deviations from the mean for her cohort)? Was there any evidence of Zika virus persistence in the correspondent's daughter after her birth? Was Zika virus infection of the wife confirmed serologically or by presence of the virus by PCR or virus isolation?\n\nProMED-mail would be very interested in receiving information from knowledgeable sources about the other Bahia cases of microencephaly mentioned, and their relationship to maternal Zika virus infection, if any. Given the substantial increase in Zika virus infections in Brazil and now in Colombia, informed observations on occurrence of microencephaly would be of interest as well.

Mod.TY, edited]\n<thiago.fructuoso@gmail.com>\n\n\nI lived outside of Brazil for 4 years, and in March [2015], I moved to Bahia. My wife, 3-4 months pregnant, was hit by [a] Zika [virus infection], and at this time, my [fetal] daughter was diagnosed with microcephaly at the 5th [gestational] month.\n\nThe 2 ultrasonographers who we visited stated that these cases have increased a lot in their practices. Last year [2014], neither of the 2 had any cases [of microcephaly] in Bahia, and this year [2015], each have had more than 8 cases due to be born in October-November 2015. My daughter was due to be born on 5 Nov [2015].\n\nI am convinced that there is a relationship [between Zika virus infection and microencephaly] and that we are not the only ones. A number of cases in Bahia, all related to Zika [virus infections] between the 4th and 5th month of gestation, coincided with due dates for births in October and November 2015.\n\n[2 days later, the contributor added these comments:]\n\nAt the time of the examination, dengue and other diseases were all negative. Symptoms appeared at the time that there was a great Zika epidemic in the north east, leading doctors to diagnose the disease without much difficulty. We also did tests for cytomegalovirus, toxoplasmosis, HIV, syphilis, rubella, and all were negative. I have pictures of my pregnant wife with patches on the skin characteristic of Zika.\n\nI found out that the government of Pernambuco created a page for the reporting of all cases born with microcephaly but are classifying such illnesses as an HC [head circumference] less than 33 cm, with which I do not agree. I have a friend here in Bahia and in Rio de Janeiro who had children born with an HC of 31cm and today are normal children 4 years old. I do not know whether there have always been the large numbers of microcephalic [children] or whether the system became more sensitive by the existence of the current suspicion of Zika virus infections.\n\n--\nThiago Fructuoso\nBradesco\n<thiago.fructuoso@gmail.com>\n\n[The fundamental question is whether cases of microencephaly are occurring coincident with maternal infection with Zika virus. There seems to be no standard, fixed measurement for microencephaly. I consulted a pediatrician at a large USA medical center to clarify the criteria used to define microencephaly. He wrote: \"The definition of microcephaly is not standardized. It is sometimes defined as an occipitofrontal circumference (OFC) more than 3 standard deviations (SD) below the mean for a given age, sex, and gestation.

Mod.TY, edited]\n<thiago.fructuoso@gmail.com>\n\n\nI lived outside of Brazil for 4 years, and in March [2015], I moved to Bahia. My wife, 3-4 months pregnant, was hit by [a] Zika [virus infection], and at this time, my [fetal] daughter was diagnosed with microcephaly at the 5th [gestational] month.\n\nThe 2 ultrasonographers who we visited stated that these cases have increased a lot in their practices. Last year [2014], neither of the 2 had any cases [of microcephaly] in Bahia, and this year [2015], each have had more than 8 cases due to be born in October-November 2015. My daughter was due to be born on 5 Nov [2015].\n\nI am convinced that there is a relationship [between Zika virus infection and microencephaly] and that we are not the only ones. A number of cases in Bahia, all related to Zika [virus infections] between the 4th and 5th month of gestation, coincided with due dates for births in October and November 2015.\n\n[2 days later, the contributor added these comments:]\n\nAt the time of the examination, dengue and other diseases were all negative. Symptoms appeared at the time that there was a great Zika epidemic in the north east, leading doctors to diagnose the disease without much difficulty. We also did tests for cytomegalovirus, toxoplasmosis, HIV, syphilis, rubella, and all were negative. I have pictures of my pregnant wife with patches on the skin characteristic of Zika.\n\nI found out that the government of Pernambuco created a page for the reporting of all cases born with microcephaly but are classifying such illnesses as an HC [head circumference] less than 33 cm, with which I do not agree. I have a friend here in Bahia and in Rio de Janeiro who had children born with an HC of 31cm and today are normal children 4 years old. I do not know whether there have always been the large numbers of microcephalic [children] or whether the system became more sensitive by the existence of the current suspicion of Zika virus infections.\n\n--\nThiago Fructuoso\nBradesco\n<thiago.fructuoso@gmail.com>\n\n[The fundamental question is whether cases of microencephaly are occurring coincident with maternal infection with Zika virus. There seems to be no standard, fixed measurement for microencephaly. I consulted a pediatrician at a large USA medical center to clarify the criteria used to define microencephaly. He wrote: \"The definition of microcephaly is not standardized. It is sometimes defined as an occipitofrontal circumference (OFC) more than 3 standard deviations (SD) below the mean for a given age, sex, and gestation. Other times, it is defined as an OFC of more than 2 SD below the appropriate mean (that is, less than the 3rd percentile). It is important to record measurements rather than percentiles, as head circumference charts vary, especially up to the age of 3 years, and to use the most recent culturally and ethnically relevant charts to determine percentiles.\n\n\"If microcephaly is defined as a head size less than 3 SD below the appropriate mean, it is more likely to be associated with genetic and non-genetic disorders affecting brain development. In contrast, if microcephaly is defined as more than 2 SD below the mean, many intellectually normal individuals who have a head circumference at the low end of the population distribution will be included.\"\n\nProMED-mail would appreciate receiving additional information on this case. Was the daughter truly microencephalic per the criteria given above (any standard deviations from the mean for her cohort)? Was there any evidence of Zika virus persistence in the correspondent's daughter after her birth? Was Zika virus infection of the wife confirmed serologically or by presence of the virus by PCR or virus isolation?\n\nProMED-mail would be very interested in receiving information from knowledgeable sources about the other Bahia cases of microencephaly mentioned, and their relationship to maternal Zika virus infection, if any. Given the substantial increase in Zika virus infections in Brazil and now in Colombia, informed observations on occurrence of microencephaly would be of interest as well. Meanwhile, physicians attending women who have been infected with Zika virus while pregnant might be aware of this apparent association and report cases of microencephaly.\n\nPerinatal transmission of Zika virus has been observed (Besnard M, Last\u00e8re S, Teissier A, Cao-Lormeau VM, Musso D.

According to reports shared by the Health Departments of the states of Bahia, Maranhao, Pernambuco, Rio Grande do Norte, Paraiba, and Sergipe, all cases have a benign course with spontaneous recovery, even without treatment. According to information passed to the Ministry of Health, 6807 cases of rash illness so far have been identified in the region. It is noteworthy that there have been no serious cases or deaths.\n\nThe most common signs and symptoms are rash (red spots) and pruritus (itching). To a lesser extent, cases with low-grade fever or no fever, with or without headache, pain or swelling in the joints, and muscle pain. The age group 20-40 years was the most affected. But there are reports of a patients 4 months old and another 98 years old.\n\nAccording to the clinical features, the main assumptions in the investigations are: dengue, rubella, parvovirus B19, chikungunya, and measles, and other arboviruses and enteroviruses. So far, among 425 samples collected and tested, approximately 13 percent were positive for dengue. However, the clinical features available for now are not only characteristic of dengue cases. However, some samples tested for measles, rubella, chikungunya, and parvovirus were negative.\n\nIn order to identify the causative agent of this rash illness and to propose appropriate prevention and control measures, the SVS is conducting field investigations in collaboration with the Health Departments of Maranhao, Rio Grande do Norte, and Paraiba. In these investigations, they are including clinical aspects of patients and collecting samples, principally blood, which will be forwarded to the state and national reference laboratories.\n\nSimultaneously, all health surveillances states and Northeast municipalities continue investigating and monitoring cases. The SVS and the Health Departments of the states of Alagoas, Bahia, Ceara, Maranhao, Paraiba, Piaui, Rio Grande do Norte, and Sergipe are conducting systematic monitoring through the Strategic Information Centres of Health Surveillance (CIEVS).\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-PORT\n<promed-port@promedmail.org>\n\n[Maps of Brazil can be seen at http://s13.postimg.org/jumnalk87/map_of_Brazil.gif and http://healthmap.org/promed/p/6. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ]\n\n******\n[2] Brazil: (Rio de Janeiro) RFI\nData: Mon 13 Apr 2015\nSource: Globo [in Portuguese, trans.

For the past 30 days, hundreds were treated at municipal First Aid post with similar symptoms. \"An average 250 to 300 visits a day, most with joint pain, pain behind the eyes, fever, and itching, a rash on the body,\" explained Dr Erica Quintal Teixeira Fernandes [at present, dengue would be the most likely case. - Mod.RNA]\n\nIt happened with a merchant who 3 weeks ago began to feel discomfort [what type of discomfort? - Mod.RNA], followed by itching in the legs. Small bubbles and then spots began to appear [on his body], and the malaise worsened. After consulting the medical unit, he was treated for allergy and the itching decreased, but the marks on the body continued. Days later, his sons also went through the same problem. \"We had headache, dizziness, shortness of breath, and vomiting,\" they said.\n\nAccording to Health Surveillance, the prime suspect is that this is a new mutation of the dengue virus [based on what evidence? - Mod.RNA]. \"With the investigations which the surveillance performs in relation to the symptoms, we can guarantee that 70 percent of these cases are dengue [confirmed by laboratory testing? And the other 30 percent? - Mod.RNA],\" said Adriane Garcia da Rosa.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-PORT\n<promed-port@promedmail.org>\n\n[These are, at the very least, worrying statements/speculations like \"a new mutation of the dengue virus,\" used to attribute to dengue events/cases that perhaps are not even being investigated and (laboratory confirmed or discounted) systematically.\n\nInvestigations conducted by the Departments of Health of the states and the Ministry of Health are essential for elucidating and understanding the outbreaks that have been described.\n\nUse of standardized case definitions and research lab protocols (sample collection and laboratory analysis) is mandatory, especially now that Zika virus has been announced as having been confirmed by a research laboratory (see below).\n\nQuestion: Would the Zika virus be the \"only\" agent to be implicated in the cases/outbreaks that have been reported in the Northeast? Would it be circulating in (and infecting) other states? Let's keep our eyes open. - Mod.RNA\n\nSince 8 Feb 2015 ProMED-PORT has posted reports in Portuguese of hundreds of cases of fever with rash and joint pains in several northeastern states of Brazil: Bahia, Maranhao, Paraiba, Pernambuco and Piaui (see map at\nhttp://viajerobrasil.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/mapa-brasil-2-839x735.jpg\n\nNow a Brazilian research group has reported identifying the cause as the mosquito-borne Zika virus:\nSource: Globo (in Portuguese)\nhttp://g1.globo.com/bahia/noticia/2015/04/identificado-virus-causador-de-doenca-misteriosa-em-salvador-e-rms.html.\n\nOther mosquito-borne viruses with similar symptoms such as dengue and chikungunya were excluded previously. They identified the virus by the PCR test, which detects signature portions of viral RNA. But Zika virus belongs to the group known as flaviviruses, which are notorious among virologists for their cross-reactions in lab tests. Until the actual virus is isolated, we cannot be certain it is not a totally new agent of the flavivirus group.\n\nZika seems unlikely, because it up to now it has only been detected in Africa, Asia, and the Pacific.

According to reports shared by the Health Departments of the states of Bahia, Maranhao, Pernambuco, Rio Grande do Norte, Paraiba, and Sergipe, all cases have a benign course with spontaneous recovery, even without treatment. According to information passed to the Ministry of Health, 6807 cases of rash illness so far have been identified in the region. It is noteworthy that there have been no serious cases or deaths.\n\nThe most common signs and symptoms are rash (red spots) and pruritus (itching). To a lesser extent, cases with low-grade fever or no fever, with or without headache, pain or swelling in the joints, and muscle pain. The age group 20-40 years was the most affected. But there are reports of a patients 4 months old and another 98 years old.\n\nAccording to the clinical features, the main assumptions in the investigations are: dengue, rubella, parvovirus B19, chikungunya, and measles, and other arboviruses and enteroviruses. So far, among 425 samples collected and tested, approximately 13 percent were positive for dengue. However, the clinical features available for now are not only characteristic of dengue cases. However, some samples tested for measles, rubella, chikungunya, and parvovirus were negative.\n\nIn order to identify the causative agent of this rash illness and to propose appropriate prevention and control measures, the SVS is conducting field investigations in collaboration with the Health Departments of Maranhao, Rio Grande do Norte, and Paraiba. In these investigations, they are including clinical aspects of patients and collecting samples, principally blood, which will be forwarded to the state and national reference laboratories.\n\nSimultaneously, all health surveillances states and Northeast municipalities continue investigating and monitoring cases.

According to reports shared by the Health Departments of the states of Bahia, Maranhao, Pernambuco, Rio Grande do Norte, Paraiba, and Sergipe, all cases have a benign course with spontaneous recovery, even without treatment. According to information passed to the Ministry of Health, 6807 cases of rash illness so far have been identified in the region. It is noteworthy that there have been no serious cases or deaths.\n\nThe most common signs and symptoms are rash (red spots) and pruritus (itching). To a lesser extent, cases with low-grade fever or no fever, with or without headache, pain or swelling in the joints, and muscle pain. The age group 20-40 years was the most affected. But there are reports of a patients 4 months old and another 98 years old.\n\nAccording to the clinical features, the main assumptions in the investigations are: dengue, rubella, parvovirus B19, chikungunya, and measles, and other arboviruses and enteroviruses. So far, among 425 samples collected and tested, approximately 13 percent were positive for dengue. However, the clinical features available for now are not only characteristic of dengue cases. However, some samples tested for measles, rubella, chikungunya, and parvovirus were negative.\n\nIn order to identify the causative agent of this rash illness and to propose appropriate prevention and control measures, the SVS is conducting field investigations in collaboration with the Health Departments of Maranhao, Rio Grande do Norte, and Paraiba. In these investigations, they are including clinical aspects of patients and collecting samples, principally blood, which will be forwarded to the state and national reference laboratories.\n\nSimultaneously, all health surveillances states and Northeast municipalities continue investigating and monitoring cases.

According to reports shared by the Health Departments of the states of Bahia, Maranhao, Pernambuco, Rio Grande do Norte, Paraiba, and Sergipe, all cases have a benign course with spontaneous recovery, even without treatment. According to information passed to the Ministry of Health, 6807 cases of rash illness so far have been identified in the region. It is noteworthy that there have been no serious cases or deaths.\n\nThe most common signs and symptoms are rash (red spots) and pruritus (itching). To a lesser extent, cases with low-grade fever or no fever, with or without headache, pain or swelling in the joints, and muscle pain. The age group 20-40 years was the most affected. But there are reports of a patients 4 months old and another 98 years old.\n\nAccording to the clinical features, the main assumptions in the investigations are: dengue, rubella, parvovirus B19, chikungunya, and measles, and other arboviruses and enteroviruses. So far, among 425 samples collected and tested, approximately 13 percent were positive for dengue. However, the clinical features available for now are not only characteristic of dengue cases. However, some samples tested for measles, rubella, chikungunya, and parvovirus were negative.\n\nIn order to identify the causative agent of this rash illness and to propose appropriate prevention and control measures, the SVS is conducting field investigations in collaboration with the Health Departments of Maranhao, Rio Grande do Norte, and Paraiba. In these investigations, they are including clinical aspects of patients and collecting samples, principally blood, which will be forwarded to the state and national reference laboratories.\n\nSimultaneously, all health surveillances states and Northeast municipalities continue investigating and monitoring cases. The SVS and the Health Departments of the states of Alagoas, Bahia, Ceara, Maranhao, Paraiba, Piaui, Rio Grande do Norte, and Sergipe are conducting systematic monitoring through the Strategic Information Centres of Health Surveillance (CIEVS).\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-PORT\n<promed-port@promedmail.org>\n\n[Maps of Brazil can be seen at http://s13.postimg.org/jumnalk87/map_of_Brazil.gif and http://healthmap.org/promed/p/6. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ]\n\n******\n[2] Brazil: (Rio de Janeiro) RFI\nData: Mon 13 Apr 2015\nSource: Globo [in Portuguese, trans.

Potential for Zika virus transmission through blood transfusion demonstrated during an outbreak in French Polynesia, November 2013 to February 2014.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nSummary\n-------\nSince October 2013, French Polynesia has experienced the largest documented outbreak of Zika virus (ZIKAV) infection. To prevent transmission of ZIKAV by blood transfusion, specific nucleic acid testing of blood donors was implemented. From November 2013 to February 2014: 42 (3 per cent) of 1505 blood donors, although asymptomatic at the time of blood donation, were found positive for ZIKAV by PCR. Our results serve to alert blood safety authorities about the risk of post-transfusion Zika fever.\n\nZika virus infection in French Polynesia: implications for blood transfusion\n----------------------------------------------------------------\nFrench Polynesia, in the South Pacific, has experienced the largest reported outbreak of ZIKAV infection, which began in October 2013, with an estimated 28 000 cases in February 2014 (about 11 per cent of the population), concomitantly with the circulation of dengue virus (DENV) serotypes 1 and 3. To the best of our knowledge, the occurrence of ZIKAV infection resulting from transfusion of infected blood has not been investigated. Since other arboviruses have been reported to be transmitted by blood transfusion, several prevention procedures were implemented in date to prevent transfusion of ZIKAV through transmission in French Polynesia, including nucleic acid testing (NAT) of blood donors. We report here the detection of ZIKAV in 42 of 1505 blood donors, who were asymptomatic at the time of blood donation.\n\nDiscussion\n----------\nThe main challenge in the prevention of arbovirus transfusion-derived transmission is the high rate of asymptomatic infections: this has been estimated at over 75 per cent for DENV and West Nile virus (WNV). For ZIKAV, there is no estimate available of the percentage of asymptomatic infections.\n\nArbovirus transfusion-derived transmission has been reported principally for WNV, DENV and chikungunya virus (CHIKV). For CHIKV, the risk was evaluated as high.\n\nDuring the outbreaks of CHIKV infection in Italy (2007) and in Reunion Island in the Indian Ocean (2005-2007), blood donation was discontinued and blood products were imported from blood bank centres elsewhere. In French Polynesia, due to its geographically isolated location, it was impossible to be supplied with fresh blood products from blood bank centres outside French Polynesia.\n\nDue to the potential risk of ZIKAV transfusion-derived transmission, the need to continue blood donations and the lack of a licensed test for ZIKAV diagnosis, we decided to implement ZIKAV NAT as soon as possible, using a modified RT-PCR. The protocol was implemented in November 2013, when agreement from the French Polynesian health authorities was obtained. The specificity of this RT-PCR assay has been previously evaluated and was confirmed by sequencing analysis conducted during the outbreak in French Polynesia and its sensitivity was similar to that previously evaluated.\n\nWe detected an unexpectedly high number of positive asymptomatic blood donors (42/1505; 3 per cent). To date, no post-transfusion ZIKAV infection has been reported in recipients of ZIKAV-positive blood in French Polynesia; however, haemovigilance studies are still ongoing.\n\nDue to concomitant circulation of DENV serotypes 1 and 3 since early 2013, multiplex NAT testing for DENV has been implemented from April 2013: no DENV-positive donor has yet been detected. While this might be related to a low level of viraemia in asymptomatic donors, we consider it was probably due to the low level of DENV-1 and DENV-3 circulation. Pathogen inactivation of platelet concentrates using a photochemical treatment (amotosalen) of blood products and ultraviolet A light inactivation was also implemented.\n\nThe management of a dual outbreak of ZIKAV and DENV infection was challenging because we had to test all blood donors for both pathogens, which was time consuming and expensive. In addition, in our blood bank centre, the mean delay between blood donation and production of fresh blood product available for transfusion is generally 24 hours. During the outbreaks, the mean delay was 3 days.\n\nThis report serves as a reminder of the importance of quickly adapting blood donation safety procedures to the local epidemiological context. Moreover, it should help in anticipating the needs in other parts of the Pacific region, such as in New Caledonia (South Pacific), where an outbreak of ZIKAV infection started in February 2014.\n\nOur findings suggest that ZIKAV NAT should be used to prevent blood transfusion-transmitted ZIKAV. As recommended by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, blood safety authorities need to be vigilant and should consider deferral of blood donors returning from areas with an outbreak of ZIKAV infection. In areas endemic for _Aedes_ species, a preparedness plan to respond to future outbreaks of ZIKAV infection should include emergency plans to sustain the blood supply.\n\n[The full report with references may be found at the URL above. - Mod.SH]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The response of the health authorities in French Polynesia in dealing with maintenance of a safe blood supply during a significant outbreak of a virus disease new to the area is outstanding.

To date, no post-transfusion ZIKAV infection has been reported in recipients of ZIKAV-positive blood in French Polynesia; however, haemovigilance studies are still ongoing.\n\nDue to concomitant circulation of DENV serotypes 1 and 3 since early 2013, multiplex NAT testing for DENV has been implemented from April 2013: no DENV-positive donor has yet been detected. While this might be related to a low level of viraemia in asymptomatic donors, we consider it was probably due to the low level of DENV-1 and DENV-3 circulation. Pathogen inactivation of platelet concentrates using a photochemical treatment (amotosalen) of blood products and ultraviolet A light inactivation was also implemented.\n\nThe management of a dual outbreak of ZIKAV and DENV infection was challenging because we had to test all blood donors for both pathogens, which was time consuming and expensive. In addition, in our blood bank centre, the mean delay between blood donation and production of fresh blood product available for transfusion is generally 24 hours. During the outbreaks, the mean delay was 3 days.\n\nThis report serves as a reminder of the importance of quickly adapting blood donation safety procedures to the local epidemiological context.

Potential for Zika virus transmission through blood transfusion demonstrated during an outbreak in French Polynesia, November 2013 to February 2014.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nSummary\n-------\nSince October 2013, French Polynesia has experienced the largest documented outbreak of Zika virus (ZIKAV) infection. To prevent transmission of ZIKAV by blood transfusion, specific nucleic acid testing of blood donors was implemented. From November 2013 to February 2014: 42 (3 per cent) of 1505 blood donors, although asymptomatic at the time of blood donation, were found positive for ZIKAV by PCR. Our results serve to alert blood safety authorities about the risk of post-transfusion Zika fever.\n\nZika virus infection in French Polynesia: implications for blood transfusion\n----------------------------------------------------------------\nFrench Polynesia, in the South Pacific, has experienced the largest reported outbreak of ZIKAV infection, which began in October 2013, with an estimated 28 000 cases in February 2014 (about 11 per cent of the population), concomitantly with the circulation of dengue virus (DENV) serotypes 1 and 3. To the best of our knowledge, the occurrence of ZIKAV infection resulting from transfusion of infected blood has not been investigated. Since other arboviruses have been reported to be transmitted by blood transfusion, several prevention procedures were implemented in date to prevent transfusion of ZIKAV through transmission in French Polynesia, including nucleic acid testing (NAT) of blood donors. We report here the detection of ZIKAV in 42 of 1505 blood donors, who were asymptomatic at the time of blood donation.\n\nDiscussion\n----------\nThe main challenge in the prevention of arbovirus transfusion-derived transmission is the high rate of asymptomatic infections: this has been estimated at over 75 per cent for DENV and West Nile virus (WNV). For ZIKAV, there is no estimate available of the percentage of asymptomatic infections.\n\nArbovirus transfusion-derived transmission has been reported principally for WNV, DENV and chikungunya virus (CHIKV). For CHIKV, the risk was evaluated as high.\n\nDuring the outbreaks of CHIKV infection in Italy (2007) and in Reunion Island in the Indian Ocean (2005-2007), blood donation was discontinued and blood products were imported from blood bank centres elsewhere. In French Polynesia, due to its geographically isolated location, it was impossible to be supplied with fresh blood products from blood bank centres outside French Polynesia.\n\nDue to the potential risk of ZIKAV transfusion-derived transmission, the need to continue blood donations and the lack of a licensed test for ZIKAV diagnosis, we decided to implement ZIKAV NAT as soon as possible, using a modified RT-PCR. The protocol was implemented in November 2013, when agreement from the French Polynesian health authorities was obtained. The specificity of this RT-PCR assay has been previously evaluated and was confirmed by sequencing analysis conducted during the outbreak in French Polynesia and its sensitivity was similar to that previously evaluated.\n\nWe detected an unexpectedly high number of positive asymptomatic blood donors (42/1505; 3 per cent). To date, no post-transfusion ZIKAV infection has been reported in recipients of ZIKAV-positive blood in French Polynesia; however, haemovigilance studies are still ongoing.\n\nDue to concomitant circulation of DENV serotypes 1 and 3 since early 2013, multiplex NAT testing for DENV has been implemented from April 2013: no DENV-positive donor has yet been detected. While this might be related to a low level of viraemia in asymptomatic donors, we consider it was probably due to the low level of DENV-1 and DENV-3 circulation. Pathogen inactivation of platelet concentrates using a photochemical treatment (amotosalen) of blood products and ultraviolet A light inactivation was also implemented.\n\nThe management of a dual outbreak of ZIKAV and DENV infection was challenging because we had to test all blood donors for both pathogens, which was time consuming and expensive.

Potential for Zika virus transmission through blood transfusion demonstrated during an outbreak in French Polynesia, November 2013 to February 2014.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nSummary\n-------\nSince October 2013, French Polynesia has experienced the largest documented outbreak of Zika virus (ZIKAV) infection. To prevent transmission of ZIKAV by blood transfusion, specific nucleic acid testing of blood donors was implemented. From November 2013 to February 2014: 42 (3 per cent) of 1505 blood donors, although asymptomatic at the time of blood donation, were found positive for ZIKAV by PCR. Our results serve to alert blood safety authorities about the risk of post-transfusion Zika fever.\n\nZika virus infection in French Polynesia: implications for blood transfusion\n----------------------------------------------------------------\nFrench Polynesia, in the South Pacific, has experienced the largest reported outbreak of ZIKAV infection, which began in October 2013, with an estimated 28 000 cases in February 2014 (about 11 per cent of the population), concomitantly with the circulation of dengue virus (DENV) serotypes 1 and 3. To the best of our knowledge, the occurrence of ZIKAV infection resulting from transfusion of infected blood has not been investigated. Since other arboviruses have been reported to be transmitted by blood transfusion, several prevention procedures were implemented in date to prevent transfusion of ZIKAV through transmission in French Polynesia, including nucleic acid testing (NAT) of blood donors. We report here the detection of ZIKAV in 42 of 1505 blood donors, who were asymptomatic at the time of blood donation.\n\nDiscussion\n----------\nThe main challenge in the prevention of arbovirus transfusion-derived transmission is the high rate of asymptomatic infections: this has been estimated at over 75 per cent for DENV and West Nile virus (WNV). For ZIKAV, there is no estimate available of the percentage of asymptomatic infections.\n\nArbovirus transfusion-derived transmission has been reported principally for WNV, DENV and chikungunya virus (CHIKV). For CHIKV, the risk was evaluated as high.\n\nDuring the outbreaks of CHIKV infection in Italy (2007) and in Reunion Island in the Indian Ocean (2005-2007), blood donation was discontinued and blood products were imported from blood bank centres elsewhere. In French Polynesia, due to its geographically isolated location, it was impossible to be supplied with fresh blood products from blood bank centres outside French Polynesia.\n\nDue to the potential risk of ZIKAV transfusion-derived transmission, the need to continue blood donations and the lack of a licensed test for ZIKAV diagnosis, we decided to implement ZIKAV NAT as soon as possible, using a modified RT-PCR. The protocol was implemented in November 2013, when agreement from the French Polynesian health authorities was obtained. The specificity of this RT-PCR assay has been previously evaluated and was confirmed by sequencing analysis conducted during the outbreak in French Polynesia and its sensitivity was similar to that previously evaluated.\n\nWe detected an unexpectedly high number of positive asymptomatic blood donors (42/1505; 3 per cent). To date, no post-transfusion ZIKAV infection has been reported in recipients of ZIKAV-positive blood in French Polynesia; however, haemovigilance studies are still ongoing.\n\nDue to concomitant circulation of DENV serotypes 1 and 3 since early 2013, multiplex NAT testing for DENV has been implemented from April 2013: no DENV-positive donor has yet been detected. While this might be related to a low level of viraemia in asymptomatic donors, we consider it was probably due to the low level of DENV-1 and DENV-3 circulation. Pathogen inactivation of platelet concentrates using a photochemical treatment (amotosalen) of blood products and ultraviolet A light inactivation was also implemented.\n\nThe management of a dual outbreak of ZIKAV and DENV infection was challenging because we had to test all blood donors for both pathogens, which was time consuming and expensive. In addition, in our blood bank centre, the mean delay between blood donation and production of fresh blood product available for transfusion is generally 24 hours. During the outbreaks, the mean delay was 3 days.\n\nThis report serves as a reminder of the importance of quickly adapting blood donation safety procedures to the local epidemiological context. Moreover, it should help in anticipating the needs in other parts of the Pacific region, such as in New Caledonia (South Pacific), where an outbreak of ZIKAV infection started in February 2014.\n\nOur findings suggest that ZIKAV NAT should be used to prevent blood transfusion-transmitted ZIKAV. As recommended by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, blood safety authorities need to be vigilant and should consider deferral of blood donors returning from areas with an outbreak of ZIKAV infection. In areas endemic for _Aedes_ species, a preparedness plan to respond to future outbreaks of ZIKAV infection should include emergency plans to sustain the blood supply.\n\n[The full report with references may be found at the URL above. - Mod.SH]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The response of the health authorities in French Polynesia in dealing with maintenance of a safe blood supply during a significant outbreak of a virus disease new to the area is outstanding.

The probable cases are not laboratory confirmed, but do meet\nthe current case definition. According to the Guam Department of\nPublic Health, the 2 probable cases are from adults who had recently\ntraveled to Yap. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC), the\nWorld Health Organization (WHO), and Yap Health Department scientists\ncontinue to investigate the Zika outbreak in Yap State. A total of 86\nconfirmed and probable cases have been recorded as of Tuesday [26 Jun\n2007].\nBecause this is a relatively unknown disease, they are now collecting\ndata to better define the course of illness and how it is\ntransmitted. Since there is no vaccination or specific medical\ntreatment for Zika virus infection, Guam Public Health advises the\npublic to avoid being bitten by mosquitoes that transmit the disease.\nGuam residents are especially urged to remove old tires, cans,\nbottles, coconut shells, and other items in which mosquitoes may\nbreed from around their homes.\nThe symptoms of the Zika virus are mild and generally last for 2-4\ndays, consisting of a rash that starts on the face that may spread to\nthe rest of the body, conjunctivitis (pink eye), and joint pain\nmostly affecting the smaller joints of the hands and feet.\n[Byline: Sabrina Salas Matanane]\n--\nCommunicated by:\nAlice E. Hadley, AHIP\nU.S. Naval Hospital, Guam\nMedical Library\n<alice.hadley@med.navy.mil>\n[ProMED-mail thanks Alice Hadley for sending in this report. The\ntravel of 2 individuals possibly infected with Zika virus is another\nillustration of the ease with which pathogens can be disseminated. If\nthese individuals were viremic on arrival in Guam, and competent\nvector mosquitoes were present and abundant, the risk of spread of\nZika virus could be relatively high. Transport of infected mosquitoes\nin commercial aircraft is another potential mechanism for\ndissemination of Zika and other arboviruses (see references below).\nReferences:\n1.

The probable cases are not laboratory confirmed, but do meet\nthe current case definition. According to the Guam Department of\nPublic Health, the 2 probable cases are from adults who had recently\ntraveled to Yap. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC), the\nWorld Health Organization (WHO), and Yap Health Department scientists\ncontinue to investigate the Zika outbreak in Yap State. A total of 86\nconfirmed and probable cases have been recorded as of Tuesday [26 Jun\n2007].\nBecause this is a relatively unknown disease, they are now collecting\ndata to better define the course of illness and how it is\ntransmitted. Since there is no vaccination or specific medical\ntreatment for Zika virus infection, Guam Public Health advises the\npublic to avoid being bitten by mosquitoes that transmit the disease.\nGuam residents are especially urged to remove old tires, cans,\nbottles, coconut shells, and other items in which mosquitoes may\nbreed from around their homes.\nThe symptoms of the Zika virus are mild and generally last for 2-4\ndays, consisting of a rash that starts on the face that may spread to\nthe rest of the body, conjunctivitis (pink eye), and joint pain\nmostly affecting the smaller joints of the hands and feet.\n[Byline: Sabrina Salas Matanane]\n--\nCommunicated by:\nAlice E. Hadley, AHIP\nU.S. Naval Hospital, Guam\nMedical Library\n<alice.hadley@med.navy.mil>\n[ProMED-mail thanks Alice Hadley for sending in this report. The\ntravel of 2 individuals possibly infected with Zika virus is another\nillustration of the ease with which pathogens can be disseminated. If\nthese individuals were viremic on arrival in Guam, and competent\nvector mosquitoes were present and abundant, the risk of spread of\nZika virus could be relatively high. Transport of infected mosquitoes\nin commercial aircraft is another potential mechanism for\ndissemination of Zika and other arboviruses (see references below).\nReferences:\n1.
