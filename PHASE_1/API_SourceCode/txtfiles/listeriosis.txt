The Austrian National Reference Laboratory for _Listeria_ (NRL) is responsible for whole genome sequence (WGS)-based typing of all isolates.\n\nOutbreak investigation\n----------------------\nIn late December 2018, the local health authority of Styria and the NRL confirmed an outbreak of febrile gastroenteritis, including one case of culture-confirmed _Listeria monocytogenes_ bacteremia, among 32 people at a tavern in mid-December [2018] as part of a celebration. They had consumed mixed platters with several meat products and p\u00e2t\u00e9s originating from an unnamed local production facility.\n\nAt the end of January this year [2019], the Austrian Ministry of Health imposed a mandate on the Austrian Agency of Health and Food Safety (AGES) to investigate the outbreak to identify the causative agent and likely source of infections, to detect and prevent further cases. The delay was due to closure of the tavern over the Christmas [2018] period.\n\nInformation from the local food authority on those involved restricted the incident to one local meat producer and three grocery shops. Items from this producer were offered at 6 locations, including the affected tavern and sold directly from the factory.\n\nOf 19 stool specimens from people with febrile gastroenteritis, 10 were positive for _L. monocytogenes_.\n\nA total of 73 food and environmental samples were analyzed for _Listeria monocytogenes_ with 2 food and one environmental sample positive. The food samples, smoked meat (Geselchtes) and liver p\u00e2t\u00e9 (Leberstreichwurst) were collected at the tavern. It was learned that they were produced by the same company. A gully water sample from January 2019 by Styrian health authorities at the production facility of this company also tested positive.\n\nActive case finding identified 2 more people with invasive listeriosis. They lived in the same 2 geographical districts as the tavern and production company. The 1st isolate was from a person in their early 80s who had not visited the tavern but developed symptoms in November 2018. This person, who died from the infection, had repeated consumption of liver p\u00e2t\u00e9 from the production company that was bought at a local market.\n\nThe 2nd isolate was from a case in their mid-50s with endophthalmitis, with onset of clinical symptoms in December 2018 but this person had not visited the tavern. They had regular consumption of liver p\u00e2t\u00e9 so it is possible this may have been produced at the implicated company.\n\nIn total, 7 females and 6 males aged 4 to 84 years old living within 24 km [15 mi] of Styria, were confirmed as outbreak cases.\n\nAfter the outbreak was confirmed in December [2018], cleaning of the tavern and at the production company was done by sanitation firms, under supervision of the local health authority. Only heat-treated products could be sold until _L. monocytogenes_ was not detected after repeated sampling. No more illnesses were found by the end of December [2018] and the outbreak was declared over.\n\nUse of epidemiological data and WGS-based typing confirmed the local outbreak due to a _Listeria monocytogenes_ IVb-CC4-ST4-CT7652 strain, not previously detected in Austria or anywhere else.\n\nA tavern offers a limited selection of traditional food, especially local meat products and cheese, in a buffet-like manner but has a functioning kitchen including fridge and freezer.\n\nThe researchers said it was possible that the time between food preparation and service might have been long, increasing the possibility for _Listeria_ to multiply. Traditional Austrian meat products such as liver p\u00e2t\u00e9 and jellied pork do not need heating prior to consumption and have been identified as potential risky food due to growth potential for _Listeria_.\n\n[Reference\n----------\n1.

This person, who died from the infection, had repeated consumption of liver p\u00e2t\u00e9 from the production company that was bought at a local market.\n\nThe 2nd isolate was from a case in their mid-50s with endophthalmitis, with onset of clinical symptoms in December 2018 but this person had not visited the tavern. They had regular consumption of liver p\u00e2t\u00e9 so it is possible this may have been produced at the implicated company.\n\nIn total, 7 females and 6 males aged 4 to 84 years old living within 24 km [15 mi] of Styria, were confirmed as outbreak cases.\n\nAfter the outbreak was confirmed in December [2018], cleaning of the tavern and at the production company was done by sanitation firms, under supervision of the local health authority. Only heat-treated products could be sold until _L. monocytogenes_ was not detected after repeated sampling. No more illnesses were found by the end of December [2018] and the outbreak was declared over.\n\nUse of epidemiological data and WGS-based typing confirmed the local outbreak due to a _Listeria monocytogenes_ IVb-CC4-ST4-CT7652 strain, not previously detected in Austria or anywhere else.\n\nA tavern offers a limited selection of traditional food, especially local meat products and cheese, in a buffet-like manner but has a functioning kitchen including fridge and freezer.\n\nThe researchers said it was possible that the time between food preparation and service might have been long, increasing the possibility for _Listeria_ to multiply. Traditional Austrian meat products such as liver p\u00e2t\u00e9 and jellied pork do not need heating prior to consumption and have been identified as potential risky food due to growth potential for _Listeria_.\n\n[Reference\n----------\n1.

The Austrian National Reference Laboratory for _Listeria_ (NRL) is responsible for whole genome sequence (WGS)-based typing of all isolates.\n\nOutbreak investigation\n----------------------\nIn late December 2018, the local health authority of Styria and the NRL confirmed an outbreak of febrile gastroenteritis, including one case of culture-confirmed _Listeria monocytogenes_ bacteremia, among 32 people at a tavern in mid-December [2018] as part of a celebration. They had consumed mixed platters with several meat products and p\u00e2t\u00e9s originating from an unnamed local production facility.\n\nAt the end of January this year [2019], the Austrian Ministry of Health imposed a mandate on the Austrian Agency of Health and Food Safety (AGES) to investigate the outbreak to identify the causative agent and likely source of infections, to detect and prevent further cases. The delay was due to closure of the tavern over the Christmas [2018] period.\n\nInformation from the local food authority on those involved restricted the incident to one local meat producer and three grocery shops. Items from this producer were offered at 6 locations, including the affected tavern and sold directly from the factory.\n\nOf 19 stool specimens from people with febrile gastroenteritis, 10 were positive for _L. monocytogenes_.\n\nA total of 73 food and environmental samples were analyzed for _Listeria monocytogenes_ with 2 food and one environmental sample positive. The food samples, smoked meat (Geselchtes) and liver p\u00e2t\u00e9 (Leberstreichwurst) were collected at the tavern. It was learned that they were produced by the same company. A gully water sample from January 2019 by Styrian health authorities at the production facility of this company also tested positive.\n\nActive case finding identified 2 more people with invasive listeriosis. They lived in the same 2 geographical districts as the tavern and production company. The 1st isolate was from a person in their early 80s who had not visited the tavern but developed symptoms in November 2018.

The Austrian National Reference Laboratory for _Listeria_ (NRL) is responsible for whole genome sequence (WGS)-based typing of all isolates.\n\nOutbreak investigation\n----------------------\nIn late December 2018, the local health authority of Styria and the NRL confirmed an outbreak of febrile gastroenteritis, including one case of culture-confirmed _Listeria monocytogenes_ bacteremia, among 32 people at a tavern in mid-December [2018] as part of a celebration. They had consumed mixed platters with several meat products and p\u00e2t\u00e9s originating from an unnamed local production facility.\n\nAt the end of January this year [2019], the Austrian Ministry of Health imposed a mandate on the Austrian Agency of Health and Food Safety (AGES) to investigate the outbreak to identify the causative agent and likely source of infections, to detect and prevent further cases. The delay was due to closure of the tavern over the Christmas [2018] period.\n\nInformation from the local food authority on those involved restricted the incident to one local meat producer and three grocery shops. Items from this producer were offered at 6 locations, including the affected tavern and sold directly from the factory.\n\nOf 19 stool specimens from people with febrile gastroenteritis, 10 were positive for _L. monocytogenes_.\n\nA total of 73 food and environmental samples were analyzed for _Listeria monocytogenes_ with 2 food and one environmental sample positive. The food samples, smoked meat (Geselchtes) and liver p\u00e2t\u00e9 (Leberstreichwurst) were collected at the tavern. It was learned that they were produced by the same company. A gully water sample from January 2019 by Styrian health authorities at the production facility of this company also tested positive.\n\nActive case finding identified 2 more people with invasive listeriosis. They lived in the same 2 geographical districts as the tavern and production company. The 1st isolate was from a person in their early 80s who had not visited the tavern but developed symptoms in November 2018. This person, who died from the infection, had repeated consumption of liver p\u00e2t\u00e9 from the production company that was bought at a local market.\n\nThe 2nd isolate was from a case in their mid-50s with endophthalmitis, with onset of clinical symptoms in December 2018 but this person had not visited the tavern. They had regular consumption of liver p\u00e2t\u00e9 so it is possible this may have been produced at the implicated company.\n\nIn total, 7 females and 6 males aged 4 to 84 years old living within 24 km [15 mi] of Styria, were confirmed as outbreak cases.\n\nAfter the outbreak was confirmed in December [2018], cleaning of the tavern and at the production company was done by sanitation firms, under supervision of the local health authority. Only heat-treated products could be sold until _L. monocytogenes_ was not detected after repeated sampling. No more illnesses were found by the end of December [2018] and the outbreak was declared over.\n\nUse of epidemiological data and WGS-based typing confirmed the local outbreak due to a _Listeria monocytogenes_ IVb-CC4-ST4-CT7652 strain, not previously detected in Austria or anywhere else.\n\nA tavern offers a limited selection of traditional food, especially local meat products and cheese, in a buffet-like manner but has a functioning kitchen including fridge and freezer.\n\nThe researchers said it was possible that the time between food preparation and service might have been long, increasing the possibility for _Listeria_ to multiply. Traditional Austrian meat products such as liver p\u00e2t\u00e9 and jellied pork do not need heating prior to consumption and have been identified as potential risky food due to growth potential for _Listeria_.\n\n[Reference\n----------\n1.

The Austrian National Reference Laboratory for _Listeria_ (NRL) is responsible for whole genome sequence (WGS)-based typing of all isolates.\n\nOutbreak investigation\n----------------------\nIn late December 2018, the local health authority of Styria and the NRL confirmed an outbreak of febrile gastroenteritis, including one case of culture-confirmed _Listeria monocytogenes_ bacteremia, among 32 people at a tavern in mid-December [2018] as part of a celebration. They had consumed mixed platters with several meat products and p\u00e2t\u00e9s originating from an unnamed local production facility.\n\nAt the end of January this year [2019], the Austrian Ministry of Health imposed a mandate on the Austrian Agency of Health and Food Safety (AGES) to investigate the outbreak to identify the causative agent and likely source of infections, to detect and prevent further cases. The delay was due to closure of the tavern over the Christmas [2018] period.\n\nInformation from the local food authority on those involved restricted the incident to one local meat producer and three grocery shops. Items from this producer were offered at 6 locations, including the affected tavern and sold directly from the factory.\n\nOf 19 stool specimens from people with febrile gastroenteritis, 10 were positive for _L. monocytogenes_.\n\nA total of 73 food and environmental samples were analyzed for _Listeria monocytogenes_ with 2 food and one environmental sample positive. The food samples, smoked meat (Geselchtes) and liver p\u00e2t\u00e9 (Leberstreichwurst) were collected at the tavern. It was learned that they were produced by the same company. A gully water sample from January 2019 by Styrian health authorities at the production facility of this company also tested positive.\n\nActive case finding identified 2 more people with invasive listeriosis. They lived in the same 2 geographical districts as the tavern and production company. The 1st isolate was from a person in their early 80s who had not visited the tavern but developed symptoms in November 2018. This person, who died from the infection, had repeated consumption of liver p\u00e2t\u00e9 from the production company that was bought at a local market.\n\nThe 2nd isolate was from a case in their mid-50s with endophthalmitis, with onset of clinical symptoms in December 2018 but this person had not visited the tavern. They had regular consumption of liver p\u00e2t\u00e9 so it is possible this may have been produced at the implicated company.\n\nIn total, 7 females and 6 males aged 4 to 84 years old living within 24 km [15 mi] of Styria, were confirmed as outbreak cases.\n\nAfter the outbreak was confirmed in December [2018], cleaning of the tavern and at the production company was done by sanitation firms, under supervision of the local health authority. Only heat-treated products could be sold until _L. monocytogenes_ was not detected after repeated sampling. No more illnesses were found by the end of December [2018] and the outbreak was declared over.\n\nUse of epidemiological data and WGS-based typing confirmed the local outbreak due to a _Listeria monocytogenes_ IVb-CC4-ST4-CT7652 strain, not previously detected in Austria or anywhere else.\n\nA tavern offers a limited selection of traditional food, especially local meat products and cheese, in a buffet-like manner but has a functioning kitchen including fridge and freezer.\n\nThe researchers said it was possible that the time between food preparation and service might have been long, increasing the possibility for _Listeria_ to multiply. Traditional Austrian meat products such as liver p\u00e2t\u00e9 and jellied pork do not need heating prior to consumption and have been identified as potential risky food due to growth potential for _Listeria_.\n\n[Reference\n----------\n1.

After the celebration, 11 individuals developed gastro-intestinal symptoms, including one case with severe sepsis. Cases had consumed mixed platters with several meat products and p\u00e2t\u00e9s originating from a local production facility (company X). Human, food and environmental samples taken from the tavern and company X were tested for _L. monocytogenes_. Whole genome sequence-based typing detected a novel _L. monocytogenes_ strain of serotype IVb, sequence type 4 and CT7652 in 15 samples; 12 human, 2 food and one environmental sample from company X with an allelic difference of 0 to 1. Active case finding identified 2 further cases who had not visited the tavern but tested positive for the outbreak strain. In total, 13 cases (7 females and 6 males; age range: 4-84 years) were identified. Liver p\u00e2t\u00e9 produced by company X was identified as the likely source of the outbreak.

The organism can be also found in agricultural land fertilized with sewage, and in silage, raw vegetables, raw meat and poultry, raw milk, soft cheeses, and kitchen premises, as well as in birds, crustaceans, fish, shellfish, ticks, and insects.\n\nRefrigerated smoked salmon is a recognized potential source for listeriosis, similar to other cold cut meats and non-heat treated cured smoked meats, being a ready-to-eat product that does not require further cooking before eating.\n\nEven if initial contamination adds only a few _Listeria _ organisms to the food, the contamination can be significant for refrigerated foods, because _Listeria_ can subsequently multiply at refrigerator temperatures to sufficient numbers to cause disease.\n\nGenotyping the clinical isolates from the 3 affected individuals, if they match, will establish whether we are dealing with a common-source outbreak, and genotyping isolates from smoked salmon eaten by the affected individuals would establish transmission pathways, if the genotypes from the smoked salmon and the clinical isolates match. - Mod.ML\n\nHealthMap/ProMED map available at:\nAustralia: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/186]\nSee Also\nListeriosis - Australia: (VI) fatal, nosocomial 20190223.6332766\n2018\n----\nListeriosis - Europe (06): WGS, smoked/marinated salmon from Poland, 2015-18 20181031.6122165\n2017\n----\nListeriosis - Denmark, Poland: smoked salmon, recall 20170902.5290728\n.................................................sb/ml/msp/ml", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "listeriosis"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2019-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-17 00:00:00", "2018-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-06 00:00:00", "2017-03-16 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Tasmania", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Queensland", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Victoria", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Australia", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "South Africa", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Poland", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "6652320", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Listeriosis - Europe (09): (Spain) meat, fatal, miscarriages, susp. tourist", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=6652320", "date": "2019-07-24 19:13:18", "main_text": "LISTERIOSIS - AUSTRALIA (02): FATAL, SMOKED SALMON SUSPECTED\n************************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Wed 24 Jul 2019\nSource: BBC News [edited]\nhttps://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-49094165\n\n\nTwo people have died from _Listeria_ infections in Australia after probably eating contaminated smoked salmon, officials say.

Most people infected display no symptoms, but elderly and very young people are vulnerable.\n\nLast year [2018], a _Listeria_ outbreak traced to rockmelons killed 7 people across Australia. Other nations have also seen recent outbreaks. One in South Africa killed 180 people and was said to be the worst in history.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[_Listeria monocytogenes_ is widely distributed in the environment where it can form biofilms, which enables it to attach to solid surfaces and become extremely difficult to remove. It is found in the intestinal tract of many animals, including cattle, sheep, and humans, and is found in soil and water, especially in regions in close proximity to cattle farms, indicating that these animals may contribute to its dispersal in the environment through their fecal matter. The organism can be also found in agricultural land fertilized with sewage, and in silage, raw vegetables, raw meat and poultry, raw milk, soft cheeses, and kitchen premises, as well as in birds, crustaceans, fish, shellfish, ticks, and insects.\n\nRefrigerated smoked salmon is a recognized potential source for listeriosis, similar to other cold cut meats and non-heat treated cured smoked meats, being a ready-to-eat product that does not require further cooking before eating.\n\nEven if initial contamination adds only a few _Listeria _ organisms to the food, the contamination can be significant for refrigerated foods, because _Listeria_ can subsequently multiply at refrigerator temperatures to sufficient numbers to cause disease.\n\nGenotyping the clinical isolates from the 3 affected individuals, if they match, will establish whether we are dealing with a common-source outbreak, and genotyping isolates from smoked salmon eaten by the affected individuals would establish transmission pathways, if the genotypes from the smoked salmon and the clinical isolates match. - Mod.ML\n\nHealthMap/ProMED map available at:\nAustralia: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/186]\nSee Also\nListeriosis - Australia: (VI) fatal, nosocomial 20190223.6332766\n2018\n----\nListeriosis - Europe (06): WGS, smoked/marinated salmon from Poland, 2015-18 20181031.6122165\n2017\n----\nListeriosis - Denmark, Poland: smoked salmon, recall 20170902.5290728\n.................................................sb/ml/msp/ml", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "listeriosis"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2019-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-17 00:00:00", "2018-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-06 00:00:00", "2017-03-16 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Tasmania", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Queensland", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Victoria", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Australia", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "South Africa", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Poland", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "6510327", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Listeriosis - Europe (04): (UK) nosocomial, fatal, meat sandwiches", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=6510327", "date": "2019-02-04 12:50:01", "main_text": "LISTERIOSIS - USA: READY-TO-EAT PORK PATTIES, END OF OUTBREAK\n*************************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Thu 31 Jan 2019\nSource: Barfblog [edited]\nhttps://www.barfblog.com/2019/01/4-sickened-outbreak-of-listeria-linked-to-pork-products/\n\n\nThe US Centers for Disease Control reports that an outbreak of _Listeria monocytogenes_ infections linked to pork products produced by Long Phung Food Products appears to be over.\n\nOn [20 Nov 2018], 165368 C Corporation of Houston, Texas, doing business as Long Phung Food Products, recalled ready-to-eat pork products because they might have been contaminated with _Listeria_ bacteria.\n\nDo not eat, sell, or serve recalled products from Long Phung Food Products.

All freezing activity at the plant has been stopped.\n\nNew cases could still emerge due to the long incubation period of listeriosis (up to 70 days); the long shelf-life of frozen corn products; and the consumption of frozen corn bought before the recalls and eaten without being cooked properly.\n\nTo reduce the risk of infection, consumers should thoroughly cook non ready-to-eat frozen vegetables, even though these products are commonly consumed without cooking (such as in salads and smoothies).

As of 8 Jun 2018, there are now 47 reported cases, including 9 deaths.\n\nPossibly other frozen vegetables produced by the Hungarian facility are also being implicated and on 29 June 2018, the Hungarian Food Chain Safety Office ordered recall and banned further the marketing of all frozen vegetable and frozen mixed vegetable products produced by the affected facility between August 2016 and June 2018. All freezing activity at the plant has been stopped.\n\n_Listeria monocytogenes_ is widely distributed in the environment where it can form biofilms, which enables them to attach to solid surfaces and become extremely difficult to remove, especially in parts of equipment that are difficult to access. In a prior ProMED-mail report of a listeriosis outbreak in Canada, the design of a commercial meat slicer responsible for contamination of deli meat made its regular cleaning difficult and costly for the food processor (Listeriosis - South Africa (04): comment 20180126.5586393).

Perhaps a similar situation is responsible for this prolonged multicountry EU outbreak.\n\nSerotyping of _L. monocytogenes_ strains, based on variations in the somatic (O) and flagellar (H) antigens, has determined that only 3 (1/2a, 1/2b, and 4b) of the 12 serotypes of _L. monocytogenes_ cause 95 per cent of human cases; serotype 4b is most commonly associated with outbreaks (https://www.cdc.gov/listeria/pdf/listeriainitiativeoverview_508.pdf). The serotype of the strain of _L. monocytogenes_ responsible for this multi-country European outbreak is 4b, multi-locus sequence type 6 (ST6). Whole genome sequence (WGS) analysis of _L. monocytogenes_ isolates from 2 different samples of mixed frozen vegetables and an isolate from a surface where various vegetables could have been processed closely matched that of the clinical isolates (ProMED-mail post Listeriosis - EU: fatal, ST6, frozen corn, 2015-18, recall 20180325.5708506).\n\nHealthMap/ProMED-mail map of Europe: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/11767. - Mod.ML]\nSee Also\nListeriosis - Europe (03): Sweden (VG) fatal, mashed potatoes, recall, RFI 20180520.5807321\nListeriosis - Europe (02): background 20180325.5709796\nListeriosis - Europe: fatal, ST6, frozen corn, 2015-18, recall 20180325.5708506\n.................................................jh/ml/mj/jh", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "listeriosis"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2015-03-16 00:00:00", "2018-06-08 00:00:00", "2016-03-16 00:00:00", "2017-03-16 00:00:00", "2018-03-16 00:00:00", "2018-06-29 00:00:00", "2018-03-16 00:00:00", "2018-06-08 00:00:00", "2047-03-16 00:00:00", "2018-06-29 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Finland", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Hungary", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "FATAL", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Canada", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Austria", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Sweden", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Poland", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Denmark", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "the United Kingdom", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "6159661", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Listeriosis - USA (03): ready-to-eat pork patties, WGS, recall", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=6159661", "date": "2018-07-06 22:08:46", "main_text": "LISTERIOSIS - EUROPE (04): FATAL, SEQUENCE TYPE 6, FROZEN CORN, 2015-2018, RECALL\n*********************************************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Tue 3 Jul 2018\nSource: Food Poison Journal [edited]\nhttp://www.foodpoisonjournal.com/foodborne-illness-outbreaks/hungarian-frozen-vegetables-link-in-europe-listeria-outbreak/\n\n\nFrozen corn and possibly other frozen vegetables are the likely source of an outbreak of _Listeria monocytogenes_ that has been affecting Austria, Denmark, Finland, Sweden, and the United Kingdom since 2015.\n\nExperts used whole genome sequencing to identify the food source, which initially was thought to be limited to frozen corn.

Between 1 Jan 2017 through 14 Mar 2018, 978 laboratory-confirmed listeriosis cases have been reported to the National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) from all provinces. The majority of cases have come from 3 provinces: 581 (59 percent) from Gauteng, 118 (12 percent) from Western Cape and 70 (7 percent) from KwaZulu-Natal provinces, with the remaining cases coming from the other provinces in South Africa.\n\nThe outcome of illness is known for 674 patients, of whom 183 (27 percent) of them died; this case fatality rate is comparable to other recorded listeriosis outbreaks worldwide. Most of the cases are persons who have higher risks for a severe disease outcome, such as neonates, pregnant women, the elderly and immunocompromised persons. In this outbreak, 42 percent of the cases are neonates who were infected during pregnancy or delivery.\n\nWhole genome sequencing was performed on isolates from a large subset of patients. 91 percent of the strains belonged to _Listeria monocytogenes_ Sequence Type 6 (ST6). The same ST6 sequence type was identified in a widely consumed ready-to-eat processed meat product called \"Polony\" [Bologna sausage]. The same strain was also found in the processing environment of the manufacturer of the implicated product.\n\nOn 4 Mar 2018, the Ministry of Health, announced that this product was believed to be the source of the outbreak.\n\nThe food processing company and 3 of its retailers export to 15 countries (1) in the African region. All of these countries have issued recalls for the implicated products.\n\nEnvironmental samples from other food production companies in South Africa have also tested positive for _Listeria_, but with strains different from the outbreak strain. These companies have also issued food recalls. Some of their products have been exported to some of the countries mentioned above.\n\n9 percent of the reported cases in the present outbreak in South Africa were infected with different strains of _Listeria_ than the predominant ST6 outbreak strain. This may indicate that more than one outbreak is ongoing. Comprehensive investigations to identify the source of infection of these cases should be conducted.\n\nPublic health response\n----------------------\nThe country has activated a national multisectoral task force to coordinate investigation and response activities:\nThe Minister of Health, South Africa, held a press conference on 4 Mar 2018 to announce the source of the outbreak. Following the source identification, the national authorities have taken measures to limit further infections and associated mortality, including but not limited to the issuance of safety recall notices, compliance notices, and measures related to exportation of implicated products and risk communication with vulnerable groups.\n\nThe Southern African Development Community (SADC) Health Ministers held a meeting in Johannesburg on 15 Mar 2018, to share information and to enhance preparedness and response for listeriosis. Health Ministers were further reminded about their rights and obligations under the International Health Regulations (IHR) with regards to additional health measures for international travel and trade.\n\nListeriosis has been made a notifiable medical condition in South Africa since December 2017. National risk communication activities have been initiated since December 2017 around the \"WHO five keys to safer food messages.\"\n\nWHO risk assessment\n-------------------\nGlobally, this is the largest outbreak of listeriosis that has been detected. Due to the potentially long incubation period of listeriosis (1 to 3 weeks and up to 70 days) further cases are expected before the impact of the food recall is observed.\n\nFollowing the identification of the source of this outbreak, WHO is now concerned that the export of implicated products may have resulted in listeriosis cases in other countries. Detailed information on the implicated product batches exported to each of the identified 15 countries should be shared with WHO and the International Food Safety Authorities Network (INFOSAN) Secretariat. This will help to facilitate efficient recalls of these products.\n\nRecently, Namibia reported a confirmed case of listeriosis. It is important that this case and other possible cases be properly investigated and the implicated food sources identified. The isolated _Listeria_ strains should be sequenced to determine potential links to the outbreak in South Africa. Some of these countries may not have well-established surveillance systems and laboratory diagnostic services in place to detect cases of listeriosis. In such cases, WHO is ready to provide support and has reached out to 16 African nations (2 West African countries and 14 members of SADC) to provide support for preparedness and response.\n\nAn increase in public concern about the outbreak has been reflected in media reports and discussions in various social media platforms.\n\nWHO advice\n----------\nCountries should strengthen national food safety and disease surveillance systems as a prerequisite to prevent similar events in the future and to ensure a safe food supply for their populations. Additionally, countries are urged to pay closer attention to common foodborne pathogens such as _Salmonella_ species, _Campylobacter jejuni_, _Escherichia coli_, and _Listeria monocytogenes_, to make listeriosis a notifiable disease if not yet done, to make the best use of a new \"WHO manual to strengthen surveillance of and response to foodborne diseases,\" which was published in November 2017 and to refer to the \"WHO Factsheet on Listeriosis\". See below, in the \"Further Information\" section for links to these documents.\n\nResponsible authorities are encouraged to proactively provide public health advice on the prevention and control of listeriosis, including, strengthened risk communication, to address public concerns and promote outbreak control measures.\n\nWHO does not currently recommend any travel or trade restrictions in relation to this outbreak, other than the recall of processed meat products indicated by the South African Government.\n\nWhile WHO understands the desire by sovereign governments to take measures to protect the health of their populations, States Parties to the IHR have obligations not to take actions that significantly interfere with international travel and trade which are not based on scientific principles and which may be viewed as excessive.

Between 1 Jan 2017 through 14 Mar 2018, 978 laboratory-confirmed listeriosis cases have been reported to the National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) from all provinces. The majority of cases have come from 3 provinces: 581 (59 percent) from Gauteng, 118 (12 percent) from Western Cape and 70 (7 percent) from KwaZulu-Natal provinces, with the remaining cases coming from the other provinces in South Africa.\n\nThe outcome of illness is known for 674 patients, of whom 183 (27 percent) of them died; this case fatality rate is comparable to other recorded listeriosis outbreaks worldwide. Most of the cases are persons who have higher risks for a severe disease outcome, such as neonates, pregnant women, the elderly and immunocompromised persons. In this outbreak, 42 percent of the cases are neonates who were infected during pregnancy or delivery.\n\nWhole genome sequencing was performed on isolates from a large subset of patients. 91 percent of the strains belonged to _Listeria monocytogenes_ Sequence Type 6 (ST6). The same ST6 sequence type was identified in a widely consumed ready-to-eat processed meat product called \"Polony\" [Bologna sausage]. The same strain was also found in the processing environment of the manufacturer of the implicated product.\n\nOn 4 Mar 2018, the Ministry of Health, announced that this product was believed to be the source of the outbreak.\n\nThe food processing company and 3 of its retailers export to 15 countries (1) in the African region. All of these countries have issued recalls for the implicated products.\n\nEnvironmental samples from other food production companies in South Africa have also tested positive for _Listeria_, but with strains different from the outbreak strain. These companies have also issued food recalls. Some of their products have been exported to some of the countries mentioned above.\n\n9 percent of the reported cases in the present outbreak in South Africa were infected with different strains of _Listeria_ than the predominant ST6 outbreak strain. This may indicate that more than one outbreak is ongoing. Comprehensive investigations to identify the source of infection of these cases should be conducted.\n\nPublic health response\n----------------------\nThe country has activated a national multisectoral task force to coordinate investigation and response activities:\nThe Minister of Health, South Africa, held a press conference on 4 Mar 2018 to announce the source of the outbreak. Following the source identification, the national authorities have taken measures to limit further infections and associated mortality, including but not limited to the issuance of safety recall notices, compliance notices, and measures related to exportation of implicated products and risk communication with vulnerable groups.\n\nThe Southern African Development Community (SADC) Health Ministers held a meeting in Johannesburg on 15 Mar 2018, to share information and to enhance preparedness and response for listeriosis. Health Ministers were further reminded about their rights and obligations under the International Health Regulations (IHR) with regards to additional health measures for international travel and trade.\n\nListeriosis has been made a notifiable medical condition in South Africa since December 2017. National risk communication activities have been initiated since December 2017 around the \"WHO five keys to safer food messages.\"\n\nWHO risk assessment\n-------------------\nGlobally, this is the largest outbreak of listeriosis that has been detected. Due to the potentially long incubation period of listeriosis (1 to 3 weeks and up to 70 days) further cases are expected before the impact of the food recall is observed.\n\nFollowing the identification of the source of this outbreak, WHO is now concerned that the export of implicated products may have resulted in listeriosis cases in other countries. Detailed information on the implicated product batches exported to each of the identified 15 countries should be shared with WHO and the International Food Safety Authorities Network (INFOSAN) Secretariat. This will help to facilitate efficient recalls of these products.\n\nRecently, Namibia reported a confirmed case of listeriosis. It is important that this case and other possible cases be properly investigated and the implicated food sources identified. The isolated _Listeria_ strains should be sequenced to determine potential links to the outbreak in South Africa. Some of these countries may not have well-established surveillance systems and laboratory diagnostic services in place to detect cases of listeriosis. In such cases, WHO is ready to provide support and has reached out to 16 African nations (2 West African countries and 14 members of SADC) to provide support for preparedness and response.\n\nAn increase in public concern about the outbreak has been reflected in media reports and discussions in various social media platforms.\n\nWHO advice\n----------\nCountries should strengthen national food safety and disease surveillance systems as a prerequisite to prevent similar events in the future and to ensure a safe food supply for their populations. Additionally, countries are urged to pay closer attention to common foodborne pathogens such as _Salmonella_ species, _Campylobacter jejuni_, _Escherichia coli_, and _Listeria monocytogenes_, to make listeriosis a notifiable disease if not yet done, to make the best use of a new \"WHO manual to strengthen surveillance of and response to foodborne diseases,\" which was published in November 2017 and to refer to the \"WHO Factsheet on Listeriosis\". See below, in the \"Further Information\" section for links to these documents.\n\nResponsible authorities are encouraged to proactively provide public health advice on the prevention and control of listeriosis, including, strengthened risk communication, to address public concerns and promote outbreak control measures.\n\nWHO does not currently recommend any travel or trade restrictions in relation to this outbreak, other than the recall of processed meat products indicated by the South African Government.\n\nWhile WHO understands the desire by sovereign governments to take measures to protect the health of their populations, States Parties to the IHR have obligations not to take actions that significantly interfere with international travel and trade which are not based on scientific principles and which may be viewed as excessive. Indeed such measures contravene the spirit and purpose of the IHR, and can impede public health objectives.\n\nCurrently, 12 out of 15 countries have recalled the implicated processed meat products, and banned imports of the same, while 3 out of these countries have additionally banned imports of other food products. WHO continues to monitor the travel and trade measures taken by countries in relation to this outbreak and their compliance with requirements under the IHR.\n\nFor travellers, it is advisable to practice good food hygiene, such as avoiding uncooked food, avoiding food that has been kept at room temperature for several hours, and always washing hands thoroughly with soap and water before preparing or consuming food.\n\n1.

The same ST6 sequence type was identified in a widely consumed ready-to-eat processed meat product called \"Polony\" [Bologna sausage]. The same strain was also found in the processing environment of the manufacturer of the implicated product.\n\nOn 4 Mar 2018, the Ministry of Health, announced that this product was believed to be the source of the outbreak.\n\nThe food processing company and 3 of its retailers export to 15 countries (1) in the African region. All of these countries have issued recalls for the implicated products.\n\nEnvironmental samples from other food production companies in South Africa have also tested positive for _Listeria_, but with strains different from the outbreak strain. These companies have also issued food recalls. Some of their products have been exported to some of the countries mentioned above.\n\n9 percent of the reported cases in the present outbreak in South Africa were infected with different strains of _Listeria_ than the predominant ST6 outbreak strain. This may indicate that more than one outbreak is ongoing. Comprehensive investigations to identify the source of infection of these cases should be conducted.\n\nPublic health response\n----------------------\nThe country has activated a national multisectoral task force to coordinate investigation and response activities:\nThe Minister of Health, South Africa, held a press conference on 4 Mar 2018 to announce the source of the outbreak. Following the source identification, the national authorities have taken measures to limit further infections and associated mortality, including but not limited to the issuance of safety recall notices, compliance notices, and measures related to exportation of implicated products and risk communication with vulnerable groups.\n\nThe Southern African Development Community (SADC) Health Ministers held a meeting in Johannesburg on 15 Mar 2018, to share information and to enhance preparedness and response for listeriosis. Health Ministers were further reminded about their rights and obligations under the International Health Regulations (IHR) with regards to additional health measures for international travel and trade.\n\nListeriosis has been made a notifiable medical condition in South Africa since December 2017. National risk communication activities have been initiated since December 2017 around the \"WHO five keys to safer food messages.\"\n\nWHO risk assessment\n-------------------\nGlobally, this is the largest outbreak of listeriosis that has been detected. Due to the potentially long incubation period of listeriosis (1 to 3 weeks and up to 70 days) further cases are expected before the impact of the food recall is observed.\n\nFollowing the identification of the source of this outbreak, WHO is now concerned that the export of implicated products may have resulted in listeriosis cases in other countries. Detailed information on the implicated product batches exported to each of the identified 15 countries should be shared with WHO and the International Food Safety Authorities Network (INFOSAN) Secretariat. This will help to facilitate efficient recalls of these products.\n\nRecently, Namibia reported a confirmed case of listeriosis. It is important that this case and other possible cases be properly investigated and the implicated food sources identified. The isolated _Listeria_ strains should be sequenced to determine potential links to the outbreak in South Africa. Some of these countries may not have well-established surveillance systems and laboratory diagnostic services in place to detect cases of listeriosis. In such cases, WHO is ready to provide support and has reached out to 16 African nations (2 West African countries and 14 members of SADC) to provide support for preparedness and response.\n\nAn increase in public concern about the outbreak has been reflected in media reports and discussions in various social media platforms.\n\nWHO advice\n----------\nCountries should strengthen national food safety and disease surveillance systems as a prerequisite to prevent similar events in the future and to ensure a safe food supply for their populations. Additionally, countries are urged to pay closer attention to common foodborne pathogens such as _Salmonella_ species, _Campylobacter jejuni_, _Escherichia coli_, and _Listeria monocytogenes_, to make listeriosis a notifiable disease if not yet done, to make the best use of a new \"WHO manual to strengthen surveillance of and response to foodborne diseases,\" which was published in November 2017 and to refer to the \"WHO Factsheet on Listeriosis\". See below, in the \"Further Information\" section for links to these documents.\n\nResponsible authorities are encouraged to proactively provide public health advice on the prevention and control of listeriosis, including, strengthened risk communication, to address public concerns and promote outbreak control measures.\n\nWHO does not currently recommend any travel or trade restrictions in relation to this outbreak, other than the recall of processed meat products indicated by the South African Government.\n\nWhile WHO understands the desire by sovereign governments to take measures to protect the health of their populations, States Parties to the IHR have obligations not to take actions that significantly interfere with international travel and trade which are not based on scientific principles and which may be viewed as excessive. Indeed such measures contravene the spirit and purpose of the IHR, and can impede public health objectives.\n\nCurrently, 12 out of 15 countries have recalled the implicated processed meat products, and banned imports of the same, while 3 out of these countries have additionally banned imports of other food products. WHO continues to monitor the travel and trade measures taken by countries in relation to this outbreak and their compliance with requirements under the IHR.\n\nFor travellers, it is advisable to practice good food hygiene, such as avoiding uncooked food, avoiding food that has been kept at room temperature for several hours, and always washing hands thoroughly with soap and water before preparing or consuming food.\n\n1.

Between 1 Jan 2017 through 14 Mar 2018, 978 laboratory-confirmed listeriosis cases have been reported to the National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) from all provinces. The majority of cases have come from 3 provinces: 581 (59 percent) from Gauteng, 118 (12 percent) from Western Cape and 70 (7 percent) from KwaZulu-Natal provinces, with the remaining cases coming from the other provinces in South Africa.\n\nThe outcome of illness is known for 674 patients, of whom 183 (27 percent) of them died; this case fatality rate is comparable to other recorded listeriosis outbreaks worldwide. Most of the cases are persons who have higher risks for a severe disease outcome, such as neonates, pregnant women, the elderly and immunocompromised persons. In this outbreak, 42 percent of the cases are neonates who were infected during pregnancy or delivery.\n\nWhole genome sequencing was performed on isolates from a large subset of patients. 91 percent of the strains belonged to _Listeria monocytogenes_ Sequence Type 6 (ST6). The same ST6 sequence type was identified in a widely consumed ready-to-eat processed meat product called \"Polony\" [Bologna sausage]. The same strain was also found in the processing environment of the manufacturer of the implicated product.\n\nOn 4 Mar 2018, the Ministry of Health, announced that this product was believed to be the source of the outbreak.\n\nThe food processing company and 3 of its retailers export to 15 countries (1) in the African region. All of these countries have issued recalls for the implicated products.\n\nEnvironmental samples from other food production companies in South Africa have also tested positive for _Listeria_, but with strains different from the outbreak strain. These companies have also issued food recalls. Some of their products have been exported to some of the countries mentioned above.\n\n9 percent of the reported cases in the present outbreak in South Africa were infected with different strains of _Listeria_ than the predominant ST6 outbreak strain. This may indicate that more than one outbreak is ongoing. Comprehensive investigations to identify the source of infection of these cases should be conducted.\n\nPublic health response\n----------------------\nThe country has activated a national multisectoral task force to coordinate investigation and response activities:\nThe Minister of Health, South Africa, held a press conference on 4 Mar 2018 to announce the source of the outbreak. Following the source identification, the national authorities have taken measures to limit further infections and associated mortality, including but not limited to the issuance of safety recall notices, compliance notices, and measures related to exportation of implicated products and risk communication with vulnerable groups.\n\nThe Southern African Development Community (SADC) Health Ministers held a meeting in Johannesburg on 15 Mar 2018, to share information and to enhance preparedness and response for listeriosis. Health Ministers were further reminded about their rights and obligations under the International Health Regulations (IHR) with regards to additional health measures for international travel and trade.\n\nListeriosis has been made a notifiable medical condition in South Africa since December 2017. National risk communication activities have been initiated since December 2017 around the \"WHO five keys to safer food messages.\"\n\nWHO risk assessment\n-------------------\nGlobally, this is the largest outbreak of listeriosis that has been detected. Due to the potentially long incubation period of listeriosis (1 to 3 weeks and up to 70 days) further cases are expected before the impact of the food recall is observed.\n\nFollowing the identification of the source of this outbreak, WHO is now concerned that the export of implicated products may have resulted in listeriosis cases in other countries. Detailed information on the implicated product batches exported to each of the identified 15 countries should be shared with WHO and the International Food Safety Authorities Network (INFOSAN) Secretariat. This will help to facilitate efficient recalls of these products.\n\nRecently, Namibia reported a confirmed case of listeriosis. It is important that this case and other possible cases be properly investigated and the implicated food sources identified. The isolated _Listeria_ strains should be sequenced to determine potential links to the outbreak in South Africa. Some of these countries may not have well-established surveillance systems and laboratory diagnostic services in place to detect cases of listeriosis. In such cases, WHO is ready to provide support and has reached out to 16 African nations (2 West African countries and 14 members of SADC) to provide support for preparedness and response.\n\nAn increase in public concern about the outbreak has been reflected in media reports and discussions in various social media platforms.\n\nWHO advice\n----------\nCountries should strengthen national food safety and disease surveillance systems as a prerequisite to prevent similar events in the future and to ensure a safe food supply for their populations. Additionally, countries are urged to pay closer attention to common foodborne pathogens such as _Salmonella_ species, _Campylobacter jejuni_, _Escherichia coli_, and _Listeria monocytogenes_, to make listeriosis a notifiable disease if not yet done, to make the best use of a new \"WHO manual to strengthen surveillance of and response to foodborne diseases,\" which was published in November 2017 and to refer to the \"WHO Factsheet on Listeriosis\". See below, in the \"Further Information\" section for links to these documents.\n\nResponsible authorities are encouraged to proactively provide public health advice on the prevention and control of listeriosis, including, strengthened risk communication, to address public concerns and promote outbreak control measures.\n\nWHO does not currently recommend any travel or trade restrictions in relation to this outbreak, other than the recall of processed meat products indicated by the South African Government.\n\nWhile WHO understands the desire by sovereign governments to take measures to protect the health of their populations, States Parties to the IHR have obligations not to take actions that significantly interfere with international travel and trade which are not based on scientific principles and which may be viewed as excessive. Indeed such measures contravene the spirit and purpose of the IHR, and can impede public health objectives.\n\nCurrently, 12 out of 15 countries have recalled the implicated processed meat products, and banned imports of the same, while 3 out of these countries have additionally banned imports of other food products. WHO continues to monitor the travel and trade measures taken by countries in relation to this outbreak and their compliance with requirements under the IHR.\n\nFor travellers, it is advisable to practice good food hygiene, such as avoiding uncooked food, avoiding food that has been kept at room temperature for several hours, and always washing hands thoroughly with soap and water before preparing or consuming food.\n\n1.

The environmental health practitioners (EHPs) were informed and on the same day visited the cr\u00e8che, and obtained samples from 2 unrelated polony brands (manufactured by Enterprise and Rainbow Chicken Limited (RCL) respectively) and submitted these to the laboratory for testing.\n\n\"_Listeria monocytogenes_ was isolated from stool collected from one of the ill children, and from both of the polony specimens collected from the cr\u00e8che. These isolates were sent to the NICD Centre for Enteric Diseases, and underwent whole genome sequencing and genomic analysis. The ST6 sequence type was confirmed on all 3 isolates on [Sat 27 Jan 2018]. Remember that in the last press conference I informed you that from clinical isolates obtained from patients (patient blood), 9 sequence types of _L. monocytogenes_ were isolated and 91 percent were of sequence type 6 (ST6). We had then concluded that time that this outbreak is driven by ST6.\n\n\"I wish to further remind you that we had then taken a decision to visit all food-processing sites, food-packaging sites, as well as food production sites where possible.\n\n\"Following the lead from the tests performed on these children from Soweto and the food they had ingested, the EHPs, together with the NICD and DAFF representatives, accompanied by 3 technical advisors from the World Health Organisation in Geneva, visited a food-production site in Polokwane and conducted an extensive food product and environmental sampling.\n\n_L. monocytogenes_ was isolated from over 30 percent of the environmental samples collected from this site, which happens to be the Enterprise factory in Polokwane.\n\nTo conclude the investigation, whole genome sequencing analysis was performed from this Enterprise factory and the results became available midnight or last night [3 Mar 2018]. The outbreak strain, ST6, was confirmed in at least 16 environmental samples collected from this Enterprise facility.\n\n\"The conclusion from this is that the source of the present outbreak can be confirmed to be the Enterprise food-production facility in Polokwane.\n\n\"Additionally, preliminary results show that several ready-to-eat processed meat products from the Enterprise facility located in Germiston contain _L. monocytogenes_, but the sequence type is not known as yet.\n\n\"Investigation of the RCL Wolwehoek production facility is also underway. Polony products have tested positive for _L. monocytogenes_, but the sequence types of the isolates are NOT ST6. However, such contamination of ready-to-eat processed meat products constitutes a health risk. Also, over 10 percent of environmental samples collected by EHPs at this facility have tested positive for _L. monocytogenes_. The sequence types of these isolates are not known as yet.\n\n\"With the information at our disposal, we have decided on the following course of action:\n\"1. The National Consumer Commission (NCC) has in terms of Section 60(2) of the Consumer Protection Act this morning [4 Mar 2018] issued the manufacturers concerned with safety recall notices.\n\n\"Section 60(2) of the Consumer Protection Act states that:\nIf the NCC has reasonable grounds to believe that any goods may be unsafe, or that there is a potential risk to the public from the continued use of or exposure to the goods, and the producer or importer of those goods has not taken any steps required by an applicable code contemplated in subsection the Commission, by written notice, may require that producer to:\n(a) conduct an investigation contemplated in subsection (1); or\n(b) carry out a recall programme on any terms required by the Commission.\n\n\"The NCC will prepare a recall strategy in conjunction with the manufacturers and make further announcements to the public in due course.\nThe safety recall will affect the manufacturers' entire distribution networks, both domestic and international.\n\n\"2. Compliance notices will be issued to facilities in terms of the National Health Act.\nEnvironmental Health Practitioners appointed in terms of section 80(1) of the Act and duly registered as such in terms of section 83(5) of the National Health Amendment Act, 2013 (Act No. 12 of 2013) should upon finding that there are in terms of section 83 (1) and (2), existing conditions which:\n(a) constitutes a violation of the right contained in section 24(a) of the Constitution;\n(b) constitutes pollution detrimental to health;\n(c) is likely to cause a health nuisance; or\n(d) constitutes a health nuisance,\n\n\"3. In terms of registration for exports by the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (DAFF), the respective processing or manufacturing establishments namely RCL Foods with an export registration number ZA32 and Enterprise Foods with an export registration number ZA 33 have been temporarily suspected [suspended?] till further notice.\n\n\"4. We advise members of the public to avoid all processed meat products that are sold as ready-to-eat. While we know that polony is definitely implicated, there is a risk of cross-contamination of other ready-to-eat processed meat products, either at production, distribution or retail. This is because _Listeria_ on the exterior casing (packaging) of polony can be transferred to other products it comes into contact with, including viennas, russians, frankfurters, other sausages, and other 'cold meat' products that are typically not cooked before eating.\n\n\"Just a reminder that people at high risk for listeriosis include:\n- pregnant women;\n- neonates (1st 28 days of life);\n- very young infants;\n- elderly persons, older than 65 years of age, and\n- anyone with a weakened immune system (due to HIV infection, cancer, diabetes, kidney disease, liver disease, people with transplants and those on immunosuppressive therapy such as oral corticosteroids, chemotherapy, or anti-TNF therapy for auto-immune disease).\n\n\"The recall of these products does not mean that members of the public must now relax and stop the 5 food-safety rules, which we have recited many times, that is, washing your hands before handling food or when coming back from the bathroom; making sure that food is well cooked; isolating raw food from cooked food; making sure that food is at an appropriate temperature; and washing non-cooked food with clean running water; as well as using only pasteurised or boiled milk products.\n\n\"It means that the general status of hygiene of the population must still be a matter of priority to society as a whole, and must remain like that forever.\"\n\n\"For media enquiries, please contact:\nMr Popo Maja\nHead of Communications\nNational Department of Health\nCell: 0725853219/012 395 9591\nFoster Mohale\nDirector: Media Relations\nNational Department of Health\nCell: 0724323792/012 395 8180\n<Foster.mohale@health.gov.za>\"\n\n--\nCharlene Jacobs\n<charlenea.jacobs@westerncape.gov.za>\n\n[ProMED-mail thanks Charlene Jacobs for the official press conference media statement from Dr Aaron Motsoaledi, South Africa Minister of Health on the listeriosis outbreak in South Africa. - Mod.ML\n\nHealthMap: South Africa: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/179]\nSee Also\nListeriosis - South Africa (08): fatal, more cases, source found, polony 20180305.5665592\nListeriosis - South Africa (07): fatal, more cases 20180224.5648305\nListeriosis - South Africa (06): fatal, more cases 20180218.5635764\nListeriosis - South Africa (05): fatal, more cases 20180131.5596282\nListeriosis - South Africa (04): comment 20180126.5586393\nListeriosis - South Africa (03): fatal, increasing incidence, ST6 20180122.5577247\nListeriosis - South Africa (02): fatal, increasing incidence, ST6 20180117.5566300\nListeriosis - South Africa: fatal, increasing incidence, ST6 20180108.5545556\n2017\n----\nListeriosis - South Africa (04): fatal, increasing incidence 20171217.5508986\nListeriosis - South Africa (03): fatal, increasing incidence, genotyping 20171206.5487695\nListeriosis - South Africa (02): fatal, increasing incidence, RFI 20171205.5484927\nListeriosis - South Africa: increasing incidence 20171025.5402225\n.................................................lm/ml/mj/lxl", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "listeriosis"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2021-03-09 00:00:00", "2017-01-16 00:00:00", "2018-03-16 00:00:00", "2018-03-16 00:00:00", "2013-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-08 00:00:00", "2021-03-07 00:00:00", "2021-03-06 00:00:00", "2021-03-05 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2017-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Soweto", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "South Africa", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Geneva", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Polokwane", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "5708506", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Listeriosis - Europe: fatal, ST6, frozen corn, 2015-18, recall", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=5708506", "date": "2018-03-05 12:14:13", "main_text": "LISTERIOSIS - SOUTH AFRICA (09): FATAL, HEALTH DEPARTMENT PRESS RELEASE\n***********************************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Sun 4 Mar 2018\nFrom: Charlene Jacobs <charlenea.jacobs@westerncape.gov.za> [edited]\n\n\nPress conference media statement from the Minister of Health Dr Aaron Motsoaledi, Department of Health, Republic of South Africa, regarding the update on the listeriosis outbreak in South Africa\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\"The situation now is as follows:\n\n\"As of [2 mar 2018], the total of laboratory-confirmed cases has risen to 948, still counting from January 2017.

Of these 948, a total 659 patients have been traced and 180 of them have unfortunately died. This constitutes a 27 percent case fatality rate.\n\nIn our constant search for the source of the outbreak and the treatment of people who are affected, a team from the NICD [National Institute for Communicable Diseases] has interviewed 109 ill people to obtain details about foods they had eaten in the month before falling ill. 93 (85 percent) people reported eating ready-to-eat (RTE) processed meat products, of which polony was the most common, followed by viennas/sausages and then other 'cold meats'.\n\n\"On [Fri 12 Jan 2018], 9 children under the age of 5 years presented to Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital with febrile gastroenteritis. The paediatrician suspected foodborne disease, including listeriosis, as a possible cause. The environmental health practitioners (EHPs) were informed and on the same day visited the cr\u00e8che, and obtained samples from 2 unrelated polony brands (manufactured by Enterprise and Rainbow Chicken Limited (RCL) respectively) and submitted these to the laboratory for testing.\n\n\"_Listeria monocytogenes_ was isolated from stool collected from one of the ill children, and from both of the polony specimens collected from the cr\u00e8che. These isolates were sent to the NICD Centre for Enteric Diseases, and underwent whole genome sequencing and genomic analysis. The ST6 sequence type was confirmed on all 3 isolates on [Sat 27 Jan 2018]. Remember that in the last press conference I informed you that from clinical isolates obtained from patients (patient blood), 9 sequence types of _L. monocytogenes_ were isolated and 91 percent were of sequence type 6 (ST6). We had then concluded that time that this outbreak is driven by ST6.\n\n\"I wish to further remind you that we had then taken a decision to visit all food-processing sites, food-packaging sites, as well as food production sites where possible.\n\n\"Following the lead from the tests performed on these children from Soweto and the food they had ingested, the EHPs, together with the NICD and DAFF representatives, accompanied by 3 technical advisors from the World Health Organisation in Geneva, visited a food-production site in Polokwane and conducted an extensive food product and environmental sampling.\n\n_L. monocytogenes_ was isolated from over 30 percent of the environmental samples collected from this site, which happens to be the Enterprise factory in Polokwane.\n\nTo conclude the investigation, whole genome sequencing analysis was performed from this Enterprise factory and the results became available midnight or last night [3 Mar 2018]. The outbreak strain, ST6, was confirmed in at least 16 environmental samples collected from this Enterprise facility.\n\n\"The conclusion from this is that the source of the present outbreak can be confirmed to be the Enterprise food-production facility in Polokwane.\n\n\"Additionally, preliminary results show that several ready-to-eat processed meat products from the Enterprise facility located in Germiston contain _L. monocytogenes_, but the sequence type is not known as yet.\n\n\"Investigation of the RCL Wolwehoek production facility is also underway. Polony products have tested positive for _L. monocytogenes_, but the sequence types of the isolates are NOT ST6. However, such contamination of ready-to-eat processed meat products constitutes a health risk. Also, over 10 percent of environmental samples collected by EHPs at this facility have tested positive for _L. monocytogenes_. The sequence types of these isolates are not known as yet.\n\n\"With the information at our disposal, we have decided on the following course of action:\n\"1. The National Consumer Commission (NCC) has in terms of Section 60(2) of the Consumer Protection Act this morning [4 Mar 2018] issued the manufacturers concerned with safety recall notices.\n\n\"Section 60(2) of the Consumer Protection Act states that:\nIf the NCC has reasonable grounds to believe that any goods may be unsafe, or that there is a potential risk to the public from the continued use of or exposure to the goods, and the producer or importer of those goods has not taken any steps required by an applicable code contemplated in subsection the Commission, by written notice, may require that producer to:\n(a) conduct an investigation contemplated in subsection (1); or\n(b) carry out a recall programme on any terms required by the Commission.\n\n\"The NCC will prepare a recall strategy in conjunction with the manufacturers and make further announcements to the public in due course.\nThe safety recall will affect the manufacturers' entire distribution networks, both domestic and international.\n\n\"2. Compliance notices will be issued to facilities in terms of the National Health Act.\nEnvironmental Health Practitioners appointed in terms of section 80(1) of the Act and duly registered as such in terms of section 83(5) of the National Health Amendment Act, 2013 (Act No. 12 of 2013) should upon finding that there are in terms of section 83 (1) and (2), existing conditions which:\n(a) constitutes a violation of the right contained in section 24(a) of the Constitution;\n(b) constitutes pollution detrimental to health;\n(c) is likely to cause a health nuisance; or\n(d) constitutes a health nuisance,\n\n\"3. In terms of registration for exports by the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (DAFF), the respective processing or manufacturing establishments namely RCL Foods with an export registration number ZA32 and Enterprise Foods with an export registration number ZA 33 have been temporarily suspected [suspended?] till further notice.\n\n\"4.

We had then concluded that time that this outbreak is driven by ST6.\n\n\"I wish to further remind you that we had then taken a decision to visit all food-processing sites, food-packaging sites, as well as food production sites where possible.\n\n\"Following the lead from the tests performed on these children from Soweto and the food they had ingested, the EHPs, together with the NICD and DAFF representatives, accompanied by 3 technical advisors from the World Health Organisation in Geneva, visited a food-production site in Polokwane and conducted an extensive food product and environmental sampling.\n\n_L. monocytogenes_ was isolated from over 30 percent of the environmental samples collected from this site, which happens to be the Enterprise factory in Polokwane.\n\nTo conclude the investigation, whole genome sequencing analysis was performed from this Enterprise factory and the results became available midnight or last night [3 Mar 2018]. The outbreak strain, ST6, was confirmed in at least 16 environmental samples collected from this Enterprise facility.\n\n\"The conclusion from this is that the source of the present outbreak can be confirmed to be the Enterprise food-production facility in Polokwane.\n\n\"Additionally, preliminary results show that several ready-to-eat processed meat products from the Enterprise facility located in Germiston contain _L. monocytogenes_, but the sequence type is not known as yet.\n\n\"Investigation of the RCL Wolwehoek production facility is also underway. Polony products have tested positive for _L. monocytogenes_, but the sequence types of the isolates are NOT ST6. However, such contamination of ready-to-eat processed meat products constitutes a health risk. Also, over 10 percent of environmental samples collected by EHPs at this facility have tested positive for _L. monocytogenes_. The sequence types of these isolates are not known as yet.\n\n\"With the information at our disposal, we have decided on the following course of action:\n\"1. The National Consumer Commission (NCC) has in terms of Section 60(2) of the Consumer Protection Act this morning [4 Mar 2018] issued the manufacturers concerned with safety recall notices.\n\n\"Section 60(2) of the Consumer Protection Act states that:\nIf the NCC has reasonable grounds to believe that any goods may be unsafe, or that there is a potential risk to the public from the continued use of or exposure to the goods, and the producer or importer of those goods has not taken any steps required by an applicable code contemplated in subsection the Commission, by written notice, may require that producer to:\n(a) conduct an investigation contemplated in subsection (1); or\n(b) carry out a recall programme on any terms required by the Commission.\n\n\"The NCC will prepare a recall strategy in conjunction with the manufacturers and make further announcements to the public in due course.\nThe safety recall will affect the manufacturers' entire distribution networks, both domestic and international.\n\n\"2. Compliance notices will be issued to facilities in terms of the National Health Act.\nEnvironmental Health Practitioners appointed in terms of section 80(1) of the Act and duly registered as such in terms of section 83(5) of the National Health Amendment Act, 2013 (Act No. 12 of 2013) should upon finding that there are in terms of section 83 (1) and (2), existing conditions which:\n(a) constitutes a violation of the right contained in section 24(a) of the Constitution;\n(b) constitutes pollution detrimental to health;\n(c) is likely to cause a health nuisance; or\n(d) constitutes a health nuisance,\n\n\"3. In terms of registration for exports by the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (DAFF), the respective processing or manufacturing establishments namely RCL Foods with an export registration number ZA32 and Enterprise Foods with an export registration number ZA 33 have been temporarily suspected [suspended?] till further notice.\n\n\"4. We advise members of the public to avoid all processed meat products that are sold as ready-to-eat. While we know that polony is definitely implicated, there is a risk of cross-contamination of other ready-to-eat processed meat products, either at production, distribution or retail. This is because _Listeria_ on the exterior casing (packaging) of polony can be transferred to other products it comes into contact with, including viennas, russians, frankfurters, other sausages, and other 'cold meat' products that are typically not cooked before eating.\n\n\"Just a reminder that people at high risk for listeriosis include:\n- pregnant women;\n- neonates (1st 28 days of life);\n- very young infants;\n- elderly persons, older than 65 years of age, and\n- anyone with a weakened immune system (due to HIV infection, cancer, diabetes, kidney disease, liver disease, people with transplants and those on immunosuppressive therapy such as oral corticosteroids, chemotherapy, or anti-TNF therapy for auto-immune disease).\n\n\"The recall of these products does not mean that members of the public must now relax and stop the 5 food-safety rules, which we have recited many times, that is, washing your hands before handling food or when coming back from the bathroom; making sure that food is well cooked; isolating raw food from cooked food; making sure that food is at an appropriate temperature; and washing non-cooked food with clean running water; as well as using only pasteurised or boiled milk products.\n\n\"It means that the general status of hygiene of the population must still be a matter of priority to society as a whole, and must remain like that forever.\"\n\n\"For media enquiries, please contact:\nMr Popo Maja\nHead of Communications\nNational Department of Health\nCell: 0725853219/012 395 9591\nFoster Mohale\nDirector: Media Relations\nNational Department of Health\nCell: 0724323792/012 395 8180\n<Foster.mohale@health.gov.za>\"\n\n--\nCharlene Jacobs\n<charlenea.jacobs@westerncape.gov.za>\n\n[ProMED-mail thanks Charlene Jacobs for the official press conference media statement from Dr Aaron Motsoaledi, South Africa Minister of Health on the listeriosis outbreak in South Africa. - Mod.ML\n\nHealthMap: South Africa: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/179]\nSee Also\nListeriosis - South Africa (08): fatal, more cases, source found, polony 20180305.5665592\nListeriosis - South Africa (07): fatal, more cases 20180224.5648305\nListeriosis - South Africa (06): fatal, more cases 20180218.5635764\nListeriosis - South Africa (05): fatal, more cases 20180131.5596282\nListeriosis - South Africa (04): comment 20180126.5586393\nListeriosis - South Africa (03): fatal, increasing incidence, ST6 20180122.5577247\nListeriosis - South Africa (02): fatal, increasing incidence, ST6 20180117.5566300\nListeriosis - South Africa: fatal, increasing incidence, ST6 20180108.5545556\n2017\n----\nListeriosis - South Africa (04): fatal, increasing incidence 20171217.5508986\nListeriosis - South Africa (03): fatal, increasing incidence, genotyping 20171206.5487695\nListeriosis - South Africa (02): fatal, increasing incidence, RFI 20171205.5484927\nListeriosis - South Africa: increasing incidence 20171025.5402225\n.................................................lm/ml/mj/lxl", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "listeriosis"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2021-03-09 00:00:00", "2017-01-16 00:00:00", "2018-03-16 00:00:00", "2018-03-16 00:00:00", "2013-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-08 00:00:00", "2021-03-07 00:00:00", "2021-03-06 00:00:00", "2021-03-05 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2017-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Soweto", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "South Africa", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Geneva", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Polokwane", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "5672344", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Listeriosis - Australia (02): fatal, cantaloupe, more cases", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=5672344", "date": "2018-03-05 12:14:13", "main_text": "LISTERIOSIS - SOUTH AFRICA (09): FATAL, HEALTH DEPARTMENT PRESS RELEASE\n***********************************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Sun 4 Mar 2018\nFrom: Charlene Jacobs <charlenea.jacobs@westerncape.gov.za> [edited]\n\n\nPress conference media statement from the Minister of Health Dr Aaron Motsoaledi, Department of Health, Republic of South Africa, regarding the update on the listeriosis outbreak in South Africa\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\"The situation now is as follows:\n\n\"As of [2 mar 2018], the total of laboratory-confirmed cases has risen to 948, still counting from January 2017.

This is because _Listeria_ on the exterior casing (packaging) of polony can be transferred to other products it comes into contact with, including viennas, russians, frankfurters, other sausages, and other 'cold meat' products that are typically not cooked before eating.\n\n\"Just a reminder that people at high risk for listeriosis include:\n- pregnant women;\n- neonates (1st 28 days of life);\n- very young infants;\n- elderly persons, older than 65 years of age, and\n- anyone with a weakened immune system (due to HIV infection, cancer, diabetes, kidney disease, liver disease, people with transplants and those on immunosuppressive therapy such as oral corticosteroids, chemotherapy, or anti-TNF therapy for auto-immune disease).\n\n\"The recall of these products does not mean that members of the public must now relax and stop the 5 food-safety rules, which we have recited many times, that is, washing your hands before handling food or when coming back from the bathroom; making sure that food is well cooked; isolating raw food from cooked food; making sure that food is at an appropriate temperature; and washing non-cooked food with clean running water; as well as using only pasteurised or boiled milk products.\n\n\"It means that the general status of hygiene of the population must still be a matter of priority to society as a whole, and must remain like that forever.\"\n\n\"For media enquiries, please contact:\nMr Popo Maja\nHead of Communications\nNational Department of Health\nCell: 0725853219/012 395 9591\nFoster Mohale\nDirector: Media Relations\nNational Department of Health\nCell: 0724323792/012 395 8180\n<Foster.mohale@health.gov.za>\"\n\n--\nCharlene Jacobs\n<charlenea.jacobs@westerncape.gov.za>\n\n[ProMED-mail thanks Charlene Jacobs for the official press conference media statement from Dr Aaron Motsoaledi, South Africa Minister of Health on the listeriosis outbreak in South Africa. - Mod.ML\n\nHealthMap: South Africa: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/179]\nSee Also\nListeriosis - South Africa (08): fatal, more cases, source found, polony 20180305.5665592\nListeriosis - South Africa (07): fatal, more cases 20180224.5648305\nListeriosis - South Africa (06): fatal, more cases 20180218.5635764\nListeriosis - South Africa (05): fatal, more cases 20180131.5596282\nListeriosis - South Africa (04): comment 20180126.5586393\nListeriosis - South Africa (03): fatal, increasing incidence, ST6 20180122.5577247\nListeriosis - South Africa (02): fatal, increasing incidence, ST6 20180117.5566300\nListeriosis - South Africa: fatal, increasing incidence, ST6 20180108.5545556\n2017\n----\nListeriosis - South Africa (04): fatal, increasing incidence 20171217.5508986\nListeriosis - South Africa (03): fatal, increasing incidence, genotyping 20171206.5487695\nListeriosis - South Africa (02): fatal, increasing incidence, RFI 20171205.5484927\nListeriosis - South Africa: increasing incidence 20171025.5402225\n.................................................lm/ml/mj/lxl", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "listeriosis"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2021-03-09 00:00:00", "2017-01-16 00:00:00", "2018-03-16 00:00:00", "2018-03-16 00:00:00", "2013-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-08 00:00:00", "2021-03-07 00:00:00", "2021-03-06 00:00:00", "2021-03-05 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2017-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Soweto", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "South Africa", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Geneva", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Polokwane", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "5665592", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Listeriosis - South Africa (08): fatal, more cases, source found, polony", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=5665592", "date": "2018-01-22 20:54:48", "main_text": "LISTERIOSIS - SOUTH AFRICA (03): FATAL, INCREASING INCIDENCE, ST6\n*****************************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Mon 22 Jan 2018\nSource: Poultry World [edited]\nhttp://www.poultryworld.net/Meat/Articles/2018/1/Poultry-under-suspicion-in-worst-listeriosis-outbreak-238226E/\n\n\nCooked chicken and other deli meats such as ham and Bologna sausage are high on the list of suspects for causing the world's worst ever recorded listeriosis outbreak.\n\nAt least 81 people have died in the ongoing outbreak in South Africa, according to the country's National Institute of Communicable Diseases (NICD), with the number of recorded cases now 767 spread across all 9 provinces.

The illnesses happened in 2014, but it took investigators until now to determine the cause. Two patients got sick from the bacteria, one in California and one in Florida, and the patient in Florida died.\n\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported Friday [18 Mar 2016] that the outbreak had been traced to unpasteurized raw milk produced by Miller's Organic Farm in Bird-In-Hand, Pennsylvania.\n\nIn January [2016], the FDA found _Listeria_ in samples of raw chocolate milk produced by the same company and said genetic testing confirmed it was closely related to the strain that sent the 2 patients to the hospital in 2014.\n\nAmos Miller, the owner of Miller's Organic Farm, said the company operates as a private membership club and only supplies milk and other farm-grown products to members.

The illnesses happened in 2014, but it took investigators until now to determine the cause. Two patients got sick from the bacteria, one in California and one in Florida, and the patient in Florida died.\n\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported Friday [18 Mar 2016] that the outbreak had been traced to unpasteurized raw milk produced by Miller's Organic Farm in Bird-In-Hand, Pennsylvania.\n\nIn January [2016], the FDA found _Listeria_ in samples of raw chocolate milk produced by the same company and said genetic testing confirmed it was closely related to the strain that sent the 2 patients to the hospital in 2014.\n\nAmos Miller, the owner of Miller's Organic Farm, said the company operates as a private membership club and only supplies milk and other farm-grown products to members. It does not distribute to retail stores or other outlets. Miller told CBS News the company is still selling raw milk and is not aware of any health problems. \"I don't know that it was proved it's on the farm here,\" he said. \"We hope and pray for the best.\"\n\nPublic health officials have long advised people not to drink raw milk or consume other unpasteurized dairy products because of the risk that it may contain dangerous pathogens like _Listeria_, _Salmonella_, _Escherichia coli_ and _Campylobacter_ bacteria. Pasteurized milk has been heated to high enough temperatures to kill the bacteria.\n\nThere have been a number of other widely publicized listeriosis outbreaks in recent years, including one last year traced to Blue Bell Creameries ice cream which killed 3 people and sickened 10. In 2014, 7 people died from listeriosis in caramel apples.\n\nYoung children, older adults, and people with weakened immune systems are at highest risk of severe illness from listeriosis. It's also a serious concern for pregnant women as the bacteria can lead to miscarriage, stillbirth, premature delivery or life-threatening infections in newborns.\n\nThe CDC says symptoms of listeriosis usually develop within a few days of eating contaminated food and may include fever, muscle aches, headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance, and convulsions. Life-threatening complications can develop if the bacteria get into the bloodstream or central nervous system.\n\nAlthough no recall related to this latest outbreak has been announced, the CDC warned consumers to be wary. \"Because _Listeria_ was recently found in raw milk produced by Miller's Organic Farm, CDC is concerned that conditions may exist at the farm that may cause further contamination of raw milk and raw dairy products distributed by this company and make people sick,\" the CDC said in a statement.\n\n[Byline: Paula Cohen]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Unpasteurized milk is an important vehicle for transmission of pathogens, which include _Brucella _ species, _Mycobacterium bovis_, _Salmonella_ species, _Listeria monocytogenes_, _Campylobacter_ species, _Yersinia_ species, _Coxiella burnetii_, and Shiga toxin-producing _E. coli_.

The illnesses happened in 2014, but it took investigators until now to determine the cause. Two patients got sick from the bacteria, one in California and one in Florida, and the patient in Florida died.\n\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported Friday [18 Mar 2016] that the outbreak had been traced to unpasteurized raw milk produced by Miller's Organic Farm in Bird-In-Hand, Pennsylvania.\n\nIn January [2016], the FDA found _Listeria_ in samples of raw chocolate milk produced by the same company and said genetic testing confirmed it was closely related to the strain that sent the 2 patients to the hospital in 2014.\n\nAmos Miller, the owner of Miller's Organic Farm, said the company operates as a private membership club and only supplies milk and other farm-grown products to members. It does not distribute to retail stores or other outlets. Miller told CBS News the company is still selling raw milk and is not aware of any health problems. \"I don't know that it was proved it's on the farm here,\" he said. \"We hope and pray for the best.\"\n\nPublic health officials have long advised people not to drink raw milk or consume other unpasteurized dairy products because of the risk that it may contain dangerous pathogens like _Listeria_, _Salmonella_, _Escherichia coli_ and _Campylobacter_ bacteria. Pasteurized milk has been heated to high enough temperatures to kill the bacteria.\n\nThere have been a number of other widely publicized listeriosis outbreaks in recent years, including one last year traced to Blue Bell Creameries ice cream which killed 3 people and sickened 10. In 2014, 7 people died from listeriosis in caramel apples.\n\nYoung children, older adults, and people with weakened immune systems are at highest risk of severe illness from listeriosis. It's also a serious concern for pregnant women as the bacteria can lead to miscarriage, stillbirth, premature delivery or life-threatening infections in newborns.\n\nThe CDC says symptoms of listeriosis usually develop within a few days of eating contaminated food and may include fever, muscle aches, headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance, and convulsions. Life-threatening complications can develop if the bacteria get into the bloodstream or central nervous system.\n\nAlthough no recall related to this latest outbreak has been announced, the CDC warned consumers to be wary. \"Because _Listeria_ was recently found in raw milk produced by Miller's Organic Farm, CDC is concerned that conditions may exist at the farm that may cause further contamination of raw milk and raw dairy products distributed by this company and make people sick,\" the CDC said in a statement.\n\n[Byline: Paula Cohen]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Unpasteurized milk is an important vehicle for transmission of pathogens, which include _Brucella _ species, _Mycobacterium bovis_, _Salmonella_ species, _Listeria monocytogenes_, _Campylobacter_ species, _Yersinia_ species, _Coxiella burnetii_, and Shiga toxin-producing _E. coli_. In 1987, the United States Food and Drug Administration prohibited distribution of unpasteurized dairy products in interstate commerce for sale to consumers (http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/18/3/11-1370_article).\n\nHowever, sale of unpasteurized dairy products within the state where they are produced is regulated by each state, and some states permit sale of these products within these states. To circumvent these regulations for commercial sale of unpasteurized milk, some states allow milk producers to distribute unpasteurized milk through cow-leasing programs, whereby members purchase shares in dairy cows in exchange for a percentage of the milk produced (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5125a2.htm).\n\nExactly what the arrangement described as a \"private membership club\" that the unpasteurized milk producer in Pennsylvania had with its \"members\" who developed listeriosis, one in California and one in Florida, is not detailed in the news report above.

The illnesses happened in 2014, but it took investigators until now to determine the cause. Two patients got sick from the bacteria, one in California and one in Florida, and the patient in Florida died.\n\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported Friday [18 Mar 2016] that the outbreak had been traced to unpasteurized raw milk produced by Miller's Organic Farm in Bird-In-Hand, Pennsylvania.\n\nIn January [2016], the FDA found _Listeria_ in samples of raw chocolate milk produced by the same company and said genetic testing confirmed it was closely related to the strain that sent the 2 patients to the hospital in 2014.\n\nAmos Miller, the owner of Miller's Organic Farm, said the company operates as a private membership club and only supplies milk and other farm-grown products to members. It does not distribute to retail stores or other outlets. Miller told CBS News the company is still selling raw milk and is not aware of any health problems. \"I don't know that it was proved it's on the farm here,\" he said. \"We hope and pray for the best.\"\n\nPublic health officials have long advised people not to drink raw milk or consume other unpasteurized dairy products because of the risk that it may contain dangerous pathogens like _Listeria_, _Salmonella_, _Escherichia coli_ and _Campylobacter_ bacteria. Pasteurized milk has been heated to high enough temperatures to kill the bacteria.\n\nThere have been a number of other widely publicized listeriosis outbreaks in recent years, including one last year traced to Blue Bell Creameries ice cream which killed 3 people and sickened 10. In 2014, 7 people died from listeriosis in caramel apples.\n\nYoung children, older adults, and people with weakened immune systems are at highest risk of severe illness from listeriosis. It's also a serious concern for pregnant women as the bacteria can lead to miscarriage, stillbirth, premature delivery or life-threatening infections in newborns.\n\nThe CDC says symptoms of listeriosis usually develop within a few days of eating contaminated food and may include fever, muscle aches, headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance, and convulsions. Life-threatening complications can develop if the bacteria get into the bloodstream or central nervous system.\n\nAlthough no recall related to this latest outbreak has been announced, the CDC warned consumers to be wary. \"Because _Listeria_ was recently found in raw milk produced by Miller's Organic Farm, CDC is concerned that conditions may exist at the farm that may cause further contamination of raw milk and raw dairy products distributed by this company and make people sick,\" the CDC said in a statement.\n\n[Byline: Paula Cohen]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Unpasteurized milk is an important vehicle for transmission of pathogens, which include _Brucella _ species, _Mycobacterium bovis_, _Salmonella_ species, _Listeria monocytogenes_, _Campylobacter_ species, _Yersinia_ species, _Coxiella burnetii_, and Shiga toxin-producing _E. coli_. In 1987, the United States Food and Drug Administration prohibited distribution of unpasteurized dairy products in interstate commerce for sale to consumers (http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/18/3/11-1370_article).\n\nHowever, sale of unpasteurized dairy products within the state where they are produced is regulated by each state, and some states permit sale of these products within these states. To circumvent these regulations for commercial sale of unpasteurized milk, some states allow milk producers to distribute unpasteurized milk through cow-leasing programs, whereby members purchase shares in dairy cows in exchange for a percentage of the milk produced (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5125a2.htm).\n\nExactly what the arrangement described as a \"private membership club\" that the unpasteurized milk producer in Pennsylvania had with its \"members\" who developed listeriosis, one in California and one in Florida, is not detailed in the news report above. The clinical isolates from the 2 cases had a genotype that was closely related to the strains isolated from raw chocolate milk produced by the same company. No recall related to this latest outbreak has been announced.\n\nFor a discussion of listeriosis, please see my comments in ProMED-mail post Listeriosis, fatal - USA: (CO) 20110605.1719. - Mod.ML\n\nProMED HealthMaps:\nFlorida http://healthmap.org/promed/p/212\nCalifornia http://healthmap.org/promed/p/204]\nSee Also\nListeriosis -

PulseNet is the national subtyping network of public health and food regulatory agency laboratories coordinated by CDC. DNA \"fingerprinting\" is performed on _Listeria_ bacteria isolated from ill people by using techniques called pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and whole genome sequencing (WGS). PulseNet manages a national database of these DNA fingerprints to identify possible outbreaks. WGS gives a more detailed DNA fingerprint than PFGE. This additional detail was important because 5 rare PFGE fingerprints of _Listeria_ were included in this investigation. The sequencing showed that the _Listeria_ strains with the 5 rare PFGE fingerprints were closely related genetically.\n\n30 people infected with one of the closely related _Listeria_ strains were reported from 10 states since 16 Jun 2010. The number of ill people reported from each state was as follows: California (18), Colorado (1), Illinois (2), Massachusetts (2), Michigan (1), New York (2), Ohio (1), Tennessee (1), Virginia (1), and Washington (1).\n\nDates of _Listeria_ specimen collection ranged from 16 Jun 2010 to 24 Aug 2015. The cluster was 1st identified in August 2015 after investigators saw an increase in one of the 5 rare PFGE fingerprints reported to PulseNet. WGS found that the 4 other PFGE fingerprints were closely related genetically to the 1st PFGE fingerprint. Illnesses associated with those PFGE fingerprints were added to the investigation, including illnesses that occurred over 5 years ago.\n\nIll people ranged in age from less than one year to 92, and the median age was 73. 70 percent of ill people were female. 28 (93 percent) of 30 ill people for whom information was available reported being hospitalized. Six of the illnesses were pregnancy-related, and one illness resulted in a fetal loss. Three deaths were reported from California (2) and Ohio (1).\n\nEpidemiologic and laboratory information indicated that soft cheeses distributed by Karoun Dairies were the likely source of this outbreak.\n\nState and local health departments interviewed ill people about the foods they may have eaten or other exposures in the month before their illness began. 20 (67 percent) of 30 people with available information were of Middle Eastern or Eastern European descent or shopped at Middle Eastern or Eastern European-style markets. Of 28 ill people for whom information was available, 21 (75 percent) consumed soft cheese, and all of those 21 (100 percent) reported eating Middle Eastern, Eastern European, Mediterranean, or Mexican-style cheeses, including ani, feta (e.g., Bulgarian feta), Middle Eastern-style string cheese, nabulsi, and village cheese. Three of 7 ill people who specified the brand of cheese eaten reported brands distributed by Karoun Dairies. An additional ill person was unable to name the brand of cheese eaten but described the packaging and label of a Karoun product. No other brand of soft cheese was reported more than once. One other ill person reported eating Karoun brand kefir cheese. This person was previously included in the number of people reporting a Karoun brand soft cheese, but has now been excluded, since kefir is typically classified as a yogurt product rather than a cheese.\n\nFDA isolated _Listeria monocytogenes_ from 2 environmental samples collected in September 2015 from the Central Valley Cheese, Inc. manufacturing facility in Turlock, California. Central Valley Cheese, Inc. manufactures cheese for Karoun Dairies. Whole genome sequencing showed that these isolates were closely related genetically to isolates from ill people. In addition, whole genome sequencing showed that 5 _Listeria_ isolates collected in 2010 from the same facility were also closely related genetically to isolates from ill people.\n\nOn 16 Sep 2015, Karoun Dairies, Inc. voluntarily recalled certain cheeses that the company distributes due to possible contamination with _Listeria_. The recall includes several brands and types of cheeses that were distributed to retail outlets in the United States. Products were sold under the following brands: Karoun, Arz, Gopi, Queso Del Valle, Central Valley Creamery, and Yanni. Products were vacuum packed in jars or in pails.

PulseNet is the national subtyping network of public health and food regulatory agency laboratories coordinated by CDC. DNA \"fingerprinting\" is performed on _Listeria_ bacteria isolated from ill people by using techniques called pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and whole genome sequencing (WGS). PulseNet manages a national database of these DNA fingerprints to identify possible outbreaks. WGS gives a more detailed DNA fingerprint than PFGE. This additional detail was important because 5 rare PFGE fingerprints of _Listeria_ were included in this investigation. The sequencing showed that the _Listeria_ strains with the 5 rare PFGE fingerprints were closely related genetically.\n\n30 people infected with one of the closely related _Listeria_ strains were reported from 10 states since 16 Jun 2010. The number of ill people reported from each state was as follows: California (18), Colorado (1), Illinois (2), Massachusetts (2), Michigan (1), New York (2), Ohio (1), Tennessee (1), Virginia (1), and Washington (1).\n\nDates of _Listeria_ specimen collection ranged from 16 Jun 2010 to 24 Aug 2015. The cluster was 1st identified in August 2015 after investigators saw an increase in one of the 5 rare PFGE fingerprints reported to PulseNet. WGS found that the 4 other PFGE fingerprints were closely related genetically to the 1st PFGE fingerprint. Illnesses associated with those PFGE fingerprints were added to the investigation, including illnesses that occurred over 5 years ago.\n\nIll people ranged in age from less than one year to 92, and the median age was 73. 70 percent of ill people were female. 28 (93 percent) of 30 ill people for whom information was available reported being hospitalized. Six of the illnesses were pregnancy-related, and one illness resulted in a fetal loss. Three deaths were reported from California (2) and Ohio (1).\n\nEpidemiologic and laboratory information indicated that soft cheeses distributed by Karoun Dairies were the likely source of this outbreak.\n\nState and local health departments interviewed ill people about the foods they may have eaten or other exposures in the month before their illness began. 20 (67 percent) of 30 people with available information were of Middle Eastern or Eastern European descent or shopped at Middle Eastern or Eastern European-style markets. Of 28 ill people for whom information was available, 21 (75 percent) consumed soft cheese, and all of those 21 (100 percent) reported eating Middle Eastern, Eastern European, Mediterranean, or Mexican-style cheeses, including ani, feta (e.g., Bulgarian feta), Middle Eastern-style string cheese, nabulsi, and village cheese. Three of 7 ill people who specified the brand of cheese eaten reported brands distributed by Karoun Dairies. An additional ill person was unable to name the brand of cheese eaten but described the packaging and label of a Karoun product. No other brand of soft cheese was reported more than once. One other ill person reported eating Karoun brand kefir cheese. This person was previously included in the number of people reporting a Karoun brand soft cheese, but has now been excluded, since kefir is typically classified as a yogurt product rather than a cheese.\n\nFDA isolated _Listeria monocytogenes_ from 2 environmental samples collected in September 2015 from the Central Valley Cheese, Inc. manufacturing facility in Turlock, California. Central Valley Cheese, Inc. manufactures cheese for Karoun Dairies. Whole genome sequencing showed that these isolates were closely related genetically to isolates from ill people. In addition, whole genome sequencing showed that 5 _Listeria_ isolates collected in 2010 from the same facility were also closely related genetically to isolates from ill people.\n\nOn 16 Sep 2015, Karoun Dairies, Inc. voluntarily recalled certain cheeses that the company distributes due to possible contamination with _Listeria_. The recall includes several brands and types of cheeses that were distributed to retail outlets in the United States. Products were sold under the following brands: Karoun, Arz, Gopi, Queso Del Valle, Central Valley Creamery, and Yanni. Products were vacuum packed in jars or in pails. Weights vary from 5 ounces to 30 pounds. A full list of cheeses is available on the Advice to Consumers, Restaurants, and Retailers page.\n\nThis outbreak investigation is over. However, people could continue to get sick because recalled cheeses may still be in homes, restaurants, or retail locations.

PulseNet is the national subtyping network of public health and food regulatory agency laboratories coordinated by CDC. DNA \"fingerprinting\" is performed on _Listeria_ bacteria isolated from ill people by using techniques called pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and whole genome sequencing (WGS). PulseNet manages a national database of these DNA fingerprints to identify possible outbreaks. WGS gives a more detailed DNA fingerprint than PFGE. This additional detail was important because 5 rare PFGE fingerprints of _Listeria_ were included in this investigation. The sequencing showed that the _Listeria_ strains with the 5 rare PFGE fingerprints were closely related genetically.\n\n30 people infected with one of the closely related _Listeria_ strains were reported from 10 states since 16 Jun 2010. The number of ill people reported from each state was as follows: California (18), Colorado (1), Illinois (2), Massachusetts (2), Michigan (1), New York (2), Ohio (1), Tennessee (1), Virginia (1), and Washington (1).\n\nDates of _Listeria_ specimen collection ranged from 16 Jun 2010 to 24 Aug 2015. The cluster was 1st identified in August 2015 after investigators saw an increase in one of the 5 rare PFGE fingerprints reported to PulseNet. WGS found that the 4 other PFGE fingerprints were closely related genetically to the 1st PFGE fingerprint. Illnesses associated with those PFGE fingerprints were added to the investigation, including illnesses that occurred over 5 years ago.\n\nIll people ranged in age from less than one year to 92, and the median age was 73. 70 percent of ill people were female. 28 (93 percent) of 30 ill people for whom information was available reported being hospitalized. Six of the illnesses were pregnancy-related, and one illness resulted in a fetal loss. Three deaths were reported from California (2) and Ohio (1).\n\nEpidemiologic and laboratory information indicated that soft cheeses distributed by Karoun Dairies were the likely source of this outbreak.\n\nState and local health departments interviewed ill people about the foods they may have eaten or other exposures in the month before their illness began. 20 (67 percent) of 30 people with available information were of Middle Eastern or Eastern European descent or shopped at Middle Eastern or Eastern European-style markets. Of 28 ill people for whom information was available, 21 (75 percent) consumed soft cheese, and all of those 21 (100 percent) reported eating Middle Eastern, Eastern European, Mediterranean, or Mexican-style cheeses, including ani, feta (e.g., Bulgarian feta), Middle Eastern-style string cheese, nabulsi, and village cheese. Three of 7 ill people who specified the brand of cheese eaten reported brands distributed by Karoun Dairies. An additional ill person was unable to name the brand of cheese eaten but described the packaging and label of a Karoun product. No other brand of soft cheese was reported more than once. One other ill person reported eating Karoun brand kefir cheese. This person was previously included in the number of people reporting a Karoun brand soft cheese, but has now been excluded, since kefir is typically classified as a yogurt product rather than a cheese.\n\nFDA isolated _Listeria monocytogenes_ from 2 environmental samples collected in September 2015 from the Central Valley Cheese, Inc. manufacturing facility in Turlock, California. Central Valley Cheese, Inc. manufactures cheese for Karoun Dairies. Whole genome sequencing showed that these isolates were closely related genetically to isolates from ill people. In addition, whole genome sequencing showed that 5 _Listeria_ isolates collected in 2010 from the same facility were also closely related genetically to isolates from ill people.\n\nOn 16 Sep 2015, Karoun Dairies, Inc. voluntarily recalled certain cheeses that the company distributes due to possible contamination with _Listeria_. The recall includes several brands and types of cheeses that were distributed to retail outlets in the United States. Products were sold under the following brands: Karoun, Arz, Gopi, Queso Del Valle, Central Valley Creamery, and Yanni. Products were vacuum packed in jars or in pails. Weights vary from 5 ounces to 30 pounds. A full list of cheeses is available on the Advice to Consumers, Restaurants, and Retailers page.\n\nThis outbreak investigation is over. However, people could continue to get sick because recalled cheeses may still be in homes, restaurants, or retail locations.

PulseNet is the national subtyping network of public health and food regulatory agency laboratories coordinated by CDC. DNA \"fingerprinting\" is performed on _Listeria_ bacteria isolated from ill people by using techniques called pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and whole genome sequencing (WGS). PulseNet manages a national database of these DNA fingerprints to identify possible outbreaks. WGS gives a more detailed DNA fingerprint than PFGE. This additional detail was important because 5 rare PFGE fingerprints of _Listeria_ were included in this investigation. The sequencing showed that the _Listeria_ strains with the 5 rare PFGE fingerprints were closely related genetically.\n\n30 people infected with one of the closely related _Listeria_ strains were reported from 10 states since 16 Jun 2010. The number of ill people reported from each state was as follows: California (18), Colorado (1), Illinois (2), Massachusetts (2), Michigan (1), New York (2), Ohio (1), Tennessee (1), Virginia (1), and Washington (1).\n\nDates of _Listeria_ specimen collection ranged from 16 Jun 2010 to 24 Aug 2015. The cluster was 1st identified in August 2015 after investigators saw an increase in one of the 5 rare PFGE fingerprints reported to PulseNet. WGS found that the 4 other PFGE fingerprints were closely related genetically to the 1st PFGE fingerprint. Illnesses associated with those PFGE fingerprints were added to the investigation, including illnesses that occurred over 5 years ago.\n\nIll people ranged in age from less than one year to 92, and the median age was 73. 70 percent of ill people were female. 28 (93 percent) of 30 ill people for whom information was available reported being hospitalized. Six of the illnesses were pregnancy-related, and one illness resulted in a fetal loss. Three deaths were reported from California (2) and Ohio (1).\n\nEpidemiologic and laboratory information indicated that soft cheeses distributed by Karoun Dairies were the likely source of this outbreak.\n\nState and local health departments interviewed ill people about the foods they may have eaten or other exposures in the month before their illness began. 20 (67 percent) of 30 people with available information were of Middle Eastern or Eastern European descent or shopped at Middle Eastern or Eastern European-style markets. Of 28 ill people for whom information was available, 21 (75 percent) consumed soft cheese, and all of those 21 (100 percent) reported eating Middle Eastern, Eastern European, Mediterranean, or Mexican-style cheeses, including ani, feta (e.g., Bulgarian feta), Middle Eastern-style string cheese, nabulsi, and village cheese. Three of 7 ill people who specified the brand of cheese eaten reported brands distributed by Karoun Dairies. An additional ill person was unable to name the brand of cheese eaten but described the packaging and label of a Karoun product. No other brand of soft cheese was reported more than once. One other ill person reported eating Karoun brand kefir cheese. This person was previously included in the number of people reporting a Karoun brand soft cheese, but has now been excluded, since kefir is typically classified as a yogurt product rather than a cheese.\n\nFDA isolated _Listeria monocytogenes_ from 2 environmental samples collected in September 2015 from the Central Valley Cheese, Inc. manufacturing facility in Turlock, California. Central Valley Cheese, Inc. manufactures cheese for Karoun Dairies. Whole genome sequencing showed that these isolates were closely related genetically to isolates from ill people. In addition, whole genome sequencing showed that 5 _Listeria_ isolates collected in 2010 from the same facility were also closely related genetically to isolates from ill people.\n\nOn 16 Sep 2015, Karoun Dairies, Inc. voluntarily recalled certain cheeses that the company distributes due to possible contamination with _Listeria_. The recall includes several brands and types of cheeses that were distributed to retail outlets in the United States. Products were sold under the following brands: Karoun, Arz, Gopi, Queso Del Valle, Central Valley Creamery, and Yanni. Products were vacuum packed in jars or in pails. Weights vary from 5 ounces to 30 pounds. A full list of cheeses is available on the Advice to Consumers, Restaurants, and Retailers page.\n\nThis outbreak investigation is over. However, people could continue to get sick because recalled cheeses may still be in homes, restaurants, or retail locations. Consumers, restaurants, and retailers unaware of the recall could eat, serve, or sell them.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[For discussions of listeriosis, please see my comments in prior ProMED-mail posts listed below. - Mod.ML\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/106.]\nSee Also\nListeriosis - USA (10): fatal, soft cheeses, recall, alert 20150919.3657295\nListeriosis - USA (09): PulseNet, data collection, problems 20150721.3525757\nListeriosis - USA (08): fatal, nosocomial, ice cream, risk remains 20150615.3437487\nListeriosis - USA (07): ice cream, whole gene sequencing detection 20150506.3344944\nListeriosis - Canada: apple products, alert, recall 20150503.3336094\nListeriosis - Denmark: multiple genotypes 20150429.3331222\nListeriosis - USA (06): (KS,TX) fatal, nosocomial, ice cream, recall, update 20150411.3291517\nListeriosis - USA (05): stone fruit 2014 20150321.3244417\nListeriosis - USA (04): (KS) fatal, nosocomial, ice cream 20150315.3231917\nListeriosis - USA (03): (IL,MI) fatal, sprouts, investigation closed 20150129.3129444\nListeriosis - USA (02): fatal, caramel-coated, prepackaged apples, update, alert 20150112.3085796\nListeriosis - USA: fatal, caramel-coated and pre-packaged apples, update, alert 20150103.3068902\n.................................................sb/ml/msp/dk", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "listeriosis"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2021-03-11 00:00:00", "2015-03-16 00:00:00", "2010-06-16 00:00:00", "2010-06-16 00:00:00", "2015-08-24 00:00:00", "2021-03-01 00:00:00", "2015-08-16 00:00:00", "1973-03-16 00:00:00", "2015-09-16 00:00:00", "2010-03-16 00:00:00", "2015-09-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-09 00:00:00", "2021-03-08 00:00:00", "2021-03-07 00:00:00", "2021-03-06 00:00:00", "2021-03-05 00:00:00", "2014-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "the United States", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Tennessee", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "FATAL", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Michigan", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Virginia", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "update", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "New York", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "soft cheese", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Massachusetts", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Colorado", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Turlock", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Washington", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Ohio", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Illinois", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "California", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "3657295", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Listeriosis - USA (10): fatal, soft cheeses, recall, alert", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=3657295", "date": "2015-03-21 22:23:27", "main_text": "LISTERIOSIS - USA (05): STONE FRUIT 2014\n*****************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Fri 20 Mar 2015\nSource: CDC.

On 31 Jul 2014, the recall was expanded to cover all fruit packed at their facility during 1 Jun 2014-17 Jul 2014 (2). After the initial recall, clinicians, state and local health departments, CDC, and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) received many inquiries about listeriosis from concerned consumers, many of whom had received automated telephone calls informing them that they had purchased recalled fruit. During 19-31 Jul 2014, the CDC _Listeria_ website received more than 500 000 page views, more than 7 times the views received during the previous 52 weeks. However, no molecular information from _L. monocytogenes_ isolates was available to assess whether human illnesses might be linked to these products.\n\nIn early August 2014, a 2-enzyme pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) pattern shared by 3 _L. monocytogenes_ isolates from stone fruit associated with the recall was uploaded to PulseNet, the national molecular subtyping network for foodborne disease surveillance. 4 human isolates with isolation dates during the period 8 May 2014-8 Jul 2014 (Illinois, Massachusetts, and South Carolina) and 28 Aug 2014 (Minnesota) were identified that had PFGE patterns indistinguishable from isolates from company A stone fruit. Samples of stone fruits from company A collected after the recall yielded an additional 31 _L. monocytogenes_ isolates, 22 of which were indistinguishable from the initial isolates by PFGE; 3 other PFGE patterns were identified that did not match any isolates from clinical specimens collected during 1 May-31 Aug 2014. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) analysis by whole-genome multilocus sequence typing showed that isolates from the Massachusetts and Minnesota patients were highly related (less than 10 allele differences and less than 10 high-quality single nucleotide polymorphism differences) to the isolates from recalled stone fruits, whereas the Illinois and South Carolina isolates were not.\n\nA review of the standardized _Listeria_ Initiative exposure questionnaire (3) for the Massachusetts patient showed that organic nectarine consumption was recorded, although the form does not specifically ask about stone fruit consumption. A subsequent interview using a questionnaire with questions about stone fruits indicated that the patient consumed nectarines and peaches purchased from stores that sold company A stone fruit. Traceback using receipts and shopper card data indicated the patient's family purchased recalled fruit. An interview with a family member of the Minnesota patient revealed that the patient consumed peaches from a store that received company A stone fruit; however, dates from receipts indicated that the peaches were purchased after the recalled fruit was reported to have been removed from the shelves. After removal of recalled fruit, the store received company A peaches that were not part of the recall as well as peaches from another California supplier. The South Carolina patient reportedly did not eat stone fruit before becoming ill. Family of the Illinois patient could not be reached for interview.\n\nStrong evidence linked the Massachusetts case to recalled stone fruit, including food exposure interviews, receipt and shopper card data, and WGS results showing very high genetic relatedness between the patient's isolate and isolates from nectarines. Consumption data and WGS results suggest that stone fruit was also the likely source of _L. monocytogenes_ infection in the Minnesota case; however, the later dates of illness onset and fruit purchase suggest that the patient consumed stone fruit that was not included in the recall.\n\nThis is the 1st reported link between human listeriosis and stone fruit. WGS results provided a basis for focusing resources for extended case interviews and follow-up. Specifically, among cases that matched the recalled stone fruit by PFGE, WGS allowed differentiation between sporadic cases and cases associated with stone fruit consumption.\n\nReported listeriosis is much more common in pregnant women than in the general population and can cause major fetal and perinatal complications. Because of this higher risk, and partially in response to public concern stemming from these recalls, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists issued guidelines for management of pregnant women with possible _L. monocytogenes_ exposure (4). Although exposure to this recalled product was likely widespread, disease was very rare. Therefore, this recall and associated illness does not provide sufficient evidence to recommend that persons at higher risk for listeriosis (such as, pregnant women, persons aged 65 years or older, and immunocompromised persons) avoid fresh stone fruits. However, it does support the need to understand risks associated with contaminated, ready-to-eat fresh fruit so that prevention strategies can be strengthened.\n\nReferences\n----------\n1. FDA.

The strangely named \"pluot(R)\" (http://www.wisegeek.org/what-are-pluots.htm) is a hybrid plant grown from a plum and an apricot. They are extremely sweet, due to very high sugar levels, and are available in a wide range of varieties. The actual ratio works out to around 70 percent plum and 30 apricot and they mainly look like plums. They have a great deal of nutritious value and are low in fat, making them ideal for snacking or sweetening up other dishes.\n\nPluots are sometimes also referred to as \"dinosaur eggs(R)\" due to the strange dappled coloring on some types of the fruit. The name has actually been trademarked by a California pluot grower, though there are still a wide range of available types with other strange-sounding names. Varieties such as the \"flavor grenade,\" \"dapple dandy,\" and \"flavorglo\" are fairly common, as are the \"hand grenade\" and the \"last chance.\" The \"flavor heart\" is one of the largest types of pluot, heart shaped with black coloring and yellow flesh, while the \"candy stripe\" has pink and yellow stripes with spotted red skin (see varieties at http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/31/31/21/6657137/3/622x350.jpg. - Mod.LL\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/106.]\nSee Also\nListeriosis - USA (04): (KS) fatal, nosocomial, ice cream 20150315.3231917\nListeriosis - USA (03): (IL,MI) fatal, sprouts, investigation closed 20150129.3129444\nListeriosis - USA (02): fatal, caramel-coated, prepackaged apples, update, alert 20150112.3085796\nListeriosis - USA: fatal, caramel-coated and pre-packaged apples, update, alert 20150103.3068902\n2014\n----\nListeriosis - USA (05): (WA) ice cream, gelato, custard, sorbet, alert 20141229.3060474\nListeriosis - Canada: (ON,MB) ex USA, susp, same genotype 20141226.3055407\nListeriosis - USA (04): fatal, caramel-coated and pre-packaged apples, alert 20141219.3044758\nListeriosis - USA (03): (IL, MI) fatal, sprouts, recall 20141109.2941351\nListeriosis - USA (02): 2013, fatal, cheese 20140410.2394195\nListeriosis - USA: (CA, MD) fatal, Hispanic-style soft cheese, recall 20140222.2294169\n.................................................ll/mj/jw", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "listeriosis"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2021-03-05 00:00:00", "2014-03-16 00:00:00", "2014-03-16 00:00:00", "2014-03-16 00:00:00", "2014-03-16 00:00:00", "2014-03-16 00:00:00", "2014-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-05 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Minnesota", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "USA", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "LL", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Illinois , Massachusetts", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "South Carolina", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Massachusetts", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "United States", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "MD", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Illinois", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "California", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "3525757", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Listeriosis - USA (09): PulseNet, data collection, problems", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=3525757", "date": "2015-03-21 22:23:27", "main_text": "LISTERIOSIS - USA (05): STONE FRUIT 2014\n*****************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Fri 20 Mar 2015\nSource: CDC.

On 31 Jul 2014, the recall was expanded to cover all fruit packed at their facility during 1 Jun 2014-17 Jul 2014 (2). After the initial recall, clinicians, state and local health departments, CDC, and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) received many inquiries about listeriosis from concerned consumers, many of whom had received automated telephone calls informing them that they had purchased recalled fruit. During 19-31 Jul 2014, the CDC _Listeria_ website received more than 500 000 page views, more than 7 times the views received during the previous 52 weeks. However, no molecular information from _L. monocytogenes_ isolates was available to assess whether human illnesses might be linked to these products.\n\nIn early August 2014, a 2-enzyme pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) pattern shared by 3 _L. monocytogenes_ isolates from stone fruit associated with the recall was uploaded to PulseNet, the national molecular subtyping network for foodborne disease surveillance. 4 human isolates with isolation dates during the period 8 May 2014-8 Jul 2014 (Illinois, Massachusetts, and South Carolina) and 28 Aug 2014 (Minnesota) were identified that had PFGE patterns indistinguishable from isolates from company A stone fruit. Samples of stone fruits from company A collected after the recall yielded an additional 31 _L. monocytogenes_ isolates, 22 of which were indistinguishable from the initial isolates by PFGE; 3 other PFGE patterns were identified that did not match any isolates from clinical specimens collected during 1 May-31 Aug 2014. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) analysis by whole-genome multilocus sequence typing showed that isolates from the Massachusetts and Minnesota patients were highly related (less than 10 allele differences and less than 10 high-quality single nucleotide polymorphism differences) to the isolates from recalled stone fruits, whereas the Illinois and South Carolina isolates were not.\n\nA review of the standardized _Listeria_ Initiative exposure questionnaire (3) for the Massachusetts patient showed that organic nectarine consumption was recorded, although the form does not specifically ask about stone fruit consumption. A subsequent interview using a questionnaire with questions about stone fruits indicated that the patient consumed nectarines and peaches purchased from stores that sold company A stone fruit. Traceback using receipts and shopper card data indicated the patient's family purchased recalled fruit. An interview with a family member of the Minnesota patient revealed that the patient consumed peaches from a store that received company A stone fruit; however, dates from receipts indicated that the peaches were purchased after the recalled fruit was reported to have been removed from the shelves. After removal of recalled fruit, the store received company A peaches that were not part of the recall as well as peaches from another California supplier. The South Carolina patient reportedly did not eat stone fruit before becoming ill. Family of the Illinois patient could not be reached for interview.\n\nStrong evidence linked the Massachusetts case to recalled stone fruit, including food exposure interviews, receipt and shopper card data, and WGS results showing very high genetic relatedness between the patient's isolate and isolates from nectarines. Consumption data and WGS results suggest that stone fruit was also the likely source of _L. monocytogenes_ infection in the Minnesota case; however, the later dates of illness onset and fruit purchase suggest that the patient consumed stone fruit that was not included in the recall.\n\nThis is the 1st reported link between human listeriosis and stone fruit. WGS results provided a basis for focusing resources for extended case interviews and follow-up. Specifically, among cases that matched the recalled stone fruit by PFGE, WGS allowed differentiation between sporadic cases and cases associated with stone fruit consumption.\n\nReported listeriosis is much more common in pregnant women than in the general population and can cause major fetal and perinatal complications. Because of this higher risk, and partially in response to public concern stemming from these recalls, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists issued guidelines for management of pregnant women with possible _L. monocytogenes_ exposure (4). Although exposure to this recalled product was likely widespread, disease was very rare. Therefore, this recall and associated illness does not provide sufficient evidence to recommend that persons at higher risk for listeriosis (such as, pregnant women, persons aged 65 years or older, and immunocompromised persons) avoid fresh stone fruits. However, it does support the need to understand risks associated with contaminated, ready-to-eat fresh fruit so that prevention strategies can be strengthened.\n\nReferences\n----------\n1. FDA.

A subsequent interview using a questionnaire with questions about stone fruits indicated that the patient consumed nectarines and peaches purchased from stores that sold company A stone fruit. Traceback using receipts and shopper card data indicated the patient's family purchased recalled fruit. An interview with a family member of the Minnesota patient revealed that the patient consumed peaches from a store that received company A stone fruit; however, dates from receipts indicated that the peaches were purchased after the recalled fruit was reported to have been removed from the shelves. After removal of recalled fruit, the store received company A peaches that were not part of the recall as well as peaches from another California supplier. The South Carolina patient reportedly did not eat stone fruit before becoming ill. Family of the Illinois patient could not be reached for interview.\n\nStrong evidence linked the Massachusetts case to recalled stone fruit, including food exposure interviews, receipt and shopper card data, and WGS results showing very high genetic relatedness between the patient's isolate and isolates from nectarines. Consumption data and WGS results suggest that stone fruit was also the likely source of _L. monocytogenes_ infection in the Minnesota case; however, the later dates of illness onset and fruit purchase suggest that the patient consumed stone fruit that was not included in the recall.\n\nThis is the 1st reported link between human listeriosis and stone fruit. WGS results provided a basis for focusing resources for extended case interviews and follow-up. Specifically, among cases that matched the recalled stone fruit by PFGE, WGS allowed differentiation between sporadic cases and cases associated with stone fruit consumption.\n\nReported listeriosis is much more common in pregnant women than in the general population and can cause major fetal and perinatal complications. Because of this higher risk, and partially in response to public concern stemming from these recalls, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists issued guidelines for management of pregnant women with possible _L. monocytogenes_ exposure (4). Although exposure to this recalled product was likely widespread, disease was very rare. Therefore, this recall and associated illness does not provide sufficient evidence to recommend that persons at higher risk for listeriosis (such as, pregnant women, persons aged 65 years or older, and immunocompromised persons) avoid fresh stone fruits. However, it does support the need to understand risks associated with contaminated, ready-to-eat fresh fruit so that prevention strategies can be strengthened.\n\nReferences\n----------\n1. FDA.

On 31 Jul 2014, the recall was expanded to cover all fruit packed at their facility during 1 Jun 2014-17 Jul 2014 (2). After the initial recall, clinicians, state and local health departments, CDC, and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) received many inquiries about listeriosis from concerned consumers, many of whom had received automated telephone calls informing them that they had purchased recalled fruit. During 19-31 Jul 2014, the CDC _Listeria_ website received more than 500 000 page views, more than 7 times the views received during the previous 52 weeks. However, no molecular information from _L. monocytogenes_ isolates was available to assess whether human illnesses might be linked to these products.\n\nIn early August 2014, a 2-enzyme pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) pattern shared by 3 _L. monocytogenes_ isolates from stone fruit associated with the recall was uploaded to PulseNet, the national molecular subtyping network for foodborne disease surveillance. 4 human isolates with isolation dates during the period 8 May 2014-8 Jul 2014 (Illinois, Massachusetts, and South Carolina) and 28 Aug 2014 (Minnesota) were identified that had PFGE patterns indistinguishable from isolates from company A stone fruit. Samples of stone fruits from company A collected after the recall yielded an additional 31 _L. monocytogenes_ isolates, 22 of which were indistinguishable from the initial isolates by PFGE; 3 other PFGE patterns were identified that did not match any isolates from clinical specimens collected during 1 May-31 Aug 2014.

On 31 Jul 2014, the recall was expanded to cover all fruit packed at their facility during 1 Jun 2014-17 Jul 2014 (2). After the initial recall, clinicians, state and local health departments, CDC, and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) received many inquiries about listeriosis from concerned consumers, many of whom had received automated telephone calls informing them that they had purchased recalled fruit. During 19-31 Jul 2014, the CDC _Listeria_ website received more than 500 000 page views, more than 7 times the views received during the previous 52 weeks. However, no molecular information from _L. monocytogenes_ isolates was available to assess whether human illnesses might be linked to these products.\n\nIn early August 2014, a 2-enzyme pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) pattern shared by 3 _L. monocytogenes_ isolates from stone fruit associated with the recall was uploaded to PulseNet, the national molecular subtyping network for foodborne disease surveillance. 4 human isolates with isolation dates during the period 8 May 2014-8 Jul 2014 (Illinois, Massachusetts, and South Carolina) and 28 Aug 2014 (Minnesota) were identified that had PFGE patterns indistinguishable from isolates from company A stone fruit. Samples of stone fruits from company A collected after the recall yielded an additional 31 _L. monocytogenes_ isolates, 22 of which were indistinguishable from the initial isolates by PFGE; 3 other PFGE patterns were identified that did not match any isolates from clinical specimens collected during 1 May-31 Aug 2014. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) analysis by whole-genome multilocus sequence typing showed that isolates from the Massachusetts and Minnesota patients were highly related (less than 10 allele differences and less than 10 high-quality single nucleotide polymorphism differences) to the isolates from recalled stone fruits, whereas the Illinois and South Carolina isolates were not.\n\nA review of the standardized _Listeria_ Initiative exposure questionnaire (3) for the Massachusetts patient showed that organic nectarine consumption was recorded, although the form does not specifically ask about stone fruit consumption. A subsequent interview using a questionnaire with questions about stone fruits indicated that the patient consumed nectarines and peaches purchased from stores that sold company A stone fruit. Traceback using receipts and shopper card data indicated the patient's family purchased recalled fruit. An interview with a family member of the Minnesota patient revealed that the patient consumed peaches from a store that received company A stone fruit; however, dates from receipts indicated that the peaches were purchased after the recalled fruit was reported to have been removed from the shelves. After removal of recalled fruit, the store received company A peaches that were not part of the recall as well as peaches from another California supplier. The South Carolina patient reportedly did not eat stone fruit before becoming ill. Family of the Illinois patient could not be reached for interview.\n\nStrong evidence linked the Massachusetts case to recalled stone fruit, including food exposure interviews, receipt and shopper card data, and WGS results showing very high genetic relatedness between the patient's isolate and isolates from nectarines. Consumption data and WGS results suggest that stone fruit was also the likely source of _L. monocytogenes_ infection in the Minnesota case; however, the later dates of illness onset and fruit purchase suggest that the patient consumed stone fruit that was not included in the recall.\n\nThis is the 1st reported link between human listeriosis and stone fruit. WGS results provided a basis for focusing resources for extended case interviews and follow-up. Specifically, among cases that matched the recalled stone fruit by PFGE, WGS allowed differentiation between sporadic cases and cases associated with stone fruit consumption.\n\nReported listeriosis is much more common in pregnant women than in the general population and can cause major fetal and perinatal complications. Because of this higher risk, and partially in response to public concern stemming from these recalls, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists issued guidelines for management of pregnant women with possible _L. monocytogenes_ exposure (4). Although exposure to this recalled product was likely widespread, disease was very rare. Therefore, this recall and associated illness does not provide sufficient evidence to recommend that persons at higher risk for listeriosis (such as, pregnant women, persons aged 65 years or older, and immunocompromised persons) avoid fresh stone fruits. However, it does support the need to understand risks associated with contaminated, ready-to-eat fresh fruit so that prevention strategies can be strengthened.\n\nReferences\n----------\n1. FDA.

These 2 brands are no longer available for purchase at retail locations; however, health officials are concerned that persons who purchased them may still have them in their homes. The investigation is evolving, and other caramel apple brands and locations may also be impacted. Minnesota officials are working with national partners to determine the scope of products impacted. Consumers should not eat any brands of commercially-produced pre-packaged caramel apples until additional information is available. At this time, no illnesses related to this outbreak have been linked to apples that are not caramel-coated and not pre-packaged.\n\nListeriosis is a serious infection caused by eating food contaminated with the bacterium _Listeria monocytogenes_. The disease affects primarily older adults, pregnant women, newborns, and persons with weakened immune systems. On average, 7 cases of listeriosis are reported in Minnesota each year. Symptoms of listeriosis include fever, muscle aches, headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance, and convulsions. Infected pregnant women may experience only a mild, flu-like illness; however, infections during pregnancy can lead to miscarriage or stillbirth, premature delivery, or infection of the newborn. Symptoms begin from 3 to 70 days after consuming the bacteria.\n\nAnyone who believes they may have become ill with listeriosis should contact their health care provider.\n\n[Byline: Bruce Clark]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n& Dr Tony Ellam\nRetired Consultant in Communicable Disease Control\n\n******\n[2]\nDate: Fri 19 Dec 2014\nSource: Chicago Tribune [edited]\nhttp://www.chicagotribune.com/lifestyles/health/chi-listeria-caramel-apples-20141219-story.html\n\n\nFive people have died and 21 others have been hospitalized in a [listeriosis] outbreak linked to caramel apples, federal health officials said today [19 Dec 2014].\n\nA total of 28 people infected with _Listeria_ have been reported from 10 states, according to a statement from the US Centers for Disease Control. 11 of the cases are in the Midwest: 5 in Missouri, 4 in Minnesota and 2 in Wisconsin.\n\n[A map of the USA showing states with cases of listeriosis linked to caramel apples is available at the source URL.]\n\nThe CDC warned consumers not to eat any pre-packaged, commercially-produced caramel apples, including those with other toppings such as nuts, chocolate or sprinkles, until more information is available. A recall, however, has not been issued as of Friday afternoon [19 Dec 2014].\n\nOf the 28 victims, 26 were hospitalized and 5 of those people died, the CDC said, adding that listeriosis contributed to at least 4 of the deaths. 9 of the cases involved a pregnant woman or her newborn infant and 3 were among otherwise healthy children aged 5 to 15 years, the CDC said. According to the studies, 83 percent of the ill people interviewed reported eating commercially produced prepackaged caramel apples.\n\nThose affected became ill between [17 Oct and 27 Nov 2014], the CDC said, adding that cases after [3 Dec 2014] might not yet be reported.\n\nListeriosis is an infection that primarily affects older adults, pregnant women, newborns and people with weakened immune symptoms. Symptoms, which begin anywhere from 3 to 70 days after consuming the bacteria, include fever, muscle aches, headache, confusion and convulsions.\n\nNo illnesses related to the outbreak have been linked to apples that are not caramel-coated and are not prepackaged, or to caramel candy, the CDC said.\n\nThe states include Missouri and New Mexico, which each had 5 cases; Minnesota, Texas and Arizona, with 4 cases each; Wisconsin, with 2 cases; and Washington, California, Utah and North Carolina, with 1 case each.\n\nIn Minnesota, those who fell ill bought caramel apples from Supervalu Inc's Cub Foods, Kwik Trip and Mike's Discount Foods, which carried Carnival brand and Kitchen Cravings brand apples, state health officials said.

Although caramel apples are often a fall seasonal product, contaminated commercially produced, prepackaged caramel apples may still be for sale at grocery stores and other retailers nationwide or may be in consumers' homes.\n\nAs of [18 Dec 2014], a total of 28 people infected with the outbreak strains of _Listeria monocytogenes_ have been reported from 10 states. 26 ill people have been hospitalized. Among the 26 people hospitalized, 5 deaths have been reported. Listeriosis contributed to at least 4 of these deaths. 9 illnesses were pregnancy-related (occurred in a pregnant woman or her newborn infant). 3 invasive illnesses (meningitis) were among otherwise healthy children aged 5-15 years.\n\n[No miscarriages or fetal losses have been reported. Among people whose illnesses were not associated with a pregnancy, ages ranged from 7 to 92 years, with a median age of 64 years, and 32 percent were female.]\n\nTo date, 15 (83 percent) of the 18 ill people interviewed reported eating commercially produced, prepackaged caramel apples before becoming ill. At this time, no illnesses related to this outbreak have been linked to apples that are not caramel-coated and not prepackaged or to caramel candy. Investigators are working quickly to determine specific brands or types of commercially produced, prepackaged caramel apples that may be linked to illnesses and to identify the source of contamination.\n\nThis investigation is rapidly evolving, and new information will be provided as it becomes available.\n\nDNA \"fingerprinting\" is performed on _Listeria_ bacteria isolated from ill persons using techniques called pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and whole genome sequencing (WGS). WGS gives a more detailed DNA fingerprint than PFGE. Two outbreak clusters were identified by the PFGE technique, and _Listeria_ isolates within each cluster were found to be highly related by the WGS technique but distinct between the 2 clusters. CDC is investigating the 2 clusters together because one person was infected with both _Listeria_ strains simultaneously and also because illnesses in the 2 clusters have occurred during a similar time period and in similar regions of the country.\n\n[An Epi Curve (a chart showing the number of persons who were diagnosed each week) of the multistate outbreak of listeriosis linked to commercially produced, prepackaged caramel apples is available at http://www.cdc.gov/listeria/outbreaks/caramel-apples-12-14/epi.html.]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The US CDC has reported that to date a total of 28 people have developed listeriosis linked to eating commercially produced, prepackaged caramel apples, including those with other toppings such as nuts, chocolate or sprinkles (15 [83 percent] of the 18 ill people interviewed reported eating caramel apples before becoming ill). Genotyping by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (EFGE) of clinical isolates identified 2 outbreak clusters, and _Listeria_ isolates within each cluster were found to be highly related by the whole genome sequencing technique. CDC considers the 2 clusters epidemiologically related because one person was infected with both _Listeria_ strains simultaneously and because illnesses in the 2 clusters have occurred during same time period and in similar regions of the country.\n\nThe outbreak so far has been reported from 10 states. 5 deaths have been reported and 9 illnesses were pregnancy-related. 3 invasive illnesses (meningitis) were among otherwise healthy children aged 5-15 years.\n\nMinnesota cases purchased 2 brands of caramel apples (Carnival brand and Kitchen Cravings brand), which are no longer available for purchase; however, health officials are concerned that persons who purchased them may still have them in their homes -- they could have a shelf life of more than one month, or perhaps other brands are involved. CDC advises that US consumers not eat any commercially produced, prepackaged caramel apples, including plain caramel apples as well as those containing nuts, sprinkles, chocolate, or other toppings, until more information becomes available.\n\nFor a discussion of listeriosis, please see my comments in ProMED-mail post Listeriosis, fatal - USA: (CO) 20110605.1719. - Mod.ML\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/106.]\nSee Also\nListeriosis - USA (03): (IL, MI) fatal, sprouts, recall 20141109.2941351\nListeriosis - USA (02): 2013, fatal, cheese 20140410.2394195\nListeriosis - USA: (CA, MD) fatal, Hispanic-style soft cheese, recall 20140222.2294169\n2013\n----\nListeriosis - USA (03): multistate, fatal, cheese, recall 20130828.1909350\nListeriosis - USA (02): (CT) ex Bosnia & Herzegovina, cheese 20130719.1832515\nListeriosis - USA: fatal, cheese, recall 20130710.1816187\n2012\n----\nListeriosis - USA (04): fatal, cheese, update 20121014.1341613\nListeriosis - USA (03): fatal, cheese, recall, update 20120923.1305794\nListeriosis - USA (02): (multistate) fatal, cheese, recall 20120912.1292100\nListeriosis - USA: (NJ), perinatal 20120316.1072439\n2011\n----\nListeriosis, fatal - USA (14): cantaloupe, more cases & deaths 20111105.3290\nListeriosis, fatal - USA (13): cantaloupe, more cases & deaths 20111026.3188\nListeriosis, fatal - USA (12): cantaloupe 20111022.3144\nListeriosis, fatal - USA (11): cantaloupe, farm factors 20111020.3130\nListeriosis, fatal - USA (10): cantaloupe, more cases & deaths 20111008.3022\nListeriosis, fatal - USA (09): cantaloupe, more cases & deaths 20111005.2993\nListeriosis - USA: romaine lettuce, recall 20111001.2959\nListeriosis, fatal - USA (08): background 20111001.2958\nListeriosis, fatal - USA (07): cantaloupe, more cases & deaths 20110930.2950\nListeriosis, fatal - USA (06): cantaloupe, more cases & deaths 20110923.2876\nListeriosis, fatal - USA (05): cantaloupe, more cases & deaths 20110922.2871\nListeriosis, fatal - USA (04): cantaloupe, alert 20110921.2866\nListeriosis, fatal - USA (03) 20110914.2800\nListeriosis, fatal - USA (02): (CO) 20110909.2746\nListeriosis, fatal - USA: (CO) 20110605.1719\n.................................................sb/ml/je/ml", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "listeriosis", "meningitis"], "syndromes": ["meningitis"], "event_date": ["2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2014-03-16 00:00:00", "2014-03-16 00:00:00", "2014-12-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-19 00:00:00", "2014-12-16 00:00:00", "2014-03-16 00:00:00", "2014-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-14 00:00:00", "2021-03-11 00:00:00", "2021-03-09 00:00:00", "2021-03-08 00:00:00", "2021-03-07 00:00:00", "2021-03-06 00:00:00", "2021-03-05 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Minnesota", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "USA", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Texas", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Utah", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Arizona", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "North Carolina", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Bosnia & Herzegovina", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "US", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "New Mexico", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Washington", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Missouri", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "MD", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "California", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Wisconsin", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "3129444", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Listeriosis - USA (03): (IL,MI) fatal, sprouts, investigation closed", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=3129444", "date": "2014-12-19 20:16:27", "main_text": "LISTERIOSIS - USA (04): FATAL, CARAMEL-COATED AND PRE-PACKAGED APPLES, ALERT\n****************************************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n[1]\nDate: Thu 18 Dec 2014\nSource: Food Poison Journal [edited]\nhttp://www.foodpoisonjournal.com/foodborne-illness-outbreaks/minnesota-health-agriculture-officials-investigate-listeria-outbreak-linked-to-caramel-apples/\n\n\nThe Minnesota Departments of Health and Agriculture are working with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the US Food and Drug Administration on a multi-state outbreak of listeriosis linked to eating caramel apples.\n\nFour people in Minnesota have become ill as part of this outbreak.

Although caramel apples are often a fall seasonal product, contaminated commercially produced, prepackaged caramel apples may still be for sale at grocery stores and other retailers nationwide or may be in consumers' homes.\n\nAs of [18 Dec 2014], a total of 28 people infected with the outbreak strains of _Listeria monocytogenes_ have been reported from 10 states. 26 ill people have been hospitalized. Among the 26 people hospitalized, 5 deaths have been reported. Listeriosis contributed to at least 4 of these deaths. 9 illnesses were pregnancy-related (occurred in a pregnant woman or her newborn infant). 3 invasive illnesses (meningitis) were among otherwise healthy children aged 5-15 years.\n\n[No miscarriages or fetal losses have been reported. Among people whose illnesses were not associated with a pregnancy, ages ranged from 7 to 92 years, with a median age of 64 years, and 32 percent were female.]\n\nTo date, 15 (83 percent) of the 18 ill people interviewed reported eating commercially produced, prepackaged caramel apples before becoming ill. At this time, no illnesses related to this outbreak have been linked to apples that are not caramel-coated and not prepackaged or to caramel candy. Investigators are working quickly to determine specific brands or types of commercially produced, prepackaged caramel apples that may be linked to illnesses and to identify the source of contamination.\n\nThis investigation is rapidly evolving, and new information will be provided as it becomes available.\n\nDNA \"fingerprinting\" is performed on _Listeria_ bacteria isolated from ill persons using techniques called pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and whole genome sequencing (WGS). WGS gives a more detailed DNA fingerprint than PFGE. Two outbreak clusters were identified by the PFGE technique, and _Listeria_ isolates within each cluster were found to be highly related by the WGS technique but distinct between the 2 clusters. CDC is investigating the 2 clusters together because one person was infected with both _Listeria_ strains simultaneously and also because illnesses in the 2 clusters have occurred during a similar time period and in similar regions of the country.\n\n[An Epi Curve (a chart showing the number of persons who were diagnosed each week) of the multistate outbreak of listeriosis linked to commercially produced, prepackaged caramel apples is available at http://www.cdc.gov/listeria/outbreaks/caramel-apples-12-14/epi.html.]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The US CDC has reported that to date a total of 28 people have developed listeriosis linked to eating commercially produced, prepackaged caramel apples, including those with other toppings such as nuts, chocolate or sprinkles (15 [83 percent] of the 18 ill people interviewed reported eating caramel apples before becoming ill).

Details of the contamination were not in the report, and Crave Brothers declined to comment.\n\nThe 5 people sickened told health department officials they had definitely or probably eaten 1 of 3 varieties of Crave soft-ripened cheese. 3 of the people had purchased the cheese at 3 different restaurants, and 2 had purchased it at 2 different grocery stores. The cheeses were shipped as intact wheels to the restaurants and stores, where they had been cut and served or cut and repackaged and sold to customers, according to the CDC report.\n\nLaboratory tests conducted by the Minnesota Department of Agriculture on samples of the cheeses from 2 retail stores indicated the presence of the outbreak strain [of] _Listeria monocytogenes_.\n\nListeria infections are among the 3 most deadly foodborne bacteria after toxoplasmosis and salmonellosis.\n\nCrave Brothers issued voluntary product recalls 2 days after it halted production of the 3 cheeses.

They ranged in age from 31 to 67 years old, according to the Food and Drug Administration.\n\nThe company has not been fined, and checks of court records haven't revealed lawsuits.

The death was in Minnesota, while illnesses from _Listeria monocytogenes_ were reported in Minnesota, Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio, according to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), according to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.\n\n3 Crave Brothers pasteurized soft cheeses were the subject of a nationwide recall as a result of the outbreak: Les Freres, Petit Frere, and Petit Frere with truffles.

Infection results in diarrhea and, in some patients, invasive disease that includes bacteremia without an evident focus, meningitis, abscesses in the brain and spinal cord, endocarditis, and intrauterine infection. Infection during pregnancy can lead to premature delivery, infection of the newborn, or stillbirth. Invasive listeriosis is rare (about 2500 cases occur annually in the USA), but the disease has an overall mortality rate of 20 to 30 percent. Newborns, pregnant women, people 60 years of age or older, and those with compromised immune defenses (such as HIV-infected patients) are most susceptible to invasive disease.\n\nFood implicated in outbreaks has included raw milk, soft cheeses such as Latin-American cheeses, feta, brie, and Camembert, ice cream, raw vegetables and fruit, or consumption of ready-to-eat food that has been contaminated during processing of food, such as deli meat and delicatessen salads such as coleslaw, raw and smoked fish, shellfish such as shrimp, and undercooked chicken.\n\nWhen _L. monocytogenes_ get into a food-processing facility (such as, factories processing smoked fish, poultry, meat, and dairy products), they persist there for years and can contaminate food after factory cooking, but before packaging. Particularly problematic is the fact that _L. monocytogenes_ can grow in refrigeration temperatures during storage, which is why even minimal contamination with this bacterium during the processing of subsequently refrigerated ready-to-eat food can cause severe foodborne infections.\n\nNosocomial listeriosis has been described previously related to food service in healthcare facilities.

Infection during pregnancy can lead to premature delivery, infection of the newborn, or stillbirth.

Many of\nthe deaths involved elderly people, who are especially susceptible to\nthe aggressive pathogen.\n\nThe cantaloupes were grown by a Colorado company, Jensen Farms, which\nissued a recall earlier this month [September 2011]. The melons, a\ntype marketed as Rocky Ford cantaloupes, named after a region in\nColorado, were sold around the country.\n\nThe federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that\nsince the outbreak began in late July [2011] at least 72 people had\nfallen ill in 18 states. The agency said that 4 people had died in New\nMexico, 2 in Colorado, 2 in Texas, and one each in Kansas, Maryland,\nMissouri, Nebraska, and Oklahoma. The toll could grow as state health\nofficials wait for test results on other deaths suspected of being\npart of the outbreak.\n\nOfficials said that most of those who died were over age 60. At least\n2 were in their 90s. _Listeria_ is a common but dangerous bacterium\nthat can cause severe illness, especially among the elderly, the very\nyoung, and people with compromised immune systems. The pathogen can\nalso cause pregnant women to have miscarriages. Federal officials have\nso far provided no information about the number of miscarriages or\nstillbirths associated with the outbreak. Pregnant women are 20 times\nas likely as other healthy adults to come down with a severe\ninfection, according to the CDC.\n\nJohn N Sofos, a professor of food safety at Colorado State University,\nsaid that many people who were infected might have only mild symptoms,\nlike diarrhea. But in others, especially those in the most vulnerable\ncategories, the bacteria can aggressively move out of the\ngastrointestinal tract and attack muscle tissue or the spinal cord,\nleading to much more severe illnesses like meningitis. For that\nreason, the death rate in listeriosis outbreaks is often much higher\nthan with other forms of foodborne bacteria.\n\nWilliam Marler, a Seattle lawyer who represents victims of foodborne\nillness, said this outbreak might turn out to be especially deadly\nsimply because cantaloupe is a food eaten by many older people.\nSometimes in outbreaks, it's the population that's consuming the food\nthat drives the numbers, Mr Marler said. In this instance, you've got\na lot of people 60 and older who are consuming cantaloupe.\n\nThe outbreak appeared to be the 3rd worst in the United States\nattributed to any form of foodborne illness, in terms of the number of\ndeaths, since the CDC began regularly tracking such outbreaks in the\nearly 1970s. The deadliest outbreak in the United States since then\noccurred in 1985, when a wave of listeriosis, linked to Mexican-style\nfresh cheese, swept through California. A federal database says 52\ndeaths were attributed to the outbreak, but news reports at the time\nput the number as high as 84.\n\nThe 2nd deadliest outbreak was in 1998 and 1999, when there were at\nleast 14 deaths and 4 miscarriages or stillbirths in a listeriosis\noutbreak linked to hot dogs and delicatessen meats. Some sources put\nthe death toll in that outbreak as high as 21.\n\nWith the updated death toll on Tuesday [27 Sep 2011], the Rocky Ford\ncantaloupe outbreak surpassed the 2008 deaths associated with\nsalmonella-tainted peanuts and peanut butter produced by a Georgia\ncompany, the Peanut Corporation of America. That outbreak, which drew\na large amount of news coverage, killed 9 people and sickened more\nthan 700.\n\nThe huge outbreak this year [2011] in Europe of a rare form of _E.\ncoli_ bacteria attributed to fenugreek sprouts killed at least 50\npeople.\n\n_Listeria_ is a common bacterium that can be found in soil, water,\ndecaying plant matter, and manure. A strain of the organism, called\n_Listeria monocytogenes_, was first found to cause illness linked to\nfood in the early 1980s. Since then, only a handful of listeriosis\noutbreaks have been associated with fresh fruits and vegetables. The\nmajority was caused by tainted meat or dairy products.\n\nIt can take more than 2 months for a person exposed to the bacteria to\nfall ill, which means that it is often difficult to identify a food\nthat carried the pathogen. Unlike some other bacteria, _Listeria_ also\ngrows well at low temperatures, meaning it can be difficult to\neliminate from refrigerated areas used to process or store foods.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration said it had found the strain of the\nbacterium on melons and on equipment in the Colorado farm's\npackinghouse. It also found the bacteria on melons in a Denver-area\nstore. Investigators have not said how they believe the contamination\noccurred.\n\nThe FDA recommends that consumers rinse all raw produce, including\ncantaloupes, under running water. Firm produce, like melons, should be\nscrubbed with a produce brush. The washed produce should be dried with\na clean cloth or unused paper towel, the agency said.\n\n[Byline: William Neuman]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[2]\nDate: Wed 28 Sep 2011\nSource: KKTV [edited]\nhttp://www.kktv.com/home/headlines/D70_Takes_Cantaloupe_Off_Menu_Due_To_Listeria_Scare_129834148.html\n\n\nDr Thomas Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention, said Wednesday [28 Sep 2011] during a conference call with\nmedia that 2 pregnant women were among the 72 confirmed cases of\n_Listeria_ infection linked to cantaloupes grown in Colorado. He also\nconfirmed that this was the deadliest outbreak in more than a decade.\n\nBoth of the pregnant women and their fetuses are expected to be fine,\nbut 13 people have died from the infection. 3 more deaths are also\nsuspected to be connected, but are not yet confirmed by laboratory\ntests.\n\nThe CDC says _Listeria_ infection during pregnancy could lead to\npremature delivery, miscarriage, stillbirth, and other serious health\nproblems.\n\nThe CDC also said that the number of cases and deaths are likely to\nincrease, because symptoms of _Listeria_ infections can develop up to\n2 months after consumption of the contaminated food.\n\nThe _Listeria_ infections were reported in 18 states.\n\nIn this case, laboratory tests have connected the strains of\n_Listeria_ to melons of the \"Rocky Ford\" variety grown by Jensen Farms\nin Holly, Colorado. That particular variety is prized for having a\nhigher sugar contact, and was developed in the Rocky Ford region of\nColorado during the late 1800's.\n\nThe state of Colorado says it has tested melon samples from the\nrefrigerator of a listeriosis patient's home, as well as samples\nobtained from various retail outlets. They were also traced to Jensen\nFarms.\n\nJensen Farms has voluntarily recalled the melons in question, which it\nsays were shipped between 29 Jul and 10 Sep 2011.

Many of\nthe deaths involved elderly people, who are especially susceptible to\nthe aggressive pathogen.\n\nThe cantaloupes were grown by a Colorado company, Jensen Farms, which\nissued a recall earlier this month [September 2011]. The melons, a\ntype marketed as Rocky Ford cantaloupes, named after a region in\nColorado, were sold around the country.\n\nThe federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that\nsince the outbreak began in late July [2011] at least 72 people had\nfallen ill in 18 states. The agency said that 4 people had died in New\nMexico, 2 in Colorado, 2 in Texas, and one each in Kansas, Maryland,\nMissouri, Nebraska, and Oklahoma. The toll could grow as state health\nofficials wait for test results on other deaths suspected of being\npart of the outbreak.\n\nOfficials said that most of those who died were over age 60. At least\n2 were in their 90s. _Listeria_ is a common but dangerous bacterium\nthat can cause severe illness, especially among the elderly, the very\nyoung, and people with compromised immune systems. The pathogen can\nalso cause pregnant women to have miscarriages. Federal officials have\nso far provided no information about the number of miscarriages or\nstillbirths associated with the outbreak. Pregnant women are 20 times\nas likely as other healthy adults to come down with a severe\ninfection, according to the CDC.\n\nJohn N Sofos, a professor of food safety at Colorado State University,\nsaid that many people who were infected might have only mild symptoms,\nlike diarrhea. But in others, especially those in the most vulnerable\ncategories, the bacteria can aggressively move out of the\ngastrointestinal tract and attack muscle tissue or the spinal cord,\nleading to much more severe illnesses like meningitis. For that\nreason, the death rate in listeriosis outbreaks is often much higher\nthan with other forms of foodborne bacteria.\n\nWilliam Marler, a Seattle lawyer who represents victims of foodborne\nillness, said this outbreak might turn out to be especially deadly\nsimply because cantaloupe is a food eaten by many older people.\nSometimes in outbreaks, it's the population that's consuming the food\nthat drives the numbers, Mr Marler said. In this instance, you've got\na lot of people 60 and older who are consuming cantaloupe.\n\nThe outbreak appeared to be the 3rd worst in the United States\nattributed to any form of foodborne illness, in terms of the number of\ndeaths, since the CDC began regularly tracking such outbreaks in the\nearly 1970s. The deadliest outbreak in the United States since then\noccurred in 1985, when a wave of listeriosis, linked to Mexican-style\nfresh cheese, swept through California. A federal database says 52\ndeaths were attributed to the outbreak, but news reports at the time\nput the number as high as 84.\n\nThe 2nd deadliest outbreak was in 1998 and 1999, when there were at\nleast 14 deaths and 4 miscarriages or stillbirths in a listeriosis\noutbreak linked to hot dogs and delicatessen meats. Some sources put\nthe death toll in that outbreak as high as 21.\n\nWith the updated death toll on Tuesday [27 Sep 2011], the Rocky Ford\ncantaloupe outbreak surpassed the 2008 deaths associated with\nsalmonella-tainted peanuts and peanut butter produced by a Georgia\ncompany, the Peanut Corporation of America. That outbreak, which drew\na large amount of news coverage, killed 9 people and sickened more\nthan 700.\n\nThe huge outbreak this year [2011] in Europe of a rare form of _E.\ncoli_ bacteria attributed to fenugreek sprouts killed at least 50\npeople.\n\n_Listeria_ is a common bacterium that can be found in soil, water,\ndecaying plant matter, and manure. A strain of the organism, called\n_Listeria monocytogenes_, was first found to cause illness linked to\nfood in the early 1980s. Since then, only a handful of listeriosis\noutbreaks have been associated with fresh fruits and vegetables. The\nmajority was caused by tainted meat or dairy products.\n\nIt can take more than 2 months for a person exposed to the bacteria to\nfall ill, which means that it is often difficult to identify a food\nthat carried the pathogen. Unlike some other bacteria, _Listeria_ also\ngrows well at low temperatures, meaning it can be difficult to\neliminate from refrigerated areas used to process or store foods.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration said it had found the strain of the\nbacterium on melons and on equipment in the Colorado farm's\npackinghouse. It also found the bacteria on melons in a Denver-area\nstore. Investigators have not said how they believe the contamination\noccurred.\n\nThe FDA recommends that consumers rinse all raw produce, including\ncantaloupes, under running water. Firm produce, like melons, should be\nscrubbed with a produce brush. The washed produce should be dried with\na clean cloth or unused paper towel, the agency said.\n\n[Byline: William Neuman]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[2]\nDate: Wed 28 Sep 2011\nSource: KKTV [edited]\nhttp://www.kktv.com/home/headlines/D70_Takes_Cantaloupe_Off_Menu_Due_To_Listeria_Scare_129834148.html\n\n\nDr Thomas Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention, said Wednesday [28 Sep 2011] during a conference call with\nmedia that 2 pregnant women were among the 72 confirmed cases of\n_Listeria_ infection linked to cantaloupes grown in Colorado. He also\nconfirmed that this was the deadliest outbreak in more than a decade.\n\nBoth of the pregnant women and their fetuses are expected to be fine,\nbut 13 people have died from the infection. 3 more deaths are also\nsuspected to be connected, but are not yet confirmed by laboratory\ntests.\n\nThe CDC says _Listeria_ infection during pregnancy could lead to\npremature delivery, miscarriage, stillbirth, and other serious health\nproblems.\n\nThe CDC also said that the number of cases and deaths are likely to\nincrease, because symptoms of _Listeria_ infections can develop up to\n2 months after consumption of the contaminated food.\n\nThe _Listeria_ infections were reported in 18 states.\n\nIn this case, laboratory tests have connected the strains of\n_Listeria_ to melons of the \"Rocky Ford\" variety grown by Jensen Farms\nin Holly, Colorado. That particular variety is prized for having a\nhigher sugar contact, and was developed in the Rocky Ford region of\nColorado during the late 1800's.\n\nThe state of Colorado says it has tested melon samples from the\nrefrigerator of a listeriosis patient's home, as well as samples\nobtained from various retail outlets. They were also traced to Jensen\nFarms.\n\nJensen Farms has voluntarily recalled the melons in question, which it\nsays were shipped between 29 Jul and 10 Sep 2011. They were sent to\nIllinois, Wyoming, Tennessee, Utah, Texas, Colorado, Minnesota,\nKansas, New Mexico, North Carolina, Missouri, Nebraska, Oklahoma,\nArizona, New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania.\n\nThey carry stickers that say either, \"Product of USA - Frontera\nProduce - Colorado Fresh - Rocky Ford\" or \"Jensen Farms - Sweet Rocky\nFords.\"\n\nAnyone who has, or may have had cantaloupes from Jensen Farms is\nadvised to throw them away.

Many of\nthe deaths involved elderly people, who are especially susceptible to\nthe aggressive pathogen.\n\nThe cantaloupes were grown by a Colorado company, Jensen Farms, which\nissued a recall earlier this month [September 2011]. The melons, a\ntype marketed as Rocky Ford cantaloupes, named after a region in\nColorado, were sold around the country.\n\nThe federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that\nsince the outbreak began in late July [2011] at least 72 people had\nfallen ill in 18 states. The agency said that 4 people had died in New\nMexico, 2 in Colorado, 2 in Texas, and one each in Kansas, Maryland,\nMissouri, Nebraska, and Oklahoma. The toll could grow as state health\nofficials wait for test results on other deaths suspected of being\npart of the outbreak.\n\nOfficials said that most of those who died were over age 60. At least\n2 were in their 90s. _Listeria_ is a common but dangerous bacterium\nthat can cause severe illness, especially among the elderly, the very\nyoung, and people with compromised immune systems. The pathogen can\nalso cause pregnant women to have miscarriages. Federal officials have\nso far provided no information about the number of miscarriages or\nstillbirths associated with the outbreak. Pregnant women are 20 times\nas likely as other healthy adults to come down with a severe\ninfection, according to the CDC.\n\nJohn N Sofos, a professor of food safety at Colorado State University,\nsaid that many people who were infected might have only mild symptoms,\nlike diarrhea. But in others, especially those in the most vulnerable\ncategories, the bacteria can aggressively move out of the\ngastrointestinal tract and attack muscle tissue or the spinal cord,\nleading to much more severe illnesses like meningitis. For that\nreason, the death rate in listeriosis outbreaks is often much higher\nthan with other forms of foodborne bacteria.\n\nWilliam Marler, a Seattle lawyer who represents victims of foodborne\nillness, said this outbreak might turn out to be especially deadly\nsimply because cantaloupe is a food eaten by many older people.\nSometimes in outbreaks, it's the population that's consuming the food\nthat drives the numbers, Mr Marler said. In this instance, you've got\na lot of people 60 and older who are consuming cantaloupe.\n\nThe outbreak appeared to be the 3rd worst in the United States\nattributed to any form of foodborne illness, in terms of the number of\ndeaths, since the CDC began regularly tracking such outbreaks in the\nearly 1970s. The deadliest outbreak in the United States since then\noccurred in 1985, when a wave of listeriosis, linked to Mexican-style\nfresh cheese, swept through California. A federal database says 52\ndeaths were attributed to the outbreak, but news reports at the time\nput the number as high as 84.\n\nThe 2nd deadliest outbreak was in 1998 and 1999, when there were at\nleast 14 deaths and 4 miscarriages or stillbirths in a listeriosis\noutbreak linked to hot dogs and delicatessen meats. Some sources put\nthe death toll in that outbreak as high as 21.\n\nWith the updated death toll on Tuesday [27 Sep 2011], the Rocky Ford\ncantaloupe outbreak surpassed the 2008 deaths associated with\nsalmonella-tainted peanuts and peanut butter produced by a Georgia\ncompany, the Peanut Corporation of America. That outbreak, which drew\na large amount of news coverage, killed 9 people and sickened more\nthan 700.\n\nThe huge outbreak this year [2011] in Europe of a rare form of _E.\ncoli_ bacteria attributed to fenugreek sprouts killed at least 50\npeople.\n\n_Listeria_ is a common bacterium that can be found in soil, water,\ndecaying plant matter, and manure. A strain of the organism, called\n_Listeria monocytogenes_, was first found to cause illness linked to\nfood in the early 1980s. Since then, only a handful of listeriosis\noutbreaks have been associated with fresh fruits and vegetables. The\nmajority was caused by tainted meat or dairy products.\n\nIt can take more than 2 months for a person exposed to the bacteria to\nfall ill, which means that it is often difficult to identify a food\nthat carried the pathogen. Unlike some other bacteria, _Listeria_ also\ngrows well at low temperatures, meaning it can be difficult to\neliminate from refrigerated areas used to process or store foods.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration said it had found the strain of the\nbacterium on melons and on equipment in the Colorado farm's\npackinghouse. It also found the bacteria on melons in a Denver-area\nstore. Investigators have not said how they believe the contamination\noccurred.\n\nThe FDA recommends that consumers rinse all raw produce, including\ncantaloupes, under running water. Firm produce, like melons, should be\nscrubbed with a produce brush. The washed produce should be dried with\na clean cloth or unused paper towel, the agency said.\n\n[Byline: William Neuman]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[2]\nDate: Wed 28 Sep 2011\nSource: KKTV [edited]\nhttp://www.kktv.com/home/headlines/D70_Takes_Cantaloupe_Off_Menu_Due_To_Listeria_Scare_129834148.html\n\n\nDr Thomas Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention, said Wednesday [28 Sep 2011] during a conference call with\nmedia that 2 pregnant women were among the 72 confirmed cases of\n_Listeria_ infection linked to cantaloupes grown in Colorado. He also\nconfirmed that this was the deadliest outbreak in more than a decade.\n\nBoth of the pregnant women and their fetuses are expected to be fine,\nbut 13 people have died from the infection. 3 more deaths are also\nsuspected to be connected, but are not yet confirmed by laboratory\ntests.\n\nThe CDC says _Listeria_ infection during pregnancy could lead to\npremature delivery, miscarriage, stillbirth, and other serious health\nproblems.\n\nThe CDC also said that the number of cases and deaths are likely to\nincrease, because symptoms of _Listeria_ infections can develop up to\n2 months after consumption of the contaminated food.\n\nThe _Listeria_ infections were reported in 18 states.\n\nIn this case, laboratory tests have connected the strains of\n_Listeria_ to melons of the \"Rocky Ford\" variety grown by Jensen Farms\nin Holly, Colorado. That particular variety is prized for having a\nhigher sugar contact, and was developed in the Rocky Ford region of\nColorado during the late 1800's.\n\nThe state of Colorado says it has tested melon samples from the\nrefrigerator of a listeriosis patient's home, as well as samples\nobtained from various retail outlets. They were also traced to Jensen\nFarms.\n\nJensen Farms has voluntarily recalled the melons in question, which it\nsays were shipped between 29 Jul and 10 Sep 2011. They were sent to\nIllinois, Wyoming, Tennessee, Utah, Texas, Colorado, Minnesota,\nKansas, New Mexico, North Carolina, Missouri, Nebraska, Oklahoma,\nArizona, New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania.\n\nThey carry stickers that say either, \"Product of USA - Frontera\nProduce - Colorado Fresh - Rocky Ford\" or \"Jensen Farms - Sweet Rocky\nFords.\"\n\nAnyone who has, or may have had cantaloupes from Jensen Farms is\nadvised to throw them away. Do not try to clean the melons.\n\nAdditionally, the CDC warned that _Listeria_ can continue to grow --\neven inside a refrigerator. Caution is advised for everyone who may\nhave had one of the recalled melons, but specifically for people who\nare at high risk.\n\nThe FDA, also represented during Wednesday's [28 Sep 2011] conference\ncall, said this is the 1st known outbreak of listeriosis related to\ncantaloupe. The 10 cantaloupe-related outbreaks in the past decade\nwere connected to salmonella or a virus.\n\nThe worst outbreak of listeriosis on record was in 1985 and traced\nback to Mexican-style cheese.\n\nThe FDA says it has a team working with a team from Colorado to do an\nenvironmental assessment at Jensen Farm's facilities. As part of that\nwork, they're looking at potential contamination from animals, water,\nand the processing facility. So far, they've not reached any\nconclusions.\n\nA couple from Colorado Springs is suing the farm and Walmart because\nof the tainted fruit. According to the lawsuit, obtained by 11 News,\nthey are alleging that a cantaloupe distributed by Jensen Farms and\nsold at a Walmart on Razorback Road in the Springs caused [the man] to\nfall ill with listeriosis. [He] has been hospitalized since 31 Aug\n2011.\n\nIn the lawsuit, the couple claims that the cantaloupe was contaminated\nwith _Listeria_ at the time it was sold, and is directly responsible\nfor [his] illness. They say Jensen Farms and Walmart are both liable\nfor having sold \"food which was defective and not reasonably safe.\"\n\nIf you have questions about listeriosis, call the Colorado Department\nof Public Health and Environment at 1-877-462-2911.\n\nAnyone with questions about the recall can contact Jensen Farms at\n1-800-267-4561 or recall@rfordcantaloupe.com.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[3]\nDate: Wed 28 Sep 2011\nSource: Los Angeles Times [edited]\nhttp://latimesblogs.latimes.com/nationnow/2011/09/listeria-outbreak-linked-to-cantaloupes-could-worsen.html\n\n\nIf in doubt, throw it out. Unless you can be sure of the source of\nthat cantaloupe in your kitchen, it's best to toss it. That's the word\nfrom the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which is\ntrying to put a lid on one of the worst listeriosis outbreaks in US\nhistory.\n\nSo far, there are 72 reported cases of listeriosis linked to tainted\ncantaloupes, and 13 deaths. State and local officials say they are\ninvestigating 3 additional deaths that may be connected and the toll\ncould rise, according to the Associated Press.\n\nThe tainted melons that triggered the multi-state listeriosis outbreak\nhave been traced to Jensen Farms in Granada, Colorado.\n\n\"If it's not Jensen farms, it's okay to eat,\" Dr Thomas Frieden, CDC\ndirector, said in a media conference call today [28 Sep 2011]. \"But if\nyou can't confirm that it's not Jensen farms, then it's best to throw\nit out.\"\n\nSome of the cantaloupes were exported out of the country, and the CDC\nhas been issuing recalls both inside and outside the US for all the\naffected melons.\n\nThis outbreak is the largest in a decade and could grow worse, said\nthe CDC's foodborne illness specialist, Dr Barbara Mahon, who also\nparticipated in the media alert. \"To date there's 72 cases and 13\ndeaths... We do expect that the number of cases will increase.\"\n\nThe single largest listeriosis outbreak occurred in 1985, and was\ntraced to soft Mexican-style cheese manufactured by Jalisco Mexican\nProducts Inc. of Artesia. It killed at least 40 people, and also ranks\nas one of the biggest food-contamination cases in California history.\n\nCantaloupes can rot within 2 weeks or so, and go bad even faster once\nthey've been sliced open. The cantaloupes at the center of this\noutbreak -- first flagged on 12 Sep 2011 -- are nearing the outer edge\nof their shelf life, making it less likely they will be eaten with\neach passing day.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Cantaloupes are said to have a shelf life of 2 weeks or so.

Pregnant women are 20 times\nas likely as other healthy adults to come down with a severe\ninfection, according to the CDC.\n\nJohn N Sofos, a professor of food safety at Colorado State University,\nsaid that many people who were infected might have only mild symptoms,\nlike diarrhea. But in others, especially those in the most vulnerable\ncategories, the bacteria can aggressively move out of the\ngastrointestinal tract and attack muscle tissue or the spinal cord,\nleading to much more severe illnesses like meningitis. For that\nreason, the death rate in listeriosis outbreaks is often much higher\nthan with other forms of foodborne bacteria.\n\nWilliam Marler, a Seattle lawyer who represents victims of foodborne\nillness, said this outbreak might turn out to be especially deadly\nsimply because cantaloupe is a food eaten by many older people.\nSometimes in outbreaks, it's the population that's consuming the food\nthat drives the numbers, Mr Marler said. In this instance, you've got\na lot of people 60 and older who are consuming cantaloupe.\n\nThe outbreak appeared to be the 3rd worst in the United States\nattributed to any form of foodborne illness, in terms of the number of\ndeaths, since the CDC began regularly tracking such outbreaks in the\nearly 1970s. The deadliest outbreak in the United States since then\noccurred in 1985, when a wave of listeriosis, linked to Mexican-style\nfresh cheese, swept through California. A federal database says 52\ndeaths were attributed to the outbreak, but news reports at the time\nput the number as high as 84.\n\nThe 2nd deadliest outbreak was in 1998 and 1999, when there were at\nleast 14 deaths and 4 miscarriages or stillbirths in a listeriosis\noutbreak linked to hot dogs and delicatessen meats. Some sources put\nthe death toll in that outbreak as high as 21.\n\nWith the updated death toll on Tuesday [27 Sep 2011], the Rocky Ford\ncantaloupe outbreak surpassed the 2008 deaths associated with\nsalmonella-tainted peanuts and peanut butter produced by a Georgia\ncompany, the Peanut Corporation of America. That outbreak, which drew\na large amount of news coverage, killed 9 people and sickened more\nthan 700.\n\nThe huge outbreak this year [2011] in Europe of a rare form of _E.\ncoli_ bacteria attributed to fenugreek sprouts killed at least 50\npeople.\n\n_Listeria_ is a common bacterium that can be found in soil, water,\ndecaying plant matter, and manure. A strain of the organism, called\n_Listeria monocytogenes_, was first found to cause illness linked to\nfood in the early 1980s. Since then, only a handful of listeriosis\noutbreaks have been associated with fresh fruits and vegetables. The\nmajority was caused by tainted meat or dairy products.\n\nIt can take more than 2 months for a person exposed to the bacteria to\nfall ill, which means that it is often difficult to identify a food\nthat carried the pathogen. Unlike some other bacteria, _Listeria_ also\ngrows well at low temperatures, meaning it can be difficult to\neliminate from refrigerated areas used to process or store foods.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration said it had found the strain of the\nbacterium on melons and on equipment in the Colorado farm's\npackinghouse. It also found the bacteria on melons in a Denver-area\nstore. Investigators have not said how they believe the contamination\noccurred.\n\nThe FDA recommends that consumers rinse all raw produce, including\ncantaloupes, under running water. Firm produce, like melons, should be\nscrubbed with a produce brush. The washed produce should be dried with\na clean cloth or unused paper towel, the agency said.\n\n[Byline: William Neuman]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[2]\nDate: Wed 28 Sep 2011\nSource: KKTV [edited]\nhttp://www.kktv.com/home/headlines/D70_Takes_Cantaloupe_Off_Menu_Due_To_Listeria_Scare_129834148.html\n\n\nDr Thomas Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention, said Wednesday [28 Sep 2011] during a conference call with\nmedia that 2 pregnant women were among the 72 confirmed cases of\n_Listeria_ infection linked to cantaloupes grown in Colorado.

Many of\nthe deaths involved elderly people, who are especially susceptible to\nthe aggressive pathogen.\n\nThe cantaloupes were grown by a Colorado company, Jensen Farms, which\nissued a recall earlier this month [September 2011]. The melons, a\ntype marketed as Rocky Ford cantaloupes, named after a region in\nColorado, were sold around the country.\n\nThe federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that\nsince the outbreak began in late July [2011] at least 72 people had\nfallen ill in 18 states. The agency said that 4 people had died in New\nMexico, 2 in Colorado, 2 in Texas, and one each in Kansas, Maryland,\nMissouri, Nebraska, and Oklahoma. The toll could grow as state health\nofficials wait for test results on other deaths suspected of being\npart of the outbreak.\n\nOfficials said that most of those who died were over age 60. At least\n2 were in their 90s. _Listeria_ is a common but dangerous bacterium\nthat can cause severe illness, especially among the elderly, the very\nyoung, and people with compromised immune systems. The pathogen can\nalso cause pregnant women to have miscarriages. Federal officials have\nso far provided no information about the number of miscarriages or\nstillbirths associated with the outbreak. Pregnant women are 20 times\nas likely as other healthy adults to come down with a severe\ninfection, according to the CDC.\n\nJohn N Sofos, a professor of food safety at Colorado State University,\nsaid that many people who were infected might have only mild symptoms,\nlike diarrhea. But in others, especially those in the most vulnerable\ncategories, the bacteria can aggressively move out of the\ngastrointestinal tract and attack muscle tissue or the spinal cord,\nleading to much more severe illnesses like meningitis. For that\nreason, the death rate in listeriosis outbreaks is often much higher\nthan with other forms of foodborne bacteria.\n\nWilliam Marler, a Seattle lawyer who represents victims of foodborne\nillness, said this outbreak might turn out to be especially deadly\nsimply because cantaloupe is a food eaten by many older people.\nSometimes in outbreaks, it's the population that's consuming the food\nthat drives the numbers, Mr Marler said. In this instance, you've got\na lot of people 60 and older who are consuming cantaloupe.\n\nThe outbreak appeared to be the 3rd worst in the United States\nattributed to any form of foodborne illness, in terms of the number of\ndeaths, since the CDC began regularly tracking such outbreaks in the\nearly 1970s. The deadliest outbreak in the United States since then\noccurred in 1985, when a wave of listeriosis, linked to Mexican-style\nfresh cheese, swept through California. A federal database says 52\ndeaths were attributed to the outbreak, but news reports at the time\nput the number as high as 84.\n\nThe 2nd deadliest outbreak was in 1998 and 1999, when there were at\nleast 14 deaths and 4 miscarriages or stillbirths in a listeriosis\noutbreak linked to hot dogs and delicatessen meats. Some sources put\nthe death toll in that outbreak as high as 21.\n\nWith the updated death toll on Tuesday [27 Sep 2011], the Rocky Ford\ncantaloupe outbreak surpassed the 2008 deaths associated with\nsalmonella-tainted peanuts and peanut butter produced by a Georgia\ncompany, the Peanut Corporation of America. That outbreak, which drew\na large amount of news coverage, killed 9 people and sickened more\nthan 700.\n\nThe huge outbreak this year [2011] in Europe of a rare form of _E.\ncoli_ bacteria attributed to fenugreek sprouts killed at least 50\npeople.\n\n_Listeria_ is a common bacterium that can be found in soil, water,\ndecaying plant matter, and manure. A strain of the organism, called\n_Listeria monocytogenes_, was first found to cause illness linked to\nfood in the early 1980s. Since then, only a handful of listeriosis\noutbreaks have been associated with fresh fruits and vegetables. The\nmajority was caused by tainted meat or dairy products.\n\nIt can take more than 2 months for a person exposed to the bacteria to\nfall ill, which means that it is often difficult to identify a food\nthat carried the pathogen. Unlike some other bacteria, _Listeria_ also\ngrows well at low temperatures, meaning it can be difficult to\neliminate from refrigerated areas used to process or store foods.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration said it had found the strain of the\nbacterium on melons and on equipment in the Colorado farm's\npackinghouse. It also found the bacteria on melons in a Denver-area\nstore. Investigators have not said how they believe the contamination\noccurred.\n\nThe FDA recommends that consumers rinse all raw produce, including\ncantaloupes, under running water. Firm produce, like melons, should be\nscrubbed with a produce brush. The washed produce should be dried with\na clean cloth or unused paper towel, the agency said.\n\n[Byline: William Neuman]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[2]\nDate: Wed 28 Sep 2011\nSource: KKTV [edited]\nhttp://www.kktv.com/home/headlines/D70_Takes_Cantaloupe_Off_Menu_Due_To_Listeria_Scare_129834148.html\n\n\nDr Thomas Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention, said Wednesday [28 Sep 2011] during a conference call with\nmedia that 2 pregnant women were among the 72 confirmed cases of\n_Listeria_ infection linked to cantaloupes grown in Colorado. He also\nconfirmed that this was the deadliest outbreak in more than a decade.\n\nBoth of the pregnant women and their fetuses are expected to be fine,\nbut 13 people have died from the infection. 3 more deaths are also\nsuspected to be connected, but are not yet confirmed by laboratory\ntests.\n\nThe CDC says _Listeria_ infection during pregnancy could lead to\npremature delivery, miscarriage, stillbirth, and other serious health\nproblems.\n\nThe CDC also said that the number of cases and deaths are likely to\nincrease, because symptoms of _Listeria_ infections can develop up to\n2 months after consumption of the contaminated food.\n\nThe _Listeria_ infections were reported in 18 states.\n\nIn this case, laboratory tests have connected the strains of\n_Listeria_ to melons of the \"Rocky Ford\" variety grown by Jensen Farms\nin Holly, Colorado. That particular variety is prized for having a\nhigher sugar contact, and was developed in the Rocky Ford region of\nColorado during the late 1800's.\n\nThe state of Colorado says it has tested melon samples from the\nrefrigerator of a listeriosis patient's home, as well as samples\nobtained from various retail outlets. They were also traced to Jensen\nFarms.\n\nJensen Farms has voluntarily recalled the melons in question, which it\nsays were shipped between 29 Jul and 10 Sep 2011. They were sent to\nIllinois, Wyoming, Tennessee, Utah, Texas, Colorado, Minnesota,\nKansas, New Mexico, North Carolina, Missouri, Nebraska, Oklahoma,\nArizona, New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania.\n\nThey carry stickers that say either, \"Product of USA - Frontera\nProduce - Colorado Fresh - Rocky Ford\" or \"Jensen Farms - Sweet Rocky\nFords.\"\n\nAnyone who has, or may have had cantaloupes from Jensen Farms is\nadvised to throw them away. Do not try to clean the melons.\n\nAdditionally, the CDC warned that _Listeria_ can continue to grow --\neven inside a refrigerator. Caution is advised for everyone who may\nhave had one of the recalled melons, but specifically for people who\nare at high risk.\n\nThe FDA, also represented during Wednesday's [28 Sep 2011] conference\ncall, said this is the 1st known outbreak of listeriosis related to\ncantaloupe. The 10 cantaloupe-related outbreaks in the past decade\nwere connected to salmonella or a virus.\n\nThe worst outbreak of listeriosis on record was in 1985 and traced\nback to Mexican-style cheese.\n\nThe FDA says it has a team working with a team from Colorado to do an\nenvironmental assessment at Jensen Farm's facilities. As part of that\nwork, they're looking at potential contamination from animals, water,\nand the processing facility. So far, they've not reached any\nconclusions.\n\nA couple from Colorado Springs is suing the farm and Walmart because\nof the tainted fruit. According to the lawsuit, obtained by 11 News,\nthey are alleging that a cantaloupe distributed by Jensen Farms and\nsold at a Walmart on Razorback Road in the Springs caused [the man] to\nfall ill with listeriosis. [He] has been hospitalized since 31 Aug\n2011.\n\nIn the lawsuit, the couple claims that the cantaloupe was contaminated\nwith _Listeria_ at the time it was sold, and is directly responsible\nfor [his] illness. They say Jensen Farms and Walmart are both liable\nfor having sold \"food which was defective and not reasonably safe.\"\n\nIf you have questions about listeriosis, call the Colorado Department\nof Public Health and Environment at 1-877-462-2911.\n\nAnyone with questions about the recall can contact Jensen Farms at\n1-800-267-4561 or recall@rfordcantaloupe.com.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[3]\nDate: Wed 28 Sep 2011\nSource: Los Angeles Times [edited]\nhttp://latimesblogs.latimes.com/nationnow/2011/09/listeria-outbreak-linked-to-cantaloupes-could-worsen.html\n\n\nIf in doubt, throw it out.

Many of\nthe deaths involved elderly people, who are especially susceptible to\nthe aggressive pathogen.\n\nThe cantaloupes were grown by a Colorado company, Jensen Farms, which\nissued a recall earlier this month [September 2011]. The melons, a\ntype marketed as Rocky Ford cantaloupes, named after a region in\nColorado, were sold around the country.\n\nThe federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that\nsince the outbreak began in late July [2011] at least 72 people had\nfallen ill in 18 states. The agency said that 4 people had died in New\nMexico, 2 in Colorado, 2 in Texas, and one each in Kansas, Maryland,\nMissouri, Nebraska, and Oklahoma. The toll could grow as state health\nofficials wait for test results on other deaths suspected of being\npart of the outbreak.\n\nOfficials said that most of those who died were over age 60. At least\n2 were in their 90s. _Listeria_ is a common but dangerous bacterium\nthat can cause severe illness, especially among the elderly, the very\nyoung, and people with compromised immune systems. The pathogen can\nalso cause pregnant women to have miscarriages. Federal officials have\nso far provided no information about the number of miscarriages or\nstillbirths associated with the outbreak. Pregnant women are 20 times\nas likely as other healthy adults to come down with a severe\ninfection, according to the CDC.\n\nJohn N Sofos, a professor of food safety at Colorado State University,\nsaid that many people who were infected might have only mild symptoms,\nlike diarrhea. But in others, especially those in the most vulnerable\ncategories, the bacteria can aggressively move out of the\ngastrointestinal tract and attack muscle tissue or the spinal cord,\nleading to much more severe illnesses like meningitis. For that\nreason, the death rate in listeriosis outbreaks is often much higher\nthan with other forms of foodborne bacteria.\n\nWilliam Marler, a Seattle lawyer who represents victims of foodborne\nillness, said this outbreak might turn out to be especially deadly\nsimply because cantaloupe is a food eaten by many older people.\nSometimes in outbreaks, it's the population that's consuming the food\nthat drives the numbers, Mr Marler said. In this instance, you've got\na lot of people 60 and older who are consuming cantaloupe.\n\nThe outbreak appeared to be the 3rd worst in the United States\nattributed to any form of foodborne illness, in terms of the number of\ndeaths, since the CDC began regularly tracking such outbreaks in the\nearly 1970s. The deadliest outbreak in the United States since then\noccurred in 1985, when a wave of listeriosis, linked to Mexican-style\nfresh cheese, swept through California. A federal database says 52\ndeaths were attributed to the outbreak, but news reports at the time\nput the number as high as 84.\n\nThe 2nd deadliest outbreak was in 1998 and 1999, when there were at\nleast 14 deaths and 4 miscarriages or stillbirths in a listeriosis\noutbreak linked to hot dogs and delicatessen meats. Some sources put\nthe death toll in that outbreak as high as 21.\n\nWith the updated death toll on Tuesday [27 Sep 2011], the Rocky Ford\ncantaloupe outbreak surpassed the 2008 deaths associated with\nsalmonella-tainted peanuts and peanut butter produced by a Georgia\ncompany, the Peanut Corporation of America. That outbreak, which drew\na large amount of news coverage, killed 9 people and sickened more\nthan 700.\n\nThe huge outbreak this year [2011] in Europe of a rare form of _E.\ncoli_ bacteria attributed to fenugreek sprouts killed at least 50\npeople.\n\n_Listeria_ is a common bacterium that can be found in soil, water,\ndecaying plant matter, and manure. A strain of the organism, called\n_Listeria monocytogenes_, was first found to cause illness linked to\nfood in the early 1980s. Since then, only a handful of listeriosis\noutbreaks have been associated with fresh fruits and vegetables. The\nmajority was caused by tainted meat or dairy products.\n\nIt can take more than 2 months for a person exposed to the bacteria to\nfall ill, which means that it is often difficult to identify a food\nthat carried the pathogen. Unlike some other bacteria, _Listeria_ also\ngrows well at low temperatures, meaning it can be difficult to\neliminate from refrigerated areas used to process or store foods.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration said it had found the strain of the\nbacterium on melons and on equipment in the Colorado farm's\npackinghouse. It also found the bacteria on melons in a Denver-area\nstore. Investigators have not said how they believe the contamination\noccurred.\n\nThe FDA recommends that consumers rinse all raw produce, including\ncantaloupes, under running water. Firm produce, like melons, should be\nscrubbed with a produce brush. The washed produce should be dried with\na clean cloth or unused paper towel, the agency said.\n\n[Byline: William Neuman]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[2]\nDate: Wed 28 Sep 2011\nSource: KKTV [edited]\nhttp://www.kktv.com/home/headlines/D70_Takes_Cantaloupe_Off_Menu_Due_To_Listeria_Scare_129834148.html\n\n\nDr Thomas Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention, said Wednesday [28 Sep 2011] during a conference call with\nmedia that 2 pregnant women were among the 72 confirmed cases of\n_Listeria_ infection linked to cantaloupes grown in Colorado. He also\nconfirmed that this was the deadliest outbreak in more than a decade.\n\nBoth of the pregnant women and their fetuses are expected to be fine,\nbut 13 people have died from the infection. 3 more deaths are also\nsuspected to be connected, but are not yet confirmed by laboratory\ntests.\n\nThe CDC says _Listeria_ infection during pregnancy could lead to\npremature delivery, miscarriage, stillbirth, and other serious health\nproblems.\n\nThe CDC also said that the number of cases and deaths are likely to\nincrease, because symptoms of _Listeria_ infections can develop up to\n2 months after consumption of the contaminated food.\n\nThe _Listeria_ infections were reported in 18 states.\n\nIn this case, laboratory tests have connected the strains of\n_Listeria_ to melons of the \"Rocky Ford\" variety grown by Jensen Farms\nin Holly, Colorado. That particular variety is prized for having a\nhigher sugar contact, and was developed in the Rocky Ford region of\nColorado during the late 1800's.\n\nThe state of Colorado says it has tested melon samples from the\nrefrigerator of a listeriosis patient's home, as well as samples\nobtained from various retail outlets. They were also traced to Jensen\nFarms.\n\nJensen Farms has voluntarily recalled the melons in question, which it\nsays were shipped between 29 Jul and 10 Sep 2011. They were sent to\nIllinois, Wyoming, Tennessee, Utah, Texas, Colorado, Minnesota,\nKansas, New Mexico, North Carolina, Missouri, Nebraska, Oklahoma,\nArizona, New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania.\n\nThey carry stickers that say either, \"Product of USA - Frontera\nProduce - Colorado Fresh - Rocky Ford\" or \"Jensen Farms - Sweet Rocky\nFords.\"\n\nAnyone who has, or may have had cantaloupes from Jensen Farms is\nadvised to throw them away. Do not try to clean the melons.\n\nAdditionally, the CDC warned that _Listeria_ can continue to grow --\neven inside a refrigerator. Caution is advised for everyone who may\nhave had one of the recalled melons, but specifically for people who\nare at high risk.\n\nThe FDA, also represented during Wednesday's [28 Sep 2011] conference\ncall, said this is the 1st known outbreak of listeriosis related to\ncantaloupe. The 10 cantaloupe-related outbreaks in the past decade\nwere connected to salmonella or a virus.\n\nThe worst outbreak of listeriosis on record was in 1985 and traced\nback to Mexican-style cheese.\n\nThe FDA says it has a team working with a team from Colorado to do an\nenvironmental assessment at Jensen Farm's facilities. As part of that\nwork, they're looking at potential contamination from animals, water,\nand the processing facility. So far, they've not reached any\nconclusions.\n\nA couple from Colorado Springs is suing the farm and Walmart because\nof the tainted fruit. According to the lawsuit, obtained by 11 News,\nthey are alleging that a cantaloupe distributed by Jensen Farms and\nsold at a Walmart on Razorback Road in the Springs caused [the man] to\nfall ill with listeriosis. [He] has been hospitalized since 31 Aug\n2011.\n\nIn the lawsuit, the couple claims that the cantaloupe was contaminated\nwith _Listeria_ at the time it was sold, and is directly responsible\nfor [his] illness. They say Jensen Farms and Walmart are both liable\nfor having sold \"food which was defective and not reasonably safe.\"\n\nIf you have questions about listeriosis, call the Colorado Department\nof Public Health and Environment at 1-877-462-2911.\n\nAnyone with questions about the recall can contact Jensen Farms at\n1-800-267-4561 or recall@rfordcantaloupe.com.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[3]\nDate: Wed 28 Sep 2011\nSource: Los Angeles Times [edited]\nhttp://latimesblogs.latimes.com/nationnow/2011/09/listeria-outbreak-linked-to-cantaloupes-could-worsen.html\n\n\nIf in doubt, throw it out. Unless you can be sure of the source of\nthat cantaloupe in your kitchen, it's best to toss it. That's the word\nfrom the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which is\ntrying to put a lid on one of the worst listeriosis outbreaks in US\nhistory.\n\nSo far, there are 72 reported cases of listeriosis linked to tainted\ncantaloupes, and 13 deaths. State and local officials say they are\ninvestigating 3 additional deaths that may be connected and the toll\ncould rise, according to the Associated Press.\n\nThe tainted melons that triggered the multi-state listeriosis outbreak\nhave been traced to Jensen Farms in Granada, Colorado.\n\n\"If it's not Jensen farms, it's okay to eat,\" Dr Thomas Frieden, CDC\ndirector, said in a media conference call today [28 Sep 2011]. \"But if\nyou can't confirm that it's not Jensen farms, then it's best to throw\nit out.\"\n\nSome of the cantaloupes were exported out of the country, and the CDC\nhas been issuing recalls both inside and outside the US for all the\naffected melons.\n\nThis outbreak is the largest in a decade and could grow worse, said\nthe CDC's foodborne illness specialist, Dr Barbara Mahon, who also\nparticipated in the media alert. \"To date there's 72 cases and 13\ndeaths... We do expect that the number of cases will increase.\"\n\nThe single largest listeriosis outbreak occurred in 1985, and was\ntraced to soft Mexican-style cheese manufactured by Jalisco Mexican\nProducts Inc. of Artesia. It killed at least 40 people, and also ranks\nas one of the biggest food-contamination cases in California history.\n\nCantaloupes can rot within 2 weeks or so, and go bad even faster once\nthey've been sliced open. The cantaloupes at the center of this\noutbreak -- first flagged on 12 Sep 2011 -- are nearing the outer edge\nof their shelf life, making it less likely they will be eaten with\neach passing day.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Cantaloupes are said to have a shelf life of 2 weeks or so.

Pregnant women are 20 times\nas likely as other healthy adults to come down with a severe\ninfection, according to the CDC.\n\nJohn N Sofos, a professor of food safety at Colorado State University,\nsaid that many people who were infected might have only mild symptoms,\nlike diarrhea. But in others, especially those in the most vulnerable\ncategories, the bacteria can aggressively move out of the\ngastrointestinal tract and attack muscle tissue or the spinal cord,\nleading to much more severe illnesses like meningitis. For that\nreason, the death rate in listeriosis outbreaks is often much higher\nthan with other forms of foodborne bacteria.\n\nWilliam Marler, a Seattle lawyer who represents victims of foodborne\nillness, said this outbreak might turn out to be especially deadly\nsimply because cantaloupe is a food eaten by many older people.\nSometimes in outbreaks, it's the population that's consuming the food\nthat drives the numbers, Mr Marler said. In this instance, you've got\na lot of people 60 and older who are consuming cantaloupe.\n\nThe outbreak appeared to be the 3rd worst in the United States\nattributed to any form of foodborne illness, in terms of the number of\ndeaths, since the CDC began regularly tracking such outbreaks in the\nearly 1970s. The deadliest outbreak in the United States since then\noccurred in 1985, when a wave of listeriosis, linked to Mexican-style\nfresh cheese, swept through California. A federal database says 52\ndeaths were attributed to the outbreak, but news reports at the time\nput the number as high as 84.\n\nThe 2nd deadliest outbreak was in 1998 and 1999, when there were at\nleast 14 deaths and 4 miscarriages or stillbirths in a listeriosis\noutbreak linked to hot dogs and delicatessen meats. Some sources put\nthe death toll in that outbreak as high as 21.\n\nWith the updated death toll on Tuesday [27 Sep 2011], the Rocky Ford\ncantaloupe outbreak surpassed the 2008 deaths associated with\nsalmonella-tainted peanuts and peanut butter produced by a Georgia\ncompany, the Peanut Corporation of America. That outbreak, which drew\na large amount of news coverage, killed 9 people and sickened more\nthan 700.\n\nThe huge outbreak this year [2011] in Europe of a rare form of _E.\ncoli_ bacteria attributed to fenugreek sprouts killed at least 50\npeople.\n\n_Listeria_ is a common bacterium that can be found in soil, water,\ndecaying plant matter, and manure. A strain of the organism, called\n_Listeria monocytogenes_, was first found to cause illness linked to\nfood in the early 1980s. Since then, only a handful of listeriosis\noutbreaks have been associated with fresh fruits and vegetables. The\nmajority was caused by tainted meat or dairy products.\n\nIt can take more than 2 months for a person exposed to the bacteria to\nfall ill, which means that it is often difficult to identify a food\nthat carried the pathogen. Unlike some other bacteria, _Listeria_ also\ngrows well at low temperatures, meaning it can be difficult to\neliminate from refrigerated areas used to process or store foods.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration said it had found the strain of the\nbacterium on melons and on equipment in the Colorado farm's\npackinghouse. It also found the bacteria on melons in a Denver-area\nstore. Investigators have not said how they believe the contamination\noccurred.\n\nThe FDA recommends that consumers rinse all raw produce, including\ncantaloupes, under running water. Firm produce, like melons, should be\nscrubbed with a produce brush. The washed produce should be dried with\na clean cloth or unused paper towel, the agency said.\n\n[Byline: William Neuman]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[2]\nDate: Wed 28 Sep 2011\nSource: KKTV [edited]\nhttp://www.kktv.com/home/headlines/D70_Takes_Cantaloupe_Off_Menu_Due_To_Listeria_Scare_129834148.html\n\n\nDr Thomas Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention, said Wednesday [28 Sep 2011] during a conference call with\nmedia that 2 pregnant women were among the 72 confirmed cases of\n_Listeria_ infection linked to cantaloupes grown in Colorado. He also\nconfirmed that this was the deadliest outbreak in more than a decade.\n\nBoth of the pregnant women and their fetuses are expected to be fine,\nbut 13 people have died from the infection. 3 more deaths are also\nsuspected to be connected, but are not yet confirmed by laboratory\ntests.\n\nThe CDC says _Listeria_ infection during pregnancy could lead to\npremature delivery, miscarriage, stillbirth, and other serious health\nproblems.\n\nThe CDC also said that the number of cases and deaths are likely to\nincrease, because symptoms of _Listeria_ infections can develop up to\n2 months after consumption of the contaminated food.\n\nThe _Listeria_ infections were reported in 18 states.\n\nIn this case, laboratory tests have connected the strains of\n_Listeria_ to melons of the \"Rocky Ford\" variety grown by Jensen Farms\nin Holly, Colorado. That particular variety is prized for having a\nhigher sugar contact, and was developed in the Rocky Ford region of\nColorado during the late 1800's.\n\nThe state of Colorado says it has tested melon samples from the\nrefrigerator of a listeriosis patient's home, as well as samples\nobtained from various retail outlets. They were also traced to Jensen\nFarms.\n\nJensen Farms has voluntarily recalled the melons in question, which it\nsays were shipped between 29 Jul and 10 Sep 2011. They were sent to\nIllinois, Wyoming, Tennessee, Utah, Texas, Colorado, Minnesota,\nKansas, New Mexico, North Carolina, Missouri, Nebraska, Oklahoma,\nArizona, New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania.\n\nThey carry stickers that say either, \"Product of USA - Frontera\nProduce - Colorado Fresh - Rocky Ford\" or \"Jensen Farms - Sweet Rocky\nFords.\"\n\nAnyone who has, or may have had cantaloupes from Jensen Farms is\nadvised to throw them away. Do not try to clean the melons.\n\nAdditionally, the CDC warned that _Listeria_ can continue to grow --\neven inside a refrigerator. Caution is advised for everyone who may\nhave had one of the recalled melons, but specifically for people who\nare at high risk.\n\nThe FDA, also represented during Wednesday's [28 Sep 2011] conference\ncall, said this is the 1st known outbreak of listeriosis related to\ncantaloupe. The 10 cantaloupe-related outbreaks in the past decade\nwere connected to salmonella or a virus.\n\nThe worst outbreak of listeriosis on record was in 1985 and traced\nback to Mexican-style cheese.\n\nThe FDA says it has a team working with a team from Colorado to do an\nenvironmental assessment at Jensen Farm's facilities. As part of that\nwork, they're looking at potential contamination from animals, water,\nand the processing facility. So far, they've not reached any\nconclusions.\n\nA couple from Colorado Springs is suing the farm and Walmart because\nof the tainted fruit. According to the lawsuit, obtained by 11 News,\nthey are alleging that a cantaloupe distributed by Jensen Farms and\nsold at a Walmart on Razorback Road in the Springs caused [the man] to\nfall ill with listeriosis. [He] has been hospitalized since 31 Aug\n2011.\n\nIn the lawsuit, the couple claims that the cantaloupe was contaminated\nwith _Listeria_ at the time it was sold, and is directly responsible\nfor [his] illness. They say Jensen Farms and Walmart are both liable\nfor having sold \"food which was defective and not reasonably safe.\"\n\nIf you have questions about listeriosis, call the Colorado Department\nof Public Health and Environment at 1-877-462-2911.\n\nAnyone with questions about the recall can contact Jensen Farms at\n1-800-267-4561 or recall@rfordcantaloupe.com.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[3]\nDate: Wed 28 Sep 2011\nSource: Los Angeles Times [edited]\nhttp://latimesblogs.latimes.com/nationnow/2011/09/listeria-outbreak-linked-to-cantaloupes-could-worsen.html\n\n\nIf in doubt, throw it out. Unless you can be sure of the source of\nthat cantaloupe in your kitchen, it's best to toss it. That's the word\nfrom the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which is\ntrying to put a lid on one of the worst listeriosis outbreaks in US\nhistory.\n\nSo far, there are 72 reported cases of listeriosis linked to tainted\ncantaloupes, and 13 deaths. State and local officials say they are\ninvestigating 3 additional deaths that may be connected and the toll\ncould rise, according to the Associated Press.\n\nThe tainted melons that triggered the multi-state listeriosis outbreak\nhave been traced to Jensen Farms in Granada, Colorado.\n\n\"If it's not Jensen farms, it's okay to eat,\" Dr Thomas Frieden, CDC\ndirector, said in a media conference call today [28 Sep 2011]. \"But if\nyou can't confirm that it's not Jensen farms, then it's best to throw\nit out.\"\n\nSome of the cantaloupes were exported out of the country, and the CDC\nhas been issuing recalls both inside and outside the US for all the\naffected melons.\n\nThis outbreak is the largest in a decade and could grow worse, said\nthe CDC's foodborne illness specialist, Dr Barbara Mahon, who also\nparticipated in the media alert. \"To date there's 72 cases and 13\ndeaths... We do expect that the number of cases will increase.\"\n\nThe single largest listeriosis outbreak occurred in 1985, and was\ntraced to soft Mexican-style cheese manufactured by Jalisco Mexican\nProducts Inc. of Artesia. It killed at least 40 people, and also ranks\nas one of the biggest food-contamination cases in California history.\n\nCantaloupes can rot within 2 weeks or so, and go bad even faster once\nthey've been sliced open. The cantaloupes at the center of this\noutbreak -- first flagged on 12 Sep 2011 -- are nearing the outer edge\nof their shelf life, making it less likely they will be eaten with\neach passing day.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Cantaloupes are said to have a shelf life of 2 weeks or so. Since\nJensen Farms, the source of the contaminated melons, voluntarily\nrecalled these melons, which it says were shipped between 29 Jul and\n10 Sep 2011, there should not be many more of these melons being\neaten. However, because the incubation period of listeriosis can be up\nto a month or more, there may be more cases, deaths, miscarriages, or\nstillbirths reported in the future due to consumption of these\n_Listeria_-contaminated melons. - Mod.ML]\nSee Also\nListeriosis, fatal - USA (06): cantaloupe, more cases & deaths\n20110923.2876\nListeriosis, fatal - USA (05): cantaloupe, more cases & deaths\n20110922.2871\nListeriosis, fatal - USA (04): cantaloupe, alert 20110921.2866\nListeriosis, fatal - USA (03): cantaloupe susp. 20110914.2800\nListeriosis, fatal - USA (02): (CO) 20110909.2746\nListeriosis, fatal - USA: (CO) 20110605.1719\n2010\n----\nListeriosis, fatal - USA (03): (TX), recall 20101105.4005\nListeriosis, fatal - USA (02): (TX), recall 20101021.3813\nListeriosis, fatal - USA: (TX) 20100515.1592\nListeriosis, fatal, meat product - Canada: (ON) 20100314.0829\n2009\n----\nListeriosis - Australia (02): airline food, chicken wrap susp\n20090820.2947\nListeriosis - Australia: airline food, chicken wrap susp\n20090807.2793\nListeriosis, fatal - Chile: (Santiago) meat susp, RFI 20090411.1391\nListeriosis, Mexican-style cheeses - USA: risk, recall 20090401.1261\nListeriosis, fatal, meat product - Canada: unconf. 20090307.0957\n2008\n----\nListeriosis, fatal - Chile: (Santiago) cheese susp.

Texas DSHS\nhad been investigating the source of 10 cases of listeriosis -- the\nillness caused by the ingestion of _Listeria [monocytogenes]_\nbacteria, 5 of which resulted in death -- for 8 months when\ninvestigators determined that the source of the outbreak was chopped\ncelery sold by Sangar Fresh Cut Produce in San Antonio. Six of the 10\ncases have been conclusively linked to consumption of the chopped\ncelery.\n\nAccording to a health department press release, all cases of\n_Listeria_ food poisoning occurred in Bexar, Travis and Hidalgo\ncounties. All of the reported cases were in people with serious\nunderlying health problems.\n\nSeveral segments of the population are at increased risk for\ncontracting listeriosis. Individuals at increased risk include:\nPregnant women, who are about 20 times more likely than other healthy\nadults to get listeriosis (about 1/3rd of listeriosis cases happen\nduring pregnancy); Newborns, who, rather than the pregnant women\nthemselves, suffer the serious effects of infection in pregnancy;\nPersons with weakened immune systems, [such as] persons with cancer,\ndiabetes, kidney disease, or AIDS (who are almost 300 times more\nlikely to get listeriosis than people with normal immune systems);\nPersons who take glucocorticosteroid medications (such as cortisone);\nand the elderly.\n\nTexas DSHS ordered the celery manufacturer, Sangar Fresh Cut Produce\nin San Antonio, to stop processing food and recall all products\nshipped from the plant since January 2010 after lab testing of\nchopped celery from the plant indicated the presence of _Listeria_.\nAccording to a press release issued by Texas DSHS, conditions in the\nfood processing plant posed \"an immediate and serious threat to human\nlife or health.\"\n\nSangar Fresh Cut Produce recalled products include primarily cut\nfresh produce in sealed packages, which were distributed to\nrestaurants and institutional facilities such as hospitals and\nschools. The chopped celery and other products are not believed to\nhave been sold in grocery stores.\n\nTexas DSHS inspectors reported that they found sanitation issues at\nthe plant during the _Listeria_ outbreak investigation and believe\nthe _Listeria_ bacteria found in the chopped celery may have\ncontaminated other food manufactured in the facility. The agency\nstated in a press release that a condensation leak had been found\nabove the food product area during an inspection. Inspectors also\nfound soil on a food preparation table and identified handwashing\nissues. All of these factors could have contributed to the spread of\n_Listeria_ throughout the food manufacturing plant where celery was\nchopped and packaged.\n\nTexas DSHS food safety personnel are continuing their investigation\ninto the possible points within the facility where the celery became\ncontaminated with _Listeria_ and is contacting distributors,\nrestaurants and institutions believed to have received the recalled\nproducts to ensure the celery and other products sold by Sangar Fresh\nCut Produce does not reach consumers.\n\nThe order issued by Texas DSHS prohibits the plant from reopening\nwithout DSHS approval.\n\nThe incubation period (time between ingestion and the onset of\nsymptoms) for listeriosis ranges from 3 to 70 days and averages 21\ndays.\n\nA person with listeriosis may develop fever, muscle aches, and\nsometimes, gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea or diarrhea. If\ninfection spreads to the nervous system, symptoms such as headache,\nstiff neck, confusion, loss of balance, or convulsions can occur. In\nimmune-deficient individuals, _Listeria_ can invade the central\nnervous system, causing meningitis and/or encephalitis (brain\ninfection). Infected pregnant women ordinarily experience only a\nmild, flu-like illness; however, infection during pregnancy can lead\nto miscarriage, infection of the newborn or even stillbirth.\n\nNewborns may present clinically with early-onset (less than 7 days)\nor late-onset forms of infection (7 or more days). Those with the\nearly-onset form are often diagnosed in the 1st 24 hours of life with\nsepsis (infection in the blood). Early-onset listeriosis is most\noften acquired from the mother through transplacental transmission.\nLate-onset neonatal listeriosis is less common than the early-onset\nform. Clinical symptoms may be subtle and include irritability, fever\nand poor feeding. The mode of acquisition of late-onset listeriosis\nis poorly understood.\n\n[Byline: Bill Marler]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nSara Volk, PhD\nAssistant Professor, Dept of Biology and Kinesiology\nOur Lady of the Lake University, San Antonio, TX\n<sara.m.volk@gmail.com>\n\n******\n[2]\nDate: Thu 21 Oct 2010\nSource: MySanAntonio.com [edited]\n<http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/health_official_says_celery_was_tainted_105446578.html>\n\n\nState health officials discounted claims by the president of Sangar\nProduce & Processing Co. that the company's celery -- linked to the\ndeaths of 5 people from foodborne illness -- is \"absolutely safe.\"\n\n\"When we test produce, we do a rapid screen initially,\" said Texas\nDepartment of State Health Services spokeswoman Carrie Williams. \"But\nthen we follow up with a very extensive, week long test where we grow\nthe organism to be sure of what we have. The celery was tested\nindependently of other ingredients, and our scientists concluded that\nthe illnesses were linked to the celery processed at the Sangar\nplant.\"\n\nState health officials ordered the closing of the produce plant and\nthe recall of all products shipped from there since January 2010\nfollowing the deaths of 5 people in Bexar, Travis and Hidalgo\ncounties from listeriosis. Five other people have become ill after\neating chopped celery processed by the plant at 1500 S. Zarzamora.\nOfficials say there's no indication celery was shipped outside Texas.\n\nIn a statement, company president Kenneth Sanquist Jr. said\nindependent testing done on the produce found it to be safe, adding,\n\"we are aggressively fighting the state's erroneous findings.\" A call\nto the company headquarters Thursday [21 Oct 2010] morning was\nreferred to the Uresti Law Firm, where an employee said a statement\nwould be released later in the day.\n\nHealth services spokeswoman Williams said Sangar products are sold\nprimarily to restaurants, hospitals and elementary schools, although\nshe would not release the names of any facilities were the celery\nmight have been consumed. Also unknown is the volume of produce\nSangar sold in the 10 months covered by the recall. \"Celery is often\nfrozen and, while you wouldn't want to eat it raw after it was\ndefrosted, it's still often used as an ingredient in other dishes,\"\nexplained Williams.\n\nWilliams would not estimate when the Sangar plant would resume\noperations. \"Right now, we're working with the company to collect\ndistribution information and to get the produce back to protect the\nhealth of consumers,\" she said. \"After that, we'll work with them to\nmake sure the facility is clean and safe and ready to re-open.\"\n\nTracking the outbreak was difficult for several reasons. Only a small\nnumber of cases have been reported, and many of the victims were\nelderly, with poor memories, or had already died. Also, _Listeria\nmonocytogenes_, the bacteria that causes listeriosis, has an\nincubation period of up to 70 days.\n\n[Byline: Richard A. Marini]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Since _Listeria monocytogenes_ in raw food would be killed during\ncooking, the risk of listeriosis is usually greatest from\nready-to-eat products; that is, food that will not be further cooked\nbefore eating. DNA fingerprinting of the isolates would help in\nestablishing epidemiologic linkage. It is not stated in the news\nrelease above whether DNA fingerprinting was done, and if so, whether\nthere was a common DNA fingerprint among the strains of _L.\nmonocytogenes_ isolated from patients in the Texas outbreak, which\nwould indicate a common source, and whether the DNA fingerprint of\nclinical isolates matched that of the strains isolated from the\ncelery processed at the Sangar plant. A detailed discussion of\nlisteriosis can be found in ProMED-mail post 20071230.4186.\n\nAll cases of the Texas listeriosis outbreak occurred in Bexar, Travis\nand Hidalgo counties. Travis County is part of the city of Austin\nmetropolitan area. Austin is the capital of the U.S. state of Texas\nand is located in Central Texas.

Texas DSHS\nhad been investigating the source of 10 cases of listeriosis -- the\nillness caused by the ingestion of _Listeria [monocytogenes]_\nbacteria, 5 of which resulted in death -- for 8 months when\ninvestigators determined that the source of the outbreak was chopped\ncelery sold by Sangar Fresh Cut Produce in San Antonio. Six of the 10\ncases have been conclusively linked to consumption of the chopped\ncelery.\n\nAccording to a health department press release, all cases of\n_Listeria_ food poisoning occurred in Bexar, Travis and Hidalgo\ncounties. All of the reported cases were in people with serious\nunderlying health problems.\n\nSeveral segments of the population are at increased risk for\ncontracting listeriosis. Individuals at increased risk include:\nPregnant women, who are about 20 times more likely than other healthy\nadults to get listeriosis (about 1/3rd of listeriosis cases happen\nduring pregnancy); Newborns, who, rather than the pregnant women\nthemselves, suffer the serious effects of infection in pregnancy;\nPersons with weakened immune systems, [such as] persons with cancer,\ndiabetes, kidney disease, or AIDS (who are almost 300 times more\nlikely to get listeriosis than people with normal immune systems);\nPersons who take glucocorticosteroid medications (such as cortisone);\nand the elderly.\n\nTexas DSHS ordered the celery manufacturer, Sangar Fresh Cut Produce\nin San Antonio, to stop processing food and recall all products\nshipped from the plant since January 2010 after lab testing of\nchopped celery from the plant indicated the presence of _Listeria_.\nAccording to a press release issued by Texas DSHS, conditions in the\nfood processing plant posed \"an immediate and serious threat to human\nlife or health.\"\n\nSangar Fresh Cut Produce recalled products include primarily cut\nfresh produce in sealed packages, which were distributed to\nrestaurants and institutional facilities such as hospitals and\nschools. The chopped celery and other products are not believed to\nhave been sold in grocery stores.\n\nTexas DSHS inspectors reported that they found sanitation issues at\nthe plant during the _Listeria_ outbreak investigation and believe\nthe _Listeria_ bacteria found in the chopped celery may have\ncontaminated other food manufactured in the facility. The agency\nstated in a press release that a condensation leak had been found\nabove the food product area during an inspection. Inspectors also\nfound soil on a food preparation table and identified handwashing\nissues. All of these factors could have contributed to the spread of\n_Listeria_ throughout the food manufacturing plant where celery was\nchopped and packaged.\n\nTexas DSHS food safety personnel are continuing their investigation\ninto the possible points within the facility where the celery became\ncontaminated with _Listeria_ and is contacting distributors,\nrestaurants and institutions believed to have received the recalled\nproducts to ensure the celery and other products sold by Sangar Fresh\nCut Produce does not reach consumers.\n\nThe order issued by Texas DSHS prohibits the plant from reopening\nwithout DSHS approval.\n\nThe incubation period (time between ingestion and the onset of\nsymptoms) for listeriosis ranges from 3 to 70 days and averages 21\ndays.\n\nA person with listeriosis may develop fever, muscle aches, and\nsometimes, gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea or diarrhea. If\ninfection spreads to the nervous system, symptoms such as headache,\nstiff neck, confusion, loss of balance, or convulsions can occur. In\nimmune-deficient individuals, _Listeria_ can invade the central\nnervous system, causing meningitis and/or encephalitis (brain\ninfection). Infected pregnant women ordinarily experience only a\nmild, flu-like illness; however, infection during pregnancy can lead\nto miscarriage, infection of the newborn or even stillbirth.\n\nNewborns may present clinically with early-onset (less than 7 days)\nor late-onset forms of infection (7 or more days). Those with the\nearly-onset form are often diagnosed in the 1st 24 hours of life with\nsepsis (infection in the blood). Early-onset listeriosis is most\noften acquired from the mother through transplacental transmission.\nLate-onset neonatal listeriosis is less common than the early-onset\nform.

Texas DSHS\nhad been investigating the source of 10 cases of listeriosis -- the\nillness caused by the ingestion of _Listeria [monocytogenes]_\nbacteria, 5 of which resulted in death -- for 8 months when\ninvestigators determined that the source of the outbreak was chopped\ncelery sold by Sangar Fresh Cut Produce in San Antonio. Six of the 10\ncases have been conclusively linked to consumption of the chopped\ncelery.\n\nAccording to a health department press release, all cases of\n_Listeria_ food poisoning occurred in Bexar, Travis and Hidalgo\ncounties. All of the reported cases were in people with serious\nunderlying health problems.\n\nSeveral segments of the population are at increased risk for\ncontracting listeriosis. Individuals at increased risk include:\nPregnant women, who are about 20 times more likely than other healthy\nadults to get listeriosis (about 1/3rd of listeriosis cases happen\nduring pregnancy); Newborns, who, rather than the pregnant women\nthemselves, suffer the serious effects of infection in pregnancy;\nPersons with weakened immune systems, [such as] persons with cancer,\ndiabetes, kidney disease, or AIDS (who are almost 300 times more\nlikely to get listeriosis than people with normal immune systems);\nPersons who take glucocorticosteroid medications (such as cortisone);\nand the elderly.\n\nTexas DSHS ordered the celery manufacturer, Sangar Fresh Cut Produce\nin San Antonio, to stop processing food and recall all products\nshipped from the plant since January 2010 after lab testing of\nchopped celery from the plant indicated the presence of _Listeria_.\nAccording to a press release issued by Texas DSHS, conditions in the\nfood processing plant posed \"an immediate and serious threat to human\nlife or health.\"\n\nSangar Fresh Cut Produce recalled products include primarily cut\nfresh produce in sealed packages, which were distributed to\nrestaurants and institutional facilities such as hospitals and\nschools. The chopped celery and other products are not believed to\nhave been sold in grocery stores.\n\nTexas DSHS inspectors reported that they found sanitation issues at\nthe plant during the _Listeria_ outbreak investigation and believe\nthe _Listeria_ bacteria found in the chopped celery may have\ncontaminated other food manufactured in the facility. The agency\nstated in a press release that a condensation leak had been found\nabove the food product area during an inspection. Inspectors also\nfound soil on a food preparation table and identified handwashing\nissues. All of these factors could have contributed to the spread of\n_Listeria_ throughout the food manufacturing plant where celery was\nchopped and packaged.\n\nTexas DSHS food safety personnel are continuing their investigation\ninto the possible points within the facility where the celery became\ncontaminated with _Listeria_ and is contacting distributors,\nrestaurants and institutions believed to have received the recalled\nproducts to ensure the celery and other products sold by Sangar Fresh\nCut Produce does not reach consumers.\n\nThe order issued by Texas DSHS prohibits the plant from reopening\nwithout DSHS approval.\n\nThe incubation period (time between ingestion and the onset of\nsymptoms) for listeriosis ranges from 3 to 70 days and averages 21\ndays.\n\nA person with listeriosis may develop fever, muscle aches, and\nsometimes, gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea or diarrhea. If\ninfection spreads to the nervous system, symptoms such as headache,\nstiff neck, confusion, loss of balance, or convulsions can occur. In\nimmune-deficient individuals, _Listeria_ can invade the central\nnervous system, causing meningitis and/or encephalitis (brain\ninfection). Infected pregnant women ordinarily experience only a\nmild, flu-like illness; however, infection during pregnancy can lead\nto miscarriage, infection of the newborn or even stillbirth.\n\nNewborns may present clinically with early-onset (less than 7 days)\nor late-onset forms of infection (7 or more days). Those with the\nearly-onset form are often diagnosed in the 1st 24 hours of life with\nsepsis (infection in the blood). Early-onset listeriosis is most\noften acquired from the mother through transplacental transmission.\nLate-onset neonatal listeriosis is less common than the early-onset\nform. Clinical symptoms may be subtle and include irritability, fever\nand poor feeding. The mode of acquisition of late-onset listeriosis\nis poorly understood.\n\n[Byline: Bill Marler]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nSara Volk, PhD\nAssistant Professor, Dept of Biology and Kinesiology\nOur Lady of the Lake University, San Antonio, TX\n<sara.m.volk@gmail.com>\n\n******\n[2]\nDate: Thu 21 Oct 2010\nSource: MySanAntonio.com [edited]\n<http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/health_official_says_celery_was_tainted_105446578.html>\n\n\nState health officials discounted claims by the president of Sangar\nProduce & Processing Co. that the company's celery -- linked to the\ndeaths of 5 people from foodborne illness -- is \"absolutely safe.\"\n\n\"When we test produce, we do a rapid screen initially,\" said Texas\nDepartment of State Health Services spokeswoman Carrie Williams. \"But\nthen we follow up with a very extensive, week long test where we grow\nthe organism to be sure of what we have.

Texas DSHS\nhad been investigating the source of 10 cases of listeriosis -- the\nillness caused by the ingestion of _Listeria [monocytogenes]_\nbacteria, 5 of which resulted in death -- for 8 months when\ninvestigators determined that the source of the outbreak was chopped\ncelery sold by Sangar Fresh Cut Produce in San Antonio. Six of the 10\ncases have been conclusively linked to consumption of the chopped\ncelery.\n\nAccording to a health department press release, all cases of\n_Listeria_ food poisoning occurred in Bexar, Travis and Hidalgo\ncounties. All of the reported cases were in people with serious\nunderlying health problems.\n\nSeveral segments of the population are at increased risk for\ncontracting listeriosis. Individuals at increased risk include:\nPregnant women, who are about 20 times more likely than other healthy\nadults to get listeriosis (about 1/3rd of listeriosis cases happen\nduring pregnancy); Newborns, who, rather than the pregnant women\nthemselves, suffer the serious effects of infection in pregnancy;\nPersons with weakened immune systems, [such as] persons with cancer,\ndiabetes, kidney disease, or AIDS (who are almost 300 times more\nlikely to get listeriosis than people with normal immune systems);\nPersons who take glucocorticosteroid medications (such as cortisone);\nand the elderly.\n\nTexas DSHS ordered the celery manufacturer, Sangar Fresh Cut Produce\nin San Antonio, to stop processing food and recall all products\nshipped from the plant since January 2010 after lab testing of\nchopped celery from the plant indicated the presence of _Listeria_.\nAccording to a press release issued by Texas DSHS, conditions in the\nfood processing plant posed \"an immediate and serious threat to human\nlife or health.\"\n\nSangar Fresh Cut Produce recalled products include primarily cut\nfresh produce in sealed packages, which were distributed to\nrestaurants and institutional facilities such as hospitals and\nschools. The chopped celery and other products are not believed to\nhave been sold in grocery stores.\n\nTexas DSHS inspectors reported that they found sanitation issues at\nthe plant during the _Listeria_ outbreak investigation and believe\nthe _Listeria_ bacteria found in the chopped celery may have\ncontaminated other food manufactured in the facility. The agency\nstated in a press release that a condensation leak had been found\nabove the food product area during an inspection. Inspectors also\nfound soil on a food preparation table and identified handwashing\nissues. All of these factors could have contributed to the spread of\n_Listeria_ throughout the food manufacturing plant where celery was\nchopped and packaged.\n\nTexas DSHS food safety personnel are continuing their investigation\ninto the possible points within the facility where the celery became\ncontaminated with _Listeria_ and is contacting distributors,\nrestaurants and institutions believed to have received the recalled\nproducts to ensure the celery and other products sold by Sangar Fresh\nCut Produce does not reach consumers.\n\nThe order issued by Texas DSHS prohibits the plant from reopening\nwithout DSHS approval.\n\nThe incubation period (time between ingestion and the onset of\nsymptoms) for listeriosis ranges from 3 to 70 days and averages 21\ndays.\n\nA person with listeriosis may develop fever, muscle aches, and\nsometimes, gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea or diarrhea. If\ninfection spreads to the nervous system, symptoms such as headache,\nstiff neck, confusion, loss of balance, or convulsions can occur. In\nimmune-deficient individuals, _Listeria_ can invade the central\nnervous system, causing meningitis and/or encephalitis (brain\ninfection). Infected pregnant women ordinarily experience only a\nmild, flu-like illness; however, infection during pregnancy can lead\nto miscarriage, infection of the newborn or even stillbirth.\n\nNewborns may present clinically with early-onset (less than 7 days)\nor late-onset forms of infection (7 or more days). Those with the\nearly-onset form are often diagnosed in the 1st 24 hours of life with\nsepsis (infection in the blood). Early-onset listeriosis is most\noften acquired from the mother through transplacental transmission.\nLate-onset neonatal listeriosis is less common than the early-onset\nform.

Texas DSHS\nhad been investigating the source of 10 cases of listeriosis -- the\nillness caused by the ingestion of _Listeria [monocytogenes]_\nbacteria, 5 of which resulted in death -- for 8 months when\ninvestigators determined that the source of the outbreak was chopped\ncelery sold by Sangar Fresh Cut Produce in San Antonio. Six of the 10\ncases have been conclusively linked to consumption of the chopped\ncelery.\n\nAccording to a health department press release, all cases of\n_Listeria_ food poisoning occurred in Bexar, Travis and Hidalgo\ncounties. All of the reported cases were in people with serious\nunderlying health problems.\n\nSeveral segments of the population are at increased risk for\ncontracting listeriosis. Individuals at increased risk include:\nPregnant women, who are about 20 times more likely than other healthy\nadults to get listeriosis (about 1/3rd of listeriosis cases happen\nduring pregnancy); Newborns, who, rather than the pregnant women\nthemselves, suffer the serious effects of infection in pregnancy;\nPersons with weakened immune systems, [such as] persons with cancer,\ndiabetes, kidney disease, or AIDS (who are almost 300 times more\nlikely to get listeriosis than people with normal immune systems);\nPersons who take glucocorticosteroid medications (such as cortisone);\nand the elderly.\n\nTexas DSHS ordered the celery manufacturer, Sangar Fresh Cut Produce\nin San Antonio, to stop processing food and recall all products\nshipped from the plant since January 2010 after lab testing of\nchopped celery from the plant indicated the presence of _Listeria_.\nAccording to a press release issued by Texas DSHS, conditions in the\nfood processing plant posed \"an immediate and serious threat to human\nlife or health.\"\n\nSangar Fresh Cut Produce recalled products include primarily cut\nfresh produce in sealed packages, which were distributed to\nrestaurants and institutional facilities such as hospitals and\nschools. The chopped celery and other products are not believed to\nhave been sold in grocery stores.\n\nTexas DSHS inspectors reported that they found sanitation issues at\nthe plant during the _Listeria_ outbreak investigation and believe\nthe _Listeria_ bacteria found in the chopped celery may have\ncontaminated other food manufactured in the facility. The agency\nstated in a press release that a condensation leak had been found\nabove the food product area during an inspection. Inspectors also\nfound soil on a food preparation table and identified handwashing\nissues. All of these factors could have contributed to the spread of\n_Listeria_ throughout the food manufacturing plant where celery was\nchopped and packaged.\n\nTexas DSHS food safety personnel are continuing their investigation\ninto the possible points within the facility where the celery became\ncontaminated with _Listeria_ and is contacting distributors,\nrestaurants and institutions believed to have received the recalled\nproducts to ensure the celery and other products sold by Sangar Fresh\nCut Produce does not reach consumers.\n\nThe order issued by Texas DSHS prohibits the plant from reopening\nwithout DSHS approval.\n\nThe incubation period (time between ingestion and the onset of\nsymptoms) for listeriosis ranges from 3 to 70 days and averages 21\ndays.\n\nA person with listeriosis may develop fever, muscle aches, and\nsometimes, gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea or diarrhea. If\ninfection spreads to the nervous system, symptoms such as headache,\nstiff neck, confusion, loss of balance, or convulsions can occur. In\nimmune-deficient individuals, _Listeria_ can invade the central\nnervous system, causing meningitis and/or encephalitis (brain\ninfection). Infected pregnant women ordinarily experience only a\nmild, flu-like illness; however, infection during pregnancy can lead\nto miscarriage, infection of the newborn or even stillbirth.\n\nNewborns may present clinically with early-onset (less than 7 days)\nor late-onset forms of infection (7 or more days). Those with the\nearly-onset form are often diagnosed in the 1st 24 hours of life with\nsepsis (infection in the blood). Early-onset listeriosis is most\noften acquired from the mother through transplacental transmission.\nLate-onset neonatal listeriosis is less common than the early-onset\nform. Clinical symptoms may be subtle and include irritability, fever\nand poor feeding. The mode of acquisition of late-onset listeriosis\nis poorly understood.\n\n[Byline: Bill Marler]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nSara Volk, PhD\nAssistant Professor, Dept of Biology and Kinesiology\nOur Lady of the Lake University, San Antonio, TX\n<sara.m.volk@gmail.com>\n\n******\n[2]\nDate: Thu 21 Oct 2010\nSource: MySanAntonio.com [edited]\n<http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/health_official_says_celery_was_tainted_105446578.html>\n\n\nState health officials discounted claims by the president of Sangar\nProduce & Processing Co. that the company's celery -- linked to the\ndeaths of 5 people from foodborne illness -- is \"absolutely safe.\"\n\n\"When we test produce, we do a rapid screen initially,\" said Texas\nDepartment of State Health Services spokeswoman Carrie Williams. \"But\nthen we follow up with a very extensive, week long test where we grow\nthe organism to be sure of what we have. The celery was tested\nindependently of other ingredients, and our scientists concluded that\nthe illnesses were linked to the celery processed at the Sangar\nplant.\"\n\nState health officials ordered the closing of the produce plant and\nthe recall of all products shipped from there since January 2010\nfollowing the deaths of 5 people in Bexar, Travis and Hidalgo\ncounties from listeriosis. Five other people have become ill after\neating chopped celery processed by the plant at 1500 S. Zarzamora.\nOfficials say there's no indication celery was shipped outside Texas.\n\nIn a statement, company president Kenneth Sanquist Jr. said\nindependent testing done on the produce found it to be safe, adding,\n\"we are aggressively fighting the state's erroneous findings.\" A call\nto the company headquarters Thursday [21 Oct 2010] morning was\nreferred to the Uresti Law Firm, where an employee said a statement\nwould be released later in the day.\n\nHealth services spokeswoman Williams said Sangar products are sold\nprimarily to restaurants, hospitals and elementary schools, although\nshe would not release the names of any facilities were the celery\nmight have been consumed. Also unknown is the volume of produce\nSangar sold in the 10 months covered by the recall. \"Celery is often\nfrozen and, while you wouldn't want to eat it raw after it was\ndefrosted, it's still often used as an ingredient in other dishes,\"\nexplained Williams.\n\nWilliams would not estimate when the Sangar plant would resume\noperations. \"Right now, we're working with the company to collect\ndistribution information and to get the produce back to protect the\nhealth of consumers,\" she said. \"After that, we'll work with them to\nmake sure the facility is clean and safe and ready to re-open.\"\n\nTracking the outbreak was difficult for several reasons. Only a small\nnumber of cases have been reported, and many of the victims were\nelderly, with poor memories, or had already died. Also, _Listeria\nmonocytogenes_, the bacteria that causes listeriosis, has an\nincubation period of up to 70 days.\n\n[Byline: Richard A. Marini]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Since _Listeria monocytogenes_ in raw food would be killed during\ncooking, the risk of listeriosis is usually greatest from\nready-to-eat products; that is, food that will not be further cooked\nbefore eating. DNA fingerprinting of the isolates would help in\nestablishing epidemiologic linkage. It is not stated in the news\nrelease above whether DNA fingerprinting was done, and if so, whether\nthere was a common DNA fingerprint among the strains of _L.\nmonocytogenes_ isolated from patients in the Texas outbreak, which\nwould indicate a common source, and whether the DNA fingerprint of\nclinical isolates matched that of the strains isolated from the\ncelery processed at the Sangar plant. A detailed discussion of\nlisteriosis can be found in ProMED-mail post 20071230.4186.\n\nAll cases of the Texas listeriosis outbreak occurred in Bexar, Travis\nand Hidalgo counties.

Ingrid\nHeitman, head of the Chilean Public Health Institute reports that\ncurrently between 2 and 3 cases of listeriosis are being reported per\nweek.\n\nThe disease affects mainly immunocompromised patients and pregnant\nwomen and can result in invasion of the nervous system, meningitis,\nor pneumonia, and even be fatal in newborns and the elderly.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[2] Date: Tue 25 Nov 2008\nSource: Yahoo Noticias, Associated Press (AP) report [in Spanish,\ntrans.

According to Roberto Belmar, regional secretary of the Chilean\nMinistry of Health, once the origin is confirmed, a sanitary alert\nmay be issued. Until now, health authorities in the capital have\nrecorded 91 cases of the disease, and 60 percent of them originated\nin a wealthy area of the capital [Santiago].\n\nListeriosis is a disease caused by the ingestion of food contaminated\nwith _Listeria monocytogenes_, and it affects mainly pregnant women.\nThis condition may be lethal in babies and in the elderly.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-ESP\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The news releases above report a total of 5 deaths out of 91 reported\ncases of listeriosis, 60 percent of whom live in a wealthy section of\nthe capital, Santiago, but do not give many details as to age, sex, or\nco-morbid conditions -- other than 42 percent were pregnant women --\nor diet history.\n\nThe news releases say that authorities withdrew from circulation a\nbrand of brie, a soft cheese often implicated as a source of\nlisteriosis, in which _Listeria monocytogenes_ was detected, but then\ngo on to say that the exact origin of this outbreak has not as yet\nbeen determined, which implies that this cheese perhaps may not have\nbeen eaten by a significant number of the patients or that a DNA\nfingerprint of the strain isolated from patients and the brie did not\nsubstantiate a link.\n\nIn addition to newborns, pregnant women, and the elderly, mentioned\nabove, those with compromised immune defenses (such as, HIV-infected\npatients) are also more susceptible to severe forms of listeriosis.\n\nWe await a more detailed description of this outbreak, and perhaps\nDNA fingerprinting of isolates from the suspected source and from\npatients that would confirm a linkage.\n\nA detailed discussion of listeriosis can be found in ProMED-mail\nposting no. 20071230.4186.\n\nSantiago, in Chile's central valley, can be located on the\nHealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at\n<http://healthmap.org/promed/en?g=3871336&v=-33.45,-70.667,5>. - Mod.ML]\nSee Also\nListeriosis - USA: (MA), update 20080118.0223\nListeriosis, fatal, meat product - Canada (04) 20081005.3147\n2007\n----\nListeriosis - USA: (NC, MA), alert 20071230.4186\nListeriosis, nosocomial - Norway: (Oslo) 20071024.3452\nListeriosis, unpasteurized cheese - USA (IN) 20070425.1351\nListeriosis, sandwiches - UK (England): alert, recall 20070326.1049\n2005\n----\nListeriosis - USA (TX) 20050824.2491\nListeriosis - USA (NY) (05) 20050819.2431\nListeriosis - USA (NY) 20050707.1925\n2004\n----\nListeriosis, cluster - USA (VA)(02): background 20040723.2013\nListeriosis, cluster - USA (VA) 20040722.1999\n2003\n----\nListeriosis, new prevention regulations - USA 20030605.1385\n2002\n----\nListeriosis - USA (multistate) (08) 20021015.5556\nListeriosis - USA (Pennsylvania) 20020901.5205\n2000\n----\nListeriosis - France (05) 20000226.0261\nListeriosis - France 20000219.0224\n........................................ml/jw/mj/jw\n*##########################################################*\n************************************************************\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.

An injunction is a court order to stop a firm from\nmanufacturing, distributing, processing, or shipping a product. The\ngovernment's complaint, filed on 24 Jan 2006 by the Department of\nJustice in the District Court for the Southern District of\nCalifornia, charges the defendants with violating the Federal Food,\nDrug, and Cosmetic Act by permitting ready-to-eat fish held and\nprocessed in Pacific Shellfish's facility to become contaminated.\nAccording to the complaint, recent FDA inspections in 2004 and 2005\nrevealed the presence of _Listeria monocytogenes_, a disease-causing\nbacterium, on Pacific Shellfish's processing equipment and fish\nproducts. Inspections since 2001 have also documented persistent\nunsanitary conditions at the facility. FDA issued a letter to the\nfirm on 8 Dec 2004, after an inspection revealed unsanitary\nconditions and contamination with _Listeria_. Although the firm\npromised to correct its deficiencies, a 2005 inspection found that a\npersistent strain of _Listeria_ remained and the firm had not\nimplemented all of the promised corrections.\n_Listeria monocytogenesis_ is the causal agent of listeriosis, a\ndisease that can be very serious, even fatal, for high-risk groups\nsuch as pregnant women, unborn babies, newborns, and those with\nimpaired immune systems. Although proper cooking can eliminate the\norganism in fish products, raw fish products, such as those found in\nsome types of sushi, pose a serious health risk if contaminated with\n_Listeria_. Even if fish is intended to be cooked, however, adequate\nsanitation is needed to prevent the spread of this strain throughout\nthe distribution system and to restaurants and consumer homes, where\nit may contaminate ready-to-eat foods. The strain isolated from the\n2004 and 2005 inspections was identical to a strain that has caused\nhuman illness.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[The greatest threat of listeriosis is from ready-to-eat products\nthat do not require further cooking at home. _L. monocytogenes_ in\nraw food that will be cooked before consumption is less of a concern\nto the food industry, since the bacteria are killed during cooking.\nListeriosis can be acquired from seafood, although most think of the\nrisk from processed deli meats 1st. Yearly, recalls of seafood,\nespecially smoked salmon, are posted on FDA's website. Although not\ngenerally linked to large outbreaks, those at high risk, such as\npregnant women and those individuals with compromised cell-mediated\nimmunity, should avoid the food described below.\n_L. monocytogenes_ has been isolated from raw fish, cooked crabs, raw\nand cooked shrimp, raw lobster, surimi (minced, processed fish used\nin the preparation of imitation seafood, especially imitation\nshellfish) and smoked fish (1). Hazards from _L. monocytogenes_ can\nbe prevented by thoroughly cooking seafood and by preventing\ncross-contamination once the seafood is cooked.\nThe CDC's recommendations regarding the risk of acquiring listeriosis\nfrom seafood (2) include not eating refrigerated smoked seafood\nunless it is contained in a cooked dish, such as a casserole.\nRefrigerated smoked seafood, such as salmon, trout, whitefish, cod,\ntuna or mackerel, is most often labeled as \"nova-style,\" \"lox,\"\n\"kippered,\" \"smoked,\" or \"jerky.\" The fish is found in the\nrefrigerator section or sold at deli counters of grocery stores and\ndelicatessens. Canned or shelf-stable smoked seafood may be eaten.\n1. Ward D, Bernard D, Collette R, et al. (Eds.): Hazards Found in\nSeafoods, Appendix III.

An injunction is a court order to stop a firm from\nmanufacturing, distributing, processing, or shipping a product. The\ngovernment's complaint, filed on 24 Jan 2006 by the Department of\nJustice in the District Court for the Southern District of\nCalifornia, charges the defendants with violating the Federal Food,\nDrug, and Cosmetic Act by permitting ready-to-eat fish held and\nprocessed in Pacific Shellfish's facility to become contaminated.\nAccording to the complaint, recent FDA inspections in 2004 and 2005\nrevealed the presence of _Listeria monocytogenes_, a disease-causing\nbacterium, on Pacific Shellfish's processing equipment and fish\nproducts. Inspections since 2001 have also documented persistent\nunsanitary conditions at the facility. FDA issued a letter to the\nfirm on 8 Dec 2004, after an inspection revealed unsanitary\nconditions and contamination with _Listeria_. Although the firm\npromised to correct its deficiencies, a 2005 inspection found that a\npersistent strain of _Listeria_ remained and the firm had not\nimplemented all of the promised corrections.\n_Listeria monocytogenesis_ is the causal agent of listeriosis, a\ndisease that can be very serious, even fatal, for high-risk groups\nsuch as pregnant women, unborn babies, newborns, and those with\nimpaired immune systems. Although proper cooking can eliminate the\norganism in fish products, raw fish products, such as those found in\nsome types of sushi, pose a serious health risk if contaminated with\n_Listeria_. Even if fish is intended to be cooked, however, adequate\nsanitation is needed to prevent the spread of this strain throughout\nthe distribution system and to restaurants and consumer homes, where\nit may contaminate ready-to-eat foods. The strain isolated from the\n2004 and 2005 inspections was identical to a strain that has caused\nhuman illness.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[The greatest threat of listeriosis is from ready-to-eat products\nthat do not require further cooking at home. _L. monocytogenes_ in\nraw food that will be cooked before consumption is less of a concern\nto the food industry, since the bacteria are killed during cooking.\nListeriosis can be acquired from seafood, although most think of the\nrisk from processed deli meats 1st. Yearly, recalls of seafood,\nespecially smoked salmon, are posted on FDA's website. Although not\ngenerally linked to large outbreaks, those at high risk, such as\npregnant women and those individuals with compromised cell-mediated\nimmunity, should avoid the food described below.\n_L. monocytogenes_ has been isolated from raw fish, cooked crabs, raw\nand cooked shrimp, raw lobster, surimi (minced, processed fish used\nin the preparation of imitation seafood, especially imitation\nshellfish) and smoked fish (1). Hazards from _L. monocytogenes_ can\nbe prevented by thoroughly cooking seafood and by preventing\ncross-contamination once the seafood is cooked.\nThe CDC's recommendations regarding the risk of acquiring listeriosis\nfrom seafood (2) include not eating refrigerated smoked seafood\nunless it is contained in a cooked dish, such as a casserole.\nRefrigerated smoked seafood, such as salmon, trout, whitefish, cod,\ntuna or mackerel, is most often labeled as \"nova-style,\" \"lox,\"\n\"kippered,\" \"smoked,\" or \"jerky.\" The fish is found in the\nrefrigerator section or sold at deli counters of grocery stores and\ndelicatessens.

An injunction is a court order to stop a firm from\nmanufacturing, distributing, processing, or shipping a product. The\ngovernment's complaint, filed on 24 Jan 2006 by the Department of\nJustice in the District Court for the Southern District of\nCalifornia, charges the defendants with violating the Federal Food,\nDrug, and Cosmetic Act by permitting ready-to-eat fish held and\nprocessed in Pacific Shellfish's facility to become contaminated.\nAccording to the complaint, recent FDA inspections in 2004 and 2005\nrevealed the presence of _Listeria monocytogenes_, a disease-causing\nbacterium, on Pacific Shellfish's processing equipment and fish\nproducts. Inspections since 2001 have also documented persistent\nunsanitary conditions at the facility. FDA issued a letter to the\nfirm on 8 Dec 2004, after an inspection revealed unsanitary\nconditions and contamination with _Listeria_. Although the firm\npromised to correct its deficiencies, a 2005 inspection found that a\npersistent strain of _Listeria_ remained and the firm had not\nimplemented all of the promised corrections.\n_Listeria monocytogenesis_ is the causal agent of listeriosis, a\ndisease that can be very serious, even fatal, for high-risk groups\nsuch as pregnant women, unborn babies, newborns, and those with\nimpaired immune systems. Although proper cooking can eliminate the\norganism in fish products, raw fish products, such as those found in\nsome types of sushi, pose a serious health risk if contaminated with\n_Listeria_. Even if fish is intended to be cooked, however, adequate\nsanitation is needed to prevent the spread of this strain throughout\nthe distribution system and to restaurants and consumer homes, where\nit may contaminate ready-to-eat foods. The strain isolated from the\n2004 and 2005 inspections was identical to a strain that has caused\nhuman illness.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[The greatest threat of listeriosis is from ready-to-eat products\nthat do not require further cooking at home. _L. monocytogenes_ in\nraw food that will be cooked before consumption is less of a concern\nto the food industry, since the bacteria are killed during cooking.\nListeriosis can be acquired from seafood, although most think of the\nrisk from processed deli meats 1st. Yearly, recalls of seafood,\nespecially smoked salmon, are posted on FDA's website. Although not\ngenerally linked to large outbreaks, those at high risk, such as\npregnant women and those individuals with compromised cell-mediated\nimmunity, should avoid the food described below.\n_L. monocytogenes_ has been isolated from raw fish, cooked crabs, raw\nand cooked shrimp, raw lobster, surimi (minced, processed fish used\nin the preparation of imitation seafood, especially imitation\nshellfish) and smoked fish (1). Hazards from _L. monocytogenes_ can\nbe prevented by thoroughly cooking seafood and by preventing\ncross-contamination once the seafood is cooked.\nThe CDC's recommendations regarding the risk of acquiring listeriosis\nfrom seafood (2) include not eating refrigerated smoked seafood\nunless it is contained in a cooked dish, such as a casserole.\nRefrigerated smoked seafood, such as salmon, trout, whitefish, cod,\ntuna or mackerel, is most often labeled as \"nova-style,\" \"lox,\"\n\"kippered,\" \"smoked,\" or \"jerky.\" The fish is found in the\nrefrigerator section or sold at deli counters of grocery stores and\ndelicatessens. Canned or shelf-stable smoked seafood may be eaten.\n1. Ward D, Bernard D, Collette R, et al. (Eds.): Hazards Found in\nSeafoods, Appendix III.

Foods Co. Inc.,\nlaunched the recall after inspection of a product sample collected on 14\nNov 2002 tested positive for _L. monocytogenes_, a potentially deadly\nbacteria for especially immune suppressed individuals and pregnant women.\n\"The sample is being further analyzed to determine whether or not it\nmatches the outbreak strain,\" the USDA said in a statement.\nThe company said the recalled products were produced between 1 June 2002\nand 6 Nov 2002 and distributed to retail stores and institutions\nnationwide. The product bears establishment code \"P-4340\" inside the USDA\nseal of inspection.\nSpokesman Lynn Kettleson said officials \"assume a goodly portion of the\nproduct was consumed.\"\nOn 2 Nov 2002, the company recalled 200 000 pounds of poultry, after its\nproducts were linked to an outbreak in the Northeast that has killed 7\npeople. USDA said the strain found in both incidents were\n\"indistinguishable.\" Despite the government's findings, the company said\n\"to our knowledge, no one has become ill as a result of consuming these\nproducts.\"\nPilgrim's Pride, the No. 3 poultry producer based in Pittsburg, Texas, was\nalso linked to the listeriosis outbreak. It recalled 27.4 million pounds of\nits Wampler brand turkey and chicken, a record recall. Despite USDA\ntest results finding the listeria outbreak strain at its plant, Pilgrim's\nPride also has said its products were not to blame for the illnesses.\nJack Lambersky's plant in Camden, N.J., was voluntarily closed after the\ninitial recall of 200 000 pounds. USDA said last week it would allow the\nplant to resume operations after inspectors approved the company's new food\nsafety measures.\nDespite the expanded recall, the USDA said the plant remained open because\nthe 14 Nov 2002 sample that tested positive for listeria was actually\nproduced on 30 Aug 2002. \"The plant is still open because all the (USDA)\naction took place at the 2 Nov 2002 recall,\" said Steve Cohen, spokesman\nfor USDA's Food Safetyand Inspection Service. \"The complete plant was\ncleaned up.\"\nThe company said it was working closely with USDA determining the origin of\nthe listeria contamination. \"We are communicating to all of our impacted\ncustomers and are providing instructions on how the should handle the\nproducts covered by the recall,\" the company said in a statement.\nFaced with severe criticism from consumer groups and some Democrats on lax\nenforcement, the USDA said it would increase listeria testing at certain\nplants. About 1 500 meat plants that either do not test for listeria or\nchoose not to share their results with USDA were subject to USDA's\ndirective, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said on 18 Nov. The directive\nwill take effect on 9 Dec 2002.\nThe new directive would not have prevented the listeria recalls at Jack\nLambersky or Pilgrim's Pride because both claim they routinely test their\nplants and products for the bacteria.\n******\n[2]\nDate: 21 Nov 2002\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: Food Safety and Inspection Service Recall (edited)\n<http://www.fsis.usda.gov/OA/recalls/rnrfiles/rnr098-2002.htm>\n\nRecall Notification Report 098-2002 Expanded, 21 Nov 2002\n---------------------------------------------------------------\nProduct(s) Recalled: Fresh and Frozen Ready-To-Eat Turkey and Chicken Products\nIn response to an ongoing food safety investigation, FSIS collected\nmicrobiological investigative sample on 14 Nov 2002, that returned positive\nresults for _Listeria monocytogenes_ on 20 Nov 2002.

Foods Co. Inc.,\nlaunched the recall after inspection of a product sample collected on 14\nNov 2002 tested positive for _L. monocytogenes_, a potentially deadly\nbacteria for especially immune suppressed individuals and pregnant women.\n\"The sample is being further analyzed to determine whether or not it\nmatches the outbreak strain,\" the USDA said in a statement.\nThe company said the recalled products were produced between 1 June 2002\nand 6 Nov 2002 and distributed to retail stores and institutions\nnationwide. The product bears establishment code \"P-4340\" inside the USDA\nseal of inspection.\nSpokesman Lynn Kettleson said officials \"assume a goodly portion of the\nproduct was consumed.\"\nOn 2 Nov 2002, the company recalled 200 000 pounds of poultry, after its\nproducts were linked to an outbreak in the Northeast that has killed 7\npeople. USDA said the strain found in both incidents were\n\"indistinguishable.\" Despite the government's findings, the company said\n\"to our knowledge, no one has become ill as a result of consuming these\nproducts.\"\nPilgrim's Pride, the No. 3 poultry producer based in Pittsburg, Texas, was\nalso linked to the listeriosis outbreak. It recalled 27.4 million pounds of\nits Wampler brand turkey and chicken, a record recall. Despite USDA\ntest results finding the listeria outbreak strain at its plant, Pilgrim's\nPride also has said its products were not to blame for the illnesses.\nJack Lambersky's plant in Camden, N.J., was voluntarily closed after the\ninitial recall of 200 000 pounds. USDA said last week it would allow the\nplant to resume operations after inspectors approved the company's new food\nsafety measures.\nDespite the expanded recall, the USDA said the plant remained open because\nthe 14 Nov 2002 sample that tested positive for listeria was actually\nproduced on 30 Aug 2002. \"The plant is still open because all the (USDA)\naction took place at the 2 Nov 2002 recall,\" said Steve Cohen, spokesman\nfor USDA's Food Safetyand Inspection Service. \"The complete plant was\ncleaned up.\"\nThe company said it was working closely with USDA determining the origin of\nthe listeria contamination. \"We are communicating to all of our impacted\ncustomers and are providing instructions on how the should handle the\nproducts covered by the recall,\" the company said in a statement.\nFaced with severe criticism from consumer groups and some Democrats on lax\nenforcement, the USDA said it would increase listeria testing at certain\nplants. About 1 500 meat plants that either do not test for listeria or\nchoose not to share their results with USDA were subject to USDA's\ndirective, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said on 18 Nov. The directive\nwill take effect on 9 Dec 2002.\nThe new directive would not have prevented the listeria recalls at Jack\nLambersky or Pilgrim's Pride because both claim they routinely test their\nplants and products for the bacteria.\n******\n[2]\nDate: 21 Nov 2002\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: Food Safety and Inspection Service Recall (edited)\n<http://www.fsis.usda.gov/OA/recalls/rnrfiles/rnr098-2002.htm>\n\nRecall Notification Report 098-2002 Expanded, 21 Nov 2002\n---------------------------------------------------------------\nProduct(s) Recalled: Fresh and Frozen Ready-To-Eat Turkey and Chicken Products\nIn response to an ongoing food safety investigation, FSIS collected\nmicrobiological investigative sample on 14 Nov 2002, that returned positive\nresults for _Listeria monocytogenes_ on 20 Nov 2002.

Foods Co. Inc.,\nlaunched the recall after inspection of a product sample collected on 14\nNov 2002 tested positive for _L. monocytogenes_, a potentially deadly\nbacteria for especially immune suppressed individuals and pregnant women.\n\"The sample is being further analyzed to determine whether or not it\nmatches the outbreak strain,\" the USDA said in a statement.\nThe company said the recalled products were produced between 1 June 2002\nand 6 Nov 2002 and distributed to retail stores and institutions\nnationwide. The product bears establishment code \"P-4340\" inside the USDA\nseal of inspection.\nSpokesman Lynn Kettleson said officials \"assume a goodly portion of the\nproduct was consumed.\"\nOn 2 Nov 2002, the company recalled 200 000 pounds of poultry, after its\nproducts were linked to an outbreak in the Northeast that has killed 7\npeople. USDA said the strain found in both incidents were\n\"indistinguishable.\" Despite the government's findings, the company said\n\"to our knowledge, no one has become ill as a result of consuming these\nproducts.\"\nPilgrim's Pride, the No. 3 poultry producer based in Pittsburg, Texas, was\nalso linked to the listeriosis outbreak. It recalled 27.4 million pounds of\nits Wampler brand turkey and chicken, a record recall. Despite USDA\ntest results finding the listeria outbreak strain at its plant, Pilgrim's\nPride also has said its products were not to blame for the illnesses.\nJack Lambersky's plant in Camden, N.J., was voluntarily closed after the\ninitial recall of 200 000 pounds. USDA said last week it would allow the\nplant to resume operations after inspectors approved the company's new food\nsafety measures.\nDespite the expanded recall, the USDA said the plant remained open because\nthe 14 Nov 2002 sample that tested positive for listeria was actually\nproduced on 30 Aug 2002. \"The plant is still open because all the (USDA)\naction took place at the 2 Nov 2002 recall,\" said Steve Cohen, spokesman\nfor USDA's Food Safetyand Inspection Service. \"The complete plant was\ncleaned up.\"\nThe company said it was working closely with USDA determining the origin of\nthe listeria contamination. \"We are communicating to all of our impacted\ncustomers and are providing instructions on how the should handle the\nproducts covered by the recall,\" the company said in a statement.\nFaced with severe criticism from consumer groups and some Democrats on lax\nenforcement, the USDA said it would increase listeria testing at certain\nplants. About 1 500 meat plants that either do not test for listeria or\nchoose not to share their results with USDA were subject to USDA's\ndirective, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said on 18 Nov. The directive\nwill take effect on 9 Dec 2002.\nThe new directive would not have prevented the listeria recalls at Jack\nLambersky or Pilgrim's Pride because both claim they routinely test their\nplants and products for the bacteria.\n******\n[2]\nDate: 21 Nov 2002\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: Food Safety and Inspection Service Recall (edited)\n<http://www.fsis.usda.gov/OA/recalls/rnrfiles/rnr098-2002.htm>\n\nRecall Notification Report 098-2002 Expanded, 21 Nov 2002\n---------------------------------------------------------------\nProduct(s) Recalled: Fresh and Frozen Ready-To-Eat Turkey and Chicken Products\nIn response to an ongoing food safety investigation, FSIS collected\nmicrobiological investigative sample on 14 Nov 2002, that returned positive\nresults for _Listeria monocytogenes_ on 20 Nov 2002.

Most\nillnesses were in New York, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey, but Michigan,\nMaryland, Ohio, Connecticut, and Delaware also were affected.

And, the story\nadds, the incubation period is much longer, up to 70 days before\nsymptoms appear.\nIn addition to causing miscarriages and stillbirths, Listeria can cause\nfatal blood infections and meningitis.\nAmerican scientists began to take Listeria seriously in 1985, when 18\ndeaths were traced to the eating of Jalisco brand soft cheese. (The\ncompany is now defunct.) There were also 30 stillbirths and deaths of\nnewborns.\nAnother 142 people became ill.\nListeria is carried in the intestines of animals and can easily come in\ncontact with dairy products, uncooked meats, fish, poultry and\nvegetables as well as precooked meats like the ones responsible for the\nAugust\noutbreak. The investigators say they do not know how the Listeria\ncontaminated the cooked meats at Bil Mar Foods.\nThe centralization of food production has turned what might previously\nhave been a small local problem into a global one. Products from the Bil\nMar plant, for example, are distributed all over the United States.\nIn the Bil Mar Foods case, the Agriculture Department left the\nannouncement of the recall to the company. The agency does not announce\nrecalls until it has proof that a sealed product contains the\ndisease-causing bacteria, and it did not have that proof until 31 Dec\n1998, nine days later.\nWhen the company announced the recall, a spokesman for the Agriculture\nDepartment, Andrew Solomon, was cited as saying that reporters who cover\nthe agency were notified and the information was put on the agency's Web\nsite and on its consumer-information line (800-535-4555).\n\nDale Morse, the director of the division of infectious disease of the\nNew York State Health Department, say there can never be enough\nnotification. In Broome County, in upstate New York [he said Meals on\nWheels was still serving the Bil Mar products to elderly clients eight\ndays after the recall, because it had not been notified.\nThe story goes on to say that unlike many other disease-causing\nbacteria, Listeria can grow in a refrigerator that has a normal\ntemperature of 40 degrees, which means leftovers should be reheated.\nPublic health officials strongly urge those at greatest risk from\nListeria to stay away from all soft cheeses,\nincluding feta and blue-veined cheeses like Roquefort and Camembert.\nThey also say that it is essential to cook hot dogs until the internal\ntemperature reaches 165 degrees, by either steaming or frying.

Six adults have died and two\npregnant women have had spontaneous abortions. Reported illness onset\ndates\nwere during August 2-December 13, 1998. CDC and state and local health\ndepartments have identified the vehicle for transmission as hot dogs and\npossibly deli meats produced under many brand names by one manufacturer.\nThis report updates the investigation of this outbreak...\n[MMWR Editorial Note: Healthy persons rarely develop severe illness\nfrom\n_Listeria_. The illness primarily occurs in pregnant women, newborns,\nand\npersons with impaired immunity caused by serious illness, such as\nacquired\nimmunodeficiency syndrome or cancer. _Listeria_ infections during\npregnancy\nmay cause an influenza-like illness with fever and chills, and may lead\nto\nloss of the fetus. In other persons, early symptoms can include fever,\nsevere headache, and stiff neck. Illness can begin 2-8 weeks after\neating\nthe contaminated food.\nConsumers who have the affected product should not eat it, but rather\nshould discard it or return it to the point of purchase. The risk for\ndeveloping _Listeria_ infection after eating a contaminated product is\nlow.\nPersons who have eaten a contaminated product and do not have any\nsymptoms\ndo not need any special medical evaluation or treatment, even if they\nare\nin high-risk groups. However, persons in high-risk groups who have eaten\nthe contaminated product, and within 2 months become ill with fever or\ninfluenza-like illness, should inform their physicians about this\nexposure.\nBecause of this long incubation period, cases may continue to occur and\nbe\nreported for several weeks after an effective recall.\nConsumers who have questions about the recall or the products involved\nshould contact Bil Mar Foods, telephone (800) 247-8339. Persons who have\nquestions about Listeria should call their physicians or their local or\nstate health departments or visit CDC's World-Wide Web site,\n<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/diseases/foodborn/lister.htm>. General\nquestions\nabout meat handling should be directed to the U.S. Department of\nAgriculture's Meat and Poultry Hotline, telephone (800) 535-4555, Monday\nthrough Friday from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. eastern time.\n--\nProMED-mail\ne-mail: promed@usa.healthnet.org\n[This thread had been cut, but the current update informs us of\nadditional\ncases and provides more specific strain characterization information. -\nMod.ES\n......................................es/jw\n\n\n--\n*##########################################################*\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.

I\nhave felt since that it is likely that only the very young, very old and\npregnant women become sick enough to be diagnosed.\n--\nFrances Taylor, MD, MPH\nretired from San Francisco DPH,\nCommunicable Disease Control\n[Many years ago when I first joined MAFF and attended my first annual\nmeeting of the VIOs at Weybridge I remember that Ivor Field, then D/CVL,\npresented one speaker, a VIO from the Midlands, with the comment that his\nwas the only VIC diagnosing listeriosis and would everyone pay careful\nattention. The next year we had some two dozen reports from other parts of\nthe country. - Mod.MHJ\n..................................mhj/es\n--\n*##########################################################*\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.
