Foodstuffs, which owns Pak 'n Save and New World supermarkets, announced today [16 Oct 2014] that the source of the recent _Yersinia pseudotuberculosis_ outbreak appeared to be farm-based. The bacterium is uncommon in New Zealand with only 13 cases notified last year [2013], but about 127 people have been affected and 38 hospitalized during last month's [September 2014] outbreak.\n\n\"In exploring our own supply chain, should the contamination have come from Pam's Lettuce, we can confirm we have been able to narrow our investigation down to a single paddock from the supplier Living Foods,\" the company said in a statement. \"This paddock has been quarantined at our request and further independent testing has been commissioned alongside the MPI [Ministry of Primary Industries] investigation.\"\n\nFoodstuffs said all Pams Fresh Express products on shelves now, or those already bought that were not past their best before dates, were safe for consumption. \"We do understand the frustration those who have suffered from yersiniosis feel and their desire to get answers quickly as to how they became unwell. To ensure the safety of the food sold to our customers, we remain determined to get to the bottom of the cause of the outbreak, regardless of whether our products were involved or not.\"\n\nFoodstuffs expected to have the results from its initial supplier audit review early next week, while sample analysis results from an independent laboratory were expected by the end of the month [October 2014]. \"We hope our results along with the findings of the MPI investigation will give all parties clarity as to how such an incidence could occur.\"\n\nA Foodstuffs investigation had excluded Pams bagged carrots as a likely source of contamination because no one supplier of Pams was responsible for distribution across the country where sickness had been reported. MPI deputy director-general Scott Gallacher said the ministry was drawing on the \"best available\" expertise and information from around the world as it continued to investigate the origins of the outbreak.\n\nHealth data showed the contamination event happened in August 2014 and was identified as an outbreak of illness on 23 Sep 2014. There had been no further confirmed cases since the 1st week of October [2014].\n\nCanterbury medical officer of health Alistair Humphrey had criticised MPI's refusal to release the full list of products under investigation, saying the ministry seemed more concerned about the industry than protecting public health.\n\nGallacher said MPI released 2 reports from ESR [Institute of Environmental and Scientific Research] today [16 Oct 2014] to \"stop the speculation\" about what foods were being investigated. \"It is not a simple situation where we can recall a single product. It is not definitely linked to any one provider, distributor, wholesaler or retailer.\"\n\nHorticulture New Zealand chief executive Peter Silcock said releasing the reports was \"the right thing to do at this time\", but statements from Humphrey earlier this week had been \"very unhelpful\" as they had affected the industry's reputation. \"It's targeted parts of the industry quite unfairly. We're keen to obviously get to the bottom of this as well.\"\n\nInitial information presented by ESR and public health units associated the illness with a range of fresh produce, including lettuce, carrots, tomatoes, apples, cold ready-to-eat meats and dairy products.\n\nESR's initial report, dated 6 Oct 2014, found those who became ill were more likely to have eaten raw lettuce or carrots, including those bagged and marketed under the Pams brand, than those who were not ill. A 2nd report, dated 8 Oct 2014, said those who purchased lettuce from Foodstuffs supermarkets were 2.33 times as likely to become ill than those who bought from Progressive Enterprises supermarkets (including Countdown and Supervalue), while those who bought lettuce from independent supermarkets were 4.08 times as likely to become ill than those buying from Progressive Enterprises.\n\n\"This information is not definitive and should lead to investigation of possible supply or processing in Foodstuffs New Zealand and independent supermarkets,\" the report said. Investigations into the outbreak were continuing.\n\n[Byline: Nicole Mathewson]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Most individuals affected with _Yersinia pseudotuberculosis_ are children or young adults. The most common presentation of this infection is mesenteric lymphadenitis, with fever and right lower quadrant abdominal pain, which can be confused with acute appendicitis. A febrile gastroenteritis may also occur, which has been described as Izumi syndrome in Japan. Late complications may be a reactive arthritis or erythema nodosum.\n\nAlthough many associations had been previously made, one of the strongest studies of the relationship of _Y. pseudotuberculosis_ and food was published in 2004 from Finland (1). The editorial commentary (2) with the paper is a nicely presented discussion on the hazards of infections associated with fresh produce.\n\nThe diagnosis of infection with this bacterium can be made by isolation of the organism from lymph node or stool. Serological tests can be helpful, but cross-reactions are found between yersiniae and other enteric organisms, including some salmonellae.\n\nReferences:\n1.

Foodstuffs, which owns Pak 'n Save and New World supermarkets, announced today [16 Oct 2014] that the source of the recent _Yersinia pseudotuberculosis_ outbreak appeared to be farm-based. The bacterium is uncommon in New Zealand with only 13 cases notified last year [2013], but about 127 people have been affected and 38 hospitalized during last month's [September 2014] outbreak.\n\n\"In exploring our own supply chain, should the contamination have come from Pam's Lettuce, we can confirm we have been able to narrow our investigation down to a single paddock from the supplier Living Foods,\" the company said in a statement. \"This paddock has been quarantined at our request and further independent testing has been commissioned alongside the MPI [Ministry of Primary Industries] investigation.\"\n\nFoodstuffs said all Pams Fresh Express products on shelves now, or those already bought that were not past their best before dates, were safe for consumption. \"We do understand the frustration those who have suffered from yersiniosis feel and their desire to get answers quickly as to how they became unwell. To ensure the safety of the food sold to our customers, we remain determined to get to the bottom of the cause of the outbreak, regardless of whether our products were involved or not.\"\n\nFoodstuffs expected to have the results from its initial supplier audit review early next week, while sample analysis results from an independent laboratory were expected by the end of the month [October 2014]. \"We hope our results along with the findings of the MPI investigation will give all parties clarity as to how such an incidence could occur.\"\n\nA Foodstuffs investigation had excluded Pams bagged carrots as a likely source of contamination because no one supplier of Pams was responsible for distribution across the country where sickness had been reported. MPI deputy director-general Scott Gallacher said the ministry was drawing on the \"best available\" expertise and information from around the world as it continued to investigate the origins of the outbreak.\n\nHealth data showed the contamination event happened in August 2014 and was identified as an outbreak of illness on 23 Sep 2014. There had been no further confirmed cases since the 1st week of October [2014].\n\nCanterbury medical officer of health Alistair Humphrey had criticised MPI's refusal to release the full list of products under investigation, saying the ministry seemed more concerned about the industry than protecting public health.\n\nGallacher said MPI released 2 reports from ESR [Institute of Environmental and Scientific Research] today [16 Oct 2014] to \"stop the speculation\" about what foods were being investigated. \"It is not a simple situation where we can recall a single product. It is not definitely linked to any one provider, distributor, wholesaler or retailer.\"\n\nHorticulture New Zealand chief executive Peter Silcock said releasing the reports was \"the right thing to do at this time\", but statements from Humphrey earlier this week had been \"very unhelpful\" as they had affected the industry's reputation. \"It's targeted parts of the industry quite unfairly. We're keen to obviously get to the bottom of this as well.\"\n\nInitial information presented by ESR and public health units associated the illness with a range of fresh produce, including lettuce, carrots, tomatoes, apples, cold ready-to-eat meats and dairy products.\n\nESR's initial report, dated 6 Oct 2014, found those who became ill were more likely to have eaten raw lettuce or carrots, including those bagged and marketed under the Pams brand, than those who were not ill. A 2nd report, dated 8 Oct 2014, said those who purchased lettuce from Foodstuffs supermarkets were 2.33 times as likely to become ill than those who bought from Progressive Enterprises supermarkets (including Countdown and Supervalue), while those who bought lettuce from independent supermarkets were 4.08 times as likely to become ill than those buying from Progressive Enterprises.\n\n\"This information is not definitive and should lead to investigation of possible supply or processing in Foodstuffs New Zealand and independent supermarkets,\" the report said. Investigations into the outbreak were continuing.\n\n[Byline: Nicole Mathewson]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Most individuals affected with _Yersinia pseudotuberculosis_ are children or young adults. The most common presentation of this infection is mesenteric lymphadenitis, with fever and right lower quadrant abdominal pain, which can be confused with acute appendicitis. A febrile gastroenteritis may also occur, which has been described as Izumi syndrome in Japan. Late complications may be a reactive arthritis or erythema nodosum.\n\nAlthough many associations had been previously made, one of the strongest studies of the relationship of _Y. pseudotuberculosis_ and food was published in 2004 from Finland (1). The editorial commentary (2) with the paper is a nicely presented discussion on the hazards of infections associated with fresh produce.\n\nThe diagnosis of infection with this bacterium can be made by isolation of the organism from lymph node or stool. Serological tests can be helpful, but cross-reactions are found between yersiniae and other enteric organisms, including some salmonellae.\n\nReferences:\n1.

A 2nd report, dated 8 Oct 2014, said those who purchased lettuce from Foodstuffs supermarkets were 2.33 times as likely to become ill than those who bought from Progressive Enterprises supermarkets (including Countdown and Supervalue), while those who bought lettuce from independent supermarkets were 4.08 times as likely to become ill than those buying from Progressive Enterprises.\n\n\"This information is not definitive and should lead to investigation of possible supply or processing in Foodstuffs New Zealand and independent supermarkets,\" the report said.

The most\ncommon presentation of this infection is mesenteric lymphadenitis,\nwith fever and right lower quadrant abdominal pain, which can be\nconfused with acute appendicitis. A febrile gastroenteritis may also\noccur, which has been described as Izumi syndrome in Japan.

Weber (1) describes\nerythema multiforme in yersiniosis that tends to coalesce into\nplaques with a vesicular component in its periphery. This may also be\nassociated with conjunctivitis. Scarlet fever-like rashes with\nerythroderma and subsequent desquamation can also occur.

The editorial commentary\n(4) with the paper is a nicely presented discussion on the hazards of\ninfections associated with fresh produce. The diagnosis of infection\nwith this bacterium can be made by isolation of the organism from\nlymph node or stool.

In Saint\nPetersburg, it is estimated that there are 1.7 rodents/1000 sq.\nmeter, in seaports of the Krasnodar region - 7.5 rodents/1000 sq.\nmeter, in cities of the Jewish Autonomous Region (Birobidzhan) - 16\nrodents/1000 sq. meter, and in Novosibirsk - 0.7 rodents/1000 sq.\nmeter (the standard rate - 0.5).\nEven though the rodent numbers are lower for Novosibirsk than for the\nother regions mentioned, 590 cases of pseudotuberculosis have already\nbeen registered there in 2006 (versus 610 cases in all of 2005).\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[Rodents are a main source of contamination, both in produce\nstorehouses and in the home.

The most\ncommon presentation of this infection is mesenteric lymphadenitis,\nwith fever and right lower quadrant abdominal pain, which can be\nconfused with acute appendicitis. A febrile gastroenteritis may also\noccur, which has been described as Izumi syndrome in Japan. Late\ncomplications may be a reactive arthritis or erythema nodosum.\nCutaneous manifestations of yersiniosis include the above-mentioned\nerythema nodosum and erythema multiforme as well. Both of these can\nbe found with a variety of infectious stimuli. Erythema nodosum\npresents as painful, indurated erythematous circular lesions, usually\non the shins.\nErythema multiforme, as the name implies, results in multi-form\nlesions including classical target-like lesions. Weber (1) describes\nerythema multiforme in yersiniosis that tends to coalesce into\nplaques with a vesicular component in its periphery. This may also be\nassociated with conjunctivitis. Scarlet fever-like rashes with\nerythroderma and subsequent desquamation can also occur. This\nmanifestation can also resemble Kawasaki syndrome (2).\nAlthough many associations had been previously made, one of the\nstrongest studies of the relationship of _Y. pseudotuberculosis_ and\nfood was published in 2004 from Finland (3). The editorial commentary\n(4) with the paper is a nicely presented discussion on the hazards of\ninfections associated with fresh produce. The diagnosis of infection\nwith this bacterium can be made by isolation of the organism from\nlymph node or stool. Serological tests can be helpful, but\ncross-reactions are found between Yersiniae and other enteric\norganisms, including some salmonellae.\n1. Weber L: [Yersinia exanthema] (article in German).

All cases have occurred in African-American infants\nresiding in the same neighborhood in downtown Buffalo. Interviews with\nfamily reveal that most handled chitterlings (chitlins - pork intestine)\nin the days before the infants became ill. We have also cultured\nY. enterocolitica 0:3 from several chitterling samples. During\na similar outbreak in the same neighborhood last year we conducted\na case control study which also implicated chitterlings (p=.003; RR=17).\nThe infants are obviously not eating the chitterlings but are\nbeing exposed via cross contamination from hands to baby bottle. On\ninterview 4/5 admitted that the baby's bottle was in the sink at\nthe same time the chitterlings were being rinsed. Different stores\nand suppliers are involved. Chitterlings are sold raw-frozen, raw-\nunfrozen, or precooked-frozen in 5 or 10lb plastic buckets with\nsnap lids. They do in fact have the standard USDA safe food handling\nlabel printed on the top.\nCDC and Georgia Dept of Health investigated a chitterling-associated\nyersiniosis outbreak also in African-Amer. infants in 1988 in Atlanta's\ndowntown (Lee, LA et al JID 1991; 163:660-663).\nOur control measures have included a press release\nto warn consumers, notification of health care providers in Buffalo,\ncontact with community church leaders and distribution of a\nsafe food handling notice specifically on chitterling preparation\nto the meat markets in the affected area. Physicians and laboratories\nshould consider yersinia in the differential diagnosis of children with\nfebrile diarrhea. Labs in areas where yersiniosis is occasionally\nfound should either routinely screen for it (CIN or MacConkey media)\non all stools or test only if negative for more common enteric\npathogens (salmonella, shigella, campylobacter, E. coli 0157). (The\nlatter is more cost effective.)\nChitterlings are generally eaten around the\nwinter holiday period from Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Year. Sales\nof chitterlings dramatically decline thereafter. We are planning\nan aggressive newsmedia, pamplet campaign Nov.1, 1996 to focus\nattention. Best solution is to advise use of precooked product but\nit is 3 times as expensive.\n--\nStan Kondracki\ne-mail: SFK01@health.state.NY.US\nNew York State Department of Health\nRegional Epidemiology Program\nBureau of Communicable Disease Control\nPhone: +1(518) 473-4439 Fax: +1(518) 474-7381\n............................................................................\n\n*##########################################################*\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.

All cases have occurred in African-American infants\nresiding in the same neighborhood in downtown Buffalo. Interviews with\nfamily reveal that most handled chitterlings (chitlins - pork intestine)\nin the days before the infants became ill. We have also cultured\nY. enterocolitica 0:3 from several chitterling samples. During\na similar outbreak in the same neighborhood last year we conducted\na case control study which also implicated chitterlings (p=.003; RR=17).\nThe infants are obviously not eating the chitterlings but are\nbeing exposed via cross contamination from hands to baby bottle. On\ninterview 4/5 admitted that the baby's bottle was in the sink at\nthe same time the chitterlings were being rinsed. Different stores\nand suppliers are involved. Chitterlings are sold raw-frozen, raw-\nunfrozen, or precooked-frozen in 5 or 10lb plastic buckets with\nsnap lids. They do in fact have the standard USDA safe food handling\nlabel printed on the top.\nCDC and Georgia Dept of Health investigated a chitterling-associated\nyersiniosis outbreak also in African-Amer. infants in 1988 in Atlanta's\ndowntown (Lee, LA et al JID 1991; 163:660-663).\nOur control measures have included a press release\nto warn consumers, notification of health care providers in Buffalo,\ncontact with community church leaders and distribution of a\nsafe food handling notice specifically on chitterling preparation\nto the meat markets in the affected area. Physicians and laboratories\nshould consider yersinia in the differential diagnosis of children with\nfebrile diarrhea. Labs in areas where yersiniosis is occasionally\nfound should either routinely screen for it (CIN or MacConkey media)\non all stools or test only if negative for more common enteric\npathogens (salmonella, shigella, campylobacter, E. coli 0157). (The\nlatter is more cost effective.)\nChitterlings are generally eaten around the\nwinter holiday period from Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Year. Sales\nof chitterlings dramatically decline thereafter. We are planning\nan aggressive newsmedia, pamplet campaign Nov.1, 1996 to focus\nattention. Best solution is to advise use of precooked product but\nit is 3 times as expensive.\n--\nStan Kondracki\ne-mail: SFK01@health.state.NY.US\nNew York State Department of Health\nRegional Epidemiology Program\nBureau of Communicable Disease Control\nPhone: +1(518) 473-4439 Fax: +1(518) 474-7381\n............................................................................\n\n*##########################################################*\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.
