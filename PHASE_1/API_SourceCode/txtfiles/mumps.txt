By 11 Dec 2018, 8 Texas detention facilities and 6 facilities in 5 other states had reported 67 mumps cases to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Health Service Corps (IHSC) or local health departments.\n\nOn 12 Dec 2018, TDSHS contacted CDC to discuss mumps control in detention facilities and facilitate communication with IHSC. During 4-17 Jan 2019, 6 more state health departments reported new cases in detention facilities, which prompted CDC and IHSC to launch a coordinated national outbreak response.\n\nDuring 1 Sep 2018-22 Aug 2019, a total of 898 confirmed and probable mumps cases (1) in adult migrants detained in 57 facilities (18% of 315 U.S. facilities that house ICE detainees*) were reported in 19 states (Figure); an additional 33 cases occurred among staff members. Private companies operated 34 facilities; 19 were county jails that house detained migrants, and 4 were ICE-operated. 44 percent (394) of cases were reported from facilities that house ICE detainees in Texas.\n\nMedian patient age was 25 years (range = 17-67); 846 (94%) were male. Based on detainee custody status during their incubation period (12-25 days before symptom onset), most (758, 84%) patients were exposed while in custody of ICE or another U.S. agency; 43 (5%) were exposed before apprehension; and the custody status at the time of exposure of 97 (11%) was unknown. Among those with data on complications, 79 (15%) of 527 male patients reported orchitis, and at least 13 patients were hospitalized. More than half (576, 64%) of cases were confirmed by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction testing or viral culture testing at CDC, state public health laboratories, Association of Public Health Laboratories-CDC Vaccine Preventable Disease Reference Centers, or commercial laboratories. Sequencing of isolates from 70 patients identified genotype G, the most common mumps genotype detected in the United States since 2006 (2). IHSC provided over 25 000 doses of measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine in response to mumps in 56 facilities.\n\nSince 2015, approximately 150 mumps outbreaks and 16 000 cases have been reported in the United States, typically in close-contact settings such as universities, schools, and athletic events. This is the 1st report of mumps outbreaks in detention facilities.\n\nMMR vaccination efforts differ among detention facilities; facilities should follow local or state health department recommendations for preventing and responding to mumps (3) and should report cases and follow disease control guidance from their health department. Detainees and staff members at increased risk for mumps should be offered MMR vaccine per existing recommendations for vaccination during outbreaks (4,5). MMR vaccine has not been shown to be effective at preventing disease in persons already infected with mumps; facilities should be aware that cases might occur among detainees exposed before vaccination.\n\nHealth departments, CDC, IHSC, and facility health administration can work together to develop appropriate control measures based on local epidemiology and the specific needs of each facility. Identifying and vaccinating close contacts of exposed or symptomatic persons with mumps in detention centers is challenging. IHSC can look up transfer history and facilitate vaccine procurement for detainees in ICE custody upon request from facility health services administrators. CDC is coordinating communication among state and local health departments, IHSC, and other federal partners to mobilize appropriate resources and is providing technical support for implementing appropriate disease control and prevention measures. Effective public health interventions require understanding of facility and custody operations, which often involve frequent transfers of detainees (between facilities and states) and multiple entities with authority for operations and detainee custody.\n\nAs of 22 Aug 2019, mumps outbreaks are ongoing in 15 facilities in 7 states, and new introductions into detention facilities through detainees who are transferred or exposed before being taken into custody continue to occur.\n\n[See URL for references.]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nMary Marshall\n\n[Mumps is a viral illness caused by a paramyxovirus, family Rubulavirus.

DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm6834a4\nhttps://tinyurl.com/yxbkpr2g\n------------------------------------\nOn 12 Oct 2018, 5 confirmed cases of mumps among migrants who had been transferred between 2 detention facilities were reported by the facilities to the Texas Department of State Health Services (TDSHS). By 11 Dec 2018, 8 Texas detention facilities and 6 facilities in 5 other states had reported 67 mumps cases to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Health Service Corps (IHSC) or local health departments.\n\nOn 12 Dec 2018, TDSHS contacted CDC to discuss mumps control in detention facilities and facilitate communication with IHSC. During 4-17 Jan 2019, 6 more state health departments reported new cases in detention facilities, which prompted CDC and IHSC to launch a coordinated national outbreak response.\n\nDuring 1 Sep 2018-22 Aug 2019, a total of 898 confirmed and probable mumps cases (1) in adult migrants detained in 57 facilities (18% of 315 U.S. facilities that house ICE detainees*) were reported in 19 states (Figure); an additional 33 cases occurred among staff members. Private companies operated 34 facilities; 19 were county jails that house detained migrants, and 4 were ICE-operated. 44 percent (394) of cases were reported from facilities that house ICE detainees in Texas.\n\nMedian patient age was 25 years (range = 17-67); 846 (94%) were male. Based on detainee custody status during their incubation period (12-25 days before symptom onset), most (758, 84%) patients were exposed while in custody of ICE or another U.S. agency; 43 (5%) were exposed before apprehension; and the custody status at the time of exposure of 97 (11%) was unknown. Among those with data on complications, 79 (15%) of 527 male patients reported orchitis, and at least 13 patients were hospitalized. More than half (576, 64%) of cases were confirmed by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction testing or viral culture testing at CDC, state public health laboratories, Association of Public Health Laboratories-CDC Vaccine Preventable Disease Reference Centers, or commercial laboratories. Sequencing of isolates from 70 patients identified genotype G, the most common mumps genotype detected in the United States since 2006 (2). IHSC provided over 25 000 doses of measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine in response to mumps in 56 facilities.\n\nSince 2015, approximately 150 mumps outbreaks and 16 000 cases have been reported in the United States, typically in close-contact settings such as universities, schools, and athletic events. This is the 1st report of mumps outbreaks in detention facilities.\n\nMMR vaccination efforts differ among detention facilities; facilities should follow local or state health department recommendations for preventing and responding to mumps (3) and should report cases and follow disease control guidance from their health department. Detainees and staff members at increased risk for mumps should be offered MMR vaccine per existing recommendations for vaccination during outbreaks (4,5). MMR vaccine has not been shown to be effective at preventing disease in persons already infected with mumps; facilities should be aware that cases might occur among detainees exposed before vaccination.\n\nHealth departments, CDC, IHSC, and facility health administration can work together to develop appropriate control measures based on local epidemiology and the specific needs of each facility. Identifying and vaccinating close contacts of exposed or symptomatic persons with mumps in detention centers is challenging. IHSC can look up transfer history and facilitate vaccine procurement for detainees in ICE custody upon request from facility health services administrators. CDC is coordinating communication among state and local health departments, IHSC, and other federal partners to mobilize appropriate resources and is providing technical support for implementing appropriate disease control and prevention measures. Effective public health interventions require understanding of facility and custody operations, which often involve frequent transfers of detainees (between facilities and states) and multiple entities with authority for operations and detainee custody.\n\nAs of 22 Aug 2019, mumps outbreaks are ongoing in 15 facilities in 7 states, and new introductions into detention facilities through detainees who are transferred or exposed before being taken into custody continue to occur.\n\n[See URL for references.]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nMary Marshall\n\n[Mumps is a viral illness caused by a paramyxovirus, family Rubulavirus. It spreads through direct contact with saliva or respiratory droplets from the mouth, nose, or throat. An infected person can spread the virus by\n- coughing, sneezing, or talking\n- sharing items that may have saliva on them, such as water bottles or cups\n- participating in close-contact activities with others, such as playing sports, dancing, or kissing\n- touching objects or surfaces with unwashed hands that are then touched by others\n\nAn infected person can likely spread mumps from a few days before their salivary glands begin to swell to up to 5 days after the swelling begins. A person with mumps should limit their contact with others during this time.\n\nBefore the U.S. mumps vaccination program started in 1967, about 186 000 cases were reported each year, and many more unreported cases occurred. The disease caused complications, such as permanent deafness in children, and, occasionally, encephalitis, which could rarely result in death. Since the pre-vaccine era, there has been a more than 99% decrease in mumps cases in the United States. From year to year, the number of mumps cases can range from roughly a couple hundred to a couple thousand. However, outbreaks still occur, even among highly vaccinated populations.\n\nOrchitis occurs in approximately 20-30% of unvaccinated and 6-7% of vaccinated post-pubertal male mumps patients [In this report, 15% of the cases were noted to have this complication].

DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm6834a4\nhttps://tinyurl.com/yxbkpr2g\n------------------------------------\nOn 12 Oct 2018, 5 confirmed cases of mumps among migrants who had been transferred between 2 detention facilities were reported by the facilities to the Texas Department of State Health Services (TDSHS). By 11 Dec 2018, 8 Texas detention facilities and 6 facilities in 5 other states had reported 67 mumps cases to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Health Service Corps (IHSC) or local health departments.\n\nOn 12 Dec 2018, TDSHS contacted CDC to discuss mumps control in detention facilities and facilitate communication with IHSC. During 4-17 Jan 2019, 6 more state health departments reported new cases in detention facilities, which prompted CDC and IHSC to launch a coordinated national outbreak response.\n\nDuring 1 Sep 2018-22 Aug 2019, a total of 898 confirmed and probable mumps cases (1) in adult migrants detained in 57 facilities (18% of 315 U.S. facilities that house ICE detainees*) were reported in 19 states (Figure); an additional 33 cases occurred among staff members. Private companies operated 34 facilities; 19 were county jails that house detained migrants, and 4 were ICE-operated. 44 percent (394) of cases were reported from facilities that house ICE detainees in Texas.\n\nMedian patient age was 25 years (range = 17-67); 846 (94%) were male. Based on detainee custody status during their incubation period (12-25 days before symptom onset), most (758, 84%) patients were exposed while in custody of ICE or another U.S. agency; 43 (5%) were exposed before apprehension; and the custody status at the time of exposure of 97 (11%) was unknown. Among those with data on complications, 79 (15%) of 527 male patients reported orchitis, and at least 13 patients were hospitalized. More than half (576, 64%) of cases were confirmed by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction testing or viral culture testing at CDC, state public health laboratories, Association of Public Health Laboratories-CDC Vaccine Preventable Disease Reference Centers, or commercial laboratories. Sequencing of isolates from 70 patients identified genotype G, the most common mumps genotype detected in the United States since 2006 (2). IHSC provided over 25 000 doses of measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine in response to mumps in 56 facilities.\n\nSince 2015, approximately 150 mumps outbreaks and 16 000 cases have been reported in the United States, typically in close-contact settings such as universities, schools, and athletic events. This is the 1st report of mumps outbreaks in detention facilities.\n\nMMR vaccination efforts differ among detention facilities; facilities should follow local or state health department recommendations for preventing and responding to mumps (3) and should report cases and follow disease control guidance from their health department. Detainees and staff members at increased risk for mumps should be offered MMR vaccine per existing recommendations for vaccination during outbreaks (4,5). MMR vaccine has not been shown to be effective at preventing disease in persons already infected with mumps; facilities should be aware that cases might occur among detainees exposed before vaccination.\n\nHealth departments, CDC, IHSC, and facility health administration can work together to develop appropriate control measures based on local epidemiology and the specific needs of each facility. Identifying and vaccinating close contacts of exposed or symptomatic persons with mumps in detention centers is challenging. IHSC can look up transfer history and facilitate vaccine procurement for detainees in ICE custody upon request from facility health services administrators. CDC is coordinating communication among state and local health departments, IHSC, and other federal partners to mobilize appropriate resources and is providing technical support for implementing appropriate disease control and prevention measures. Effective public health interventions require understanding of facility and custody operations, which often involve frequent transfers of detainees (between facilities and states) and multiple entities with authority for operations and detainee custody.\n\nAs of 22 Aug 2019, mumps outbreaks are ongoing in 15 facilities in 7 states, and new introductions into detention facilities through detainees who are transferred or exposed before being taken into custody continue to occur.\n\n[See URL for references.]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nMary Marshall\n\n[Mumps is a viral illness caused by a paramyxovirus, family Rubulavirus. It spreads through direct contact with saliva or respiratory droplets from the mouth, nose, or throat. An infected person can spread the virus by\n- coughing, sneezing, or talking\n- sharing items that may have saliva on them, such as water bottles or cups\n- participating in close-contact activities with others, such as playing sports, dancing, or kissing\n- touching objects or surfaces with unwashed hands that are then touched by others\n\nAn infected person can likely spread mumps from a few days before their salivary glands begin to swell to up to 5 days after the swelling begins. A person with mumps should limit their contact with others during this time.\n\nBefore the U.S. mumps vaccination program started in 1967, about 186 000 cases were reported each year, and many more unreported cases occurred. The disease caused complications, such as permanent deafness in children, and, occasionally, encephalitis, which could rarely result in death. Since the pre-vaccine era, there has been a more than 99% decrease in mumps cases in the United States. From year to year, the number of mumps cases can range from roughly a couple hundred to a couple thousand. However, outbreaks still occur, even among highly vaccinated populations.\n\nOrchitis occurs in approximately 20-30% of unvaccinated and 6-7% of vaccinated post-pubertal male mumps patients [In this report, 15% of the cases were noted to have this complication]. In 60% to 83% of males with mumps orchitis, only one testis is affected. Mumps orchitis has not been linked to infertility but may result in testicular atrophy and hypo-fertility (excerpted from https://www.cdc.gov/mumps/hcp.html).\n\nDetention facilities such as those on the US-Mexico border provide the perfect environment for mumps and other highly infectious diseases such as influenza and TB to spread among detainees.

Nebraska Public Health Department manages Cedar, Dixon, Thurston and Wayne counties, while Four Corners Health Department's jurisdiction includes Butler, Polk, York and Seward counties.\n\nOf the 30 cases, most were among people attending a wedding in northeast Nebraska and at a work environment in the Four Corners Health Department jurisdiction.\n\nThe DHHS said they are working to investigate the cases as they work with the local health departments.\n\nIn 2018, there were only 12 reported cases of mumps and 6 in 2017. There were 49 cases in 2016.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[ProMED HealthMap: Nebraska, United States: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/229]\nSee Also\nMumps update (10): USA (TX) outbreak update 20190801.6601222\nMumps update (09): USA (FL) quarantine 20190609.6508541\nMumps update (08): USA (CO, TX), Asia (Malaysia) 20190526.6487675\nMumps update (07): Europe (Ireland), USA (IN, PA, UT) 20190420.6429994\nMumps update (06): USA (PA) outbreak update 20190330.6394589\nMumps update (05): Europe (UK) USA (PA) university 20190327.6384687\nMumps update (04): USA (PA) outbreak 20190321.6379783\nMumps update (03): USA (PA, TX), Europe (Ireland) 20190305.6350670\nMumps update (02): USA (CO, TX), Europe (Ireland) 20190221.63294342018\n.................................................lk/msp/jh", "reports": [{"diseases": ["unknown", "other", "measles", "mumps", "rubella", "encephalitis"], "syndromes": ["encephalitis"], "event_date": ["2021-03-11 00:00:00", "2019-03-16 00:00:00", "2018-12-16 00:00:00", "2018-12-12 00:00:00", "2004-01-17 20:19:00", "2043-03-16 00:00:00", "2006-03-16 00:00:00", "2015-03-16 00:00:00", "2019-03-16 00:00:00", "1967-03-16 00:00:00", "2019-03-16 00:00:00", "2018-03-16 00:00:00", "2017-03-16 00:00:00", "2016-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-07 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "United States", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Nebraska", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Texas", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Ireland", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "TEXAS", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "U.S.", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Polk", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "US", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "United States : http://healthmap.org/promed/p/245", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Mexico", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Malaysia", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "http://dx.doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm6834a4", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "the United States", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "UK", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "USA", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "6601222", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Mumps update (10): USA (TX) outbreak update", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=6601222", "date": "2019-03-05 18:58:32", "main_text": "MUMPS UPDATE (03): USA (PENNSYLVANIA, TEXAS), EUROPE (IRELAND)\n***************************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nIn this update:\nUSA\n---\n[1] USA summary\n[2] Pennsylvania\n[3] Texas\n\nEurope\n------\n[4] Ireland\n\n******\n[1] USA Summary\nDate: Wed 27 Feb 2019\nSource: Precision Vaccinations [abridged, edited]\nhttps://www.precisionvaccinations.com/58-mumps-cases-reported-cdc-and-28-cases-reported-ice-during-2019\n\n\nThe ongoing measles outbreak now has anti-vaxx competition from another vaccine-preventable disease, mumps. From 1-31 Jan 2019, mumps infections have been reported in 58 people from 18 states to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n\nThis new data is good news when compared with 2018 when the CDC confirmed 2251 mumps cases. But, this CDC data may not include mumps cases reported by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency during 2019. So far, ICE facilities in Colorado and Texas have reported mumps cases.\n\nThe leading states reporting mumps cases during 2019 include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\n- Arkansas: The Department of Health said cases of the mumps have been confirmed on the campus of the University of Arkansas at Fayetteville. A total of 3 cases have been confirmed and there is another suspected case of the mumps at the university over the last few weeks.\n\n- Georgia: Nancy Nydam, Director of Communications for The Georgia Department of Public Health, wrote, \"An outbreak of mumps has been reported at the facility and the investigation is ongoing.\"\n\n- Illinois: 8 cases were reported in 2 locations; 6 at Crystal Lake church and 2 at the McHenry County Correctional Facility. Health officials are working to determine if the 2 locations are related.\n\n- Indiana: 2 confirmed cases of the mumps have been found at Indiana University in Bloomington, health officials said.\n\n- Montana: 3 cases of mumps are confirmed in children attending Bozeman public schools, and health officials are investigating other possible cases.\n\n- North Dakota: The North Dakota Department of Health has confirmed 5 cases of mumps statewide, 3 of them in Stark County and 2 in Williams County.\n\n- Pennsylvania: Officials at a Delaware County elementary school are warning parents after a student was diagnosed with mumps. Officials at Garrett-Ford Elementary in Drexel Hill sent an email to parents regarding the health concern.\n\n- Utah: Southern Utah health officials say they have a reported case of mumps that popped up at an elementary school in St. George earlier this month [February 2019]. However, they believe because of the long delay before symptoms show, there could be more cases.\n\n- Wisconsin: A Marquette University student has contracted mumps. In an email to students, the school said the infected student lives in one of the residence halls.\n\nInternationally, Ireland has reported a mumps outbreak during 2019. According to reporting by the Irish Times, there have been 278 mumps cases in the 1st 6 weeks of 2019, compared with 43 for the same time in 2018, according to the HSE's Health Protection Surveillance Centre. A total of 9 outbreaks were reported in school, university, community, and private home settings, with the majority of cases occurring among teenagers and young adults.\n\nA major factor contributing to mumps outbreaks is being in a crowded environment or living in a dormitory with a person who is infectious with mumps, says the CDC.\n\nOne mumps outbreak in Ireland forced the cancellation of a schools rugby match in south Dublin, while Trinity College, DCU, and schools in Co Louth have also been affected. During 2018, various colleges have reported mumps cases, such as Cincinnati, Emory, Harvard, James Madison University, Michigan, Northern Colorado, Northeastern University, Oklahoma University, Penn State, TCU, Texas State and Western Illinois University.\n\nAccording to the previous study, another potential cause of these mumps outbreaks is 'waning-immunization'. A previous study from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health found that vaccine-derived immune protection against mumps persists on average about 27 years, after the last administered dose.\n\nIn response to the expanding number of mumps outbreaks, the CDC released guidance in October 2017, regarding when the 3rd dose of mumps vaccine is appropriate. This new CDC guidance did not recommend a 3rd MMR dose outside of a 'confirmed mumps outbreak'.\n\nAnother reason for mumps outbreaks could be under-vaccinations by international travelers.\n\nThe mumps component of the MMR vaccine has reported being 88% effective when a person gets 2 vaccine doses.\n\n[Byline: Don Ward Hackett]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[2] Pennsylvania: Temple University on alert after students test positive for mumps\nDate: Fri 1 Mar 2019\nSource: 6abc [abridged, edited]\nhttps://6abc.com/health/temple-on-alert-after-students-test-positive-for-mumps/5162886/\n\n\nStudents, faculty and staff at Temple University have been notified about cases of mumps on campus.

The number of cases has been rising steadily in recent weeks, with 278 in the 1st 6 weeks of the year. Last year [2018] there had been 52 cases by the end of February.

Since the pre-vaccine era, there has been a more than 99% decrease in mumps cases in the United States. Since the 2-dose vaccination program was introduced in 1989, mumps cases have ranged year to year from a couple of hundred to several thousand. However, in recent years, there has been an increase in the number of reported cases, from 229 cases in 2012 to 6366 cases in 2016. The recent increase has been mainly due to multiple mumps outbreaks reported across the country in settings where people often have close contact with one another, like college campuses.\" CDC (https://www.cdc.gov/mumps/outbreaks.html). -

From 1-31 Jan 2019, mumps infections have been reported in 58 people from 18 states to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n\nThis new data is good news when compared with 2018 when the CDC confirmed 2251 mumps cases. But, this CDC data may not include mumps cases reported by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency during 2019. So far, ICE facilities in Colorado and Texas have reported mumps cases.\n\nThe leading states reporting mumps cases during 2019 include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\n- Arkansas: The Department of Health said cases of the mumps have been confirmed on the campus of the University of Arkansas at Fayetteville. A total of 3 cases have been confirmed and there is another suspected case of the mumps at the university over the last few weeks.\n\n- Georgia: Nancy Nydam, Director of Communications for The Georgia Department of Public Health, wrote, \"An outbreak of mumps has been reported at the facility and the investigation is ongoing.\"\n\n- Illinois: 8 cases were reported in 2 locations; 6 at Crystal Lake church and 2 at the McHenry County Correctional Facility. Health officials are working to determine if the 2 locations are related.\n\n- Indiana: 2 confirmed cases of the mumps have been found at Indiana University in Bloomington, health officials said.\n\n- Montana: 3 cases of mumps are confirmed in children attending Bozeman public schools, and health officials are investigating other possible cases.\n\n- North Dakota: The North Dakota Department of Health has confirmed 5 cases of mumps statewide, 3 of them in Stark County and 2 in Williams County.\n\n- Pennsylvania: Officials at a Delaware County elementary school are warning parents after a student was diagnosed with mumps. Officials at Garrett-Ford Elementary in Drexel Hill sent an email to parents regarding the health concern.\n\n- Utah: Southern Utah health officials say they have a reported case of mumps that popped up at an elementary school in St. George earlier this month [February 2019]. However, they believe because of the long delay before symptoms show, there could be more cases.\n\n- Wisconsin: A Marquette University student has contracted mumps. In an email to students, the school said the infected student lives in one of the residence halls.\n\nInternationally, Ireland has reported a mumps outbreak during 2019. According to reporting by the Irish Times, there have been 278 mumps cases in the 1st 6 weeks of 2019, compared with 43 for the same time in 2018, according to the HSE's Health Protection Surveillance Centre. A total of 9 outbreaks were reported in school, university, community, and private home settings, with the majority of cases occurring among teenagers and young adults.\n\nA major factor contributing to mumps outbreaks is being in a crowded environment or living in a dormitory with a person who is infectious with mumps, says the CDC.\n\nOne mumps outbreak in Ireland forced the cancellation of a schools rugby match in south Dublin, while Trinity College, DCU, and schools in Co Louth have also been affected. During 2018, various colleges have reported mumps cases, such as Cincinnati, Emory, Harvard, James Madison University, Michigan, Northern Colorado, Northeastern University, Oklahoma University, Penn State, TCU, Texas State and Western Illinois University.\n\nAccording to the previous study, another potential cause of these mumps outbreaks is 'waning-immunization'. A previous study from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health found that vaccine-derived immune protection against mumps persists on average about 27 years, after the last administered dose.\n\nIn response to the expanding number of mumps outbreaks, the CDC released guidance in October 2017, regarding when the 3rd dose of mumps vaccine is appropriate. This new CDC guidance did not recommend a 3rd MMR dose outside of a 'confirmed mumps outbreak'.\n\nAnother reason for mumps outbreaks could be under-vaccinations by international travelers.\n\nThe mumps component of the MMR vaccine has reported being 88% effective when a person gets 2 vaccine doses.\n\n[Byline: Don Ward Hackett]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[2] Pennsylvania: Temple University on alert after students test positive for mumps\nDate: Fri 1 Mar 2019\nSource: 6abc [abridged, edited]\nhttps://6abc.com/health/temple-on-alert-after-students-test-positive-for-mumps/5162886/\n\n\nStudents, faculty and staff at Temple University have been notified about cases of mumps on campus.

From 1-31 Jan 2019, mumps infections have been reported in 58 people from 18 states to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n\nThis new data is good news when compared with 2018 when the CDC confirmed 2251 mumps cases. But, this CDC data may not include mumps cases reported by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency during 2019. So far, ICE facilities in Colorado and Texas have reported mumps cases.\n\nThe leading states reporting mumps cases during 2019 include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\n- Arkansas: The Department of Health said cases of the mumps have been confirmed on the campus of the University of Arkansas at Fayetteville. A total of 3 cases have been confirmed and there is another suspected case of the mumps at the university over the last few weeks.\n\n- Georgia: Nancy Nydam, Director of Communications for The Georgia Department of Public Health, wrote, \"An outbreak of mumps has been reported at the facility and the investigation is ongoing.\"\n\n- Illinois: 8 cases were reported in 2 locations; 6 at Crystal Lake church and 2 at the McHenry County Correctional Facility. Health officials are working to determine if the 2 locations are related.\n\n- Indiana: 2 confirmed cases of the mumps have been found at Indiana University in Bloomington, health officials said.\n\n- Montana: 3 cases of mumps are confirmed in children attending Bozeman public schools, and health officials are investigating other possible cases.\n\n- North Dakota: The North Dakota Department of Health has confirmed 5 cases of mumps statewide, 3 of them in Stark County and 2 in Williams County.\n\n- Pennsylvania: Officials at a Delaware County elementary school are warning parents after a student was diagnosed with mumps. Officials at Garrett-Ford Elementary in Drexel Hill sent an email to parents regarding the health concern.\n\n- Utah: Southern Utah health officials say they have a reported case of mumps that popped up at an elementary school in St. George earlier this month [February 2019]. However, they believe because of the long delay before symptoms show, there could be more cases.\n\n- Wisconsin: A Marquette University student has contracted mumps. In an email to students, the school said the infected student lives in one of the residence halls.\n\nInternationally, Ireland has reported a mumps outbreak during 2019. According to reporting by the Irish Times, there have been 278 mumps cases in the 1st 6 weeks of 2019, compared with 43 for the same time in 2018, according to the HSE's Health Protection Surveillance Centre. A total of 9 outbreaks were reported in school, university, community, and private home settings, with the majority of cases occurring among teenagers and young adults.\n\nA major factor contributing to mumps outbreaks is being in a crowded environment or living in a dormitory with a person who is infectious with mumps, says the CDC.\n\nOne mumps outbreak in Ireland forced the cancellation of a schools rugby match in south Dublin, while Trinity College, DCU, and schools in Co Louth have also been affected. During 2018, various colleges have reported mumps cases, such as Cincinnati, Emory, Harvard, James Madison University, Michigan, Northern Colorado, Northeastern University, Oklahoma University, Penn State, TCU, Texas State and Western Illinois University.\n\nAccording to the previous study, another potential cause of these mumps outbreaks is 'waning-immunization'. A previous study from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health found that vaccine-derived immune protection against mumps persists on average about 27 years, after the last administered dose.\n\nIn response to the expanding number of mumps outbreaks, the CDC released guidance in October 2017, regarding when the 3rd dose of mumps vaccine is appropriate. This new CDC guidance did not recommend a 3rd MMR dose outside of a 'confirmed mumps outbreak'.\n\nAnother reason for mumps outbreaks could be under-vaccinations by international travelers.\n\nThe mumps component of the MMR vaccine has reported being 88% effective when a person gets 2 vaccine doses.\n\n[Byline: Don Ward Hackett]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[2] Pennsylvania: Temple University on alert after students test positive for mumps\nDate: Fri 1 Mar 2019\nSource: 6abc [abridged, edited]\nhttps://6abc.com/health/temple-on-alert-after-students-test-positive-for-mumps/5162886/\n\n\nStudents, faculty and staff at Temple University have been notified about cases of mumps on campus.

The number of cases has been rising steadily in recent weeks, with 278 in the 1st 6 weeks of the year. Last year [2018] there had been 52 cases by the end of February. There were 576 cases in total last year [2018].\n\n[Byline : Catherine Sanz]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Also see ProMED-mail Mumps update (02): USA (CO, TX), Europe (Ireland) 20190221.6329434 for more on the outbreak in Ireland. - Mod.LK]\n\n[\"Before the U.S. mumps vaccination program started in 1967, about 186 000 cases were reported each year, but the actual number of cases was likely much higher due to underreporting. Since the pre-vaccine era, there has been a more than 99% decrease in mumps cases in the United States. Since the 2-dose vaccination program was introduced in 1989, mumps cases have ranged year to year from a couple of hundred to several thousand. However, in recent years, there has been an increase in the number of reported cases, from 229 cases in 2012 to 6366 cases in 2016.

From 1-31 Jan 2019, mumps infections have been reported in 58 people from 18 states to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n\nThis new data is good news when compared with 2018 when the CDC confirmed 2251 mumps cases. But, this CDC data may not include mumps cases reported by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency during 2019. So far, ICE facilities in Colorado and Texas have reported mumps cases.\n\nThe leading states reporting mumps cases during 2019 include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\n- Arkansas: The Department of Health said cases of the mumps have been confirmed on the campus of the University of Arkansas at Fayetteville. A total of 3 cases have been confirmed and there is another suspected case of the mumps at the university over the last few weeks.\n\n- Georgia: Nancy Nydam, Director of Communications for The Georgia Department of Public Health, wrote, \"An outbreak of mumps has been reported at the facility and the investigation is ongoing.\"\n\n- Illinois: 8 cases were reported in 2 locations; 6 at Crystal Lake church and 2 at the McHenry County Correctional Facility. Health officials are working to determine if the 2 locations are related.\n\n- Indiana: 2 confirmed cases of the mumps have been found at Indiana University in Bloomington, health officials said.\n\n- Montana: 3 cases of mumps are confirmed in children attending Bozeman public schools, and health officials are investigating other possible cases.\n\n- North Dakota: The North Dakota Department of Health has confirmed 5 cases of mumps statewide, 3 of them in Stark County and 2 in Williams County.\n\n- Pennsylvania: Officials at a Delaware County elementary school are warning parents after a student was diagnosed with mumps. Officials at Garrett-Ford Elementary in Drexel Hill sent an email to parents regarding the health concern.\n\n- Utah: Southern Utah health officials say they have a reported case of mumps that popped up at an elementary school in St. George earlier this month [February 2019]. However, they believe because of the long delay before symptoms show, there could be more cases.\n\n- Wisconsin: A Marquette University student has contracted mumps. In an email to students, the school said the infected student lives in one of the residence halls.\n\nInternationally, Ireland has reported a mumps outbreak during 2019. According to reporting by the Irish Times, there have been 278 mumps cases in the 1st 6 weeks of 2019, compared with 43 for the same time in 2018, according to the HSE's Health Protection Surveillance Centre. A total of 9 outbreaks were reported in school, university, community, and private home settings, with the majority of cases occurring among teenagers and young adults.\n\nA major factor contributing to mumps outbreaks is being in a crowded environment or living in a dormitory with a person who is infectious with mumps, says the CDC.\n\nOne mumps outbreak in Ireland forced the cancellation of a schools rugby match in south Dublin, while Trinity College, DCU, and schools in Co Louth have also been affected. During 2018, various colleges have reported mumps cases, such as Cincinnati, Emory, Harvard, James Madison University, Michigan, Northern Colorado, Northeastern University, Oklahoma University, Penn State, TCU, Texas State and Western Illinois University.\n\nAccording to the previous study, another potential cause of these mumps outbreaks is 'waning-immunization'. A previous study from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health found that vaccine-derived immune protection against mumps persists on average about 27 years, after the last administered dose.\n\nIn response to the expanding number of mumps outbreaks, the CDC released guidance in October 2017, regarding when the 3rd dose of mumps vaccine is appropriate. This new CDC guidance did not recommend a 3rd MMR dose outside of a 'confirmed mumps outbreak'.\n\nAnother reason for mumps outbreaks could be under-vaccinations by international travelers.\n\nThe mumps component of the MMR vaccine has reported being 88% effective when a person gets 2 vaccine doses.\n\n[Byline: Don Ward Hackett]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[2] Pennsylvania: Temple University on alert after students test positive for mumps\nDate: Fri 1 Mar 2019\nSource: 6abc [abridged, edited]\nhttps://6abc.com/health/temple-on-alert-after-students-test-positive-for-mumps/5162886/\n\n\nStudents, faculty and staff at Temple University have been notified about cases of mumps on campus.

The number of cases has been rising steadily in recent weeks, with 278 in the 1st 6 weeks of the year. Last year [2018] there had been 52 cases by the end of February. There were 576 cases in total last year [2018].\n\n[Byline : Catherine Sanz]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Also see ProMED-mail Mumps update (02): USA (CO, TX), Europe (Ireland) 20190221.6329434 for more on the outbreak in Ireland. - Mod.LK]\n\n[\"Before the U.S. mumps vaccination program started in 1967, about 186 000 cases were reported each year, but the actual number of cases was likely much higher due to underreporting. Since the pre-vaccine era, there has been a more than 99% decrease in mumps cases in the United States. Since the 2-dose vaccination program was introduced in 1989, mumps cases have ranged year to year from a couple of hundred to several thousand. However, in recent years, there has been an increase in the number of reported cases, from 229 cases in 2012 to 6366 cases in 2016.

From 1-31 Jan 2019, mumps infections have been reported in 58 people from 18 states to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n\nThis new data is good news when compared with 2018 when the CDC confirmed 2251 mumps cases. But, this CDC data may not include mumps cases reported by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency during 2019. So far, ICE facilities in Colorado and Texas have reported mumps cases.\n\nThe leading states reporting mumps cases during 2019 include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\n- Arkansas: The Department of Health said cases of the mumps have been confirmed on the campus of the University of Arkansas at Fayetteville. A total of 3 cases have been confirmed and there is another suspected case of the mumps at the university over the last few weeks.\n\n- Georgia: Nancy Nydam, Director of Communications for The Georgia Department of Public Health, wrote, \"An outbreak of mumps has been reported at the facility and the investigation is ongoing.\"\n\n- Illinois: 8 cases were reported in 2 locations; 6 at Crystal Lake church and 2 at the McHenry County Correctional Facility. Health officials are working to determine if the 2 locations are related.\n\n- Indiana: 2 confirmed cases of the mumps have been found at Indiana University in Bloomington, health officials said.\n\n- Montana: 3 cases of mumps are confirmed in children attending Bozeman public schools, and health officials are investigating other possible cases.\n\n- North Dakota: The North Dakota Department of Health has confirmed 5 cases of mumps statewide, 3 of them in Stark County and 2 in Williams County.\n\n- Pennsylvania: Officials at a Delaware County elementary school are warning parents after a student was diagnosed with mumps. Officials at Garrett-Ford Elementary in Drexel Hill sent an email to parents regarding the health concern.\n\n- Utah: Southern Utah health officials say they have a reported case of mumps that popped up at an elementary school in St. George earlier this month [February 2019]. However, they believe because of the long delay before symptoms show, there could be more cases.\n\n- Wisconsin: A Marquette University student has contracted mumps. In an email to students, the school said the infected student lives in one of the residence halls.\n\nInternationally, Ireland has reported a mumps outbreak during 2019. According to reporting by the Irish Times, there have been 278 mumps cases in the 1st 6 weeks of 2019, compared with 43 for the same time in 2018, according to the HSE's Health Protection Surveillance Centre. A total of 9 outbreaks were reported in school, university, community, and private home settings, with the majority of cases occurring among teenagers and young adults.\n\nA major factor contributing to mumps outbreaks is being in a crowded environment or living in a dormitory with a person who is infectious with mumps, says the CDC.\n\nOne mumps outbreak in Ireland forced the cancellation of a schools rugby match in south Dublin, while Trinity College, DCU, and schools in Co Louth have also been affected. During 2018, various colleges have reported mumps cases, such as Cincinnati, Emory, Harvard, James Madison University, Michigan, Northern Colorado, Northeastern University, Oklahoma University, Penn State, TCU, Texas State and Western Illinois University.\n\nAccording to the previous study, another potential cause of these mumps outbreaks is 'waning-immunization'. A previous study from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health found that vaccine-derived immune protection against mumps persists on average about 27 years, after the last administered dose.\n\nIn response to the expanding number of mumps outbreaks, the CDC released guidance in October 2017, regarding when the 3rd dose of mumps vaccine is appropriate. This new CDC guidance did not recommend a 3rd MMR dose outside of a 'confirmed mumps outbreak'.\n\nAnother reason for mumps outbreaks could be under-vaccinations by international travelers.\n\nThe mumps component of the MMR vaccine has reported being 88% effective when a person gets 2 vaccine doses.\n\n[Byline: Don Ward Hackett]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[2] Pennsylvania: Temple University on alert after students test positive for mumps\nDate: Fri 1 Mar 2019\nSource: 6abc [abridged, edited]\nhttps://6abc.com/health/temple-on-alert-after-students-test-positive-for-mumps/5162886/\n\n\nStudents, faculty and staff at Temple University have been notified about cases of mumps on campus.

The number of cases has been rising steadily in recent weeks, with 278 in the 1st 6 weeks of the year. Last year [2018] there had been 52 cases by the end of February. There were 576 cases in total last year [2018].\n\n[Byline : Catherine Sanz]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Also see ProMED-mail Mumps update (02): USA (CO, TX), Europe (Ireland) 20190221.6329434 for more on the outbreak in Ireland. - Mod.LK]\n\n[\"Before the U.S. mumps vaccination program started in 1967, about 186 000 cases were reported each year, but the actual number of cases was likely much higher due to underreporting. Since the pre-vaccine era, there has been a more than 99% decrease in mumps cases in the United States. Since the 2-dose vaccination program was introduced in 1989, mumps cases have ranged year to year from a couple of hundred to several thousand. However, in recent years, there has been an increase in the number of reported cases, from 229 cases in 2012 to 6366 cases in 2016.

From 1-31 Jan 2019, mumps infections have been reported in 58 people from 18 states to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n\nThis new data is good news when compared with 2018 when the CDC confirmed 2251 mumps cases. But, this CDC data may not include mumps cases reported by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency during 2019. So far, ICE facilities in Colorado and Texas have reported mumps cases.\n\nThe leading states reporting mumps cases during 2019 include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\n- Arkansas: The Department of Health said cases of the mumps have been confirmed on the campus of the University of Arkansas at Fayetteville. A total of 3 cases have been confirmed and there is another suspected case of the mumps at the university over the last few weeks.\n\n- Georgia: Nancy Nydam, Director of Communications for The Georgia Department of Public Health, wrote, \"An outbreak of mumps has been reported at the facility and the investigation is ongoing.\"\n\n- Illinois: 8 cases were reported in 2 locations; 6 at Crystal Lake church and 2 at the McHenry County Correctional Facility. Health officials are working to determine if the 2 locations are related.\n\n- Indiana: 2 confirmed cases of the mumps have been found at Indiana University in Bloomington, health officials said.\n\n- Montana: 3 cases of mumps are confirmed in children attending Bozeman public schools, and health officials are investigating other possible cases.\n\n- North Dakota: The North Dakota Department of Health has confirmed 5 cases of mumps statewide, 3 of them in Stark County and 2 in Williams County.\n\n- Pennsylvania: Officials at a Delaware County elementary school are warning parents after a student was diagnosed with mumps. Officials at Garrett-Ford Elementary in Drexel Hill sent an email to parents regarding the health concern.\n\n- Utah: Southern Utah health officials say they have a reported case of mumps that popped up at an elementary school in St. George earlier this month [February 2019]. However, they believe because of the long delay before symptoms show, there could be more cases.\n\n- Wisconsin: A Marquette University student has contracted mumps. In an email to students, the school said the infected student lives in one of the residence halls.\n\nInternationally, Ireland has reported a mumps outbreak during 2019. According to reporting by the Irish Times, there have been 278 mumps cases in the 1st 6 weeks of 2019, compared with 43 for the same time in 2018, according to the HSE's Health Protection Surveillance Centre. A total of 9 outbreaks were reported in school, university, community, and private home settings, with the majority of cases occurring among teenagers and young adults.\n\nA major factor contributing to mumps outbreaks is being in a crowded environment or living in a dormitory with a person who is infectious with mumps, says the CDC.\n\nOne mumps outbreak in Ireland forced the cancellation of a schools rugby match in south Dublin, while Trinity College, DCU, and schools in Co Louth have also been affected. During 2018, various colleges have reported mumps cases, such as Cincinnati, Emory, Harvard, James Madison University, Michigan, Northern Colorado, Northeastern University, Oklahoma University, Penn State, TCU, Texas State and Western Illinois University.\n\nAccording to the previous study, another potential cause of these mumps outbreaks is 'waning-immunization'. A previous study from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health found that vaccine-derived immune protection against mumps persists on average about 27 years, after the last administered dose.\n\nIn response to the expanding number of mumps outbreaks, the CDC released guidance in October 2017, regarding when the 3rd dose of mumps vaccine is appropriate. This new CDC guidance did not recommend a 3rd MMR dose outside of a 'confirmed mumps outbreak'.\n\nAnother reason for mumps outbreaks could be under-vaccinations by international travelers.\n\nThe mumps component of the MMR vaccine has reported being 88% effective when a person gets 2 vaccine doses.\n\n[Byline: Don Ward Hackett]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[2] Pennsylvania: Temple University on alert after students test positive for mumps\nDate: Fri 1 Mar 2019\nSource: 6abc [abridged, edited]\nhttps://6abc.com/health/temple-on-alert-after-students-test-positive-for-mumps/5162886/\n\n\nStudents, faculty and staff at Temple University have been notified about cases of mumps on campus.

The number of cases has been rising steadily in recent weeks, with 278 in the 1st 6 weeks of the year. Last year [2018] there had been 52 cases by the end of February. There were 576 cases in total last year [2018].\n\n[Byline : Catherine Sanz]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Also see ProMED-mail Mumps update (02): USA (CO, TX), Europe (Ireland) 20190221.6329434 for more on the outbreak in Ireland. - Mod.LK]\n\n[\"Before the U.S. mumps vaccination program started in 1967, about 186 000 cases were reported each year, but the actual number of cases was likely much higher due to underreporting. Since the pre-vaccine era, there has been a more than 99% decrease in mumps cases in the United States. Since the 2-dose vaccination program was introduced in 1989, mumps cases have ranged year to year from a couple of hundred to several thousand. However, in recent years, there has been an increase in the number of reported cases, from 229 cases in 2012 to 6366 cases in 2016.

From 1-31 Jan 2019, mumps infections have been reported in 58 people from 18 states to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n\nThis new data is good news when compared with 2018 when the CDC confirmed 2251 mumps cases. But, this CDC data may not include mumps cases reported by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency during 2019. So far, ICE facilities in Colorado and Texas have reported mumps cases.\n\nThe leading states reporting mumps cases during 2019 include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\n- Arkansas: The Department of Health said cases of the mumps have been confirmed on the campus of the University of Arkansas at Fayetteville. A total of 3 cases have been confirmed and there is another suspected case of the mumps at the university over the last few weeks.\n\n- Georgia: Nancy Nydam, Director of Communications for The Georgia Department of Public Health, wrote, \"An outbreak of mumps has been reported at the facility and the investigation is ongoing.\"\n\n- Illinois: 8 cases were reported in 2 locations; 6 at Crystal Lake church and 2 at the McHenry County Correctional Facility. Health officials are working to determine if the 2 locations are related.\n\n- Indiana: 2 confirmed cases of the mumps have been found at Indiana University in Bloomington, health officials said.\n\n- Montana: 3 cases of mumps are confirmed in children attending Bozeman public schools, and health officials are investigating other possible cases.\n\n- North Dakota: The North Dakota Department of Health has confirmed 5 cases of mumps statewide, 3 of them in Stark County and 2 in Williams County.\n\n- Pennsylvania: Officials at a Delaware County elementary school are warning parents after a student was diagnosed with mumps. Officials at Garrett-Ford Elementary in Drexel Hill sent an email to parents regarding the health concern.\n\n- Utah: Southern Utah health officials say they have a reported case of mumps that popped up at an elementary school in St. George earlier this month [February 2019]. However, they believe because of the long delay before symptoms show, there could be more cases.\n\n- Wisconsin: A Marquette University student has contracted mumps. In an email to students, the school said the infected student lives in one of the residence halls.\n\nInternationally, Ireland has reported a mumps outbreak during 2019. According to reporting by the Irish Times, there have been 278 mumps cases in the 1st 6 weeks of 2019, compared with 43 for the same time in 2018, according to the HSE's Health Protection Surveillance Centre. A total of 9 outbreaks were reported in school, university, community, and private home settings, with the majority of cases occurring among teenagers and young adults.\n\nA major factor contributing to mumps outbreaks is being in a crowded environment or living in a dormitory with a person who is infectious with mumps, says the CDC.\n\nOne mumps outbreak in Ireland forced the cancellation of a schools rugby match in south Dublin, while Trinity College, DCU, and schools in Co Louth have also been affected. During 2018, various colleges have reported mumps cases, such as Cincinnati, Emory, Harvard, James Madison University, Michigan, Northern Colorado, Northeastern University, Oklahoma University, Penn State, TCU, Texas State and Western Illinois University.\n\nAccording to the previous study, another potential cause of these mumps outbreaks is 'waning-immunization'. A previous study from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health found that vaccine-derived immune protection against mumps persists on average about 27 years, after the last administered dose.\n\nIn response to the expanding number of mumps outbreaks, the CDC released guidance in October 2017, regarding when the 3rd dose of mumps vaccine is appropriate. This new CDC guidance did not recommend a 3rd MMR dose outside of a 'confirmed mumps outbreak'.\n\nAnother reason for mumps outbreaks could be under-vaccinations by international travelers.\n\nThe mumps component of the MMR vaccine has reported being 88% effective when a person gets 2 vaccine doses.\n\n[Byline: Don Ward Hackett]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[2] Pennsylvania: Temple University on alert after students test positive for mumps\nDate: Fri 1 Mar 2019\nSource: 6abc [abridged, edited]\nhttps://6abc.com/health/temple-on-alert-after-students-test-positive-for-mumps/5162886/\n\n\nStudents, faculty and staff at Temple University have been notified about cases of mumps on campus.

The number of cases has been rising steadily in recent weeks, with 278 in the 1st 6 weeks of the year. Last year [2018] there had been 52 cases by the end of February. There were 576 cases in total last year [2018].\n\n[Byline : Catherine Sanz]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Also see ProMED-mail Mumps update (02): USA (CO, TX), Europe (Ireland) 20190221.6329434 for more on the outbreak in Ireland. - Mod.LK]\n\n[\"Before the U.S. mumps vaccination program started in 1967, about 186 000 cases were reported each year, but the actual number of cases was likely much higher due to underreporting. Since the pre-vaccine era, there has been a more than 99% decrease in mumps cases in the United States. Since the 2-dose vaccination program was introduced in 1989, mumps cases have ranged year to year from a couple of hundred to several thousand. However, in recent years, there has been an increase in the number of reported cases, from 229 cases in 2012 to 6366 cases in 2016.

This brings the total number of mumps cases to 15.\n\nAll of the individuals infected with mumps reside in New Castle County.\n\nNine of the 15 persons with mumps attended either the 10 Feb or 3 Mar 2018 social dance (Baile Mejicano) that took place at the Chase Center on the Riverfront in Wilmington. Two of the remaining 4 individuals live with someone who attended one of the dances, and the source of the mumps virus exposure for the remaining 4 individuals is still under investigation.\n\nMumps is an acute viral infection spread through saliva or mucus from the mouth, nose, or throat. An infected person can spread the virus by coughing, sneezing, talking, sharing items such as cups or eating utensils with others, and touching objects or surfaces with unwashed hands that are then touched by others.\n\nSymptoms typically start with a few days of fever, headache, muscle aches, tiredness, and loss of appetite, followed by swollen salivary glands, which results in puffy cheeks and a swollen jaw. Symptoms typically appear 16-18 days after infection, but can range from 12-25 days after infection. Some people with mumps may not have any symptoms. Most people with mumps recover completely in a few weeks. However, mumps can occasionally cause complications, especially in adults.\n\nPeople known or suspected to have mumps should stay away from school or work until 5 days after the onset of swollen salivary glands as there is no specific treatment for mumps.\n\nThe CDC recommends children get 2 doses of MMR vaccine, starting with the 1st dose at 12-15 months of age and the 2nd dose at 4-6 years of age. Teens and adults who did not get the recommended MMR vaccines per the above schedule should be vaccinated so they are up to date. During outbreaks, CDC also recommends that those at highest risk due to exposure to people with mumps should receive a 3rd dose of MMR.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[As of 25 Apr 2018, cases number 19. All 19 individuals reside in New Castle County. The age ranges of adults with the mumps virus are 21-57 years old. Additionally, there was one child under the age of 5 infected. According to the Delaware News https://news.delaware.gov/2018/04/24/four-mumps-cases-identified-bringing-total-19/, this is the 1st time that more than 3 mumps cases have been recorded during any calendar year since at least 2005. - Mod.LK\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail of the United States can be found at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/106 and Delaware, United States at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/211.]\n\n******\n[3] Virginia, William and Mary College\nDate: Wed 25 Apr 2018\nSource: The Virginia Gazette [edited]\nhttp://www.vagazette.com/news/va-vg-wm-mumps-20180428-story.html\n\n\nThere has been a case of reported mumps at the College of William and Mary.\n\nThe announcement was sent out in an email by Virginia Wells, director of the student health center at William and Mary, and Virginia Ambler, vice president of student affairs, on 24 Apr 2018. The email said the Peninsula Health District identified a case of mumps, and the student has since been isolated. Larry Hill, a spokesman for the Peninsula Health District, said they are working with the college on this case. ...\n\nWells said in her email people known to have had contact with the sick student have been notified, but since college campuses are a close and compact environment, it's possible other students may have been exposed.\n\nIn Wells and Ambler's email, they recommended students to review their immunization status and contact their doctor to receive the vaccine as needed. This vaccine is usually to children at age 12 months and again between the ages of 4-6 years and is 88% effective in persons having received 2 doses. So, someone who received a full immunization may still develop mumps.\n\nThe Virginia Department of Health said people who are exposed to mumps may not show symptoms for 12-25 days, and those infected can transmit mumps to others 2 days before symptoms appear. The email from Wells and Ambler suggested contacting your doctor and self-isolating until your doctor directs otherwise if you begin to have mumps-like symptoms.\n\n\"The university has taken all appropriate and recommended steps, including sharing this information with the campus community,\" the email said. \"We will provide additional updates or recommendations if needed.\"\n\nUpdate April 26\n----------\nA new announcement from Wells and Ambler said more cases of mumps have been reported on campus. The students who contracted the virus have been isolated, as with the 1st case.\n\nWhile Hill said Peninsula Health could not release the exact number of students who contracted mumps, there were several cases reported.\n\n[Byline: Amelia Heymann]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n\n[HealthMap/ProMED-mail map:\nVirginia, United States: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/247]\nSee Also\nMumps update (02): USA (VA,DE) resurgence 20180323.5704564\nMumps update: USA 20180220.5638266\n2017\n-----\nMumps update (37): USA, New Zealand 20171230.5528344\nMumps update (36): USA (HI) school 20171221.5518587\nMumps update (35): USA, UK, Pacific (NZ, Polynesia) 20171209.5493522\nMumps update (34): Canada, USA (AK,TX) 20171125.5464364\nMumps update (33): USA (NY,DC,HI) CDC 20171115.5444251\nMumps update (32): South America, USA, New Zealand 20171110.5435146\nMumps update (31): USA, MMR 3rd dose, Canada 20171027.5407525\nMumps update (30): USA, New Zealand 20171022.5396070\nMumps update (29): USA (New York), Pacific (New Zealand, Malaysia) 20171014.5381315\nMumps update (28): Canada, [Byline: Pamela McGowan\nUSA 20171001.5352710\nMumps update (27): Pacific (New Zealand), USA (HI, AK) 20170925.5340444\nMumps update (26): USA (TX) Canada (MB,BC) 20170919.5325095\nMumps update (25): Hawai'i (Hawai'I Island), New Zealand (AU) 20170907.5300162\nMumps update (24): Australia (QL), New Zealand (OT), Brazil (AM) 20170820.5262239\nMumps update (23): New Zealand (AU), USA (TX) 20170722.5197236\nMumps update (22): New Zealand, USA 20170708.5160387\nMumps update (21): USA (OR,HI,CA) Europe (UK) 20170623.5126427\nMumps update (20): USA (IL, NY, MA) 20170609.5095537\nMumps update (19): Europe (UK), USA (HI,PA,CA) 20170603.5080591\nMumps update (18): USA 20170520.5049677\nMumps update (17): USA 20170502.5007199\nMumps update (16): USA (TX, MN) 20170423.4988318\nMumps update (15): New Zealand, USA 20170408.4958345\nMumps update (14): Australia (QL), USA 20170330.4935375\nMumps update (13): Portugal, Canada, USA, analysis 20170326.4924853\nMumps update (12): Canada (ON) USA (IL,AR) 20170324.4922098\nMumps update (11): USA 20170319.4911532\nMumps update (10) 20170314.4900923\nMumps update (09) 20170312.4895943\nMumps update (08): Canada, USA, comment 20170305.4880865\nMumps update (07): Canada, USA 20170303.4875855\nMumps update (06): USA 20170227.4864176\nMumps update (05): USA (PA, MO -

This brings the total number of mumps cases to 15.\n\nAll of the individuals infected with mumps reside in New Castle County.\n\nNine of the 15 persons with mumps attended either the 10 Feb or 3 Mar 2018 social dance (Baile Mejicano) that took place at the Chase Center on the Riverfront in Wilmington. Two of the remaining 4 individuals live with someone who attended one of the dances, and the source of the mumps virus exposure for the remaining 4 individuals is still under investigation.\n\nMumps is an acute viral infection spread through saliva or mucus from the mouth, nose, or throat. An infected person can spread the virus by coughing, sneezing, talking, sharing items such as cups or eating utensils with others, and touching objects or surfaces with unwashed hands that are then touched by others.\n\nSymptoms typically start with a few days of fever, headache, muscle aches, tiredness, and loss of appetite, followed by swollen salivary glands, which results in puffy cheeks and a swollen jaw. Symptoms typically appear 16-18 days after infection, but can range from 12-25 days after infection. Some people with mumps may not have any symptoms. Most people with mumps recover completely in a few weeks. However, mumps can occasionally cause complications, especially in adults.\n\nPeople known or suspected to have mumps should stay away from school or work until 5 days after the onset of swollen salivary glands as there is no specific treatment for mumps.\n\nThe CDC recommends children get 2 doses of MMR vaccine, starting with the 1st dose at 12-15 months of age and the 2nd dose at 4-6 years of age.

The email said the Peninsula Health District identified a case of mumps, and the student has since been isolated. Larry Hill, a spokesman for the Peninsula Health District, said they are working with the college on this case. ...\n\nWells said in her email people known to have had contact with the sick student have been notified, but since college campuses are a close and compact environment, it's possible other students may have been exposed.\n\nIn Wells and Ambler's email, they recommended students to review their immunization status and contact their doctor to receive the vaccine as needed.

So, someone who received a full immunization may still develop mumps.\n\nThe Virginia Department of Health said people who are exposed to mumps may not show symptoms for 12-25 days, and those infected can transmit mumps to others 2 days before symptoms appear. The email from Wells and Ambler suggested contacting your doctor and self-isolating until your doctor directs otherwise if you begin to have mumps-like symptoms.\n\n\"The university has taken all appropriate and recommended steps, including sharing this information with the campus community,\" the email said. \"We will provide additional updates or recommendations if needed.\"\n\nUpdate April 26\n----------\nA new announcement from Wells and Ambler said more cases of mumps have been reported on campus.

This brings the total number of mumps cases to 15.\n\nAll of the individuals infected with mumps reside in New Castle County.\n\nNine of the 15 persons with mumps attended either the 10 Feb or 3 Mar 2018 social dance (Baile Mejicano) that took place at the Chase Center on the Riverfront in Wilmington. Two of the remaining 4 individuals live with someone who attended one of the dances, and the source of the mumps virus exposure for the remaining 4 individuals is still under investigation.\n\nMumps is an acute viral infection spread through saliva or mucus from the mouth, nose, or throat. An infected person can spread the virus by coughing, sneezing, talking, sharing items such as cups or eating utensils with others, and touching objects or surfaces with unwashed hands that are then touched by others.\n\nSymptoms typically start with a few days of fever, headache, muscle aches, tiredness, and loss of appetite, followed by swollen salivary glands, which results in puffy cheeks and a swollen jaw. Symptoms typically appear 16-18 days after infection, but can range from 12-25 days after infection. Some people with mumps may not have any symptoms. Most people with mumps recover completely in a few weeks. However, mumps can occasionally cause complications, especially in adults.\n\nPeople known or suspected to have mumps should stay away from school or work until 5 days after the onset of swollen salivary glands as there is no specific treatment for mumps.\n\nThe CDC recommends children get 2 doses of MMR vaccine, starting with the 1st dose at 12-15 months of age and the 2nd dose at 4-6 years of age. Teens and adults who did not get the recommended MMR vaccines per the above schedule should be vaccinated so they are up to date.

The email said the Peninsula Health District identified a case of mumps, and the student has since been isolated. Larry Hill, a spokesman for the Peninsula Health District, said they are working with the college on this case. ...\n\nWells said in her email people known to have had contact with the sick student have been notified, but since college campuses are a close and compact environment, it's possible other students may have been exposed.\n\nIn Wells and Ambler's email, they recommended students to review their immunization status and contact their doctor to receive the vaccine as needed. This vaccine is usually to children at age 12 months and again between the ages of 4-6 years and is 88% effective in persons having received 2 doses. So, someone who received a full immunization may still develop mumps.\n\nThe Virginia Department of Health said people who are exposed to mumps may not show symptoms for 12-25 days, and those infected can transmit mumps to others 2 days before symptoms appear. The email from Wells and Ambler suggested contacting your doctor and self-isolating until your doctor directs otherwise if you begin to have mumps-like symptoms.\n\n\"The university has taken all appropriate and recommended steps, including sharing this information with the campus community,\" the email said. \"We will provide additional updates or recommendations if needed.\"\n\nUpdate April 26\n----------\nA new announcement from Wells and Ambler said more cases of mumps have been reported on campus.

This brings the total number of mumps cases to 15.\n\nAll of the individuals infected with mumps reside in New Castle County.\n\nNine of the 15 persons with mumps attended either the 10 Feb or 3 Mar 2018 social dance (Baile Mejicano) that took place at the Chase Center on the Riverfront in Wilmington. Two of the remaining 4 individuals live with someone who attended one of the dances, and the source of the mumps virus exposure for the remaining 4 individuals is still under investigation.\n\nMumps is an acute viral infection spread through saliva or mucus from the mouth, nose, or throat. An infected person can spread the virus by coughing, sneezing, talking, sharing items such as cups or eating utensils with others, and touching objects or surfaces with unwashed hands that are then touched by others.\n\nSymptoms typically start with a few days of fever, headache, muscle aches, tiredness, and loss of appetite, followed by swollen salivary glands, which results in puffy cheeks and a swollen jaw. Symptoms typically appear 16-18 days after infection, but can range from 12-25 days after infection. Some people with mumps may not have any symptoms. Most people with mumps recover completely in a few weeks. However, mumps can occasionally cause complications, especially in adults.\n\nPeople known or suspected to have mumps should stay away from school or work until 5 days after the onset of swollen salivary glands as there is no specific treatment for mumps.\n\nThe CDC recommends children get 2 doses of MMR vaccine, starting with the 1st dose at 12-15 months of age and the 2nd dose at 4-6 years of age.

According to the Delaware News https://news.delaware.gov/2018/04/24/four-mumps-cases-identified-bringing-total-19/, this is the 1st time that more than 3 mumps cases have been recorded during any calendar year since at least 2005. - Mod.LK\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail of the United States can be found at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/106 and Delaware, United States at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/211.]\n\n******\n[3] Virginia, William and Mary College\nDate: Wed 25 Apr 2018\nSource: The Virginia Gazette [edited]\nhttp://www.vagazette.com/news/va-vg-wm-mumps-20180428-story.html\n\n\nThere has been a case of reported mumps at the College of William and Mary.\n\nThe announcement was sent out in an email by Virginia Wells, director of the student health center at William and Mary, and Virginia Ambler, vice president of student affairs, on 24 Apr 2018. The email said the Peninsula Health District identified a case of mumps, and the student has since been isolated. Larry Hill, a spokesman for the Peninsula Health District, said they are working with the college on this case. ...\n\nWells said in her email people known to have had contact with the sick student have been notified, but since college campuses are a close and compact environment, it's possible other students may have been exposed.\n\nIn Wells and Ambler's email, they recommended students to review their immunization status and contact their doctor to receive the vaccine as needed. This vaccine is usually to children at age 12 months and again between the ages of 4-6 years and is 88% effective in persons having received 2 doses. So, someone who received a full immunization may still develop mumps.\n\nThe Virginia Department of Health said people who are exposed to mumps may not show symptoms for 12-25 days, and those infected can transmit mumps to others 2 days before symptoms appear. The email from Wells and Ambler suggested contacting your doctor and self-isolating until your doctor directs otherwise if you begin to have mumps-like symptoms.\n\n\"The university has taken all appropriate and recommended steps, including sharing this information with the campus community,\" the email said. \"We will provide additional updates or recommendations if needed.\"\n\nUpdate April 26\n----------\nA new announcement from Wells and Ambler said more cases of mumps have been reported on campus. The students who contracted the virus have been isolated, as with the 1st case.\n\nWhile Hill said Peninsula Health could not release the exact number of students who contracted mumps, there were several cases reported.\n\n[Byline: Amelia Heymann]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n\n[HealthMap/ProMED-mail map:\nVirginia, United States: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/247]\nSee Also\nMumps update (02): USA (VA,DE) resurgence 20180323.5704564\nMumps update: USA 20180220.5638266\n2017\n-----\nMumps update (37): USA, New Zealand 20171230.5528344\nMumps update (36): USA (HI) school 20171221.5518587\nMumps update (35): USA, UK, Pacific (NZ, Polynesia) 20171209.5493522\nMumps update (34): Canada, USA (AK,TX) 20171125.5464364\nMumps update (33): USA (NY,DC,HI) CDC 20171115.5444251\nMumps update (32): South America, USA, New Zealand 20171110.5435146\nMumps update (31): USA, MMR 3rd dose, Canada 20171027.5407525\nMumps update (30): USA, New Zealand 20171022.5396070\nMumps update (29): USA (New York), Pacific (New Zealand, Malaysia) 20171014.5381315\nMumps update (28): Canada, [Byline: Pamela McGowan\nUSA 20171001.5352710\nMumps update (27): Pacific (New Zealand), USA (HI, AK) 20170925.5340444\nMumps update (26): USA (TX) Canada (MB,BC) 20170919.5325095\nMumps update (25): Hawai'i (Hawai'I Island), New Zealand (AU) 20170907.5300162\nMumps update (24): Australia (QL), New Zealand (OT), Brazil (AM) 20170820.5262239\nMumps update (23): New Zealand (AU), USA (TX) 20170722.5197236\nMumps update (22): New Zealand, USA 20170708.5160387\nMumps update (21): USA (OR,HI,CA) Europe (UK) 20170623.5126427\nMumps update (20): USA (IL, NY, MA) 20170609.5095537\nMumps update (19): Europe (UK), USA (HI,PA,CA) 20170603.5080591\nMumps update (18): USA 20170520.5049677\nMumps update (17): USA 20170502.5007199\nMumps update (16): USA (TX, MN) 20170423.4988318\nMumps update (15): New Zealand, USA 20170408.4958345\nMumps update (14): Australia (QL), USA 20170330.4935375\nMumps update (13): Portugal, Canada, USA, analysis 20170326.4924853\nMumps update (12): Canada (ON) USA (IL,AR) 20170324.4922098\nMumps update (11): USA 20170319.4911532\nMumps update (10) 20170314.4900923\nMumps update (09) 20170312.4895943\nMumps update (08): Canada, USA, comment 20170305.4880865\nMumps update (07): Canada, USA 20170303.4875855\nMumps update (06): USA 20170227.4864176\nMumps update (05): USA (PA, MO - RFI), Canada (ON, AB) 20170223.4860461\nMumps update (04): USA (WA), New Zealand 20170211.4830961\nMumps - USA (03): (AR) 20170205.4817357\nMumps - USA (02) 20170129.4801141\nMumps - USA (01): (WA,TX) 20170110.4753366\n.................................................sb/lk/msp/ml", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "mumps"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2619-03-16 00:00:00", "2018-03-16 00:00:00", "2018-04-25 00:00:00", "2018-04-24 00:00:00", "2021-04-26 00:00:00", "2017-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-25 00:00:00", "2021-03-08 00:00:00", "2021-03-07 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-01 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "VA", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "VIRGINIA", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Brazil", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Portugal", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Jalisco", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "http://healthmap.org/promed/p/106", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Malaysia", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Canada", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "USA", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "United States", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Virginia", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Delaware", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Australia", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Mexico", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "DELAWARE", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "US", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "UK", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Pacific", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Wilmington", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "DC", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "New Zealand", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "New York", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "the United States", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Polynesia", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "5704564", "headline": "PRO/EDR> Mumps update (02): USA (VA,DE) resurgence", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=5704564", "date": "2017-11-10 11:18:50", "main_text": "MUMPS UPDATE (32): SOUTH AMERICA, USA, NEW ZEALAND\n**************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nIn this update:\n[1] South America (Bolivia)\n[2] USA (Washington)\n[3] USA (District of Columbia)\n[4] New Zealand\n\n******\n[1] South America (Bolivia)\nDate: Wed 1 Nov 2017\nSource: Pagina Siete [in Spanish, trans.

According to data from the Ministry of Health, the number of reported cases until now is 3 times higher compared to figures recorded 5 years ago.\n\n\"We've had an important outbreak of mumps this year [2017],\" pointed out Adolfo Zarate, Head of the Epidemiology area of the Ministry of Health, who also mentioned that during this year 2044 cases of mumps have been reported. This is 3 times the figure for 2013, when a similar outbreak took place, but only 776 cases were reported. Mr Zarate explained that this explosive condition is because of the change of season, and also because non-immunized people may gather, so this may generate the high number of cases.\n\nYesterday [31 Oct 2017], La Paz Health Service (SEDES, according to its Spanish initials) reported that the mumps vaccine, which is included within the MRM package (measles, rubella, and mumps) only confers 80 percent protection. The vaccine is administered to children between 12 and 24 months of age, and a booster dose is given when they are 4 years old.\n\nThe most affected departments are La Paz, 1698 cases; Santa Cruz, 221 cases, and Cochabamba. For this reason, Mr Zarate urged the (symptomatic) population to go to health centers in order to have timely therapy.\n\nIn La Paz city, SEDES reported last week that this is an alarming situation, since \"there is an explosive and persistent outbreak\".\n\nMumps is a viral disease that is transmitted from person to person through saliva (droplets). Affected persons most commonly present with the following symptoms: fever, sore throat, parotid gland enlargement (inflammation), and loss of appetite.\n\nMr Zarate also recommended that all affected persons must get rest if they develop symptoms, since male subjects may develop orchitis (testis inflammation) or ovaritis (ovarian inflammation), which may lead -- in a small percentage of cases -- to infertility.\n\nHe also advised that affected persons must use masks; they must also avoid sharing cutlery and dishes, and thoroughly wash their hands. It is also important to disinfect the household using detergents, in order to prevent transmission of the disease to other members of the family.\n\nMr Zarate also recommended that sanitary triage must be established in educational facilities, so that if parents, teachers, or school authorities find a symptomatic student, he/she must be immediately sent home and be isolated for at least 10 days.\n\nThe disease may occur at any age in a non-immunized person, but most commonly affected individuals are those less than 20 years of age.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Maps of Bolivia can be seen at http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/americas/bolivia_admin_2006.jpg and http://healthmap.org/promed/p/5. - Mod.LK]\n\n******\n[2] USA (Washington)\nDate: Thu 2 Nov 2017\nSource: iFIBER One News [edited]\nhttp://www.ifiberone.com/columbia_basin/mumps-and-whooping-cough-a-problem-in/youtube_71b3dcd4-c002-11e7-9a61-ff27becf4d65.html\n\n\nGrant County [Washington] saw an extraordinary amount of mumps cases this year [2017] with 45.

So, we've just taken that extra precaution.\"\n\nMumps spreads through saliva or mucus, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Symptoms include fever, headaches, and swollen and tender glands under the ears, the CDC's website notes.\n\nGeorgetown officials asked infected students to cloister themselves for 5 days after the appearance of initial symptoms, a note to the campus from Vince WinklerPrins, assistant vice president for student health, said.\n\n\"We will continue to monitor and support these students,\" WinklerPrins said.\n\nIn an email sent to its campus community, Catholic said residential students who had reported mumps symptoms have been moved to an unoccupied space, in an attempt to limit exposure.\n\n\"Students are able to return to rooms and classes after a 5-day period,\" the email stated.\n\nCatholic's students were also briefed on how someone infected with mumps can spread the virus: by coughing or sharing a drink, for example. They were advised to keep their hands clean and to not share their utensils.\n\nThe University of Virginia [U-Va] has also recently urged students to take precautions after 2 suspected cases were identified.

Dr Herman, said this was the worst outbreak since 1994. \"This is quite a large outbreak, and something we're very concerned about, and trying our best to implement public health measures to try to contain,\" Herman said.\n\nShe said Auckland was essentially free of the viral disease even late last year [2016], but the outbreak began after being picked up overseas. Herman said it particularly came from the Pacific Islands -- mostly Fiji, and later Tonga -- where the mumps vaccine was not available.\n\nShe said there have also been \"massive\" outbreaks in the US and the UK, which has spread easily through universities, she said.\n\n\"In terms of where the mumps infection is occurring, it's actually all throughout the world. New Zealand has been immune to it until late last year [2016] and early this year. Because we've had a vulnerable population here who have not been fully immunised with the MMR vaccine, it's allowed community spread to be well established.\n\n\"We are importing mumps, as well as probably exporting it as well.\"\n\nHerman said it was not possible to know if the rates of the disease have peaked.\n\nBut she said if people have not received the MMR vaccine, to do so immediately. Other ways to combat the spread include washing hands, covering coughs and cleaning commonly used items.\n\nHerman says for most adults, it's a mild illness. However, a small proportion can develop complications including meningitis or encephalitis. Young children are more at risk of developing harmful outcomes.\n\n[Byline: Jordan Bond]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[This outbreak is a consequence of introduction of mumps into a community with low vaccination coverage. More often, mumps outbreaks are the consequence of waning immunity in young adults. But the Auckland outbreak is a reminder that even with elimination of mumps (and measles) from a country, high immunization levels must be maintained.\n\nMaps of New Zealand can be seen at http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/dc/NZTerritorialAuthorities.png and http://healthmap.org/promed/p/606. - Mod.LK]\nSee Also\nMumps update (31): USA, MMR 3rd dose, Canada 20171027.5407525\nMumps update (30): USA, New Zealand 20171022.5396070\nMumps update (29): USA (New York), Pacific (New Zealand, Malaysia) 20171014.5381315\nMumps update (28): Canada, USA 20171001.5352710\nMumps update (27): Pacific (New Zealand), USA (HI, AK) 20170925.5340444\nMumps update (26): USA (TX) Canada (MB,BC) 20170919.5325095\nMumps update (25): Hawai'i (Hawai'i Island), New Zealand (AU) 20170907.5300162\nMumps update (24): Australia (QL), New Zealand (OT), Brazil (AM) 20170820.5262239\nMumps update (23): New Zealand (AU), USA (TX) 20170722.5197236\nMumps update (22): New Zealand, USA 20170708.5160387\nMumps update (21): USA (OR,HI,CA) Europe (UK) 20170623.5126427\nMumps update (20): USA (IL, NY, MA) 20170609.5095537\nMumps update (19): Europe (UK), USA (HI,PA,CA) 20170603.5080591\nMumps update (18): USA 20170520.5049677\nMumps update (17): USA 20170502.5007199\nMumps update (16): USA (TX, MN) 20170423.4988318\nMumps update (15): New Zealand, USA 20170408.4958345\nMumps update (14): Australia (QL), USA 20170330.4935375\nMumps update (13): Portugal, Canada, USA, analysis 20170326.4924853\nMumps update (12): Canada (ON) USA (IL,AR) 20170324.4922098\nMumps update (11): USA 20170319.4911532\nMumps update (10) 20170314.4900923\nMumps update (09) 20170312.4895943\nMumps update (08): Canada, USA, comment 20170305.4880865\nMumps update (07): Canada, USA 20170303.4875855\nMumps update (06): USA 20170227.4864176\nMumps update (05): USA (PA, MO - RFI), Canada (ON, AB) 20170223.4860461\nMumps update (04): USA (WA), New Zealand 20170211.4830961\nMumps - USA (03): (AR) 20170205.4817357\nMumps - USA (02) 20170129.4801141\nMumps - USA (01): (WA,TX) 20170110.4753366\n.................................................sb/lk/mj/jh", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "measles", "mumps", "pertussis", "rubella", "encephalitis", "meningitis"], "syndromes": ["encephalitis", "meningitis"], "event_date": ["2032-03-16 00:00:00", "2044-03-16 00:00:00", "2013-03-16 00:00:00", "2017-03-16 00:00:00", "1698-03-16 00:00:00", "2006-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-01-01 00:00:00", "1994-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-25 00:00:00", "2021-03-08 00:00:00", "2021-03-07 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-01 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Washington DC", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "NEW ZEALAND", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Fiji", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Brazil", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Portugal", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Tonga", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "NZ", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Malaysia", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Canada", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "USA", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Australia", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Washington", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "La Paz", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "US", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "UK", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Santa Cruz", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "SOUTH AMERICA", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Royal City", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "DC", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "New Zealand", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Bolivia", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "New York", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Grant County", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "District of Columbia", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "5638266", "headline": "PRO/EDR> Mumps update: USA", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=5638266", "date": "2017-11-10 11:18:50", "main_text": "MUMPS UPDATE (32): SOUTH AMERICA, USA, NEW ZEALAND\n**************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nIn this update:\n[1] South America (Bolivia)\n[2] USA (Washington)\n[3] USA (District of Columbia)\n[4] New Zealand\n\n******\n[1] South America (Bolivia)\nDate: Wed 1 Nov 2017\nSource: Pagina Siete [in Spanish, trans.

It is also important to disinfect the household using detergents, in order to prevent transmission of the disease to other members of the family.\n\nMr Zarate also recommended that sanitary triage must be established in educational facilities, so that if parents, teachers, or school authorities find a symptomatic student, he/she must be immediately sent home and be isolated for at least 10 days.\n\nThe disease may occur at any age in a non-immunized person, but most commonly affected individuals are those less than 20 years of age.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Maps of Bolivia can be seen at http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/americas/bolivia_admin_2006.jpg and http://healthmap.org/promed/p/5. - Mod.LK]\n\n******\n[2] USA (Washington)\nDate: Thu 2 Nov 2017\nSource: iFIBER One News [edited]\nhttp://www.ifiberone.com/columbia_basin/mumps-and-whooping-cough-a-problem-in/youtube_71b3dcd4-c002-11e7-9a61-ff27becf4d65.html\n\n\nGrant County [Washington] saw an extraordinary amount of mumps cases this year [2017] with 45.

According to data from the Ministry of Health, the number of reported cases until now is 3 times higher compared to figures recorded 5 years ago.\n\n\"We've had an important outbreak of mumps this year [2017],\" pointed out Adolfo Zarate, Head of the Epidemiology area of the Ministry of Health, who also mentioned that during this year 2044 cases of mumps have been reported. This is 3 times the figure for 2013, when a similar outbreak took place, but only 776 cases were reported. Mr Zarate explained that this explosive condition is because of the change of season, and also because non-immunized people may gather, so this may generate the high number of cases.\n\nYesterday [31 Oct 2017], La Paz Health Service (SEDES, according to its Spanish initials) reported that the mumps vaccine, which is included within the MRM package (measles, rubella, and mumps) only confers 80 percent protection. The vaccine is administered to children between 12 and 24 months of age, and a booster dose is given when they are 4 years old.\n\nThe most affected departments are La Paz, 1698 cases; Santa Cruz, 221 cases, and Cochabamba. For this reason, Mr Zarate urged the (symptomatic) population to go to health centers in order to have timely therapy.\n\nIn La Paz city, SEDES reported last week that this is an alarming situation, since \"there is an explosive and persistent outbreak\".\n\nMumps is a viral disease that is transmitted from person to person through saliva (droplets). Affected persons most commonly present with the following symptoms: fever, sore throat, parotid gland enlargement (inflammation), and loss of appetite.\n\nMr Zarate also recommended that all affected persons must get rest if they develop symptoms, since male subjects may develop orchitis (testis inflammation) or ovaritis (ovarian inflammation), which may lead -- in a small percentage of cases -- to infertility.\n\nHe also advised that affected persons must use masks; they must also avoid sharing cutlery and dishes, and thoroughly wash their hands. It is also important to disinfect the household using detergents, in order to prevent transmission of the disease to other members of the family.\n\nMr Zarate also recommended that sanitary triage must be established in educational facilities, so that if parents, teachers, or school authorities find a symptomatic student, he/she must be immediately sent home and be isolated for at least 10 days.\n\nThe disease may occur at any age in a non-immunized person, but most commonly affected individuals are those less than 20 years of age.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Maps of Bolivia can be seen at http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/americas/bolivia_admin_2006.jpg and http://healthmap.org/promed/p/5. - Mod.LK]\n\n******\n[2] USA (Washington)\nDate: Thu 2 Nov 2017\nSource: iFIBER One News [edited]\nhttp://www.ifiberone.com/columbia_basin/mumps-and-whooping-cough-a-problem-in/youtube_71b3dcd4-c002-11e7-9a61-ff27becf4d65.html\n\n\nGrant County [Washington] saw an extraordinary amount of mumps cases this year [2017] with 45.

According to data from the Ministry of Health, the number of reported cases until now is 3 times higher compared to figures recorded 5 years ago.\n\n\"We've had an important outbreak of mumps this year [2017],\" pointed out Adolfo Zarate, Head of the Epidemiology area of the Ministry of Health, who also mentioned that during this year 2044 cases of mumps have been reported. This is 3 times the figure for 2013, when a similar outbreak took place, but only 776 cases were reported. Mr Zarate explained that this explosive condition is because of the change of season, and also because non-immunized people may gather, so this may generate the high number of cases.\n\nYesterday [31 Oct 2017], La Paz Health Service (SEDES, according to its Spanish initials) reported that the mumps vaccine, which is included within the MRM package (measles, rubella, and mumps) only confers 80 percent protection. The vaccine is administered to children between 12 and 24 months of age, and a booster dose is given when they are 4 years old.\n\nThe most affected departments are La Paz, 1698 cases; Santa Cruz, 221 cases, and Cochabamba. For this reason, Mr Zarate urged the (symptomatic) population to go to health centers in order to have timely therapy.\n\nIn La Paz city, SEDES reported last week that this is an alarming situation, since \"there is an explosive and persistent outbreak\".\n\nMumps is a viral disease that is transmitted from person to person through saliva (droplets). Affected persons most commonly present with the following symptoms: fever, sore throat, parotid gland enlargement (inflammation), and loss of appetite.\n\nMr Zarate also recommended that all affected persons must get rest if they develop symptoms, since male subjects may develop orchitis (testis inflammation) or ovaritis (ovarian inflammation), which may lead -- in a small percentage of cases -- to infertility.\n\nHe also advised that affected persons must use masks; they must also avoid sharing cutlery and dishes, and thoroughly wash their hands. It is also important to disinfect the household using detergents, in order to prevent transmission of the disease to other members of the family.\n\nMr Zarate also recommended that sanitary triage must be established in educational facilities, so that if parents, teachers, or school authorities find a symptomatic student, he/she must be immediately sent home and be isolated for at least 10 days.\n\nThe disease may occur at any age in a non-immunized person, but most commonly affected individuals are those less than 20 years of age.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Maps of Bolivia can be seen at http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/americas/bolivia_admin_2006.jpg and http://healthmap.org/promed/p/5. - Mod.LK]\n\n******\n[2] USA (Washington)\nDate: Thu 2 Nov 2017\nSource: iFIBER One News [edited]\nhttp://www.ifiberone.com/columbia_basin/mumps-and-whooping-cough-a-problem-in/youtube_71b3dcd4-c002-11e7-9a61-ff27becf4d65.html\n\n\nGrant County [Washington] saw an extraordinary amount of mumps cases this year [2017] with 45.

So, we've just taken that extra precaution.\"\n\nMumps spreads through saliva or mucus, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Symptoms include fever, headaches, and swollen and tender glands under the ears, the CDC's website notes.\n\nGeorgetown officials asked infected students to cloister themselves for 5 days after the appearance of initial symptoms, a note to the campus from Vince WinklerPrins, assistant vice president for student health, said.\n\n\"We will continue to monitor and support these students,\" WinklerPrins said.\n\nIn an email sent to its campus community, Catholic said residential students who had reported mumps symptoms have been moved to an unoccupied space, in an attempt to limit exposure.\n\n\"Students are able to return to rooms and classes after a 5-day period,\" the email stated.\n\nCatholic's students were also briefed on how someone infected with mumps can spread the virus: by coughing or sharing a drink, for example. They were advised to keep their hands clean and to not share their utensils.\n\nThe University of Virginia [U-Va] has also recently urged students to take precautions after 2 suspected cases were identified. A U-Va spokesman did not immediately return an email seeking an update [Mon 6 Nov 2017].\n\n[Byline: Sarah Larimer]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nAnn Zhang\nUniversity of Rochester\n<ayzhang24@gmail.com>\n\nProMED thanks Ann Zhang for alerting us to these cases.\n\n[Because of the rise in mumps outbreaks observed at US universities since 2006, a federal expert US panel has endorsed a 3rd vaccine dose in such outbreak situations.

Dr Herman, said this was the worst outbreak since 1994. \"This is quite a large outbreak, and something we're very concerned about, and trying our best to implement public health measures to try to contain,\" Herman said.\n\nShe said Auckland was essentially free of the viral disease even late last year [2016], but the outbreak began after being picked up overseas. Herman said it particularly came from the Pacific Islands -- mostly Fiji, and later Tonga -- where the mumps vaccine was not available.\n\nShe said there have also been \"massive\" outbreaks in the US and the UK, which has spread easily through universities, she said.\n\n\"In terms of where the mumps infection is occurring, it's actually all throughout the world. New Zealand has been immune to it until late last year [2016] and early this year. Because we've had a vulnerable population here who have not been fully immunised with the MMR vaccine, it's allowed community spread to be well established.\n\n\"We are importing mumps, as well as probably exporting it as well.\"\n\nHerman said it was not possible to know if the rates of the disease have peaked.\n\nBut she said if people have not received the MMR vaccine, to do so immediately. Other ways to combat the spread include washing hands, covering coughs and cleaning commonly used items.\n\nHerman says for most adults, it's a mild illness. However, a small proportion can develop complications including meningitis or encephalitis. Young children are more at risk of developing harmful outcomes.\n\n[Byline: Jordan Bond]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[This outbreak is a consequence of introduction of mumps into a community with low vaccination coverage.

According to data from the Ministry of Health, the number of reported cases until now is 3 times higher compared to figures recorded 5 years ago.\n\n\"We've had an important outbreak of mumps this year [2017],\" pointed out Adolfo Zarate, Head of the Epidemiology area of the Ministry of Health, who also mentioned that during this year 2044 cases of mumps have been reported. This is 3 times the figure for 2013, when a similar outbreak took place, but only 776 cases were reported. Mr Zarate explained that this explosive condition is because of the change of season, and also because non-immunized people may gather, so this may generate the high number of cases.\n\nYesterday [31 Oct 2017], La Paz Health Service (SEDES, according to its Spanish initials) reported that the mumps vaccine, which is included within the MRM package (measles, rubella, and mumps) only confers 80 percent protection. The vaccine is administered to children between 12 and 24 months of age, and a booster dose is given when they are 4 years old.\n\nThe most affected departments are La Paz, 1698 cases; Santa Cruz, 221 cases, and Cochabamba. For this reason, Mr Zarate urged the (symptomatic) population to go to health centers in order to have timely therapy.\n\nIn La Paz city, SEDES reported last week that this is an alarming situation, since \"there is an explosive and persistent outbreak\".\n\nMumps is a viral disease that is transmitted from person to person through saliva (droplets). Affected persons most commonly present with the following symptoms: fever, sore throat, parotid gland enlargement (inflammation), and loss of appetite.\n\nMr Zarate also recommended that all affected persons must get rest if they develop symptoms, since male subjects may develop orchitis (testis inflammation) or ovaritis (ovarian inflammation), which may lead -- in a small percentage of cases -- to infertility.\n\nHe also advised that affected persons must use masks; they must also avoid sharing cutlery and dishes, and thoroughly wash their hands. It is also important to disinfect the household using detergents, in order to prevent transmission of the disease to other members of the family.\n\nMr Zarate also recommended that sanitary triage must be established in educational facilities, so that if parents, teachers, or school authorities find a symptomatic student, he/she must be immediately sent home and be isolated for at least 10 days.\n\nThe disease may occur at any age in a non-immunized person, but most commonly affected individuals are those less than 20 years of age.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Maps of Bolivia can be seen at http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/americas/bolivia_admin_2006.jpg and http://healthmap.org/promed/p/5. - Mod.LK]\n\n******\n[2] USA (Washington)\nDate: Thu 2 Nov 2017\nSource: iFIBER One News [edited]\nhttp://www.ifiberone.com/columbia_basin/mumps-and-whooping-cough-a-problem-in/youtube_71b3dcd4-c002-11e7-9a61-ff27becf4d65.html\n\n\nGrant County [Washington] saw an extraordinary amount of mumps cases this year [2017] with 45.

According to data from the Ministry of Health, the number of reported cases until now is 3 times higher compared to figures recorded 5 years ago.\n\n\"We've had an important outbreak of mumps this year [2017],\" pointed out Adolfo Zarate, Head of the Epidemiology area of the Ministry of Health, who also mentioned that during this year 2044 cases of mumps have been reported. This is 3 times the figure for 2013, when a similar outbreak took place, but only 776 cases were reported. Mr Zarate explained that this explosive condition is because of the change of season, and also because non-immunized people may gather, so this may generate the high number of cases.\n\nYesterday [31 Oct 2017], La Paz Health Service (SEDES, according to its Spanish initials) reported that the mumps vaccine, which is included within the MRM package (measles, rubella, and mumps) only confers 80 percent protection. The vaccine is administered to children between 12 and 24 months of age, and a booster dose is given when they are 4 years old.\n\nThe most affected departments are La Paz, 1698 cases; Santa Cruz, 221 cases, and Cochabamba. For this reason, Mr Zarate urged the (symptomatic) population to go to health centers in order to have timely therapy.\n\nIn La Paz city, SEDES reported last week that this is an alarming situation, since \"there is an explosive and persistent outbreak\".\n\nMumps is a viral disease that is transmitted from person to person through saliva (droplets). Affected persons most commonly present with the following symptoms: fever, sore throat, parotid gland enlargement (inflammation), and loss of appetite.\n\nMr Zarate also recommended that all affected persons must get rest if they develop symptoms, since male subjects may develop orchitis (testis inflammation) or ovaritis (ovarian inflammation), which may lead -- in a small percentage of cases -- to infertility.\n\nHe also advised that affected persons must use masks; they must also avoid sharing cutlery and dishes, and thoroughly wash their hands. It is also important to disinfect the household using detergents, in order to prevent transmission of the disease to other members of the family.\n\nMr Zarate also recommended that sanitary triage must be established in educational facilities, so that if parents, teachers, or school authorities find a symptomatic student, he/she must be immediately sent home and be isolated for at least 10 days.\n\nThe disease may occur at any age in a non-immunized person, but most commonly affected individuals are those less than 20 years of age.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Maps of Bolivia can be seen at http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/americas/bolivia_admin_2006.jpg and http://healthmap.org/promed/p/5. - Mod.LK]\n\n******\n[2] USA (Washington)\nDate: Thu 2 Nov 2017\nSource: iFIBER One News [edited]\nhttp://www.ifiberone.com/columbia_basin/mumps-and-whooping-cough-a-problem-in/youtube_71b3dcd4-c002-11e7-9a61-ff27becf4d65.html\n\n\nGrant County [Washington] saw an extraordinary amount of mumps cases this year [2017] with 45.

So, we've just taken that extra precaution.\"\n\nMumps spreads through saliva or mucus, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Symptoms include fever, headaches, and swollen and tender glands under the ears, the CDC's website notes.\n\nGeorgetown officials asked infected students to cloister themselves for 5 days after the appearance of initial symptoms, a note to the campus from Vince WinklerPrins, assistant vice president for student health, said.\n\n\"We will continue to monitor and support these students,\" WinklerPrins said.\n\nIn an email sent to its campus community, Catholic said residential students who had reported mumps symptoms have been moved to an unoccupied space, in an attempt to limit exposure.\n\n\"Students are able to return to rooms and classes after a 5-day period,\" the email stated.\n\nCatholic's students were also briefed on how someone infected with mumps can spread the virus: by coughing or sharing a drink, for example. They were advised to keep their hands clean and to not share their utensils.\n\nThe University of Virginia [U-Va] has also recently urged students to take precautions after 2 suspected cases were identified. A U-Va spokesman did not immediately return an email seeking an update [Mon 6 Nov 2017].\n\n[Byline: Sarah Larimer]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nAnn Zhang\nUniversity of Rochester\n<ayzhang24@gmail.com>\n\nProMED thanks Ann Zhang for alerting us to these cases.\n\n[Because of the rise in mumps outbreaks observed at US universities since 2006, a federal expert US panel has endorsed a 3rd vaccine dose in such outbreak situations.

Dr Herman, said this was the worst outbreak since 1994. \"This is quite a large outbreak, and something we're very concerned about, and trying our best to implement public health measures to try to contain,\" Herman said.\n\nShe said Auckland was essentially free of the viral disease even late last year [2016], but the outbreak began after being picked up overseas. Herman said it particularly came from the Pacific Islands -- mostly Fiji, and later Tonga -- where the mumps vaccine was not available.\n\nShe said there have also been \"massive\" outbreaks in the US and the UK, which has spread easily through universities, she said.\n\n\"In terms of where the mumps infection is occurring, it's actually all throughout the world. New Zealand has been immune to it until late last year [2016] and early this year. Because we've had a vulnerable population here who have not been fully immunised with the MMR vaccine, it's allowed community spread to be well established.\n\n\"We are importing mumps, as well as probably exporting it as well.\"\n\nHerman said it was not possible to know if the rates of the disease have peaked.\n\nBut she said if people have not received the MMR vaccine, to do so immediately. Other ways to combat the spread include washing hands, covering coughs and cleaning commonly used items.\n\nHerman says for most adults, it's a mild illness. However, a small proportion can develop complications including meningitis or encephalitis. Young children are more at risk of developing harmful outcomes.\n\n[Byline: Jordan Bond]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[This outbreak is a consequence of introduction of mumps into a community with low vaccination coverage.

So, we've just taken that extra precaution.\"\n\nMumps spreads through saliva or mucus, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Symptoms include fever, headaches, and swollen and tender glands under the ears, the CDC's website notes.\n\nGeorgetown officials asked infected students to cloister themselves for 5 days after the appearance of initial symptoms, a note to the campus from Vince WinklerPrins, assistant vice president for student health, said.\n\n\"We will continue to monitor and support these students,\" WinklerPrins said.\n\nIn an email sent to its campus community, Catholic said residential students who had reported mumps symptoms have been moved to an unoccupied space, in an attempt to limit exposure.\n\n\"Students are able to return to rooms and classes after a 5-day period,\" the email stated.\n\nCatholic's students were also briefed on how someone infected with mumps can spread the virus: by coughing or sharing a drink, for example. They were advised to keep their hands clean and to not share their utensils.\n\nThe University of Virginia [U-Va] has also recently urged students to take precautions after 2 suspected cases were identified.

Dr Herman, said this was the worst outbreak since 1994. \"This is quite a large outbreak, and something we're very concerned about, and trying our best to implement public health measures to try to contain,\" Herman said.\n\nShe said Auckland was essentially free of the viral disease even late last year [2016], but the outbreak began after being picked up overseas. Herman said it particularly came from the Pacific Islands -- mostly Fiji, and later Tonga -- where the mumps vaccine was not available.\n\nShe said there have also been \"massive\" outbreaks in the US and the UK, which has spread easily through universities, she said.\n\n\"In terms of where the mumps infection is occurring, it's actually all throughout the world. New Zealand has been immune to it until late last year [2016] and early this year. Because we've had a vulnerable population here who have not been fully immunised with the MMR vaccine, it's allowed community spread to be well established.\n\n\"We are importing mumps, as well as probably exporting it as well.\"\n\nHerman said it was not possible to know if the rates of the disease have peaked.\n\nBut she said if people have not received the MMR vaccine, to do so immediately. Other ways to combat the spread include washing hands, covering coughs and cleaning commonly used items.\n\nHerman says for most adults, it's a mild illness. However, a small proportion can develop complications including meningitis or encephalitis. Young children are more at risk of developing harmful outcomes.\n\n[Byline: Jordan Bond]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[This outbreak is a consequence of introduction of mumps into a community with low vaccination coverage. More often, mumps outbreaks are the consequence of waning immunity in young adults. But the Auckland outbreak is a reminder that even with elimination of mumps (and measles) from a country, high immunization levels must be maintained.\n\nMaps of New Zealand can be seen at http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/dc/NZTerritorialAuthorities.png and http://healthmap.org/promed/p/606. - Mod.LK]\nSee Also\nMumps update (31): USA, MMR 3rd dose, Canada 20171027.5407525\nMumps update (30): USA, New Zealand 20171022.5396070\nMumps update (29): USA (New York), Pacific (New Zealand, Malaysia) 20171014.5381315\nMumps update (28): Canada, USA 20171001.5352710\nMumps update (27): Pacific (New Zealand), USA (HI, AK) 20170925.5340444\nMumps update (26): USA (TX) Canada (MB,BC) 20170919.5325095\nMumps update (25): Hawai'i (Hawai'i Island), New Zealand (AU) 20170907.5300162\nMumps update (24): Australia (QL), New Zealand (OT), Brazil (AM) 20170820.5262239\nMumps update (23): New Zealand (AU), USA (TX) 20170722.5197236\nMumps update (22): New Zealand, USA 20170708.5160387\nMumps update (21): USA (OR,HI,CA) Europe (UK) 20170623.5126427\nMumps update (20): USA (IL, NY, MA) 20170609.5095537\nMumps update (19): Europe (UK), USA (HI,PA,CA) 20170603.5080591\nMumps update (18): USA 20170520.5049677\nMumps update (17): USA 20170502.5007199\nMumps update (16): USA (TX, MN) 20170423.4988318\nMumps update (15): New Zealand, USA 20170408.4958345\nMumps update (14): Australia (QL), USA 20170330.4935375\nMumps update (13): Portugal, Canada, USA, analysis 20170326.4924853\nMumps update (12): Canada (ON) USA (IL,AR) 20170324.4922098\nMumps update (11): USA 20170319.4911532\nMumps update (10) 20170314.4900923\nMumps update (09) 20170312.4895943\nMumps update (08): Canada, USA, comment 20170305.4880865\nMumps update (07): Canada, USA 20170303.4875855\nMumps update (06): USA 20170227.4864176\nMumps update (05): USA (PA, MO - RFI), Canada (ON, AB) 20170223.4860461\nMumps update (04): USA (WA), New Zealand 20170211.4830961\nMumps - USA (03): (AR) 20170205.4817357\nMumps - USA (02) 20170129.4801141\nMumps - USA (01): (WA,TX) 20170110.4753366\n.................................................sb/lk/mj/jh", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "measles", "mumps", "pertussis", "rubella", "encephalitis", "meningitis"], "syndromes": ["encephalitis", "meningitis"], "event_date": ["2032-03-16 00:00:00", "2044-03-16 00:00:00", "2013-03-16 00:00:00", "2017-03-16 00:00:00", "1698-03-16 00:00:00", "2006-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-01-01 00:00:00", "1994-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-25 00:00:00", "2021-03-08 00:00:00", "2021-03-07 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-01 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Washington DC", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "NEW ZEALAND", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Fiji", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Brazil", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Portugal", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Tonga", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "NZ", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Malaysia", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Canada", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "USA", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Australia", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Washington", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "La Paz", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "US", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "UK", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Santa Cruz", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "SOUTH AMERICA", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Royal City", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "DC", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "New Zealand", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Bolivia", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "New York", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Grant County", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "District of Columbia", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "5407525", "headline": "PRO/EDR> Mumps update (31): USA, MMR 3rd dose, Canada", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=5407525", "date": "2017-08-20 09:44:05", "main_text": "MUMPS UPDATE (24): AUSTRALIA (QUEENSLAND), NEW ZEALAND (OTAGO,) BRAZIL (AMAZONAS)\n*********************************************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nIn this update:\n[1] Australia (Cairns, Queensland)\n[2] New Zealand (Dunedin, Otago)\n[3] Brazil (Manaus, Amazonas)\n\n******\n[1] Australia (Cairns, Queensland)\nDate: Fri 11 Aug 2017 9:00 PM AEST\nSource: The Cairns Post [edited]\nhttps://tinyurl.com/y9nepfk5\n\n\nFar North Queenslanders have been urged to vaccinate their children following a spike in mumps cases in Cairns. There have been 14 cases of the highly infectious disease identified by Queensland Health since [24 Jul 2017], compared to the yearly average of only one case in the Cairns and Hinterland health district.\n\nTropical Public Health director Dr Steven Donohue said the mumps outbreak had spilled over to Cairns from northwest Queensland and the Northern Territory's Top End.\n\n\"Outbreaks of mumps mainly occur because of low vaccination rates, missed doses in the past, waning immunity, or pressure of infection in overcrowded households,\" he said.\n\nHe said the viral illness was spread just like influenza, by coughing or sneezing near other people and through unwashed hands.\n\n\"Symptoms may occur around 2 weeks after exposure if the person is not immune,\" he said. \"The illness usually lasts between 5-9 days.\n\n\"One person in 3 who contracts mumps does not have any symptoms and doesn't realise they are sick, but they may still be contagious and infect may other people.\"\n\nNorthern Queensland Primary Health Network chief executive Robin Moore said immunisation was a simple, safe and highly effective way to protect children and adults from preventable diseases like mumps.\n\n\"This year's [2017] increase in the number of mumps cases in the Cairns region is a timely reminder to parents that immunisation is the best protection against preventable diseases such as these.\n\n\"We urge all members of the community to be fully vaccinated.\" ...\n\nThe disease is uncommon in developed countries, including Australia, because of the widespread use of the measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine.\n\nThis is given to children at 12 and 18 months, but free catch-up doses are available to anyone born after 1965 who may not have 2 recorded doses.\n\nOutbreaks of mumps mainly occur because of low vaccination rates, missed doses in the past, waning immunity, or pressure of infection in overcrowded households.\n\n[Byline: Daniel Bateman]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Maps of Australia can be seen at http://www.ezilon.com/maps/images/oceania/australia-political-map.gif and http://healthmap.org/promed/p/2954. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ]\n\n\n******\n[2] New Zealand (Dunedin, Otago)\nDate: Thu 17 Aug 2017 19:45 NZST\nSource: Stuff [edited]\nhttp://tinyurl.com/y7a56fv5\n\n\nUniversity of Otago students are being offered free booster shots after about 10 confirmed or suspected cases were reported in Dunedin [Otago, South Island].\n\nThree young people in Marlborough have contracted the contagious illness, with at least 1 case linked to an Auckland outbreak, while 2 have been confirmed in Nelson.\n\nNationally, an unusually high number of cases were reported from September 2016 to early 2017, and the Ministry of Health warned of \"an increased risk of further outbreaks\".\n\nAuckland reported 51 cases of mumps in the past month -- most aged 10 to 19 -- while several were recorded in Waikato earlier this year [2017].\n\nThe Auckland Regional Public Health Service said last month [July 2017] it was concerned not enough people were immunised in the face of the mumps outbreak.\n\nThe MMR vaccine is usually given in 2 doses, one at 15 months old and one at 4 years old.\n\nMost people recover from mumps, but it can have serious complications. The disease can cause inflammation of tissue surrounding the brain (meningitis), inflamed testicles or ovaries and deafness.\n\nMen hospitalised from the Auckland outbreak had pain and swelling in their testicles, known as orchitis, which in rare cases may lead to infertility.\n\nThe outbreak in Dunedin has prompted the Otago tertiary institution's student health team to offer free measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) booster shots to students who have not had two MMR vaccinations since 1990, or are unsure of their vaccination history.\n\nPro-vice-chancellor of health sciences Professor Peter Crampton, the convener of the university's pandemic planning group, said the group was \"determining our ongoing response as the situation develops.\"\n\nThe outbreak coincided with a large-scale boil water notice issued for parts of Dunedin, including the student quarter, after untreated water got into part of the town's drinking water supply on [Mon 14 Aug 2017].\n\nAll students and staff had been sent information about mumps. Information had been posted on social media.\n\nMarlborough medical officer of health Dr Andrew Lindsay said mumps is \"highly contagious\". It spreads through the air by breathing, coughing and sneezing, or through contact with infected saliva; by kissing or sharing food and drink. It usually takes 12-25 days before symptoms appear -- including pain in the jaw, fever, headache, and swollen glands around the face and body. People with mumps re infectious for 7 days before swelling starts and for 5 days after they cease.\n\nPersonal hygiene is essential to avoid catching mumps, including frequent hand washing, stopping coughs and sneezes in tissues, keeping at least 1 metre [3 ft] away from others and ensuring kitchens and bathrooms are clean.\n\nDr Jill Sherwood, public health physician with the ESR (the Institute of Environmental Science and Research), earlier said the MMR vaccine was not as effective in mumps as it was in measles and rubella. \"The mumps component is only about 85 per cent effective, whereas the measles component will most likely give you lifetime coverage,\" Sherwood said.\n\nThere have been no reported cases of mumps in Canterbury, a health board spokeswoman said.\n\n[Byline: Hamish Mcneilly, Jennifer Eder]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Maps of New Zealand can be seen at http://www.ezilon.com/maps/images/oceania/political-map-of-New-Zealan.gif and http://healthmap.org/promed/p/738. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ]\n\n******\n[3] Brazil (Manaus, Amazonas)\nDate: Fri 18 Aug 2017\nSource: Em Tempo [in Portuguese, trans. & summ., edited]\nhttp://www.emtempo.com.br/manaus-tem-surto-de-caxumba-com-230-casos/\n\n\nWith 230 cases of mumps in Manaus [Amazonas state] in 19 places, registered since April 2017, mainly in schools, the Municipal Health Department (Semsa) warns parents to keep the updated immunization booklet for children and adolescents.\n\nUp to 2016, there were no official mumps outbreak records in Manaus.

The disease can cause inflammation of tissue surrounding the brain (meningitis), inflamed testicles or ovaries and deafness.\n\nMen hospitalised from the Auckland outbreak had pain and swelling in their testicles, known as orchitis, which in rare cases may lead to infertility.\n\nThe outbreak in Dunedin has prompted the Otago tertiary institution's student health team to offer free measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) booster shots to students who have not had two MMR vaccinations since 1990, or are unsure of their vaccination history.\n\nPro-vice-chancellor of health sciences Professor Peter Crampton, the convener of the university's pandemic planning group, said the group was \"determining our ongoing response as the situation develops.\"\n\nThe outbreak coincided with a large-scale boil water notice issued for parts of Dunedin, including the student quarter, after untreated water got into part of the town's drinking water supply on [Mon 14 Aug 2017].\n\nAll students and staff had been sent information about mumps. Information had been posted on social media.\n\nMarlborough medical officer of health Dr Andrew Lindsay said mumps is \"highly contagious\". It spreads through the air by breathing, coughing and sneezing, or through contact with infected saliva; by kissing or sharing food and drink. It usually takes 12-25 days before symptoms appear -- including pain in the jaw, fever, headache, and swollen glands around the face and body. People with mumps re infectious for 7 days before swelling starts and for 5 days after they cease.\n\nPersonal hygiene is essential to avoid catching mumps, including frequent hand washing, stopping coughs and sneezes in tissues, keeping at least 1 metre [3 ft] away from others and ensuring kitchens and bathrooms are clean.\n\nDr Jill Sherwood, public health physician with the ESR (the Institute of Environmental Science and Research), earlier said the MMR vaccine was not as effective in mumps as it was in measles and rubella. \"The mumps component is only about 85 per cent effective, whereas the measles component will most likely give you lifetime coverage,\" Sherwood said.\n\nThere have been no reported cases of mumps in Canterbury, a health board spokeswoman said.\n\n[Byline: Hamish Mcneilly, Jennifer Eder]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Maps of New Zealand can be seen at http://www.ezilon.com/maps/images/oceania/political-map-of-New-Zealan.gif and http://healthmap.org/promed/p/738. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ]\n\n******\n[3] Brazil (Manaus, Amazonas)\nDate: Fri 18 Aug 2017\nSource: Em Tempo [in Portuguese, trans. & summ., edited]\nhttp://www.emtempo.com.br/manaus-tem-surto-de-caxumba-com-230-casos/\n\n\nWith 230 cases of mumps in Manaus [Amazonas state] in 19 places, registered since April 2017, mainly in schools, the Municipal Health Department (Semsa) warns parents to keep the updated immunization booklet for children and adolescents.\n\nUp to 2016, there were no official mumps outbreak records in Manaus. In 2017, as of 18 Aug, there have been 230 cases reported from 19 localities, most of them in schools, which suggests low vaccination coverage in children and adolescents. The 1st outbreak was reported in April 2017 and the occurrence of cases is continuing until the month of August, according to the municipal health secretary. ...\n\n[Byline: Isac Sharlon]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nEmerson Capistrano\nEpidemiological Surveillance\nBoa Vista Health Service\nRoraima, Brazil\n<emerson.capistrano@gmail.com>\n\n[ProMED-mail thanks Emerson Capistrano for submitting this report. -

People with mumps re infectious for 7 days before swelling starts and for 5 days after they cease.\n\nPersonal hygiene is essential to avoid catching mumps, including frequent hand washing, stopping coughs and sneezes in tissues, keeping at least 1 metre [3 ft] away from others and ensuring kitchens and bathrooms are clean.\n\nDr Jill Sherwood, public health physician with the ESR (the Institute of Environmental Science and Research), earlier said the MMR vaccine was not as effective in mumps as it was in measles and rubella. \"The mumps component is only about 85 per cent effective, whereas the measles component will most likely give you lifetime coverage,\" Sherwood said.\n\nThere have been no reported cases of mumps in Canterbury, a health board spokeswoman said.\n\n[Byline: Hamish Mcneilly, Jennifer Eder]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Maps of New Zealand can be seen at http://www.ezilon.com/maps/images/oceania/political-map-of-New-Zealan.gif and http://healthmap.org/promed/p/738. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ]\n\n******\n[3] Brazil (Manaus, Amazonas)\nDate: Fri 18 Aug 2017\nSource: Em Tempo [in Portuguese, trans. & summ., edited]\nhttp://www.emtempo.com.br/manaus-tem-surto-de-caxumba-com-230-casos/\n\n\nWith 230 cases of mumps in Manaus [Amazonas state] in 19 places, registered since April 2017, mainly in schools, the Municipal Health Department (Semsa) warns parents to keep the updated immunization booklet for children and adolescents.\n\nUp to 2016, there were no official mumps outbreak records in Manaus.

There have been 14 cases of the highly infectious disease identified by Queensland Health since [24 Jul 2017], compared to the yearly average of only one case in the Cairns and Hinterland health district.\n\nTropical Public Health director Dr Steven Donohue said the mumps outbreak had spilled over to Cairns from northwest Queensland and the Northern Territory's Top End.\n\n\"Outbreaks of mumps mainly occur because of low vaccination rates, missed doses in the past, waning immunity, or pressure of infection in overcrowded households,\" he said.\n\nHe said the viral illness was spread just like influenza, by coughing or sneezing near other people and through unwashed hands.\n\n\"Symptoms may occur around 2 weeks after exposure if the person is not immune,\" he said. \"The illness usually lasts between 5-9 days.\n\n\"One person in 3 who contracts mumps does not have any symptoms and doesn't realise they are sick, but they may still be contagious and infect may other people.\"\n\nNorthern Queensland Primary Health Network chief executive Robin Moore said immunisation was a simple, safe and highly effective way to protect children and adults from preventable diseases like mumps.\n\n\"This year's [2017] increase in the number of mumps cases in the Cairns region is a timely reminder to parents that immunisation is the best protection against preventable diseases such as these.\n\n\"We urge all members of the community to be fully vaccinated.\" ...\n\nThe disease is uncommon in developed countries, including Australia, because of the widespread use of the measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine.\n\nThis is given to children at 12 and 18 months, but free catch-up doses are available to anyone born after 1965 who may not have 2 recorded doses.\n\nOutbreaks of mumps mainly occur because of low vaccination rates, missed doses in the past, waning immunity, or pressure of infection in overcrowded households.\n\n[Byline: Daniel Bateman]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Maps of Australia can be seen at http://www.ezilon.com/maps/images/oceania/australia-political-map.gif and http://healthmap.org/promed/p/2954. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ]\n\n\n******\n[2] New Zealand (Dunedin, Otago)\nDate: Thu 17 Aug 2017 19:45 NZST\nSource: Stuff [edited]\nhttp://tinyurl.com/y7a56fv5\n\n\nUniversity of Otago students are being offered free booster shots after about 10 confirmed or suspected cases were reported in Dunedin [Otago, South Island].\n\nThree young people in Marlborough have contracted the contagious illness, with at least 1 case linked to an Auckland outbreak, while 2 have been confirmed in Nelson.\n\nNationally, an unusually high number of cases were reported from September 2016 to early 2017, and the Ministry of Health warned of \"an increased risk of further outbreaks\".\n\nAuckland reported 51 cases of mumps in the past month -- most aged 10 to 19 -- while several were recorded in Waikato earlier this year [2017].\n\nThe Auckland Regional Public Health Service said last month [July 2017] it was concerned not enough people were immunised in the face of the mumps outbreak.\n\nThe MMR vaccine is usually given in 2 doses, one at 15 months old and one at 4 years old.\n\nMost people recover from mumps, but it can have serious complications. The disease can cause inflammation of tissue surrounding the brain (meningitis), inflamed testicles or ovaries and deafness.\n\nMen hospitalised from the Auckland outbreak had pain and swelling in their testicles, known as orchitis, which in rare cases may lead to infertility.\n\nThe outbreak in Dunedin has prompted the Otago tertiary institution's student health team to offer free measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) booster shots to students who have not had two MMR vaccinations since 1990, or are unsure of their vaccination history.\n\nPro-vice-chancellor of health sciences Professor Peter Crampton, the convener of the university's pandemic planning group, said the group was \"determining our ongoing response as the situation develops.\"\n\nThe outbreak coincided with a large-scale boil water notice issued for parts of Dunedin, including the student quarter, after untreated water got into part of the town's drinking water supply on [Mon 14 Aug 2017].\n\nAll students and staff had been sent information about mumps. Information had been posted on social media.\n\nMarlborough medical officer of health Dr Andrew Lindsay said mumps is \"highly contagious\". It spreads through the air by breathing, coughing and sneezing, or through contact with infected saliva; by kissing or sharing food and drink. It usually takes 12-25 days before symptoms appear -- including pain in the jaw, fever, headache, and swollen glands around the face and body.

The disease can cause inflammation of tissue surrounding the brain (meningitis), inflamed testicles or ovaries and deafness.\n\nMen hospitalised from the Auckland outbreak had pain and swelling in their testicles, known as orchitis, which in rare cases may lead to infertility.\n\nThe outbreak in Dunedin has prompted the Otago tertiary institution's student health team to offer free measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) booster shots to students who have not had two MMR vaccinations since 1990, or are unsure of their vaccination history.\n\nPro-vice-chancellor of health sciences Professor Peter Crampton, the convener of the university's pandemic planning group, said the group was \"determining our ongoing response as the situation develops.\"\n\nThe outbreak coincided with a large-scale boil water notice issued for parts of Dunedin, including the student quarter, after untreated water got into part of the town's drinking water supply on [Mon 14 Aug 2017].\n\nAll students and staff had been sent information about mumps. Information had been posted on social media.\n\nMarlborough medical officer of health Dr Andrew Lindsay said mumps is \"highly contagious\". It spreads through the air by breathing, coughing and sneezing, or through contact with infected saliva; by kissing or sharing food and drink. It usually takes 12-25 days before symptoms appear -- including pain in the jaw, fever, headache, and swollen glands around the face and body. People with mumps re infectious for 7 days before swelling starts and for 5 days after they cease.\n\nPersonal hygiene is essential to avoid catching mumps, including frequent hand washing, stopping coughs and sneezes in tissues, keeping at least 1 metre [3 ft] away from others and ensuring kitchens and bathrooms are clean.\n\nDr Jill Sherwood, public health physician with the ESR (the Institute of Environmental Science and Research), earlier said the MMR vaccine was not as effective in mumps as it was in measles and rubella. \"The mumps component is only about 85 per cent effective, whereas the measles component will most likely give you lifetime coverage,\" Sherwood said.\n\nThere have been no reported cases of mumps in Canterbury, a health board spokeswoman said.\n\n[Byline: Hamish Mcneilly, Jennifer Eder]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Maps of New Zealand can be seen at http://www.ezilon.com/maps/images/oceania/political-map-of-New-Zealan.gif and http://healthmap.org/promed/p/738. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ]\n\n******\n[3] Brazil (Manaus, Amazonas)\nDate: Fri 18 Aug 2017\nSource: Em Tempo [in Portuguese, trans. & summ., edited]\nhttp://www.emtempo.com.br/manaus-tem-surto-de-caxumba-com-230-casos/\n\n\nWith 230 cases of mumps in Manaus [Amazonas state] in 19 places, registered since April 2017, mainly in schools, the Municipal Health Department (Semsa) warns parents to keep the updated immunization booklet for children and adolescents.\n\nUp to 2016, there were no official mumps outbreak records in Manaus. In 2017, as of 18 Aug, there have been 230 cases reported from 19 localities, most of them in schools, which suggests low vaccination coverage in children and adolescents. The 1st outbreak was reported in April 2017 and the occurrence of cases is continuing until the month of August, according to the municipal health secretary. ...\n\n[Byline: Isac Sharlon]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nEmerson Capistrano\nEpidemiological Surveillance\nBoa Vista Health Service\nRoraima, Brazil\n<emerson.capistrano@gmail.com>\n\n[ProMED-mail thanks Emerson Capistrano for submitting this report. -

There have been 14 cases of the highly infectious disease identified by Queensland Health since [24 Jul 2017], compared to the yearly average of only one case in the Cairns and Hinterland health district.\n\nTropical Public Health director Dr Steven Donohue said the mumps outbreak had spilled over to Cairns from northwest Queensland and the Northern Territory's Top End.\n\n\"Outbreaks of mumps mainly occur because of low vaccination rates, missed doses in the past, waning immunity, or pressure of infection in overcrowded households,\" he said.\n\nHe said the viral illness was spread just like influenza, by coughing or sneezing near other people and through unwashed hands.\n\n\"Symptoms may occur around 2 weeks after exposure if the person is not immune,\" he said. \"The illness usually lasts between 5-9 days.\n\n\"One person in 3 who contracts mumps does not have any symptoms and doesn't realise they are sick, but they may still be contagious and infect may other people.\"\n\nNorthern Queensland Primary Health Network chief executive Robin Moore said immunisation was a simple, safe and highly effective way to protect children and adults from preventable diseases like mumps.\n\n\"This year's [2017] increase in the number of mumps cases in the Cairns region is a timely reminder to parents that immunisation is the best protection against preventable diseases such as these.\n\n\"We urge all members of the community to be fully vaccinated.\" ...\n\nThe disease is uncommon in developed countries, including Australia, because of the widespread use of the measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine.\n\nThis is given to children at 12 and 18 months, but free catch-up doses are available to anyone born after 1965 who may not have 2 recorded doses.\n\nOutbreaks of mumps mainly occur because of low vaccination rates, missed doses in the past, waning immunity, or pressure of infection in overcrowded households.\n\n[Byline: Daniel Bateman]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Maps of Australia can be seen at http://www.ezilon.com/maps/images/oceania/australia-political-map.gif and http://healthmap.org/promed/p/2954. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ]\n\n\n******\n[2] New Zealand (Dunedin, Otago)\nDate: Thu 17 Aug 2017 19:45 NZST\nSource: Stuff [edited]\nhttp://tinyurl.com/y7a56fv5\n\n\nUniversity of Otago students are being offered free booster shots after about 10 confirmed or suspected cases were reported in Dunedin [Otago, South Island].\n\nThree young people in Marlborough have contracted the contagious illness, with at least 1 case linked to an Auckland outbreak, while 2 have been confirmed in Nelson.\n\nNationally, an unusually high number of cases were reported from September 2016 to early 2017, and the Ministry of Health warned of \"an increased risk of further outbreaks\".\n\nAuckland reported 51 cases of mumps in the past month -- most aged 10 to 19 -- while several were recorded in Waikato earlier this year [2017].\n\nThe Auckland Regional Public Health Service said last month [July 2017] it was concerned not enough people were immunised in the face of the mumps outbreak.\n\nThe MMR vaccine is usually given in 2 doses, one at 15 months old and one at 4 years old.\n\nMost people recover from mumps, but it can have serious complications. The disease can cause inflammation of tissue surrounding the brain (meningitis), inflamed testicles or ovaries and deafness.\n\nMen hospitalised from the Auckland outbreak had pain and swelling in their testicles, known as orchitis, which in rare cases may lead to infertility.\n\nThe outbreak in Dunedin has prompted the Otago tertiary institution's student health team to offer free measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) booster shots to students who have not had two MMR vaccinations since 1990, or are unsure of their vaccination history.\n\nPro-vice-chancellor of health sciences Professor Peter Crampton, the convener of the university's pandemic planning group, said the group was \"determining our ongoing response as the situation develops.\"\n\nThe outbreak coincided with a large-scale boil water notice issued for parts of Dunedin, including the student quarter, after untreated water got into part of the town's drinking water supply on [Mon 14 Aug 2017].\n\nAll students and staff had been sent information about mumps. Information had been posted on social media.\n\nMarlborough medical officer of health Dr Andrew Lindsay said mumps is \"highly contagious\". It spreads through the air by breathing, coughing and sneezing, or through contact with infected saliva; by kissing or sharing food and drink. It usually takes 12-25 days before symptoms appear -- including pain in the jaw, fever, headache, and swollen glands around the face and body.

There have been 14 cases of the highly infectious disease identified by Queensland Health since [24 Jul 2017], compared to the yearly average of only one case in the Cairns and Hinterland health district.\n\nTropical Public Health director Dr Steven Donohue said the mumps outbreak had spilled over to Cairns from northwest Queensland and the Northern Territory's Top End.\n\n\"Outbreaks of mumps mainly occur because of low vaccination rates, missed doses in the past, waning immunity, or pressure of infection in overcrowded households,\" he said.\n\nHe said the viral illness was spread just like influenza, by coughing or sneezing near other people and through unwashed hands.\n\n\"Symptoms may occur around 2 weeks after exposure if the person is not immune,\" he said. \"The illness usually lasts between 5-9 days.\n\n\"One person in 3 who contracts mumps does not have any symptoms and doesn't realise they are sick, but they may still be contagious and infect may other people.\"\n\nNorthern Queensland Primary Health Network chief executive Robin Moore said immunisation was a simple, safe and highly effective way to protect children and adults from preventable diseases like mumps.\n\n\"This year's [2017] increase in the number of mumps cases in the Cairns region is a timely reminder to parents that immunisation is the best protection against preventable diseases such as these.\n\n\"We urge all members of the community to be fully vaccinated.\" ...\n\nThe disease is uncommon in developed countries, including Australia, because of the widespread use of the measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine.\n\nThis is given to children at 12 and 18 months, but free catch-up doses are available to anyone born after 1965 who may not have 2 recorded doses.\n\nOutbreaks of mumps mainly occur because of low vaccination rates, missed doses in the past, waning immunity, or pressure of infection in overcrowded households.\n\n[Byline: Daniel Bateman]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Maps of Australia can be seen at http://www.ezilon.com/maps/images/oceania/australia-political-map.gif and http://healthmap.org/promed/p/2954. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ]\n\n\n******\n[2] New Zealand (Dunedin, Otago)\nDate: Thu 17 Aug 2017 19:45 NZST\nSource: Stuff [edited]\nhttp://tinyurl.com/y7a56fv5\n\n\nUniversity of Otago students are being offered free booster shots after about 10 confirmed or suspected cases were reported in Dunedin [Otago, South Island].\n\nThree young people in Marlborough have contracted the contagious illness, with at least 1 case linked to an Auckland outbreak, while 2 have been confirmed in Nelson.\n\nNationally, an unusually high number of cases were reported from September 2016 to early 2017, and the Ministry of Health warned of \"an increased risk of further outbreaks\".\n\nAuckland reported 51 cases of mumps in the past month -- most aged 10 to 19 -- while several were recorded in Waikato earlier this year [2017].\n\nThe Auckland Regional Public Health Service said last month [July 2017] it was concerned not enough people were immunised in the face of the mumps outbreak.\n\nThe MMR vaccine is usually given in 2 doses, one at 15 months old and one at 4 years old.\n\nMost people recover from mumps, but it can have serious complications. The disease can cause inflammation of tissue surrounding the brain (meningitis), inflamed testicles or ovaries and deafness.\n\nMen hospitalised from the Auckland outbreak had pain and swelling in their testicles, known as orchitis, which in rare cases may lead to infertility.\n\nThe outbreak in Dunedin has prompted the Otago tertiary institution's student health team to offer free measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) booster shots to students who have not had two MMR vaccinations since 1990, or are unsure of their vaccination history.\n\nPro-vice-chancellor of health sciences Professor Peter Crampton, the convener of the university's pandemic planning group, said the group was \"determining our ongoing response as the situation develops.\"\n\nThe outbreak coincided with a large-scale boil water notice issued for parts of Dunedin, including the student quarter, after untreated water got into part of the town's drinking water supply on [Mon 14 Aug 2017].\n\nAll students and staff had been sent information about mumps. Information had been posted on social media.\n\nMarlborough medical officer of health Dr Andrew Lindsay said mumps is \"highly contagious\". It spreads through the air by breathing, coughing and sneezing, or through contact with infected saliva; by kissing or sharing food and drink. It usually takes 12-25 days before symptoms appear -- including pain in the jaw, fever, headache, and swollen glands around the face and body. People with mumps re infectious for 7 days before swelling starts and for 5 days after they cease.\n\nPersonal hygiene is essential to avoid catching mumps, including frequent hand washing, stopping coughs and sneezes in tissues, keeping at least 1 metre [3 ft] away from others and ensuring kitchens and bathrooms are clean.\n\nDr Jill Sherwood, public health physician with the ESR (the Institute of Environmental Science and Research), earlier said the MMR vaccine was not as effective in mumps as it was in measles and rubella. \"The mumps component is only about 85 per cent effective, whereas the measles component will most likely give you lifetime coverage,\" Sherwood said.\n\nThere have been no reported cases of mumps in Canterbury, a health board spokeswoman said.\n\n[Byline: Hamish Mcneilly, Jennifer Eder]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Maps of New Zealand can be seen at http://www.ezilon.com/maps/images/oceania/political-map-of-New-Zealan.gif and http://healthmap.org/promed/p/738. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ]\n\n******\n[3] Brazil (Manaus, Amazonas)\nDate: Fri 18 Aug 2017\nSource: Em Tempo [in Portuguese, trans. & summ., edited]\nhttp://www.emtempo.com.br/manaus-tem-surto-de-caxumba-com-230-casos/\n\n\nWith 230 cases of mumps in Manaus [Amazonas state] in 19 places, registered since April 2017, mainly in schools, the Municipal Health Department (Semsa) warns parents to keep the updated immunization booklet for children and adolescents.\n\nUp to 2016, there were no official mumps outbreak records in Manaus. In 2017, as of 18 Aug, there have been 230 cases reported from 19 localities, most of them in schools, which suggests low vaccination coverage in children and adolescents.

But on a campus like this, Christenson said anything over 3 cases is considered an outbreak.\n\n\"One of the challenges of mumps is that for the 1st 2 days that someone has it, before they have symptoms, they are already shedding or can be exposing other people to it,\" said Christenson.\n\nA couple years ago, the Minnesota Wild got caught in a mumps outbreak. And in February, the mumps again briefly sidelined forwards [ZP] and [JP]. Students believe that if it can spread quickly on a hockey team, it can spread just as quickly on campus.\n\n\"If you are at the library or something, this is such a huge school, it's so hard for things not to be spread around,\" said senior Maddie Trenholm.\n\nThat's why health officials are asking students or faculty who has been diagnosed to stay away for 5 days.\n\n\"It's really hard to predict how long this will be an issue and how many cases we might have,\" said Christenson.\n\nAnd with finals coming up, they are hoping to keep this from spreading as much as possible. The cases the university has seen so far are considered mild.\n\nA US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report in December 2016 shows that mumps are at a 10-year high -- and colleges seem to be especially hard hit by the contagious virus. The close quarters on campus make it easy for the disease to spread.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[From 1 Jan -- 25 Mar 2017, 42 states and the District of Columbia in the US reported 1965 cases of mumps to CDC.\n\nFrom year to year, mumps cases can range from roughly a couple hundred to a couple thousand. For example in 2016, there were approximately 5748 cases reported to CDC, and in 2012, there were 229. Before the US mumps vaccination program started in 1967, about 186 000 cases were reported each year, but the actual number of cases was likely much higher due to underreporting. Since the pre-vaccine era, there has been more than 99 percent decrease in mumps cases in the United States.\n\n(excerpted / edited from CDC.gov). - Mod.LK\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/354.]\nSee Also\nMumps update (15): New Zealand, USA 20170408.4958345\nMumps update (14): Australia (QL), USA 20170330.4935375\nMumps update (13): Portugal, Canada, USA, analysis 20170326.4924853\nMumps update (12): Canada (ON) USA (IL,AR) 20170324.4922098\nMumps update (11): USA 20170319.4911532\nMumps update (10) 20170314.4900923\nMumps update (09) 20170312.4895943\nMumps update (08): Canada, USA, comment 20170305.4880865\nMumps update (07): Canada, USA 20170303.4875855\nMumps update (06): USA 20170227.4864176\nMumps update (05): USA (PA, MO -

Health department officials in Texas have announced that cases of mumps have surged to a 20-year high, and there may have been a bunch of exposures on South Padre Island where spring-breakers are celebrating.\n\nState health officials have reported 221 cases of mumps so far this year [2017], the most since 1994 when there were 234 cases. Mumps results in swollen salivary grands, swollen testicles, low fever, tiredness, and muscle aches, with symptoms emerging about 16 -- 18 days after exposure.\n\nInfections of mumps dived 99 percent since a vaccine was developed and released in 1967. The mumps vaccine protects 88 percent of people who are fully vaccinated, although some vaccinated people can still get sick if exposed.\n\n\"The Texas Department of State Health Services is advising health care providers to be on alert for mumps in their patients as the state experiences a 20-year high in mumps cases,\" states the THHS website \"State, regional and local health departments are currently investigating multiple outbreaks throughout the state, including one involving possible exposures on South Padre Island, a popular spring break destination for students from Texas and elsewhere in the United States.

Health officials have also identified 17 unrelated cases in Mesquite, Dallas and DeSoto.\n\nParents at the meeting submitted questions. Many wanted to know how the mumps is spreading and why.\n\n\"You heard about the chicken pox, you heard about the meningitis, but the mumps you haven't heard about in so long, so you're kind of concerned, like can it cause death?\" said parent [SA].\n\n[A] has a daughter at Cedar Hill High School. Her child is vaccinated, but [A] is still concerned about the mumps outbreak that started at her child's school.\n\n\"What are we doing about this mumps outbreak? Are we cleaning the building?\" [A] asked.\n\nDistrict officials said the outbreak started at Cedar Hill High School in February [2017].\n\nSince then, more cases have been found at 9th Grade Center, Collegiate High School, Permenter Middle School and High Pointe Elementary. \"When you get a bunch of kids all contained in small pockets of areas, like schools, the likelihood of spreading an airborne virus is gonna happen,\" said Cedar Hill ISD superintendent Orlando Riddick.\n\nOfficials don't know the source but said they're doing their best to keep the situation under control.\n\n\"We've started our cleaning processes and cleaning high touch areas,\" superintendent Riddick said. \"We began to disinfect schools with a misting machine.\"\n\nThe district has also hosted 4 vaccine booster clinics, saying more than 90 percent of their students are vaccinated.\n\nThe district's health director, Dr Michael Marshall, said infected people could be unknowingly spreading mumps.\n\n\"The problem is simply that people are coming to school who are infected with the mumps and they don't know it,\" said Dr Marshall.\n\nAccording to doctors, it can take up to 25 days until symptoms like fever, headache and loss of appetite show up. Some who are infected have no symptoms.\n\nParent [AG] said the district should be transparent about the outbreak. \"Just be transparent and make sure our building is clean and that it's safe for our children and teachers,\"[G] said.\n\nAccording to health officials, those without the mumps vaccine are most at risk. Doctors recommend at least 2 vaccines, and even a 3rd booster shot to increase protection.

But even then, it's still possible to contract the disease.\n\nUp to 6 reported cases of mumps so far at the University may not seem like a large number. But on a campus like this, Christenson said anything over 3 cases is considered an outbreak.\n\n\"One of the challenges of mumps is that for the 1st 2 days that someone has it, before they have symptoms, they are already shedding or can be exposing other people to it,\" said Christenson.\n\nA couple years ago, the Minnesota Wild got caught in a mumps outbreak. And in February, the mumps again briefly sidelined forwards [ZP] and [JP]. Students believe that if it can spread quickly on a hockey team, it can spread just as quickly on campus.\n\n\"If you are at the library or something, this is such a huge school, it's so hard for things not to be spread around,\" said senior Maddie Trenholm.\n\nThat's why health officials are asking students or faculty who has been diagnosed to stay away for 5 days.\n\n\"It's really hard to predict how long this will be an issue and how many cases we might have,\" said Christenson.\n\nAnd with finals coming up, they are hoping to keep this from spreading as much as possible. The cases the university has seen so far are considered mild.\n\nA US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report in December 2016 shows that mumps are at a 10-year high -- and colleges seem to be especially hard hit by the contagious virus. The close quarters on campus make it easy for the disease to spread.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[From 1 Jan -- 25 Mar 2017, 42 states and the District of Columbia in the US reported 1965 cases of mumps to CDC.\n\nFrom year to year, mumps cases can range from roughly a couple hundred to a couple thousand. For example in 2016, there were approximately 5748 cases reported to CDC, and in 2012, there were 229. Before the US mumps vaccination program started in 1967, about 186 000 cases were reported each year, but the actual number of cases was likely much higher due to underreporting. Since the pre-vaccine era, there has been more than 99 percent decrease in mumps cases in the United States.\n\n(excerpted / edited from CDC.gov). - Mod.LK\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/354.]\nSee Also\nMumps update (15): New Zealand, USA 20170408.4958345\nMumps update (14): Australia (QL), USA 20170330.4935375\nMumps update (13): Portugal, Canada, USA, analysis 20170326.4924853\nMumps update (12): Canada (ON) USA (IL,AR) 20170324.4922098\nMumps update (11): USA 20170319.4911532\nMumps update (10) 20170314.4900923\nMumps update (09) 20170312.4895943\nMumps update (08): Canada, USA, comment 20170305.4880865\nMumps update (07): Canada, USA 20170303.4875855\nMumps update (06): USA 20170227.4864176\nMumps update (05): USA (PA, MO -

Students believe that if it can spread quickly on a hockey team, it can spread just as quickly on campus.\n\n\"If you are at the library or something, this is such a huge school, it's so hard for things not to be spread around,\" said senior Maddie Trenholm.\n\nThat's why health officials are asking students or faculty who has been diagnosed to stay away for 5 days.\n\n\"It's really hard to predict how long this will be an issue and how many cases we might have,\" said Christenson.\n\nAnd with finals coming up, they are hoping to keep this from spreading as much as possible. The cases the university has seen so far are considered mild.\n\nA US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report in December 2016 shows that mumps are at a 10-year high -- and colleges seem to be especially hard hit by the contagious virus. The close quarters on campus make it easy for the disease to spread.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[From 1 Jan -- 25 Mar 2017, 42 states and the District of Columbia in the US reported 1965 cases of mumps to CDC.\n\nFrom year to year, mumps cases can range from roughly a couple hundred to a couple thousand. For example in 2016, there were approximately 5748 cases reported to CDC, and in 2012, there were 229. Before the US mumps vaccination program started in 1967, about 186 000 cases were reported each year, but the actual number of cases was likely much higher due to underreporting. Since the pre-vaccine era, there has been more than 99 percent decrease in mumps cases in the United States.\n\n(excerpted / edited from CDC.gov). - Mod.LK\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/354.]\nSee Also\nMumps update (15): New Zealand, USA 20170408.4958345\nMumps update (14): Australia (QL), USA 20170330.4935375\nMumps update (13): Portugal, Canada, USA, analysis 20170326.4924853\nMumps update (12): Canada (ON) USA (IL,AR) 20170324.4922098\nMumps update (11): USA 20170319.4911532\nMumps update (10) 20170314.4900923\nMumps update (09) 20170312.4895943\nMumps update (08): Canada, USA, comment 20170305.4880865\nMumps update (07): Canada, USA 20170303.4875855\nMumps update (06): USA 20170227.4864176\nMumps update (05): USA (PA, MO -

Health department officials in Texas have announced that cases of mumps have surged to a 20-year high, and there may have been a bunch of exposures on South Padre Island where spring-breakers are celebrating.\n\nState health officials have reported 221 cases of mumps so far this year [2017], the most since 1994 when there were 234 cases. Mumps results in swollen salivary grands, swollen testicles, low fever, tiredness, and muscle aches, with symptoms emerging about 16 -- 18 days after exposure.\n\nInfections of mumps dived 99 percent since a vaccine was developed and released in 1967. The mumps vaccine protects 88 percent of people who are fully vaccinated, although some vaccinated people can still get sick if exposed.\n\n\"The Texas Department of State Health Services is advising health care providers to be on alert for mumps in their patients as the state experiences a 20-year high in mumps cases,\" states the THHS website \"State, regional and local health departments are currently investigating multiple outbreaks throughout the state, including one involving possible exposures on South Padre Island, a popular spring break destination for students from Texas and elsewhere in the United States.

Health officials have also identified 17 unrelated cases in Mesquite, Dallas and DeSoto.\n\nParents at the meeting submitted questions. Many wanted to know how the mumps is spreading and why.\n\n\"You heard about the chicken pox, you heard about the meningitis, but the mumps you haven't heard about in so long, so you're kind of concerned, like can it cause death?\" said parent [SA].\n\n[A] has a daughter at Cedar Hill High School. Her child is vaccinated, but [A] is still concerned about the mumps outbreak that started at her child's school.\n\n\"What are we doing about this mumps outbreak? Are we cleaning the building?\" [A] asked.\n\nDistrict officials said the outbreak started at Cedar Hill High School in February [2017].\n\nSince then, more cases have been found at 9th Grade Center, Collegiate High School, Permenter Middle School and High Pointe Elementary. \"When you get a bunch of kids all contained in small pockets of areas, like schools, the likelihood of spreading an airborne virus is gonna happen,\" said Cedar Hill ISD superintendent Orlando Riddick.\n\nOfficials don't know the source but said they're doing their best to keep the situation under control.\n\n\"We've started our cleaning processes and cleaning high touch areas,\" superintendent Riddick said. \"We began to disinfect schools with a misting machine.\"\n\nThe district has also hosted 4 vaccine booster clinics, saying more than 90 percent of their students are vaccinated.\n\nThe district's health director, Dr Michael Marshall, said infected people could be unknowingly spreading mumps.\n\n\"The problem is simply that people are coming to school who are infected with the mumps and they don't know it,\" said Dr Marshall.\n\nAccording to doctors, it can take up to 25 days until symptoms like fever, headache and loss of appetite show up. Some who are infected have no symptoms.\n\nParent [AG] said the district should be transparent about the outbreak. \"Just be transparent and make sure our building is clean and that it's safe for our children and teachers,\"[G] said.\n\nAccording to health officials, those without the mumps vaccine are most at risk. Doctors recommend at least 2 vaccines, and even a 3rd booster shot to increase protection. However, one can still get mumps even with the proper vaccines.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[3] Minnesota\nDate: Fri 21 APR 2017 11:30 PM\nSource: CBS News [edited]\nhttp://www.cbsnews.com/news/mumps-outbreak-reported-at-university-of-minnesota/\n\n\nUniversity of Minnesota health officials are warning students about a mumps outbreak on campus, CBS Minnesota reports.\n\nSo far there have been 6 reported cases, campus health officials say.\n\nIt's considered highly contagious and the disease is spread by coughing, sneezing or sharing items that you eat or drink.\n\nThe symptoms are pretty clear -- puffy cheeks, a swollen jaw accompanied by a fever, headaches and loss of appetite.\n\n\"I've been at Boynton Health for 20 years and we have not had this situation before,\" said Dr Gary Christenson, the chief medical officer at the University of Minnesota.\n\nChristenson said students are required to be vaccinated for mumps before they come to school, with a few exceptions.

But even then, it's still possible to contract the disease.\n\nUp to 6 reported cases of mumps so far at the University may not seem like a large number. But on a campus like this, Christenson said anything over 3 cases is considered an outbreak.\n\n\"One of the challenges of mumps is that for the 1st 2 days that someone has it, before they have symptoms, they are already shedding or can be exposing other people to it,\" said Christenson.\n\nA couple years ago, the Minnesota Wild got caught in a mumps outbreak. And in February, the mumps again briefly sidelined forwards [ZP] and [JP]. Students believe that if it can spread quickly on a hockey team, it can spread just as quickly on campus.\n\n\"If you are at the library or something, this is such a huge school, it's so hard for things not to be spread around,\" said senior Maddie Trenholm.\n\nThat's why health officials are asking students or faculty who has been diagnosed to stay away for 5 days.\n\n\"It's really hard to predict how long this will be an issue and how many cases we might have,\" said Christenson.\n\nAnd with finals coming up, they are hoping to keep this from spreading as much as possible. The cases the university has seen so far are considered mild.\n\nA US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report in December 2016 shows that mumps are at a 10-year high -- and colleges seem to be especially hard hit by the contagious virus. The close quarters on campus make it easy for the disease to spread.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[From 1 Jan -- 25 Mar 2017, 42 states and the District of Columbia in the US reported 1965 cases of mumps to CDC.\n\nFrom year to year, mumps cases can range from roughly a couple hundred to a couple thousand. For example in 2016, there were approximately 5748 cases reported to CDC, and in 2012, there were 229. Before the US mumps vaccination program started in 1967, about 186 000 cases were reported each year, but the actual number of cases was likely much higher due to underreporting. Since the pre-vaccine era, there has been more than 99 percent decrease in mumps cases in the United States.\n\n(excerpted / edited from CDC.gov). - Mod.LK\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/354.]\nSee Also\nMumps update (15): New Zealand, USA 20170408.4958345\nMumps update (14): Australia (QL), USA 20170330.4935375\nMumps update (13): Portugal, Canada, USA, analysis 20170326.4924853\nMumps update (12): Canada (ON) USA (IL,AR) 20170324.4922098\nMumps update (11): USA 20170319.4911532\nMumps update (10) 20170314.4900923\nMumps update (09) 20170312.4895943\nMumps update (08): Canada, USA, comment 20170305.4880865\nMumps update (07): Canada, USA 20170303.4875855\nMumps update (06): USA 20170227.4864176\nMumps update (05): USA (PA, MO -

Students believe that if it can spread quickly on a hockey team, it can spread just as quickly on campus.\n\n\"If you are at the library or something, this is such a huge school, it's so hard for things not to be spread around,\" said senior Maddie Trenholm.\n\nThat's why health officials are asking students or faculty who has been diagnosed to stay away for 5 days.\n\n\"It's really hard to predict how long this will be an issue and how many cases we might have,\" said Christenson.\n\nAnd with finals coming up, they are hoping to keep this from spreading as much as possible. The cases the university has seen so far are considered mild.\n\nA US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report in December 2016 shows that mumps are at a 10-year high -- and colleges seem to be especially hard hit by the contagious virus. The close quarters on campus make it easy for the disease to spread.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[From 1 Jan -- 25 Mar 2017, 42 states and the District of Columbia in the US reported 1965 cases of mumps to CDC.\n\nFrom year to year, mumps cases can range from roughly a couple hundred to a couple thousand. For example in 2016, there were approximately 5748 cases reported to CDC, and in 2012, there were 229. Before the US mumps vaccination program started in 1967, about 186 000 cases were reported each year, but the actual number of cases was likely much higher due to underreporting. Since the pre-vaccine era, there has been more than 99 percent decrease in mumps cases in the United States.\n\n(excerpted / edited from CDC.gov). - Mod.LK\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/354.]\nSee Also\nMumps update (15): New Zealand, USA 20170408.4958345\nMumps update (14): Australia (QL), USA 20170330.4935375\nMumps update (13): Portugal, Canada, USA, analysis 20170326.4924853\nMumps update (12): Canada (ON) USA (IL,AR) 20170324.4922098\nMumps update (11): USA 20170319.4911532\nMumps update (10) 20170314.4900923\nMumps update (09) 20170312.4895943\nMumps update (08): Canada, USA, comment 20170305.4880865\nMumps update (07): Canada, USA 20170303.4875855\nMumps update (06): USA 20170227.4864176\nMumps update (05): USA (PA, MO -

Health department officials in Texas have announced that cases of mumps have surged to a 20-year high, and there may have been a bunch of exposures on South Padre Island where spring-breakers are celebrating.\n\nState health officials have reported 221 cases of mumps so far this year [2017], the most since 1994 when there were 234 cases. Mumps results in swollen salivary grands, swollen testicles, low fever, tiredness, and muscle aches, with symptoms emerging about 16 -- 18 days after exposure.\n\nInfections of mumps dived 99 percent since a vaccine was developed and released in 1967. The mumps vaccine protects 88 percent of people who are fully vaccinated, although some vaccinated people can still get sick if exposed.\n\n\"The Texas Department of State Health Services is advising health care providers to be on alert for mumps in their patients as the state experiences a 20-year high in mumps cases,\" states the THHS website \"State, regional and local health departments are currently investigating multiple outbreaks throughout the state, including one involving possible exposures on South Padre Island, a popular spring break destination for students from Texas and elsewhere in the United States.

Health officials have also identified 17 unrelated cases in Mesquite, Dallas and DeSoto.\n\nParents at the meeting submitted questions. Many wanted to know how the mumps is spreading and why.\n\n\"You heard about the chicken pox, you heard about the meningitis, but the mumps you haven't heard about in so long, so you're kind of concerned, like can it cause death?\" said parent [SA].\n\n[A] has a daughter at Cedar Hill High School. Her child is vaccinated, but [A] is still concerned about the mumps outbreak that started at her child's school.\n\n\"What are we doing about this mumps outbreak? Are we cleaning the building?\" [A] asked.\n\nDistrict officials said the outbreak started at Cedar Hill High School in February [2017].\n\nSince then, more cases have been found at 9th Grade Center, Collegiate High School, Permenter Middle School and High Pointe Elementary. \"When you get a bunch of kids all contained in small pockets of areas, like schools, the likelihood of spreading an airborne virus is gonna happen,\" said Cedar Hill ISD superintendent Orlando Riddick.\n\nOfficials don't know the source but said they're doing their best to keep the situation under control.\n\n\"We've started our cleaning processes and cleaning high touch areas,\" superintendent Riddick said. \"We began to disinfect schools with a misting machine.\"\n\nThe district has also hosted 4 vaccine booster clinics, saying more than 90 percent of their students are vaccinated.\n\nThe district's health director, Dr Michael Marshall, said infected people could be unknowingly spreading mumps.\n\n\"The problem is simply that people are coming to school who are infected with the mumps and they don't know it,\" said Dr Marshall.\n\nAccording to doctors, it can take up to 25 days until symptoms like fever, headache and loss of appetite show up. Some who are infected have no symptoms.\n\nParent [AG] said the district should be transparent about the outbreak. \"Just be transparent and make sure our building is clean and that it's safe for our children and teachers,\"[G] said.\n\nAccording to health officials, those without the mumps vaccine are most at risk. Doctors recommend at least 2 vaccines, and even a 3rd booster shot to increase protection.

It is a vaccine-preventable disease that without vaccination is a very contagious disease that is most serious for babies. People with whooping cough usually spread the disease by coughing or sneezing while in close contact with others. Parents, older siblings, or other caregivers can give whooping cough to babies without even knowing they have the disease.\n\nYoung babies can get pneumonia (lung infection), and many have trouble breathing. About half of babies younger than one year old who get whooping cough end up in the hospital, and a few even die from the disease.\n\nBabies need protection because they can catch whooping cough from anyone around them, and it can make them very sick. Babies get protection from whooping cough vaccines in 3 important ways:\n- Through the Mother when she gets the whooping cough vaccine in the 3rd trimester of pregnancy.\n- By being surrounded with family members and caregivers who are up-to-date with their whooping cough vaccine.\n- By getting all doses of the whooping cough vaccine according to CDC's recommended schedule [excerpted and edited from CDC].\n\nA map of Canada showing the location of New Brunswick province can be found at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/269.

This vaccination clinic is specifically for members of Southeast's Greek community, who health officials say have the greatest known risk factors and where the confirmed mumps cases are most concentrated.\n\nStudents who are not members of a fraternity or sorority can get a 3rd MMR dose by visiting the Campus Health Clinic. ... Students who are not part of the Greek community have a lower risk of contracting mumps based upon currently confirmed and suspected cases.\n\nThe reports at Southeast come on the heels of a mumps outbreak on the campus of the University of Missouri-Columbia reported this past fall [2016]. At the University of Missouri-Columbia, 350 confirmed and probable cases of mumps have been reported as of 23 Feb 2017.\n\nAccording to the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services, the majority of cases continue to be reported among university students; 14 other colleges and universities across the State of Missouri have reported confirmed or suspected cases of mumps since August 2016.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[There has been an increasing number of reports of mumps cases on campuses in the US because of the lifestyle of students and their age, which reflects time since a 2nd vaccination with MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine. The mumps component of the MMR vaccine is about 88 percent effective when a person gets 2 doses. More than 5000 cases of mumps were reported last year, 2016, in the United States, of which 19 outbreaks occurred on college campuses. This is the most in a decade. But importantly, even with infection with the mumps virus, those who have been vaccinated have fewer severe complications. A 3rd vaccine dose is being considered as a preventative measure. There is some evidence that this additional dose may help control mumps outbreaks among populations with preexisting high 2-dose vaccine coverage. - Mod.LK]\n\n******\n[5] Comment in response to RFI in ProMED-mail posts Mumps update (05) & (06)\nDate: Sun 5 Mar 2017\nFrom: Kamran Kadkhoda <kamrankadkhoda@gmail.com> [edited]\n\n\n[Dr. Kadkhoda is responding to the RFI concerning the high incidence of mumps in previously vaccinated individuals, particularly young adults. From his response below, there clearly are a number of avenues to pursue to more fully understand the problem. ProMED-mail thanks Dr. Kadkhoda for his response. - Mod.LK]:\n\nThe best explanation so far is secondary vaccine failure/waning immunity: during the 1st decade or so after the vaccine, which uses genotype A strains, there's adequate cross-neutralization across different mumps genotypes, but after neutralization, capacity against non-A genotypes such as G wanes, then people may come down with clinical mumps. It'll be intriguing to see whether sub-neutralizing anti-mumps antibody levels help a new infection establish itself through antibody-dependent enhancement. It is also known that some HLA haplotypes play a role even in primary vaccine failure. All in all, significant pathogen inoculum should be another important factor on top of those mentioned above.\n\n--\nKamran Kadkhoda, Ph.D., D(ABMM), D(ABMLI)\nAssistant Professor - Clinical Microbiologist\nCadham Provincial Public Health Laboratory\nAdjunct Professor -

Parents, older siblings, or other caregivers can give whooping cough to babies without even knowing they have the disease.\n\nYoung babies can get pneumonia (lung infection), and many have trouble breathing. About half of babies younger than one year old who get whooping cough end up in the hospital, and a few even die from the disease.\n\nBabies need protection because they can catch whooping cough from anyone around them, and it can make them very sick. Babies get protection from whooping cough vaccines in 3 important ways:\n- Through the Mother when she gets the whooping cough vaccine in the 3rd trimester of pregnancy.\n- By being surrounded with family members and caregivers who are up-to-date with their whooping cough vaccine.\n- By getting all doses of the whooping cough vaccine according to CDC's recommended schedule [excerpted and edited from CDC].\n\nA map of Canada showing the location of New Brunswick province can be found at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/269.

It is spread from person to person through coughing, sneezing, and coming into contact with a person's saliva by sharing drinks or utensils, food or water bottles, or by kissing. A major factor contributing to outbreaks is being in a crowded environment, such as attending the same class, playing on the same sports team or living in a dormitory with a person who has the mumps.\n\n[Byline: Robert Herriman]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[As of 4 Mar 2017, another 5 cases of mumps have been confirmed in Toronto, bringing the total to 22 this year (2017) in Toronto.

It is a vaccine-preventable disease that without vaccination is a very contagious disease that is most serious for babies. People with whooping cough usually spread the disease by coughing or sneezing while in close contact with others. Parents, older siblings, or other caregivers can give whooping cough to babies without even knowing they have the disease.\n\nYoung babies can get pneumonia (lung infection), and many have trouble breathing. About half of babies younger than one year old who get whooping cough end up in the hospital, and a few even die from the disease.\n\nBabies need protection because they can catch whooping cough from anyone around them, and it can make them very sick. Babies get protection from whooping cough vaccines in 3 important ways:\n- Through the Mother when she gets the whooping cough vaccine in the 3rd trimester of pregnancy.\n- By being surrounded with family members and caregivers who are up-to-date with their whooping cough vaccine.\n- By getting all doses of the whooping cough vaccine according to CDC's recommended schedule [excerpted and edited from CDC].\n\nA map of Canada showing the location of New Brunswick province can be found at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/269.

This vaccination clinic is specifically for members of Southeast's Greek community, who health officials say have the greatest known risk factors and where the confirmed mumps cases are most concentrated.\n\nStudents who are not members of a fraternity or sorority can get a 3rd MMR dose by visiting the Campus Health Clinic. ... Students who are not part of the Greek community have a lower risk of contracting mumps based upon currently confirmed and suspected cases.\n\nThe reports at Southeast come on the heels of a mumps outbreak on the campus of the University of Missouri-Columbia reported this past fall [2016]. At the University of Missouri-Columbia, 350 confirmed and probable cases of mumps have been reported as of 23 Feb 2017.\n\nAccording to the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services, the majority of cases continue to be reported among university students; 14 other colleges and universities across the State of Missouri have reported confirmed or suspected cases of mumps since August 2016.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[There has been an increasing number of reports of mumps cases on campuses in the US because of the lifestyle of students and their age, which reflects time since a 2nd vaccination with MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine. The mumps component of the MMR vaccine is about 88 percent effective when a person gets 2 doses. More than 5000 cases of mumps were reported last year, 2016, in the United States, of which 19 outbreaks occurred on college campuses. This is the most in a decade. But importantly, even with infection with the mumps virus, those who have been vaccinated have fewer severe complications. A 3rd vaccine dose is being considered as a preventative measure. There is some evidence that this additional dose may help control mumps outbreaks among populations with preexisting high 2-dose vaccine coverage. - Mod.LK]\n\n******\n[5] Comment in response to RFI in ProMED-mail posts Mumps update (05) & (06)\nDate: Sun 5 Mar 2017\nFrom: Kamran Kadkhoda <kamrankadkhoda@gmail.com> [edited]\n\n\n[Dr. Kadkhoda is responding to the RFI concerning the high incidence of mumps in previously vaccinated individuals, particularly young adults. From his response below, there clearly are a number of avenues to pursue to more fully understand the problem. ProMED-mail thanks Dr. Kadkhoda for his response. - Mod.LK]:\n\nThe best explanation so far is secondary vaccine failure/waning immunity: during the 1st decade or so after the vaccine, which uses genotype A strains, there's adequate cross-neutralization across different mumps genotypes, but after neutralization, capacity against non-A genotypes such as G wanes, then people may come down with clinical mumps. It'll be intriguing to see whether sub-neutralizing anti-mumps antibody levels help a new infection establish itself through antibody-dependent enhancement. It is also known that some HLA haplotypes play a role even in primary vaccine failure. All in all, significant pathogen inoculum should be another important factor on top of those mentioned above.\n\n--\nKamran Kadkhoda, Ph.D., D(ABMM), D(ABMLI)\nAssistant Professor - Clinical Microbiologist\nCadham Provincial Public Health Laboratory\nAdjunct Professor -

About half of babies younger than one year old who get whooping cough end up in the hospital, and a few even die from the disease.\n\nBabies need protection because they can catch whooping cough from anyone around them, and it can make them very sick. Babies get protection from whooping cough vaccines in 3 important ways:\n- Through the Mother when she gets the whooping cough vaccine in the 3rd trimester of pregnancy.\n- By being surrounded with family members and caregivers who are up-to-date with their whooping cough vaccine.\n- By getting all doses of the whooping cough vaccine according to CDC's recommended schedule [excerpted and edited from CDC].\n\nA map of Canada showing the location of New Brunswick province can be found at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/269.

It is spread from person to person through coughing, sneezing, and coming into contact with a person's saliva by sharing drinks or utensils, food or water bottles, or by kissing.

It is a vaccine-preventable disease that without vaccination is a very contagious disease that is most serious for babies. People with whooping cough usually spread the disease by coughing or sneezing while in close contact with others. Parents, older siblings, or other caregivers can give whooping cough to babies without even knowing they have the disease.\n\nYoung babies can get pneumonia (lung infection), and many have trouble breathing. About half of babies younger than one year old who get whooping cough end up in the hospital, and a few even die from the disease.\n\nBabies need protection because they can catch whooping cough from anyone around them, and it can make them very sick. Babies get protection from whooping cough vaccines in 3 important ways:\n- Through the Mother when she gets the whooping cough vaccine in the 3rd trimester of pregnancy.\n- By being surrounded with family members and caregivers who are up-to-date with their whooping cough vaccine.\n- By getting all doses of the whooping cough vaccine according to CDC's recommended schedule [excerpted and edited from CDC].\n\nA map of Canada showing the location of New Brunswick province can be found at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/269.

This vaccination clinic is specifically for members of Southeast's Greek community, who health officials say have the greatest known risk factors and where the confirmed mumps cases are most concentrated.\n\nStudents who are not members of a fraternity or sorority can get a 3rd MMR dose by visiting the Campus Health Clinic. ... Students who are not part of the Greek community have a lower risk of contracting mumps based upon currently confirmed and suspected cases.\n\nThe reports at Southeast come on the heels of a mumps outbreak on the campus of the University of Missouri-Columbia reported this past fall [2016]. At the University of Missouri-Columbia, 350 confirmed and probable cases of mumps have been reported as of 23 Feb 2017.\n\nAccording to the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services, the majority of cases continue to be reported among university students; 14 other colleges and universities across the State of Missouri have reported confirmed or suspected cases of mumps since August 2016.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[There has been an increasing number of reports of mumps cases on campuses in the US because of the lifestyle of students and their age, which reflects time since a 2nd vaccination with MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine. The mumps component of the MMR vaccine is about 88 percent effective when a person gets 2 doses. More than 5000 cases of mumps were reported last year, 2016, in the United States, of which 19 outbreaks occurred on college campuses. This is the most in a decade. But importantly, even with infection with the mumps virus, those who have been vaccinated have fewer severe complications. A 3rd vaccine dose is being considered as a preventative measure. There is some evidence that this additional dose may help control mumps outbreaks among populations with preexisting high 2-dose vaccine coverage. - Mod.LK]\n\n******\n[5] Comment in response to RFI in ProMED-mail posts Mumps update (05) & (06)\nDate: Sun 5 Mar 2017\nFrom: Kamran Kadkhoda <kamrankadkhoda@gmail.com> [edited]\n\n\n[Dr. Kadkhoda is responding to the RFI concerning the high incidence of mumps in previously vaccinated individuals, particularly young adults. From his response below, there clearly are a number of avenues to pursue to more fully understand the problem. ProMED-mail thanks Dr. Kadkhoda for his response. - Mod.LK]:\n\nThe best explanation so far is secondary vaccine failure/waning immunity: during the 1st decade or so after the vaccine, which uses genotype A strains, there's adequate cross-neutralization across different mumps genotypes, but after neutralization, capacity against non-A genotypes such as G wanes, then people may come down with clinical mumps. It'll be intriguing to see whether sub-neutralizing anti-mumps antibody levels help a new infection establish itself through antibody-dependent enhancement. It is also known that some HLA haplotypes play a role even in primary vaccine failure. All in all, significant pathogen inoculum should be another important factor on top of those mentioned above.\n\n--\nKamran Kadkhoda, Ph.D., D(ABMM), D(ABMLI)\nAssistant Professor - Clinical Microbiologist\nCadham Provincial Public Health Laboratory\nAdjunct Professor -

About half of babies younger than one year old who get whooping cough end up in the hospital, and a few even die from the disease.\n\nBabies need protection because they can catch whooping cough from anyone around them, and it can make them very sick. Babies get protection from whooping cough vaccines in 3 important ways:\n- Through the Mother when she gets the whooping cough vaccine in the 3rd trimester of pregnancy.\n- By being surrounded with family members and caregivers who are up-to-date with their whooping cough vaccine.\n- By getting all doses of the whooping cough vaccine according to CDC's recommended schedule [excerpted and edited from CDC].\n\nA map of Canada showing the location of New Brunswick province can be found at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/269.

This vaccination clinic is specifically for members of Southeast's Greek community, who health officials say have the greatest known risk factors and where the confirmed mumps cases are most concentrated.\n\nStudents who are not members of a fraternity or sorority can get a 3rd MMR dose by visiting the Campus Health Clinic. ... Students who are not part of the Greek community have a lower risk of contracting mumps based upon currently confirmed and suspected cases.\n\nThe reports at Southeast come on the heels of a mumps outbreak on the campus of the University of Missouri-Columbia reported this past fall [2016]. At the University of Missouri-Columbia, 350 confirmed and probable cases of mumps have been reported as of 23 Feb 2017.\n\nAccording to the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services, the majority of cases continue to be reported among university students; 14 other colleges and universities across the State of Missouri have reported confirmed or suspected cases of mumps since August 2016.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[There has been an increasing number of reports of mumps cases on campuses in the US because of the lifestyle of students and their age, which reflects time since a 2nd vaccination with MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine. The mumps component of the MMR vaccine is about 88 percent effective when a person gets 2 doses. More than 5000 cases of mumps were reported last year, 2016, in the United States, of which 19 outbreaks occurred on college campuses. This is the most in a decade. But importantly, even with infection with the mumps virus, those who have been vaccinated have fewer severe complications. A 3rd vaccine dose is being considered as a preventative measure. There is some evidence that this additional dose may help control mumps outbreaks among populations with preexisting high 2-dose vaccine coverage. - Mod.LK]\n\n******\n[5] Comment in response to RFI in ProMED-mail posts Mumps update (05) & (06)\nDate: Sun 5 Mar 2017\nFrom: Kamran Kadkhoda <kamrankadkhoda@gmail.com> [edited]\n\n\n[Dr. Kadkhoda is responding to the RFI concerning the high incidence of mumps in previously vaccinated individuals, particularly young adults. From his response below, there clearly are a number of avenues to pursue to more fully understand the problem. ProMED-mail thanks Dr. Kadkhoda for his response. - Mod.LK]:\n\nThe best explanation so far is secondary vaccine failure/waning immunity: during the 1st decade or so after the vaccine, which uses genotype A strains, there's adequate cross-neutralization across different mumps genotypes, but after neutralization, capacity against non-A genotypes such as G wanes, then people may come down with clinical mumps. It'll be intriguing to see whether sub-neutralizing anti-mumps antibody levels help a new infection establish itself through antibody-dependent enhancement. It is also known that some HLA haplotypes play a role even in primary vaccine failure. All in all, significant pathogen inoculum should be another important factor on top of those mentioned above.\n\n--\nKamran Kadkhoda, Ph.D., D(ABMM), D(ABMLI)\nAssistant Professor - Clinical Microbiologist\nCadham Provincial Public Health Laboratory\nAdjunct Professor - Department of Immunology\nUniversity of Manitoba\nInvestigator at Children's Hospital Research Institute of Manitoba (CHRIM)\n<kamrankadkhoda@gmail.com>\nSee Also\nMumps update (07): Canada, USA 20170303.4875855\nMumps update (06): USA 20170227.4864176\nMumps update (05): USA (PA, MO - RFI), Canada (ON, AB) 20170223.4860461\nMumps update (04): USA (WA), New Zealand 20170211.4830961\nMumps update (03): USA (AR) 20170205.4817357\nMumps update (02): USA 20170129.4801141\nMumps update: USA (WA,TX) 20170110.4753366\n2016\n-----\nMumps - USA (33): (TX, AR) 20161221.4713166Mumps - USA (32): (OK, MO, NY) 20161218.4704809\nMumps - USA (31): (TX) colleges (WA) 20161214.4699512\nMumps - USA (30): (WA, NY) 20161209.4688282\nMumps - USA (29): (TX, CT, WA) 20161203.4673013\nMumps - USA (28): (OR,MO) 20161126.4655765\nMumps - USA (27): (NY) 20161123.4648552\nMumps - USA (26): universities, schools 20161119.4639792\nMumps - USA (25): (AR,NY) 20161109.4616380\nMumps - USA (24): (MO) 20161105.4609609\nMumps - USA (23): universities 20161027.4587708\nMumps - USA (22): (AR) 20161016.4562698\nMumps - USA (21) 20161001.4528777\nMumps - USA (20) 20161001.4528777\nMumps - USA (19) 20160917.4495932\nMumps - USA (18): (AR) 20160910.4478210\nMumps - USA (17): (AR) 20160902.4459649\nMumps - USA (16): (NY) 20160828.4446845\nMumps - USA (15): (New York City) alert 20160805.4395407\nMumps - USA (14): (NE, MI) 20160630.4319848\nMumps - USA (13): (NE) 20160602.4262176\nMumps - USA (12): (WI,NE,MA) 20160522.4237258\nMumps - USA (11): (MA) student cases 20160429.4192049\nMumps - USA (10): (IN,MA) student cases 20160415.4162668\nMumps - USA (07): (MT) student cases 20160318.4104627\nMumps - USA (06): (CA, NY) student cases 20160315.4095024\nMumps - USA (05): (MA) student cases 20160312.4088535\nMumps - USA (04): (MA, MT) student cases 20160311.4084267\nMumps - USA (03): (MA) student cases 20160308.4078373\nMumps - USA (02): (NH) student cases, alert 20160229.4057550\nMumps - USA: (CO,KY) increased incidence 20160225.4050452\n.................................................sb/lk/msp/ml", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "measles", "mumps", "pertussis", "rubella", "meningitis"], "syndromes": ["meningitis"], "event_date": ["2021-03-08 00:00:00", "2017-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-01 00:00:00", "2017-03-16 00:00:00", "2017-03-16 00:00:00", "2017-03-16 00:00:00", "2017-03-16 00:00:00", "1970-03-16 00:00:00", "2017-03-16 00:00:00", "2017-03-16 00:00:00", "2017-02-23 00:00:00", "2016-08-16 00:00:00", "2016-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-07 00:00:00", "2033-03-16 00:00:00", "2032-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-31 00:00:00", "2021-03-30 00:00:00", "2021-03-29 00:00:00", "2021-03-28 00:00:00", "2021-03-27 00:00:00", "2021-03-25 00:00:00", "2021-03-24 00:00:00", "2021-03-23 00:00:00", "2021-03-22 00:00:00", "2021-03-18 00:00:00", "2021-03-17 00:00:00", "2021-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-15 00:00:00", "2021-03-14 00:00:00", "2021-03-13 00:00:00", "2021-03-12 00:00:00", "2021-03-11 00:00:00", "2021-03-10 00:00:00", "2021-03-07 00:00:00", "2021-03-06 00:00:00", "2021-03-05 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "wjac", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Alberta", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Toronto", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "MT", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "New Brunswick", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "New Zealand", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Ontario", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Missouri", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "New Brunswickers", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "New York City", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "CANADA", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Pennsylvania", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "NE", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "US", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "the United States", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Edmonton", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Canada", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "USA", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "4875855", "headline": "PRO/EDR> Mumps update (07): Canada, USA", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=4875855", "date": "2016-12-26 10:43:43", "main_text": "MUMPS-USA (34): (ARKANSAS, TEXAS, MISSOURI)\n*******************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nIn this update:\n[1] Arkansas (Marshallese)\n[2] Texas: cheerleading competitions\n[3] Missouri (Kansas City)\n\n******\n[1] Arkansas (Marshallese)\nDate: Fri 23 Dec 2016 5:12 PM EST\nSource: El Nuevo Herald, The Associated Press (AP) report [in Spanish, trans.

The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette newspaper reported that the outbreak began in August 2016 (http://bit.ly/2hVVQYf).\n\nNate Smith, director of the State Health Department, said he doesn't know why so many people from the Marshall Islands are infected. Officials are investigating whether the vaccine is less effective for certain people. Smith said that the people of the Marshall Islands tend to live close to each other.\n\n\"It's a bit like a college dormitory in terms of intensity of exposure,\" he explained. Smith added that citizens of the Marshall Islands are involved in many community oriented events, where it is easy for transmission of infections.\n\nThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said that the epidemic in Arkansas is the largest since 2009 and 2010 when approximately 3000 people were infected in New York. Smith said that cases of mumps in Arkansas represent more than half of those reported this year [2016] at the national level.\n\nThe Department of Health had vaccinated almost 6600 people up to [Fri 23 Dec 2016]. Smith said that the efforts are showing results because only 12 cases were reported during the last 3 days of last week [week of 12 Dec 2016], \"which is really much less than we had for months.\"\n\nThe Marshall Islands are located in the Pacific Ocean, more than 3200 kilometers (2000 miles) southwest of Hawaii. About 12 000 of its citizens live in Northwest Arkansas.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-ESP\n<promed-esp@promedmail.org>\n\n[Mumps is a viral illness transmitted by the respiratory route, making dissemination possible in gatherings of people. The report does not specify the vaccination coverage of these citizens of the Marshall Islands who have developed the disease, which could be another factor contributing to this outbreak, apart from the possibility of lower effectiveness of the vaccine. It is necessary to investigate further in order to establish with certainty this behavior of the disease. - Mod.JG\n\nSee ProMED-mail Mumps - USA (21) 20161008.4545923 for reports of cases in other states in the United States -- Oklahoma and Washington -- and a discussion of the particular problem of providing protection to the Marshallese in Arkansas against vaccine-preventable diseases.\n\nA map showing the location of Arkansas in the United States can be found at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/208 - Mod.

DSHS said it has identified 11 mumps cases associated with this outbreak.\n\nA 2nd outbreak is being investigated in Johnson County, south of Fort Worth. Health officials have identified 72 cases in this outbreak, including 71 Johnson County residents and 1 Tarrant County resident. DSHS is working with school districts in the area to limit its spread since most of the cases are in students.\n\nMumps is spread by droplets of saliva or mucus from the mouth, nose, or throat of an infected person, usually when the infected person coughs, sneezes or talks. The virus can also be spread by sharing cups and utensils.\n\nSymptoms include swollen or tender salivary glands, low fever, tiredness and muscle aches. Men can also exhibit swollen or tender testicles.\n\nDSHS said people who are vaccinated can also contract the virus. The spread of mumps can be prevented or limited by covering coughs and sneezes, washing hands frequently with soap and water, and not sharing food or drinks.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[A map showing the location of Texas in the United States can be found at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/245.

At the moment, health agencies state that at least one case of an individual displaying mumps symptoms has been confirmed, says the Kansas City Health Department. As a consequence, an advisory has been issued on Thursday afternoon [22 Dec 2016].\n\nRex Archer, head of the Kansas City Health Department urges people who contracted the disease to stay inside, in order to contain the outbreak, via an official statement. In his plea, Mr Archer asks people to take several days off from either school or work-related duties for at least 5 days after the 1st symptoms emerge, such as the inflammation of the salivary glands. Rex Archer also says that individuals who came in contact with infected people could start displaying mumps symptoms anywhere in between 12 to 25 days after exposure to the virus. Ultimately, he recommends people who develop mumps symptoms to address their health care provider as soon as soon as possible. \"Questions about your immunity or vaccination status should be directed to your private physician\", says Rex Archer.\n\nAs of now, roughly 200 cases of infected individuals have been confirmed by the University of Missouri in Columbia. In order to contain the outbreak, Kansas City Health Department officials say that they are closely monitoring the progression of the local case. Not only this, but health officials also give out several tips that could prevent other individuals from contracting the disease.\n\nDoctors strongly recommend citizens to thoroughly wash their hands as often as possible, covering their mouths with anything other than their hands when sneezing, like tissues or elbow, and avoiding sharing spoons, forks, knives, or other eating utensils with infected subjects. Ultimately, the Health Department representatives also believe that one of the best ways for the population to stay mumps-free is by disinfecting surfaces that are frequently touched, such as doorknobs, counters, tables, and handles.\n\n[Byline: John Birks]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[A map showing the location of Missouri in the United States can be found at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/4145. -

The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette newspaper reported that the outbreak began in August 2016 (http://bit.ly/2hVVQYf).\n\nNate Smith, director of the State Health Department, said he doesn't know why so many people from the Marshall Islands are infected. Officials are investigating whether the vaccine is less effective for certain people. Smith said that the people of the Marshall Islands tend to live close to each other.\n\n\"It's a bit like a college dormitory in terms of intensity of exposure,\" he explained. Smith added that citizens of the Marshall Islands are involved in many community oriented events, where it is easy for transmission of infections.\n\nThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said that the epidemic in Arkansas is the largest since 2009 and 2010 when approximately 3000 people were infected in New York. Smith said that cases of mumps in Arkansas represent more than half of those reported this year [2016] at the national level.\n\nThe Department of Health had vaccinated almost 6600 people up to [Fri 23 Dec 2016]. Smith said that the efforts are showing results because only 12 cases were reported during the last 3 days of last week [week of 12 Dec 2016], \"which is really much less than we had for months.\"\n\nThe Marshall Islands are located in the Pacific Ocean, more than 3200 kilometers (2000 miles) southwest of Hawaii.

DSHS said it has identified 11 mumps cases associated with this outbreak.\n\nA 2nd outbreak is being investigated in Johnson County, south of Fort Worth. Health officials have identified 72 cases in this outbreak, including 71 Johnson County residents and 1 Tarrant County resident. DSHS is working with school districts in the area to limit its spread since most of the cases are in students.\n\nMumps is spread by droplets of saliva or mucus from the mouth, nose, or throat of an infected person, usually when the infected person coughs, sneezes or talks. The virus can also be spread by sharing cups and utensils.\n\nSymptoms include swollen or tender salivary glands, low fever, tiredness and muscle aches. Men can also exhibit swollen or tender testicles.\n\nDSHS said people who are vaccinated can also contract the virus. The spread of mumps can be prevented or limited by covering coughs and sneezes, washing hands frequently with soap and water, and not sharing food or drinks.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[A map showing the location of Texas in the United States can be found at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/245.

At the moment, health agencies state that at least one case of an individual displaying mumps symptoms has been confirmed, says the Kansas City Health Department. As a consequence, an advisory has been issued on Thursday afternoon [22 Dec 2016].\n\nRex Archer, head of the Kansas City Health Department urges people who contracted the disease to stay inside, in order to contain the outbreak, via an official statement. In his plea, Mr Archer asks people to take several days off from either school or work-related duties for at least 5 days after the 1st symptoms emerge, such as the inflammation of the salivary glands. Rex Archer also says that individuals who came in contact with infected people could start displaying mumps symptoms anywhere in between 12 to 25 days after exposure to the virus. Ultimately, he recommends people who develop mumps symptoms to address their health care provider as soon as soon as possible. \"Questions about your immunity or vaccination status should be directed to your private physician\", says Rex Archer.\n\nAs of now, roughly 200 cases of infected individuals have been confirmed by the University of Missouri in Columbia. In order to contain the outbreak, Kansas City Health Department officials say that they are closely monitoring the progression of the local case. Not only this, but health officials also give out several tips that could prevent other individuals from contracting the disease.\n\nDoctors strongly recommend citizens to thoroughly wash their hands as often as possible, covering their mouths with anything other than their hands when sneezing, like tissues or elbow, and avoiding sharing spoons, forks, knives, or other eating utensils with infected subjects. Ultimately, the Health Department representatives also believe that one of the best ways for the population to stay mumps-free is by disinfecting surfaces that are frequently touched, such as doorknobs, counters, tables, and handles.\n\n[Byline: John Birks]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[A map showing the location of Missouri in the United States can be found at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/4145. -

In order to contain the outbreak, Kansas City Health Department officials say that they are closely monitoring the progression of the local case. Not only this, but health officials also give out several tips that could prevent other individuals from contracting the disease.\n\nDoctors strongly recommend citizens to thoroughly wash their hands as often as possible, covering their mouths with anything other than their hands when sneezing, like tissues or elbow, and avoiding sharing spoons, forks, knives, or other eating utensils with infected subjects. Ultimately, the Health Department representatives also believe that one of the best ways for the population to stay mumps-free is by disinfecting surfaces that are frequently touched, such as doorknobs, counters, tables, and handles.\n\n[Byline: John Birks]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[A map showing the location of Missouri in the United States can be found at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/4145. -

The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette newspaper reported that the outbreak began in August 2016 (http://bit.ly/2hVVQYf).\n\nNate Smith, director of the State Health Department, said he doesn't know why so many people from the Marshall Islands are infected. Officials are investigating whether the vaccine is less effective for certain people. Smith said that the people of the Marshall Islands tend to live close to each other.\n\n\"It's a bit like a college dormitory in terms of intensity of exposure,\" he explained. Smith added that citizens of the Marshall Islands are involved in many community oriented events, where it is easy for transmission of infections.\n\nThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said that the epidemic in Arkansas is the largest since 2009 and 2010 when approximately 3000 people were infected in New York. Smith said that cases of mumps in Arkansas represent more than half of those reported this year [2016] at the national level.\n\nThe Department of Health had vaccinated almost 6600 people up to [Fri 23 Dec 2016]. Smith said that the efforts are showing results because only 12 cases were reported during the last 3 days of last week [week of 12 Dec 2016], \"which is really much less than we had for months.\"\n\nThe Marshall Islands are located in the Pacific Ocean, more than 3200 kilometers (2000 miles) southwest of Hawaii. About 12 000 of its citizens live in Northwest Arkansas.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-ESP\n<promed-esp@promedmail.org>\n\n[Mumps is a viral illness transmitted by the respiratory route, making dissemination possible in gatherings of people. The report does not specify the vaccination coverage of these citizens of the Marshall Islands who have developed the disease, which could be another factor contributing to this outbreak, apart from the possibility of lower effectiveness of the vaccine. It is necessary to investigate further in order to establish with certainty this behavior of the disease. - Mod.JG\n\nSee ProMED-mail Mumps - USA (21) 20161008.4545923 for reports of cases in other states in the United States -- Oklahoma and Washington -- and a discussion of the particular problem of providing protection to the Marshallese in Arkansas against vaccine-preventable diseases.\n\nA map showing the location of Arkansas in the United States can be found at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/208 - Mod.

DSHS said it has identified 11 mumps cases associated with this outbreak.\n\nA 2nd outbreak is being investigated in Johnson County, south of Fort Worth. Health officials have identified 72 cases in this outbreak, including 71 Johnson County residents and 1 Tarrant County resident. DSHS is working with school districts in the area to limit its spread since most of the cases are in students.\n\nMumps is spread by droplets of saliva or mucus from the mouth, nose, or throat of an infected person, usually when the infected person coughs, sneezes or talks. The virus can also be spread by sharing cups and utensils.\n\nSymptoms include swollen or tender salivary glands, low fever, tiredness and muscle aches. Men can also exhibit swollen or tender testicles.\n\nDSHS said people who are vaccinated can also contract the virus. The spread of mumps can be prevented or limited by covering coughs and sneezes, washing hands frequently with soap and water, and not sharing food or drinks.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[A map showing the location of Texas in the United States can be found at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/245.

At the moment, health agencies state that at least one case of an individual displaying mumps symptoms has been confirmed, says the Kansas City Health Department. As a consequence, an advisory has been issued on Thursday afternoon [22 Dec 2016].\n\nRex Archer, head of the Kansas City Health Department urges people who contracted the disease to stay inside, in order to contain the outbreak, via an official statement. In his plea, Mr Archer asks people to take several days off from either school or work-related duties for at least 5 days after the 1st symptoms emerge, such as the inflammation of the salivary glands. Rex Archer also says that individuals who came in contact with infected people could start displaying mumps symptoms anywhere in between 12 to 25 days after exposure to the virus. Ultimately, he recommends people who develop mumps symptoms to address their health care provider as soon as soon as possible. \"Questions about your immunity or vaccination status should be directed to your private physician\", says Rex Archer.\n\nAs of now, roughly 200 cases of infected individuals have been confirmed by the University of Missouri in Columbia.

The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette newspaper reported that the outbreak began in August 2016 (http://bit.ly/2hVVQYf).\n\nNate Smith, director of the State Health Department, said he doesn't know why so many people from the Marshall Islands are infected. Officials are investigating whether the vaccine is less effective for certain people. Smith said that the people of the Marshall Islands tend to live close to each other.\n\n\"It's a bit like a college dormitory in terms of intensity of exposure,\" he explained. Smith added that citizens of the Marshall Islands are involved in many community oriented events, where it is easy for transmission of infections.\n\nThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said that the epidemic in Arkansas is the largest since 2009 and 2010 when approximately 3000 people were infected in New York. Smith said that cases of mumps in Arkansas represent more than half of those reported this year [2016] at the national level.\n\nThe Department of Health had vaccinated almost 6600 people up to [Fri 23 Dec 2016]. Smith said that the efforts are showing results because only 12 cases were reported during the last 3 days of last week [week of 12 Dec 2016], \"which is really much less than we had for months.\"\n\nThe Marshall Islands are located in the Pacific Ocean, more than 3200 kilometers (2000 miles) southwest of Hawaii. About 12 000 of its citizens live in Northwest Arkansas.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-ESP\n<promed-esp@promedmail.org>\n\n[Mumps is a viral illness transmitted by the respiratory route, making dissemination possible in gatherings of people. The report does not specify the vaccination coverage of these citizens of the Marshall Islands who have developed the disease, which could be another factor contributing to this outbreak, apart from the possibility of lower effectiveness of the vaccine. It is necessary to investigate further in order to establish with certainty this behavior of the disease. - Mod.JG\n\nSee ProMED-mail Mumps - USA (21) 20161008.4545923 for reports of cases in other states in the United States -- Oklahoma and Washington -- and a discussion of the particular problem of providing protection to the Marshallese in Arkansas against vaccine-preventable diseases.\n\nA map showing the location of Arkansas in the United States can be found at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/208 - Mod.

DSHS said it has identified 11 mumps cases associated with this outbreak.\n\nA 2nd outbreak is being investigated in Johnson County, south of Fort Worth. Health officials have identified 72 cases in this outbreak, including 71 Johnson County residents and 1 Tarrant County resident. DSHS is working with school districts in the area to limit its spread since most of the cases are in students.\n\nMumps is spread by droplets of saliva or mucus from the mouth, nose, or throat of an infected person, usually when the infected person coughs, sneezes or talks. The virus can also be spread by sharing cups and utensils.\n\nSymptoms include swollen or tender salivary glands, low fever, tiredness and muscle aches. Men can also exhibit swollen or tender testicles.\n\nDSHS said people who are vaccinated can also contract the virus. The spread of mumps can be prevented or limited by covering coughs and sneezes, washing hands frequently with soap and water, and not sharing food or drinks.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[A map showing the location of Texas in the United States can be found at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/245.

At the moment, health agencies state that at least one case of an individual displaying mumps symptoms has been confirmed, says the Kansas City Health Department. As a consequence, an advisory has been issued on Thursday afternoon [22 Dec 2016].\n\nRex Archer, head of the Kansas City Health Department urges people who contracted the disease to stay inside, in order to contain the outbreak, via an official statement. In his plea, Mr Archer asks people to take several days off from either school or work-related duties for at least 5 days after the 1st symptoms emerge, such as the inflammation of the salivary glands. Rex Archer also says that individuals who came in contact with infected people could start displaying mumps symptoms anywhere in between 12 to 25 days after exposure to the virus. Ultimately, he recommends people who develop mumps symptoms to address their health care provider as soon as soon as possible. \"Questions about your immunity or vaccination status should be directed to your private physician\", says Rex Archer.\n\nAs of now, roughly 200 cases of infected individuals have been confirmed by the University of Missouri in Columbia. In order to contain the outbreak, Kansas City Health Department officials say that they are closely monitoring the progression of the local case. Not only this, but health officials also give out several tips that could prevent other individuals from contracting the disease.\n\nDoctors strongly recommend citizens to thoroughly wash their hands as often as possible, covering their mouths with anything other than their hands when sneezing, like tissues or elbow, and avoiding sharing spoons, forks, knives, or other eating utensils with infected subjects. Ultimately, the Health Department representatives also believe that one of the best ways for the population to stay mumps-free is by disinfecting surfaces that are frequently touched, such as doorknobs, counters, tables, and handles.\n\n[Byline: John Birks]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[A map showing the location of Missouri in the United States can be found at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/4145. -

The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette newspaper reported that the outbreak began in August 2016 (http://bit.ly/2hVVQYf).\n\nNate Smith, director of the State Health Department, said he doesn't know why so many people from the Marshall Islands are infected. Officials are investigating whether the vaccine is less effective for certain people. Smith said that the people of the Marshall Islands tend to live close to each other.\n\n\"It's a bit like a college dormitory in terms of intensity of exposure,\" he explained. Smith added that citizens of the Marshall Islands are involved in many community oriented events, where it is easy for transmission of infections.\n\nThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said that the epidemic in Arkansas is the largest since 2009 and 2010 when approximately 3000 people were infected in New York. Smith said that cases of mumps in Arkansas represent more than half of those reported this year [2016] at the national level.\n\nThe Department of Health had vaccinated almost 6600 people up to [Fri 23 Dec 2016]. Smith said that the efforts are showing results because only 12 cases were reported during the last 3 days of last week [week of 12 Dec 2016], \"which is really much less than we had for months.\"\n\nThe Marshall Islands are located in the Pacific Ocean, more than 3200 kilometers (2000 miles) southwest of Hawaii. About 12 000 of its citizens live in Northwest Arkansas.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-ESP\n<promed-esp@promedmail.org>\n\n[Mumps is a viral illness transmitted by the respiratory route, making dissemination possible in gatherings of people.

DSHS said it has identified 11 mumps cases associated with this outbreak.\n\nA 2nd outbreak is being investigated in Johnson County, south of Fort Worth. Health officials have identified 72 cases in this outbreak, including 71 Johnson County residents and 1 Tarrant County resident. DSHS is working with school districts in the area to limit its spread since most of the cases are in students.\n\nMumps is spread by droplets of saliva or mucus from the mouth, nose, or throat of an infected person, usually when the infected person coughs, sneezes or talks. The virus can also be spread by sharing cups and utensils.\n\nSymptoms include swollen or tender salivary glands, low fever, tiredness and muscle aches. Men can also exhibit swollen or tender testicles.\n\nDSHS said people who are vaccinated can also contract the virus. The spread of mumps can be prevented or limited by covering coughs and sneezes, washing hands frequently with soap and water, and not sharing food or drinks.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[A map showing the location of Texas in the United States can be found at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/245.

At the moment, health agencies state that at least one case of an individual displaying mumps symptoms has been confirmed, says the Kansas City Health Department. As a consequence, an advisory has been issued on Thursday afternoon [22 Dec 2016].\n\nRex Archer, head of the Kansas City Health Department urges people who contracted the disease to stay inside, in order to contain the outbreak, via an official statement. In his plea, Mr Archer asks people to take several days off from either school or work-related duties for at least 5 days after the 1st symptoms emerge, such as the inflammation of the salivary glands. Rex Archer also says that individuals who came in contact with infected people could start displaying mumps symptoms anywhere in between 12 to 25 days after exposure to the virus. Ultimately, he recommends people who develop mumps symptoms to address their health care provider as soon as soon as possible. \"Questions about your immunity or vaccination status should be directed to your private physician\", says Rex Archer.\n\nAs of now, roughly 200 cases of infected individuals have been confirmed by the University of Missouri in Columbia. In order to contain the outbreak, Kansas City Health Department officials say that they are closely monitoring the progression of the local case. Not only this, but health officials also give out several tips that could prevent other individuals from contracting the disease.\n\nDoctors strongly recommend citizens to thoroughly wash their hands as often as possible, covering their mouths with anything other than their hands when sneezing, like tissues or elbow, and avoiding sharing spoons, forks, knives, or other eating utensils with infected subjects. Ultimately, the Health Department representatives also believe that one of the best ways for the population to stay mumps-free is by disinfecting surfaces that are frequently touched, such as doorknobs, counters, tables, and handles.\n\n[Byline: John Birks]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[A map showing the location of Missouri in the United States can be found at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/4145. -

At the moment, health agencies state that at least one case of an individual displaying mumps symptoms has been confirmed, says the Kansas City Health Department. As a consequence, an advisory has been issued on Thursday afternoon [22 Dec 2016].\n\nRex Archer, head of the Kansas City Health Department urges people who contracted the disease to stay inside, in order to contain the outbreak, via an official statement. In his plea, Mr Archer asks people to take several days off from either school or work-related duties for at least 5 days after the 1st symptoms emerge, such as the inflammation of the salivary glands. Rex Archer also says that individuals who came in contact with infected people could start displaying mumps symptoms anywhere in between 12 to 25 days after exposure to the virus. Ultimately, he recommends people who develop mumps symptoms to address their health care provider as soon as soon as possible. \"Questions about your immunity or vaccination status should be directed to your private physician\", says Rex Archer.\n\nAs of now, roughly 200 cases of infected individuals have been confirmed by the University of Missouri in Columbia. In order to contain the outbreak, Kansas City Health Department officials say that they are closely monitoring the progression of the local case. Not only this, but health officials also give out several tips that could prevent other individuals from contracting the disease.\n\nDoctors strongly recommend citizens to thoroughly wash their hands as often as possible, covering their mouths with anything other than their hands when sneezing, like tissues or elbow, and avoiding sharing spoons, forks, knives, or other eating utensils with infected subjects. Ultimately, the Health Department representatives also believe that one of the best ways for the population to stay mumps-free is by disinfecting surfaces that are frequently touched, such as doorknobs, counters, tables, and handles.\n\n[Byline: John Birks]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[A map showing the location of Missouri in the United States can be found at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/4145. -

The high school student has been in close contact with a student at the New Paltz Middle School, and though the younger student does not have the mumps at this time, staff and parents at both secondary schools are being warned their children may have been exposed.\n\nSUNY New Paltz said it has been in touch with the school district and has offered to provide assistance as needed. Upcoming Thanksgiving [24 Nov 2016] travel and gatherings compound the possibility for the mumps outbreak to spread.\n\nAfter a person is exposed, symptoms usually appear 16-18 days after infection, but this period can range from 12-25 days after infection. Mumps can't be treated. Aside from headache, other symptoms include low-grade fever, fatigue, muscle aches, and loss of appetite.\n\nThe disease is transmitted by close contact, sharing utensils and drinking glasses, and through saliva contact by kissing or other means. Health officials recommend washing hands frequently as a preventative measure.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[See ProMED-mail report on mumps at SUNY New Paltz in: Mumps - USA (26): universities, schools 20161119.4639792.\n\nThe state of New York can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/20514.

Between April 2015 and May 2016, researchers identified 317 cases on campus. The university, IDPH and the university's McKinley Health Center recommended a 3rd MMR vaccination due to the seasonal trends and characteristics of the population at risk.\n\nAbout 50 000 students and staff members were targeted for 3rd-dose vaccination on C-UPHD campus. A total of 8200 doses of MMR were administered at multiple vaccination sites at the university between 6 and 27 Aug 2015 to determine if a 3rd dose of MMR would prevent further exposure of mumps to healthy staff and students. In addition, the C-UPHD center administered 3300 doses in the fall and spring semesters.\n\nEpidemiological analysis showed that all 317 cases of mumps were associated with the university. Cases in students totaled 278 (88 per cent), 3 (1 per cent) occurred in staff members and 36 (11 per cent) in people not associated with the university but who had contact with students or the campus grounds. Among those who were diagnosed at the time of parotitis onset, 50 patients had received 3 doses of MMR vaccine, 232 patients had received 2 doses, 12 patients had received 1 dose, 7 patients were unvaccinated and 16 patients were unaware if they had been vaccinated. 90 per cent of patients with a 3rd dose received it during the outbreak, and 10 per cent had received it previously independent of this outbreak, according to the researchers.\n\n\"In light of the recent increased incidence of mumps, CDC is gathering additional data to assess use of a 3rd dose of vaccine to inform decision-making during outbreak responses and potential changes in the recommendations,\" they wrote.\n\nReference:\nAlbertson JP, et al. MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep. 2016;doi:10.15585/mmwr.mm62529a2.\n\n[byline: Kate Sherrer]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[While a 3rd dose of the vaccine sounds like it might be helpful in boosting immunity, it must be given sufficiently prior to exposure for the immunity to be boosted to be protective. As noted above, 50 patients (out of 317) had received 3 doses of MMR vaccine. One must assume they were not vaccinated with the 3rd dose in time to protect them.\n\nA 3rd vaccination appears to have been very effective in the following study: Ogbuanu IU, et al. Pediatrics 2012; 130(6)(http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/pediatrics/early/2012/10/30/peds.2012-0177.full.pdf). This study was conducted to assess the impact of a 3rd dose of MMR vaccine during an outbreak in 2009-2010 among school students in 6th-12th grade. The decline in incidence shortly after the intervention suggests that a 3rd dose of MMR vaccine may help control mumps outbreaks among populations with preexisting high 2-dose vaccine coverage. The results indicated that of 2265 eligible students, 2178 (96.2 per cent) provided documentation of having received 2 previous doses of MMR vaccine, and a high proportion (1755 or 80.6 per cent) chose to receive an additional vaccine dose. The overall attack rate for all 6th- to 12th-grade students declined from 4.93 per cent in the prevaccination period to 0.13 per cent after vaccination (P, .001). Villagewide, overall attack rate declined by 75.6 per cent after the intervention. - Mod.LK]\n\n******\n[3] USA (Oklahoma)\nDate: Thu 15 Sep 2016\nSource: Enid News & Eagle [edited]\nhttp://www.enidnews.com/news/local_news/update-some-in-suspected-mumps-outbreak-were-vaccinated/article_47c989a4-7b67-11e6-8e84-dffe3f42c206.html\n\n\nUpdate: Some in suspected mumps outbreak were vaccinated\n--------------------------------------------------------\nGarfield County Health Department has confirmed at least some of the individuals who have or are suspected of having mumps in Garfield County [Oklahoma] have been vaccinated against the disease.\n\n\"I don't have numbers on this just yet -- but it does look as though some were fully vaccinated with MMR,\" Carla Dionne, director of Garfield County Health Department, reported in an email to the Enid News & Eagle. She added that this particular vaccine -- measles, mumps and rubella -- \"is 88 per cent effective -- but not perfect. Individuals with 2 doses can still get mumps.\"\n\nEnid Public Schools [EPS] sent out a text message Wednesday [14 Sep 2016] evening reporting that Garfield County Health Department has confirmed multiple cases of mumps in the community, including at Longfellow Middle School and Enid High School.\n\nOklahoma Health Department later reported there have been 4 confirmed cases in Garfield County and at least 34 suspected cases.\n\nEPS requires students to be in compliance with Oklahoma vaccination laws, EPS Communications Director Amber Graham Fitzgerald said. \"Prior to (Wednesday's) events, the EPS Health Services Department established (Thursday) as the deadline for compliance,\" she said. \"Those not in compliance -- there are about 12 students who don't have the MMR vaccine -- will not be allowed to return to school until they are in compliance.\" This does not include students who have a religious or physical exemption from vaccinations, she said.\n\nLaurence Burnsed, an epidemiologist with the Acute Disease Service for the Oklahoma State Department of Health, confirmed that some of those who are suspected of contracting the disease in Enid have been vaccinated and that others have not been or do not know if they have been vaccinated. \"That's what you might expect in an outbreak situation,\" Burnsed said. \"If you have the recommended 2 doses of MMR, you're at an 88 per cent level of protection, so if 100 people were exposed, you would still have about 12 experiencing symptoms.

Between April 2015 and May 2016, researchers identified 317 cases on campus. The university, IDPH and the university's McKinley Health Center recommended a 3rd MMR vaccination due to the seasonal trends and characteristics of the population at risk.\n\nAbout 50 000 students and staff members were targeted for 3rd-dose vaccination on C-UPHD campus. A total of 8200 doses of MMR were administered at multiple vaccination sites at the university between 6 and 27 Aug 2015 to determine if a 3rd dose of MMR would prevent further exposure of mumps to healthy staff and students. In addition, the C-UPHD center administered 3300 doses in the fall and spring semesters.\n\nEpidemiological analysis showed that all 317 cases of mumps were associated with the university. Cases in students totaled 278 (88 per cent), 3 (1 per cent) occurred in staff members and 36 (11 per cent) in people not associated with the university but who had contact with students or the campus grounds. Among those who were diagnosed at the time of parotitis onset, 50 patients had received 3 doses of MMR vaccine, 232 patients had received 2 doses, 12 patients had received 1 dose, 7 patients were unvaccinated and 16 patients were unaware if they had been vaccinated. 90 per cent of patients with a 3rd dose received it during the outbreak, and 10 per cent had received it previously independent of this outbreak, according to the researchers.\n\n\"In light of the recent increased incidence of mumps, CDC is gathering additional data to assess use of a 3rd dose of vaccine to inform decision-making during outbreak responses and potential changes in the recommendations,\" they wrote.\n\nReference:\nAlbertson JP, et al. MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep. 2016;doi:10.15585/mmwr.mm62529a2.\n\n[byline: Kate Sherrer]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[While a 3rd dose of the vaccine sounds like it might be helpful in boosting immunity, it must be given sufficiently prior to exposure for the immunity to be boosted to be protective. As noted above, 50 patients (out of 317) had received 3 doses of MMR vaccine. One must assume they were not vaccinated with the 3rd dose in time to protect them.\n\nA 3rd vaccination appears to have been very effective in the following study: Ogbuanu IU, et al. Pediatrics 2012; 130(6)(http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/pediatrics/early/2012/10/30/peds.2012-0177.full.pdf). This study was conducted to assess the impact of a 3rd dose of MMR vaccine during an outbreak in 2009-2010 among school students in 6th-12th grade. The decline in incidence shortly after the intervention suggests that a 3rd dose of MMR vaccine may help control mumps outbreaks among populations with preexisting high 2-dose vaccine coverage. The results indicated that of 2265 eligible students, 2178 (96.2 per cent) provided documentation of having received 2 previous doses of MMR vaccine, and a high proportion (1755 or 80.6 per cent) chose to receive an additional vaccine dose. The overall attack rate for all 6th- to 12th-grade students declined from 4.93 per cent in the prevaccination period to 0.13 per cent after vaccination (P, .001). Villagewide, overall attack rate declined by 75.6 per cent after the intervention. - Mod.LK]\n\n******\n[3] USA (Oklahoma)\nDate: Thu 15 Sep 2016\nSource: Enid News & Eagle [edited]\nhttp://www.enidnews.com/news/local_news/update-some-in-suspected-mumps-outbreak-were-vaccinated/article_47c989a4-7b67-11e6-8e84-dffe3f42c206.html\n\n\nUpdate: Some in suspected mumps outbreak were vaccinated\n--------------------------------------------------------\nGarfield County Health Department has confirmed at least some of the individuals who have or are suspected of having mumps in Garfield County [Oklahoma] have been vaccinated against the disease.\n\n\"I don't have numbers on this just yet -- but it does look as though some were fully vaccinated with MMR,\" Carla Dionne, director of Garfield County Health Department, reported in an email to the Enid News & Eagle.

Between April 2015 and May 2016, researchers identified 317 cases on campus. The university, IDPH and the university's McKinley Health Center recommended a 3rd MMR vaccination due to the seasonal trends and characteristics of the population at risk.\n\nAbout 50 000 students and staff members were targeted for 3rd-dose vaccination on C-UPHD campus. A total of 8200 doses of MMR were administered at multiple vaccination sites at the university between 6 and 27 Aug 2015 to determine if a 3rd dose of MMR would prevent further exposure of mumps to healthy staff and students. In addition, the C-UPHD center administered 3300 doses in the fall and spring semesters.\n\nEpidemiological analysis showed that all 317 cases of mumps were associated with the university. Cases in students totaled 278 (88 per cent), 3 (1 per cent) occurred in staff members and 36 (11 per cent) in people not associated with the university but who had contact with students or the campus grounds. Among those who were diagnosed at the time of parotitis onset, 50 patients had received 3 doses of MMR vaccine, 232 patients had received 2 doses, 12 patients had received 1 dose, 7 patients were unvaccinated and 16 patients were unaware if they had been vaccinated. 90 per cent of patients with a 3rd dose received it during the outbreak, and 10 per cent had received it previously independent of this outbreak, according to the researchers.\n\n\"In light of the recent increased incidence of mumps, CDC is gathering additional data to assess use of a 3rd dose of vaccine to inform decision-making during outbreak responses and potential changes in the recommendations,\" they wrote.\n\nReference:\nAlbertson JP, et al. MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep. 2016;doi:10.15585/mmwr.mm62529a2.\n\n[byline: Kate Sherrer]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[While a 3rd dose of the vaccine sounds like it might be helpful in boosting immunity, it must be given sufficiently prior to exposure for the immunity to be boosted to be protective. As noted above, 50 patients (out of 317) had received 3 doses of MMR vaccine. One must assume they were not vaccinated with the 3rd dose in time to protect them.\n\nA 3rd vaccination appears to have been very effective in the following study: Ogbuanu IU, et al. Pediatrics 2012; 130(6)(http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/pediatrics/early/2012/10/30/peds.2012-0177.full.pdf). This study was conducted to assess the impact of a 3rd dose of MMR vaccine during an outbreak in 2009-2010 among school students in 6th-12th grade. The decline in incidence shortly after the intervention suggests that a 3rd dose of MMR vaccine may help control mumps outbreaks among populations with preexisting high 2-dose vaccine coverage. The results indicated that of 2265 eligible students, 2178 (96.2 per cent) provided documentation of having received 2 previous doses of MMR vaccine, and a high proportion (1755 or 80.6 per cent) chose to receive an additional vaccine dose. The overall attack rate for all 6th- to 12th-grade students declined from 4.93 per cent in the prevaccination period to 0.13 per cent after vaccination (P, .001). Villagewide, overall attack rate declined by 75.6 per cent after the intervention. - Mod.LK]\n\n******\n[3] USA (Oklahoma)\nDate: Thu 15 Sep 2016\nSource: Enid News & Eagle [edited]\nhttp://www.enidnews.com/news/local_news/update-some-in-suspected-mumps-outbreak-were-vaccinated/article_47c989a4-7b67-11e6-8e84-dffe3f42c206.html\n\n\nUpdate: Some in suspected mumps outbreak were vaccinated\n--------------------------------------------------------\nGarfield County Health Department has confirmed at least some of the individuals who have or are suspected of having mumps in Garfield County [Oklahoma] have been vaccinated against the disease.\n\n\"I don't have numbers on this just yet -- but it does look as though some were fully vaccinated with MMR,\" Carla Dionne, director of Garfield County Health Department, reported in an email to the Enid News & Eagle. She added that this particular vaccine -- measles, mumps and rubella -- \"is 88 per cent effective -- but not perfect. Individuals with 2 doses can still get mumps.\"\n\nEnid Public Schools [EPS] sent out a text message Wednesday [14 Sep 2016] evening reporting that Garfield County Health Department has confirmed multiple cases of mumps in the community, including at Longfellow Middle School and Enid High School.\n\nOklahoma Health Department later reported there have been 4 confirmed cases in Garfield County and at least 34 suspected cases.\n\nEPS requires students to be in compliance with Oklahoma vaccination laws, EPS Communications Director Amber Graham Fitzgerald said. \"Prior to (Wednesday's) events, the EPS Health Services Department established (Thursday) as the deadline for compliance,\" she said. \"Those not in compliance -- there are about 12 students who don't have the MMR vaccine -- will not be allowed to return to school until they are in compliance.\" This does not include students who have a religious or physical exemption from vaccinations, she said.\n\nLaurence Burnsed, an epidemiologist with the Acute Disease Service for the Oklahoma State Department of Health, confirmed that some of those who are suspected of contracting the disease in Enid have been vaccinated and that others have not been or do not know if they have been vaccinated. \"That's what you might expect in an outbreak situation,\" Burnsed said. \"If you have the recommended 2 doses of MMR, you're at an 88 per cent level of protection, so if 100 people were exposed, you would still have about 12 experiencing symptoms. The vaccine is not 100 per cent protective.\" In the health department's collaboration with school officials, Burnsed said there seems to be a good level of vaccinations.\n\nThe MMR vaccine is available at Garfield County Health Department.\n\nMumps is a virus spread though coughing, sneezing and direct contact with saliva through eating or drinking after an infected person, according to Garfield County Health Department. Symptoms can last 7-10 days and usually appear 12-25 days after infection.\n\nMumps is characterized by puffy cheeks and a swollen jaw, due to swollen salivary glands. Other symptoms include body aches, tiredness and fever, and males may experience swollen, painful testicles, according to the department. In order to prevent spreading mumps, children who exhibit such symptoms should not attend school or day care through 5 days after the illness begins, according to the department.\n\nBurnsed encouraged those who have not been vaccinated or who are behind on their vaccination schedule to get the MMR vaccine to help protect against the illness. Burnsed also said the state department is not ruling out that Enid's suspected outbreak could be related to a similar outbreak in Arkansas. \"It's certainly possible, considering the proximity,\" Burnsed said. \"But we are still gathering information.\"\n\nOn Monday [12 Sep 2016], the Arkansas Department of Health reported almost 100 cases of mumps have been confirmed in the state, with most being in Springdale, but some reported in Rogers and potential cases in Fayetteville, Huntsville and West Fork, according to the Arkansas Democrat Gazette.\n\n[byline: Sally Asher]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The cases in Oklahoma had been fully vaccinated with 2 doses, but still came down with measles.

The State Health Department is warning colleges throughout the state the Long Beach outbreak could lead to other cases. The State Health Department said public health officials on Long Island have identified 45 mumps cases related to the Long Beach outbreak since July [2016].\n\nA SUNY Plattsburgh student also was recently diagnosed with mumps, but the source of that infection is still under investigation.\n\nBoth schools have notified unvaccinated students they will be barred from campus for 26 days after the last possible exposure if they do not get vaccinated. The health department said this step is being taken to avoid a large outbreak.\n\nMumps is characterized by fever, headache, swelling of the salivary glands, fatigue, muscle aches and loss of appetite. After a person is exposed to mumps, symptoms usually appear 16 to 18 days after infection. Mumps cannot be treated.\n\nTwo doses of the mumps vaccine provides the best protection against the disease, according to the health department.\n\nThe department offered these tips to prevent the spread of mumps:\n- do not share food, drinks, utensils or other personal items that may contain saliva;\n- wash hands frequently with soap and water or use an alcohol-based hand rub;\n- cover your mouth with a tissue when sneezing or coughing and discard the tissue;\n- clean and disinfect objects and surfaces that may be contaminated with germs.\n\nPeople with mumps should stay home away from public places for 5 days after the onset of symptoms and limit contact with others in their households.\n\nMumps is no longer common in the United States.

A total of 8200 doses of MMR were administered at multiple vaccination sites at the university between 6 and 27 Aug 2015 to determine if a 3rd dose of MMR would prevent further exposure of mumps to healthy staff and students. In addition, the C-UPHD center administered 3300 doses in the fall and spring semesters.\n\nEpidemiological analysis showed that all 317 cases of mumps were associated with the university. Cases in students totaled 278 (88 per cent), 3 (1 per cent) occurred in staff members and 36 (11 per cent) in people not associated with the university but who had contact with students or the campus grounds. Among those who were diagnosed at the time of parotitis onset, 50 patients had received 3 doses of MMR vaccine, 232 patients had received 2 doses, 12 patients had received 1 dose, 7 patients were unvaccinated and 16 patients were unaware if they had been vaccinated. 90 per cent of patients with a 3rd dose received it during the outbreak, and 10 per cent had received it previously independent of this outbreak, according to the researchers.\n\n\"In light of the recent increased incidence of mumps, CDC is gathering additional data to assess use of a 3rd dose of vaccine to inform decision-making during outbreak responses and potential changes in the recommendations,\" they wrote.\n\nReference:\nAlbertson JP, et al.

This study was conducted to assess the impact of a 3rd dose of MMR vaccine during an outbreak in 2009-2010 among school students in 6th-12th grade. The decline in incidence shortly after the intervention suggests that a 3rd dose of MMR vaccine may help control mumps outbreaks among populations with preexisting high 2-dose vaccine coverage. The results indicated that of 2265 eligible students, 2178 (96.2 per cent) provided documentation of having received 2 previous doses of MMR vaccine, and a high proportion (1755 or 80.6 per cent) chose to receive an additional vaccine dose. The overall attack rate for all 6th- to 12th-grade students declined from 4.93 per cent in the prevaccination period to 0.13 per cent after vaccination (P, .001).

Between April 2015 and May 2016, researchers identified 317 cases on campus. The university, IDPH and the university's McKinley Health Center recommended a 3rd MMR vaccination due to the seasonal trends and characteristics of the population at risk.\n\nAbout 50 000 students and staff members were targeted for 3rd-dose vaccination on C-UPHD campus. A total of 8200 doses of MMR were administered at multiple vaccination sites at the university between 6 and 27 Aug 2015 to determine if a 3rd dose of MMR would prevent further exposure of mumps to healthy staff and students. In addition, the C-UPHD center administered 3300 doses in the fall and spring semesters.\n\nEpidemiological analysis showed that all 317 cases of mumps were associated with the university. Cases in students totaled 278 (88 per cent), 3 (1 per cent) occurred in staff members and 36 (11 per cent) in people not associated with the university but who had contact with students or the campus grounds. Among those who were diagnosed at the time of parotitis onset, 50 patients had received 3 doses of MMR vaccine, 232 patients had received 2 doses, 12 patients had received 1 dose, 7 patients were unvaccinated and 16 patients were unaware if they had been vaccinated. 90 per cent of patients with a 3rd dose received it during the outbreak, and 10 per cent had received it previously independent of this outbreak, according to the researchers.\n\n\"In light of the recent increased incidence of mumps, CDC is gathering additional data to assess use of a 3rd dose of vaccine to inform decision-making during outbreak responses and potential changes in the recommendations,\" they wrote.\n\nReference:\nAlbertson JP, et al. MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep. 2016;doi:10.15585/mmwr.mm62529a2.\n\n[byline: Kate Sherrer]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[While a 3rd dose of the vaccine sounds like it might be helpful in boosting immunity, it must be given sufficiently prior to exposure for the immunity to be boosted to be protective. As noted above, 50 patients (out of 317) had received 3 doses of MMR vaccine. One must assume they were not vaccinated with the 3rd dose in time to protect them.\n\nA 3rd vaccination appears to have been very effective in the following study: Ogbuanu IU, et al. Pediatrics 2012; 130(6)(http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/pediatrics/early/2012/10/30/peds.2012-0177.full.pdf). This study was conducted to assess the impact of a 3rd dose of MMR vaccine during an outbreak in 2009-2010 among school students in 6th-12th grade. The decline in incidence shortly after the intervention suggests that a 3rd dose of MMR vaccine may help control mumps outbreaks among populations with preexisting high 2-dose vaccine coverage. The results indicated that of 2265 eligible students, 2178 (96.2 per cent) provided documentation of having received 2 previous doses of MMR vaccine, and a high proportion (1755 or 80.6 per cent) chose to receive an additional vaccine dose. The overall attack rate for all 6th- to 12th-grade students declined from 4.93 per cent in the prevaccination period to 0.13 per cent after vaccination (P, .001). Villagewide, overall attack rate declined by 75.6 per cent after the intervention. - Mod.LK]\n\n******\n[3] USA (Oklahoma)\nDate: Thu 15 Sep 2016\nSource: Enid News & Eagle [edited]\nhttp://www.enidnews.com/news/local_news/update-some-in-suspected-mumps-outbreak-were-vaccinated/article_47c989a4-7b67-11e6-8e84-dffe3f42c206.html\n\n\nUpdate: Some in suspected mumps outbreak were vaccinated\n--------------------------------------------------------\nGarfield County Health Department has confirmed at least some of the individuals who have or are suspected of having mumps in Garfield County [Oklahoma] have been vaccinated against the disease.\n\n\"I don't have numbers on this just yet -- but it does look as though some were fully vaccinated with MMR,\" Carla Dionne, director of Garfield County Health Department, reported in an email to the Enid News & Eagle. She added that this particular vaccine -- measles, mumps and rubella -- \"is 88 per cent effective -- but not perfect. Individuals with 2 doses can still get mumps.\"\n\nEnid Public Schools [EPS] sent out a text message Wednesday [14 Sep 2016] evening reporting that Garfield County Health Department has confirmed multiple cases of mumps in the community, including at Longfellow Middle School and Enid High School.\n\nOklahoma Health Department later reported there have been 4 confirmed cases in Garfield County and at least 34 suspected cases.\n\nEPS requires students to be in compliance with Oklahoma vaccination laws, EPS Communications Director Amber Graham Fitzgerald said. \"Prior to (Wednesday's) events, the EPS Health Services Department established (Thursday) as the deadline for compliance,\" she said. \"Those not in compliance -- there are about 12 students who don't have the MMR vaccine -- will not be allowed to return to school until they are in compliance.\" This does not include students who have a religious or physical exemption from vaccinations, she said.\n\nLaurence Burnsed, an epidemiologist with the Acute Disease Service for the Oklahoma State Department of Health, confirmed that some of those who are suspected of contracting the disease in Enid have been vaccinated and that others have not been or do not know if they have been vaccinated. \"That's what you might expect in an outbreak situation,\" Burnsed said. \"If you have the recommended 2 doses of MMR, you're at an 88 per cent level of protection, so if 100 people were exposed, you would still have about 12 experiencing symptoms. The vaccine is not 100 per cent protective.\" In the health department's collaboration with school officials, Burnsed said there seems to be a good level of vaccinations.\n\nThe MMR vaccine is available at Garfield County Health Department.\n\nMumps is a virus spread though coughing, sneezing and direct contact with saliva through eating or drinking after an infected person, according to Garfield County Health Department. Symptoms can last 7-10 days and usually appear 12-25 days after infection.\n\nMumps is characterized by puffy cheeks and a swollen jaw, due to swollen salivary glands. Other symptoms include body aches, tiredness and fever, and males may experience swollen, painful testicles, according to the department. In order to prevent spreading mumps, children who exhibit such symptoms should not attend school or day care through 5 days after the illness begins, according to the department.\n\nBurnsed encouraged those who have not been vaccinated or who are behind on their vaccination schedule to get the MMR vaccine to help protect against the illness. Burnsed also said the state department is not ruling out that Enid's suspected outbreak could be related to a similar outbreak in Arkansas. \"It's certainly possible, considering the proximity,\" Burnsed said. \"But we are still gathering information.\"\n\nOn Monday [12 Sep 2016], the Arkansas Department of Health reported almost 100 cases of mumps have been confirmed in the state, with most being in Springdale, but some reported in Rogers and potential cases in Fayetteville, Huntsville and West Fork, according to the Arkansas Democrat Gazette.\n\n[byline: Sally Asher]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The cases in Oklahoma had been fully vaccinated with 2 doses, but still came down with measles.

Between April 2015 and May 2016, researchers identified 317 cases on campus. The university, IDPH and the university's McKinley Health Center recommended a 3rd MMR vaccination due to the seasonal trends and characteristics of the population at risk.\n\nAbout 50 000 students and staff members were targeted for 3rd-dose vaccination on C-UPHD campus. A total of 8200 doses of MMR were administered at multiple vaccination sites at the university between 6 and 27 Aug 2015 to determine if a 3rd dose of MMR would prevent further exposure of mumps to healthy staff and students. In addition, the C-UPHD center administered 3300 doses in the fall and spring semesters.\n\nEpidemiological analysis showed that all 317 cases of mumps were associated with the university. Cases in students totaled 278 (88 per cent), 3 (1 per cent) occurred in staff members and 36 (11 per cent) in people not associated with the university but who had contact with students or the campus grounds. Among those who were diagnosed at the time of parotitis onset, 50 patients had received 3 doses of MMR vaccine, 232 patients had received 2 doses, 12 patients had received 1 dose, 7 patients were unvaccinated and 16 patients were unaware if they had been vaccinated. 90 per cent of patients with a 3rd dose received it during the outbreak, and 10 per cent had received it previously independent of this outbreak, according to the researchers.\n\n\"In light of the recent increased incidence of mumps, CDC is gathering additional data to assess use of a 3rd dose of vaccine to inform decision-making during outbreak responses and potential changes in the recommendations,\" they wrote.\n\nReference:\nAlbertson JP, et al. MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep. 2016;doi:10.15585/mmwr.mm62529a2.\n\n[byline: Kate Sherrer]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[While a 3rd dose of the vaccine sounds like it might be helpful in boosting immunity, it must be given sufficiently prior to exposure for the immunity to be boosted to be protective. As noted above, 50 patients (out of 317) had received 3 doses of MMR vaccine. One must assume they were not vaccinated with the 3rd dose in time to protect them.\n\nA 3rd vaccination appears to have been very effective in the following study: Ogbuanu IU, et al. Pediatrics 2012; 130(6)(http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/pediatrics/early/2012/10/30/peds.2012-0177.full.pdf). This study was conducted to assess the impact of a 3rd dose of MMR vaccine during an outbreak in 2009-2010 among school students in 6th-12th grade. The decline in incidence shortly after the intervention suggests that a 3rd dose of MMR vaccine may help control mumps outbreaks among populations with preexisting high 2-dose vaccine coverage. The results indicated that of 2265 eligible students, 2178 (96.2 per cent) provided documentation of having received 2 previous doses of MMR vaccine, and a high proportion (1755 or 80.6 per cent) chose to receive an additional vaccine dose. The overall attack rate for all 6th- to 12th-grade students declined from 4.93 per cent in the prevaccination period to 0.13 per cent after vaccination (P, .001). Villagewide, overall attack rate declined by 75.6 per cent after the intervention. - Mod.LK]\n\n******\n[3] USA (Oklahoma)\nDate: Thu 15 Sep 2016\nSource: Enid News & Eagle [edited]\nhttp://www.enidnews.com/news/local_news/update-some-in-suspected-mumps-outbreak-were-vaccinated/article_47c989a4-7b67-11e6-8e84-dffe3f42c206.html\n\n\nUpdate: Some in suspected mumps outbreak were vaccinated\n--------------------------------------------------------\nGarfield County Health Department has confirmed at least some of the individuals who have or are suspected of having mumps in Garfield County [Oklahoma] have been vaccinated against the disease.\n\n\"I don't have numbers on this just yet -- but it does look as though some were fully vaccinated with MMR,\" Carla Dionne, director of Garfield County Health Department, reported in an email to the Enid News & Eagle. She added that this particular vaccine -- measles, mumps and rubella -- \"is 88 per cent effective -- but not perfect. Individuals with 2 doses can still get mumps.\"\n\nEnid Public Schools [EPS] sent out a text message Wednesday [14 Sep 2016] evening reporting that Garfield County Health Department has confirmed multiple cases of mumps in the community, including at Longfellow Middle School and Enid High School.\n\nOklahoma Health Department later reported there have been 4 confirmed cases in Garfield County and at least 34 suspected cases.\n\nEPS requires students to be in compliance with Oklahoma vaccination laws, EPS Communications Director Amber Graham Fitzgerald said. \"Prior to (Wednesday's) events, the EPS Health Services Department established (Thursday) as the deadline for compliance,\" she said. \"Those not in compliance -- there are about 12 students who don't have the MMR vaccine -- will not be allowed to return to school until they are in compliance.\" This does not include students who have a religious or physical exemption from vaccinations, she said.\n\nLaurence Burnsed, an epidemiologist with the Acute Disease Service for the Oklahoma State Department of Health, confirmed that some of those who are suspected of contracting the disease in Enid have been vaccinated and that others have not been or do not know if they have been vaccinated. \"That's what you might expect in an outbreak situation,\" Burnsed said. \"If you have the recommended 2 doses of MMR, you're at an 88 per cent level of protection, so if 100 people were exposed, you would still have about 12 experiencing symptoms. The vaccine is not 100 per cent protective.\" In the health department's collaboration with school officials, Burnsed said there seems to be a good level of vaccinations.\n\nThe MMR vaccine is available at Garfield County Health Department.\n\nMumps is a virus spread though coughing, sneezing and direct contact with saliva through eating or drinking after an infected person, according to Garfield County Health Department. Symptoms can last 7-10 days and usually appear 12-25 days after infection.\n\nMumps is characterized by puffy cheeks and a swollen jaw, due to swollen salivary glands. Other symptoms include body aches, tiredness and fever, and males may experience swollen, painful testicles, according to the department. In order to prevent spreading mumps, children who exhibit such symptoms should not attend school or day care through 5 days after the illness begins, according to the department.\n\nBurnsed encouraged those who have not been vaccinated or who are behind on their vaccination schedule to get the MMR vaccine to help protect against the illness. Burnsed also said the state department is not ruling out that Enid's suspected outbreak could be related to a similar outbreak in Arkansas. \"It's certainly possible, considering the proximity,\" Burnsed said. \"But we are still gathering information.\"\n\nOn Monday [12 Sep 2016], the Arkansas Department of Health reported almost 100 cases of mumps have been confirmed in the state, with most being in Springdale, but some reported in Rogers and potential cases in Fayetteville, Huntsville and West Fork, according to the Arkansas Democrat Gazette.\n\n[byline: Sally Asher]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The cases in Oklahoma had been fully vaccinated with 2 doses, but still came down with measles.

The State Health Department is warning colleges throughout the state the Long Beach outbreak could lead to other cases. The State Health Department said public health officials on Long Island have identified 45 mumps cases related to the Long Beach outbreak since July [2016].\n\nA SUNY Plattsburgh student also was recently diagnosed with mumps, but the source of that infection is still under investigation.\n\nBoth schools have notified unvaccinated students they will be barred from campus for 26 days after the last possible exposure if they do not get vaccinated. The health department said this step is being taken to avoid a large outbreak.\n\nMumps is characterized by fever, headache, swelling of the salivary glands, fatigue, muscle aches and loss of appetite. After a person is exposed to mumps, symptoms usually appear 16 to 18 days after infection. Mumps cannot be treated.\n\nTwo doses of the mumps vaccine provides the best protection against the disease, according to the health department.\n\nThe department offered these tips to prevent the spread of mumps:\n- do not share food, drinks, utensils or other personal items that may contain saliva;\n- wash hands frequently with soap and water or use an alcohol-based hand rub;\n- cover your mouth with a tissue when sneezing or coughing and discard the tissue;\n- clean and disinfect objects and surfaces that may be contaminated with germs.\n\nPeople with mumps should stay home away from public places for 5 days after the onset of symptoms and limit contact with others in their households.\n\nMumps is no longer common in the United States.

Cases in students totaled 278 (88 per cent), 3 (1 per cent) occurred in staff members and 36 (11 per cent) in people not associated with the university but who had contact with students or the campus grounds. Among those who were diagnosed at the time of parotitis onset, 50 patients had received 3 doses of MMR vaccine, 232 patients had received 2 doses, 12 patients had received 1 dose, 7 patients were unvaccinated and 16 patients were unaware if they had been vaccinated. 90 per cent of patients with a 3rd dose received it during the outbreak, and 10 per cent had received it previously independent of this outbreak, according to the researchers.\n\n\"In light of the recent increased incidence of mumps, CDC is gathering additional data to assess use of a 3rd dose of vaccine to inform decision-making during outbreak responses and potential changes in the recommendations,\" they wrote.\n\nReference:\nAlbertson JP, et al.

As noted above, 50 patients (out of 317) had received 3 doses of MMR vaccine. One must assume they were not vaccinated with the 3rd dose in time to protect them.\n\nA 3rd vaccination appears to have been very effective in the following study: Ogbuanu IU, et al. Pediatrics 2012; 130(6)(http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/pediatrics/early/2012/10/30/peds.2012-0177.full.pdf). This study was conducted to assess the impact of a 3rd dose of MMR vaccine during an outbreak in 2009-2010 among school students in 6th-12th grade. The decline in incidence shortly after the intervention suggests that a 3rd dose of MMR vaccine may help control mumps outbreaks among populations with preexisting high 2-dose vaccine coverage. The results indicated that of 2265 eligible students, 2178 (96.2 per cent) provided documentation of having received 2 previous doses of MMR vaccine, and a high proportion (1755 or 80.6 per cent) chose to receive an additional vaccine dose. The overall attack rate for all 6th- to 12th-grade students declined from 4.93 per cent in the prevaccination period to 0.13 per cent after vaccination (P, .001). Villagewide, overall attack rate declined by 75.6 per cent after the intervention. - Mod.LK]\n\n******\n[3] USA (Oklahoma)\nDate: Thu 15 Sep 2016\nSource: Enid News & Eagle [edited]\nhttp://www.enidnews.com/news/local_news/update-some-in-suspected-mumps-outbreak-were-vaccinated/article_47c989a4-7b67-11e6-8e84-dffe3f42c206.html\n\n\nUpdate: Some in suspected mumps outbreak were vaccinated\n--------------------------------------------------------\nGarfield County Health Department has confirmed at least some of the individuals who have or are suspected of having mumps in Garfield County [Oklahoma] have been vaccinated against the disease.\n\n\"I don't have numbers on this just yet -- but it does look as though some were fully vaccinated with MMR,\" Carla Dionne, director of Garfield County Health Department, reported in an email to the Enid News & Eagle. She added that this particular vaccine -- measles, mumps and rubella -- \"is 88 per cent effective -- but not perfect. Individuals with 2 doses can still get mumps.\"\n\nEnid Public Schools [EPS] sent out a text message Wednesday [14 Sep 2016] evening reporting that Garfield County Health Department has confirmed multiple cases of mumps in the community, including at Longfellow Middle School and Enid High School.\n\nOklahoma Health Department later reported there have been 4 confirmed cases in Garfield County and at least 34 suspected cases.\n\nEPS requires students to be in compliance with Oklahoma vaccination laws, EPS Communications Director Amber Graham Fitzgerald said. \"Prior to (Wednesday's) events, the EPS Health Services Department established (Thursday) as the deadline for compliance,\" she said. \"Those not in compliance -- there are about 12 students who don't have the MMR vaccine -- will not be allowed to return to school until they are in compliance.\" This does not include students who have a religious or physical exemption from vaccinations, she said.\n\nLaurence Burnsed, an epidemiologist with the Acute Disease Service for the Oklahoma State Department of Health, confirmed that some of those who are suspected of contracting the disease in Enid have been vaccinated and that others have not been or do not know if they have been vaccinated. \"That's what you might expect in an outbreak situation,\" Burnsed said. \"If you have the recommended 2 doses of MMR, you're at an 88 per cent level of protection, so if 100 people were exposed, you would still have about 12 experiencing symptoms. The vaccine is not 100 per cent protective.\" In the health department's collaboration with school officials, Burnsed said there seems to be a good level of vaccinations.\n\nThe MMR vaccine is available at Garfield County Health Department.\n\nMumps is a virus spread though coughing, sneezing and direct contact with saliva through eating or drinking after an infected person, according to Garfield County Health Department. Symptoms can last 7-10 days and usually appear 12-25 days after infection.\n\nMumps is characterized by puffy cheeks and a swollen jaw, due to swollen salivary glands. Other symptoms include body aches, tiredness and fever, and males may experience swollen, painful testicles, according to the department. In order to prevent spreading mumps, children who exhibit such symptoms should not attend school or day care through 5 days after the illness begins, according to the department.\n\nBurnsed encouraged those who have not been vaccinated or who are behind on their vaccination schedule to get the MMR vaccine to help protect against the illness. Burnsed also said the state department is not ruling out that Enid's suspected outbreak could be related to a similar outbreak in Arkansas. \"It's certainly possible, considering the proximity,\" Burnsed said. \"But we are still gathering information.\"\n\nOn Monday [12 Sep 2016], the Arkansas Department of Health reported almost 100 cases of mumps have been confirmed in the state, with most being in Springdale, but some reported in Rogers and potential cases in Fayetteville, Huntsville and West Fork, according to the Arkansas Democrat Gazette.\n\n[byline: Sally Asher]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The cases in Oklahoma had been fully vaccinated with 2 doses, but still came down with measles.

The State Health Department is warning colleges throughout the state the Long Beach outbreak could lead to other cases. The State Health Department said public health officials on Long Island have identified 45 mumps cases related to the Long Beach outbreak since July [2016].\n\nA SUNY Plattsburgh student also was recently diagnosed with mumps, but the source of that infection is still under investigation.\n\nBoth schools have notified unvaccinated students they will be barred from campus for 26 days after the last possible exposure if they do not get vaccinated. The health department said this step is being taken to avoid a large outbreak.\n\nMumps is characterized by fever, headache, swelling of the salivary glands, fatigue, muscle aches and loss of appetite. After a person is exposed to mumps, symptoms usually appear 16 to 18 days after infection. Mumps cannot be treated.\n\nTwo doses of the mumps vaccine provides the best protection against the disease, according to the health department.\n\nThe department offered these tips to prevent the spread of mumps:\n- do not share food, drinks, utensils or other personal items that may contain saliva;\n- wash hands frequently with soap and water or use an alcohol-based hand rub;\n- cover your mouth with a tissue when sneezing or coughing and discard the tissue;\n- clean and disinfect objects and surfaces that may be contaminated with germs.\n\nPeople with mumps should stay home away from public places for 5 days after the onset of symptoms and limit contact with others in their households.\n\nMumps is no longer common in the United States.

Reactions to MMR and MMRV vaccine are generally mild and transient and include pain and redness at the injection site, low-grade fever, and rash.\n\n(Excerpted from http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/publicat/cig-gci/p04-mump-orei-eng.php). - Mod.LK]\nSee Also\nMumps - USA (11): (MA) student cases 20160429.4192049\nMumps - USA (10): (IN,MA) student cases 20160415.4162668\nMumps - USA (09): (MN,ND,IN) 20160409.4148390\nMumps - USA (08): (ND) 20160403.4136830\nMumps - USA (07): (MT) student cases 20160318.4104627\nMumps - USA (06): (CA, NY) student cases 20160315.4095024\nMumps - USA (05): (MA) student cases 20160312.4088535\nMumps - USA (04): (MA, MT) student cases 20160311.4084267\nMumps - USA (03): (MA) student cases 20160308.4078373\nMumps - USA (02): (NH) student cases, alert 20160229.4057550\nMumps - USA: (CO,KY) increased incidence 20160225.4050452\n2015\n----\nMumps - Norway: increased incidence 20151109.3776723\nMumps - Argentina: (SF) increased incidence 20151031.3758370\nMumps - USA (08): (IL) college students 20150922.3662990\nMumps - USA (07): (IL) community college students, RFI 20150918.3654737\nMumps - USA (06): (IL) returning university students, further development 20150828.3608518\nMumps - USA (05): (IA) returning university students 20150821.3594465\nMumps - Ireland (02) 20150806.3563027\nMumps - USA (04): (IL, MO) university students 20150730.3546295\nMumps - USA (03): (IL) university students 20150616.3442934\nMumps - Canada (02): (ON) school children 20150624.3462267\nMumps - Canada (QC): school children, correction (ON) 20150529.3396108\nMumps - Canada (QC): school children 20150529.3395573\nMumps Australia (WA) 20150426.33238\nMumps - Ireland: football players 20150223.3185969\nMumps - USA (02): (ID) university students 20150209.3153606\nMumps - UK: (Scotland) 20150204.3142750\nMumps - USA: (PA) professional hockey team players 20150109.3080644\n.................................................sb/lk/mj/mpp", "reports": [{"diseases": ["measles", "mumps", "rubella", "varicella"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2016-05-16 00:00:00", "2011-03-16 00:00:00", "1970-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-11 00:00:00", "2021-03-10 00:00:00", "2021-03-09 00:00:00", "2021-03-08 00:00:00", "2021-03-07 00:00:00", "2021-03-06 00:00:00", "2021-03-05 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-08 00:00:00", "2021-03-07 00:00:00", "2021-03-06 00:00:00", "2021-03-05 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Vancouver", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Whistler", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "QC", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "British Columbia", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Scotland", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Mumps - Ireland", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "SF", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Canada", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "MT", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "4192049", "headline": "PRO/EDR> Mumps - USA (11): (MA) student cases", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=4192049", "date": "2016-03-11 09:06:43", "main_text": "MUMPS - USA (04): (MASSACHUSETTS, MONTANA) STUDENT CASES\n********************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nIn this update:\n[1] Massachusetts: University of Massachusetts students\n[2] Montana: Belgrade schools\n\n******\n[1] Massachusetts: University of Massachusetts students\nDate: Wed 9 Mar 2016\nSource: Outbreak News Today [edited]\nhttp://outbreaknewstoday.com/umass-boston-reports-2nd-mumps-case-99723/\n\n\nFollowing reports of the 1st case of mumps in a UMass [University of Massachusetts] Boston (UMB) last week [week of 1 Mar 2016], school officials announced [Tue 8 Mar 2016] a 2nd confirmed case of the contagious viral disease.\n\nThe 1st on campus case occurred on 20 Feb 2016 during the UMB Men's hockey team match against University of Southern Maine (USM), according to a University Health Services release.\n\nUSM has previously reported a confirmed mumps case last week.\n\nMumps is a contagious disease.

All of the confirmed cases attend Belgrade High School or Belgrade Middle School.\n\nMumps is a viral disease characterized by swelling of the parotid or salivary glands along the face, neck, and jaw. The swelling can last from 2 to 10 days. The incubation period, (time from when you were infected to when you have symptoms) is 12-25 days. Other symptoms, in addition to the swelling around the neck and jaw, include fever, malaise (tiredness), muscle aches, and headache. Up to 25% of people with mumps may have few or no symptoms.\n\nMumps is spread by droplets of saliva or mucus from the mouth, nose, or throat of an infected person. Saliva can pass from one person to another when they share straws, spoons, forks, cups, cans, bottles, and even lip gloss. Mumps is also commonly spread when an infected person coughs or sneezes, and a non-infected person inhales respiratory droplets that contain the virus.\n\nIf you do have mumps, you should avoid prolonged, close contact with other people until at least 5 days after your salivary glands begin to swell because you are contagious during this time.\n\nParents of children who may be most susceptible to mumps will be notified by staff from Gallatin City-County Health Department who will provide information and health care guidance. In most cases, students who are most susceptible to mumps are those who have not been vaccinated against the disease.\n\nThe good news is that guidance from the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Centers for Disease Control has determined that unimmunized students can return to school immediately if they are vaccinated against mumps.\n\nStudents who have religious or medical exemptions for the MMR [measles, mumps, rubella] vaccine may be excluded from school for 25 days or more, depending on the course of the outbreak. But again, if students are vaccinated with the MMR vaccine they can return to school immediately.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The state of Montana can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/35926.

Large outbreaks occurred in 2006 (6584 cases) and in 2009 and 2010 (approximately 3500 cases). Outbreaks occurred primarily among previously vaccinated persons in densely populated settings (colleges and religious communities). A provisional total of 438 mumps cases were reported in 2013.\n\nMMR vaccine is recommended routinely for all children age 12 through 15 months, with a 2nd dose at age 4 through 6 years. The 2nd dose is not a booster, but rather is intended to produce immunity in the small number of people who fail to respond to the 1st dose. 2-5% of people do not develop measles immunity after the 1st dose of vaccine. This occurs for a variety of reasons.\n\nTo protect against mumps, adults with no evidence of immunity should get 1 dose of MMR unless the adult is in a high-risk group. High-risk people need 2 doses and include healthcare personnel, international travelers, and students at post-high school educational institutions, among others (excerpted/edited from http://www.immunize.org/askexperts/experts_mmr.asp).\n\nMumps is no longer common in the United States, but periodic mumps outbreaks occur, particularly in winter and spring, and cases may still occur despite prior vaccination. Crowded environments, such as college classes, organized sports, or dormitories, are a major contributing factor to the spread of mumps if the virus is introduced.\n\n80 to 90% of vaccinees will be fully protected, but those who do become infected following vaccination tend to have milder disease when exposed to the virus. If a community maintains a high vaccination rate, the risk of exposure declines too. - Mod.LK]\nSee Also\nMumps - USA (03): (MA) student cases 20160308.4078373\nMumps - USA (02): (NH) student cases, alert 20160229.4057550\nMumps - USA: (CO,KY) increased incidence 20160225.4050452\n2015\n----\nMumps - Norway: increased incidence 20151109.3776723\nMumps - Argentina: (SF) increased incidence 20151031.3758370\nMumps - USA (08): (IL) college students 20150922.3662990\nMumps - USA (07): (IL) community college students, RFI 20150918.3654737\nMumps - USA (06): (IL) returning university students, further development 20150828.3608518\nMumps - USA (05): (IA) returning university students 20150821.3594465\nMumps - Ireland (02) 20150806.3563027\nMumps - USA (04): (IL, MO) university students 20150730.3546295\nMumps - USA (03): (IL) university students 20150616.3442934\nMumps - Canada (02): (ON) school children 20150624.3462267\nMumps - Canada (QC): school children, correction (ON) 20150529.3396108\nMumps - Canada (QC): school children 20150529.3395573\nMumps - Australia (WA) 20150426.3323826\nMumps - Ireland: football players 20150223.3185969\nMumps - USA (02): (ID) university students 20150209.3153606\nMumps - UK: (Scotland) 20150204.3142750\nMumps - USA: (PA) professional hockey team players 20150109.3080644\n.................................................sb/lk/mj/ml", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "measles", "mumps", "rubella"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2016-03-16 00:00:00", "2016-03-16 00:00:00", "2016-03-16 00:00:00", "2016-02-20 00:00:00", "2016-03-16 00:00:00", "2012-03-16 00:00:00", "1135-03-16 00:00:00", "2006-03-16 00:00:00", "2009-03-16 00:00:00", "2010-03-16 00:00:00", "2013-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-08 00:00:00", "2021-03-07 00:00:00", "2021-03-06 00:00:00", "2021-03-05 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "QC", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Gallatin City - County Health Department", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Belgrade", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Gallatin County", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Montana", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Scotland", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Mumps - Ireland", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "SF", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "the United States", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Massachusetts", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "4162668", "headline": "PRO/EDR> Mumps - USA (10): (IN,MA) student cases", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=4162668", "date": "2016-03-11 09:06:43", "main_text": "MUMPS - USA (04): (MASSACHUSETTS, MONTANA) STUDENT CASES\n********************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nIn this update:\n[1] Massachusetts: University of Massachusetts students\n[2] Montana: Belgrade schools\n\n******\n[1] Massachusetts: University of Massachusetts students\nDate: Wed 9 Mar 2016\nSource: Outbreak News Today [edited]\nhttp://outbreaknewstoday.com/umass-boston-reports-2nd-mumps-case-99723/\n\n\nFollowing reports of the 1st case of mumps in a UMass [University of Massachusetts] Boston (UMB) last week [week of 1 Mar 2016], school officials announced [Tue 8 Mar 2016] a 2nd confirmed case of the contagious viral disease.\n\nThe 1st on campus case occurred on 20 Feb 2016 during the UMB Men's hockey team match against University of Southern Maine (USM), according to a University Health Services release.\n\nUSM has previously reported a confirmed mumps case last week.\n\nMumps is a contagious disease.

All of the confirmed cases attend Belgrade High School or Belgrade Middle School.\n\nMumps is a viral disease characterized by swelling of the parotid or salivary glands along the face, neck, and jaw. The swelling can last from 2 to 10 days. The incubation period, (time from when you were infected to when you have symptoms) is 12-25 days. Other symptoms, in addition to the swelling around the neck and jaw, include fever, malaise (tiredness), muscle aches, and headache. Up to 25% of people with mumps may have few or no symptoms.\n\nMumps is spread by droplets of saliva or mucus from the mouth, nose, or throat of an infected person. Saliva can pass from one person to another when they share straws, spoons, forks, cups, cans, bottles, and even lip gloss. Mumps is also commonly spread when an infected person coughs or sneezes, and a non-infected person inhales respiratory droplets that contain the virus.\n\nIf you do have mumps, you should avoid prolonged, close contact with other people until at least 5 days after your salivary glands begin to swell because you are contagious during this time.\n\nParents of children who may be most susceptible to mumps will be notified by staff from Gallatin City-County Health Department who will provide information and health care guidance. In most cases, students who are most susceptible to mumps are those who have not been vaccinated against the disease.\n\nThe good news is that guidance from the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Centers for Disease Control has determined that unimmunized students can return to school immediately if they are vaccinated against mumps.\n\nStudents who have religious or medical exemptions for the MMR [measles, mumps, rubella] vaccine may be excluded from school for 25 days or more, depending on the course of the outbreak. But again, if students are vaccinated with the MMR vaccine they can return to school immediately.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The state of Montana can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/35926.

Large outbreaks occurred in 2006 (6584 cases) and in 2009 and 2010 (approximately 3500 cases). Outbreaks occurred primarily among previously vaccinated persons in densely populated settings (colleges and religious communities). A provisional total of 438 mumps cases were reported in 2013.\n\nMMR vaccine is recommended routinely for all children age 12 through 15 months, with a 2nd dose at age 4 through 6 years. The 2nd dose is not a booster, but rather is intended to produce immunity in the small number of people who fail to respond to the 1st dose. 2-5% of people do not develop measles immunity after the 1st dose of vaccine. This occurs for a variety of reasons.\n\nTo protect against mumps, adults with no evidence of immunity should get 1 dose of MMR unless the adult is in a high-risk group. High-risk people need 2 doses and include healthcare personnel, international travelers, and students at post-high school educational institutions, among others (excerpted/edited from http://www.immunize.org/askexperts/experts_mmr.asp).\n\nMumps is no longer common in the United States, but periodic mumps outbreaks occur, particularly in winter and spring, and cases may still occur despite prior vaccination.

All of the confirmed cases attend Belgrade High School or Belgrade Middle School.\n\nMumps is a viral disease characterized by swelling of the parotid or salivary glands along the face, neck, and jaw. The swelling can last from 2 to 10 days. The incubation period, (time from when you were infected to when you have symptoms) is 12-25 days. Other symptoms, in addition to the swelling around the neck and jaw, include fever, malaise (tiredness), muscle aches, and headache. Up to 25% of people with mumps may have few or no symptoms.\n\nMumps is spread by droplets of saliva or mucus from the mouth, nose, or throat of an infected person. Saliva can pass from one person to another when they share straws, spoons, forks, cups, cans, bottles, and even lip gloss. Mumps is also commonly spread when an infected person coughs or sneezes, and a non-infected person inhales respiratory droplets that contain the virus.\n\nIf you do have mumps, you should avoid prolonged, close contact with other people until at least 5 days after your salivary glands begin to swell because you are contagious during this time.\n\nParents of children who may be most susceptible to mumps will be notified by staff from Gallatin City-County Health Department who will provide information and health care guidance. In most cases, students who are most susceptible to mumps are those who have not been vaccinated against the disease.\n\nThe good news is that guidance from the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Centers for Disease Control has determined that unimmunized students can return to school immediately if they are vaccinated against mumps.\n\nStudents who have religious or medical exemptions for the MMR [measles, mumps, rubella] vaccine may be excluded from school for 25 days or more, depending on the course of the outbreak. But again, if students are vaccinated with the MMR vaccine they can return to school immediately.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The state of Montana can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/35926.

Outbreaks occurred primarily among previously vaccinated persons in densely populated settings (colleges and religious communities). A provisional total of 438 mumps cases were reported in 2013.\n\nMMR vaccine is recommended routinely for all children age 12 through 15 months, with a 2nd dose at age 4 through 6 years. The 2nd dose is not a booster, but rather is intended to produce immunity in the small number of people who fail to respond to the 1st dose. 2-5% of people do not develop measles immunity after the 1st dose of vaccine. This occurs for a variety of reasons.\n\nTo protect against mumps, adults with no evidence of immunity should get 1 dose of MMR unless the adult is in a high-risk group.

All of the confirmed cases attend Belgrade High School or Belgrade Middle School.\n\nMumps is a viral disease characterized by swelling of the parotid or salivary glands along the face, neck, and jaw. The swelling can last from 2 to 10 days. The incubation period, (time from when you were infected to when you have symptoms) is 12-25 days. Other symptoms, in addition to the swelling around the neck and jaw, include fever, malaise (tiredness), muscle aches, and headache. Up to 25% of people with mumps may have few or no symptoms.\n\nMumps is spread by droplets of saliva or mucus from the mouth, nose, or throat of an infected person. Saliva can pass from one person to another when they share straws, spoons, forks, cups, cans, bottles, and even lip gloss. Mumps is also commonly spread when an infected person coughs or sneezes, and a non-infected person inhales respiratory droplets that contain the virus.\n\nIf you do have mumps, you should avoid prolonged, close contact with other people until at least 5 days after your salivary glands begin to swell because you are contagious during this time.\n\nParents of children who may be most susceptible to mumps will be notified by staff from Gallatin City-County Health Department who will provide information and health care guidance. In most cases, students who are most susceptible to mumps are those who have not been vaccinated against the disease.\n\nThe good news is that guidance from the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Centers for Disease Control has determined that unimmunized students can return to school immediately if they are vaccinated against mumps.\n\nStudents who have religious or medical exemptions for the MMR [measles, mumps, rubella] vaccine may be excluded from school for 25 days or more, depending on the course of the outbreak. But again, if students are vaccinated with the MMR vaccine they can return to school immediately.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The state of Montana can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/35926.

Large outbreaks occurred in 2006 (6584 cases) and in 2009 and 2010 (approximately 3500 cases). Outbreaks occurred primarily among previously vaccinated persons in densely populated settings (colleges and religious communities). A provisional total of 438 mumps cases were reported in 2013.\n\nMMR vaccine is recommended routinely for all children age 12 through 15 months, with a 2nd dose at age 4 through 6 years. The 2nd dose is not a booster, but rather is intended to produce immunity in the small number of people who fail to respond to the 1st dose. 2-5% of people do not develop measles immunity after the 1st dose of vaccine. This occurs for a variety of reasons.\n\nTo protect against mumps, adults with no evidence of immunity should get 1 dose of MMR unless the adult is in a high-risk group. High-risk people need 2 doses and include healthcare personnel, international travelers, and students at post-high school educational institutions, among others (excerpted/edited from http://www.immunize.org/askexperts/experts_mmr.asp).\n\nMumps is no longer common in the United States, but periodic mumps outbreaks occur, particularly in winter and spring, and cases may still occur despite prior vaccination. Crowded environments, such as college classes, organized sports, or dormitories, are a major contributing factor to the spread of mumps if the virus is introduced.\n\n80 to 90% of vaccinees will be fully protected, but those who do become infected following vaccination tend to have milder disease when exposed to the virus. If a community maintains a high vaccination rate, the risk of exposure declines too. - Mod.LK]\nSee Also\nMumps - USA (03): (MA) student cases 20160308.4078373\nMumps - USA (02): (NH) student cases, alert 20160229.4057550\nMumps - USA: (CO,KY) increased incidence 20160225.4050452\n2015\n----\nMumps - Norway: increased incidence 20151109.3776723\nMumps - Argentina: (SF) increased incidence 20151031.3758370\nMumps - USA (08): (IL) college students 20150922.3662990\nMumps - USA (07): (IL) community college students, RFI 20150918.3654737\nMumps - USA (06): (IL) returning university students, further development 20150828.3608518\nMumps - USA (05): (IA) returning university students 20150821.3594465\nMumps - Ireland (02) 20150806.3563027\nMumps - USA (04): (IL, MO) university students 20150730.3546295\nMumps - USA (03): (IL) university students 20150616.3442934\nMumps - Canada (02): (ON) school children 20150624.3462267\nMumps - Canada (QC): school children, correction (ON) 20150529.3396108\nMumps - Canada (QC): school children 20150529.3395573\nMumps - Australia (WA) 20150426.3323826\nMumps - Ireland: football players 20150223.3185969\nMumps - USA (02): (ID) university students 20150209.3153606\nMumps - UK: (Scotland) 20150204.3142750\nMumps - USA: (PA) professional hockey team players 20150109.3080644\n.................................................sb/lk/mj/ml", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "measles", "mumps", "rubella"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2016-03-16 00:00:00", "2016-03-16 00:00:00", "2016-03-16 00:00:00", "2016-02-20 00:00:00", "2016-03-16 00:00:00", "2012-03-16 00:00:00", "1135-03-16 00:00:00", "2006-03-16 00:00:00", "2009-03-16 00:00:00", "2010-03-16 00:00:00", "2013-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-08 00:00:00", "2021-03-07 00:00:00", "2021-03-06 00:00:00", "2021-03-05 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "QC", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Gallatin City - County Health Department", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Belgrade", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Gallatin County", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Montana", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Scotland", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Mumps - Ireland", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "SF", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "the United States", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Massachusetts", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "4084267", "headline": "PRO/EDR> Mumps - USA (04): (MA, MT) student cases", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=4084267", "date": "2016-03-11 09:06:43", "main_text": "MUMPS - USA (04): (MASSACHUSETTS, MONTANA) STUDENT CASES\n********************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nIn this update:\n[1] Massachusetts: University of Massachusetts students\n[2] Montana: Belgrade schools\n\n******\n[1] Massachusetts: University of Massachusetts students\nDate: Wed 9 Mar 2016\nSource: Outbreak News Today [edited]\nhttp://outbreaknewstoday.com/umass-boston-reports-2nd-mumps-case-99723/\n\n\nFollowing reports of the 1st case of mumps in a UMass [University of Massachusetts] Boston (UMB) last week [week of 1 Mar 2016], school officials announced [Tue 8 Mar 2016] a 2nd confirmed case of the contagious viral disease.\n\nThe 1st on campus case occurred on 20 Feb 2016 during the UMB Men's hockey team match against University of Southern Maine (USM), according to a University Health Services release.\n\nUSM has previously reported a confirmed mumps case last week.\n\nMumps is a contagious disease.

Further information would be appreciated regarding the source of the virus responsible for the initiation of the outbreak and the failure of vaccination to contain the spread of the outbreak. So far it has been reported [in ProMED-mail post 20150828.3608518] that: \"Champaign-Urbana [Illinois] is experiencing the largest outbreak of the mumps ever to hit the area with around 100 cases confirmed as of Wednesday morning [26 Aug 2015]. Researchers say the mass mumps outbreak began this spring [2015] on the University of Illinois campus.

So the CDC and the Illinois Department of Public Health recommend everyone in the community get a 3rd booster shot, which increases that immunity level to 95 percent.\" - Mod.CP\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/7999.]\nSee Also\nMumps - USA (06): (IL) returning university students, further development 20150828.3608518\nMumps - USA (05): (IA) returning university students 20150821.3594465\nMumps - Ireland (02) 20150806.3563027\nMumps - USA (04): (IL, MO) university students 20150730.3546295\nMumps - USA (03): (IL) university students 20150616.3442934\nMumps - Canada (02): (ON) school children 20150624.3462267\nMumps - Canada (QC): school children, correction (ON) 20150529.3396108\nMumps - Canada (QC): school children 20150529.3395573\nMumps Australia (WA) 20150426.33238\nMumps - Ireland: football players 20150223.3185969\nMumps - USA (02): (ID) university students 20150209.3153606\nMumps - UK: (Scotland) 20150204.3142750\nMumps - USA: (PA) professional hockey team players 20150109.3080644\n2014\n----\nMumps - USA (08): (ID) university students 20141122.2982582\nMumps - USA: (OH) university students 20140308.2321285\n2013\n----\nMumps - USA (06): (NJ) bar & grill associated 20130908.1931146\nMumps - USA (05): (NJ) young adults, correction 20130719.1832549\nMumps - USA (04): (NJ) young adults 20130717.1830577\nMumps - USA (03): (VA) university students 20130328.1608579\nMumps - USA (02): (VA) university students 20130319.1594231\nMumps - USA: (MD) university students 20130316.1589886\n2012\n----\nMumps, 2011 - USA: (CA) university students 20121206.1441071\n2011\n----\nMumps - USA (04): (CA) university students 20111011.3045\nMumps - USA (03): (CA) university students 20111007.3014\nMumps - USA (02): (CA) university students, alert 20111006.3008\nMumps - USA: (IL) university students 20110928.2936\n.................................................sb/cp/je/ml", "reports": [{"diseases": ["measles", "mumps", "rubella"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2021-03-07 00:00:00", "2015-09-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-17 00:00:00", "2015-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-06 00:00:00", "2021-03-05 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-08 00:00:00", "2021-03-06 00:00:00", "2021-03-05 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2011-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "MD", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "QC", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Illinois", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Scotland", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Mumps - Ireland", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "McLean County", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "3608518", "headline": "PRO/EDR> Mumps - USA (06): (IL) returning university students, further development", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=3608518", "date": "2015-05-29 18:41:31", "main_text": "MUMPS - CANADA (QUEBEC): SCHOOL CHILDREN\n****************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n[The original post of this erroneously put Guelph in Quebec rather than Ontario where it belongs. - Mod.MPP]\n\nDate: Fri 29 May 2015\nSource Guelph Mercury [edited]\nhttp://www.guelphmercury.com/news-story/5649727-public-health-investigating-mumps-outbreak-in-two-guelph-high-schools/\n\n\nWellington-Dufferin-Guelph Public Health is investigating an outbreak of mumps at 2 Guelph high schools, the 1st cases of the disease in the area since 2010.\n\nChuck Ferguson, spokesperson for the health unit, said there are 2 reported cases of mumps at 2 different Catholic high schools, Bishop Macdonell and Our Lady of Lourdes. \"We haven't determined a link between the cases, and there are 4 suspected cases in total that we're investigating,\" Ferguson said on Thursday [28 May 2015].\n\nPeople can protect themselves from getting mumps by getting the free vaccination, part of the measles, mumps rubella (MMR) childhood vaccine.

Ferguson said it's unclear where the mumps outbreak started, but there are sporadic cases in Ontario, and the 1st case may have been brought into the area through travel.\n\nThe symptoms of mumps include fever, swollen glands, and headache. It's caused by a virus, and antibiotics cannot treat it, so doctors often let it run its course. Mumps used to be a rare disease but is now making somewhat of a comeback.\n\nWhile people born before 1970 are supposed to have natural immunity to the mumps, those born in the 1980s and 1990s may have missed getting the 2nd dose of the vaccine, which was introduced in 1996.\n\n[Byline: May Warren]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The Public health Agency of Canada (2014) states that: Outbreaks of mumps continue to occur in Canada, and the proportion of cases aged 20 years and older has increased.

Watch for symptoms, even if you have been vaccinated, and stay home if you are sick. If you experience mumps symptoms (fever, headache, muscle aches, fatigue, and swelling of the cheek and jaw area) contact your private healthcare provider.\n\nIt's a campus expectation that anyone suspected of having mumps stays home from school, work, or similar activities for 5 days. We encourage faculty and staff to allow students with mumps symptoms to stay home from class and work, and to provide alternate arrangements.\n\nThere is no treatment for mumps, but you can soothe your symptoms by getting plenty of bed rest, taking over-the-counter pain killers such as ibuprofen or Tylenol to relieve any pain, and drinking plenty of fluids.\n\n2. Take a page from the flu playbook with preventive actions. Wash your hands regularly with soap and water; sneeze and cough into a tissue or your elbow; and avoid sharing drinks, food, and utensils.\n\n3. Check your immunization records to make sure you've had 2 doses of the MMR vaccine. See your private healthcare provider or local pharmacy if you need a 2nd dose.\n\nFor more information:\nMumps FAQs http://www.uhs.wisc.edu/health-topics/mumps/faq.pdf\nMumps (CDC) http://www.cdc.gov/mumps/\n\n--\nJanet Welter, DVM, MPH, PHD, DACLAM\nChief Campus Veterinarian\nUniversity of Wisconsin-Madison\n<welter@rarc.wisc.edu>\nhttp://www.rarc.wisc.edu\n\n[ProMED-mail appreciates this report from Dr Welter.

Mumps is mild and not a \"severe\" disease, but there can be no room for complacency, said Dr. Antonio Alemany, Chief of Primary Care. Dr. Alemany stated that the outbreak had begun at the beginning of the month [February 2013] and that the outbreak is not restricted to Madrid. He stated that it represents a new cycle of the disease, which tends to occur every 3-6 years.\n\nHe said that people \"are more or less protected,\" depending on the immunogenic capability of the vaccines they might have received. Dr. Alemany explained that vaccines used in Spain before 1999 had a 50.5 percent antigen content [protective capacity?], whereas those vaccines used more recently, particularly those manufactured \"using more advanced technology,\" have a \"much higher protection capacity,\" between 88 and 90 percent. Dr. Alemany recognized that children vaccinated before 1999 have a 50.5 percent likelihood of being protected, meaning that \"they do not have a complete defense\" against the disease as a consequence of the characteristics of that particular vaccine they had received.\n\nDr. Alemany also stated that, from an epidemiological point of view, \"being that this disease is quite communicable, we can expect that the number of cases of mumps in Madrid may increase,\" but he pointed out that there is no [reason] for concern \"because of the typical characteristics of this condition.\" Dr Alemany also stated that: \"It depends on the characteristics of the virus and climatic conditions, since outbreaks may occur more frequently during the cold season.\" Dr. Alemany also indicated that cases of mumps are occurring in several autonomous communities, \"since viruses do not recognize borders or geographical limits.\"\n\nAccording to Dr Alemany, mumps is a common disease during infancy \"that usually does not necessitate hospitalisation and can be treated at home with plenty of rest, lots of non-acidic fluids, with use of analgesics for alleviating headache or for temperature control.\" He explained also that in many cases, a person may have the virus and not develop the disease, or he/she may develop a mild form of this condition.\n\nOn the other hand, Dr. Salvador Victoria, Counselor of the Presidency and Spokesman for the Madrid Community Local Government, stated last Thursday [14 Feb 2013] that the outbreak of mumps recorded in Madrid \"is similar to the situation occurring in other areas in Spain, and that it does not have a special significance.\"\n\nAccording to the General Direction for Primary Care, the present situation is not a general outbreak, but it consists of \"local outbreaks occurring in specific sites\" in which \"timely epidemiological investigations are being carried out.\" When asked about this situation in a press conference after the Government Council meeting, Dr. Victoria explained that the Madrid Health Council had changed the vaccine in 1999 that was provided at that time by the Spanish Ministry of Health; and he mentioned also that in 2007, a vaccination campaign was carried out in 9- to 12-year old children, \"so they may have complete immunity against mumps.\"\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Outbreaks of mumps have been frequent throughout Spain in recent years. The symptoms of mumps usually develop 14 to 25 days after a person is infected with mumps virus. The average incubation period is around 17 days. Swelling of the parotid glands is the most common symptom of mumps. Both glands are usually affected by the swelling, although only one gland can be affected. The swelling can cause pain, tenderness, and difficulty with swallowing. Other symptoms of the mumps include: headache, joint pain, sickness, abdominal pain and fever.\n\nMumps is spread in the same way as colds and flu: via infected droplets of saliva that can be inhaled or picked up from surfaces and passed into the mouth or nose. A person is most contagious 1-2 days before the onset of symptoms and for 5 days afterwards. During this time, it is important to try to prevent spreading the infection to others, particularly teenagers and young adults who have not been vaccinated. Normally, infection resolves without complications and provides life-long immunity.\n\nFor unvaccinated persons born before 1957 who lack laboratory evidence of measles, mumps and/or rubella immunity or laboratory confirmation of disease, healthcare facilities should consider vaccinating these individuals with 2 doses of MMR vaccine at the appropriate interval (for measles and mumps) and one dose of MMR vaccine (for rubella), respectively. For unvaccinated personnel born before 1957 who lack laboratory evidence of measles, mumps and/or rubella immunity or laboratory confirmation of disease, healthcare facilities should recommend 2 doses of MMR vaccine during an outbreak of measles or mumps and one dose during an outbreak of rubella.\n\nTwo doses of mumps vaccine are 88 percent (range: 66-95 percent) effective at preventing the disease; one dose is 78 percent (range: 49-92 percent) effective. The 1st vaccine against mumps was licensed in the United States in 1967, and by 2005, high 2-dose childhood vaccination coverage reduced disease rates by 99 percent. Adults at higher risk, such as university students, health care personnel, and international travelers, and persons with potential mumps outbreak exposure, should ensure that they have been vaccinated.

Mumps is mild and not a \"severe\" disease, but there can be no room for complacency, said Dr. Antonio Alemany, Chief of Primary Care. Dr. Alemany stated that the outbreak had begun at the beginning of the month [February 2013] and that the outbreak is not restricted to Madrid. He stated that it represents a new cycle of the disease, which tends to occur every 3-6 years.\n\nHe said that people \"are more or less protected,\" depending on the immunogenic capability of the vaccines they might have received. Dr. Alemany explained that vaccines used in Spain before 1999 had a 50.5 percent antigen content [protective capacity?], whereas those vaccines used more recently, particularly those manufactured \"using more advanced technology,\" have a \"much higher protection capacity,\" between 88 and 90 percent. Dr. Alemany recognized that children vaccinated before 1999 have a 50.5 percent likelihood of being protected, meaning that \"they do not have a complete defense\" against the disease as a consequence of the characteristics of that particular vaccine they had received.\n\nDr. Alemany also stated that, from an epidemiological point of view, \"being that this disease is quite communicable, we can expect that the number of cases of mumps in Madrid may increase,\" but he pointed out that there is no [reason] for concern \"because of the typical characteristics of this condition.\" Dr Alemany also stated that: \"It depends on the characteristics of the virus and climatic conditions, since outbreaks may occur more frequently during the cold season.\" Dr. Alemany also indicated that cases of mumps are occurring in several autonomous communities, \"since viruses do not recognize borders or geographical limits.\"\n\nAccording to Dr Alemany, mumps is a common disease during infancy \"that usually does not necessitate hospitalisation and can be treated at home with plenty of rest, lots of non-acidic fluids, with use of analgesics for alleviating headache or for temperature control.\" He explained also that in many cases, a person may have the virus and not develop the disease, or he/she may develop a mild form of this condition.\n\nOn the other hand, Dr. Salvador Victoria, Counselor of the Presidency and Spokesman for the Madrid Community Local Government, stated last Thursday [14 Feb 2013] that the outbreak of mumps recorded in Madrid \"is similar to the situation occurring in other areas in Spain, and that it does not have a special significance.\"\n\nAccording to the General Direction for Primary Care, the present situation is not a general outbreak, but it consists of \"local outbreaks occurring in specific sites\" in which \"timely epidemiological investigations are being carried out.\" When asked about this situation in a press conference after the Government Council meeting, Dr. Victoria explained that the Madrid Health Council had changed the vaccine in 1999 that was provided at that time by the Spanish Ministry of Health; and he mentioned also that in 2007, a vaccination campaign was carried out in 9- to 12-year old children, \"so they may have complete immunity against mumps.\"\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Outbreaks of mumps have been frequent throughout Spain in recent years. The symptoms of mumps usually develop 14 to 25 days after a person is infected with mumps virus. The average incubation period is around 17 days. Swelling of the parotid glands is the most common symptom of mumps. Both glands are usually affected by the swelling, although only one gland can be affected. The swelling can cause pain, tenderness, and difficulty with swallowing. Other symptoms of the mumps include: headache, joint pain, sickness, abdominal pain and fever.\n\nMumps is spread in the same way as colds and flu: via infected droplets of saliva that can be inhaled or picked up from surfaces and passed into the mouth or nose. A person is most contagious 1-2 days before the onset of symptoms and for 5 days afterwards. During this time, it is important to try to prevent spreading the infection to others, particularly teenagers and young adults who have not been vaccinated. Normally, infection resolves without complications and provides life-long immunity.\n\nFor unvaccinated persons born before 1957 who lack laboratory evidence of measles, mumps and/or rubella immunity or laboratory confirmation of disease, healthcare facilities should consider vaccinating these individuals with 2 doses of MMR vaccine at the appropriate interval (for measles and mumps) and one dose of MMR vaccine (for rubella), respectively. For unvaccinated personnel born before 1957 who lack laboratory evidence of measles, mumps and/or rubella immunity or laboratory confirmation of disease, healthcare facilities should recommend 2 doses of MMR vaccine during an outbreak of measles or mumps and one dose during an outbreak of rubella.\n\nTwo doses of mumps vaccine are 88 percent (range: 66-95 percent) effective at preventing the disease; one dose is 78 percent (range: 49-92 percent) effective. The 1st vaccine against mumps was licensed in the United States in 1967, and by 2005, high 2-dose childhood vaccination coverage reduced disease rates by 99 percent.

Officials at the Ministry of Health insist that this is not a serious outbreak. However, many children are not attending school out of fear of infection.\n\nMumps is caused by mumps virus and is spread when a person comes into contact with infected droplets of saliva or mucus, usually through coughing, sneezing, or sharing dishes.

Mumps is a viral illness characterized\nby swollen salivary glands, fever, and headache. In severe cases,\nmeningitis, orchitis (testicular swelling) and hearing loss can\noccur.\n\nSince February 2011, a total of 90 cases have been reported, mostly\nin young adults.\n\nSetting:\nWhistler is a popular ski and outdoor activities destination north of\nVancouver that attracts visitors and seasonal employees from all over\nthe world. The permanent population of Whistler is estimated to be\napproximately 10 500, although the area attracts over 2700 seasonal\nemployees and 14 800 visitors each year. An additional estimated 3700\nemployees commute to Whistler on a daily basis from surrounding\ncommunities, increasing the daily average population to approximately\n32 000. The entire region of Vancouver Coastal Health, which includes\nWhistler, has a population of 1.1 million.\n\nEpidemiology:\nMumps is spread by direct contact with the saliva of an infected\nperson. Current case definition includes individuals having symptoms\nconsistent with mumps illness and:\n(a) laboratory confirmation of mumps RNA; or\n(b) epidemiological links to a laboratory confirmed case; or\n(c) recent travel to Whistler.\n\nThe earliest date of symptom onset was 22 Feb 2011 in a Whistler\nresident, and while cases continue to reside predominantly in the\nWhistler region, increasing numbers of cases in surrounding cities,\nincluding Vancouver and Richmond, have been reported. Several of these\nrecent cases have no known links to Whistler; though many are\nclustered among the same household or social network.\n\nThe disease is primarily affecting young adults; the median age of\nall cases is 27.0 years (age range: 1-54 years), and 54 cases (60.0\nper cent) are male.\n\nTransmission among initial Whistler-linked cases was primarily by\nsharing marijuana joints, cigarettes, drinks, and utensils.\n\nNearly 60 per cent of cases with links to Whistler are employed\neither by the mountain resort or in the hospitality and retail sector.\nThese sectors employ a largely seasonal workforce arising from many\ndifferent countries across the globe.\n\nClinical presentation:\nNearly all cases presented with unilateral or bilateral parotitis\n(97.8 per cent). 22 per cent of male cases presented with orchitis.\nOther symptoms included fever (58.9 per cent), myalgia (34.4 per\ncent), headache (24.4 per cent), pharyngitis (22.2 per cent),\narthralgia (7.8 per cent), fatigue (7.8 per cent), and nausea (5.6 per\ncent).\n\nIdentified cases have been encouraged to self-isolate for 9 days\nfollowing symptom onset.\n\nImmunization history:\nThe majority of cases have not received the 2 doses of\nmumps-containing vaccine needed for full protection. As Whistler hosts\na largely transient (and international) population, immunization\nhistories of residents vary greatly.\n\nIn our health region, most children and youth born between 1970 and\n1995 will not have had 2 doses of MMR, as the 2nd dose was not\nincluded in the routine immunization schedule for this age group.

Mumps is a viral illness characterized\nby swollen salivary glands, fever, and headache. In severe cases,\nmeningitis, orchitis (testicular swelling) and hearing loss can\noccur.\n\nSince February 2011, a total of 90 cases have been reported, mostly\nin young adults.\n\nSetting:\nWhistler is a popular ski and outdoor activities destination north of\nVancouver that attracts visitors and seasonal employees from all over\nthe world. The permanent population of Whistler is estimated to be\napproximately 10 500, although the area attracts over 2700 seasonal\nemployees and 14 800 visitors each year. An additional estimated 3700\nemployees commute to Whistler on a daily basis from surrounding\ncommunities, increasing the daily average population to approximately\n32 000. The entire region of Vancouver Coastal Health, which includes\nWhistler, has a population of 1.1 million.\n\nEpidemiology:\nMumps is spread by direct contact with the saliva of an infected\nperson. Current case definition includes individuals having symptoms\nconsistent with mumps illness and:\n(a) laboratory confirmation of mumps RNA; or\n(b) epidemiological links to a laboratory confirmed case; or\n(c) recent travel to Whistler.\n\nThe earliest date of symptom onset was 22 Feb 2011 in a Whistler\nresident, and while cases continue to reside predominantly in the\nWhistler region, increasing numbers of cases in surrounding cities,\nincluding Vancouver and Richmond, have been reported. Several of these\nrecent cases have no known links to Whistler; though many are\nclustered among the same household or social network.\n\nThe disease is primarily affecting young adults; the median age of\nall cases is 27.0 years (age range: 1-54 years), and 54 cases (60.0\nper cent) are male.\n\nTransmission among initial Whistler-linked cases was primarily by\nsharing marijuana joints, cigarettes, drinks, and utensils.\n\nNearly 60 per cent of cases with links to Whistler are employed\neither by the mountain resort or in the hospitality and retail sector.\nThese sectors employ a largely seasonal workforce arising from many\ndifferent countries across the globe.\n\nClinical presentation:\nNearly all cases presented with unilateral or bilateral parotitis\n(97.8 per cent). 22 per cent of male cases presented with orchitis.\nOther symptoms included fever (58.9 per cent), myalgia (34.4 per\ncent), headache (24.4 per cent), pharyngitis (22.2 per cent),\narthralgia (7.8 per cent), fatigue (7.8 per cent), and nausea (5.6 per\ncent).\n\nIdentified cases have been encouraged to self-isolate for 9 days\nfollowing symptom onset.\n\nImmunization history:\nThe majority of cases have not received the 2 doses of\nmumps-containing vaccine needed for full protection. As Whistler hosts\na largely transient (and international) population, immunization\nhistories of residents vary greatly.\n\nIn our health region, most children and youth born between 1970 and\n1995 will not have had 2 doses of MMR, as the 2nd dose was not\nincluded in the routine immunization schedule for this age group. A\n2nd MMR at 18 months of age became part of routine infant immunization\nin 1996.\n\nGenotype:\n16 cases to date have been confirmed as Genotype G, a common genotype\nof mumps that was observed in several other recent North American\noutbreaks.\n\nPublic health response to date:\n- Notification has been given to all primary care providers and\nemergency physicians in the health region to be vigilant for patients\npresenting with swelling of the parotid gland, or other\nmumps-compatible illness.\n\n- Collection of laboratory specimens including blood for serology and\nbuccal swabs and/or urine for detection of mumps virus RNA.\n\n- Recommendation of 2 doses of mumps containing vaccine for all\nindividuals born on or after 1 Jan 1970.

Over 600 doses of MMR were given to contacts of cases and\nindividuals who live and work in Whistler through vaccination at\nworksites and a drop-in clinic at a centrally located community\npharmacy. Approximately 50 per cent of those taking up vaccination\nwere overseas nationals of Australia, New Zealand, United Kingdom,\nSouth Africa, and smaller numbers from other European and Asian\ncountries.\n\nFurther planned public health response:\n- Continued messaging and immunization to target post-secondary\neducational institutions in the region with a particular focus on new\nstudents arriving in August 2011 for the start of the new academic\nyear.\n\n- Targeted immunization at staff orientations to be held by major\nemployers in the resort municipality of Whistler in anticipation of\nnew international staff arriving in the fall [2011].\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nPaul Martiquet MD\nMedical Health Officer\n\nReka Gustafson MD\nMedical Health Officer and Medical Director Communicable Disease\nControl\n\nEmily Laflamme MPH\nRegional Epidemiologist, Public Health Surveillance Unit\n\nJat Sandhu PhD\nRegional Director, Public Health Surveillance Unit\nOffice of the Chief Medical Health Officer\nVancouver Coastal Health Authority\n800 601 West Broadway\nVancouver, British Columbia\nCanada V5Z 4C2\nhttp:www.vch.ca\n<phsu@vch.ca>\n\n[Contact <phsu@vch.ca> at Vancouver Coastal Health Authority\nhttp:www.vch.ca for further information.\n\nFor the VCH Health Watch monthly public health bulletin (with map of\nregion), see\nhttp://www.vch.ca/your_health/disease_surveillance/health_watch/.\n\nSince the previous report, the number of confirmed cases of mumps\nvirus infection has increased from 77 to 90, indicating that the\noutbreak has not yet been contained.

Several of these\nrecent cases have no known links to Whistler; though many are\nclustered among the same household or social network.\n\nThe disease is primarily affecting young adults; the median age of\nall cases is 27.0 years (age range: 1-54 years), and 54 cases (60.0\nper cent) are male.\n\nTransmission among initial Whistler-linked cases was primarily by\nsharing marijuana joints, cigarettes, drinks, and utensils.\n\nNearly 60 per cent of cases with links to Whistler are employed\neither by the mountain resort or in the hospitality and retail sector.\nThese sectors employ a largely seasonal workforce arising from many\ndifferent countries across the globe.\n\nClinical presentation:\nNearly all cases presented with unilateral or bilateral parotitis\n(97.8 per cent). 22 per cent of male cases presented with orchitis.\nOther symptoms included fever (58.9 per cent), myalgia (34.4 per\ncent), headache (24.4 per cent), pharyngitis (22.2 per cent),\narthralgia (7.8 per cent), fatigue (7.8 per cent), and nausea (5.6 per\ncent).\n\nIdentified cases have been encouraged to self-isolate for 9 days\nfollowing symptom onset.\n\nImmunization history:\nThe majority of cases have not received the 2 doses of\nmumps-containing vaccine needed for full protection. As Whistler hosts\na largely transient (and international) population, immunization\nhistories of residents vary greatly.\n\nIn our health region, most children and youth born between 1970 and\n1995 will not have had 2 doses of MMR, as the 2nd dose was not\nincluded in the routine immunization schedule for this age group. A\n2nd MMR at 18 months of age became part of routine infant immunization\nin 1996.\n\nGenotype:\n16 cases to date have been confirmed as Genotype G, a common genotype\nof mumps that was observed in several other recent North American\noutbreaks.\n\nPublic health response to date:\n- Notification has been given to all primary care providers and\nemergency physicians in the health region to be vigilant for patients\npresenting with swelling of the parotid gland, or other\nmumps-compatible illness.\n\n- Collection of laboratory specimens including blood for serology and\nbuccal swabs and/or urine for detection of mumps virus RNA.\n\n- Recommendation of 2 doses of mumps containing vaccine for all\nindividuals born on or after 1 Jan 1970. One dose is recommended for\nall individuals born between 1 Jan 1957 and 31 Dec 1969 who do not\nhave evidence of immunity to mumps.\n\n- Notification to all health jurisdictions across Canada through the\nCNPHI (Canadian Network for Public Health Intelligence) web platform.\n\n- Media advisory in Whistler (March and April 2011) on outbreak and\ninformation on where to access vaccine and messaging for those without\nhealth insurance.\n\n- Drop-in immunization clinics have been held at the Whistler Health\nCare Centre since March 2011.\n\n- A targeted immunization campaign was launched in Whistler to\ncoincide with the 10-day Telus Ski & Snowboard Festival (15-24 Apr\n2011), the largest annual winter sports and music festival in North\nAmerica. Over 600 doses of MMR were given to contacts of cases and\nindividuals who live and work in Whistler through vaccination at\nworksites and a drop-in clinic at a centrally located community\npharmacy. Approximately 50 per cent of those taking up vaccination\nwere overseas nationals of Australia, New Zealand, United Kingdom,\nSouth Africa, and smaller numbers from other European and Asian\ncountries.\n\nFurther planned public health response:\n- Continued messaging and immunization to target post-secondary\neducational institutions in the region with a particular focus on new\nstudents arriving in August 2011 for the start of the new academic\nyear.\n\n- Targeted immunization at staff orientations to be held by major\nemployers in the resort municipality of Whistler in anticipation of\nnew international staff arriving in the fall [2011].\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nPaul Martiquet MD\nMedical Health Officer\n\nReka Gustafson MD\nMedical Health Officer and Medical Director Communicable Disease\nControl\n\nEmily Laflamme MPH\nRegional Epidemiologist, Public Health Surveillance Unit\n\nJat Sandhu PhD\nRegional Director, Public Health Surveillance Unit\nOffice of the Chief Medical Health Officer\nVancouver Coastal Health Authority\n800 601 West Broadway\nVancouver, British Columbia\nCanada V5Z 4C2\nhttp:www.vch.ca\n<phsu@vch.ca>\n\n[Contact <phsu@vch.ca> at Vancouver Coastal Health Authority\nhttp:www.vch.ca for further information.\n\nFor the VCH Health Watch monthly public health bulletin (with map of\nregion), see\nhttp://www.vch.ca/your_health/disease_surveillance/health_watch/.\n\nSince the previous report, the number of confirmed cases of mumps\nvirus infection has increased from 77 to 90, indicating that the\noutbreak has not yet been contained.

Mumps is a viral illness characterized\nby swollen salivary glands, fever, and headache. In severe cases,\nmeningitis, orchitis (testicular swelling) and hearing loss can\noccur.\n\nSince February 2011, a total of 90 cases have been reported, mostly\nin young adults.\n\nSetting:\nWhistler is a popular ski and outdoor activities destination north of\nVancouver that attracts visitors and seasonal employees from all over\nthe world.

After\ninitial spread into other populations throughout the state and areas of New\nJersey, CDC epidemiologist Kathleen Gallagher said the disease has now been\nexported to Connecticut, Quebec, and Israel.\n\nIncidence remains highest among boys in the Hasidic community because they\nusually spend longer hours at private schools, Gallagher said, mostly\naround other people belonging to this population. In addition to day\nstudents, these schools also board students from a variety of other regions\nand states. Therefore, boys potentially exposed to mumps may inadvertently\nspread the disease among other communities when they return home for\nholidays, emphasizing the importance of up-to-date, 2-dose vaccinations in\nthis age group.\n\nThe potential for a 3-dose measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine (MMR II,\nMerck) was also a focal point at the meeting. Currently, officials in\nOrange County, New York have tried administering a 3rd dose to children in\nefforts to control the outbreak. Although little data are available,\nGallagher said studies to evaluate the efficacy of a 3-dose vaccine regimen\nare ongoing.\n\nAdditional discussion addressed the genotype responsible for the outbreak,\nas well as the current vaccine's ability to effectively prevent the spread\nof disease. Officials have identified genotype G from the United Kingdom,\nwhich was also present in the 2006 mumps outbreak, as the culprit for the\ncurrent outbreak. Gallagher noted that there was \"nothing special\" about\ngenotype G, and the MMR vaccine may [induce] antibodies to this strain.\n\nNevertheless, other committee members said the mumps component of the MMRV\n[measles, mumps, rubella, varicella] has always been less effective than\nthe measles and rubella components, and some attributed this to the strain\ncontained in the vaccine. \"It's a complex situation that we have, but as\nI've said to my colleagues from Merck, we do need a better mumps strain\nthan we currently have,\" Stanley A Plotkin, MD, of Sanofi-Pasteur, said.\n\"Even though we have a number of [mumps strains], none of them are perfect.\"\n\n[byline: Melissa Foster]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nHealthMap Alerts via ProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The number of cases in this outbreak has increased from the 1521 reported\non 29 Jan 2010 to the current figure of 2336. This outbreak is still far\nfrom contained and now has spread in the USA to the state of Connecticut,\nas well as to Quebec, Canada, and Israel.\n\nThe mumps component of the current MMR triple vaccine may be less effective\nthan the other components of the triple vaccine. The potential value of\ngiving 3 doses of MMR vaccine was discussed at the ACIP meeting, in efforts\nto control the outbreak. Results are awaited. - Mod.CP]\nSee Also\nMumps - USA (03): (NY, NJ) 20100211.0481\nMumps - USA (02): NYC 20100210.0462\nMumps - USA: (NY) 20100209.0436\n2009\n---\nMumps - USA (07): (NY) 20091220.4297\nMumps - USA (06): (NY,NJ,CT) alert 20091219.4289\nMumps - USA (NY, NJ), Canada (QC) 20091113.3934\nMumps - USA (04): (NY) 20091106.3835\nMumps - USA (03): (NY) 20091023.3655\n\n.................cp/mj/sh\n\n\n\n*##########################################################*\n************************************************************\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.

After\ninitial spread into other populations throughout the state and areas of New\nJersey, CDC epidemiologist Kathleen Gallagher said the disease has now been\nexported to Connecticut, Quebec, and Israel.\n\nIncidence remains highest among boys in the Hasidic community because they\nusually spend longer hours at private schools, Gallagher said, mostly\naround other people belonging to this population. In addition to day\nstudents, these schools also board students from a variety of other regions\nand states. Therefore, boys potentially exposed to mumps may inadvertently\nspread the disease among other communities when they return home for\nholidays, emphasizing the importance of up-to-date, 2-dose vaccinations in\nthis age group.\n\nThe potential for a 3-dose measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine (MMR II,\nMerck) was also a focal point at the meeting. Currently, officials in\nOrange County, New York have tried administering a 3rd dose to children in\nefforts to control the outbreak. Although little data are available,\nGallagher said studies to evaluate the efficacy of a 3-dose vaccine regimen\nare ongoing.\n\nAdditional discussion addressed the genotype responsible for the outbreak,\nas well as the current vaccine's ability to effectively prevent the spread\nof disease. Officials have identified genotype G from the United Kingdom,\nwhich was also present in the 2006 mumps outbreak, as the culprit for the\ncurrent outbreak. Gallagher noted that there was \"nothing special\" about\ngenotype G, and the MMR vaccine may [induce] antibodies to this strain.\n\nNevertheless, other committee members said the mumps component of the MMRV\n[measles, mumps, rubella, varicella] has always been less effective than\nthe measles and rubella components, and some attributed this to the strain\ncontained in the vaccine. \"It's a complex situation that we have, but as\nI've said to my colleagues from Merck, we do need a better mumps strain\nthan we currently have,\" Stanley A Plotkin, MD, of Sanofi-Pasteur, said.\n\"Even though we have a number of [mumps strains], none of them are perfect.\"\n\n[byline: Melissa Foster]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nHealthMap Alerts via ProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The number of cases in this outbreak has increased from the 1521 reported\non 29 Jan 2010 to the current figure of 2336.

After\ninitial spread into other populations throughout the state and areas of New\nJersey, CDC epidemiologist Kathleen Gallagher said the disease has now been\nexported to Connecticut, Quebec, and Israel.\n\nIncidence remains highest among boys in the Hasidic community because they\nusually spend longer hours at private schools, Gallagher said, mostly\naround other people belonging to this population. In addition to day\nstudents, these schools also board students from a variety of other regions\nand states. Therefore, boys potentially exposed to mumps may inadvertently\nspread the disease among other communities when they return home for\nholidays, emphasizing the importance of up-to-date, 2-dose vaccinations in\nthis age group.\n\nThe potential for a 3-dose measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine (MMR II,\nMerck) was also a focal point at the meeting. Currently, officials in\nOrange County, New York have tried administering a 3rd dose to children in\nefforts to control the outbreak. Although little data are available,\nGallagher said studies to evaluate the efficacy of a 3-dose vaccine regimen\nare ongoing.\n\nAdditional discussion addressed the genotype responsible for the outbreak,\nas well as the current vaccine's ability to effectively prevent the spread\nof disease. Officials have identified genotype G from the United Kingdom,\nwhich was also present in the 2006 mumps outbreak, as the culprit for the\ncurrent outbreak. Gallagher noted that there was \"nothing special\" about\ngenotype G, and the MMR vaccine may [induce] antibodies to this strain.\n\nNevertheless, other committee members said the mumps component of the MMRV\n[measles, mumps, rubella, varicella] has always been less effective than\nthe measles and rubella components, and some attributed this to the strain\ncontained in the vaccine. \"It's a complex situation that we have, but as\nI've said to my colleagues from Merck, we do need a better mumps strain\nthan we currently have,\" Stanley A Plotkin, MD, of Sanofi-Pasteur, said.\n\"Even though we have a number of [mumps strains], none of them are perfect.\"\n\n[byline: Melissa Foster]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nHealthMap Alerts via ProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The number of cases in this outbreak has increased from the 1521 reported\non 29 Jan 2010 to the current figure of 2336.

New York City is dealing with nearly 600 confirmed and suspected\ncases. Most of the patients have one thing in common: religion. The cases\nstarted turning up in late August [2009].\n\nMumps is an illness characterized by acute swelling of the salivary gland\nlasting 2 or more days. The illness can cause deafness and encephalitis. A\nperson can be infected for 2 days before symptoms appear. The health\ndepartment is telling people who suspect they have mumps to stay home for 5\ndays. Children who are not fully vaccinated against mumps are the highest\nrisk of infection.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[2]\nDate: Sat 19 Dec 2009\nSource: The Jewish Week [edited]\n<http://www.thejewishweek.com/viewArticle/c36_a17351/News/New_York.html>\n\n\nNot immune from mumps\n---------------------\nStemming from an initial mumps outbreak that wreaked havoc at a Jewish camp\nthis summer [summer of 2009], 247 New York City residents plus 131 other\nstate residents [as of 1 Dec 2009] have since contracted the disease, which\nremains mostly contained among fervently Orthodox adolescent boys in\npockets of New York, New Jersey, and Quebec, according to official reports\nfrom the New York City and State Departments of Health.\n\nThe trigger case occurred back in June [2009], when an 11 year old boy\nreturned to his Sullivan County summer camp after traveling in the United\nKingdom, where an ongoing outbreak has now reached about 4000 cases [see\n<http://www.hpa.org.uk/hpr/infections/immunisation.htm>, the Centers for\nDisease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported. From there, the mumps spread\nto 24 other boys at the camp and continued to plague their local\ncommunities when they returned home, and the median age of patients remains\naround 14.\n\nBut perhaps the most frustrating news to some parents is that most of the\naffected patients had received their proper 2-dose vaccination as children\n-- 83 per cent, according to CDC.\n\n\"This is a very confusing issue not only for ourselves but for providers\nand parents,\" said Cindy Schulte, vaccine-preventable disease surveillance\nofficer at the New York State Department of Health. \"If you have a\npopulation that's fairly well but unevenly vaccinated, by logic, you're\ngoing to end up having some disease in the effective population.\" The\nmeasles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine has an 85 to 91 per cent efficacy\nrate among those who take the proper doses, she said.\n\nThe commonest symptoms of this viral disease are fever, muscle aches, and\nparotitis -- the signature inflammation of the salivary glands below the\near. Though no deaths have occurred thus far and symptoms may often be\nsubtle, there have been several hospitalizations and one potential case of\nmeningoencephalitis (inflammation of the brain), according to Dr Debra\nBlog, medical director at the Bureau of Immunization Program in the New\nYork State Department of Health.\n\nMumps can be particularly dangerous to pubescent boys, doctors say, because\na small number will develop orchitis, a swelling of the testicles that can\npotentially (though rarely) lead to infertility.

While\nmumps cases among women have certainly increased since the summer, New York\nCity infections remain around 79 per cent male, Blog explained.\n\n\"These communities tend to have social contact with themselves and tend to\nbe a bit isolated from the outside community,\" she said. \"In New York City\nespecially it's going through their schools.\"\n\nAs of 30 Oct 2009, CDC had only reported a total of 179 cases in New York\nand New Jersey and another 15 in Canada, but New York City health officials\nsay that the numbers have increased so dramatically in the past month\nsimply because doctors are taking more care to report their ill patients to\nthe government.\n\n\"We're still getting cases reported virtually every day,\" said Dr Chris\nZimmerman, medical director at the Bureau of Immunization in the New York\nCity Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. \"There was a substantial\nincrease just from the week before the alert to when the alert came out.\"\nIt is difficult to maintain an exact number of cases, Schulte added,\nbecause disease spread is a \"fluid number\".\n\nA mumps outbreak of this size has not occurred since 2006, when the United\nStates experienced over 6500 cases that were particularly hard-hitting\namong college dormitory residents in Iowa.

If an\nolder child has not yet received the vaccine but hasn't yet been exposed to\nthe illness, this child too should be immunized.

From there, the mumps spread\nto 24 other boys at the camp and continued to plague their local\ncommunities when they returned home, and the median age of patients remains\naround 14.\n\nBut perhaps the most frustrating news to some parents is that most of the\naffected patients had received their proper 2-dose vaccination as children\n-- 83 per cent, according to CDC.\n\n\"This is a very confusing issue not only for ourselves but for providers\nand parents,\" said Cindy Schulte, vaccine-preventable disease surveillance\nofficer at the New York State Department of Health. \"If you have a\npopulation that's fairly well but unevenly vaccinated, by logic, you're\ngoing to end up having some disease in the effective population.\" The\nmeasles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine has an 85 to 91 per cent efficacy\nrate among those who take the proper doses, she said.\n\nThe commonest symptoms of this viral disease are fever, muscle aches, and\nparotitis -- the signature inflammation of the salivary glands below the\near. Though no deaths have occurred thus far and symptoms may often be\nsubtle, there have been several hospitalizations and one potential case of\nmeningoencephalitis (inflammation of the brain), according to Dr Debra\nBlog, medical director at the Bureau of Immunization Program in the New\nYork State Department of Health.\n\nMumps can be particularly dangerous to pubescent boys, doctors say, because\na small number will develop orchitis, a swelling of the testicles that can\npotentially (though rarely) lead to infertility. The same goes for girls,\nwho can develop swelling of the ovaries that can lead to sterility. While\nmumps cases among women have certainly increased since the summer, New York\nCity infections remain around 79 per cent male, Blog explained.\n\n\"These communities tend to have social contact with themselves and tend to\nbe a bit isolated from the outside community,\" she said. \"In New York City\nespecially it's going through their schools.\"\n\nAs of 30 Oct 2009, CDC had only reported a total of 179 cases in New York\nand New Jersey and another 15 in Canada, but New York City health officials\nsay that the numbers have increased so dramatically in the past month\nsimply because doctors are taking more care to report their ill patients to\nthe government.\n\n\"We're still getting cases reported virtually every day,\" said Dr Chris\nZimmerman, medical director at the Bureau of Immunization in the New York\nCity Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. \"There was a substantial\nincrease just from the week before the alert to when the alert came out.\"\nIt is difficult to maintain an exact number of cases, Schulte added,\nbecause disease spread is a \"fluid number\".\n\nA mumps outbreak of this size has not occurred since 2006, when the United\nStates experienced over 6500 cases that were particularly hard-hitting\namong college dormitory residents in Iowa. But the current wave largely\nremains within pocketed chasidic communities, all linked back to that one\nsummer camp flare-up. \"There have been less than a handful of cases outside\nthe community,\" Zimmerman said. \"The population is segregated -- these kids\nare not going to public schools, they're going to yeshivas,\" he continued.\n\"They only have the opportunity to interact with other boys in their\ncommunity.\"\n\nAnd while statistics show that an overwhelming majority of the kids in\nthese neighborhoods are in fact properly vaccinated, the few outliers are\nprobably the ones perpetuating the disease spread, he added. \"Overall,\nimmunization coverage is good, but this is a community that has had\nresistance to MMR vaccines -- their parents have claimed religious\nexemptions,\" Zimmerman said.\n\nYet despite outbreaks that have resurfaced from time to time, state medical\nofficials still maintain the mumps vaccine is a successful product,\nparticularly in what Blog calls \"evenly vaccinated communities\" -- those\nwho pretty much unanimously undergo the immunization.\n\nRegarding the disease spread, another crucial element worth considering\namong the allegedly vaccinated patients is whether or not their dosages\nwere properly refrigerated speculated Dr Michael Augenbraun, a professor of\nepidemiology at Downstate Medical Center in Brooklyn. \"Breaks in the 'cold\nchain' are a serious problem for vaccine efficacy if, for example, an\noffice allowed for a vaccine to sit out on countertops overnight,\"\nAugenbraun said, noting that we have no way of knowing this after so many\nyears, however.\n\nThus far, despite the one hospitalization and some cases of orchitis,\ncomplications from this outbreak have generally been minimal. About 56 per\ncent of the confirmed cases exhibited the parotitis, according to Schulte.\n\"We're not seeing the same rate of complications that we saw in the\npre-vaccine era,\" Zimmerman said, noting that before the vaccine, another\ndangerous side effect of the mumps was permanent deafness. But the subtle\nnature of so many of these current cases may be yet another reason that the\ndisease is spreading, because parents neglect to see a doctor about their\nchildren's illnesses. So what can parents do to protect their families from\ncatching the mumps?\n\nThey should make sure that their children have received the 2 dosages of\nthe vaccine on time, ideally before their 1st birthday, Schulte said. If an\nolder child has not yet received the vaccine but hasn't yet been exposed to\nthe illness, this child too should be immunized. And if a child or adult\nbecomes sick, the best thing to do, as always, is to stay home from school\nor work, wash hands frequently and see a doctor. Blog added, \"Isolation and\nvaccination are the most effective things along with common sense.\"\n\n[byline: Sharon Udasin]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nHealthMap alerts via ProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[This is now a very large outbreak in a population that is considered to be\nwell vaccinated.

From there, the mumps spread\nto 24 other boys at the camp and continued to plague their local\ncommunities when they returned home, and the median age of patients remains\naround 14.\n\nBut perhaps the most frustrating news to some parents is that most of the\naffected patients had received their proper 2-dose vaccination as children\n-- 83 per cent, according to CDC.\n\n\"This is a very confusing issue not only for ourselves but for providers\nand parents,\" said Cindy Schulte, vaccine-preventable disease surveillance\nofficer at the New York State Department of Health. \"If you have a\npopulation that's fairly well but unevenly vaccinated, by logic, you're\ngoing to end up having some disease in the effective population.\" The\nmeasles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine has an 85 to 91 per cent efficacy\nrate among those who take the proper doses, she said.\n\nThe commonest symptoms of this viral disease are fever, muscle aches, and\nparotitis -- the signature inflammation of the salivary glands below the\near. Though no deaths have occurred thus far and symptoms may often be\nsubtle, there have been several hospitalizations and one potential case of\nmeningoencephalitis (inflammation of the brain), according to Dr Debra\nBlog, medical director at the Bureau of Immunization Program in the New\nYork State Department of Health.\n\nMumps can be particularly dangerous to pubescent boys, doctors say, because\na small number will develop orchitis, a swelling of the testicles that can\npotentially (though rarely) lead to infertility. The same goes for girls,\nwho can develop swelling of the ovaries that can lead to sterility. While\nmumps cases among women have certainly increased since the summer, New York\nCity infections remain around 79 per cent male, Blog explained.\n\n\"These communities tend to have social contact with themselves and tend to\nbe a bit isolated from the outside community,\" she said. \"In New York City\nespecially it's going through their schools.\"\n\nAs of 30 Oct 2009, CDC had only reported a total of 179 cases in New York\nand New Jersey and another 15 in Canada, but New York City health officials\nsay that the numbers have increased so dramatically in the past month\nsimply because doctors are taking more care to report their ill patients to\nthe government.\n\n\"We're still getting cases reported virtually every day,\" said Dr Chris\nZimmerman, medical director at the Bureau of Immunization in the New York\nCity Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. \"There was a substantial\nincrease just from the week before the alert to when the alert came out.\"\nIt is difficult to maintain an exact number of cases, Schulte added,\nbecause disease spread is a \"fluid number\".\n\nA mumps outbreak of this size has not occurred since 2006, when the United\nStates experienced over 6500 cases that were particularly hard-hitting\namong college dormitory residents in Iowa.

But the subtle\nnature of so many of these current cases may be yet another reason that the\ndisease is spreading, because parents neglect to see a doctor about their\nchildren's illnesses. So what can parents do to protect their families from\ncatching the mumps?\n\nThey should make sure that their children have received the 2 dosages of\nthe vaccine on time, ideally before their 1st birthday, Schulte said. If an\nolder child has not yet received the vaccine but hasn't yet been exposed to\nthe illness, this child too should be immunized. And if a child or adult\nbecomes sick, the best thing to do, as always, is to stay home from school\nor work, wash hands frequently and see a doctor.

So what can parents do to protect their families from\ncatching the mumps?\n\nThey should make sure that their children have received the 2 dosages of\nthe vaccine on time, ideally before their 1st birthday, Schulte said. If an\nolder child has not yet received the vaccine but hasn't yet been exposed to\nthe illness, this child too should be immunized. And if a child or adult\nbecomes sick, the best thing to do, as always, is to stay home from school\nor work, wash hands frequently and see a doctor.

This may be a\nconsequence of negligence or avoidance of vaccination on grounds of\nreligious or other beliefs. - Mod.CP]\n\n[ProMED-mail would like to thank Dr. George Robertson for submitting\na similar article. - Mod.MPP]\nSee Also\nMumps - UK (10): (England) 20091014.3545\nMumps - USA (02): (MA), students 20090917.3265\nMumps - UK (09): (England) 20090704.2407\nMumps - UK (08): (England) 20090630.2370\nMumps, students - UK (07): (England, Wales) 20090524.1943\nMumps: USA (MA); UK (Scotland) 20090419.1482\nMumps - USA: (MA) ex Ireland 20090417.1455\nMumps, students - UK (06): (England, Wales) 20090410.1379\nMumps, students - UK (05): (ENG) 20090221.0728\nMumps - UK (04): (England, Wales) 20090212.0634\nMumps - UK (03): (England) 20090211.0619\nMumps - UK (02): (Wales) 20090206.0544\nMumps - UK (WALES) 20090130.0418\n..................mpp/cp/ejp/mpp\n\n*##########################################################*\n************************************************************\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.

Outbreaks have been reported from several\nuniversities and colleges. A similar increase has been reported from\nthe Republic of Ireland [2].\n\nA large epidemic of mumps affecting university students 1st occurred\nin the academic year 2004/5 [3] and continued into 2005/6, declining\nin 2006/7 and 2007/8. During the final quarter of 2008, 695 cases of\nmumps were confirmed compared to 447 in the previous quarter [4]. So\nfar in 2009, 998 cases of mumps with onset in January or February\nhave been confirmed mumps IgM or RNA positive in England and Wales.\nThis compares to 322, 274, and 1173 cases in the same periods of\n2008, 2007, and 2006 respectively. During 2009, cases have been\nconfirmed in all English regions and Wales with high numbers from the\nSouth West (204), South East (180), and North West (162) regions. For\nthe remaining regions the number of cases confirmed was as follows:\nYorkshire and Humberside (115), London (86), East of England (81),\nWest Midlands (64), East Midlands (48), North East (30), and Wales\n(27). The genotype currently circulating is a G5, the same strain\nthat has been circulating over the past 5 years and responsible for\noutbreaks in other parts of Europe [5,6].\n\n[These data are illustrated in the original text by a figure showing\nthe 5 week moving average of mumps notifications, England and Wales\n2003-2009. - Mod.CP]\n\nReason for the increase\n-----------------------\nThe previous epidemic was attributed to a cohort of young adults,\nborn between 1981 and 1990, who were at increased risk of mumps.\nThese individuals were born before the implementation of the routine\n2-dose MMR programme and had therefore either received no MMR\nvaccine, or only one dose. As control of mumps was excellent after\n1990, this group remained susceptible until they entered the\nuniversity or college setting, when transmission of mumps was\nfacilitated. During 2008, 1403 (57 percent) of the confirmed cases\nwere in those born between 1981 and 1990 . [Data illustrated by a\nfigure in the original text. - Mod.CP]\n\nDespite this clear picture, the reason why the numbers of cases have\nincreased in this academic year, after remaining lower in both 2006/7\nand 2007/8 is not entirely clear. One explanation may be that, since\nthe widespread transmission in 2005/6, 3 new cohorts of students have\nentered college and therefore another susceptible pool has been\nre-established in this setting.\n\nIn the previous epidemic, although the vaccinated cohorts were\nlargely protected from mumps, cases were confirmed in vaccinated\nindividuals. By the 2008/9 academic year, most students would have\nbeen eligible for one or 2 doses of MMR (measles, mumps, rubella),\nand so a higher proportion of vaccine failures are expected amongst\nthe cases. Initial reports are consistent with this observation.\n\nIn 2004-5, analysis of protection from vaccination showed that,\nalthough individual protection from vaccination was high, there was\nevidence of declining protection over time, particularly in those who\nhad only received one dose of vaccine [7]. Investigations during\nuniversity outbreaks in the United States, where vaccine coverage for\n2 doses has been in place for longer, also suggested that waning\nprotection may have contributed [8]. Secondary vaccine failure may\ntherefore also explain a proportion of cases.\n\nSurveillance and control\n------------------------\nContinued surveillance, including confirmation of the diagnosis, is\nimportant for ensuring accurate epidemiological data. In persons who\nhave been previously vaccinated, the serological diagnosis of mumps\ncan be difficult as the IgM response may be delayed and reach lower\nlevels. For rapid diagnosis, an oral fluid taken in the 1st 14 days\nof illness is preferred as this can be tested for both IgM\n(Immunoglobulin M) and viral RNA (ribonucleic acid). If this is not\npossible then parallel serum and throat swab or paired serum samples\ncan be collected.\n\nIn 2005 and 2006, the incident team for the national mumps outbreak\nrecommended that the priorities were to ensure that systems were in\nplace to ensure that those entering university were fully vaccinated\nwith MMR in the future. This included ensuring that pupils attending\nfor the Year 10 booster and university entrants from 2005 onwards had\nreceived 2 doses of MMR.\n\nThe team also concluded that university vaccination campaigns in\nparticular are likely to achieve low uptake and are unlikely to stop\noutbreaks. The offer of individual vaccination, however, should be\navailable to students who are unvaccinated or have received only one\ndose of MMR. Approaches being taken in individual universities this\nyear have included using text messaging and university computer\nnetworks to alert students to these recommendations.\n\nReferences\n----------\n1.

Outbreaks have been reported from several\nuniversities and colleges. A similar increase has been reported from\nthe Republic of Ireland [2].\n\nA large epidemic of mumps affecting university students 1st occurred\nin the academic year 2004/5 [3] and continued into 2005/6, declining\nin 2006/7 and 2007/8. During the final quarter of 2008, 695 cases of\nmumps were confirmed compared to 447 in the previous quarter [4]. So\nfar in 2009, 998 cases of mumps with onset in January or February\nhave been confirmed mumps IgM or RNA positive in England and Wales.\nThis compares to 322, 274, and 1173 cases in the same periods of\n2008, 2007, and 2006 respectively. During 2009, cases have been\nconfirmed in all English regions and Wales with high numbers from the\nSouth West (204), South East (180), and North West (162) regions. For\nthe remaining regions the number of cases confirmed was as follows:\nYorkshire and Humberside (115), London (86), East of England (81),\nWest Midlands (64), East Midlands (48), North East (30), and Wales\n(27). The genotype currently circulating is a G5, the same strain\nthat has been circulating over the past 5 years and responsible for\noutbreaks in other parts of Europe [5,6].\n\n[These data are illustrated in the original text by a figure showing\nthe 5 week moving average of mumps notifications, England and Wales\n2003-2009. - Mod.CP]\n\nReason for the increase\n-----------------------\nThe previous epidemic was attributed to a cohort of young adults,\nborn between 1981 and 1990, who were at increased risk of mumps.\nThese individuals were born before the implementation of the routine\n2-dose MMR programme and had therefore either received no MMR\nvaccine, or only one dose. As control of mumps was excellent after\n1990, this group remained susceptible until they entered the\nuniversity or college setting, when transmission of mumps was\nfacilitated. During 2008, 1403 (57 percent) of the confirmed cases\nwere in those born between 1981 and 1990 . [Data illustrated by a\nfigure in the original text. - Mod.CP]\n\nDespite this clear picture, the reason why the numbers of cases have\nincreased in this academic year, after remaining lower in both 2006/7\nand 2007/8 is not entirely clear. One explanation may be that, since\nthe widespread transmission in 2005/6, 3 new cohorts of students have\nentered college and therefore another susceptible pool has been\nre-established in this setting.\n\nIn the previous epidemic, although the vaccinated cohorts were\nlargely protected from mumps, cases were confirmed in vaccinated\nindividuals. By the 2008/9 academic year, most students would have\nbeen eligible for one or 2 doses of MMR (measles, mumps, rubella),\nand so a higher proportion of vaccine failures are expected amongst\nthe cases. Initial reports are consistent with this observation.\n\nIn 2004-5, analysis of protection from vaccination showed that,\nalthough individual protection from vaccination was high, there was\nevidence of declining protection over time, particularly in those who\nhad only received one dose of vaccine [7]. Investigations during\nuniversity outbreaks in the United States, where vaccine coverage for\n2 doses has been in place for longer, also suggested that waning\nprotection may have contributed [8]. Secondary vaccine failure may\ntherefore also explain a proportion of cases.\n\nSurveillance and control\n------------------------\nContinued surveillance, including confirmation of the diagnosis, is\nimportant for ensuring accurate epidemiological data. In persons who\nhave been previously vaccinated, the serological diagnosis of mumps\ncan be difficult as the IgM response may be delayed and reach lower\nlevels. For rapid diagnosis, an oral fluid taken in the 1st 14 days\nof illness is preferred as this can be tested for both IgM\n(Immunoglobulin M) and viral RNA (ribonucleic acid). If this is not\npossible then parallel serum and throat swab or paired serum samples\ncan be collected.\n\nIn 2005 and 2006, the incident team for the national mumps outbreak\nrecommended that the priorities were to ensure that systems were in\nplace to ensure that those entering university were fully vaccinated\nwith MMR in the future. This included ensuring that pupils attending\nfor the Year 10 booster and university entrants from 2005 onwards had\nreceived 2 doses of MMR.\n\nThe team also concluded that university vaccination campaigns in\nparticular are likely to achieve low uptake and are unlikely to stop\noutbreaks. The offer of individual vaccination, however, should be\navailable to students who are unvaccinated or have received only one\ndose of MMR. Approaches being taken in individual universities this\nyear have included using text messaging and university computer\nnetworks to alert students to these recommendations.\n\nReferences\n----------\n1.

Outbreaks have been reported from several\nuniversities and colleges. A similar increase has been reported from\nthe Republic of Ireland [2].\n\nA large epidemic of mumps affecting university students 1st occurred\nin the academic year 2004/5 [3] and continued into 2005/6, declining\nin 2006/7 and 2007/8. During the final quarter of 2008, 695 cases of\nmumps were confirmed compared to 447 in the previous quarter [4]. So\nfar in 2009, 998 cases of mumps with onset in January or February\nhave been confirmed mumps IgM or RNA positive in England and Wales.\nThis compares to 322, 274, and 1173 cases in the same periods of\n2008, 2007, and 2006 respectively. During 2009, cases have been\nconfirmed in all English regions and Wales with high numbers from the\nSouth West (204), South East (180), and North West (162) regions. For\nthe remaining regions the number of cases confirmed was as follows:\nYorkshire and Humberside (115), London (86), East of England (81),\nWest Midlands (64), East Midlands (48), North East (30), and Wales\n(27). The genotype currently circulating is a G5, the same strain\nthat has been circulating over the past 5 years and responsible for\noutbreaks in other parts of Europe [5,6].\n\n[These data are illustrated in the original text by a figure showing\nthe 5 week moving average of mumps notifications, England and Wales\n2003-2009. - Mod.CP]\n\nReason for the increase\n-----------------------\nThe previous epidemic was attributed to a cohort of young adults,\nborn between 1981 and 1990, who were at increased risk of mumps.\nThese individuals were born before the implementation of the routine\n2-dose MMR programme and had therefore either received no MMR\nvaccine, or only one dose. As control of mumps was excellent after\n1990, this group remained susceptible until they entered the\nuniversity or college setting, when transmission of mumps was\nfacilitated. During 2008, 1403 (57 percent) of the confirmed cases\nwere in those born between 1981 and 1990 . [Data illustrated by a\nfigure in the original text. - Mod.CP]\n\nDespite this clear picture, the reason why the numbers of cases have\nincreased in this academic year, after remaining lower in both 2006/7\nand 2007/8 is not entirely clear. One explanation may be that, since\nthe widespread transmission in 2005/6, 3 new cohorts of students have\nentered college and therefore another susceptible pool has been\nre-established in this setting.\n\nIn the previous epidemic, although the vaccinated cohorts were\nlargely protected from mumps, cases were confirmed in vaccinated\nindividuals. By the 2008/9 academic year, most students would have\nbeen eligible for one or 2 doses of MMR (measles, mumps, rubella),\nand so a higher proportion of vaccine failures are expected amongst\nthe cases. Initial reports are consistent with this observation.\n\nIn 2004-5, analysis of protection from vaccination showed that,\nalthough individual protection from vaccination was high, there was\nevidence of declining protection over time, particularly in those who\nhad only received one dose of vaccine [7]. Investigations during\nuniversity outbreaks in the United States, where vaccine coverage for\n2 doses has been in place for longer, also suggested that waning\nprotection may have contributed [8]. Secondary vaccine failure may\ntherefore also explain a proportion of cases.\n\nSurveillance and control\n------------------------\nContinued surveillance, including confirmation of the diagnosis, is\nimportant for ensuring accurate epidemiological data. In persons who\nhave been previously vaccinated, the serological diagnosis of mumps\ncan be difficult as the IgM response may be delayed and reach lower\nlevels. For rapid diagnosis, an oral fluid taken in the 1st 14 days\nof illness is preferred as this can be tested for both IgM\n(Immunoglobulin M) and viral RNA (ribonucleic acid). If this is not\npossible then parallel serum and throat swab or paired serum samples\ncan be collected.\n\nIn 2005 and 2006, the incident team for the national mumps outbreak\nrecommended that the priorities were to ensure that systems were in\nplace to ensure that those entering university were fully vaccinated\nwith MMR in the future. This included ensuring that pupils attending\nfor the Year 10 booster and university entrants from 2005 onwards had\nreceived 2 doses of MMR.\n\nThe team also concluded that university vaccination campaigns in\nparticular are likely to achieve low uptake and are unlikely to stop\noutbreaks. The offer of individual vaccination, however, should be\navailable to students who are unvaccinated or have received only one\ndose of MMR. Approaches being taken in individual universities this\nyear have included using text messaging and university computer\nnetworks to alert students to these recommendations.\n\nReferences\n----------\n1.

Outbreaks have been reported from several\nuniversities and colleges. A similar increase has been reported from\nthe Republic of Ireland [2].\n\nA large epidemic of mumps affecting university students 1st occurred\nin the academic year 2004/5 [3] and continued into 2005/6, declining\nin 2006/7 and 2007/8. During the final quarter of 2008, 695 cases of\nmumps were confirmed compared to 447 in the previous quarter [4]. So\nfar in 2009, 998 cases of mumps with onset in January or February\nhave been confirmed mumps IgM or RNA positive in England and Wales.\nThis compares to 322, 274, and 1173 cases in the same periods of\n2008, 2007, and 2006 respectively. During 2009, cases have been\nconfirmed in all English regions and Wales with high numbers from the\nSouth West (204), South East (180), and North West (162) regions. For\nthe remaining regions the number of cases confirmed was as follows:\nYorkshire and Humberside (115), London (86), East of England (81),\nWest Midlands (64), East Midlands (48), North East (30), and Wales\n(27). The genotype currently circulating is a G5, the same strain\nthat has been circulating over the past 5 years and responsible for\noutbreaks in other parts of Europe [5,6].\n\n[These data are illustrated in the original text by a figure showing\nthe 5 week moving average of mumps notifications, England and Wales\n2003-2009. - Mod.CP]\n\nReason for the increase\n-----------------------\nThe previous epidemic was attributed to a cohort of young adults,\nborn between 1981 and 1990, who were at increased risk of mumps.\nThese individuals were born before the implementation of the routine\n2-dose MMR programme and had therefore either received no MMR\nvaccine, or only one dose. As control of mumps was excellent after\n1990, this group remained susceptible until they entered the\nuniversity or college setting, when transmission of mumps was\nfacilitated. During 2008, 1403 (57 percent) of the confirmed cases\nwere in those born between 1981 and 1990 . [Data illustrated by a\nfigure in the original text. - Mod.CP]\n\nDespite this clear picture, the reason why the numbers of cases have\nincreased in this academic year, after remaining lower in both 2006/7\nand 2007/8 is not entirely clear. One explanation may be that, since\nthe widespread transmission in 2005/6, 3 new cohorts of students have\nentered college and therefore another susceptible pool has been\nre-established in this setting.\n\nIn the previous epidemic, although the vaccinated cohorts were\nlargely protected from mumps, cases were confirmed in vaccinated\nindividuals. By the 2008/9 academic year, most students would have\nbeen eligible for one or 2 doses of MMR (measles, mumps, rubella),\nand so a higher proportion of vaccine failures are expected amongst\nthe cases. Initial reports are consistent with this observation.\n\nIn 2004-5, analysis of protection from vaccination showed that,\nalthough individual protection from vaccination was high, there was\nevidence of declining protection over time, particularly in those who\nhad only received one dose of vaccine [7]. Investigations during\nuniversity outbreaks in the United States, where vaccine coverage for\n2 doses has been in place for longer, also suggested that waning\nprotection may have contributed [8]. Secondary vaccine failure may\ntherefore also explain a proportion of cases.\n\nSurveillance and control\n------------------------\nContinued surveillance, including confirmation of the diagnosis, is\nimportant for ensuring accurate epidemiological data. In persons who\nhave been previously vaccinated, the serological diagnosis of mumps\ncan be difficult as the IgM response may be delayed and reach lower\nlevels. For rapid diagnosis, an oral fluid taken in the 1st 14 days\nof illness is preferred as this can be tested for both IgM\n(Immunoglobulin M) and viral RNA (ribonucleic acid). If this is not\npossible then parallel serum and throat swab or paired serum samples\ncan be collected.\n\nIn 2005 and 2006, the incident team for the national mumps outbreak\nrecommended that the priorities were to ensure that systems were in\nplace to ensure that those entering university were fully vaccinated\nwith MMR in the future. This included ensuring that pupils attending\nfor the Year 10 booster and university entrants from 2005 onwards had\nreceived 2 doses of MMR.\n\nThe team also concluded that university vaccination campaigns in\nparticular are likely to achieve low uptake and are unlikely to stop\noutbreaks. The offer of individual vaccination, however, should be\navailable to students who are unvaccinated or have received only one\ndose of MMR. Approaches being taken in individual universities this\nyear have included using text messaging and university computer\nnetworks to alert students to these recommendations.\n\nReferences\n----------\n1.

In the Clinic of Infectious Diseases (Medical Faculty,\nUniversity of Skopje) in January 2009 alone, there were 234 cases of\nmumps reported, including 50 who were hospitalized, 20 with a\ncomplication of orchitis [inflammation of the testes] and 18 with\nmeningitis. In the State Institute of Health, they are reporting 16\npercent of the mumps cases have complications, and more than half are\nteenagers between 15-19.\n\nAbout one third of the cases have received one mumps vaccination and\nsome have received 2 doses. The vaccine was introduced as a school\nrequirement in 1982. Until 1997, only one dose of the vaccine was\nrequired. The World Health Organization is now recommending 2 doses\nof the vaccine. The vaccine was not available due to a shortage in\nMacedonia from 1990-1994 and a lot of children at that time were not\nvaccinated. In December of 2008, the vaccine recommendation was\nextended to the age group 15-19.\n\nThe director of the Clinic of Infectious Diseases in Skopje, Zvonko\nMilenkovic, said that government has requested that the WHO help them\nwith tests to determine if the vaccine is protective against the virus\nthat is circulating. What is happening in Macedonia, he said, is\nsimilar to what happened to Western European countries like\nSwitzerland and England, and in the United States as well. In 1993,\nUNICEF donated mumps vaccines to Macedonia, but in the past 6 years\nall of the vaccines have been purchased from 2 companies, Pasteur and\nGlaxoSmithKline.\n\n--\nMarija PopStefanija, MPH, MS\nEpidemiologist\nMass Department of Public Health\nWestern Mass Public Health Center\nN424 Morril Bld.

Before the outbreak, Maine\nhad not reported a case in at least 20 years. Now mumps has spread across\nthe state, reaching its southernmost county and making nearly 75 children\nand adults sick statewide since September [2007].\nDisease trackers suspect that the Maine outbreak was imported from Canada,\nwhere 1140 people have fallen ill this year [2007], 14 times the average\nfor recent years.

Specialists said they believe that is exactly what happened with\nmumps. Like measles, it was a common childhood scourge that appeared headed\nfor extinction in the United States. But in 2005, a strain widely\ncirculating [not terribly common, clinically. - Mod.SH] in the United\nKingdom, where vaccination rates are significantly lower than in North\nAmerica, was imported to a New York state summer camp. Within a year, that\nsame strain was identified as the culprit in a Midwest outbreak. And it is\nbeing blamed for the cases in Canada this year.\n\"Mumps is essentially endemic in the rest of the world,\" said Dr James\nAlexander, a medical epidemiologist at the US Centers for Disease Control\nand Prevention (CDC). \"Canada and the United States were the 2 countries\nwhere mumps was close to being eliminated.\"\nThe virus is transmitted by direct contact with an infected person's\nsaliva, meaning it can travel through a kiss or on utensils, towels, or\ntissues. It causes severe swelling of salivary glands and is heralded by\nfever, headache, body aches, and glandular tenderness where the jaw forms\nan angle. Rarely fatal, it can result in significant complications,\nincluding inflammation of the testes, brain swelling, meningitis, and\nsterility. A vaccine introduced in 1967 led to a steep decline in mumps in\nthe United States, but within 2 decades, the virus had reemerged.\n\"Mumps has undoubtedly been with us for millennia, and it's not likely to\ndisappear just because we develop an effective vaccine,\" said Dr Kenneth\nMcIntosh, a disease specialist at Children's Hospital Boston.

Before the outbreak, Maine\nhad not reported a case in at least 20 years. Now mumps has spread across\nthe state, reaching its southernmost county and making nearly 75 children\nand adults sick statewide since September [2007].\nDisease trackers suspect that the Maine outbreak was imported from Canada,\nwhere 1140 people have fallen ill this year [2007], 14 times the average\nfor recent years. Most of the cases have been reported by 3 eastern\nprovinces -- Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and Prince Edward Island.\nSpecialists in Massachusetts are watching the migration of mumps with\nincreasing concern, knowing that many of the patients in Maine and Canada\nare college students, a group particularly susceptible because they are\nmobile and live in tight quarters, an ideal combination for disease\ntransmission.\n\"We are exploring every possible mumps case,\" said Dr Alfred DeMaria,\ndirector of communicable disease control for the Department of Public\nHealth in Massachusetts, where only 3 cases have been reported this year.\n\"We're going to be especially vigilant after the holidays,\" he said,\nbecause Boston students may have contact with students from Maine schools\nduring the break.\nThe resurgence of mumps illustrates the hardiness of a virus, the\nlimitations of a vaccine, and the realities of a world so hooked on air\ntravel that germs can spread from one country to another in a matter of\nhours. Specialists said they believe that is exactly what happened with\nmumps. Like measles, it was a common childhood scourge that appeared headed\nfor extinction in the United States. But in 2005, a strain widely\ncirculating [not terribly common, clinically. - Mod.SH] in the United\nKingdom, where vaccination rates are significantly lower than in North\nAmerica, was imported to a New York state summer camp. Within a year, that\nsame strain was identified as the culprit in a Midwest outbreak. And it is\nbeing blamed for the cases in Canada this year.\n\"Mumps is essentially endemic in the rest of the world,\" said Dr James\nAlexander, a medical epidemiologist at the US Centers for Disease Control\nand Prevention (CDC). \"Canada and the United States were the 2 countries\nwhere mumps was close to being eliminated.\"\nThe virus is transmitted by direct contact with an infected person's\nsaliva, meaning it can travel through a kiss or on utensils, towels, or\ntissues. It causes severe swelling of salivary glands and is heralded by\nfever, headache, body aches, and glandular tenderness where the jaw forms\nan angle. Rarely fatal, it can result in significant complications,\nincluding inflammation of the testes, brain swelling, meningitis, and\nsterility. A vaccine introduced in 1967 led to a steep decline in mumps in\nthe United States, but within 2 decades, the virus had reemerged.\n\"Mumps has undoubtedly been with us for millennia, and it's not likely to\ndisappear just because we develop an effective vaccine,\" said Dr Kenneth\nMcIntosh, a disease specialist at Children's Hospital Boston. One pivotal\nlesson derived from the return of the mumps in the late 1980s: a single\ndose of vaccine did not provide enough of a shield. It was then that\ndisease specialists began recommending that children receive 2 doses and\nthat schools bar students who were not vaccinated.\nAs Canadian specialists began investigating this year's outbreak, they\nquickly homed in on the vaccination history of patients, unearthing\nimportant clues.

Before the outbreak, Maine\nhad not reported a case in at least 20 years. Now mumps has spread across\nthe state, reaching its southernmost county and making nearly 75 children\nand adults sick statewide since September [2007].\nDisease trackers suspect that the Maine outbreak was imported from Canada,\nwhere 1140 people have fallen ill this year [2007], 14 times the average\nfor recent years. Most of the cases have been reported by 3 eastern\nprovinces -- Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and Prince Edward Island.\nSpecialists in Massachusetts are watching the migration of mumps with\nincreasing concern, knowing that many of the patients in Maine and Canada\nare college students, a group particularly susceptible because they are\nmobile and live in tight quarters, an ideal combination for disease\ntransmission.\n\"We are exploring every possible mumps case,\" said Dr Alfred DeMaria,\ndirector of communicable disease control for the Department of Public\nHealth in Massachusetts, where only 3 cases have been reported this year.\n\"We're going to be especially vigilant after the holidays,\" he said,\nbecause Boston students may have contact with students from Maine schools\nduring the break.\nThe resurgence of mumps illustrates the hardiness of a virus, the\nlimitations of a vaccine, and the realities of a world so hooked on air\ntravel that germs can spread from one country to another in a matter of\nhours. Specialists said they believe that is exactly what happened with\nmumps. Like measles, it was a common childhood scourge that appeared headed\nfor extinction in the United States. But in 2005, a strain widely\ncirculating [not terribly common, clinically. - Mod.SH] in the United\nKingdom, where vaccination rates are significantly lower than in North\nAmerica, was imported to a New York state summer camp. Within a year, that\nsame strain was identified as the culprit in a Midwest outbreak. And it is\nbeing blamed for the cases in Canada this year.\n\"Mumps is essentially endemic in the rest of the world,\" said Dr James\nAlexander, a medical epidemiologist at the US Centers for Disease Control\nand Prevention (CDC). \"Canada and the United States were the 2 countries\nwhere mumps was close to being eliminated.\"\nThe virus is transmitted by direct contact with an infected person's\nsaliva, meaning it can travel through a kiss or on utensils, towels, or\ntissues. It causes severe swelling of salivary glands and is heralded by\nfever, headache, body aches, and glandular tenderness where the jaw forms\nan angle. Rarely fatal, it can result in significant complications,\nincluding inflammation of the testes, brain swelling, meningitis, and\nsterility. A vaccine introduced in 1967 led to a steep decline in mumps in\nthe United States, but within 2 decades, the virus had reemerged.\n\"Mumps has undoubtedly been with us for millennia, and it's not likely to\ndisappear just because we develop an effective vaccine,\" said Dr Kenneth\nMcIntosh, a disease specialist at Children's Hospital Boston. One pivotal\nlesson derived from the return of the mumps in the late 1980s: a single\ndose of vaccine did not provide enough of a shield. It was then that\ndisease specialists began recommending that children receive 2 doses and\nthat schools bar students who were not vaccinated.\nAs Canadian specialists began investigating this year's outbreak, they\nquickly homed in on the vaccination history of patients, unearthing\nimportant clues. Nearly 73 per cent had received only a single dose of\nvaccine, while 19 per cent had no vaccination at all. Those who received at\nleast one dose generally had milder cases. \"I like to compare this disease\nto a heat-seeking missile,\" said Jeannette Macey, an epidemiologist with\nthe epidemiologist with the Public Health Agency of Canada. \"If there are\npeople in the population who are not protected, it's going to find them.\"\nIn Maine, authorities are collecting comparable data, but they know already\nthat many of the adults who became infected probably only got a single dose\nearlier in life. At the University of Southern Maine, where many of the\nstudents are older, at least 10 people have fallen ill, a spokeswoman said.\nDisease specialists from Maine and the federal CDC are also continuing to\ninvestigate exactly where the virus came from, running sophisticated\ngenetic testing and conducting extensive interviews. \"It's not surprising\nthat Maine would have cases,\" said Dr Dora Mills, director of Maine's CDC.\n\"New Brunswick is adjacent to Maine, and Nova Scotia might as well be,\nbecause there are several boats that go back and forth every day.\"\n[byline: Stephen Smith]\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail rapporteur Brent Barrett\n[There has been a considerable increase in the number of mumps cases\nreported in Maine since the initial report on 20 Nov 2007. The case count\nof 7 confirmed and 24 suspected cases of mumps has risen to at least 75\nconfirmed cases. It may be that as time progresses the State of Maine will\nbe required to instigate a comprehensive vaccination campaign to provide\nprotective immunity to those in the population who have previously received\na single vaccinations or none, to contain this outbreak - Mod.CP]\nSee Also\nMumps - Canada (11): (AB) 20071202.3881\nMumps - USA: (ME) 20071121.3777\nMumps - Canada (10): (AB) 20071118.3736\nMumps - Canada (09) (NS) 20071105.3598\nMumps - Canada (08) (multi-province, PEI) 20071025.3473\nMumps - Canada (multi-province) (02) 20070510.1501\nMumps - Canada (NS) (06) 20070501.1411\nMumps - Canada (NS) (02) 20070406.1162\nMumps - Canada (NS): RFI 20070331.1104\n..................cp/ejp/sh\n\n*##########################################################*\n************************************************************\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.

Given that the original\nNova Scotia outbreak was largely focussed on college students, it is\nnot surprising that the disease has spread to other provinces as\nclasses have ended and students are travelling back to their home towns.\nCBS News reported in a Fri 4 May [2007] update that health officials\nare considering a re-vaccination campaign for mumps. The province of\nNova Scotia and the Public Health Agency of Canada are looking at\nre-immunizing people against mumps.\nNova Scotia has experienced 203 cases of mumps since February [2007],\nincluding about 50 new cases that have surfaced since last week\n[23-27 Apr 2007], public health officials said on Fri 4 May 2007. New\nBrunswick and Prince Edward Island have also reported cases, mainly\namong young adults in their 20s. Half a dozen cases of mumps have\nspread as far as Ontario.\nMumps is a highly infectious disease that is spread by coughing,\nsneezing, sharing drinks or kissing. Many of the cases spread through\ndowntown bars in Halifax and on the campus of Dalhousie University,\nhealth officials said.\nSince exams wrapped up about 2 weeks ago [20 Apr 2007], most students\nhave left campus and the disease seems to be receding, said Marla\nCranston, a Dalhousie spokeswoman. The province is talking about a\nnew immunization program for university-aged students and health-care\nworkers, said Dr. Shelly Sarwal, a medical officer of health with the\nNova Scotia health department. \"Right now, we're going to start\ndiscussion with the universities and the district health authorities\nto figure out how to make this happen,\" Sarwal said, adding plans\nshould be in place by next week [7-11 May 2007].\n--\nCommunicated by:\nDavid N.

Previously, officials\nin the province had said that any catch-up campaign -- designed to\ngive a 2nd dose of the combined measles, mumps and rubella vaccine to\nyoung adults who only received one in childhood -- would need to be\ndone in conjunction with other provinces and territories.\n\"Ideally, we'd have the whole country moving together. And we're\nstill working with the other provinces and with the Public Health\nAgency (of Canada),\" said Dr. Shelly Sarwal, a medical officer of\nhealth for the province. \"But, Nova Scotia's going to have to take\nsome steps to protect Nova Scotians.\"\nThis week, there was a significant jump in cases in Nova Scotia, to\n203 from 157, with mumps now being reported in all 9 health regions\nin the province. As of yesterday [4 May 2007], New Brunswick reported\n34 cases and Prince Edward Island remains at one confirmed case. For\nthe 1st time the outbreak has moved out of the Maritimes to Central\nCanada, a development public health officials had warned might occur\nas the university year ended and Halifax students dispersed to their\nhomes throughout the Maritimes and beyond.\nDavid Jensen, a spokesperson with Ontario's Ministry of Health and\nLong-term Care, said the province's 3 confirmed cases -- in the\nOttawa, York and Waterloo public health units -- can all be linked to\nthe Nova Scotia outbreak. Test results are still pending on 5\nsuspected cases. Jensen said physicians and public health officials\nin the province should keep mumps in mind if they see patients who\nhave mumps-like symptoms. These include aches, pains, fever, loss of\nappetite and, in about 40 percent of cases, the hugely swollen saliva\nglands that give mumps its characteristic chipmunk-cheek look.\nThe Nova Scotia outbreak, which began in the 3rd week of February\n[2007], is the province's 3rd in 2 years. It is by far the largest;\nthe earlier outbreaks, in 2005, involved 13 and 19 cases\nrespectively. It is fuelled by a pool of susceptible young adults.\nSarwal said authorities believe many of the province's cases were\nvaccinated with MMR [measles, mumps, rubella vaccine] in childhood,\nbut received only one dose. The one-dose schedule for the MMR vaccine\nwas adequate to protect many people. If it had not been, this\noutbreak would be much larger. But it's now known one dose doesn't\nprotect everyone; MMR is now given in two doses. Nova Scotia is\nleaning heavily towards topping up those it considers susceptible to the virus.\n\"We are looking more seriously at instituting our vaccination\nprograms. An extra dose of MMR for the at-risk groups, which in this\ncase is 2: university students and health-care workers,\" Sarwal said.\nThe vaccination campaign likely can't be mounted quickly enough to\nstamp out this outbreak, but could help prevent additional epidemics, she said.\nThe incubation period for mumps is 12 to 25 days. University\ndormitories and crowded student apartments make for easy spread of\nthe virus among susceptible young adults.\n[Byline: Helen Branswell]\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail copy editor Ed Prucha <edprucha@midcoast.com>\n[These reports record a significant increase in number of mumps cases\namong students in the Maritime provinces of Canada; and more\nsignificantly, the geographical spread of the outbreak to Central\nCanada is noted.

Previously, officials\nin the province had said that any catch-up campaign -- designed to\ngive a 2nd dose of the combined measles, mumps and rubella vaccine to\nyoung adults who only received one in childhood -- would need to be\ndone in conjunction with other provinces and territories.\n\"Ideally, we'd have the whole country moving together. And we're\nstill working with the other provinces and with the Public Health\nAgency (of Canada),\" said Dr. Shelly Sarwal, a medical officer of\nhealth for the province. \"But, Nova Scotia's going to have to take\nsome steps to protect Nova Scotians.\"\nThis week, there was a significant jump in cases in Nova Scotia, to\n203 from 157, with mumps now being reported in all 9 health regions\nin the province. As of yesterday [4 May 2007], New Brunswick reported\n34 cases and Prince Edward Island remains at one confirmed case. For\nthe 1st time the outbreak has moved out of the Maritimes to Central\nCanada, a development public health officials had warned might occur\nas the university year ended and Halifax students dispersed to their\nhomes throughout the Maritimes and beyond.\nDavid Jensen, a spokesperson with Ontario's Ministry of Health and\nLong-term Care, said the province's 3 confirmed cases -- in the\nOttawa, York and Waterloo public health units -- can all be linked to\nthe Nova Scotia outbreak. Test results are still pending on 5\nsuspected cases. Jensen said physicians and public health officials\nin the province should keep mumps in mind if they see patients who\nhave mumps-like symptoms. These include aches, pains, fever, loss of\nappetite and, in about 40 percent of cases, the hugely swollen saliva\nglands that give mumps its characteristic chipmunk-cheek look.\nThe Nova Scotia outbreak, which began in the 3rd week of February\n[2007], is the province's 3rd in 2 years. It is by far the largest;\nthe earlier outbreaks, in 2005, involved 13 and 19 cases\nrespectively. It is fuelled by a pool of susceptible young adults.\nSarwal said authorities believe many of the province's cases were\nvaccinated with MMR [measles, mumps, rubella vaccine] in childhood,\nbut received only one dose. The one-dose schedule for the MMR vaccine\nwas adequate to protect many people. If it had not been, this\noutbreak would be much larger. But it's now known one dose doesn't\nprotect everyone; MMR is now given in two doses. Nova Scotia is\nleaning heavily towards topping up those it considers susceptible to the virus.\n\"We are looking more seriously at instituting our vaccination\nprograms. An extra dose of MMR for the at-risk groups, which in this\ncase is 2: university students and health-care workers,\" Sarwal said.\nThe vaccination campaign likely can't be mounted quickly enough to\nstamp out this outbreak, but could help prevent additional epidemics, she said.\nThe incubation period for mumps is 12 to 25 days. University\ndormitories and crowded student apartments make for easy spread of\nthe virus among susceptible young adults.\n[Byline: Helen Branswell]\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail copy editor Ed Prucha <edprucha@midcoast.com>\n[These reports record a significant increase in number of mumps cases\namong students in the Maritime provinces of Canada; and more\nsignificantly, the geographical spread of the outbreak to Central\nCanada is noted.

Previously, officials\nin the province had said that any catch-up campaign -- designed to\ngive a 2nd dose of the combined measles, mumps and rubella vaccine to\nyoung adults who only received one in childhood -- would need to be\ndone in conjunction with other provinces and territories.\n\"Ideally, we'd have the whole country moving together. And we're\nstill working with the other provinces and with the Public Health\nAgency (of Canada),\" said Dr. Shelly Sarwal, a medical officer of\nhealth for the province. \"But, Nova Scotia's going to have to take\nsome steps to protect Nova Scotians.\"\nThis week, there was a significant jump in cases in Nova Scotia, to\n203 from 157, with mumps now being reported in all 9 health regions\nin the province. As of yesterday [4 May 2007], New Brunswick reported\n34 cases and Prince Edward Island remains at one confirmed case. For\nthe 1st time the outbreak has moved out of the Maritimes to Central\nCanada, a development public health officials had warned might occur\nas the university year ended and Halifax students dispersed to their\nhomes throughout the Maritimes and beyond.\nDavid Jensen, a spokesperson with Ontario's Ministry of Health and\nLong-term Care, said the province's 3 confirmed cases -- in the\nOttawa, York and Waterloo public health units -- can all be linked to\nthe Nova Scotia outbreak. Test results are still pending on 5\nsuspected cases. Jensen said physicians and public health officials\nin the province should keep mumps in mind if they see patients who\nhave mumps-like symptoms. These include aches, pains, fever, loss of\nappetite and, in about 40 percent of cases, the hugely swollen saliva\nglands that give mumps its characteristic chipmunk-cheek look.\nThe Nova Scotia outbreak, which began in the 3rd week of February\n[2007], is the province's 3rd in 2 years. It is by far the largest;\nthe earlier outbreaks, in 2005, involved 13 and 19 cases\nrespectively. It is fuelled by a pool of susceptible young adults.\nSarwal said authorities believe many of the province's cases were\nvaccinated with MMR [measles, mumps, rubella vaccine] in childhood,\nbut received only one dose. The one-dose schedule for the MMR vaccine\nwas adequate to protect many people. If it had not been, this\noutbreak would be much larger. But it's now known one dose doesn't\nprotect everyone; MMR is now given in two doses. Nova Scotia is\nleaning heavily towards topping up those it considers susceptible to the virus.\n\"We are looking more seriously at instituting our vaccination\nprograms. An extra dose of MMR for the at-risk groups, which in this\ncase is 2: university students and health-care workers,\" Sarwal said.\nThe vaccination campaign likely can't be mounted quickly enough to\nstamp out this outbreak, but could help prevent additional epidemics, she said.\nThe incubation period for mumps is 12 to 25 days. University\ndormitories and crowded student apartments make for easy spread of\nthe virus among susceptible young adults.\n[Byline: Helen Branswell]\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail copy editor Ed Prucha <edprucha@midcoast.com>\n[These reports record a significant increase in number of mumps cases\namong students in the Maritime provinces of Canada; and more\nsignificantly, the geographical spread of the outbreak to Central\nCanada is noted.

Given that the original\nNova Scotia outbreak was largely focussed on college students, it is\nnot surprising that the disease has spread to other provinces as\nclasses have ended and students are travelling back to their home towns.\nCBS News reported in a Fri 4 May [2007] update that health officials\nare considering a re-vaccination campaign for mumps. The province of\nNova Scotia and the Public Health Agency of Canada are looking at\nre-immunizing people against mumps.\nNova Scotia has experienced 203 cases of mumps since February [2007],\nincluding about 50 new cases that have surfaced since last week\n[23-27 Apr 2007], public health officials said on Fri 4 May 2007. New\nBrunswick and Prince Edward Island have also reported cases, mainly\namong young adults in their 20s. Half a dozen cases of mumps have\nspread as far as Ontario.\nMumps is a highly infectious disease that is spread by coughing,\nsneezing, sharing drinks or kissing. Many of the cases spread through\ndowntown bars in Halifax and on the campus of Dalhousie University,\nhealth officials said.\nSince exams wrapped up about 2 weeks ago [20 Apr 2007], most students\nhave left campus and the disease seems to be receding, said Marla\nCranston, a Dalhousie spokeswoman. The province is talking about a\nnew immunization program for university-aged students and health-care\nworkers, said Dr. Shelly Sarwal, a medical officer of health with the\nNova Scotia health department. \"Right now, we're going to start\ndiscussion with the universities and the district health authorities\nto figure out how to make this happen,\" Sarwal said, adding plans\nshould be in place by next week [7-11 May 2007].\n--\nCommunicated by:\nDavid N.

Previously, officials\nin the province had said that any catch-up campaign -- designed to\ngive a 2nd dose of the combined measles, mumps and rubella vaccine to\nyoung adults who only received one in childhood -- would need to be\ndone in conjunction with other provinces and territories.\n\"Ideally, we'd have the whole country moving together. And we're\nstill working with the other provinces and with the Public Health\nAgency (of Canada),\" said Dr. Shelly Sarwal, a medical officer of\nhealth for the province. \"But, Nova Scotia's going to have to take\nsome steps to protect Nova Scotians.\"\nThis week, there was a significant jump in cases in Nova Scotia, to\n203 from 157, with mumps now being reported in all 9 health regions\nin the province. As of yesterday [4 May 2007], New Brunswick reported\n34 cases and Prince Edward Island remains at one confirmed case. For\nthe 1st time the outbreak has moved out of the Maritimes to Central\nCanada, a development public health officials had warned might occur\nas the university year ended and Halifax students dispersed to their\nhomes throughout the Maritimes and beyond.\nDavid Jensen, a spokesperson with Ontario's Ministry of Health and\nLong-term Care, said the province's 3 confirmed cases -- in the\nOttawa, York and Waterloo public health units -- can all be linked to\nthe Nova Scotia outbreak. Test results are still pending on 5\nsuspected cases. Jensen said physicians and public health officials\nin the province should keep mumps in mind if they see patients who\nhave mumps-like symptoms. These include aches, pains, fever, loss of\nappetite and, in about 40 percent of cases, the hugely swollen saliva\nglands that give mumps its characteristic chipmunk-cheek look.\nThe Nova Scotia outbreak, which began in the 3rd week of February\n[2007], is the province's 3rd in 2 years. It is by far the largest;\nthe earlier outbreaks, in 2005, involved 13 and 19 cases\nrespectively. It is fuelled by a pool of susceptible young adults.\nSarwal said authorities believe many of the province's cases were\nvaccinated with MMR [measles, mumps, rubella vaccine] in childhood,\nbut received only one dose. The one-dose schedule for the MMR vaccine\nwas adequate to protect many people. If it had not been, this\noutbreak would be much larger. But it's now known one dose doesn't\nprotect everyone; MMR is now given in two doses. Nova Scotia is\nleaning heavily towards topping up those it considers susceptible to the virus.\n\"We are looking more seriously at instituting our vaccination\nprograms. An extra dose of MMR for the at-risk groups, which in this\ncase is 2: university students and health-care workers,\" Sarwal said.\nThe vaccination campaign likely can't be mounted quickly enough to\nstamp out this outbreak, but could help prevent additional epidemics, she said.\nThe incubation period for mumps is 12 to 25 days. University\ndormitories and crowded student apartments make for easy spread of\nthe virus among susceptible young adults.\n[Byline: Helen Branswell]\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail copy editor Ed Prucha <edprucha@midcoast.com>\n[These reports record a significant increase in number of mumps cases\namong students in the Maritime provinces of Canada; and more\nsignificantly, the geographical spread of the outbreak to Central\nCanada is noted.

This number includes\nlaboratory-confirmed and probable epidemiologically-linked clinical\ncases in line with the EU case definition and case classification\nthat have been adopted for mumps surveillance purposes in Bulgaria\nsince 2005 [1].\nFor comparison, only 22 cases were reported in the 1st 11 weeks of\n2005, and 311 cases were registered in the same period in 2006.\nAltogether, 608 cases were notified in 2005, and 919 cases were\nreported during 2006. An increase of the number of reported cases was\nnoted already in 2006, and since the beginning of 2007, the number of\ncases has continued to rise. [The text at this point is supplemented\nby a figure plotting reported mumps cases during weeks 1 to 11 in\n2005 (n=22), 2006 (n=311) and 2007 (n=997)].\nThe present mumps epidemic affects mostly teenagers and young adults.\nMore than 60 percent of the cases reported in 2007 occurred in\npatients aged 15 to 19 years, and about 20 percent in patients aged\n20 to 24 years. To date, 112 out of 997 cases (11.2 percent) have\nbeen laboratory-confirmed.\nConclusion\n----------\nThe outbreak investigation is still ongoing, but preliminary data\nindicate that the predominance of patients in age groups 15-19 and\n20-24 years may be a result of poor immunisation of these birth\ncohorts in general. About 1/3rd of patients aged 15 to 19 years have\nnot been vaccinated at all, whereas more than half have received only\none dose of monovalent mumps vaccine strain Leningrad 3, which has\nbeen shown to have a lower effectiveness [2]. Among the 20- to\n24-year-old patients, over 90 percent have never been immunised against mumps.\nVaccination against mumps in Bulgaria started in 1972, and a routine\nmumps immunisation program was launched in 1976. However, different\nvaccine strains and vaccines have been used, and different\nimmunisation strategies implemented, including a suspension of mumps\nimmunisation for almost 4 years during the period 1982 to 1986.\nDue to the past changes in the immunisation program and occasionally\nincomplete immunisation coverage, the conditions in which outbreaks\ncan occur still exist, despite the current up-to-date mumps\nimmunisation strategy.\nControl measures\n----------------\nA risk assessment carried out following the outbreak concluded that\nbirth cohorts 1982 to 1992 that are at higher risk of mumps infection\nshould be offered supplementary mumps immunisation.\nAs a result, the Bulgarian Ministry of Health decided to provide\nsupplementary doses of MMR vaccine and to conduct immunisation\ncampaigns targeted at these cohorts. In early March 2007, the\nMinistry of Health organized a meeting to inform regional\nepidemiologists about the situation and to discuss with them the need\nfor strengthening disease surveillance and undertaking control\nmeasures to prevent further spread of mumps. Furthermore,\ncommunication aimed at the general public, conveying information\nabout the risks related to mumps infection and the preventive\nmeasures, including immunisation, has been intensified through the\nparticipation of national experts in a series of briefings, TV and\nradio broadcasts.\nA longer article on the epidemiology of mumps in Bulgaria, including\na detailed risk assessment, is planned for publication in the monthly\nrelease of Eurosurveillance.\nReferences\n----------\n(1.)

This number includes\nlaboratory-confirmed and probable epidemiologically-linked clinical\ncases in line with the EU case definition and case classification\nthat have been adopted for mumps surveillance purposes in Bulgaria\nsince 2005 [1].\nFor comparison, only 22 cases were reported in the 1st 11 weeks of\n2005, and 311 cases were registered in the same period in 2006.\nAltogether, 608 cases were notified in 2005, and 919 cases were\nreported during 2006. An increase of the number of reported cases was\nnoted already in 2006, and since the beginning of 2007, the number of\ncases has continued to rise. [The text at this point is supplemented\nby a figure plotting reported mumps cases during weeks 1 to 11 in\n2005 (n=22), 2006 (n=311) and 2007 (n=997)].\nThe present mumps epidemic affects mostly teenagers and young adults.\nMore than 60 percent of the cases reported in 2007 occurred in\npatients aged 15 to 19 years, and about 20 percent in patients aged\n20 to 24 years. To date, 112 out of 997 cases (11.2 percent) have\nbeen laboratory-confirmed.\nConclusion\n----------\nThe outbreak investigation is still ongoing, but preliminary data\nindicate that the predominance of patients in age groups 15-19 and\n20-24 years may be a result of poor immunisation of these birth\ncohorts in general. About 1/3rd of patients aged 15 to 19 years have\nnot been vaccinated at all, whereas more than half have received only\none dose of monovalent mumps vaccine strain Leningrad 3, which has\nbeen shown to have a lower effectiveness [2]. Among the 20- to\n24-year-old patients, over 90 percent have never been immunised against mumps.\nVaccination against mumps in Bulgaria started in 1972, and a routine\nmumps immunisation program was launched in 1976. However, different\nvaccine strains and vaccines have been used, and different\nimmunisation strategies implemented, including a suspension of mumps\nimmunisation for almost 4 years during the period 1982 to 1986.\nDue to the past changes in the immunisation program and occasionally\nincomplete immunisation coverage, the conditions in which outbreaks\ncan occur still exist, despite the current up-to-date mumps\nimmunisation strategy.\nControl measures\n----------------\nA risk assessment carried out following the outbreak concluded that\nbirth cohorts 1982 to 1992 that are at higher risk of mumps infection\nshould be offered supplementary mumps immunisation.\nAs a result, the Bulgarian Ministry of Health decided to provide\nsupplementary doses of MMR vaccine and to conduct immunisation\ncampaigns targeted at these cohorts. In early March 2007, the\nMinistry of Health organized a meeting to inform regional\nepidemiologists about the situation and to discuss with them the need\nfor strengthening disease surveillance and undertaking control\nmeasures to prevent further spread of mumps. Furthermore,\ncommunication aimed at the general public, conveying information\nabout the risks related to mumps infection and the preventive\nmeasures, including immunisation, has been intensified through the\nparticipation of national experts in a series of briefings, TV and\nradio broadcasts.\nA longer article on the epidemiology of mumps in Bulgaria, including\na detailed risk assessment, is planned for publication in the monthly\nrelease of Eurosurveillance.\nReferences\n----------\n(1.)

This number includes\nlaboratory-confirmed and probable epidemiologically-linked clinical\ncases in line with the EU case definition and case classification\nthat have been adopted for mumps surveillance purposes in Bulgaria\nsince 2005 [1].\nFor comparison, only 22 cases were reported in the 1st 11 weeks of\n2005, and 311 cases were registered in the same period in 2006.\nAltogether, 608 cases were notified in 2005, and 919 cases were\nreported during 2006. An increase of the number of reported cases was\nnoted already in 2006, and since the beginning of 2007, the number of\ncases has continued to rise. [The text at this point is supplemented\nby a figure plotting reported mumps cases during weeks 1 to 11 in\n2005 (n=22), 2006 (n=311) and 2007 (n=997)].\nThe present mumps epidemic affects mostly teenagers and young adults.\nMore than 60 percent of the cases reported in 2007 occurred in\npatients aged 15 to 19 years, and about 20 percent in patients aged\n20 to 24 years. To date, 112 out of 997 cases (11.2 percent) have\nbeen laboratory-confirmed.\nConclusion\n----------\nThe outbreak investigation is still ongoing, but preliminary data\nindicate that the predominance of patients in age groups 15-19 and\n20-24 years may be a result of poor immunisation of these birth\ncohorts in general. About 1/3rd of patients aged 15 to 19 years have\nnot been vaccinated at all, whereas more than half have received only\none dose of monovalent mumps vaccine strain Leningrad 3, which has\nbeen shown to have a lower effectiveness [2]. Among the 20- to\n24-year-old patients, over 90 percent have never been immunised against mumps.\nVaccination against mumps in Bulgaria started in 1972, and a routine\nmumps immunisation program was launched in 1976. However, different\nvaccine strains and vaccines have been used, and different\nimmunisation strategies implemented, including a suspension of mumps\nimmunisation for almost 4 years during the period 1982 to 1986.\nDue to the past changes in the immunisation program and occasionally\nincomplete immunisation coverage, the conditions in which outbreaks\ncan occur still exist, despite the current up-to-date mumps\nimmunisation strategy.\nControl measures\n----------------\nA risk assessment carried out following the outbreak concluded that\nbirth cohorts 1982 to 1992 that are at higher risk of mumps infection\nshould be offered supplementary mumps immunisation.\nAs a result, the Bulgarian Ministry of Health decided to provide\nsupplementary doses of MMR vaccine and to conduct immunisation\ncampaigns targeted at these cohorts. In early March 2007, the\nMinistry of Health organized a meeting to inform regional\nepidemiologists about the situation and to discuss with them the need\nfor strengthening disease surveillance and undertaking control\nmeasures to prevent further spread of mumps. Furthermore,\ncommunication aimed at the general public, conveying information\nabout the risks related to mumps infection and the preventive\nmeasures, including immunisation, has been intensified through the\nparticipation of national experts in a series of briefings, TV and\nradio broadcasts.\nA longer article on the epidemiology of mumps in Bulgaria, including\na detailed risk assessment, is planned for publication in the monthly\nrelease of Eurosurveillance.\nReferences\n----------\n(1.)

For the Suva area, there have\nbeen anecdotal reports of increasing number of mump cases occurring\nin various schools in Suva for the past 2 months.\n\"Labasa Hospital has [had] an average of 120 cases for the past 12\nmonths. Lautoka Hospital reported about 30 cases in total for the\npast 2 months, and the Suva Private Hospital reported 15 cases last\nmonth [August 2006],\" he said.\nHe said the reported mumps cases were based solely on clinical\nsymptoms of the patients since no blood test had been sent to Suva\nfor laboratory confirmation.\nDr. Samuela said mumps was the commonest cause of painful and swollen\nsalivary glands. \"The most prominent symptoms are the presence of\npainful swelling or lumps at the angle of the jaw. These swellings of\nthe salivary glands could be on one or both sides. Associated\nsymptoms include body aches, loss of appetite, generalized weakness,\nheadache and low grade fever,\" he said. He said that panadol was a\nsuitable and effective medicine for both fever and pain relief and\nthat soft food should be given to the affected child, as chewing made\nthe pain worse.\nDr. Samuela said the child infected with mumps should be stopped from\ngoing to school until symptoms subside.\nLast week, Fiji College of General Practitioners president Doctor\nWahid Khan said children suffering from mumps should be allowed a lot\nof bed rest and not sent to school. He said that more than 50\npatients had visited his general practice seeking treatment for mumps\nand that proper care should be taken by the parents on the issue.\n\"If there are more than one child living in a household whose member\nhas the virus, the sick child's utensils should be kept separately\nfrom the rest of the family, because it is a contagious disease that\ncould be passed easily from one member to another,\" he said.\nHe said children suffering from mumps should wear warm clothing and\ndrink a lot of fluids with paracetamol, panadeine and codeine.\n\"I have seen some boys who come with mumps and complain of pain in\nthe scrotum, and this was not good, so extra care should be taken at\nall times,\" he said.\nHe said those infected with mumps should not be given orange or any\ncitrus drink to take while being infected because it could worsen the pain.\nMeanwhile, Health Ministry chief executive officer Doctor Lepani\nWaqatakirewa said the current outbreak was viral in origin and\nantibiotics such as amoxycillin are for bacterial infections.\nIn a statement reacting to the current outbreak of mumps among\nchildren, Dr. Waqatakirewa said virus and bacteria were different and\ngiving antibiotics for viral infection was a waste of medicine.\nSome parents had shown concern that their children with virus-related\ninfectious were in fact given antibiotics.\n\"However, do note that in some children, there could be co-exiting\nbacterial infection in the chest or elsewhere in the body. In such\ncases, antibiotics such as amoxycillin could be prescribed,\" he said.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[This is the 1st ProMED report of mumps in Fiji and the 2nd in\nSoutheast Asia.

These swellings of\nthe salivary glands could be on one or both sides. Associated\nsymptoms include body aches, loss of appetite, generalized weakness,\nheadache and low grade fever,\" he said.

As of 10 Apr 2006, a total of 515\npossible mumps cases have been reported to the Iowa Department of\nPublic Health (IDPH) during 2006 (2). This outbreak has spread across\nIowa, and mumps activity, possibly linked to the Iowa outbreak, is\nunder investigation in 6 neighboring states, including Illinois (n =\n4), Kansas (n = 33), Minnesota (n = one), Missouri (n = 4), Nebraska\n(n = 43), and Wisconsin (n = 4) (CDC, unpublished data, 10 Apr 2006).\nThe reasons for this outbreak are under investigation.\nMumps is an acute viral infection characterized by a nonspecific\nprodrome, including myalgia, anorexia, malaise, headache, and fever,\nfollowed by acute onset of unilateral or bilateral tender swelling of\nparotid or other salivary glands (2). An estimated 60 percent to 70\npercent of mumps infections produce typical acute parotitis (3).\nApproximately 20 percent of infections are asymptomatic, and nearly\n50 percent are associated with nonspecific or primarily respiratory\nsymptoms. Complications include orchitis, oophoritis, or mastitis\n(inflammation of the testicles, ovaries, or breasts, respectively),\nmeningitis/encephalitis, spontaneous abortion, and deafness.\nTransmission occurs by direct contact with respiratory droplets or\nsaliva. The incubation period is 14-18 days (range: 14-25 days) from\nexposure to onset of symptoms. The infectious period is from 3 days\nbefore symptom onset until 9 days after onset of symptoms.\nIDPH has identified 2 persons who had mumps diagnosed and were\npotentially infectious during travel on 9 different commercial\nflights involving 2 airlines during 26 Mar-2 Apr 2006. The commercial\nairline flights identified with a potentially infectious traveler are\nlisted below by date, carrier, and flight number:\nNorthwest Airline (NWA) flights:\n26 Mar 2006 - NWA (Mesaba) #3025 from Waterloo, Iowa to Minneapolis, Minnesota\n26 Mar 2006 - NWA #760 from Minneapolis, Minnesota, to Detroit, Michigan\n27 Mar 2006 - NWA #0260 from Detroit, Michigan, to Washington,\nDC--Reagan National\n29 Mar 2006 - NWA #1705 from Washington, DC--Reagan National to\nMinneapolis, Minnesota\n29 Mar 2006 - NWA (Mesaba) #3026 from Minneapolis, Minnesota, to Waterloo, Iowa\nAmerican Airlines (AA) flights:\n2 Apr 2006 - AA #1216 from Tucson, Arizona, to Dallas, Texas (DFW)\n2 Apr 2006 - AA #3617 from DFW to Lafayette, Arkansas (Northwest\nArkansas Regional [NAR])\n2 Apr 2006 - AA #5399 from NAR to St. Louis, Missouri\n2 Apr 2006 - AA #5498 from St. Louis, Missouri, to Cedar Rapids, Iowa\nPersons on these flights who have symptoms consistent with mumps\nwithin 21 days of travel should be evaluated for mumps by an\nhealth-care provider. Health-care providers should remain vigilant\nfor mumps among persons with parotitis or other salivary gland\ninflammation. Cases of suspected mumps should be reported immediately\nto public health officials.\nA multistate investigation has been initiated by CDC and the state\nhealth departments in affected states to notify potentially exposed\npassengers (i.e., those seated in close proximity to the index\ncases). This investigation is using a new software application,\neManifest, developed by the CDC Division of Global Migration and\nQuarantine (DGMQ) to securely import, sort, and assign\npassenger-locating information to jurisdictions to facilitate timely\nidentification of exposed persons. These data are securely\ntransmitted to state and territorial health departments via the\nEpidemic Information Exchange (Epi-X) Forum (available at\n<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/epix/epix.html>) for notification of\npotentially exposed passengers.\nIncidence of mumps in the United States began to decrease after\nvaccine introduction in 1967 and recommendations for routine\nvaccination of children in 1977. Since the 1990s, a further decrease\nin the reported incidence of mumps has occurred, which is thought to\nbe attributable to the implementation of the 2nd dose of measles,\nmumps, and rubella vaccine (3). The risk for transmission of\nrespiratory infectious diseases during air travel might depend on\nseveral factors, including 1) immunity of passengers; 2)\ninfectiousness of the organism; 3) degree of shedding of the pathogen\nby infected passengers; 4) hygienic practices of infectious\npassengers; 5) proximity of others to infectious passengers; 6)\nhygienic practices of the other passengers/crew; 7) flight duration;\nand 8) cabin environment of the aircraft (4). Transmission of other\nrespiratory pathogens during air travel has been reported (5-9).\nExposure and transmission of mumps during commercial air travel has\nnot been described previously.\n[Reported by: P Quinlisk, MD, Iowa Dept of Public Health.

As of 10 Apr 2006, a total of 515\npossible mumps cases have been reported to the Iowa Department of\nPublic Health (IDPH) during 2006 (2). This outbreak has spread across\nIowa, and mumps activity, possibly linked to the Iowa outbreak, is\nunder investigation in 6 neighboring states, including Illinois (n =\n4), Kansas (n = 33), Minnesota (n = one), Missouri (n = 4), Nebraska\n(n = 43), and Wisconsin (n = 4) (CDC, unpublished data, 10 Apr 2006).\nThe reasons for this outbreak are under investigation.\nMumps is an acute viral infection characterized by a nonspecific\nprodrome, including myalgia, anorexia, malaise, headache, and fever,\nfollowed by acute onset of unilateral or bilateral tender swelling of\nparotid or other salivary glands (2). An estimated 60 percent to 70\npercent of mumps infections produce typical acute parotitis (3).\nApproximately 20 percent of infections are asymptomatic, and nearly\n50 percent are associated with nonspecific or primarily respiratory\nsymptoms. Complications include orchitis, oophoritis, or mastitis\n(inflammation of the testicles, ovaries, or breasts, respectively),\nmeningitis/encephalitis, spontaneous abortion, and deafness.\nTransmission occurs by direct contact with respiratory droplets or\nsaliva. The incubation period is 14-18 days (range: 14-25 days) from\nexposure to onset of symptoms. The infectious period is from 3 days\nbefore symptom onset until 9 days after onset of symptoms.\nIDPH has identified 2 persons who had mumps diagnosed and were\npotentially infectious during travel on 9 different commercial\nflights involving 2 airlines during 26 Mar-2 Apr 2006. The commercial\nairline flights identified with a potentially infectious traveler are\nlisted below by date, carrier, and flight number:\nNorthwest Airline (NWA) flights:\n26 Mar 2006 - NWA (Mesaba) #3025 from Waterloo, Iowa to Minneapolis, Minnesota\n26 Mar 2006 - NWA #760 from Minneapolis, Minnesota, to Detroit, Michigan\n27 Mar 2006 - NWA #0260 from Detroit, Michigan, to Washington,\nDC--Reagan National\n29 Mar 2006 - NWA #1705 from Washington, DC--Reagan National to\nMinneapolis, Minnesota\n29 Mar 2006 - NWA (Mesaba) #3026 from Minneapolis, Minnesota, to Waterloo, Iowa\nAmerican Airlines (AA) flights:\n2 Apr 2006 - AA #1216 from Tucson, Arizona, to Dallas, Texas (DFW)\n2 Apr 2006 - AA #3617 from DFW to Lafayette, Arkansas (Northwest\nArkansas Regional [NAR])\n2 Apr 2006 - AA #5399 from NAR to St. Louis, Missouri\n2 Apr 2006 - AA #5498 from St. Louis, Missouri, to Cedar Rapids, Iowa\nPersons on these flights who have symptoms consistent with mumps\nwithin 21 days of travel should be evaluated for mumps by an\nhealth-care provider. Health-care providers should remain vigilant\nfor mumps among persons with parotitis or other salivary gland\ninflammation. Cases of suspected mumps should be reported immediately\nto public health officials.\nA multistate investigation has been initiated by CDC and the state\nhealth departments in affected states to notify potentially exposed\npassengers (i.e., those seated in close proximity to the index\ncases). This investigation is using a new software application,\neManifest, developed by the CDC Division of Global Migration and\nQuarantine (DGMQ) to securely import, sort, and assign\npassenger-locating information to jurisdictions to facilitate timely\nidentification of exposed persons. These data are securely\ntransmitted to state and territorial health departments via the\nEpidemic Information Exchange (Epi-X) Forum (available at\n<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/epix/epix.html>) for notification of\npotentially exposed passengers.\nIncidence of mumps in the United States began to decrease after\nvaccine introduction in 1967 and recommendations for routine\nvaccination of children in 1977. Since the 1990s, a further decrease\nin the reported incidence of mumps has occurred, which is thought to\nbe attributable to the implementation of the 2nd dose of measles,\nmumps, and rubella vaccine (3). The risk for transmission of\nrespiratory infectious diseases during air travel might depend on\nseveral factors, including 1) immunity of passengers; 2)\ninfectiousness of the organism; 3) degree of shedding of the pathogen\nby infected passengers; 4) hygienic practices of infectious\npassengers; 5) proximity of others to infectious passengers; 6)\nhygienic practices of the other passengers/crew; 7) flight duration;\nand 8) cabin environment of the aircraft (4). Transmission of other\nrespiratory pathogens during air travel has been reported (5-9).\nExposure and transmission of mumps during commercial air travel has\nnot been described previously.\n[Reported by: P Quinlisk, MD, Iowa Dept of Public Health.

As of 10 Apr 2006, a total of 515\npossible mumps cases have been reported to the Iowa Department of\nPublic Health (IDPH) during 2006 (2). This outbreak has spread across\nIowa, and mumps activity, possibly linked to the Iowa outbreak, is\nunder investigation in 6 neighboring states, including Illinois (n =\n4), Kansas (n = 33), Minnesota (n = one), Missouri (n = 4), Nebraska\n(n = 43), and Wisconsin (n = 4) (CDC, unpublished data, 10 Apr 2006).\nThe reasons for this outbreak are under investigation.\nMumps is an acute viral infection characterized by a nonspecific\nprodrome, including myalgia, anorexia, malaise, headache, and fever,\nfollowed by acute onset of unilateral or bilateral tender swelling of\nparotid or other salivary glands (2). An estimated 60 percent to 70\npercent of mumps infections produce typical acute parotitis (3).\nApproximately 20 percent of infections are asymptomatic, and nearly\n50 percent are associated with nonspecific or primarily respiratory\nsymptoms. Complications include orchitis, oophoritis, or mastitis\n(inflammation of the testicles, ovaries, or breasts, respectively),\nmeningitis/encephalitis, spontaneous abortion, and deafness.\nTransmission occurs by direct contact with respiratory droplets or\nsaliva. The incubation period is 14-18 days (range: 14-25 days) from\nexposure to onset of symptoms. The infectious period is from 3 days\nbefore symptom onset until 9 days after onset of symptoms.\nIDPH has identified 2 persons who had mumps diagnosed and were\npotentially infectious during travel on 9 different commercial\nflights involving 2 airlines during 26 Mar-2 Apr 2006. The commercial\nairline flights identified with a potentially infectious traveler are\nlisted below by date, carrier, and flight number:\nNorthwest Airline (NWA) flights:\n26 Mar 2006 - NWA (Mesaba) #3025 from Waterloo, Iowa to Minneapolis, Minnesota\n26 Mar 2006 - NWA #760 from Minneapolis, Minnesota, to Detroit, Michigan\n27 Mar 2006 - NWA #0260 from Detroit, Michigan, to Washington,\nDC--Reagan National\n29 Mar 2006 - NWA #1705 from Washington, DC--Reagan National to\nMinneapolis, Minnesota\n29 Mar 2006 - NWA (Mesaba) #3026 from Minneapolis, Minnesota, to Waterloo, Iowa\nAmerican Airlines (AA) flights:\n2 Apr 2006 - AA #1216 from Tucson, Arizona, to Dallas, Texas (DFW)\n2 Apr 2006 - AA #3617 from DFW to Lafayette, Arkansas (Northwest\nArkansas Regional [NAR])\n2 Apr 2006 - AA #5399 from NAR to St. Louis, Missouri\n2 Apr 2006 - AA #5498 from St. Louis, Missouri, to Cedar Rapids, Iowa\nPersons on these flights who have symptoms consistent with mumps\nwithin 21 days of travel should be evaluated for mumps by an\nhealth-care provider. Health-care providers should remain vigilant\nfor mumps among persons with parotitis or other salivary gland\ninflammation. Cases of suspected mumps should be reported immediately\nto public health officials.\nA multistate investigation has been initiated by CDC and the state\nhealth departments in affected states to notify potentially exposed\npassengers (i.e., those seated in close proximity to the index\ncases). This investigation is using a new software application,\neManifest, developed by the CDC Division of Global Migration and\nQuarantine (DGMQ) to securely import, sort, and assign\npassenger-locating information to jurisdictions to facilitate timely\nidentification of exposed persons. These data are securely\ntransmitted to state and territorial health departments via the\nEpidemic Information Exchange (Epi-X) Forum (available at\n<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/epix/epix.html>) for notification of\npotentially exposed passengers.\nIncidence of mumps in the United States began to decrease after\nvaccine introduction in 1967 and recommendations for routine\nvaccination of children in 1977. Since the 1990s, a further decrease\nin the reported incidence of mumps has occurred, which is thought to\nbe attributable to the implementation of the 2nd dose of measles,\nmumps, and rubella vaccine (3). The risk for transmission of\nrespiratory infectious diseases during air travel might depend on\nseveral factors, including 1) immunity of passengers; 2)\ninfectiousness of the organism; 3) degree of shedding of the pathogen\nby infected passengers; 4) hygienic practices of infectious\npassengers; 5) proximity of others to infectious passengers; 6)\nhygienic practices of the other passengers/crew; 7) flight duration;\nand 8) cabin environment of the aircraft (4). Transmission of other\nrespiratory pathogens during air travel has been reported (5-9).\nExposure and transmission of mumps during commercial air travel has\nnot been described previously.\n[Reported by: P Quinlisk, MD, Iowa Dept of Public Health.

As of 10 Apr 2006, a total of 515\npossible mumps cases have been reported to the Iowa Department of\nPublic Health (IDPH) during 2006 (2). This outbreak has spread across\nIowa, and mumps activity, possibly linked to the Iowa outbreak, is\nunder investigation in 6 neighboring states, including Illinois (n =\n4), Kansas (n = 33), Minnesota (n = one), Missouri (n = 4), Nebraska\n(n = 43), and Wisconsin (n = 4) (CDC, unpublished data, 10 Apr 2006).\nThe reasons for this outbreak are under investigation.\nMumps is an acute viral infection characterized by a nonspecific\nprodrome, including myalgia, anorexia, malaise, headache, and fever,\nfollowed by acute onset of unilateral or bilateral tender swelling of\nparotid or other salivary glands (2). An estimated 60 percent to 70\npercent of mumps infections produce typical acute parotitis (3).\nApproximately 20 percent of infections are asymptomatic, and nearly\n50 percent are associated with nonspecific or primarily respiratory\nsymptoms. Complications include orchitis, oophoritis, or mastitis\n(inflammation of the testicles, ovaries, or breasts, respectively),\nmeningitis/encephalitis, spontaneous abortion, and deafness.\nTransmission occurs by direct contact with respiratory droplets or\nsaliva. The incubation period is 14-18 days (range: 14-25 days) from\nexposure to onset of symptoms. The infectious period is from 3 days\nbefore symptom onset until 9 days after onset of symptoms.\nIDPH has identified 2 persons who had mumps diagnosed and were\npotentially infectious during travel on 9 different commercial\nflights involving 2 airlines during 26 Mar-2 Apr 2006. The commercial\nairline flights identified with a potentially infectious traveler are\nlisted below by date, carrier, and flight number:\nNorthwest Airline (NWA) flights:\n26 Mar 2006 - NWA (Mesaba) #3025 from Waterloo, Iowa to Minneapolis, Minnesota\n26 Mar 2006 - NWA #760 from Minneapolis, Minnesota, to Detroit, Michigan\n27 Mar 2006 - NWA #0260 from Detroit, Michigan, to Washington,\nDC--Reagan National\n29 Mar 2006 - NWA #1705 from Washington, DC--Reagan National to\nMinneapolis, Minnesota\n29 Mar 2006 - NWA (Mesaba) #3026 from Minneapolis, Minnesota, to Waterloo, Iowa\nAmerican Airlines (AA) flights:\n2 Apr 2006 - AA #1216 from Tucson, Arizona, to Dallas, Texas (DFW)\n2 Apr 2006 - AA #3617 from DFW to Lafayette, Arkansas (Northwest\nArkansas Regional [NAR])\n2 Apr 2006 - AA #5399 from NAR to St. Louis, Missouri\n2 Apr 2006 - AA #5498 from St. Louis, Missouri, to Cedar Rapids, Iowa\nPersons on these flights who have symptoms consistent with mumps\nwithin 21 days of travel should be evaluated for mumps by an\nhealth-care provider. Health-care providers should remain vigilant\nfor mumps among persons with parotitis or other salivary gland\ninflammation. Cases of suspected mumps should be reported immediately\nto public health officials.\nA multistate investigation has been initiated by CDC and the state\nhealth departments in affected states to notify potentially exposed\npassengers (i.e., those seated in close proximity to the index\ncases). This investigation is using a new software application,\neManifest, developed by the CDC Division of Global Migration and\nQuarantine (DGMQ) to securely import, sort, and assign\npassenger-locating information to jurisdictions to facilitate timely\nidentification of exposed persons. These data are securely\ntransmitted to state and territorial health departments via the\nEpidemic Information Exchange (Epi-X) Forum (available at\n<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/epix/epix.html>) for notification of\npotentially exposed passengers.\nIncidence of mumps in the United States began to decrease after\nvaccine introduction in 1967 and recommendations for routine\nvaccination of children in 1977. Since the 1990s, a further decrease\nin the reported incidence of mumps has occurred, which is thought to\nbe attributable to the implementation of the 2nd dose of measles,\nmumps, and rubella vaccine (3). The risk for transmission of\nrespiratory infectious diseases during air travel might depend on\nseveral factors, including 1) immunity of passengers; 2)\ninfectiousness of the organism; 3) degree of shedding of the pathogen\nby infected passengers; 4) hygienic practices of infectious\npassengers; 5) proximity of others to infectious passengers; 6)\nhygienic practices of the other passengers/crew; 7) flight duration;\nand 8) cabin environment of the aircraft (4). Transmission of other\nrespiratory pathogens during air travel has been reported (5-9).\nExposure and transmission of mumps during commercial air travel has\nnot been described previously.\n[Reported by: P Quinlisk, MD, Iowa Dept of Public Health.

As of 10 Apr 2006, a total of 515\npossible mumps cases have been reported to the Iowa Department of\nPublic Health (IDPH) during 2006 (2). This outbreak has spread across\nIowa, and mumps activity, possibly linked to the Iowa outbreak, is\nunder investigation in 6 neighboring states, including Illinois (n =\n4), Kansas (n = 33), Minnesota (n = one), Missouri (n = 4), Nebraska\n(n = 43), and Wisconsin (n = 4) (CDC, unpublished data, 10 Apr 2006).\nThe reasons for this outbreak are under investigation.\nMumps is an acute viral infection characterized by a nonspecific\nprodrome, including myalgia, anorexia, malaise, headache, and fever,\nfollowed by acute onset of unilateral or bilateral tender swelling of\nparotid or other salivary glands (2). An estimated 60 percent to 70\npercent of mumps infections produce typical acute parotitis (3).\nApproximately 20 percent of infections are asymptomatic, and nearly\n50 percent are associated with nonspecific or primarily respiratory\nsymptoms. Complications include orchitis, oophoritis, or mastitis\n(inflammation of the testicles, ovaries, or breasts, respectively),\nmeningitis/encephalitis, spontaneous abortion, and deafness.\nTransmission occurs by direct contact with respiratory droplets or\nsaliva. The incubation period is 14-18 days (range: 14-25 days) from\nexposure to onset of symptoms. The infectious period is from 3 days\nbefore symptom onset until 9 days after onset of symptoms.\nIDPH has identified 2 persons who had mumps diagnosed and were\npotentially infectious during travel on 9 different commercial\nflights involving 2 airlines during 26 Mar-2 Apr 2006. The commercial\nairline flights identified with a potentially infectious traveler are\nlisted below by date, carrier, and flight number:\nNorthwest Airline (NWA) flights:\n26 Mar 2006 - NWA (Mesaba) #3025 from Waterloo, Iowa to Minneapolis, Minnesota\n26 Mar 2006 - NWA #760 from Minneapolis, Minnesota, to Detroit, Michigan\n27 Mar 2006 - NWA #0260 from Detroit, Michigan, to Washington,\nDC--Reagan National\n29 Mar 2006 - NWA #1705 from Washington, DC--Reagan National to\nMinneapolis, Minnesota\n29 Mar 2006 - NWA (Mesaba) #3026 from Minneapolis, Minnesota, to Waterloo, Iowa\nAmerican Airlines (AA) flights:\n2 Apr 2006 - AA #1216 from Tucson, Arizona, to Dallas, Texas (DFW)\n2 Apr 2006 - AA #3617 from DFW to Lafayette, Arkansas (Northwest\nArkansas Regional [NAR])\n2 Apr 2006 - AA #5399 from NAR to St. Louis, Missouri\n2 Apr 2006 - AA #5498 from St. Louis, Missouri, to Cedar Rapids, Iowa\nPersons on these flights who have symptoms consistent with mumps\nwithin 21 days of travel should be evaluated for mumps by an\nhealth-care provider. Health-care providers should remain vigilant\nfor mumps among persons with parotitis or other salivary gland\ninflammation. Cases of suspected mumps should be reported immediately\nto public health officials.\nA multistate investigation has been initiated by CDC and the state\nhealth departments in affected states to notify potentially exposed\npassengers (i.e., those seated in close proximity to the index\ncases). This investigation is using a new software application,\neManifest, developed by the CDC Division of Global Migration and\nQuarantine (DGMQ) to securely import, sort, and assign\npassenger-locating information to jurisdictions to facilitate timely\nidentification of exposed persons. These data are securely\ntransmitted to state and territorial health departments via the\nEpidemic Information Exchange (Epi-X) Forum (available at\n<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/epix/epix.html>) for notification of\npotentially exposed passengers.\nIncidence of mumps in the United States began to decrease after\nvaccine introduction in 1967 and recommendations for routine\nvaccination of children in 1977. Since the 1990s, a further decrease\nin the reported incidence of mumps has occurred, which is thought to\nbe attributable to the implementation of the 2nd dose of measles,\nmumps, and rubella vaccine (3). The risk for transmission of\nrespiratory infectious diseases during air travel might depend on\nseveral factors, including 1) immunity of passengers; 2)\ninfectiousness of the organism; 3) degree of shedding of the pathogen\nby infected passengers; 4) hygienic practices of infectious\npassengers; 5) proximity of others to infectious passengers; 6)\nhygienic practices of the other passengers/crew; 7) flight duration;\nand 8) cabin environment of the aircraft (4). Transmission of other\nrespiratory pathogens during air travel has been reported (5-9).\nExposure and transmission of mumps during commercial air travel has\nnot been described previously.\n[Reported by: P Quinlisk, MD, Iowa Dept of Public Health.

Students under the age of 25 were being\noffered vaccinations, said a spokeswoman. Affected colleges include Jesus,\nEmmanuel, Pembroke, St. Catharine's, Peterhouse, Corpus Christi, Churchill,\nand Trinity Hall.\n\"The university published advice in the student handbook. We advised all\nstudents to check if they had been immunized, and if not, to arrange for\nimmunization through their GP,\" she said. \"1st-year students were offered\nthe opportunity to be vaccinated free of charge through their GP, once they\narrived in the city.\"\nUniversities across the UK have been setting up vaccination programs in\nrecent weeks.

Since 1990 three strains of mumps virus - Urabe,\nJeryl-Lynn, and Rubini - have been used in MMR vaccines. The Urabe strain\nwas withdrawn in 1992 after an increased risk of aseptic meninigitis was\nreported in other countries and the Rubini strain was purchased between\n1993 and 1995. In more recent years the Jeryl-Lynn strain (vaccine efficacy\n75%) has also been used (KT Goh, personal communication). The incidence of\nmumps increased from 674 cases in 1997 to 1183 cases in 1998, 2586 cases\nwere reported in the first seven months of 1999, and it is estimated that\nthe incidence will reach 200 per 100 000 population by the end of 1999.\nForty-four per cent (258) of 592 cases that arose in the last four months\nof 1998 had received MMR vaccine. Of 195 whose mumps vaccine strain was\nknown, 144 (74%) had received the Rubini strain, 42 (22%) the Jeryl-Lynn\nstrain, and nine (5%) the Urabe strain. About 75% of cases had received MMR\nvaccine between one and four years before developing mumps.\nEpidemiological evidence suggested that the Rubini vaccine strain offered\nno protection. One hundred and forty of 1546 children who had been\nvaccinated with the Rubini strain developed mumps - an attack rate of 9%.\nThe short interval between vaccination and illness indicated primary rather\nthan secondary vaccine failure due waning immunity over time.\nSeroepidemiological evidence showed that the prevalence of mumps antibody\nin children aged under 5 years of age was 22% in 1989 before MMR was\nintroduced. It increased to 72% in 1993 after mumps vaccination with the\nUrabe and Jeryl-Lynn strains was introduced, but it fell to 26% in 1998.\nThe Ministry of Health in Singapore deregistered the MMR vaccine containing\nthe Rubini strain in May 1999.\nThe poor protection of the Rubini strain in mumps vaccine has been noted in\nother countries (2-4). In Portugal, Rubini replaced the Urabe strain in MMR\nvaccine in October 1992 and resulted in a large increase in the incidence\nof mumps in children (5). The highest rates of mumps occurred in children\naged 1 to 4 years during a mumps epidemic in 1995/96. By January 1998 all\nPortuguese health centres had begun to use MMR vaccine containing the Jeryl\nLynn strain in place of the Rubini strain (6).\nReferences:\nGoh KT.

Since 1990 three strains of mumps virus - Urabe,\nJeryl-Lynn, and Rubini - have been used in MMR vaccines. The Urabe strain\nwas withdrawn in 1992 after an increased risk of aseptic meninigitis was\nreported in other countries and the Rubini strain was purchased between\n1993 and 1995. In more recent years the Jeryl-Lynn strain (vaccine efficacy\n75%) has also been used (KT Goh, personal communication). The incidence of\nmumps increased from 674 cases in 1997 to 1183 cases in 1998, 2586 cases\nwere reported in the first seven months of 1999, and it is estimated that\nthe incidence will reach 200 per 100 000 population by the end of 1999.\nForty-four per cent (258) of 592 cases that arose in the last four months\nof 1998 had received MMR vaccine. Of 195 whose mumps vaccine strain was\nknown, 144 (74%) had received the Rubini strain, 42 (22%) the Jeryl-Lynn\nstrain, and nine (5%) the Urabe strain. About 75% of cases had received MMR\nvaccine between one and four years before developing mumps.\nEpidemiological evidence suggested that the Rubini vaccine strain offered\nno protection. One hundred and forty of 1546 children who had been\nvaccinated with the Rubini strain developed mumps - an attack rate of 9%.\nThe short interval between vaccination and illness indicated primary rather\nthan secondary vaccine failure due waning immunity over time.\nSeroepidemiological evidence showed that the prevalence of mumps antibody\nin children aged under 5 years of age was 22% in 1989 before MMR was\nintroduced. It increased to 72% in 1993 after mumps vaccination with the\nUrabe and Jeryl-Lynn strains was introduced, but it fell to 26% in 1998.\nThe Ministry of Health in Singapore deregistered the MMR vaccine containing\nthe Rubini strain in May 1999.\nThe poor protection of the Rubini strain in mumps vaccine has been noted in\nother countries (2-4). In Portugal, Rubini replaced the Urabe strain in MMR\nvaccine in October 1992 and resulted in a large increase in the incidence\nof mumps in children (5). The highest rates of mumps occurred in children\naged 1 to 4 years during a mumps epidemic in 1995/96. By January 1998 all\nPortuguese health centres had begun to use MMR vaccine containing the Jeryl\nLynn strain in place of the Rubini strain (6).\nReferences:\nGoh KT.

An investigation\nwas initiated with the British Columbia Centre for Disease Control (BCCDC).\nBetween 1 January 1997 and 31 March 1997, a total of 83 cases of mumps were\nreported via the BC Communicable Disease Surveillance System.\nA universal combined measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) immunization program\nwas introduced in BC in 1981 for children aged >12 months.\nInitial case follow-ups by the V/RHB suggested that public social events\nwere risk factors for acquiring mumps in the young adult age group. A\ncase-control study was initiated to examine this hypothesis and to further\nexplore the outcomes of mumps illness. Vaccine effectiveness, ascertained\nby self-reported immunization status, was estimated to be 80% (95%\nconfidence interval [CI] = 29% to 96%).\nEighty-eight percent (45/51) of the cases reported being in the Greater\nVancouver area during the exposure period. Among the 47 matched\ncase-control pairs, contact with a person with mumps was significantly\nassociated with illness (odds ratio = 13, 95% CI = 1.95 to 552). Sixteen\nof the 40 cases aged 17 to 40 years, and one of the nine cases aged <17\nyears reported attending a \"rave\" party during the exposure period.\n\"Raves\" are very large gatherings of teenagers and young adults who listen\nand dance to electronic music in warehouse type venues. Of the risk\nfactors examined, exposure to rave parties was the most strongly associated\nwith illness (odds ratio = 17, 95% CI = 2.7 to 710). All \"rave\" attendees\nreported sharing drinks and dancing in close proximity to others.\nAttending educational institutions, having contact with >50 persons per day\nat work, being a health-care professional, attending dance clubs, bars, or\nother social events, and playing group sports were not associated with\nillness.\nThe increased incidence rates in this outbreak suggest that the 1957 to\n1980 birth cohorts were most at risk. These incompletely vaccinated birth\ncohorts sustain an adult population susceptible to outbreaks of mumps in\nthe future. This investigation highlights, as previously described, the\nhigh proportion of extra-salivary symptoms of mumps experienced by an adult\npopulation.\nThis is the second communicable disease outbreak reported to be associated\nwith \"rave\" parties in Canada, the first being a 1996 meningitis outbreak\nin Quebec. These social events, characterized by close contact and sharing\nof drinks, should be considered as a risk factor for mumps and other\nillnesses transmissible by person-to-person droplet spread.\nIn response to the outbreak and this investigation, the V/RHB released a\npublic notice about \"raves\" as a risk factor for acquiring mumps and a\nreminder about MMR vaccinations.\nSource: A Bell, MDCM, MHSc, M Fyfe, MD, MSc, Communicable Disease\nEpidemiology Services, BCCDC, M Bigham, MD, MHSc, P Daly, MD, V/RHB, J\nBuxton, MBBS, MHSc, Community Residency Program, Department of Health Care\nand Epidemiology, UBC, Vancouver, BC; C Craig, DVM, BSc, Field Epidemiology\nTraining Program, LCDC, Ottawa, ON.\n--\nProMED-mail\ne-mail: <promed@usa.healthnet.org>\n[This report comes long after the epidemic occurrence but serves as a\nreminder that mumps virus has not yet been eradicated and that appropriate\nvaccination levels must be maintained. - Mod.CHC]\n......................................chc/es\n--\n*##########################################################*\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.

An investigation\nwas initiated with the British Columbia Centre for Disease Control (BCCDC).\nBetween 1 January 1997 and 31 March 1997, a total of 83 cases of mumps were\nreported via the BC Communicable Disease Surveillance System.\nA universal combined measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) immunization program\nwas introduced in BC in 1981 for children aged >12 months.\nInitial case follow-ups by the V/RHB suggested that public social events\nwere risk factors for acquiring mumps in the young adult age group. A\ncase-control study was initiated to examine this hypothesis and to further\nexplore the outcomes of mumps illness. Vaccine effectiveness, ascertained\nby self-reported immunization status, was estimated to be 80% (95%\nconfidence interval [CI] = 29% to 96%).\nEighty-eight percent (45/51) of the cases reported being in the Greater\nVancouver area during the exposure period. Among the 47 matched\ncase-control pairs, contact with a person with mumps was significantly\nassociated with illness (odds ratio = 13, 95% CI = 1.95 to 552). Sixteen\nof the 40 cases aged 17 to 40 years, and one of the nine cases aged <17\nyears reported attending a \"rave\" party during the exposure period.\n\"Raves\" are very large gatherings of teenagers and young adults who listen\nand dance to electronic music in warehouse type venues. Of the risk\nfactors examined, exposure to rave parties was the most strongly associated\nwith illness (odds ratio = 17, 95% CI = 2.7 to 710). All \"rave\" attendees\nreported sharing drinks and dancing in close proximity to others.\nAttending educational institutions, having contact with >50 persons per day\nat work, being a health-care professional, attending dance clubs, bars, or\nother social events, and playing group sports were not associated with\nillness.\nThe increased incidence rates in this outbreak suggest that the 1957 to\n1980 birth cohorts were most at risk. These incompletely vaccinated birth\ncohorts sustain an adult population susceptible to outbreaks of mumps in\nthe future. This investigation highlights, as previously described, the\nhigh proportion of extra-salivary symptoms of mumps experienced by an adult\npopulation.\nThis is the second communicable disease outbreak reported to be associated\nwith \"rave\" parties in Canada, the first being a 1996 meningitis outbreak\nin Quebec. These social events, characterized by close contact and sharing\nof drinks, should be considered as a risk factor for mumps and other\nillnesses transmissible by person-to-person droplet spread.\nIn response to the outbreak and this investigation, the V/RHB released a\npublic notice about \"raves\" as a risk factor for acquiring mumps and a\nreminder about MMR vaccinations.\nSource: A Bell, MDCM, MHSc, M Fyfe, MD, MSc, Communicable Disease\nEpidemiology Services, BCCDC, M Bigham, MD, MHSc, P Daly, MD, V/RHB, J\nBuxton, MBBS, MHSc, Community Residency Program, Department of Health Care\nand Epidemiology, UBC, Vancouver, BC; C Craig, DVM, BSc, Field Epidemiology\nTraining Program, LCDC, Ottawa, ON.\n--\nProMED-mail\ne-mail: <promed@usa.healthnet.org>\n[This report comes long after the epidemic occurrence but serves as a\nreminder that mumps virus has not yet been eradicated and that appropriate\nvaccination levels must be maintained. - Mod.CHC]\n......................................chc/es\n--\n*##########################################################*\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.
