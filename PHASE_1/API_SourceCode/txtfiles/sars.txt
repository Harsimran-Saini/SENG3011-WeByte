The daughter was also found to have eschar[s?] and lymphadenopathy. They were seen by a private physician. Both are in stable condition after receiving treatment; no hospitalization is needed.

With the identification of _R. africae_ from patients with African tick bite fever in 1992 (2), it has been recognized that this disease is clearly the most prevalent cause of rickettsial infection in sub-Saharan Africa, and this disease is actually commonly reported in travelers returning from South Africa (3), particularly in those traveling to Kruger National Park. The literature contains a significant number of case reports documenting the acquisition of this infection in travelers and is represented by references 4-6.

Officials suspected she\nwas infected by birds at the market, he said.\nH9N2 is a mild strain [of avian influenza A\nvirus], [the H5N1 strain of avian influenza A\nvirus] has caused the deaths of at least 169\npeople worldwide. [The H9N2 virus belongs to a\ndifferent serotype of avian influenza A virus and\nshould not be described as a strain of H5N1\nvirus. These 2 avian influenza A viruses should\nbe regarded as distinct viruses differing in\nvirulence, host range and transmissibility. -\nMod.CP]. \"The baby's case is not that serious,\nand there's no serious indication that there was\nhuman-to-human infection,\" Tsang said.\nHong Kong reported 2 cases of the mild strain in\n1999 and one in 2003, he said. The patients were\nchildren who all recovered, he said. The recent\ncase returned home after spending 5 days in the\nhospital, but the child was put into isolation\nafter her samples tested positive for H9N2, said\nTsang, adding that the case was confirmed Tuesday [20 Mar 2007].\nOfficials were taking more samples from the\nmarket and family members, he said. Hong Kong\naggressively monitors bird flu because an\noutbreak [caaused by a highly pathogenic strain\nof different serotype - Mod CP.] in 1997 jumped\nto humans and killed 6 people. That prompted the\ngovernment to slaughter the entire poultry\npopulation of about 1.5 million birds.\n--\nJoseph P.

In 1999 an influenza A (H9N2)\nvirus was isolated from 2 patients (aged one and\n4 years old) by the Virus Unit of the Hong Kong\nDepartment of Health. Both girls recovered fully.\nThis was the 1st occasion that an H9N2 virus had\nbeen isolated from humans in Hong Kong, although\ninfluenza A (H9N2) viruses had been isolated from\nducks and chickens for several years previously.\nIn both instances the H9N2 virus was isolated\nfrom mildly ill young children and there was no\nfurther spread of infection. The circumstances\nsurrounding the exposure of these children to infection have not been reported.\nOther avian influenza viruses have been isolated\nfrom human patients, notably the H5N1 virus in\nHong Kong in 1997 and subsequently, and H9N2 (and\nH5N1) in 2003, and the H7N7 virus in the more\nextensive poultry outbreak in the Netherlands\nearlier in 2003. On these occasions only the H5N1\nviruses caused severe disease in humans.

Officials suspected she\nwas infected by birds at the market, he said.\nH9N2 is a mild strain [of avian influenza A\nvirus], [the H5N1 strain of avian influenza A\nvirus] has caused the deaths of at least 169\npeople worldwide. [The H9N2 virus belongs to a\ndifferent serotype of avian influenza A virus and\nshould not be described as a strain of H5N1\nvirus.

The patients were\nchildren who all recovered, he said. The recent\ncase returned home after spending 5 days in the\nhospital, but the child was put into isolation\nafter her samples tested positive for H9N2, said\nTsang, adding that the case was confirmed Tuesday [20 Mar 2007].\nOfficials were taking more samples from the\nmarket and family members, he said. Hong Kong\naggressively monitors bird flu because an\noutbreak [caaused by a highly pathogenic strain\nof different serotype - Mod CP.] in 1997 jumped\nto humans and killed 6 people. That prompted the\ngovernment to slaughter the entire poultry\npopulation of about 1.5 million birds.\n--\nJoseph P.

Officials suspected she\nwas infected by birds at the market, he said.\nH9N2 is a mild strain [of avian influenza A\nvirus], [the H5N1 strain of avian influenza A\nvirus] has caused the deaths of at least 169\npeople worldwide. [The H9N2 virus belongs to a\ndifferent serotype of avian influenza A virus and\nshould not be described as a strain of H5N1\nvirus.

The patients were\nchildren who all recovered, he said. The recent\ncase returned home after spending 5 days in the\nhospital, but the child was put into isolation\nafter her samples tested positive for H9N2, said\nTsang, adding that the case was confirmed Tuesday [20 Mar 2007].\nOfficials were taking more samples from the\nmarket and family members, he said. Hong Kong\naggressively monitors bird flu because an\noutbreak [caaused by a highly pathogenic strain\nof different serotype - Mod CP.] in 1997 jumped\nto humans and killed 6 people. That prompted the\ngovernment to slaughter the entire poultry\npopulation of about 1.5 million birds.\n--\nJoseph P.

Officials suspected she\nwas infected by birds at the market, he said.\nH9N2 is a mild strain [of avian influenza A\nvirus], [the H5N1 strain of avian influenza A\nvirus] has caused the deaths of at least 169\npeople worldwide. [The H9N2 virus belongs to a\ndifferent serotype of avian influenza A virus and\nshould not be described as a strain of H5N1\nvirus. These 2 avian influenza A viruses should\nbe regarded as distinct viruses differing in\nvirulence, host range and transmissibility. -\nMod.CP]. \"The baby's case is not that serious,\nand there's no serious indication that there was\nhuman-to-human infection,\" Tsang said.\nHong Kong reported 2 cases of the mild strain in\n1999 and one in 2003, he said. The patients were\nchildren who all recovered, he said. The recent\ncase returned home after spending 5 days in the\nhospital, but the child was put into isolation\nafter her samples tested positive for H9N2, said\nTsang, adding that the case was confirmed Tuesday [20 Mar 2007].\nOfficials were taking more samples from the\nmarket and family members, he said. Hong Kong\naggressively monitors bird flu because an\noutbreak [caaused by a highly pathogenic strain\nof different serotype - Mod CP.] in 1997 jumped\nto humans and killed 6 people. That prompted the\ngovernment to slaughter the entire poultry\npopulation of about 1.5 million birds.\n--\nJoseph P. Dudley, Ph.D\nChief Scientist,\nEAI Corporation\nResearch Associate,\nInstitute of Arctic Biology - University of Alaska Fairbanks\nDepartment of Earth Science - University of Alaska Museum\n<fnjpd@uaf.edu>\n[This case has precedents (e.g. see ProMED-mail\nposting : Influenza A (H9N2), bird-to-human -\nChina (Hong Kong) 19990407.0566 and Influenza A\n(H9N2), bird-to-human - China (Hong Kong)\n19990805.1347). In 1999 an influenza A (H9N2)\nvirus was isolated from 2 patients (aged one and\n4 years old) by the Virus Unit of the Hong Kong\nDepartment of Health. Both girls recovered fully.\nThis was the 1st occasion that an H9N2 virus had\nbeen isolated from humans in Hong Kong, although\ninfluenza A (H9N2) viruses had been isolated from\nducks and chickens for several years previously.\nIn both instances the H9N2 virus was isolated\nfrom mildly ill young children and there was no\nfurther spread of infection. The circumstances\nsurrounding the exposure of these children to infection have not been reported.\nOther avian influenza viruses have been isolated\nfrom human patients, notably the H5N1 virus in\nHong Kong in 1997 and subsequently, and H9N2 (and\nH5N1) in 2003, and the H7N7 virus in the more\nextensive poultry outbreak in the Netherlands\nearlier in 2003. On these occasions only the H5N1\nviruses caused severe disease in humans. No\nevidence of transmission of H9N2 virus among humans was observed. -Mod.CP]\n[ProMED-mail would also like to thank rapporteurs\nMary Marshall and A-lan Banks for submitting similar articles. - Mod.MPP]\nSee Also\n2003\n----\nInfluenza A (H9N2), child - China (Hong Kong) (02) 20031210.3028\nInfluenza A (H9N2), child - China (Hong Kong) 20031209.3021\n2002\n----\nAvian influenza, transmission to humans: genetics 20020106.3179\n2001\n----\nAvian influenza - Japan: pet parakeets 20010422.0784\nInfluenza virus: new diagnostic reagents 20010109.0075\n1999\n----\nInfluenza A (H9N2), bird-to-human - China (Hong Kong) 19990805.1347\nInfluenza A (H9N2), bird-to-human - China (Hong Kong) 19990407.0566\nInfluenza virus vaccine (02) 19990531.0916\nInfluenza A (H9N2), bird-to-human - China (HK) (03) 19990415.0622\nInfluenza A (H9N2), bird-to-human - China (Guandong) 19990409.0587\nInfluenza A (H9N2), bird-to-human - China (HK) (02) 19990409.0586\n..................cp/mpp\n*##########################################################*\n************************************************************\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.

The\nteam, which is expected to begin work on Wednesday, will include experts in\nepidemiology, virology, infection control, and laboratory biosafety.\nResults of investigations to date point to laboratory research at the\nNational Institute of Virology in Beijing as the likely source of the\noutbreak. The institute has been engaged in research with the SARS\ncoronavirus, including the development of a vaccine.\nTwo of the recently reported cases were conducting research at the\nlaboratory: a 26 year old female postgraduate student from Anhui Province,\nand a 31 year old man. The dates of symptom onset in the 2 cases were\nseparated by 23 days, suggesting that more than one opportunity for\nexposure may have occurred in the laboratory from mid-March through early\nApril 2004. Authorities have closed the virology institute and placed its\nmore than 200 employees under medical observation. Numerous environmental\nsamples from the laboratory have been taken to help assess possible sources\nof contamination, and these samples will be shared with WHO.\nUnderstanding and eliminating the source of infection are critical steps in\nbringing the outbreak under control. An equally important activity is to\nquickly detect all chains of transmission and interrupt them through rapid\ncase detection, tracing and follow-up of contacts, and infection control in\nhospitals.\nWHO is concerned about additional opportunities for exposure that may have\nalready occurred. Some patients were treated or assessed in several\ndifferent hospitals before a suspicion of SARS led to the introduction of\nadequate precautionary measures, including isolation of patients and strict\nprocedures for infection control. One patient travelled a long distance\ntwice by train within China while symptomatic.\nChinese authorities have heightened surveillance and reporting for\nSARS-like illness in health care facilities and have sent investigative\nteams to Anhui Province.\nSince 22 Apr 2004, China has reported that 8 people have been clinically\ndiagnosed as SARS cases or are under investigation for possible SARS\ninfection -- 6 in Beijing and 2, including the single fatality, in Anhui\nProvince. As of today, close to 1000 contacts of these cases are under\nmedical observation, including 640 in Beijing and 353 in Anhui.\nThe most recent cases, announced on Sunday, are 4 close contacts of a 20\nyear old nurse who treated the Anhui student at a Beijing hospital. The\ncases -\u00ad all in Beijing -\u00ad are currently under investigation. They include\nthe nurse\u0092s mother, father, aunt, and a woman who shared a hospital ward\nwith the nurse when she was undergoing treatment. Onset of symptoms for all\n4 occurred between 16 and 19 Apr 2004. The nurse\u0092s mother is in serious\ncondition following the development of pneumonia. The other 3 people are in\na stable condition.\nIn addition, health authorities have reported that 2 doctors who treated\nthe postgraduate student during her hospitalization in Hefai, Anhui, have\ndeveloped fever. A person in close contact with one of the doctors has also\ndeveloped fever.\nTo date, all diagnosed cases and cases under investigation have been linked\nto chains of transmission involving close personal contact with an\nidentified case. There is no evidence of wider transmission in the community.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[In the past 24 hours since the last update (20040425.1150), there are the\nadditional reports of fever in 2 physicians treating the index case in\nAnhui and in a close contact of one of these 2 physicians. According the\nChina Minstry of Health (MOH) website (<http://www.moh.gov.cn>), there has\nbeen the implementation of increased surveillance for \"atypical pneumonia\"\ncountry-wide, but no additional suspected cases have been identified.\nAs with 2003, there is an \"outbreak\" of newswire reports and speculations\non this current situation, and for this reason we have chosen to be highly\nselective of newswire information we post, preferring to rely upon the\nofficial reports available from WHO and the Chinese MOH. Lessons were\nclearly learned after the 2003 outbreak, and there is now apparent\ntransparency in reporting. We will continue to screen newswire reports for\npossible early introduction of probable SARS activity in new geographic\nregions (outside of the currently identified Beijing and Anhui provinces),\nincluding any possible international spread.\nWe are still awaiting information on the independent laboratory testing of\nspecimens from the currently identified cases in China. Until these results\nare available, the cases are being classified as probable and suspected.\nAccording to WHO guidelines for the global surveillance of SARS,\nclassification as a confirmed case at the start of an outbreak requires\nindependent verification of results by an external international reference\nlaboratory. Such procedures are considered necessary in view of the\nimplications that confirmed SARS cases can have for international public\nhealth. Irrespective of the \"tentative\" classifications, appropriate\ninvestigations and disease control measures have been implemented, under\nthe assumption that infection with SARS coronavirus has truly occurred.\nHence, it is a semantic discussion that will not delay appropriate control\nmeasures to interrupt transmission.\nFrom the information currently available, there is now evidence of 3\ngenerations of transmission. The 1st generation involved the index case\nfrom Anhui, and possibly a 2nd \"1st-generation\" case, the postdoctoral\nstudent from Beijing whose onset of illness was 23 days after the onset of\nillness of the index case from Anhui. The 2nd generation included the\nmother of the index case from Anhui and the nurse who cared for the index\ncase from Anhui while she was hospitalized in Beijing, and possibly the\nphysicians who cared for her while hospitalized in Anhui. The 3rd\ngeneration of cases are the family members of the nurse (from the 2nd\ngeneration), a patient hospitalized in the same ward as the nurse before\nSARS was identified as a possible diagnosis for the nurse's illness, and a\nclose contact of one of the physicians who treated the index patient in\nAnhui. This pattern of nosocomial spread due to lack of early\nidentification of SARS as a possible diagnosis is very reminiscent of the\noutbreak in 2003.\nConcern about possible spread outside of the current identified \"close\ncontact\" circle around these cases is warranted. It is to be hoped that the\nthreshold for suspicion of possible SARS will be lowered country-wide, so\ncases that may occur related to transmission while travelling on the trains\nbetween Anhui Province and Beijing will be identified and isolated early,\npreventing further generations of transmission.\nIn addition, there are appropriate concerns about laboratory safety\nprocedures. This is now the 3rd incident of SARS transmission within a\nlaboratory working on SARS research. The first 2 occurred in Singapore and\nTaiwan (see ProMED-mail postings SARS - worldwide (185): Taiwan, probable\nlab exposure 20031217.3081 and SARS - worldwide (174): Singapore laboratory\nexposure 20030923.2397). Since the 2003 outbreak, it seems as though\nlaboratory exposure is a higher risk factor than the possible zoonotic\nexposure. - Mod.MPP]\nSee Also\nSARS - worldwide (20): China, cases 20040425.1150\nSARS - worldwide (19): China, cases 20040424.1141\nSARS - worldwide (18): China, cases 20040423.1125\nSARS - worldwide (16): China, suspected cases 20040422.1118\nSARS - worldwide (15): animal reservoirs 20040417.1059\nSARS - worldwide (14): travel advice 20040212.0467\nSARS - worldwide (13): China, cases 20040131.0365\nSARS - Worldwide (12): molecular epidemiology, 2003 20040131.0364\nSARS - worldwide (11): molecular epidemiology, 2003 20040130.0358\nSARS - worldwide (10): China, 2004 cases 20040127.0327\nSARS - worldwide (09): China, WHO clarification 20040120.0223\nSARS - worldwide (08): China, suspected cases 20040119.0209\nSARS - worldwide (07) - China: suspected cases 20040114.0149\nSARS - worldwide (06) - China: suspected cases 20040111.0118\nSARS - worldwide (05): Taiwan lab investigation 20040109.0096\nSARS - Worldwide (04): China, new susp. case 20040108.0081\nSARS - worldwide (03): etiology 20040107.0073\nSARS - worldwide (02): China, laboratory confirmed 20040105.0046\nSARS - worldwide (01): China, susp. case 20040102.0015\n2003\n---\nSARS worldwide (179): WHO SRAC 1st report 20031024.2666\nSARS - worldwide (02): cases 20030324.0734\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - worldwide (17) 20030322.0713\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - Worldwide (02) 20030315.0649\nSevere Acute Respiratory Syndrome - Worldwide:alert 20030315.0637\n.....................mpp/pg/sh\n*##########################################################*\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.

The\nteam, which is expected to begin work on Wednesday, will include experts in\nepidemiology, virology, infection control, and laboratory biosafety.\nResults of investigations to date point to laboratory research at the\nNational Institute of Virology in Beijing as the likely source of the\noutbreak. The institute has been engaged in research with the SARS\ncoronavirus, including the development of a vaccine.\nTwo of the recently reported cases were conducting research at the\nlaboratory: a 26 year old female postgraduate student from Anhui Province,\nand a 31 year old man. The dates of symptom onset in the 2 cases were\nseparated by 23 days, suggesting that more than one opportunity for\nexposure may have occurred in the laboratory from mid-March through early\nApril 2004. Authorities have closed the virology institute and placed its\nmore than 200 employees under medical observation. Numerous environmental\nsamples from the laboratory have been taken to help assess possible sources\nof contamination, and these samples will be shared with WHO.\nUnderstanding and eliminating the source of infection are critical steps in\nbringing the outbreak under control. An equally important activity is to\nquickly detect all chains of transmission and interrupt them through rapid\ncase detection, tracing and follow-up of contacts, and infection control in\nhospitals.\nWHO is concerned about additional opportunities for exposure that may have\nalready occurred. Some patients were treated or assessed in several\ndifferent hospitals before a suspicion of SARS led to the introduction of\nadequate precautionary measures, including isolation of patients and strict\nprocedures for infection control. One patient travelled a long distance\ntwice by train within China while symptomatic.\nChinese authorities have heightened surveillance and reporting for\nSARS-like illness in health care facilities and have sent investigative\nteams to Anhui Province.\nSince 22 Apr 2004, China has reported that 8 people have been clinically\ndiagnosed as SARS cases or are under investigation for possible SARS\ninfection -- 6 in Beijing and 2, including the single fatality, in Anhui\nProvince. As of today, close to 1000 contacts of these cases are under\nmedical observation, including 640 in Beijing and 353 in Anhui.\nThe most recent cases, announced on Sunday, are 4 close contacts of a 20\nyear old nurse who treated the Anhui student at a Beijing hospital. The\ncases -\u00ad all in Beijing -\u00ad are currently under investigation. They include\nthe nurse\u0092s mother, father, aunt, and a woman who shared a hospital ward\nwith the nurse when she was undergoing treatment. Onset of symptoms for all\n4 occurred between 16 and 19 Apr 2004. The nurse\u0092s mother is in serious\ncondition following the development of pneumonia. The other 3 people are in\na stable condition.\nIn addition, health authorities have reported that 2 doctors who treated\nthe postgraduate student during her hospitalization in Hefai, Anhui, have\ndeveloped fever. A person in close contact with one of the doctors has also\ndeveloped fever.\nTo date, all diagnosed cases and cases under investigation have been linked\nto chains of transmission involving close personal contact with an\nidentified case. There is no evidence of wider transmission in the community.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[In the past 24 hours since the last update (20040425.1150), there are the\nadditional reports of fever in 2 physicians treating the index case in\nAnhui and in a close contact of one of these 2 physicians. According the\nChina Minstry of Health (MOH) website (<http://www.moh.gov.cn>), there has\nbeen the implementation of increased surveillance for \"atypical pneumonia\"\ncountry-wide, but no additional suspected cases have been identified.\nAs with 2003, there is an \"outbreak\" of newswire reports and speculations\non this current situation, and for this reason we have chosen to be highly\nselective of newswire information we post, preferring to rely upon the\nofficial reports available from WHO and the Chinese MOH. Lessons were\nclearly learned after the 2003 outbreak, and there is now apparent\ntransparency in reporting. We will continue to screen newswire reports for\npossible early introduction of probable SARS activity in new geographic\nregions (outside of the currently identified Beijing and Anhui provinces),\nincluding any possible international spread.\nWe are still awaiting information on the independent laboratory testing of\nspecimens from the currently identified cases in China. Until these results\nare available, the cases are being classified as probable and suspected.\nAccording to WHO guidelines for the global surveillance of SARS,\nclassification as a confirmed case at the start of an outbreak requires\nindependent verification of results by an external international reference\nlaboratory. Such procedures are considered necessary in view of the\nimplications that confirmed SARS cases can have for international public\nhealth. Irrespective of the \"tentative\" classifications, appropriate\ninvestigations and disease control measures have been implemented, under\nthe assumption that infection with SARS coronavirus has truly occurred.\nHence, it is a semantic discussion that will not delay appropriate control\nmeasures to interrupt transmission.\nFrom the information currently available, there is now evidence of 3\ngenerations of transmission. The 1st generation involved the index case\nfrom Anhui, and possibly a 2nd \"1st-generation\" case, the postdoctoral\nstudent from Beijing whose onset of illness was 23 days after the onset of\nillness of the index case from Anhui. The 2nd generation included the\nmother of the index case from Anhui and the nurse who cared for the index\ncase from Anhui while she was hospitalized in Beijing, and possibly the\nphysicians who cared for her while hospitalized in Anhui. The 3rd\ngeneration of cases are the family members of the nurse (from the 2nd\ngeneration), a patient hospitalized in the same ward as the nurse before\nSARS was identified as a possible diagnosis for the nurse's illness, and a\nclose contact of one of the physicians who treated the index patient in\nAnhui. This pattern of nosocomial spread due to lack of early\nidentification of SARS as a possible diagnosis is very reminiscent of the\noutbreak in 2003.\nConcern about possible spread outside of the current identified \"close\ncontact\" circle around these cases is warranted. It is to be hoped that the\nthreshold for suspicion of possible SARS will be lowered country-wide, so\ncases that may occur related to transmission while travelling on the trains\nbetween Anhui Province and Beijing will be identified and isolated early,\npreventing further generations of transmission.\nIn addition, there are appropriate concerns about laboratory safety\nprocedures. This is now the 3rd incident of SARS transmission within a\nlaboratory working on SARS research. The first 2 occurred in Singapore and\nTaiwan (see ProMED-mail postings SARS - worldwide (185): Taiwan, probable\nlab exposure 20031217.3081 and SARS - worldwide (174): Singapore laboratory\nexposure 20030923.2397).

The institute has been engaged in research with the SARS\ncoronavirus, including the development of a vaccine.\nTwo of the recently reported cases were conducting research at the\nlaboratory: a 26 year old female postgraduate student from Anhui Province,\nand a 31 year old man. The dates of symptom onset in the 2 cases were\nseparated by 23 days, suggesting that more than one opportunity for\nexposure may have occurred in the laboratory from mid-March through early\nApril 2004. Authorities have closed the virology institute and placed its\nmore than 200 employees under medical observation. Numerous environmental\nsamples from the laboratory have been taken to help assess possible sources\nof contamination, and these samples will be shared with WHO.\nUnderstanding and eliminating the source of infection are critical steps in\nbringing the outbreak under control. An equally important activity is to\nquickly detect all chains of transmission and interrupt them through rapid\ncase detection, tracing and follow-up of contacts, and infection control in\nhospitals.\nWHO is concerned about additional opportunities for exposure that may have\nalready occurred. Some patients were treated or assessed in several\ndifferent hospitals before a suspicion of SARS led to the introduction of\nadequate precautionary measures, including isolation of patients and strict\nprocedures for infection control. One patient travelled a long distance\ntwice by train within China while symptomatic.\nChinese authorities have heightened surveillance and reporting for\nSARS-like illness in health care facilities and have sent investigative\nteams to Anhui Province.\nSince 22 Apr 2004, China has reported that 8 people have been clinically\ndiagnosed as SARS cases or are under investigation for possible SARS\ninfection -- 6 in Beijing and 2, including the single fatality, in Anhui\nProvince. As of today, close to 1000 contacts of these cases are under\nmedical observation, including 640 in Beijing and 353 in Anhui.\nThe most recent cases, announced on Sunday, are 4 close contacts of a 20\nyear old nurse who treated the Anhui student at a Beijing hospital. The\ncases -\u00ad all in Beijing -\u00ad are currently under investigation. They include\nthe nurse\u0092s mother, father, aunt, and a woman who shared a hospital ward\nwith the nurse when she was undergoing treatment. Onset of symptoms for all\n4 occurred between 16 and 19 Apr 2004. The nurse\u0092s mother is in serious\ncondition following the development of pneumonia. The other 3 people are in\na stable condition.\nIn addition, health authorities have reported that 2 doctors who treated\nthe postgraduate student during her hospitalization in Hefai, Anhui, have\ndeveloped fever. A person in close contact with one of the doctors has also\ndeveloped fever.\nTo date, all diagnosed cases and cases under investigation have been linked\nto chains of transmission involving close personal contact with an\nidentified case. There is no evidence of wider transmission in the community.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[In the past 24 hours since the last update (20040425.1150), there are the\nadditional reports of fever in 2 physicians treating the index case in\nAnhui and in a close contact of one of these 2 physicians. According the\nChina Minstry of Health (MOH) website (<http://www.moh.gov.cn>), there has\nbeen the implementation of increased surveillance for \"atypical pneumonia\"\ncountry-wide, but no additional suspected cases have been identified.\nAs with 2003, there is an \"outbreak\" of newswire reports and speculations\non this current situation, and for this reason we have chosen to be highly\nselective of newswire information we post, preferring to rely upon the\nofficial reports available from WHO and the Chinese MOH. Lessons were\nclearly learned after the 2003 outbreak, and there is now apparent\ntransparency in reporting. We will continue to screen newswire reports for\npossible early introduction of probable SARS activity in new geographic\nregions (outside of the currently identified Beijing and Anhui provinces),\nincluding any possible international spread.\nWe are still awaiting information on the independent laboratory testing of\nspecimens from the currently identified cases in China. Until these results\nare available, the cases are being classified as probable and suspected.\nAccording to WHO guidelines for the global surveillance of SARS,\nclassification as a confirmed case at the start of an outbreak requires\nindependent verification of results by an external international reference\nlaboratory. Such procedures are considered necessary in view of the\nimplications that confirmed SARS cases can have for international public\nhealth. Irrespective of the \"tentative\" classifications, appropriate\ninvestigations and disease control measures have been implemented, under\nthe assumption that infection with SARS coronavirus has truly occurred.\nHence, it is a semantic discussion that will not delay appropriate control\nmeasures to interrupt transmission.\nFrom the information currently available, there is now evidence of 3\ngenerations of transmission. The 1st generation involved the index case\nfrom Anhui, and possibly a 2nd \"1st-generation\" case, the postdoctoral\nstudent from Beijing whose onset of illness was 23 days after the onset of\nillness of the index case from Anhui. The 2nd generation included the\nmother of the index case from Anhui and the nurse who cared for the index\ncase from Anhui while she was hospitalized in Beijing, and possibly the\nphysicians who cared for her while hospitalized in Anhui. The 3rd\ngeneration of cases are the family members of the nurse (from the 2nd\ngeneration), a patient hospitalized in the same ward as the nurse before\nSARS was identified as a possible diagnosis for the nurse's illness, and a\nclose contact of one of the physicians who treated the index patient in\nAnhui. This pattern of nosocomial spread due to lack of early\nidentification of SARS as a possible diagnosis is very reminiscent of the\noutbreak in 2003.\nConcern about possible spread outside of the current identified \"close\ncontact\" circle around these cases is warranted. It is to be hoped that the\nthreshold for suspicion of possible SARS will be lowered country-wide, so\ncases that may occur related to transmission while travelling on the trains\nbetween Anhui Province and Beijing will be identified and isolated early,\npreventing further generations of transmission.\nIn addition, there are appropriate concerns about laboratory safety\nprocedures. This is now the 3rd incident of SARS transmission within a\nlaboratory working on SARS research. The first 2 occurred in Singapore and\nTaiwan (see ProMED-mail postings SARS - worldwide (185): Taiwan, probable\nlab exposure 20031217.3081 and SARS - worldwide (174): Singapore laboratory\nexposure 20030923.2397).

Numerous environmental\nsamples from the laboratory have been taken to help assess possible sources\nof contamination, and these samples will be shared with WHO.\nUnderstanding and eliminating the source of infection are critical steps in\nbringing the outbreak under control. An equally important activity is to\nquickly detect all chains of transmission and interrupt them through rapid\ncase detection, tracing and follow-up of contacts, and infection control in\nhospitals.\nWHO is concerned about additional opportunities for exposure that may have\nalready occurred. Some patients were treated or assessed in several\ndifferent hospitals before a suspicion of SARS led to the introduction of\nadequate precautionary measures, including isolation of patients and strict\nprocedures for infection control. One patient travelled a long distance\ntwice by train within China while symptomatic.\nChinese authorities have heightened surveillance and reporting for\nSARS-like illness in health care facilities and have sent investigative\nteams to Anhui Province.\nSince 22 Apr 2004, China has reported that 8 people have been clinically\ndiagnosed as SARS cases or are under investigation for possible SARS\ninfection -- 6 in Beijing and 2, including the single fatality, in Anhui\nProvince. As of today, close to 1000 contacts of these cases are under\nmedical observation, including 640 in Beijing and 353 in Anhui.\nThe most recent cases, announced on Sunday, are 4 close contacts of a 20\nyear old nurse who treated the Anhui student at a Beijing hospital. The\ncases -\u00ad all in Beijing -\u00ad are currently under investigation. They include\nthe nurse\u0092s mother, father, aunt, and a woman who shared a hospital ward\nwith the nurse when she was undergoing treatment. Onset of symptoms for all\n4 occurred between 16 and 19 Apr 2004. The nurse\u0092s mother is in serious\ncondition following the development of pneumonia. The other 3 people are in\na stable condition.\nIn addition, health authorities have reported that 2 doctors who treated\nthe postgraduate student during her hospitalization in Hefai, Anhui, have\ndeveloped fever. A person in close contact with one of the doctors has also\ndeveloped fever.\nTo date, all diagnosed cases and cases under investigation have been linked\nto chains of transmission involving close personal contact with an\nidentified case. There is no evidence of wider transmission in the community.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[In the past 24 hours since the last update (20040425.1150), there are the\nadditional reports of fever in 2 physicians treating the index case in\nAnhui and in a close contact of one of these 2 physicians. According the\nChina Minstry of Health (MOH) website (<http://www.moh.gov.cn>), there has\nbeen the implementation of increased surveillance for \"atypical pneumonia\"\ncountry-wide, but no additional suspected cases have been identified.\nAs with 2003, there is an \"outbreak\" of newswire reports and speculations\non this current situation, and for this reason we have chosen to be highly\nselective of newswire information we post, preferring to rely upon the\nofficial reports available from WHO and the Chinese MOH. Lessons were\nclearly learned after the 2003 outbreak, and there is now apparent\ntransparency in reporting. We will continue to screen newswire reports for\npossible early introduction of probable SARS activity in new geographic\nregions (outside of the currently identified Beijing and Anhui provinces),\nincluding any possible international spread.\nWe are still awaiting information on the independent laboratory testing of\nspecimens from the currently identified cases in China. Until these results\nare available, the cases are being classified as probable and suspected.\nAccording to WHO guidelines for the global surveillance of SARS,\nclassification as a confirmed case at the start of an outbreak requires\nindependent verification of results by an external international reference\nlaboratory. Such procedures are considered necessary in view of the\nimplications that confirmed SARS cases can have for international public\nhealth. Irrespective of the \"tentative\" classifications, appropriate\ninvestigations and disease control measures have been implemented, under\nthe assumption that infection with SARS coronavirus has truly occurred.\nHence, it is a semantic discussion that will not delay appropriate control\nmeasures to interrupt transmission.\nFrom the information currently available, there is now evidence of 3\ngenerations of transmission. The 1st generation involved the index case\nfrom Anhui, and possibly a 2nd \"1st-generation\" case, the postdoctoral\nstudent from Beijing whose onset of illness was 23 days after the onset of\nillness of the index case from Anhui. The 2nd generation included the\nmother of the index case from Anhui and the nurse who cared for the index\ncase from Anhui while she was hospitalized in Beijing, and possibly the\nphysicians who cared for her while hospitalized in Anhui. The 3rd\ngeneration of cases are the family members of the nurse (from the 2nd\ngeneration), a patient hospitalized in the same ward as the nurse before\nSARS was identified as a possible diagnosis for the nurse's illness, and a\nclose contact of one of the physicians who treated the index patient in\nAnhui. This pattern of nosocomial spread due to lack of early\nidentification of SARS as a possible diagnosis is very reminiscent of the\noutbreak in 2003.\nConcern about possible spread outside of the current identified \"close\ncontact\" circle around these cases is warranted. It is to be hoped that the\nthreshold for suspicion of possible SARS will be lowered country-wide, so\ncases that may occur related to transmission while travelling on the trains\nbetween Anhui Province and Beijing will be identified and isolated early,\npreventing further generations of transmission.\nIn addition, there are appropriate concerns about laboratory safety\nprocedures. This is now the 3rd incident of SARS transmission within a\nlaboratory working on SARS research. The first 2 occurred in Singapore and\nTaiwan (see ProMED-mail postings SARS - worldwide (185): Taiwan, probable\nlab exposure 20031217.3081 and SARS - worldwide (174): Singapore laboratory\nexposure 20030923.2397).

The 1st generation involved the index case\nfrom Anhui, and possibly a 2nd \"1st-generation\" case, the postdoctoral\nstudent from Beijing whose onset of illness was 23 days after the onset of\nillness of the index case from Anhui. The 2nd generation included the\nmother of the index case from Anhui and the nurse who cared for the index\ncase from Anhui while she was hospitalized in Beijing, and possibly the\nphysicians who cared for her while hospitalized in Anhui. The 3rd\ngeneration of cases are the family members of the nurse (from the 2nd\ngeneration), a patient hospitalized in the same ward as the nurse before\nSARS was identified as a possible diagnosis for the nurse's illness, and a\nclose contact of one of the physicians who treated the index patient in\nAnhui. This pattern of nosocomial spread due to lack of early\nidentification of SARS as a possible diagnosis is very reminiscent of the\noutbreak in 2003.\nConcern about possible spread outside of the current identified \"close\ncontact\" circle around these cases is warranted. It is to be hoped that the\nthreshold for suspicion of possible SARS will be lowered country-wide, so\ncases that may occur related to transmission while travelling on the trains\nbetween Anhui Province and Beijing will be identified and isolated early,\npreventing further generations of transmission.\nIn addition, there are appropriate concerns about laboratory safety\nprocedures. This is now the 3rd incident of SARS transmission within a\nlaboratory working on SARS research. The first 2 occurred in Singapore and\nTaiwan (see ProMED-mail postings SARS - worldwide (185): Taiwan, probable\nlab exposure 20031217.3081 and SARS - worldwide (174): Singapore laboratory\nexposure 20030923.2397). Since the 2003 outbreak, it seems as though\nlaboratory exposure is a higher risk factor than the possible zoonotic\nexposure. - Mod.MPP]\nSee Also\nSARS - worldwide (20): China, cases 20040425.1150\nSARS - worldwide (19): China, cases 20040424.1141\nSARS - worldwide (18): China, cases 20040423.1125\nSARS - worldwide (16): China, suspected cases 20040422.1118\nSARS - worldwide (15): animal reservoirs 20040417.1059\nSARS - worldwide (14): travel advice 20040212.0467\nSARS - worldwide (13): China, cases 20040131.0365\nSARS - Worldwide (12): molecular epidemiology, 2003 20040131.0364\nSARS - worldwide (11): molecular epidemiology, 2003 20040130.0358\nSARS - worldwide (10): China, 2004 cases 20040127.0327\nSARS - worldwide (09): China, WHO clarification 20040120.0223\nSARS - worldwide (08): China, suspected cases 20040119.0209\nSARS - worldwide (07) - China: suspected cases 20040114.0149\nSARS - worldwide (06) - China: suspected cases 20040111.0118\nSARS - worldwide (05): Taiwan lab investigation 20040109.0096\nSARS - Worldwide (04): China, new susp. case 20040108.0081\nSARS - worldwide (03): etiology 20040107.0073\nSARS - worldwide (02): China, laboratory confirmed 20040105.0046\nSARS - worldwide (01): China, susp. case 20040102.0015\n2003\n---\nSARS worldwide (179): WHO SRAC 1st report 20031024.2666\nSARS - worldwide (02): cases 20030324.0734\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - worldwide (17) 20030322.0713\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - Worldwide (02) 20030315.0649\nSevere Acute Respiratory Syndrome - Worldwide:alert 20030315.0637\n.....................mpp/pg/sh\n*##########################################################*\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.

The frequency of\ndiarrhoea, admission to intensive care, and mortality differed\nsignificantly between the 2 outbreaks. We carried out genomic\nsequencing for viral isolates from 5 Amoy Gardens patients. The virus\nsequence was identical in 4 of these 5 patients. The sequence data\nfrom one hospital case and the 4 identical community cases had only 3\nnucleotide differences. Alterations in the SARS coronavirus genome\nare unlikely to have caused the distinctive clinical features of the\nAmoy Gardens patients, and these results highlight the importance of\nnon-viral genomic factors in this outbreak.\n(By S S C Chim, S K W Tsui, K C A Chan, T C C Au, E C W Hung, Y K\nTong, R W K Chiu, E K O Ng, P K S Chan, C M Chu, J J Y Sung, J S Tam,\nK P Fung, M M Y Waye, C Y Lee, K Y Yuen, Y M D Lo, and members of the\nCUHK Molecular SARS Research Group.

Field,\nan expert from Australia's Animal Research Institute, told the briefing. The\nresearchers warned that detecting the source of the disease might take years,\nwhich means measures to curb further transmission must be undertaken before\nit is fully understood. \"Obviously we can't wait until we've got the whole\njigsaw together before action is taken,\" said Field. \"So really we have to\nlook at the best information we've got at the time in terms of risk and\nrespond according to that.\"\nCurbing further threats from SARS could result in restrictions on consumption\nof certain types of wildlife known to be infected, despite inconclusive data\non whether the species is capable of transmitting the sometimes-fatal illness\nto humans, he said.\nAfter SARS emerged in Guangdong province in 2002, it quickly spread to become\na global menace, leaving more than 800 dead from 8000 infections in 32\ncountries. Some 349 of the fatalities and 5327 of the infections were\nrecorded in China. Although China has formally declared victory over SARS\nand the last patients have been discharged from hospital, many in the world's\nmost populous country remain wary that the epidemic could bounce back. And\neven if the world has not seen the reemergence of SARS by New Year 2004, it\ndoes not mean the danger is entirely over, experts warned. \"We need to\nrecognize that if it doesn't return this year, that doesn't mean it will\nnever return,\" Field told the briefing.\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) said Thursday it would train thousands\nof medical workers in China, as fears linger that SARS could strike again\nthis year once cold weather sets in.

The date of isolation of this case was 6 Jun 2003.\n[B] Update 91 SARS research: the effect of patents and patent applications\n30 Jun 2003\n<http://www.who.int/csr/don/2003_06_30/en/>\nAs no new probable cases of SARS have been reported anywhere in the world\nsince 15 Jun 2003, WHO is moving from an emergency response to a\nresearch-based agenda aimed at protecting the world against any future\nresurgence of SARS.\nThe world must be considered vulnerable to a return of SARS pending better\nunderstanding of the origins of the virus and the circumstances that\nallowed it to jump from an animal host or environmental source to infect\nhumans. Without such an understanding, predictions of the future evolution\nof the outbreak including its end cannot be made with certainty.\nThe SARS coronavirus was detected within a month by a virtual network of\nlaboratories, working around the clock. The complete sequencing of the\nvirus genome followed almost immediately.\nThese breakthroughs have supported progress in the development of\ndiagnostic tests and greatly facilitated the investigation of unusual\noutbreaks, such as the Amoy Gardens housing cluster that affected more than\n320 persons in late March 2003. They also facilitated initial efforts to\nlink an animal species with the first human cases, which were detected in\nsouthern China in mid-November of last year [2002].\nFurther progress in the scientific understanding of SARS will depend on\ncontinued international collaboration. WHO is establishing an additional\nnetwork to expedite much-needed animal studies.\nWHO also intends to monitor the effects of patents and patent applications\non the speed with which SARS diagnostic tests, treatments, and vaccines are\ndeveloped and made available for use, and on the manner in which prices are\nset for these technologies.\nAt the moment, it is too early to know all the effects that the patenting\nof SARS-related discoveries will have. However, the filing of patent\napplications does not in itself erect any barriers to continued scientific\ncollaboration on SARS.\nThe defensive use of patents can be a legitimate part of a researcher's\nefforts to make a discovery, and related discoveries in the future, widely\navailable to other researchers, in the best collaborative tradition of\nbiomedical science.\nIn the longer term, the manner in which SARS patent rights are pursued\ncould have a profound effect on the willingness of researchers and public\nhealth officials to collaborate during future outbreaks of new infectious\ndiseases.\nWHO will therefore examine whether the terms of reference for such\ncollaborations need to be modified to ensure that the credit for any\nintellectual property developed is appropriately attributed, that revenues\nderived from licensing such property are devoted to suitable uses, and that\nlegitimate rewards for innovative efforts do not impose undue burdens on\nefforts to make tests, therapies, and preventive measures available to all.\nAs SARS has clearly demonstrated, the appearance of a new disease in a\nhighly mobile, interconnected, and interdependent world can have serious\nrepercussions outside the health sector and far beyond the areas worst hit\nby the outbreak.

Without such an understanding, predictions of the future evolution\nof the outbreak including its end cannot be made with certainty.\nThe SARS coronavirus was detected within a month by a virtual network of\nlaboratories, working around the clock. The complete sequencing of the\nvirus genome followed almost immediately.\nThese breakthroughs have supported progress in the development of\ndiagnostic tests and greatly facilitated the investigation of unusual\noutbreaks, such as the Amoy Gardens housing cluster that affected more than\n320 persons in late March 2003. They also facilitated initial efforts to\nlink an animal species with the first human cases, which were detected in\nsouthern China in mid-November of last year [2002].\nFurther progress in the scientific understanding of SARS will depend on\ncontinued international collaboration. WHO is establishing an additional\nnetwork to expedite much-needed animal studies.\nWHO also intends to monitor the effects of patents and patent applications\non the speed with which SARS diagnostic tests, treatments, and vaccines are\ndeveloped and made available for use, and on the manner in which prices are\nset for these technologies.\nAt the moment, it is too early to know all the effects that the patenting\nof SARS-related discoveries will have. However, the filing of patent\napplications does not in itself erect any barriers to continued scientific\ncollaboration on SARS.\nThe defensive use of patents can be a legitimate part of a researcher's\nefforts to make a discovery, and related discoveries in the future, widely\navailable to other researchers, in the best collaborative tradition of\nbiomedical science.\nIn the longer term, the manner in which SARS patent rights are pursued\ncould have a profound effect on the willingness of researchers and public\nhealth officials to collaborate during future outbreaks of new infectious\ndiseases.\nWHO will therefore examine whether the terms of reference for such\ncollaborations need to be modified to ensure that the credit for any\nintellectual property developed is appropriately attributed, that revenues\nderived from licensing such property are devoted to suitable uses, and that\nlegitimate rewards for innovative efforts do not impose undue burdens on\nefforts to make tests, therapies, and preventive measures available to all.\nAs SARS has clearly demonstrated, the appearance of a new disease in a\nhighly mobile, interconnected, and interdependent world can have serious\nrepercussions outside the health sector and far beyond the areas worst hit\nby the outbreak.

The date of isolation of this case was 6 Jun 2003.\n[B] Update 91 SARS research: the effect of patents and patent applications\n30 Jun 2003\n<http://www.who.int/csr/don/2003_06_30/en/>\nAs no new probable cases of SARS have been reported anywhere in the world\nsince 15 Jun 2003, WHO is moving from an emergency response to a\nresearch-based agenda aimed at protecting the world against any future\nresurgence of SARS.\nThe world must be considered vulnerable to a return of SARS pending better\nunderstanding of the origins of the virus and the circumstances that\nallowed it to jump from an animal host or environmental source to infect\nhumans. Without such an understanding, predictions of the future evolution\nof the outbreak including its end cannot be made with certainty.\nThe SARS coronavirus was detected within a month by a virtual network of\nlaboratories, working around the clock. The complete sequencing of the\nvirus genome followed almost immediately.\nThese breakthroughs have supported progress in the development of\ndiagnostic tests and greatly facilitated the investigation of unusual\noutbreaks, such as the Amoy Gardens housing cluster that affected more than\n320 persons in late March 2003. They also facilitated initial efforts to\nlink an animal species with the first human cases, which were detected in\nsouthern China in mid-November of last year [2002].\nFurther progress in the scientific understanding of SARS will depend on\ncontinued international collaboration. WHO is establishing an additional\nnetwork to expedite much-needed animal studies.\nWHO also intends to monitor the effects of patents and patent applications\non the speed with which SARS diagnostic tests, treatments, and vaccines are\ndeveloped and made available for use, and on the manner in which prices are\nset for these technologies.\nAt the moment, it is too early to know all the effects that the patenting\nof SARS-related discoveries will have. However, the filing of patent\napplications does not in itself erect any barriers to continued scientific\ncollaboration on SARS.\nThe defensive use of patents can be a legitimate part of a researcher's\nefforts to make a discovery, and related discoveries in the future, widely\navailable to other researchers, in the best collaborative tradition of\nbiomedical science.\nIn the longer term, the manner in which SARS patent rights are pursued\ncould have a profound effect on the willingness of researchers and public\nhealth officials to collaborate during future outbreaks of new infectious\ndiseases.\nWHO will therefore examine whether the terms of reference for such\ncollaborations need to be modified to ensure that the credit for any\nintellectual property developed is appropriately attributed, that revenues\nderived from licensing such property are devoted to suitable uses, and that\nlegitimate rewards for innovative efforts do not impose undue burdens on\nefforts to make tests, therapies, and preventive measures available to all.\nAs SARS has clearly demonstrated, the appearance of a new disease in a\nhighly mobile, interconnected, and interdependent world can have serious\nrepercussions outside the health sector and far beyond the areas worst hit\nby the outbreak. This sense of shared vulnerability is considered a strong\nmotivation for continued international collaboration.\n******\n[2]\nDate: 30 Jun 2003\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: Health Canada [edited]\n<http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/pphb-dgspsp/sars-sras/cn-cc/numbers.html>\n\nAs of 30 Jun 2003 there are no new reports of either suspected or probable\ncases in Canada.

Without such an understanding, predictions of the future evolution\nof the outbreak including its end cannot be made with certainty.\nThe SARS coronavirus was detected within a month by a virtual network of\nlaboratories, working around the clock. The complete sequencing of the\nvirus genome followed almost immediately.\nThese breakthroughs have supported progress in the development of\ndiagnostic tests and greatly facilitated the investigation of unusual\noutbreaks, such as the Amoy Gardens housing cluster that affected more than\n320 persons in late March 2003. They also facilitated initial efforts to\nlink an animal species with the first human cases, which were detected in\nsouthern China in mid-November of last year [2002].\nFurther progress in the scientific understanding of SARS will depend on\ncontinued international collaboration. WHO is establishing an additional\nnetwork to expedite much-needed animal studies.\nWHO also intends to monitor the effects of patents and patent applications\non the speed with which SARS diagnostic tests, treatments, and vaccines are\ndeveloped and made available for use, and on the manner in which prices are\nset for these technologies.\nAt the moment, it is too early to know all the effects that the patenting\nof SARS-related discoveries will have. However, the filing of patent\napplications does not in itself erect any barriers to continued scientific\ncollaboration on SARS.\nThe defensive use of patents can be a legitimate part of a researcher's\nefforts to make a discovery, and related discoveries in the future, widely\navailable to other researchers, in the best collaborative tradition of\nbiomedical science.\nIn the longer term, the manner in which SARS patent rights are pursued\ncould have a profound effect on the willingness of researchers and public\nhealth officials to collaborate during future outbreaks of new infectious\ndiseases.\nWHO will therefore examine whether the terms of reference for such\ncollaborations need to be modified to ensure that the credit for any\nintellectual property developed is appropriately attributed, that revenues\nderived from licensing such property are devoted to suitable uses, and that\nlegitimate rewards for innovative efforts do not impose undue burdens on\nefforts to make tests, therapies, and preventive measures available to all.\nAs SARS has clearly demonstrated, the appearance of a new disease in a\nhighly mobile, interconnected, and interdependent world can have serious\nrepercussions outside the health sector and far beyond the areas worst hit\nby the outbreak. This sense of shared vulnerability is considered a strong\nmotivation for continued international collaboration.\n******\n[2]\nDate: 30 Jun 2003\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: Health Canada [edited]\n<http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/pphb-dgspsp/sars-sras/cn-cc/numbers.html>\n\nAs of 30 Jun 2003 there are no new reports of either suspected or probable\ncases in Canada.

The date\nof onset of the most recent probable SARS case in Canada was 12 Jun 2003,\nthe last date of isolation of a probable SARS case was also 12 Jun 2003.\nThe date of onset of the most recent probable SARS case in China was 3 Jun\n2003. The date of isolation of this case was 6 Jun 2003.\n[B] Update 91 SARS research: the effect of patents and patent applications\n30 Jun 2003\n<http://www.who.int/csr/don/2003_06_30/en/>\nAs no new probable cases of SARS have been reported anywhere in the world\nsince 15 Jun 2003, WHO is moving from an emergency response to a\nresearch-based agenda aimed at protecting the world against any future\nresurgence of SARS.\nThe world must be considered vulnerable to a return of SARS pending better\nunderstanding of the origins of the virus and the circumstances that\nallowed it to jump from an animal host or environmental source to infect\nhumans. Without such an understanding, predictions of the future evolution\nof the outbreak including its end cannot be made with certainty.\nThe SARS coronavirus was detected within a month by a virtual network of\nlaboratories, working around the clock. The complete sequencing of the\nvirus genome followed almost immediately.\nThese breakthroughs have supported progress in the development of\ndiagnostic tests and greatly facilitated the investigation of unusual\noutbreaks, such as the Amoy Gardens housing cluster that affected more than\n320 persons in late March 2003. They also facilitated initial efforts to\nlink an animal species with the first human cases, which were detected in\nsouthern China in mid-November of last year [2002].\nFurther progress in the scientific understanding of SARS will depend on\ncontinued international collaboration. WHO is establishing an additional\nnetwork to expedite much-needed animal studies.\nWHO also intends to monitor the effects of patents and patent applications\non the speed with which SARS diagnostic tests, treatments, and vaccines are\ndeveloped and made available for use, and on the manner in which prices are\nset for these technologies.\nAt the moment, it is too early to know all the effects that the patenting\nof SARS-related discoveries will have. However, the filing of patent\napplications does not in itself erect any barriers to continued scientific\ncollaboration on SARS.\nThe defensive use of patents can be a legitimate part of a researcher's\nefforts to make a discovery, and related discoveries in the future, widely\navailable to other researchers, in the best collaborative tradition of\nbiomedical science.\nIn the longer term, the manner in which SARS patent rights are pursued\ncould have a profound effect on the willingness of researchers and public\nhealth officials to collaborate during future outbreaks of new infectious\ndiseases.\nWHO will therefore examine whether the terms of reference for such\ncollaborations need to be modified to ensure that the credit for any\nintellectual property developed is appropriately attributed, that revenues\nderived from licensing such property are devoted to suitable uses, and that\nlegitimate rewards for innovative efforts do not impose undue burdens on\nefforts to make tests, therapies, and preventive measures available to all.\nAs SARS has clearly demonstrated, the appearance of a new disease in a\nhighly mobile, interconnected, and interdependent world can have serious\nrepercussions outside the health sector and far beyond the areas worst hit\nby the outbreak. This sense of shared vulnerability is considered a strong\nmotivation for continued international collaboration.\n******\n[2]\nDate: 30 Jun 2003\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: Health Canada [edited]\n<http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/pphb-dgspsp/sars-sras/cn-cc/numbers.html>\n\nAs of 30 Jun 2003 there are no new reports of either suspected or probable\ncases in Canada.

Yet by 10 Feb 2003 news of a \"fatal flu in Guangdong\" had\nreached 120 million people through text messaging, say some reports, and an\nuntold extra number through email and internet chatrooms. Chinese\nauthorities had little choice but to acknowledge the outbreak and try to\nrestore calm. The government had been taught a painful lesson about\ncontrolling the news in a burgeoning high-tech society.\nBy mid-February 2003, officials began complaining about the use of text\nmessaging to spread \"rumours\", deeming them subversive activity and a\nthreat to stability. Then they began arresting people. By the end of May\n2003, 117 people in 17 provinces had been arrested and charged with\ndisturbing social order by spreading SARS-related rumours, the Xinhua news\nagency reported. But [it was not stated] how those rumours were spread.\nWith its control slipping, the government's response [to the situation] has\nbeen to combine cutting-edge technology with repression. Its technology\nallows it, for example, to search the country's entire volume of email\ntraffic for words such as \"Falungong\", or to monitor any individual's text\nmessages. Anyone snared in its high-tech web can expect surveillance,\nintimidation, arrest, and prison. The publicity surrounding the arrests and\nprison sentences helps the government achieve what experts say is its\nstrategy of creating a climate of fear in which the people begin censoring\nthemselves.\n\"The cyberpolice, which have tens of thousands of members, are capable of\narresting internet users anywhere in the country if they send a few\nmessages considered 'subversive' or likely to 'jeopardise the state's\nsecurity',\" wrote the watchdog group Reporters Without Borders in a report\nreleased last month. One topic subject to nearly blanket censorship in\nearly April 2003 was SARS. On 10 Apr 2003, a researcher posted a message on\na sina.com.cn forum containing the word SARS and just calling on the\nChinese government to work closely with Hong Kong to arrest the epidemic.\nThe message did not appear. A second message about SARS was submitted to\nthe site 5 days later. It met the same fate.\n\"The authorities seem to have asked the websites to add the term SARS to\nthe long list of banned words. So no criticism of the government's handling\nof the SARS crisis can be seen on the most popular sites.\"\n[byline: Henry Hoenig, in Beijing]\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[ProMED-mail supports the free exchange of information relating to\noutbreaks of infectious diseases and protests in the strongest possible\nterms the imprisonment of citizens of any country for reporting such\ninformation to the world. ProMED-mail policy is NOT to criticize any\ngovernment UNLESS it arrests and imprisons people for the above reason. Dr\nDessy Mendoza of Cuba was imprisoned in 1997 for talking to foreign news\nmedia about the epidemic of dengue in Santiago de Cuba. ProMED-mail\nprotested publicly (see references below), and our posts were picked up by\nAmnesty International and Physicians for Human Rights, who intervened on\nhis behalf. The Pope's visit to Cuba eventually got him out after 2 years,\nwith his health broken.\nIt is now evident that China's suppression of news about SARS in south\nChina helped fuel a global epidemic that could have been controlled more\nquickly, with fewer fatalities and much less economic damage, if news of\nthat outbreak had been reported rapidly and fully to the world. This\nprinciple, that rapid dissemination of accurate information on emerging\ndiseases and outbreaks will lead to better public health, is the basis of\nProMED-mail's existence.\nProMED calls on the Chinese government to immediately and unconditionally\nrelease any people imprisoned for trying to get the news on SARS out. - Mod.LM]\nSee Also\n1998\n---\nOfficial secrets and public health (02) 19980625.1180\nOfficial secrets and public health 19980622.1162\n1997\n---\nDengue/DHF - Cuba: doctor sentenced 19971125.2360\n......................jw/lm/sh\n*##########################################################*\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.

The briefing\nfollowed a day of intensive meetings during which WHO officials reviewed\ndata and statistics from selected provinces, voiced their concerns, and\nreceived frank and detailed answers.\n\nDr Heymann praised the openness with which the WHO team was welcomed by the\nMinistry of Health, and described the measures now in place to control and\nprevent SARS as \u0093excellent\u0094. He cited the high level of commitment and\ndetermination at all levels of the health system as largely responsible for\nthe dramatic recent decline in the number of cases seen throughout mainland\nChina.\n\nOne purpose of the visit was to determine how China had succeeded in\nbringing down the number of cases so rapidly, and to encourage officials to\nshare their experiences with the rest of the world. Indications of the\neffectiveness of control measures, cited by Dr Heymann, include the very\nshort time now occurring between the onset of symptoms and the detection\nand isolation of cases, and the speed and efficiency of contact tracing.\nSuch measures are important as they limit the amount of time that an\ninfected person is capable of spreading the virus to others and thus bring\ncontrol efforts closer to the stage when the chain of person-to-person\ntransmission can be broken.\n\nOther effective measures include systems for both passive and active\nsurveillance, such as fever checks at train and bus stations and airports,\na nationwide mass media campaign to inform and educate the public, and a\nvery large number of fever clinics to assess those who suspect they may\nhave symptoms. \u0093We\u0092ve seen that there has been a massive effort to\nmobilize the population both in urban and rural areas across the country,\nencouraging people to monitor themselves for fever and to ensure that SARS\ncases are quickly identified, isolated and treated.\u0094\n\nSpecific concerns expressed by the WHO team include the lack of a\nsustainable surveillance system that can be relied on to detect the first\nhints of a resurgence of cases, some delays in meeting WHO requests for\nfurther information, and wide variations in application of the national\ncase definitions, which can lead to under-reporting of cases. Some problems\nrelated to prompt sharing and analysis of data are considered to arise from\ninstitutional and administrative problems, particularly concerning the\ninformation flow from provinces to the central level.\n\nAnother major concern is the large number of cases that have no known\nsource of exposure, thus making it extremely difficult to trace patterns of\ntransmission. In Beijing, the number of cases with no known contact with a\nSARS patient has recently increased from 50 percent to more than 70 percent.\n\nIn the interest of protecting against a further resurgence of cases, WHO\nofficials singled out strengthening of surveillance capacity as the top\npriority. Experience to date has shown that a single case, especially if\nhighly infectious, can rapidly ignite an explosive outbreak.\n\n\u0093With SARS seemingly on the decline for now, there is a great need to\nstrengthen the SARS control and surveillance system in China,\u0094 said Dr\nBekedam. \u0093The system now in place grew out of an emergency response and has\nto be strengthened for the long run.\u0094 He expressed doubt that the present\nsystem would be strong enough \u0093to hold back the tide\u0094 when confronted with\na resurgence of the disease.\n\nIn his assessment of the long-term SARS situation in China, Dr Heymann also\nstressed the need for systematic studies of the origins of SARS. \u0093We still\ndon\u0092t know exactly where SARS came from, or how it was transferred to the\nhuman population. We don\u0092t know if this disease is seasonal and will\ndecrease this year but come back next year.\u0094 Until proper research into\nthe origins of SARS has been conducted, it will be impossible to predict\nwhen the conditions that first allowed the virus to jump to humans from a\nsuspected animal reservoir might be repeated in the near or distant future.\n\nWHO initial assessments of the SARS situation in China, issued in late\nApril [2003] following a visit to Guangdong Province, expressed serious\nconcern over the lack of urgency in reporting cases of SARS in China, and\ncriticized the government for not immediately treating the outbreak as a\npublic health emergency requiring extraordinary measures for its\ncontrol. Dr Heymann and other members of the WHO team are now satisfied\nthat these measures are in place, at least for the immediate response to\nSARS. Recent visits to selected provinces, jointly conducted by the Chinese\nMinistry of Health and WHO, found a high level of public awareness of SARS,\nits symptoms and mode of transmission, and the need for twice-daily fever\nchecks.\n\nChina is regarded as the epicentre of the SARS outbreak. The country was\nhome to the first cases, detected in mid-November of last year [2002], and\npresently accounts for almost two thirds of all reported cases worldwide.\nThe WHO visit was arranged to secure reassurance that control measures in\nthis vast country are adequate to continue the downward trends in cases\nand, equally important, to ensure that a sustainable system is in place to\ndetect and contain a resurgence of cases. WHO is also anxious to ensure\nthat the considerable knowledge and experience acquired in managing the\nlargest SARS outbreak on record is shared for the benefit of all countries.\n\nThe SARS outbreak has revealed substantial weaknesses in the disease\nsurveillance system in China. When investment in health infrastructure is\nneglected, conditions are ripe for the unchecked spread of any\nepidemic-prone disease, often at tremendous cost to a nation\u0092s economy. In\nthe view of WHO, the surveillance system in China needs to be made more\nflexible and capable of a much more rapid and consistent response to any\nnew infectious disease threat.\n\nDuring the visit, Chinese officials expressed deep concern about the\ncountry\u0092s capacity to deal with the next influenza season against a\nbackground of possible SARS cases. The presence of influenza could greatly\ncomplicate the detection and accurate diagnosis of SARS cases, while also\nincreasing the caseload of suspect cases considerably.\n\nThe containment of SARS remains the overriding objective of WHO. If SARS is\nnot contained, the world will face a situation in which every case of\natypical pneumonia, and every hospital-based cluster of febrile patients\nwith respiratory systems will have the potential to rouse suspicions of\nSARS and spark widespread panic.\n\nIn an earlier report, a WHO assessment team reached the following\nconclusion: \u0093If SARS is not brought under control in China, there will be\nno chance of controlling the global threat of SARS. Achieving control of\nSARS is a major challenge especially in a country as large and diverse as\nChina. Effective disease control and reporting are the cornerstone of any\nstrategy to do this.\u0094\n\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[2]\nDate: 12 Jun 2003\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: CDC Taiwan [edited]\n<http://www.cdc.gov.tw/sarsen/>\n\nNo. new probable cases reported: 2\nCumulative no. cases: 688\n(cumulative no. cases in last update: 687)\nExplanation: 1 previously reported prob. case excluded by reporting MD.\n\nCumulative no.

There were no new cases reported from Hong Kong.\n\nThe report on the ongoing outbreak of SARS in Toronto is a sobering\nreminder of the difficulties in detection of cases in the absence of an\nimmediately apparent epidemiologic link to other cases. It begs the\nquestion at what point in time following presumed/apparent interruption of\ntransmission in an area that had had local transmission (greater than or\nequal to 20 days, using the standard \"2 incubation periods\" for the\ndefinition) an area can presume that atypical pneumonias are most probably\nnot due to SARS and therefore SARS level infection control procedures can\nbe dropped.

Also in\nattendance were Dr Qi Ziaoqiu, Director-General of the Department of\nDisease Control in the Chinese Ministry of Health, and Dr Henk Bekedam, WHO\nRepresentative to China.\n\nThe briefing marked the first joint news conference between high-ranking\nChinese and WHO officials since the SARS outbreak began. The briefing\nfollowed a day of intensive meetings during which WHO officials reviewed\ndata and statistics from selected provinces, voiced their concerns, and\nreceived frank and detailed answers.\n\nDr Heymann praised the openness with which the WHO team was welcomed by the\nMinistry of Health, and described the measures now in place to control and\nprevent SARS as \u0093excellent\u0094. He cited the high level of commitment and\ndetermination at all levels of the health system as largely responsible for\nthe dramatic recent decline in the number of cases seen throughout mainland\nChina.\n\nOne purpose of the visit was to determine how China had succeeded in\nbringing down the number of cases so rapidly, and to encourage officials to\nshare their experiences with the rest of the world. Indications of the\neffectiveness of control measures, cited by Dr Heymann, include the very\nshort time now occurring between the onset of symptoms and the detection\nand isolation of cases, and the speed and efficiency of contact tracing.\nSuch measures are important as they limit the amount of time that an\ninfected person is capable of spreading the virus to others and thus bring\ncontrol efforts closer to the stage when the chain of person-to-person\ntransmission can be broken.\n\nOther effective measures include systems for both passive and active\nsurveillance, such as fever checks at train and bus stations and airports,\na nationwide mass media campaign to inform and educate the public, and a\nvery large number of fever clinics to assess those who suspect they may\nhave symptoms. \u0093We\u0092ve seen that there has been a massive effort to\nmobilize the population both in urban and rural areas across the country,\nencouraging people to monitor themselves for fever and to ensure that SARS\ncases are quickly identified, isolated and treated.\u0094\n\nSpecific concerns expressed by the WHO team include the lack of a\nsustainable surveillance system that can be relied on to detect the first\nhints of a resurgence of cases, some delays in meeting WHO requests for\nfurther information, and wide variations in application of the national\ncase definitions, which can lead to under-reporting of cases. Some problems\nrelated to prompt sharing and analysis of data are considered to arise from\ninstitutional and administrative problems, particularly concerning the\ninformation flow from provinces to the central level.\n\nAnother major concern is the large number of cases that have no known\nsource of exposure, thus making it extremely difficult to trace patterns of\ntransmission. In Beijing, the number of cases with no known contact with a\nSARS patient has recently increased from 50 percent to more than 70 percent.\n\nIn the interest of protecting against a further resurgence of cases, WHO\nofficials singled out strengthening of surveillance capacity as the top\npriority. Experience to date has shown that a single case, especially if\nhighly infectious, can rapidly ignite an explosive outbreak.\n\n\u0093With SARS seemingly on the decline for now, there is a great need to\nstrengthen the SARS control and surveillance system in China,\u0094 said Dr\nBekedam. \u0093The system now in place grew out of an emergency response and has\nto be strengthened for the long run.\u0094 He expressed doubt that the present\nsystem would be strong enough \u0093to hold back the tide\u0094 when confronted with\na resurgence of the disease.\n\nIn his assessment of the long-term SARS situation in China, Dr Heymann also\nstressed the need for systematic studies of the origins of SARS. \u0093We still\ndon\u0092t know exactly where SARS came from, or how it was transferred to the\nhuman population. We don\u0092t know if this disease is seasonal and will\ndecrease this year but come back next year.\u0094 Until proper research into\nthe origins of SARS has been conducted, it will be impossible to predict\nwhen the conditions that first allowed the virus to jump to humans from a\nsuspected animal reservoir might be repeated in the near or distant future.\n\nWHO initial assessments of the SARS situation in China, issued in late\nApril [2003] following a visit to Guangdong Province, expressed serious\nconcern over the lack of urgency in reporting cases of SARS in China, and\ncriticized the government for not immediately treating the outbreak as a\npublic health emergency requiring extraordinary measures for its\ncontrol. Dr Heymann and other members of the WHO team are now satisfied\nthat these measures are in place, at least for the immediate response to\nSARS. Recent visits to selected provinces, jointly conducted by the Chinese\nMinistry of Health and WHO, found a high level of public awareness of SARS,\nits symptoms and mode of transmission, and the need for twice-daily fever\nchecks.\n\nChina is regarded as the epicentre of the SARS outbreak. The country was\nhome to the first cases, detected in mid-November of last year [2002], and\npresently accounts for almost two thirds of all reported cases worldwide.\nThe WHO visit was arranged to secure reassurance that control measures in\nthis vast country are adequate to continue the downward trends in cases\nand, equally important, to ensure that a sustainable system is in place to\ndetect and contain a resurgence of cases. WHO is also anxious to ensure\nthat the considerable knowledge and experience acquired in managing the\nlargest SARS outbreak on record is shared for the benefit of all countries.\n\nThe SARS outbreak has revealed substantial weaknesses in the disease\nsurveillance system in China. When investment in health infrastructure is\nneglected, conditions are ripe for the unchecked spread of any\nepidemic-prone disease, often at tremendous cost to a nation\u0092s economy. In\nthe view of WHO, the surveillance system in China needs to be made more\nflexible and capable of a much more rapid and consistent response to any\nnew infectious disease threat.\n\nDuring the visit, Chinese officials expressed deep concern about the\ncountry\u0092s capacity to deal with the next influenza season against a\nbackground of possible SARS cases. The presence of influenza could greatly\ncomplicate the detection and accurate diagnosis of SARS cases, while also\nincreasing the caseload of suspect cases considerably.\n\nThe containment of SARS remains the overriding objective of WHO. If SARS is\nnot contained, the world will face a situation in which every case of\natypical pneumonia, and every hospital-based cluster of febrile patients\nwith respiratory systems will have the potential to rouse suspicions of\nSARS and spark widespread panic.\n\nIn an earlier report, a WHO assessment team reached the following\nconclusion: \u0093If SARS is not brought under control in China, there will be\nno chance of controlling the global threat of SARS. Achieving control of\nSARS is a major challenge especially in a country as large and diverse as\nChina. Effective disease control and reporting are the cornerstone of any\nstrategy to do this.\u0094\n\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[2]\nDate: 12 Jun 2003\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: CDC Taiwan [edited]\n<http://www.cdc.gov.tw/sarsen/>\n\nNo. new probable cases reported: 2\nCumulative no. cases: 688\n(cumulative no. cases in last update: 687)\nExplanation: 1 previously reported prob. case excluded by reporting MD.\n\nCumulative no.

There were no new cases reported from Hong Kong.\n\nThe report on the ongoing outbreak of SARS in Toronto is a sobering\nreminder of the difficulties in detection of cases in the absence of an\nimmediately apparent epidemiologic link to other cases. It begs the\nquestion at what point in time following presumed/apparent interruption of\ntransmission in an area that had had local transmission (greater than or\nequal to 20 days, using the standard \"2 incubation periods\" for the\ndefinition) an area can presume that atypical pneumonias are most probably\nnot due to SARS and therefore SARS level infection control procedures can\nbe dropped. Not an easy question to answer given the observed recurrence\nof active transmission in Ontario. - Mod.MPP]\nSee Also\nSARS - worldwide (143): cases 20030611.1441\nSARS - worldwide (142): cases 20030610.1434\nSARS - worldwide (141): cases 20030609.1423\nSARS - worldwide (140): cases 20030608.1419\nSARS - worldwide (139): cases 20030607.1409\nSARS - worldwide (93): etiology 20030505.1122\nSARS - worldwide (87): case definition and diagnostics 20030502.1103\nSARS - worldwide (85): clinical aspects 20030501.1094\nSARS - worldwide (69): diagnostic testing 20030425.1015\nSARS - worldwide (58): diagnostic testing 20030419.0958\nSARS - worldwide (51): etiology 20030416.0925\nSARS - worldwide (42): WHO historical overview 20030411.0878\nSARS - worldwide (38): etiology 20030410.0869\nSARS - Worldwide (34): etiology 20030408.0857\nSARS - worldwide (13): etiology 20030327.0758\nSARS - worldwide (04): etiology 20030325.0737\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - worldwide (17) 20030322.0713\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - Worldwide: alert (03) 20030316.0660\nSevere Acute Respiratory Syndrome - Worldwide 20030315.0637\nAcute respiratory syndrome - Canada (Ontario) 20030314.0631\nAcute respiratory syndrome - East Asia 20030314.0630\nAcute respiratory syndrome - China (HK), VietNam (03) 20030313.0624\nUndiagnosed illness - Vietnam (Hanoi): RFI 20030311.0595\nPneumonia - China (Guangdong) (07) 20030221.0452\nPneumonia - China (Guangdong): RFI 20030210.0357\n.........................mpp/jw\n\n*##########################################################*\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.

Also in\nattendance were Dr Qi Ziaoqiu, Director-General of the Department of\nDisease Control in the Chinese Ministry of Health, and Dr Henk Bekedam, WHO\nRepresentative to China.\n\nThe briefing marked the first joint news conference between high-ranking\nChinese and WHO officials since the SARS outbreak began. The briefing\nfollowed a day of intensive meetings during which WHO officials reviewed\ndata and statistics from selected provinces, voiced their concerns, and\nreceived frank and detailed answers.\n\nDr Heymann praised the openness with which the WHO team was welcomed by the\nMinistry of Health, and described the measures now in place to control and\nprevent SARS as \u0093excellent\u0094. He cited the high level of commitment and\ndetermination at all levels of the health system as largely responsible for\nthe dramatic recent decline in the number of cases seen throughout mainland\nChina.\n\nOne purpose of the visit was to determine how China had succeeded in\nbringing down the number of cases so rapidly, and to encourage officials to\nshare their experiences with the rest of the world. Indications of the\neffectiveness of control measures, cited by Dr Heymann, include the very\nshort time now occurring between the onset of symptoms and the detection\nand isolation of cases, and the speed and efficiency of contact tracing.\nSuch measures are important as they limit the amount of time that an\ninfected person is capable of spreading the virus to others and thus bring\ncontrol efforts closer to the stage when the chain of person-to-person\ntransmission can be broken.\n\nOther effective measures include systems for both passive and active\nsurveillance, such as fever checks at train and bus stations and airports,\na nationwide mass media campaign to inform and educate the public, and a\nvery large number of fever clinics to assess those who suspect they may\nhave symptoms. \u0093We\u0092ve seen that there has been a massive effort to\nmobilize the population both in urban and rural areas across the country,\nencouraging people to monitor themselves for fever and to ensure that SARS\ncases are quickly identified, isolated and treated.\u0094\n\nSpecific concerns expressed by the WHO team include the lack of a\nsustainable surveillance system that can be relied on to detect the first\nhints of a resurgence of cases, some delays in meeting WHO requests for\nfurther information, and wide variations in application of the national\ncase definitions, which can lead to under-reporting of cases. Some problems\nrelated to prompt sharing and analysis of data are considered to arise from\ninstitutional and administrative problems, particularly concerning the\ninformation flow from provinces to the central level.\n\nAnother major concern is the large number of cases that have no known\nsource of exposure, thus making it extremely difficult to trace patterns of\ntransmission. In Beijing, the number of cases with no known contact with a\nSARS patient has recently increased from 50 percent to more than 70 percent.\n\nIn the interest of protecting against a further resurgence of cases, WHO\nofficials singled out strengthening of surveillance capacity as the top\npriority. Experience to date has shown that a single case, especially if\nhighly infectious, can rapidly ignite an explosive outbreak.\n\n\u0093With SARS seemingly on the decline for now, there is a great need to\nstrengthen the SARS control and surveillance system in China,\u0094 said Dr\nBekedam. \u0093The system now in place grew out of an emergency response and has\nto be strengthened for the long run.\u0094 He expressed doubt that the present\nsystem would be strong enough \u0093to hold back the tide\u0094 when confronted with\na resurgence of the disease.\n\nIn his assessment of the long-term SARS situation in China, Dr Heymann also\nstressed the need for systematic studies of the origins of SARS. \u0093We still\ndon\u0092t know exactly where SARS came from, or how it was transferred to the\nhuman population. We don\u0092t know if this disease is seasonal and will\ndecrease this year but come back next year.\u0094 Until proper research into\nthe origins of SARS has been conducted, it will be impossible to predict\nwhen the conditions that first allowed the virus to jump to humans from a\nsuspected animal reservoir might be repeated in the near or distant future.\n\nWHO initial assessments of the SARS situation in China, issued in late\nApril [2003] following a visit to Guangdong Province, expressed serious\nconcern over the lack of urgency in reporting cases of SARS in China, and\ncriticized the government for not immediately treating the outbreak as a\npublic health emergency requiring extraordinary measures for its\ncontrol. Dr Heymann and other members of the WHO team are now satisfied\nthat these measures are in place, at least for the immediate response to\nSARS. Recent visits to selected provinces, jointly conducted by the Chinese\nMinistry of Health and WHO, found a high level of public awareness of SARS,\nits symptoms and mode of transmission, and the need for twice-daily fever\nchecks.\n\nChina is regarded as the epicentre of the SARS outbreak. The country was\nhome to the first cases, detected in mid-November of last year [2002], and\npresently accounts for almost two thirds of all reported cases worldwide.\nThe WHO visit was arranged to secure reassurance that control measures in\nthis vast country are adequate to continue the downward trends in cases\nand, equally important, to ensure that a sustainable system is in place to\ndetect and contain a resurgence of cases. WHO is also anxious to ensure\nthat the considerable knowledge and experience acquired in managing the\nlargest SARS outbreak on record is shared for the benefit of all countries.\n\nThe SARS outbreak has revealed substantial weaknesses in the disease\nsurveillance system in China. When investment in health infrastructure is\nneglected, conditions are ripe for the unchecked spread of any\nepidemic-prone disease, often at tremendous cost to a nation\u0092s economy. In\nthe view of WHO, the surveillance system in China needs to be made more\nflexible and capable of a much more rapid and consistent response to any\nnew infectious disease threat.\n\nDuring the visit, Chinese officials expressed deep concern about the\ncountry\u0092s capacity to deal with the next influenza season against a\nbackground of possible SARS cases. The presence of influenza could greatly\ncomplicate the detection and accurate diagnosis of SARS cases, while also\nincreasing the caseload of suspect cases considerably.\n\nThe containment of SARS remains the overriding objective of WHO. If SARS is\nnot contained, the world will face a situation in which every case of\natypical pneumonia, and every hospital-based cluster of febrile patients\nwith respiratory systems will have the potential to rouse suspicions of\nSARS and spark widespread panic.\n\nIn an earlier report, a WHO assessment team reached the following\nconclusion: \u0093If SARS is not brought under control in China, there will be\nno chance of controlling the global threat of SARS. Achieving control of\nSARS is a major challenge especially in a country as large and diverse as\nChina. Effective disease control and reporting are the cornerstone of any\nstrategy to do this.\u0094\n\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[2]\nDate: 12 Jun 2003\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: CDC Taiwan [edited]\n<http://www.cdc.gov.tw/sarsen/>\n\nNo. new probable cases reported: 2\nCumulative no. cases: 688\n(cumulative no. cases in last update: 687)\nExplanation: 1 previously reported prob. case excluded by reporting MD.\n\nCumulative no.

There were no new cases reported from Hong Kong.\n\nThe report on the ongoing outbreak of SARS in Toronto is a sobering\nreminder of the difficulties in detection of cases in the absence of an\nimmediately apparent epidemiologic link to other cases. It begs the\nquestion at what point in time following presumed/apparent interruption of\ntransmission in an area that had had local transmission (greater than or\nequal to 20 days, using the standard \"2 incubation periods\" for the\ndefinition) an area can presume that atypical pneumonias are most probably\nnot due to SARS and therefore SARS level infection control procedures can\nbe dropped.

Also in\nattendance were Dr Qi Ziaoqiu, Director-General of the Department of\nDisease Control in the Chinese Ministry of Health, and Dr Henk Bekedam, WHO\nRepresentative to China.\n\nThe briefing marked the first joint news conference between high-ranking\nChinese and WHO officials since the SARS outbreak began. The briefing\nfollowed a day of intensive meetings during which WHO officials reviewed\ndata and statistics from selected provinces, voiced their concerns, and\nreceived frank and detailed answers.\n\nDr Heymann praised the openness with which the WHO team was welcomed by the\nMinistry of Health, and described the measures now in place to control and\nprevent SARS as \u0093excellent\u0094. He cited the high level of commitment and\ndetermination at all levels of the health system as largely responsible for\nthe dramatic recent decline in the number of cases seen throughout mainland\nChina.\n\nOne purpose of the visit was to determine how China had succeeded in\nbringing down the number of cases so rapidly, and to encourage officials to\nshare their experiences with the rest of the world. Indications of the\neffectiveness of control measures, cited by Dr Heymann, include the very\nshort time now occurring between the onset of symptoms and the detection\nand isolation of cases, and the speed and efficiency of contact tracing.\nSuch measures are important as they limit the amount of time that an\ninfected person is capable of spreading the virus to others and thus bring\ncontrol efforts closer to the stage when the chain of person-to-person\ntransmission can be broken.\n\nOther effective measures include systems for both passive and active\nsurveillance, such as fever checks at train and bus stations and airports,\na nationwide mass media campaign to inform and educate the public, and a\nvery large number of fever clinics to assess those who suspect they may\nhave symptoms. \u0093We\u0092ve seen that there has been a massive effort to\nmobilize the population both in urban and rural areas across the country,\nencouraging people to monitor themselves for fever and to ensure that SARS\ncases are quickly identified, isolated and treated.\u0094\n\nSpecific concerns expressed by the WHO team include the lack of a\nsustainable surveillance system that can be relied on to detect the first\nhints of a resurgence of cases, some delays in meeting WHO requests for\nfurther information, and wide variations in application of the national\ncase definitions, which can lead to under-reporting of cases. Some problems\nrelated to prompt sharing and analysis of data are considered to arise from\ninstitutional and administrative problems, particularly concerning the\ninformation flow from provinces to the central level.\n\nAnother major concern is the large number of cases that have no known\nsource of exposure, thus making it extremely difficult to trace patterns of\ntransmission. In Beijing, the number of cases with no known contact with a\nSARS patient has recently increased from 50 percent to more than 70 percent.\n\nIn the interest of protecting against a further resurgence of cases, WHO\nofficials singled out strengthening of surveillance capacity as the top\npriority. Experience to date has shown that a single case, especially if\nhighly infectious, can rapidly ignite an explosive outbreak.\n\n\u0093With SARS seemingly on the decline for now, there is a great need to\nstrengthen the SARS control and surveillance system in China,\u0094 said Dr\nBekedam. \u0093The system now in place grew out of an emergency response and has\nto be strengthened for the long run.\u0094 He expressed doubt that the present\nsystem would be strong enough \u0093to hold back the tide\u0094 when confronted with\na resurgence of the disease.\n\nIn his assessment of the long-term SARS situation in China, Dr Heymann also\nstressed the need for systematic studies of the origins of SARS. \u0093We still\ndon\u0092t know exactly where SARS came from, or how it was transferred to the\nhuman population. We don\u0092t know if this disease is seasonal and will\ndecrease this year but come back next year.\u0094 Until proper research into\nthe origins of SARS has been conducted, it will be impossible to predict\nwhen the conditions that first allowed the virus to jump to humans from a\nsuspected animal reservoir might be repeated in the near or distant future.\n\nWHO initial assessments of the SARS situation in China, issued in late\nApril [2003] following a visit to Guangdong Province, expressed serious\nconcern over the lack of urgency in reporting cases of SARS in China, and\ncriticized the government for not immediately treating the outbreak as a\npublic health emergency requiring extraordinary measures for its\ncontrol. Dr Heymann and other members of the WHO team are now satisfied\nthat these measures are in place, at least for the immediate response to\nSARS. Recent visits to selected provinces, jointly conducted by the Chinese\nMinistry of Health and WHO, found a high level of public awareness of SARS,\nits symptoms and mode of transmission, and the need for twice-daily fever\nchecks.\n\nChina is regarded as the epicentre of the SARS outbreak. The country was\nhome to the first cases, detected in mid-November of last year [2002], and\npresently accounts for almost two thirds of all reported cases worldwide.\nThe WHO visit was arranged to secure reassurance that control measures in\nthis vast country are adequate to continue the downward trends in cases\nand, equally important, to ensure that a sustainable system is in place to\ndetect and contain a resurgence of cases. WHO is also anxious to ensure\nthat the considerable knowledge and experience acquired in managing the\nlargest SARS outbreak on record is shared for the benefit of all countries.\n\nThe SARS outbreak has revealed substantial weaknesses in the disease\nsurveillance system in China. When investment in health infrastructure is\nneglected, conditions are ripe for the unchecked spread of any\nepidemic-prone disease, often at tremendous cost to a nation\u0092s economy. In\nthe view of WHO, the surveillance system in China needs to be made more\nflexible and capable of a much more rapid and consistent response to any\nnew infectious disease threat.\n\nDuring the visit, Chinese officials expressed deep concern about the\ncountry\u0092s capacity to deal with the next influenza season against a\nbackground of possible SARS cases. The presence of influenza could greatly\ncomplicate the detection and accurate diagnosis of SARS cases, while also\nincreasing the caseload of suspect cases considerably.\n\nThe containment of SARS remains the overriding objective of WHO. If SARS is\nnot contained, the world will face a situation in which every case of\natypical pneumonia, and every hospital-based cluster of febrile patients\nwith respiratory systems will have the potential to rouse suspicions of\nSARS and spark widespread panic.\n\nIn an earlier report, a WHO assessment team reached the following\nconclusion: \u0093If SARS is not brought under control in China, there will be\nno chance of controlling the global threat of SARS. Achieving control of\nSARS is a major challenge especially in a country as large and diverse as\nChina. Effective disease control and reporting are the cornerstone of any\nstrategy to do this.\u0094\n\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[2]\nDate: 12 Jun 2003\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: CDC Taiwan [edited]\n<http://www.cdc.gov.tw/sarsen/>\n\nNo. new probable cases reported: 2\nCumulative no. cases: 688\n(cumulative no. cases in last update: 687)\nExplanation: 1 previously reported prob. case excluded by reporting MD.\n\nCumulative no.

It begs the\nquestion at what point in time following presumed/apparent interruption of\ntransmission in an area that had had local transmission (greater than or\nequal to 20 days, using the standard \"2 incubation periods\" for the\ndefinition) an area can presume that atypical pneumonias are most probably\nnot due to SARS and therefore SARS level infection control procedures can\nbe dropped. Not an easy question to answer given the observed recurrence\nof active transmission in Ontario. - Mod.MPP]\nSee Also\nSARS - worldwide (143): cases 20030611.1441\nSARS - worldwide (142): cases 20030610.1434\nSARS - worldwide (141): cases 20030609.1423\nSARS - worldwide (140): cases 20030608.1419\nSARS - worldwide (139): cases 20030607.1409\nSARS - worldwide (93): etiology 20030505.1122\nSARS - worldwide (87): case definition and diagnostics 20030502.1103\nSARS - worldwide (85): clinical aspects 20030501.1094\nSARS - worldwide (69): diagnostic testing 20030425.1015\nSARS - worldwide (58): diagnostic testing 20030419.0958\nSARS - worldwide (51): etiology 20030416.0925\nSARS - worldwide (42): WHO historical overview 20030411.0878\nSARS - worldwide (38): etiology 20030410.0869\nSARS - Worldwide (34): etiology 20030408.0857\nSARS - worldwide (13): etiology 20030327.0758\nSARS - worldwide (04): etiology 20030325.0737\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - worldwide (17) 20030322.0713\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - Worldwide: alert (03) 20030316.0660\nSevere Acute Respiratory Syndrome - Worldwide 20030315.0637\nAcute respiratory syndrome - Canada (Ontario) 20030314.0631\nAcute respiratory syndrome - East Asia 20030314.0630\nAcute respiratory syndrome - China (HK), VietNam (03) 20030313.0624\nUndiagnosed illness - Vietnam (Hanoi): RFI 20030311.0595\nPneumonia - China (Guangdong) (07) 20030221.0452\nPneumonia - China (Guangdong): RFI 20030210.0357\n.........................mpp/jw\n\n*##########################################################*\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.

Also in\nattendance were Dr Qi Ziaoqiu, Director-General of the Department of\nDisease Control in the Chinese Ministry of Health, and Dr Henk Bekedam, WHO\nRepresentative to China.\n\nThe briefing marked the first joint news conference between high-ranking\nChinese and WHO officials since the SARS outbreak began. The briefing\nfollowed a day of intensive meetings during which WHO officials reviewed\ndata and statistics from selected provinces, voiced their concerns, and\nreceived frank and detailed answers.\n\nDr Heymann praised the openness with which the WHO team was welcomed by the\nMinistry of Health, and described the measures now in place to control and\nprevent SARS as \u0093excellent\u0094. He cited the high level of commitment and\ndetermination at all levels of the health system as largely responsible for\nthe dramatic recent decline in the number of cases seen throughout mainland\nChina.\n\nOne purpose of the visit was to determine how China had succeeded in\nbringing down the number of cases so rapidly, and to encourage officials to\nshare their experiences with the rest of the world. Indications of the\neffectiveness of control measures, cited by Dr Heymann, include the very\nshort time now occurring between the onset of symptoms and the detection\nand isolation of cases, and the speed and efficiency of contact tracing.\nSuch measures are important as they limit the amount of time that an\ninfected person is capable of spreading the virus to others and thus bring\ncontrol efforts closer to the stage when the chain of person-to-person\ntransmission can be broken.\n\nOther effective measures include systems for both passive and active\nsurveillance, such as fever checks at train and bus stations and airports,\na nationwide mass media campaign to inform and educate the public, and a\nvery large number of fever clinics to assess those who suspect they may\nhave symptoms. \u0093We\u0092ve seen that there has been a massive effort to\nmobilize the population both in urban and rural areas across the country,\nencouraging people to monitor themselves for fever and to ensure that SARS\ncases are quickly identified, isolated and treated.\u0094\n\nSpecific concerns expressed by the WHO team include the lack of a\nsustainable surveillance system that can be relied on to detect the first\nhints of a resurgence of cases, some delays in meeting WHO requests for\nfurther information, and wide variations in application of the national\ncase definitions, which can lead to under-reporting of cases. Some problems\nrelated to prompt sharing and analysis of data are considered to arise from\ninstitutional and administrative problems, particularly concerning the\ninformation flow from provinces to the central level.\n\nAnother major concern is the large number of cases that have no known\nsource of exposure, thus making it extremely difficult to trace patterns of\ntransmission. In Beijing, the number of cases with no known contact with a\nSARS patient has recently increased from 50 percent to more than 70 percent.\n\nIn the interest of protecting against a further resurgence of cases, WHO\nofficials singled out strengthening of surveillance capacity as the top\npriority. Experience to date has shown that a single case, especially if\nhighly infectious, can rapidly ignite an explosive outbreak.\n\n\u0093With SARS seemingly on the decline for now, there is a great need to\nstrengthen the SARS control and surveillance system in China,\u0094 said Dr\nBekedam. \u0093The system now in place grew out of an emergency response and has\nto be strengthened for the long run.\u0094 He expressed doubt that the present\nsystem would be strong enough \u0093to hold back the tide\u0094 when confronted with\na resurgence of the disease.\n\nIn his assessment of the long-term SARS situation in China, Dr Heymann also\nstressed the need for systematic studies of the origins of SARS. \u0093We still\ndon\u0092t know exactly where SARS came from, or how it was transferred to the\nhuman population. We don\u0092t know if this disease is seasonal and will\ndecrease this year but come back next year.\u0094 Until proper research into\nthe origins of SARS has been conducted, it will be impossible to predict\nwhen the conditions that first allowed the virus to jump to humans from a\nsuspected animal reservoir might be repeated in the near or distant future.\n\nWHO initial assessments of the SARS situation in China, issued in late\nApril [2003] following a visit to Guangdong Province, expressed serious\nconcern over the lack of urgency in reporting cases of SARS in China, and\ncriticized the government for not immediately treating the outbreak as a\npublic health emergency requiring extraordinary measures for its\ncontrol. Dr Heymann and other members of the WHO team are now satisfied\nthat these measures are in place, at least for the immediate response to\nSARS. Recent visits to selected provinces, jointly conducted by the Chinese\nMinistry of Health and WHO, found a high level of public awareness of SARS,\nits symptoms and mode of transmission, and the need for twice-daily fever\nchecks.\n\nChina is regarded as the epicentre of the SARS outbreak. The country was\nhome to the first cases, detected in mid-November of last year [2002], and\npresently accounts for almost two thirds of all reported cases worldwide.\nThe WHO visit was arranged to secure reassurance that control measures in\nthis vast country are adequate to continue the downward trends in cases\nand, equally important, to ensure that a sustainable system is in place to\ndetect and contain a resurgence of cases. WHO is also anxious to ensure\nthat the considerable knowledge and experience acquired in managing the\nlargest SARS outbreak on record is shared for the benefit of all countries.\n\nThe SARS outbreak has revealed substantial weaknesses in the disease\nsurveillance system in China. When investment in health infrastructure is\nneglected, conditions are ripe for the unchecked spread of any\nepidemic-prone disease, often at tremendous cost to a nation\u0092s economy. In\nthe view of WHO, the surveillance system in China needs to be made more\nflexible and capable of a much more rapid and consistent response to any\nnew infectious disease threat.\n\nDuring the visit, Chinese officials expressed deep concern about the\ncountry\u0092s capacity to deal with the next influenza season against a\nbackground of possible SARS cases. The presence of influenza could greatly\ncomplicate the detection and accurate diagnosis of SARS cases, while also\nincreasing the caseload of suspect cases considerably.\n\nThe containment of SARS remains the overriding objective of WHO. If SARS is\nnot contained, the world will face a situation in which every case of\natypical pneumonia, and every hospital-based cluster of febrile patients\nwith respiratory systems will have the potential to rouse suspicions of\nSARS and spark widespread panic.\n\nIn an earlier report, a WHO assessment team reached the following\nconclusion: \u0093If SARS is not brought under control in China, there will be\nno chance of controlling the global threat of SARS. Achieving control of\nSARS is a major challenge especially in a country as large and diverse as\nChina. Effective disease control and reporting are the cornerstone of any\nstrategy to do this.\u0094\n\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[2]\nDate: 12 Jun 2003\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: CDC Taiwan [edited]\n<http://www.cdc.gov.tw/sarsen/>\n\nNo. new probable cases reported: 2\nCumulative no. cases: 688\n(cumulative no. cases in last update: 687)\nExplanation: 1 previously reported prob. case excluded by reporting MD.\n\nCumulative no.

To date, transmission has been limited to\nspecific transmission settings such as households, hospitals and specific\ncommunity settings.\n\nThe details of the cases to date are as follows:\n\nOntario is reporting 238 probable (60 active) and 133 suspect (4 active)\ncases.\nBritish Columbia is reporting 4 probable (0 active) and 46 suspect (0\nactive) cases.\nSaskatchewan is reporting 1 suspect (0 active) case.\nNew Brunswick is reporting 2 suspect cases (0 active).\nAlberta is reporting 6 suspect cases (0 active).\nPrince Edward Island is reporting 4 suspect cases (0 active).\nTotal no. of probables discharged or at home: 150\nTotal no. of suspects discharged or at home: 186\n\nThese numbers are accurate as of 1:00 PM EDST 12 Jun 2003.\n\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[As of 12 Jun 2003 there have been a cumulative total of 8445 probable\ncases with 790 deaths reported from 29 countries. In the past 24 hours\nthere have been 13 new probable cases reported of which 8 were reported\nfrom Canada, 2 each were reported from Taiwan and the Philippines (the\ncases in the Philippines occurred in Feb but were recently confirmed\nthrough laboratory testing conducted in the UK) and 1 was reported from\nChina. There were no new cases reported from Hong Kong.\n\nThe report on the ongoing outbreak of SARS in Toronto is a sobering\nreminder of the difficulties in detection of cases in the absence of an\nimmediately apparent epidemiologic link to other cases. It begs the\nquestion at what point in time following presumed/apparent interruption of\ntransmission in an area that had had local transmission (greater than or\nequal to 20 days, using the standard \"2 incubation periods\" for the\ndefinition) an area can presume that atypical pneumonias are most probably\nnot due to SARS and therefore SARS level infection control procedures can\nbe dropped. Not an easy question to answer given the observed recurrence\nof active transmission in Ontario. - Mod.MPP]\nSee Also\nSARS - worldwide (143): cases 20030611.1441\nSARS - worldwide (142): cases 20030610.1434\nSARS - worldwide (141): cases 20030609.1423\nSARS - worldwide (140): cases 20030608.1419\nSARS - worldwide (139): cases 20030607.1409\nSARS - worldwide (93): etiology 20030505.1122\nSARS - worldwide (87): case definition and diagnostics 20030502.1103\nSARS - worldwide (85): clinical aspects 20030501.1094\nSARS - worldwide (69): diagnostic testing 20030425.1015\nSARS - worldwide (58): diagnostic testing 20030419.0958\nSARS - worldwide (51): etiology 20030416.0925\nSARS - worldwide (42): WHO historical overview 20030411.0878\nSARS - worldwide (38): etiology 20030410.0869\nSARS - Worldwide (34): etiology 20030408.0857\nSARS - worldwide (13): etiology 20030327.0758\nSARS - worldwide (04): etiology 20030325.0737\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - worldwide (17) 20030322.0713\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - Worldwide: alert (03) 20030316.0660\nSevere Acute Respiratory Syndrome - Worldwide 20030315.0637\nAcute respiratory syndrome - Canada (Ontario) 20030314.0631\nAcute respiratory syndrome - East Asia 20030314.0630\nAcute respiratory syndrome - China (HK), VietNam (03) 20030313.0624\nUndiagnosed illness - Vietnam (Hanoi): RFI 20030311.0595\nPneumonia - China (Guangdong) (07) 20030221.0452\nPneumonia - China (Guangdong): RFI 20030210.0357\n.........................mpp/jw\n\n*##########################################################*\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.

Also in\nattendance were Dr Qi Ziaoqiu, Director-General of the Department of\nDisease Control in the Chinese Ministry of Health, and Dr Henk Bekedam, WHO\nRepresentative to China.\n\nThe briefing marked the first joint news conference between high-ranking\nChinese and WHO officials since the SARS outbreak began. The briefing\nfollowed a day of intensive meetings during which WHO officials reviewed\ndata and statistics from selected provinces, voiced their concerns, and\nreceived frank and detailed answers.\n\nDr Heymann praised the openness with which the WHO team was welcomed by the\nMinistry of Health, and described the measures now in place to control and\nprevent SARS as \u0093excellent\u0094. He cited the high level of commitment and\ndetermination at all levels of the health system as largely responsible for\nthe dramatic recent decline in the number of cases seen throughout mainland\nChina.\n\nOne purpose of the visit was to determine how China had succeeded in\nbringing down the number of cases so rapidly, and to encourage officials to\nshare their experiences with the rest of the world. Indications of the\neffectiveness of control measures, cited by Dr Heymann, include the very\nshort time now occurring between the onset of symptoms and the detection\nand isolation of cases, and the speed and efficiency of contact tracing.\nSuch measures are important as they limit the amount of time that an\ninfected person is capable of spreading the virus to others and thus bring\ncontrol efforts closer to the stage when the chain of person-to-person\ntransmission can be broken.\n\nOther effective measures include systems for both passive and active\nsurveillance, such as fever checks at train and bus stations and airports,\na nationwide mass media campaign to inform and educate the public, and a\nvery large number of fever clinics to assess those who suspect they may\nhave symptoms. \u0093We\u0092ve seen that there has been a massive effort to\nmobilize the population both in urban and rural areas across the country,\nencouraging people to monitor themselves for fever and to ensure that SARS\ncases are quickly identified, isolated and treated.\u0094\n\nSpecific concerns expressed by the WHO team include the lack of a\nsustainable surveillance system that can be relied on to detect the first\nhints of a resurgence of cases, some delays in meeting WHO requests for\nfurther information, and wide variations in application of the national\ncase definitions, which can lead to under-reporting of cases. Some problems\nrelated to prompt sharing and analysis of data are considered to arise from\ninstitutional and administrative problems, particularly concerning the\ninformation flow from provinces to the central level.\n\nAnother major concern is the large number of cases that have no known\nsource of exposure, thus making it extremely difficult to trace patterns of\ntransmission. In Beijing, the number of cases with no known contact with a\nSARS patient has recently increased from 50 percent to more than 70 percent.\n\nIn the interest of protecting against a further resurgence of cases, WHO\nofficials singled out strengthening of surveillance capacity as the top\npriority. Experience to date has shown that a single case, especially if\nhighly infectious, can rapidly ignite an explosive outbreak.\n\n\u0093With SARS seemingly on the decline for now, there is a great need to\nstrengthen the SARS control and surveillance system in China,\u0094 said Dr\nBekedam. \u0093The system now in place grew out of an emergency response and has\nto be strengthened for the long run.\u0094 He expressed doubt that the present\nsystem would be strong enough \u0093to hold back the tide\u0094 when confronted with\na resurgence of the disease.\n\nIn his assessment of the long-term SARS situation in China, Dr Heymann also\nstressed the need for systematic studies of the origins of SARS. \u0093We still\ndon\u0092t know exactly where SARS came from, or how it was transferred to the\nhuman population. We don\u0092t know if this disease is seasonal and will\ndecrease this year but come back next year.\u0094 Until proper research into\nthe origins of SARS has been conducted, it will be impossible to predict\nwhen the conditions that first allowed the virus to jump to humans from a\nsuspected animal reservoir might be repeated in the near or distant future.\n\nWHO initial assessments of the SARS situation in China, issued in late\nApril [2003] following a visit to Guangdong Province, expressed serious\nconcern over the lack of urgency in reporting cases of SARS in China, and\ncriticized the government for not immediately treating the outbreak as a\npublic health emergency requiring extraordinary measures for its\ncontrol. Dr Heymann and other members of the WHO team are now satisfied\nthat these measures are in place, at least for the immediate response to\nSARS. Recent visits to selected provinces, jointly conducted by the Chinese\nMinistry of Health and WHO, found a high level of public awareness of SARS,\nits symptoms and mode of transmission, and the need for twice-daily fever\nchecks.\n\nChina is regarded as the epicentre of the SARS outbreak. The country was\nhome to the first cases, detected in mid-November of last year [2002], and\npresently accounts for almost two thirds of all reported cases worldwide.\nThe WHO visit was arranged to secure reassurance that control measures in\nthis vast country are adequate to continue the downward trends in cases\nand, equally important, to ensure that a sustainable system is in place to\ndetect and contain a resurgence of cases. WHO is also anxious to ensure\nthat the considerable knowledge and experience acquired in managing the\nlargest SARS outbreak on record is shared for the benefit of all countries.\n\nThe SARS outbreak has revealed substantial weaknesses in the disease\nsurveillance system in China. When investment in health infrastructure is\nneglected, conditions are ripe for the unchecked spread of any\nepidemic-prone disease, often at tremendous cost to a nation\u0092s economy. In\nthe view of WHO, the surveillance system in China needs to be made more\nflexible and capable of a much more rapid and consistent response to any\nnew infectious disease threat.\n\nDuring the visit, Chinese officials expressed deep concern about the\ncountry\u0092s capacity to deal with the next influenza season against a\nbackground of possible SARS cases. The presence of influenza could greatly\ncomplicate the detection and accurate diagnosis of SARS cases, while also\nincreasing the caseload of suspect cases considerably.\n\nThe containment of SARS remains the overriding objective of WHO. If SARS is\nnot contained, the world will face a situation in which every case of\natypical pneumonia, and every hospital-based cluster of febrile patients\nwith respiratory systems will have the potential to rouse suspicions of\nSARS and spark widespread panic.\n\nIn an earlier report, a WHO assessment team reached the following\nconclusion: \u0093If SARS is not brought under control in China, there will be\nno chance of controlling the global threat of SARS. Achieving control of\nSARS is a major challenge especially in a country as large and diverse as\nChina. Effective disease control and reporting are the cornerstone of any\nstrategy to do this.\u0094\n\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[2]\nDate: 12 Jun 2003\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: CDC Taiwan [edited]\n<http://www.cdc.gov.tw/sarsen/>\n\nNo. new probable cases reported: 2\nCumulative no. cases: 688\n(cumulative no. cases in last update: 687)\nExplanation: 1 previously reported prob. case excluded by reporting MD.\n\nCumulative no.

There were no new cases reported from Hong Kong.\n\nThe report on the ongoing outbreak of SARS in Toronto is a sobering\nreminder of the difficulties in detection of cases in the absence of an\nimmediately apparent epidemiologic link to other cases. It begs the\nquestion at what point in time following presumed/apparent interruption of\ntransmission in an area that had had local transmission (greater than or\nequal to 20 days, using the standard \"2 incubation periods\" for the\ndefinition) an area can presume that atypical pneumonias are most probably\nnot due to SARS and therefore SARS level infection control procedures can\nbe dropped.

Also in\nattendance were Dr Qi Ziaoqiu, Director-General of the Department of\nDisease Control in the Chinese Ministry of Health, and Dr Henk Bekedam, WHO\nRepresentative to China.\n\nThe briefing marked the first joint news conference between high-ranking\nChinese and WHO officials since the SARS outbreak began. The briefing\nfollowed a day of intensive meetings during which WHO officials reviewed\ndata and statistics from selected provinces, voiced their concerns, and\nreceived frank and detailed answers.\n\nDr Heymann praised the openness with which the WHO team was welcomed by the\nMinistry of Health, and described the measures now in place to control and\nprevent SARS as \u0093excellent\u0094. He cited the high level of commitment and\ndetermination at all levels of the health system as largely responsible for\nthe dramatic recent decline in the number of cases seen throughout mainland\nChina.\n\nOne purpose of the visit was to determine how China had succeeded in\nbringing down the number of cases so rapidly, and to encourage officials to\nshare their experiences with the rest of the world. Indications of the\neffectiveness of control measures, cited by Dr Heymann, include the very\nshort time now occurring between the onset of symptoms and the detection\nand isolation of cases, and the speed and efficiency of contact tracing.\nSuch measures are important as they limit the amount of time that an\ninfected person is capable of spreading the virus to others and thus bring\ncontrol efforts closer to the stage when the chain of person-to-person\ntransmission can be broken.\n\nOther effective measures include systems for both passive and active\nsurveillance, such as fever checks at train and bus stations and airports,\na nationwide mass media campaign to inform and educate the public, and a\nvery large number of fever clinics to assess those who suspect they may\nhave symptoms. \u0093We\u0092ve seen that there has been a massive effort to\nmobilize the population both in urban and rural areas across the country,\nencouraging people to monitor themselves for fever and to ensure that SARS\ncases are quickly identified, isolated and treated.\u0094\n\nSpecific concerns expressed by the WHO team include the lack of a\nsustainable surveillance system that can be relied on to detect the first\nhints of a resurgence of cases, some delays in meeting WHO requests for\nfurther information, and wide variations in application of the national\ncase definitions, which can lead to under-reporting of cases. Some problems\nrelated to prompt sharing and analysis of data are considered to arise from\ninstitutional and administrative problems, particularly concerning the\ninformation flow from provinces to the central level.\n\nAnother major concern is the large number of cases that have no known\nsource of exposure, thus making it extremely difficult to trace patterns of\ntransmission. In Beijing, the number of cases with no known contact with a\nSARS patient has recently increased from 50 percent to more than 70 percent.\n\nIn the interest of protecting against a further resurgence of cases, WHO\nofficials singled out strengthening of surveillance capacity as the top\npriority. Experience to date has shown that a single case, especially if\nhighly infectious, can rapidly ignite an explosive outbreak.\n\n\u0093With SARS seemingly on the decline for now, there is a great need to\nstrengthen the SARS control and surveillance system in China,\u0094 said Dr\nBekedam. \u0093The system now in place grew out of an emergency response and has\nto be strengthened for the long run.\u0094 He expressed doubt that the present\nsystem would be strong enough \u0093to hold back the tide\u0094 when confronted with\na resurgence of the disease.\n\nIn his assessment of the long-term SARS situation in China, Dr Heymann also\nstressed the need for systematic studies of the origins of SARS. \u0093We still\ndon\u0092t know exactly where SARS came from, or how it was transferred to the\nhuman population. We don\u0092t know if this disease is seasonal and will\ndecrease this year but come back next year.\u0094 Until proper research into\nthe origins of SARS has been conducted, it will be impossible to predict\nwhen the conditions that first allowed the virus to jump to humans from a\nsuspected animal reservoir might be repeated in the near or distant future.\n\nWHO initial assessments of the SARS situation in China, issued in late\nApril [2003] following a visit to Guangdong Province, expressed serious\nconcern over the lack of urgency in reporting cases of SARS in China, and\ncriticized the government for not immediately treating the outbreak as a\npublic health emergency requiring extraordinary measures for its\ncontrol. Dr Heymann and other members of the WHO team are now satisfied\nthat these measures are in place, at least for the immediate response to\nSARS. Recent visits to selected provinces, jointly conducted by the Chinese\nMinistry of Health and WHO, found a high level of public awareness of SARS,\nits symptoms and mode of transmission, and the need for twice-daily fever\nchecks.\n\nChina is regarded as the epicentre of the SARS outbreak. The country was\nhome to the first cases, detected in mid-November of last year [2002], and\npresently accounts for almost two thirds of all reported cases worldwide.\nThe WHO visit was arranged to secure reassurance that control measures in\nthis vast country are adequate to continue the downward trends in cases\nand, equally important, to ensure that a sustainable system is in place to\ndetect and contain a resurgence of cases. WHO is also anxious to ensure\nthat the considerable knowledge and experience acquired in managing the\nlargest SARS outbreak on record is shared for the benefit of all countries.\n\nThe SARS outbreak has revealed substantial weaknesses in the disease\nsurveillance system in China. When investment in health infrastructure is\nneglected, conditions are ripe for the unchecked spread of any\nepidemic-prone disease, often at tremendous cost to a nation\u0092s economy. In\nthe view of WHO, the surveillance system in China needs to be made more\nflexible and capable of a much more rapid and consistent response to any\nnew infectious disease threat.\n\nDuring the visit, Chinese officials expressed deep concern about the\ncountry\u0092s capacity to deal with the next influenza season against a\nbackground of possible SARS cases. The presence of influenza could greatly\ncomplicate the detection and accurate diagnosis of SARS cases, while also\nincreasing the caseload of suspect cases considerably.\n\nThe containment of SARS remains the overriding objective of WHO. If SARS is\nnot contained, the world will face a situation in which every case of\natypical pneumonia, and every hospital-based cluster of febrile patients\nwith respiratory systems will have the potential to rouse suspicions of\nSARS and spark widespread panic.\n\nIn an earlier report, a WHO assessment team reached the following\nconclusion: \u0093If SARS is not brought under control in China, there will be\nno chance of controlling the global threat of SARS. Achieving control of\nSARS is a major challenge especially in a country as large and diverse as\nChina. Effective disease control and reporting are the cornerstone of any\nstrategy to do this.\u0094\n\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[2]\nDate: 12 Jun 2003\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: CDC Taiwan [edited]\n<http://www.cdc.gov.tw/sarsen/>\n\nNo. new probable cases reported: 2\nCumulative no. cases: 688\n(cumulative no. cases in last update: 687)\nExplanation: 1 previously reported prob. case excluded by reporting MD.\n\nCumulative no.

Also in\nattendance were Dr Qi Ziaoqiu, Director-General of the Department of\nDisease Control in the Chinese Ministry of Health, and Dr Henk Bekedam, WHO\nRepresentative to China.\n\nThe briefing marked the first joint news conference between high-ranking\nChinese and WHO officials since the SARS outbreak began. The briefing\nfollowed a day of intensive meetings during which WHO officials reviewed\ndata and statistics from selected provinces, voiced their concerns, and\nreceived frank and detailed answers.\n\nDr Heymann praised the openness with which the WHO team was welcomed by the\nMinistry of Health, and described the measures now in place to control and\nprevent SARS as \u0093excellent\u0094. He cited the high level of commitment and\ndetermination at all levels of the health system as largely responsible for\nthe dramatic recent decline in the number of cases seen throughout mainland\nChina.\n\nOne purpose of the visit was to determine how China had succeeded in\nbringing down the number of cases so rapidly, and to encourage officials to\nshare their experiences with the rest of the world. Indications of the\neffectiveness of control measures, cited by Dr Heymann, include the very\nshort time now occurring between the onset of symptoms and the detection\nand isolation of cases, and the speed and efficiency of contact tracing.\nSuch measures are important as they limit the amount of time that an\ninfected person is capable of spreading the virus to others and thus bring\ncontrol efforts closer to the stage when the chain of person-to-person\ntransmission can be broken.\n\nOther effective measures include systems for both passive and active\nsurveillance, such as fever checks at train and bus stations and airports,\na nationwide mass media campaign to inform and educate the public, and a\nvery large number of fever clinics to assess those who suspect they may\nhave symptoms. \u0093We\u0092ve seen that there has been a massive effort to\nmobilize the population both in urban and rural areas across the country,\nencouraging people to monitor themselves for fever and to ensure that SARS\ncases are quickly identified, isolated and treated.\u0094\n\nSpecific concerns expressed by the WHO team include the lack of a\nsustainable surveillance system that can be relied on to detect the first\nhints of a resurgence of cases, some delays in meeting WHO requests for\nfurther information, and wide variations in application of the national\ncase definitions, which can lead to under-reporting of cases. Some problems\nrelated to prompt sharing and analysis of data are considered to arise from\ninstitutional and administrative problems, particularly concerning the\ninformation flow from provinces to the central level.\n\nAnother major concern is the large number of cases that have no known\nsource of exposure, thus making it extremely difficult to trace patterns of\ntransmission. In Beijing, the number of cases with no known contact with a\nSARS patient has recently increased from 50 percent to more than 70 percent.\n\nIn the interest of protecting against a further resurgence of cases, WHO\nofficials singled out strengthening of surveillance capacity as the top\npriority. Experience to date has shown that a single case, especially if\nhighly infectious, can rapidly ignite an explosive outbreak.\n\n\u0093With SARS seemingly on the decline for now, there is a great need to\nstrengthen the SARS control and surveillance system in China,\u0094 said Dr\nBekedam. \u0093The system now in place grew out of an emergency response and has\nto be strengthened for the long run.\u0094 He expressed doubt that the present\nsystem would be strong enough \u0093to hold back the tide\u0094 when confronted with\na resurgence of the disease.\n\nIn his assessment of the long-term SARS situation in China, Dr Heymann also\nstressed the need for systematic studies of the origins of SARS. \u0093We still\ndon\u0092t know exactly where SARS came from, or how it was transferred to the\nhuman population. We don\u0092t know if this disease is seasonal and will\ndecrease this year but come back next year.\u0094 Until proper research into\nthe origins of SARS has been conducted, it will be impossible to predict\nwhen the conditions that first allowed the virus to jump to humans from a\nsuspected animal reservoir might be repeated in the near or distant future.\n\nWHO initial assessments of the SARS situation in China, issued in late\nApril [2003] following a visit to Guangdong Province, expressed serious\nconcern over the lack of urgency in reporting cases of SARS in China, and\ncriticized the government for not immediately treating the outbreak as a\npublic health emergency requiring extraordinary measures for its\ncontrol. Dr Heymann and other members of the WHO team are now satisfied\nthat these measures are in place, at least for the immediate response to\nSARS. Recent visits to selected provinces, jointly conducted by the Chinese\nMinistry of Health and WHO, found a high level of public awareness of SARS,\nits symptoms and mode of transmission, and the need for twice-daily fever\nchecks.\n\nChina is regarded as the epicentre of the SARS outbreak. The country was\nhome to the first cases, detected in mid-November of last year [2002], and\npresently accounts for almost two thirds of all reported cases worldwide.\nThe WHO visit was arranged to secure reassurance that control measures in\nthis vast country are adequate to continue the downward trends in cases\nand, equally important, to ensure that a sustainable system is in place to\ndetect and contain a resurgence of cases. WHO is also anxious to ensure\nthat the considerable knowledge and experience acquired in managing the\nlargest SARS outbreak on record is shared for the benefit of all countries.\n\nThe SARS outbreak has revealed substantial weaknesses in the disease\nsurveillance system in China. When investment in health infrastructure is\nneglected, conditions are ripe for the unchecked spread of any\nepidemic-prone disease, often at tremendous cost to a nation\u0092s economy. In\nthe view of WHO, the surveillance system in China needs to be made more\nflexible and capable of a much more rapid and consistent response to any\nnew infectious disease threat.\n\nDuring the visit, Chinese officials expressed deep concern about the\ncountry\u0092s capacity to deal with the next influenza season against a\nbackground of possible SARS cases. The presence of influenza could greatly\ncomplicate the detection and accurate diagnosis of SARS cases, while also\nincreasing the caseload of suspect cases considerably.\n\nThe containment of SARS remains the overriding objective of WHO. If SARS is\nnot contained, the world will face a situation in which every case of\natypical pneumonia, and every hospital-based cluster of febrile patients\nwith respiratory systems will have the potential to rouse suspicions of\nSARS and spark widespread panic.\n\nIn an earlier report, a WHO assessment team reached the following\nconclusion: \u0093If SARS is not brought under control in China, there will be\nno chance of controlling the global threat of SARS. Achieving control of\nSARS is a major challenge especially in a country as large and diverse as\nChina. Effective disease control and reporting are the cornerstone of any\nstrategy to do this.\u0094\n\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[2]\nDate: 12 Jun 2003\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: CDC Taiwan [edited]\n<http://www.cdc.gov.tw/sarsen/>\n\nNo. new probable cases reported: 2\nCumulative no. cases: 688\n(cumulative no. cases in last update: 687)\nExplanation: 1 previously reported prob. case excluded by reporting MD.\n\nCumulative no.

There were no new cases reported from Hong Kong.\n\nThe report on the ongoing outbreak of SARS in Toronto is a sobering\nreminder of the difficulties in detection of cases in the absence of an\nimmediately apparent epidemiologic link to other cases. It begs the\nquestion at what point in time following presumed/apparent interruption of\ntransmission in an area that had had local transmission (greater than or\nequal to 20 days, using the standard \"2 incubation periods\" for the\ndefinition) an area can presume that atypical pneumonias are most probably\nnot due to SARS and therefore SARS level infection control procedures can\nbe dropped. Not an easy question to answer given the observed recurrence\nof active transmission in Ontario. - Mod.MPP]\nSee Also\nSARS - worldwide (143): cases 20030611.1441\nSARS - worldwide (142): cases 20030610.1434\nSARS - worldwide (141): cases 20030609.1423\nSARS - worldwide (140): cases 20030608.1419\nSARS - worldwide (139): cases 20030607.1409\nSARS - worldwide (93): etiology 20030505.1122\nSARS - worldwide (87): case definition and diagnostics 20030502.1103\nSARS - worldwide (85): clinical aspects 20030501.1094\nSARS - worldwide (69): diagnostic testing 20030425.1015\nSARS - worldwide (58): diagnostic testing 20030419.0958\nSARS - worldwide (51): etiology 20030416.0925\nSARS - worldwide (42): WHO historical overview 20030411.0878\nSARS - worldwide (38): etiology 20030410.0869\nSARS - Worldwide (34): etiology 20030408.0857\nSARS - worldwide (13): etiology 20030327.0758\nSARS - worldwide (04): etiology 20030325.0737\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - worldwide (17) 20030322.0713\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - Worldwide: alert (03) 20030316.0660\nSevere Acute Respiratory Syndrome - Worldwide 20030315.0637\nAcute respiratory syndrome - Canada (Ontario) 20030314.0631\nAcute respiratory syndrome - East Asia 20030314.0630\nAcute respiratory syndrome - China (HK), VietNam (03) 20030313.0624\nUndiagnosed illness - Vietnam (Hanoi): RFI 20030311.0595\nPneumonia - China (Guangdong) (07) 20030221.0452\nPneumonia - China (Guangdong): RFI 20030210.0357\n.........................mpp/jw\n\n*##########################################################*\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.

Mod.MPP]\n\nAs of today, a cumulative total of 8403 probable cases with 775\ndeaths has been reported from 29 countries. This represents an\nincrease of 6 new cases and 3 deaths compared with yesterday.\n\nThe new cases occurred in Canada (5) and Taiwan (1). New deaths were\nreported in China (2) and Hong Kong (1).\n\nHealth authorities in some of the earliest areas to experience severe\noutbreaks are maintaining measures to protect against a resurgence of\ncases. Hong Kong authorities have announced their intention to\nmaintain current screening procedures at all border points for at\nleast one year.\n\nThe measures, which began at the end of March [2003], include use of\ninfrared temperature scanners at border points, and obligatory health\ndeclarations from all travellers. No new imported cases have occurred\nsince these measures were introduced.\n\nHong Kong is also setting up a master list of imported cases.\nApproximately 6 percent of all SARS cases in Hong Kong are now\nthought to have been imported. To date, Hong Kong has experienced\n1748 cases and 284 deaths, making it the second most severely hit\narea, with mainland China at the top.\n\nHong Kong shares a border with Guangdong Province, China. The disease\nwas first brought to Hong Kong in late February [2003], when an\ninfected medical doctor from the province spread the virus to at\nleast 13 guests and visitors, all on the same floor of the hotel\nwhere he stayed. They carried the disease with them when they\nreturned home, seeding the earliest outbreaks in Viet Nam, Singapore,\nand Toronto as well as Hong Kong.\n\nIn these initial outbreaks, SARS first took root in hospital\nsettings, where staff, unaware that a new disease had surfaced and\nfighting to save the lives of patients, exposed themselves to the\ninfectious agent without barrier protection. All of these initial\noutbreaks were subsequently characterized by chains of secondary\ntransmission outside the health care setting.\n\nAt present, local chains of transmission are occurring only in\nToronto and several parts of China. All other countries with imported\ncases have managed either to prevent transmission entirely or limit\nadditional cases to very small numbers.\n\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[2]\nDate: 5 Jun 2003\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: CDC Taiwan [edited]\n<http://www.cdc.gov.tw/sarsen/>\n\nDate: 4 Jun 2003\nNo. new probable cases reported: 0\nCumulative no. cases: 677\n(cumulative no. cases in last update: 678)\nExplanation: 2 probable cases have been cancelled by reporting\nphysician; 1 previously reported [suspected] case has been\nreclassified as probable cases by reporting physician\n\nCumulative no.

Mod.MPP]\n\nAs of today, a cumulative total of 8403 probable cases with 775\ndeaths has been reported from 29 countries. This represents an\nincrease of 6 new cases and 3 deaths compared with yesterday.\n\nThe new cases occurred in Canada (5) and Taiwan (1). New deaths were\nreported in China (2) and Hong Kong (1).\n\nHealth authorities in some of the earliest areas to experience severe\noutbreaks are maintaining measures to protect against a resurgence of\ncases. Hong Kong authorities have announced their intention to\nmaintain current screening procedures at all border points for at\nleast one year.\n\nThe measures, which began at the end of March [2003], include use of\ninfrared temperature scanners at border points, and obligatory health\ndeclarations from all travellers. No new imported cases have occurred\nsince these measures were introduced.\n\nHong Kong is also setting up a master list of imported cases.\nApproximately 6 percent of all SARS cases in Hong Kong are now\nthought to have been imported. To date, Hong Kong has experienced\n1748 cases and 284 deaths, making it the second most severely hit\narea, with mainland China at the top.\n\nHong Kong shares a border with Guangdong Province, China. The disease\nwas first brought to Hong Kong in late February [2003], when an\ninfected medical doctor from the province spread the virus to at\nleast 13 guests and visitors, all on the same floor of the hotel\nwhere he stayed. They carried the disease with them when they\nreturned home, seeding the earliest outbreaks in Viet Nam, Singapore,\nand Toronto as well as Hong Kong.\n\nIn these initial outbreaks, SARS first took root in hospital\nsettings, where staff, unaware that a new disease had surfaced and\nfighting to save the lives of patients, exposed themselves to the\ninfectious agent without barrier protection. All of these initial\noutbreaks were subsequently characterized by chains of secondary\ntransmission outside the health care setting.\n\nAt present, local chains of transmission are occurring only in\nToronto and several parts of China. All other countries with imported\ncases have managed either to prevent transmission entirely or limit\nadditional cases to very small numbers.\n\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[2]\nDate: 5 Jun 2003\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: CDC Taiwan [edited]\n<http://www.cdc.gov.tw/sarsen/>\n\nDate: 4 Jun 2003\nNo. new probable cases reported: 0\nCumulative no. cases: 677\n(cumulative no. cases in last update: 678)\nExplanation: 2 probable cases have been cancelled by reporting\nphysician; 1 previously reported [suspected] case has been\nreclassified as probable cases by reporting physician\n\nCumulative no.

Global decline in cases and deaths continues 5 Jun 2003\n<http://www.who.int/csr/don/2003_06_05/en/>\n\n[ProMED-mail would like to thank Marianne Hopp <mjhopp12@yahoo.com>\nfor continued monitoring of WHO reports. - Mod.MPP]\n\nAs of today, a cumulative total of 8403 probable cases with 775\ndeaths has been reported from 29 countries. This represents an\nincrease of 6 new cases and 3 deaths compared with yesterday.\n\nThe new cases occurred in Canada (5) and Taiwan (1). New deaths were\nreported in China (2) and Hong Kong (1).\n\nHealth authorities in some of the earliest areas to experience severe\noutbreaks are maintaining measures to protect against a resurgence of\ncases. Hong Kong authorities have announced their intention to\nmaintain current screening procedures at all border points for at\nleast one year.\n\nThe measures, which began at the end of March [2003], include use of\ninfrared temperature scanners at border points, and obligatory health\ndeclarations from all travellers. No new imported cases have occurred\nsince these measures were introduced.\n\nHong Kong is also setting up a master list of imported cases.\nApproximately 6 percent of all SARS cases in Hong Kong are now\nthought to have been imported. To date, Hong Kong has experienced\n1748 cases and 284 deaths, making it the second most severely hit\narea, with mainland China at the top.\n\nHong Kong shares a border with Guangdong Province, China. The disease\nwas first brought to Hong Kong in late February [2003], when an\ninfected medical doctor from the province spread the virus to at\nleast 13 guests and visitors, all on the same floor of the hotel\nwhere he stayed. They carried the disease with them when they\nreturned home, seeding the earliest outbreaks in Viet Nam, Singapore,\nand Toronto as well as Hong Kong.\n\nIn these initial outbreaks, SARS first took root in hospital\nsettings, where staff, unaware that a new disease had surfaced and\nfighting to save the lives of patients, exposed themselves to the\ninfectious agent without barrier protection. All of these initial\noutbreaks were subsequently characterized by chains of secondary\ntransmission outside the health care setting.\n\nAt present, local chains of transmission are occurring only in\nToronto and several parts of China.

Mod.MPP]\n\nAs of today, a cumulative total of 8403 probable cases with 775\ndeaths has been reported from 29 countries. This represents an\nincrease of 6 new cases and 3 deaths compared with yesterday.\n\nThe new cases occurred in Canada (5) and Taiwan (1). New deaths were\nreported in China (2) and Hong Kong (1).\n\nHealth authorities in some of the earliest areas to experience severe\noutbreaks are maintaining measures to protect against a resurgence of\ncases. Hong Kong authorities have announced their intention to\nmaintain current screening procedures at all border points for at\nleast one year.\n\nThe measures, which began at the end of March [2003], include use of\ninfrared temperature scanners at border points, and obligatory health\ndeclarations from all travellers. No new imported cases have occurred\nsince these measures were introduced.\n\nHong Kong is also setting up a master list of imported cases.\nApproximately 6 percent of all SARS cases in Hong Kong are now\nthought to have been imported. To date, Hong Kong has experienced\n1748 cases and 284 deaths, making it the second most severely hit\narea, with mainland China at the top.\n\nHong Kong shares a border with Guangdong Province, China. The disease\nwas first brought to Hong Kong in late February [2003], when an\ninfected medical doctor from the province spread the virus to at\nleast 13 guests and visitors, all on the same floor of the hotel\nwhere he stayed. They carried the disease with them when they\nreturned home, seeding the earliest outbreaks in Viet Nam, Singapore,\nand Toronto as well as Hong Kong.\n\nIn these initial outbreaks, SARS first took root in hospital\nsettings, where staff, unaware that a new disease had surfaced and\nfighting to save the lives of patients, exposed themselves to the\ninfectious agent without barrier protection. All of these initial\noutbreaks were subsequently characterized by chains of secondary\ntransmission outside the health care setting.\n\nAt present, local chains of transmission are occurring only in\nToronto and several parts of China. All other countries with imported\ncases have managed either to prevent transmission entirely or limit\nadditional cases to very small numbers.\n\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[2]\nDate: 5 Jun 2003\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: CDC Taiwan [edited]\n<http://www.cdc.gov.tw/sarsen/>\n\nDate: 4 Jun 2003\nNo. new probable cases reported: 0\nCumulative no. cases: 677\n(cumulative no. cases in last update: 678)\nExplanation: 2 probable cases have been cancelled by reporting\nphysician; 1 previously reported [suspected] case has been\nreclassified as probable cases by reporting physician\n\nCumulative no.

Mod.MPP]\n\nAs of today, a cumulative total of 8403 probable cases with 775\ndeaths has been reported from 29 countries. This represents an\nincrease of 6 new cases and 3 deaths compared with yesterday.\n\nThe new cases occurred in Canada (5) and Taiwan (1). New deaths were\nreported in China (2) and Hong Kong (1).\n\nHealth authorities in some of the earliest areas to experience severe\noutbreaks are maintaining measures to protect against a resurgence of\ncases. Hong Kong authorities have announced their intention to\nmaintain current screening procedures at all border points for at\nleast one year.\n\nThe measures, which began at the end of March [2003], include use of\ninfrared temperature scanners at border points, and obligatory health\ndeclarations from all travellers. No new imported cases have occurred\nsince these measures were introduced.\n\nHong Kong is also setting up a master list of imported cases.\nApproximately 6 percent of all SARS cases in Hong Kong are now\nthought to have been imported. To date, Hong Kong has experienced\n1748 cases and 284 deaths, making it the second most severely hit\narea, with mainland China at the top.\n\nHong Kong shares a border with Guangdong Province, China. The disease\nwas first brought to Hong Kong in late February [2003], when an\ninfected medical doctor from the province spread the virus to at\nleast 13 guests and visitors, all on the same floor of the hotel\nwhere he stayed. They carried the disease with them when they\nreturned home, seeding the earliest outbreaks in Viet Nam, Singapore,\nand Toronto as well as Hong Kong.\n\nIn these initial outbreaks, SARS first took root in hospital\nsettings, where staff, unaware that a new disease had surfaced and\nfighting to save the lives of patients, exposed themselves to the\ninfectious agent without barrier protection. All of these initial\noutbreaks were subsequently characterized by chains of secondary\ntransmission outside the health care setting.\n\nAt present, local chains of transmission are occurring only in\nToronto and several parts of China. All other countries with imported\ncases have managed either to prevent transmission entirely or limit\nadditional cases to very small numbers.\n\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[2]\nDate: 5 Jun 2003\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: CDC Taiwan [edited]\n<http://www.cdc.gov.tw/sarsen/>\n\nDate: 4 Jun 2003\nNo. new probable cases reported: 0\nCumulative no. cases: 677\n(cumulative no. cases in last update: 678)\nExplanation: 2 probable cases have been cancelled by reporting\nphysician; 1 previously reported [suspected] case has been\nreclassified as probable cases by reporting physician\n\nCumulative no.

Global decline in cases and deaths continues 5 Jun 2003\n<http://www.who.int/csr/don/2003_06_05/en/>\n\n[ProMED-mail would like to thank Marianne Hopp <mjhopp12@yahoo.com>\nfor continued monitoring of WHO reports. - Mod.MPP]\n\nAs of today, a cumulative total of 8403 probable cases with 775\ndeaths has been reported from 29 countries. This represents an\nincrease of 6 new cases and 3 deaths compared with yesterday.\n\nThe new cases occurred in Canada (5) and Taiwan (1). New deaths were\nreported in China (2) and Hong Kong (1).\n\nHealth authorities in some of the earliest areas to experience severe\noutbreaks are maintaining measures to protect against a resurgence of\ncases. Hong Kong authorities have announced their intention to\nmaintain current screening procedures at all border points for at\nleast one year.\n\nThe measures, which began at the end of March [2003], include use of\ninfrared temperature scanners at border points, and obligatory health\ndeclarations from all travellers. No new imported cases have occurred\nsince these measures were introduced.\n\nHong Kong is also setting up a master list of imported cases.\nApproximately 6 percent of all SARS cases in Hong Kong are now\nthought to have been imported. To date, Hong Kong has experienced\n1748 cases and 284 deaths, making it the second most severely hit\narea, with mainland China at the top.\n\nHong Kong shares a border with Guangdong Province, China. The disease\nwas first brought to Hong Kong in late February [2003], when an\ninfected medical doctor from the province spread the virus to at\nleast 13 guests and visitors, all on the same floor of the hotel\nwhere he stayed. They carried the disease with them when they\nreturned home, seeding the earliest outbreaks in Viet Nam, Singapore,\nand Toronto as well as Hong Kong.\n\nIn these initial outbreaks, SARS first took root in hospital\nsettings, where staff, unaware that a new disease had surfaced and\nfighting to save the lives of patients, exposed themselves to the\ninfectious agent without barrier protection. All of these initial\noutbreaks were subsequently characterized by chains of secondary\ntransmission outside the health care setting.\n\nAt present, local chains of transmission are occurring only in\nToronto and several parts of China. All other countries with imported\ncases have managed either to prevent transmission entirely or limit\nadditional cases to very small numbers.\n\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[2]\nDate: 5 Jun 2003\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: CDC Taiwan [edited]\n<http://www.cdc.gov.tw/sarsen/>\n\nDate: 4 Jun 2003\nNo. new probable cases reported: 0\nCumulative no. cases: 677\n(cumulative no. cases in last update: 678)\nExplanation: 2 probable cases have been cancelled by reporting\nphysician; 1 previously reported [suspected] case has been\nreclassified as probable cases by reporting physician\n\nCumulative no.

Mod.MPP]\n\nAs of today, a cumulative total of 8403 probable cases with 775\ndeaths has been reported from 29 countries. This represents an\nincrease of 6 new cases and 3 deaths compared with yesterday.\n\nThe new cases occurred in Canada (5) and Taiwan (1). New deaths were\nreported in China (2) and Hong Kong (1).\n\nHealth authorities in some of the earliest areas to experience severe\noutbreaks are maintaining measures to protect against a resurgence of\ncases. Hong Kong authorities have announced their intention to\nmaintain current screening procedures at all border points for at\nleast one year.\n\nThe measures, which began at the end of March [2003], include use of\ninfrared temperature scanners at border points, and obligatory health\ndeclarations from all travellers. No new imported cases have occurred\nsince these measures were introduced.\n\nHong Kong is also setting up a master list of imported cases.\nApproximately 6 percent of all SARS cases in Hong Kong are now\nthought to have been imported. To date, Hong Kong has experienced\n1748 cases and 284 deaths, making it the second most severely hit\narea, with mainland China at the top.\n\nHong Kong shares a border with Guangdong Province, China. The disease\nwas first brought to Hong Kong in late February [2003], when an\ninfected medical doctor from the province spread the virus to at\nleast 13 guests and visitors, all on the same floor of the hotel\nwhere he stayed. They carried the disease with them when they\nreturned home, seeding the earliest outbreaks in Viet Nam, Singapore,\nand Toronto as well as Hong Kong.\n\nIn these initial outbreaks, SARS first took root in hospital\nsettings, where staff, unaware that a new disease had surfaced and\nfighting to save the lives of patients, exposed themselves to the\ninfectious agent without barrier protection. All of these initial\noutbreaks were subsequently characterized by chains of secondary\ntransmission outside the health care setting.\n\nAt present, local chains of transmission are occurring only in\nToronto and several parts of China. All other countries with imported\ncases have managed either to prevent transmission entirely or limit\nadditional cases to very small numbers.\n\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[2]\nDate: 5 Jun 2003\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: CDC Taiwan [edited]\n<http://www.cdc.gov.tw/sarsen/>\n\nDate: 4 Jun 2003\nNo. new probable cases reported: 0\nCumulative no. cases: 677\n(cumulative no. cases in last update: 678)\nExplanation: 2 probable cases have been cancelled by reporting\nphysician; 1 previously reported [suspected] case has been\nreclassified as probable cases by reporting physician\n\nCumulative no.

No new cases were\nreported from China or Hong Kong today.\n\nIn the news brief section there is mention of a possible case in\nQuebec (Montreal) Canada with history of health care environment\nexposure in Ontario (Toronto). In addition, there is mention of a\npossible case in the Far East of Russia with possible exposure in the\nPrimorsky Region a border region with China and not far from\nBlagoveshchensk where the first (and only) probable case of SARS has\nbeen reported.

Mod.MPP]\n\nAs of today, a cumulative total of 8403 probable cases with 775\ndeaths has been reported from 29 countries. This represents an\nincrease of 6 new cases and 3 deaths compared with yesterday.\n\nThe new cases occurred in Canada (5) and Taiwan (1). New deaths were\nreported in China (2) and Hong Kong (1).\n\nHealth authorities in some of the earliest areas to experience severe\noutbreaks are maintaining measures to protect against a resurgence of\ncases. Hong Kong authorities have announced their intention to\nmaintain current screening procedures at all border points for at\nleast one year.\n\nThe measures, which began at the end of March [2003], include use of\ninfrared temperature scanners at border points, and obligatory health\ndeclarations from all travellers. No new imported cases have occurred\nsince these measures were introduced.\n\nHong Kong is also setting up a master list of imported cases.\nApproximately 6 percent of all SARS cases in Hong Kong are now\nthought to have been imported. To date, Hong Kong has experienced\n1748 cases and 284 deaths, making it the second most severely hit\narea, with mainland China at the top.\n\nHong Kong shares a border with Guangdong Province, China. The disease\nwas first brought to Hong Kong in late February [2003], when an\ninfected medical doctor from the province spread the virus to at\nleast 13 guests and visitors, all on the same floor of the hotel\nwhere he stayed. They carried the disease with them when they\nreturned home, seeding the earliest outbreaks in Viet Nam, Singapore,\nand Toronto as well as Hong Kong.\n\nIn these initial outbreaks, SARS first took root in hospital\nsettings, where staff, unaware that a new disease had surfaced and\nfighting to save the lives of patients, exposed themselves to the\ninfectious agent without barrier protection. All of these initial\noutbreaks were subsequently characterized by chains of secondary\ntransmission outside the health care setting.\n\nAt present, local chains of transmission are occurring only in\nToronto and several parts of China. All other countries with imported\ncases have managed either to prevent transmission entirely or limit\nadditional cases to very small numbers.\n\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[2]\nDate: 5 Jun 2003\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: CDC Taiwan [edited]\n<http://www.cdc.gov.tw/sarsen/>\n\nDate: 4 Jun 2003\nNo. new probable cases reported: 0\nCumulative no. cases: 677\n(cumulative no. cases in last update: 678)\nExplanation: 2 probable cases have been cancelled by reporting\nphysician; 1 previously reported [suspected] case has been\nreclassified as probable cases by reporting physician\n\nCumulative no.

Since the last summary on 2 Jun\n2003, the number of probable cases have increased by 5: 7 are newly\nidentified probable cases, 3 suspect cases have been upgraded to\nprobable, 3 probable cases have been reclassified as suspect, and 2\nprobable cases have been delisted.\n\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[5]\nDate: 5 Jun 2003\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: News briefs [edited]\n\n[A] Canada from Canada.com\n<http://canada.com/national/story.asp?id=211F2CED-04CC-46E8-B90D-906D6F69D3B7>\n\nDoctors at Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital are examining a patient who\nmay be Montreal's first case of SARS. A female patient who had been\ntreated at a Toronto hospital where SARS had been identified was\nbrought by ambulance to hospital Thu [5 Jun 2003] morning with some\nSARS symptoms. \"That person is now isolated in our emergency ward in\na negative pressure room,\" said hospital spokesman Alain Charbonneau.\n\n[B] Russia - Far East from Interfax 5 Jun 2003\n<http://www.interfax.ru/one_news_en.html?lang=EN&tz=0&tz_format=MSK&id_news=5641739>\n\nA young man was hospitalized with SARS-like symptoms on Sakhalin on\nThursday, a local health authority told Interfax. The man, aged 21,\nhad recently come to Sakhalin from a military unit in Ussuriisk in\nPrimorye Territory. The man went to a polyclinic and said he had\nbeen feeling bad since 17 May 2003. The doctors who examined him\nfound several symptoms that are consistent with SARS. The man was\nimmediately admitted to a hospital for infectious diseases. 19 people\nwho had contact with him have been quarantined.\n\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[As of 5 Jun 2003 there have been a cumulative total of 8403 probable\ncases of SARS with 775 deaths reported from 29 countries. In the\npast 24 hours there have been 6 new probable cases reported; 5 from\nCanada and 1 from Taiwan. According to the Health Canada website,\nthe most recent date of onset of probable cases identified is 31 May\n2003 (or 1 Jun 2003 -- the 4 Jun 2003 epidemiologic discussion\nmentioned a 1 Jun 2003, but the 5 Jun 2003 update mentions 31 May\n2003).\n\nNoteworthy is the marked decrease in numbers of cases reported with a\ntotal of 6 new cases reported worldwide today. No new cases were\nreported from China or Hong Kong today.\n\nIn the news brief section there is mention of a possible case in\nQuebec (Montreal) Canada with history of health care environment\nexposure in Ontario (Toronto). In addition, there is mention of a\npossible case in the Far East of Russia with possible exposure in the\nPrimorsky Region a border region with China and not far from\nBlagoveshchensk where the first (and only) probable case of SARS has\nbeen reported.

The China\nNews Service (CNS) reports that scientists have concluded that SARS can be\nasymptomatic, after studying people who had come in contact with Heyuan's\nfirst SARS case. Heyuan SARS experts checked [the case's] family members,\nhealth workers who treated him, the doctor in his village, and conducted\nblood tests on 5 of these people. CNS reports they found some of the 5\npeople have the SARS virus in their blood, but have not fallen ill and have\ndeveloped antibodies to fight the virus. The scientists believe people who\nhave developed antibodies for the SARS virus are not infectious. The\nreport could not immediately be confirmed.\n[B] Democratic Republic of the Congo from All Africa 30 May 2003\n<http://allafrica.com/stories/200305300538.html>\nSeveral persons suspected of being carriers of the SARS virus were put in\nquarantine last Sunday, 25 May 2003 at Kinshasa airport. The DR Congo's\nminister of health, L\u00e9onard Mashako Mamba, announced on Monday that all had\ncome from Hong Kong via South Africa. 2 Gambian citizens, a Congolese\nnational and a unspecified number of Hong Kong Chinese traveled in the same\nflight from the Far East to Johannesburg with passengers who showed the\nsymptoms of the disease, said Congolese health officials. The Congolese\nministry of health says the passengers were allowed to board the flight to\nKinshasa despite their request to the South African authorities, before the\nplane's departure, not to allow them to do so. The 2 Gambians and the\nCongolese were quarantined at Kinkole, to the east of Kinshasa, in a\nspecial clinic designed to host suspect SARS cases. But the Chinese\ncitizens could be expelled to South Africa, writes the independent APA news\nagency.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[In the past 24 hours there have been reports of 8 new probable cases in\nOntario, Canada, 5 new probable cases in Taiwan, 3 new probable cases in\nHong Kong, and 2 new probable cases in China (1 each from Beijing and Hebei).\nThe newswire report about asymptomatic infections in China (see [5][A]),\nwhile not substantiated through an official report, are not surprising. It\nis not unusual to have asymptomatic infections. Some of the questions that\narise are what proportion of those infected have an asymptomatic infection\n(or in reverse, what proportion of those infected have a clinical illness);\nand of significant import, do those individuals who have asymptomatic\ninfections transmit the SARS-associated coronavirus to others?

The China\nNews Service (CNS) reports that scientists have concluded that SARS can be\nasymptomatic, after studying people who had come in contact with Heyuan's\nfirst SARS case. Heyuan SARS experts checked [the case's] family members,\nhealth workers who treated him, the doctor in his village, and conducted\nblood tests on 5 of these people. CNS reports they found some of the 5\npeople have the SARS virus in their blood, but have not fallen ill and have\ndeveloped antibodies to fight the virus. The scientists believe people who\nhave developed antibodies for the SARS virus are not infectious. The\nreport could not immediately be confirmed.\n[B] Democratic Republic of the Congo from All Africa 30 May 2003\n<http://allafrica.com/stories/200305300538.html>\nSeveral persons suspected of being carriers of the SARS virus were put in\nquarantine last Sunday, 25 May 2003 at Kinshasa airport. The DR Congo's\nminister of health, L\u00e9onard Mashako Mamba, announced on Monday that all had\ncome from Hong Kong via South Africa. 2 Gambian citizens, a Congolese\nnational and a unspecified number of Hong Kong Chinese traveled in the same\nflight from the Far East to Johannesburg with passengers who showed the\nsymptoms of the disease, said Congolese health officials. The Congolese\nministry of health says the passengers were allowed to board the flight to\nKinshasa despite their request to the South African authorities, before the\nplane's departure, not to allow them to do so. The 2 Gambians and the\nCongolese were quarantined at Kinkole, to the east of Kinshasa, in a\nspecial clinic designed to host suspect SARS cases. But the Chinese\ncitizens could be expelled to South Africa, writes the independent APA news\nagency.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[In the past 24 hours there have been reports of 8 new probable cases in\nOntario, Canada, 5 new probable cases in Taiwan, 3 new probable cases in\nHong Kong, and 2 new probable cases in China (1 each from Beijing and Hebei).\nThe newswire report about asymptomatic infections in China (see [5][A]),\nwhile not substantiated through an official report, are not surprising. It\nis not unusual to have asymptomatic infections. Some of the questions that\narise are what proportion of those infected have an asymptomatic infection\n(or in reverse, what proportion of those infected have a clinical illness);\nand of significant import, do those individuals who have asymptomatic\ninfections transmit the SARS-associated coronavirus to others? More\ndetails on the study mentioned in the newswire would be appreciated, as\nwould information from other areas that may have addressed similar questions.\nThe newswire report from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) [5][B]\nis a bit confusing as it is unclear if the individuals mentioned were\nisolated because of contact with individual(s) with symptoms compatable\nwith SARS, or if they themselves had symptoms compatable with SARS.

The China\nNews Service (CNS) reports that scientists have concluded that SARS can be\nasymptomatic, after studying people who had come in contact with Heyuan's\nfirst SARS case. Heyuan SARS experts checked [the case's] family members,\nhealth workers who treated him, the doctor in his village, and conducted\nblood tests on 5 of these people. CNS reports they found some of the 5\npeople have the SARS virus in their blood, but have not fallen ill and have\ndeveloped antibodies to fight the virus. The scientists believe people who\nhave developed antibodies for the SARS virus are not infectious. The\nreport could not immediately be confirmed.\n[B] Democratic Republic of the Congo from All Africa 30 May 2003\n<http://allafrica.com/stories/200305300538.html>\nSeveral persons suspected of being carriers of the SARS virus were put in\nquarantine last Sunday, 25 May 2003 at Kinshasa airport. The DR Congo's\nminister of health, L\u00e9onard Mashako Mamba, announced on Monday that all had\ncome from Hong Kong via South Africa. 2 Gambian citizens, a Congolese\nnational and a unspecified number of Hong Kong Chinese traveled in the same\nflight from the Far East to Johannesburg with passengers who showed the\nsymptoms of the disease, said Congolese health officials. The Congolese\nministry of health says the passengers were allowed to board the flight to\nKinshasa despite their request to the South African authorities, before the\nplane's departure, not to allow them to do so. The 2 Gambians and the\nCongolese were quarantined at Kinkole, to the east of Kinshasa, in a\nspecial clinic designed to host suspect SARS cases. But the Chinese\ncitizens could be expelled to South Africa, writes the independent APA news\nagency.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[In the past 24 hours there have been reports of 8 new probable cases in\nOntario, Canada, 5 new probable cases in Taiwan, 3 new probable cases in\nHong Kong, and 2 new probable cases in China (1 each from Beijing and Hebei).\nThe newswire report about asymptomatic infections in China (see [5][A]),\nwhile not substantiated through an official report, are not surprising. It\nis not unusual to have asymptomatic infections. Some of the questions that\narise are what proportion of those infected have an asymptomatic infection\n(or in reverse, what proportion of those infected have a clinical illness);\nand of significant import, do those individuals who have asymptomatic\ninfections transmit the SARS-associated coronavirus to others? More\ndetails on the study mentioned in the newswire would be appreciated, as\nwould information from other areas that may have addressed similar questions.\nThe newswire report from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) [5][B]\nis a bit confusing as it is unclear if the individuals mentioned were\nisolated because of contact with individual(s) with symptoms compatable\nwith SARS, or if they themselves had symptoms compatable with SARS. There\nis mention that the prior flight (before the flight to the DRC) was via\nJohannesburg, and there have not been reports of additional probable cases\nfrom South Africa. Clarification of this from official sources would be\nappreciated. - Mod.MPP]\nSee Also\nSARS - worldwide (127): cases 20030531.1333\nSARS - worldwide (126): cases 20030530.1325\nSARS - worldwide (125):cases 20030529.1313\nSARS - worldwide (124): cases 20030528.1310\nSARS - worldwide (93): etiology 20030505.1122\nSARS - worldwide (87): case definition and diagnostics 20030502.1103\nSARS - worldwide (85): clinical aspects 20030501.1094\nSARS - worldwide (69): diagnostic testing 20030425.1015\nSARS - worldwide (58): diagnostic testing 20030419.0958\nSARS - worldwide (51): etiology 20030416.0925\nSARS - worldwide (42): WHO historical overview 20030411.0878\nSARS - worldwide (38): etiology 20030410.0869\nSARS - Worldwide (34): etiology 20030408.0857\nSARS - worldwide (13): etiology 20030327.0758\nSARS - worldwide (04): etiology 20030325.0737\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - worldwide (17) 20030322.0713\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - Worldwide: alert (03) 20030316.0660\nSevere Acute Respiratory Syndrome - Worldwide 20030315.0637\nAcute respiratory syndrome - Canada (Ontario) 20030314.0631\nAcute respiratory syndrome - East Asia 20030314.0630\nAcute respiratory syndrome - China (HK), VietNam (03) 20030313.0624\nUndiagnosed illness - Vietnam (Hanoi): RFI 20030311.0595\nPneumonia - China (Guangdong) (07) 20030221.0452\nPneumonia - China (Guangdong): RFI 20030210.0357\n.................................mpp/pg/mpp\n\n*##########################################################*\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.

The China\nNews Service (CNS) reports that scientists have concluded that SARS can be\nasymptomatic, after studying people who had come in contact with Heyuan's\nfirst SARS case. Heyuan SARS experts checked [the case's] family members,\nhealth workers who treated him, the doctor in his village, and conducted\nblood tests on 5 of these people. CNS reports they found some of the 5\npeople have the SARS virus in their blood, but have not fallen ill and have\ndeveloped antibodies to fight the virus. The scientists believe people who\nhave developed antibodies for the SARS virus are not infectious. The\nreport could not immediately be confirmed.\n[B] Democratic Republic of the Congo from All Africa 30 May 2003\n<http://allafrica.com/stories/200305300538.html>\nSeveral persons suspected of being carriers of the SARS virus were put in\nquarantine last Sunday, 25 May 2003 at Kinshasa airport. The DR Congo's\nminister of health, L\u00e9onard Mashako Mamba, announced on Monday that all had\ncome from Hong Kong via South Africa. 2 Gambian citizens, a Congolese\nnational and a unspecified number of Hong Kong Chinese traveled in the same\nflight from the Far East to Johannesburg with passengers who showed the\nsymptoms of the disease, said Congolese health officials. The Congolese\nministry of health says the passengers were allowed to board the flight to\nKinshasa despite their request to the South African authorities, before the\nplane's departure, not to allow them to do so. The 2 Gambians and the\nCongolese were quarantined at Kinkole, to the east of Kinshasa, in a\nspecial clinic designed to host suspect SARS cases. But the Chinese\ncitizens could be expelled to South Africa, writes the independent APA news\nagency.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[In the past 24 hours there have been reports of 8 new probable cases in\nOntario, Canada, 5 new probable cases in Taiwan, 3 new probable cases in\nHong Kong, and 2 new probable cases in China (1 each from Beijing and Hebei).\nThe newswire report about asymptomatic infections in China (see [5][A]),\nwhile not substantiated through an official report, are not surprising. It\nis not unusual to have asymptomatic infections. Some of the questions that\narise are what proportion of those infected have an asymptomatic infection\n(or in reverse, what proportion of those infected have a clinical illness);\nand of significant import, do those individuals who have asymptomatic\ninfections transmit the SARS-associated coronavirus to others? More\ndetails on the study mentioned in the newswire would be appreciated, as\nwould information from other areas that may have addressed similar questions.\nThe newswire report from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) [5][B]\nis a bit confusing as it is unclear if the individuals mentioned were\nisolated because of contact with individual(s) with symptoms compatable\nwith SARS, or if they themselves had symptoms compatable with SARS. There\nis mention that the prior flight (before the flight to the DRC) was via\nJohannesburg, and there have not been reports of additional probable cases\nfrom South Africa. Clarification of this from official sources would be\nappreciated. - Mod.MPP]\nSee Also\nSARS - worldwide (127): cases 20030531.1333\nSARS - worldwide (126): cases 20030530.1325\nSARS - worldwide (125):cases 20030529.1313\nSARS - worldwide (124): cases 20030528.1310\nSARS - worldwide (93): etiology 20030505.1122\nSARS - worldwide (87): case definition and diagnostics 20030502.1103\nSARS - worldwide (85): clinical aspects 20030501.1094\nSARS - worldwide (69): diagnostic testing 20030425.1015\nSARS - worldwide (58): diagnostic testing 20030419.0958\nSARS - worldwide (51): etiology 20030416.0925\nSARS - worldwide (42): WHO historical overview 20030411.0878\nSARS - worldwide (38): etiology 20030410.0869\nSARS - Worldwide (34): etiology 20030408.0857\nSARS - worldwide (13): etiology 20030327.0758\nSARS - worldwide (04): etiology 20030325.0737\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - worldwide (17) 20030322.0713\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - Worldwide: alert (03) 20030316.0660\nSevere Acute Respiratory Syndrome - Worldwide 20030315.0637\nAcute respiratory syndrome - Canada (Ontario) 20030314.0631\nAcute respiratory syndrome - East Asia 20030314.0630\nAcute respiratory syndrome - China (HK), VietNam (03) 20030313.0624\nUndiagnosed illness - Vietnam (Hanoi): RFI 20030311.0595\nPneumonia - China (Guangdong) (07) 20030221.0452\nPneumonia - China (Guangdong): RFI 20030210.0357\n.................................mpp/pg/mpp\n\n*##########################################################*\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.

The China\nNews Service (CNS) reports that scientists have concluded that SARS can be\nasymptomatic, after studying people who had come in contact with Heyuan's\nfirst SARS case. Heyuan SARS experts checked [the case's] family members,\nhealth workers who treated him, the doctor in his village, and conducted\nblood tests on 5 of these people. CNS reports they found some of the 5\npeople have the SARS virus in their blood, but have not fallen ill and have\ndeveloped antibodies to fight the virus. The scientists believe people who\nhave developed antibodies for the SARS virus are not infectious. The\nreport could not immediately be confirmed.\n[B] Democratic Republic of the Congo from All Africa 30 May 2003\n<http://allafrica.com/stories/200305300538.html>\nSeveral persons suspected of being carriers of the SARS virus were put in\nquarantine last Sunday, 25 May 2003 at Kinshasa airport. The DR Congo's\nminister of health, L\u00e9onard Mashako Mamba, announced on Monday that all had\ncome from Hong Kong via South Africa. 2 Gambian citizens, a Congolese\nnational and a unspecified number of Hong Kong Chinese traveled in the same\nflight from the Far East to Johannesburg with passengers who showed the\nsymptoms of the disease, said Congolese health officials. The Congolese\nministry of health says the passengers were allowed to board the flight to\nKinshasa despite their request to the South African authorities, before the\nplane's departure, not to allow them to do so. The 2 Gambians and the\nCongolese were quarantined at Kinkole, to the east of Kinshasa, in a\nspecial clinic designed to host suspect SARS cases. But the Chinese\ncitizens could be expelled to South Africa, writes the independent APA news\nagency.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[In the past 24 hours there have been reports of 8 new probable cases in\nOntario, Canada, 5 new probable cases in Taiwan, 3 new probable cases in\nHong Kong, and 2 new probable cases in China (1 each from Beijing and Hebei).\nThe newswire report about asymptomatic infections in China (see [5][A]),\nwhile not substantiated through an official report, are not surprising. It\nis not unusual to have asymptomatic infections. Some of the questions that\narise are what proportion of those infected have an asymptomatic infection\n(or in reverse, what proportion of those infected have a clinical illness);\nand of significant import, do those individuals who have asymptomatic\ninfections transmit the SARS-associated coronavirus to others? More\ndetails on the study mentioned in the newswire would be appreciated, as\nwould information from other areas that may have addressed similar questions.\nThe newswire report from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) [5][B]\nis a bit confusing as it is unclear if the individuals mentioned were\nisolated because of contact with individual(s) with symptoms compatable\nwith SARS, or if they themselves had symptoms compatable with SARS. There\nis mention that the prior flight (before the flight to the DRC) was via\nJohannesburg, and there have not been reports of additional probable cases\nfrom South Africa. Clarification of this from official sources would be\nappreciated. - Mod.MPP]\nSee Also\nSARS - worldwide (127): cases 20030531.1333\nSARS - worldwide (126): cases 20030530.1325\nSARS - worldwide (125):cases 20030529.1313\nSARS - worldwide (124): cases 20030528.1310\nSARS - worldwide (93): etiology 20030505.1122\nSARS - worldwide (87): case definition and diagnostics 20030502.1103\nSARS - worldwide (85): clinical aspects 20030501.1094\nSARS - worldwide (69): diagnostic testing 20030425.1015\nSARS - worldwide (58): diagnostic testing 20030419.0958\nSARS - worldwide (51): etiology 20030416.0925\nSARS - worldwide (42): WHO historical overview 20030411.0878\nSARS - worldwide (38): etiology 20030410.0869\nSARS - Worldwide (34): etiology 20030408.0857\nSARS - worldwide (13): etiology 20030327.0758\nSARS - worldwide (04): etiology 20030325.0737\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - worldwide (17) 20030322.0713\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - Worldwide: alert (03) 20030316.0660\nSevere Acute Respiratory Syndrome - Worldwide 20030315.0637\nAcute respiratory syndrome - Canada (Ontario) 20030314.0631\nAcute respiratory syndrome - East Asia 20030314.0630\nAcute respiratory syndrome - China (HK), VietNam (03) 20030313.0624\nUndiagnosed illness - Vietnam (Hanoi): RFI 20030311.0595\nPneumonia - China (Guangdong) (07) 20030221.0452\nPneumonia - China (Guangdong): RFI 20030210.0357\n.................................mpp/pg/mpp\n\n*##########################################################*\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.

Heyuan SARS experts checked [the case's] family members,\nhealth workers who treated him, the doctor in his village, and conducted\nblood tests on 5 of these people. CNS reports they found some of the 5\npeople have the SARS virus in their blood, but have not fallen ill and have\ndeveloped antibodies to fight the virus. The scientists believe people who\nhave developed antibodies for the SARS virus are not infectious. The\nreport could not immediately be confirmed.\n[B] Democratic Republic of the Congo from All Africa 30 May 2003\n<http://allafrica.com/stories/200305300538.html>\nSeveral persons suspected of being carriers of the SARS virus were put in\nquarantine last Sunday, 25 May 2003 at Kinshasa airport. The DR Congo's\nminister of health, L\u00e9onard Mashako Mamba, announced on Monday that all had\ncome from Hong Kong via South Africa. 2 Gambian citizens, a Congolese\nnational and a unspecified number of Hong Kong Chinese traveled in the same\nflight from the Far East to Johannesburg with passengers who showed the\nsymptoms of the disease, said Congolese health officials. The Congolese\nministry of health says the passengers were allowed to board the flight to\nKinshasa despite their request to the South African authorities, before the\nplane's departure, not to allow them to do so. The 2 Gambians and the\nCongolese were quarantined at Kinkole, to the east of Kinshasa, in a\nspecial clinic designed to host suspect SARS cases. But the Chinese\ncitizens could be expelled to South Africa, writes the independent APA news\nagency.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[In the past 24 hours there have been reports of 8 new probable cases in\nOntario, Canada, 5 new probable cases in Taiwan, 3 new probable cases in\nHong Kong, and 2 new probable cases in China (1 each from Beijing and Hebei).\nThe newswire report about asymptomatic infections in China (see [5][A]),\nwhile not substantiated through an official report, are not surprising. It\nis not unusual to have asymptomatic infections. Some of the questions that\narise are what proportion of those infected have an asymptomatic infection\n(or in reverse, what proportion of those infected have a clinical illness);\nand of significant import, do those individuals who have asymptomatic\ninfections transmit the SARS-associated coronavirus to others? More\ndetails on the study mentioned in the newswire would be appreciated, as\nwould information from other areas that may have addressed similar questions.\nThe newswire report from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) [5][B]\nis a bit confusing as it is unclear if the individuals mentioned were\nisolated because of contact with individual(s) with symptoms compatable\nwith SARS, or if they themselves had symptoms compatable with SARS. There\nis mention that the prior flight (before the flight to the DRC) was via\nJohannesburg, and there have not been reports of additional probable cases\nfrom South Africa. Clarification of this from official sources would be\nappreciated. - Mod.MPP]\nSee Also\nSARS - worldwide (127): cases 20030531.1333\nSARS - worldwide (126): cases 20030530.1325\nSARS - worldwide (125):cases 20030529.1313\nSARS - worldwide (124): cases 20030528.1310\nSARS - worldwide (93): etiology 20030505.1122\nSARS - worldwide (87): case definition and diagnostics 20030502.1103\nSARS - worldwide (85): clinical aspects 20030501.1094\nSARS - worldwide (69): diagnostic testing 20030425.1015\nSARS - worldwide (58): diagnostic testing 20030419.0958\nSARS - worldwide (51): etiology 20030416.0925\nSARS - worldwide (42): WHO historical overview 20030411.0878\nSARS - worldwide (38): etiology 20030410.0869\nSARS - Worldwide (34): etiology 20030408.0857\nSARS - worldwide (13): etiology 20030327.0758\nSARS - worldwide (04): etiology 20030325.0737\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - worldwide (17) 20030322.0713\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - Worldwide: alert (03) 20030316.0660\nSevere Acute Respiratory Syndrome - Worldwide 20030315.0637\nAcute respiratory syndrome - Canada (Ontario) 20030314.0631\nAcute respiratory syndrome - East Asia 20030314.0630\nAcute respiratory syndrome - China (HK), VietNam (03) 20030313.0624\nUndiagnosed illness - Vietnam (Hanoi): RFI 20030311.0595\nPneumonia - China (Guangdong) (07) 20030221.0452\nPneumonia - China (Guangdong): RFI 20030210.0357\n.................................mpp/pg/mpp\n\n*##########################################################*\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.

Indeed, the newswires have periodically mentioned the\noverburdening of the healthcare sector, and some areas have \"closed\"\nhospitals in which transmission has been documented.\nPlease address all responses directly to Dr. Dalton using the contact\ninformation for him given above. - Mod.MPP]\nSee Also\nSARS - worldwide (73): cases 20030427.1038\nSARS - worldwide (72): treatment 20030427.1037\nSARS - worldwide (71): cases 20030426.1026\nSARS - worldwide (69): diagnostic testing 20030425.1015\nSARS - worldwide (68): etiology 20030425.1010\nSARS - worldwide (64): etiology 20030423.0996\nSARS - worldwide (63): etiology 20030423.0994\nSARS - worldwide (58): diagnostic testing 20030419.0958\nSARS - worldwide (53): etiology 20030417.0935\nSARS - worldwide (51): etiology 20030416.0925\nSARS - worldwide (46): diagnostic test 20030413.0901\nSARS - worldwide (42): WHO historical overview 20030411.0878\nSARS - worldwide (41):overview 20030411.0876\nSARS - worldwide (38): etiology 20030410.0869\nSARS - Worldwide (34): etiology 20030408.0857\nSARS - worldwide (13): etiology 20030327.0758\nSARS - worldwide (04): etiology 20030325.0737\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - worldwide (17) 20030322.0713\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - Worldwide: alert (03) 20030316.0660\nSevere Acute Respiratory Syndrome - Worldwide 20030315.0637\nAcute respiratory syndrome - Canada (Ontario) 20030314.0631\nAcute respiratory syndrome - East Asia 20030314.0630\nAcute respiratory syndrome - China (HK), VietNam (03) 20030313.0624\nUndiagnosed illness - Vietnam (Hanoi): RFI 20030311.0595\nPneumonia - China (Guangdong) (07) 20030221.0452\nPneumonia - China (Guangdong): RFI 20030210.0357\n.......................mpp/pg/lm\n*##########################################################*\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.

Since these\nmutations were well conserved among mainland isolates, but not found in\nother isolates linked to the Metropole Hotel, I thought that the data\nsupported a Metropole source containing a mixture of variants. Although\nCUHK-W1 was isolated from a patient from the Prince of Wales Hospital, I\nhave been informed by Dennis Lo and Stephen Tsui, who were involved in the\nsequencing of this isolate, that the patient was not one of the 138\npatients linked to the visitor of the Metropole Hotel. This patient had\ntraveled to Thailand and mainland China shortly before developing SARS\nsymptoms, suggesting an origin outside of Hong Kong, consistent with the\nshared mutations found with mainland China isolates.\nIn addition to the D-to-E mutation at position 5768 in orf1ab, which is\nfound in CUHK-W1, GZ01, BJ01, BJ02, BJ03, BJ04, there is another mutation\nof a T changing to I at position 244 in E2. This amino acid is found in all\n6 isolates. Thus, these 2 sets of shared mutations define 2 hot spots where\n6 of the sequenced isolates have one amino acid while the other 4 have\nanother. This distribution raises the possibility that the true mutations\nare the amino acids shared by the Tor2, Urbani, KYK, and HKU-39849\nisolates. I have not yet been able to obtain the history of the HKU-39849\nisolate. However, there is another shared mutation at position 577 of E2 in\nwhich S replaces A. This mutation is found in KYK, which is from a tourist\nwho stayed at the Metropole Hotel. However, the mutation is shared with,\nBJ01 and GZ01, isolates from the mainland. This mutation is not seen in\nTor2 or Urbani, 2 isolates closely linked to the Metropole Hotel. Thus, the\ndistribution of this mutation supports the notion that the infections at\nthe Metropole Hotel involved a number of variants. As noted above, however,\nTor2, Urbani, KYK, and HKU-39849 share amino acids found at position 5769\nin orf1ab and position 244 in E2, which supports a more closely related\nsource of the infections at the Metropole Hotel.\nThese shared mutations, especially the 2 loci that are shared by the 5\nmainland isolates and CUHK-W1, support an etiological role for SARS\ncoronavirus in SARS.\nHere is the list of shared mutations:\n(1) orf1ab [the putative polymerase gene]:\n3047 V to A [Val to Ala] in BJ01, BJ02, BJ03, CUHK-W1\n3072 V to A [Val to Ala] in CUHK-W1*\n3196 A to V [Ala to Val} in BJ01, BJ02, BJ03\n5768 D to E [Asp to Glu] in BJ01, BJ02, BJ03, BJ04, GZ01, CUHK-W1\n(2) E2 [putative glycoprotein gene]:\n77 G to D [Gly toAsp] in BJ03, CUHK-W1\n244 T to I [Thr to Ile] in BJ01, BJ02, BJ03, BJ04, GZ01, CUHK-W1\n577 A to S [Ala to Ser] in KYK, BJ01, GZ01\n(3) N [putative nucleoprotein gene]\n387 N to P [Asn to Pro] in GZ01, BJ02\n* This change is only in CUHK-W1, not BJ01, BJ02, BJ03 as reported\nyesterday [see: SARS - worldwide (63): etiology 20030423.0994] - the 3\nBeijing isolates have a shared mutation at position 3196, which is A to V,\nas well as V to A change at position 3047.\n--\nHenry L Niman, PhD\nDepartment of Bioengineering\nShriners' Burn Center\n51 Blossom Street, Room 422\nBoston, MA 02114 USA\n<henry_niman@hms.harvard.edu>\n[For the benefit of readers, the key to the virus isolates identified above\nis the following:\nTor2 (Toronto)\nCUHK-W1 (Hong Kong)\nUrbani (Hanoi/Bangkok)\nKYK (Singapore)\nHKU-39849 (Hong Kong)\nGZ01 (Guangzhou)\nBJ01 (Beijing)\nBJ02 (Beijing)\nBJ03 (Beijing)\nBJ04 (Beijing)\n- Mod.CP]\n******\n[2]\nDate: Thu 24 Apr 2003\nFrom: Henry L Niman, PhD <henry_niman@hms.harvard.edu>\n\n2 distinct SARS virus variants from the same patient\n----------------------------------------------------\nThis issue of SARS mutations will likely be viewed with increased interest.\nMore information is now available on the 5 isolates from mainland China\n<http://www.genomics.org.cn:8080/bgi/news/zhongxin/news030416-2_fasta.htm>.\nOne area of interest is a comparisons of mutations in 2 isolates (BJ01 and\nBJ03) from the same individual. The partial data have been submitted to\nGenebank, and it is possible that there are some sequencing errors, but the\ndata are quite strong for multiple variants in the same individual.\nThere are 4 mutations shared between BJ01 and BJ03. 2 of them are found in\nall 5 mainland china isolates as well as CUHK-W1, and the 4 other isolates\nmay be the true mutations. The 2 widely shared alterations are at position\n5768 in orf1ab [the putative polymerase gene] (D changing to E) and I\nchanging to T at position 244 in E2 [putative glycoprotein gene]. Another\nmutation shared between BJ01 and BJ03 is also found in BJ02 and CUHK-W1 (V\nchanging to A at position 3196). This change is found in BJ02 and CUHK-W1\nat position 3047 in orf1ab [the putative polymerase gene]. The fourth\nchange shared between BJ01 and BJ03 is also found in BJ02 (A changing to V\nat position 3196 in orf1ab).\nHowever, in addition to the 4 mutations shared between BJ01 and BJ03, each\nisolate has mutations not shared. BJ01 has 3 additional mutations not\nshared with the 9 other isolates. All 3 changes are in orf1ab at positions\n1718 (L to W), 2230 (A to V), and 2770 (V to I). Since these changes have\nnot been seen elsewhere, sequencing errors remain a possibility (although\nnot likely).\nIn contrast, BJ03 also has 3 mutations not found in BJ01, but 2 of these\nmutations have been found in other isolates, reducing the likelihood that\nthey are due to sequencing errors. The mutation unique to BJ03 is also in\norf1ab at position 3426 (V to I). Of interest are the 2 other mutations in\nE2. At position 78, the change of G to D is also found in CUHK-W1, while\nthe A to S change at position 577 is also found in KYK and GZ01, which were\nfrom patients in Singapore and Guangzhou, respectively.\nThe finding of this A to S mutation in isolates from 2 other geographically\ndistinct regions, but not in another isolate from the same patient, raises\nissues of multiple variants within the same patient as well as tissue\ntropism linked to specific amino acid changes.\n--\nHenry L Niman, PhD\nDepartment of Bioengineering\nShriners' Burn Center\n51 Blossom Street, Room 422\nBoston, MA 02114 USA\n<henry_niman@hms.harvard.edu>\n[All RNA viruses by their nature are inherently highly mutable; while these\nsequence comparisons of a small number of SARS coronavirus isolates are\nintriguing, it is perhaps too early to speculate on the biological\nsignificance of any of these variable sites. - Mod.CP]\nSee Also\nSARS - worldwide (67): cases 20030424.1007\nSARS - worldwide (64): etiology 20030423.0996\nSARS - worldwide (63): etiology 20030423.0994\nSARS - worldwide (58): diagnostic testing 20030419.0958\nSARS - worldwide (53): etiology 20030417.0935\nSARS - worldwide (51): etiology 20030416.0925\nSARS - worldwide (46): diagnostic test 20030413.0901\nSARS - worldwide (44): UK transmission suspected 20030412.0887\nSARS - worldwide (42): WHO historical overview 20030411.0878\nSARS - worldwide (41):overview 20030411.0876\nSARS - worldwide (38): etiology 20030410.0869\nSARS - Worldwide (34): etiology 20030408.0857\nSARS - worldwide (13): etiology 20030327.0758\nSARS - worldwide (04): etiology 20030325.0737\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - worldwide (17) 20030322.0713\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - Worldwide: alert (03) 20030316.0660\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - Worldwide (02):alert 20030315.0649\nSevere Acute Respiratory Syndrome - Worldwide 20030315.0637\nAcute respiratory syndrome - Canada (Ontario) 20030314.0631\nAcute respiratory syndrome - East Asia 20030314.0630\nAcute respiratory syndrome - China (HK), VietNam (03) 20030313.0624\nUndiagnosed illness - Vietnam (Hanoi): RFI 20030311.0595\nPneumonia - China (Guangdong) (07) 20030221.0452\nPneumonia - China (Guangdong): RFI 20030210.0357\n.....................cp/pg/sh\n*##########################################################*\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.

Since these\nmutations were well conserved among mainland isolates, but not found in\nother isolates linked to the Metropole Hotel, I thought that the data\nsupported a Metropole source containing a mixture of variants. Although\nCUHK-W1 was isolated from a patient from the Prince of Wales Hospital, I\nhave been informed by Dennis Lo and Stephen Tsui, who were involved in the\nsequencing of this isolate, that the patient was not one of the 138\npatients linked to the visitor of the Metropole Hotel. This patient had\ntraveled to Thailand and mainland China shortly before developing SARS\nsymptoms, suggesting an origin outside of Hong Kong, consistent with the\nshared mutations found with mainland China isolates.\nIn addition to the D-to-E mutation at position 5768 in orf1ab, which is\nfound in CUHK-W1, GZ01, BJ01, BJ02, BJ03, BJ04, there is another mutation\nof a T changing to I at position 244 in E2. This amino acid is found in all\n6 isolates. Thus, these 2 sets of shared mutations define 2 hot spots where\n6 of the sequenced isolates have one amino acid while the other 4 have\nanother. This distribution raises the possibility that the true mutations\nare the amino acids shared by the Tor2, Urbani, KYK, and HKU-39849\nisolates. I have not yet been able to obtain the history of the HKU-39849\nisolate. However, there is another shared mutation at position 577 of E2 in\nwhich S replaces A. This mutation is found in KYK, which is from a tourist\nwho stayed at the Metropole Hotel. However, the mutation is shared with,\nBJ01 and GZ01, isolates from the mainland. This mutation is not seen in\nTor2 or Urbani, 2 isolates closely linked to the Metropole Hotel. Thus, the\ndistribution of this mutation supports the notion that the infections at\nthe Metropole Hotel involved a number of variants. As noted above, however,\nTor2, Urbani, KYK, and HKU-39849 share amino acids found at position 5769\nin orf1ab and position 244 in E2, which supports a more closely related\nsource of the infections at the Metropole Hotel.\nThese shared mutations, especially the 2 loci that are shared by the 5\nmainland isolates and CUHK-W1, support an etiological role for SARS\ncoronavirus in SARS.\nHere is the list of shared mutations:\n(1) orf1ab [the putative polymerase gene]:\n3047 V to A [Val to Ala] in BJ01, BJ02, BJ03, CUHK-W1\n3072 V to A [Val to Ala] in CUHK-W1*\n3196 A to V [Ala to Val} in BJ01, BJ02, BJ03\n5768 D to E [Asp to Glu] in BJ01, BJ02, BJ03, BJ04, GZ01, CUHK-W1\n(2) E2 [putative glycoprotein gene]:\n77 G to D [Gly toAsp] in BJ03, CUHK-W1\n244 T to I [Thr to Ile] in BJ01, BJ02, BJ03, BJ04, GZ01, CUHK-W1\n577 A to S [Ala to Ser] in KYK, BJ01, GZ01\n(3) N [putative nucleoprotein gene]\n387 N to P [Asn to Pro] in GZ01, BJ02\n* This change is only in CUHK-W1, not BJ01, BJ02, BJ03 as reported\nyesterday [see: SARS - worldwide (63): etiology 20030423.0994] - the 3\nBeijing isolates have a shared mutation at position 3196, which is A to V,\nas well as V to A change at position 3047.\n--\nHenry L Niman, PhD\nDepartment of Bioengineering\nShriners' Burn Center\n51 Blossom Street, Room 422\nBoston, MA 02114 USA\n<henry_niman@hms.harvard.edu>\n[For the benefit of readers, the key to the virus isolates identified above\nis the following:\nTor2 (Toronto)\nCUHK-W1 (Hong Kong)\nUrbani (Hanoi/Bangkok)\nKYK (Singapore)\nHKU-39849 (Hong Kong)\nGZ01 (Guangzhou)\nBJ01 (Beijing)\nBJ02 (Beijing)\nBJ03 (Beijing)\nBJ04 (Beijing)\n- Mod.CP]\n******\n[2]\nDate: Thu 24 Apr 2003\nFrom: Henry L Niman, PhD <henry_niman@hms.harvard.edu>\n\n2 distinct SARS virus variants from the same patient\n----------------------------------------------------\nThis issue of SARS mutations will likely be viewed with increased interest.\nMore information is now available on the 5 isolates from mainland China\n<http://www.genomics.org.cn:8080/bgi/news/zhongxin/news030416-2_fasta.htm>.\nOne area of interest is a comparisons of mutations in 2 isolates (BJ01 and\nBJ03) from the same individual.

Since these\nmutations were well conserved among mainland isolates, but not found in\nother isolates linked to the Metropole Hotel, I thought that the data\nsupported a Metropole source containing a mixture of variants. Although\nCUHK-W1 was isolated from a patient from the Prince of Wales Hospital, I\nhave been informed by Dennis Lo and Stephen Tsui, who were involved in the\nsequencing of this isolate, that the patient was not one of the 138\npatients linked to the visitor of the Metropole Hotel. This patient had\ntraveled to Thailand and mainland China shortly before developing SARS\nsymptoms, suggesting an origin outside of Hong Kong, consistent with the\nshared mutations found with mainland China isolates.\nIn addition to the D-to-E mutation at position 5768 in orf1ab, which is\nfound in CUHK-W1, GZ01, BJ01, BJ02, BJ03, BJ04, there is another mutation\nof a T changing to I at position 244 in E2. This amino acid is found in all\n6 isolates. Thus, these 2 sets of shared mutations define 2 hot spots where\n6 of the sequenced isolates have one amino acid while the other 4 have\nanother. This distribution raises the possibility that the true mutations\nare the amino acids shared by the Tor2, Urbani, KYK, and HKU-39849\nisolates. I have not yet been able to obtain the history of the HKU-39849\nisolate. However, there is another shared mutation at position 577 of E2 in\nwhich S replaces A. This mutation is found in KYK, which is from a tourist\nwho stayed at the Metropole Hotel. However, the mutation is shared with,\nBJ01 and GZ01, isolates from the mainland. This mutation is not seen in\nTor2 or Urbani, 2 isolates closely linked to the Metropole Hotel. Thus, the\ndistribution of this mutation supports the notion that the infections at\nthe Metropole Hotel involved a number of variants. As noted above, however,\nTor2, Urbani, KYK, and HKU-39849 share amino acids found at position 5769\nin orf1ab and position 244 in E2, which supports a more closely related\nsource of the infections at the Metropole Hotel.\nThese shared mutations, especially the 2 loci that are shared by the 5\nmainland isolates and CUHK-W1, support an etiological role for SARS\ncoronavirus in SARS.\nHere is the list of shared mutations:\n(1) orf1ab [the putative polymerase gene]:\n3047 V to A [Val to Ala] in BJ01, BJ02, BJ03, CUHK-W1\n3072 V to A [Val to Ala] in CUHK-W1*\n3196 A to V [Ala to Val} in BJ01, BJ02, BJ03\n5768 D to E [Asp to Glu] in BJ01, BJ02, BJ03, BJ04, GZ01, CUHK-W1\n(2) E2 [putative glycoprotein gene]:\n77 G to D [Gly toAsp] in BJ03, CUHK-W1\n244 T to I [Thr to Ile] in BJ01, BJ02, BJ03, BJ04, GZ01, CUHK-W1\n577 A to S [Ala to Ser] in KYK, BJ01, GZ01\n(3) N [putative nucleoprotein gene]\n387 N to P [Asn to Pro] in GZ01, BJ02\n* This change is only in CUHK-W1, not BJ01, BJ02, BJ03 as reported\nyesterday [see: SARS - worldwide (63): etiology 20030423.0994] - the 3\nBeijing isolates have a shared mutation at position 3196, which is A to V,\nas well as V to A change at position 3047.\n--\nHenry L Niman, PhD\nDepartment of Bioengineering\nShriners' Burn Center\n51 Blossom Street, Room 422\nBoston, MA 02114 USA\n<henry_niman@hms.harvard.edu>\n[For the benefit of readers, the key to the virus isolates identified above\nis the following:\nTor2 (Toronto)\nCUHK-W1 (Hong Kong)\nUrbani (Hanoi/Bangkok)\nKYK (Singapore)\nHKU-39849 (Hong Kong)\nGZ01 (Guangzhou)\nBJ01 (Beijing)\nBJ02 (Beijing)\nBJ03 (Beijing)\nBJ04 (Beijing)\n- Mod.CP]\n******\n[2]\nDate: Thu 24 Apr 2003\nFrom: Henry L Niman, PhD <henry_niman@hms.harvard.edu>\n\n2 distinct SARS virus variants from the same patient\n----------------------------------------------------\nThis issue of SARS mutations will likely be viewed with increased interest.\nMore information is now available on the 5 isolates from mainland China\n<http://www.genomics.org.cn:8080/bgi/news/zhongxin/news030416-2_fasta.htm>.\nOne area of interest is a comparisons of mutations in 2 isolates (BJ01 and\nBJ03) from the same individual.

Since these\nmutations were well conserved among mainland isolates, but not found in\nother isolates linked to the Metropole Hotel, I thought that the data\nsupported a Metropole source containing a mixture of variants. Although\nCUHK-W1 was isolated from a patient from the Prince of Wales Hospital, I\nhave been informed by Dennis Lo and Stephen Tsui, who were involved in the\nsequencing of this isolate, that the patient was not one of the 138\npatients linked to the visitor of the Metropole Hotel. This patient had\ntraveled to Thailand and mainland China shortly before developing SARS\nsymptoms, suggesting an origin outside of Hong Kong, consistent with the\nshared mutations found with mainland China isolates.\nIn addition to the D-to-E mutation at position 5768 in orf1ab, which is\nfound in CUHK-W1, GZ01, BJ01, BJ02, BJ03, BJ04, there is another mutation\nof a T changing to I at position 244 in E2. This amino acid is found in all\n6 isolates. Thus, these 2 sets of shared mutations define 2 hot spots where\n6 of the sequenced isolates have one amino acid while the other 4 have\nanother. This distribution raises the possibility that the true mutations\nare the amino acids shared by the Tor2, Urbani, KYK, and HKU-39849\nisolates. I have not yet been able to obtain the history of the HKU-39849\nisolate. However, there is another shared mutation at position 577 of E2 in\nwhich S replaces A. This mutation is found in KYK, which is from a tourist\nwho stayed at the Metropole Hotel. However, the mutation is shared with,\nBJ01 and GZ01, isolates from the mainland. This mutation is not seen in\nTor2 or Urbani, 2 isolates closely linked to the Metropole Hotel. Thus, the\ndistribution of this mutation supports the notion that the infections at\nthe Metropole Hotel involved a number of variants. As noted above, however,\nTor2, Urbani, KYK, and HKU-39849 share amino acids found at position 5769\nin orf1ab and position 244 in E2, which supports a more closely related\nsource of the infections at the Metropole Hotel.\nThese shared mutations, especially the 2 loci that are shared by the 5\nmainland isolates and CUHK-W1, support an etiological role for SARS\ncoronavirus in SARS.\nHere is the list of shared mutations:\n(1) orf1ab [the putative polymerase gene]:\n3047 V to A [Val to Ala] in BJ01, BJ02, BJ03, CUHK-W1\n3072 V to A [Val to Ala] in CUHK-W1*\n3196 A to V [Ala to Val} in BJ01, BJ02, BJ03\n5768 D to E [Asp to Glu] in BJ01, BJ02, BJ03, BJ04, GZ01, CUHK-W1\n(2) E2 [putative glycoprotein gene]:\n77 G to D [Gly toAsp] in BJ03, CUHK-W1\n244 T to I [Thr to Ile] in BJ01, BJ02, BJ03, BJ04, GZ01, CUHK-W1\n577 A to S [Ala to Ser] in KYK, BJ01, GZ01\n(3) N [putative nucleoprotein gene]\n387 N to P [Asn to Pro] in GZ01, BJ02\n* This change is only in CUHK-W1, not BJ01, BJ02, BJ03 as reported\nyesterday [see: SARS - worldwide (63): etiology 20030423.0994] - the 3\nBeijing isolates have a shared mutation at position 3196, which is A to V,\nas well as V to A change at position 3047.\n--\nHenry L Niman, PhD\nDepartment of Bioengineering\nShriners' Burn Center\n51 Blossom Street, Room 422\nBoston, MA 02114 USA\n<henry_niman@hms.harvard.edu>\n[For the benefit of readers, the key to the virus isolates identified above\nis the following:\nTor2 (Toronto)\nCUHK-W1 (Hong Kong)\nUrbani (Hanoi/Bangkok)\nKYK (Singapore)\nHKU-39849 (Hong Kong)\nGZ01 (Guangzhou)\nBJ01 (Beijing)\nBJ02 (Beijing)\nBJ03 (Beijing)\nBJ04 (Beijing)\n- Mod.CP]\n******\n[2]\nDate: Thu 24 Apr 2003\nFrom: Henry L Niman, PhD <henry_niman@hms.harvard.edu>\n\n2 distinct SARS virus variants from the same patient\n----------------------------------------------------\nThis issue of SARS mutations will likely be viewed with increased interest.\nMore information is now available on the 5 isolates from mainland China\n<http://www.genomics.org.cn:8080/bgi/news/zhongxin/news030416-2_fasta.htm>.\nOne area of interest is a comparisons of mutations in 2 isolates (BJ01 and\nBJ03) from the same individual.

At position 78, the change of G to D is also found in CUHK-W1, while\nthe A to S change at position 577 is also found in KYK and GZ01, which were\nfrom patients in Singapore and Guangzhou, respectively.\nThe finding of this A to S mutation in isolates from 2 other geographically\ndistinct regions, but not in another isolate from the same patient, raises\nissues of multiple variants within the same patient as well as tissue\ntropism linked to specific amino acid changes.\n--\nHenry L Niman, PhD\nDepartment of Bioengineering\nShriners' Burn Center\n51 Blossom Street, Room 422\nBoston, MA 02114 USA\n<henry_niman@hms.harvard.edu>\n[All RNA viruses by their nature are inherently highly mutable; while these\nsequence comparisons of a small number of SARS coronavirus isolates are\nintriguing, it is perhaps too early to speculate on the biological\nsignificance of any of these variable sites. - Mod.CP]\nSee Also\nSARS - worldwide (67): cases 20030424.1007\nSARS - worldwide (64): etiology 20030423.0996\nSARS - worldwide (63): etiology 20030423.0994\nSARS - worldwide (58): diagnostic testing 20030419.0958\nSARS - worldwide (53): etiology 20030417.0935\nSARS - worldwide (51): etiology 20030416.0925\nSARS - worldwide (46): diagnostic test 20030413.0901\nSARS - worldwide (44): UK transmission suspected 20030412.0887\nSARS - worldwide (42): WHO historical overview 20030411.0878\nSARS - worldwide (41):overview 20030411.0876\nSARS - worldwide (38): etiology 20030410.0869\nSARS - Worldwide (34): etiology 20030408.0857\nSARS - worldwide (13): etiology 20030327.0758\nSARS - worldwide (04): etiology 20030325.0737\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - worldwide (17) 20030322.0713\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - Worldwide: alert (03) 20030316.0660\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - Worldwide (02):alert 20030315.0649\nSevere Acute Respiratory Syndrome - Worldwide 20030315.0637\nAcute respiratory syndrome - Canada (Ontario) 20030314.0631\nAcute respiratory syndrome - East Asia 20030314.0630\nAcute respiratory syndrome - China (HK), VietNam (03) 20030313.0624\nUndiagnosed illness - Vietnam (Hanoi): RFI 20030311.0595\nPneumonia - China (Guangdong) (07) 20030221.0452\nPneumonia - China (Guangdong): RFI 20030210.0357\n.....................cp/pg/sh\n*##########################################################*\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.

Struggling to stop the spread of the disease, officials canceled a\nmajor week-long holiday in May, when tens of millions of people usually go\ntraveling.\nThe demotion of Health Minister Zhang Wenkang and Beijing Mayor Meng\nXuenong came shortly after officials held a 2-hour news conference to\nannounce the sharp increases in SARS cases. Zhang lost his post as\nsecretary of the leading party members' group of the Ministry of Health.\nMeng was removed as the deputy secretary of the party's Beijing Municipal\nCommittee.\nThe government said Sunday the flu-like illness has killed 12 more people\nand that the number of infections in Beijing has soared from 37 to\n346. The new figures raised China's total number of deaths to 79 and its\ncases to 1814, Gao Qiang, an executive vice health minister, said at a news\nconference. \"With such a situation, with more than 300 patients in\nBeijing, the situation is already very serious,\" Gao said. He added there\nwere 402 more suspected cases in the capital.\nGao also made a rare admission that his ministry was not properly prepared\nfor the outbreak. The ministry \"has not given out clear instructions or\neffective guidance,\" he said. But Gao denied reports that SARS cases were\nintentionally hidden from investigators. \"We have not discovered any\nlocality or place that has intentionally hidden these statistics,\" he said.\nIn recent weeks, several nations have urged their citizens to avoid\nunnecessary travel to China. However, the Chinese government continued to\nencourage the public to stick with plans to go on vacations during the\nweek-long May Day holiday, which was to start 1 May 2003. Marking a major\nshift in how China is viewing the SARS danger, Gao said that officials were\ncanceling the vacation period, which has been extended in recent years to\nboost the travel industry and encourage consumer spending. \"The purpose of\nsuch an act is to prevent the massive movement of people and the possible\nspread of the disease,\" Gao said. He acknowledged that the advisory could\ndeal a big blow to China's economy. \"I'm sure this measure will mean\nmassive losses in tourism revenue, but people's lives and health had to be\nput above everything else,\" Gao said.\nSo far, officials have not detected the spread of SARS in large rural\nareas, he said. He noted that farmers have lower incomes and less access to\nmedical care. If the outbreak hit the countryside, \"the consequences would\nbe grim,\" he said.\n[B] China Admits Much Higher Number of SARS Cases\n<http://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/20/international/asia/20CND-CHIN.html>\nWith bureaucratic shuffling and an apologetic, 2-hour news conference, a\nsenior health official, .... admitted to the existence of a large number of\npreviously undisclosed SARS patients in military hospitals and revealed\nwhat he called the first aggressive survey of cases in some 70 scattered\nhospitals. \"Accurate figures have not been reported to high authorities in\na timely manner,\" he added, though he later argued that incompetence rather\nthan deliberate deceit was the main problem. In an unusual move for such\nsensitive and embarrassing news, the news conference was broadcast live on\na national television channel.\nThe unveiling of markedly higher disease figures as well as the firings\n(perhaps the first of many) capped a tense week in which China's efforts to\nplay down SARS, especially in Beijing, were assailed by experts from the\nWorld Health Organization and questioned by medical whistleblowers here and\nby Beijing residents, who through word of mouth began hearing about far\nmore patients than officials had acknowledged.\nToday, Mr. Gao of the Health Ministry repeatedly tried to heap blame on the\nministry's shortcomings, and to the disarray in Beijing where several\npolitical jurisdictions, including municipal, national, military, and\nothers, overlap but have not coordinated disease-control efforts. As of\ntoday, Beijing city health officials will oversee all anti-SARS measures\nthroughout the urban area, including at military hospitals, Mr. Gao\nannounced. Mr. Gao also expressed concern about the spreading reports of\nSARS in several inland provinces, while some outside experts said the case\nreports from some distant provinces seemed too low. A major source of\nerror in previous Beijing reports was the exclusion of patients in several\nmajor hospitals that are run by the military, but which also hold civilian\npatients. The angry public assertion by a retired military surgeon that\nmore than 100 SARS patients were in the military system and being omitted\nfrom public reports was a major blow to the government's credibility and\ntoday, Mr. Gao revealed that the discrepancy was still greater. Of 353 SARS\npatients still in the hospital on Friday [18 Apr 2003], he said, 235 of\nthem were in military hospitals, a high proportion that no one has explained.\nOver the last week, Mr. Gao said, hundreds of officials were dispatched to\nall of Beijing's hospitals to check for possible SARS patients and to\nverify whether they had been reported to the city or national authorities.\nThey came up with totals that well surpassed the rough estimate of a World\nHealth Organization team, which on Wednesday [16 Apr 2003] caused\nconsternation here by declaring that Beijing had undercounted and that the\ntotal might be in the range of 100 to 200. Mr. Gao urged the public to\nunderstand that the sudden multiplication of cases did not imply a sudden\nnew surge in disease, but rather that the official numbers were catching up\nto reality. \"In days to come, more of the `suspect' cases will be\nconfirmed,\" he added. With more complete SARS data only now compiled, Mr.\nGao said, the trend in the epidemic is unclear, and he could not say\nwhether new cases each day are now rising or falling.\n[Byline: Erik Eckholm]\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n******\n[4]\nDate: 20 Apr 2003\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: News briefs [edited]\n[A] Mongolia from VOA news 20 Apr 2003, 11:47 UTC\n<http://www.voanews.com/article.cfm?objectID=13E3640F-F168-41B2-ABB5C590DD5A9905&title=Mongolia%20Adopts%20Tough%20Anti%2DSARS%20Measures&catOID=45C9C78B-88AD-11D4-A57200A0CC5EE46C&categoryname=Asia%20Pacific>\nChina's neighbor, Mongolia, has introduced tough measures to cut the risk\nof infection after 5 people were suspected, but not confirmed, to have the\nvirus.

As of yesterday, 4 staff members, including\nat least one doctor, a nurse, and a respiratory therapist, were in\nhospital. Another 8 hospital staff members were sent into home quarantine\nas potential SARS cases.\nOfficials said they believe the [above] infections occurred during\ndifficult intubations, including one [on 13 Apr 2003] that took 4 hours.\nIntubation involves placing a tube down a patient's throat to facilitate\nbreathing. Some staff started feeling symptoms associated with SARS on [16\nand 17 Apr 2003]. The hospital's head of infection, prevention and\ncontrol, said one worker's eye shield slipped during the Sunday intubation\nprocedure, but there is no other known breach of the staff's \"full-droplet\"\nprotection. That includes gowns, gloves, eye shields, and N-95 masks. \"We\nwere using what both Health Canada and the (Atlanta-based) Centers for\nDisease Control consider to be maximal precautions for these patients,\" she\nsaid, adding \"it's possible some potentially infected staff members were\nnot present at the intubations. We're examining everything we do and we're\nlooking at a number of different options in terms of making that particular\nprocedure safer for the health care workers,\" she said. One option is\nanesthetizing patients for intubation to reduce saliva spread.\nThe hospital's head of microbiology, in a conference call with Health\nCanada and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said a CDC\nexpert surprised the others by revealing that the virus can remain potent\non objects much longer than previously thought. \"....in their studies, they\nfound that you could still culture viable virus from surfaces after as much\nas 24 hours, which is longer than we normally expect viruses to be able to\nsurvive in the environment.\"\n[C] Canada, Ontario from CBC Canada 20 Apr 2003 16:29 EDST\n<http://www.cbc.ca/stories/2003/04/20/sars_train030420>\nA woman thought to be infected with [the virus that causes] severe acute\nrespiratory syndrome was aboard a commuter train travelling west of Toronto\nlast week, public health officials said [today 20 Apr 2003]. She took the\ntrain on 2 separate occasions. Both times she was in a 4-passenger \"pod\"\nwith 3 other people who should watch themselves for symptoms, said the\nmedical officer of health for Halton Region. The woman had symptoms of the\nillness when she took the GO Train on 14 Apr 2003, leaving Union Station at\n4:30 PM, heading to Appleby station in Burlington, said [a] Toronto public\nhealth spokesperson. The next morning, the woman took the train again at\n7:32 AM to go to work as a nurse at Mount Sinai Hospital. She had a fever\nand was \"feeling unwell,\" but was not coughing. The woman was admitted to\nMount Sinai for treatment of SARS later on [15 Apr 2003].\n[D] China, Shanxi, Zhejiang, Jilin and Liaoning from the Times of India 20\nApr 2003 10:18 PM\n<http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/cms.dll/xml/uncomp/articleshow?msid=43993118>\nSARS has spread to 3 more provinces, while 2 more deaths were reported in\nnorth China's Shanxi province, taking the national toll to 81. A total of\n7 new cases of SARS have been reported in 3 Chinese provinces -- 3 in\nZhejiang (east China), 3 in Jilin, and one in Liaoning, both in northeast\nChina, the official Xinhua news agency reported.\nZhejiang's health bureau publicised the details of the diagnostic process\nand the measures taken with regard to the 3 patients. The patients'\nfamilies and others who were exposed to the patients have been placed in\nisolation for monitoring and observation. The SARS experts in Jilin said\nthat they have 3 confirmed [probable] cases and 2 suspected cases.\nMeanwhile, a report from Taiyuan, capital of north China's Shanxi province,\nreported that [as of 19 Apr 2003] 9 people had died of SARS in the province\nand there were 112 registered SARS cases in the province. 11 of these have\nrecovered and been discharged from hospitals.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[Today's update reports an additional 22 cases and 7 deaths reported in the\nprevious 24 hours by Hong Kong. Of these 7 deaths, 4 were in otherwise\nhealthy individuals less than 50 years of age. In Singapore, there has\nbeen one new case reported in the previous 24 hours, but there is concern\nabout potential exposure in a large market area. In response, the Ministry\nof Health has closed the market put all market vendors into home\nquarantine, alerted the public of the possibility of exposure, and\nrecommended they seek medical assistance at the SARS reference center (Tan\nTock Seng Hospital) if symptoms of SARS-like illness appear.\nThe news article on the political repercussions in China as a result of an\nunder-reporting of SARS cases in Beijing is highly significant [4]. It\nappears a clear signal to the international community that China is serious\nabout collaboration with the international community with respect to\ndisease surveillance and control, in this case with respect to SARS, but\nmost quite possibly with respect to disease surveillance and control in\ngeneral for the future. This was an unfortunate situation, possibly\ncontributing to increased transmission if the under-reporting and possible\n\"denial\" of the disease burden was associated with lack of implementation\nof appropriate infection control procedures in the health care setting,\ncombined with a lack of awareness of risk and need to seek early medical\nattention on the part of the general population, thereby having more\npotential contacts contributing to disease transmission. The above article\nat present denies the rumors of actual patient hiding, as was covered in\nthe CNN and Time articles mentioned in an 18 Apr 2003 ProMED-mail posting,\n(SARS - worldwide (57): cases 20030418.0952). Given this occurrence, one\nmight expect to see increases in numbers of cases SARS reported from\nelsewhere in China in the near future as well, if there has been\nintroduction and transmission of the SARS-related coronavirus. It will be\nof interest to see epidemic curves based on dates of onset of illness,\ndemonstrating the true course of the outbreak, as compared with looking at\nnumbers of cases reported each day which will reflect the \"outbreak\" of\nreporting, rather than the outbreak of disease.\nThe news article from Canada [5][B] points out continuing concerns related\nto the difficulties in interruption of transmission that are being seen in\nCanada. In spite of adherence to strict infection control procedures,\naccidents may happen that cause momentary breaks in these infection control\nprocedures, that in turn lead to transmission to the health care workers,\nat least in one of the 4 implicated in the new cluster reported.

Struggling to stop the spread of the disease, officials canceled a\nmajor week-long holiday in May, when tens of millions of people usually go\ntraveling.\nThe demotion of Health Minister Zhang Wenkang and Beijing Mayor Meng\nXuenong came shortly after officials held a 2-hour news conference to\nannounce the sharp increases in SARS cases. Zhang lost his post as\nsecretary of the leading party members' group of the Ministry of Health.\nMeng was removed as the deputy secretary of the party's Beijing Municipal\nCommittee.\nThe government said Sunday the flu-like illness has killed 12 more people\nand that the number of infections in Beijing has soared from 37 to\n346. The new figures raised China's total number of deaths to 79 and its\ncases to 1814, Gao Qiang, an executive vice health minister, said at a news\nconference. \"With such a situation, with more than 300 patients in\nBeijing, the situation is already very serious,\" Gao said. He added there\nwere 402 more suspected cases in the capital.\nGao also made a rare admission that his ministry was not properly prepared\nfor the outbreak. The ministry \"has not given out clear instructions or\neffective guidance,\" he said. But Gao denied reports that SARS cases were\nintentionally hidden from investigators. \"We have not discovered any\nlocality or place that has intentionally hidden these statistics,\" he said.\nIn recent weeks, several nations have urged their citizens to avoid\nunnecessary travel to China. However, the Chinese government continued to\nencourage the public to stick with plans to go on vacations during the\nweek-long May Day holiday, which was to start 1 May 2003. Marking a major\nshift in how China is viewing the SARS danger, Gao said that officials were\ncanceling the vacation period, which has been extended in recent years to\nboost the travel industry and encourage consumer spending. \"The purpose of\nsuch an act is to prevent the massive movement of people and the possible\nspread of the disease,\" Gao said. He acknowledged that the advisory could\ndeal a big blow to China's economy. \"I'm sure this measure will mean\nmassive losses in tourism revenue, but people's lives and health had to be\nput above everything else,\" Gao said.\nSo far, officials have not detected the spread of SARS in large rural\nareas, he said. He noted that farmers have lower incomes and less access to\nmedical care. If the outbreak hit the countryside, \"the consequences would\nbe grim,\" he said.\n[B] China Admits Much Higher Number of SARS Cases\n<http://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/20/international/asia/20CND-CHIN.html>\nWith bureaucratic shuffling and an apologetic, 2-hour news conference, a\nsenior health official, .... admitted to the existence of a large number of\npreviously undisclosed SARS patients in military hospitals and revealed\nwhat he called the first aggressive survey of cases in some 70 scattered\nhospitals. \"Accurate figures have not been reported to high authorities in\na timely manner,\" he added, though he later argued that incompetence rather\nthan deliberate deceit was the main problem. In an unusual move for such\nsensitive and embarrassing news, the news conference was broadcast live on\na national television channel.\nThe unveiling of markedly higher disease figures as well as the firings\n(perhaps the first of many) capped a tense week in which China's efforts to\nplay down SARS, especially in Beijing, were assailed by experts from the\nWorld Health Organization and questioned by medical whistleblowers here and\nby Beijing residents, who through word of mouth began hearing about far\nmore patients than officials had acknowledged.\nToday, Mr. Gao of the Health Ministry repeatedly tried to heap blame on the\nministry's shortcomings, and to the disarray in Beijing where several\npolitical jurisdictions, including municipal, national, military, and\nothers, overlap but have not coordinated disease-control efforts. As of\ntoday, Beijing city health officials will oversee all anti-SARS measures\nthroughout the urban area, including at military hospitals, Mr. Gao\nannounced. Mr. Gao also expressed concern about the spreading reports of\nSARS in several inland provinces, while some outside experts said the case\nreports from some distant provinces seemed too low. A major source of\nerror in previous Beijing reports was the exclusion of patients in several\nmajor hospitals that are run by the military, but which also hold civilian\npatients. The angry public assertion by a retired military surgeon that\nmore than 100 SARS patients were in the military system and being omitted\nfrom public reports was a major blow to the government's credibility and\ntoday, Mr. Gao revealed that the discrepancy was still greater. Of 353 SARS\npatients still in the hospital on Friday [18 Apr 2003], he said, 235 of\nthem were in military hospitals, a high proportion that no one has explained.\nOver the last week, Mr. Gao said, hundreds of officials were dispatched to\nall of Beijing's hospitals to check for possible SARS patients and to\nverify whether they had been reported to the city or national authorities.\nThey came up with totals that well surpassed the rough estimate of a World\nHealth Organization team, which on Wednesday [16 Apr 2003] caused\nconsternation here by declaring that Beijing had undercounted and that the\ntotal might be in the range of 100 to 200. Mr. Gao urged the public to\nunderstand that the sudden multiplication of cases did not imply a sudden\nnew surge in disease, but rather that the official numbers were catching up\nto reality. \"In days to come, more of the `suspect' cases will be\nconfirmed,\" he added. With more complete SARS data only now compiled, Mr.\nGao said, the trend in the epidemic is unclear, and he could not say\nwhether new cases each day are now rising or falling.\n[Byline: Erik Eckholm]\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n******\n[4]\nDate: 20 Apr 2003\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: News briefs [edited]\n[A] Mongolia from VOA news 20 Apr 2003, 11:47 UTC\n<http://www.voanews.com/article.cfm?objectID=13E3640F-F168-41B2-ABB5C590DD5A9905&title=Mongolia%20Adopts%20Tough%20Anti%2DSARS%20Measures&catOID=45C9C78B-88AD-11D4-A57200A0CC5EE46C&categoryname=Asia%20Pacific>\nChina's neighbor, Mongolia, has introduced tough measures to cut the risk\nof infection after 5 people were suspected, but not confirmed, to have the\nvirus. Those being monitored had all visited a hospital in Hohhot, China.\nAlthough they had gone to China for non-SARS related ailments, 4 of the 5\ncame back with a fever.\nDoctor Udval Natsag, second in charge at the Ministry of Health, ....says\nthe Hohhot hospital had several confirmed cases of SARS, and so the\npossibility that the illness has spread north from China's Inner Mongolia\nregion is very real. \"There has been contact with their friends and\nfamily, and Mongolia is a high risk [area], because we have a border with\nInner Mongolia [in China],... many Mongolians travel to Inner Mongolia\nevery day.\" In the capital, Ulaanbaatar, public gatherings have been\nbanned, which has forced the shutdown of theaters and movies houses.

As of yesterday, 4 staff members, including\nat least one doctor, a nurse, and a respiratory therapist, were in\nhospital. Another 8 hospital staff members were sent into home quarantine\nas potential SARS cases.\nOfficials said they believe the [above] infections occurred during\ndifficult intubations, including one [on 13 Apr 2003] that took 4 hours.\nIntubation involves placing a tube down a patient's throat to facilitate\nbreathing. Some staff started feeling symptoms associated with SARS on [16\nand 17 Apr 2003]. The hospital's head of infection, prevention and\ncontrol, said one worker's eye shield slipped during the Sunday intubation\nprocedure, but there is no other known breach of the staff's \"full-droplet\"\nprotection. That includes gowns, gloves, eye shields, and N-95 masks. \"We\nwere using what both Health Canada and the (Atlanta-based) Centers for\nDisease Control consider to be maximal precautions for these patients,\" she\nsaid, adding \"it's possible some potentially infected staff members were\nnot present at the intubations. We're examining everything we do and we're\nlooking at a number of different options in terms of making that particular\nprocedure safer for the health care workers,\" she said. One option is\nanesthetizing patients for intubation to reduce saliva spread.\nThe hospital's head of microbiology, in a conference call with Health\nCanada and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said a CDC\nexpert surprised the others by revealing that the virus can remain potent\non objects much longer than previously thought. \"....in their studies, they\nfound that you could still culture viable virus from surfaces after as much\nas 24 hours, which is longer than we normally expect viruses to be able to\nsurvive in the environment.\"\n[C] Canada, Ontario from CBC Canada 20 Apr 2003 16:29 EDST\n<http://www.cbc.ca/stories/2003/04/20/sars_train030420>\nA woman thought to be infected with [the virus that causes] severe acute\nrespiratory syndrome was aboard a commuter train travelling west of Toronto\nlast week, public health officials said [today 20 Apr 2003]. She took the\ntrain on 2 separate occasions. Both times she was in a 4-passenger \"pod\"\nwith 3 other people who should watch themselves for symptoms, said the\nmedical officer of health for Halton Region. The woman had symptoms of the\nillness when she took the GO Train on 14 Apr 2003, leaving Union Station at\n4:30 PM, heading to Appleby station in Burlington, said [a] Toronto public\nhealth spokesperson. The next morning, the woman took the train again at\n7:32 AM to go to work as a nurse at Mount Sinai Hospital. She had a fever\nand was \"feeling unwell,\" but was not coughing. The woman was admitted to\nMount Sinai for treatment of SARS later on [15 Apr 2003].\n[D] China, Shanxi, Zhejiang, Jilin and Liaoning from the Times of India 20\nApr 2003 10:18 PM\n<http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/cms.dll/xml/uncomp/articleshow?msid=43993118>\nSARS has spread to 3 more provinces, while 2 more deaths were reported in\nnorth China's Shanxi province, taking the national toll to 81. A total of\n7 new cases of SARS have been reported in 3 Chinese provinces -- 3 in\nZhejiang (east China), 3 in Jilin, and one in Liaoning, both in northeast\nChina, the official Xinhua news agency reported.\nZhejiang's health bureau publicised the details of the diagnostic process\nand the measures taken with regard to the 3 patients. The patients'\nfamilies and others who were exposed to the patients have been placed in\nisolation for monitoring and observation. The SARS experts in Jilin said\nthat they have 3 confirmed [probable] cases and 2 suspected cases.\nMeanwhile, a report from Taiyuan, capital of north China's Shanxi province,\nreported that [as of 19 Apr 2003] 9 people had died of SARS in the province\nand there were 112 registered SARS cases in the province. 11 of these have\nrecovered and been discharged from hospitals.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[Today's update reports an additional 22 cases and 7 deaths reported in the\nprevious 24 hours by Hong Kong. Of these 7 deaths, 4 were in otherwise\nhealthy individuals less than 50 years of age. In Singapore, there has\nbeen one new case reported in the previous 24 hours, but there is concern\nabout potential exposure in a large market area. In response, the Ministry\nof Health has closed the market put all market vendors into home\nquarantine, alerted the public of the possibility of exposure, and\nrecommended they seek medical assistance at the SARS reference center (Tan\nTock Seng Hospital) if symptoms of SARS-like illness appear.\nThe news article on the political repercussions in China as a result of an\nunder-reporting of SARS cases in Beijing is highly significant [4]. It\nappears a clear signal to the international community that China is serious\nabout collaboration with the international community with respect to\ndisease surveillance and control, in this case with respect to SARS, but\nmost quite possibly with respect to disease surveillance and control in\ngeneral for the future. This was an unfortunate situation, possibly\ncontributing to increased transmission if the under-reporting and possible\n\"denial\" of the disease burden was associated with lack of implementation\nof appropriate infection control procedures in the health care setting,\ncombined with a lack of awareness of risk and need to seek early medical\nattention on the part of the general population, thereby having more\npotential contacts contributing to disease transmission. The above article\nat present denies the rumors of actual patient hiding, as was covered in\nthe CNN and Time articles mentioned in an 18 Apr 2003 ProMED-mail posting,\n(SARS - worldwide (57): cases 20030418.0952). Given this occurrence, one\nmight expect to see increases in numbers of cases SARS reported from\nelsewhere in China in the near future as well, if there has been\nintroduction and transmission of the SARS-related coronavirus. It will be\nof interest to see epidemic curves based on dates of onset of illness,\ndemonstrating the true course of the outbreak, as compared with looking at\nnumbers of cases reported each day which will reflect the \"outbreak\" of\nreporting, rather than the outbreak of disease.\nThe news article from Canada [5][B] points out continuing concerns related\nto the difficulties in interruption of transmission that are being seen in\nCanada. In spite of adherence to strict infection control procedures,\naccidents may happen that cause momentary breaks in these infection control\nprocedures, that in turn lead to transmission to the health care workers,\nat least in one of the 4 implicated in the new cluster reported.

Struggling to stop the spread of the disease, officials canceled a\nmajor week-long holiday in May, when tens of millions of people usually go\ntraveling.\nThe demotion of Health Minister Zhang Wenkang and Beijing Mayor Meng\nXuenong came shortly after officials held a 2-hour news conference to\nannounce the sharp increases in SARS cases. Zhang lost his post as\nsecretary of the leading party members' group of the Ministry of Health.\nMeng was removed as the deputy secretary of the party's Beijing Municipal\nCommittee.\nThe government said Sunday the flu-like illness has killed 12 more people\nand that the number of infections in Beijing has soared from 37 to\n346. The new figures raised China's total number of deaths to 79 and its\ncases to 1814, Gao Qiang, an executive vice health minister, said at a news\nconference. \"With such a situation, with more than 300 patients in\nBeijing, the situation is already very serious,\" Gao said. He added there\nwere 402 more suspected cases in the capital.\nGao also made a rare admission that his ministry was not properly prepared\nfor the outbreak. The ministry \"has not given out clear instructions or\neffective guidance,\" he said. But Gao denied reports that SARS cases were\nintentionally hidden from investigators. \"We have not discovered any\nlocality or place that has intentionally hidden these statistics,\" he said.\nIn recent weeks, several nations have urged their citizens to avoid\nunnecessary travel to China. However, the Chinese government continued to\nencourage the public to stick with plans to go on vacations during the\nweek-long May Day holiday, which was to start 1 May 2003. Marking a major\nshift in how China is viewing the SARS danger, Gao said that officials were\ncanceling the vacation period, which has been extended in recent years to\nboost the travel industry and encourage consumer spending. \"The purpose of\nsuch an act is to prevent the massive movement of people and the possible\nspread of the disease,\" Gao said. He acknowledged that the advisory could\ndeal a big blow to China's economy. \"I'm sure this measure will mean\nmassive losses in tourism revenue, but people's lives and health had to be\nput above everything else,\" Gao said.\nSo far, officials have not detected the spread of SARS in large rural\nareas, he said. He noted that farmers have lower incomes and less access to\nmedical care. If the outbreak hit the countryside, \"the consequences would\nbe grim,\" he said.\n[B] China Admits Much Higher Number of SARS Cases\n<http://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/20/international/asia/20CND-CHIN.html>\nWith bureaucratic shuffling and an apologetic, 2-hour news conference, a\nsenior health official, .... admitted to the existence of a large number of\npreviously undisclosed SARS patients in military hospitals and revealed\nwhat he called the first aggressive survey of cases in some 70 scattered\nhospitals. \"Accurate figures have not been reported to high authorities in\na timely manner,\" he added, though he later argued that incompetence rather\nthan deliberate deceit was the main problem. In an unusual move for such\nsensitive and embarrassing news, the news conference was broadcast live on\na national television channel.\nThe unveiling of markedly higher disease figures as well as the firings\n(perhaps the first of many) capped a tense week in which China's efforts to\nplay down SARS, especially in Beijing, were assailed by experts from the\nWorld Health Organization and questioned by medical whistleblowers here and\nby Beijing residents, who through word of mouth began hearing about far\nmore patients than officials had acknowledged.\nToday, Mr. Gao of the Health Ministry repeatedly tried to heap blame on the\nministry's shortcomings, and to the disarray in Beijing where several\npolitical jurisdictions, including municipal, national, military, and\nothers, overlap but have not coordinated disease-control efforts. As of\ntoday, Beijing city health officials will oversee all anti-SARS measures\nthroughout the urban area, including at military hospitals, Mr. Gao\nannounced. Mr. Gao also expressed concern about the spreading reports of\nSARS in several inland provinces, while some outside experts said the case\nreports from some distant provinces seemed too low. A major source of\nerror in previous Beijing reports was the exclusion of patients in several\nmajor hospitals that are run by the military, but which also hold civilian\npatients. The angry public assertion by a retired military surgeon that\nmore than 100 SARS patients were in the military system and being omitted\nfrom public reports was a major blow to the government's credibility and\ntoday, Mr. Gao revealed that the discrepancy was still greater. Of 353 SARS\npatients still in the hospital on Friday [18 Apr 2003], he said, 235 of\nthem were in military hospitals, a high proportion that no one has explained.\nOver the last week, Mr. Gao said, hundreds of officials were dispatched to\nall of Beijing's hospitals to check for possible SARS patients and to\nverify whether they had been reported to the city or national authorities.\nThey came up with totals that well surpassed the rough estimate of a World\nHealth Organization team, which on Wednesday [16 Apr 2003] caused\nconsternation here by declaring that Beijing had undercounted and that the\ntotal might be in the range of 100 to 200. Mr. Gao urged the public to\nunderstand that the sudden multiplication of cases did not imply a sudden\nnew surge in disease, but rather that the official numbers were catching up\nto reality. \"In days to come, more of the `suspect' cases will be\nconfirmed,\" he added. With more complete SARS data only now compiled, Mr.\nGao said, the trend in the epidemic is unclear, and he could not say\nwhether new cases each day are now rising or falling.\n[Byline: Erik Eckholm]\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n******\n[4]\nDate: 20 Apr 2003\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: News briefs [edited]\n[A] Mongolia from VOA news 20 Apr 2003, 11:47 UTC\n<http://www.voanews.com/article.cfm?objectID=13E3640F-F168-41B2-ABB5C590DD5A9905&title=Mongolia%20Adopts%20Tough%20Anti%2DSARS%20Measures&catOID=45C9C78B-88AD-11D4-A57200A0CC5EE46C&categoryname=Asia%20Pacific>\nChina's neighbor, Mongolia, has introduced tough measures to cut the risk\nof infection after 5 people were suspected, but not confirmed, to have the\nvirus. Those being monitored had all visited a hospital in Hohhot, China.\nAlthough they had gone to China for non-SARS related ailments, 4 of the 5\ncame back with a fever.\nDoctor Udval Natsag, second in charge at the Ministry of Health, ....says\nthe Hohhot hospital had several confirmed cases of SARS, and so the\npossibility that the illness has spread north from China's Inner Mongolia\nregion is very real. \"There has been contact with their friends and\nfamily, and Mongolia is a high risk [area], because we have a border with\nInner Mongolia [in China],... many Mongolians travel to Inner Mongolia\nevery day.\" In the capital, Ulaanbaatar, public gatherings have been\nbanned, which has forced the shutdown of theaters and movies houses.

As of yesterday, 4 staff members, including\nat least one doctor, a nurse, and a respiratory therapist, were in\nhospital. Another 8 hospital staff members were sent into home quarantine\nas potential SARS cases.\nOfficials said they believe the [above] infections occurred during\ndifficult intubations, including one [on 13 Apr 2003] that took 4 hours.\nIntubation involves placing a tube down a patient's throat to facilitate\nbreathing. Some staff started feeling symptoms associated with SARS on [16\nand 17 Apr 2003]. The hospital's head of infection, prevention and\ncontrol, said one worker's eye shield slipped during the Sunday intubation\nprocedure, but there is no other known breach of the staff's \"full-droplet\"\nprotection. That includes gowns, gloves, eye shields, and N-95 masks. \"We\nwere using what both Health Canada and the (Atlanta-based) Centers for\nDisease Control consider to be maximal precautions for these patients,\" she\nsaid, adding \"it's possible some potentially infected staff members were\nnot present at the intubations. We're examining everything we do and we're\nlooking at a number of different options in terms of making that particular\nprocedure safer for the health care workers,\" she said. One option is\nanesthetizing patients for intubation to reduce saliva spread.\nThe hospital's head of microbiology, in a conference call with Health\nCanada and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said a CDC\nexpert surprised the others by revealing that the virus can remain potent\non objects much longer than previously thought. \"....in their studies, they\nfound that you could still culture viable virus from surfaces after as much\nas 24 hours, which is longer than we normally expect viruses to be able to\nsurvive in the environment.\"\n[C] Canada, Ontario from CBC Canada 20 Apr 2003 16:29 EDST\n<http://www.cbc.ca/stories/2003/04/20/sars_train030420>\nA woman thought to be infected with [the virus that causes] severe acute\nrespiratory syndrome was aboard a commuter train travelling west of Toronto\nlast week, public health officials said [today 20 Apr 2003]. She took the\ntrain on 2 separate occasions. Both times she was in a 4-passenger \"pod\"\nwith 3 other people who should watch themselves for symptoms, said the\nmedical officer of health for Halton Region. The woman had symptoms of the\nillness when she took the GO Train on 14 Apr 2003, leaving Union Station at\n4:30 PM, heading to Appleby station in Burlington, said [a] Toronto public\nhealth spokesperson. The next morning, the woman took the train again at\n7:32 AM to go to work as a nurse at Mount Sinai Hospital. She had a fever\nand was \"feeling unwell,\" but was not coughing. The woman was admitted to\nMount Sinai for treatment of SARS later on [15 Apr 2003].\n[D] China, Shanxi, Zhejiang, Jilin and Liaoning from the Times of India 20\nApr 2003 10:18 PM\n<http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/cms.dll/xml/uncomp/articleshow?msid=43993118>\nSARS has spread to 3 more provinces, while 2 more deaths were reported in\nnorth China's Shanxi province, taking the national toll to 81. A total of\n7 new cases of SARS have been reported in 3 Chinese provinces -- 3 in\nZhejiang (east China), 3 in Jilin, and one in Liaoning, both in northeast\nChina, the official Xinhua news agency reported.\nZhejiang's health bureau publicised the details of the diagnostic process\nand the measures taken with regard to the 3 patients. The patients'\nfamilies and others who were exposed to the patients have been placed in\nisolation for monitoring and observation. The SARS experts in Jilin said\nthat they have 3 confirmed [probable] cases and 2 suspected cases.\nMeanwhile, a report from Taiyuan, capital of north China's Shanxi province,\nreported that [as of 19 Apr 2003] 9 people had died of SARS in the province\nand there were 112 registered SARS cases in the province. 11 of these have\nrecovered and been discharged from hospitals.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[Today's update reports an additional 22 cases and 7 deaths reported in the\nprevious 24 hours by Hong Kong. Of these 7 deaths, 4 were in otherwise\nhealthy individuals less than 50 years of age. In Singapore, there has\nbeen one new case reported in the previous 24 hours, but there is concern\nabout potential exposure in a large market area. In response, the Ministry\nof Health has closed the market put all market vendors into home\nquarantine, alerted the public of the possibility of exposure, and\nrecommended they seek medical assistance at the SARS reference center (Tan\nTock Seng Hospital) if symptoms of SARS-like illness appear.\nThe news article on the political repercussions in China as a result of an\nunder-reporting of SARS cases in Beijing is highly significant [4]. It\nappears a clear signal to the international community that China is serious\nabout collaboration with the international community with respect to\ndisease surveillance and control, in this case with respect to SARS, but\nmost quite possibly with respect to disease surveillance and control in\ngeneral for the future. This was an unfortunate situation, possibly\ncontributing to increased transmission if the under-reporting and possible\n\"denial\" of the disease burden was associated with lack of implementation\nof appropriate infection control procedures in the health care setting,\ncombined with a lack of awareness of risk and need to seek early medical\nattention on the part of the general population, thereby having more\npotential contacts contributing to disease transmission. The above article\nat present denies the rumors of actual patient hiding, as was covered in\nthe CNN and Time articles mentioned in an 18 Apr 2003 ProMED-mail posting,\n(SARS - worldwide (57): cases 20030418.0952). Given this occurrence, one\nmight expect to see increases in numbers of cases SARS reported from\nelsewhere in China in the near future as well, if there has been\nintroduction and transmission of the SARS-related coronavirus. It will be\nof interest to see epidemic curves based on dates of onset of illness,\ndemonstrating the true course of the outbreak, as compared with looking at\nnumbers of cases reported each day which will reflect the \"outbreak\" of\nreporting, rather than the outbreak of disease.\nThe news article from Canada [5][B] points out continuing concerns related\nto the difficulties in interruption of transmission that are being seen in\nCanada. In spite of adherence to strict infection control procedures,\naccidents may happen that cause momentary breaks in these infection control\nprocedures, that in turn lead to transmission to the health care workers,\nat least in one of the 4 implicated in the new cluster reported.

Struggling to stop the spread of the disease, officials canceled a\nmajor week-long holiday in May, when tens of millions of people usually go\ntraveling.\nThe demotion of Health Minister Zhang Wenkang and Beijing Mayor Meng\nXuenong came shortly after officials held a 2-hour news conference to\nannounce the sharp increases in SARS cases. Zhang lost his post as\nsecretary of the leading party members' group of the Ministry of Health.\nMeng was removed as the deputy secretary of the party's Beijing Municipal\nCommittee.\nThe government said Sunday the flu-like illness has killed 12 more people\nand that the number of infections in Beijing has soared from 37 to\n346. The new figures raised China's total number of deaths to 79 and its\ncases to 1814, Gao Qiang, an executive vice health minister, said at a news\nconference. \"With such a situation, with more than 300 patients in\nBeijing, the situation is already very serious,\" Gao said. He added there\nwere 402 more suspected cases in the capital.\nGao also made a rare admission that his ministry was not properly prepared\nfor the outbreak. The ministry \"has not given out clear instructions or\neffective guidance,\" he said. But Gao denied reports that SARS cases were\nintentionally hidden from investigators. \"We have not discovered any\nlocality or place that has intentionally hidden these statistics,\" he said.\nIn recent weeks, several nations have urged their citizens to avoid\nunnecessary travel to China. However, the Chinese government continued to\nencourage the public to stick with plans to go on vacations during the\nweek-long May Day holiday, which was to start 1 May 2003. Marking a major\nshift in how China is viewing the SARS danger, Gao said that officials were\ncanceling the vacation period, which has been extended in recent years to\nboost the travel industry and encourage consumer spending. \"The purpose of\nsuch an act is to prevent the massive movement of people and the possible\nspread of the disease,\" Gao said. He acknowledged that the advisory could\ndeal a big blow to China's economy. \"I'm sure this measure will mean\nmassive losses in tourism revenue, but people's lives and health had to be\nput above everything else,\" Gao said.\nSo far, officials have not detected the spread of SARS in large rural\nareas, he said. He noted that farmers have lower incomes and less access to\nmedical care. If the outbreak hit the countryside, \"the consequences would\nbe grim,\" he said.\n[B] China Admits Much Higher Number of SARS Cases\n<http://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/20/international/asia/20CND-CHIN.html>\nWith bureaucratic shuffling and an apologetic, 2-hour news conference, a\nsenior health official, .... admitted to the existence of a large number of\npreviously undisclosed SARS patients in military hospitals and revealed\nwhat he called the first aggressive survey of cases in some 70 scattered\nhospitals. \"Accurate figures have not been reported to high authorities in\na timely manner,\" he added, though he later argued that incompetence rather\nthan deliberate deceit was the main problem. In an unusual move for such\nsensitive and embarrassing news, the news conference was broadcast live on\na national television channel.\nThe unveiling of markedly higher disease figures as well as the firings\n(perhaps the first of many) capped a tense week in which China's efforts to\nplay down SARS, especially in Beijing, were assailed by experts from the\nWorld Health Organization and questioned by medical whistleblowers here and\nby Beijing residents, who through word of mouth began hearing about far\nmore patients than officials had acknowledged.\nToday, Mr. Gao of the Health Ministry repeatedly tried to heap blame on the\nministry's shortcomings, and to the disarray in Beijing where several\npolitical jurisdictions, including municipal, national, military, and\nothers, overlap but have not coordinated disease-control efforts. As of\ntoday, Beijing city health officials will oversee all anti-SARS measures\nthroughout the urban area, including at military hospitals, Mr. Gao\nannounced. Mr. Gao also expressed concern about the spreading reports of\nSARS in several inland provinces, while some outside experts said the case\nreports from some distant provinces seemed too low. A major source of\nerror in previous Beijing reports was the exclusion of patients in several\nmajor hospitals that are run by the military, but which also hold civilian\npatients. The angry public assertion by a retired military surgeon that\nmore than 100 SARS patients were in the military system and being omitted\nfrom public reports was a major blow to the government's credibility and\ntoday, Mr. Gao revealed that the discrepancy was still greater. Of 353 SARS\npatients still in the hospital on Friday [18 Apr 2003], he said, 235 of\nthem were in military hospitals, a high proportion that no one has explained.\nOver the last week, Mr. Gao said, hundreds of officials were dispatched to\nall of Beijing's hospitals to check for possible SARS patients and to\nverify whether they had been reported to the city or national authorities.\nThey came up with totals that well surpassed the rough estimate of a World\nHealth Organization team, which on Wednesday [16 Apr 2003] caused\nconsternation here by declaring that Beijing had undercounted and that the\ntotal might be in the range of 100 to 200. Mr. Gao urged the public to\nunderstand that the sudden multiplication of cases did not imply a sudden\nnew surge in disease, but rather that the official numbers were catching up\nto reality. \"In days to come, more of the `suspect' cases will be\nconfirmed,\" he added. With more complete SARS data only now compiled, Mr.\nGao said, the trend in the epidemic is unclear, and he could not say\nwhether new cases each day are now rising or falling.\n[Byline: Erik Eckholm]\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n******\n[4]\nDate: 20 Apr 2003\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: News briefs [edited]\n[A] Mongolia from VOA news 20 Apr 2003, 11:47 UTC\n<http://www.voanews.com/article.cfm?objectID=13E3640F-F168-41B2-ABB5C590DD5A9905&title=Mongolia%20Adopts%20Tough%20Anti%2DSARS%20Measures&catOID=45C9C78B-88AD-11D4-A57200A0CC5EE46C&categoryname=Asia%20Pacific>\nChina's neighbor, Mongolia, has introduced tough measures to cut the risk\nof infection after 5 people were suspected, but not confirmed, to have the\nvirus. Those being monitored had all visited a hospital in Hohhot, China.\nAlthough they had gone to China for non-SARS related ailments, 4 of the 5\ncame back with a fever.\nDoctor Udval Natsag, second in charge at the Ministry of Health, ....says\nthe Hohhot hospital had several confirmed cases of SARS, and so the\npossibility that the illness has spread north from China's Inner Mongolia\nregion is very real. \"There has been contact with their friends and\nfamily, and Mongolia is a high risk [area], because we have a border with\nInner Mongolia [in China],... many Mongolians travel to Inner Mongolia\nevery day.\" In the capital, Ulaanbaatar, public gatherings have been\nbanned, which has forced the shutdown of theaters and movies houses.

As of yesterday, 4 staff members, including\nat least one doctor, a nurse, and a respiratory therapist, were in\nhospital. Another 8 hospital staff members were sent into home quarantine\nas potential SARS cases.\nOfficials said they believe the [above] infections occurred during\ndifficult intubations, including one [on 13 Apr 2003] that took 4 hours.\nIntubation involves placing a tube down a patient's throat to facilitate\nbreathing. Some staff started feeling symptoms associated with SARS on [16\nand 17 Apr 2003]. The hospital's head of infection, prevention and\ncontrol, said one worker's eye shield slipped during the Sunday intubation\nprocedure, but there is no other known breach of the staff's \"full-droplet\"\nprotection. That includes gowns, gloves, eye shields, and N-95 masks. \"We\nwere using what both Health Canada and the (Atlanta-based) Centers for\nDisease Control consider to be maximal precautions for these patients,\" she\nsaid, adding \"it's possible some potentially infected staff members were\nnot present at the intubations. We're examining everything we do and we're\nlooking at a number of different options in terms of making that particular\nprocedure safer for the health care workers,\" she said. One option is\nanesthetizing patients for intubation to reduce saliva spread.\nThe hospital's head of microbiology, in a conference call with Health\nCanada and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said a CDC\nexpert surprised the others by revealing that the virus can remain potent\non objects much longer than previously thought. \"....in their studies, they\nfound that you could still culture viable virus from surfaces after as much\nas 24 hours, which is longer than we normally expect viruses to be able to\nsurvive in the environment.\"\n[C] Canada, Ontario from CBC Canada 20 Apr 2003 16:29 EDST\n<http://www.cbc.ca/stories/2003/04/20/sars_train030420>\nA woman thought to be infected with [the virus that causes] severe acute\nrespiratory syndrome was aboard a commuter train travelling west of Toronto\nlast week, public health officials said [today 20 Apr 2003]. She took the\ntrain on 2 separate occasions. Both times she was in a 4-passenger \"pod\"\nwith 3 other people who should watch themselves for symptoms, said the\nmedical officer of health for Halton Region. The woman had symptoms of the\nillness when she took the GO Train on 14 Apr 2003, leaving Union Station at\n4:30 PM, heading to Appleby station in Burlington, said [a] Toronto public\nhealth spokesperson. The next morning, the woman took the train again at\n7:32 AM to go to work as a nurse at Mount Sinai Hospital. She had a fever\nand was \"feeling unwell,\" but was not coughing. The woman was admitted to\nMount Sinai for treatment of SARS later on [15 Apr 2003].\n[D] China, Shanxi, Zhejiang, Jilin and Liaoning from the Times of India 20\nApr 2003 10:18 PM\n<http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/cms.dll/xml/uncomp/articleshow?msid=43993118>\nSARS has spread to 3 more provinces, while 2 more deaths were reported in\nnorth China's Shanxi province, taking the national toll to 81. A total of\n7 new cases of SARS have been reported in 3 Chinese provinces -- 3 in\nZhejiang (east China), 3 in Jilin, and one in Liaoning, both in northeast\nChina, the official Xinhua news agency reported.\nZhejiang's health bureau publicised the details of the diagnostic process\nand the measures taken with regard to the 3 patients. The patients'\nfamilies and others who were exposed to the patients have been placed in\nisolation for monitoring and observation. The SARS experts in Jilin said\nthat they have 3 confirmed [probable] cases and 2 suspected cases.\nMeanwhile, a report from Taiyuan, capital of north China's Shanxi province,\nreported that [as of 19 Apr 2003] 9 people had died of SARS in the province\nand there were 112 registered SARS cases in the province. 11 of these have\nrecovered and been discharged from hospitals.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[Today's update reports an additional 22 cases and 7 deaths reported in the\nprevious 24 hours by Hong Kong. Of these 7 deaths, 4 were in otherwise\nhealthy individuals less than 50 years of age. In Singapore, there has\nbeen one new case reported in the previous 24 hours, but there is concern\nabout potential exposure in a large market area. In response, the Ministry\nof Health has closed the market put all market vendors into home\nquarantine, alerted the public of the possibility of exposure, and\nrecommended they seek medical assistance at the SARS reference center (Tan\nTock Seng Hospital) if symptoms of SARS-like illness appear.\nThe news article on the political repercussions in China as a result of an\nunder-reporting of SARS cases in Beijing is highly significant [4]. It\nappears a clear signal to the international community that China is serious\nabout collaboration with the international community with respect to\ndisease surveillance and control, in this case with respect to SARS, but\nmost quite possibly with respect to disease surveillance and control in\ngeneral for the future. This was an unfortunate situation, possibly\ncontributing to increased transmission if the under-reporting and possible\n\"denial\" of the disease burden was associated with lack of implementation\nof appropriate infection control procedures in the health care setting,\ncombined with a lack of awareness of risk and need to seek early medical\nattention on the part of the general population, thereby having more\npotential contacts contributing to disease transmission. The above article\nat present denies the rumors of actual patient hiding, as was covered in\nthe CNN and Time articles mentioned in an 18 Apr 2003 ProMED-mail posting,\n(SARS - worldwide (57): cases 20030418.0952). Given this occurrence, one\nmight expect to see increases in numbers of cases SARS reported from\nelsewhere in China in the near future as well, if there has been\nintroduction and transmission of the SARS-related coronavirus. It will be\nof interest to see epidemic curves based on dates of onset of illness,\ndemonstrating the true course of the outbreak, as compared with looking at\nnumbers of cases reported each day which will reflect the \"outbreak\" of\nreporting, rather than the outbreak of disease.\nThe news article from Canada [5][B] points out continuing concerns related\nto the difficulties in interruption of transmission that are being seen in\nCanada. In spite of adherence to strict infection control procedures,\naccidents may happen that cause momentary breaks in these infection control\nprocedures, that in turn lead to transmission to the health care workers,\nat least in one of the 4 implicated in the new cluster reported.

Struggling to stop the spread of the disease, officials canceled a\nmajor week-long holiday in May, when tens of millions of people usually go\ntraveling.\nThe demotion of Health Minister Zhang Wenkang and Beijing Mayor Meng\nXuenong came shortly after officials held a 2-hour news conference to\nannounce the sharp increases in SARS cases. Zhang lost his post as\nsecretary of the leading party members' group of the Ministry of Health.\nMeng was removed as the deputy secretary of the party's Beijing Municipal\nCommittee.\nThe government said Sunday the flu-like illness has killed 12 more people\nand that the number of infections in Beijing has soared from 37 to\n346. The new figures raised China's total number of deaths to 79 and its\ncases to 1814, Gao Qiang, an executive vice health minister, said at a news\nconference. \"With such a situation, with more than 300 patients in\nBeijing, the situation is already very serious,\" Gao said. He added there\nwere 402 more suspected cases in the capital.\nGao also made a rare admission that his ministry was not properly prepared\nfor the outbreak. The ministry \"has not given out clear instructions or\neffective guidance,\" he said. But Gao denied reports that SARS cases were\nintentionally hidden from investigators. \"We have not discovered any\nlocality or place that has intentionally hidden these statistics,\" he said.\nIn recent weeks, several nations have urged their citizens to avoid\nunnecessary travel to China. However, the Chinese government continued to\nencourage the public to stick with plans to go on vacations during the\nweek-long May Day holiday, which was to start 1 May 2003. Marking a major\nshift in how China is viewing the SARS danger, Gao said that officials were\ncanceling the vacation period, which has been extended in recent years to\nboost the travel industry and encourage consumer spending. \"The purpose of\nsuch an act is to prevent the massive movement of people and the possible\nspread of the disease,\" Gao said. He acknowledged that the advisory could\ndeal a big blow to China's economy. \"I'm sure this measure will mean\nmassive losses in tourism revenue, but people's lives and health had to be\nput above everything else,\" Gao said.\nSo far, officials have not detected the spread of SARS in large rural\nareas, he said. He noted that farmers have lower incomes and less access to\nmedical care. If the outbreak hit the countryside, \"the consequences would\nbe grim,\" he said.\n[B] China Admits Much Higher Number of SARS Cases\n<http://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/20/international/asia/20CND-CHIN.html>\nWith bureaucratic shuffling and an apologetic, 2-hour news conference, a\nsenior health official, .... admitted to the existence of a large number of\npreviously undisclosed SARS patients in military hospitals and revealed\nwhat he called the first aggressive survey of cases in some 70 scattered\nhospitals. \"Accurate figures have not been reported to high authorities in\na timely manner,\" he added, though he later argued that incompetence rather\nthan deliberate deceit was the main problem. In an unusual move for such\nsensitive and embarrassing news, the news conference was broadcast live on\na national television channel.\nThe unveiling of markedly higher disease figures as well as the firings\n(perhaps the first of many) capped a tense week in which China's efforts to\nplay down SARS, especially in Beijing, were assailed by experts from the\nWorld Health Organization and questioned by medical whistleblowers here and\nby Beijing residents, who through word of mouth began hearing about far\nmore patients than officials had acknowledged.\nToday, Mr. Gao of the Health Ministry repeatedly tried to heap blame on the\nministry's shortcomings, and to the disarray in Beijing where several\npolitical jurisdictions, including municipal, national, military, and\nothers, overlap but have not coordinated disease-control efforts. As of\ntoday, Beijing city health officials will oversee all anti-SARS measures\nthroughout the urban area, including at military hospitals, Mr. Gao\nannounced. Mr. Gao also expressed concern about the spreading reports of\nSARS in several inland provinces, while some outside experts said the case\nreports from some distant provinces seemed too low. A major source of\nerror in previous Beijing reports was the exclusion of patients in several\nmajor hospitals that are run by the military, but which also hold civilian\npatients. The angry public assertion by a retired military surgeon that\nmore than 100 SARS patients were in the military system and being omitted\nfrom public reports was a major blow to the government's credibility and\ntoday, Mr. Gao revealed that the discrepancy was still greater. Of 353 SARS\npatients still in the hospital on Friday [18 Apr 2003], he said, 235 of\nthem were in military hospitals, a high proportion that no one has explained.\nOver the last week, Mr. Gao said, hundreds of officials were dispatched to\nall of Beijing's hospitals to check for possible SARS patients and to\nverify whether they had been reported to the city or national authorities.\nThey came up with totals that well surpassed the rough estimate of a World\nHealth Organization team, which on Wednesday [16 Apr 2003] caused\nconsternation here by declaring that Beijing had undercounted and that the\ntotal might be in the range of 100 to 200. Mr. Gao urged the public to\nunderstand that the sudden multiplication of cases did not imply a sudden\nnew surge in disease, but rather that the official numbers were catching up\nto reality. \"In days to come, more of the `suspect' cases will be\nconfirmed,\" he added. With more complete SARS data only now compiled, Mr.\nGao said, the trend in the epidemic is unclear, and he could not say\nwhether new cases each day are now rising or falling.\n[Byline: Erik Eckholm]\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n******\n[4]\nDate: 20 Apr 2003\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: News briefs [edited]\n[A] Mongolia from VOA news 20 Apr 2003, 11:47 UTC\n<http://www.voanews.com/article.cfm?objectID=13E3640F-F168-41B2-ABB5C590DD5A9905&title=Mongolia%20Adopts%20Tough%20Anti%2DSARS%20Measures&catOID=45C9C78B-88AD-11D4-A57200A0CC5EE46C&categoryname=Asia%20Pacific>\nChina's neighbor, Mongolia, has introduced tough measures to cut the risk\nof infection after 5 people were suspected, but not confirmed, to have the\nvirus. Those being monitored had all visited a hospital in Hohhot, China.\nAlthough they had gone to China for non-SARS related ailments, 4 of the 5\ncame back with a fever.\nDoctor Udval Natsag, second in charge at the Ministry of Health, ....says\nthe Hohhot hospital had several confirmed cases of SARS, and so the\npossibility that the illness has spread north from China's Inner Mongolia\nregion is very real. \"There has been contact with their friends and\nfamily, and Mongolia is a high risk [area], because we have a border with\nInner Mongolia [in China],... many Mongolians travel to Inner Mongolia\nevery day.\" In the capital, Ulaanbaatar, public gatherings have been\nbanned, which has forced the shutdown of theaters and movies houses.

As of yesterday, 4 staff members, including\nat least one doctor, a nurse, and a respiratory therapist, were in\nhospital. Another 8 hospital staff members were sent into home quarantine\nas potential SARS cases.\nOfficials said they believe the [above] infections occurred during\ndifficult intubations, including one [on 13 Apr 2003] that took 4 hours.\nIntubation involves placing a tube down a patient's throat to facilitate\nbreathing. Some staff started feeling symptoms associated with SARS on [16\nand 17 Apr 2003]. The hospital's head of infection, prevention and\ncontrol, said one worker's eye shield slipped during the Sunday intubation\nprocedure, but there is no other known breach of the staff's \"full-droplet\"\nprotection. That includes gowns, gloves, eye shields, and N-95 masks. \"We\nwere using what both Health Canada and the (Atlanta-based) Centers for\nDisease Control consider to be maximal precautions for these patients,\" she\nsaid, adding \"it's possible some potentially infected staff members were\nnot present at the intubations. We're examining everything we do and we're\nlooking at a number of different options in terms of making that particular\nprocedure safer for the health care workers,\" she said. One option is\nanesthetizing patients for intubation to reduce saliva spread.\nThe hospital's head of microbiology, in a conference call with Health\nCanada and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said a CDC\nexpert surprised the others by revealing that the virus can remain potent\non objects much longer than previously thought. \"....in their studies, they\nfound that you could still culture viable virus from surfaces after as much\nas 24 hours, which is longer than we normally expect viruses to be able to\nsurvive in the environment.\"\n[C] Canada, Ontario from CBC Canada 20 Apr 2003 16:29 EDST\n<http://www.cbc.ca/stories/2003/04/20/sars_train030420>\nA woman thought to be infected with [the virus that causes] severe acute\nrespiratory syndrome was aboard a commuter train travelling west of Toronto\nlast week, public health officials said [today 20 Apr 2003]. She took the\ntrain on 2 separate occasions. Both times she was in a 4-passenger \"pod\"\nwith 3 other people who should watch themselves for symptoms, said the\nmedical officer of health for Halton Region. The woman had symptoms of the\nillness when she took the GO Train on 14 Apr 2003, leaving Union Station at\n4:30 PM, heading to Appleby station in Burlington, said [a] Toronto public\nhealth spokesperson. The next morning, the woman took the train again at\n7:32 AM to go to work as a nurse at Mount Sinai Hospital. She had a fever\nand was \"feeling unwell,\" but was not coughing. The woman was admitted to\nMount Sinai for treatment of SARS later on [15 Apr 2003].\n[D] China, Shanxi, Zhejiang, Jilin and Liaoning from the Times of India 20\nApr 2003 10:18 PM\n<http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/cms.dll/xml/uncomp/articleshow?msid=43993118>\nSARS has spread to 3 more provinces, while 2 more deaths were reported in\nnorth China's Shanxi province, taking the national toll to 81. A total of\n7 new cases of SARS have been reported in 3 Chinese provinces -- 3 in\nZhejiang (east China), 3 in Jilin, and one in Liaoning, both in northeast\nChina, the official Xinhua news agency reported.\nZhejiang's health bureau publicised the details of the diagnostic process\nand the measures taken with regard to the 3 patients. The patients'\nfamilies and others who were exposed to the patients have been placed in\nisolation for monitoring and observation. The SARS experts in Jilin said\nthat they have 3 confirmed [probable] cases and 2 suspected cases.\nMeanwhile, a report from Taiyuan, capital of north China's Shanxi province,\nreported that [as of 19 Apr 2003] 9 people had died of SARS in the province\nand there were 112 registered SARS cases in the province. 11 of these have\nrecovered and been discharged from hospitals.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[Today's update reports an additional 22 cases and 7 deaths reported in the\nprevious 24 hours by Hong Kong. Of these 7 deaths, 4 were in otherwise\nhealthy individuals less than 50 years of age. In Singapore, there has\nbeen one new case reported in the previous 24 hours, but there is concern\nabout potential exposure in a large market area. In response, the Ministry\nof Health has closed the market put all market vendors into home\nquarantine, alerted the public of the possibility of exposure, and\nrecommended they seek medical assistance at the SARS reference center (Tan\nTock Seng Hospital) if symptoms of SARS-like illness appear.\nThe news article on the political repercussions in China as a result of an\nunder-reporting of SARS cases in Beijing is highly significant [4]. It\nappears a clear signal to the international community that China is serious\nabout collaboration with the international community with respect to\ndisease surveillance and control, in this case with respect to SARS, but\nmost quite possibly with respect to disease surveillance and control in\ngeneral for the future. This was an unfortunate situation, possibly\ncontributing to increased transmission if the under-reporting and possible\n\"denial\" of the disease burden was associated with lack of implementation\nof appropriate infection control procedures in the health care setting,\ncombined with a lack of awareness of risk and need to seek early medical\nattention on the part of the general population, thereby having more\npotential contacts contributing to disease transmission. The above article\nat present denies the rumors of actual patient hiding, as was covered in\nthe CNN and Time articles mentioned in an 18 Apr 2003 ProMED-mail posting,\n(SARS - worldwide (57): cases 20030418.0952). Given this occurrence, one\nmight expect to see increases in numbers of cases SARS reported from\nelsewhere in China in the near future as well, if there has been\nintroduction and transmission of the SARS-related coronavirus. It will be\nof interest to see epidemic curves based on dates of onset of illness,\ndemonstrating the true course of the outbreak, as compared with looking at\nnumbers of cases reported each day which will reflect the \"outbreak\" of\nreporting, rather than the outbreak of disease.\nThe news article from Canada [5][B] points out continuing concerns related\nto the difficulties in interruption of transmission that are being seen in\nCanada. In spite of adherence to strict infection control procedures,\naccidents may happen that cause momentary breaks in these infection control\nprocedures, that in turn lead to transmission to the health care workers,\nat least in one of the 4 implicated in the new cluster reported.

Struggling to stop the spread of the disease, officials canceled a\nmajor week-long holiday in May, when tens of millions of people usually go\ntraveling.\nThe demotion of Health Minister Zhang Wenkang and Beijing Mayor Meng\nXuenong came shortly after officials held a 2-hour news conference to\nannounce the sharp increases in SARS cases. Zhang lost his post as\nsecretary of the leading party members' group of the Ministry of Health.\nMeng was removed as the deputy secretary of the party's Beijing Municipal\nCommittee.\nThe government said Sunday the flu-like illness has killed 12 more people\nand that the number of infections in Beijing has soared from 37 to\n346. The new figures raised China's total number of deaths to 79 and its\ncases to 1814, Gao Qiang, an executive vice health minister, said at a news\nconference. \"With such a situation, with more than 300 patients in\nBeijing, the situation is already very serious,\" Gao said. He added there\nwere 402 more suspected cases in the capital.\nGao also made a rare admission that his ministry was not properly prepared\nfor the outbreak. The ministry \"has not given out clear instructions or\neffective guidance,\" he said. But Gao denied reports that SARS cases were\nintentionally hidden from investigators. \"We have not discovered any\nlocality or place that has intentionally hidden these statistics,\" he said.\nIn recent weeks, several nations have urged their citizens to avoid\nunnecessary travel to China. However, the Chinese government continued to\nencourage the public to stick with plans to go on vacations during the\nweek-long May Day holiday, which was to start 1 May 2003. Marking a major\nshift in how China is viewing the SARS danger, Gao said that officials were\ncanceling the vacation period, which has been extended in recent years to\nboost the travel industry and encourage consumer spending. \"The purpose of\nsuch an act is to prevent the massive movement of people and the possible\nspread of the disease,\" Gao said. He acknowledged that the advisory could\ndeal a big blow to China's economy. \"I'm sure this measure will mean\nmassive losses in tourism revenue, but people's lives and health had to be\nput above everything else,\" Gao said.\nSo far, officials have not detected the spread of SARS in large rural\nareas, he said. He noted that farmers have lower incomes and less access to\nmedical care. If the outbreak hit the countryside, \"the consequences would\nbe grim,\" he said.\n[B] China Admits Much Higher Number of SARS Cases\n<http://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/20/international/asia/20CND-CHIN.html>\nWith bureaucratic shuffling and an apologetic, 2-hour news conference, a\nsenior health official, .... admitted to the existence of a large number of\npreviously undisclosed SARS patients in military hospitals and revealed\nwhat he called the first aggressive survey of cases in some 70 scattered\nhospitals. \"Accurate figures have not been reported to high authorities in\na timely manner,\" he added, though he later argued that incompetence rather\nthan deliberate deceit was the main problem. In an unusual move for such\nsensitive and embarrassing news, the news conference was broadcast live on\na national television channel.\nThe unveiling of markedly higher disease figures as well as the firings\n(perhaps the first of many) capped a tense week in which China's efforts to\nplay down SARS, especially in Beijing, were assailed by experts from the\nWorld Health Organization and questioned by medical whistleblowers here and\nby Beijing residents, who through word of mouth began hearing about far\nmore patients than officials had acknowledged.\nToday, Mr. Gao of the Health Ministry repeatedly tried to heap blame on the\nministry's shortcomings, and to the disarray in Beijing where several\npolitical jurisdictions, including municipal, national, military, and\nothers, overlap but have not coordinated disease-control efforts. As of\ntoday, Beijing city health officials will oversee all anti-SARS measures\nthroughout the urban area, including at military hospitals, Mr. Gao\nannounced. Mr. Gao also expressed concern about the spreading reports of\nSARS in several inland provinces, while some outside experts said the case\nreports from some distant provinces seemed too low. A major source of\nerror in previous Beijing reports was the exclusion of patients in several\nmajor hospitals that are run by the military, but which also hold civilian\npatients. The angry public assertion by a retired military surgeon that\nmore than 100 SARS patients were in the military system and being omitted\nfrom public reports was a major blow to the government's credibility and\ntoday, Mr. Gao revealed that the discrepancy was still greater. Of 353 SARS\npatients still in the hospital on Friday [18 Apr 2003], he said, 235 of\nthem were in military hospitals, a high proportion that no one has explained.\nOver the last week, Mr. Gao said, hundreds of officials were dispatched to\nall of Beijing's hospitals to check for possible SARS patients and to\nverify whether they had been reported to the city or national authorities.\nThey came up with totals that well surpassed the rough estimate of a World\nHealth Organization team, which on Wednesday [16 Apr 2003] caused\nconsternation here by declaring that Beijing had undercounted and that the\ntotal might be in the range of 100 to 200. Mr. Gao urged the public to\nunderstand that the sudden multiplication of cases did not imply a sudden\nnew surge in disease, but rather that the official numbers were catching up\nto reality. \"In days to come, more of the `suspect' cases will be\nconfirmed,\" he added. With more complete SARS data only now compiled, Mr.\nGao said, the trend in the epidemic is unclear, and he could not say\nwhether new cases each day are now rising or falling.\n[Byline: Erik Eckholm]\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n******\n[4]\nDate: 20 Apr 2003\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: News briefs [edited]\n[A] Mongolia from VOA news 20 Apr 2003, 11:47 UTC\n<http://www.voanews.com/article.cfm?objectID=13E3640F-F168-41B2-ABB5C590DD5A9905&title=Mongolia%20Adopts%20Tough%20Anti%2DSARS%20Measures&catOID=45C9C78B-88AD-11D4-A57200A0CC5EE46C&categoryname=Asia%20Pacific>\nChina's neighbor, Mongolia, has introduced tough measures to cut the risk\nof infection after 5 people were suspected, but not confirmed, to have the\nvirus. Those being monitored had all visited a hospital in Hohhot, China.\nAlthough they had gone to China for non-SARS related ailments, 4 of the 5\ncame back with a fever.\nDoctor Udval Natsag, second in charge at the Ministry of Health, ....says\nthe Hohhot hospital had several confirmed cases of SARS, and so the\npossibility that the illness has spread north from China's Inner Mongolia\nregion is very real. \"There has been contact with their friends and\nfamily, and Mongolia is a high risk [area], because we have a border with\nInner Mongolia [in China],... many Mongolians travel to Inner Mongolia\nevery day.\" In the capital, Ulaanbaatar, public gatherings have been\nbanned, which has forced the shutdown of theaters and movies houses.

As of yesterday, 4 staff members, including\nat least one doctor, a nurse, and a respiratory therapist, were in\nhospital. Another 8 hospital staff members were sent into home quarantine\nas potential SARS cases.\nOfficials said they believe the [above] infections occurred during\ndifficult intubations, including one [on 13 Apr 2003] that took 4 hours.\nIntubation involves placing a tube down a patient's throat to facilitate\nbreathing. Some staff started feeling symptoms associated with SARS on [16\nand 17 Apr 2003]. The hospital's head of infection, prevention and\ncontrol, said one worker's eye shield slipped during the Sunday intubation\nprocedure, but there is no other known breach of the staff's \"full-droplet\"\nprotection. That includes gowns, gloves, eye shields, and N-95 masks. \"We\nwere using what both Health Canada and the (Atlanta-based) Centers for\nDisease Control consider to be maximal precautions for these patients,\" she\nsaid, adding \"it's possible some potentially infected staff members were\nnot present at the intubations. We're examining everything we do and we're\nlooking at a number of different options in terms of making that particular\nprocedure safer for the health care workers,\" she said. One option is\nanesthetizing patients for intubation to reduce saliva spread.\nThe hospital's head of microbiology, in a conference call with Health\nCanada and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said a CDC\nexpert surprised the others by revealing that the virus can remain potent\non objects much longer than previously thought. \"....in their studies, they\nfound that you could still culture viable virus from surfaces after as much\nas 24 hours, which is longer than we normally expect viruses to be able to\nsurvive in the environment.\"\n[C] Canada, Ontario from CBC Canada 20 Apr 2003 16:29 EDST\n<http://www.cbc.ca/stories/2003/04/20/sars_train030420>\nA woman thought to be infected with [the virus that causes] severe acute\nrespiratory syndrome was aboard a commuter train travelling west of Toronto\nlast week, public health officials said [today 20 Apr 2003]. She took the\ntrain on 2 separate occasions. Both times she was in a 4-passenger \"pod\"\nwith 3 other people who should watch themselves for symptoms, said the\nmedical officer of health for Halton Region. The woman had symptoms of the\nillness when she took the GO Train on 14 Apr 2003, leaving Union Station at\n4:30 PM, heading to Appleby station in Burlington, said [a] Toronto public\nhealth spokesperson. The next morning, the woman took the train again at\n7:32 AM to go to work as a nurse at Mount Sinai Hospital. She had a fever\nand was \"feeling unwell,\" but was not coughing. The woman was admitted to\nMount Sinai for treatment of SARS later on [15 Apr 2003].\n[D] China, Shanxi, Zhejiang, Jilin and Liaoning from the Times of India 20\nApr 2003 10:18 PM\n<http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/cms.dll/xml/uncomp/articleshow?msid=43993118>\nSARS has spread to 3 more provinces, while 2 more deaths were reported in\nnorth China's Shanxi province, taking the national toll to 81. A total of\n7 new cases of SARS have been reported in 3 Chinese provinces -- 3 in\nZhejiang (east China), 3 in Jilin, and one in Liaoning, both in northeast\nChina, the official Xinhua news agency reported.\nZhejiang's health bureau publicised the details of the diagnostic process\nand the measures taken with regard to the 3 patients. The patients'\nfamilies and others who were exposed to the patients have been placed in\nisolation for monitoring and observation. The SARS experts in Jilin said\nthat they have 3 confirmed [probable] cases and 2 suspected cases.\nMeanwhile, a report from Taiyuan, capital of north China's Shanxi province,\nreported that [as of 19 Apr 2003] 9 people had died of SARS in the province\nand there were 112 registered SARS cases in the province. 11 of these have\nrecovered and been discharged from hospitals.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[Today's update reports an additional 22 cases and 7 deaths reported in the\nprevious 24 hours by Hong Kong. Of these 7 deaths, 4 were in otherwise\nhealthy individuals less than 50 years of age. In Singapore, there has\nbeen one new case reported in the previous 24 hours, but there is concern\nabout potential exposure in a large market area. In response, the Ministry\nof Health has closed the market put all market vendors into home\nquarantine, alerted the public of the possibility of exposure, and\nrecommended they seek medical assistance at the SARS reference center (Tan\nTock Seng Hospital) if symptoms of SARS-like illness appear.\nThe news article on the political repercussions in China as a result of an\nunder-reporting of SARS cases in Beijing is highly significant [4]. It\nappears a clear signal to the international community that China is serious\nabout collaboration with the international community with respect to\ndisease surveillance and control, in this case with respect to SARS, but\nmost quite possibly with respect to disease surveillance and control in\ngeneral for the future. This was an unfortunate situation, possibly\ncontributing to increased transmission if the under-reporting and possible\n\"denial\" of the disease burden was associated with lack of implementation\nof appropriate infection control procedures in the health care setting,\ncombined with a lack of awareness of risk and need to seek early medical\nattention on the part of the general population, thereby having more\npotential contacts contributing to disease transmission. The above article\nat present denies the rumors of actual patient hiding, as was covered in\nthe CNN and Time articles mentioned in an 18 Apr 2003 ProMED-mail posting,\n(SARS - worldwide (57): cases 20030418.0952). Given this occurrence, one\nmight expect to see increases in numbers of cases SARS reported from\nelsewhere in China in the near future as well, if there has been\nintroduction and transmission of the SARS-related coronavirus. It will be\nof interest to see epidemic curves based on dates of onset of illness,\ndemonstrating the true course of the outbreak, as compared with looking at\nnumbers of cases reported each day which will reflect the \"outbreak\" of\nreporting, rather than the outbreak of disease.\nThe news article from Canada [5][B] points out continuing concerns related\nto the difficulties in interruption of transmission that are being seen in\nCanada. In spite of adherence to strict infection control procedures,\naccidents may happen that cause momentary breaks in these infection control\nprocedures, that in turn lead to transmission to the health care workers,\nat least in one of the 4 implicated in the new cluster reported.

Struggling to stop the spread of the disease, officials canceled a\nmajor week-long holiday in May, when tens of millions of people usually go\ntraveling.\nThe demotion of Health Minister Zhang Wenkang and Beijing Mayor Meng\nXuenong came shortly after officials held a 2-hour news conference to\nannounce the sharp increases in SARS cases. Zhang lost his post as\nsecretary of the leading party members' group of the Ministry of Health.\nMeng was removed as the deputy secretary of the party's Beijing Municipal\nCommittee.\nThe government said Sunday the flu-like illness has killed 12 more people\nand that the number of infections in Beijing has soared from 37 to\n346. The new figures raised China's total number of deaths to 79 and its\ncases to 1814, Gao Qiang, an executive vice health minister, said at a news\nconference. \"With such a situation, with more than 300 patients in\nBeijing, the situation is already very serious,\" Gao said. He added there\nwere 402 more suspected cases in the capital.\nGao also made a rare admission that his ministry was not properly prepared\nfor the outbreak. The ministry \"has not given out clear instructions or\neffective guidance,\" he said. But Gao denied reports that SARS cases were\nintentionally hidden from investigators. \"We have not discovered any\nlocality or place that has intentionally hidden these statistics,\" he said.\nIn recent weeks, several nations have urged their citizens to avoid\nunnecessary travel to China. However, the Chinese government continued to\nencourage the public to stick with plans to go on vacations during the\nweek-long May Day holiday, which was to start 1 May 2003. Marking a major\nshift in how China is viewing the SARS danger, Gao said that officials were\ncanceling the vacation period, which has been extended in recent years to\nboost the travel industry and encourage consumer spending. \"The purpose of\nsuch an act is to prevent the massive movement of people and the possible\nspread of the disease,\" Gao said. He acknowledged that the advisory could\ndeal a big blow to China's economy. \"I'm sure this measure will mean\nmassive losses in tourism revenue, but people's lives and health had to be\nput above everything else,\" Gao said.\nSo far, officials have not detected the spread of SARS in large rural\nareas, he said. He noted that farmers have lower incomes and less access to\nmedical care. If the outbreak hit the countryside, \"the consequences would\nbe grim,\" he said.\n[B] China Admits Much Higher Number of SARS Cases\n<http://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/20/international/asia/20CND-CHIN.html>\nWith bureaucratic shuffling and an apologetic, 2-hour news conference, a\nsenior health official, .... admitted to the existence of a large number of\npreviously undisclosed SARS patients in military hospitals and revealed\nwhat he called the first aggressive survey of cases in some 70 scattered\nhospitals. \"Accurate figures have not been reported to high authorities in\na timely manner,\" he added, though he later argued that incompetence rather\nthan deliberate deceit was the main problem. In an unusual move for such\nsensitive and embarrassing news, the news conference was broadcast live on\na national television channel.\nThe unveiling of markedly higher disease figures as well as the firings\n(perhaps the first of many) capped a tense week in which China's efforts to\nplay down SARS, especially in Beijing, were assailed by experts from the\nWorld Health Organization and questioned by medical whistleblowers here and\nby Beijing residents, who through word of mouth began hearing about far\nmore patients than officials had acknowledged.\nToday, Mr. Gao of the Health Ministry repeatedly tried to heap blame on the\nministry's shortcomings, and to the disarray in Beijing where several\npolitical jurisdictions, including municipal, national, military, and\nothers, overlap but have not coordinated disease-control efforts. As of\ntoday, Beijing city health officials will oversee all anti-SARS measures\nthroughout the urban area, including at military hospitals, Mr. Gao\nannounced. Mr. Gao also expressed concern about the spreading reports of\nSARS in several inland provinces, while some outside experts said the case\nreports from some distant provinces seemed too low. A major source of\nerror in previous Beijing reports was the exclusion of patients in several\nmajor hospitals that are run by the military, but which also hold civilian\npatients. The angry public assertion by a retired military surgeon that\nmore than 100 SARS patients were in the military system and being omitted\nfrom public reports was a major blow to the government's credibility and\ntoday, Mr. Gao revealed that the discrepancy was still greater. Of 353 SARS\npatients still in the hospital on Friday [18 Apr 2003], he said, 235 of\nthem were in military hospitals, a high proportion that no one has explained.\nOver the last week, Mr. Gao said, hundreds of officials were dispatched to\nall of Beijing's hospitals to check for possible SARS patients and to\nverify whether they had been reported to the city or national authorities.\nThey came up with totals that well surpassed the rough estimate of a World\nHealth Organization team, which on Wednesday [16 Apr 2003] caused\nconsternation here by declaring that Beijing had undercounted and that the\ntotal might be in the range of 100 to 200. Mr. Gao urged the public to\nunderstand that the sudden multiplication of cases did not imply a sudden\nnew surge in disease, but rather that the official numbers were catching up\nto reality. \"In days to come, more of the `suspect' cases will be\nconfirmed,\" he added. With more complete SARS data only now compiled, Mr.\nGao said, the trend in the epidemic is unclear, and he could not say\nwhether new cases each day are now rising or falling.\n[Byline: Erik Eckholm]\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n******\n[4]\nDate: 20 Apr 2003\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: News briefs [edited]\n[A] Mongolia from VOA news 20 Apr 2003, 11:47 UTC\n<http://www.voanews.com/article.cfm?objectID=13E3640F-F168-41B2-ABB5C590DD5A9905&title=Mongolia%20Adopts%20Tough%20Anti%2DSARS%20Measures&catOID=45C9C78B-88AD-11D4-A57200A0CC5EE46C&categoryname=Asia%20Pacific>\nChina's neighbor, Mongolia, has introduced tough measures to cut the risk\nof infection after 5 people were suspected, but not confirmed, to have the\nvirus. Those being monitored had all visited a hospital in Hohhot, China.\nAlthough they had gone to China for non-SARS related ailments, 4 of the 5\ncame back with a fever.\nDoctor Udval Natsag, second in charge at the Ministry of Health, ....says\nthe Hohhot hospital had several confirmed cases of SARS, and so the\npossibility that the illness has spread north from China's Inner Mongolia\nregion is very real. \"There has been contact with their friends and\nfamily, and Mongolia is a high risk [area], because we have a border with\nInner Mongolia [in China],... many Mongolians travel to Inner Mongolia\nevery day.\" In the capital, Ulaanbaatar, public gatherings have been\nbanned, which has forced the shutdown of theaters and movies houses.

As of yesterday, 4 staff members, including\nat least one doctor, a nurse, and a respiratory therapist, were in\nhospital. Another 8 hospital staff members were sent into home quarantine\nas potential SARS cases.\nOfficials said they believe the [above] infections occurred during\ndifficult intubations, including one [on 13 Apr 2003] that took 4 hours.\nIntubation involves placing a tube down a patient's throat to facilitate\nbreathing. Some staff started feeling symptoms associated with SARS on [16\nand 17 Apr 2003]. The hospital's head of infection, prevention and\ncontrol, said one worker's eye shield slipped during the Sunday intubation\nprocedure, but there is no other known breach of the staff's \"full-droplet\"\nprotection. That includes gowns, gloves, eye shields, and N-95 masks. \"We\nwere using what both Health Canada and the (Atlanta-based) Centers for\nDisease Control consider to be maximal precautions for these patients,\" she\nsaid, adding \"it's possible some potentially infected staff members were\nnot present at the intubations. We're examining everything we do and we're\nlooking at a number of different options in terms of making that particular\nprocedure safer for the health care workers,\" she said. One option is\nanesthetizing patients for intubation to reduce saliva spread.\nThe hospital's head of microbiology, in a conference call with Health\nCanada and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said a CDC\nexpert surprised the others by revealing that the virus can remain potent\non objects much longer than previously thought. \"....in their studies, they\nfound that you could still culture viable virus from surfaces after as much\nas 24 hours, which is longer than we normally expect viruses to be able to\nsurvive in the environment.\"\n[C] Canada, Ontario from CBC Canada 20 Apr 2003 16:29 EDST\n<http://www.cbc.ca/stories/2003/04/20/sars_train030420>\nA woman thought to be infected with [the virus that causes] severe acute\nrespiratory syndrome was aboard a commuter train travelling west of Toronto\nlast week, public health officials said [today 20 Apr 2003]. She took the\ntrain on 2 separate occasions. Both times she was in a 4-passenger \"pod\"\nwith 3 other people who should watch themselves for symptoms, said the\nmedical officer of health for Halton Region. The woman had symptoms of the\nillness when she took the GO Train on 14 Apr 2003, leaving Union Station at\n4:30 PM, heading to Appleby station in Burlington, said [a] Toronto public\nhealth spokesperson. The next morning, the woman took the train again at\n7:32 AM to go to work as a nurse at Mount Sinai Hospital. She had a fever\nand was \"feeling unwell,\" but was not coughing. The woman was admitted to\nMount Sinai for treatment of SARS later on [15 Apr 2003].\n[D] China, Shanxi, Zhejiang, Jilin and Liaoning from the Times of India 20\nApr 2003 10:18 PM\n<http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/cms.dll/xml/uncomp/articleshow?msid=43993118>\nSARS has spread to 3 more provinces, while 2 more deaths were reported in\nnorth China's Shanxi province, taking the national toll to 81. A total of\n7 new cases of SARS have been reported in 3 Chinese provinces -- 3 in\nZhejiang (east China), 3 in Jilin, and one in Liaoning, both in northeast\nChina, the official Xinhua news agency reported.\nZhejiang's health bureau publicised the details of the diagnostic process\nand the measures taken with regard to the 3 patients. The patients'\nfamilies and others who were exposed to the patients have been placed in\nisolation for monitoring and observation. The SARS experts in Jilin said\nthat they have 3 confirmed [probable] cases and 2 suspected cases.\nMeanwhile, a report from Taiyuan, capital of north China's Shanxi province,\nreported that [as of 19 Apr 2003] 9 people had died of SARS in the province\nand there were 112 registered SARS cases in the province. 11 of these have\nrecovered and been discharged from hospitals.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[Today's update reports an additional 22 cases and 7 deaths reported in the\nprevious 24 hours by Hong Kong. Of these 7 deaths, 4 were in otherwise\nhealthy individuals less than 50 years of age. In Singapore, there has\nbeen one new case reported in the previous 24 hours, but there is concern\nabout potential exposure in a large market area. In response, the Ministry\nof Health has closed the market put all market vendors into home\nquarantine, alerted the public of the possibility of exposure, and\nrecommended they seek medical assistance at the SARS reference center (Tan\nTock Seng Hospital) if symptoms of SARS-like illness appear.\nThe news article on the political repercussions in China as a result of an\nunder-reporting of SARS cases in Beijing is highly significant [4]. It\nappears a clear signal to the international community that China is serious\nabout collaboration with the international community with respect to\ndisease surveillance and control, in this case with respect to SARS, but\nmost quite possibly with respect to disease surveillance and control in\ngeneral for the future. This was an unfortunate situation, possibly\ncontributing to increased transmission if the under-reporting and possible\n\"denial\" of the disease burden was associated with lack of implementation\nof appropriate infection control procedures in the health care setting,\ncombined with a lack of awareness of risk and need to seek early medical\nattention on the part of the general population, thereby having more\npotential contacts contributing to disease transmission. The above article\nat present denies the rumors of actual patient hiding, as was covered in\nthe CNN and Time articles mentioned in an 18 Apr 2003 ProMED-mail posting,\n(SARS - worldwide (57): cases 20030418.0952). Given this occurrence, one\nmight expect to see increases in numbers of cases SARS reported from\nelsewhere in China in the near future as well, if there has been\nintroduction and transmission of the SARS-related coronavirus. It will be\nof interest to see epidemic curves based on dates of onset of illness,\ndemonstrating the true course of the outbreak, as compared with looking at\nnumbers of cases reported each day which will reflect the \"outbreak\" of\nreporting, rather than the outbreak of disease.\nThe news article from Canada [5][B] points out continuing concerns related\nto the difficulties in interruption of transmission that are being seen in\nCanada. In spite of adherence to strict infection control procedures,\naccidents may happen that cause momentary breaks in these infection control\nprocedures, that in turn lead to transmission to the health care workers,\nat least in one of the 4 implicated in the new cluster reported.

Struggling to stop the spread of the disease, officials canceled a\nmajor week-long holiday in May, when tens of millions of people usually go\ntraveling.\nThe demotion of Health Minister Zhang Wenkang and Beijing Mayor Meng\nXuenong came shortly after officials held a 2-hour news conference to\nannounce the sharp increases in SARS cases. Zhang lost his post as\nsecretary of the leading party members' group of the Ministry of Health.\nMeng was removed as the deputy secretary of the party's Beijing Municipal\nCommittee.\nThe government said Sunday the flu-like illness has killed 12 more people\nand that the number of infections in Beijing has soared from 37 to\n346. The new figures raised China's total number of deaths to 79 and its\ncases to 1814, Gao Qiang, an executive vice health minister, said at a news\nconference. \"With such a situation, with more than 300 patients in\nBeijing, the situation is already very serious,\" Gao said. He added there\nwere 402 more suspected cases in the capital.\nGao also made a rare admission that his ministry was not properly prepared\nfor the outbreak. The ministry \"has not given out clear instructions or\neffective guidance,\" he said. But Gao denied reports that SARS cases were\nintentionally hidden from investigators. \"We have not discovered any\nlocality or place that has intentionally hidden these statistics,\" he said.\nIn recent weeks, several nations have urged their citizens to avoid\nunnecessary travel to China. However, the Chinese government continued to\nencourage the public to stick with plans to go on vacations during the\nweek-long May Day holiday, which was to start 1 May 2003. Marking a major\nshift in how China is viewing the SARS danger, Gao said that officials were\ncanceling the vacation period, which has been extended in recent years to\nboost the travel industry and encourage consumer spending. \"The purpose of\nsuch an act is to prevent the massive movement of people and the possible\nspread of the disease,\" Gao said. He acknowledged that the advisory could\ndeal a big blow to China's economy. \"I'm sure this measure will mean\nmassive losses in tourism revenue, but people's lives and health had to be\nput above everything else,\" Gao said.\nSo far, officials have not detected the spread of SARS in large rural\nareas, he said. He noted that farmers have lower incomes and less access to\nmedical care. If the outbreak hit the countryside, \"the consequences would\nbe grim,\" he said.\n[B] China Admits Much Higher Number of SARS Cases\n<http://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/20/international/asia/20CND-CHIN.html>\nWith bureaucratic shuffling and an apologetic, 2-hour news conference, a\nsenior health official, .... admitted to the existence of a large number of\npreviously undisclosed SARS patients in military hospitals and revealed\nwhat he called the first aggressive survey of cases in some 70 scattered\nhospitals. \"Accurate figures have not been reported to high authorities in\na timely manner,\" he added, though he later argued that incompetence rather\nthan deliberate deceit was the main problem. In an unusual move for such\nsensitive and embarrassing news, the news conference was broadcast live on\na national television channel.\nThe unveiling of markedly higher disease figures as well as the firings\n(perhaps the first of many) capped a tense week in which China's efforts to\nplay down SARS, especially in Beijing, were assailed by experts from the\nWorld Health Organization and questioned by medical whistleblowers here and\nby Beijing residents, who through word of mouth began hearing about far\nmore patients than officials had acknowledged.\nToday, Mr. Gao of the Health Ministry repeatedly tried to heap blame on the\nministry's shortcomings, and to the disarray in Beijing where several\npolitical jurisdictions, including municipal, national, military, and\nothers, overlap but have not coordinated disease-control efforts. As of\ntoday, Beijing city health officials will oversee all anti-SARS measures\nthroughout the urban area, including at military hospitals, Mr. Gao\nannounced. Mr. Gao also expressed concern about the spreading reports of\nSARS in several inland provinces, while some outside experts said the case\nreports from some distant provinces seemed too low. A major source of\nerror in previous Beijing reports was the exclusion of patients in several\nmajor hospitals that are run by the military, but which also hold civilian\npatients. The angry public assertion by a retired military surgeon that\nmore than 100 SARS patients were in the military system and being omitted\nfrom public reports was a major blow to the government's credibility and\ntoday, Mr. Gao revealed that the discrepancy was still greater. Of 353 SARS\npatients still in the hospital on Friday [18 Apr 2003], he said, 235 of\nthem were in military hospitals, a high proportion that no one has explained.\nOver the last week, Mr. Gao said, hundreds of officials were dispatched to\nall of Beijing's hospitals to check for possible SARS patients and to\nverify whether they had been reported to the city or national authorities.\nThey came up with totals that well surpassed the rough estimate of a World\nHealth Organization team, which on Wednesday [16 Apr 2003] caused\nconsternation here by declaring that Beijing had undercounted and that the\ntotal might be in the range of 100 to 200. Mr. Gao urged the public to\nunderstand that the sudden multiplication of cases did not imply a sudden\nnew surge in disease, but rather that the official numbers were catching up\nto reality. \"In days to come, more of the `suspect' cases will be\nconfirmed,\" he added. With more complete SARS data only now compiled, Mr.\nGao said, the trend in the epidemic is unclear, and he could not say\nwhether new cases each day are now rising or falling.\n[Byline: Erik Eckholm]\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n******\n[4]\nDate: 20 Apr 2003\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: News briefs [edited]\n[A] Mongolia from VOA news 20 Apr 2003, 11:47 UTC\n<http://www.voanews.com/article.cfm?objectID=13E3640F-F168-41B2-ABB5C590DD5A9905&title=Mongolia%20Adopts%20Tough%20Anti%2DSARS%20Measures&catOID=45C9C78B-88AD-11D4-A57200A0CC5EE46C&categoryname=Asia%20Pacific>\nChina's neighbor, Mongolia, has introduced tough measures to cut the risk\nof infection after 5 people were suspected, but not confirmed, to have the\nvirus. Those being monitored had all visited a hospital in Hohhot, China.\nAlthough they had gone to China for non-SARS related ailments, 4 of the 5\ncame back with a fever.\nDoctor Udval Natsag, second in charge at the Ministry of Health, ....says\nthe Hohhot hospital had several confirmed cases of SARS, and so the\npossibility that the illness has spread north from China's Inner Mongolia\nregion is very real. \"There has been contact with their friends and\nfamily, and Mongolia is a high risk [area], because we have a border with\nInner Mongolia [in China],... many Mongolians travel to Inner Mongolia\nevery day.\" In the capital, Ulaanbaatar, public gatherings have been\nbanned, which has forced the shutdown of theaters and movies houses.

As of yesterday, 4 staff members, including\nat least one doctor, a nurse, and a respiratory therapist, were in\nhospital. Another 8 hospital staff members were sent into home quarantine\nas potential SARS cases.\nOfficials said they believe the [above] infections occurred during\ndifficult intubations, including one [on 13 Apr 2003] that took 4 hours.\nIntubation involves placing a tube down a patient's throat to facilitate\nbreathing. Some staff started feeling symptoms associated with SARS on [16\nand 17 Apr 2003]. The hospital's head of infection, prevention and\ncontrol, said one worker's eye shield slipped during the Sunday intubation\nprocedure, but there is no other known breach of the staff's \"full-droplet\"\nprotection. That includes gowns, gloves, eye shields, and N-95 masks. \"We\nwere using what both Health Canada and the (Atlanta-based) Centers for\nDisease Control consider to be maximal precautions for these patients,\" she\nsaid, adding \"it's possible some potentially infected staff members were\nnot present at the intubations. We're examining everything we do and we're\nlooking at a number of different options in terms of making that particular\nprocedure safer for the health care workers,\" she said. One option is\nanesthetizing patients for intubation to reduce saliva spread.\nThe hospital's head of microbiology, in a conference call with Health\nCanada and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said a CDC\nexpert surprised the others by revealing that the virus can remain potent\non objects much longer than previously thought. \"....in their studies, they\nfound that you could still culture viable virus from surfaces after as much\nas 24 hours, which is longer than we normally expect viruses to be able to\nsurvive in the environment.\"\n[C] Canada, Ontario from CBC Canada 20 Apr 2003 16:29 EDST\n<http://www.cbc.ca/stories/2003/04/20/sars_train030420>\nA woman thought to be infected with [the virus that causes] severe acute\nrespiratory syndrome was aboard a commuter train travelling west of Toronto\nlast week, public health officials said [today 20 Apr 2003]. She took the\ntrain on 2 separate occasions. Both times she was in a 4-passenger \"pod\"\nwith 3 other people who should watch themselves for symptoms, said the\nmedical officer of health for Halton Region. The woman had symptoms of the\nillness when she took the GO Train on 14 Apr 2003, leaving Union Station at\n4:30 PM, heading to Appleby station in Burlington, said [a] Toronto public\nhealth spokesperson. The next morning, the woman took the train again at\n7:32 AM to go to work as a nurse at Mount Sinai Hospital. She had a fever\nand was \"feeling unwell,\" but was not coughing. The woman was admitted to\nMount Sinai for treatment of SARS later on [15 Apr 2003].\n[D] China, Shanxi, Zhejiang, Jilin and Liaoning from the Times of India 20\nApr 2003 10:18 PM\n<http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/cms.dll/xml/uncomp/articleshow?msid=43993118>\nSARS has spread to 3 more provinces, while 2 more deaths were reported in\nnorth China's Shanxi province, taking the national toll to 81. A total of\n7 new cases of SARS have been reported in 3 Chinese provinces -- 3 in\nZhejiang (east China), 3 in Jilin, and one in Liaoning, both in northeast\nChina, the official Xinhua news agency reported.\nZhejiang's health bureau publicised the details of the diagnostic process\nand the measures taken with regard to the 3 patients. The patients'\nfamilies and others who were exposed to the patients have been placed in\nisolation for monitoring and observation. The SARS experts in Jilin said\nthat they have 3 confirmed [probable] cases and 2 suspected cases.\nMeanwhile, a report from Taiyuan, capital of north China's Shanxi province,\nreported that [as of 19 Apr 2003] 9 people had died of SARS in the province\nand there were 112 registered SARS cases in the province. 11 of these have\nrecovered and been discharged from hospitals.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[Today's update reports an additional 22 cases and 7 deaths reported in the\nprevious 24 hours by Hong Kong. Of these 7 deaths, 4 were in otherwise\nhealthy individuals less than 50 years of age. In Singapore, there has\nbeen one new case reported in the previous 24 hours, but there is concern\nabout potential exposure in a large market area. In response, the Ministry\nof Health has closed the market put all market vendors into home\nquarantine, alerted the public of the possibility of exposure, and\nrecommended they seek medical assistance at the SARS reference center (Tan\nTock Seng Hospital) if symptoms of SARS-like illness appear.\nThe news article on the political repercussions in China as a result of an\nunder-reporting of SARS cases in Beijing is highly significant [4]. It\nappears a clear signal to the international community that China is serious\nabout collaboration with the international community with respect to\ndisease surveillance and control, in this case with respect to SARS, but\nmost quite possibly with respect to disease surveillance and control in\ngeneral for the future. This was an unfortunate situation, possibly\ncontributing to increased transmission if the under-reporting and possible\n\"denial\" of the disease burden was associated with lack of implementation\nof appropriate infection control procedures in the health care setting,\ncombined with a lack of awareness of risk and need to seek early medical\nattention on the part of the general population, thereby having more\npotential contacts contributing to disease transmission. The above article\nat present denies the rumors of actual patient hiding, as was covered in\nthe CNN and Time articles mentioned in an 18 Apr 2003 ProMED-mail posting,\n(SARS - worldwide (57): cases 20030418.0952). Given this occurrence, one\nmight expect to see increases in numbers of cases SARS reported from\nelsewhere in China in the near future as well, if there has been\nintroduction and transmission of the SARS-related coronavirus. It will be\nof interest to see epidemic curves based on dates of onset of illness,\ndemonstrating the true course of the outbreak, as compared with looking at\nnumbers of cases reported each day which will reflect the \"outbreak\" of\nreporting, rather than the outbreak of disease.\nThe news article from Canada [5][B] points out continuing concerns related\nto the difficulties in interruption of transmission that are being seen in\nCanada. In spite of adherence to strict infection control procedures,\naccidents may happen that cause momentary breaks in these infection control\nprocedures, that in turn lead to transmission to the health care workers,\nat least in one of the 4 implicated in the new cluster reported.

Then as it spreads out from those workers into other\npopulations, the ages change, so it's very important to understand the\ndynamics of this disease.\n\nAs far as Beijing goes, last evening they visited the military hospital.\nThey estimated that there are at least 50 patients in this hospital with\nSARS from what they've seen. They also estimate that there are between\n100-200 probable cases in Beijing, more than has been reported, and they\nfeel that there might even be up to 1000 people who are under observation\nright now at various stages of infection; some probably are not SARS, in\nfact many are probably not SARS, but they are taking precautions in\nobserving these. It's our impression that China needs to get clear on how\nit reports these diseases and they are working very closely with the\nChinese to get better reporting. It's also the team's feeling that Beijing\nhas many resources that they can put to work on this disease and that SARS\nwill not be a problem in Beijing if they get these resources working. Their\nconcern is in the provinces, especially in the western provinces, and they\nare afraid that it will not only spread from cities into the communities\nbut into areas where there may not be health facilities that are very\nclosely accessible to people. So, the challenge now is for China to not\nonly report, but to trace infection, to do infection control in the\nhospitals, and do everything that the other countries are doing to stop the\nspread of this disease.\n\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[2]\nDate: 16 Apr 2003\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: Hong Kong - Department of Health [edited]\n<http://www.info.gov.hk/dh/new/index.htm>\n\n\nSituation report on atypical pneumonia 16 Apr 2003\n\nThe following is jointly issued by the Department of Health and the\nHospital Authority:\n\nAs of 3 PM 16 Apr 2003, there are an additional 36 patients confirmed to\nhave atypical pneumonia following admission to public hospitals earlier.\nThey include 7 healthcare workers (6 from Princess Margaret Hospital and\none from Pamela Youde Nethersole Eastern Hospital). The remaining 29 were\nother patients and contacts of patients with atypical pneumonia.\n\nA total of 257 patients have recovered from atypical pneumonia and have\nbeen discharged from public hospitals. Of them, 14 were discharged\ntoday. 122 patients are receiving treatment in intensive care unit.\n\n5 patients died in hospitals, bringing to 61 the total number of deaths\nrelating to atypical pneumonia. A 54-year-old female and a 73-year-old\nmale, both with a history of chronic disease, died in Queen Elizabeth\nHospital.

They comprise 2 staff\nmembers of National Cancer Centre (NCC), namely a radiographer who had been\nadmitted to Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH) since 9 Apr 2003 for observation,\nand a porter who was admitted to TTSH on 14 Apr 2003. Both patients\ndeveloped lung changes on chest X-ray yesterday and hence were diagnosed to\nhave SARS. The third SARS case is an inpatient at Singapore General\nHospital (SGH) Ward 58 who has been observed in TTSH since 13 Apr 2003, and\nwho developed lung changes yesterday. The other 2 cases comprise the son of\na SARS patient, and a doctor at National University Hospital (NUH) who\nlooked after 2 patients prior to their diagnosis of SARS.\n\nSituation Update at NCC\nThere are 2 NCC staff members who have been diagnosed as probable SARS.\n\nThe radiographer developed a fever (37.8 deg C) on Saturday 5 Apr 2003. He\ndid not see a doctor. He was well with no fever over the next 3 days (6--8\nApr 2003). He worked in the radiology department of NCC on 7 and 8 Apr\n2003. Twice-daily temperature monitoring was performed and he was noted to\nhave no fever. During these 2 days, he performed CT scans and MRI on a\ntotal of 11 patients.\n\nIn the early hours of 9 Apr 2003, he developed fever of 38.4 deg C. He went\nto Changi General Hospital (CGH) and was transferred to TTSH on the same\nday. On admission he was classified as a low-risk suspect for SARS. CGH\nobserved all the infection control measures when the patient was there.\n\nAnother hospital staff (porter), who handles dispatch work, developed a\nlow-grade fever (37.5 deg C) on the morning of Thu 10 Apr 2003. He was not\nassigned any duties and during that time he only came into contact with the\ndepartmental staff. At noon, his temperature went up to 38.6 deg C. He was\nseen at the SGH Staff Clinic and was given 2 days MC [medical leave?] and\nasked to return for a review on 12 Apr 2003.\n\nHe had no fever on 11 Apr 2003. He did not return to the Staff Clinic on 12\nApr 2003 and instead saw his neighbourhood General Practitioner (GP). He\nwas given 2 more days MC. He continued to have low-grade [fever]. On 14 Apr\n2003, he went directly to the Staff Clinic and was referred to TTSH and\nadmitted on the same day.\n\nBesides these 2 staff members, the other NCC staff are currently well. As a\nprecaution, NCC has closed its radiology department until 20 Apr 2003.\nUrgent radiological x-rays will be done at SGH A&E Dept. Non-urgent\nappointments will be deferred. NCC has contacted 10 of the 11 patients who\nhad X-ray investigations done by the radiographer and they are well.\nAlthough the radiographer did not go into the waiting room of the X-ray\ndepartment, as a precaution, NCC has been contacting the 200 patients who\nhave had other X-rays done during the period 7--9 Apr 2003. Investigations\nare still in progress to trace the source of infection.\n\nSituation Update at NUH\nThe doctor attended to a patient who was being treated for heart failure.\nThe patient, who was admitted to NUH on 8 Apr 2003, had been a visitor at\nSGH Ward 57 in end March. He had multiple medical conditions and did not\nhave fever at that time. When he was reviewed in the ward, the possibility\nof concurrent pneumonia was recognised as his condition had deteriorated.\nThe patient was unstable and required transfer to the NUH Intensive Care\nUnit where he was intubated. The transfer to TTSH took place later on the\nsame day when the patient's condition stabilised. The patient passed away\non 12 Apr 2003.\n\nThe NUH doctor developed fever on 11 Apr 2003 evening and was sent to TTSH\nEmergency Department on the same day. She has been diagnosed as a probable\nSARS case on 16 Apr 2003.\n\nHome Quarantine for non-SARS patients with chronic conditions discharged\nfrom SGH and TTSH\nContact tracing at SGH has identified the patients and healthcare workers\nwho may have been exposed to SARS. These contacts have been quarantined or\nare being monitored. There are about 800 inpatients at present in SGH who\nhave not been exposed. However, as a precaution, patients discharged from\nSGH from 17 Apr 2003 onwards who have chronic co-morbid conditions will be\nissued Home Quarantine Orders (HQO) for 10 days. At end of 10 days, SGH\nwill recall them for review, following which they will be on phone\nsurveillance for a further 10 days. The other discharged patients who do\nnot have any chronic conditions will not be on HQO but phone surveillance\nfor 21 days. The same arrangement will be implemented for non-SARS patients\nwith chronic conditions discharged from TTSH.\n\nSummary of SARS cases\nThere was a SARS patient in intensive care who died late 15 Apr 2003. She\nwas the mother of a doctor who contracted SARS while looking after a SARS\npatient. The other deceased is the mother of a SARS patient. On 13 Apr\n2003, we reported 2 SARS deaths linked to the SGH cluster comprising an\ninpatient and the brother of an index patient. The preliminary findings of\nboth patients were that they died of other medical conditions unrelated to\nSARS. We are awaiting results of further investigations.\n\nBelow is the summary of the SARS cases to date:\n\nNumber Discharged: 85 plus 6\nHospitalised: 61 (including 16 in intensive care)\nDeaths: 13 + 2 (pending post mortem findings)\n\nTotal: 167\n\nSuspected: 91 (including 8 children below 18)\nUnder home quarantine orders: 582\n\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[4]\nDate: 16 Apr 2003\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: CDC SARS website 16 Apr 2003 [edited]\n<http://www.cdc.gov/od/oc/media/sars.htm>\n\n\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome report of suspected cases under\ninvestigation in the United States\n\nThese data were reported to the World Health Organization on 15 Apr 2003.\n\nState: suspected cases under investigation\n\nAlabama: 1\nCalifornia: 42\nColorado: 6\nConnecticut: 4\nFlorida: 11\nGeorgia: 3\nHawaii: 5\nIllinois: 11\nIndiana: 1\nKansas: 1\nKentucky: 1\nMaine: 2\nMassachusetts: 8\nMichigan: 3\nMinnesota: 6\nMississippi: 1\nMissouri: 2\nNevada: 1\nNew Hampshire: 1\nNew Jersey: 3\nNew Mexico: 1\nNew York: 22\nNorth Carolina: 6\nOhio: 10\nOregon: 1\nPennsylvania: 5\nRhode Island: 1\nSouth Carolina: 1\nTexas: 7\nUtah: 5\nVermont: 2\nVirginia: 5\nWashington: 19\nWisconsin: 1\n\nTotal suspected cases under investigation: 199\n\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[5]\nDate: 16 Apr 2003\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: Health Canada [edited]\n<http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/english/protection/warnings/sars/update32.html>\n\n\nUpdate 32: Severe acute respiratory syndrome -- 16 Apr 2003 4:30 PM\n\nAs of 16 Apr 2003, Health Canada has received reports of 303 probable or\nsuspect cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Canada. There\nhave been 13 deaths in Canada. To date, transmission has been limited to\nspecific transmission settings such as households, hospitals, and specific\ncommunity settings. The information contained in this update is based on\nthe information available to Health Canada at this time.\n\nThe details of the cases to date are as follows:\n\nOntario is reporting 122 probable and 127 suspect cases. All cases have\noccurred in persons who have traveled to Asia or had contact with SARS\ncases in the household or in a health-care setting.\nBritish Columbia is reporting 4 probable and 38 suspect cases.\nNew Brunswick is reporting 2 suspect cases.\nSaskatchewan is reporting 1 suspect case.\nAlberta is reporting 5 suspect cases.\nPrince Edward Island is reporting 4 suspect cases.\n\nSo far, 91 people have been discharged from hospitals in Ontario. These\npeople were treated as suspect cases or as probable cases.\n\nThese numbers are accurate as of 1:00 PM EDST 16 Apr 2003.\n\n[These data do not mention the newswire reports of transmission within a\nreligious community related to attendance at a funeral of a probable SARS\ncase. The newswire reports have been varied, with some mentioning that\nmost of the cases had been previously reported, but according to this\nupdate there is no mention of community-based close contact, which appeared\nto be the mode of transmission in this generation of cases. More\ninformation on this observation from official sources would be appreciated.\n- Mod.MPP]\n\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[As of today's update there is a cumulative total of 3293 cases of SARS\nreported to the WHO, with 58 new cases reported in the preceding 24 hours;\na total of 159 deaths (case fatality rate of 4.8 percent) and 1548 patients\nhave recovered (47 percent). In the past 24 hours, Hong Kong has reported\n36 new cases and 5 deaths; in China there have been 14 new cases\nreported. Based on the information provided by Dr. Heymann in today's WHO\npress briefing, we expect to see the numbers of cases reported from Beijing\nto increase significantly once official reports from the military hospitals\nare received. In addition, there has been the suggestion of increased\ntransmission outside of Beijing and Guangdong. It would be interesting to\nsee a breakdown of reported cases by province to determine whether new\nareas of local transmission have been identified. For example, the lay\npress has reported cases in Inner Mongolia, suggesting local transmission,\nbut this area has not officially been added to the affected areas list --\nsee ProMED-mail posting SARS - worldwide (45): cases 20030412.0890.\n\nThere are now 199 suspected cases from 32 states in the United States. This\nrepresents an increase of 6 cases from the last report on 15 Apr\n2003. There has been mention in press releases (CDC press release 14 Apr\n2003 (accessible at:\n<http://www.cdc.gov/od/oc/media/transcripts/t030414.htm> and in many lay\npress reports) that the USA plans to change reporting practices, separating\nsuspected and probable cases using the WHO definitions. When that occurs,\nwe expect to see a marked decrease in the numbers of cases of SARS reported\non a daily basis to WHO. - Mod.MPP]\nSee Also\nSARS - worldwide (50): (cases) 20030415.0922\nSARS - worldwide (49): cases 20030414.0916\nSARS - worldwide (47): cases 20030413.0905\nSARS - worldwide (46): diagnostic test 20030413.0901\nSARS - worldwide (44): UK transmission suspected 20030412.0887\nSARS - worldwide (42): WHO historical overview 20030411.0878\nSARS - worldwide (41):overview 20030411.0876\nSARS - worldwide (38): etiology 20030410.0869\nSARS - Worldwide (34): etiology 20030408.0857\nSARS - worldwide (13): etiology 20030327.0758\nSARS - worldwide (04): etiology 20030325.0737\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - worldwide (17) 20030322.0713\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - Worldwide: alert (03) 20030316.0660\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - Worldwide (02):alert 20030315.0649\nSevere Acute Respiratory Syndrome - Worldwide 20030315.0637\nAcute respiratory syndrome - Canada (Ontario) 20030314.0631\nAcute respiratory syndrome - East Asia 20030314.0630\nAcute respiratory syndrome - China (HK), VietNam (03) 20030313.0624\nUndiagnosed illness - Vietnam (Hanoi): RFI 20030311.0595\nPneumonia - China (Guangdong) (07) 20030221.0452\nPneumonia - China (Guangdong): RFI 20030210.0357\n.................................mpp/pg/dk\n\n*##########################################################*\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.

Then as it spreads out from those workers into other\npopulations, the ages change, so it's very important to understand the\ndynamics of this disease.\n\nAs far as Beijing goes, last evening they visited the military hospital.\nThey estimated that there are at least 50 patients in this hospital with\nSARS from what they've seen. They also estimate that there are between\n100-200 probable cases in Beijing, more than has been reported, and they\nfeel that there might even be up to 1000 people who are under observation\nright now at various stages of infection; some probably are not SARS, in\nfact many are probably not SARS, but they are taking precautions in\nobserving these. It's our impression that China needs to get clear on how\nit reports these diseases and they are working very closely with the\nChinese to get better reporting. It's also the team's feeling that Beijing\nhas many resources that they can put to work on this disease and that SARS\nwill not be a problem in Beijing if they get these resources working. Their\nconcern is in the provinces, especially in the western provinces, and they\nare afraid that it will not only spread from cities into the communities\nbut into areas where there may not be health facilities that are very\nclosely accessible to people. So, the challenge now is for China to not\nonly report, but to trace infection, to do infection control in the\nhospitals, and do everything that the other countries are doing to stop the\nspread of this disease.\n\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[2]\nDate: 16 Apr 2003\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: Hong Kong - Department of Health [edited]\n<http://www.info.gov.hk/dh/new/index.htm>\n\n\nSituation report on atypical pneumonia 16 Apr 2003\n\nThe following is jointly issued by the Department of Health and the\nHospital Authority:\n\nAs of 3 PM 16 Apr 2003, there are an additional 36 patients confirmed to\nhave atypical pneumonia following admission to public hospitals earlier.\nThey include 7 healthcare workers (6 from Princess Margaret Hospital and\none from Pamela Youde Nethersole Eastern Hospital). The remaining 29 were\nother patients and contacts of patients with atypical pneumonia.\n\nA total of 257 patients have recovered from atypical pneumonia and have\nbeen discharged from public hospitals. Of them, 14 were discharged\ntoday. 122 patients are receiving treatment in intensive care unit.\n\n5 patients died in hospitals, bringing to 61 the total number of deaths\nrelating to atypical pneumonia. A 54-year-old female and a 73-year-old\nmale, both with a history of chronic disease, died in Queen Elizabeth\nHospital. A 44-year-old male and a 62-year-old female died in Princess\nMargaret Hospital. Another chronically ill male patient, aged 73, died in\nAlice Ho Miu Ling Nethersole Hospital.\n\nThe cumulative figure for patients who have been admitted to public\nhospitals with atypical pneumonia since 12 Mar 2003 is as follows:\n\nCumulative no. cases/ no. recovered/ no. deaths\nHealth care workers of Hospitals/Clinics and medical students: 298/ 100/ 61\nPatients, family members & visitors: 970/ 157/ 0\nTotal: 1268/ 257 /61\n\n* Most of the deaths occurred in individuals who have a history of\nchronic diseases or were patients who sought treatment at a relatively late\nstage of infection.\n\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[3]\nDate: 16 Apr 2003\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: Singapore - Ministry of Health 16 Apr 2003 [edited]\n<http://app.moh.gov.sg/sar/sar0301.asp?id=1&mid=6180>\n\n\nSARS Situation Update 16 Apr 2003\n\nAs of 16 Apr 2003, 6 additional SARS patients have been discharged,\nbringing the total number of patients who have recovered from SARS to 91.\n61 SARS patients remain hospitalised.\n\nThere are 5 additional SARS cases reported today. They comprise 2 staff\nmembers of National Cancer Centre (NCC), namely a radiographer who had been\nadmitted to Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH) since 9 Apr 2003 for observation,\nand a porter who was admitted to TTSH on 14 Apr 2003. Both patients\ndeveloped lung changes on chest X-ray yesterday and hence were diagnosed to\nhave SARS. The third SARS case is an inpatient at Singapore General\nHospital (SGH) Ward 58 who has been observed in TTSH since 13 Apr 2003, and\nwho developed lung changes yesterday. The other 2 cases comprise the son of\na SARS patient, and a doctor at National University Hospital (NUH) who\nlooked after 2 patients prior to their diagnosis of SARS.\n\nSituation Update at NCC\nThere are 2 NCC staff members who have been diagnosed as probable SARS.\n\nThe radiographer developed a fever (37.8 deg C) on Saturday 5 Apr 2003. He\ndid not see a doctor. He was well with no fever over the next 3 days (6--8\nApr 2003). He worked in the radiology department of NCC on 7 and 8 Apr\n2003. Twice-daily temperature monitoring was performed and he was noted to\nhave no fever. During these 2 days, he performed CT scans and MRI on a\ntotal of 11 patients.\n\nIn the early hours of 9 Apr 2003, he developed fever of 38.4 deg C. He went\nto Changi General Hospital (CGH) and was transferred to TTSH on the same\nday. On admission he was classified as a low-risk suspect for SARS. CGH\nobserved all the infection control measures when the patient was there.\n\nAnother hospital staff (porter), who handles dispatch work, developed a\nlow-grade fever (37.5 deg C) on the morning of Thu 10 Apr 2003. He was not\nassigned any duties and during that time he only came into contact with the\ndepartmental staff. At noon, his temperature went up to 38.6 deg C. He was\nseen at the SGH Staff Clinic and was given 2 days MC [medical leave?] and\nasked to return for a review on 12 Apr 2003.\n\nHe had no fever on 11 Apr 2003. He did not return to the Staff Clinic on 12\nApr 2003 and instead saw his neighbourhood General Practitioner (GP). He\nwas given 2 more days MC. He continued to have low-grade [fever]. On 14 Apr\n2003, he went directly to the Staff Clinic and was referred to TTSH and\nadmitted on the same day.\n\nBesides these 2 staff members, the other NCC staff are currently well. As a\nprecaution, NCC has closed its radiology department until 20 Apr 2003.\nUrgent radiological x-rays will be done at SGH A&E Dept. Non-urgent\nappointments will be deferred. NCC has contacted 10 of the 11 patients who\nhad X-ray investigations done by the radiographer and they are well.\nAlthough the radiographer did not go into the waiting room of the X-ray\ndepartment, as a precaution, NCC has been contacting the 200 patients who\nhave had other X-rays done during the period 7--9 Apr 2003. Investigations\nare still in progress to trace the source of infection.\n\nSituation Update at NUH\nThe doctor attended to a patient who was being treated for heart failure.\nThe patient, who was admitted to NUH on 8 Apr 2003, had been a visitor at\nSGH Ward 57 in end March. He had multiple medical conditions and did not\nhave fever at that time. When he was reviewed in the ward, the possibility\nof concurrent pneumonia was recognised as his condition had deteriorated.\nThe patient was unstable and required transfer to the NUH Intensive Care\nUnit where he was intubated. The transfer to TTSH took place later on the\nsame day when the patient's condition stabilised. The patient passed away\non 12 Apr 2003.\n\nThe NUH doctor developed fever on 11 Apr 2003 evening and was sent to TTSH\nEmergency Department on the same day. She has been diagnosed as a probable\nSARS case on 16 Apr 2003.\n\nHome Quarantine for non-SARS patients with chronic conditions discharged\nfrom SGH and TTSH\nContact tracing at SGH has identified the patients and healthcare workers\nwho may have been exposed to SARS. These contacts have been quarantined or\nare being monitored. There are about 800 inpatients at present in SGH who\nhave not been exposed. However, as a precaution, patients discharged from\nSGH from 17 Apr 2003 onwards who have chronic co-morbid conditions will be\nissued Home Quarantine Orders (HQO) for 10 days. At end of 10 days, SGH\nwill recall them for review, following which they will be on phone\nsurveillance for a further 10 days. The other discharged patients who do\nnot have any chronic conditions will not be on HQO but phone surveillance\nfor 21 days. The same arrangement will be implemented for non-SARS patients\nwith chronic conditions discharged from TTSH.\n\nSummary of SARS cases\nThere was a SARS patient in intensive care who died late 15 Apr 2003. She\nwas the mother of a doctor who contracted SARS while looking after a SARS\npatient. The other deceased is the mother of a SARS patient. On 13 Apr\n2003, we reported 2 SARS deaths linked to the SGH cluster comprising an\ninpatient and the brother of an index patient. The preliminary findings of\nboth patients were that they died of other medical conditions unrelated to\nSARS. We are awaiting results of further investigations.\n\nBelow is the summary of the SARS cases to date:\n\nNumber Discharged: 85 plus 6\nHospitalised: 61 (including 16 in intensive care)\nDeaths: 13 + 2 (pending post mortem findings)\n\nTotal: 167\n\nSuspected: 91 (including 8 children below 18)\nUnder home quarantine orders: 582\n\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[4]\nDate: 16 Apr 2003\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: CDC SARS website 16 Apr 2003 [edited]\n<http://www.cdc.gov/od/oc/media/sars.htm>\n\n\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome report of suspected cases under\ninvestigation in the United States\n\nThese data were reported to the World Health Organization on 15 Apr 2003.\n\nState: suspected cases under investigation\n\nAlabama: 1\nCalifornia: 42\nColorado: 6\nConnecticut: 4\nFlorida: 11\nGeorgia: 3\nHawaii: 5\nIllinois: 11\nIndiana: 1\nKansas: 1\nKentucky: 1\nMaine: 2\nMassachusetts: 8\nMichigan: 3\nMinnesota: 6\nMississippi: 1\nMissouri: 2\nNevada: 1\nNew Hampshire: 1\nNew Jersey: 3\nNew Mexico: 1\nNew York: 22\nNorth Carolina: 6\nOhio: 10\nOregon: 1\nPennsylvania: 5\nRhode Island: 1\nSouth Carolina: 1\nTexas: 7\nUtah: 5\nVermont: 2\nVirginia: 5\nWashington: 19\nWisconsin: 1\n\nTotal suspected cases under investigation: 199\n\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[5]\nDate: 16 Apr 2003\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: Health Canada [edited]\n<http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/english/protection/warnings/sars/update32.html>\n\n\nUpdate 32: Severe acute respiratory syndrome -- 16 Apr 2003 4:30 PM\n\nAs of 16 Apr 2003, Health Canada has received reports of 303 probable or\nsuspect cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Canada. There\nhave been 13 deaths in Canada. To date, transmission has been limited to\nspecific transmission settings such as households, hospitals, and specific\ncommunity settings. The information contained in this update is based on\nthe information available to Health Canada at this time.\n\nThe details of the cases to date are as follows:\n\nOntario is reporting 122 probable and 127 suspect cases. All cases have\noccurred in persons who have traveled to Asia or had contact with SARS\ncases in the household or in a health-care setting.\nBritish Columbia is reporting 4 probable and 38 suspect cases.\nNew Brunswick is reporting 2 suspect cases.\nSaskatchewan is reporting 1 suspect case.\nAlberta is reporting 5 suspect cases.\nPrince Edward Island is reporting 4 suspect cases.\n\nSo far, 91 people have been discharged from hospitals in Ontario. These\npeople were treated as suspect cases or as probable cases.\n\nThese numbers are accurate as of 1:00 PM EDST 16 Apr 2003.\n\n[These data do not mention the newswire reports of transmission within a\nreligious community related to attendance at a funeral of a probable SARS\ncase. The newswire reports have been varied, with some mentioning that\nmost of the cases had been previously reported, but according to this\nupdate there is no mention of community-based close contact, which appeared\nto be the mode of transmission in this generation of cases. More\ninformation on this observation from official sources would be appreciated.\n- Mod.MPP]\n\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[As of today's update there is a cumulative total of 3293 cases of SARS\nreported to the WHO, with 58 new cases reported in the preceding 24 hours;\na total of 159 deaths (case fatality rate of 4.8 percent) and 1548 patients\nhave recovered (47 percent). In the past 24 hours, Hong Kong has reported\n36 new cases and 5 deaths; in China there have been 14 new cases\nreported. Based on the information provided by Dr. Heymann in today's WHO\npress briefing, we expect to see the numbers of cases reported from Beijing\nto increase significantly once official reports from the military hospitals\nare received. In addition, there has been the suggestion of increased\ntransmission outside of Beijing and Guangdong. It would be interesting to\nsee a breakdown of reported cases by province to determine whether new\nareas of local transmission have been identified. For example, the lay\npress has reported cases in Inner Mongolia, suggesting local transmission,\nbut this area has not officially been added to the affected areas list --\nsee ProMED-mail posting SARS - worldwide (45): cases 20030412.0890.\n\nThere are now 199 suspected cases from 32 states in the United States. This\nrepresents an increase of 6 cases from the last report on 15 Apr\n2003. There has been mention in press releases (CDC press release 14 Apr\n2003 (accessible at:\n<http://www.cdc.gov/od/oc/media/transcripts/t030414.htm> and in many lay\npress reports) that the USA plans to change reporting practices, separating\nsuspected and probable cases using the WHO definitions. When that occurs,\nwe expect to see a marked decrease in the numbers of cases of SARS reported\non a daily basis to WHO. - Mod.MPP]\nSee Also\nSARS - worldwide (50): (cases) 20030415.0922\nSARS - worldwide (49): cases 20030414.0916\nSARS - worldwide (47): cases 20030413.0905\nSARS - worldwide (46): diagnostic test 20030413.0901\nSARS - worldwide (44): UK transmission suspected 20030412.0887\nSARS - worldwide (42): WHO historical overview 20030411.0878\nSARS - worldwide (41):overview 20030411.0876\nSARS - worldwide (38): etiology 20030410.0869\nSARS - Worldwide (34): etiology 20030408.0857\nSARS - worldwide (13): etiology 20030327.0758\nSARS - worldwide (04): etiology 20030325.0737\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - worldwide (17) 20030322.0713\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - Worldwide: alert (03) 20030316.0660\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - Worldwide (02):alert 20030315.0649\nSevere Acute Respiratory Syndrome - Worldwide 20030315.0637\nAcute respiratory syndrome - Canada (Ontario) 20030314.0631\nAcute respiratory syndrome - East Asia 20030314.0630\nAcute respiratory syndrome - China (HK), VietNam (03) 20030313.0624\nUndiagnosed illness - Vietnam (Hanoi): RFI 20030311.0595\nPneumonia - China (Guangdong) (07) 20030221.0452\nPneumonia - China (Guangdong): RFI 20030210.0357\n.................................mpp/pg/dk\n\n*##########################################################*\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.

Then as it spreads out from those workers into other\npopulations, the ages change, so it's very important to understand the\ndynamics of this disease.\n\nAs far as Beijing goes, last evening they visited the military hospital.\nThey estimated that there are at least 50 patients in this hospital with\nSARS from what they've seen. They also estimate that there are between\n100-200 probable cases in Beijing, more than has been reported, and they\nfeel that there might even be up to 1000 people who are under observation\nright now at various stages of infection; some probably are not SARS, in\nfact many are probably not SARS, but they are taking precautions in\nobserving these. It's our impression that China needs to get clear on how\nit reports these diseases and they are working very closely with the\nChinese to get better reporting. It's also the team's feeling that Beijing\nhas many resources that they can put to work on this disease and that SARS\nwill not be a problem in Beijing if they get these resources working. Their\nconcern is in the provinces, especially in the western provinces, and they\nare afraid that it will not only spread from cities into the communities\nbut into areas where there may not be health facilities that are very\nclosely accessible to people. So, the challenge now is for China to not\nonly report, but to trace infection, to do infection control in the\nhospitals, and do everything that the other countries are doing to stop the\nspread of this disease.\n\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[2]\nDate: 16 Apr 2003\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: Hong Kong - Department of Health [edited]\n<http://www.info.gov.hk/dh/new/index.htm>\n\n\nSituation report on atypical pneumonia 16 Apr 2003\n\nThe following is jointly issued by the Department of Health and the\nHospital Authority:\n\nAs of 3 PM 16 Apr 2003, there are an additional 36 patients confirmed to\nhave atypical pneumonia following admission to public hospitals earlier.\nThey include 7 healthcare workers (6 from Princess Margaret Hospital and\none from Pamela Youde Nethersole Eastern Hospital). The remaining 29 were\nother patients and contacts of patients with atypical pneumonia.\n\nA total of 257 patients have recovered from atypical pneumonia and have\nbeen discharged from public hospitals. Of them, 14 were discharged\ntoday. 122 patients are receiving treatment in intensive care unit.\n\n5 patients died in hospitals, bringing to 61 the total number of deaths\nrelating to atypical pneumonia. A 54-year-old female and a 73-year-old\nmale, both with a history of chronic disease, died in Queen Elizabeth\nHospital. A 44-year-old male and a 62-year-old female died in Princess\nMargaret Hospital. Another chronically ill male patient, aged 73, died in\nAlice Ho Miu Ling Nethersole Hospital.\n\nThe cumulative figure for patients who have been admitted to public\nhospitals with atypical pneumonia since 12 Mar 2003 is as follows:\n\nCumulative no. cases/ no. recovered/ no. deaths\nHealth care workers of Hospitals/Clinics and medical students: 298/ 100/ 61\nPatients, family members & visitors: 970/ 157/ 0\nTotal: 1268/ 257 /61\n\n* Most of the deaths occurred in individuals who have a history of\nchronic diseases or were patients who sought treatment at a relatively late\nstage of infection.\n\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[3]\nDate: 16 Apr 2003\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: Singapore - Ministry of Health 16 Apr 2003 [edited]\n<http://app.moh.gov.sg/sar/sar0301.asp?id=1&mid=6180>\n\n\nSARS Situation Update 16 Apr 2003\n\nAs of 16 Apr 2003, 6 additional SARS patients have been discharged,\nbringing the total number of patients who have recovered from SARS to 91.\n61 SARS patients remain hospitalised.\n\nThere are 5 additional SARS cases reported today. They comprise 2 staff\nmembers of National Cancer Centre (NCC), namely a radiographer who had been\nadmitted to Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH) since 9 Apr 2003 for observation,\nand a porter who was admitted to TTSH on 14 Apr 2003. Both patients\ndeveloped lung changes on chest X-ray yesterday and hence were diagnosed to\nhave SARS. The third SARS case is an inpatient at Singapore General\nHospital (SGH) Ward 58 who has been observed in TTSH since 13 Apr 2003, and\nwho developed lung changes yesterday. The other 2 cases comprise the son of\na SARS patient, and a doctor at National University Hospital (NUH) who\nlooked after 2 patients prior to their diagnosis of SARS.\n\nSituation Update at NCC\nThere are 2 NCC staff members who have been diagnosed as probable SARS.\n\nThe radiographer developed a fever (37.8 deg C) on Saturday 5 Apr 2003. He\ndid not see a doctor. He was well with no fever over the next 3 days (6--8\nApr 2003). He worked in the radiology department of NCC on 7 and 8 Apr\n2003. Twice-daily temperature monitoring was performed and he was noted to\nhave no fever. During these 2 days, he performed CT scans and MRI on a\ntotal of 11 patients.\n\nIn the early hours of 9 Apr 2003, he developed fever of 38.4 deg C. He went\nto Changi General Hospital (CGH) and was transferred to TTSH on the same\nday. On admission he was classified as a low-risk suspect for SARS. CGH\nobserved all the infection control measures when the patient was there.\n\nAnother hospital staff (porter), who handles dispatch work, developed a\nlow-grade fever (37.5 deg C) on the morning of Thu 10 Apr 2003. He was not\nassigned any duties and during that time he only came into contact with the\ndepartmental staff. At noon, his temperature went up to 38.6 deg C. He was\nseen at the SGH Staff Clinic and was given 2 days MC [medical leave?] and\nasked to return for a review on 12 Apr 2003.\n\nHe had no fever on 11 Apr 2003. He did not return to the Staff Clinic on 12\nApr 2003 and instead saw his neighbourhood General Practitioner (GP). He\nwas given 2 more days MC. He continued to have low-grade [fever]. On 14 Apr\n2003, he went directly to the Staff Clinic and was referred to TTSH and\nadmitted on the same day.\n\nBesides these 2 staff members, the other NCC staff are currently well. As a\nprecaution, NCC has closed its radiology department until 20 Apr 2003.\nUrgent radiological x-rays will be done at SGH A&E Dept. Non-urgent\nappointments will be deferred. NCC has contacted 10 of the 11 patients who\nhad X-ray investigations done by the radiographer and they are well.\nAlthough the radiographer did not go into the waiting room of the X-ray\ndepartment, as a precaution, NCC has been contacting the 200 patients who\nhave had other X-rays done during the period 7--9 Apr 2003. Investigations\nare still in progress to trace the source of infection.\n\nSituation Update at NUH\nThe doctor attended to a patient who was being treated for heart failure.\nThe patient, who was admitted to NUH on 8 Apr 2003, had been a visitor at\nSGH Ward 57 in end March. He had multiple medical conditions and did not\nhave fever at that time. When he was reviewed in the ward, the possibility\nof concurrent pneumonia was recognised as his condition had deteriorated.\nThe patient was unstable and required transfer to the NUH Intensive Care\nUnit where he was intubated. The transfer to TTSH took place later on the\nsame day when the patient's condition stabilised. The patient passed away\non 12 Apr 2003.\n\nThe NUH doctor developed fever on 11 Apr 2003 evening and was sent to TTSH\nEmergency Department on the same day. She has been diagnosed as a probable\nSARS case on 16 Apr 2003.\n\nHome Quarantine for non-SARS patients with chronic conditions discharged\nfrom SGH and TTSH\nContact tracing at SGH has identified the patients and healthcare workers\nwho may have been exposed to SARS. These contacts have been quarantined or\nare being monitored. There are about 800 inpatients at present in SGH who\nhave not been exposed. However, as a precaution, patients discharged from\nSGH from 17 Apr 2003 onwards who have chronic co-morbid conditions will be\nissued Home Quarantine Orders (HQO) for 10 days. At end of 10 days, SGH\nwill recall them for review, following which they will be on phone\nsurveillance for a further 10 days. The other discharged patients who do\nnot have any chronic conditions will not be on HQO but phone surveillance\nfor 21 days. The same arrangement will be implemented for non-SARS patients\nwith chronic conditions discharged from TTSH.\n\nSummary of SARS cases\nThere was a SARS patient in intensive care who died late 15 Apr 2003. She\nwas the mother of a doctor who contracted SARS while looking after a SARS\npatient. The other deceased is the mother of a SARS patient. On 13 Apr\n2003, we reported 2 SARS deaths linked to the SGH cluster comprising an\ninpatient and the brother of an index patient. The preliminary findings of\nboth patients were that they died of other medical conditions unrelated to\nSARS. We are awaiting results of further investigations.\n\nBelow is the summary of the SARS cases to date:\n\nNumber Discharged: 85 plus 6\nHospitalised: 61 (including 16 in intensive care)\nDeaths: 13 + 2 (pending post mortem findings)\n\nTotal: 167\n\nSuspected: 91 (including 8 children below 18)\nUnder home quarantine orders: 582\n\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[4]\nDate: 16 Apr 2003\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: CDC SARS website 16 Apr 2003 [edited]\n<http://www.cdc.gov/od/oc/media/sars.htm>\n\n\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome report of suspected cases under\ninvestigation in the United States\n\nThese data were reported to the World Health Organization on 15 Apr 2003.\n\nState: suspected cases under investigation\n\nAlabama: 1\nCalifornia: 42\nColorado: 6\nConnecticut: 4\nFlorida: 11\nGeorgia: 3\nHawaii: 5\nIllinois: 11\nIndiana: 1\nKansas: 1\nKentucky: 1\nMaine: 2\nMassachusetts: 8\nMichigan: 3\nMinnesota: 6\nMississippi: 1\nMissouri: 2\nNevada: 1\nNew Hampshire: 1\nNew Jersey: 3\nNew Mexico: 1\nNew York: 22\nNorth Carolina: 6\nOhio: 10\nOregon: 1\nPennsylvania: 5\nRhode Island: 1\nSouth Carolina: 1\nTexas: 7\nUtah: 5\nVermont: 2\nVirginia: 5\nWashington: 19\nWisconsin: 1\n\nTotal suspected cases under investigation: 199\n\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[5]\nDate: 16 Apr 2003\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: Health Canada [edited]\n<http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/english/protection/warnings/sars/update32.html>\n\n\nUpdate 32: Severe acute respiratory syndrome -- 16 Apr 2003 4:30 PM\n\nAs of 16 Apr 2003, Health Canada has received reports of 303 probable or\nsuspect cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Canada. There\nhave been 13 deaths in Canada. To date, transmission has been limited to\nspecific transmission settings such as households, hospitals, and specific\ncommunity settings. The information contained in this update is based on\nthe information available to Health Canada at this time.\n\nThe details of the cases to date are as follows:\n\nOntario is reporting 122 probable and 127 suspect cases. All cases have\noccurred in persons who have traveled to Asia or had contact with SARS\ncases in the household or in a health-care setting.\nBritish Columbia is reporting 4 probable and 38 suspect cases.\nNew Brunswick is reporting 2 suspect cases.\nSaskatchewan is reporting 1 suspect case.\nAlberta is reporting 5 suspect cases.\nPrince Edward Island is reporting 4 suspect cases.\n\nSo far, 91 people have been discharged from hospitals in Ontario. These\npeople were treated as suspect cases or as probable cases.\n\nThese numbers are accurate as of 1:00 PM EDST 16 Apr 2003.\n\n[These data do not mention the newswire reports of transmission within a\nreligious community related to attendance at a funeral of a probable SARS\ncase. The newswire reports have been varied, with some mentioning that\nmost of the cases had been previously reported, but according to this\nupdate there is no mention of community-based close contact, which appeared\nto be the mode of transmission in this generation of cases. More\ninformation on this observation from official sources would be appreciated.\n- Mod.MPP]\n\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[As of today's update there is a cumulative total of 3293 cases of SARS\nreported to the WHO, with 58 new cases reported in the preceding 24 hours;\na total of 159 deaths (case fatality rate of 4.8 percent) and 1548 patients\nhave recovered (47 percent). In the past 24 hours, Hong Kong has reported\n36 new cases and 5 deaths; in China there have been 14 new cases\nreported. Based on the information provided by Dr. Heymann in today's WHO\npress briefing, we expect to see the numbers of cases reported from Beijing\nto increase significantly once official reports from the military hospitals\nare received. In addition, there has been the suggestion of increased\ntransmission outside of Beijing and Guangdong. It would be interesting to\nsee a breakdown of reported cases by province to determine whether new\nareas of local transmission have been identified. For example, the lay\npress has reported cases in Inner Mongolia, suggesting local transmission,\nbut this area has not officially been added to the affected areas list --\nsee ProMED-mail posting SARS - worldwide (45): cases 20030412.0890.\n\nThere are now 199 suspected cases from 32 states in the United States. This\nrepresents an increase of 6 cases from the last report on 15 Apr\n2003. There has been mention in press releases (CDC press release 14 Apr\n2003 (accessible at:\n<http://www.cdc.gov/od/oc/media/transcripts/t030414.htm> and in many lay\npress reports) that the USA plans to change reporting practices, separating\nsuspected and probable cases using the WHO definitions. When that occurs,\nwe expect to see a marked decrease in the numbers of cases of SARS reported\non a daily basis to WHO. - Mod.MPP]\nSee Also\nSARS - worldwide (50): (cases) 20030415.0922\nSARS - worldwide (49): cases 20030414.0916\nSARS - worldwide (47): cases 20030413.0905\nSARS - worldwide (46): diagnostic test 20030413.0901\nSARS - worldwide (44): UK transmission suspected 20030412.0887\nSARS - worldwide (42): WHO historical overview 20030411.0878\nSARS - worldwide (41):overview 20030411.0876\nSARS - worldwide (38): etiology 20030410.0869\nSARS - Worldwide (34): etiology 20030408.0857\nSARS - worldwide (13): etiology 20030327.0758\nSARS - worldwide (04): etiology 20030325.0737\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - worldwide (17) 20030322.0713\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - Worldwide: alert (03) 20030316.0660\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - Worldwide (02):alert 20030315.0649\nSevere Acute Respiratory Syndrome - Worldwide 20030315.0637\nAcute respiratory syndrome - Canada (Ontario) 20030314.0631\nAcute respiratory syndrome - East Asia 20030314.0630\nAcute respiratory syndrome - China (HK), VietNam (03) 20030313.0624\nUndiagnosed illness - Vietnam (Hanoi): RFI 20030311.0595\nPneumonia - China (Guangdong) (07) 20030221.0452\nPneumonia - China (Guangdong): RFI 20030210.0357\n.................................mpp/pg/dk\n\n*##########################################################*\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.

Then as it spreads out from those workers into other\npopulations, the ages change, so it's very important to understand the\ndynamics of this disease.\n\nAs far as Beijing goes, last evening they visited the military hospital.\nThey estimated that there are at least 50 patients in this hospital with\nSARS from what they've seen. They also estimate that there are between\n100-200 probable cases in Beijing, more than has been reported, and they\nfeel that there might even be up to 1000 people who are under observation\nright now at various stages of infection; some probably are not SARS, in\nfact many are probably not SARS, but they are taking precautions in\nobserving these. It's our impression that China needs to get clear on how\nit reports these diseases and they are working very closely with the\nChinese to get better reporting. It's also the team's feeling that Beijing\nhas many resources that they can put to work on this disease and that SARS\nwill not be a problem in Beijing if they get these resources working. Their\nconcern is in the provinces, especially in the western provinces, and they\nare afraid that it will not only spread from cities into the communities\nbut into areas where there may not be health facilities that are very\nclosely accessible to people. So, the challenge now is for China to not\nonly report, but to trace infection, to do infection control in the\nhospitals, and do everything that the other countries are doing to stop the\nspread of this disease.\n\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[2]\nDate: 16 Apr 2003\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: Hong Kong - Department of Health [edited]\n<http://www.info.gov.hk/dh/new/index.htm>\n\n\nSituation report on atypical pneumonia 16 Apr 2003\n\nThe following is jointly issued by the Department of Health and the\nHospital Authority:\n\nAs of 3 PM 16 Apr 2003, there are an additional 36 patients confirmed to\nhave atypical pneumonia following admission to public hospitals earlier.\nThey include 7 healthcare workers (6 from Princess Margaret Hospital and\none from Pamela Youde Nethersole Eastern Hospital). The remaining 29 were\nother patients and contacts of patients with atypical pneumonia.\n\nA total of 257 patients have recovered from atypical pneumonia and have\nbeen discharged from public hospitals. Of them, 14 were discharged\ntoday. 122 patients are receiving treatment in intensive care unit.\n\n5 patients died in hospitals, bringing to 61 the total number of deaths\nrelating to atypical pneumonia. A 54-year-old female and a 73-year-old\nmale, both with a history of chronic disease, died in Queen Elizabeth\nHospital. A 44-year-old male and a 62-year-old female died in Princess\nMargaret Hospital. Another chronically ill male patient, aged 73, died in\nAlice Ho Miu Ling Nethersole Hospital.\n\nThe cumulative figure for patients who have been admitted to public\nhospitals with atypical pneumonia since 12 Mar 2003 is as follows:\n\nCumulative no. cases/ no. recovered/ no. deaths\nHealth care workers of Hospitals/Clinics and medical students: 298/ 100/ 61\nPatients, family members & visitors: 970/ 157/ 0\nTotal: 1268/ 257 /61\n\n* Most of the deaths occurred in individuals who have a history of\nchronic diseases or were patients who sought treatment at a relatively late\nstage of infection.\n\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[3]\nDate: 16 Apr 2003\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: Singapore - Ministry of Health 16 Apr 2003 [edited]\n<http://app.moh.gov.sg/sar/sar0301.asp?id=1&mid=6180>\n\n\nSARS Situation Update 16 Apr 2003\n\nAs of 16 Apr 2003, 6 additional SARS patients have been discharged,\nbringing the total number of patients who have recovered from SARS to 91.\n61 SARS patients remain hospitalised.\n\nThere are 5 additional SARS cases reported today. They comprise 2 staff\nmembers of National Cancer Centre (NCC), namely a radiographer who had been\nadmitted to Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH) since 9 Apr 2003 for observation,\nand a porter who was admitted to TTSH on 14 Apr 2003. Both patients\ndeveloped lung changes on chest X-ray yesterday and hence were diagnosed to\nhave SARS. The third SARS case is an inpatient at Singapore General\nHospital (SGH) Ward 58 who has been observed in TTSH since 13 Apr 2003, and\nwho developed lung changes yesterday. The other 2 cases comprise the son of\na SARS patient, and a doctor at National University Hospital (NUH) who\nlooked after 2 patients prior to their diagnosis of SARS.\n\nSituation Update at NCC\nThere are 2 NCC staff members who have been diagnosed as probable SARS.\n\nThe radiographer developed a fever (37.8 deg C) on Saturday 5 Apr 2003. He\ndid not see a doctor. He was well with no fever over the next 3 days (6--8\nApr 2003). He worked in the radiology department of NCC on 7 and 8 Apr\n2003. Twice-daily temperature monitoring was performed and he was noted to\nhave no fever. During these 2 days, he performed CT scans and MRI on a\ntotal of 11 patients.\n\nIn the early hours of 9 Apr 2003, he developed fever of 38.4 deg C. He went\nto Changi General Hospital (CGH) and was transferred to TTSH on the same\nday. On admission he was classified as a low-risk suspect for SARS. CGH\nobserved all the infection control measures when the patient was there.\n\nAnother hospital staff (porter), who handles dispatch work, developed a\nlow-grade fever (37.5 deg C) on the morning of Thu 10 Apr 2003. He was not\nassigned any duties and during that time he only came into contact with the\ndepartmental staff. At noon, his temperature went up to 38.6 deg C. He was\nseen at the SGH Staff Clinic and was given 2 days MC [medical leave?] and\nasked to return for a review on 12 Apr 2003.\n\nHe had no fever on 11 Apr 2003. He did not return to the Staff Clinic on 12\nApr 2003 and instead saw his neighbourhood General Practitioner (GP). He\nwas given 2 more days MC. He continued to have low-grade [fever]. On 14 Apr\n2003, he went directly to the Staff Clinic and was referred to TTSH and\nadmitted on the same day.\n\nBesides these 2 staff members, the other NCC staff are currently well. As a\nprecaution, NCC has closed its radiology department until 20 Apr 2003.\nUrgent radiological x-rays will be done at SGH A&E Dept. Non-urgent\nappointments will be deferred. NCC has contacted 10 of the 11 patients who\nhad X-ray investigations done by the radiographer and they are well.\nAlthough the radiographer did not go into the waiting room of the X-ray\ndepartment, as a precaution, NCC has been contacting the 200 patients who\nhave had other X-rays done during the period 7--9 Apr 2003. Investigations\nare still in progress to trace the source of infection.\n\nSituation Update at NUH\nThe doctor attended to a patient who was being treated for heart failure.\nThe patient, who was admitted to NUH on 8 Apr 2003, had been a visitor at\nSGH Ward 57 in end March. He had multiple medical conditions and did not\nhave fever at that time. When he was reviewed in the ward, the possibility\nof concurrent pneumonia was recognised as his condition had deteriorated.\nThe patient was unstable and required transfer to the NUH Intensive Care\nUnit where he was intubated. The transfer to TTSH took place later on the\nsame day when the patient's condition stabilised. The patient passed away\non 12 Apr 2003.\n\nThe NUH doctor developed fever on 11 Apr 2003 evening and was sent to TTSH\nEmergency Department on the same day. She has been diagnosed as a probable\nSARS case on 16 Apr 2003.\n\nHome Quarantine for non-SARS patients with chronic conditions discharged\nfrom SGH and TTSH\nContact tracing at SGH has identified the patients and healthcare workers\nwho may have been exposed to SARS. These contacts have been quarantined or\nare being monitored. There are about 800 inpatients at present in SGH who\nhave not been exposed. However, as a precaution, patients discharged from\nSGH from 17 Apr 2003 onwards who have chronic co-morbid conditions will be\nissued Home Quarantine Orders (HQO) for 10 days. At end of 10 days, SGH\nwill recall them for review, following which they will be on phone\nsurveillance for a further 10 days. The other discharged patients who do\nnot have any chronic conditions will not be on HQO but phone surveillance\nfor 21 days. The same arrangement will be implemented for non-SARS patients\nwith chronic conditions discharged from TTSH.\n\nSummary of SARS cases\nThere was a SARS patient in intensive care who died late 15 Apr 2003. She\nwas the mother of a doctor who contracted SARS while looking after a SARS\npatient. The other deceased is the mother of a SARS patient. On 13 Apr\n2003, we reported 2 SARS deaths linked to the SGH cluster comprising an\ninpatient and the brother of an index patient. The preliminary findings of\nboth patients were that they died of other medical conditions unrelated to\nSARS. We are awaiting results of further investigations.\n\nBelow is the summary of the SARS cases to date:\n\nNumber Discharged: 85 plus 6\nHospitalised: 61 (including 16 in intensive care)\nDeaths: 13 + 2 (pending post mortem findings)\n\nTotal: 167\n\nSuspected: 91 (including 8 children below 18)\nUnder home quarantine orders: 582\n\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[4]\nDate: 16 Apr 2003\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: CDC SARS website 16 Apr 2003 [edited]\n<http://www.cdc.gov/od/oc/media/sars.htm>\n\n\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome report of suspected cases under\ninvestigation in the United States\n\nThese data were reported to the World Health Organization on 15 Apr 2003.\n\nState: suspected cases under investigation\n\nAlabama: 1\nCalifornia: 42\nColorado: 6\nConnecticut: 4\nFlorida: 11\nGeorgia: 3\nHawaii: 5\nIllinois: 11\nIndiana: 1\nKansas: 1\nKentucky: 1\nMaine: 2\nMassachusetts: 8\nMichigan: 3\nMinnesota: 6\nMississippi: 1\nMissouri: 2\nNevada: 1\nNew Hampshire: 1\nNew Jersey: 3\nNew Mexico: 1\nNew York: 22\nNorth Carolina: 6\nOhio: 10\nOregon: 1\nPennsylvania: 5\nRhode Island: 1\nSouth Carolina: 1\nTexas: 7\nUtah: 5\nVermont: 2\nVirginia: 5\nWashington: 19\nWisconsin: 1\n\nTotal suspected cases under investigation: 199\n\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[5]\nDate: 16 Apr 2003\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: Health Canada [edited]\n<http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/english/protection/warnings/sars/update32.html>\n\n\nUpdate 32: Severe acute respiratory syndrome -- 16 Apr 2003 4:30 PM\n\nAs of 16 Apr 2003, Health Canada has received reports of 303 probable or\nsuspect cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Canada. There\nhave been 13 deaths in Canada. To date, transmission has been limited to\nspecific transmission settings such as households, hospitals, and specific\ncommunity settings. The information contained in this update is based on\nthe information available to Health Canada at this time.\n\nThe details of the cases to date are as follows:\n\nOntario is reporting 122 probable and 127 suspect cases. All cases have\noccurred in persons who have traveled to Asia or had contact with SARS\ncases in the household or in a health-care setting.\nBritish Columbia is reporting 4 probable and 38 suspect cases.\nNew Brunswick is reporting 2 suspect cases.\nSaskatchewan is reporting 1 suspect case.\nAlberta is reporting 5 suspect cases.\nPrince Edward Island is reporting 4 suspect cases.\n\nSo far, 91 people have been discharged from hospitals in Ontario. These\npeople were treated as suspect cases or as probable cases.\n\nThese numbers are accurate as of 1:00 PM EDST 16 Apr 2003.\n\n[These data do not mention the newswire reports of transmission within a\nreligious community related to attendance at a funeral of a probable SARS\ncase. The newswire reports have been varied, with some mentioning that\nmost of the cases had been previously reported, but according to this\nupdate there is no mention of community-based close contact, which appeared\nto be the mode of transmission in this generation of cases. More\ninformation on this observation from official sources would be appreciated.\n- Mod.MPP]\n\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[As of today's update there is a cumulative total of 3293 cases of SARS\nreported to the WHO, with 58 new cases reported in the preceding 24 hours;\na total of 159 deaths (case fatality rate of 4.8 percent) and 1548 patients\nhave recovered (47 percent). In the past 24 hours, Hong Kong has reported\n36 new cases and 5 deaths; in China there have been 14 new cases\nreported. Based on the information provided by Dr. Heymann in today's WHO\npress briefing, we expect to see the numbers of cases reported from Beijing\nto increase significantly once official reports from the military hospitals\nare received. In addition, there has been the suggestion of increased\ntransmission outside of Beijing and Guangdong. It would be interesting to\nsee a breakdown of reported cases by province to determine whether new\nareas of local transmission have been identified. For example, the lay\npress has reported cases in Inner Mongolia, suggesting local transmission,\nbut this area has not officially been added to the affected areas list --\nsee ProMED-mail posting SARS - worldwide (45): cases 20030412.0890.\n\nThere are now 199 suspected cases from 32 states in the United States. This\nrepresents an increase of 6 cases from the last report on 15 Apr\n2003. There has been mention in press releases (CDC press release 14 Apr\n2003 (accessible at:\n<http://www.cdc.gov/od/oc/media/transcripts/t030414.htm> and in many lay\npress reports) that the USA plans to change reporting practices, separating\nsuspected and probable cases using the WHO definitions. When that occurs,\nwe expect to see a marked decrease in the numbers of cases of SARS reported\non a daily basis to WHO. - Mod.MPP]\nSee Also\nSARS - worldwide (50): (cases) 20030415.0922\nSARS - worldwide (49): cases 20030414.0916\nSARS - worldwide (47): cases 20030413.0905\nSARS - worldwide (46): diagnostic test 20030413.0901\nSARS - worldwide (44): UK transmission suspected 20030412.0887\nSARS - worldwide (42): WHO historical overview 20030411.0878\nSARS - worldwide (41):overview 20030411.0876\nSARS - worldwide (38): etiology 20030410.0869\nSARS - Worldwide (34): etiology 20030408.0857\nSARS - worldwide (13): etiology 20030327.0758\nSARS - worldwide (04): etiology 20030325.0737\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - worldwide (17) 20030322.0713\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - Worldwide: alert (03) 20030316.0660\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - Worldwide (02):alert 20030315.0649\nSevere Acute Respiratory Syndrome - Worldwide 20030315.0637\nAcute respiratory syndrome - Canada (Ontario) 20030314.0631\nAcute respiratory syndrome - East Asia 20030314.0630\nAcute respiratory syndrome - China (HK), VietNam (03) 20030313.0624\nUndiagnosed illness - Vietnam (Hanoi): RFI 20030311.0595\nPneumonia - China (Guangdong) (07) 20030221.0452\nPneumonia - China (Guangdong): RFI 20030210.0357\n.................................mpp/pg/dk\n\n*##########################################################*\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.

Then as it spreads out from those workers into other\npopulations, the ages change, so it's very important to understand the\ndynamics of this disease.\n\nAs far as Beijing goes, last evening they visited the military hospital.\nThey estimated that there are at least 50 patients in this hospital with\nSARS from what they've seen. They also estimate that there are between\n100-200 probable cases in Beijing, more than has been reported, and they\nfeel that there might even be up to 1000 people who are under observation\nright now at various stages of infection; some probably are not SARS, in\nfact many are probably not SARS, but they are taking precautions in\nobserving these. It's our impression that China needs to get clear on how\nit reports these diseases and they are working very closely with the\nChinese to get better reporting. It's also the team's feeling that Beijing\nhas many resources that they can put to work on this disease and that SARS\nwill not be a problem in Beijing if they get these resources working. Their\nconcern is in the provinces, especially in the western provinces, and they\nare afraid that it will not only spread from cities into the communities\nbut into areas where there may not be health facilities that are very\nclosely accessible to people. So, the challenge now is for China to not\nonly report, but to trace infection, to do infection control in the\nhospitals, and do everything that the other countries are doing to stop the\nspread of this disease.\n\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[2]\nDate: 16 Apr 2003\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: Hong Kong - Department of Health [edited]\n<http://www.info.gov.hk/dh/new/index.htm>\n\n\nSituation report on atypical pneumonia 16 Apr 2003\n\nThe following is jointly issued by the Department of Health and the\nHospital Authority:\n\nAs of 3 PM 16 Apr 2003, there are an additional 36 patients confirmed to\nhave atypical pneumonia following admission to public hospitals earlier.\nThey include 7 healthcare workers (6 from Princess Margaret Hospital and\none from Pamela Youde Nethersole Eastern Hospital). The remaining 29 were\nother patients and contacts of patients with atypical pneumonia.\n\nA total of 257 patients have recovered from atypical pneumonia and have\nbeen discharged from public hospitals. Of them, 14 were discharged\ntoday. 122 patients are receiving treatment in intensive care unit.\n\n5 patients died in hospitals, bringing to 61 the total number of deaths\nrelating to atypical pneumonia. A 54-year-old female and a 73-year-old\nmale, both with a history of chronic disease, died in Queen Elizabeth\nHospital. A 44-year-old male and a 62-year-old female died in Princess\nMargaret Hospital. Another chronically ill male patient, aged 73, died in\nAlice Ho Miu Ling Nethersole Hospital.\n\nThe cumulative figure for patients who have been admitted to public\nhospitals with atypical pneumonia since 12 Mar 2003 is as follows:\n\nCumulative no. cases/ no. recovered/ no. deaths\nHealth care workers of Hospitals/Clinics and medical students: 298/ 100/ 61\nPatients, family members & visitors: 970/ 157/ 0\nTotal: 1268/ 257 /61\n\n* Most of the deaths occurred in individuals who have a history of\nchronic diseases or were patients who sought treatment at a relatively late\nstage of infection.\n\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[3]\nDate: 16 Apr 2003\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: Singapore - Ministry of Health 16 Apr 2003 [edited]\n<http://app.moh.gov.sg/sar/sar0301.asp?id=1&mid=6180>\n\n\nSARS Situation Update 16 Apr 2003\n\nAs of 16 Apr 2003, 6 additional SARS patients have been discharged,\nbringing the total number of patients who have recovered from SARS to 91.\n61 SARS patients remain hospitalised.\n\nThere are 5 additional SARS cases reported today. They comprise 2 staff\nmembers of National Cancer Centre (NCC), namely a radiographer who had been\nadmitted to Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH) since 9 Apr 2003 for observation,\nand a porter who was admitted to TTSH on 14 Apr 2003. Both patients\ndeveloped lung changes on chest X-ray yesterday and hence were diagnosed to\nhave SARS. The third SARS case is an inpatient at Singapore General\nHospital (SGH) Ward 58 who has been observed in TTSH since 13 Apr 2003, and\nwho developed lung changes yesterday. The other 2 cases comprise the son of\na SARS patient, and a doctor at National University Hospital (NUH) who\nlooked after 2 patients prior to their diagnosis of SARS.\n\nSituation Update at NCC\nThere are 2 NCC staff members who have been diagnosed as probable SARS.\n\nThe radiographer developed a fever (37.8 deg C) on Saturday 5 Apr 2003. He\ndid not see a doctor. He was well with no fever over the next 3 days (6--8\nApr 2003). He worked in the radiology department of NCC on 7 and 8 Apr\n2003. Twice-daily temperature monitoring was performed and he was noted to\nhave no fever. During these 2 days, he performed CT scans and MRI on a\ntotal of 11 patients.\n\nIn the early hours of 9 Apr 2003, he developed fever of 38.4 deg C. He went\nto Changi General Hospital (CGH) and was transferred to TTSH on the same\nday. On admission he was classified as a low-risk suspect for SARS. CGH\nobserved all the infection control measures when the patient was there.\n\nAnother hospital staff (porter), who handles dispatch work, developed a\nlow-grade fever (37.5 deg C) on the morning of Thu 10 Apr 2003. He was not\nassigned any duties and during that time he only came into contact with the\ndepartmental staff. At noon, his temperature went up to 38.6 deg C. He was\nseen at the SGH Staff Clinic and was given 2 days MC [medical leave?] and\nasked to return for a review on 12 Apr 2003.\n\nHe had no fever on 11 Apr 2003. He did not return to the Staff Clinic on 12\nApr 2003 and instead saw his neighbourhood General Practitioner (GP). He\nwas given 2 more days MC. He continued to have low-grade [fever]. On 14 Apr\n2003, he went directly to the Staff Clinic and was referred to TTSH and\nadmitted on the same day.\n\nBesides these 2 staff members, the other NCC staff are currently well. As a\nprecaution, NCC has closed its radiology department until 20 Apr 2003.\nUrgent radiological x-rays will be done at SGH A&E Dept. Non-urgent\nappointments will be deferred. NCC has contacted 10 of the 11 patients who\nhad X-ray investigations done by the radiographer and they are well.\nAlthough the radiographer did not go into the waiting room of the X-ray\ndepartment, as a precaution, NCC has been contacting the 200 patients who\nhave had other X-rays done during the period 7--9 Apr 2003. Investigations\nare still in progress to trace the source of infection.\n\nSituation Update at NUH\nThe doctor attended to a patient who was being treated for heart failure.\nThe patient, who was admitted to NUH on 8 Apr 2003, had been a visitor at\nSGH Ward 57 in end March. He had multiple medical conditions and did not\nhave fever at that time. When he was reviewed in the ward, the possibility\nof concurrent pneumonia was recognised as his condition had deteriorated.\nThe patient was unstable and required transfer to the NUH Intensive Care\nUnit where he was intubated. The transfer to TTSH took place later on the\nsame day when the patient's condition stabilised. The patient passed away\non 12 Apr 2003.\n\nThe NUH doctor developed fever on 11 Apr 2003 evening and was sent to TTSH\nEmergency Department on the same day. She has been diagnosed as a probable\nSARS case on 16 Apr 2003.\n\nHome Quarantine for non-SARS patients with chronic conditions discharged\nfrom SGH and TTSH\nContact tracing at SGH has identified the patients and healthcare workers\nwho may have been exposed to SARS. These contacts have been quarantined or\nare being monitored. There are about 800 inpatients at present in SGH who\nhave not been exposed. However, as a precaution, patients discharged from\nSGH from 17 Apr 2003 onwards who have chronic co-morbid conditions will be\nissued Home Quarantine Orders (HQO) for 10 days. At end of 10 days, SGH\nwill recall them for review, following which they will be on phone\nsurveillance for a further 10 days. The other discharged patients who do\nnot have any chronic conditions will not be on HQO but phone surveillance\nfor 21 days. The same arrangement will be implemented for non-SARS patients\nwith chronic conditions discharged from TTSH.\n\nSummary of SARS cases\nThere was a SARS patient in intensive care who died late 15 Apr 2003. She\nwas the mother of a doctor who contracted SARS while looking after a SARS\npatient. The other deceased is the mother of a SARS patient. On 13 Apr\n2003, we reported 2 SARS deaths linked to the SGH cluster comprising an\ninpatient and the brother of an index patient. The preliminary findings of\nboth patients were that they died of other medical conditions unrelated to\nSARS. We are awaiting results of further investigations.\n\nBelow is the summary of the SARS cases to date:\n\nNumber Discharged: 85 plus 6\nHospitalised: 61 (including 16 in intensive care)\nDeaths: 13 + 2 (pending post mortem findings)\n\nTotal: 167\n\nSuspected: 91 (including 8 children below 18)\nUnder home quarantine orders: 582\n\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[4]\nDate: 16 Apr 2003\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: CDC SARS website 16 Apr 2003 [edited]\n<http://www.cdc.gov/od/oc/media/sars.htm>\n\n\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome report of suspected cases under\ninvestigation in the United States\n\nThese data were reported to the World Health Organization on 15 Apr 2003.\n\nState: suspected cases under investigation\n\nAlabama: 1\nCalifornia: 42\nColorado: 6\nConnecticut: 4\nFlorida: 11\nGeorgia: 3\nHawaii: 5\nIllinois: 11\nIndiana: 1\nKansas: 1\nKentucky: 1\nMaine: 2\nMassachusetts: 8\nMichigan: 3\nMinnesota: 6\nMississippi: 1\nMissouri: 2\nNevada: 1\nNew Hampshire: 1\nNew Jersey: 3\nNew Mexico: 1\nNew York: 22\nNorth Carolina: 6\nOhio: 10\nOregon: 1\nPennsylvania: 5\nRhode Island: 1\nSouth Carolina: 1\nTexas: 7\nUtah: 5\nVermont: 2\nVirginia: 5\nWashington: 19\nWisconsin: 1\n\nTotal suspected cases under investigation: 199\n\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[5]\nDate: 16 Apr 2003\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: Health Canada [edited]\n<http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/english/protection/warnings/sars/update32.html>\n\n\nUpdate 32: Severe acute respiratory syndrome -- 16 Apr 2003 4:30 PM\n\nAs of 16 Apr 2003, Health Canada has received reports of 303 probable or\nsuspect cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Canada. There\nhave been 13 deaths in Canada. To date, transmission has been limited to\nspecific transmission settings such as households, hospitals, and specific\ncommunity settings. The information contained in this update is based on\nthe information available to Health Canada at this time.\n\nThe details of the cases to date are as follows:\n\nOntario is reporting 122 probable and 127 suspect cases. All cases have\noccurred in persons who have traveled to Asia or had contact with SARS\ncases in the household or in a health-care setting.\nBritish Columbia is reporting 4 probable and 38 suspect cases.\nNew Brunswick is reporting 2 suspect cases.\nSaskatchewan is reporting 1 suspect case.\nAlberta is reporting 5 suspect cases.\nPrince Edward Island is reporting 4 suspect cases.\n\nSo far, 91 people have been discharged from hospitals in Ontario. These\npeople were treated as suspect cases or as probable cases.\n\nThese numbers are accurate as of 1:00 PM EDST 16 Apr 2003.\n\n[These data do not mention the newswire reports of transmission within a\nreligious community related to attendance at a funeral of a probable SARS\ncase. The newswire reports have been varied, with some mentioning that\nmost of the cases had been previously reported, but according to this\nupdate there is no mention of community-based close contact, which appeared\nto be the mode of transmission in this generation of cases. More\ninformation on this observation from official sources would be appreciated.\n- Mod.MPP]\n\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[As of today's update there is a cumulative total of 3293 cases of SARS\nreported to the WHO, with 58 new cases reported in the preceding 24 hours;\na total of 159 deaths (case fatality rate of 4.8 percent) and 1548 patients\nhave recovered (47 percent). In the past 24 hours, Hong Kong has reported\n36 new cases and 5 deaths; in China there have been 14 new cases\nreported. Based on the information provided by Dr. Heymann in today's WHO\npress briefing, we expect to see the numbers of cases reported from Beijing\nto increase significantly once official reports from the military hospitals\nare received. In addition, there has been the suggestion of increased\ntransmission outside of Beijing and Guangdong. It would be interesting to\nsee a breakdown of reported cases by province to determine whether new\nareas of local transmission have been identified. For example, the lay\npress has reported cases in Inner Mongolia, suggesting local transmission,\nbut this area has not officially been added to the affected areas list --\nsee ProMED-mail posting SARS - worldwide (45): cases 20030412.0890.\n\nThere are now 199 suspected cases from 32 states in the United States. This\nrepresents an increase of 6 cases from the last report on 15 Apr\n2003. There has been mention in press releases (CDC press release 14 Apr\n2003 (accessible at:\n<http://www.cdc.gov/od/oc/media/transcripts/t030414.htm> and in many lay\npress reports) that the USA plans to change reporting practices, separating\nsuspected and probable cases using the WHO definitions. When that occurs,\nwe expect to see a marked decrease in the numbers of cases of SARS reported\non a daily basis to WHO. - Mod.MPP]\nSee Also\nSARS - worldwide (50): (cases) 20030415.0922\nSARS - worldwide (49): cases 20030414.0916\nSARS - worldwide (47): cases 20030413.0905\nSARS - worldwide (46): diagnostic test 20030413.0901\nSARS - worldwide (44): UK transmission suspected 20030412.0887\nSARS - worldwide (42): WHO historical overview 20030411.0878\nSARS - worldwide (41):overview 20030411.0876\nSARS - worldwide (38): etiology 20030410.0869\nSARS - Worldwide (34): etiology 20030408.0857\nSARS - worldwide (13): etiology 20030327.0758\nSARS - worldwide (04): etiology 20030325.0737\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - worldwide (17) 20030322.0713\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - Worldwide: alert (03) 20030316.0660\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - Worldwide (02):alert 20030315.0649\nSevere Acute Respiratory Syndrome - Worldwide 20030315.0637\nAcute respiratory syndrome - Canada (Ontario) 20030314.0631\nAcute respiratory syndrome - East Asia 20030314.0630\nAcute respiratory syndrome - China (HK), VietNam (03) 20030313.0624\nUndiagnosed illness - Vietnam (Hanoi): RFI 20030311.0595\nPneumonia - China (Guangdong) (07) 20030221.0452\nPneumonia - China (Guangdong): RFI 20030210.0357\n.................................mpp/pg/dk\n\n*##########################################################*\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.

Then as it spreads out from those workers into other\npopulations, the ages change, so it's very important to understand the\ndynamics of this disease.\n\nAs far as Beijing goes, last evening they visited the military hospital.\nThey estimated that there are at least 50 patients in this hospital with\nSARS from what they've seen. They also estimate that there are between\n100-200 probable cases in Beijing, more than has been reported, and they\nfeel that there might even be up to 1000 people who are under observation\nright now at various stages of infection; some probably are not SARS, in\nfact many are probably not SARS, but they are taking precautions in\nobserving these. It's our impression that China needs to get clear on how\nit reports these diseases and they are working very closely with the\nChinese to get better reporting. It's also the team's feeling that Beijing\nhas many resources that they can put to work on this disease and that SARS\nwill not be a problem in Beijing if they get these resources working. Their\nconcern is in the provinces, especially in the western provinces, and they\nare afraid that it will not only spread from cities into the communities\nbut into areas where there may not be health facilities that are very\nclosely accessible to people. So, the challenge now is for China to not\nonly report, but to trace infection, to do infection control in the\nhospitals, and do everything that the other countries are doing to stop the\nspread of this disease.\n\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[2]\nDate: 16 Apr 2003\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: Hong Kong - Department of Health [edited]\n<http://www.info.gov.hk/dh/new/index.htm>\n\n\nSituation report on atypical pneumonia 16 Apr 2003\n\nThe following is jointly issued by the Department of Health and the\nHospital Authority:\n\nAs of 3 PM 16 Apr 2003, there are an additional 36 patients confirmed to\nhave atypical pneumonia following admission to public hospitals earlier.\nThey include 7 healthcare workers (6 from Princess Margaret Hospital and\none from Pamela Youde Nethersole Eastern Hospital). The remaining 29 were\nother patients and contacts of patients with atypical pneumonia.\n\nA total of 257 patients have recovered from atypical pneumonia and have\nbeen discharged from public hospitals. Of them, 14 were discharged\ntoday. 122 patients are receiving treatment in intensive care unit.\n\n5 patients died in hospitals, bringing to 61 the total number of deaths\nrelating to atypical pneumonia. A 54-year-old female and a 73-year-old\nmale, both with a history of chronic disease, died in Queen Elizabeth\nHospital. A 44-year-old male and a 62-year-old female died in Princess\nMargaret Hospital. Another chronically ill male patient, aged 73, died in\nAlice Ho Miu Ling Nethersole Hospital.\n\nThe cumulative figure for patients who have been admitted to public\nhospitals with atypical pneumonia since 12 Mar 2003 is as follows:\n\nCumulative no. cases/ no. recovered/ no. deaths\nHealth care workers of Hospitals/Clinics and medical students: 298/ 100/ 61\nPatients, family members & visitors: 970/ 157/ 0\nTotal: 1268/ 257 /61\n\n* Most of the deaths occurred in individuals who have a history of\nchronic diseases or were patients who sought treatment at a relatively late\nstage of infection.\n\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[3]\nDate: 16 Apr 2003\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: Singapore - Ministry of Health 16 Apr 2003 [edited]\n<http://app.moh.gov.sg/sar/sar0301.asp?id=1&mid=6180>\n\n\nSARS Situation Update 16 Apr 2003\n\nAs of 16 Apr 2003, 6 additional SARS patients have been discharged,\nbringing the total number of patients who have recovered from SARS to 91.\n61 SARS patients remain hospitalised.\n\nThere are 5 additional SARS cases reported today. They comprise 2 staff\nmembers of National Cancer Centre (NCC), namely a radiographer who had been\nadmitted to Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH) since 9 Apr 2003 for observation,\nand a porter who was admitted to TTSH on 14 Apr 2003. Both patients\ndeveloped lung changes on chest X-ray yesterday and hence were diagnosed to\nhave SARS. The third SARS case is an inpatient at Singapore General\nHospital (SGH) Ward 58 who has been observed in TTSH since 13 Apr 2003, and\nwho developed lung changes yesterday. The other 2 cases comprise the son of\na SARS patient, and a doctor at National University Hospital (NUH) who\nlooked after 2 patients prior to their diagnosis of SARS.\n\nSituation Update at NCC\nThere are 2 NCC staff members who have been diagnosed as probable SARS.\n\nThe radiographer developed a fever (37.8 deg C) on Saturday 5 Apr 2003. He\ndid not see a doctor. He was well with no fever over the next 3 days (6--8\nApr 2003). He worked in the radiology department of NCC on 7 and 8 Apr\n2003. Twice-daily temperature monitoring was performed and he was noted to\nhave no fever. During these 2 days, he performed CT scans and MRI on a\ntotal of 11 patients.\n\nIn the early hours of 9 Apr 2003, he developed fever of 38.4 deg C. He went\nto Changi General Hospital (CGH) and was transferred to TTSH on the same\nday. On admission he was classified as a low-risk suspect for SARS. CGH\nobserved all the infection control measures when the patient was there.\n\nAnother hospital staff (porter), who handles dispatch work, developed a\nlow-grade fever (37.5 deg C) on the morning of Thu 10 Apr 2003. He was not\nassigned any duties and during that time he only came into contact with the\ndepartmental staff. At noon, his temperature went up to 38.6 deg C. He was\nseen at the SGH Staff Clinic and was given 2 days MC [medical leave?] and\nasked to return for a review on 12 Apr 2003.\n\nHe had no fever on 11 Apr 2003. He did not return to the Staff Clinic on 12\nApr 2003 and instead saw his neighbourhood General Practitioner (GP). He\nwas given 2 more days MC. He continued to have low-grade [fever]. On 14 Apr\n2003, he went directly to the Staff Clinic and was referred to TTSH and\nadmitted on the same day.\n\nBesides these 2 staff members, the other NCC staff are currently well. As a\nprecaution, NCC has closed its radiology department until 20 Apr 2003.\nUrgent radiological x-rays will be done at SGH A&E Dept. Non-urgent\nappointments will be deferred. NCC has contacted 10 of the 11 patients who\nhad X-ray investigations done by the radiographer and they are well.\nAlthough the radiographer did not go into the waiting room of the X-ray\ndepartment, as a precaution, NCC has been contacting the 200 patients who\nhave had other X-rays done during the period 7--9 Apr 2003. Investigations\nare still in progress to trace the source of infection.\n\nSituation Update at NUH\nThe doctor attended to a patient who was being treated for heart failure.\nThe patient, who was admitted to NUH on 8 Apr 2003, had been a visitor at\nSGH Ward 57 in end March. He had multiple medical conditions and did not\nhave fever at that time. When he was reviewed in the ward, the possibility\nof concurrent pneumonia was recognised as his condition had deteriorated.\nThe patient was unstable and required transfer to the NUH Intensive Care\nUnit where he was intubated. The transfer to TTSH took place later on the\nsame day when the patient's condition stabilised. The patient passed away\non 12 Apr 2003.\n\nThe NUH doctor developed fever on 11 Apr 2003 evening and was sent to TTSH\nEmergency Department on the same day. She has been diagnosed as a probable\nSARS case on 16 Apr 2003.\n\nHome Quarantine for non-SARS patients with chronic conditions discharged\nfrom SGH and TTSH\nContact tracing at SGH has identified the patients and healthcare workers\nwho may have been exposed to SARS. These contacts have been quarantined or\nare being monitored. There are about 800 inpatients at present in SGH who\nhave not been exposed. However, as a precaution, patients discharged from\nSGH from 17 Apr 2003 onwards who have chronic co-morbid conditions will be\nissued Home Quarantine Orders (HQO) for 10 days. At end of 10 days, SGH\nwill recall them for review, following which they will be on phone\nsurveillance for a further 10 days. The other discharged patients who do\nnot have any chronic conditions will not be on HQO but phone surveillance\nfor 21 days. The same arrangement will be implemented for non-SARS patients\nwith chronic conditions discharged from TTSH.\n\nSummary of SARS cases\nThere was a SARS patient in intensive care who died late 15 Apr 2003. She\nwas the mother of a doctor who contracted SARS while looking after a SARS\npatient. The other deceased is the mother of a SARS patient. On 13 Apr\n2003, we reported 2 SARS deaths linked to the SGH cluster comprising an\ninpatient and the brother of an index patient. The preliminary findings of\nboth patients were that they died of other medical conditions unrelated to\nSARS. We are awaiting results of further investigations.\n\nBelow is the summary of the SARS cases to date:\n\nNumber Discharged: 85 plus 6\nHospitalised: 61 (including 16 in intensive care)\nDeaths: 13 + 2 (pending post mortem findings)\n\nTotal: 167\n\nSuspected: 91 (including 8 children below 18)\nUnder home quarantine orders: 582\n\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[4]\nDate: 16 Apr 2003\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: CDC SARS website 16 Apr 2003 [edited]\n<http://www.cdc.gov/od/oc/media/sars.htm>\n\n\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome report of suspected cases under\ninvestigation in the United States\n\nThese data were reported to the World Health Organization on 15 Apr 2003.\n\nState: suspected cases under investigation\n\nAlabama: 1\nCalifornia: 42\nColorado: 6\nConnecticut: 4\nFlorida: 11\nGeorgia: 3\nHawaii: 5\nIllinois: 11\nIndiana: 1\nKansas: 1\nKentucky: 1\nMaine: 2\nMassachusetts: 8\nMichigan: 3\nMinnesota: 6\nMississippi: 1\nMissouri: 2\nNevada: 1\nNew Hampshire: 1\nNew Jersey: 3\nNew Mexico: 1\nNew York: 22\nNorth Carolina: 6\nOhio: 10\nOregon: 1\nPennsylvania: 5\nRhode Island: 1\nSouth Carolina: 1\nTexas: 7\nUtah: 5\nVermont: 2\nVirginia: 5\nWashington: 19\nWisconsin: 1\n\nTotal suspected cases under investigation: 199\n\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[5]\nDate: 16 Apr 2003\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: Health Canada [edited]\n<http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/english/protection/warnings/sars/update32.html>\n\n\nUpdate 32: Severe acute respiratory syndrome -- 16 Apr 2003 4:30 PM\n\nAs of 16 Apr 2003, Health Canada has received reports of 303 probable or\nsuspect cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Canada. There\nhave been 13 deaths in Canada. To date, transmission has been limited to\nspecific transmission settings such as households, hospitals, and specific\ncommunity settings. The information contained in this update is based on\nthe information available to Health Canada at this time.\n\nThe details of the cases to date are as follows:\n\nOntario is reporting 122 probable and 127 suspect cases. All cases have\noccurred in persons who have traveled to Asia or had contact with SARS\ncases in the household or in a health-care setting.\nBritish Columbia is reporting 4 probable and 38 suspect cases.\nNew Brunswick is reporting 2 suspect cases.\nSaskatchewan is reporting 1 suspect case.\nAlberta is reporting 5 suspect cases.\nPrince Edward Island is reporting 4 suspect cases.\n\nSo far, 91 people have been discharged from hospitals in Ontario. These\npeople were treated as suspect cases or as probable cases.\n\nThese numbers are accurate as of 1:00 PM EDST 16 Apr 2003.\n\n[These data do not mention the newswire reports of transmission within a\nreligious community related to attendance at a funeral of a probable SARS\ncase. The newswire reports have been varied, with some mentioning that\nmost of the cases had been previously reported, but according to this\nupdate there is no mention of community-based close contact, which appeared\nto be the mode of transmission in this generation of cases. More\ninformation on this observation from official sources would be appreciated.\n- Mod.MPP]\n\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[As of today's update there is a cumulative total of 3293 cases of SARS\nreported to the WHO, with 58 new cases reported in the preceding 24 hours;\na total of 159 deaths (case fatality rate of 4.8 percent) and 1548 patients\nhave recovered (47 percent). In the past 24 hours, Hong Kong has reported\n36 new cases and 5 deaths; in China there have been 14 new cases\nreported. Based on the information provided by Dr. Heymann in today's WHO\npress briefing, we expect to see the numbers of cases reported from Beijing\nto increase significantly once official reports from the military hospitals\nare received. In addition, there has been the suggestion of increased\ntransmission outside of Beijing and Guangdong. It would be interesting to\nsee a breakdown of reported cases by province to determine whether new\nareas of local transmission have been identified. For example, the lay\npress has reported cases in Inner Mongolia, suggesting local transmission,\nbut this area has not officially been added to the affected areas list --\nsee ProMED-mail posting SARS - worldwide (45): cases 20030412.0890.\n\nThere are now 199 suspected cases from 32 states in the United States. This\nrepresents an increase of 6 cases from the last report on 15 Apr\n2003. There has been mention in press releases (CDC press release 14 Apr\n2003 (accessible at:\n<http://www.cdc.gov/od/oc/media/transcripts/t030414.htm> and in many lay\npress reports) that the USA plans to change reporting practices, separating\nsuspected and probable cases using the WHO definitions. When that occurs,\nwe expect to see a marked decrease in the numbers of cases of SARS reported\non a daily basis to WHO. - Mod.MPP]\nSee Also\nSARS - worldwide (50): (cases) 20030415.0922\nSARS - worldwide (49): cases 20030414.0916\nSARS - worldwide (47): cases 20030413.0905\nSARS - worldwide (46): diagnostic test 20030413.0901\nSARS - worldwide (44): UK transmission suspected 20030412.0887\nSARS - worldwide (42): WHO historical overview 20030411.0878\nSARS - worldwide (41):overview 20030411.0876\nSARS - worldwide (38): etiology 20030410.0869\nSARS - Worldwide (34): etiology 20030408.0857\nSARS - worldwide (13): etiology 20030327.0758\nSARS - worldwide (04): etiology 20030325.0737\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - worldwide (17) 20030322.0713\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - Worldwide: alert (03) 20030316.0660\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - Worldwide (02):alert 20030315.0649\nSevere Acute Respiratory Syndrome - Worldwide 20030315.0637\nAcute respiratory syndrome - Canada (Ontario) 20030314.0631\nAcute respiratory syndrome - East Asia 20030314.0630\nAcute respiratory syndrome - China (HK), VietNam (03) 20030313.0624\nUndiagnosed illness - Vietnam (Hanoi): RFI 20030311.0595\nPneumonia - China (Guangdong) (07) 20030221.0452\nPneumonia - China (Guangdong): RFI 20030210.0357\n.................................mpp/pg/dk\n\n*##########################################################*\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.

Then as it spreads out from those workers into other\npopulations, the ages change, so it's very important to understand the\ndynamics of this disease.\n\nAs far as Beijing goes, last evening they visited the military hospital.\nThey estimated that there are at least 50 patients in this hospital with\nSARS from what they've seen. They also estimate that there are between\n100-200 probable cases in Beijing, more than has been reported, and they\nfeel that there might even be up to 1000 people who are under observation\nright now at various stages of infection; some probably are not SARS, in\nfact many are probably not SARS, but they are taking precautions in\nobserving these. It's our impression that China needs to get clear on how\nit reports these diseases and they are working very closely with the\nChinese to get better reporting. It's also the team's feeling that Beijing\nhas many resources that they can put to work on this disease and that SARS\nwill not be a problem in Beijing if they get these resources working. Their\nconcern is in the provinces, especially in the western provinces, and they\nare afraid that it will not only spread from cities into the communities\nbut into areas where there may not be health facilities that are very\nclosely accessible to people. So, the challenge now is for China to not\nonly report, but to trace infection, to do infection control in the\nhospitals, and do everything that the other countries are doing to stop the\nspread of this disease.\n\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[2]\nDate: 16 Apr 2003\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: Hong Kong - Department of Health [edited]\n<http://www.info.gov.hk/dh/new/index.htm>\n\n\nSituation report on atypical pneumonia 16 Apr 2003\n\nThe following is jointly issued by the Department of Health and the\nHospital Authority:\n\nAs of 3 PM 16 Apr 2003, there are an additional 36 patients confirmed to\nhave atypical pneumonia following admission to public hospitals earlier.\nThey include 7 healthcare workers (6 from Princess Margaret Hospital and\none from Pamela Youde Nethersole Eastern Hospital). The remaining 29 were\nother patients and contacts of patients with atypical pneumonia.\n\nA total of 257 patients have recovered from atypical pneumonia and have\nbeen discharged from public hospitals. Of them, 14 were discharged\ntoday. 122 patients are receiving treatment in intensive care unit.\n\n5 patients died in hospitals, bringing to 61 the total number of deaths\nrelating to atypical pneumonia. A 54-year-old female and a 73-year-old\nmale, both with a history of chronic disease, died in Queen Elizabeth\nHospital. A 44-year-old male and a 62-year-old female died in Princess\nMargaret Hospital. Another chronically ill male patient, aged 73, died in\nAlice Ho Miu Ling Nethersole Hospital.\n\nThe cumulative figure for patients who have been admitted to public\nhospitals with atypical pneumonia since 12 Mar 2003 is as follows:\n\nCumulative no. cases/ no. recovered/ no. deaths\nHealth care workers of Hospitals/Clinics and medical students: 298/ 100/ 61\nPatients, family members & visitors: 970/ 157/ 0\nTotal: 1268/ 257 /61\n\n* Most of the deaths occurred in individuals who have a history of\nchronic diseases or were patients who sought treatment at a relatively late\nstage of infection.\n\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[3]\nDate: 16 Apr 2003\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: Singapore - Ministry of Health 16 Apr 2003 [edited]\n<http://app.moh.gov.sg/sar/sar0301.asp?id=1&mid=6180>\n\n\nSARS Situation Update 16 Apr 2003\n\nAs of 16 Apr 2003, 6 additional SARS patients have been discharged,\nbringing the total number of patients who have recovered from SARS to 91.\n61 SARS patients remain hospitalised.\n\nThere are 5 additional SARS cases reported today. They comprise 2 staff\nmembers of National Cancer Centre (NCC), namely a radiographer who had been\nadmitted to Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH) since 9 Apr 2003 for observation,\nand a porter who was admitted to TTSH on 14 Apr 2003. Both patients\ndeveloped lung changes on chest X-ray yesterday and hence were diagnosed to\nhave SARS. The third SARS case is an inpatient at Singapore General\nHospital (SGH) Ward 58 who has been observed in TTSH since 13 Apr 2003, and\nwho developed lung changes yesterday. The other 2 cases comprise the son of\na SARS patient, and a doctor at National University Hospital (NUH) who\nlooked after 2 patients prior to their diagnosis of SARS.\n\nSituation Update at NCC\nThere are 2 NCC staff members who have been diagnosed as probable SARS.\n\nThe radiographer developed a fever (37.8 deg C) on Saturday 5 Apr 2003. He\ndid not see a doctor. He was well with no fever over the next 3 days (6--8\nApr 2003). He worked in the radiology department of NCC on 7 and 8 Apr\n2003. Twice-daily temperature monitoring was performed and he was noted to\nhave no fever. During these 2 days, he performed CT scans and MRI on a\ntotal of 11 patients.\n\nIn the early hours of 9 Apr 2003, he developed fever of 38.4 deg C. He went\nto Changi General Hospital (CGH) and was transferred to TTSH on the same\nday. On admission he was classified as a low-risk suspect for SARS. CGH\nobserved all the infection control measures when the patient was there.\n\nAnother hospital staff (porter), who handles dispatch work, developed a\nlow-grade fever (37.5 deg C) on the morning of Thu 10 Apr 2003. He was not\nassigned any duties and during that time he only came into contact with the\ndepartmental staff. At noon, his temperature went up to 38.6 deg C. He was\nseen at the SGH Staff Clinic and was given 2 days MC [medical leave?] and\nasked to return for a review on 12 Apr 2003.\n\nHe had no fever on 11 Apr 2003. He did not return to the Staff Clinic on 12\nApr 2003 and instead saw his neighbourhood General Practitioner (GP). He\nwas given 2 more days MC. He continued to have low-grade [fever]. On 14 Apr\n2003, he went directly to the Staff Clinic and was referred to TTSH and\nadmitted on the same day.\n\nBesides these 2 staff members, the other NCC staff are currently well. As a\nprecaution, NCC has closed its radiology department until 20 Apr 2003.\nUrgent radiological x-rays will be done at SGH A&E Dept. Non-urgent\nappointments will be deferred. NCC has contacted 10 of the 11 patients who\nhad X-ray investigations done by the radiographer and they are well.\nAlthough the radiographer did not go into the waiting room of the X-ray\ndepartment, as a precaution, NCC has been contacting the 200 patients who\nhave had other X-rays done during the period 7--9 Apr 2003. Investigations\nare still in progress to trace the source of infection.\n\nSituation Update at NUH\nThe doctor attended to a patient who was being treated for heart failure.\nThe patient, who was admitted to NUH on 8 Apr 2003, had been a visitor at\nSGH Ward 57 in end March. He had multiple medical conditions and did not\nhave fever at that time. When he was reviewed in the ward, the possibility\nof concurrent pneumonia was recognised as his condition had deteriorated.\nThe patient was unstable and required transfer to the NUH Intensive Care\nUnit where he was intubated. The transfer to TTSH took place later on the\nsame day when the patient's condition stabilised. The patient passed away\non 12 Apr 2003.\n\nThe NUH doctor developed fever on 11 Apr 2003 evening and was sent to TTSH\nEmergency Department on the same day. She has been diagnosed as a probable\nSARS case on 16 Apr 2003.\n\nHome Quarantine for non-SARS patients with chronic conditions discharged\nfrom SGH and TTSH\nContact tracing at SGH has identified the patients and healthcare workers\nwho may have been exposed to SARS. These contacts have been quarantined or\nare being monitored. There are about 800 inpatients at present in SGH who\nhave not been exposed. However, as a precaution, patients discharged from\nSGH from 17 Apr 2003 onwards who have chronic co-morbid conditions will be\nissued Home Quarantine Orders (HQO) for 10 days. At end of 10 days, SGH\nwill recall them for review, following which they will be on phone\nsurveillance for a further 10 days. The other discharged patients who do\nnot have any chronic conditions will not be on HQO but phone surveillance\nfor 21 days. The same arrangement will be implemented for non-SARS patients\nwith chronic conditions discharged from TTSH.\n\nSummary of SARS cases\nThere was a SARS patient in intensive care who died late 15 Apr 2003. She\nwas the mother of a doctor who contracted SARS while looking after a SARS\npatient. The other deceased is the mother of a SARS patient. On 13 Apr\n2003, we reported 2 SARS deaths linked to the SGH cluster comprising an\ninpatient and the brother of an index patient. The preliminary findings of\nboth patients were that they died of other medical conditions unrelated to\nSARS. We are awaiting results of further investigations.\n\nBelow is the summary of the SARS cases to date:\n\nNumber Discharged: 85 plus 6\nHospitalised: 61 (including 16 in intensive care)\nDeaths: 13 + 2 (pending post mortem findings)\n\nTotal: 167\n\nSuspected: 91 (including 8 children below 18)\nUnder home quarantine orders: 582\n\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[4]\nDate: 16 Apr 2003\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: CDC SARS website 16 Apr 2003 [edited]\n<http://www.cdc.gov/od/oc/media/sars.htm>\n\n\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome report of suspected cases under\ninvestigation in the United States\n\nThese data were reported to the World Health Organization on 15 Apr 2003.\n\nState: suspected cases under investigation\n\nAlabama: 1\nCalifornia: 42\nColorado: 6\nConnecticut: 4\nFlorida: 11\nGeorgia: 3\nHawaii: 5\nIllinois: 11\nIndiana: 1\nKansas: 1\nKentucky: 1\nMaine: 2\nMassachusetts: 8\nMichigan: 3\nMinnesota: 6\nMississippi: 1\nMissouri: 2\nNevada: 1\nNew Hampshire: 1\nNew Jersey: 3\nNew Mexico: 1\nNew York: 22\nNorth Carolina: 6\nOhio: 10\nOregon: 1\nPennsylvania: 5\nRhode Island: 1\nSouth Carolina: 1\nTexas: 7\nUtah: 5\nVermont: 2\nVirginia: 5\nWashington: 19\nWisconsin: 1\n\nTotal suspected cases under investigation: 199\n\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[5]\nDate: 16 Apr 2003\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: Health Canada [edited]\n<http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/english/protection/warnings/sars/update32.html>\n\n\nUpdate 32: Severe acute respiratory syndrome -- 16 Apr 2003 4:30 PM\n\nAs of 16 Apr 2003, Health Canada has received reports of 303 probable or\nsuspect cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Canada. There\nhave been 13 deaths in Canada. To date, transmission has been limited to\nspecific transmission settings such as households, hospitals, and specific\ncommunity settings. The information contained in this update is based on\nthe information available to Health Canada at this time.\n\nThe details of the cases to date are as follows:\n\nOntario is reporting 122 probable and 127 suspect cases. All cases have\noccurred in persons who have traveled to Asia or had contact with SARS\ncases in the household or in a health-care setting.\nBritish Columbia is reporting 4 probable and 38 suspect cases.\nNew Brunswick is reporting 2 suspect cases.\nSaskatchewan is reporting 1 suspect case.\nAlberta is reporting 5 suspect cases.\nPrince Edward Island is reporting 4 suspect cases.\n\nSo far, 91 people have been discharged from hospitals in Ontario. These\npeople were treated as suspect cases or as probable cases.\n\nThese numbers are accurate as of 1:00 PM EDST 16 Apr 2003.\n\n[These data do not mention the newswire reports of transmission within a\nreligious community related to attendance at a funeral of a probable SARS\ncase. The newswire reports have been varied, with some mentioning that\nmost of the cases had been previously reported, but according to this\nupdate there is no mention of community-based close contact, which appeared\nto be the mode of transmission in this generation of cases. More\ninformation on this observation from official sources would be appreciated.\n- Mod.MPP]\n\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[As of today's update there is a cumulative total of 3293 cases of SARS\nreported to the WHO, with 58 new cases reported in the preceding 24 hours;\na total of 159 deaths (case fatality rate of 4.8 percent) and 1548 patients\nhave recovered (47 percent). In the past 24 hours, Hong Kong has reported\n36 new cases and 5 deaths; in China there have been 14 new cases\nreported. Based on the information provided by Dr. Heymann in today's WHO\npress briefing, we expect to see the numbers of cases reported from Beijing\nto increase significantly once official reports from the military hospitals\nare received. In addition, there has been the suggestion of increased\ntransmission outside of Beijing and Guangdong. It would be interesting to\nsee a breakdown of reported cases by province to determine whether new\nareas of local transmission have been identified. For example, the lay\npress has reported cases in Inner Mongolia, suggesting local transmission,\nbut this area has not officially been added to the affected areas list --\nsee ProMED-mail posting SARS - worldwide (45): cases 20030412.0890.\n\nThere are now 199 suspected cases from 32 states in the United States. This\nrepresents an increase of 6 cases from the last report on 15 Apr\n2003. There has been mention in press releases (CDC press release 14 Apr\n2003 (accessible at:\n<http://www.cdc.gov/od/oc/media/transcripts/t030414.htm> and in many lay\npress reports) that the USA plans to change reporting practices, separating\nsuspected and probable cases using the WHO definitions. When that occurs,\nwe expect to see a marked decrease in the numbers of cases of SARS reported\non a daily basis to WHO. - Mod.MPP]\nSee Also\nSARS - worldwide (50): (cases) 20030415.0922\nSARS - worldwide (49): cases 20030414.0916\nSARS - worldwide (47): cases 20030413.0905\nSARS - worldwide (46): diagnostic test 20030413.0901\nSARS - worldwide (44): UK transmission suspected 20030412.0887\nSARS - worldwide (42): WHO historical overview 20030411.0878\nSARS - worldwide (41):overview 20030411.0876\nSARS - worldwide (38): etiology 20030410.0869\nSARS - Worldwide (34): etiology 20030408.0857\nSARS - worldwide (13): etiology 20030327.0758\nSARS - worldwide (04): etiology 20030325.0737\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - worldwide (17) 20030322.0713\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - Worldwide: alert (03) 20030316.0660\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - Worldwide (02):alert 20030315.0649\nSevere Acute Respiratory Syndrome - Worldwide 20030315.0637\nAcute respiratory syndrome - Canada (Ontario) 20030314.0631\nAcute respiratory syndrome - East Asia 20030314.0630\nAcute respiratory syndrome - China (HK), VietNam (03) 20030313.0624\nUndiagnosed illness - Vietnam (Hanoi): RFI 20030311.0595\nPneumonia - China (Guangdong) (07) 20030221.0452\nPneumonia - China (Guangdong): RFI 20030210.0357\n.................................mpp/pg/dk\n\n*##########################################################*\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.

Then as it spreads out from those workers into other\npopulations, the ages change, so it's very important to understand the\ndynamics of this disease.\n\nAs far as Beijing goes, last evening they visited the military hospital.\nThey estimated that there are at least 50 patients in this hospital with\nSARS from what they've seen. They also estimate that there are between\n100-200 probable cases in Beijing, more than has been reported, and they\nfeel that there might even be up to 1000 people who are under observation\nright now at various stages of infection; some probably are not SARS, in\nfact many are probably not SARS, but they are taking precautions in\nobserving these. It's our impression that China needs to get clear on how\nit reports these diseases and they are working very closely with the\nChinese to get better reporting. It's also the team's feeling that Beijing\nhas many resources that they can put to work on this disease and that SARS\nwill not be a problem in Beijing if they get these resources working. Their\nconcern is in the provinces, especially in the western provinces, and they\nare afraid that it will not only spread from cities into the communities\nbut into areas where there may not be health facilities that are very\nclosely accessible to people. So, the challenge now is for China to not\nonly report, but to trace infection, to do infection control in the\nhospitals, and do everything that the other countries are doing to stop the\nspread of this disease.\n\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[2]\nDate: 16 Apr 2003\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: Hong Kong - Department of Health [edited]\n<http://www.info.gov.hk/dh/new/index.htm>\n\n\nSituation report on atypical pneumonia 16 Apr 2003\n\nThe following is jointly issued by the Department of Health and the\nHospital Authority:\n\nAs of 3 PM 16 Apr 2003, there are an additional 36 patients confirmed to\nhave atypical pneumonia following admission to public hospitals earlier.\nThey include 7 healthcare workers (6 from Princess Margaret Hospital and\none from Pamela Youde Nethersole Eastern Hospital). The remaining 29 were\nother patients and contacts of patients with atypical pneumonia.\n\nA total of 257 patients have recovered from atypical pneumonia and have\nbeen discharged from public hospitals. Of them, 14 were discharged\ntoday. 122 patients are receiving treatment in intensive care unit.\n\n5 patients died in hospitals, bringing to 61 the total number of deaths\nrelating to atypical pneumonia. A 54-year-old female and a 73-year-old\nmale, both with a history of chronic disease, died in Queen Elizabeth\nHospital. A 44-year-old male and a 62-year-old female died in Princess\nMargaret Hospital. Another chronically ill male patient, aged 73, died in\nAlice Ho Miu Ling Nethersole Hospital.\n\nThe cumulative figure for patients who have been admitted to public\nhospitals with atypical pneumonia since 12 Mar 2003 is as follows:\n\nCumulative no. cases/ no. recovered/ no. deaths\nHealth care workers of Hospitals/Clinics and medical students: 298/ 100/ 61\nPatients, family members & visitors: 970/ 157/ 0\nTotal: 1268/ 257 /61\n\n* Most of the deaths occurred in individuals who have a history of\nchronic diseases or were patients who sought treatment at a relatively late\nstage of infection.\n\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[3]\nDate: 16 Apr 2003\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: Singapore - Ministry of Health 16 Apr 2003 [edited]\n<http://app.moh.gov.sg/sar/sar0301.asp?id=1&mid=6180>\n\n\nSARS Situation Update 16 Apr 2003\n\nAs of 16 Apr 2003, 6 additional SARS patients have been discharged,\nbringing the total number of patients who have recovered from SARS to 91.\n61 SARS patients remain hospitalised.\n\nThere are 5 additional SARS cases reported today. They comprise 2 staff\nmembers of National Cancer Centre (NCC), namely a radiographer who had been\nadmitted to Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH) since 9 Apr 2003 for observation,\nand a porter who was admitted to TTSH on 14 Apr 2003. Both patients\ndeveloped lung changes on chest X-ray yesterday and hence were diagnosed to\nhave SARS. The third SARS case is an inpatient at Singapore General\nHospital (SGH) Ward 58 who has been observed in TTSH since 13 Apr 2003, and\nwho developed lung changes yesterday. The other 2 cases comprise the son of\na SARS patient, and a doctor at National University Hospital (NUH) who\nlooked after 2 patients prior to their diagnosis of SARS.\n\nSituation Update at NCC\nThere are 2 NCC staff members who have been diagnosed as probable SARS.\n\nThe radiographer developed a fever (37.8 deg C) on Saturday 5 Apr 2003. He\ndid not see a doctor. He was well with no fever over the next 3 days (6--8\nApr 2003). He worked in the radiology department of NCC on 7 and 8 Apr\n2003. Twice-daily temperature monitoring was performed and he was noted to\nhave no fever. During these 2 days, he performed CT scans and MRI on a\ntotal of 11 patients.\n\nIn the early hours of 9 Apr 2003, he developed fever of 38.4 deg C. He went\nto Changi General Hospital (CGH) and was transferred to TTSH on the same\nday. On admission he was classified as a low-risk suspect for SARS. CGH\nobserved all the infection control measures when the patient was there.\n\nAnother hospital staff (porter), who handles dispatch work, developed a\nlow-grade fever (37.5 deg C) on the morning of Thu 10 Apr 2003. He was not\nassigned any duties and during that time he only came into contact with the\ndepartmental staff. At noon, his temperature went up to 38.6 deg C. He was\nseen at the SGH Staff Clinic and was given 2 days MC [medical leave?] and\nasked to return for a review on 12 Apr 2003.\n\nHe had no fever on 11 Apr 2003. He did not return to the Staff Clinic on 12\nApr 2003 and instead saw his neighbourhood General Practitioner (GP). He\nwas given 2 more days MC. He continued to have low-grade [fever]. On 14 Apr\n2003, he went directly to the Staff Clinic and was referred to TTSH and\nadmitted on the same day.\n\nBesides these 2 staff members, the other NCC staff are currently well. As a\nprecaution, NCC has closed its radiology department until 20 Apr 2003.\nUrgent radiological x-rays will be done at SGH A&E Dept. Non-urgent\nappointments will be deferred. NCC has contacted 10 of the 11 patients who\nhad X-ray investigations done by the radiographer and they are well.\nAlthough the radiographer did not go into the waiting room of the X-ray\ndepartment, as a precaution, NCC has been contacting the 200 patients who\nhave had other X-rays done during the period 7--9 Apr 2003. Investigations\nare still in progress to trace the source of infection.\n\nSituation Update at NUH\nThe doctor attended to a patient who was being treated for heart failure.\nThe patient, who was admitted to NUH on 8 Apr 2003, had been a visitor at\nSGH Ward 57 in end March. He had multiple medical conditions and did not\nhave fever at that time. When he was reviewed in the ward, the possibility\nof concurrent pneumonia was recognised as his condition had deteriorated.\nThe patient was unstable and required transfer to the NUH Intensive Care\nUnit where he was intubated. The transfer to TTSH took place later on the\nsame day when the patient's condition stabilised. The patient passed away\non 12 Apr 2003.\n\nThe NUH doctor developed fever on 11 Apr 2003 evening and was sent to TTSH\nEmergency Department on the same day. She has been diagnosed as a probable\nSARS case on 16 Apr 2003.\n\nHome Quarantine for non-SARS patients with chronic conditions discharged\nfrom SGH and TTSH\nContact tracing at SGH has identified the patients and healthcare workers\nwho may have been exposed to SARS. These contacts have been quarantined or\nare being monitored. There are about 800 inpatients at present in SGH who\nhave not been exposed. However, as a precaution, patients discharged from\nSGH from 17 Apr 2003 onwards who have chronic co-morbid conditions will be\nissued Home Quarantine Orders (HQO) for 10 days. At end of 10 days, SGH\nwill recall them for review, following which they will be on phone\nsurveillance for a further 10 days. The other discharged patients who do\nnot have any chronic conditions will not be on HQO but phone surveillance\nfor 21 days. The same arrangement will be implemented for non-SARS patients\nwith chronic conditions discharged from TTSH.\n\nSummary of SARS cases\nThere was a SARS patient in intensive care who died late 15 Apr 2003. She\nwas the mother of a doctor who contracted SARS while looking after a SARS\npatient. The other deceased is the mother of a SARS patient. On 13 Apr\n2003, we reported 2 SARS deaths linked to the SGH cluster comprising an\ninpatient and the brother of an index patient. The preliminary findings of\nboth patients were that they died of other medical conditions unrelated to\nSARS. We are awaiting results of further investigations.\n\nBelow is the summary of the SARS cases to date:\n\nNumber Discharged: 85 plus 6\nHospitalised: 61 (including 16 in intensive care)\nDeaths: 13 + 2 (pending post mortem findings)\n\nTotal: 167\n\nSuspected: 91 (including 8 children below 18)\nUnder home quarantine orders: 582\n\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[4]\nDate: 16 Apr 2003\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: CDC SARS website 16 Apr 2003 [edited]\n<http://www.cdc.gov/od/oc/media/sars.htm>\n\n\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome report of suspected cases under\ninvestigation in the United States\n\nThese data were reported to the World Health Organization on 15 Apr 2003.\n\nState: suspected cases under investigation\n\nAlabama: 1\nCalifornia: 42\nColorado: 6\nConnecticut: 4\nFlorida: 11\nGeorgia: 3\nHawaii: 5\nIllinois: 11\nIndiana: 1\nKansas: 1\nKentucky: 1\nMaine: 2\nMassachusetts: 8\nMichigan: 3\nMinnesota: 6\nMississippi: 1\nMissouri: 2\nNevada: 1\nNew Hampshire: 1\nNew Jersey: 3\nNew Mexico: 1\nNew York: 22\nNorth Carolina: 6\nOhio: 10\nOregon: 1\nPennsylvania: 5\nRhode Island: 1\nSouth Carolina: 1\nTexas: 7\nUtah: 5\nVermont: 2\nVirginia: 5\nWashington: 19\nWisconsin: 1\n\nTotal suspected cases under investigation: 199\n\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[5]\nDate: 16 Apr 2003\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: Health Canada [edited]\n<http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/english/protection/warnings/sars/update32.html>\n\n\nUpdate 32: Severe acute respiratory syndrome -- 16 Apr 2003 4:30 PM\n\nAs of 16 Apr 2003, Health Canada has received reports of 303 probable or\nsuspect cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Canada. There\nhave been 13 deaths in Canada. To date, transmission has been limited to\nspecific transmission settings such as households, hospitals, and specific\ncommunity settings. The information contained in this update is based on\nthe information available to Health Canada at this time.\n\nThe details of the cases to date are as follows:\n\nOntario is reporting 122 probable and 127 suspect cases. All cases have\noccurred in persons who have traveled to Asia or had contact with SARS\ncases in the household or in a health-care setting.\nBritish Columbia is reporting 4 probable and 38 suspect cases.\nNew Brunswick is reporting 2 suspect cases.\nSaskatchewan is reporting 1 suspect case.\nAlberta is reporting 5 suspect cases.\nPrince Edward Island is reporting 4 suspect cases.\n\nSo far, 91 people have been discharged from hospitals in Ontario. These\npeople were treated as suspect cases or as probable cases.\n\nThese numbers are accurate as of 1:00 PM EDST 16 Apr 2003.\n\n[These data do not mention the newswire reports of transmission within a\nreligious community related to attendance at a funeral of a probable SARS\ncase. The newswire reports have been varied, with some mentioning that\nmost of the cases had been previously reported, but according to this\nupdate there is no mention of community-based close contact, which appeared\nto be the mode of transmission in this generation of cases. More\ninformation on this observation from official sources would be appreciated.\n- Mod.MPP]\n\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[As of today's update there is a cumulative total of 3293 cases of SARS\nreported to the WHO, with 58 new cases reported in the preceding 24 hours;\na total of 159 deaths (case fatality rate of 4.8 percent) and 1548 patients\nhave recovered (47 percent). In the past 24 hours, Hong Kong has reported\n36 new cases and 5 deaths; in China there have been 14 new cases\nreported. Based on the information provided by Dr. Heymann in today's WHO\npress briefing, we expect to see the numbers of cases reported from Beijing\nto increase significantly once official reports from the military hospitals\nare received. In addition, there has been the suggestion of increased\ntransmission outside of Beijing and Guangdong. It would be interesting to\nsee a breakdown of reported cases by province to determine whether new\nareas of local transmission have been identified. For example, the lay\npress has reported cases in Inner Mongolia, suggesting local transmission,\nbut this area has not officially been added to the affected areas list --\nsee ProMED-mail posting SARS - worldwide (45): cases 20030412.0890.\n\nThere are now 199 suspected cases from 32 states in the United States. This\nrepresents an increase of 6 cases from the last report on 15 Apr\n2003. There has been mention in press releases (CDC press release 14 Apr\n2003 (accessible at:\n<http://www.cdc.gov/od/oc/media/transcripts/t030414.htm> and in many lay\npress reports) that the USA plans to change reporting practices, separating\nsuspected and probable cases using the WHO definitions. When that occurs,\nwe expect to see a marked decrease in the numbers of cases of SARS reported\non a daily basis to WHO. - Mod.MPP]\nSee Also\nSARS - worldwide (50): (cases) 20030415.0922\nSARS - worldwide (49): cases 20030414.0916\nSARS - worldwide (47): cases 20030413.0905\nSARS - worldwide (46): diagnostic test 20030413.0901\nSARS - worldwide (44): UK transmission suspected 20030412.0887\nSARS - worldwide (42): WHO historical overview 20030411.0878\nSARS - worldwide (41):overview 20030411.0876\nSARS - worldwide (38): etiology 20030410.0869\nSARS - Worldwide (34): etiology 20030408.0857\nSARS - worldwide (13): etiology 20030327.0758\nSARS - worldwide (04): etiology 20030325.0737\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - worldwide (17) 20030322.0713\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - Worldwide: alert (03) 20030316.0660\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - Worldwide (02):alert 20030315.0649\nSevere Acute Respiratory Syndrome - Worldwide 20030315.0637\nAcute respiratory syndrome - Canada (Ontario) 20030314.0631\nAcute respiratory syndrome - East Asia 20030314.0630\nAcute respiratory syndrome - China (HK), VietNam (03) 20030313.0624\nUndiagnosed illness - Vietnam (Hanoi): RFI 20030311.0595\nPneumonia - China (Guangdong) (07) 20030221.0452\nPneumonia - China (Guangdong): RFI 20030210.0357\n.................................mpp/pg/dk\n\n*##########################################################*\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.

There are\nmultiple curves, representing the global outbreak, and then outbreaks by\ncountry for Hong Kong, Viet Nam, Singapore, Canada, the United States, and\nthe European Region. Reviewing the curves, when looking at the epidemic\ncurve by date of onset, it does appear as though the global outbreak may\nhave already peaked, although this curve represents a small fraction of\nactual reported probable cases, as dates of onset were not available for\n2105 cases. The date of onset of the most recent reported cases was 1 Apr\n2003, 6 days preceding the last date of notification. In contrast, the\nepidemic curve plotting reported cases by date of report appears to be\nconsistent with ongoing transmission at a steady rate, with a marked\nincrease in numbers of cases reported on 1 Apr 2003 (representing the\ndelayed reports from China) and another significant increase in reported\ncases on 8 Apr 2003.\n\nThe epidemic curve by date of report in Hong Kong suggests that there was a\nlarge peak during the week of 29 Mar 2003, and a second smaller peak during\nthe week of 5 Apr 2003. The epidemic curve by date of onset for Viet Nam\nsuggests that there was a peak during the week of 8 Mar 2003, and apparent\ninterruption of transmission (or missed cases, or one incubation period\npending appearance of new cases) during the week of 29 Mar 2003 and the\nappearance of a few cases during the week of 5 Apr 2003. The epidemic\ncurve, by date of onset for Singapore shows a clear peak in cases during\nthe period 15-22 Mar 2003 and a significant tapering off of cases by the\nweek 5 Apr 2003. The epidemic curve, by date of onset, for Canada shows a\nclear peak during the period 15-22 Mar 2003, with continued transmission\nbut at a lower rate. There have not been any cases reported with dates of\nonset since 4 Apr 2003 in Canada. The epidemic curve, by date of onset\n(current as of 4 Apr 2003), for the United States shows several peak\nperiods of cases, during the weeks of 15 Mar 2003, 22 Mar 2003, and 29 Mar\n2003. The maximum number of cases with dates of onset on a single day was\n9 on 17 Mar 2003. (We do not have information on the dates of onset of the\nfew healthcare workers and family members that were contacts of imported\ncases, but the overwhelming majority of cases reported in the United States\nwere in individuals with a history of travel to affected areas (see section\n[B] above). There have not been any cases reported with dates of onset\nsince 30 Mar 2003, representing a 5-day period without new cases. In\ncontrast, the epidemic curve by date of onset for the European Region is\nmore consistent with sporadic case reports, with a maximum of one or 2\ncases per day. To date there have not been reports of any secondary\ntransmission in the European Region. - Mod.MPP]\n\n\n[D] Update 25 - Interim report of WHO team in China, status of the main\nSARS outbreaks in different countries 9 Apr 2003\n<http://www.who.int/csr/sarsarchive/2003_04_09/en/>\n\n[ProMED-mail would like to express our continuing gratitude to Marianne\nHopp <mjhopp12@yahoo.com> for her daily monitoring of WHO reports. - Mod.MPP]\n\n\nChina\n------\nThe WHO team of experts presented its interim report on the SARS outbreak\nin Guangdong Province this morning to the Chinese Ministry of Health and\nVice Premier Wu Yi in Beijing. The team began its investigations in\nGuangdong on 3 Apr 2003.\n\nThe team concluded that the health system in Guangdong responded well to\nthe outbreak. The province has a health system in which every hospital at\nevery level reports any new cases of SARS. The WHO report therefore\nconcluded that virtually all probable cases of SARS presenting at a\nhospital in Guangdong Province will be detected and rapidly reported.\n\nHowever, the team found an urgent need to improve surveillance in the\ncountryside to head off new outbreaks in rural areas. The team was further\nconcerned by an increase in sporadic cases, which could not be linked to a\nparticular transmission chain, as such cases raised questions about the\nadequacy of contact tracing.\n\nIn addition, the report noted many remaining concerns about the ability of\nother provinces, where health systems are not as strong as the one in\nGuangdong, to respond promptly and effectively to the challenge of SARS.\n\nIn Beijing, for example, only a minority of hospitals make daily reports of\nSARS cases. Contact tracing is another problem in Beijing and does not\nappear to be carried out systematically. Failure to perform careful contact\ntracing will allow the disease to spread.\n\nThe team observed that many of China\u0092s poorer provinces may not have\nadequate resources, facilities, and equipment to cope with outbreaks of\nSARS, and underscored that Guangdong\u0092s capacity was exceptional among\nChina\u0092s provinces.\n\nIn Guangdong, the SARS outbreak placed an enormous strain on the health\ncare system. The Guangdong Infectious Disease Hospital (Guangzhou No. 8\nPeople\u0092s Hospital) had 150 of its 400 beds occupied by SARS patients daily\nduring the second week of February [2003]. The team noted that the response\nof the health care system has been exemplary, and commended the dedication\nand bravery of doctors, nurses, and others working in clinics and hospitals.\n\nMicrobiological findings\n----------\nLarge banks of stored specimens from suspected and probable SARS cases,\nfrom case contacts as well as from \u0093normal controls\u0094 exist at the\ninstitutions visited and are stored under suitable conditions; detailed\ninformation about the numbers and types of these specimens are available\nand were provided to members of the WHO team. Although the patient data on\neach of these is very limited, it is sufficient to allow linkage with the\nvery detailed epidemiological and clinical information held elsewhere in\nGuangdong Provincial Centers for Disease Control and the hospitals.\n\nThese specimen banks comprise different types of respiratory specimens from\nwhich the detection of agents can be attempted and serum samples, often as\npaired acute and convalescent sera (i.e., the first sample obtained during\nthe acute phase of the illness and the second during recovery), which will\nallow determination of seroconversions. The laboratory staff agreed that\nonce a causative agent for SARS was identified, these banks should be\ntested and will provide very valuable information; they seemed, however,\nless sure whether this time had come already, i.e. whether there was\nalready sufficient evidence and whether suitable tests had been developed\nelsewhere that would make such an exercise worthwhile. They requested\nassistance from the WHO team to obtain relevant information on primer\nsequences and other matters as well as access to suitable experimental\ntests such as immunofluorescence antibody assays.\n\nMain recommendations\n---------\nThe interim report made several major recommendations, including the following:\n\n- The SARS reporting system established in Guangdong is an excellent model\nthat all provinces should follow. Team members suggest that the MOH ensures\nthat all provinces are brought up to Guangdong standards by implementing\nthis system nationwide as a matter of the utmost urgency. A programme for\nevaluating and accrediting surveillance systems through evaluation by\ntechnical experts is also suggested in order to ensure that consistent\nstandards are achieved and maintained.\n\n- The Guangdong experience should be used to develop uniform standards\nthroughout all provinces for preventing the spread of SARS in health care\nfacilities.\n\n- Careful contact tracing of SARS cases is vital to bring the outbreak\nunder control. Detailed interviewing of all newly reported SARS cases by\ntrained interviewers including a full review not only of close contacts but\npotential exposure in other crowded settings, e.g. public transport, needs\nto be routinely carried out. Contacts of cases should be provided with\ndetailed preventive advice verbally and in writing.\n\n- Much better collaboration between virological laboratories in China is\nrequired, particularly to facilitate the exchange of results, specimens,\nand reagents. The following institutions should form the nucleus of a\nnational SARS laboratory network within China:\n- National Institute of Virology, China CDC, Beijing\n- Virology Unit, Beijing Provincial CDC, Beijing\n- Virology Unit, Guangdong Provincial CDC, Guangzhou\n- Department of Virology, Zhongshan University, Guangzhou\nLaboratories from other areas with experience of SARS cases should also be\nincluded. Adequate funding and human resources need to be urgently provided\nto ensure the proper functioning and sustainability of SARS surveillance\nactivities, as they are essential to controlling spread of the disease.\nChinese institutions should form a national SARS laboratory network within\nChina to speed up the exchange of results, specimens, and reagents.\n\n- Guangdong clinicians have cared for the largest number of patients in the\nworld and their experience should be shared with the international\ncommunity through publications, meetings, and in drafting guidelines for\nthe management of SARS patients.\n\nPriority actions\nPriority actions recommended in the report to contain SARS include:\n\n- early recognition and treatment of cases\n\n- stringent infection control measures in hospitals and clinics\n\n- prompt reporting of suspected cases\n\n- meticulous investigation and contact tracing in the community - public\nawareness campaigns and education.\n\n\nHong Kong: heavy burden on the health system\n---------\nWith today\u0092s cumulative total of 970 cases and 27 deaths, Hong Kong\ncontinues to have the largest SARS outbreak, second to China. The strain on\nhealth services and staff is considerable, and strengthened measures of\ninfection control may be needed.\n\nThe isolation order placed on Block E, Amory Gardens will expire at\nmidnight, 9 Apr 2003. The Hong Kong Health Department has announced that\nresidents, temporarily housed at camps, may return home after their flats\nhave been disinfected by the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department.\n\nSingapore: role of \"super-spreaders\"\n----------\nSingapore has increased measures to prevent transmission in hospitals\nfollowing an outbreak in Singapore General Hospital. Measures include\nmandatory temperature checks for all staff, limiting visitors, and\nisolation of all possible SARS cases. The Singapore General Hospital\noutbreak involved over 20 people with suspect symptoms, nearly all nurses\nand doctors. Only 7 have been diagnosed as \"probable\" SARS cases. The\ndistribution of cases over time suggests a point source. The health worker\nconsidered to be the index case in this cluster of cases may be the fourth\n\"super-spreader\" identified in Singapore.\n\nA \"super-spreader\" is a source case who has, for as yet unknown reasons,\ninfected a large number of persons. Although transmission patterns of SARS\nremain incompletely understood, evidence suggests that such\n\"super-spreaders\" may have contributed to the evolution of SARS outbreaks\naround the world.\n\nUntil recently, all cases in Singapore have had good epidemiological links\nto their source. Further work is now required to establish similar links\nfor the more recent cases. If confirmed, such linking of cases will show\nthat transmission is limited to those who are symptomatic and usually very\nill. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that health workers\ncontinue to be the main group diagnosed with SARS. To date, investigation\nof the SARS outbreak in Singapore have revealed few signs of community\nspread beyond family members in close face-to-face contact with patients.\nHowever, these findings are based on limited data on exposures.\n\nViet Nam: no asymptomatic transmission\n--------\nVietnam is now reporting a cumulative total of 62 cases. 4 of these cases\nhave been detected in the last few days following stable reporting of 58\ncases for several consecutive days. The stable number of cases raised hope\nthat the outbreak in the French hospital in Hanoi had been contained.\nHowever, a 59th case was reported on 31 Mar 2003.\n\nThis male patient had been in contact with his daughter, who was a patient\nat the French Hospital at the time of Viet Nam\u0092s index case. This contact\ncontinued when the daughter became an outpatient. The daughter\u0092s husband,\nwho attended the Hanoi French Hospital with his wife, had a mild febrile\nillness which was undiagnosed at the time and which resolved spontaneously.\nIt is presumed that he had mild SARS and passed the infection to his\nfather-in-law (case 59). Assuming this to be true, WHO epidemiologists\nmaintain the view that asymptomatic transmission does not appear to occur.\nNor does this case suggest a longer incubation period than currently\nassumed (2-7 days, with 10 days considered the rare maximum). Blood is\nbeing taken for testing of the husband. Case 60 is a doctor who cared for\ncase 59 while he was in a provincial hospital about 1.5 hours from Hanoi.\nCases 61 and 62 are young women who are part of the extended household who\nprovided considerable care for case 59.\n\nWHO continues to work with the Ministry of Health to investigate the\ncontacts of these cases. It is anticipated that a few more new cases will\nbe linked to case 59. Careful monitoring of contacts continues.\n\nOf the 62 cases, 44 have been discharged, 4 have died, and 14 remain in\nhospital. One of the hospitalized patients remains critically ill, although\nslightly improved. All other hospitalized patients are improving.\n\nCanada: one new probable case reported\n--------\nHealth Canada has reported a cumulative total of 94 probable cases and 10\ndeaths. Ontario has reported 91 probable cases. All cases have occurred in\npersons who have traveled to Asia or had contact with SARS cases in the\nhousehold or in a health-care setting. The remaining probable cases are in\nBritish Columbia (3).\n\nUpdate on cases and countries\n-------------\nAs of today, a cumulative total of 2722 cases, with 106 deaths have been\nreported from 16 countries. This represents an increase of 51 cases and 3\ndeaths when compared with yesterday.\n\nNew cases were reported in Canada (3), China (1), Hong Kong SAR (42),\nSingapore (5), and the United States of America (1). The single case\nreported in Australia has been removed from the list. Deaths were reported\nin Hong Kong (2) and Singapore (1).\n\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Trying to synthesize the information contained in the above reports from\nWHO today, there are many positive points. With respect to China, the\nreports on the investigation in Guangdong are promising, and we look\nforward to seeing more epidemiologic and clinical details on the cases from\nthe outbreak. In addition, the collaboration with the Chinese MOH with\nrespect to laboratory studies is also very promising and will provide a\nbank of specimens among which to check diagnostic tests as well as to\nconduct further studies. On the negative side is the concern mentioned\nregarding other provinces' ability to manage an outbreak of SARS, both from\nthe clinical aspects as well as the public health aspects.\n\nFrom today's reported cases, it appears the predominant new case reports\nare coming from Hong Kong. In Singapore, there continues to be\ntransmission, as continuation of the original importations and further\ngenerations of transmission related to those original importations from\nHong Kong. The notion of \"super spreaders\" is further highlighted by the\nSingapore experience, and we look forward to more details from studies of\nthese reported \"super spreaders\". The experience in Viet Nam seems to\nsuggest that transmission does not occur during asymptomatic infection or\nduring the incubation period, but rather after the onset of clinical\nillness. The new cluster of cases is linked to the original outbreak in\nHanoi, with nosocomial spread to a health care worker, suggesting that\nnewly involved areas have not automatically suspected SARS and that a SARS\npatient is initially cared for in the absence of infection control\nprocedures. This begs the question: At what point should all febrile\npatients in the health care setting be initially evaluated using infection\ncontrol procedures, including respiratory barriers to transmission?\n\nThe addition of epidemic curves and geographic mapping of the ongoing SARS\noutbreak is appreciated, as \"a picture is worth 1000 words\" (as was\nevidenced by the amount of words necessary to attempt to describe the\nsignificance of the curves by this moderator). The daily case counts are\neasier to interpret when graphically represented.\n\nProf. Rod Griffiths, the Regional Director of Public Health, Prof. Rod\nGriffiths,West Midlands, UK <Rod@stonebow.demon.co.uk> inquired about\nattack rates -- what proportion of exposed individuals (contacts of\nprobable SARS cases) have gone on to develop SARS themselves. A good\nquestion, but a difficult one to answer in the absence of a definitive\ndiagnostic test for SARS at this point in time. We look forward to seeing\ncrude attack rates when available (taking liberty to refer to estimates of\nattack rates based on current clinical and epidemiologic case definitions,\nrecognizing that in the absence of a definitive diagnostic test these\ncalculations would be estimates as they would not account for asymptomatic\ninfections).\n\nThe removal of Australia from the list of countries reporting SARS cases is\na further reminder that SARS is a diagnosis of exclusion until there is a\ndefinitive diagnostic test that will allow for confirmation of cases, and\nthat there are still many other diagnoses that present with the same\nclinical syndrome as described for SARS. - Mod.MPP]\nSee Also\nSARS - worldwide (35):cases 20030408.0858\nSARS - Worldwide (34): etiology 20030408.0857\nSARS - Worldwide (33): cases 20030407.0850\nSARS - worldwide (31): etiology 20030405.0833\nSARS - worldwide (28): overview 20030403.0822\nSARS - worldwide (26): etiology 20030403.0819\nSARS - worldwide (19): etiology 20030330.0786\nSARS - Worldwide (16): Etiology 20030328.0774\nSARS - worldwide (14): overview 20030327.0769\nSARS - worldwide (13): etiology 20030327.0758\nSARS - worldwide (10): infectious disease perspectives 20030326.0752\nSARS - worldwide (04): etiology 20030325.0737\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - worldwide (17) 20030322.0713\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - Worldwide: alert (03) 20030316.0660\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - Worldwide (02):alert 20030315.0649\nSevere Acute Respiratory Syndrome - Worldwide 20030315.0637\nAcute respiratory syndrome - Canada (Ontario) 20030314.0631\nAcute respiratory syndrome - East Asia 20030314.0630\nAcute respiratory syndrome - China (HK), VietNam (03) 20030313.0624\nUndiagnosed illness - Vietnam (Hanoi): RFI 20030311.0595\nPneumonia - China (Guangdong) (07) 20030221.0452\nPneumonia - China (Guangdong): RFI 20030210.0357\n...........................mpp/pg/mpp\n\n*##########################################################*\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.

There are\nmultiple curves, representing the global outbreak, and then outbreaks by\ncountry for Hong Kong, Viet Nam, Singapore, Canada, the United States, and\nthe European Region. Reviewing the curves, when looking at the epidemic\ncurve by date of onset, it does appear as though the global outbreak may\nhave already peaked, although this curve represents a small fraction of\nactual reported probable cases, as dates of onset were not available for\n2105 cases. The date of onset of the most recent reported cases was 1 Apr\n2003, 6 days preceding the last date of notification. In contrast, the\nepidemic curve plotting reported cases by date of report appears to be\nconsistent with ongoing transmission at a steady rate, with a marked\nincrease in numbers of cases reported on 1 Apr 2003 (representing the\ndelayed reports from China) and another significant increase in reported\ncases on 8 Apr 2003.\n\nThe epidemic curve by date of report in Hong Kong suggests that there was a\nlarge peak during the week of 29 Mar 2003, and a second smaller peak during\nthe week of 5 Apr 2003. The epidemic curve by date of onset for Viet Nam\nsuggests that there was a peak during the week of 8 Mar 2003, and apparent\ninterruption of transmission (or missed cases, or one incubation period\npending appearance of new cases) during the week of 29 Mar 2003 and the\nappearance of a few cases during the week of 5 Apr 2003. The epidemic\ncurve, by date of onset for Singapore shows a clear peak in cases during\nthe period 15-22 Mar 2003 and a significant tapering off of cases by the\nweek 5 Apr 2003. The epidemic curve, by date of onset, for Canada shows a\nclear peak during the period 15-22 Mar 2003, with continued transmission\nbut at a lower rate. There have not been any cases reported with dates of\nonset since 4 Apr 2003 in Canada. The epidemic curve, by date of onset\n(current as of 4 Apr 2003), for the United States shows several peak\nperiods of cases, during the weeks of 15 Mar 2003, 22 Mar 2003, and 29 Mar\n2003. The maximum number of cases with dates of onset on a single day was\n9 on 17 Mar 2003. (We do not have information on the dates of onset of the\nfew healthcare workers and family members that were contacts of imported\ncases, but the overwhelming majority of cases reported in the United States\nwere in individuals with a history of travel to affected areas (see section\n[B] above). There have not been any cases reported with dates of onset\nsince 30 Mar 2003, representing a 5-day period without new cases. In\ncontrast, the epidemic curve by date of onset for the European Region is\nmore consistent with sporadic case reports, with a maximum of one or 2\ncases per day. To date there have not been reports of any secondary\ntransmission in the European Region. - Mod.MPP]\n\n\n[D] Update 25 - Interim report of WHO team in China, status of the main\nSARS outbreaks in different countries 9 Apr 2003\n<http://www.who.int/csr/sarsarchive/2003_04_09/en/>\n\n[ProMED-mail would like to express our continuing gratitude to Marianne\nHopp <mjhopp12@yahoo.com> for her daily monitoring of WHO reports. - Mod.MPP]\n\n\nChina\n------\nThe WHO team of experts presented its interim report on the SARS outbreak\nin Guangdong Province this morning to the Chinese Ministry of Health and\nVice Premier Wu Yi in Beijing. The team began its investigations in\nGuangdong on 3 Apr 2003.\n\nThe team concluded that the health system in Guangdong responded well to\nthe outbreak. The province has a health system in which every hospital at\nevery level reports any new cases of SARS. The WHO report therefore\nconcluded that virtually all probable cases of SARS presenting at a\nhospital in Guangdong Province will be detected and rapidly reported.\n\nHowever, the team found an urgent need to improve surveillance in the\ncountryside to head off new outbreaks in rural areas. The team was further\nconcerned by an increase in sporadic cases, which could not be linked to a\nparticular transmission chain, as such cases raised questions about the\nadequacy of contact tracing.\n\nIn addition, the report noted many remaining concerns about the ability of\nother provinces, where health systems are not as strong as the one in\nGuangdong, to respond promptly and effectively to the challenge of SARS.\n\nIn Beijing, for example, only a minority of hospitals make daily reports of\nSARS cases. Contact tracing is another problem in Beijing and does not\nappear to be carried out systematically. Failure to perform careful contact\ntracing will allow the disease to spread.\n\nThe team observed that many of China\u0092s poorer provinces may not have\nadequate resources, facilities, and equipment to cope with outbreaks of\nSARS, and underscored that Guangdong\u0092s capacity was exceptional among\nChina\u0092s provinces.\n\nIn Guangdong, the SARS outbreak placed an enormous strain on the health\ncare system. The Guangdong Infectious Disease Hospital (Guangzhou No. 8\nPeople\u0092s Hospital) had 150 of its 400 beds occupied by SARS patients daily\nduring the second week of February [2003]. The team noted that the response\nof the health care system has been exemplary, and commended the dedication\nand bravery of doctors, nurses, and others working in clinics and hospitals.\n\nMicrobiological findings\n----------\nLarge banks of stored specimens from suspected and probable SARS cases,\nfrom case contacts as well as from \u0093normal controls\u0094 exist at the\ninstitutions visited and are stored under suitable conditions; detailed\ninformation about the numbers and types of these specimens are available\nand were provided to members of the WHO team. Although the patient data on\neach of these is very limited, it is sufficient to allow linkage with the\nvery detailed epidemiological and clinical information held elsewhere in\nGuangdong Provincial Centers for Disease Control and the hospitals.\n\nThese specimen banks comprise different types of respiratory specimens from\nwhich the detection of agents can be attempted and serum samples, often as\npaired acute and convalescent sera (i.e., the first sample obtained during\nthe acute phase of the illness and the second during recovery), which will\nallow determination of seroconversions. The laboratory staff agreed that\nonce a causative agent for SARS was identified, these banks should be\ntested and will provide very valuable information; they seemed, however,\nless sure whether this time had come already, i.e. whether there was\nalready sufficient evidence and whether suitable tests had been developed\nelsewhere that would make such an exercise worthwhile. They requested\nassistance from the WHO team to obtain relevant information on primer\nsequences and other matters as well as access to suitable experimental\ntests such as immunofluorescence antibody assays.\n\nMain recommendations\n---------\nThe interim report made several major recommendations, including the following:\n\n- The SARS reporting system established in Guangdong is an excellent model\nthat all provinces should follow. Team members suggest that the MOH ensures\nthat all provinces are brought up to Guangdong standards by implementing\nthis system nationwide as a matter of the utmost urgency. A programme for\nevaluating and accrediting surveillance systems through evaluation by\ntechnical experts is also suggested in order to ensure that consistent\nstandards are achieved and maintained.\n\n- The Guangdong experience should be used to develop uniform standards\nthroughout all provinces for preventing the spread of SARS in health care\nfacilities.\n\n- Careful contact tracing of SARS cases is vital to bring the outbreak\nunder control. Detailed interviewing of all newly reported SARS cases by\ntrained interviewers including a full review not only of close contacts but\npotential exposure in other crowded settings, e.g. public transport, needs\nto be routinely carried out. Contacts of cases should be provided with\ndetailed preventive advice verbally and in writing.\n\n- Much better collaboration between virological laboratories in China is\nrequired, particularly to facilitate the exchange of results, specimens,\nand reagents. The following institutions should form the nucleus of a\nnational SARS laboratory network within China:\n- National Institute of Virology, China CDC, Beijing\n- Virology Unit, Beijing Provincial CDC, Beijing\n- Virology Unit, Guangdong Provincial CDC, Guangzhou\n- Department of Virology, Zhongshan University, Guangzhou\nLaboratories from other areas with experience of SARS cases should also be\nincluded. Adequate funding and human resources need to be urgently provided\nto ensure the proper functioning and sustainability of SARS surveillance\nactivities, as they are essential to controlling spread of the disease.\nChinese institutions should form a national SARS laboratory network within\nChina to speed up the exchange of results, specimens, and reagents.\n\n- Guangdong clinicians have cared for the largest number of patients in the\nworld and their experience should be shared with the international\ncommunity through publications, meetings, and in drafting guidelines for\nthe management of SARS patients.\n\nPriority actions\nPriority actions recommended in the report to contain SARS include:\n\n- early recognition and treatment of cases\n\n- stringent infection control measures in hospitals and clinics\n\n- prompt reporting of suspected cases\n\n- meticulous investigation and contact tracing in the community - public\nawareness campaigns and education.\n\n\nHong Kong: heavy burden on the health system\n---------\nWith today\u0092s cumulative total of 970 cases and 27 deaths, Hong Kong\ncontinues to have the largest SARS outbreak, second to China. The strain on\nhealth services and staff is considerable, and strengthened measures of\ninfection control may be needed.\n\nThe isolation order placed on Block E, Amory Gardens will expire at\nmidnight, 9 Apr 2003. The Hong Kong Health Department has announced that\nresidents, temporarily housed at camps, may return home after their flats\nhave been disinfected by the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department.\n\nSingapore: role of \"super-spreaders\"\n----------\nSingapore has increased measures to prevent transmission in hospitals\nfollowing an outbreak in Singapore General Hospital. Measures include\nmandatory temperature checks for all staff, limiting visitors, and\nisolation of all possible SARS cases. The Singapore General Hospital\noutbreak involved over 20 people with suspect symptoms, nearly all nurses\nand doctors. Only 7 have been diagnosed as \"probable\" SARS cases. The\ndistribution of cases over time suggests a point source. The health worker\nconsidered to be the index case in this cluster of cases may be the fourth\n\"super-spreader\" identified in Singapore.\n\nA \"super-spreader\" is a source case who has, for as yet unknown reasons,\ninfected a large number of persons. Although transmission patterns of SARS\nremain incompletely understood, evidence suggests that such\n\"super-spreaders\" may have contributed to the evolution of SARS outbreaks\naround the world.\n\nUntil recently, all cases in Singapore have had good epidemiological links\nto their source. Further work is now required to establish similar links\nfor the more recent cases. If confirmed, such linking of cases will show\nthat transmission is limited to those who are symptomatic and usually very\nill. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that health workers\ncontinue to be the main group diagnosed with SARS. To date, investigation\nof the SARS outbreak in Singapore have revealed few signs of community\nspread beyond family members in close face-to-face contact with patients.\nHowever, these findings are based on limited data on exposures.\n\nViet Nam: no asymptomatic transmission\n--------\nVietnam is now reporting a cumulative total of 62 cases. 4 of these cases\nhave been detected in the last few days following stable reporting of 58\ncases for several consecutive days. The stable number of cases raised hope\nthat the outbreak in the French hospital in Hanoi had been contained.\nHowever, a 59th case was reported on 31 Mar 2003.\n\nThis male patient had been in contact with his daughter, who was a patient\nat the French Hospital at the time of Viet Nam\u0092s index case. This contact\ncontinued when the daughter became an outpatient. The daughter\u0092s husband,\nwho attended the Hanoi French Hospital with his wife, had a mild febrile\nillness which was undiagnosed at the time and which resolved spontaneously.\nIt is presumed that he had mild SARS and passed the infection to his\nfather-in-law (case 59). Assuming this to be true, WHO epidemiologists\nmaintain the view that asymptomatic transmission does not appear to occur.\nNor does this case suggest a longer incubation period than currently\nassumed (2-7 days, with 10 days considered the rare maximum). Blood is\nbeing taken for testing of the husband. Case 60 is a doctor who cared for\ncase 59 while he was in a provincial hospital about 1.5 hours from Hanoi.\nCases 61 and 62 are young women who are part of the extended household who\nprovided considerable care for case 59.\n\nWHO continues to work with the Ministry of Health to investigate the\ncontacts of these cases. It is anticipated that a few more new cases will\nbe linked to case 59. Careful monitoring of contacts continues.\n\nOf the 62 cases, 44 have been discharged, 4 have died, and 14 remain in\nhospital. One of the hospitalized patients remains critically ill, although\nslightly improved. All other hospitalized patients are improving.\n\nCanada: one new probable case reported\n--------\nHealth Canada has reported a cumulative total of 94 probable cases and 10\ndeaths. Ontario has reported 91 probable cases. All cases have occurred in\npersons who have traveled to Asia or had contact with SARS cases in the\nhousehold or in a health-care setting. The remaining probable cases are in\nBritish Columbia (3).\n\nUpdate on cases and countries\n-------------\nAs of today, a cumulative total of 2722 cases, with 106 deaths have been\nreported from 16 countries. This represents an increase of 51 cases and 3\ndeaths when compared with yesterday.\n\nNew cases were reported in Canada (3), China (1), Hong Kong SAR (42),\nSingapore (5), and the United States of America (1). The single case\nreported in Australia has been removed from the list. Deaths were reported\nin Hong Kong (2) and Singapore (1).\n\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Trying to synthesize the information contained in the above reports from\nWHO today, there are many positive points. With respect to China, the\nreports on the investigation in Guangdong are promising, and we look\nforward to seeing more epidemiologic and clinical details on the cases from\nthe outbreak. In addition, the collaboration with the Chinese MOH with\nrespect to laboratory studies is also very promising and will provide a\nbank of specimens among which to check diagnostic tests as well as to\nconduct further studies. On the negative side is the concern mentioned\nregarding other provinces' ability to manage an outbreak of SARS, both from\nthe clinical aspects as well as the public health aspects.\n\nFrom today's reported cases, it appears the predominant new case reports\nare coming from Hong Kong. In Singapore, there continues to be\ntransmission, as continuation of the original importations and further\ngenerations of transmission related to those original importations from\nHong Kong. The notion of \"super spreaders\" is further highlighted by the\nSingapore experience, and we look forward to more details from studies of\nthese reported \"super spreaders\". The experience in Viet Nam seems to\nsuggest that transmission does not occur during asymptomatic infection or\nduring the incubation period, but rather after the onset of clinical\nillness. The new cluster of cases is linked to the original outbreak in\nHanoi, with nosocomial spread to a health care worker, suggesting that\nnewly involved areas have not automatically suspected SARS and that a SARS\npatient is initially cared for in the absence of infection control\nprocedures. This begs the question: At what point should all febrile\npatients in the health care setting be initially evaluated using infection\ncontrol procedures, including respiratory barriers to transmission?\n\nThe addition of epidemic curves and geographic mapping of the ongoing SARS\noutbreak is appreciated, as \"a picture is worth 1000 words\" (as was\nevidenced by the amount of words necessary to attempt to describe the\nsignificance of the curves by this moderator). The daily case counts are\neasier to interpret when graphically represented.\n\nProf. Rod Griffiths, the Regional Director of Public Health, Prof. Rod\nGriffiths,West Midlands, UK <Rod@stonebow.demon.co.uk> inquired about\nattack rates -- what proportion of exposed individuals (contacts of\nprobable SARS cases) have gone on to develop SARS themselves. A good\nquestion, but a difficult one to answer in the absence of a definitive\ndiagnostic test for SARS at this point in time. We look forward to seeing\ncrude attack rates when available (taking liberty to refer to estimates of\nattack rates based on current clinical and epidemiologic case definitions,\nrecognizing that in the absence of a definitive diagnostic test these\ncalculations would be estimates as they would not account for asymptomatic\ninfections).\n\nThe removal of Australia from the list of countries reporting SARS cases is\na further reminder that SARS is a diagnosis of exclusion until there is a\ndefinitive diagnostic test that will allow for confirmation of cases, and\nthat there are still many other diagnoses that present with the same\nclinical syndrome as described for SARS. - Mod.MPP]\nSee Also\nSARS - worldwide (35):cases 20030408.0858\nSARS - Worldwide (34): etiology 20030408.0857\nSARS - Worldwide (33): cases 20030407.0850\nSARS - worldwide (31): etiology 20030405.0833\nSARS - worldwide (28): overview 20030403.0822\nSARS - worldwide (26): etiology 20030403.0819\nSARS - worldwide (19): etiology 20030330.0786\nSARS - Worldwide (16): Etiology 20030328.0774\nSARS - worldwide (14): overview 20030327.0769\nSARS - worldwide (13): etiology 20030327.0758\nSARS - worldwide (10): infectious disease perspectives 20030326.0752\nSARS - worldwide (04): etiology 20030325.0737\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - worldwide (17) 20030322.0713\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - Worldwide: alert (03) 20030316.0660\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - Worldwide (02):alert 20030315.0649\nSevere Acute Respiratory Syndrome - Worldwide 20030315.0637\nAcute respiratory syndrome - Canada (Ontario) 20030314.0631\nAcute respiratory syndrome - East Asia 20030314.0630\nAcute respiratory syndrome - China (HK), VietNam (03) 20030313.0624\nUndiagnosed illness - Vietnam (Hanoi): RFI 20030311.0595\nPneumonia - China (Guangdong) (07) 20030221.0452\nPneumonia - China (Guangdong): RFI 20030210.0357\n...........................mpp/pg/mpp\n\n*##########################################################*\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.

There are\nmultiple curves, representing the global outbreak, and then outbreaks by\ncountry for Hong Kong, Viet Nam, Singapore, Canada, the United States, and\nthe European Region. Reviewing the curves, when looking at the epidemic\ncurve by date of onset, it does appear as though the global outbreak may\nhave already peaked, although this curve represents a small fraction of\nactual reported probable cases, as dates of onset were not available for\n2105 cases. The date of onset of the most recent reported cases was 1 Apr\n2003, 6 days preceding the last date of notification. In contrast, the\nepidemic curve plotting reported cases by date of report appears to be\nconsistent with ongoing transmission at a steady rate, with a marked\nincrease in numbers of cases reported on 1 Apr 2003 (representing the\ndelayed reports from China) and another significant increase in reported\ncases on 8 Apr 2003.\n\nThe epidemic curve by date of report in Hong Kong suggests that there was a\nlarge peak during the week of 29 Mar 2003, and a second smaller peak during\nthe week of 5 Apr 2003. The epidemic curve by date of onset for Viet Nam\nsuggests that there was a peak during the week of 8 Mar 2003, and apparent\ninterruption of transmission (or missed cases, or one incubation period\npending appearance of new cases) during the week of 29 Mar 2003 and the\nappearance of a few cases during the week of 5 Apr 2003. The epidemic\ncurve, by date of onset for Singapore shows a clear peak in cases during\nthe period 15-22 Mar 2003 and a significant tapering off of cases by the\nweek 5 Apr 2003. The epidemic curve, by date of onset, for Canada shows a\nclear peak during the period 15-22 Mar 2003, with continued transmission\nbut at a lower rate. There have not been any cases reported with dates of\nonset since 4 Apr 2003 in Canada. The epidemic curve, by date of onset\n(current as of 4 Apr 2003), for the United States shows several peak\nperiods of cases, during the weeks of 15 Mar 2003, 22 Mar 2003, and 29 Mar\n2003. The maximum number of cases with dates of onset on a single day was\n9 on 17 Mar 2003. (We do not have information on the dates of onset of the\nfew healthcare workers and family members that were contacts of imported\ncases, but the overwhelming majority of cases reported in the United States\nwere in individuals with a history of travel to affected areas (see section\n[B] above). There have not been any cases reported with dates of onset\nsince 30 Mar 2003, representing a 5-day period without new cases. In\ncontrast, the epidemic curve by date of onset for the European Region is\nmore consistent with sporadic case reports, with a maximum of one or 2\ncases per day. To date there have not been reports of any secondary\ntransmission in the European Region. - Mod.MPP]\n\n\n[D] Update 25 - Interim report of WHO team in China, status of the main\nSARS outbreaks in different countries 9 Apr 2003\n<http://www.who.int/csr/sarsarchive/2003_04_09/en/>\n\n[ProMED-mail would like to express our continuing gratitude to Marianne\nHopp <mjhopp12@yahoo.com> for her daily monitoring of WHO reports. - Mod.MPP]\n\n\nChina\n------\nThe WHO team of experts presented its interim report on the SARS outbreak\nin Guangdong Province this morning to the Chinese Ministry of Health and\nVice Premier Wu Yi in Beijing. The team began its investigations in\nGuangdong on 3 Apr 2003.\n\nThe team concluded that the health system in Guangdong responded well to\nthe outbreak. The province has a health system in which every hospital at\nevery level reports any new cases of SARS. The WHO report therefore\nconcluded that virtually all probable cases of SARS presenting at a\nhospital in Guangdong Province will be detected and rapidly reported.\n\nHowever, the team found an urgent need to improve surveillance in the\ncountryside to head off new outbreaks in rural areas. The team was further\nconcerned by an increase in sporadic cases, which could not be linked to a\nparticular transmission chain, as such cases raised questions about the\nadequacy of contact tracing.\n\nIn addition, the report noted many remaining concerns about the ability of\nother provinces, where health systems are not as strong as the one in\nGuangdong, to respond promptly and effectively to the challenge of SARS.\n\nIn Beijing, for example, only a minority of hospitals make daily reports of\nSARS cases. Contact tracing is another problem in Beijing and does not\nappear to be carried out systematically. Failure to perform careful contact\ntracing will allow the disease to spread.\n\nThe team observed that many of China\u0092s poorer provinces may not have\nadequate resources, facilities, and equipment to cope with outbreaks of\nSARS, and underscored that Guangdong\u0092s capacity was exceptional among\nChina\u0092s provinces.\n\nIn Guangdong, the SARS outbreak placed an enormous strain on the health\ncare system. The Guangdong Infectious Disease Hospital (Guangzhou No. 8\nPeople\u0092s Hospital) had 150 of its 400 beds occupied by SARS patients daily\nduring the second week of February [2003]. The team noted that the response\nof the health care system has been exemplary, and commended the dedication\nand bravery of doctors, nurses, and others working in clinics and hospitals.\n\nMicrobiological findings\n----------\nLarge banks of stored specimens from suspected and probable SARS cases,\nfrom case contacts as well as from \u0093normal controls\u0094 exist at the\ninstitutions visited and are stored under suitable conditions; detailed\ninformation about the numbers and types of these specimens are available\nand were provided to members of the WHO team. Although the patient data on\neach of these is very limited, it is sufficient to allow linkage with the\nvery detailed epidemiological and clinical information held elsewhere in\nGuangdong Provincial Centers for Disease Control and the hospitals.\n\nThese specimen banks comprise different types of respiratory specimens from\nwhich the detection of agents can be attempted and serum samples, often as\npaired acute and convalescent sera (i.e., the first sample obtained during\nthe acute phase of the illness and the second during recovery), which will\nallow determination of seroconversions. The laboratory staff agreed that\nonce a causative agent for SARS was identified, these banks should be\ntested and will provide very valuable information; they seemed, however,\nless sure whether this time had come already, i.e. whether there was\nalready sufficient evidence and whether suitable tests had been developed\nelsewhere that would make such an exercise worthwhile. They requested\nassistance from the WHO team to obtain relevant information on primer\nsequences and other matters as well as access to suitable experimental\ntests such as immunofluorescence antibody assays.\n\nMain recommendations\n---------\nThe interim report made several major recommendations, including the following:\n\n- The SARS reporting system established in Guangdong is an excellent model\nthat all provinces should follow. Team members suggest that the MOH ensures\nthat all provinces are brought up to Guangdong standards by implementing\nthis system nationwide as a matter of the utmost urgency. A programme for\nevaluating and accrediting surveillance systems through evaluation by\ntechnical experts is also suggested in order to ensure that consistent\nstandards are achieved and maintained.\n\n- The Guangdong experience should be used to develop uniform standards\nthroughout all provinces for preventing the spread of SARS in health care\nfacilities.\n\n- Careful contact tracing of SARS cases is vital to bring the outbreak\nunder control. Detailed interviewing of all newly reported SARS cases by\ntrained interviewers including a full review not only of close contacts but\npotential exposure in other crowded settings, e.g. public transport, needs\nto be routinely carried out. Contacts of cases should be provided with\ndetailed preventive advice verbally and in writing.\n\n- Much better collaboration between virological laboratories in China is\nrequired, particularly to facilitate the exchange of results, specimens,\nand reagents. The following institutions should form the nucleus of a\nnational SARS laboratory network within China:\n- National Institute of Virology, China CDC, Beijing\n- Virology Unit, Beijing Provincial CDC, Beijing\n- Virology Unit, Guangdong Provincial CDC, Guangzhou\n- Department of Virology, Zhongshan University, Guangzhou\nLaboratories from other areas with experience of SARS cases should also be\nincluded. Adequate funding and human resources need to be urgently provided\nto ensure the proper functioning and sustainability of SARS surveillance\nactivities, as they are essential to controlling spread of the disease.\nChinese institutions should form a national SARS laboratory network within\nChina to speed up the exchange of results, specimens, and reagents.\n\n- Guangdong clinicians have cared for the largest number of patients in the\nworld and their experience should be shared with the international\ncommunity through publications, meetings, and in drafting guidelines for\nthe management of SARS patients.\n\nPriority actions\nPriority actions recommended in the report to contain SARS include:\n\n- early recognition and treatment of cases\n\n- stringent infection control measures in hospitals and clinics\n\n- prompt reporting of suspected cases\n\n- meticulous investigation and contact tracing in the community - public\nawareness campaigns and education.\n\n\nHong Kong: heavy burden on the health system\n---------\nWith today\u0092s cumulative total of 970 cases and 27 deaths, Hong Kong\ncontinues to have the largest SARS outbreak, second to China. The strain on\nhealth services and staff is considerable, and strengthened measures of\ninfection control may be needed.\n\nThe isolation order placed on Block E, Amory Gardens will expire at\nmidnight, 9 Apr 2003. The Hong Kong Health Department has announced that\nresidents, temporarily housed at camps, may return home after their flats\nhave been disinfected by the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department.\n\nSingapore: role of \"super-spreaders\"\n----------\nSingapore has increased measures to prevent transmission in hospitals\nfollowing an outbreak in Singapore General Hospital. Measures include\nmandatory temperature checks for all staff, limiting visitors, and\nisolation of all possible SARS cases. The Singapore General Hospital\noutbreak involved over 20 people with suspect symptoms, nearly all nurses\nand doctors. Only 7 have been diagnosed as \"probable\" SARS cases. The\ndistribution of cases over time suggests a point source. The health worker\nconsidered to be the index case in this cluster of cases may be the fourth\n\"super-spreader\" identified in Singapore.\n\nA \"super-spreader\" is a source case who has, for as yet unknown reasons,\ninfected a large number of persons. Although transmission patterns of SARS\nremain incompletely understood, evidence suggests that such\n\"super-spreaders\" may have contributed to the evolution of SARS outbreaks\naround the world.\n\nUntil recently, all cases in Singapore have had good epidemiological links\nto their source. Further work is now required to establish similar links\nfor the more recent cases. If confirmed, such linking of cases will show\nthat transmission is limited to those who are symptomatic and usually very\nill. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that health workers\ncontinue to be the main group diagnosed with SARS. To date, investigation\nof the SARS outbreak in Singapore have revealed few signs of community\nspread beyond family members in close face-to-face contact with patients.\nHowever, these findings are based on limited data on exposures.\n\nViet Nam: no asymptomatic transmission\n--------\nVietnam is now reporting a cumulative total of 62 cases. 4 of these cases\nhave been detected in the last few days following stable reporting of 58\ncases for several consecutive days. The stable number of cases raised hope\nthat the outbreak in the French hospital in Hanoi had been contained.\nHowever, a 59th case was reported on 31 Mar 2003.\n\nThis male patient had been in contact with his daughter, who was a patient\nat the French Hospital at the time of Viet Nam\u0092s index case. This contact\ncontinued when the daughter became an outpatient. The daughter\u0092s husband,\nwho attended the Hanoi French Hospital with his wife, had a mild febrile\nillness which was undiagnosed at the time and which resolved spontaneously.\nIt is presumed that he had mild SARS and passed the infection to his\nfather-in-law (case 59). Assuming this to be true, WHO epidemiologists\nmaintain the view that asymptomatic transmission does not appear to occur.\nNor does this case suggest a longer incubation period than currently\nassumed (2-7 days, with 10 days considered the rare maximum). Blood is\nbeing taken for testing of the husband. Case 60 is a doctor who cared for\ncase 59 while he was in a provincial hospital about 1.5 hours from Hanoi.\nCases 61 and 62 are young women who are part of the extended household who\nprovided considerable care for case 59.\n\nWHO continues to work with the Ministry of Health to investigate the\ncontacts of these cases. It is anticipated that a few more new cases will\nbe linked to case 59. Careful monitoring of contacts continues.\n\nOf the 62 cases, 44 have been discharged, 4 have died, and 14 remain in\nhospital. One of the hospitalized patients remains critically ill, although\nslightly improved. All other hospitalized patients are improving.\n\nCanada: one new probable case reported\n--------\nHealth Canada has reported a cumulative total of 94 probable cases and 10\ndeaths. Ontario has reported 91 probable cases. All cases have occurred in\npersons who have traveled to Asia or had contact with SARS cases in the\nhousehold or in a health-care setting. The remaining probable cases are in\nBritish Columbia (3).\n\nUpdate on cases and countries\n-------------\nAs of today, a cumulative total of 2722 cases, with 106 deaths have been\nreported from 16 countries. This represents an increase of 51 cases and 3\ndeaths when compared with yesterday.\n\nNew cases were reported in Canada (3), China (1), Hong Kong SAR (42),\nSingapore (5), and the United States of America (1). The single case\nreported in Australia has been removed from the list. Deaths were reported\nin Hong Kong (2) and Singapore (1).\n\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Trying to synthesize the information contained in the above reports from\nWHO today, there are many positive points. With respect to China, the\nreports on the investigation in Guangdong are promising, and we look\nforward to seeing more epidemiologic and clinical details on the cases from\nthe outbreak. In addition, the collaboration with the Chinese MOH with\nrespect to laboratory studies is also very promising and will provide a\nbank of specimens among which to check diagnostic tests as well as to\nconduct further studies. On the negative side is the concern mentioned\nregarding other provinces' ability to manage an outbreak of SARS, both from\nthe clinical aspects as well as the public health aspects.\n\nFrom today's reported cases, it appears the predominant new case reports\nare coming from Hong Kong. In Singapore, there continues to be\ntransmission, as continuation of the original importations and further\ngenerations of transmission related to those original importations from\nHong Kong. The notion of \"super spreaders\" is further highlighted by the\nSingapore experience, and we look forward to more details from studies of\nthese reported \"super spreaders\". The experience in Viet Nam seems to\nsuggest that transmission does not occur during asymptomatic infection or\nduring the incubation period, but rather after the onset of clinical\nillness. The new cluster of cases is linked to the original outbreak in\nHanoi, with nosocomial spread to a health care worker, suggesting that\nnewly involved areas have not automatically suspected SARS and that a SARS\npatient is initially cared for in the absence of infection control\nprocedures. This begs the question: At what point should all febrile\npatients in the health care setting be initially evaluated using infection\ncontrol procedures, including respiratory barriers to transmission?\n\nThe addition of epidemic curves and geographic mapping of the ongoing SARS\noutbreak is appreciated, as \"a picture is worth 1000 words\" (as was\nevidenced by the amount of words necessary to attempt to describe the\nsignificance of the curves by this moderator). The daily case counts are\neasier to interpret when graphically represented.\n\nProf. Rod Griffiths, the Regional Director of Public Health, Prof. Rod\nGriffiths,West Midlands, UK <Rod@stonebow.demon.co.uk> inquired about\nattack rates -- what proportion of exposed individuals (contacts of\nprobable SARS cases) have gone on to develop SARS themselves. A good\nquestion, but a difficult one to answer in the absence of a definitive\ndiagnostic test for SARS at this point in time. We look forward to seeing\ncrude attack rates when available (taking liberty to refer to estimates of\nattack rates based on current clinical and epidemiologic case definitions,\nrecognizing that in the absence of a definitive diagnostic test these\ncalculations would be estimates as they would not account for asymptomatic\ninfections).\n\nThe removal of Australia from the list of countries reporting SARS cases is\na further reminder that SARS is a diagnosis of exclusion until there is a\ndefinitive diagnostic test that will allow for confirmation of cases, and\nthat there are still many other diagnoses that present with the same\nclinical syndrome as described for SARS. - Mod.MPP]\nSee Also\nSARS - worldwide (35):cases 20030408.0858\nSARS - Worldwide (34): etiology 20030408.0857\nSARS - Worldwide (33): cases 20030407.0850\nSARS - worldwide (31): etiology 20030405.0833\nSARS - worldwide (28): overview 20030403.0822\nSARS - worldwide (26): etiology 20030403.0819\nSARS - worldwide (19): etiology 20030330.0786\nSARS - Worldwide (16): Etiology 20030328.0774\nSARS - worldwide (14): overview 20030327.0769\nSARS - worldwide (13): etiology 20030327.0758\nSARS - worldwide (10): infectious disease perspectives 20030326.0752\nSARS - worldwide (04): etiology 20030325.0737\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - worldwide (17) 20030322.0713\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - Worldwide: alert (03) 20030316.0660\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - Worldwide (02):alert 20030315.0649\nSevere Acute Respiratory Syndrome - Worldwide 20030315.0637\nAcute respiratory syndrome - Canada (Ontario) 20030314.0631\nAcute respiratory syndrome - East Asia 20030314.0630\nAcute respiratory syndrome - China (HK), VietNam (03) 20030313.0624\nUndiagnosed illness - Vietnam (Hanoi): RFI 20030311.0595\nPneumonia - China (Guangdong) (07) 20030221.0452\nPneumonia - China (Guangdong): RFI 20030210.0357\n...........................mpp/pg/mpp\n\n*##########################################################*\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.

There are\nmultiple curves, representing the global outbreak, and then outbreaks by\ncountry for Hong Kong, Viet Nam, Singapore, Canada, the United States, and\nthe European Region. Reviewing the curves, when looking at the epidemic\ncurve by date of onset, it does appear as though the global outbreak may\nhave already peaked, although this curve represents a small fraction of\nactual reported probable cases, as dates of onset were not available for\n2105 cases. The date of onset of the most recent reported cases was 1 Apr\n2003, 6 days preceding the last date of notification. In contrast, the\nepidemic curve plotting reported cases by date of report appears to be\nconsistent with ongoing transmission at a steady rate, with a marked\nincrease in numbers of cases reported on 1 Apr 2003 (representing the\ndelayed reports from China) and another significant increase in reported\ncases on 8 Apr 2003.\n\nThe epidemic curve by date of report in Hong Kong suggests that there was a\nlarge peak during the week of 29 Mar 2003, and a second smaller peak during\nthe week of 5 Apr 2003. The epidemic curve by date of onset for Viet Nam\nsuggests that there was a peak during the week of 8 Mar 2003, and apparent\ninterruption of transmission (or missed cases, or one incubation period\npending appearance of new cases) during the week of 29 Mar 2003 and the\nappearance of a few cases during the week of 5 Apr 2003. The epidemic\ncurve, by date of onset for Singapore shows a clear peak in cases during\nthe period 15-22 Mar 2003 and a significant tapering off of cases by the\nweek 5 Apr 2003. The epidemic curve, by date of onset, for Canada shows a\nclear peak during the period 15-22 Mar 2003, with continued transmission\nbut at a lower rate. There have not been any cases reported with dates of\nonset since 4 Apr 2003 in Canada. The epidemic curve, by date of onset\n(current as of 4 Apr 2003), for the United States shows several peak\nperiods of cases, during the weeks of 15 Mar 2003, 22 Mar 2003, and 29 Mar\n2003. The maximum number of cases with dates of onset on a single day was\n9 on 17 Mar 2003. (We do not have information on the dates of onset of the\nfew healthcare workers and family members that were contacts of imported\ncases, but the overwhelming majority of cases reported in the United States\nwere in individuals with a history of travel to affected areas (see section\n[B] above). There have not been any cases reported with dates of onset\nsince 30 Mar 2003, representing a 5-day period without new cases. In\ncontrast, the epidemic curve by date of onset for the European Region is\nmore consistent with sporadic case reports, with a maximum of one or 2\ncases per day. To date there have not been reports of any secondary\ntransmission in the European Region. - Mod.MPP]\n\n\n[D] Update 25 - Interim report of WHO team in China, status of the main\nSARS outbreaks in different countries 9 Apr 2003\n<http://www.who.int/csr/sarsarchive/2003_04_09/en/>\n\n[ProMED-mail would like to express our continuing gratitude to Marianne\nHopp <mjhopp12@yahoo.com> for her daily monitoring of WHO reports. - Mod.MPP]\n\n\nChina\n------\nThe WHO team of experts presented its interim report on the SARS outbreak\nin Guangdong Province this morning to the Chinese Ministry of Health and\nVice Premier Wu Yi in Beijing. The team began its investigations in\nGuangdong on 3 Apr 2003.\n\nThe team concluded that the health system in Guangdong responded well to\nthe outbreak. The province has a health system in which every hospital at\nevery level reports any new cases of SARS. The WHO report therefore\nconcluded that virtually all probable cases of SARS presenting at a\nhospital in Guangdong Province will be detected and rapidly reported.\n\nHowever, the team found an urgent need to improve surveillance in the\ncountryside to head off new outbreaks in rural areas. The team was further\nconcerned by an increase in sporadic cases, which could not be linked to a\nparticular transmission chain, as such cases raised questions about the\nadequacy of contact tracing.\n\nIn addition, the report noted many remaining concerns about the ability of\nother provinces, where health systems are not as strong as the one in\nGuangdong, to respond promptly and effectively to the challenge of SARS.\n\nIn Beijing, for example, only a minority of hospitals make daily reports of\nSARS cases. Contact tracing is another problem in Beijing and does not\nappear to be carried out systematically. Failure to perform careful contact\ntracing will allow the disease to spread.\n\nThe team observed that many of China\u0092s poorer provinces may not have\nadequate resources, facilities, and equipment to cope with outbreaks of\nSARS, and underscored that Guangdong\u0092s capacity was exceptional among\nChina\u0092s provinces.\n\nIn Guangdong, the SARS outbreak placed an enormous strain on the health\ncare system. The Guangdong Infectious Disease Hospital (Guangzhou No. 8\nPeople\u0092s Hospital) had 150 of its 400 beds occupied by SARS patients daily\nduring the second week of February [2003]. The team noted that the response\nof the health care system has been exemplary, and commended the dedication\nand bravery of doctors, nurses, and others working in clinics and hospitals.\n\nMicrobiological findings\n----------\nLarge banks of stored specimens from suspected and probable SARS cases,\nfrom case contacts as well as from \u0093normal controls\u0094 exist at the\ninstitutions visited and are stored under suitable conditions; detailed\ninformation about the numbers and types of these specimens are available\nand were provided to members of the WHO team. Although the patient data on\neach of these is very limited, it is sufficient to allow linkage with the\nvery detailed epidemiological and clinical information held elsewhere in\nGuangdong Provincial Centers for Disease Control and the hospitals.\n\nThese specimen banks comprise different types of respiratory specimens from\nwhich the detection of agents can be attempted and serum samples, often as\npaired acute and convalescent sera (i.e., the first sample obtained during\nthe acute phase of the illness and the second during recovery), which will\nallow determination of seroconversions. The laboratory staff agreed that\nonce a causative agent for SARS was identified, these banks should be\ntested and will provide very valuable information; they seemed, however,\nless sure whether this time had come already, i.e. whether there was\nalready sufficient evidence and whether suitable tests had been developed\nelsewhere that would make such an exercise worthwhile. They requested\nassistance from the WHO team to obtain relevant information on primer\nsequences and other matters as well as access to suitable experimental\ntests such as immunofluorescence antibody assays.\n\nMain recommendations\n---------\nThe interim report made several major recommendations, including the following:\n\n- The SARS reporting system established in Guangdong is an excellent model\nthat all provinces should follow. Team members suggest that the MOH ensures\nthat all provinces are brought up to Guangdong standards by implementing\nthis system nationwide as a matter of the utmost urgency. A programme for\nevaluating and accrediting surveillance systems through evaluation by\ntechnical experts is also suggested in order to ensure that consistent\nstandards are achieved and maintained.\n\n- The Guangdong experience should be used to develop uniform standards\nthroughout all provinces for preventing the spread of SARS in health care\nfacilities.\n\n- Careful contact tracing of SARS cases is vital to bring the outbreak\nunder control. Detailed interviewing of all newly reported SARS cases by\ntrained interviewers including a full review not only of close contacts but\npotential exposure in other crowded settings, e.g. public transport, needs\nto be routinely carried out. Contacts of cases should be provided with\ndetailed preventive advice verbally and in writing.\n\n- Much better collaboration between virological laboratories in China is\nrequired, particularly to facilitate the exchange of results, specimens,\nand reagents. The following institutions should form the nucleus of a\nnational SARS laboratory network within China:\n- National Institute of Virology, China CDC, Beijing\n- Virology Unit, Beijing Provincial CDC, Beijing\n- Virology Unit, Guangdong Provincial CDC, Guangzhou\n- Department of Virology, Zhongshan University, Guangzhou\nLaboratories from other areas with experience of SARS cases should also be\nincluded. Adequate funding and human resources need to be urgently provided\nto ensure the proper functioning and sustainability of SARS surveillance\nactivities, as they are essential to controlling spread of the disease.\nChinese institutions should form a national SARS laboratory network within\nChina to speed up the exchange of results, specimens, and reagents.\n\n- Guangdong clinicians have cared for the largest number of patients in the\nworld and their experience should be shared with the international\ncommunity through publications, meetings, and in drafting guidelines for\nthe management of SARS patients.\n\nPriority actions\nPriority actions recommended in the report to contain SARS include:\n\n- early recognition and treatment of cases\n\n- stringent infection control measures in hospitals and clinics\n\n- prompt reporting of suspected cases\n\n- meticulous investigation and contact tracing in the community - public\nawareness campaigns and education.\n\n\nHong Kong: heavy burden on the health system\n---------\nWith today\u0092s cumulative total of 970 cases and 27 deaths, Hong Kong\ncontinues to have the largest SARS outbreak, second to China. The strain on\nhealth services and staff is considerable, and strengthened measures of\ninfection control may be needed.\n\nThe isolation order placed on Block E, Amory Gardens will expire at\nmidnight, 9 Apr 2003. The Hong Kong Health Department has announced that\nresidents, temporarily housed at camps, may return home after their flats\nhave been disinfected by the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department.\n\nSingapore: role of \"super-spreaders\"\n----------\nSingapore has increased measures to prevent transmission in hospitals\nfollowing an outbreak in Singapore General Hospital. Measures include\nmandatory temperature checks for all staff, limiting visitors, and\nisolation of all possible SARS cases. The Singapore General Hospital\noutbreak involved over 20 people with suspect symptoms, nearly all nurses\nand doctors. Only 7 have been diagnosed as \"probable\" SARS cases. The\ndistribution of cases over time suggests a point source. The health worker\nconsidered to be the index case in this cluster of cases may be the fourth\n\"super-spreader\" identified in Singapore.\n\nA \"super-spreader\" is a source case who has, for as yet unknown reasons,\ninfected a large number of persons. Although transmission patterns of SARS\nremain incompletely understood, evidence suggests that such\n\"super-spreaders\" may have contributed to the evolution of SARS outbreaks\naround the world.\n\nUntil recently, all cases in Singapore have had good epidemiological links\nto their source. Further work is now required to establish similar links\nfor the more recent cases. If confirmed, such linking of cases will show\nthat transmission is limited to those who are symptomatic and usually very\nill. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that health workers\ncontinue to be the main group diagnosed with SARS. To date, investigation\nof the SARS outbreak in Singapore have revealed few signs of community\nspread beyond family members in close face-to-face contact with patients.\nHowever, these findings are based on limited data on exposures.\n\nViet Nam: no asymptomatic transmission\n--------\nVietnam is now reporting a cumulative total of 62 cases. 4 of these cases\nhave been detected in the last few days following stable reporting of 58\ncases for several consecutive days. The stable number of cases raised hope\nthat the outbreak in the French hospital in Hanoi had been contained.\nHowever, a 59th case was reported on 31 Mar 2003.\n\nThis male patient had been in contact with his daughter, who was a patient\nat the French Hospital at the time of Viet Nam\u0092s index case. This contact\ncontinued when the daughter became an outpatient. The daughter\u0092s husband,\nwho attended the Hanoi French Hospital with his wife, had a mild febrile\nillness which was undiagnosed at the time and which resolved spontaneously.\nIt is presumed that he had mild SARS and passed the infection to his\nfather-in-law (case 59). Assuming this to be true, WHO epidemiologists\nmaintain the view that asymptomatic transmission does not appear to occur.\nNor does this case suggest a longer incubation period than currently\nassumed (2-7 days, with 10 days considered the rare maximum). Blood is\nbeing taken for testing of the husband. Case 60 is a doctor who cared for\ncase 59 while he was in a provincial hospital about 1.5 hours from Hanoi.\nCases 61 and 62 are young women who are part of the extended household who\nprovided considerable care for case 59.\n\nWHO continues to work with the Ministry of Health to investigate the\ncontacts of these cases. It is anticipated that a few more new cases will\nbe linked to case 59. Careful monitoring of contacts continues.\n\nOf the 62 cases, 44 have been discharged, 4 have died, and 14 remain in\nhospital. One of the hospitalized patients remains critically ill, although\nslightly improved. All other hospitalized patients are improving.\n\nCanada: one new probable case reported\n--------\nHealth Canada has reported a cumulative total of 94 probable cases and 10\ndeaths. Ontario has reported 91 probable cases. All cases have occurred in\npersons who have traveled to Asia or had contact with SARS cases in the\nhousehold or in a health-care setting. The remaining probable cases are in\nBritish Columbia (3).\n\nUpdate on cases and countries\n-------------\nAs of today, a cumulative total of 2722 cases, with 106 deaths have been\nreported from 16 countries. This represents an increase of 51 cases and 3\ndeaths when compared with yesterday.\n\nNew cases were reported in Canada (3), China (1), Hong Kong SAR (42),\nSingapore (5), and the United States of America (1). The single case\nreported in Australia has been removed from the list. Deaths were reported\nin Hong Kong (2) and Singapore (1).\n\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Trying to synthesize the information contained in the above reports from\nWHO today, there are many positive points. With respect to China, the\nreports on the investigation in Guangdong are promising, and we look\nforward to seeing more epidemiologic and clinical details on the cases from\nthe outbreak. In addition, the collaboration with the Chinese MOH with\nrespect to laboratory studies is also very promising and will provide a\nbank of specimens among which to check diagnostic tests as well as to\nconduct further studies. On the negative side is the concern mentioned\nregarding other provinces' ability to manage an outbreak of SARS, both from\nthe clinical aspects as well as the public health aspects.\n\nFrom today's reported cases, it appears the predominant new case reports\nare coming from Hong Kong. In Singapore, there continues to be\ntransmission, as continuation of the original importations and further\ngenerations of transmission related to those original importations from\nHong Kong. The notion of \"super spreaders\" is further highlighted by the\nSingapore experience, and we look forward to more details from studies of\nthese reported \"super spreaders\". The experience in Viet Nam seems to\nsuggest that transmission does not occur during asymptomatic infection or\nduring the incubation period, but rather after the onset of clinical\nillness. The new cluster of cases is linked to the original outbreak in\nHanoi, with nosocomial spread to a health care worker, suggesting that\nnewly involved areas have not automatically suspected SARS and that a SARS\npatient is initially cared for in the absence of infection control\nprocedures. This begs the question: At what point should all febrile\npatients in the health care setting be initially evaluated using infection\ncontrol procedures, including respiratory barriers to transmission?\n\nThe addition of epidemic curves and geographic mapping of the ongoing SARS\noutbreak is appreciated, as \"a picture is worth 1000 words\" (as was\nevidenced by the amount of words necessary to attempt to describe the\nsignificance of the curves by this moderator). The daily case counts are\neasier to interpret when graphically represented.\n\nProf. Rod Griffiths, the Regional Director of Public Health, Prof. Rod\nGriffiths,West Midlands, UK <Rod@stonebow.demon.co.uk> inquired about\nattack rates -- what proportion of exposed individuals (contacts of\nprobable SARS cases) have gone on to develop SARS themselves. A good\nquestion, but a difficult one to answer in the absence of a definitive\ndiagnostic test for SARS at this point in time. We look forward to seeing\ncrude attack rates when available (taking liberty to refer to estimates of\nattack rates based on current clinical and epidemiologic case definitions,\nrecognizing that in the absence of a definitive diagnostic test these\ncalculations would be estimates as they would not account for asymptomatic\ninfections).\n\nThe removal of Australia from the list of countries reporting SARS cases is\na further reminder that SARS is a diagnosis of exclusion until there is a\ndefinitive diagnostic test that will allow for confirmation of cases, and\nthat there are still many other diagnoses that present with the same\nclinical syndrome as described for SARS. - Mod.MPP]\nSee Also\nSARS - worldwide (35):cases 20030408.0858\nSARS - Worldwide (34): etiology 20030408.0857\nSARS - Worldwide (33): cases 20030407.0850\nSARS - worldwide (31): etiology 20030405.0833\nSARS - worldwide (28): overview 20030403.0822\nSARS - worldwide (26): etiology 20030403.0819\nSARS - worldwide (19): etiology 20030330.0786\nSARS - Worldwide (16): Etiology 20030328.0774\nSARS - worldwide (14): overview 20030327.0769\nSARS - worldwide (13): etiology 20030327.0758\nSARS - worldwide (10): infectious disease perspectives 20030326.0752\nSARS - worldwide (04): etiology 20030325.0737\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - worldwide (17) 20030322.0713\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - Worldwide: alert (03) 20030316.0660\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - Worldwide (02):alert 20030315.0649\nSevere Acute Respiratory Syndrome - Worldwide 20030315.0637\nAcute respiratory syndrome - Canada (Ontario) 20030314.0631\nAcute respiratory syndrome - East Asia 20030314.0630\nAcute respiratory syndrome - China (HK), VietNam (03) 20030313.0624\nUndiagnosed illness - Vietnam (Hanoi): RFI 20030311.0595\nPneumonia - China (Guangdong) (07) 20030221.0452\nPneumonia - China (Guangdong): RFI 20030210.0357\n...........................mpp/pg/mpp\n\n*##########################################################*\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.

There are\nmultiple curves, representing the global outbreak, and then outbreaks by\ncountry for Hong Kong, Viet Nam, Singapore, Canada, the United States, and\nthe European Region. Reviewing the curves, when looking at the epidemic\ncurve by date of onset, it does appear as though the global outbreak may\nhave already peaked, although this curve represents a small fraction of\nactual reported probable cases, as dates of onset were not available for\n2105 cases. The date of onset of the most recent reported cases was 1 Apr\n2003, 6 days preceding the last date of notification. In contrast, the\nepidemic curve plotting reported cases by date of report appears to be\nconsistent with ongoing transmission at a steady rate, with a marked\nincrease in numbers of cases reported on 1 Apr 2003 (representing the\ndelayed reports from China) and another significant increase in reported\ncases on 8 Apr 2003.\n\nThe epidemic curve by date of report in Hong Kong suggests that there was a\nlarge peak during the week of 29 Mar 2003, and a second smaller peak during\nthe week of 5 Apr 2003. The epidemic curve by date of onset for Viet Nam\nsuggests that there was a peak during the week of 8 Mar 2003, and apparent\ninterruption of transmission (or missed cases, or one incubation period\npending appearance of new cases) during the week of 29 Mar 2003 and the\nappearance of a few cases during the week of 5 Apr 2003. The epidemic\ncurve, by date of onset for Singapore shows a clear peak in cases during\nthe period 15-22 Mar 2003 and a significant tapering off of cases by the\nweek 5 Apr 2003. The epidemic curve, by date of onset, for Canada shows a\nclear peak during the period 15-22 Mar 2003, with continued transmission\nbut at a lower rate. There have not been any cases reported with dates of\nonset since 4 Apr 2003 in Canada. The epidemic curve, by date of onset\n(current as of 4 Apr 2003), for the United States shows several peak\nperiods of cases, during the weeks of 15 Mar 2003, 22 Mar 2003, and 29 Mar\n2003. The maximum number of cases with dates of onset on a single day was\n9 on 17 Mar 2003. (We do not have information on the dates of onset of the\nfew healthcare workers and family members that were contacts of imported\ncases, but the overwhelming majority of cases reported in the United States\nwere in individuals with a history of travel to affected areas (see section\n[B] above). There have not been any cases reported with dates of onset\nsince 30 Mar 2003, representing a 5-day period without new cases. In\ncontrast, the epidemic curve by date of onset for the European Region is\nmore consistent with sporadic case reports, with a maximum of one or 2\ncases per day. To date there have not been reports of any secondary\ntransmission in the European Region. - Mod.MPP]\n\n\n[D] Update 25 - Interim report of WHO team in China, status of the main\nSARS outbreaks in different countries 9 Apr 2003\n<http://www.who.int/csr/sarsarchive/2003_04_09/en/>\n\n[ProMED-mail would like to express our continuing gratitude to Marianne\nHopp <mjhopp12@yahoo.com> for her daily monitoring of WHO reports. - Mod.MPP]\n\n\nChina\n------\nThe WHO team of experts presented its interim report on the SARS outbreak\nin Guangdong Province this morning to the Chinese Ministry of Health and\nVice Premier Wu Yi in Beijing. The team began its investigations in\nGuangdong on 3 Apr 2003.\n\nThe team concluded that the health system in Guangdong responded well to\nthe outbreak. The province has a health system in which every hospital at\nevery level reports any new cases of SARS. The WHO report therefore\nconcluded that virtually all probable cases of SARS presenting at a\nhospital in Guangdong Province will be detected and rapidly reported.\n\nHowever, the team found an urgent need to improve surveillance in the\ncountryside to head off new outbreaks in rural areas. The team was further\nconcerned by an increase in sporadic cases, which could not be linked to a\nparticular transmission chain, as such cases raised questions about the\nadequacy of contact tracing.\n\nIn addition, the report noted many remaining concerns about the ability of\nother provinces, where health systems are not as strong as the one in\nGuangdong, to respond promptly and effectively to the challenge of SARS.\n\nIn Beijing, for example, only a minority of hospitals make daily reports of\nSARS cases. Contact tracing is another problem in Beijing and does not\nappear to be carried out systematically. Failure to perform careful contact\ntracing will allow the disease to spread.\n\nThe team observed that many of China\u0092s poorer provinces may not have\nadequate resources, facilities, and equipment to cope with outbreaks of\nSARS, and underscored that Guangdong\u0092s capacity was exceptional among\nChina\u0092s provinces.\n\nIn Guangdong, the SARS outbreak placed an enormous strain on the health\ncare system. The Guangdong Infectious Disease Hospital (Guangzhou No. 8\nPeople\u0092s Hospital) had 150 of its 400 beds occupied by SARS patients daily\nduring the second week of February [2003]. The team noted that the response\nof the health care system has been exemplary, and commended the dedication\nand bravery of doctors, nurses, and others working in clinics and hospitals.\n\nMicrobiological findings\n----------\nLarge banks of stored specimens from suspected and probable SARS cases,\nfrom case contacts as well as from \u0093normal controls\u0094 exist at the\ninstitutions visited and are stored under suitable conditions; detailed\ninformation about the numbers and types of these specimens are available\nand were provided to members of the WHO team. Although the patient data on\neach of these is very limited, it is sufficient to allow linkage with the\nvery detailed epidemiological and clinical information held elsewhere in\nGuangdong Provincial Centers for Disease Control and the hospitals.\n\nThese specimen banks comprise different types of respiratory specimens from\nwhich the detection of agents can be attempted and serum samples, often as\npaired acute and convalescent sera (i.e., the first sample obtained during\nthe acute phase of the illness and the second during recovery), which will\nallow determination of seroconversions. The laboratory staff agreed that\nonce a causative agent for SARS was identified, these banks should be\ntested and will provide very valuable information; they seemed, however,\nless sure whether this time had come already, i.e. whether there was\nalready sufficient evidence and whether suitable tests had been developed\nelsewhere that would make such an exercise worthwhile. They requested\nassistance from the WHO team to obtain relevant information on primer\nsequences and other matters as well as access to suitable experimental\ntests such as immunofluorescence antibody assays.\n\nMain recommendations\n---------\nThe interim report made several major recommendations, including the following:\n\n- The SARS reporting system established in Guangdong is an excellent model\nthat all provinces should follow. Team members suggest that the MOH ensures\nthat all provinces are brought up to Guangdong standards by implementing\nthis system nationwide as a matter of the utmost urgency. A programme for\nevaluating and accrediting surveillance systems through evaluation by\ntechnical experts is also suggested in order to ensure that consistent\nstandards are achieved and maintained.\n\n- The Guangdong experience should be used to develop uniform standards\nthroughout all provinces for preventing the spread of SARS in health care\nfacilities.\n\n- Careful contact tracing of SARS cases is vital to bring the outbreak\nunder control. Detailed interviewing of all newly reported SARS cases by\ntrained interviewers including a full review not only of close contacts but\npotential exposure in other crowded settings, e.g. public transport, needs\nto be routinely carried out. Contacts of cases should be provided with\ndetailed preventive advice verbally and in writing.\n\n- Much better collaboration between virological laboratories in China is\nrequired, particularly to facilitate the exchange of results, specimens,\nand reagents. The following institutions should form the nucleus of a\nnational SARS laboratory network within China:\n- National Institute of Virology, China CDC, Beijing\n- Virology Unit, Beijing Provincial CDC, Beijing\n- Virology Unit, Guangdong Provincial CDC, Guangzhou\n- Department of Virology, Zhongshan University, Guangzhou\nLaboratories from other areas with experience of SARS cases should also be\nincluded. Adequate funding and human resources need to be urgently provided\nto ensure the proper functioning and sustainability of SARS surveillance\nactivities, as they are essential to controlling spread of the disease.\nChinese institutions should form a national SARS laboratory network within\nChina to speed up the exchange of results, specimens, and reagents.\n\n- Guangdong clinicians have cared for the largest number of patients in the\nworld and their experience should be shared with the international\ncommunity through publications, meetings, and in drafting guidelines for\nthe management of SARS patients.\n\nPriority actions\nPriority actions recommended in the report to contain SARS include:\n\n- early recognition and treatment of cases\n\n- stringent infection control measures in hospitals and clinics\n\n- prompt reporting of suspected cases\n\n- meticulous investigation and contact tracing in the community - public\nawareness campaigns and education.\n\n\nHong Kong: heavy burden on the health system\n---------\nWith today\u0092s cumulative total of 970 cases and 27 deaths, Hong Kong\ncontinues to have the largest SARS outbreak, second to China. The strain on\nhealth services and staff is considerable, and strengthened measures of\ninfection control may be needed.\n\nThe isolation order placed on Block E, Amory Gardens will expire at\nmidnight, 9 Apr 2003. The Hong Kong Health Department has announced that\nresidents, temporarily housed at camps, may return home after their flats\nhave been disinfected by the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department.\n\nSingapore: role of \"super-spreaders\"\n----------\nSingapore has increased measures to prevent transmission in hospitals\nfollowing an outbreak in Singapore General Hospital. Measures include\nmandatory temperature checks for all staff, limiting visitors, and\nisolation of all possible SARS cases. The Singapore General Hospital\noutbreak involved over 20 people with suspect symptoms, nearly all nurses\nand doctors. Only 7 have been diagnosed as \"probable\" SARS cases. The\ndistribution of cases over time suggests a point source. The health worker\nconsidered to be the index case in this cluster of cases may be the fourth\n\"super-spreader\" identified in Singapore.\n\nA \"super-spreader\" is a source case who has, for as yet unknown reasons,\ninfected a large number of persons. Although transmission patterns of SARS\nremain incompletely understood, evidence suggests that such\n\"super-spreaders\" may have contributed to the evolution of SARS outbreaks\naround the world.\n\nUntil recently, all cases in Singapore have had good epidemiological links\nto their source. Further work is now required to establish similar links\nfor the more recent cases. If confirmed, such linking of cases will show\nthat transmission is limited to those who are symptomatic and usually very\nill. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that health workers\ncontinue to be the main group diagnosed with SARS. To date, investigation\nof the SARS outbreak in Singapore have revealed few signs of community\nspread beyond family members in close face-to-face contact with patients.\nHowever, these findings are based on limited data on exposures.\n\nViet Nam: no asymptomatic transmission\n--------\nVietnam is now reporting a cumulative total of 62 cases. 4 of these cases\nhave been detected in the last few days following stable reporting of 58\ncases for several consecutive days. The stable number of cases raised hope\nthat the outbreak in the French hospital in Hanoi had been contained.\nHowever, a 59th case was reported on 31 Mar 2003.\n\nThis male patient had been in contact with his daughter, who was a patient\nat the French Hospital at the time of Viet Nam\u0092s index case. This contact\ncontinued when the daughter became an outpatient. The daughter\u0092s husband,\nwho attended the Hanoi French Hospital with his wife, had a mild febrile\nillness which was undiagnosed at the time and which resolved spontaneously.\nIt is presumed that he had mild SARS and passed the infection to his\nfather-in-law (case 59). Assuming this to be true, WHO epidemiologists\nmaintain the view that asymptomatic transmission does not appear to occur.\nNor does this case suggest a longer incubation period than currently\nassumed (2-7 days, with 10 days considered the rare maximum). Blood is\nbeing taken for testing of the husband. Case 60 is a doctor who cared for\ncase 59 while he was in a provincial hospital about 1.5 hours from Hanoi.\nCases 61 and 62 are young women who are part of the extended household who\nprovided considerable care for case 59.\n\nWHO continues to work with the Ministry of Health to investigate the\ncontacts of these cases. It is anticipated that a few more new cases will\nbe linked to case 59. Careful monitoring of contacts continues.\n\nOf the 62 cases, 44 have been discharged, 4 have died, and 14 remain in\nhospital. One of the hospitalized patients remains critically ill, although\nslightly improved. All other hospitalized patients are improving.\n\nCanada: one new probable case reported\n--------\nHealth Canada has reported a cumulative total of 94 probable cases and 10\ndeaths. Ontario has reported 91 probable cases. All cases have occurred in\npersons who have traveled to Asia or had contact with SARS cases in the\nhousehold or in a health-care setting. The remaining probable cases are in\nBritish Columbia (3).\n\nUpdate on cases and countries\n-------------\nAs of today, a cumulative total of 2722 cases, with 106 deaths have been\nreported from 16 countries. This represents an increase of 51 cases and 3\ndeaths when compared with yesterday.\n\nNew cases were reported in Canada (3), China (1), Hong Kong SAR (42),\nSingapore (5), and the United States of America (1). The single case\nreported in Australia has been removed from the list. Deaths were reported\nin Hong Kong (2) and Singapore (1).\n\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Trying to synthesize the information contained in the above reports from\nWHO today, there are many positive points. With respect to China, the\nreports on the investigation in Guangdong are promising, and we look\nforward to seeing more epidemiologic and clinical details on the cases from\nthe outbreak. In addition, the collaboration with the Chinese MOH with\nrespect to laboratory studies is also very promising and will provide a\nbank of specimens among which to check diagnostic tests as well as to\nconduct further studies. On the negative side is the concern mentioned\nregarding other provinces' ability to manage an outbreak of SARS, both from\nthe clinical aspects as well as the public health aspects.\n\nFrom today's reported cases, it appears the predominant new case reports\nare coming from Hong Kong. In Singapore, there continues to be\ntransmission, as continuation of the original importations and further\ngenerations of transmission related to those original importations from\nHong Kong. The notion of \"super spreaders\" is further highlighted by the\nSingapore experience, and we look forward to more details from studies of\nthese reported \"super spreaders\". The experience in Viet Nam seems to\nsuggest that transmission does not occur during asymptomatic infection or\nduring the incubation period, but rather after the onset of clinical\nillness. The new cluster of cases is linked to the original outbreak in\nHanoi, with nosocomial spread to a health care worker, suggesting that\nnewly involved areas have not automatically suspected SARS and that a SARS\npatient is initially cared for in the absence of infection control\nprocedures. This begs the question: At what point should all febrile\npatients in the health care setting be initially evaluated using infection\ncontrol procedures, including respiratory barriers to transmission?\n\nThe addition of epidemic curves and geographic mapping of the ongoing SARS\noutbreak is appreciated, as \"a picture is worth 1000 words\" (as was\nevidenced by the amount of words necessary to attempt to describe the\nsignificance of the curves by this moderator). The daily case counts are\neasier to interpret when graphically represented.\n\nProf. Rod Griffiths, the Regional Director of Public Health, Prof. Rod\nGriffiths,West Midlands, UK <Rod@stonebow.demon.co.uk> inquired about\nattack rates -- what proportion of exposed individuals (contacts of\nprobable SARS cases) have gone on to develop SARS themselves. A good\nquestion, but a difficult one to answer in the absence of a definitive\ndiagnostic test for SARS at this point in time. We look forward to seeing\ncrude attack rates when available (taking liberty to refer to estimates of\nattack rates based on current clinical and epidemiologic case definitions,\nrecognizing that in the absence of a definitive diagnostic test these\ncalculations would be estimates as they would not account for asymptomatic\ninfections).\n\nThe removal of Australia from the list of countries reporting SARS cases is\na further reminder that SARS is a diagnosis of exclusion until there is a\ndefinitive diagnostic test that will allow for confirmation of cases, and\nthat there are still many other diagnoses that present with the same\nclinical syndrome as described for SARS. - Mod.MPP]\nSee Also\nSARS - worldwide (35):cases 20030408.0858\nSARS - Worldwide (34): etiology 20030408.0857\nSARS - Worldwide (33): cases 20030407.0850\nSARS - worldwide (31): etiology 20030405.0833\nSARS - worldwide (28): overview 20030403.0822\nSARS - worldwide (26): etiology 20030403.0819\nSARS - worldwide (19): etiology 20030330.0786\nSARS - Worldwide (16): Etiology 20030328.0774\nSARS - worldwide (14): overview 20030327.0769\nSARS - worldwide (13): etiology 20030327.0758\nSARS - worldwide (10): infectious disease perspectives 20030326.0752\nSARS - worldwide (04): etiology 20030325.0737\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - worldwide (17) 20030322.0713\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - Worldwide: alert (03) 20030316.0660\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - Worldwide (02):alert 20030315.0649\nSevere Acute Respiratory Syndrome - Worldwide 20030315.0637\nAcute respiratory syndrome - Canada (Ontario) 20030314.0631\nAcute respiratory syndrome - East Asia 20030314.0630\nAcute respiratory syndrome - China (HK), VietNam (03) 20030313.0624\nUndiagnosed illness - Vietnam (Hanoi): RFI 20030311.0595\nPneumonia - China (Guangdong) (07) 20030221.0452\nPneumonia - China (Guangdong): RFI 20030210.0357\n...........................mpp/pg/mpp\n\n*##########################################################*\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.

There are\nmultiple curves, representing the global outbreak, and then outbreaks by\ncountry for Hong Kong, Viet Nam, Singapore, Canada, the United States, and\nthe European Region. Reviewing the curves, when looking at the epidemic\ncurve by date of onset, it does appear as though the global outbreak may\nhave already peaked, although this curve represents a small fraction of\nactual reported probable cases, as dates of onset were not available for\n2105 cases. The date of onset of the most recent reported cases was 1 Apr\n2003, 6 days preceding the last date of notification. In contrast, the\nepidemic curve plotting reported cases by date of report appears to be\nconsistent with ongoing transmission at a steady rate, with a marked\nincrease in numbers of cases reported on 1 Apr 2003 (representing the\ndelayed reports from China) and another significant increase in reported\ncases on 8 Apr 2003.\n\nThe epidemic curve by date of report in Hong Kong suggests that there was a\nlarge peak during the week of 29 Mar 2003, and a second smaller peak during\nthe week of 5 Apr 2003. The epidemic curve by date of onset for Viet Nam\nsuggests that there was a peak during the week of 8 Mar 2003, and apparent\ninterruption of transmission (or missed cases, or one incubation period\npending appearance of new cases) during the week of 29 Mar 2003 and the\nappearance of a few cases during the week of 5 Apr 2003. The epidemic\ncurve, by date of onset for Singapore shows a clear peak in cases during\nthe period 15-22 Mar 2003 and a significant tapering off of cases by the\nweek 5 Apr 2003. The epidemic curve, by date of onset, for Canada shows a\nclear peak during the period 15-22 Mar 2003, with continued transmission\nbut at a lower rate. There have not been any cases reported with dates of\nonset since 4 Apr 2003 in Canada. The epidemic curve, by date of onset\n(current as of 4 Apr 2003), for the United States shows several peak\nperiods of cases, during the weeks of 15 Mar 2003, 22 Mar 2003, and 29 Mar\n2003. The maximum number of cases with dates of onset on a single day was\n9 on 17 Mar 2003. (We do not have information on the dates of onset of the\nfew healthcare workers and family members that were contacts of imported\ncases, but the overwhelming majority of cases reported in the United States\nwere in individuals with a history of travel to affected areas (see section\n[B] above). There have not been any cases reported with dates of onset\nsince 30 Mar 2003, representing a 5-day period without new cases. In\ncontrast, the epidemic curve by date of onset for the European Region is\nmore consistent with sporadic case reports, with a maximum of one or 2\ncases per day. To date there have not been reports of any secondary\ntransmission in the European Region. - Mod.MPP]\n\n\n[D] Update 25 - Interim report of WHO team in China, status of the main\nSARS outbreaks in different countries 9 Apr 2003\n<http://www.who.int/csr/sarsarchive/2003_04_09/en/>\n\n[ProMED-mail would like to express our continuing gratitude to Marianne\nHopp <mjhopp12@yahoo.com> for her daily monitoring of WHO reports. - Mod.MPP]\n\n\nChina\n------\nThe WHO team of experts presented its interim report on the SARS outbreak\nin Guangdong Province this morning to the Chinese Ministry of Health and\nVice Premier Wu Yi in Beijing. The team began its investigations in\nGuangdong on 3 Apr 2003.\n\nThe team concluded that the health system in Guangdong responded well to\nthe outbreak. The province has a health system in which every hospital at\nevery level reports any new cases of SARS. The WHO report therefore\nconcluded that virtually all probable cases of SARS presenting at a\nhospital in Guangdong Province will be detected and rapidly reported.\n\nHowever, the team found an urgent need to improve surveillance in the\ncountryside to head off new outbreaks in rural areas. The team was further\nconcerned by an increase in sporadic cases, which could not be linked to a\nparticular transmission chain, as such cases raised questions about the\nadequacy of contact tracing.\n\nIn addition, the report noted many remaining concerns about the ability of\nother provinces, where health systems are not as strong as the one in\nGuangdong, to respond promptly and effectively to the challenge of SARS.\n\nIn Beijing, for example, only a minority of hospitals make daily reports of\nSARS cases. Contact tracing is another problem in Beijing and does not\nappear to be carried out systematically. Failure to perform careful contact\ntracing will allow the disease to spread.\n\nThe team observed that many of China\u0092s poorer provinces may not have\nadequate resources, facilities, and equipment to cope with outbreaks of\nSARS, and underscored that Guangdong\u0092s capacity was exceptional among\nChina\u0092s provinces.\n\nIn Guangdong, the SARS outbreak placed an enormous strain on the health\ncare system. The Guangdong Infectious Disease Hospital (Guangzhou No. 8\nPeople\u0092s Hospital) had 150 of its 400 beds occupied by SARS patients daily\nduring the second week of February [2003]. The team noted that the response\nof the health care system has been exemplary, and commended the dedication\nand bravery of doctors, nurses, and others working in clinics and hospitals.\n\nMicrobiological findings\n----------\nLarge banks of stored specimens from suspected and probable SARS cases,\nfrom case contacts as well as from \u0093normal controls\u0094 exist at the\ninstitutions visited and are stored under suitable conditions; detailed\ninformation about the numbers and types of these specimens are available\nand were provided to members of the WHO team. Although the patient data on\neach of these is very limited, it is sufficient to allow linkage with the\nvery detailed epidemiological and clinical information held elsewhere in\nGuangdong Provincial Centers for Disease Control and the hospitals.\n\nThese specimen banks comprise different types of respiratory specimens from\nwhich the detection of agents can be attempted and serum samples, often as\npaired acute and convalescent sera (i.e., the first sample obtained during\nthe acute phase of the illness and the second during recovery), which will\nallow determination of seroconversions. The laboratory staff agreed that\nonce a causative agent for SARS was identified, these banks should be\ntested and will provide very valuable information; they seemed, however,\nless sure whether this time had come already, i.e. whether there was\nalready sufficient evidence and whether suitable tests had been developed\nelsewhere that would make such an exercise worthwhile. They requested\nassistance from the WHO team to obtain relevant information on primer\nsequences and other matters as well as access to suitable experimental\ntests such as immunofluorescence antibody assays.\n\nMain recommendations\n---------\nThe interim report made several major recommendations, including the following:\n\n- The SARS reporting system established in Guangdong is an excellent model\nthat all provinces should follow. Team members suggest that the MOH ensures\nthat all provinces are brought up to Guangdong standards by implementing\nthis system nationwide as a matter of the utmost urgency. A programme for\nevaluating and accrediting surveillance systems through evaluation by\ntechnical experts is also suggested in order to ensure that consistent\nstandards are achieved and maintained.\n\n- The Guangdong experience should be used to develop uniform standards\nthroughout all provinces for preventing the spread of SARS in health care\nfacilities.\n\n- Careful contact tracing of SARS cases is vital to bring the outbreak\nunder control. Detailed interviewing of all newly reported SARS cases by\ntrained interviewers including a full review not only of close contacts but\npotential exposure in other crowded settings, e.g. public transport, needs\nto be routinely carried out. Contacts of cases should be provided with\ndetailed preventive advice verbally and in writing.\n\n- Much better collaboration between virological laboratories in China is\nrequired, particularly to facilitate the exchange of results, specimens,\nand reagents. The following institutions should form the nucleus of a\nnational SARS laboratory network within China:\n- National Institute of Virology, China CDC, Beijing\n- Virology Unit, Beijing Provincial CDC, Beijing\n- Virology Unit, Guangdong Provincial CDC, Guangzhou\n- Department of Virology, Zhongshan University, Guangzhou\nLaboratories from other areas with experience of SARS cases should also be\nincluded. Adequate funding and human resources need to be urgently provided\nto ensure the proper functioning and sustainability of SARS surveillance\nactivities, as they are essential to controlling spread of the disease.\nChinese institutions should form a national SARS laboratory network within\nChina to speed up the exchange of results, specimens, and reagents.\n\n- Guangdong clinicians have cared for the largest number of patients in the\nworld and their experience should be shared with the international\ncommunity through publications, meetings, and in drafting guidelines for\nthe management of SARS patients.\n\nPriority actions\nPriority actions recommended in the report to contain SARS include:\n\n- early recognition and treatment of cases\n\n- stringent infection control measures in hospitals and clinics\n\n- prompt reporting of suspected cases\n\n- meticulous investigation and contact tracing in the community - public\nawareness campaigns and education.\n\n\nHong Kong: heavy burden on the health system\n---------\nWith today\u0092s cumulative total of 970 cases and 27 deaths, Hong Kong\ncontinues to have the largest SARS outbreak, second to China. The strain on\nhealth services and staff is considerable, and strengthened measures of\ninfection control may be needed.\n\nThe isolation order placed on Block E, Amory Gardens will expire at\nmidnight, 9 Apr 2003. The Hong Kong Health Department has announced that\nresidents, temporarily housed at camps, may return home after their flats\nhave been disinfected by the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department.\n\nSingapore: role of \"super-spreaders\"\n----------\nSingapore has increased measures to prevent transmission in hospitals\nfollowing an outbreak in Singapore General Hospital. Measures include\nmandatory temperature checks for all staff, limiting visitors, and\nisolation of all possible SARS cases. The Singapore General Hospital\noutbreak involved over 20 people with suspect symptoms, nearly all nurses\nand doctors. Only 7 have been diagnosed as \"probable\" SARS cases. The\ndistribution of cases over time suggests a point source. The health worker\nconsidered to be the index case in this cluster of cases may be the fourth\n\"super-spreader\" identified in Singapore.\n\nA \"super-spreader\" is a source case who has, for as yet unknown reasons,\ninfected a large number of persons. Although transmission patterns of SARS\nremain incompletely understood, evidence suggests that such\n\"super-spreaders\" may have contributed to the evolution of SARS outbreaks\naround the world.\n\nUntil recently, all cases in Singapore have had good epidemiological links\nto their source. Further work is now required to establish similar links\nfor the more recent cases. If confirmed, such linking of cases will show\nthat transmission is limited to those who are symptomatic and usually very\nill. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that health workers\ncontinue to be the main group diagnosed with SARS. To date, investigation\nof the SARS outbreak in Singapore have revealed few signs of community\nspread beyond family members in close face-to-face contact with patients.\nHowever, these findings are based on limited data on exposures.\n\nViet Nam: no asymptomatic transmission\n--------\nVietnam is now reporting a cumulative total of 62 cases. 4 of these cases\nhave been detected in the last few days following stable reporting of 58\ncases for several consecutive days. The stable number of cases raised hope\nthat the outbreak in the French hospital in Hanoi had been contained.\nHowever, a 59th case was reported on 31 Mar 2003.\n\nThis male patient had been in contact with his daughter, who was a patient\nat the French Hospital at the time of Viet Nam\u0092s index case. This contact\ncontinued when the daughter became an outpatient. The daughter\u0092s husband,\nwho attended the Hanoi French Hospital with his wife, had a mild febrile\nillness which was undiagnosed at the time and which resolved spontaneously.\nIt is presumed that he had mild SARS and passed the infection to his\nfather-in-law (case 59). Assuming this to be true, WHO epidemiologists\nmaintain the view that asymptomatic transmission does not appear to occur.\nNor does this case suggest a longer incubation period than currently\nassumed (2-7 days, with 10 days considered the rare maximum). Blood is\nbeing taken for testing of the husband. Case 60 is a doctor who cared for\ncase 59 while he was in a provincial hospital about 1.5 hours from Hanoi.\nCases 61 and 62 are young women who are part of the extended household who\nprovided considerable care for case 59.\n\nWHO continues to work with the Ministry of Health to investigate the\ncontacts of these cases. It is anticipated that a few more new cases will\nbe linked to case 59. Careful monitoring of contacts continues.\n\nOf the 62 cases, 44 have been discharged, 4 have died, and 14 remain in\nhospital. One of the hospitalized patients remains critically ill, although\nslightly improved. All other hospitalized patients are improving.\n\nCanada: one new probable case reported\n--------\nHealth Canada has reported a cumulative total of 94 probable cases and 10\ndeaths. Ontario has reported 91 probable cases. All cases have occurred in\npersons who have traveled to Asia or had contact with SARS cases in the\nhousehold or in a health-care setting. The remaining probable cases are in\nBritish Columbia (3).\n\nUpdate on cases and countries\n-------------\nAs of today, a cumulative total of 2722 cases, with 106 deaths have been\nreported from 16 countries. This represents an increase of 51 cases and 3\ndeaths when compared with yesterday.\n\nNew cases were reported in Canada (3), China (1), Hong Kong SAR (42),\nSingapore (5), and the United States of America (1). The single case\nreported in Australia has been removed from the list. Deaths were reported\nin Hong Kong (2) and Singapore (1).\n\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Trying to synthesize the information contained in the above reports from\nWHO today, there are many positive points. With respect to China, the\nreports on the investigation in Guangdong are promising, and we look\nforward to seeing more epidemiologic and clinical details on the cases from\nthe outbreak. In addition, the collaboration with the Chinese MOH with\nrespect to laboratory studies is also very promising and will provide a\nbank of specimens among which to check diagnostic tests as well as to\nconduct further studies. On the negative side is the concern mentioned\nregarding other provinces' ability to manage an outbreak of SARS, both from\nthe clinical aspects as well as the public health aspects.\n\nFrom today's reported cases, it appears the predominant new case reports\nare coming from Hong Kong. In Singapore, there continues to be\ntransmission, as continuation of the original importations and further\ngenerations of transmission related to those original importations from\nHong Kong. The notion of \"super spreaders\" is further highlighted by the\nSingapore experience, and we look forward to more details from studies of\nthese reported \"super spreaders\". The experience in Viet Nam seems to\nsuggest that transmission does not occur during asymptomatic infection or\nduring the incubation period, but rather after the onset of clinical\nillness. The new cluster of cases is linked to the original outbreak in\nHanoi, with nosocomial spread to a health care worker, suggesting that\nnewly involved areas have not automatically suspected SARS and that a SARS\npatient is initially cared for in the absence of infection control\nprocedures. This begs the question: At what point should all febrile\npatients in the health care setting be initially evaluated using infection\ncontrol procedures, including respiratory barriers to transmission?\n\nThe addition of epidemic curves and geographic mapping of the ongoing SARS\noutbreak is appreciated, as \"a picture is worth 1000 words\" (as was\nevidenced by the amount of words necessary to attempt to describe the\nsignificance of the curves by this moderator). The daily case counts are\neasier to interpret when graphically represented.\n\nProf. Rod Griffiths, the Regional Director of Public Health, Prof. Rod\nGriffiths,West Midlands, UK <Rod@stonebow.demon.co.uk> inquired about\nattack rates -- what proportion of exposed individuals (contacts of\nprobable SARS cases) have gone on to develop SARS themselves. A good\nquestion, but a difficult one to answer in the absence of a definitive\ndiagnostic test for SARS at this point in time. We look forward to seeing\ncrude attack rates when available (taking liberty to refer to estimates of\nattack rates based on current clinical and epidemiologic case definitions,\nrecognizing that in the absence of a definitive diagnostic test these\ncalculations would be estimates as they would not account for asymptomatic\ninfections).\n\nThe removal of Australia from the list of countries reporting SARS cases is\na further reminder that SARS is a diagnosis of exclusion until there is a\ndefinitive diagnostic test that will allow for confirmation of cases, and\nthat there are still many other diagnoses that present with the same\nclinical syndrome as described for SARS. - Mod.MPP]\nSee Also\nSARS - worldwide (35):cases 20030408.0858\nSARS - Worldwide (34): etiology 20030408.0857\nSARS - Worldwide (33): cases 20030407.0850\nSARS - worldwide (31): etiology 20030405.0833\nSARS - worldwide (28): overview 20030403.0822\nSARS - worldwide (26): etiology 20030403.0819\nSARS - worldwide (19): etiology 20030330.0786\nSARS - Worldwide (16): Etiology 20030328.0774\nSARS - worldwide (14): overview 20030327.0769\nSARS - worldwide (13): etiology 20030327.0758\nSARS - worldwide (10): infectious disease perspectives 20030326.0752\nSARS - worldwide (04): etiology 20030325.0737\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - worldwide (17) 20030322.0713\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - Worldwide: alert (03) 20030316.0660\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - Worldwide (02):alert 20030315.0649\nSevere Acute Respiratory Syndrome - Worldwide 20030315.0637\nAcute respiratory syndrome - Canada (Ontario) 20030314.0631\nAcute respiratory syndrome - East Asia 20030314.0630\nAcute respiratory syndrome - China (HK), VietNam (03) 20030313.0624\nUndiagnosed illness - Vietnam (Hanoi): RFI 20030311.0595\nPneumonia - China (Guangdong) (07) 20030221.0452\nPneumonia - China (Guangdong): RFI 20030210.0357\n...........................mpp/pg/mpp\n\n*##########################################################*\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.

There are\nmultiple curves, representing the global outbreak, and then outbreaks by\ncountry for Hong Kong, Viet Nam, Singapore, Canada, the United States, and\nthe European Region. Reviewing the curves, when looking at the epidemic\ncurve by date of onset, it does appear as though the global outbreak may\nhave already peaked, although this curve represents a small fraction of\nactual reported probable cases, as dates of onset were not available for\n2105 cases. The date of onset of the most recent reported cases was 1 Apr\n2003, 6 days preceding the last date of notification. In contrast, the\nepidemic curve plotting reported cases by date of report appears to be\nconsistent with ongoing transmission at a steady rate, with a marked\nincrease in numbers of cases reported on 1 Apr 2003 (representing the\ndelayed reports from China) and another significant increase in reported\ncases on 8 Apr 2003.\n\nThe epidemic curve by date of report in Hong Kong suggests that there was a\nlarge peak during the week of 29 Mar 2003, and a second smaller peak during\nthe week of 5 Apr 2003. The epidemic curve by date of onset for Viet Nam\nsuggests that there was a peak during the week of 8 Mar 2003, and apparent\ninterruption of transmission (or missed cases, or one incubation period\npending appearance of new cases) during the week of 29 Mar 2003 and the\nappearance of a few cases during the week of 5 Apr 2003. The epidemic\ncurve, by date of onset for Singapore shows a clear peak in cases during\nthe period 15-22 Mar 2003 and a significant tapering off of cases by the\nweek 5 Apr 2003. The epidemic curve, by date of onset, for Canada shows a\nclear peak during the period 15-22 Mar 2003, with continued transmission\nbut at a lower rate. There have not been any cases reported with dates of\nonset since 4 Apr 2003 in Canada. The epidemic curve, by date of onset\n(current as of 4 Apr 2003), for the United States shows several peak\nperiods of cases, during the weeks of 15 Mar 2003, 22 Mar 2003, and 29 Mar\n2003. The maximum number of cases with dates of onset on a single day was\n9 on 17 Mar 2003. (We do not have information on the dates of onset of the\nfew healthcare workers and family members that were contacts of imported\ncases, but the overwhelming majority of cases reported in the United States\nwere in individuals with a history of travel to affected areas (see section\n[B] above). There have not been any cases reported with dates of onset\nsince 30 Mar 2003, representing a 5-day period without new cases. In\ncontrast, the epidemic curve by date of onset for the European Region is\nmore consistent with sporadic case reports, with a maximum of one or 2\ncases per day. To date there have not been reports of any secondary\ntransmission in the European Region. - Mod.MPP]\n\n\n[D] Update 25 - Interim report of WHO team in China, status of the main\nSARS outbreaks in different countries 9 Apr 2003\n<http://www.who.int/csr/sarsarchive/2003_04_09/en/>\n\n[ProMED-mail would like to express our continuing gratitude to Marianne\nHopp <mjhopp12@yahoo.com> for her daily monitoring of WHO reports. - Mod.MPP]\n\n\nChina\n------\nThe WHO team of experts presented its interim report on the SARS outbreak\nin Guangdong Province this morning to the Chinese Ministry of Health and\nVice Premier Wu Yi in Beijing. The team began its investigations in\nGuangdong on 3 Apr 2003.\n\nThe team concluded that the health system in Guangdong responded well to\nthe outbreak. The province has a health system in which every hospital at\nevery level reports any new cases of SARS. The WHO report therefore\nconcluded that virtually all probable cases of SARS presenting at a\nhospital in Guangdong Province will be detected and rapidly reported.\n\nHowever, the team found an urgent need to improve surveillance in the\ncountryside to head off new outbreaks in rural areas. The team was further\nconcerned by an increase in sporadic cases, which could not be linked to a\nparticular transmission chain, as such cases raised questions about the\nadequacy of contact tracing.\n\nIn addition, the report noted many remaining concerns about the ability of\nother provinces, where health systems are not as strong as the one in\nGuangdong, to respond promptly and effectively to the challenge of SARS.\n\nIn Beijing, for example, only a minority of hospitals make daily reports of\nSARS cases. Contact tracing is another problem in Beijing and does not\nappear to be carried out systematically. Failure to perform careful contact\ntracing will allow the disease to spread.\n\nThe team observed that many of China\u0092s poorer provinces may not have\nadequate resources, facilities, and equipment to cope with outbreaks of\nSARS, and underscored that Guangdong\u0092s capacity was exceptional among\nChina\u0092s provinces.\n\nIn Guangdong, the SARS outbreak placed an enormous strain on the health\ncare system. The Guangdong Infectious Disease Hospital (Guangzhou No. 8\nPeople\u0092s Hospital) had 150 of its 400 beds occupied by SARS patients daily\nduring the second week of February [2003]. The team noted that the response\nof the health care system has been exemplary, and commended the dedication\nand bravery of doctors, nurses, and others working in clinics and hospitals.\n\nMicrobiological findings\n----------\nLarge banks of stored specimens from suspected and probable SARS cases,\nfrom case contacts as well as from \u0093normal controls\u0094 exist at the\ninstitutions visited and are stored under suitable conditions; detailed\ninformation about the numbers and types of these specimens are available\nand were provided to members of the WHO team. Although the patient data on\neach of these is very limited, it is sufficient to allow linkage with the\nvery detailed epidemiological and clinical information held elsewhere in\nGuangdong Provincial Centers for Disease Control and the hospitals.\n\nThese specimen banks comprise different types of respiratory specimens from\nwhich the detection of agents can be attempted and serum samples, often as\npaired acute and convalescent sera (i.e., the first sample obtained during\nthe acute phase of the illness and the second during recovery), which will\nallow determination of seroconversions. The laboratory staff agreed that\nonce a causative agent for SARS was identified, these banks should be\ntested and will provide very valuable information; they seemed, however,\nless sure whether this time had come already, i.e. whether there was\nalready sufficient evidence and whether suitable tests had been developed\nelsewhere that would make such an exercise worthwhile. They requested\nassistance from the WHO team to obtain relevant information on primer\nsequences and other matters as well as access to suitable experimental\ntests such as immunofluorescence antibody assays.\n\nMain recommendations\n---------\nThe interim report made several major recommendations, including the following:\n\n- The SARS reporting system established in Guangdong is an excellent model\nthat all provinces should follow. Team members suggest that the MOH ensures\nthat all provinces are brought up to Guangdong standards by implementing\nthis system nationwide as a matter of the utmost urgency. A programme for\nevaluating and accrediting surveillance systems through evaluation by\ntechnical experts is also suggested in order to ensure that consistent\nstandards are achieved and maintained.\n\n- The Guangdong experience should be used to develop uniform standards\nthroughout all provinces for preventing the spread of SARS in health care\nfacilities.\n\n- Careful contact tracing of SARS cases is vital to bring the outbreak\nunder control. Detailed interviewing of all newly reported SARS cases by\ntrained interviewers including a full review not only of close contacts but\npotential exposure in other crowded settings, e.g. public transport, needs\nto be routinely carried out. Contacts of cases should be provided with\ndetailed preventive advice verbally and in writing.\n\n- Much better collaboration between virological laboratories in China is\nrequired, particularly to facilitate the exchange of results, specimens,\nand reagents. The following institutions should form the nucleus of a\nnational SARS laboratory network within China:\n- National Institute of Virology, China CDC, Beijing\n- Virology Unit, Beijing Provincial CDC, Beijing\n- Virology Unit, Guangdong Provincial CDC, Guangzhou\n- Department of Virology, Zhongshan University, Guangzhou\nLaboratories from other areas with experience of SARS cases should also be\nincluded. Adequate funding and human resources need to be urgently provided\nto ensure the proper functioning and sustainability of SARS surveillance\nactivities, as they are essential to controlling spread of the disease.\nChinese institutions should form a national SARS laboratory network within\nChina to speed up the exchange of results, specimens, and reagents.\n\n- Guangdong clinicians have cared for the largest number of patients in the\nworld and their experience should be shared with the international\ncommunity through publications, meetings, and in drafting guidelines for\nthe management of SARS patients.\n\nPriority actions\nPriority actions recommended in the report to contain SARS include:\n\n- early recognition and treatment of cases\n\n- stringent infection control measures in hospitals and clinics\n\n- prompt reporting of suspected cases\n\n- meticulous investigation and contact tracing in the community - public\nawareness campaigns and education.\n\n\nHong Kong: heavy burden on the health system\n---------\nWith today\u0092s cumulative total of 970 cases and 27 deaths, Hong Kong\ncontinues to have the largest SARS outbreak, second to China. The strain on\nhealth services and staff is considerable, and strengthened measures of\ninfection control may be needed.\n\nThe isolation order placed on Block E, Amory Gardens will expire at\nmidnight, 9 Apr 2003. The Hong Kong Health Department has announced that\nresidents, temporarily housed at camps, may return home after their flats\nhave been disinfected by the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department.\n\nSingapore: role of \"super-spreaders\"\n----------\nSingapore has increased measures to prevent transmission in hospitals\nfollowing an outbreak in Singapore General Hospital. Measures include\nmandatory temperature checks for all staff, limiting visitors, and\nisolation of all possible SARS cases. The Singapore General Hospital\noutbreak involved over 20 people with suspect symptoms, nearly all nurses\nand doctors. Only 7 have been diagnosed as \"probable\" SARS cases. The\ndistribution of cases over time suggests a point source. The health worker\nconsidered to be the index case in this cluster of cases may be the fourth\n\"super-spreader\" identified in Singapore.\n\nA \"super-spreader\" is a source case who has, for as yet unknown reasons,\ninfected a large number of persons. Although transmission patterns of SARS\nremain incompletely understood, evidence suggests that such\n\"super-spreaders\" may have contributed to the evolution of SARS outbreaks\naround the world.\n\nUntil recently, all cases in Singapore have had good epidemiological links\nto their source. Further work is now required to establish similar links\nfor the more recent cases. If confirmed, such linking of cases will show\nthat transmission is limited to those who are symptomatic and usually very\nill. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that health workers\ncontinue to be the main group diagnosed with SARS. To date, investigation\nof the SARS outbreak in Singapore have revealed few signs of community\nspread beyond family members in close face-to-face contact with patients.\nHowever, these findings are based on limited data on exposures.\n\nViet Nam: no asymptomatic transmission\n--------\nVietnam is now reporting a cumulative total of 62 cases. 4 of these cases\nhave been detected in the last few days following stable reporting of 58\ncases for several consecutive days. The stable number of cases raised hope\nthat the outbreak in the French hospital in Hanoi had been contained.\nHowever, a 59th case was reported on 31 Mar 2003.\n\nThis male patient had been in contact with his daughter, who was a patient\nat the French Hospital at the time of Viet Nam\u0092s index case. This contact\ncontinued when the daughter became an outpatient. The daughter\u0092s husband,\nwho attended the Hanoi French Hospital with his wife, had a mild febrile\nillness which was undiagnosed at the time and which resolved spontaneously.\nIt is presumed that he had mild SARS and passed the infection to his\nfather-in-law (case 59). Assuming this to be true, WHO epidemiologists\nmaintain the view that asymptomatic transmission does not appear to occur.\nNor does this case suggest a longer incubation period than currently\nassumed (2-7 days, with 10 days considered the rare maximum). Blood is\nbeing taken for testing of the husband. Case 60 is a doctor who cared for\ncase 59 while he was in a provincial hospital about 1.5 hours from Hanoi.\nCases 61 and 62 are young women who are part of the extended household who\nprovided considerable care for case 59.\n\nWHO continues to work with the Ministry of Health to investigate the\ncontacts of these cases. It is anticipated that a few more new cases will\nbe linked to case 59. Careful monitoring of contacts continues.\n\nOf the 62 cases, 44 have been discharged, 4 have died, and 14 remain in\nhospital. One of the hospitalized patients remains critically ill, although\nslightly improved. All other hospitalized patients are improving.\n\nCanada: one new probable case reported\n--------\nHealth Canada has reported a cumulative total of 94 probable cases and 10\ndeaths. Ontario has reported 91 probable cases. All cases have occurred in\npersons who have traveled to Asia or had contact with SARS cases in the\nhousehold or in a health-care setting. The remaining probable cases are in\nBritish Columbia (3).\n\nUpdate on cases and countries\n-------------\nAs of today, a cumulative total of 2722 cases, with 106 deaths have been\nreported from 16 countries. This represents an increase of 51 cases and 3\ndeaths when compared with yesterday.\n\nNew cases were reported in Canada (3), China (1), Hong Kong SAR (42),\nSingapore (5), and the United States of America (1). The single case\nreported in Australia has been removed from the list. Deaths were reported\nin Hong Kong (2) and Singapore (1).\n\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Trying to synthesize the information contained in the above reports from\nWHO today, there are many positive points. With respect to China, the\nreports on the investigation in Guangdong are promising, and we look\nforward to seeing more epidemiologic and clinical details on the cases from\nthe outbreak. In addition, the collaboration with the Chinese MOH with\nrespect to laboratory studies is also very promising and will provide a\nbank of specimens among which to check diagnostic tests as well as to\nconduct further studies. On the negative side is the concern mentioned\nregarding other provinces' ability to manage an outbreak of SARS, both from\nthe clinical aspects as well as the public health aspects.\n\nFrom today's reported cases, it appears the predominant new case reports\nare coming from Hong Kong. In Singapore, there continues to be\ntransmission, as continuation of the original importations and further\ngenerations of transmission related to those original importations from\nHong Kong. The notion of \"super spreaders\" is further highlighted by the\nSingapore experience, and we look forward to more details from studies of\nthese reported \"super spreaders\". The experience in Viet Nam seems to\nsuggest that transmission does not occur during asymptomatic infection or\nduring the incubation period, but rather after the onset of clinical\nillness. The new cluster of cases is linked to the original outbreak in\nHanoi, with nosocomial spread to a health care worker, suggesting that\nnewly involved areas have not automatically suspected SARS and that a SARS\npatient is initially cared for in the absence of infection control\nprocedures. This begs the question: At what point should all febrile\npatients in the health care setting be initially evaluated using infection\ncontrol procedures, including respiratory barriers to transmission?\n\nThe addition of epidemic curves and geographic mapping of the ongoing SARS\noutbreak is appreciated, as \"a picture is worth 1000 words\" (as was\nevidenced by the amount of words necessary to attempt to describe the\nsignificance of the curves by this moderator). The daily case counts are\neasier to interpret when graphically represented.\n\nProf. Rod Griffiths, the Regional Director of Public Health, Prof. Rod\nGriffiths,West Midlands, UK <Rod@stonebow.demon.co.uk> inquired about\nattack rates -- what proportion of exposed individuals (contacts of\nprobable SARS cases) have gone on to develop SARS themselves. A good\nquestion, but a difficult one to answer in the absence of a definitive\ndiagnostic test for SARS at this point in time. We look forward to seeing\ncrude attack rates when available (taking liberty to refer to estimates of\nattack rates based on current clinical and epidemiologic case definitions,\nrecognizing that in the absence of a definitive diagnostic test these\ncalculations would be estimates as they would not account for asymptomatic\ninfections).\n\nThe removal of Australia from the list of countries reporting SARS cases is\na further reminder that SARS is a diagnosis of exclusion until there is a\ndefinitive diagnostic test that will allow for confirmation of cases, and\nthat there are still many other diagnoses that present with the same\nclinical syndrome as described for SARS. - Mod.MPP]\nSee Also\nSARS - worldwide (35):cases 20030408.0858\nSARS - Worldwide (34): etiology 20030408.0857\nSARS - Worldwide (33): cases 20030407.0850\nSARS - worldwide (31): etiology 20030405.0833\nSARS - worldwide (28): overview 20030403.0822\nSARS - worldwide (26): etiology 20030403.0819\nSARS - worldwide (19): etiology 20030330.0786\nSARS - Worldwide (16): Etiology 20030328.0774\nSARS - worldwide (14): overview 20030327.0769\nSARS - worldwide (13): etiology 20030327.0758\nSARS - worldwide (10): infectious disease perspectives 20030326.0752\nSARS - worldwide (04): etiology 20030325.0737\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - worldwide (17) 20030322.0713\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - Worldwide: alert (03) 20030316.0660\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - Worldwide (02):alert 20030315.0649\nSevere Acute Respiratory Syndrome - Worldwide 20030315.0637\nAcute respiratory syndrome - Canada (Ontario) 20030314.0631\nAcute respiratory syndrome - East Asia 20030314.0630\nAcute respiratory syndrome - China (HK), VietNam (03) 20030313.0624\nUndiagnosed illness - Vietnam (Hanoi): RFI 20030311.0595\nPneumonia - China (Guangdong) (07) 20030221.0452\nPneumonia - China (Guangdong): RFI 20030210.0357\n...........................mpp/pg/mpp\n\n*##########################################################*\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.

There are\nmultiple curves, representing the global outbreak, and then outbreaks by\ncountry for Hong Kong, Viet Nam, Singapore, Canada, the United States, and\nthe European Region. Reviewing the curves, when looking at the epidemic\ncurve by date of onset, it does appear as though the global outbreak may\nhave already peaked, although this curve represents a small fraction of\nactual reported probable cases, as dates of onset were not available for\n2105 cases. The date of onset of the most recent reported cases was 1 Apr\n2003, 6 days preceding the last date of notification. In contrast, the\nepidemic curve plotting reported cases by date of report appears to be\nconsistent with ongoing transmission at a steady rate, with a marked\nincrease in numbers of cases reported on 1 Apr 2003 (representing the\ndelayed reports from China) and another significant increase in reported\ncases on 8 Apr 2003.\n\nThe epidemic curve by date of report in Hong Kong suggests that there was a\nlarge peak during the week of 29 Mar 2003, and a second smaller peak during\nthe week of 5 Apr 2003. The epidemic curve by date of onset for Viet Nam\nsuggests that there was a peak during the week of 8 Mar 2003, and apparent\ninterruption of transmission (or missed cases, or one incubation period\npending appearance of new cases) during the week of 29 Mar 2003 and the\nappearance of a few cases during the week of 5 Apr 2003. The epidemic\ncurve, by date of onset for Singapore shows a clear peak in cases during\nthe period 15-22 Mar 2003 and a significant tapering off of cases by the\nweek 5 Apr 2003. The epidemic curve, by date of onset, for Canada shows a\nclear peak during the period 15-22 Mar 2003, with continued transmission\nbut at a lower rate. There have not been any cases reported with dates of\nonset since 4 Apr 2003 in Canada. The epidemic curve, by date of onset\n(current as of 4 Apr 2003), for the United States shows several peak\nperiods of cases, during the weeks of 15 Mar 2003, 22 Mar 2003, and 29 Mar\n2003. The maximum number of cases with dates of onset on a single day was\n9 on 17 Mar 2003. (We do not have information on the dates of onset of the\nfew healthcare workers and family members that were contacts of imported\ncases, but the overwhelming majority of cases reported in the United States\nwere in individuals with a history of travel to affected areas (see section\n[B] above). There have not been any cases reported with dates of onset\nsince 30 Mar 2003, representing a 5-day period without new cases. In\ncontrast, the epidemic curve by date of onset for the European Region is\nmore consistent with sporadic case reports, with a maximum of one or 2\ncases per day. To date there have not been reports of any secondary\ntransmission in the European Region. - Mod.MPP]\n\n\n[D] Update 25 - Interim report of WHO team in China, status of the main\nSARS outbreaks in different countries 9 Apr 2003\n<http://www.who.int/csr/sarsarchive/2003_04_09/en/>\n\n[ProMED-mail would like to express our continuing gratitude to Marianne\nHopp <mjhopp12@yahoo.com> for her daily monitoring of WHO reports. - Mod.MPP]\n\n\nChina\n------\nThe WHO team of experts presented its interim report on the SARS outbreak\nin Guangdong Province this morning to the Chinese Ministry of Health and\nVice Premier Wu Yi in Beijing. The team began its investigations in\nGuangdong on 3 Apr 2003.\n\nThe team concluded that the health system in Guangdong responded well to\nthe outbreak. The province has a health system in which every hospital at\nevery level reports any new cases of SARS. The WHO report therefore\nconcluded that virtually all probable cases of SARS presenting at a\nhospital in Guangdong Province will be detected and rapidly reported.\n\nHowever, the team found an urgent need to improve surveillance in the\ncountryside to head off new outbreaks in rural areas. The team was further\nconcerned by an increase in sporadic cases, which could not be linked to a\nparticular transmission chain, as such cases raised questions about the\nadequacy of contact tracing.\n\nIn addition, the report noted many remaining concerns about the ability of\nother provinces, where health systems are not as strong as the one in\nGuangdong, to respond promptly and effectively to the challenge of SARS.\n\nIn Beijing, for example, only a minority of hospitals make daily reports of\nSARS cases. Contact tracing is another problem in Beijing and does not\nappear to be carried out systematically. Failure to perform careful contact\ntracing will allow the disease to spread.\n\nThe team observed that many of China\u0092s poorer provinces may not have\nadequate resources, facilities, and equipment to cope with outbreaks of\nSARS, and underscored that Guangdong\u0092s capacity was exceptional among\nChina\u0092s provinces.\n\nIn Guangdong, the SARS outbreak placed an enormous strain on the health\ncare system. The Guangdong Infectious Disease Hospital (Guangzhou No. 8\nPeople\u0092s Hospital) had 150 of its 400 beds occupied by SARS patients daily\nduring the second week of February [2003]. The team noted that the response\nof the health care system has been exemplary, and commended the dedication\nand bravery of doctors, nurses, and others working in clinics and hospitals.\n\nMicrobiological findings\n----------\nLarge banks of stored specimens from suspected and probable SARS cases,\nfrom case contacts as well as from \u0093normal controls\u0094 exist at the\ninstitutions visited and are stored under suitable conditions; detailed\ninformation about the numbers and types of these specimens are available\nand were provided to members of the WHO team. Although the patient data on\neach of these is very limited, it is sufficient to allow linkage with the\nvery detailed epidemiological and clinical information held elsewhere in\nGuangdong Provincial Centers for Disease Control and the hospitals.\n\nThese specimen banks comprise different types of respiratory specimens from\nwhich the detection of agents can be attempted and serum samples, often as\npaired acute and convalescent sera (i.e., the first sample obtained during\nthe acute phase of the illness and the second during recovery), which will\nallow determination of seroconversions. The laboratory staff agreed that\nonce a causative agent for SARS was identified, these banks should be\ntested and will provide very valuable information; they seemed, however,\nless sure whether this time had come already, i.e. whether there was\nalready sufficient evidence and whether suitable tests had been developed\nelsewhere that would make such an exercise worthwhile. They requested\nassistance from the WHO team to obtain relevant information on primer\nsequences and other matters as well as access to suitable experimental\ntests such as immunofluorescence antibody assays.\n\nMain recommendations\n---------\nThe interim report made several major recommendations, including the following:\n\n- The SARS reporting system established in Guangdong is an excellent model\nthat all provinces should follow. Team members suggest that the MOH ensures\nthat all provinces are brought up to Guangdong standards by implementing\nthis system nationwide as a matter of the utmost urgency. A programme for\nevaluating and accrediting surveillance systems through evaluation by\ntechnical experts is also suggested in order to ensure that consistent\nstandards are achieved and maintained.\n\n- The Guangdong experience should be used to develop uniform standards\nthroughout all provinces for preventing the spread of SARS in health care\nfacilities.\n\n- Careful contact tracing of SARS cases is vital to bring the outbreak\nunder control. Detailed interviewing of all newly reported SARS cases by\ntrained interviewers including a full review not only of close contacts but\npotential exposure in other crowded settings, e.g. public transport, needs\nto be routinely carried out. Contacts of cases should be provided with\ndetailed preventive advice verbally and in writing.\n\n- Much better collaboration between virological laboratories in China is\nrequired, particularly to facilitate the exchange of results, specimens,\nand reagents. The following institutions should form the nucleus of a\nnational SARS laboratory network within China:\n- National Institute of Virology, China CDC, Beijing\n- Virology Unit, Beijing Provincial CDC, Beijing\n- Virology Unit, Guangdong Provincial CDC, Guangzhou\n- Department of Virology, Zhongshan University, Guangzhou\nLaboratories from other areas with experience of SARS cases should also be\nincluded. Adequate funding and human resources need to be urgently provided\nto ensure the proper functioning and sustainability of SARS surveillance\nactivities, as they are essential to controlling spread of the disease.\nChinese institutions should form a national SARS laboratory network within\nChina to speed up the exchange of results, specimens, and reagents.\n\n- Guangdong clinicians have cared for the largest number of patients in the\nworld and their experience should be shared with the international\ncommunity through publications, meetings, and in drafting guidelines for\nthe management of SARS patients.\n\nPriority actions\nPriority actions recommended in the report to contain SARS include:\n\n- early recognition and treatment of cases\n\n- stringent infection control measures in hospitals and clinics\n\n- prompt reporting of suspected cases\n\n- meticulous investigation and contact tracing in the community - public\nawareness campaigns and education.\n\n\nHong Kong: heavy burden on the health system\n---------\nWith today\u0092s cumulative total of 970 cases and 27 deaths, Hong Kong\ncontinues to have the largest SARS outbreak, second to China. The strain on\nhealth services and staff is considerable, and strengthened measures of\ninfection control may be needed.\n\nThe isolation order placed on Block E, Amory Gardens will expire at\nmidnight, 9 Apr 2003. The Hong Kong Health Department has announced that\nresidents, temporarily housed at camps, may return home after their flats\nhave been disinfected by the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department.\n\nSingapore: role of \"super-spreaders\"\n----------\nSingapore has increased measures to prevent transmission in hospitals\nfollowing an outbreak in Singapore General Hospital. Measures include\nmandatory temperature checks for all staff, limiting visitors, and\nisolation of all possible SARS cases. The Singapore General Hospital\noutbreak involved over 20 people with suspect symptoms, nearly all nurses\nand doctors. Only 7 have been diagnosed as \"probable\" SARS cases. The\ndistribution of cases over time suggests a point source. The health worker\nconsidered to be the index case in this cluster of cases may be the fourth\n\"super-spreader\" identified in Singapore.\n\nA \"super-spreader\" is a source case who has, for as yet unknown reasons,\ninfected a large number of persons. Although transmission patterns of SARS\nremain incompletely understood, evidence suggests that such\n\"super-spreaders\" may have contributed to the evolution of SARS outbreaks\naround the world.\n\nUntil recently, all cases in Singapore have had good epidemiological links\nto their source. Further work is now required to establish similar links\nfor the more recent cases. If confirmed, such linking of cases will show\nthat transmission is limited to those who are symptomatic and usually very\nill. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that health workers\ncontinue to be the main group diagnosed with SARS. To date, investigation\nof the SARS outbreak in Singapore have revealed few signs of community\nspread beyond family members in close face-to-face contact with patients.\nHowever, these findings are based on limited data on exposures.\n\nViet Nam: no asymptomatic transmission\n--------\nVietnam is now reporting a cumulative total of 62 cases. 4 of these cases\nhave been detected in the last few days following stable reporting of 58\ncases for several consecutive days. The stable number of cases raised hope\nthat the outbreak in the French hospital in Hanoi had been contained.\nHowever, a 59th case was reported on 31 Mar 2003.\n\nThis male patient had been in contact with his daughter, who was a patient\nat the French Hospital at the time of Viet Nam\u0092s index case. This contact\ncontinued when the daughter became an outpatient. The daughter\u0092s husband,\nwho attended the Hanoi French Hospital with his wife, had a mild febrile\nillness which was undiagnosed at the time and which resolved spontaneously.\nIt is presumed that he had mild SARS and passed the infection to his\nfather-in-law (case 59). Assuming this to be true, WHO epidemiologists\nmaintain the view that asymptomatic transmission does not appear to occur.\nNor does this case suggest a longer incubation period than currently\nassumed (2-7 days, with 10 days considered the rare maximum). Blood is\nbeing taken for testing of the husband. Case 60 is a doctor who cared for\ncase 59 while he was in a provincial hospital about 1.5 hours from Hanoi.\nCases 61 and 62 are young women who are part of the extended household who\nprovided considerable care for case 59.\n\nWHO continues to work with the Ministry of Health to investigate the\ncontacts of these cases. It is anticipated that a few more new cases will\nbe linked to case 59. Careful monitoring of contacts continues.\n\nOf the 62 cases, 44 have been discharged, 4 have died, and 14 remain in\nhospital. One of the hospitalized patients remains critically ill, although\nslightly improved. All other hospitalized patients are improving.\n\nCanada: one new probable case reported\n--------\nHealth Canada has reported a cumulative total of 94 probable cases and 10\ndeaths. Ontario has reported 91 probable cases. All cases have occurred in\npersons who have traveled to Asia or had contact with SARS cases in the\nhousehold or in a health-care setting. The remaining probable cases are in\nBritish Columbia (3).\n\nUpdate on cases and countries\n-------------\nAs of today, a cumulative total of 2722 cases, with 106 deaths have been\nreported from 16 countries. This represents an increase of 51 cases and 3\ndeaths when compared with yesterday.\n\nNew cases were reported in Canada (3), China (1), Hong Kong SAR (42),\nSingapore (5), and the United States of America (1). The single case\nreported in Australia has been removed from the list. Deaths were reported\nin Hong Kong (2) and Singapore (1).\n\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Trying to synthesize the information contained in the above reports from\nWHO today, there are many positive points. With respect to China, the\nreports on the investigation in Guangdong are promising, and we look\nforward to seeing more epidemiologic and clinical details on the cases from\nthe outbreak. In addition, the collaboration with the Chinese MOH with\nrespect to laboratory studies is also very promising and will provide a\nbank of specimens among which to check diagnostic tests as well as to\nconduct further studies. On the negative side is the concern mentioned\nregarding other provinces' ability to manage an outbreak of SARS, both from\nthe clinical aspects as well as the public health aspects.\n\nFrom today's reported cases, it appears the predominant new case reports\nare coming from Hong Kong. In Singapore, there continues to be\ntransmission, as continuation of the original importations and further\ngenerations of transmission related to those original importations from\nHong Kong. The notion of \"super spreaders\" is further highlighted by the\nSingapore experience, and we look forward to more details from studies of\nthese reported \"super spreaders\". The experience in Viet Nam seems to\nsuggest that transmission does not occur during asymptomatic infection or\nduring the incubation period, but rather after the onset of clinical\nillness. The new cluster of cases is linked to the original outbreak in\nHanoi, with nosocomial spread to a health care worker, suggesting that\nnewly involved areas have not automatically suspected SARS and that a SARS\npatient is initially cared for in the absence of infection control\nprocedures. This begs the question: At what point should all febrile\npatients in the health care setting be initially evaluated using infection\ncontrol procedures, including respiratory barriers to transmission?\n\nThe addition of epidemic curves and geographic mapping of the ongoing SARS\noutbreak is appreciated, as \"a picture is worth 1000 words\" (as was\nevidenced by the amount of words necessary to attempt to describe the\nsignificance of the curves by this moderator). The daily case counts are\neasier to interpret when graphically represented.\n\nProf. Rod Griffiths, the Regional Director of Public Health, Prof. Rod\nGriffiths,West Midlands, UK <Rod@stonebow.demon.co.uk> inquired about\nattack rates -- what proportion of exposed individuals (contacts of\nprobable SARS cases) have gone on to develop SARS themselves. A good\nquestion, but a difficult one to answer in the absence of a definitive\ndiagnostic test for SARS at this point in time. We look forward to seeing\ncrude attack rates when available (taking liberty to refer to estimates of\nattack rates based on current clinical and epidemiologic case definitions,\nrecognizing that in the absence of a definitive diagnostic test these\ncalculations would be estimates as they would not account for asymptomatic\ninfections).\n\nThe removal of Australia from the list of countries reporting SARS cases is\na further reminder that SARS is a diagnosis of exclusion until there is a\ndefinitive diagnostic test that will allow for confirmation of cases, and\nthat there are still many other diagnoses that present with the same\nclinical syndrome as described for SARS. - Mod.MPP]\nSee Also\nSARS - worldwide (35):cases 20030408.0858\nSARS - Worldwide (34): etiology 20030408.0857\nSARS - Worldwide (33): cases 20030407.0850\nSARS - worldwide (31): etiology 20030405.0833\nSARS - worldwide (28): overview 20030403.0822\nSARS - worldwide (26): etiology 20030403.0819\nSARS - worldwide (19): etiology 20030330.0786\nSARS - Worldwide (16): Etiology 20030328.0774\nSARS - worldwide (14): overview 20030327.0769\nSARS - worldwide (13): etiology 20030327.0758\nSARS - worldwide (10): infectious disease perspectives 20030326.0752\nSARS - worldwide (04): etiology 20030325.0737\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - worldwide (17) 20030322.0713\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - Worldwide: alert (03) 20030316.0660\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - Worldwide (02):alert 20030315.0649\nSevere Acute Respiratory Syndrome - Worldwide 20030315.0637\nAcute respiratory syndrome - Canada (Ontario) 20030314.0631\nAcute respiratory syndrome - East Asia 20030314.0630\nAcute respiratory syndrome - China (HK), VietNam (03) 20030313.0624\nUndiagnosed illness - Vietnam (Hanoi): RFI 20030311.0595\nPneumonia - China (Guangdong) (07) 20030221.0452\nPneumonia - China (Guangdong): RFI 20030210.0357\n...........................mpp/pg/mpp\n\n*##########################################################*\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.

Pending development of\nconfirmatory laboratory testing capacity, CDC's interim suspected SARS case\ndefinition (2) is based on clinical criteria and epidemiologic linkage to\nother SARS cases or areas with community transmission of SARS. This case\ndefinition will be updated periodically as new information becomes\navailable. Epidemiologic and laboratory investigations of SARS are ongoing.\nAs of 2 Apr 2003, a total of 2223 suspected and/or probable SARS cases\nhave been reported to WHO from 16 countries, including the United States\n(3,4). The reported SARS cases include 78 deaths (case-fatality proportion:\n3.5 percent). This report summarizes SARS cases among U.S. residents and\nsurveillance and prevention activities in the United States.\nDescriptive Epidemiology\n----------------------\nAs of April 2, CDC had received 100 reports of suspected SARS cases [see\nFigure 1 on webpage for epidemiologic curve\n<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5213a1.htm>] from 28 states; 81\n(81 percent) cases occurred among adults [see table 1 below]. Of these 100\nsuspected cases, 94 (94%) persons had traveled within the 10 days before\nillness onset to the areas listed in the case definition (revised on 29 Mar\n2003 to include all of mainland China as an area with documented or\nsuspected community transmission), 4 had household contact with a person\nwith suspected SARS, and 2 were health-care workers (HCWs) who provided\nmedical care to a patient with suspected SARS.\nManifestations of SARS have been relatively less severe among patients in\nthe United States than among those reported elsewhere. A majority of U.S.\npatients had normal chest radiographs, and 23 (23 percent) were reported to\nhave pneumonia or respiratory distress syndrome on chest radiograph, thereby\nmeeting the WHO case definition of a probable case (4). As of 2 Apr 2003, of\nthe 40 (40 percent) patients who were hospitalized for greater than 24\nhours, 13 (33 percent of 40) remained hospitalized; one patient had required\nmechanical ventilatory support, and no deaths have been reported.\nReports on the clinical status of suspected SARS cases are being received\nby state health departments and CDC, and household and HCW contacts are\nbeing monitored for the possibility of secondary transmission. Since SARS\ninvestigations in the United States began, some persons believed initially\nto have suspected SARS have been excluded on the basis of more complete\nclinical histories (e.g., no documented fever or respiratory symptoms) or\nbecause of testing results that indicated other etiologies. Alternative\ndiagnoses have included infection with influenza virus, respiratory\nsyncytial virus, _Haemophilus influenzae_, _Streptococcus pneumoniae_, and\n_Staphylococcus aureus_. Community transmission of SARS has not been\nidentified in the United States; transmission to HCWs has been observed in\none cluster involving 2 HCWs, compared with numerous reports of possible\ntransmission to HCWs in other countries (5--7).\nEnhanced Surveillance for SARS Related to Travel\n---------------------------------------------\nAs a precautionary measure, WHO has recommended that persons traveling to\nHong Kong and Guangdong Province of China consider postponing all but\nessential travel. CDC has issued a travel advisory recommending that\npersons planning nonessential or elective travel to mainland China, Hong\nKong, Hanoi, or Singapore consider postponing such travel until further\nnotice.\nTo detect possible SARS cases among travelers returning to the United States\nfrom these areas, CDC and state and local health authorities have\nimplemented enhanced surveillance. Since 16 Mar 2003, notices (available in\nEnglish, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Vietnamese) have been provided to\napproximately 220 000 passengers arriving in the United States on airline\nflights originating from China, Vietnam, and Singapore to inform\ndisembarking passengers and crew about SARS. Persons disembarking from these\ncountries are urged to monitor their health for 10 days after return, to\nseek medical care if they develop fever of greater than 100.5 F (39.0 C) and\ncough or difficulty breathing within 10 days of travel, and to inform their\nhealth-care providers about recent travel to regions where SARS cases have\nbeen reported.\nLaboratory Investigations\n----------------------\nEfforts are ongoing to characterize further the role of a previously\nunrecognized coronavirus in SARS. Polymerase chain reaction-based assays,\nisolation studies, electron microscopic studies, and histologic studies are\nbeing developed to detect virus in specimens from patients with suspected\nSARS. Indirect immunoflorescence antibody assays and enzyme immunoassays to\nanti-coronavirus antibody as an indicator of infection have been developed\nand are being applied to specimens from suspected SARS patients. Laboratory\nstudies at CDC and other laboratories in the WHO-organized SARS Laboratory\nNetwork have detected this new coronavirus in SARS patients, which is\nconsistent with an etiologic role in this disease. CDC has detected human\nmetapneumovirus from one SARS patient, and other laboratories also have\ndetected metapneumovirus from SARS patients (6). The role of these viruses\nin the pathogenesis of SARS is unclear.\nMMWR Editorial Note:\n--------------------\nThe number of SARS cases, and the number of countries reporting such cases,\ncontinues to increase worldwide. Transmission within hospitals and\nhouseholds continues in some areas, and transmission within communities\n(e.g., Hong Kong) continues to be reported. In the absence of a complete\nunderstanding of how SARS is transmitted, efforts to limit transmission in\nthe United States have focused on early identification of potential cases\nthrough surveillance and implementation of infection-control measures in\nhealth-care settings and the community.\nCDC has developed interim infection-control guidelines for use in U.S.\nhealth-care and household settings (8). These recommendations are based on\nexperience in the United States to date and will be revised as more\ninformation becomes available. Infection-control practitioners and\nclinicians providing medical care for patients with suspected SARS should\nconsult these guidelines frequently to keep current with recommendations.\nTransmission in health-care settings has been documented in several\ncountries. Transmission to HCWs appears to have occurred primarily after\nclose contact with symptomatic persons before recommended infection-control\nprecautions for SARS were implemented. Because a primary strategy to reduce\ntransmission in health-care settings is early recognition and isolation of\npatients who might have SARS, triage practices in hospitals and\nambulatory-care settings might require reevaluation. CDC guidelines for\ntriage of potential SARS cases are available at\n<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/sars/triage_interim_guidance.htm>.\nIn the United States, decisions to admit persons with suspected SARS to\nhealth-care facilities should be based on clinical criteria. Patients with\nsuspected SARS who are discharged should limit interactions outside the\nhome and not go to work, school, out-of-home child care, or other public\nareas until 10 days after resolution of fever and respiratory symptoms.\nAdditional guidance for these patients is available at\n<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/sars/ic-closecontacts.htm>.\nThe majority of U.S. residents with SARS have recovered or stabilized\nclinically without specific antiviral therapy. The U.S. case-fatality\nproportion is lower than that reported in some other countries (3).\nPossible explanations for this include differing case definitions among\ncountries or differences in the sensitivity of surveillance, leading to\nidentification in the United States of patients with less severe or early\nmanifestations of infection or of a larger proportion of patients with\nother respiratory illnesses. Until confirmatory laboratory testing is\navailable, the case definition will include clinical criteria more likely\nto identify potentially infectious persons. Various therapies, including\nantiviral agents (e.g., oseltamivir or ribavirin) and corticosteroids, have\nbeen administered to SARS patients, but the efficacy of these therapies has\nnot been determined.\nHealth-care providers of patients whose illness is consistent with the case\ndefinition for SARS should continue diagnostic evaluation for other causes\nof respiratory illness and, when appropriate, empiric therapy that includes\nactivity against organisms associated with community-acquired pneumonia of\nuncertain etiology, including both typical and atypical respiratory\npathogens (9). Health-care providers who report suspected SARS cases should\nnotify their state health departments if these patients receive\nconfirmatory testing that indicates a diagnosis other than SARS.\nInformation on suggested diagnostic testing and evaluation for persons with\npossible SARS is available at http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/sars/diagnosis.htm.\nAirline travel\n----------\nThe potential for transmission of SARS during airline travel is unknown.\nTransmission of other infectious agents (e.g., _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_)\nduring air travel has been demonstrated (10). When an airline flight crew\nreports a passenger with respiratory illness, quarantine officials might\nboard the aircraft on arrival in the United States to assess whether the\npassenger's symptoms match the case definition of SARS and give the\npassenger information about following up. If a passenger with suspected\nSARS is identified after passengers have disembarked, public health\nauthorities will work with the airline to contact passengers and crew for\ninformation about the development of an illness suggestive of SARS.\nAlthough ill travelers have spread SARS rapidly across international\nborders, the proportion, if any, of persons who acquired SARS during\ninternational travel as a result of in-flight transmission is unknown.\nDespite vigorous efforts to identify and isolate suspected cases, reducing\ntransmission of the etiologic agents of SARS might be difficult.\nUnderstanding the epidemiology of respiratory pathogens such as those that\ncause SARS is challenging; approximately 40-60 percent of persons with\npneumonia do not have a defined etiology, even when extensive testing for\nknown respiratory pathogens is attempted (9). Minimizing transmission will\nrequire sustained attention to infection-control interventions within\nhealth-care settings and the community. The development of laboratory\ntesting techniques to identify infected persons rapidly will be an\nimportant step toward understanding and reducing transmission of SARS.\nReferences\n--------\n1.

This is an increase of\n4 to 5-fold in the global totals in the last 7 days\n<http://www.who.int/csr/sarscountry/2003_03_25/en/> with the greatest\nproportionate and absolute increases being in China (Hong Kong & Guangdong\nProvince), and to a much lesser extent in Canada. There has been little\nabsolute rise in other country totals.\n18 countries have now reported cases but in most of these no transmission\nseems to have occurred. Local transmission has occurred in Hanoi (Vietnam),\nSingapore, Toronto (Canada), Taiwan, and the following parts of China:\nGuangdong Province;\nBeijing; Shanxi; and Hong Kong SAR. In the United Kingdom 3 probable SARS\ncases have been reported; all have now recovered. Indeed, the only areas\nwhere WHO feels there is evidence consistent with current transmission are\nHong Kong and Guangdong\n<http://www.who.int/csr/sarsarchive/2003_02_02b/en/>, and the WHO has issued\nadvice to international travellers not to travel to or through either area.\nGuangdong and Hong Kong\n--------------------------\nInformation about the outbreaks in Guangdong is limited, but the latest\nreports give a significant increase of over 350 cases during March 2003\n<http://www.who.int/csr/sarsarchive/2003_02_02b/en/>. Detailed\ndescriptions from Hong Kong are now available. Following transmission\ncentering on a large hotel, there have been intense hospital outbreaks\ninvolving staff, patient and families of staff (1) where community\ntransmission has been established. There is now evidence of community\ntransmission within a large housing complex.\nMeasures introduced by Hong Kong, Singapore, and Canada to control the\nlocal spread of SARS have included school closures (Hong Kong and\nSingapore), the quarantine of entire residential buildings (Hong Kong), and\nthe restriction of non-essential access to hospitals -- all 3,\n<http://www.health.gov.on.ca/english/public/pub/disease/sars_6.html>.\nAlthough such precautions are not yet necessary in Europe, the experience\nin Canada is a sobering reminder of what could happen in any country\nreceiving a case.\nOntario, Canada\n---------------\nThe outbreak in Canada began with a Toronto woman who developed respiratory\nsymptoms 2 days after returning from Hong Kong. She died at home 10 days\nlater, but meanwhile appears to have transmitted infection to 4 members of\nher family. One of them, her adult son, was admitted to a local hospital\nwith respiratory symptoms. He spent some time in an open part of the\nemergency department before being transferred to the intensive care unit,\nwhere he remained until his death, 6 days after admission. It is now\napparent that transmission of SARS has occurred within the hospital. A\npatient who was in the next bed in the emergency department developed\nsymptoms of SARS 3 days after his visit to the emergency department, and\ndied 11 days later. A large number of hospital staff who worked in the\nemergency department and the intensive care unit where the son of the index\ncase was cared for have now presented with symptoms of SARS. Transmission\nin the intensive care unit may have been from the patient or from visiting\nfamily members, some of whom were symptomatic at the time they visited (2).\nThe Province of Ontario declared a health emergency on 26 Mar 2003, and on\n1 Apr 2003 a sixth death from SARS was reported from Toronto. As of 1 Apr\n2003, Ontario has reported 51 probable cases of SARS. The hospital has now\nbeen closed to new admissions.\nThe experience in Canada illustrates that highly developed countries can be\nvulnerable to transmission from imported cases of SARS, especially in\nhospitals (3,4). Most of the data have been consistent with transmission\nthrough large droplets or body fluids. Aerosol transmission cannot be\ntotally discounted, but if it occurs it is uncommon. If the causative\norganism had been readily transmissible by aerosol, many more cases would\nhave been expected, especially in the countries where transmission has\nslowed or never started. In Hong Kong there are some patterns of infection\nthat are most easily explained by environmental transmission such as\nfomites.\nIf the infection is not recognised early and appropriate infection control\nprecautions put in place, extensive transmission can occur. Those most at\nrisk seem to be family members and healthcare workers who have close\ncontact with symptomatic cases. It is worth noting that there have been no\nreported secondary cases from 2 hospitalised Canadian SARS cases where\nfamily members were not permitted to visit and healthcare workers adhered\nto strict infection control precautions.\nClinicians, accident and emergency, intensive treatment units, and\ninfectious disease staff in Europe should be alert to the possibility of\nSARS in people with fever and respiratory symptoms, IF they have recently\nreturned from areas where transmission of SARS is ongoing (currently Hong\nKong, and probably Guangdong) or who have had contact with a case of SARS\n<http://www.phls.co.uk/topics_az/SARS/management_guidance.htm>. When\npatients suspected of having SARS are admitted to hospital, it is vital\nthat infection control precautions are rapidly implemented and rigorously\nenforced <http://www.phls.co.uk/topics_az/SARS/hospital_guidance.htm>.\nUpdates on the developing situation are also available from WHO\n(<http://www.who.int/csr/sars/en/>) , on ProMED\n(<http://www.promedmail.org>), and at the websites of various national\npublic health organisations, including CDC\n(<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/sars/>), Health Canada\n(<http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/pphb-dgspsp/sars-sras/index.html>), and the Health\nProtection Agency in the United Kingdom\n(<http://www.phls.org.uk/topics_az/SARS/menu.htm>)(5-7).\nEurosurveillance Weekly welcomes comments on other useful information\nsources, please send\nto elizabeth.hoile@hpa.org.uk.\nReferences:\n1.

Pending development of\nconfirmatory laboratory testing capacity, CDC's interim suspected SARS case\ndefinition (2) is based on clinical criteria and epidemiologic linkage to\nother SARS cases or areas with community transmission of SARS. This case\ndefinition will be updated periodically as new information becomes\navailable. Epidemiologic and laboratory investigations of SARS are ongoing.\nAs of 2 Apr 2003, a total of 2223 suspected and/or probable SARS cases\nhave been reported to WHO from 16 countries, including the United States\n(3,4). The reported SARS cases include 78 deaths (case-fatality proportion:\n3.5 percent). This report summarizes SARS cases among U.S. residents and\nsurveillance and prevention activities in the United States.\nDescriptive Epidemiology\n----------------------\nAs of April 2, CDC had received 100 reports of suspected SARS cases [see\nFigure 1 on webpage for epidemiologic curve\n<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5213a1.htm>] from 28 states; 81\n(81 percent) cases occurred among adults [see table 1 below]. Of these 100\nsuspected cases, 94 (94%) persons had traveled within the 10 days before\nillness onset to the areas listed in the case definition (revised on 29 Mar\n2003 to include all of mainland China as an area with documented or\nsuspected community transmission), 4 had household contact with a person\nwith suspected SARS, and 2 were health-care workers (HCWs) who provided\nmedical care to a patient with suspected SARS.\nManifestations of SARS have been relatively less severe among patients in\nthe United States than among those reported elsewhere. A majority of U.S.\npatients had normal chest radiographs, and 23 (23 percent) were reported to\nhave pneumonia or respiratory distress syndrome on chest radiograph, thereby\nmeeting the WHO case definition of a probable case (4). As of 2 Apr 2003, of\nthe 40 (40 percent) patients who were hospitalized for greater than 24\nhours, 13 (33 percent of 40) remained hospitalized; one patient had required\nmechanical ventilatory support, and no deaths have been reported.\nReports on the clinical status of suspected SARS cases are being received\nby state health departments and CDC, and household and HCW contacts are\nbeing monitored for the possibility of secondary transmission. Since SARS\ninvestigations in the United States began, some persons believed initially\nto have suspected SARS have been excluded on the basis of more complete\nclinical histories (e.g., no documented fever or respiratory symptoms) or\nbecause of testing results that indicated other etiologies. Alternative\ndiagnoses have included infection with influenza virus, respiratory\nsyncytial virus, _Haemophilus influenzae_, _Streptococcus pneumoniae_, and\n_Staphylococcus aureus_. Community transmission of SARS has not been\nidentified in the United States; transmission to HCWs has been observed in\none cluster involving 2 HCWs, compared with numerous reports of possible\ntransmission to HCWs in other countries (5--7).\nEnhanced Surveillance for SARS Related to Travel\n---------------------------------------------\nAs a precautionary measure, WHO has recommended that persons traveling to\nHong Kong and Guangdong Province of China consider postponing all but\nessential travel. CDC has issued a travel advisory recommending that\npersons planning nonessential or elective travel to mainland China, Hong\nKong, Hanoi, or Singapore consider postponing such travel until further\nnotice.\nTo detect possible SARS cases among travelers returning to the United States\nfrom these areas, CDC and state and local health authorities have\nimplemented enhanced surveillance. Since 16 Mar 2003, notices (available in\nEnglish, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Vietnamese) have been provided to\napproximately 220 000 passengers arriving in the United States on airline\nflights originating from China, Vietnam, and Singapore to inform\ndisembarking passengers and crew about SARS. Persons disembarking from these\ncountries are urged to monitor their health for 10 days after return, to\nseek medical care if they develop fever of greater than 100.5 F (39.0 C) and\ncough or difficulty breathing within 10 days of travel, and to inform their\nhealth-care providers about recent travel to regions where SARS cases have\nbeen reported.\nLaboratory Investigations\n----------------------\nEfforts are ongoing to characterize further the role of a previously\nunrecognized coronavirus in SARS. Polymerase chain reaction-based assays,\nisolation studies, electron microscopic studies, and histologic studies are\nbeing developed to detect virus in specimens from patients with suspected\nSARS. Indirect immunoflorescence antibody assays and enzyme immunoassays to\nanti-coronavirus antibody as an indicator of infection have been developed\nand are being applied to specimens from suspected SARS patients. Laboratory\nstudies at CDC and other laboratories in the WHO-organized SARS Laboratory\nNetwork have detected this new coronavirus in SARS patients, which is\nconsistent with an etiologic role in this disease. CDC has detected human\nmetapneumovirus from one SARS patient, and other laboratories also have\ndetected metapneumovirus from SARS patients (6). The role of these viruses\nin the pathogenesis of SARS is unclear.\nMMWR Editorial Note:\n--------------------\nThe number of SARS cases, and the number of countries reporting such cases,\ncontinues to increase worldwide. Transmission within hospitals and\nhouseholds continues in some areas, and transmission within communities\n(e.g., Hong Kong) continues to be reported. In the absence of a complete\nunderstanding of how SARS is transmitted, efforts to limit transmission in\nthe United States have focused on early identification of potential cases\nthrough surveillance and implementation of infection-control measures in\nhealth-care settings and the community.\nCDC has developed interim infection-control guidelines for use in U.S.\nhealth-care and household settings (8). These recommendations are based on\nexperience in the United States to date and will be revised as more\ninformation becomes available. Infection-control practitioners and\nclinicians providing medical care for patients with suspected SARS should\nconsult these guidelines frequently to keep current with recommendations.\nTransmission in health-care settings has been documented in several\ncountries. Transmission to HCWs appears to have occurred primarily after\nclose contact with symptomatic persons before recommended infection-control\nprecautions for SARS were implemented. Because a primary strategy to reduce\ntransmission in health-care settings is early recognition and isolation of\npatients who might have SARS, triage practices in hospitals and\nambulatory-care settings might require reevaluation. CDC guidelines for\ntriage of potential SARS cases are available at\n<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/sars/triage_interim_guidance.htm>.\nIn the United States, decisions to admit persons with suspected SARS to\nhealth-care facilities should be based on clinical criteria. Patients with\nsuspected SARS who are discharged should limit interactions outside the\nhome and not go to work, school, out-of-home child care, or other public\nareas until 10 days after resolution of fever and respiratory symptoms.\nAdditional guidance for these patients is available at\n<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/sars/ic-closecontacts.htm>.\nThe majority of U.S. residents with SARS have recovered or stabilized\nclinically without specific antiviral therapy. The U.S. case-fatality\nproportion is lower than that reported in some other countries (3).\nPossible explanations for this include differing case definitions among\ncountries or differences in the sensitivity of surveillance, leading to\nidentification in the United States of patients with less severe or early\nmanifestations of infection or of a larger proportion of patients with\nother respiratory illnesses. Until confirmatory laboratory testing is\navailable, the case definition will include clinical criteria more likely\nto identify potentially infectious persons. Various therapies, including\nantiviral agents (e.g., oseltamivir or ribavirin) and corticosteroids, have\nbeen administered to SARS patients, but the efficacy of these therapies has\nnot been determined.\nHealth-care providers of patients whose illness is consistent with the case\ndefinition for SARS should continue diagnostic evaluation for other causes\nof respiratory illness and, when appropriate, empiric therapy that includes\nactivity against organisms associated with community-acquired pneumonia of\nuncertain etiology, including both typical and atypical respiratory\npathogens (9). Health-care providers who report suspected SARS cases should\nnotify their state health departments if these patients receive\nconfirmatory testing that indicates a diagnosis other than SARS.\nInformation on suggested diagnostic testing and evaluation for persons with\npossible SARS is available at http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/sars/diagnosis.htm.\nAirline travel\n----------\nThe potential for transmission of SARS during airline travel is unknown.\nTransmission of other infectious agents (e.g., _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_)\nduring air travel has been demonstrated (10). When an airline flight crew\nreports a passenger with respiratory illness, quarantine officials might\nboard the aircraft on arrival in the United States to assess whether the\npassenger's symptoms match the case definition of SARS and give the\npassenger information about following up. If a passenger with suspected\nSARS is identified after passengers have disembarked, public health\nauthorities will work with the airline to contact passengers and crew for\ninformation about the development of an illness suggestive of SARS.\nAlthough ill travelers have spread SARS rapidly across international\nborders, the proportion, if any, of persons who acquired SARS during\ninternational travel as a result of in-flight transmission is unknown.\nDespite vigorous efforts to identify and isolate suspected cases, reducing\ntransmission of the etiologic agents of SARS might be difficult.\nUnderstanding the epidemiology of respiratory pathogens such as those that\ncause SARS is challenging; approximately 40-60 percent of persons with\npneumonia do not have a defined etiology, even when extensive testing for\nknown respiratory pathogens is attempted (9). Minimizing transmission will\nrequire sustained attention to infection-control interventions within\nhealth-care settings and the community. The development of laboratory\ntesting techniques to identify infected persons rapidly will be an\nimportant step toward understanding and reducing transmission of SARS.\nReferences\n--------\n1.

This is an increase of\n4 to 5-fold in the global totals in the last 7 days\n<http://www.who.int/csr/sarscountry/2003_03_25/en/> with the greatest\nproportionate and absolute increases being in China (Hong Kong & Guangdong\nProvince), and to a much lesser extent in Canada. There has been little\nabsolute rise in other country totals.\n18 countries have now reported cases but in most of these no transmission\nseems to have occurred. Local transmission has occurred in Hanoi (Vietnam),\nSingapore, Toronto (Canada), Taiwan, and the following parts of China:\nGuangdong Province;\nBeijing; Shanxi; and Hong Kong SAR. In the United Kingdom 3 probable SARS\ncases have been reported; all have now recovered. Indeed, the only areas\nwhere WHO feels there is evidence consistent with current transmission are\nHong Kong and Guangdong\n<http://www.who.int/csr/sarsarchive/2003_02_02b/en/>, and the WHO has issued\nadvice to international travellers not to travel to or through either area.\nGuangdong and Hong Kong\n--------------------------\nInformation about the outbreaks in Guangdong is limited, but the latest\nreports give a significant increase of over 350 cases during March 2003\n<http://www.who.int/csr/sarsarchive/2003_02_02b/en/>. Detailed\ndescriptions from Hong Kong are now available. Following transmission\ncentering on a large hotel, there have been intense hospital outbreaks\ninvolving staff, patient and families of staff (1) where community\ntransmission has been established. There is now evidence of community\ntransmission within a large housing complex.\nMeasures introduced by Hong Kong, Singapore, and Canada to control the\nlocal spread of SARS have included school closures (Hong Kong and\nSingapore), the quarantine of entire residential buildings (Hong Kong), and\nthe restriction of non-essential access to hospitals -- all 3,\n<http://www.health.gov.on.ca/english/public/pub/disease/sars_6.html>.\nAlthough such precautions are not yet necessary in Europe, the experience\nin Canada is a sobering reminder of what could happen in any country\nreceiving a case.\nOntario, Canada\n---------------\nThe outbreak in Canada began with a Toronto woman who developed respiratory\nsymptoms 2 days after returning from Hong Kong. She died at home 10 days\nlater, but meanwhile appears to have transmitted infection to 4 members of\nher family. One of them, her adult son, was admitted to a local hospital\nwith respiratory symptoms. He spent some time in an open part of the\nemergency department before being transferred to the intensive care unit,\nwhere he remained until his death, 6 days after admission. It is now\napparent that transmission of SARS has occurred within the hospital. A\npatient who was in the next bed in the emergency department developed\nsymptoms of SARS 3 days after his visit to the emergency department, and\ndied 11 days later. A large number of hospital staff who worked in the\nemergency department and the intensive care unit where the son of the index\ncase was cared for have now presented with symptoms of SARS. Transmission\nin the intensive care unit may have been from the patient or from visiting\nfamily members, some of whom were symptomatic at the time they visited (2).\nThe Province of Ontario declared a health emergency on 26 Mar 2003, and on\n1 Apr 2003 a sixth death from SARS was reported from Toronto. As of 1 Apr\n2003, Ontario has reported 51 probable cases of SARS. The hospital has now\nbeen closed to new admissions.\nThe experience in Canada illustrates that highly developed countries can be\nvulnerable to transmission from imported cases of SARS, especially in\nhospitals (3,4). Most of the data have been consistent with transmission\nthrough large droplets or body fluids. Aerosol transmission cannot be\ntotally discounted, but if it occurs it is uncommon. If the causative\norganism had been readily transmissible by aerosol, many more cases would\nhave been expected, especially in the countries where transmission has\nslowed or never started. In Hong Kong there are some patterns of infection\nthat are most easily explained by environmental transmission such as\nfomites.\nIf the infection is not recognised early and appropriate infection control\nprecautions put in place, extensive transmission can occur. Those most at\nrisk seem to be family members and healthcare workers who have close\ncontact with symptomatic cases. It is worth noting that there have been no\nreported secondary cases from 2 hospitalised Canadian SARS cases where\nfamily members were not permitted to visit and healthcare workers adhered\nto strict infection control precautions.\nClinicians, accident and emergency, intensive treatment units, and\ninfectious disease staff in Europe should be alert to the possibility of\nSARS in people with fever and respiratory symptoms, IF they have recently\nreturned from areas where transmission of SARS is ongoing (currently Hong\nKong, and probably Guangdong) or who have had contact with a case of SARS\n<http://www.phls.co.uk/topics_az/SARS/management_guidance.htm>. When\npatients suspected of having SARS are admitted to hospital, it is vital\nthat infection control precautions are rapidly implemented and rigorously\nenforced <http://www.phls.co.uk/topics_az/SARS/hospital_guidance.htm>.\nUpdates on the developing situation are also available from WHO\n(<http://www.who.int/csr/sars/en/>) , on ProMED\n(<http://www.promedmail.org>), and at the websites of various national\npublic health organisations, including CDC\n(<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/sars/>), Health Canada\n(<http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/pphb-dgspsp/sars-sras/index.html>), and the Health\nProtection Agency in the United Kingdom\n(<http://www.phls.org.uk/topics_az/SARS/menu.htm>)(5-7).\nEurosurveillance Weekly welcomes comments on other useful information\nsources, please send\nto elizabeth.hoile@hpa.org.uk.\nReferences:\n1.

Pending development of\nconfirmatory laboratory testing capacity, CDC's interim suspected SARS case\ndefinition (2) is based on clinical criteria and epidemiologic linkage to\nother SARS cases or areas with community transmission of SARS. This case\ndefinition will be updated periodically as new information becomes\navailable. Epidemiologic and laboratory investigations of SARS are ongoing.\nAs of 2 Apr 2003, a total of 2223 suspected and/or probable SARS cases\nhave been reported to WHO from 16 countries, including the United States\n(3,4). The reported SARS cases include 78 deaths (case-fatality proportion:\n3.5 percent). This report summarizes SARS cases among U.S. residents and\nsurveillance and prevention activities in the United States.\nDescriptive Epidemiology\n----------------------\nAs of April 2, CDC had received 100 reports of suspected SARS cases [see\nFigure 1 on webpage for epidemiologic curve\n<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5213a1.htm>] from 28 states; 81\n(81 percent) cases occurred among adults [see table 1 below]. Of these 100\nsuspected cases, 94 (94%) persons had traveled within the 10 days before\nillness onset to the areas listed in the case definition (revised on 29 Mar\n2003 to include all of mainland China as an area with documented or\nsuspected community transmission), 4 had household contact with a person\nwith suspected SARS, and 2 were health-care workers (HCWs) who provided\nmedical care to a patient with suspected SARS.\nManifestations of SARS have been relatively less severe among patients in\nthe United States than among those reported elsewhere. A majority of U.S.\npatients had normal chest radiographs, and 23 (23 percent) were reported to\nhave pneumonia or respiratory distress syndrome on chest radiograph, thereby\nmeeting the WHO case definition of a probable case (4). As of 2 Apr 2003, of\nthe 40 (40 percent) patients who were hospitalized for greater than 24\nhours, 13 (33 percent of 40) remained hospitalized; one patient had required\nmechanical ventilatory support, and no deaths have been reported.\nReports on the clinical status of suspected SARS cases are being received\nby state health departments and CDC, and household and HCW contacts are\nbeing monitored for the possibility of secondary transmission. Since SARS\ninvestigations in the United States began, some persons believed initially\nto have suspected SARS have been excluded on the basis of more complete\nclinical histories (e.g., no documented fever or respiratory symptoms) or\nbecause of testing results that indicated other etiologies. Alternative\ndiagnoses have included infection with influenza virus, respiratory\nsyncytial virus, _Haemophilus influenzae_, _Streptococcus pneumoniae_, and\n_Staphylococcus aureus_. Community transmission of SARS has not been\nidentified in the United States; transmission to HCWs has been observed in\none cluster involving 2 HCWs, compared with numerous reports of possible\ntransmission to HCWs in other countries (5--7).\nEnhanced Surveillance for SARS Related to Travel\n---------------------------------------------\nAs a precautionary measure, WHO has recommended that persons traveling to\nHong Kong and Guangdong Province of China consider postponing all but\nessential travel. CDC has issued a travel advisory recommending that\npersons planning nonessential or elective travel to mainland China, Hong\nKong, Hanoi, or Singapore consider postponing such travel until further\nnotice.\nTo detect possible SARS cases among travelers returning to the United States\nfrom these areas, CDC and state and local health authorities have\nimplemented enhanced surveillance. Since 16 Mar 2003, notices (available in\nEnglish, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Vietnamese) have been provided to\napproximately 220 000 passengers arriving in the United States on airline\nflights originating from China, Vietnam, and Singapore to inform\ndisembarking passengers and crew about SARS. Persons disembarking from these\ncountries are urged to monitor their health for 10 days after return, to\nseek medical care if they develop fever of greater than 100.5 F (39.0 C) and\ncough or difficulty breathing within 10 days of travel, and to inform their\nhealth-care providers about recent travel to regions where SARS cases have\nbeen reported.\nLaboratory Investigations\n----------------------\nEfforts are ongoing to characterize further the role of a previously\nunrecognized coronavirus in SARS. Polymerase chain reaction-based assays,\nisolation studies, electron microscopic studies, and histologic studies are\nbeing developed to detect virus in specimens from patients with suspected\nSARS. Indirect immunoflorescence antibody assays and enzyme immunoassays to\nanti-coronavirus antibody as an indicator of infection have been developed\nand are being applied to specimens from suspected SARS patients. Laboratory\nstudies at CDC and other laboratories in the WHO-organized SARS Laboratory\nNetwork have detected this new coronavirus in SARS patients, which is\nconsistent with an etiologic role in this disease. CDC has detected human\nmetapneumovirus from one SARS patient, and other laboratories also have\ndetected metapneumovirus from SARS patients (6). The role of these viruses\nin the pathogenesis of SARS is unclear.\nMMWR Editorial Note:\n--------------------\nThe number of SARS cases, and the number of countries reporting such cases,\ncontinues to increase worldwide. Transmission within hospitals and\nhouseholds continues in some areas, and transmission within communities\n(e.g., Hong Kong) continues to be reported. In the absence of a complete\nunderstanding of how SARS is transmitted, efforts to limit transmission in\nthe United States have focused on early identification of potential cases\nthrough surveillance and implementation of infection-control measures in\nhealth-care settings and the community.\nCDC has developed interim infection-control guidelines for use in U.S.\nhealth-care and household settings (8). These recommendations are based on\nexperience in the United States to date and will be revised as more\ninformation becomes available. Infection-control practitioners and\nclinicians providing medical care for patients with suspected SARS should\nconsult these guidelines frequently to keep current with recommendations.\nTransmission in health-care settings has been documented in several\ncountries. Transmission to HCWs appears to have occurred primarily after\nclose contact with symptomatic persons before recommended infection-control\nprecautions for SARS were implemented. Because a primary strategy to reduce\ntransmission in health-care settings is early recognition and isolation of\npatients who might have SARS, triage practices in hospitals and\nambulatory-care settings might require reevaluation. CDC guidelines for\ntriage of potential SARS cases are available at\n<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/sars/triage_interim_guidance.htm>.\nIn the United States, decisions to admit persons with suspected SARS to\nhealth-care facilities should be based on clinical criteria. Patients with\nsuspected SARS who are discharged should limit interactions outside the\nhome and not go to work, school, out-of-home child care, or other public\nareas until 10 days after resolution of fever and respiratory symptoms.\nAdditional guidance for these patients is available at\n<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/sars/ic-closecontacts.htm>.\nThe majority of U.S. residents with SARS have recovered or stabilized\nclinically without specific antiviral therapy. The U.S. case-fatality\nproportion is lower than that reported in some other countries (3).\nPossible explanations for this include differing case definitions among\ncountries or differences in the sensitivity of surveillance, leading to\nidentification in the United States of patients with less severe or early\nmanifestations of infection or of a larger proportion of patients with\nother respiratory illnesses. Until confirmatory laboratory testing is\navailable, the case definition will include clinical criteria more likely\nto identify potentially infectious persons. Various therapies, including\nantiviral agents (e.g., oseltamivir or ribavirin) and corticosteroids, have\nbeen administered to SARS patients, but the efficacy of these therapies has\nnot been determined.\nHealth-care providers of patients whose illness is consistent with the case\ndefinition for SARS should continue diagnostic evaluation for other causes\nof respiratory illness and, when appropriate, empiric therapy that includes\nactivity against organisms associated with community-acquired pneumonia of\nuncertain etiology, including both typical and atypical respiratory\npathogens (9). Health-care providers who report suspected SARS cases should\nnotify their state health departments if these patients receive\nconfirmatory testing that indicates a diagnosis other than SARS.\nInformation on suggested diagnostic testing and evaluation for persons with\npossible SARS is available at http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/sars/diagnosis.htm.\nAirline travel\n----------\nThe potential for transmission of SARS during airline travel is unknown.\nTransmission of other infectious agents (e.g., _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_)\nduring air travel has been demonstrated (10). When an airline flight crew\nreports a passenger with respiratory illness, quarantine officials might\nboard the aircraft on arrival in the United States to assess whether the\npassenger's symptoms match the case definition of SARS and give the\npassenger information about following up. If a passenger with suspected\nSARS is identified after passengers have disembarked, public health\nauthorities will work with the airline to contact passengers and crew for\ninformation about the development of an illness suggestive of SARS.\nAlthough ill travelers have spread SARS rapidly across international\nborders, the proportion, if any, of persons who acquired SARS during\ninternational travel as a result of in-flight transmission is unknown.\nDespite vigorous efforts to identify and isolate suspected cases, reducing\ntransmission of the etiologic agents of SARS might be difficult.\nUnderstanding the epidemiology of respiratory pathogens such as those that\ncause SARS is challenging; approximately 40-60 percent of persons with\npneumonia do not have a defined etiology, even when extensive testing for\nknown respiratory pathogens is attempted (9). Minimizing transmission will\nrequire sustained attention to infection-control interventions within\nhealth-care settings and the community. The development of laboratory\ntesting techniques to identify infected persons rapidly will be an\nimportant step toward understanding and reducing transmission of SARS.\nReferences\n--------\n1.

This is an increase of\n4 to 5-fold in the global totals in the last 7 days\n<http://www.who.int/csr/sarscountry/2003_03_25/en/> with the greatest\nproportionate and absolute increases being in China (Hong Kong & Guangdong\nProvince), and to a much lesser extent in Canada. There has been little\nabsolute rise in other country totals.\n18 countries have now reported cases but in most of these no transmission\nseems to have occurred. Local transmission has occurred in Hanoi (Vietnam),\nSingapore, Toronto (Canada), Taiwan, and the following parts of China:\nGuangdong Province;\nBeijing; Shanxi; and Hong Kong SAR. In the United Kingdom 3 probable SARS\ncases have been reported; all have now recovered. Indeed, the only areas\nwhere WHO feels there is evidence consistent with current transmission are\nHong Kong and Guangdong\n<http://www.who.int/csr/sarsarchive/2003_02_02b/en/>, and the WHO has issued\nadvice to international travellers not to travel to or through either area.\nGuangdong and Hong Kong\n--------------------------\nInformation about the outbreaks in Guangdong is limited, but the latest\nreports give a significant increase of over 350 cases during March 2003\n<http://www.who.int/csr/sarsarchive/2003_02_02b/en/>. Detailed\ndescriptions from Hong Kong are now available. Following transmission\ncentering on a large hotel, there have been intense hospital outbreaks\ninvolving staff, patient and families of staff (1) where community\ntransmission has been established. There is now evidence of community\ntransmission within a large housing complex.\nMeasures introduced by Hong Kong, Singapore, and Canada to control the\nlocal spread of SARS have included school closures (Hong Kong and\nSingapore), the quarantine of entire residential buildings (Hong Kong), and\nthe restriction of non-essential access to hospitals -- all 3,\n<http://www.health.gov.on.ca/english/public/pub/disease/sars_6.html>.\nAlthough such precautions are not yet necessary in Europe, the experience\nin Canada is a sobering reminder of what could happen in any country\nreceiving a case.\nOntario, Canada\n---------------\nThe outbreak in Canada began with a Toronto woman who developed respiratory\nsymptoms 2 days after returning from Hong Kong. She died at home 10 days\nlater, but meanwhile appears to have transmitted infection to 4 members of\nher family. One of them, her adult son, was admitted to a local hospital\nwith respiratory symptoms. He spent some time in an open part of the\nemergency department before being transferred to the intensive care unit,\nwhere he remained until his death, 6 days after admission. It is now\napparent that transmission of SARS has occurred within the hospital. A\npatient who was in the next bed in the emergency department developed\nsymptoms of SARS 3 days after his visit to the emergency department, and\ndied 11 days later. A large number of hospital staff who worked in the\nemergency department and the intensive care unit where the son of the index\ncase was cared for have now presented with symptoms of SARS. Transmission\nin the intensive care unit may have been from the patient or from visiting\nfamily members, some of whom were symptomatic at the time they visited (2).\nThe Province of Ontario declared a health emergency on 26 Mar 2003, and on\n1 Apr 2003 a sixth death from SARS was reported from Toronto. As of 1 Apr\n2003, Ontario has reported 51 probable cases of SARS. The hospital has now\nbeen closed to new admissions.\nThe experience in Canada illustrates that highly developed countries can be\nvulnerable to transmission from imported cases of SARS, especially in\nhospitals (3,4). Most of the data have been consistent with transmission\nthrough large droplets or body fluids. Aerosol transmission cannot be\ntotally discounted, but if it occurs it is uncommon. If the causative\norganism had been readily transmissible by aerosol, many more cases would\nhave been expected, especially in the countries where transmission has\nslowed or never started. In Hong Kong there are some patterns of infection\nthat are most easily explained by environmental transmission such as\nfomites.\nIf the infection is not recognised early and appropriate infection control\nprecautions put in place, extensive transmission can occur. Those most at\nrisk seem to be family members and healthcare workers who have close\ncontact with symptomatic cases. It is worth noting that there have been no\nreported secondary cases from 2 hospitalised Canadian SARS cases where\nfamily members were not permitted to visit and healthcare workers adhered\nto strict infection control precautions.\nClinicians, accident and emergency, intensive treatment units, and\ninfectious disease staff in Europe should be alert to the possibility of\nSARS in people with fever and respiratory symptoms, IF they have recently\nreturned from areas where transmission of SARS is ongoing (currently Hong\nKong, and probably Guangdong) or who have had contact with a case of SARS\n<http://www.phls.co.uk/topics_az/SARS/management_guidance.htm>. When\npatients suspected of having SARS are admitted to hospital, it is vital\nthat infection control precautions are rapidly implemented and rigorously\nenforced <http://www.phls.co.uk/topics_az/SARS/hospital_guidance.htm>.\nUpdates on the developing situation are also available from WHO\n(<http://www.who.int/csr/sars/en/>) , on ProMED\n(<http://www.promedmail.org>), and at the websites of various national\npublic health organisations, including CDC\n(<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/sars/>), Health Canada\n(<http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/pphb-dgspsp/sars-sras/index.html>), and the Health\nProtection Agency in the United Kingdom\n(<http://www.phls.org.uk/topics_az/SARS/menu.htm>)(5-7).\nEurosurveillance Weekly welcomes comments on other useful information\nsources, please send\nto elizabeth.hoile@hpa.org.uk.\nReferences:\n1.

Pending development of\nconfirmatory laboratory testing capacity, CDC's interim suspected SARS case\ndefinition (2) is based on clinical criteria and epidemiologic linkage to\nother SARS cases or areas with community transmission of SARS. This case\ndefinition will be updated periodically as new information becomes\navailable. Epidemiologic and laboratory investigations of SARS are ongoing.\nAs of 2 Apr 2003, a total of 2223 suspected and/or probable SARS cases\nhave been reported to WHO from 16 countries, including the United States\n(3,4). The reported SARS cases include 78 deaths (case-fatality proportion:\n3.5 percent). This report summarizes SARS cases among U.S. residents and\nsurveillance and prevention activities in the United States.\nDescriptive Epidemiology\n----------------------\nAs of April 2, CDC had received 100 reports of suspected SARS cases [see\nFigure 1 on webpage for epidemiologic curve\n<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5213a1.htm>] from 28 states; 81\n(81 percent) cases occurred among adults [see table 1 below]. Of these 100\nsuspected cases, 94 (94%) persons had traveled within the 10 days before\nillness onset to the areas listed in the case definition (revised on 29 Mar\n2003 to include all of mainland China as an area with documented or\nsuspected community transmission), 4 had household contact with a person\nwith suspected SARS, and 2 were health-care workers (HCWs) who provided\nmedical care to a patient with suspected SARS.\nManifestations of SARS have been relatively less severe among patients in\nthe United States than among those reported elsewhere. A majority of U.S.\npatients had normal chest radiographs, and 23 (23 percent) were reported to\nhave pneumonia or respiratory distress syndrome on chest radiograph, thereby\nmeeting the WHO case definition of a probable case (4). As of 2 Apr 2003, of\nthe 40 (40 percent) patients who were hospitalized for greater than 24\nhours, 13 (33 percent of 40) remained hospitalized; one patient had required\nmechanical ventilatory support, and no deaths have been reported.\nReports on the clinical status of suspected SARS cases are being received\nby state health departments and CDC, and household and HCW contacts are\nbeing monitored for the possibility of secondary transmission. Since SARS\ninvestigations in the United States began, some persons believed initially\nto have suspected SARS have been excluded on the basis of more complete\nclinical histories (e.g., no documented fever or respiratory symptoms) or\nbecause of testing results that indicated other etiologies. Alternative\ndiagnoses have included infection with influenza virus, respiratory\nsyncytial virus, _Haemophilus influenzae_, _Streptococcus pneumoniae_, and\n_Staphylococcus aureus_. Community transmission of SARS has not been\nidentified in the United States; transmission to HCWs has been observed in\none cluster involving 2 HCWs, compared with numerous reports of possible\ntransmission to HCWs in other countries (5--7).\nEnhanced Surveillance for SARS Related to Travel\n---------------------------------------------\nAs a precautionary measure, WHO has recommended that persons traveling to\nHong Kong and Guangdong Province of China consider postponing all but\nessential travel. CDC has issued a travel advisory recommending that\npersons planning nonessential or elective travel to mainland China, Hong\nKong, Hanoi, or Singapore consider postponing such travel until further\nnotice.\nTo detect possible SARS cases among travelers returning to the United States\nfrom these areas, CDC and state and local health authorities have\nimplemented enhanced surveillance. Since 16 Mar 2003, notices (available in\nEnglish, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Vietnamese) have been provided to\napproximately 220 000 passengers arriving in the United States on airline\nflights originating from China, Vietnam, and Singapore to inform\ndisembarking passengers and crew about SARS. Persons disembarking from these\ncountries are urged to monitor their health for 10 days after return, to\nseek medical care if they develop fever of greater than 100.5 F (39.0 C) and\ncough or difficulty breathing within 10 days of travel, and to inform their\nhealth-care providers about recent travel to regions where SARS cases have\nbeen reported.\nLaboratory Investigations\n----------------------\nEfforts are ongoing to characterize further the role of a previously\nunrecognized coronavirus in SARS. Polymerase chain reaction-based assays,\nisolation studies, electron microscopic studies, and histologic studies are\nbeing developed to detect virus in specimens from patients with suspected\nSARS. Indirect immunoflorescence antibody assays and enzyme immunoassays to\nanti-coronavirus antibody as an indicator of infection have been developed\nand are being applied to specimens from suspected SARS patients. Laboratory\nstudies at CDC and other laboratories in the WHO-organized SARS Laboratory\nNetwork have detected this new coronavirus in SARS patients, which is\nconsistent with an etiologic role in this disease. CDC has detected human\nmetapneumovirus from one SARS patient, and other laboratories also have\ndetected metapneumovirus from SARS patients (6). The role of these viruses\nin the pathogenesis of SARS is unclear.\nMMWR Editorial Note:\n--------------------\nThe number of SARS cases, and the number of countries reporting such cases,\ncontinues to increase worldwide. Transmission within hospitals and\nhouseholds continues in some areas, and transmission within communities\n(e.g., Hong Kong) continues to be reported. In the absence of a complete\nunderstanding of how SARS is transmitted, efforts to limit transmission in\nthe United States have focused on early identification of potential cases\nthrough surveillance and implementation of infection-control measures in\nhealth-care settings and the community.\nCDC has developed interim infection-control guidelines for use in U.S.\nhealth-care and household settings (8). These recommendations are based on\nexperience in the United States to date and will be revised as more\ninformation becomes available. Infection-control practitioners and\nclinicians providing medical care for patients with suspected SARS should\nconsult these guidelines frequently to keep current with recommendations.\nTransmission in health-care settings has been documented in several\ncountries. Transmission to HCWs appears to have occurred primarily after\nclose contact with symptomatic persons before recommended infection-control\nprecautions for SARS were implemented. Because a primary strategy to reduce\ntransmission in health-care settings is early recognition and isolation of\npatients who might have SARS, triage practices in hospitals and\nambulatory-care settings might require reevaluation. CDC guidelines for\ntriage of potential SARS cases are available at\n<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/sars/triage_interim_guidance.htm>.\nIn the United States, decisions to admit persons with suspected SARS to\nhealth-care facilities should be based on clinical criteria. Patients with\nsuspected SARS who are discharged should limit interactions outside the\nhome and not go to work, school, out-of-home child care, or other public\nareas until 10 days after resolution of fever and respiratory symptoms.\nAdditional guidance for these patients is available at\n<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/sars/ic-closecontacts.htm>.\nThe majority of U.S. residents with SARS have recovered or stabilized\nclinically without specific antiviral therapy. The U.S. case-fatality\nproportion is lower than that reported in some other countries (3).\nPossible explanations for this include differing case definitions among\ncountries or differences in the sensitivity of surveillance, leading to\nidentification in the United States of patients with less severe or early\nmanifestations of infection or of a larger proportion of patients with\nother respiratory illnesses. Until confirmatory laboratory testing is\navailable, the case definition will include clinical criteria more likely\nto identify potentially infectious persons. Various therapies, including\nantiviral agents (e.g., oseltamivir or ribavirin) and corticosteroids, have\nbeen administered to SARS patients, but the efficacy of these therapies has\nnot been determined.\nHealth-care providers of patients whose illness is consistent with the case\ndefinition for SARS should continue diagnostic evaluation for other causes\nof respiratory illness and, when appropriate, empiric therapy that includes\nactivity against organisms associated with community-acquired pneumonia of\nuncertain etiology, including both typical and atypical respiratory\npathogens (9). Health-care providers who report suspected SARS cases should\nnotify their state health departments if these patients receive\nconfirmatory testing that indicates a diagnosis other than SARS.\nInformation on suggested diagnostic testing and evaluation for persons with\npossible SARS is available at http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/sars/diagnosis.htm.\nAirline travel\n----------\nThe potential for transmission of SARS during airline travel is unknown.\nTransmission of other infectious agents (e.g., _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_)\nduring air travel has been demonstrated (10). When an airline flight crew\nreports a passenger with respiratory illness, quarantine officials might\nboard the aircraft on arrival in the United States to assess whether the\npassenger's symptoms match the case definition of SARS and give the\npassenger information about following up. If a passenger with suspected\nSARS is identified after passengers have disembarked, public health\nauthorities will work with the airline to contact passengers and crew for\ninformation about the development of an illness suggestive of SARS.\nAlthough ill travelers have spread SARS rapidly across international\nborders, the proportion, if any, of persons who acquired SARS during\ninternational travel as a result of in-flight transmission is unknown.\nDespite vigorous efforts to identify and isolate suspected cases, reducing\ntransmission of the etiologic agents of SARS might be difficult.\nUnderstanding the epidemiology of respiratory pathogens such as those that\ncause SARS is challenging; approximately 40-60 percent of persons with\npneumonia do not have a defined etiology, even when extensive testing for\nknown respiratory pathogens is attempted (9). Minimizing transmission will\nrequire sustained attention to infection-control interventions within\nhealth-care settings and the community. The development of laboratory\ntesting techniques to identify infected persons rapidly will be an\nimportant step toward understanding and reducing transmission of SARS.\nReferences\n--------\n1.

This is an increase of\n4 to 5-fold in the global totals in the last 7 days\n<http://www.who.int/csr/sarscountry/2003_03_25/en/> with the greatest\nproportionate and absolute increases being in China (Hong Kong & Guangdong\nProvince), and to a much lesser extent in Canada. There has been little\nabsolute rise in other country totals.\n18 countries have now reported cases but in most of these no transmission\nseems to have occurred. Local transmission has occurred in Hanoi (Vietnam),\nSingapore, Toronto (Canada), Taiwan, and the following parts of China:\nGuangdong Province;\nBeijing; Shanxi; and Hong Kong SAR. In the United Kingdom 3 probable SARS\ncases have been reported; all have now recovered. Indeed, the only areas\nwhere WHO feels there is evidence consistent with current transmission are\nHong Kong and Guangdong\n<http://www.who.int/csr/sarsarchive/2003_02_02b/en/>, and the WHO has issued\nadvice to international travellers not to travel to or through either area.\nGuangdong and Hong Kong\n--------------------------\nInformation about the outbreaks in Guangdong is limited, but the latest\nreports give a significant increase of over 350 cases during March 2003\n<http://www.who.int/csr/sarsarchive/2003_02_02b/en/>. Detailed\ndescriptions from Hong Kong are now available. Following transmission\ncentering on a large hotel, there have been intense hospital outbreaks\ninvolving staff, patient and families of staff (1) where community\ntransmission has been established. There is now evidence of community\ntransmission within a large housing complex.\nMeasures introduced by Hong Kong, Singapore, and Canada to control the\nlocal spread of SARS have included school closures (Hong Kong and\nSingapore), the quarantine of entire residential buildings (Hong Kong), and\nthe restriction of non-essential access to hospitals -- all 3,\n<http://www.health.gov.on.ca/english/public/pub/disease/sars_6.html>.\nAlthough such precautions are not yet necessary in Europe, the experience\nin Canada is a sobering reminder of what could happen in any country\nreceiving a case.\nOntario, Canada\n---------------\nThe outbreak in Canada began with a Toronto woman who developed respiratory\nsymptoms 2 days after returning from Hong Kong. She died at home 10 days\nlater, but meanwhile appears to have transmitted infection to 4 members of\nher family. One of them, her adult son, was admitted to a local hospital\nwith respiratory symptoms. He spent some time in an open part of the\nemergency department before being transferred to the intensive care unit,\nwhere he remained until his death, 6 days after admission. It is now\napparent that transmission of SARS has occurred within the hospital. A\npatient who was in the next bed in the emergency department developed\nsymptoms of SARS 3 days after his visit to the emergency department, and\ndied 11 days later. A large number of hospital staff who worked in the\nemergency department and the intensive care unit where the son of the index\ncase was cared for have now presented with symptoms of SARS. Transmission\nin the intensive care unit may have been from the patient or from visiting\nfamily members, some of whom were symptomatic at the time they visited (2).\nThe Province of Ontario declared a health emergency on 26 Mar 2003, and on\n1 Apr 2003 a sixth death from SARS was reported from Toronto. As of 1 Apr\n2003, Ontario has reported 51 probable cases of SARS. The hospital has now\nbeen closed to new admissions.\nThe experience in Canada illustrates that highly developed countries can be\nvulnerable to transmission from imported cases of SARS, especially in\nhospitals (3,4). Most of the data have been consistent with transmission\nthrough large droplets or body fluids. Aerosol transmission cannot be\ntotally discounted, but if it occurs it is uncommon. If the causative\norganism had been readily transmissible by aerosol, many more cases would\nhave been expected, especially in the countries where transmission has\nslowed or never started. In Hong Kong there are some patterns of infection\nthat are most easily explained by environmental transmission such as\nfomites.\nIf the infection is not recognised early and appropriate infection control\nprecautions put in place, extensive transmission can occur. Those most at\nrisk seem to be family members and healthcare workers who have close\ncontact with symptomatic cases. It is worth noting that there have been no\nreported secondary cases from 2 hospitalised Canadian SARS cases where\nfamily members were not permitted to visit and healthcare workers adhered\nto strict infection control precautions.\nClinicians, accident and emergency, intensive treatment units, and\ninfectious disease staff in Europe should be alert to the possibility of\nSARS in people with fever and respiratory symptoms, IF they have recently\nreturned from areas where transmission of SARS is ongoing (currently Hong\nKong, and probably Guangdong) or who have had contact with a case of SARS\n<http://www.phls.co.uk/topics_az/SARS/management_guidance.htm>. When\npatients suspected of having SARS are admitted to hospital, it is vital\nthat infection control precautions are rapidly implemented and rigorously\nenforced <http://www.phls.co.uk/topics_az/SARS/hospital_guidance.htm>.\nUpdates on the developing situation are also available from WHO\n(<http://www.who.int/csr/sars/en/>) , on ProMED\n(<http://www.promedmail.org>), and at the websites of various national\npublic health organisations, including CDC\n(<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/sars/>), Health Canada\n(<http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/pphb-dgspsp/sars-sras/index.html>), and the Health\nProtection Agency in the United Kingdom\n(<http://www.phls.org.uk/topics_az/SARS/menu.htm>)(5-7).\nEurosurveillance Weekly welcomes comments on other useful information\nsources, please send\nto elizabeth.hoile@hpa.org.uk.\nReferences:\n1.

Pending development of\nconfirmatory laboratory testing capacity, CDC's interim suspected SARS case\ndefinition (2) is based on clinical criteria and epidemiologic linkage to\nother SARS cases or areas with community transmission of SARS. This case\ndefinition will be updated periodically as new information becomes\navailable. Epidemiologic and laboratory investigations of SARS are ongoing.\nAs of 2 Apr 2003, a total of 2223 suspected and/or probable SARS cases\nhave been reported to WHO from 16 countries, including the United States\n(3,4). The reported SARS cases include 78 deaths (case-fatality proportion:\n3.5 percent). This report summarizes SARS cases among U.S. residents and\nsurveillance and prevention activities in the United States.\nDescriptive Epidemiology\n----------------------\nAs of April 2, CDC had received 100 reports of suspected SARS cases [see\nFigure 1 on webpage for epidemiologic curve\n<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5213a1.htm>] from 28 states; 81\n(81 percent) cases occurred among adults [see table 1 below]. Of these 100\nsuspected cases, 94 (94%) persons had traveled within the 10 days before\nillness onset to the areas listed in the case definition (revised on 29 Mar\n2003 to include all of mainland China as an area with documented or\nsuspected community transmission), 4 had household contact with a person\nwith suspected SARS, and 2 were health-care workers (HCWs) who provided\nmedical care to a patient with suspected SARS.\nManifestations of SARS have been relatively less severe among patients in\nthe United States than among those reported elsewhere. A majority of U.S.\npatients had normal chest radiographs, and 23 (23 percent) were reported to\nhave pneumonia or respiratory distress syndrome on chest radiograph, thereby\nmeeting the WHO case definition of a probable case (4). As of 2 Apr 2003, of\nthe 40 (40 percent) patients who were hospitalized for greater than 24\nhours, 13 (33 percent of 40) remained hospitalized; one patient had required\nmechanical ventilatory support, and no deaths have been reported.\nReports on the clinical status of suspected SARS cases are being received\nby state health departments and CDC, and household and HCW contacts are\nbeing monitored for the possibility of secondary transmission. Since SARS\ninvestigations in the United States began, some persons believed initially\nto have suspected SARS have been excluded on the basis of more complete\nclinical histories (e.g., no documented fever or respiratory symptoms) or\nbecause of testing results that indicated other etiologies. Alternative\ndiagnoses have included infection with influenza virus, respiratory\nsyncytial virus, _Haemophilus influenzae_, _Streptococcus pneumoniae_, and\n_Staphylococcus aureus_. Community transmission of SARS has not been\nidentified in the United States; transmission to HCWs has been observed in\none cluster involving 2 HCWs, compared with numerous reports of possible\ntransmission to HCWs in other countries (5--7).\nEnhanced Surveillance for SARS Related to Travel\n---------------------------------------------\nAs a precautionary measure, WHO has recommended that persons traveling to\nHong Kong and Guangdong Province of China consider postponing all but\nessential travel. CDC has issued a travel advisory recommending that\npersons planning nonessential or elective travel to mainland China, Hong\nKong, Hanoi, or Singapore consider postponing such travel until further\nnotice.\nTo detect possible SARS cases among travelers returning to the United States\nfrom these areas, CDC and state and local health authorities have\nimplemented enhanced surveillance. Since 16 Mar 2003, notices (available in\nEnglish, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Vietnamese) have been provided to\napproximately 220 000 passengers arriving in the United States on airline\nflights originating from China, Vietnam, and Singapore to inform\ndisembarking passengers and crew about SARS. Persons disembarking from these\ncountries are urged to monitor their health for 10 days after return, to\nseek medical care if they develop fever of greater than 100.5 F (39.0 C) and\ncough or difficulty breathing within 10 days of travel, and to inform their\nhealth-care providers about recent travel to regions where SARS cases have\nbeen reported.\nLaboratory Investigations\n----------------------\nEfforts are ongoing to characterize further the role of a previously\nunrecognized coronavirus in SARS. Polymerase chain reaction-based assays,\nisolation studies, electron microscopic studies, and histologic studies are\nbeing developed to detect virus in specimens from patients with suspected\nSARS. Indirect immunoflorescence antibody assays and enzyme immunoassays to\nanti-coronavirus antibody as an indicator of infection have been developed\nand are being applied to specimens from suspected SARS patients. Laboratory\nstudies at CDC and other laboratories in the WHO-organized SARS Laboratory\nNetwork have detected this new coronavirus in SARS patients, which is\nconsistent with an etiologic role in this disease. CDC has detected human\nmetapneumovirus from one SARS patient, and other laboratories also have\ndetected metapneumovirus from SARS patients (6). The role of these viruses\nin the pathogenesis of SARS is unclear.\nMMWR Editorial Note:\n--------------------\nThe number of SARS cases, and the number of countries reporting such cases,\ncontinues to increase worldwide. Transmission within hospitals and\nhouseholds continues in some areas, and transmission within communities\n(e.g., Hong Kong) continues to be reported. In the absence of a complete\nunderstanding of how SARS is transmitted, efforts to limit transmission in\nthe United States have focused on early identification of potential cases\nthrough surveillance and implementation of infection-control measures in\nhealth-care settings and the community.\nCDC has developed interim infection-control guidelines for use in U.S.\nhealth-care and household settings (8). These recommendations are based on\nexperience in the United States to date and will be revised as more\ninformation becomes available. Infection-control practitioners and\nclinicians providing medical care for patients with suspected SARS should\nconsult these guidelines frequently to keep current with recommendations.\nTransmission in health-care settings has been documented in several\ncountries. Transmission to HCWs appears to have occurred primarily after\nclose contact with symptomatic persons before recommended infection-control\nprecautions for SARS were implemented. Because a primary strategy to reduce\ntransmission in health-care settings is early recognition and isolation of\npatients who might have SARS, triage practices in hospitals and\nambulatory-care settings might require reevaluation. CDC guidelines for\ntriage of potential SARS cases are available at\n<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/sars/triage_interim_guidance.htm>.\nIn the United States, decisions to admit persons with suspected SARS to\nhealth-care facilities should be based on clinical criteria. Patients with\nsuspected SARS who are discharged should limit interactions outside the\nhome and not go to work, school, out-of-home child care, or other public\nareas until 10 days after resolution of fever and respiratory symptoms.\nAdditional guidance for these patients is available at\n<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/sars/ic-closecontacts.htm>.\nThe majority of U.S. residents with SARS have recovered or stabilized\nclinically without specific antiviral therapy. The U.S. case-fatality\nproportion is lower than that reported in some other countries (3).\nPossible explanations for this include differing case definitions among\ncountries or differences in the sensitivity of surveillance, leading to\nidentification in the United States of patients with less severe or early\nmanifestations of infection or of a larger proportion of patients with\nother respiratory illnesses. Until confirmatory laboratory testing is\navailable, the case definition will include clinical criteria more likely\nto identify potentially infectious persons. Various therapies, including\nantiviral agents (e.g., oseltamivir or ribavirin) and corticosteroids, have\nbeen administered to SARS patients, but the efficacy of these therapies has\nnot been determined.\nHealth-care providers of patients whose illness is consistent with the case\ndefinition for SARS should continue diagnostic evaluation for other causes\nof respiratory illness and, when appropriate, empiric therapy that includes\nactivity against organisms associated with community-acquired pneumonia of\nuncertain etiology, including both typical and atypical respiratory\npathogens (9). Health-care providers who report suspected SARS cases should\nnotify their state health departments if these patients receive\nconfirmatory testing that indicates a diagnosis other than SARS.\nInformation on suggested diagnostic testing and evaluation for persons with\npossible SARS is available at http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/sars/diagnosis.htm.\nAirline travel\n----------\nThe potential for transmission of SARS during airline travel is unknown.\nTransmission of other infectious agents (e.g., _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_)\nduring air travel has been demonstrated (10). When an airline flight crew\nreports a passenger with respiratory illness, quarantine officials might\nboard the aircraft on arrival in the United States to assess whether the\npassenger's symptoms match the case definition of SARS and give the\npassenger information about following up. If a passenger with suspected\nSARS is identified after passengers have disembarked, public health\nauthorities will work with the airline to contact passengers and crew for\ninformation about the development of an illness suggestive of SARS.\nAlthough ill travelers have spread SARS rapidly across international\nborders, the proportion, if any, of persons who acquired SARS during\ninternational travel as a result of in-flight transmission is unknown.\nDespite vigorous efforts to identify and isolate suspected cases, reducing\ntransmission of the etiologic agents of SARS might be difficult.\nUnderstanding the epidemiology of respiratory pathogens such as those that\ncause SARS is challenging; approximately 40-60 percent of persons with\npneumonia do not have a defined etiology, even when extensive testing for\nknown respiratory pathogens is attempted (9). Minimizing transmission will\nrequire sustained attention to infection-control interventions within\nhealth-care settings and the community. The development of laboratory\ntesting techniques to identify infected persons rapidly will be an\nimportant step toward understanding and reducing transmission of SARS.\nReferences\n--------\n1.

This is an increase of\n4 to 5-fold in the global totals in the last 7 days\n<http://www.who.int/csr/sarscountry/2003_03_25/en/> with the greatest\nproportionate and absolute increases being in China (Hong Kong & Guangdong\nProvince), and to a much lesser extent in Canada. There has been little\nabsolute rise in other country totals.\n18 countries have now reported cases but in most of these no transmission\nseems to have occurred. Local transmission has occurred in Hanoi (Vietnam),\nSingapore, Toronto (Canada), Taiwan, and the following parts of China:\nGuangdong Province;\nBeijing; Shanxi; and Hong Kong SAR. In the United Kingdom 3 probable SARS\ncases have been reported; all have now recovered. Indeed, the only areas\nwhere WHO feels there is evidence consistent with current transmission are\nHong Kong and Guangdong\n<http://www.who.int/csr/sarsarchive/2003_02_02b/en/>, and the WHO has issued\nadvice to international travellers not to travel to or through either area.\nGuangdong and Hong Kong\n--------------------------\nInformation about the outbreaks in Guangdong is limited, but the latest\nreports give a significant increase of over 350 cases during March 2003\n<http://www.who.int/csr/sarsarchive/2003_02_02b/en/>. Detailed\ndescriptions from Hong Kong are now available. Following transmission\ncentering on a large hotel, there have been intense hospital outbreaks\ninvolving staff, patient and families of staff (1) where community\ntransmission has been established. There is now evidence of community\ntransmission within a large housing complex.\nMeasures introduced by Hong Kong, Singapore, and Canada to control the\nlocal spread of SARS have included school closures (Hong Kong and\nSingapore), the quarantine of entire residential buildings (Hong Kong), and\nthe restriction of non-essential access to hospitals -- all 3,\n<http://www.health.gov.on.ca/english/public/pub/disease/sars_6.html>.\nAlthough such precautions are not yet necessary in Europe, the experience\nin Canada is a sobering reminder of what could happen in any country\nreceiving a case.\nOntario, Canada\n---------------\nThe outbreak in Canada began with a Toronto woman who developed respiratory\nsymptoms 2 days after returning from Hong Kong. She died at home 10 days\nlater, but meanwhile appears to have transmitted infection to 4 members of\nher family. One of them, her adult son, was admitted to a local hospital\nwith respiratory symptoms. He spent some time in an open part of the\nemergency department before being transferred to the intensive care unit,\nwhere he remained until his death, 6 days after admission. It is now\napparent that transmission of SARS has occurred within the hospital. A\npatient who was in the next bed in the emergency department developed\nsymptoms of SARS 3 days after his visit to the emergency department, and\ndied 11 days later. A large number of hospital staff who worked in the\nemergency department and the intensive care unit where the son of the index\ncase was cared for have now presented with symptoms of SARS. Transmission\nin the intensive care unit may have been from the patient or from visiting\nfamily members, some of whom were symptomatic at the time they visited (2).\nThe Province of Ontario declared a health emergency on 26 Mar 2003, and on\n1 Apr 2003 a sixth death from SARS was reported from Toronto. As of 1 Apr\n2003, Ontario has reported 51 probable cases of SARS. The hospital has now\nbeen closed to new admissions.\nThe experience in Canada illustrates that highly developed countries can be\nvulnerable to transmission from imported cases of SARS, especially in\nhospitals (3,4). Most of the data have been consistent with transmission\nthrough large droplets or body fluids. Aerosol transmission cannot be\ntotally discounted, but if it occurs it is uncommon. If the causative\norganism had been readily transmissible by aerosol, many more cases would\nhave been expected, especially in the countries where transmission has\nslowed or never started. In Hong Kong there are some patterns of infection\nthat are most easily explained by environmental transmission such as\nfomites.\nIf the infection is not recognised early and appropriate infection control\nprecautions put in place, extensive transmission can occur. Those most at\nrisk seem to be family members and healthcare workers who have close\ncontact with symptomatic cases. It is worth noting that there have been no\nreported secondary cases from 2 hospitalised Canadian SARS cases where\nfamily members were not permitted to visit and healthcare workers adhered\nto strict infection control precautions.\nClinicians, accident and emergency, intensive treatment units, and\ninfectious disease staff in Europe should be alert to the possibility of\nSARS in people with fever and respiratory symptoms, IF they have recently\nreturned from areas where transmission of SARS is ongoing (currently Hong\nKong, and probably Guangdong) or who have had contact with a case of SARS\n<http://www.phls.co.uk/topics_az/SARS/management_guidance.htm>. When\npatients suspected of having SARS are admitted to hospital, it is vital\nthat infection control precautions are rapidly implemented and rigorously\nenforced <http://www.phls.co.uk/topics_az/SARS/hospital_guidance.htm>.\nUpdates on the developing situation are also available from WHO\n(<http://www.who.int/csr/sars/en/>) , on ProMED\n(<http://www.promedmail.org>), and at the websites of various national\npublic health organisations, including CDC\n(<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/sars/>), Health Canada\n(<http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/pphb-dgspsp/sars-sras/index.html>), and the Health\nProtection Agency in the United Kingdom\n(<http://www.phls.org.uk/topics_az/SARS/menu.htm>)(5-7).\nEurosurveillance Weekly welcomes comments on other useful information\nsources, please send\nto elizabeth.hoile@hpa.org.uk.\nReferences:\n1.

Pending development of\nconfirmatory laboratory testing capacity, CDC's interim suspected SARS case\ndefinition (2) is based on clinical criteria and epidemiologic linkage to\nother SARS cases or areas with community transmission of SARS. This case\ndefinition will be updated periodically as new information becomes\navailable. Epidemiologic and laboratory investigations of SARS are ongoing.\nAs of 2 Apr 2003, a total of 2223 suspected and/or probable SARS cases\nhave been reported to WHO from 16 countries, including the United States\n(3,4). The reported SARS cases include 78 deaths (case-fatality proportion:\n3.5 percent). This report summarizes SARS cases among U.S. residents and\nsurveillance and prevention activities in the United States.\nDescriptive Epidemiology\n----------------------\nAs of April 2, CDC had received 100 reports of suspected SARS cases [see\nFigure 1 on webpage for epidemiologic curve\n<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5213a1.htm>] from 28 states; 81\n(81 percent) cases occurred among adults [see table 1 below]. Of these 100\nsuspected cases, 94 (94%) persons had traveled within the 10 days before\nillness onset to the areas listed in the case definition (revised on 29 Mar\n2003 to include all of mainland China as an area with documented or\nsuspected community transmission), 4 had household contact with a person\nwith suspected SARS, and 2 were health-care workers (HCWs) who provided\nmedical care to a patient with suspected SARS.\nManifestations of SARS have been relatively less severe among patients in\nthe United States than among those reported elsewhere. A majority of U.S.\npatients had normal chest radiographs, and 23 (23 percent) were reported to\nhave pneumonia or respiratory distress syndrome on chest radiograph, thereby\nmeeting the WHO case definition of a probable case (4). As of 2 Apr 2003, of\nthe 40 (40 percent) patients who were hospitalized for greater than 24\nhours, 13 (33 percent of 40) remained hospitalized; one patient had required\nmechanical ventilatory support, and no deaths have been reported.\nReports on the clinical status of suspected SARS cases are being received\nby state health departments and CDC, and household and HCW contacts are\nbeing monitored for the possibility of secondary transmission. Since SARS\ninvestigations in the United States began, some persons believed initially\nto have suspected SARS have been excluded on the basis of more complete\nclinical histories (e.g., no documented fever or respiratory symptoms) or\nbecause of testing results that indicated other etiologies. Alternative\ndiagnoses have included infection with influenza virus, respiratory\nsyncytial virus, _Haemophilus influenzae_, _Streptococcus pneumoniae_, and\n_Staphylococcus aureus_. Community transmission of SARS has not been\nidentified in the United States; transmission to HCWs has been observed in\none cluster involving 2 HCWs, compared with numerous reports of possible\ntransmission to HCWs in other countries (5--7).\nEnhanced Surveillance for SARS Related to Travel\n---------------------------------------------\nAs a precautionary measure, WHO has recommended that persons traveling to\nHong Kong and Guangdong Province of China consider postponing all but\nessential travel. CDC has issued a travel advisory recommending that\npersons planning nonessential or elective travel to mainland China, Hong\nKong, Hanoi, or Singapore consider postponing such travel until further\nnotice.\nTo detect possible SARS cases among travelers returning to the United States\nfrom these areas, CDC and state and local health authorities have\nimplemented enhanced surveillance. Since 16 Mar 2003, notices (available in\nEnglish, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Vietnamese) have been provided to\napproximately 220 000 passengers arriving in the United States on airline\nflights originating from China, Vietnam, and Singapore to inform\ndisembarking passengers and crew about SARS. Persons disembarking from these\ncountries are urged to monitor their health for 10 days after return, to\nseek medical care if they develop fever of greater than 100.5 F (39.0 C) and\ncough or difficulty breathing within 10 days of travel, and to inform their\nhealth-care providers about recent travel to regions where SARS cases have\nbeen reported.\nLaboratory Investigations\n----------------------\nEfforts are ongoing to characterize further the role of a previously\nunrecognized coronavirus in SARS. Polymerase chain reaction-based assays,\nisolation studies, electron microscopic studies, and histologic studies are\nbeing developed to detect virus in specimens from patients with suspected\nSARS. Indirect immunoflorescence antibody assays and enzyme immunoassays to\nanti-coronavirus antibody as an indicator of infection have been developed\nand are being applied to specimens from suspected SARS patients. Laboratory\nstudies at CDC and other laboratories in the WHO-organized SARS Laboratory\nNetwork have detected this new coronavirus in SARS patients, which is\nconsistent with an etiologic role in this disease. CDC has detected human\nmetapneumovirus from one SARS patient, and other laboratories also have\ndetected metapneumovirus from SARS patients (6). The role of these viruses\nin the pathogenesis of SARS is unclear.\nMMWR Editorial Note:\n--------------------\nThe number of SARS cases, and the number of countries reporting such cases,\ncontinues to increase worldwide. Transmission within hospitals and\nhouseholds continues in some areas, and transmission within communities\n(e.g., Hong Kong) continues to be reported. In the absence of a complete\nunderstanding of how SARS is transmitted, efforts to limit transmission in\nthe United States have focused on early identification of potential cases\nthrough surveillance and implementation of infection-control measures in\nhealth-care settings and the community.\nCDC has developed interim infection-control guidelines for use in U.S.\nhealth-care and household settings (8). These recommendations are based on\nexperience in the United States to date and will be revised as more\ninformation becomes available. Infection-control practitioners and\nclinicians providing medical care for patients with suspected SARS should\nconsult these guidelines frequently to keep current with recommendations.\nTransmission in health-care settings has been documented in several\ncountries. Transmission to HCWs appears to have occurred primarily after\nclose contact with symptomatic persons before recommended infection-control\nprecautions for SARS were implemented. Because a primary strategy to reduce\ntransmission in health-care settings is early recognition and isolation of\npatients who might have SARS, triage practices in hospitals and\nambulatory-care settings might require reevaluation. CDC guidelines for\ntriage of potential SARS cases are available at\n<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/sars/triage_interim_guidance.htm>.\nIn the United States, decisions to admit persons with suspected SARS to\nhealth-care facilities should be based on clinical criteria. Patients with\nsuspected SARS who are discharged should limit interactions outside the\nhome and not go to work, school, out-of-home child care, or other public\nareas until 10 days after resolution of fever and respiratory symptoms.\nAdditional guidance for these patients is available at\n<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/sars/ic-closecontacts.htm>.\nThe majority of U.S. residents with SARS have recovered or stabilized\nclinically without specific antiviral therapy. The U.S. case-fatality\nproportion is lower than that reported in some other countries (3).\nPossible explanations for this include differing case definitions among\ncountries or differences in the sensitivity of surveillance, leading to\nidentification in the United States of patients with less severe or early\nmanifestations of infection or of a larger proportion of patients with\nother respiratory illnesses. Until confirmatory laboratory testing is\navailable, the case definition will include clinical criteria more likely\nto identify potentially infectious persons. Various therapies, including\nantiviral agents (e.g., oseltamivir or ribavirin) and corticosteroids, have\nbeen administered to SARS patients, but the efficacy of these therapies has\nnot been determined.\nHealth-care providers of patients whose illness is consistent with the case\ndefinition for SARS should continue diagnostic evaluation for other causes\nof respiratory illness and, when appropriate, empiric therapy that includes\nactivity against organisms associated with community-acquired pneumonia of\nuncertain etiology, including both typical and atypical respiratory\npathogens (9). Health-care providers who report suspected SARS cases should\nnotify their state health departments if these patients receive\nconfirmatory testing that indicates a diagnosis other than SARS.\nInformation on suggested diagnostic testing and evaluation for persons with\npossible SARS is available at http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/sars/diagnosis.htm.\nAirline travel\n----------\nThe potential for transmission of SARS during airline travel is unknown.\nTransmission of other infectious agents (e.g., _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_)\nduring air travel has been demonstrated (10). When an airline flight crew\nreports a passenger with respiratory illness, quarantine officials might\nboard the aircraft on arrival in the United States to assess whether the\npassenger's symptoms match the case definition of SARS and give the\npassenger information about following up. If a passenger with suspected\nSARS is identified after passengers have disembarked, public health\nauthorities will work with the airline to contact passengers and crew for\ninformation about the development of an illness suggestive of SARS.\nAlthough ill travelers have spread SARS rapidly across international\nborders, the proportion, if any, of persons who acquired SARS during\ninternational travel as a result of in-flight transmission is unknown.\nDespite vigorous efforts to identify and isolate suspected cases, reducing\ntransmission of the etiologic agents of SARS might be difficult.\nUnderstanding the epidemiology of respiratory pathogens such as those that\ncause SARS is challenging; approximately 40-60 percent of persons with\npneumonia do not have a defined etiology, even when extensive testing for\nknown respiratory pathogens is attempted (9). Minimizing transmission will\nrequire sustained attention to infection-control interventions within\nhealth-care settings and the community. The development of laboratory\ntesting techniques to identify infected persons rapidly will be an\nimportant step toward understanding and reducing transmission of SARS.\nReferences\n--------\n1.

This is an increase of\n4 to 5-fold in the global totals in the last 7 days\n<http://www.who.int/csr/sarscountry/2003_03_25/en/> with the greatest\nproportionate and absolute increases being in China (Hong Kong & Guangdong\nProvince), and to a much lesser extent in Canada. There has been little\nabsolute rise in other country totals.\n18 countries have now reported cases but in most of these no transmission\nseems to have occurred. Local transmission has occurred in Hanoi (Vietnam),\nSingapore, Toronto (Canada), Taiwan, and the following parts of China:\nGuangdong Province;\nBeijing; Shanxi; and Hong Kong SAR. In the United Kingdom 3 probable SARS\ncases have been reported; all have now recovered. Indeed, the only areas\nwhere WHO feels there is evidence consistent with current transmission are\nHong Kong and Guangdong\n<http://www.who.int/csr/sarsarchive/2003_02_02b/en/>, and the WHO has issued\nadvice to international travellers not to travel to or through either area.\nGuangdong and Hong Kong\n--------------------------\nInformation about the outbreaks in Guangdong is limited, but the latest\nreports give a significant increase of over 350 cases during March 2003\n<http://www.who.int/csr/sarsarchive/2003_02_02b/en/>. Detailed\ndescriptions from Hong Kong are now available. Following transmission\ncentering on a large hotel, there have been intense hospital outbreaks\ninvolving staff, patient and families of staff (1) where community\ntransmission has been established. There is now evidence of community\ntransmission within a large housing complex.\nMeasures introduced by Hong Kong, Singapore, and Canada to control the\nlocal spread of SARS have included school closures (Hong Kong and\nSingapore), the quarantine of entire residential buildings (Hong Kong), and\nthe restriction of non-essential access to hospitals -- all 3,\n<http://www.health.gov.on.ca/english/public/pub/disease/sars_6.html>.\nAlthough such precautions are not yet necessary in Europe, the experience\nin Canada is a sobering reminder of what could happen in any country\nreceiving a case.\nOntario, Canada\n---------------\nThe outbreak in Canada began with a Toronto woman who developed respiratory\nsymptoms 2 days after returning from Hong Kong. She died at home 10 days\nlater, but meanwhile appears to have transmitted infection to 4 members of\nher family. One of them, her adult son, was admitted to a local hospital\nwith respiratory symptoms. He spent some time in an open part of the\nemergency department before being transferred to the intensive care unit,\nwhere he remained until his death, 6 days after admission. It is now\napparent that transmission of SARS has occurred within the hospital. A\npatient who was in the next bed in the emergency department developed\nsymptoms of SARS 3 days after his visit to the emergency department, and\ndied 11 days later. A large number of hospital staff who worked in the\nemergency department and the intensive care unit where the son of the index\ncase was cared for have now presented with symptoms of SARS. Transmission\nin the intensive care unit may have been from the patient or from visiting\nfamily members, some of whom were symptomatic at the time they visited (2).\nThe Province of Ontario declared a health emergency on 26 Mar 2003, and on\n1 Apr 2003 a sixth death from SARS was reported from Toronto. As of 1 Apr\n2003, Ontario has reported 51 probable cases of SARS. The hospital has now\nbeen closed to new admissions.\nThe experience in Canada illustrates that highly developed countries can be\nvulnerable to transmission from imported cases of SARS, especially in\nhospitals (3,4). Most of the data have been consistent with transmission\nthrough large droplets or body fluids. Aerosol transmission cannot be\ntotally discounted, but if it occurs it is uncommon. If the causative\norganism had been readily transmissible by aerosol, many more cases would\nhave been expected, especially in the countries where transmission has\nslowed or never started. In Hong Kong there are some patterns of infection\nthat are most easily explained by environmental transmission such as\nfomites.\nIf the infection is not recognised early and appropriate infection control\nprecautions put in place, extensive transmission can occur. Those most at\nrisk seem to be family members and healthcare workers who have close\ncontact with symptomatic cases. It is worth noting that there have been no\nreported secondary cases from 2 hospitalised Canadian SARS cases where\nfamily members were not permitted to visit and healthcare workers adhered\nto strict infection control precautions.\nClinicians, accident and emergency, intensive treatment units, and\ninfectious disease staff in Europe should be alert to the possibility of\nSARS in people with fever and respiratory symptoms, IF they have recently\nreturned from areas where transmission of SARS is ongoing (currently Hong\nKong, and probably Guangdong) or who have had contact with a case of SARS\n<http://www.phls.co.uk/topics_az/SARS/management_guidance.htm>. When\npatients suspected of having SARS are admitted to hospital, it is vital\nthat infection control precautions are rapidly implemented and rigorously\nenforced <http://www.phls.co.uk/topics_az/SARS/hospital_guidance.htm>.\nUpdates on the developing situation are also available from WHO\n(<http://www.who.int/csr/sars/en/>) , on ProMED\n(<http://www.promedmail.org>), and at the websites of various national\npublic health organisations, including CDC\n(<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/sars/>), Health Canada\n(<http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/pphb-dgspsp/sars-sras/index.html>), and the Health\nProtection Agency in the United Kingdom\n(<http://www.phls.org.uk/topics_az/SARS/menu.htm>)(5-7).\nEurosurveillance Weekly welcomes comments on other useful information\nsources, please send\nto elizabeth.hoile@hpa.org.uk.\nReferences:\n1.

Pending development of\nconfirmatory laboratory testing capacity, CDC's interim suspected SARS case\ndefinition (2) is based on clinical criteria and epidemiologic linkage to\nother SARS cases or areas with community transmission of SARS. This case\ndefinition will be updated periodically as new information becomes\navailable. Epidemiologic and laboratory investigations of SARS are ongoing.\nAs of 2 Apr 2003, a total of 2223 suspected and/or probable SARS cases\nhave been reported to WHO from 16 countries, including the United States\n(3,4). The reported SARS cases include 78 deaths (case-fatality proportion:\n3.5 percent). This report summarizes SARS cases among U.S. residents and\nsurveillance and prevention activities in the United States.\nDescriptive Epidemiology\n----------------------\nAs of April 2, CDC had received 100 reports of suspected SARS cases [see\nFigure 1 on webpage for epidemiologic curve\n<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5213a1.htm>] from 28 states; 81\n(81 percent) cases occurred among adults [see table 1 below]. Of these 100\nsuspected cases, 94 (94%) persons had traveled within the 10 days before\nillness onset to the areas listed in the case definition (revised on 29 Mar\n2003 to include all of mainland China as an area with documented or\nsuspected community transmission), 4 had household contact with a person\nwith suspected SARS, and 2 were health-care workers (HCWs) who provided\nmedical care to a patient with suspected SARS.\nManifestations of SARS have been relatively less severe among patients in\nthe United States than among those reported elsewhere. A majority of U.S.\npatients had normal chest radiographs, and 23 (23 percent) were reported to\nhave pneumonia or respiratory distress syndrome on chest radiograph, thereby\nmeeting the WHO case definition of a probable case (4). As of 2 Apr 2003, of\nthe 40 (40 percent) patients who were hospitalized for greater than 24\nhours, 13 (33 percent of 40) remained hospitalized; one patient had required\nmechanical ventilatory support, and no deaths have been reported.\nReports on the clinical status of suspected SARS cases are being received\nby state health departments and CDC, and household and HCW contacts are\nbeing monitored for the possibility of secondary transmission. Since SARS\ninvestigations in the United States began, some persons believed initially\nto have suspected SARS have been excluded on the basis of more complete\nclinical histories (e.g., no documented fever or respiratory symptoms) or\nbecause of testing results that indicated other etiologies. Alternative\ndiagnoses have included infection with influenza virus, respiratory\nsyncytial virus, _Haemophilus influenzae_, _Streptococcus pneumoniae_, and\n_Staphylococcus aureus_. Community transmission of SARS has not been\nidentified in the United States; transmission to HCWs has been observed in\none cluster involving 2 HCWs, compared with numerous reports of possible\ntransmission to HCWs in other countries (5--7).\nEnhanced Surveillance for SARS Related to Travel\n---------------------------------------------\nAs a precautionary measure, WHO has recommended that persons traveling to\nHong Kong and Guangdong Province of China consider postponing all but\nessential travel. CDC has issued a travel advisory recommending that\npersons planning nonessential or elective travel to mainland China, Hong\nKong, Hanoi, or Singapore consider postponing such travel until further\nnotice.\nTo detect possible SARS cases among travelers returning to the United States\nfrom these areas, CDC and state and local health authorities have\nimplemented enhanced surveillance. Since 16 Mar 2003, notices (available in\nEnglish, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Vietnamese) have been provided to\napproximately 220 000 passengers arriving in the United States on airline\nflights originating from China, Vietnam, and Singapore to inform\ndisembarking passengers and crew about SARS. Persons disembarking from these\ncountries are urged to monitor their health for 10 days after return, to\nseek medical care if they develop fever of greater than 100.5 F (39.0 C) and\ncough or difficulty breathing within 10 days of travel, and to inform their\nhealth-care providers about recent travel to regions where SARS cases have\nbeen reported.\nLaboratory Investigations\n----------------------\nEfforts are ongoing to characterize further the role of a previously\nunrecognized coronavirus in SARS. Polymerase chain reaction-based assays,\nisolation studies, electron microscopic studies, and histologic studies are\nbeing developed to detect virus in specimens from patients with suspected\nSARS. Indirect immunoflorescence antibody assays and enzyme immunoassays to\nanti-coronavirus antibody as an indicator of infection have been developed\nand are being applied to specimens from suspected SARS patients. Laboratory\nstudies at CDC and other laboratories in the WHO-organized SARS Laboratory\nNetwork have detected this new coronavirus in SARS patients, which is\nconsistent with an etiologic role in this disease. CDC has detected human\nmetapneumovirus from one SARS patient, and other laboratories also have\ndetected metapneumovirus from SARS patients (6). The role of these viruses\nin the pathogenesis of SARS is unclear.\nMMWR Editorial Note:\n--------------------\nThe number of SARS cases, and the number of countries reporting such cases,\ncontinues to increase worldwide. Transmission within hospitals and\nhouseholds continues in some areas, and transmission within communities\n(e.g., Hong Kong) continues to be reported. In the absence of a complete\nunderstanding of how SARS is transmitted, efforts to limit transmission in\nthe United States have focused on early identification of potential cases\nthrough surveillance and implementation of infection-control measures in\nhealth-care settings and the community.\nCDC has developed interim infection-control guidelines for use in U.S.\nhealth-care and household settings (8). These recommendations are based on\nexperience in the United States to date and will be revised as more\ninformation becomes available. Infection-control practitioners and\nclinicians providing medical care for patients with suspected SARS should\nconsult these guidelines frequently to keep current with recommendations.\nTransmission in health-care settings has been documented in several\ncountries. Transmission to HCWs appears to have occurred primarily after\nclose contact with symptomatic persons before recommended infection-control\nprecautions for SARS were implemented. Because a primary strategy to reduce\ntransmission in health-care settings is early recognition and isolation of\npatients who might have SARS, triage practices in hospitals and\nambulatory-care settings might require reevaluation. CDC guidelines for\ntriage of potential SARS cases are available at\n<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/sars/triage_interim_guidance.htm>.\nIn the United States, decisions to admit persons with suspected SARS to\nhealth-care facilities should be based on clinical criteria. Patients with\nsuspected SARS who are discharged should limit interactions outside the\nhome and not go to work, school, out-of-home child care, or other public\nareas until 10 days after resolution of fever and respiratory symptoms.\nAdditional guidance for these patients is available at\n<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/sars/ic-closecontacts.htm>.\nThe majority of U.S. residents with SARS have recovered or stabilized\nclinically without specific antiviral therapy. The U.S. case-fatality\nproportion is lower than that reported in some other countries (3).\nPossible explanations for this include differing case definitions among\ncountries or differences in the sensitivity of surveillance, leading to\nidentification in the United States of patients with less severe or early\nmanifestations of infection or of a larger proportion of patients with\nother respiratory illnesses. Until confirmatory laboratory testing is\navailable, the case definition will include clinical criteria more likely\nto identify potentially infectious persons. Various therapies, including\nantiviral agents (e.g., oseltamivir or ribavirin) and corticosteroids, have\nbeen administered to SARS patients, but the efficacy of these therapies has\nnot been determined.\nHealth-care providers of patients whose illness is consistent with the case\ndefinition for SARS should continue diagnostic evaluation for other causes\nof respiratory illness and, when appropriate, empiric therapy that includes\nactivity against organisms associated with community-acquired pneumonia of\nuncertain etiology, including both typical and atypical respiratory\npathogens (9). Health-care providers who report suspected SARS cases should\nnotify their state health departments if these patients receive\nconfirmatory testing that indicates a diagnosis other than SARS.\nInformation on suggested diagnostic testing and evaluation for persons with\npossible SARS is available at http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/sars/diagnosis.htm.\nAirline travel\n----------\nThe potential for transmission of SARS during airline travel is unknown.\nTransmission of other infectious agents (e.g., _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_)\nduring air travel has been demonstrated (10). When an airline flight crew\nreports a passenger with respiratory illness, quarantine officials might\nboard the aircraft on arrival in the United States to assess whether the\npassenger's symptoms match the case definition of SARS and give the\npassenger information about following up. If a passenger with suspected\nSARS is identified after passengers have disembarked, public health\nauthorities will work with the airline to contact passengers and crew for\ninformation about the development of an illness suggestive of SARS.\nAlthough ill travelers have spread SARS rapidly across international\nborders, the proportion, if any, of persons who acquired SARS during\ninternational travel as a result of in-flight transmission is unknown.\nDespite vigorous efforts to identify and isolate suspected cases, reducing\ntransmission of the etiologic agents of SARS might be difficult.\nUnderstanding the epidemiology of respiratory pathogens such as those that\ncause SARS is challenging; approximately 40-60 percent of persons with\npneumonia do not have a defined etiology, even when extensive testing for\nknown respiratory pathogens is attempted (9). Minimizing transmission will\nrequire sustained attention to infection-control interventions within\nhealth-care settings and the community. The development of laboratory\ntesting techniques to identify infected persons rapidly will be an\nimportant step toward understanding and reducing transmission of SARS.\nReferences\n--------\n1.

This is an increase of\n4 to 5-fold in the global totals in the last 7 days\n<http://www.who.int/csr/sarscountry/2003_03_25/en/> with the greatest\nproportionate and absolute increases being in China (Hong Kong & Guangdong\nProvince), and to a much lesser extent in Canada. There has been little\nabsolute rise in other country totals.\n18 countries have now reported cases but in most of these no transmission\nseems to have occurred. Local transmission has occurred in Hanoi (Vietnam),\nSingapore, Toronto (Canada), Taiwan, and the following parts of China:\nGuangdong Province;\nBeijing; Shanxi; and Hong Kong SAR. In the United Kingdom 3 probable SARS\ncases have been reported; all have now recovered. Indeed, the only areas\nwhere WHO feels there is evidence consistent with current transmission are\nHong Kong and Guangdong\n<http://www.who.int/csr/sarsarchive/2003_02_02b/en/>, and the WHO has issued\nadvice to international travellers not to travel to or through either area.\nGuangdong and Hong Kong\n--------------------------\nInformation about the outbreaks in Guangdong is limited, but the latest\nreports give a significant increase of over 350 cases during March 2003\n<http://www.who.int/csr/sarsarchive/2003_02_02b/en/>. Detailed\ndescriptions from Hong Kong are now available. Following transmission\ncentering on a large hotel, there have been intense hospital outbreaks\ninvolving staff, patient and families of staff (1) where community\ntransmission has been established. There is now evidence of community\ntransmission within a large housing complex.\nMeasures introduced by Hong Kong, Singapore, and Canada to control the\nlocal spread of SARS have included school closures (Hong Kong and\nSingapore), the quarantine of entire residential buildings (Hong Kong), and\nthe restriction of non-essential access to hospitals -- all 3,\n<http://www.health.gov.on.ca/english/public/pub/disease/sars_6.html>.\nAlthough such precautions are not yet necessary in Europe, the experience\nin Canada is a sobering reminder of what could happen in any country\nreceiving a case.\nOntario, Canada\n---------------\nThe outbreak in Canada began with a Toronto woman who developed respiratory\nsymptoms 2 days after returning from Hong Kong. She died at home 10 days\nlater, but meanwhile appears to have transmitted infection to 4 members of\nher family. One of them, her adult son, was admitted to a local hospital\nwith respiratory symptoms. He spent some time in an open part of the\nemergency department before being transferred to the intensive care unit,\nwhere he remained until his death, 6 days after admission. It is now\napparent that transmission of SARS has occurred within the hospital. A\npatient who was in the next bed in the emergency department developed\nsymptoms of SARS 3 days after his visit to the emergency department, and\ndied 11 days later. A large number of hospital staff who worked in the\nemergency department and the intensive care unit where the son of the index\ncase was cared for have now presented with symptoms of SARS. Transmission\nin the intensive care unit may have been from the patient or from visiting\nfamily members, some of whom were symptomatic at the time they visited (2).\nThe Province of Ontario declared a health emergency on 26 Mar 2003, and on\n1 Apr 2003 a sixth death from SARS was reported from Toronto. As of 1 Apr\n2003, Ontario has reported 51 probable cases of SARS. The hospital has now\nbeen closed to new admissions.\nThe experience in Canada illustrates that highly developed countries can be\nvulnerable to transmission from imported cases of SARS, especially in\nhospitals (3,4). Most of the data have been consistent with transmission\nthrough large droplets or body fluids. Aerosol transmission cannot be\ntotally discounted, but if it occurs it is uncommon. If the causative\norganism had been readily transmissible by aerosol, many more cases would\nhave been expected, especially in the countries where transmission has\nslowed or never started. In Hong Kong there are some patterns of infection\nthat are most easily explained by environmental transmission such as\nfomites.\nIf the infection is not recognised early and appropriate infection control\nprecautions put in place, extensive transmission can occur. Those most at\nrisk seem to be family members and healthcare workers who have close\ncontact with symptomatic cases. It is worth noting that there have been no\nreported secondary cases from 2 hospitalised Canadian SARS cases where\nfamily members were not permitted to visit and healthcare workers adhered\nto strict infection control precautions.\nClinicians, accident and emergency, intensive treatment units, and\ninfectious disease staff in Europe should be alert to the possibility of\nSARS in people with fever and respiratory symptoms, IF they have recently\nreturned from areas where transmission of SARS is ongoing (currently Hong\nKong, and probably Guangdong) or who have had contact with a case of SARS\n<http://www.phls.co.uk/topics_az/SARS/management_guidance.htm>. When\npatients suspected of having SARS are admitted to hospital, it is vital\nthat infection control precautions are rapidly implemented and rigorously\nenforced <http://www.phls.co.uk/topics_az/SARS/hospital_guidance.htm>.\nUpdates on the developing situation are also available from WHO\n(<http://www.who.int/csr/sars/en/>) , on ProMED\n(<http://www.promedmail.org>), and at the websites of various national\npublic health organisations, including CDC\n(<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/sars/>), Health Canada\n(<http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/pphb-dgspsp/sars-sras/index.html>), and the Health\nProtection Agency in the United Kingdom\n(<http://www.phls.org.uk/topics_az/SARS/menu.htm>)(5-7).\nEurosurveillance Weekly welcomes comments on other useful information\nsources, please send\nto elizabeth.hoile@hpa.org.uk.\nReferences:\n1.

Pending development of\nconfirmatory laboratory testing capacity, CDC's interim suspected SARS case\ndefinition (2) is based on clinical criteria and epidemiologic linkage to\nother SARS cases or areas with community transmission of SARS. This case\ndefinition will be updated periodically as new information becomes\navailable. Epidemiologic and laboratory investigations of SARS are ongoing.\nAs of 2 Apr 2003, a total of 2223 suspected and/or probable SARS cases\nhave been reported to WHO from 16 countries, including the United States\n(3,4). The reported SARS cases include 78 deaths (case-fatality proportion:\n3.5 percent). This report summarizes SARS cases among U.S. residents and\nsurveillance and prevention activities in the United States.\nDescriptive Epidemiology\n----------------------\nAs of April 2, CDC had received 100 reports of suspected SARS cases [see\nFigure 1 on webpage for epidemiologic curve\n<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5213a1.htm>] from 28 states; 81\n(81 percent) cases occurred among adults [see table 1 below]. Of these 100\nsuspected cases, 94 (94%) persons had traveled within the 10 days before\nillness onset to the areas listed in the case definition (revised on 29 Mar\n2003 to include all of mainland China as an area with documented or\nsuspected community transmission), 4 had household contact with a person\nwith suspected SARS, and 2 were health-care workers (HCWs) who provided\nmedical care to a patient with suspected SARS.\nManifestations of SARS have been relatively less severe among patients in\nthe United States than among those reported elsewhere. A majority of U.S.\npatients had normal chest radiographs, and 23 (23 percent) were reported to\nhave pneumonia or respiratory distress syndrome on chest radiograph, thereby\nmeeting the WHO case definition of a probable case (4). As of 2 Apr 2003, of\nthe 40 (40 percent) patients who were hospitalized for greater than 24\nhours, 13 (33 percent of 40) remained hospitalized; one patient had required\nmechanical ventilatory support, and no deaths have been reported.\nReports on the clinical status of suspected SARS cases are being received\nby state health departments and CDC, and household and HCW contacts are\nbeing monitored for the possibility of secondary transmission. Since SARS\ninvestigations in the United States began, some persons believed initially\nto have suspected SARS have been excluded on the basis of more complete\nclinical histories (e.g., no documented fever or respiratory symptoms) or\nbecause of testing results that indicated other etiologies. Alternative\ndiagnoses have included infection with influenza virus, respiratory\nsyncytial virus, _Haemophilus influenzae_, _Streptococcus pneumoniae_, and\n_Staphylococcus aureus_. Community transmission of SARS has not been\nidentified in the United States; transmission to HCWs has been observed in\none cluster involving 2 HCWs, compared with numerous reports of possible\ntransmission to HCWs in other countries (5--7).\nEnhanced Surveillance for SARS Related to Travel\n---------------------------------------------\nAs a precautionary measure, WHO has recommended that persons traveling to\nHong Kong and Guangdong Province of China consider postponing all but\nessential travel. CDC has issued a travel advisory recommending that\npersons planning nonessential or elective travel to mainland China, Hong\nKong, Hanoi, or Singapore consider postponing such travel until further\nnotice.\nTo detect possible SARS cases among travelers returning to the United States\nfrom these areas, CDC and state and local health authorities have\nimplemented enhanced surveillance. Since 16 Mar 2003, notices (available in\nEnglish, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Vietnamese) have been provided to\napproximately 220 000 passengers arriving in the United States on airline\nflights originating from China, Vietnam, and Singapore to inform\ndisembarking passengers and crew about SARS. Persons disembarking from these\ncountries are urged to monitor their health for 10 days after return, to\nseek medical care if they develop fever of greater than 100.5 F (39.0 C) and\ncough or difficulty breathing within 10 days of travel, and to inform their\nhealth-care providers about recent travel to regions where SARS cases have\nbeen reported.\nLaboratory Investigations\n----------------------\nEfforts are ongoing to characterize further the role of a previously\nunrecognized coronavirus in SARS. Polymerase chain reaction-based assays,\nisolation studies, electron microscopic studies, and histologic studies are\nbeing developed to detect virus in specimens from patients with suspected\nSARS. Indirect immunoflorescence antibody assays and enzyme immunoassays to\nanti-coronavirus antibody as an indicator of infection have been developed\nand are being applied to specimens from suspected SARS patients. Laboratory\nstudies at CDC and other laboratories in the WHO-organized SARS Laboratory\nNetwork have detected this new coronavirus in SARS patients, which is\nconsistent with an etiologic role in this disease. CDC has detected human\nmetapneumovirus from one SARS patient, and other laboratories also have\ndetected metapneumovirus from SARS patients (6). The role of these viruses\nin the pathogenesis of SARS is unclear.\nMMWR Editorial Note:\n--------------------\nThe number of SARS cases, and the number of countries reporting such cases,\ncontinues to increase worldwide. Transmission within hospitals and\nhouseholds continues in some areas, and transmission within communities\n(e.g., Hong Kong) continues to be reported. In the absence of a complete\nunderstanding of how SARS is transmitted, efforts to limit transmission in\nthe United States have focused on early identification of potential cases\nthrough surveillance and implementation of infection-control measures in\nhealth-care settings and the community.\nCDC has developed interim infection-control guidelines for use in U.S.\nhealth-care and household settings (8). These recommendations are based on\nexperience in the United States to date and will be revised as more\ninformation becomes available. Infection-control practitioners and\nclinicians providing medical care for patients with suspected SARS should\nconsult these guidelines frequently to keep current with recommendations.\nTransmission in health-care settings has been documented in several\ncountries. Transmission to HCWs appears to have occurred primarily after\nclose contact with symptomatic persons before recommended infection-control\nprecautions for SARS were implemented. Because a primary strategy to reduce\ntransmission in health-care settings is early recognition and isolation of\npatients who might have SARS, triage practices in hospitals and\nambulatory-care settings might require reevaluation. CDC guidelines for\ntriage of potential SARS cases are available at\n<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/sars/triage_interim_guidance.htm>.\nIn the United States, decisions to admit persons with suspected SARS to\nhealth-care facilities should be based on clinical criteria. Patients with\nsuspected SARS who are discharged should limit interactions outside the\nhome and not go to work, school, out-of-home child care, or other public\nareas until 10 days after resolution of fever and respiratory symptoms.\nAdditional guidance for these patients is available at\n<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/sars/ic-closecontacts.htm>.\nThe majority of U.S. residents with SARS have recovered or stabilized\nclinically without specific antiviral therapy. The U.S. case-fatality\nproportion is lower than that reported in some other countries (3).\nPossible explanations for this include differing case definitions among\ncountries or differences in the sensitivity of surveillance, leading to\nidentification in the United States of patients with less severe or early\nmanifestations of infection or of a larger proportion of patients with\nother respiratory illnesses. Until confirmatory laboratory testing is\navailable, the case definition will include clinical criteria more likely\nto identify potentially infectious persons. Various therapies, including\nantiviral agents (e.g., oseltamivir or ribavirin) and corticosteroids, have\nbeen administered to SARS patients, but the efficacy of these therapies has\nnot been determined.\nHealth-care providers of patients whose illness is consistent with the case\ndefinition for SARS should continue diagnostic evaluation for other causes\nof respiratory illness and, when appropriate, empiric therapy that includes\nactivity against organisms associated with community-acquired pneumonia of\nuncertain etiology, including both typical and atypical respiratory\npathogens (9). Health-care providers who report suspected SARS cases should\nnotify their state health departments if these patients receive\nconfirmatory testing that indicates a diagnosis other than SARS.\nInformation on suggested diagnostic testing and evaluation for persons with\npossible SARS is available at http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/sars/diagnosis.htm.\nAirline travel\n----------\nThe potential for transmission of SARS during airline travel is unknown.\nTransmission of other infectious agents (e.g., _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_)\nduring air travel has been demonstrated (10). When an airline flight crew\nreports a passenger with respiratory illness, quarantine officials might\nboard the aircraft on arrival in the United States to assess whether the\npassenger's symptoms match the case definition of SARS and give the\npassenger information about following up. If a passenger with suspected\nSARS is identified after passengers have disembarked, public health\nauthorities will work with the airline to contact passengers and crew for\ninformation about the development of an illness suggestive of SARS.\nAlthough ill travelers have spread SARS rapidly across international\nborders, the proportion, if any, of persons who acquired SARS during\ninternational travel as a result of in-flight transmission is unknown.\nDespite vigorous efforts to identify and isolate suspected cases, reducing\ntransmission of the etiologic agents of SARS might be difficult.\nUnderstanding the epidemiology of respiratory pathogens such as those that\ncause SARS is challenging; approximately 40-60 percent of persons with\npneumonia do not have a defined etiology, even when extensive testing for\nknown respiratory pathogens is attempted (9). Minimizing transmission will\nrequire sustained attention to infection-control interventions within\nhealth-care settings and the community. The development of laboratory\ntesting techniques to identify infected persons rapidly will be an\nimportant step toward understanding and reducing transmission of SARS.\nReferences\n--------\n1.

This is an increase of\n4 to 5-fold in the global totals in the last 7 days\n<http://www.who.int/csr/sarscountry/2003_03_25/en/> with the greatest\nproportionate and absolute increases being in China (Hong Kong & Guangdong\nProvince), and to a much lesser extent in Canada. There has been little\nabsolute rise in other country totals.\n18 countries have now reported cases but in most of these no transmission\nseems to have occurred. Local transmission has occurred in Hanoi (Vietnam),\nSingapore, Toronto (Canada), Taiwan, and the following parts of China:\nGuangdong Province;\nBeijing; Shanxi; and Hong Kong SAR. In the United Kingdom 3 probable SARS\ncases have been reported; all have now recovered. Indeed, the only areas\nwhere WHO feels there is evidence consistent with current transmission are\nHong Kong and Guangdong\n<http://www.who.int/csr/sarsarchive/2003_02_02b/en/>, and the WHO has issued\nadvice to international travellers not to travel to or through either area.\nGuangdong and Hong Kong\n--------------------------\nInformation about the outbreaks in Guangdong is limited, but the latest\nreports give a significant increase of over 350 cases during March 2003\n<http://www.who.int/csr/sarsarchive/2003_02_02b/en/>. Detailed\ndescriptions from Hong Kong are now available. Following transmission\ncentering on a large hotel, there have been intense hospital outbreaks\ninvolving staff, patient and families of staff (1) where community\ntransmission has been established. There is now evidence of community\ntransmission within a large housing complex.\nMeasures introduced by Hong Kong, Singapore, and Canada to control the\nlocal spread of SARS have included school closures (Hong Kong and\nSingapore), the quarantine of entire residential buildings (Hong Kong), and\nthe restriction of non-essential access to hospitals -- all 3,\n<http://www.health.gov.on.ca/english/public/pub/disease/sars_6.html>.\nAlthough such precautions are not yet necessary in Europe, the experience\nin Canada is a sobering reminder of what could happen in any country\nreceiving a case.\nOntario, Canada\n---------------\nThe outbreak in Canada began with a Toronto woman who developed respiratory\nsymptoms 2 days after returning from Hong Kong. She died at home 10 days\nlater, but meanwhile appears to have transmitted infection to 4 members of\nher family. One of them, her adult son, was admitted to a local hospital\nwith respiratory symptoms. He spent some time in an open part of the\nemergency department before being transferred to the intensive care unit,\nwhere he remained until his death, 6 days after admission. It is now\napparent that transmission of SARS has occurred within the hospital. A\npatient who was in the next bed in the emergency department developed\nsymptoms of SARS 3 days after his visit to the emergency department, and\ndied 11 days later. A large number of hospital staff who worked in the\nemergency department and the intensive care unit where the son of the index\ncase was cared for have now presented with symptoms of SARS. Transmission\nin the intensive care unit may have been from the patient or from visiting\nfamily members, some of whom were symptomatic at the time they visited (2).\nThe Province of Ontario declared a health emergency on 26 Mar 2003, and on\n1 Apr 2003 a sixth death from SARS was reported from Toronto. As of 1 Apr\n2003, Ontario has reported 51 probable cases of SARS. The hospital has now\nbeen closed to new admissions.\nThe experience in Canada illustrates that highly developed countries can be\nvulnerable to transmission from imported cases of SARS, especially in\nhospitals (3,4). Most of the data have been consistent with transmission\nthrough large droplets or body fluids. Aerosol transmission cannot be\ntotally discounted, but if it occurs it is uncommon. If the causative\norganism had been readily transmissible by aerosol, many more cases would\nhave been expected, especially in the countries where transmission has\nslowed or never started. In Hong Kong there are some patterns of infection\nthat are most easily explained by environmental transmission such as\nfomites.\nIf the infection is not recognised early and appropriate infection control\nprecautions put in place, extensive transmission can occur. Those most at\nrisk seem to be family members and healthcare workers who have close\ncontact with symptomatic cases. It is worth noting that there have been no\nreported secondary cases from 2 hospitalised Canadian SARS cases where\nfamily members were not permitted to visit and healthcare workers adhered\nto strict infection control precautions.\nClinicians, accident and emergency, intensive treatment units, and\ninfectious disease staff in Europe should be alert to the possibility of\nSARS in people with fever and respiratory symptoms, IF they have recently\nreturned from areas where transmission of SARS is ongoing (currently Hong\nKong, and probably Guangdong) or who have had contact with a case of SARS\n<http://www.phls.co.uk/topics_az/SARS/management_guidance.htm>. When\npatients suspected of having SARS are admitted to hospital, it is vital\nthat infection control precautions are rapidly implemented and rigorously\nenforced <http://www.phls.co.uk/topics_az/SARS/hospital_guidance.htm>.\nUpdates on the developing situation are also available from WHO\n(<http://www.who.int/csr/sars/en/>) , on ProMED\n(<http://www.promedmail.org>), and at the websites of various national\npublic health organisations, including CDC\n(<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/sars/>), Health Canada\n(<http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/pphb-dgspsp/sars-sras/index.html>), and the Health\nProtection Agency in the United Kingdom\n(<http://www.phls.org.uk/topics_az/SARS/menu.htm>)(5-7).\nEurosurveillance Weekly welcomes comments on other useful information\nsources, please send\nto elizabeth.hoile@hpa.org.uk.\nReferences:\n1.

Between 19-23 Mar 2003, she met and\nworked with 2 Singaporean colleagues, who have since returned to Singapore\nand are well. She arrived back in Singapore on Southern China Airlines CZ\n355 at Terminal 1, Changi Airport on 26 Mar 2003 at 5.38 am. Accompanied by\nher mother, she took a taxi from the airport to the Accident & Emergency\nDepartment, Singapore General Hospital. From there, she was transferred by\nambulance and admitted to Tan Tock Seng Hospital.\nHer mother and 2 colleagues have been issued with Home Quarantine Orders.\nOthers who were served the Orders were 3 SATS officers, 2 SIR officers and\n2 relations officers from the airline. We have identified a taxi-driver who\nsaid that he had ferried 2 women from Changi Airport to the Accident &\nEmergency Department, Singapore General Hospital on the morning of 26 Mar\n2003. As a precautionary measure, a Home Quarantine Order has been issued\nto him.\nFollowing yesterday's press statement, we have been able to locate 10 more\npassengers. They are all well and quarantine orders are being served to\nthem. In total, 40 of the 48 passengers (excluding the case) have been\nidentified. There is a possibility that some of the remaining 8 passengers\nare no longer in Singapore. The names of the remaining 8 passengers who we\nhave still been unable to locate are [see\n<http://app.moh.gov.sg/new/new02.asp?id=1&mid=5740> for list of names.]\nThe latest (fifth) imported case is a 17-year-old Indonesian male student\nwho left Singapore on 15 Mar 2003 with his parents and his 15-year-old\nbrother for Guangdong and Hong Kong. The family returned to Singapore on\nthe night of 23 Mar 2003. On 24 Mar 2003, he was well and attended school\nat Bowen Secondary School. On 25 Mar 2003, he developed a fever and was\nseen at TTSH as an outpatient. He was given 5 days medical leave. He was\nseen again on 27 Mar 2003 and admitted to TTSH as a suspect SARS case. He\nstayed at home all this while. He was upgraded as a SARS case on 29 Mar\n2003. His mother is also admitted to TTSH as a suspect case. His father and\nbrother are well.\nAdditional precautionary measures at Changi Airport to minimize the import\nof SARS\nTo minimize the import of SARS cases, Singapore is stepping up health\nscreening procedures for passengers arriving at Changi Airport from\naffected countries. This is in view of new index cases that are traced to\npeople who have traveled overseas.\nAdditional Precautionary Measures For Incoming Passengers\nFrom 5 PM 31 Mar 2003 onwards, for all incoming flights from affected\nareas as identified by WHO, nurses will be present to check on passengers\nwho appear unwell. Those who have fever, will be sent to TTSH for assessment.\nAdditionally, CAAS has today issued a directive that takes immediate effect\nto all airlines operating at Changi Airport requiring them to ask\npassengers the 3 questions recommended by the World Health Organisation\n(WHO) before allowing them to board the flight to Singapore. The 3\nquestions are :\n1. Do you have high fever of more than 38 degrees Celsius?\n2. Do you have one or more respiratory symptoms including cough, shortness\nof breath, difficulty breathing?\n3. Have you had close contact with a person who has been diagnosed with\nSARS or had recent history of travel to areas reporting cases of SARS?\nAny visibly unwell passenger will be asked to obtain a doctor's\ncertification before they are allowed to board the flight to Singapore.\nThe above measures are on top of the health advisory cards distributed to\nall passengers coming from Hong Kong, Hanoi, and Guangdong. MOH and CAAS\nwill scale up the operations and implement the above measures to other\naffected countries as and when WHO updates the list.\nAdditional Precautionary Measures For Outgoing Passengers\nCAAS has issued a directive to airlines in Changi Airport requiring all\nairlines to ask departing passengers the 3 questions recommended by the\nWHO. This directive takes effect immediately. This is in addition to the\nhealth advisory cards which are distributed to passengers bound for Hong\nKong, Hanoi and Guangdong when checking in for their flights.\nSARS Situation Update\nAs at 30 Mar 2003, the total number of people who have recovered from SARS\nand are discharged from hospital is 35. The remaining 53 patients are\nhospitalised.\nA total of 91 people with SARS have been reported to the Ministry of\nHealth. Of the 2 additional patients, one is a healthcare worker who is\nstill traced back to the initial 3 index cases, and the other is the new\n(fifth) imported case.\nSo far, there have been no SARS cases that are linked to the fourth and\nfifth imported cases. This brings the total number of family members,\nfriends or close contacts infected by SARS to 44, and the total number of\nhospital staff infected by SARS to 42. These 86 cases are all linked to the\nfirst 3 index cases. The number of infected children still remains at 3.\nThere are currently 36 suspected cases, 2 out of which are children.\nThere are 12 patients who are in serious condition, including the fourth\nimported case. One patient who was in intensive care passed away on 29 Mar\n2003. This patient had concurrent history of hypertension, diabetes, heart\ndisease and a bacterial pneumonia.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n******\n[3]\nDate: 30 Mar 2003\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: Health Canada [edited]\n<http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/english/protection/warnings/2003/2003_11update15.htm>\n\nAs of 30 Mar 2003, Health Canada has received reports of approximately 98\nprobable or suspect cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in\nOntario, British Columbia, Alberta and New Brunswick. There have been 4\ndeaths in Canada. All Canadian cases have occurred in persons who have\ntraveled to Asia or had contact with SARS cases in the household or in a\nhealth-care setting. The information contained in this update is based on\nthe best available information Health Canada has at this time.\nHealth Canada is changing the way it is reporting probable and suspect\ncases of SARS to ensure consistency in reporting across the country.\n\"Probable\" cases of SARS are similar to suspect cases, but often they have\na more severe illness, with progressive shortness of breath and difficulty\nbreathing, and in some cases, chest x-rays show signs of atypical pneumonia.\nA \"suspect\" case of SARS is a person who fits into one of the following 2\ncategories: a person who develops fever and one or more respiratory\nsymptoms, including cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing,\nwithin 10 days of returning from travel to areas in Asia where SARS cases\nare being reported, or a person who develops fever and one or more\nrespiratory symptoms, including cough, shortness of breath or difficulty\nbreathing, within 10 days of having had close contact with a \"probable\"\ncase of SARS (i.e., within one metre).\nThe details of the cases to date are as follows:\nOntario is reporting approximately 81 probable and suspect cases. All cases\nhave occurred in persons who have traveled to Asia or had contact with SARS\ncases in the household or in a health-care setting.\nBritish Columbia is reporting 2 probable and 8 suspect cases.\nNew Brunswick is reporting one suspect case.\nSaskatchewan is reporting one suspect case.\nAlberta is reporting 5 suspect cases.\nManitoba is no longer reporting any suspect or probable cases.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[Today's reports reflect an increase in 60 cases in Hong Kong, and 2\nadditional cases in Singapore. The number of cases reported in Canada has\nincreased from 37 to 98, but the latter figure is a combination of\nsuspected and probable cases, whereas the 37 referred to only probable\ncases. Information on a global worldwide update was not available as of\nthe time of preparation of this update.\nWith the exception of the ongoing outbreak in Hong Kong (and possibly in\nmainland China), the outbreak of SARS in other areas seems to be following\na pattern consistent with a requirement of close contact with an actively\nill case of SARS for transmission to occur. One can't help but muse on the\ndefinition of close contact in different environments, and in those areas\nwith high population density, what might be a casual, non-close contact in\nother areas is close enough to allow for transmission in an area with\nhigher population density. This moderator is reminded of studies conducted\non the baseline incidence of poliomyelitis in India back in the early\n80s. It was generally accepted that polio was more of an \"urban disease\"\nwith higher incidences observed in urban areas. Results of studies on the\nbaseline incidence of polio in a highly populated state revealed that the\nrural incidence was on a par with the urban incidence. Our interpretation\nof this observation was that the standard western definition of urban vs.\nrural was based on population density, where rural areas had a markedly\nlower population density than urban areas. In the highly populated\ndistricts of India, rural areas had population densities similar to many\nwestern urban areas. Hence, rather than being an urban disease, polio was\nmore of a high population density disease. Again, food for thought here...\n- Mod.MPP]\nSee Also\nSARS - worldwide (19): etiology 20030330.0786\nSARS - worldwide (18): cases 20030329.0783\nSARS - worldwide (17): cases 20030328.0779\nSARS - Worldwide (16): Etiology 20030328.0774\nSARS - worldwide (15): cases 20030327.0771\nSARS - worldwide (14): overview 20030327.0769\nSARS - worldwide (13): etiology 20030327.0758\nSARS - worldwide (12): correction Shanxi not Shanghai 20030327.0756\nSARS - worldwide (11): cases 20030326.0753\nSARS - worldwide (10): infectious disease perspectives 20030326.0752\nSARS - worldwide (09): clinical features 20030326.0748\nSARS - worldwide (08): China 20030326.0747\nSARS - worldwide (07): cases 20030325.0746\nSARS - worldwide (06): WHO press briefing 20030325.0744\nSARS - worldwide (05): Hong Kong advisory 20030325.0741\nSARS - worldwide (04): etiology 20030325.0737\nSARS - Worldwide (03): cases 20030324.0735\nSARS - worldwide (02): cases 20030324.0734\nSARS - worldwide: cases 20030323.0722\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - worldwide (17) 20030322.0713\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - worldwide (16) 20030322.0711\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - worldwide (15) 20030322.0707\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - worldwide (14) 20030321.0704\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - worldwide (13) 20030321.0703\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - worldwide (12) 20030321.0702\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - worldwide (11) 20030320.0698\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - worldwide (10) 20030319.0689\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - worldwide (09) 20030319.0688\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - worldwide (08) 20030318.0679\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - worldwide (07) 20030318.0678\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - worldwide (06) 20030318.0677\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - Worldwide (05) 20030317.0669\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - Worldwide (04):comment 20030317.0664\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - Worldwide: alert (03) 20030316.0660\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - Worldwide (02):alert 20030315.0649\nSevere Acute Respiratory Syndrome - Worldwide 20030315.0637\nAcute respiratory syndrome - Canada (Ontario) 20030314.0631\nAcute respiratory syndrome - East Asia 20030314.0630\nAcute respiratory syndrome - China (HK), VietNam (03) 20030313.0624\nAcute respiratory syndrome - China (HK), VietNam (02) 20030313.0623\nAcute respiratory syndrome - China (HK), VietNam 20030312.0602\nUndiagnosed illness - Vietnam (Hanoi): RFI 20030311.0595\nInfluenza, H5N1 human case - China (Hong Kong) (05) 20030228.0500\nPneumonia - China (Guangdong) (07) 20030221.0452\nPneumonia - China (Guangdong) (06) 20030220.0447\nPneumonia - China (Guangdong) (05) 20030220.0446\nPneumonia - China (Guangdong) (04) 20030219.0427\nPneumonia - China (Guangdong) (03) 20030214.0390\nPneumonia - China (Guangdong) (02) 20030211.0369\nPneumonia - China (Guangdong): RFI 20030210.0357\n........................mpp/pg/dk\n\n\n*##########################################################*\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.

There have been 4\ndeaths in Canada. All Canadian cases have occurred in persons who have\ntraveled to Asia or had contact with SARS cases in the household or in a\nhealth-care setting. The information contained in this update is based on\nthe best available information Health Canada has at this time.\nHealth Canada is changing the way it is reporting probable and suspect\ncases of SARS to ensure consistency in reporting across the country.\n\"Probable\" cases of SARS are similar to suspect cases, but often they have\na more severe illness, with progressive shortness of breath and difficulty\nbreathing, and in some cases, chest x-rays show signs of atypical pneumonia.\nA \"suspect\" case of SARS is a person who fits into one of the following 2\ncategories: a person who develops fever and one or more respiratory\nsymptoms, including cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing,\nwithin 10 days of returning from travel to areas in Asia where SARS cases\nare being reported, or a person who develops fever and one or more\nrespiratory symptoms, including cough, shortness of breath or difficulty\nbreathing, within 10 days of having had close contact with a \"probable\"\ncase of SARS (i.e., within one metre).\nThe details of the cases to date are as follows:\nOntario is reporting approximately 81 probable and suspect cases. All cases\nhave occurred in persons who have traveled to Asia or had contact with SARS\ncases in the household or in a health-care setting.\nBritish Columbia is reporting 2 probable and 8 suspect cases.\nNew Brunswick is reporting one suspect case.\nSaskatchewan is reporting one suspect case.\nAlberta is reporting 5 suspect cases.\nManitoba is no longer reporting any suspect or probable cases.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[Today's reports reflect an increase in 60 cases in Hong Kong, and 2\nadditional cases in Singapore. The number of cases reported in Canada has\nincreased from 37 to 98, but the latter figure is a combination of\nsuspected and probable cases, whereas the 37 referred to only probable\ncases. Information on a global worldwide update was not available as of\nthe time of preparation of this update.\nWith the exception of the ongoing outbreak in Hong Kong (and possibly in\nmainland China), the outbreak of SARS in other areas seems to be following\na pattern consistent with a requirement of close contact with an actively\nill case of SARS for transmission to occur. One can't help but muse on the\ndefinition of close contact in different environments, and in those areas\nwith high population density, what might be a casual, non-close contact in\nother areas is close enough to allow for transmission in an area with\nhigher population density. This moderator is reminded of studies conducted\non the baseline incidence of poliomyelitis in India back in the early\n80s. It was generally accepted that polio was more of an \"urban disease\"\nwith higher incidences observed in urban areas. Results of studies on the\nbaseline incidence of polio in a highly populated state revealed that the\nrural incidence was on a par with the urban incidence. Our interpretation\nof this observation was that the standard western definition of urban vs.\nrural was based on population density, where rural areas had a markedly\nlower population density than urban areas. In the highly populated\ndistricts of India, rural areas had population densities similar to many\nwestern urban areas. Hence, rather than being an urban disease, polio was\nmore of a high population density disease. Again, food for thought here...\n- Mod.MPP]\nSee Also\nSARS - worldwide (19): etiology 20030330.0786\nSARS - worldwide (18): cases 20030329.0783\nSARS - worldwide (17): cases 20030328.0779\nSARS - Worldwide (16): Etiology 20030328.0774\nSARS - worldwide (15): cases 20030327.0771\nSARS - worldwide (14): overview 20030327.0769\nSARS - worldwide (13): etiology 20030327.0758\nSARS - worldwide (12): correction Shanxi not Shanghai 20030327.0756\nSARS - worldwide (11): cases 20030326.0753\nSARS - worldwide (10): infectious disease perspectives 20030326.0752\nSARS - worldwide (09): clinical features 20030326.0748\nSARS - worldwide (08): China 20030326.0747\nSARS - worldwide (07): cases 20030325.0746\nSARS - worldwide (06): WHO press briefing 20030325.0744\nSARS - worldwide (05): Hong Kong advisory 20030325.0741\nSARS - worldwide (04): etiology 20030325.0737\nSARS - Worldwide (03): cases 20030324.0735\nSARS - worldwide (02): cases 20030324.0734\nSARS - worldwide: cases 20030323.0722\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - worldwide (17) 20030322.0713\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - worldwide (16) 20030322.0711\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - worldwide (15) 20030322.0707\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - worldwide (14) 20030321.0704\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - worldwide (13) 20030321.0703\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - worldwide (12) 20030321.0702\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - worldwide (11) 20030320.0698\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - worldwide (10) 20030319.0689\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - worldwide (09) 20030319.0688\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - worldwide (08) 20030318.0679\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - worldwide (07) 20030318.0678\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - worldwide (06) 20030318.0677\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - Worldwide (05) 20030317.0669\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - Worldwide (04):comment 20030317.0664\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - Worldwide: alert (03) 20030316.0660\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - Worldwide (02):alert 20030315.0649\nSevere Acute Respiratory Syndrome - Worldwide 20030315.0637\nAcute respiratory syndrome - Canada (Ontario) 20030314.0631\nAcute respiratory syndrome - East Asia 20030314.0630\nAcute respiratory syndrome - China (HK), VietNam (03) 20030313.0624\nAcute respiratory syndrome - China (HK), VietNam (02) 20030313.0623\nAcute respiratory syndrome - China (HK), VietNam 20030312.0602\nUndiagnosed illness - Vietnam (Hanoi): RFI 20030311.0595\nInfluenza, H5N1 human case - China (Hong Kong) (05) 20030228.0500\nPneumonia - China (Guangdong) (07) 20030221.0452\nPneumonia - China (Guangdong) (06) 20030220.0447\nPneumonia - China (Guangdong) (05) 20030220.0446\nPneumonia - China (Guangdong) (04) 20030219.0427\nPneumonia - China (Guangdong) (03) 20030214.0390\nPneumonia - China (Guangdong) (02) 20030211.0369\nPneumonia - China (Guangdong): RFI 20030210.0357\n........................mpp/pg/dk\n\n\n*##########################################################*\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.

They include 6 healthcare\nworkers and 36 patients from Amoy Gardens. The remaining 18 were new\npatients and contacts of patients with atypical pneumonia.\n17 patients, including 12 healthcare workers and medical students of Prince\nof Wales Hospital, were discharged from hospital today. A total of 60\npatients to date have recovered from atypical pneumonia and been discharged.\nCurrently, 52 patients are receiving treatment in the intensive care unit.\nA 74-year-old female patient with a history of other diseases died in\nUnited Christian Hospital this morning. This brings to 13 the total number\nof patients died with atypical pneumonia in public hospitals.\nThe cumulative figure for patients admitted to public hospitals with\natypical pneumonia is 530, starting from 12 Mar 2003.\nThe breakdown of figures is as follows: (The numbers in bracket are those\nwith pneumonia symptoms)\nHealth care workers of Hospitals/Clinics and medical students 162 (162)\n36 of the patients were discharged\nPatients, family members & visitors 368 (368)\n24 of the patients were discharged\nTotal admission 530 (530)\n60 were discharged\n[B] Flight passengers urged to contact DH 30 Mar 2003\nThe Department of Health (DH) on 30 Mar 2003 called on passengers who had\ntravelled from Beijing to Hong Kong on flight KA 901(Dragonair) on 26 Mar\n2003 to call DH's hotline 2961 8968 for health advice on atypical pneumonia\nand surveillance. The hotline will be manned from noon to 5 PM 30 Mar 2003\nand from 9 AM to 5 PM on weekdays.\nThe plea was made as DH's investigation found that a Hong Kong man who had\ntaken the flight developed symptoms of severe acute respiratory syndrome\nduring his stay in Beijing. He was later confirmed to have contracted the\ndisease. DH has informed the Airport Authority and the airline. Advice was\nalso given to the airline concerned to disinfect the airplanes. DH is\ntracing the crew members and passengers who had taken these 2 flights, for\nsurveillance purposes.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n******\n[2]\nDate: 30 Mar 2003\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: Singapore Ministry of Health 30 Mar 2003 [edited]\n<http://app.moh.gov.sg/new/new02.asp?id=1&mid=5740>\n\nSARS: New measures at airport to curb importation of new cases; more\npatients recovering and discharged - 30 Mar 2003\nIn yesterday's Press Release, MOH had informed that the fourth imported\ncase left for Hong Kong on 14 Mar 2003 and then to Beijing on 15 Mar 2003.\nOn 19 Mar 2003, she became unwell. Between 19-23 Mar 2003, she met and\nworked with 2 Singaporean colleagues, who have since returned to Singapore\nand are well. She arrived back in Singapore on Southern China Airlines CZ\n355 at Terminal 1, Changi Airport on 26 Mar 2003 at 5.38 am. Accompanied by\nher mother, she took a taxi from the airport to the Accident & Emergency\nDepartment, Singapore General Hospital. From there, she was transferred by\nambulance and admitted to Tan Tock Seng Hospital.\nHer mother and 2 colleagues have been issued with Home Quarantine Orders.\nOthers who were served the Orders were 3 SATS officers, 2 SIR officers and\n2 relations officers from the airline. We have identified a taxi-driver who\nsaid that he had ferried 2 women from Changi Airport to the Accident &\nEmergency Department, Singapore General Hospital on the morning of 26 Mar\n2003. As a precautionary measure, a Home Quarantine Order has been issued\nto him.\nFollowing yesterday's press statement, we have been able to locate 10 more\npassengers. They are all well and quarantine orders are being served to\nthem. In total, 40 of the 48 passengers (excluding the case) have been\nidentified. There is a possibility that some of the remaining 8 passengers\nare no longer in Singapore. The names of the remaining 8 passengers who we\nhave still been unable to locate are [see\n<http://app.moh.gov.sg/new/new02.asp?id=1&mid=5740> for list of names.]\nThe latest (fifth) imported case is a 17-year-old Indonesian male student\nwho left Singapore on 15 Mar 2003 with his parents and his 15-year-old\nbrother for Guangdong and Hong Kong. The family returned to Singapore on\nthe night of 23 Mar 2003. On 24 Mar 2003, he was well and attended school\nat Bowen Secondary School. On 25 Mar 2003, he developed a fever and was\nseen at TTSH as an outpatient. He was given 5 days medical leave. He was\nseen again on 27 Mar 2003 and admitted to TTSH as a suspect SARS case. He\nstayed at home all this while. He was upgraded as a SARS case on 29 Mar\n2003. His mother is also admitted to TTSH as a suspect case. His father and\nbrother are well.\nAdditional precautionary measures at Changi Airport to minimize the import\nof SARS\nTo minimize the import of SARS cases, Singapore is stepping up health\nscreening procedures for passengers arriving at Changi Airport from\naffected countries. This is in view of new index cases that are traced to\npeople who have traveled overseas.\nAdditional Precautionary Measures For Incoming Passengers\nFrom 5 PM 31 Mar 2003 onwards, for all incoming flights from affected\nareas as identified by WHO, nurses will be present to check on passengers\nwho appear unwell. Those who have fever, will be sent to TTSH for assessment.\nAdditionally, CAAS has today issued a directive that takes immediate effect\nto all airlines operating at Changi Airport requiring them to ask\npassengers the 3 questions recommended by the World Health Organisation\n(WHO) before allowing them to board the flight to Singapore. The 3\nquestions are :\n1. Do you have high fever of more than 38 degrees Celsius?\n2. Do you have one or more respiratory symptoms including cough, shortness\nof breath, difficulty breathing?\n3. Have you had close contact with a person who has been diagnosed with\nSARS or had recent history of travel to areas reporting cases of SARS?\nAny visibly unwell passenger will be asked to obtain a doctor's\ncertification before they are allowed to board the flight to Singapore.\nThe above measures are on top of the health advisory cards distributed to\nall passengers coming from Hong Kong, Hanoi, and Guangdong. MOH and CAAS\nwill scale up the operations and implement the above measures to other\naffected countries as and when WHO updates the list.\nAdditional Precautionary Measures For Outgoing Passengers\nCAAS has issued a directive to airlines in Changi Airport requiring all\nairlines to ask departing passengers the 3 questions recommended by the\nWHO. This directive takes effect immediately. This is in addition to the\nhealth advisory cards which are distributed to passengers bound for Hong\nKong, Hanoi and Guangdong when checking in for their flights.\nSARS Situation Update\nAs at 30 Mar 2003, the total number of people who have recovered from SARS\nand are discharged from hospital is 35. The remaining 53 patients are\nhospitalised.\nA total of 91 people with SARS have been reported to the Ministry of\nHealth. Of the 2 additional patients, one is a healthcare worker who is\nstill traced back to the initial 3 index cases, and the other is the new\n(fifth) imported case.\nSo far, there have been no SARS cases that are linked to the fourth and\nfifth imported cases. This brings the total number of family members,\nfriends or close contacts infected by SARS to 44, and the total number of\nhospital staff infected by SARS to 42. These 86 cases are all linked to the\nfirst 3 index cases. The number of infected children still remains at 3.\nThere are currently 36 suspected cases, 2 out of which are children.\nThere are 12 patients who are in serious condition, including the fourth\nimported case. One patient who was in intensive care passed away on 29 Mar\n2003. This patient had concurrent history of hypertension, diabetes, heart\ndisease and a bacterial pneumonia.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n******\n[3]\nDate: 30 Mar 2003\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: Health Canada [edited]\n<http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/english/protection/warnings/2003/2003_11update15.htm>\n\nAs of 30 Mar 2003, Health Canada has received reports of approximately 98\nprobable or suspect cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in\nOntario, British Columbia, Alberta and New Brunswick.

They include 6 healthcare\nworkers and 36 patients from Amoy Gardens. The remaining 18 were new\npatients and contacts of patients with atypical pneumonia.\n17 patients, including 12 healthcare workers and medical students of Prince\nof Wales Hospital, were discharged from hospital today. A total of 60\npatients to date have recovered from atypical pneumonia and been discharged.\nCurrently, 52 patients are receiving treatment in the intensive care unit.\nA 74-year-old female patient with a history of other diseases died in\nUnited Christian Hospital this morning. This brings to 13 the total number\nof patients died with atypical pneumonia in public hospitals.\nThe cumulative figure for patients admitted to public hospitals with\natypical pneumonia is 530, starting from 12 Mar 2003.\nThe breakdown of figures is as follows: (The numbers in bracket are those\nwith pneumonia symptoms)\nHealth care workers of Hospitals/Clinics and medical students 162 (162)\n36 of the patients were discharged\nPatients, family members & visitors 368 (368)\n24 of the patients were discharged\nTotal admission 530 (530)\n60 were discharged\n[B] Flight passengers urged to contact DH 30 Mar 2003\nThe Department of Health (DH) on 30 Mar 2003 called on passengers who had\ntravelled from Beijing to Hong Kong on flight KA 901(Dragonair) on 26 Mar\n2003 to call DH's hotline 2961 8968 for health advice on atypical pneumonia\nand surveillance. The hotline will be manned from noon to 5 PM 30 Mar 2003\nand from 9 AM to 5 PM on weekdays.\nThe plea was made as DH's investigation found that a Hong Kong man who had\ntaken the flight developed symptoms of severe acute respiratory syndrome\nduring his stay in Beijing. He was later confirmed to have contracted the\ndisease. DH has informed the Airport Authority and the airline. Advice was\nalso given to the airline concerned to disinfect the airplanes.

Between 19-23 Mar 2003, she met and\nworked with 2 Singaporean colleagues, who have since returned to Singapore\nand are well. She arrived back in Singapore on Southern China Airlines CZ\n355 at Terminal 1, Changi Airport on 26 Mar 2003 at 5.38 am. Accompanied by\nher mother, she took a taxi from the airport to the Accident & Emergency\nDepartment, Singapore General Hospital. From there, she was transferred by\nambulance and admitted to Tan Tock Seng Hospital.\nHer mother and 2 colleagues have been issued with Home Quarantine Orders.\nOthers who were served the Orders were 3 SATS officers, 2 SIR officers and\n2 relations officers from the airline. We have identified a taxi-driver who\nsaid that he had ferried 2 women from Changi Airport to the Accident &\nEmergency Department, Singapore General Hospital on the morning of 26 Mar\n2003. As a precautionary measure, a Home Quarantine Order has been issued\nto him.\nFollowing yesterday's press statement, we have been able to locate 10 more\npassengers. They are all well and quarantine orders are being served to\nthem. In total, 40 of the 48 passengers (excluding the case) have been\nidentified. There is a possibility that some of the remaining 8 passengers\nare no longer in Singapore. The names of the remaining 8 passengers who we\nhave still been unable to locate are [see\n<http://app.moh.gov.sg/new/new02.asp?id=1&mid=5740> for list of names.]\nThe latest (fifth) imported case is a 17-year-old Indonesian male student\nwho left Singapore on 15 Mar 2003 with his parents and his 15-year-old\nbrother for Guangdong and Hong Kong. The family returned to Singapore on\nthe night of 23 Mar 2003. On 24 Mar 2003, he was well and attended school\nat Bowen Secondary School. On 25 Mar 2003, he developed a fever and was\nseen at TTSH as an outpatient. He was given 5 days medical leave. He was\nseen again on 27 Mar 2003 and admitted to TTSH as a suspect SARS case. He\nstayed at home all this while. He was upgraded as a SARS case on 29 Mar\n2003. His mother is also admitted to TTSH as a suspect case. His father and\nbrother are well.\nAdditional precautionary measures at Changi Airport to minimize the import\nof SARS\nTo minimize the import of SARS cases, Singapore is stepping up health\nscreening procedures for passengers arriving at Changi Airport from\naffected countries. This is in view of new index cases that are traced to\npeople who have traveled overseas.\nAdditional Precautionary Measures For Incoming Passengers\nFrom 5 PM 31 Mar 2003 onwards, for all incoming flights from affected\nareas as identified by WHO, nurses will be present to check on passengers\nwho appear unwell. Those who have fever, will be sent to TTSH for assessment.\nAdditionally, CAAS has today issued a directive that takes immediate effect\nto all airlines operating at Changi Airport requiring them to ask\npassengers the 3 questions recommended by the World Health Organisation\n(WHO) before allowing them to board the flight to Singapore. The 3\nquestions are :\n1. Do you have high fever of more than 38 degrees Celsius?\n2. Do you have one or more respiratory symptoms including cough, shortness\nof breath, difficulty breathing?\n3. Have you had close contact with a person who has been diagnosed with\nSARS or had recent history of travel to areas reporting cases of SARS?\nAny visibly unwell passenger will be asked to obtain a doctor's\ncertification before they are allowed to board the flight to Singapore.\nThe above measures are on top of the health advisory cards distributed to\nall passengers coming from Hong Kong, Hanoi, and Guangdong. MOH and CAAS\nwill scale up the operations and implement the above measures to other\naffected countries as and when WHO updates the list.\nAdditional Precautionary Measures For Outgoing Passengers\nCAAS has issued a directive to airlines in Changi Airport requiring all\nairlines to ask departing passengers the 3 questions recommended by the\nWHO. This directive takes effect immediately. This is in addition to the\nhealth advisory cards which are distributed to passengers bound for Hong\nKong, Hanoi and Guangdong when checking in for their flights.\nSARS Situation Update\nAs at 30 Mar 2003, the total number of people who have recovered from SARS\nand are discharged from hospital is 35. The remaining 53 patients are\nhospitalised.\nA total of 91 people with SARS have been reported to the Ministry of\nHealth. Of the 2 additional patients, one is a healthcare worker who is\nstill traced back to the initial 3 index cases, and the other is the new\n(fifth) imported case.\nSo far, there have been no SARS cases that are linked to the fourth and\nfifth imported cases. This brings the total number of family members,\nfriends or close contacts infected by SARS to 44, and the total number of\nhospital staff infected by SARS to 42. These 86 cases are all linked to the\nfirst 3 index cases. The number of infected children still remains at 3.\nThere are currently 36 suspected cases, 2 out of which are children.\nThere are 12 patients who are in serious condition, including the fourth\nimported case. One patient who was in intensive care passed away on 29 Mar\n2003. This patient had concurrent history of hypertension, diabetes, heart\ndisease and a bacterial pneumonia.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n******\n[3]\nDate: 30 Mar 2003\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: Health Canada [edited]\n<http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/english/protection/warnings/2003/2003_11update15.htm>\n\nAs of 30 Mar 2003, Health Canada has received reports of approximately 98\nprobable or suspect cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in\nOntario, British Columbia, Alberta and New Brunswick. There have been 4\ndeaths in Canada. All Canadian cases have occurred in persons who have\ntraveled to Asia or had contact with SARS cases in the household or in a\nhealth-care setting. The information contained in this update is based on\nthe best available information Health Canada has at this time.\nHealth Canada is changing the way it is reporting probable and suspect\ncases of SARS to ensure consistency in reporting across the country.\n\"Probable\" cases of SARS are similar to suspect cases, but often they have\na more severe illness, with progressive shortness of breath and difficulty\nbreathing, and in some cases, chest x-rays show signs of atypical pneumonia.\nA \"suspect\" case of SARS is a person who fits into one of the following 2\ncategories: a person who develops fever and one or more respiratory\nsymptoms, including cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing,\nwithin 10 days of returning from travel to areas in Asia where SARS cases\nare being reported, or a person who develops fever and one or more\nrespiratory symptoms, including cough, shortness of breath or difficulty\nbreathing, within 10 days of having had close contact with a \"probable\"\ncase of SARS (i.e., within one metre).\nThe details of the cases to date are as follows:\nOntario is reporting approximately 81 probable and suspect cases. All cases\nhave occurred in persons who have traveled to Asia or had contact with SARS\ncases in the household or in a health-care setting.\nBritish Columbia is reporting 2 probable and 8 suspect cases.\nNew Brunswick is reporting one suspect case.\nSaskatchewan is reporting one suspect case.\nAlberta is reporting 5 suspect cases.\nManitoba is no longer reporting any suspect or probable cases.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[Today's reports reflect an increase in 60 cases in Hong Kong, and 2\nadditional cases in Singapore. The number of cases reported in Canada has\nincreased from 37 to 98, but the latter figure is a combination of\nsuspected and probable cases, whereas the 37 referred to only probable\ncases. Information on a global worldwide update was not available as of\nthe time of preparation of this update.\nWith the exception of the ongoing outbreak in Hong Kong (and possibly in\nmainland China), the outbreak of SARS in other areas seems to be following\na pattern consistent with a requirement of close contact with an actively\nill case of SARS for transmission to occur. One can't help but muse on the\ndefinition of close contact in different environments, and in those areas\nwith high population density, what might be a casual, non-close contact in\nother areas is close enough to allow for transmission in an area with\nhigher population density. This moderator is reminded of studies conducted\non the baseline incidence of poliomyelitis in India back in the early\n80s. It was generally accepted that polio was more of an \"urban disease\"\nwith higher incidences observed in urban areas. Results of studies on the\nbaseline incidence of polio in a highly populated state revealed that the\nrural incidence was on a par with the urban incidence. Our interpretation\nof this observation was that the standard western definition of urban vs.\nrural was based on population density, where rural areas had a markedly\nlower population density than urban areas. In the highly populated\ndistricts of India, rural areas had population densities similar to many\nwestern urban areas. Hence, rather than being an urban disease, polio was\nmore of a high population density disease.

They include 6 healthcare\nworkers and 36 patients from Amoy Gardens. The remaining 18 were new\npatients and contacts of patients with atypical pneumonia.\n17 patients, including 12 healthcare workers and medical students of Prince\nof Wales Hospital, were discharged from hospital today.

Between 19-23 Mar 2003, she met and\nworked with 2 Singaporean colleagues, who have since returned to Singapore\nand are well. She arrived back in Singapore on Southern China Airlines CZ\n355 at Terminal 1, Changi Airport on 26 Mar 2003 at 5.38 am. Accompanied by\nher mother, she took a taxi from the airport to the Accident & Emergency\nDepartment, Singapore General Hospital. From there, she was transferred by\nambulance and admitted to Tan Tock Seng Hospital.\nHer mother and 2 colleagues have been issued with Home Quarantine Orders.\nOthers who were served the Orders were 3 SATS officers, 2 SIR officers and\n2 relations officers from the airline. We have identified a taxi-driver who\nsaid that he had ferried 2 women from Changi Airport to the Accident &\nEmergency Department, Singapore General Hospital on the morning of 26 Mar\n2003. As a precautionary measure, a Home Quarantine Order has been issued\nto him.\nFollowing yesterday's press statement, we have been able to locate 10 more\npassengers. They are all well and quarantine orders are being served to\nthem. In total, 40 of the 48 passengers (excluding the case) have been\nidentified. There is a possibility that some of the remaining 8 passengers\nare no longer in Singapore. The names of the remaining 8 passengers who we\nhave still been unable to locate are [see\n<http://app.moh.gov.sg/new/new02.asp?id=1&mid=5740> for list of names.]\nThe latest (fifth) imported case is a 17-year-old Indonesian male student\nwho left Singapore on 15 Mar 2003 with his parents and his 15-year-old\nbrother for Guangdong and Hong Kong. The family returned to Singapore on\nthe night of 23 Mar 2003. On 24 Mar 2003, he was well and attended school\nat Bowen Secondary School. On 25 Mar 2003, he developed a fever and was\nseen at TTSH as an outpatient. He was given 5 days medical leave. He was\nseen again on 27 Mar 2003 and admitted to TTSH as a suspect SARS case. He\nstayed at home all this while. He was upgraded as a SARS case on 29 Mar\n2003. His mother is also admitted to TTSH as a suspect case. His father and\nbrother are well.\nAdditional precautionary measures at Changi Airport to minimize the import\nof SARS\nTo minimize the import of SARS cases, Singapore is stepping up health\nscreening procedures for passengers arriving at Changi Airport from\naffected countries. This is in view of new index cases that are traced to\npeople who have traveled overseas.\nAdditional Precautionary Measures For Incoming Passengers\nFrom 5 PM 31 Mar 2003 onwards, for all incoming flights from affected\nareas as identified by WHO, nurses will be present to check on passengers\nwho appear unwell. Those who have fever, will be sent to TTSH for assessment.\nAdditionally, CAAS has today issued a directive that takes immediate effect\nto all airlines operating at Changi Airport requiring them to ask\npassengers the 3 questions recommended by the World Health Organisation\n(WHO) before allowing them to board the flight to Singapore. The 3\nquestions are :\n1. Do you have high fever of more than 38 degrees Celsius?\n2. Do you have one or more respiratory symptoms including cough, shortness\nof breath, difficulty breathing?\n3. Have you had close contact with a person who has been diagnosed with\nSARS or had recent history of travel to areas reporting cases of SARS?\nAny visibly unwell passenger will be asked to obtain a doctor's\ncertification before they are allowed to board the flight to Singapore.\nThe above measures are on top of the health advisory cards distributed to\nall passengers coming from Hong Kong, Hanoi, and Guangdong. MOH and CAAS\nwill scale up the operations and implement the above measures to other\naffected countries as and when WHO updates the list.\nAdditional Precautionary Measures For Outgoing Passengers\nCAAS has issued a directive to airlines in Changi Airport requiring all\nairlines to ask departing passengers the 3 questions recommended by the\nWHO. This directive takes effect immediately. This is in addition to the\nhealth advisory cards which are distributed to passengers bound for Hong\nKong, Hanoi and Guangdong when checking in for their flights.\nSARS Situation Update\nAs at 30 Mar 2003, the total number of people who have recovered from SARS\nand are discharged from hospital is 35. The remaining 53 patients are\nhospitalised.\nA total of 91 people with SARS have been reported to the Ministry of\nHealth. Of the 2 additional patients, one is a healthcare worker who is\nstill traced back to the initial 3 index cases, and the other is the new\n(fifth) imported case.\nSo far, there have been no SARS cases that are linked to the fourth and\nfifth imported cases. This brings the total number of family members,\nfriends or close contacts infected by SARS to 44, and the total number of\nhospital staff infected by SARS to 42. These 86 cases are all linked to the\nfirst 3 index cases. The number of infected children still remains at 3.\nThere are currently 36 suspected cases, 2 out of which are children.\nThere are 12 patients who are in serious condition, including the fourth\nimported case. One patient who was in intensive care passed away on 29 Mar\n2003. This patient had concurrent history of hypertension, diabetes, heart\ndisease and a bacterial pneumonia.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n******\n[3]\nDate: 30 Mar 2003\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: Health Canada [edited]\n<http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/english/protection/warnings/2003/2003_11update15.htm>\n\nAs of 30 Mar 2003, Health Canada has received reports of approximately 98\nprobable or suspect cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in\nOntario, British Columbia, Alberta and New Brunswick. There have been 4\ndeaths in Canada. All Canadian cases have occurred in persons who have\ntraveled to Asia or had contact with SARS cases in the household or in a\nhealth-care setting. The information contained in this update is based on\nthe best available information Health Canada has at this time.\nHealth Canada is changing the way it is reporting probable and suspect\ncases of SARS to ensure consistency in reporting across the country.\n\"Probable\" cases of SARS are similar to suspect cases, but often they have\na more severe illness, with progressive shortness of breath and difficulty\nbreathing, and in some cases, chest x-rays show signs of atypical pneumonia.\nA \"suspect\" case of SARS is a person who fits into one of the following 2\ncategories: a person who develops fever and one or more respiratory\nsymptoms, including cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing,\nwithin 10 days of returning from travel to areas in Asia where SARS cases\nare being reported, or a person who develops fever and one or more\nrespiratory symptoms, including cough, shortness of breath or difficulty\nbreathing, within 10 days of having had close contact with a \"probable\"\ncase of SARS (i.e., within one metre).\nThe details of the cases to date are as follows:\nOntario is reporting approximately 81 probable and suspect cases. All cases\nhave occurred in persons who have traveled to Asia or had contact with SARS\ncases in the household or in a health-care setting.\nBritish Columbia is reporting 2 probable and 8 suspect cases.\nNew Brunswick is reporting one suspect case.\nSaskatchewan is reporting one suspect case.\nAlberta is reporting 5 suspect cases.\nManitoba is no longer reporting any suspect or probable cases.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[Today's reports reflect an increase in 60 cases in Hong Kong, and 2\nadditional cases in Singapore. The number of cases reported in Canada has\nincreased from 37 to 98, but the latter figure is a combination of\nsuspected and probable cases, whereas the 37 referred to only probable\ncases. Information on a global worldwide update was not available as of\nthe time of preparation of this update.\nWith the exception of the ongoing outbreak in Hong Kong (and possibly in\nmainland China), the outbreak of SARS in other areas seems to be following\na pattern consistent with a requirement of close contact with an actively\nill case of SARS for transmission to occur. One can't help but muse on the\ndefinition of close contact in different environments, and in those areas\nwith high population density, what might be a casual, non-close contact in\nother areas is close enough to allow for transmission in an area with\nhigher population density. This moderator is reminded of studies conducted\non the baseline incidence of poliomyelitis in India back in the early\n80s. It was generally accepted that polio was more of an \"urban disease\"\nwith higher incidences observed in urban areas. Results of studies on the\nbaseline incidence of polio in a highly populated state revealed that the\nrural incidence was on a par with the urban incidence. Our interpretation\nof this observation was that the standard western definition of urban vs.\nrural was based on population density, where rural areas had a markedly\nlower population density than urban areas. In the highly populated\ndistricts of India, rural areas had population densities similar to many\nwestern urban areas. Hence, rather than being an urban disease, polio was\nmore of a high population density disease. Again, food for thought here...\n- Mod.MPP]\nSee Also\nSARS - worldwide (19): etiology 20030330.0786\nSARS - worldwide (18): cases 20030329.0783\nSARS - worldwide (17): cases 20030328.0779\nSARS - Worldwide (16): Etiology 20030328.0774\nSARS - worldwide (15): cases 20030327.0771\nSARS - worldwide (14): overview 20030327.0769\nSARS - worldwide (13): etiology 20030327.0758\nSARS - worldwide (12): correction Shanxi not Shanghai 20030327.0756\nSARS - worldwide (11): cases 20030326.0753\nSARS - worldwide (10): infectious disease perspectives 20030326.0752\nSARS - worldwide (09): clinical features 20030326.0748\nSARS - worldwide (08): China 20030326.0747\nSARS - worldwide (07): cases 20030325.0746\nSARS - worldwide (06): WHO press briefing 20030325.0744\nSARS - worldwide (05): Hong Kong advisory 20030325.0741\nSARS - worldwide (04): etiology 20030325.0737\nSARS - Worldwide (03): cases 20030324.0735\nSARS - worldwide (02): cases 20030324.0734\nSARS - worldwide: cases 20030323.0722\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - worldwide (17) 20030322.0713\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - worldwide (16) 20030322.0711\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - worldwide (15) 20030322.0707\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - worldwide (14) 20030321.0704\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - worldwide (13) 20030321.0703\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - worldwide (12) 20030321.0702\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - worldwide (11) 20030320.0698\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - worldwide (10) 20030319.0689\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - worldwide (09) 20030319.0688\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - worldwide (08) 20030318.0679\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - worldwide (07) 20030318.0678\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - worldwide (06) 20030318.0677\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - Worldwide (05) 20030317.0669\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - Worldwide (04):comment 20030317.0664\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - Worldwide: alert (03) 20030316.0660\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - Worldwide (02):alert 20030315.0649\nSevere Acute Respiratory Syndrome - Worldwide 20030315.0637\nAcute respiratory syndrome - Canada (Ontario) 20030314.0631\nAcute respiratory syndrome - East Asia 20030314.0630\nAcute respiratory syndrome - China (HK), VietNam (03) 20030313.0624\nAcute respiratory syndrome - China (HK), VietNam (02) 20030313.0623\nAcute respiratory syndrome - China (HK), VietNam 20030312.0602\nUndiagnosed illness - Vietnam (Hanoi): RFI 20030311.0595\nInfluenza, H5N1 human case - China (Hong Kong) (05) 20030228.0500\nPneumonia - China (Guangdong) (07) 20030221.0452\nPneumonia - China (Guangdong) (06) 20030220.0447\nPneumonia - China (Guangdong) (05) 20030220.0446\nPneumonia - China (Guangdong) (04) 20030219.0427\nPneumonia - China (Guangdong) (03) 20030214.0390\nPneumonia - China (Guangdong) (02) 20030211.0369\nPneumonia - China (Guangdong): RFI 20030210.0357\n........................mpp/pg/dk\n\n\n*##########################################################*\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.

There have been 4\ndeaths in Canada. All Canadian cases have occurred in persons who have\ntraveled to Asia or had contact with SARS cases in the household or in a\nhealth-care setting. The information contained in this update is based on\nthe best available information Health Canada has at this time.\nHealth Canada is changing the way it is reporting probable and suspect\ncases of SARS to ensure consistency in reporting across the country.\n\"Probable\" cases of SARS are similar to suspect cases, but often they have\na more severe illness, with progressive shortness of breath and difficulty\nbreathing, and in some cases, chest x-rays show signs of atypical pneumonia.\nA \"suspect\" case of SARS is a person who fits into one of the following 2\ncategories: a person who develops fever and one or more respiratory\nsymptoms, including cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing,\nwithin 10 days of returning from travel to areas in Asia where SARS cases\nare being reported, or a person who develops fever and one or more\nrespiratory symptoms, including cough, shortness of breath or difficulty\nbreathing, within 10 days of having had close contact with a \"probable\"\ncase of SARS (i.e., within one metre).\nThe details of the cases to date are as follows:\nOntario is reporting approximately 81 probable and suspect cases. All cases\nhave occurred in persons who have traveled to Asia or had contact with SARS\ncases in the household or in a health-care setting.\nBritish Columbia is reporting 2 probable and 8 suspect cases.\nNew Brunswick is reporting one suspect case.\nSaskatchewan is reporting one suspect case.\nAlberta is reporting 5 suspect cases.\nManitoba is no longer reporting any suspect or probable cases.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[Today's reports reflect an increase in 60 cases in Hong Kong, and 2\nadditional cases in Singapore. The number of cases reported in Canada has\nincreased from 37 to 98, but the latter figure is a combination of\nsuspected and probable cases, whereas the 37 referred to only probable\ncases. Information on a global worldwide update was not available as of\nthe time of preparation of this update.\nWith the exception of the ongoing outbreak in Hong Kong (and possibly in\nmainland China), the outbreak of SARS in other areas seems to be following\na pattern consistent with a requirement of close contact with an actively\nill case of SARS for transmission to occur. One can't help but muse on the\ndefinition of close contact in different environments, and in those areas\nwith high population density, what might be a casual, non-close contact in\nother areas is close enough to allow for transmission in an area with\nhigher population density. This moderator is reminded of studies conducted\non the baseline incidence of poliomyelitis in India back in the early\n80s. It was generally accepted that polio was more of an \"urban disease\"\nwith higher incidences observed in urban areas. Results of studies on the\nbaseline incidence of polio in a highly populated state revealed that the\nrural incidence was on a par with the urban incidence. Our interpretation\nof this observation was that the standard western definition of urban vs.\nrural was based on population density, where rural areas had a markedly\nlower population density than urban areas. In the highly populated\ndistricts of India, rural areas had population densities similar to many\nwestern urban areas. Hence, rather than being an urban disease, polio was\nmore of a high population density disease. Again, food for thought here...\n- Mod.MPP]\nSee Also\nSARS - worldwide (19): etiology 20030330.0786\nSARS - worldwide (18): cases 20030329.0783\nSARS - worldwide (17): cases 20030328.0779\nSARS - Worldwide (16): Etiology 20030328.0774\nSARS - worldwide (15): cases 20030327.0771\nSARS - worldwide (14): overview 20030327.0769\nSARS - worldwide (13): etiology 20030327.0758\nSARS - worldwide (12): correction Shanxi not Shanghai 20030327.0756\nSARS - worldwide (11): cases 20030326.0753\nSARS - worldwide (10): infectious disease perspectives 20030326.0752\nSARS - worldwide (09): clinical features 20030326.0748\nSARS - worldwide (08): China 20030326.0747\nSARS - worldwide (07): cases 20030325.0746\nSARS - worldwide (06): WHO press briefing 20030325.0744\nSARS - worldwide (05): Hong Kong advisory 20030325.0741\nSARS - worldwide (04): etiology 20030325.0737\nSARS - Worldwide (03): cases 20030324.0735\nSARS - worldwide (02): cases 20030324.0734\nSARS - worldwide: cases 20030323.0722\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - worldwide (17) 20030322.0713\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - worldwide (16) 20030322.0711\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - worldwide (15) 20030322.0707\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - worldwide (14) 20030321.0704\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - worldwide (13) 20030321.0703\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - worldwide (12) 20030321.0702\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - worldwide (11) 20030320.0698\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - worldwide (10) 20030319.0689\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - worldwide (09) 20030319.0688\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - worldwide (08) 20030318.0679\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - worldwide (07) 20030318.0678\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - worldwide (06) 20030318.0677\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - Worldwide (05) 20030317.0669\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - Worldwide (04):comment 20030317.0664\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - Worldwide: alert (03) 20030316.0660\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - Worldwide (02):alert 20030315.0649\nSevere Acute Respiratory Syndrome - Worldwide 20030315.0637\nAcute respiratory syndrome - Canada (Ontario) 20030314.0631\nAcute respiratory syndrome - East Asia 20030314.0630\nAcute respiratory syndrome - China (HK), VietNam (03) 20030313.0624\nAcute respiratory syndrome - China (HK), VietNam (02) 20030313.0623\nAcute respiratory syndrome - China (HK), VietNam 20030312.0602\nUndiagnosed illness - Vietnam (Hanoi): RFI 20030311.0595\nInfluenza, H5N1 human case - China (Hong Kong) (05) 20030228.0500\nPneumonia - China (Guangdong) (07) 20030221.0452\nPneumonia - China (Guangdong) (06) 20030220.0447\nPneumonia - China (Guangdong) (05) 20030220.0446\nPneumonia - China (Guangdong) (04) 20030219.0427\nPneumonia - China (Guangdong) (03) 20030214.0390\nPneumonia - China (Guangdong) (02) 20030211.0369\nPneumonia - China (Guangdong): RFI 20030210.0357\n........................mpp/pg/dk\n\n\n*##########################################################*\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.

This patient had concurrent history of hypertension, diabetes, heart\ndisease and a bacterial pneumonia.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n******\n[3]\nDate: 30 Mar 2003\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: Health Canada [edited]\n<http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/english/protection/warnings/2003/2003_11update15.htm>\n\nAs of 30 Mar 2003, Health Canada has received reports of approximately 98\nprobable or suspect cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in\nOntario, British Columbia, Alberta and New Brunswick. There have been 4\ndeaths in Canada. All Canadian cases have occurred in persons who have\ntraveled to Asia or had contact with SARS cases in the household or in a\nhealth-care setting. The information contained in this update is based on\nthe best available information Health Canada has at this time.\nHealth Canada is changing the way it is reporting probable and suspect\ncases of SARS to ensure consistency in reporting across the country.\n\"Probable\" cases of SARS are similar to suspect cases, but often they have\na more severe illness, with progressive shortness of breath and difficulty\nbreathing, and in some cases, chest x-rays show signs of atypical pneumonia.\nA \"suspect\" case of SARS is a person who fits into one of the following 2\ncategories: a person who develops fever and one or more respiratory\nsymptoms, including cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing,\nwithin 10 days of returning from travel to areas in Asia where SARS cases\nare being reported, or a person who develops fever and one or more\nrespiratory symptoms, including cough, shortness of breath or difficulty\nbreathing, within 10 days of having had close contact with a \"probable\"\ncase of SARS (i.e., within one metre).\nThe details of the cases to date are as follows:\nOntario is reporting approximately 81 probable and suspect cases. All cases\nhave occurred in persons who have traveled to Asia or had contact with SARS\ncases in the household or in a health-care setting.\nBritish Columbia is reporting 2 probable and 8 suspect cases.\nNew Brunswick is reporting one suspect case.\nSaskatchewan is reporting one suspect case.\nAlberta is reporting 5 suspect cases.\nManitoba is no longer reporting any suspect or probable cases.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[Today's reports reflect an increase in 60 cases in Hong Kong, and 2\nadditional cases in Singapore. The number of cases reported in Canada has\nincreased from 37 to 98, but the latter figure is a combination of\nsuspected and probable cases, whereas the 37 referred to only probable\ncases. Information on a global worldwide update was not available as of\nthe time of preparation of this update.\nWith the exception of the ongoing outbreak in Hong Kong (and possibly in\nmainland China), the outbreak of SARS in other areas seems to be following\na pattern consistent with a requirement of close contact with an actively\nill case of SARS for transmission to occur. One can't help but muse on the\ndefinition of close contact in different environments, and in those areas\nwith high population density, what might be a casual, non-close contact in\nother areas is close enough to allow for transmission in an area with\nhigher population density. This moderator is reminded of studies conducted\non the baseline incidence of poliomyelitis in India back in the early\n80s. It was generally accepted that polio was more of an \"urban disease\"\nwith higher incidences observed in urban areas. Results of studies on the\nbaseline incidence of polio in a highly populated state revealed that the\nrural incidence was on a par with the urban incidence. Our interpretation\nof this observation was that the standard western definition of urban vs.\nrural was based on population density, where rural areas had a markedly\nlower population density than urban areas. In the highly populated\ndistricts of India, rural areas had population densities similar to many\nwestern urban areas. Hence, rather than being an urban disease, polio was\nmore of a high population density disease. Again, food for thought here...\n- Mod.MPP]\nSee Also\nSARS - worldwide (19): etiology 20030330.0786\nSARS - worldwide (18): cases 20030329.0783\nSARS - worldwide (17): cases 20030328.0779\nSARS - Worldwide (16): Etiology 20030328.0774\nSARS - worldwide (15): cases 20030327.0771\nSARS - worldwide (14): overview 20030327.0769\nSARS - worldwide (13): etiology 20030327.0758\nSARS - worldwide (12): correction Shanxi not Shanghai 20030327.0756\nSARS - worldwide (11): cases 20030326.0753\nSARS - worldwide (10): infectious disease perspectives 20030326.0752\nSARS - worldwide (09): clinical features 20030326.0748\nSARS - worldwide (08): China 20030326.0747\nSARS - worldwide (07): cases 20030325.0746\nSARS - worldwide (06): WHO press briefing 20030325.0744\nSARS - worldwide (05): Hong Kong advisory 20030325.0741\nSARS - worldwide (04): etiology 20030325.0737\nSARS - Worldwide (03): cases 20030324.0735\nSARS - worldwide (02): cases 20030324.0734\nSARS - worldwide: cases 20030323.0722\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - worldwide (17) 20030322.0713\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - worldwide (16) 20030322.0711\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - worldwide (15) 20030322.0707\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - worldwide (14) 20030321.0704\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - worldwide (13) 20030321.0703\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - worldwide (12) 20030321.0702\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - worldwide (11) 20030320.0698\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - worldwide (10) 20030319.0689\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - worldwide (09) 20030319.0688\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - worldwide (08) 20030318.0679\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - worldwide (07) 20030318.0678\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - worldwide (06) 20030318.0677\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - Worldwide (05) 20030317.0669\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - Worldwide (04):comment 20030317.0664\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - Worldwide: alert (03) 20030316.0660\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - Worldwide (02):alert 20030315.0649\nSevere Acute Respiratory Syndrome - Worldwide 20030315.0637\nAcute respiratory syndrome - Canada (Ontario) 20030314.0631\nAcute respiratory syndrome - East Asia 20030314.0630\nAcute respiratory syndrome - China (HK), VietNam (03) 20030313.0624\nAcute respiratory syndrome - China (HK), VietNam (02) 20030313.0623\nAcute respiratory syndrome - China (HK), VietNam 20030312.0602\nUndiagnosed illness - Vietnam (Hanoi): RFI 20030311.0595\nInfluenza, H5N1 human case - China (Hong Kong) (05) 20030228.0500\nPneumonia - China (Guangdong) (07) 20030221.0452\nPneumonia - China (Guangdong) (06) 20030220.0447\nPneumonia - China (Guangdong) (05) 20030220.0446\nPneumonia - China (Guangdong) (04) 20030219.0427\nPneumonia - China (Guangdong) (03) 20030214.0390\nPneumonia - China (Guangdong) (02) 20030211.0369\nPneumonia - China (Guangdong): RFI 20030210.0357\n........................mpp/pg/dk\n\n\n*##########################################################*\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.

Investigation of these cases, including tentative\nidentification of the index case, has progressed rapidly. The Hong Kong\ndepartment of health is tracing, for surveillance purposes, the crew\nmembers and passengers who had taken 2 flights. The general public has been\ninformed and a hot-line has been set up.\nWHO epidemiologists in Geneva, together with experts tracking outbreaks in\naffected countries, have decided today that, based on the information\navailable at present, there is no need to change previous WHO advice.\nWHO continues to recommend no travel restrictions to any destination. WHO\nadvises travellers to remain alert to the symptoms of SARS. These include\nhigh fever, respiratory symptoms, including cough, shortness of breath, and\ndifficulty breathing, and should report these symptoms promptly.\nAs of today, 487 SARS cases have been reported from 12 countries.\nA number of persons with SARS have taken long distance flights after\nbecoming ill. Thousands of passengers who travelled in the same flights\nhave been traced in Germany, Canada, Singapore and the United States. No\ncases have been discovered among these contacts. Today's report of a\npossible transmission of SARS on board a flight is undergoing\ninvestigation. As \"close\" contact is possible during a flight, in\npassengers sitting close to an infected person, such transmission cannot be\nruled out. The evidence to date indicates that in-flight transmission is\nvery unusual.\nHealth authorities and hospital staff the world over are now alert to the\nsymptoms of SARS. Suspect cases are being quickly detected and promptly\nreported. Proper isolation and management of cases has greatly reduced the\nrisk of transmission of newly detected cases to others.\nWHO advice to travellers is being kept under constant review. SARS is an\nemerging disease. Knowledge about is clinical behaviour, response to\ntreatment, and modes and risks of transmission are continually evolving.\nWHO is confident that, in the present climate of heightened awareness and\nrapid and detailed reporting, data useful in understanding SARS and issuing\nsound public health advice are being rapidly collected and rapidly made\navailable.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[ProMED-mail would like to thank subscriber John Herbert\n<j_a_herbert@yahoo.com> for sending information following a radio\nannouncement on this advisory.\nAccording to the very thorough investigation of the cases as presented\nabove, it appears as though the transmission would still qualify as \"close\ncontact\" with the chain of transmission being sitting close to an infected\nindividual on a plane, and then being a member of a tour group that spends\nhours together on a daily basis for multiple days. We await further\ninformation from the investigation of this event. - Mod.MPP]\nSee Also\nSARS - worldwide (04): etiology 20030325.0737\nSARS - Worldwide (03): cases 20030324.0735\nSARS - worldwide (02): cases 20030324.0734\nSARS - worldwide: cases 20030323.0722\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - worldwide (17) 20030322.0713\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - worldwide (16) 20030322.0711\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - worldwide (15) 20030322.0707\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - worldwide (14) 20030321.0704\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - worldwide (13) 20030321.0703\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - worldwide (12) 20030321.0702\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - worldwide (11) 20030320.0698\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - worldwide (10) 20030319.0689\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - worldwide (09) 20030319.0688\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - worldwide (08) 20030318.0679\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - worldwide (07) 20030318.0678\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - worldwide (06) 20030318.0677\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - Worldwide (05) 20030317.0669\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - Worldwide (04):comment 20030317.0664\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - Worldwide: alert (03) 20030316.0660\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - Worldwide (02):alert 20030315.0649\nSevere Acute Respiratory Syndrome - Worldwide 20030315.0637\nAcute respiratory syndrome - Canada (Ontario) 20030314.0631\nAcute respiratory syndrome - East Asia 20030314.0630\nAcute respiratory syndrome - China (HK), VietNam (03) 20030313.0624\nAcute respiratory syndrome - China (HK), VietNam (02) 20030313.0623\nAcute respiratory syndrome - China (HK), VietNam 20030312.0602\nUndiagnosed illness - Vietnam (Hanoi): RFI 20030311.0595\nInfluenza, H5N1 human case - China (Hong Kong) (05) 20030228.0500\nPneumonia - China (Guangdong) (07) 20030221.0452\nPneumonia - China (Guangdong) (06) 20030220.0447\nPneumonia - China (Guangdong) (05) 20030220.0446\nPneumonia - China (Guangdong) (04) 20030219.0427\nPneumonia - China (Guangdong) (03) 20030214.0390\nPneumonia - China (Guangdong) (02) 20030211.0369\nPneumonia - China (Guangdong): RFI 20030210.0357\n...................mpp/dk\n\n\n*##########################################################*\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.

We await further\ninformation from the investigation of this event. - Mod.MPP]\nSee Also\nSARS - worldwide (04): etiology 20030325.0737\nSARS - Worldwide (03): cases 20030324.0735\nSARS - worldwide (02): cases 20030324.0734\nSARS - worldwide: cases 20030323.0722\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - worldwide (17) 20030322.0713\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - worldwide (16) 20030322.0711\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - worldwide (15) 20030322.0707\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - worldwide (14) 20030321.0704\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - worldwide (13) 20030321.0703\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - worldwide (12) 20030321.0702\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - worldwide (11) 20030320.0698\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - worldwide (10) 20030319.0689\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - worldwide (09) 20030319.0688\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - worldwide (08) 20030318.0679\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - worldwide (07) 20030318.0678\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - worldwide (06) 20030318.0677\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - Worldwide (05) 20030317.0669\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - Worldwide (04):comment 20030317.0664\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - Worldwide: alert (03) 20030316.0660\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome - Worldwide (02):alert 20030315.0649\nSevere Acute Respiratory Syndrome - Worldwide 20030315.0637\nAcute respiratory syndrome - Canada (Ontario) 20030314.0631\nAcute respiratory syndrome - East Asia 20030314.0630\nAcute respiratory syndrome - China (HK), VietNam (03) 20030313.0624\nAcute respiratory syndrome - China (HK), VietNam (02) 20030313.0623\nAcute respiratory syndrome - China (HK), VietNam 20030312.0602\nUndiagnosed illness - Vietnam (Hanoi): RFI 20030311.0595\nInfluenza, H5N1 human case - China (Hong Kong) (05) 20030228.0500\nPneumonia - China (Guangdong) (07) 20030221.0452\nPneumonia - China (Guangdong) (06) 20030220.0447\nPneumonia - China (Guangdong) (05) 20030220.0446\nPneumonia - China (Guangdong) (04) 20030219.0427\nPneumonia - China (Guangdong) (03) 20030214.0390\nPneumonia - China (Guangdong) (02) 20030211.0369\nPneumonia - China (Guangdong): RFI 20030210.0357\n...................mpp/dk\n\n\n*##########################################################*\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.
