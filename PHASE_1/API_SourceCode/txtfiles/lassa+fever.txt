States with confirmed cases have activated state-level EOCs.\n- National rapid response teams have been deployed from NCDC [Nigeria Centre for Disease Control] to support response activities in 10 states.\n- Surge staff (doctors, nurses, laboratorians, and hygienist) deployed to ISTH [Irrua Specialist Teaching Hospital Irrua] and FMC [Federal Medical Center] Owo.\n- State Public Health Emergency Operations Centre activated in affected states.\n- The 5 Lassa fever molecular laboratories in the NCDC network are working full capacity to ensure that all samples are tested and results provided within the shortest turnaround time.\n- NCDC is working to support every state in Nigeria to identify one treatment centre, while supporting existing ones with care, treatment, and IPC commodities.\n- Risk communications and community engagement activities have been scaled up across states using television, radio, print, social media, and other strategies.\n- Implementation of Lassa fever environmental response campaign in high-burden states by Federal Ministry of Environment.\n\nNotes on this report\nData source\nInformation for this disease was case-based data retrieved from the National Lassa fever Emergency Operations Centre.\n\nCase definitions\n- Suspected case: any individual presenting with one or more of the following: malaise, fever, headache, sore throat, cough, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, myalgia, chest pain, hearing loss, and either\na. history of contact with excreta or urine of rodents;\nb. history of contact with a probable or confirmed Lassa fever case within a period of 21 days of onset of symptoms; or\nc. any person with inexplicable bleeding/hemorrhage.\n- Confirmed case: any suspected case with laboratory confirmation (positive IgM antibody, PCR, or virus isolation).\n- Probable case: any suspected case (see definition above) who died or absconded without collection of a specimen for laboratory testing\n- Contact: anyone who has been exposed to an infected person, or to an infected person's secretions, excretions, or tissues within 3 weeks of last contact with a confirmed or probable case of Lassa fever\n\nCalculations\n- Case fatality rate (CFR) for this disease is reported for confirmed cases only.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[There were 5 new confirmed and 98 new suspected cases in week 45 (12-8 Nov 2020) indicating that Lassa fever (LF) virus transmission is continuing but declining considerably from the 1st 4 months of this year (2020). The decline is doubtless responsible for the declaration of the end of the emergency phase of the disease on 28 Apr 2020. The graph in Figure 6 indicates that a peak of cases occurred in week 7 (10-16 Feb 2020). There are now 234 deaths among confirmed cases so far this year (2020). Fortunately, there are no newly infected healthcare workers during the current week (week 45).\n\nThe report above confirms that Ondo, Ebonyi, and Edo states have the majority of cases. The area affected remains at 27 states, and local government area is now at 130 with at least one case. Nigeria is into the period of the year when fewer cases usually occur, as illustrated in the graph in Figure 6. There has been a peak in case numbers between weeks 1 and 11 (January-March) over the past 3 years, and it appears that this will be the case again this year (2020).\n\nTransmission of LF virus occurs when individuals are in contact with rodent reservoir host excreta or are within healthcare facilities.

The decline is doubtless responsible for the declaration of the end of the emergency phase of the disease on 28 Apr 2020. The graph in Figure 6 indicates that a peak of cases may have occurred in week 7. There are now 218 deaths among confirmed cases so far this year (2020). Fortunately, there are no newly infected healthcare workers during the current week (week 26).\n\nThe report above confirms that Ondo, Ebonyi, and Edo states have the majority of cases. The area affected remains at 27 states, and local government areas remain at 129 with at least one case. Nigeria is into the period of the year when fewer cases usually occur, as illustrated in the graph in Figure 6 (available at the source URL above). There has been a peak in case numbers between weeks 1 and 11 (January-March 2020) over the past 3 years, and it appears that this is the case again this year (2020).\n\nTransmission of LF virus occurs when individuals are in contact with rodent reservoir host excreta or are within healthcare facilities. It is encouraging to learn that risk communications and community engagement activities have been scaled up across states using television, radio, print, social media, and other strategies for avoidance of contact with rodent virus reservoirs and their excreta.\n\nImages of the rodent reservoirs of Lassa fever virus:\n_Mastomys natalensis_: https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/45326-Mastomys-natalensis;\n_Mastomys erythroleucus_ and _Hylomyscus pamfi_: http://punchng.com/nigerias-large-rat-population-threatens-lassa-fever-war/.\n\nMaps of Nigeria: http://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/map/profile/nigeria.pdf and http://healthmap.org/promed/p/62. - Mod.TY]", "summary": "\n- Confirmed case: any suspected case with laboratory confirmation (positive IgM antibody, PCR, or virus isolation)\n- Probable case: any suspected case (see definition above) who died or absconded without collection of a specimen for laboratory testing\n- Contact: anyone who has been exposed to an infected person, or to an infected person's secretions, excretions, or tissues within 3 weeks of last contact with a confirmed or probable case of Lassa fever\n\nCalculations\n- Case fatality rate (CFR) for this disease is reported for confirmed cases only.

The decline is doubtless responsible for the declaration of the end of the emergency phase of the disease on 28 Apr 2020. The graph in Figure 6 indicates that a peak of cases occurred in week 7 (10-16 Feb 2020). There are now 241 deaths among confirmed cases so far this year (2020). Unfortunately, there is one newly infected healthcare worker during the current week (week 50).\n\nThe report above confirms that Ondo, Ebonyi, and Edo states have the majority of cases. The area affected remains at 27 states, and local government area is now at 130 with at least one case. Nigeria is into the period of the year when fewer cases usually occur, as illustrated in the graph in Figure 6. There has been a peak in case numbers between weeks 1 and 11 (January-March) over the past 3 years, and it appears that this will be the case again this year (2020).\n\nTransmission of LF virus occurs when individuals are in contact with rodent reservoir host excreta or are within healthcare facilities.

The graph in figure 6 indicates a peak of cases may have occurred in week 7. It will be interesting to see whether the decline in cases continues going forward. There are now 185 deaths among confirmed cases so far this year (2020). Fortunately, there are no newly infected healthcare workers during the current week (week 13).\n\nThe report above confirms that Ondo and Edo states have the majority of cases. The area affected remains at 27 states, but local governement areas increased to 126 with at least one case. Nigeria is into the period of the year when fewer cases usually occur, as illustrated in the graph in Figure 6 (available at the source URL above). There has been a peak in case numbers between weeks 1 and 11 (January-March) over the past 3 years, and it appears that this is the case again this year (2020).\n\nTransmission of LF virus occurs when individuals are in contact with rodent reservoir host excreta or are within healthcare facilities.

The graph in Figure 6 indicates a peak of cases may have occurred in week 7. It will be interesting to see if the decline in cases continues going forward. There are now 132 deaths among confirmed cases so far this year (2020). There is one new infected healthcare worker during the current week (week 9).\n\nThe report above confirms that Ondo and Edo states have the majority of cases. The area affected remains at 27 states, but local government areas increased to 118 with at least one case. Nigeria is still into the period of the year when more cases usually occur, as illustrated in the graph in Figure 6 (available at the source URL above). There has been a peak in case numbers between weeks 1 and 11 (Jan-Mar) over the past 3 years, and it appears that this will be the case again this year (2020).\n\nTransmission of LF virus occurs when individuals are in contact with rodent reservoir host excreta or are within healthcare facilities.

The casualty figure was also corroborated by the state commissioner for health, Dr. Wahab Adegbenro.\n\nA total of 112 confirmed cases were said to have been recorded in the state so far just as 5 local government areas [LGAs] of the state were said to have been hit by the disease.\n\nThe affected council areas include Akoko South West, Ose, Owo, Akure South, and Ondo West LGAs, while the victims were transferred to the Federal Medical Centre, Owo, and a treatment centre in Akure.\n\nThe state government last week revealed that 16 deaths had been recorded from the disease out of the 100 cases that were confirmed.\n\nAdegbenro said the figure of the victims rose as a result of the influx of some victims from the neighbouring states to Ondo due to free treatment in the state.\n\n'We are having the high figure because Ondo state is the only state that the treatment of Lassa fever is free of charge.

The reported number of deaths remains at 3. The previous ProMED-mail post (see Lassa fever - West Africa (31): Liberia 20190902.6653653) reported that according to MoH data, a total of 92 suspected cases between 1 Jan-25 Aug 2019, including 21 deaths, have been reported. Of these, 25 cases have been confirmed by RT-PCR (Nimba (9), Bong (10), Grand Bassa (5), and Grand Kru (1)), while 9 remain suspected cases, the release recorded. The case-fatality rate among confirmed cases in that report was stated as 36% (9 deaths out of 25 confirmed cases). Males are mostly affected by the disease (56%) of confirmed cases as compared to females.\n\nOccurrence of Lassa fever cases in areas outside the usual 'Lassa fever belt' is of concern, and the Ministry of Health is wise to increase public information and advize citizens about measures that should be taken to avoid infection with the virus. Occurrence of Lassa fever in Liberia is not new, and cases have occurred there sporadically for several years. Between 1 Jan and 27 Jun 2018, 20 cases were laboratory confirmed (see archive no. 20180711.5898495). Apparently, all those Lassa fever virus infections were acquired by contact with infected rodents or their excretions. Lassa fever virus can be acquired from infected rodents or patients in the hospital. Transmission can occur in health facilities when personal protective equipment is not employed or barrier-nursing practices or biocontainment facilities in the laboratory are not adequate to protect staff from blood and secretions of infected patients.\n\nAs mentioned in previous posts, Lassa fever virus transmission to humans occurs when people are in contact with the reservoir rodent host, the multimammate mouse (_Mastomys natalensis_ and _M. erythroleucus_) and the African wood mouse (_Hylomycus pamfi_) or their excreta, as was likely the situation in many of these cases. Rodent control has to be undertaken at the village level with individual households employing the preventive measures listed above.

The county health team is therefore calling on residents to report any suspected case, particularly people who may have developed prolonged fever, to any of the nearest health facilities. Residents are also advised not to bury the dead (suspected Lassa fever patients) without referencing trained medical practitioners.\n\n'Protect your food from rats, and also avoid touching them at all times should you encounter one,' he added.\n\nLassa fever, also known as Lassa hemorrhagic fever (LHF), is a type of viral hemorrhagic fever caused by the Lassa virus.

Males are mostly affected by the disease (56%) of confirmed cases as compared to females.\n\nOccurrence of Lassa fever cases in areas outside the usual 'Lassa fever belt' is of concern, and the Ministry of Health is wise to increase public information and advise citizens about measures that should be taken to avoid infection with the virus. Occurrence of Lassa fever in Liberia is not new, and cases have occurred there sporadically for several years. Between 1 Jan and 27 Jun 2018, 20 cases were laboratory confirmed (see archive no. 20180711.5898495). Apparently, all those Lassa fever virus infections were acquired by contact with infected rodents or their excretions. Lassa fever virus can be acquired from infected rodents or patients in the hospital. Transmission can occur in health facilities when personal protective equipment is not employed or barrier-nursing practices or biocontainment facilities in the laboratory are not adequate to protect staff from blood and secretions of infected patients.\n\nAs mentioned in previous posts, Lassa fever virus transmission to humans occurs when people are in contact with the reservoir rodent host, the multimammate mouse (_Mastomys natalensis_ and _M. erythroleucus_) and the African wood mouse (_Hylomycus pamfi_) or their excreta, as was likely the situation in many of these cases. Rodent control has to be undertaken at the village level with individual households employing the preventive measures listed above. This requires an extensive and continuous public education effort.\n\nImages of the _Mastomys natalensis_ mouse, the rodent reservoir of Lassa fever virus, can be seen at https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/45326-Mastomys-natalensis and of _M. erythroleucus_ and _Hylomycus pamfi_ at http://punchng.com/nigerias-large-rat-population-threatens-lassa-fever-war/. - Mod.TY\n\nMaps of Liberia: http://www.theworldmap.net/country/big/liberia/ and http://healthmap.org/promed/p/54]", "summary": "Communicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The occurrence of Lassa fever cases in Liberia is continuing with the confirmation of 9 new cases. \n\nOccurrence of Lassa fever cases in areas outside the usual 'Lassa fever belt' is of concern, and the Ministry of Health is wise to increase public information and advise citizens about measures that should be taken to avoid infection with the virus. \n\nLassa fever, also known as Lassa hemorrhagic fever (LHF), is a type of viral hemorrhagic fever caused by the Lassa virus.

Fortunately, there are also no new healthcare workers infected during this reporting period, and the total number of infected healthcare workers remains at 19, a likely indication that effective barrier nursing and the use of personal protective equipment are being employed.

On 20 Nov 2019, WHO was informed by the Netherlands' International Health Regulations (IHR) National Focal Point of one imported case of Lassa fever from Sierra Leone. The patient was a male doctor, a Dutch national who worked in a rural Masanga hospital in Tonkolili district, Northern province in Sierra Leone.\n\nThe probable route of transmission is believed to be through exposures during a surgical procedure he performed on 2 patients in Masanga hospital on 4 Nov 2019. Both patients died following surgical interventions; one died on 4 Nov [2019] and the 2nd on 19 Nov 2019. Both surgical patients are considered probable cases, and the patient who died on 4 Nov [2019] is believed to be the index case for this outbreak, likely the source of infection of the Dutch doctor.\n\nThe doctor's symptoms started on 11 Nov [2019], a week after performing the surgery, and included malaise and headache, followed by fever, diarrhoea, vomiting, and cough. While symptomatic, he attended a surgical training event in Freetown, Sierra Leone, on 11-12 Nov [2019]. This event was also attended by several international participants from the Netherlands and United Kingdom in addition to 35 local participants. On 19 Nov [2019], the symptomatic doctor was medically evacuated to the Netherlands after he did not respond to treatment with antimalarials and antibiotics. The evacuation was managed by a dedicated ambulance plane with 4 staff from a German organization. During the journey, the plane stopped in Morocco (Agadir Airport). As the illness was initially thought to be malaria or typhoid fever, personal protective equipment, other than gloves, were not used, and no specific containment procedures were used during the medical evacuation.\n\nLaboratory specimens from the patient tested positive for Lassa fever by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing at Erasmus University Medical Centre in Rotterdam on 20 Nov 2019.\n\nThe patient died on the night of 23 Nov 2019.\n\nOn 22 Nov 2019, WHO was informed of a 2nd laboratory-confirmed case of Lassa fever in another Dutch healthcare worker, who also worked in the Masanga hospital. Samples from this 2nd case were sent to the Erasmus University Medical Centre in Rotterdam and tested positive for Lassa fever by PCR. The 2nd case also participated in one of the surgical procedures performed by the medically evacuated Dutch doctor. The date of onset of symptoms of the 2nd case was 11 Nov [2019]. This case was subsequently medically evacuated in high containment isolation to the Netherlands and is currently under treatment. Isolation precautions have been implemented.\n\nThe Masanga hospital in Sierra Leone where the Dutch doctor worked is supported by several non-governmental organizations with international healthcare workers including staff from countries including Denmark, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom, alongside national healthcare workers.\n\nContact tracing and monitoring activities have been initiated in these countries as required.\n\nSierra Leone\nAn outbreak investigation and response is ongoing under leadership of the Ministry of Health (MoH), supported by CDC and WHO. As of 24 Nov 2019, in addition to the 2 Dutch cases, 2 further cases among national healthcare workers, one confirmed and another suspected, have been reported from Masanga hospital. Both healthcare workers were involved in the management of the 2 surgical patients operated by the Dutch doctor on 4 Nov [2019]. All high-risk contacts in Masanga hospital are being monitored.\n\nThe Netherlands\nSeveral high- and low-risk contacts have been identified among personal contacts and healthcare workers. According to Dutch protocols, they will be monitored until 21 days after the last potential exposure. Five high-risk Dutch contacts who were in Sierra Leone have been repatriated through a dedicated flight and are now under monitoring. Dutch low-risk contacts in Sierra Leone have been advised to perform self-monitoring in situ.\n\nGermany\nThe 4 medical evacuation flight staff (2 pilots and 2 healthcare workers) spent 8 flight hours in a confined space in the ambulance plane without any barrier between the cockpit and cabin. They have been assessed as moderate-risk contacts. According to German recommendations, they are being monitored for 21 days following the last potential exposure on 19 Nov (until 10 Dec 2019).\n\nUnited Kingdom (UK)\nUK authorities have identified 18 UK nationals as contacts of the 1st Dutch case. Of these 18, 8 are high-risk contacts and were exposed in Masanga hospital while working alongside the doctor or may have been exposed to the 2 patients he operated on 4 Nov [2019]. Of these 8 high-risk contacts, 7 returned to the UK and one went to Uganda. In addition, 13 UK nationals attended a surgical training event in Freetown, Sierra Leone, on 11-12 Nov [2019], which was also attended by the 1st Dutch case while already symptomatic. Of these 13 participants, 3 came from Masanga hospital and belong to the above group of 8 high-risk contacts. The remaining 10 participants were possibly exposed during the training and are considered low-risk contacts. Of these 18 contacts identified (8 high-risk and 10 low-risk contacts), 17 have returned to the UK and are under public health follow-up for 21 days; one high-risk contact went to Uganda. There were also several Dutch and 35 local participants who attended this event. UK authorities are in contact with the organizers, and the names of participants from Sierra Leone and the Netherlands have been shared with respective National IHR Focal Points.\n\nUganda\nOne contact, a UK national, who may have been exposed in Masanga hospital on 15 Nov [2019] and subsequently travelled to Uganda on 16 Nov [2019], is now being followed up by the Uganda authorities, and the UK authorities are providing support remotely though public health and consular channels.\n\nThe National IHR Focal Point of the Netherlands has also informed their counterpart in Morocco about the potential risk of exposure at the Agadir Airport. Morocco National IHR Focal Point confirmed that the investigation is conducted, and control measures have been implemented to ensure there was no transmission in Agadir.\n\nSierra Leone is endemic for Lassa fever. Previously, sporadic cases have been exported to Europe from endemic countries in Africa, such as Togo, Liberia and Nigeria. In 2018, a total of 23 confirmed Lassa fever cases with 14 deaths (case fatality rate 61%) were reported from 2 districts of Sierra Leone: Bo district (2 cases; 2 deaths) and Kenema district (21 cases; 12 deaths).\n\nFrom 1 Jan-17 Nov 2019, of the 182 suspected cases, 10 cases with 6 deaths (case fatality ratio 60%) have been confirmed for Lassa virus infection. All confirmed cases during this period were reported from Kenema district, which has been reporting cases of Lassa fever every year.\n\nPublic health response\n\nThe International Health Regulations Focal Points and Health Authorities in Denmark, Germany, Morocco, the Netherlands, Sierra Leone, Uganda, and the UK have been collaborating to share information about this event, together with the WHO and US CDC. Contact tracing and monitoring activities for 21 days following the last potential exposure have been initiated in Sierra Leone, Germany, the Netherlands, Uganda, and the UK. Investigations are ongoing in Sierra Leone in Masanga hospital and surrounding areas in Tonkolili district with a deployment of a national rapid-response team, supported by US CDC and WHO.\n\nWHO risk assessment\n\nLassa fever is an acute viral haemorrhagic fever illness that is transmitted to humans via contact with food or household items contaminated with rodent urine or faeces. Human-to-human infections and laboratory transmission can also occur through direct contact with the blood, urine, faeces, or other bodily secretions of a person with Lassa fever. The overall case fatality rate is 1%; it is 15% among patients hospitalized with severe illness.\n\nSierra Leone is endemic for Lassa fever, and sporadic cases have been exported to Europe from endemic countries in Africa, such as Togo, Liberia and Nigeria in recent years. However, in general, the secondary transmission of Lassa fever through human contacts is rare.\n\nData from recent imported cases show that secondary transmission of Lassa fever is rare when standard infection-control precautions are observed. Further, epidemiological investigations are ongoing: human-to-human transmission occurs in both community and healthcare settings, where the virus may spread by contaminated medical equipment. Healthcare workers are at risk if caring for Lassa fever patients in the absence of appropriate infection prevention and control measures. Considering the seasonal flare-ups of cases in humid zones between December and March, countries in West Africa that are endemic for Lassa fever are encouraged to strengthen their related surveillance systems.\n\nWHO advice\n\nPrevention of Lassa fever relies on community engagement and promoting hygienic conditions to discourage rodents from entering homes.\n\nThere is currently no approved vaccine. Early supportive care with rehydration and symptomatic treatment improves survival. Family members and healthcare workers should always be careful to avoid contact with blood and body fluids while caring for sick persons.\n\nAccording to WHO guidance for viral haemorrhagic fever, healthcare staff should consistently implement standard precautions when caring for all patients to prevent infections acquired in a healthcare setting and strictly apply contact precautions, including isolation, when caring for suspected or confirmed Lassa fever patients or handling their clinical specimens or body fluids. Standard precautions are meant to reduce the risk of transmission of bloodborne and other pathogens from both recognized and unrecognized sources. Standard precautions are recommended in the care and treatment of all patients regardless of their perceived or confirmed infectious status. They represent the basic fundamental level of infection prevention and control and include hand hygiene, use of personal protective equipment to avoid direct contact with blood and body fluids, prevention of needle stick and injuries from other sharp instruments, and a set of environmental controls. Sterilization and environmental cleaning should also be particularly strengthened and undergo quality control assessments.\n\nIn order to avoid any direct contact with blood and body fluids and/or splashes onto facial mucosa (eyes, nose, mouth) when providing direct care for a patient with suspected or confirmed Lassa virus, personal protective equipment should include\n1) clean non-sterile gloves,\n2) a clean, non-sterile fluid-resistant gown, and\n3) protection of facial mucosa against splashes (mask and eye protection, or a face shield).\nGiven the nonspecific presentation of viral haemorrhagic fevers, isolation of ill travellers and consistent implementation of standard precautions are key to preventing secondary transmission. When consistently applied, these measures can prevent secondary transmission even if travel history information is not obtained, not immediately available, or the diagnosis of a viral haemorrhagic fever is delayed.\n\nWHO continues to advise all countries in the Lassa fever belt due to the need to enhance early detection and treatment of cases to reduce the case fatality rate as well as strengthen cross-border collaboration. WHO advises against any restrictions on travel or trade to or from Sierra Leone based on the current available information.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The above report provides the details and timelines related to the 2 confirmed cases of the Dutch physicians and the many suspected contacts.

From 1 Jan-17 Nov 2019, of the 182 suspected cases, 10 cases with 6 deaths (case fatality ratio 60%) have been confirmed for Lassa virus infection. Both surgical patients are considered probable cases, and the patient who died on 4 Nov [2019] is believed to be the index case for this outbreak, likely the source of infection of the Dutch doctor.

The Masanga hospital in Sierra Leone where the Dutch doctor worked is supported by several non-governmental organizations with international healthcare workers including staff from countries including Denmark, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom, alongside national healthcare workers. Healthcare workers are at risk if caring for Lassa fever patients in the absence of appropriate infection prevention and control measures. Both healthcare workers were involved in the management of the 2 surgical patients operated by the Dutch doctor on 4 Nov [2019]. Bo district (2 cases; 2 deaths) and Kenema district (21 cases; 12 deaths). The probable route of transmission is believed to be through exposures during a surgical procedure he performed on 2 patients in Masanga hospital on 4 Nov 2019. Both patients died following surgical interventions; one died on 4 Nov [2019] and the 2nd on 19 Nov 2019. The 4 medical evacuation flight staff (2 pilots and 2 healthcare workers) spent 8 flight hours in a confined space in the ambulance plane without any barrier between the cockpit and cabin. All confirmed cases during this period were reported from Kenema district, which has been reporting cases of Lassa fever every year. In addition, 13 UK nationals attended a surgical training event in Freetown, Sierra Leone, on 11-12 Nov [2019], which was also attended by the 1st Dutch case while already symptomatic.

For the disease to spread to Grand Kru County, gives health authorities the cause for concern.'\n\nAccording to MoH data, a total of 92 suspected cases between 1 Jan-25 Aug 2019, including 21 deaths, have been reported.\n\n'Of these, 25 cases have been confirmed by RT-PCR (Nimba-9, Bong-10, Grand Bassa-5, and Grand Kru -1), while 9 remain suspected cases,' the release recorded.\n\nThe case fatality rate among confirmed cases is 36% (9 deaths out of 25 confirmed cases). Males are mostly affected by the disease (56%) of confirmed cases as compared to females.\n\nThe MoH release also said that although Lassa fever is not new to Liberia, it is a deadly viral disease that requires urgent attention. The disease is spread by rodents or rats and through close contact with infected persons.\n\n'We are concerned about the sporadic increase of Lassa fever cases outside the Lassa Belt in Liberia,' meaning Nimba, Bong, and Grand Gedeh counties.\n\n'For Lassa fever to affect Grand Kru other than those counties it has previously affected, gives us the fear to raise the alert,' Dr Kateh told the Daily Observer via mobile phone on [Fri 2 Sep 2019].\n\nHenceforth, MoH authorities in collaboration with partners and the National Public Health Institute of Liberia (NPHIL), said they are responding to the Lassa fever outbreak in the country.\n\nAccording to a release issued in Monrovia on 22 Aug 2019, Bong County Health Team notified NPHIL and MoH of the disease's outbreak following the confirmation of one case from Suakoko District, Bong County.\n\nThe case concerned the death of a 30-year-old male and a laboratory technician; a health worker, who previously worked with the Phebe Hospital, and a resident of Phebe Airstrip.\n\n'Our hearts are broken, and we express our heartfelt condolences to members of the bereaved family,' MoH said in a release on [Fri 30 Aug 2019].\n\nSimilarly, on 24 and 25 Aug 2019, the National Public Health Reference Laboratory confirmed 2 additional cases of Lassa fever infection in a 46-year old male as well as a 14-year old female, both residents of Suakoko Town, Bong County.\n\nSo far, the release said a total of 30 contacts, including 18 health workers, have been line-listed and are being followed up to the extent that 2 of the contacts have become symptomatic, though one of them have been tested negative.\n\nAdditionally, 2 cases (one contact) remain in isolation and are undergoing Ribavirin (Lassa) treatment, 'because this is the 10th confirmed case being detected from Bong County since [the beginning of] 2019.'\n\nIn response to the outbreak, MoH, NPHIL, World Health Organization (WHO), United States-based Centers for Disease Control and Preventions (CDC), and partners are providing technical, financial, and logistical support to the District Response Teams.\n\n'No epidemiological link has been established between these cases. However, there is a likelihood for these cases to be linked based on history of the source of infection,' the release declared.\n\nHealth authorities are therefore advising people to 'Keep your environment clean; cover your dishes to prevent rats excreting or urinating on them; cover food in tightly-closed containers to prevent rats from playing in food or drinking water; do not eat rats, because you can get the sickness by coming in contact with their blood, [urine, or feces] do not dry food in open places where rats can reach; avoid body contact with infected persons and endemic zone; and visit a health facility immediately when you feel sick.'\n\nMeanwhile, NPHIL, MoH, and partners have appealed to the general public to take necessary preventive measures, and kindly report cases of fever (any kind) to the nearest health facility.\n\n'We continue to improve our rapid response teams at county, district, and community levels through the County Emergency Operations Centers (EOCs), and to provide technical, financial and logistical support to the outbreak,' the release said.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Kunihiko Iizuka\n\n******\n[2]\nDate: Fri 30 Aug 2019\nSource: Front Page Africa [edited]\nhttps://frontpageafricaonline.com/blog/liberias-health-ministry-declares-lassa-fever-outbreak/\n\n\nAt least 21 people have died from Lassa fever in Liberia this year [2019] as the Ministry of Health declared an outbreak of the disease on [Fri 30 Aug 2019] in Monrovia. One health worker, who was a laboratory technician, is amongst the dead.\n\nThere are also 25 confirmed cases and 92 suspected cases recorded between [1 Jan-25 Aug 2019], according to Dr Francis Kateh, Chief Medical officer of Liberia.\n\nThese cases are reported from Nimba (9), Bong (10), Grand Bassa (5), and Grand Kru (1), while 92 other cases remain suspected cases, the National Public Health Institute said in a release.\n\nOn [24 and 25 Aug 2019], NPHIL says its laboratory also confirmed 2 additional cases of Lassa fever infection in a 46-year old male and a 14-year old female, both residents of Suakoko Town, Bong County.\n\nThe case fatality rate among confirmed cases is 36% and males are mostly affected by the disease (56%) of confirmed cases as compared to females, the release disclosed.\n\n'What is more concerning to us is the fact that when health workers that have the authority and have been trained to identify and take care of others, are being infected then that escalates the process to another level,' Dr Keteh told journalists on Friday morning [30 Aug 2019] at an impromptu press conference intended to announce the emergency, adding that 'Some health workers' have been tested and are undergoing treatment.\n\nAdded Tolbert Nyenswah, Director General of NPHIL: 'Lassa is 2nd Ebola, no need to hide the information. It's better we put it [the information] out there -- the situation we are dealing with and how we can prevent it.'\n\n'So, it is important that we raise this and let the general public know that there are a couple of things that they can do in order to save lives.'\n\nCases outside 'Lassa belt'\n--------------------------\nThe Chief Medical Officer stressed that the situation is 'alarming' because cases are being confirmed outside of the region known for recording Lassa fever.\n\n'From the Nimba County area going through Bong [county] to Lofa County -- that is the Lassa Belt -- and so those are places that we have always been concerned [about] but, if you can now find Lassa in other parts of Liberia then, of course, it's becoming a major issue,' he said.\n\n'Normally, it's during the dry season that we see the escalation of Lassa fever but during the rainy season if we are having people positive then it's also concerning.'\n\nWhat is Lassa fever?\n--------------------\nLassa fever is a deadly viral disease which is spread by rodents or rats and through close contact with affected persons. The illness was discovered in 1969 and is named after a town in Nigeria where the 1st cases occurred.\n\nIt is endemic in parts of West Africa including Sierra Leone, Liberia, Guinea and Nigeria, according to the US Center for Disease Control, CDC.\n\nAn estimated 100 000 to 300 000 infections of Lassa fever occur annually, with approximately 5000 deaths.\n\n'Surveillance for Lassa fever is not standardized; therefore, these estimates are crude. In some areas of Sierra Leone and Liberia, it is known that 10-16% of people admitted to hospitals annually have Lassa fever, demonstrating the serious impact the disease has on the region,' the CDC states on its website.\n\nIs Liberia prepared to deal with Lassa?\n---------------------------------------\nNPHIL, the Liberian government agency responsible to track diseases, says the viral disease is not new to Liberia but they are concerned about the 'sporadic increase' outside the Lassa Belt which requires 'urgent attention.'\n\nHowever, Nyenswah expressed confidence that the country can deal with the outbreak, disclosing that there's a Lassa fever contingency comprehensive plan that has been rollout to stop other counties that may get infected by the disease.\n\nHe said NPHIL has moved drugs to start treating patients but said more drugs are needed as well as the monitoring of over 30 contacts to 'avoid these patients from showing symptoms'.\n\nDr Kateh added that the health sector 'has the capacity to curtail those diseases that may show their faces' in Liberia but he also stressed that the 'critical thing' is gathering support to ensure public health issues are mitigated.\n\n'This is where the government and our partners have to come together and how we can give the necessary support,' he said.\n\nLiberia was rocked by the Ebola outbreak between 2014 and 2015 exposing the weakness of the country's health sector and killing over 11 000 people. But the health authority has said the sector is [more] resilient than before the 2014 outbreak.\n\n'One of the things we've said is that after Ebola we are not going to find ourselves in the situation that we were in prior to Ebola and it is also important that when these issues come about we will be as transparent as possible to let you know what is going on and what steps we are taking to curtail the infectious rate,' said Drs Kateh.\n\nMeanwhile, he called on the public to improve hygiene measures by keeping their environment clean, cover dishes to prevent rats from coming in contact with them, cover food in tightly-closed containers, avoid eating rats, avoid drying food in open places, avoid body contact with affected persons and endemic zone, and visit a health facility immediately when you feel sick amongst others measures.\n\nNPHIL, MOH and partners have also called on the general public to take the necessary preventive measures and report cases of fever to the nearest health facility.\n\n'We continue to improve our rapid response teams at county, district, and community levels through the County Emergency Operations Centers (EOCs) and to provide technical, financial and logistical support to the outbreaks,' NPHIL release added.\n\n[Byline: Alpha Daffae Senkpeni]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Kunihiko Iizuka\n\n[Occurrence of Lassa fever cases in areas outside the usual 'Lassa fever belt' is of concern and the Ministry of Health is wise to increase public information and advise citizens about measures that should be taken to avoid infection with the virus. Occurrence of Lassa fever in Liberia is not new and cases have occurred there sporadically for several years. Between 1 Jan and 27 Jun 2018, 20 cases were laboratory confirmed (see archive 20180711.5898495). Apparently, all those Lassa fever virus infections were acquired by contact with infected rodents or their excretions. Lassa fever virus can be acquired from infected rodents or patients in the hospital. Transmission can occur in health facilities when personal protective equipment is not employed, barrier-nursing practices, or biocontainment facilities in the laboratory are not adequate to protect staff from blood and secretions of infected patients.\n\nAs mentioned in previous posts, Lassa fever virus transmission to humans occurs when people are in contact with the reservoir rodent host, the multimammate mouse (_Mastomys natalensis_ and _M. erythroleucus_) and the African wood mouse (_Hylomycus pamfi_) or their excreta, as was likely the situation in many of these cases. Rodent control has to be undertaken at the village level with individual households employing the preventive measures listed above.

A ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n[1]\n \n\nSo far, the release said a total of 30 contacts, including 18 health workers, have been line-listed and are being followed up to the extent that 2 of the contacts have become symptomatic, though one of them have been tested negative.\n\n Similarly, on 24 and 25 Aug 2019, the National Public Health Reference Laboratory confirmed 2 additional cases of Lassa fever infection in a 46-year old male as well as a 14-year old female, both residents of Suakoko Town, Bong County. \n\nMeanwhile, NPHIL, MoH, and partners have appealed to the general public to take necessary preventive measures, and kindly report cases of fever (any kind) to the nearest health facility. \n\nNPHIL, MOH and partners have also called on the general public to take the necessary preventive measures and report cases of fever to the nearest health facility. \n\nThere are also 25 confirmed cases and 92 suspected cases recorded between [1 Jan-25 Aug 2019], according to Dr Francis Kateh, Chief Medical officer of Liberia. \n\n'Of these, 25 cases have been confirmed by RT-PCR (Nimba-9, Bong-10, Grand Bassa-5, and Grand Kru -1), while 9 remain suspected cases,' the release recorded. \n\n'What is more concerning to us is the fact that when health workers that have the authority and have been trained to identify and take care of others, are being infected then that escalates the process to another level,' Dr Keteh told journalists on Friday morning [30 Aug 2019] at an impromptu press conference intended to announce the emergency, adding that 'Some health workers' have been tested and are undergoing treatment. On [24 and 25 Aug 2019], NPHIL says its laboratory also confirmed 2 additional cases of Lassa fever infection in a 46-year old male and a 14-year old female, both residents of Suakoko Town, Bong County. \n\nThe MoH release also said that although Lassa fever is not new to Liberia, it is a deadly viral disease that requires urgent attention. The case fatality rate among confirmed cases is 36% and males are mostly affected by the disease (56%) of confirmed cases as compared to females, the release disclosed. \n\n'We continue to improve our rapid response teams at county, district, and community levels through the County Emergency Operations Centers (EOCs), and to provide technical, financial and logistical support to the outbreak,' the release said. \n\n'We are concerned about the sporadic increase of Lassa fever cases outside the Lassa Belt in Liberia,' meaning Nimba, Bong, and Grand Gedeh counties. \n\nHowever, Nyenswah expressed confidence that the country can deal with the outbreak, disclosing that there's a Lassa fever contingency comprehensive plan that has been rollout to stop other counties that may get infected by the disease. \n\n'One of the things we've said is that after Ebola we are not going to find ourselves in the situation that we were in prior to Ebola and it is also important that when these issues come about we will be as transparent as possible to let you know what is going on and what steps we are taking to curtail the infectious rate,' said Drs Kateh. \n\nDr Kateh added that the health sector 'has the capacity to curtail those diseases that may show their faces' in Liberia but he also stressed that the 'critical thing' is gathering support to ensure public health issues are mitigated. \n\n\nAt least 21 people have died from Lassa fever in Liberia this year [2019] as the Ministry of Health declared an outbreak of the disease on [Fri 30 Aug 2019] in Monrovia. \n\nCases outside 'Lassa belt'\n \n\n'We continue to improve our rapid response teams at county, district, and community levels through the County Emergency Operations Centers (EOCs) and to provide technical, financial and logistical support to the outbreaks,' NPHIL release added. As mentioned in previous posts, Lassa fever virus transmission to humans occurs when people are in contact with the reservoir rodent host, the multimammate mouse (_Mastomys natalensis_ and _M. erythroleucus_) and the African wood mouse (_Hylomycus pamfi_) or their excreta, as was likely the situation in many of these cases. \n\n'From the Nimba County area going through Bong [county] to Lofa County -- that is the Lassa Belt -- and so those are places that we have always been concerned [about] but, if you can now find Lassa in other parts of Liberia then, of course, it's becoming a major issue,' he said. The case fatality rate among confirmed cases is 36% (9 deaths out of 25 confirmed cases). \n\n'Our hearts are broken, and we express our heartfelt condolences to members of the bereaved family,' MoH said in a release on [Fri 30 Aug 2019].

The statement that contained the declaration was co-signed by the NCDC's director general, Chikwe Ihekweazu, and Clement Peter, the officer-in-charge of the World Health Organization, Nigeria, (WHO), Premium Times reports.\n\nThe NCDC's boss said that due to an impressive response, the Lassa fever case count has notably dropped, such that the disease in the country has fallen below emergency levels. He said: 'This year [2019], there was also a decline in case fatality rate of Lassa fever, from 27% in 2018 to 22% in 2019.' However, Ihekweazu said that the deadly disease is not yet over in the country, as there might be few cases of patients with the fever, adding that the agency will work with a multi-sectoral Lassa fever Technical Working Group for co-ordination of efforts. He said: 'Given that Lassa fever is endemic in Nigeria, it is likely that the country will continue to record cases of Lassa fever. 'The group's focus is to continue monitoring cases, as well as improve disease prevention, surveillance, diagnosis, and response activities across all levels in Nigeria.\n\n'However, we have several research strategies to improve our knowledge of the disease. We are also working with states and partners to establish more long-term strategies, such as improved risk communication, infection prevention and control, regular environmental sanitation, enhanced capacity of health workers, and improvement of treatment centres, among others.'\n\nOn his part, Peter said: 'WHO remains committed to working with the government of Nigeria and other partners to sustain and improve Nigeria's capacity to detect, prepare for, and respond to Lassa fever outbreaks, including implementing a Lassa fever research plan and other control strategies.'\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Although the emergency phase of this year's (2019's) outbreak has been declared over, new cases continue to occur. As the above comment indicated, there has been a peak in case numbers between weeks 1 and 11 over the past 3 years. Although Nigeria is reaching the end of the usual transmission period of January-June, cases can be expected to occur sporadically for the remainder of this year (2019). Avoidance of contact with reservoir rodents and their excrement will be essential to reduce cases of Lassa fever. Continuing public education will be required to accomplish this goal.

Genomic Analysis of Lassa Virus during an Increase in Cases in Nigeria in 2018.\n\nSummary\nDuring 2018, an unusual increase in Lassa fever cases occurred in Nigeria, raising concern among national and international public health agencies. We analyzed 220 Lassa virus genomes from infected patients, including 129 from the 2017-2018 transmission season, to understand the viral populations underpinning the increase. A total of 14 initial genomes from 2018 samples were generated at Redeemer's University in Nigeria, and the findings were shared with the Nigerian Center for Disease Control in real time. We found that the increase in cases was not attributable to a particular Lassa virus strain or sustained by human-to-human transmission. Instead, the data were consistent with ongoing cross-species transmission from local rodent populations. Phylogenetic analysis also revealed extensive viral diversity that was structured according to geography, with major rivers appearing to act as barriers to migration of the rodent reservoir.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n[These findings support epidemiological observations that the vast majority of these cases during this outbreak were the result of Lassa fever virus transmission as spill-over from rodent reservoir hosts and not person to person transmission, except for the small number of cases within health care facilities.

Risk communication and sensitization have also been ongoing in all LGAs to increase awareness and promote positive behavioral practices to prevent further spread of the disease.'\n\nThe commissioner said that a response team from the NCDC and another team from Medicines San Frontiers are currently working with the state team to strengthen the response.\n\n[Byline: Ogochukwu Anioke]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Lassa fever virus transmission is active currently in Ebonyi state, with 19 confirmed cases and 3 deaths so far this year [2019]. It is encouraging that 14 of these patients have recovered enough to have been discharged from the hospital. Transmission of Lassa fever virus occurs when individuals are in contact with rodent reservoir hosts' excreta or are within healthcare facilities. Community involvement to reduce exposure to the rodent host is a challenge, given that cases have occurred in 8 of the state's 13 local government areas.

Although the outbreak had been reported in border cities of the northern senatorial district of the state, such as Edo and Kogi, sources at the FMC in Owo area told our correspondent that many victims are hospitalised in the centre.\n\nOne of the sources, who preferred not to be named, revealed that the current situation at FMC was getting out of control, adding that isolation wards of the hospital could no longer contain the patients due to lack of bed spaces to quarantine them.\n\n'There is no bed space again for us to quarantine these set of people in the FMC Owo. What we're currently facing is quite beyond what anyone would ever imagine. Patients kept inside the isolation ward are those that have contracted Lassa fever, and most of the reported cases are from the border communities within Ose Local Government area of the state,' the source told SaharaReporters.\n\nAnother source at the state Ministry of Health also confirmed that the current situation in Ondo State was 'very terrible', and called for the declaration of a state of emergency in the state.\n\n'Apart from declaring the state of emergency in the health sector, all the schools within these affected communities should be shut down. We also expect the government too to begin an awareness campaign by taking it to market places, streets, churches, mosques and other public places,' he said.\n\nDr. Stephen Fagbemi, the Ondo State Epidemiologist, had said at a forum that the state should prepare for war against Lassa fever. He said about 27 states were affected with Lassa fever last year [2018] and Ondo and Edo topped the list as they accounted for about 80% of those affected.\n\nMeanwhile, as parts of efforts to curb the Lassa fever outbreak, the government on [Sun 3 Feb 2019] activated the Emergency Response Committee on Lassa fever. Sahara Reporters gathered that the Committee is chaired by Dr. Wahab Adegbenro, the Ondo State Commissioner for Health, and Mrs. Bola Akinyanmi as the secretary. The Committee has been charged with the mandate to ensure that Lassa fever is flushed out of the state within the shortest time. It is also saddled with the mission of embarking on campaigns, advocacy visits to royal fathers and religious leaders in order to identify an appropriate dump site for human wastes.\n\nMeanwhile, the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) in Ondo State has raised the alarm over the sudden outbreak of the Lassa fever in the state. Reverend Ayo Oladapo, the state CAN Chairman, said about 80 cases had been recorded and confirmed. In a statement sent to all heads of churches in the state, Oladapo urged Christians to be on the alert.\n\n'I have just been informed through representatives of the government that there is an outbreak of Lassa Fever in the state (Ondo). About 80 cases have been confirmed. All our churches should please sensitize their members to cover their foods properly and eradicate the existence of rats in their vicinities. Announcements should be made on pulpits and in all our services. May God deliver us all from all deadly diseases in Jesus' name.'\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Representative of the government (governmental agencies no specified) indicated via a lay spokesperson that there are about 80 Lassa fever cases, presumably in recent weeks this year (2019). The 27 Jan 2019 Nigeria CDC update indicated that there were 28 confirmed cases at that time; that would imply that there have been 52 new cases in the 8 days since that report was issued (see Lassa fever - West Africa (07): Nigeria 20190201.6290606).\n\nLocal leaders are prudent to advise the public to protect their food sources from rodents and to eliminate rodents in and around their houses.

A total of 12 cases have been reported among healthcare workers in 7 states - Edo (4), Ondo (3), Ebonyi (1), Enugu (1), Rivers (1), Bauchi (1) and Benue (1) including one death in Enugu.\n\nThe number of confirmed cases reported across Nigeria remains high. In week 6, 2019 (week ending 10 Feb 2019), 37 new confirmed cases including 10 deaths (case fatality ratio 27%) were reported from 9 states across Nigeria. The majority of cases were reported from Ondo (12) and Edo (10) states. The number of confirmed cases reported in week 6, 2019, represents a slight decrease compared to week 5 when 68 confirmed cases were reported (Figure 1).\n\nOf the 3746 contacts identified since January 2019, 2658 are still under follow-up while 1045 have completed 21 days of follow-up. As many as 60 contacts became symptomatic, of which 39 tested positive.\n\nA total 91 case-patients are currently in admission at treatment centers across the country.

National awareness was improved through the recently concluded international Lassa fever conference which took place from 16 -17 Jan 2019.\n\nWHO risk assessment\n-------------------\nLassa fever is a viral haemorrhagic fever that is transmitted to humans via contact with food or household items contaminated with rodent urine or faeces. Person-to-person infections and laboratory transmission can also occur. The overall case fatality rate is 1%; it is 15% among patients hospitalized with severe illness. There is currently no approved vaccine. Early supportive care with rehydration and symptomatic treatment improves survival.\n\nAlthough Lassa fever is known to be endemic in Nigeria with the peak season anticipated from December through June, the current increase in new confirmed cases and deaths should be monitored closely and addressed appropriately. Cases in neigbouring Benin and Togo potentially originating from Nigeria have been reported in previous years and therefore neighbouring countries should be monitored accordingly.\n\nWith 12 confirmed cases so far among healthcare workers, there is evidence of nosocomial transmission of the disease amidst reports of inadequate infection prevention and control (IPC) supplied in some health facilities and complacency on the part of health workers towards maintaining IPC measures.\n\nWHO advice\n----------\nPrevention of Lassa fever relies on community engagement and promoting hygienic conditions to discourage rodents from entering homes. In healthcare settings, staff should consistently implement standard infection prevention and control measures when caring for patients to prevent nosocomial infections. WHO continues to advice all countries in the Lassa fever belt on the need to enhance early detection and treatment of cases to reduce the case fatality rate as well as strengthen cross-border collaboration.\n\nWHO does not recommend any travel or trade restriction to Nigeria based on the currently available information.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Marianne Hopp\n\n[The WHO recommended community engagement is a challenge, given the broad geographical area in which cases are occurring. A proactive public education effort is required to encourage use of containers that prevent rodent access to food materials and blocking of entry points of the rodents into houses.\n\nInterestingly, although the WHO does not recommend travel restrictions, on 7 Feb 2019 the USA CDC has recommended taking precautions in its updated travel advisory for Nigeria due to the recent Lassa fever cases, stating, 'Travelers to Nigeria should avoid contact with rats, especially rat urine and feces, and take precautions to keep their accommodations clean and free of rodents. If you need to clean up after rodents, take the proper steps to avoid getting sick. Travelers should also wash hands often, and avoid contact with people who are sick. Travelers who develop fever or other serious symptoms of Lassa fever during or after their trip should see a doctor right away.

The commissioner said the 2 deaths were a result of late presentation.\n\n'One (of the victims) came from Enugu state. The deaths were due to late presentation; in fact, by the time the child came, he was already very bad, bleeding from different orifices, which is the terminal stage.

'The confirmed cases are 12; 5 have been treated and discharged, while 5 are on admission now and doing very well.'\n\nUmezuruike said the Virology Centre, which is the only centre for such in the entire southeast, has all the facilities to treat such diseases.\n\n'The truth is that our management in the virology centre has an almost 100% success rate because we have the dialysis machines; we have all the facilities to test immediately and confirm whether the person has Lassa fever or not.'\n\nHowever, he admonished residents and people of the region to always bring the suspected infected patients to the hospital on time so as to be able to save their lives.

The risk of infection is low but can occur if someone comes into contact with an infected person's blood or bodily fluids. Lassa fever cannot be spread through casual contact, including skin to skin contact, without exchange of bodily fluids. Those at highest-risk would be health care workers treating patients in facilities known to have Lassa fever and family members caring for infected patients.\n\nEarly diagnosis and supportive care are essential. One should consult a medical professional if he or she has been in direct contact with an infected person within the past 3 weeks and have symptoms of Lassa fever, which include: fever, chest, stomach or back pain, cough, vomiting, diarrhea, or mucosal bleeding.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Lassa fever virus is endemic in much of northwest Africa, including Benin, Togo, and Burkina Faso. There have been cases of Lassa fever in Togo as recently as 2017. In the 2017 report, health authorities in Togo implemented the following measures to respond to these Lassa fever cases, including:\n- deployment of rapid response teams to the affected areas for epidemiological investigation;\n- identification of contacts and follow-up;\n- strengthening of infection prevention and control measures in health facilities and briefing of health workers;\n- strengthening of cross border collaboration and information exchanges between Togo, Burkina, Mali, and Benin.\n\nIt seems odd that the case report above does not mention contact with rodent reservoirs of the virus or their excrement as a source of infection. Lassa fever virus is transmitted to humans from contact with food or household items contaminated with excreta of multimammate rats (_Mastomys_ spp), the reservoir host.

This followed the increase in the number of Lassa fever cases reported in states since the beginning of the year, the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control [NCDC] said.\n\nThis is coming on the heels of the Lassa Fever International Conference held in Abuja to mark 50th year anniversary of the discovery of the disease in the country.\n\nEach year, Lassa fever kills many and leaves most of its survivors with disability, often due to the side effects of the drugs they received. The viral disease is contracted from the feaces of the multimammate rat and often transmitted via human to human contact [particularly in the hospital environment].\n\nNCDC in a press statement released on [Tue 22 Jan 2019] said there has been an increase in the number of Lassa fever cases reported from many states across the country since the beginning of the year [2019]. Recent epidemiological data showed that this trend usually occurs during the dry season, between January and April. 'As of [13 Jan 2019], a total of 60 confirmed cases have been reported in 8 states,' NCDC said.\n\nEmergency Response\n------------------\nDeclaring an outbreak means the NCDC has activated an Emergency Operations Centre (EOC) to coordinate a response. The national EOC includes representatives from the World Health Organization (WHO), Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, Federal Ministry of Environment, US Centers for Disease Control, as well as other partners.\n\nThe Centre said in preparation for this year's [2019] emergency phase, the agency has been providing support to states including the provision of emergency supplies and deployment of Rapid Response Teams [RRT].\n\n'The RRTs will work with states in response coordination, contact tracing, case management, risk communication and strengthening infection prevention and control practices,' it stated. This, they said, has been going on since 2018 when Nigeria experienced the largest reported case of the outbreak since the history of the disease in the country.\n\nIn 2018, a total of 3498 suspected cases were reported from 23 states. Of these, 633 were confirmed positive, 20 probable and 2853 negative (not a case). Also in 2018, 171 deaths among the confirmed cases and 20 probable cases were reported making the case fatality rate in confirmed cases as high as 27%.\n\nThough the disease is more prevalent in Edo, Ondo and Ebonyi states, 20 other states recorded at least one confirmed case across 93 LGAs. They are Edo, Ondo, Bauchi, Nasarawa, Ebonyi, Anambra, Benue, Kogi, Imo, Plateau, Lagos, Taraba, Delta, Osun, Rivers, FCT, Gombe, Ekiti, Kaduna, Abia, Adamawa, Enugu and Kano.\n\n'Since the Lassa fever outbreak in 2018, NCDC has worked with states to ensure better preparedness and improved response. In the last year, guidelines have been revised, new data management tools have been developed and the laboratory network has been strengthened. Additionally, risk communications has been strengthened through radio, posters, flyers and social media,' it said. 'A national research plan has been developed, to enable its full integration into the outbreak response to gain a better understanding of the disease', NCDC said.\n\nImproved Diagnosis\n------------------\nA good development that came out from the 2018 outbreak was that researchers were able to improve on the diagnosis of Lassa fever in the country. Before then, Nigeria had struggled with the diagnosis of the disease as most of the samples were usually sent out of the country. But as of today, Nigeria now has 4 laboratories where Lassa fever can be quickly diagnosed without much ado.\n\nLassa fever is an acute viral haemorrhagic illness, transmitted to humans through contact with food or household items contaminated by infected rodents. Person-to-person transmission can also occur, particularly in hospital environment in the absence of adequate infection control measures. Health care workers in health facilities are particularly at risk of contracting the disease, especially where infection prevention and control procedures are not strictly adhered to.\n\nNCDC has advised members of the public to focus on prevention by practicing good personal hygiene and proper environmental sanitation. Effective measures include storing grain and other foodstuffs in rodent-proof containers, disposing of garbage far from the home, maintaining clean households, and other measures to discourage rodents from entering homes. Hand washing should be practiced frequently. The public is also advised to avoid bush burning.\n\nThe disease control agency also reminded health workers that Lassa fever presents initially like any other disease causing febrile illness such as malaria; and are advised to practice standard precautions at all times, and to maintain a high index of suspicion. Rapid Diagnostic Test (RDT) must be applied to all suspected cases of malaria, it said. When the RDT is negative, other causes of febrile illness including Lassa fever should be considered. Accurate diagnosis and prompt treatment increases the chances of survival.\n\nThe national guidelines for Infection Prevention and Control, as well as Lassa fever case management have been developed, and disseminated to states.\n\nNCDC has pledged to remain committed to supporting all states' public health teams to prevent and respond to public health threats.\n\n[Byline: Ayodamola Owoseye]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Nigeria has made significant progress over the past year in developing timely diagnosis, a critical step in surveillance, prompt treatment and protection of health care workers. Lassa fever remains a problem in Nigeria because the virus is endemic there.\n\nVirus transmission to humans occurs when people are in contact with the reservoir rodent host, the multimammate mouse (in the genus _Mastomys_) or its excreta. Rodent control has to be undertaken at the village level with individual households. This requires a major public education effort. Transmission also occurs in health facilities when personal protective equipment is not employed and barrier-nursing practices are not adequate to protect staff from blood and secretions of infected patients, as happened last year (2018). - Mod.TY]", "summary": "----------\n- In the reporting week 2 [7 - 13 Jan 2019] 35 new confirmed cases were reported from Edo (12), Ondo (12), Bauchi (3), FCT (1), Ebonyi (5), Plateau (1) and Taraba (1) States with 8 new deaths in Ondo (3), Edo (1), Ebonyi (1), Plateau (1) FCT (1) and Taraba (1).

This occurred in the period from 15-26 Dec 2018.\n\nIn the case of Cotonou, a 28-year-old (has been infected). His case was detected on 24 Dec [2018], but his illness commenced the previous week. He had a fever, a cough, a cold, and fatigue. Due to the persistence of the cough and cold, and with the appearance of traces of blood in nasal discharge on 24 Dec 2018, the alert was given.\n\nThe patient was placed in isolation on [Tue 25 Dec 2018], and on the morning of Wed 26 Dec 2018, his result from the laboratory came back positive [for Lassa fever].

According to the patient's statements, there is no known contact with rodents.\n\nTaking advantage of this opportunity, the minister reassured the public that public health measures are underway. He also reminded people of the behaviors that will help avoid becoming infected. This involves washing hands regularly with soap and water; avoiding contact with stool, sperm, urine, saliva, vomit, and contaminated objects from a person suspected to be ill or dead from Lassa; and protecting food and keeping it in a safe place, out of reach of rodents.\n\nIt should be recalled that 7 cases have been recorded since the beginning of the epidemic to date, including 5 positive cases.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[One case is located in Cotonou on the Benin coast and apparently was locally acquired, perhaps from contact with the rodent host or its excrement.

Genomic analysis of Lassa virus during an increase in cases in Nigeria in 2018.\n\nSummary\nDuring 2018, an unusual increase in Lassa fever cases occurred in Nigeria, raising concern among national and international public health agencies. We analyzed 220 Lassa virus genomes from infected patients, including 129 from the 2017 to 2018 transmission season, to understand the viral populations underpinning the increase. A total of 14 initial genomes from 2018 samples were generated at Redeemer's University in Nigeria, and the findings were shared with the Nigerian Center for Disease Control in real time. We found that the increase in cases was not attributable to a particular Lassa virus strain or sustained by human-to-human transmission. Instead, the data were consistent with ongoing cross-species transmission from local rodent populations. Phylogenetic analysis also revealed extensive viral diversity that was structured according to geography, with major rivers appearing to act as barriers to migration of the rodent reservoir.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The 2018 Lassa fever outbreak in Nigeria has been widespread geographically. According to the Nigerian Center for Disease Control, 22 states have recorded at least one confirmed case across 72 local councils. The center reported that 39 healthcare workers have been affected since the onset of the outbreak in 7 states -- Ebonyi (16), Edo (14), Ondo (4), Kogi (2), Nasarawa (1), Taraba (1) and Abia (1), with 10 deaths in Ebonyi (6), Kogi (1), Abia (1), Ondo (1) and Edo (1).\n\nExcept for the infected healthcare workers, most affected individuals probably acquired their infections from rodent hosts of the virus. It would be interesting to know whether the prevalence of Lassa fever virus has been increasing in populations of rodent hosts in this wide area. Virus transmission to humans occurs when people are in contact with the reservoir rodent host, the multimammate mouse (_Mastomys natalensis_ and _Mastomys erythroleucus_) and the African wood mouse (_Hylomycus pamfi_) or their excreta, as was likely the situation in these cases. Rodent control must be undertaken at the village level with individual households using preventive measures.

In week 25 (week ending 26 Jun 2018), 2 new confirmed Lassa fever cases were reported in Nimba County, the only county with active transmission currently. Nimba County has reported 5 confirmed Lassa fever cases since [12 May 2018]. In the latest event (the 2 confirmed cases in week 25), the 1st case-patient, a 59-year- old male from Gbehlay Geh district, fell ill on [4 Jun 2018] and was treated with antimalarials and antibiotics at a local clinic. On [20 Jun 2018], the case-patient presented to a public hospital with fever and other constitutional symptoms, and had bleeding from a venepuncture site. On [21 Jun 2018], a blood specimen was collected and sent to the National Public Health Reference Laboratory (NPHRL). The test result released on [26 Jun 2018] was positive for Lassa fever virus infection. The 2nd case-patient, a 41-year-old female, is the wife of the first case-patient (described above). She developed illness on [17 Jun 2018] and was admitted to the same hospital on [20 June 2018] with fever and other constitutional symptoms. Being a known contact, a blood specimen was collected on [21 Jun 2018] and the test result released on [26 Jun 2018] was positive for Lassa fever. The 2 case-patients are admitted under barrier nursing and ribavirin treatment initiated. A total of 26 contacts, including 13 health workers, have been line listed and are being followed up.\n\nBetween [1 Jan 2018] and [27 Jun 2018], a total of 130 suspected Lassa fever cases, including 33 deaths, were reported. Of these, 20 cases were laboratory confirmed, 103 were discarded (after testing negative), and 7 cases were not tested due to inadequate specimens. Of the 20 confirmed cases, 14 have died, giving a case fatality rate of 70 percent. Females make up 60 percent (12) of the confirmed cases. The age range for the confirmed cases is 1 to 65 years old, with a median of 32.5 years. The confirmed cases are from 5 counties, namely (Nimba (9), Bong (4), Montserrado (3), Margibi (2), and Grand Bassa (2).\n\nPublic Health Actions\n---------------------\n- The Ministry of Health and the National Public Health Institute of Liberia (NPHIL) are coordinating response activities to the Lassa fever outbreak, with support from WHO, CDC and other partners. The national epidemic preparedness and response committee (NEPRC), under the leadership of NPHIL, have been meeting weekly to review the Lassa fever outbreak situation and provide technical support to sub-national level, with technical support from WHO, and US-CDC; 15 WHO field offices are providing technical and operational support to the response.\n- Active surveillance, including case search, case investigation and contact tracing are ongoing in the affected districts. A specimen transport system using couriers is available at designated points across the country to transport specimens to the NPHRL for testing.\n- The Ganta United Methodist Hospital has been designated as a treatment centre, and equipped with ribavirin and other medical supplies for case management. Orientation of healthcare workers on case management protocol is ongoing.\n- Healthcare workers in the country are being trained on Lassa fever case management and infection prevention and control (IPC) measures by NPHIL and MOH, with support from WHO.\n- Health workers' exposure risk assessment is planned to be conducted in the clinic or hospital where the confirmed cases sought care.\n- Community engagement activities are ongoing in the affected communities, including home visits and providing information on environmental cleanliness.\n\nSituation Interpretation\n------------------------\nSporadic Lassa fever cases continue to occur in certain parts of Liberia where the disease is known to be endemic. Bong, Grand Bassa, Margibi, and Nimba are among the counties that report cases annually. In 2017, a total of 30 confirmed cases were reported from 7 counties. The reason for these sporadic cases is known: the constant interaction of rats (the vector for Lassa fever virus) and people in unsanitary conditions. The national authorities and partners need to prioritize measures mitigating this exposure risk factor by improving vector and environmental management components of the response.

Between 1 Jan 2018 and 27 Jun 2018, 20 cases were laboratory confirmed, up from 18 cases on 1 Jun 2018. Apparently, all these Lassa fever virus infections were acquired by contact with infected rodents or their excretions. Lassa fever virus can be acquired from infected rodents or patients in the hospital but in the above report, there is no mention of Lassa fever virus nosocomial transmission. Transmission can occur in health facilities when personal protective equipment is not employed and barrier-nursing practices are not adequate to protect staff from blood and secretions of infected patients. The hospitals attending the patients mentioned above do have barrier measures in place.\n\nAs mentioned in previous posts, Lassa fever virus transmission to humans occur when people are in contact with the reservoir rodent host, the multimammate mouse (_Mastomys natalensis_ and _M. erythroleucus_) and the African wood mouse (_Hylomycus pamfi_) or their excreta, as was likely the situation in these cases.

Lessons Learnt from Epidemiological Investigation of Lassa Fever Outbreak in a Southwest State of Nigeria December 2015 to April 2016.\n-------------------------------\nAbstract\nIntroduction: An outbreak of Lassa fever (LF) reported and confirmed in Ondo state, Southwest Nigeria in January 2016 was investigated. This paper provides the epidemiology of the LF and lessons learnt from the investigation of the outbreak.\n\nMethods: The incidence management system (IMS) model was used for the outbreak coordination. Cases and deaths were identified through the routine surveillance system using standard definitions for suspected and confirmed cases and deaths respectively. Blood specimens collected from suspect cases were sent for confirmation at a WHO accredited laboratory. Active case search was intensified, and identified contacts of confirmed cases were followed up for the maximum incubation period of the disease. Other public health responses included infection prevention and control, communication and advocacy as well as case management. Data collected were analysed using SPSS 20, by time, place and persons and important lessons drawn were discussed.\n\nResults: We identified 90 suspected LF cases of which 19 were confirmed by the laboratory. More than half (52.6 percent) of the confirmed cases were females with a majority (73.7 percent) in the age group of 15 years and older. The case fatality rate (CFR) of 63.2 percent among the laboratory-confirmed positive cases, where 9 of 19 cases died, was significantly higher compared to the laboratory confirmed negative cases, where 6 of the 65 cases died (CFR; 8.5 percent) p 0.05 and under. There were 287 contacts of the confirmed cases identified, out of which 267 (93.0 percent) completed the follow-up without developing any symptoms, and 2 (0.7 percent) developed symptoms consistent with LF and were confirmed by the laboratory. More than half of the contacts were females (64.5 percent) with most of them (89.2 percent) in the age group of 25 years and older.\n\nDiscussion: One key lesson learnt from the investigation was that the confirmed cases were mainly primary cases; hence the need to focus on measures of breaking the chain of transmission in the animal-human interface during Lassa fever epidemic preparedness and response. In addition, the high case fatality rate despite early reporting and investigation suggested the need for a review of the case management policy and structure in the state.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n[Interestingly, this study did not find any instances of nosocomial transmission, although there have been cases involving health care workers in other localities in Nigeria this year (2018). Since there were only 2 instances of contact transmission, one of the major conclusions of the study is the need to break the chain of transmission from infected animals (the rodent reservoir) to humans as the main source of exposure to Lassa fever virus. Virus transmission to humans occurs when people are in contact with the reservoir rodent host, the multimammate mouse (_Mastomys natalensis_ and _M. erythroleucus_) and the African wood mouse (_Hylomycus pamfi_) or their excreta, as was likely the situation in these cases.

In 2017, in Kenema District, the Lassa Fever Unit recorded 17 cases and 11 died. From January to May 2018, 18 cases have been recorded and 7 have died. He said the unit is expecting more cases.\n\nKanneh attributed the high rate of death to delayed arrival at the hospital. He said people continue to self-medicate, visit 'quack' doctors or engage in traditional remedies, and they arrive at the hospital half dead. Kanneh said lassa fever is an infectious disease that can affect anyone, all tribes, old and young, male and female. The disease is caused by a small germ, invisible to the naked eye, called the Lassa virus. Like other diseases, Lassa fever can present differently; some people will become slightly ill but others will die from the disease.\n\nLassa fever was discovered in Sierra Leone in 1972 in Panguma in the Lower Bambara chiefdom, Kenema district. It has been discovered in other parts of the country including Koinadugu, Tonkolili and Bombali districts with the exception of Western Area. Presently, it is prevalent in Dodo, Nongowa and Lower Bambara chiefdoms.\n\nLassa fever is spread by rats and you can also get lassa fever from someone who already has the disease or someone who has recently had the disease. 'You can get Lassa fever if you leave your food or water uncovered, so a rat can urinate [or defacate] in it, and then you eat this food,' he said.\n\nLassa fever can be prevented by keeping your compound clean and clear of bush to deter rats. Dispose of garbage correctly, away from the house. Do not leave food lying on the floor. Keep food and water covered to prevent contamination by rats. Trap rats, but do not touch dead rats with your bare hands. Use a shovel, stick or plastic. Keep a cat at home to keep away rats.\n\n[byline: Saffa B Moriba]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Lassa fever virus (LFV) is endemic in West Africa, but ProMED-mail has not posted reports of cases in Sierra Leone since 2013.

The high death rate is alarming to NPHIL, which has launched an in-depth investigation.\n\nThe release also discloses that although Lassa fever is not new to Liberia, it is a deadly viral disease that requires urgent attention. The disease is spread by rodents (rats) through close contact with affected persons [or contaminated environments - Mod.TY].\n\nPeople are advised to keep their environment clean: cover dishes to prevent rats from defecating or urinating on them; cover food in tightly closed containers to prevent rats from playing in food or drinking water; do not eat rats because you can get the sickness by coming into contact with their blood, urine or feces, and do not dry food in open places where rats can reach.\n\nOther preventive measures are to avoid body contact with affected persons and endemic zones; visit a health facility immediately when you feel sick.\n\nMeanwhile, NPHIL, MOH, and partners have appealed to the general public to take the necessary preventive measures, and to kindly report cases of fever to the nearest health facility.\n\n'We continue to improve our rapid response at the county, district and community levels through the County Emergency Operation Centers, and to provide technical, financial and logistical support to the outbreaks, the release concluded.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The number of confirmed Lassa fever cases in Liberia has increased somewhat since 1 Jun 2018, from 13 to 18 cases.\n\nLassa fever virus can be acquired from infected rodents or patients in the hospital.

Of these, 2 new confirmed cases were reported in week 12 and week 13 (week ending 1 Apr 2018).\n\nThe patient reported in week 12 [week ending 25 Mar 2018] was a 2-year-old female with symptom onset on 22 Mar 2018, who was admitted to hospital in the capital city, Monrovia on 29 Mar 2018 with symptoms of fever, malaise, vomiting, difficulty in breathing and later, convulsions. Clinical suspicion was Lassa fever [virus] infection and following collection of a blood sample on 29 Mar 2018 the patient tested positive for Lassa fever virus by RT-PCR at the National Reference Laboratory. The patient died on the day of admission and a safe burial was conducted.\n\nA retrospective investigation was conducted which established that the mother, a 33-year-old from Grand Bassa county died on 22 Mar 2018. She sought care at the district hospital on 18 Mar 2018 where the clinician suspected a viral haemorrhagic fever and isolated her. Following a negative test for Ebola virus on 20 Mar 2018, a positive RT-PCR result for Lassa virus was received on 30 Mar 2018. A total of 47 contacts from these 2 confirmed cases were identified, of which 60 percent are healthcare workers and are under follow up.\n\nFrom January 2018 to date, a total of 67 suspected cases, including 19 deaths (case fatality rate 28.3 percent) have been reported from 6 counties. Of the total suspected cases, 9 were confirmed positive by RT-PCR at the National Reference Laboratory. The confirmed cases originated from Nimba (4 cases), Montserrado (3), Bong (1), and Grand Bassa (1); 8 of the 9 confirmed cases died, a case fatality rate of 89 percent. The confirmed cases are predominately female (78 percent) and the age range among confirmed cases is 1 to 57 years old with a median age of 32 years.\n\nPublic health actions\n---------------------\n- The county health team continues to coordinate the response to the outbreak, with technical support from the Ministry of Health, the National Public Health Institute of Liberia (NPHIL), WHO field offices, MSF [M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res], and OXFAM.\n- Active surveillance and contact tracing are ongoing in the affected counties, who are sharing information to aid investigation and contact tracing.\n- The outbreak case definitions, along with patient screening tools which were adapted for previous outbreaks, remain in use.\n- The National Public Health Reference Laboratory continues to provide laboratory diagnostic services and courier services have been strategically designated across the country to facilitate transport of specimens.\n- An infectious disease isolation unit has been set up in Montserrado county to manage patients with Lassa fever.\n- Lassa fever risk exposure assessment was conducted by a team of infection, prevention, and control (IPC) specialists with respect to healthcare worker contacts in Montserrado and the MSF hospital has initiated chemoprophylaxis (oral ribavirin) for the high-risk contacts.\n- Community engagement activities have begun in the affected communities with rapid response teams visiting the affected households and families, and providing information on the event.\n- Antiviral medication (ribavirin) has been prepositioned at designated treatment sites to facilitate management of future cases.\n\nSituation interpretation\n------------------------\nLassa fever is endemic in certain parts of Liberia, with sporadic outbreaks during 2017, resulting in 30 confirmed cases reported from 7 counties. This year shows a similar pattern, with 9 confirmed cases to date from 4 counties. Although the Liberian government together with WHO and other health partners has built on lessons learned from response to previous outbreaks, more effort is needed to reinforce the response plan to prevent new cases and decrease the case fatality rate. As well as preventing human-to-human transmission through effective IPC practices, rat-to-human transmission needs to be minimized, requiring a One Health approach, which will entail effective social mobilization and community engagement strategies targeting vector control and environmental management especially in endemic areas. The fact that such a high proportion of contacts were healthcare workers emphasizes the need for continuing logistical and operational support to healthcare facilities to build effective isolation units, holding areas and clinical waste management disposal systems as well as ongoing training to reduce the risk of infection of healthcare workers.\n\n[Map -- available at the source URL above] Geographical distribution of Lassa fever cases in Liberia, 30 Dec 2017-8 Apr 2018\n[Graph -- available at the source URL above] Epidemiological curve of Lassa fever cases in Liberia, 30 Dec 2017-8 Apr 2018\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The number of confirmed Lassa fever cases in Liberia has increased by 5 cases since the last report on 22 Mar 2018 with the total currently at 19. Liberia, a West African country, is endemic for Lassa virus. Lassa fever cases have been reported sporadically there. The Lassa fever belt in Liberia primarily occupies Lofa, Bong, and Nimba counties across the northern tier of counties bordering Guinea. West Africa, including Guinea and Liberia, is endemic for Lassa fever virus.\n\nThe situation where these people acquired Lassa fever virus is not indicated in these cases except for the 2-year-old girl, who likely got the virus from her infected mother.

Rodent control has to be undertaken at the village level with individual households employing the preventive measures listed above. This requires an extensive and continuous public education effort.

From late-February to early March [2018], there has been a downward trend in the weekly reported number of Lassa fever cases with less than 20 cases reported each week in March 2018 and only 5 new cases reported in the week ending 15 Apr 2018 (Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1: Number of confirmed and probable Lassa fever cases in Nigeria reported by the week of illness onset from 1 Jan through 15 Apr 2018.\n\nLassa fever case management centres are operational in 3 states (Ebonyi, Edo, and Ondo States). The health care workers working in these centres are trained in standard infection prevention and control (IPC) as well as in the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) and case management. In addition, the suspected cases and deaths reported in community settings are being actively investigated by the field teams, and contacts are being followed up.\n\nCurrently, 3 laboratories at Abuja, Irrua and Lagos are operational and testing samples for Lassa fever by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Phylogenetic analysis of 49 viruses detected during the 2018 outbreak, provided through ongoing collaborations between Irrua Specialist Teaching Hospital, Bernhard Nocht Institute of Tropical Medicine, African Center of Excellence for Genomics of Infectious Disease (ACEGID), and Redeemer's University, has shown evidence of multiple, independent introductions of different viruses and viruses similar to previously circulating lineages identified in Nigeria. This is indicative that the main mode of transmission is through spillover from the rodent population, and limited human to human transmission.\n\nWHO continues to directly support the outbreak response and coordinate international assistance through the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN), mainly in the domains of enhanced surveillance and case investigation, contact tracing, strengthening of diagnostic capacity, case management, IPC and risk communication.\n\nIn addition, WHO continues to work on standardizing treatment guidance across all treatment centres and on standardization of the reporting and laboratory investigation.\n\nLassa fever is endemic in the West African countries of Ghana, Guinea, Mali, Benin, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Togo and Nigeria.\n\nPublic health response:\n- A national Lassa fever Emergency Operations Centre (EOC) was activated in Abuja by Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) on 22 Jan [2018] and continues to coordinate response activities in collaboration with WHO and other partners.\n\n- A comprehensive incident action plan has been developed to guide response activities and inform priority areas for collaboration with partners and resource mobilization. This plan has just been reviewed and updated, taking into consideration the current disease epidemiology.\n\n- A team of NCDC staff, WHO and Nigeria Field Epidemiology and Laboratory Training Program (NFELTP) residents were deployed initially to respond to the Ebonyi, Ondo, and Edo outbreaks, and more recently also to Abia state. State level EOCs have also been created.\n\n- The 3 most affected states of Edo, Ondo and Ebonyi have dedicated Lassa fever treatment units, and intravenous ribavirin is available for treatment of confirmed cases.\n\n- NCDC is collaborating with a non-governmental organization, the Alliance for International Medical Action (ALIMA), to support the treatment centres in Owo and Irrua; and with M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF) to support IPC interventions (PPE and training) in Abakaliki. WHO case management/IPC team has provided training to medical staff at Abakaliki and Irrrua.\n\n- Enhanced surveillance is ongoing in states with an active outbreak and state line lists of cases are being uploaded to a national level database, a viral haemorrhagic fever management system.\n\n- NCDC, with WHO support, continues to supply PPE to all Lassa fever treatment centres.\n\n- Staffs from Irrua Specialist Teaching Hospital are providing clinical case management advice to other hospitals with suspected cases, and a 24-hour Lassa fever case management call line has been established. A Lassa fever committee has been established in Abakaliki to improve the care of patients affected by Lassa fever.\n\n- NCDC has deployed risk communication and community engagement teams to Edo, Ondo and Ebonyi to promote personal and community hygiene, and appropriate health seeking behaviour. Mechanisms are being set up to better understand and respond to community concerns.\n\nLassa fever is a viral haemorrhagic fever that is transmitted to humans via contact with food or household items contaminated with rodent urine or faeces. Person-to-person infections and laboratory transmission can also occur when there is unprotected contact with blood or bodily fluids. Although the overall case fatality rate is 1 percent in all patients with Lassa fever (when asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic patients are included), mortality has been reported to be as high as 20 percent or higher among patients hospitalized with severe illness. Early supportive care with rehydration and ribavirin treatment improves survival. There is no evidence to support the role of ribavirin as post-exposure prophylactic treatment for Lassa fever, except for high-risk contacts. Lassa fever is known to be endemic in Nigeria, Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone and evidence of Lassa fever infection has been reported in Benin, Ghana, Mali, and Togo, and most likely exists in other West African countries.\n\nThe current Lassa fever outbreak in Nigeria shows a decreasing trend in the number of cases and deaths in the most recent 4 weeks. This declining trend needs to be interpreted with caution as historical data shows that the high transmission period has not passed. The surveillance system has recently been strengthened. This is the largest outbreak of Lassa fever ever reported in Nigeria.\n\nThe infection of 27 health care workers highlights the crucial need to strengthen infection prevention and control practices in all health care setting for all patients, regardless of their presumed diagnosis.\n\nThe reporting of confirmed cases in different parts of the country and at borders with neighbouring countries indicate a risk of possible spread nationally and to neighbouring countries. An overall moderate level of risk remains at the regional level. Public health actions should be focused on enhancing ongoing activities including surveillance, contact tracing, laboratory testing, and case management.\n\nPrevention of Lassa fever relies on community engagement and promoting hygienic conditions to discourage rodents from entering homes. In healthcare settings, staff should consistently implement standard infection prevention and control measures when caring for patients to prevent nosocomial spread of infections.\n\nTravellers from areas where Lassa fever is endemic can export the disease to other countries, although this rarely occurs. The diagnosis of Lassa fever should be considered in febrile patients returning from West Africa, especially if they have been in rural areas or hospitals in countries where Lassa fever is endemic. Health care workers seeing a patient suspected to have Lassa fever should immediately contact local and national experts for guidance and to arrange for laboratory testing and use appropriate infection and control measures.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[It is reassuring to learn that the incidence of Lassa fever cases is declining. The warning above that the outbreak may not continue to decline is prudent, since the usual period for Lassa fever occurrence lasts into June. The response to this, the largest Lassa fever outbreak ever in Nigeria, is commendable. The Nigeria Ministry of Health has proactively responded to the outbreak with considerable help from several international organizations.\n\nThe report above cites studies that indicate that most cases result from spill-over from Lassa fever virus infected rodents. Unfortunately, there are no reports of parallel studies of occurrence of the virus in rodent populations. The occurrence of so many human cases over a wide geographic area suggests that a major epizootic of Lassa fever virus in the rodents has been occurring. Given the urgency of finding and treating human cases and following up with their contacts, it is understandable that any studies of infection dynamics in rodent hosts would be a low priority.\n\nWHO teams and personnel from the Ministry of Health began engaging with communities at risk of infection. The villages and towns are scattered over a large geographical area. Getting local people to understand that virus transmission to humans occurs when people are in contact with the reservoir rodent host, the multimammate mouse (in the genus _Mastomys_) or its excreta can be difficult. Preventing this contact requires understanding that leads to action. Rodent control has to be undertaken at the village level with individual households. This requires an extensive and continuous public education effort.\n\nLassa fever remains a problem in Nigeria because the virus is endemic there. Transmission of the virus also occurs in health facilities when personal protective equipment is not employed and barrier-nursing practices are not adequate to protect staff from blood and secretions of infected patients. Although no vaccine is available, Ribavirin has been used to successfully treat patients and is most effective if the patient is treated early in the course of infection.\n\nImages of the _Mastomys_ mouse, the rodent reservoir of Lassa fever virus, can be seen at https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/45326-Mastomys-natalensis.\n\nMaps of Nigeria: http://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/map/profile/nigeria.pdf and http://healthmap.org/promed/p/62. - Mod.TY]", "summary": "From late-February to early March [2018], there has been a downward trend in the weekly reported number of Lassa fever cases with less than 20 cases reported each week in March 2018 and only 5 new cases reported in the week ending 15 Apr 2018 (Figure 1). TY]\n\nFrom the beginning of the outbreak in January 2018 to the week ending 18 Feb [2018], the number of weekly reported Lassa fever cases increased from 10 to 70 cases. \n\nPublic health response:\n- A national Lassa fever Emergency Operations Centre (EOC) was activated in Abuja by Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) on 22 Jan [2018] and continues to coordinate response activities in collaboration with WHO and other partners. \n\n- Enhanced surveillance is ongoing in states with an active outbreak and state line lists of cases are being uploaded to a national level database, a viral haemorrhagic fever management system. \n\nWHO continues to directly support the outbreak response and coordinate international assistance through the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN), mainly in the domains of enhanced surveillance and case investigation, contact tracing, strengthening of diagnostic capacity, case management, IPC and risk communication. \n\n- Staffs from Irrua Specialist Teaching Hospital are providing clinical case management advice to other hospitals with suspected cases, and a 24-hour Lassa fever case management call line has been established. \n\nFigure 1: Number of confirmed and probable Lassa fever cases in Nigeria reported by the week of illness onset from 1 Jan through 15 Apr 2018. \n\nLassa fever is a viral haemorrhagic fever that is transmitted to humans via contact with food or household items contaminated with rodent urine or faeces. Communicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[It is reassuring to learn that the incidence of Lassa fever cases is declining. Although the overall case fatality rate is 1 percent in all patients with Lassa fever (when asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic patients are included), mortality has been reported to be as high as 20 percent or higher among patients hospitalized with severe illness. Lassa fever is known to be endemic in Nigeria, Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone and evidence of Lassa fever infection has been reported in Benin, Ghana, Mali, and Togo, and most likely exists in other West African countries. The diagnosis of Lassa fever should be considered in febrile patients returning from West Africa, especially if they have been in rural areas or hospitals in countries where Lassa fever is endemic. Health care workers seeing a patient suspected to have Lassa fever should immediately contact local and national experts for guidance and to arrange for laboratory testing and use appropriate infection and control measures. \n\nLassa fever case management centres are operational in 3 states (Ebonyi, Edo, and Ondo States). A ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n A Lassa fever committee has been established in Abakaliki to improve the care of patients affected by Lassa fever. \n\n- NCDC, with WHO support, continues to supply PPE to all Lassa fever treatment centres. The 3 most affected states of Edo, Ondo and Ebonyi have dedicated Lassa fever treatment units, and intravenous ribavirin is available for treatment of confirmed cases. \n\nTravellers from areas where Lassa fever is endemic can export the disease to other countries, although this rarely occurs. \n\nPrevention of Lassa fever relies on community engagement and promoting hygienic conditions to discourage rodents from entering homes. \n\nImages of the _Mastomys_ mouse, the rodent reservoir of Lassa fever virus, can be seen at https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/45326-Mastomys-natalensis. \n\nLassa fever remains a problem in Nigeria because the virus is endemic there.

According to a family source, the woman, who died at about 6 a.m on Monday morning was rushed to a private hospital in Minna when she started vomiting and stooling blood and emitting blood from her nostrils.\n\nA source told The Nation that the hospital, after testing her, referred her to the Ibrahim Badamosi Babangida Specialist Hospital, but the parents refused taking her to the hospital and took her home, where she died.\n\n'What made us suspicious,' the source said, 'was when some officials from the Ministry of Health came to the house, the hospital must have told them. When they came, R was already dead, so they had for the people who were going to bury her some protective surgical suits to put on, and they sprayed the body, the car that carried her to the hospital, and all 4 in the house. This was after testing her.'\n\nThe source said that for about a week, the deceased, who had 6 children, had been complaining of sore throat and body pains, 'but she got worse yesterday. She was taken to the General Hospital Minna, but there was no doctor on the grounds to attend to her; that was why she was taken to the private hospital. However, after admitting her, one of the doctors tested her and said she had been referred to IBB Hospital.'\n\nWhen The Nation visited the private hospital, one of the doctors who spoke anonymously confirmed that a woman was brought to the hospital with suspected Lassa fever symptoms, and, because they could not handle her, the hospital referred her to the IBB Specialist Hospital.\n\nHe also confirmed that the management called the state Ministry of Health to inform them of their suspicions. 'The lady did not die in our hospital. When we noticed we could not handle her case, we referred her to IBB Specialist Hospital. So, whether they went or not, we do not know. I am just hearing that she died from you.'\n\nHowever, efforts to reach the Niger State Ministry of Health failed. Although our reporter met with the Permanent Secretary, Dr. Makunsidi, he denied knowledge of any case as such, saying he had not been informed. He, however, promised to make enquiries and get back to the reporter.

No large-scale studies exist from Nigeria, where the Lassa virus (LASV) is most diverse. LASV diversity, coupled with host genetic and environmental factors, might cause differences in disease pathophysiology. Small-scale studies in Nigeria suggest that acute kidney injury is an important clinical feature and might be a determinant of survival. We aimed to establish the demographic, clinical, and laboratory factors associated with mortality in Nigerian patients with Lassa fever, and hypothesised that LASV was the direct cause of intrinsic renal damage for a subset of the patients with Lassa fever.\n\nMethods\nWe did a retrospective, observational cohort study of consecutive patients in Nigeria with Lassa fever, who tested positive for LASV with RT-PCR, and were treated in Irrua Specialist Teaching Hospital. We did univariate and multivariate statistical analyses, including logistic regression, of all demographic, clinical, and laboratory variables available at presentation to identify the factors associated with patient mortality.\n\nFindings\nOf 291 patients treated in Irrua Specialist Teaching Hospital between 3 Jan 2011, and 11 Dec 2015, 284 (98 percent) had known outcomes (died or survived) and 7 (2 percent) were discharged against medical advice. Overall case-fatality rate was 24 percent (68 of 284 patients), with a 1.4 times increase in mortality risk for each 10 years of age (p=0\u00b700017), reaching 39 percent (22 of 57) for patients older than 50 years. Of 284 patients, 81 (28 percent) had acute kidney injury and 104 (37 percent) had CNS manifestations and thus both were considered important complications of acute Lassa fever in Nigeria. Acute kidney injury was strongly associated with poor outcome (case-fatality rate of 60 percent [49 of 81 patients]; ratio [OR] 15, p less than 0.00001). Compared with patients without acute kidney injury, those with acute kidney injury had higher incidence of proteinuria (32 [82 percent] of 39 patients) and haematuria (29 [76 percent] of 38) and higher mean serum potassium (4.63 [SD 1.04] mmol/L) and lower blood urea nitrogen to creatinine ratio (8.6 for patients without clinical history of fluid loss), suggesting intrinsic renal damage. Normalisation of creatinine concentration was associated with recovery. Elevated serum creatinine (OR 1.3; p=0\u00b7046), aspartate aminotransferase (OR 1.5; p=0.075), and potassium (OR 3.6; p=0.0024) were independent predictors of death.\n\nInterpretation\nOur study presents detailed clinical and laboratory data for Nigerian patients with Lassa fever and provides strong evidence for intrinsic renal dysfunction in acute Lassa fever. Early recognition and treatment of acute kidney injury might significantly reduce mortality.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n[This study indicates that Lassa fever likely induces acute renal dysfunction in a significant portion of patients and is an indicator of progression to mortality.

The 3 cases have undergone safe and dignified burials, and the county health teams are conducting contact tracing on both healthcare workers and community members who had high-risk (i.e. direct) contact with the patients during their symptomatic periods.\n\nNo epidemiological link has been established between the 3 confirmed cases that died. A total of 134 contacts have been identified and are currently being followed-up (Montserrado 105, Margibi 25 and Nimba 4) inclusive of 37 healthcare workers. As of 7 Mar 2018, no new confirmed Lassa fever cases have been reported.\n\nSince 1 Jan 2018, a total of 28 suspected cases of Lassa fever have been reported across Liberia, including 12 deaths. Of these, 7 cases have been confirmed by the National Public Health Reference Laboratory: Nimba (4), Montserrado (2) and Bong (1).\n\nLassa fever is a viral hemorrhagic illness caused by a virus that is transmitted through contact with the urine or feces of infected rodents and through direct contact with body fluids of symptomatic human cases. In recent years, a consistently increasing trend in the number of Lassa fever cases has been observed in Liberia and other countries across West Africa. This includes Nigeria, where an ongoing outbreak has led to 353 confirmed cases with 78 confirmed and 8 probable deaths since 1 Jan 2018.\n\nSymptoms of Lassa fever include vomiting, respiratory distress, chest pain, hiccups, and unexplained bleeding.\n\nPublic Health action taken by the National Public Health Institute of Liberia, Ministry of Health and partners are:\n\n- Ensuring that all counties are aware of and prepared for handling any additional Lassa fever cases;\n- Disseminating health promotion messages about the signs and symptoms of Lassa fever;\n- Re-training Redemption Hospital staff in Lassa fever case management and safe handling of cases;\n- Adapting case definition and screening tools and conducting surveillance and contact tracing in affected counties.\n\nAn effective treatment called ribavirin is available in the country for Lassa fever and should start as early as possible following symptomatic onset. Therefore, visiting a health facility immediately upon detection of any of the symptoms is critical to both preventing spread of the disease and ensuring safe recovery of the case.\n\nLassa fever can be prevented by doing the following:\n- Keep your home and surroundings clean to keep rats from entering the home.\n- Cover your food and drinking water to stop rats from playing in them.\n- Dispose of garbage correctly and away from the home.\n- Always wash your hands with soap and water.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Evidently, there have been several cases of Lassa fever in Liberia this year (2018). A previous report of a Lassa fever case in Ghana ex Liberia in February 2018 indicated that the infection was acquired in Guinea. Liberia, also a West African country, is endemic for Lassa virus. Lassa fever cases have been reported sporadically there. The Lassa fever belt in Liberia primarily occupies Lofa, Bong and Nimba counties across the northern tier of counties bordering Guinea. West Africa, including Guinea and Liberia, is endemic for Lassa fever virus.\n\nThe situation where these people acquired Lassa fever virus is not indicated in these cases. Virus transmission to humans occurs when people are in contact with the reservoir rodent host, the multimammate mouse (in the genus _Mastomys_) or its excreta, as was likely the situation in these cases.

He, however, stressed that there was no cause for alarm, noting that the state government was taking proactive steps in surveillance activities that would involve all residents due to some recorded cases and deaths in neighbouring states.\n\nHe assured that the State Disease Control team had been activated, while the process of sensitising the people with jingles, adverts and other communication media were ongoing. Ojo said similar actions taken during the 2016 outbreak were successful, adding that the epidemic was perfectly controlled while the patient, who was properly managed, survived.\n\nHe disclosed that the isolation centre's at Ido Federal Teaching Hospital, Ido-Ekiti; Oba Adejuyigbe General Hospital and the Ekiti State University Teaching Hospital, Ado-Ekiti were still operational. He urged health practitioners, teachers, traditional rulers, religious leaders, as well as community and opinion leaders to join hands with the state government to prevent a further spread of the disease in the state.\n\nMeanwhile, the Cross River State government is set to commission a pharmaceutical company- CalaPharm that would manufacture drugs for the treatment of Lassa fever, meningitis and other diseases next month [April 2018].\n\nThe team, which was led by the Commissioner for Information and Orientation, Mrs. Rosemary Achibong, also visited Rice City and Industrial Zone, which would house private companies under APZ.\n\nConsultant in charge of the project, Farhan Khan, made this known yesterday [Tue 13 Mar 2018] in Calabar during inspection of projects undertaken by the present administration. He said the factory, which would be of World Health Organisation (WHO) standard would complement the Governor Ben Ayade Care and also focus on mother and childcare. Khan said: 'Production is coming up soon, so we will be producing drugs of WHO standards and by next month, it should be commissioned because the machines are already here.'\n\n[Byline: Ayodele Afolabi and Tina Todo]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Active participation of individual households is essential for prevention of Lassa fever virus infections.

Dr Anthony Nsiah-Asare, the director-general of the Ghana Health Service, who was speaking to the media in Accra on Thursday [1 Mar 2018], said one person has been confirmed dead from Lassa fever.\n\nLassa fever is transmitted to humans via contact with food or household items contaminated with the urine, saliva faeces, and blood of infected rodents.\n\nThe confirmation, Dr Nsiah-Asare said, followed a test conducted by the Noguchi Memorial Institute for Medical Research. He said that, currently, all the frontline staff at the hospital that handled the patient before he died were being screened, while further investigations to trace the background and all contacts of the deceased were being pursued to prevent the spread of the virus. He called on the public to be extremely cautious of rodents and maintain good hygiene. He also urged the public to report any suspected case of the disease.\n\nThe GHS in February 2018 issued an alert of the likelihood of an outbreak of Lassa fever in the country. The disease is said to have already affected several countries in West Africa with, over 300 cases and 31 deaths in Nigeria.\n\nThe GHS recommended the following to all health workers and institutions:\n\n1. Surveillance on Lassa fever, and acute hemorrhagic fevers in general (using case definitions), should be enhanced.\n2. Suspected cases of Lassa fever should be managed in specific isolation conditions.\n3. Health workers should adhere to regular infection prevention and control (IPC) measures to prevent and protect against possible nosocomial transmission.\n4. Blood samples from suspected case(s) should be taken and safely packaged and sent to Noguchi Memorial Institute for Medical Research (NMIMR) for laboratory investigations.\n5. All levels (national, regional, districts and facilities) are requested to update their preparedness and response plans for Lassa fever and VHF in general, sensitize the respective staff, and create necessary public awareness.\n\nLassa fever [LF] is an acute viral haemorrhagic fever illness which is endemic in West Africa. The incubation period is 6-21 days. The onset of LF illness is often gradual, with non-specific signs and symptoms and commonly presents with fever, general weakness, and malaise at the early onset. After a few days, headache, sore throat, muscle pain, chest pain, vomiting, diarrhoea and abdominal pain may follow. Severe cases may progress to show facial swelling, and bleeding tendencies (from mouth, nose, vagina or gastrointestinal tract), and low blood pressure. Shock, seizures, disorientation, and coma may be seen in the late stages. Complications include: deafness, transient hair loss, and gait disturbance may occur during recovery. About 80 per cent of Lassa fever infections are mild or asymptomatic.\n\n- Lassa fever virus is transmitted to humans via contact with food or household items contaminated with the urine, saliva faeces, and blood of the rodent (Multi-mammate rat).\n- Person-to-person infections and laboratory transmission can also occur, particularly in hospitals lacking adequate infection prevent and control measures.\n- The disease is endemic in the rodent population in parts of West Africa, and the multi-mammate rat serves as reservoir for the virus.\n- Lassa fever is known to be endemic in Benin, Guinea, Liberia, Mali, Sierra Leone and parts of Nigeria, but probably exists in other West African countries as well.\n- Ghana recorded the 1st confirmed case(s) in 2011 in 2 districts, one each in Ashanti and Eastern regions, then confirmed outbreaks of Lassa fever (see Lassa fever - Ghana: (AH, EP) susp. 20111220.3642).\n- Early use of [Ribavirin] (within 7 days of disease onset), supportive care with re-hydration, and symptomatic treatment improve survival.\n- There is no effective vaccine for the disease at the moment.\n\n[byline: Seth J Bokpe]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Lassa fever has been active in several West African countries this year [2018], including Nigeria, Liberia ex Guinea, and Benin ex Nigeria, so it is not surprising that a case has been diagnosed in Ghana. Interestingly, this was predicted previously. In commenting on the 2011 cases in Ghana, the late Mod.CP commented that Lassa virus infection had not been recorded previously in Ghana, but the lesser prevalence of Lassa fever in Ghana was predicted by a spatial-climatic analysis of Lassa fever data from human cases and infected rodent hosts in West Africa during the period 1965-2007 (See Risk maps of Lassa fever in West Africa.

WHO is helping to coordinate health actors and is joining rapid risk assessment teams travelling to hot spots to investigate the outbreak.\n\nBetween 1 Jan and 4 Feb 2018, nearly 450 suspected cases were reported, of which 132 are laboratory confirmed Lassa fever. Of these, 43 deaths were reported, 37 of which were lab confirmed.\n\nThe acute viral haemorrhagic fever is endemic in Nigeria but for the current outbreak the hot spots are the southern states of Edo, Ondo, and Ebonyi.\n\n'The high number of Lassa fever cases is concerning. We are observing an unusually high number of cases for this time of year.' said Dr Wondimagegnehu Alemu, WHO Representative to Nigeria.\n\nAmong those infected are 11 health workers, 4 of whom have died. WHO is advising national authorities on strengthening infection, prevention, and control practices in healthcare settings. Healthcare workers caring for Lassa fever patients require extra infection and control measures, including the use of personal protective equipment [PPE] to prevent contact with patients' bodily fluids.\n\nWith the increase in the number of cases, WHO initially donated personal protective equipment to the Nigeria Center for Disease Control and to the affected states and procured laboratory reagents to support the prompt diagnosis of Lassa fever. WHO is deploying international experts to coordinate the response, strengthen surveillance, provide treatment guidelines, and engage with communities to raise awareness on prevention and treatment.\n\nLassa fever is endemic to several West African countries. Benin, Liberia, and Sierra Leone have all reported cases in the past month. WHO is working with countries in the region to strengthen coordination and cross-border cooperation.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n[The activities for WHO collaboration are essential for surveillance and for treatment of Lassa fever cases. Prevention of infection among healthcare workers is critical to prevent nosocomial transmission. In deciding when to don PPE, the challenge for these workers is to recognize that their patients have Lassa fever early in the infection, when the symptoms are general and typical of many other kinds of infections.\n\nEngaging with communities at risk of infection is also a challenge.

Baderinwa said there has not been any report on the spread of the disease by the medical personnel who are observing these people at the isolated centre.\n\nAccording to him, 'There is no reason for anybody to panic on the report of a suspected Lassa fever case in the state. What was reported is an isolated death case of a young man who came from a neighbouring state. The young man who was suspected of carrying Lassa fever disease from the neighbouring state died at the Obafemi Awolowo University Teaching Hospital Complex [OAUTHC], Ile-Ife.\n\n'As a proactive measure, the medical personnel had to quarantine those who had contact with the strayed deceased for observation.

The State Commissioner for Information and Strategy, Adelani Baderinwa, said in a statement that there is no cause for panic by residents of the state over the alleged spread of the disease in the state. \n\nThe acute viral haemorrhagic fever is endemic in Nigeria but for the current outbreak the hot spots are the southern states of Edo, Ondo, and Ebonyi. \n\n'The vector (rats) are very close to the people in the market and when they (rats) touch what they (traders) sell, the buyers who consume the food would be infected. \n\nThe leader of the market women at Akindeko market, Alhaja Sidikat Abidogun, after listening to the doctors, commended the NMA for the initiative and urged the doctors to intensify the campaign and cover more markets so that the majority of the people would be aware of the scourge. \n\n\nNo fewer than 40 people who came in contact with a young man who reportedly died of Lassa fever have been placed under intensive medical examinations. The young man who was suspected of carrying Lassa fever disease from the neighbouring state died at the Obafemi Awolowo University Teaching Hospital Complex [OAUTHC], Ile-Ife.

According to the agency, following the increasing number of Lassa fever cases, within a week, 54 new confirmed cases were recorded from 8 states, with 10 new deaths in confirmed cases from 5 states.\n\n'From 1 Jan-25 Feb 2018, a total of 1081 suspected cases and 90 deaths have been recorded actively in Edo, Ondo, Bauchi, Nasarawa, Ebonyi, Anambra, Benue, Kogi, Imo, Plateau, Lagos, Taraba, Delta, Osun, Rivers, FCT, Gombe and Ekiti states, making 18 states. This year [2018], 69 per cent of all confirmed cases are from Edo (43 per cent) and Ondo (26 per cent) states, and 14 health care workers have been affected in 6 states: Ebonyi -7, Nasarawa -1, Kogi -1, Benue -1, Ondo -1 and Edo -3) with 4 deaths (Ebonyi -3 and Kogi -1),' said the report.\n\nLassa fever is an acute viral haemorrhagic illness, transmitted to humans through contact with food or household items contaminated by infected rodents. Person-to-person transmission can also occur, particularly in hospital environments in the absence of adequate infection control measures.\n\nThe agency further stated that since the start of 2018, 325 cases have been classified: 317 confirmed cases, 8 probable cases with 72 deaths (64 lab confirmed and 8 probable); the case fatality rate in confirmed and probable cases is 22 per cent.\n\n'There is need for the public to ensure and maintain adequate personal hygiene and environmental sanitation at all times as part of prevention and control measures against the spread of Lassa fever in the state,'' said Jide Idris, commissioner for health, in an interview with Business Day. The commissioner urged people to dispose of refuse properly at designated dump sites and not into the drainage system and to store food items in rodent-proof containers. 'Currently, Lassa fever [cases] are being followed up on, with testing across 3 laboratories in the country.

Unfortunately, the number of cases among health care workers is now 14.\n\nHalting the acquisition of Lassa fever virus infection at its source -- at the village level -- is not easy. As noted previously, getting local people to understand that virus transmission to humans occurs when people are in contact with the reservoir rodent host, the multimammate mouse (in the genus _Mastomys_) or its excreta can be difficult. Preventing this contact requires understanding that leads to action. Rodent control and prevention of contact with rodent excreta has to be undertaken at the village level with individual households.

It is encouraging to see international groups of health care workers and experts going to Nigeria. Recently, a team of UK experts is being sent to Nigeria to help the country contain the biggest outbreak of Lassa fever in recent years (https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/0/uk-experts-scrambled-fight-nigeria-lassa-fever-outbreak/).\n\nAs noted previously, Lassa fever remains a problem in Nigeria because the virus is endemic there. Preventing Lassa virus transmission requires getting local people to understand that virus spread to humans occurs when people are in contact with the reservoir rodent host, the multimammate mouse (in the genus _Mastomys_) or its excreta and can be difficult. Preventing this contact requires understanding that leads to action. Rodent control and prevention of contact with rodent excreta has to be undertaken at the village level with individual households. This requires an extensive and continuous public education effort. Transmission of the virus also occurs in health facilities when personal protective equipment is not employed, and barrier-nursing practices are not adequate to protect staff from blood and secretions of infected patients. Although no vaccine is available, Ribavirin has been used to successfully treat patients and is most effective if patients are treated early in the course of infection.\n\nImages of the mastomys mouse, the rodent reservoir of Lassa fever virus, can be seen at https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/45326-Mastomys-natalensis.\n\nMaps of Nigeria: http://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/map/profile/nigeria.pdf and http://healthmap.org/promed/p/62. - Mod.TY]", "summary": "Of these 1586 are currently being followed up, 1485 have completed 21 days follow up and 21 of the 47 symptomatic contacts have tested positive from 3 states (Edo-11, Ondo-7 and Ebonyi-3)\n- WHO and NCDC has scaled up response at National and State levels\n- Bernhard Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine Germany is currently supporting ISTH, NRL and LUTH Laboratories with testing reagents\n- NCDC distributed response commodities - PPEs, Ribavirin (injection and tablets), beds, body bags and hand sanitizers to FMC Owo, FETH Abakiliki, Niger and Ekiti states in the reporting week\n- NCDC is collaborating with ALIMA and MSF in Edo, Ondo and Anambra States to support case management\n- NCDC deployed teams to four Benin Republic border states (Kebbi, Kwara, Niger and Oyo) for enhanced surveillance activities\n- National Lassa fever multi-partner multi-agency Emergency Operations Centre (EOC) continues to coordinate the response activities at all levels.

However, critics questioned why the government was only now making the news public when the victim died [Thu 11 Jan 2018].\n\nFurther complicating the situation was the fact that the Guinean citizen died across the border in Liberia - the same way that Ebola initially spread. Guinea's government had vowed to improve its response to crises after initial efforts were disorganized and met with mistrust.\n\n'This official silence in the face of an epidemic is the reason I buried 8 members of my family who became victims of Ebola,' said student [AB] in the capital, Conakry.\n\nAuthorities in Guinea, though, said appropriate contact tracing was done and that there was nothing for people to fear.\n\n'None of the patient's contacts in Liberia became sick or tested positive for Lassa,' the statement said. It did not mention whether Liberian authorities had been informed. It said the World Health Organization was told 2 days after the death.\n\nThere is no approved vaccine for Lassa fever, whose symptoms are similar to Ebola. After starting as a fever with aches and pains it can progress to headache, vomiting and diarrhea. According to WHO, severe cases can cause victims to bleed from the mouth and nose.\n\nLike Ebola, Lassa fever can be spread through contact with the bodily fluids of sick people. Humans also can contract it from eating food that has been tainted by the urine or feces of rodents.\n\nDr. Sakoba Keita, who coordinated Guinea's national response to the Ebola outbreak from 2014-2016, told private radio station Espace FM that the new Lassa fever case was the country's 1st known one since 1996.\n\nThe disease, however, has long existed in West Africa. Nigerian authorities have reported more than 440 suspected cases throughout the country so far this year [2018], according to the non-governmental organization known as ALIMA. At least 40 people are believed to have died from Lassa fever there.\n\n[Byline: Krista Larson and Boubacar Diallo]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[This is the 1st Lassa fever case that ProMED-mail has posted for Guinea.

ALIMA is working alongside Nigeria's Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), as well as Federal and State health authorities.\n\n'ALIMA's priority is to help Nigerian health authorities protect and train hospital staff, improve case management and facilitate actions in the community to control the transmission of the disease,' said Guillaume Le Duc, ALIMA's Lassa Coordinator. 'The goal is to catch cases early, and improve the chances of survival for those who become infected.'\n\nAccording to the NCDC [Nigeria Center for Disease Control], 449 suspected cases of Lassa fever have been reported across 17 States since [1 Jan 2018]. Among these, 132 cases have been confirmed, as of [4 Feb 2018], and 40 people, including 3 health workers, have died. The current number of suspected cases is more than double the average annual caseload recorded in previous years.\n\nALIMA's emergency response\n--------------------------\nTo support the government's response, an emergency team from ALIMA, including an epidemiologist, medical doctors, logisticians, and a coordinator, are on the ground at the Owo Federal Medical Center in Ondo State and the Irrua Specialist Teaching Hospital in Edo State. Our teams are supporting case management, active case detection, patient triage, public awareness campaigns, and reinforcing Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) measures.\n\nALIMA is supporting the rehabilitation of a 38-bed treatment center in Owo to improve treatment capacity, and also expanding the bed capacity at the Irrua Specialist Teaching Hospital. ALIMA is also supporting the Nigerian government's efforts by supplying hospitals and health clinics with materials to ensure basic hygiene standards, reinforce infection prevention and control at triage points, and helping with waste management. ALIMA is providing personal protective equipment (PPE), thermoflash thermometers, and 3500 vials of ribavirin, the recommended treatment.\n\nThe need for research on Lassa fever\n------------------------------------\n'Lassa fever is a very neglected tropical disease and we need to look beyond this emergency to launch research initiatives,' said Dr Denis Malvy, a professor at the French National Institute for Health and Medical Research (INSERM Unit 1219). 'This is exactly why ALIMA and INSERM created a research alliance: we need to respond to immediate needs and support longer-term research efforts at the same time. Our goals would be to better understand the dynamics of this disease, assess rapid diagnostic tests, evaluate the potential of vaccine candidates and improve the therapeutic tools available to clinicians on the front lines.'\n\nThanks to funding from the ELMA Relief Foundation and the Start Fund, ALIMA will continue to support the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control until at least 1 Mar 2018 and maintains close contact with local health authorities in order to help stop the spread of the outbreak.\n\nALIMA\n-----\nThe Alliance for International Medical Action (ALIMA) is a medical humanitarian organization that works hand-in-hand with a network of local organizations to provide quality medical care to the most vulnerable populations in emergency situations and recurrent crises. Based in Dakar, Senegal, ALIMA has treated over 3 million patients in 12 countries since its creation in 2009, and launched more than a dozen research projects focused on malnutrition, malaria and Ebola. ALIMA has extensive experience responding to outbreaks, including Ebola in Guinea, Rift Valley fever in Niger, Lassa fever in Togo, and dengue fever in Burkina Faso.\n\nIn Nigeria, ALIMA has been working in the northeast in Borno State since July 2016, where our teams were the 1st to provide medical and ambulatory nutritional care to internally displaced persons (IDPs) and host populations in Monguno. The program has since expanded to include the opening of a clinic near the makeshift camps for internally displaced persons in Muna Garage, on the outskirts of Maiduguri, which provides primary medical care to children under the age of 5, and treatment for cases of severe malnutrition at the Intensive Therapeutic Feeding Center at the University of Maiduguri Teaching Hospital, in Maiduguri.\n\nIn 2017, in Nigeria, our teams performed nearly 50 000 pediatric consultations, treated more than 10 000 children for severe acute malnutrition, and helped 2500 women give birth. In August 2017, ALIMA responded to an outbreak of cholera in Borno State that affected more than 5000 people.\n\nLassa fever\n-----------\nLassa fever is an acute viral hemorrhagic fever that is usually transmitted to humans from the infected urine, [saliva] or feces of the _Mastomys_ rat. Human-to-human transmission is also possible, via contact with the bodily fluids of an infected person, putting health workers at an especially increased risk of infection.\n\nSymptoms of the disease include fever, diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal pain, sore throat and hemorrhaging. Without proper diagnosis and treatment, Lassa fever mortality rate can reach 30 percent during outbreaks. Cases are best managed in isolation units and using a medication called ribavirin.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[It is very gratifying to see that the medical NGO ALIMA is working closely with the Nigeria CDC in supporting not only the treatment of infected people, but in prevention of nosocomial infections and public education as well. Dealing with cases scattered across 17 states and attempting to prevent new ones is a significant challenge.\n\nAs noted in the previous posts, cases of Lassa fever in Nigeria continue to increase. In Lassa fever endemic areas of Nigeria, the current 6-month dry season is when most cases occur. One can expect additional cases this year up through June 2018, and sporadic cases thereafter. Lassa fever remains a problem in Nigeria because the virus is endemic there. Virus transmission to humans occurs when people are in contact with the reservoir rodent host, the multimammate mouse (in the genus _Mastomys_) or its excreta. Rodent control has to be undertaken at the village level with individual households. This requires an extensive and continuous public education effort. Transmission also occurs in health facilities when personal protective equipment is not employed and barrier-nursing practices are not adequate to protect staff from blood and secretions of infected patients, as happened with the fatal cases of the 3 healthcare workers mentioned above. Early in the course of Lassa fever, patients present with a general febrile disease with symptoms common to a variety of infections, including malaria, making it more difficult for healthcare workers to know when personal protective equipment should be used.\n\nImages of the _Mastomys_ mouse, the rodent reservoir of Lassa fever virus, can be seen at https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/45326-Mastomys-natalensis.\n\nMaps of Nigeria: http://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/map/profile/nigeria.pdf and http://healthmap.org/promed/p/62\n\nInterestingly, given the recent cases in the region, public health authorities in Ghana, a West African country within the Lassa fever virus belt, have sounded the alarm bells to advise the medical community to be prepared should cases of Lassa fever occur there. The Ghana Health Services (GHS) has cautioned all Divisional Directors, Regional Deputy Directors of the Service, and public health care facilities of the likelihood of outbreaks of Lassa fever in the country (https://www.graphic.com.gh/news/general-news/lassa-fever-ghana-health-service-issues-alert.html).

'The success against Ebola created a situation whereby every other public health challenge in Nigeria to be a tea party. 'Therefore assume that Lassa fever and other challenges would be likened to malaria, that they were not serious,'' he said.\n\nHe said Lassa fever has been persistent in the country over the past 30 years.\n\nThe minister, therefore, appealed to the Nigeria Institute of Medical Research (NIMR) and other research institutes to look into the changing dynamics of Lassa fever. 'Lassa fever use to occur only during dry season but now we are contending with an all year transmission of Lassa fever.\n\n'NIMR director-general, other research institutes will need to find out whether we are dealing with new strain of Lassa fever virus in the country,' Adewole said.\n\nHe also urged state governments and other key stakeholders to work closely with Nigeria Centre of Disease Control [NCDC] to address outbreak of diseases.\n\nThe meeting was attended by a number of state Commissioners for Health and FCT [Federal Capital Territory] health secretariat.

The RRTs are supporting the States in response coordination, contact tracing, case management, risk communication and strengthening infection prevention and control practices. Emergency supplies have also been sent to treatment centres in all affected States.\n\nSince the beginning of 2018, a total number of 107 suspected Lassa fever cases have been recorded in 10 States: Edo, Ondo, Bauchi, Nasarawa, Ebonyi, Anambra, Benue, Kogi, Imo and Lagos States. As of [Sun 21 Jan 2018], the total number of confirmed cases is 61, with 16 deaths recorded. Also, 10 health care workers have been infected in 4 States (Ebonyi - 7, Nasarawa - 1, Kogi - 1 and Benue - 1) with 3 deaths in Ebonyi State.\n\nNCDC is collaborating with the World Health Organization (WHO), Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, Irrua Specialist Teaching Hospital, African Field Epidemiology Network, US Centers for Disease Control, University of Maryland Baltimore (UMB), Alliance for International Medical Action (ALIMA) and other agencies, in supporting the response in the affected States.\n\nLassa fever is an acute viral haemorrhagic illness, transmitted to humans through contact with food or household items contaminated by infected rodents. Person-to-person transmission can also occur, particularly in hospital environment in the absence of adequate infection control measures. Health care workers in health facilities are particularly at risk of contracting the disease, especially where infection prevention and control procedures are not strictly adhered to.\n\nLassa fever can be prevented through practicing good personal hygiene and proper environmental sanitation. Effective measures include storing grain and other foodstuffs in rodent-proof containers, disposing of garbage far from the home, maintaining clean households, and other measures to discourage rodents from entering homes. Hand washing should be practiced frequently.\n\nHealth care workers are again reminded that Lassa fever presents initially like any other disease causing a febrile illness such as malaria; and are advised to practice standard precautions at all times, maintaining a high index of suspicion. Rapid Diagnostic Test (RDT) must be applied to all suspected cases of malaria. When the RDT is negative, other causes of febrile illness including Lassa fever should be considered. Accurate diagnosis and prompt treatment increase the chances of survival.\n\nFamily members who are providing care for patients with Lassa fever should take extra caution. In addition, States are encouraged to ensure safe and dignified burial practices for patients who die from Lassa fever.\n\nThe National guidelines for Infection Prevention and Control, as well as Lassa fever case management have been developed, disseminated to States and are available on the NCDC website for download (http://ncdc.gov.ng/diseases/guidelines).\n\nThe Nigeria Centre for Disease Control remains committed to supporting all States' public health teams to prevent and respond to public health threats.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[This is the 6-month dry season when most cases of Lassa fever occur, so having 107 suspected cases in not surprising.

The index case was a 35 year-old male residing in Nigeria but originally from Nadoba village in Togo, which borders Boukoumb\u00e9.\n\nHe became ill on [15 Dec 2017] while in Nigeria and travelled to Nadoba to stay with relatives. On [8 Jan 2018] he was admitted in the Saint Jean de Dieu hospital in Tangui\u00e9ta in Benin with symptoms including high grade fever, haematemesis, bleeding gums, conjunctivitis and abdominal pain. He died on [9 Jan 2018] and a safe and dignified burial was conducted on [10 Jan 2018] in Boukoumb\u00e9. On [13 Jan 2018], blood samples sent to the national laboratory in Cotonou tested positive for Lassa fever by PCR.\n\nAs of [17 Jan 2018], a cumulative total of 4 cases including 3 deaths (case fatality rate 75 percent) had been reported from Boukoumb\u00e9 commune (one confirmed/index and one suspected) and Toucountouna commune (one probable and one suspected). All 4 cases initially developed symptoms while residing in Nigeria and subsequently travelled to Benin. To date, in Benin, 144 contacts have been identified, including 47 (32 percent) in health facilities and 97 in the community. There are also contacts that are being followed in Togo.\n\nPUBLIC HEALTH ACTIONS\n- WHO is supporting the Ministry of Health in the coordination of surveillance and response activities.\n- A national rapid response team has been deployed to affected communes to support the local teams.\n- The National Director of Public Health has briefed the media regarding Lassa fever.\n- Contact tracing has been initiated in affected districts. There are 80 contacts currently under 21-day follow-up in 5 communes: Boukoumb\u00e9 (36), Natitingou (28), Tangui\u00e9ta (9), Toucoutouna (5), and Tchaourou (2); 64 additional contacts in Togo (Nadoba) are being followed up by Togolese authorities.\n- All health workers have been orientated in the detection and management of suspected Lassa fever cases.\n- Personal protective equipment has been supplied to health facilities involved in Lassa fever case management.\n- Risk communication and social mobilization activities have been intensified in the affected communities.\n- Traditional healers and community leaders have been sensitized on Lassa fever prevention and control measures.\n\nSITUATION INTERPRETATION\nThe most recent Lassa fever outbreak in Benin occurred in February 2017 and also involved case importation from Nigeria. Lassa fever is endemic in bordering Nigeria and given the frequent population movements between Nigeria and Benin, the occurrence of additional cases is not unexpected. Strengthening of cross-border collaboration and information exchange between the 2 countries is therefore needed. Furthermore, infection prevention and control measures should be enhanced in health facilities to mitigate the risk of transmission to healthcare workers. Finally, concerted efforts should be made to strengthen active surveillance in order to improve early case detection and management and reduce case fatality.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-EAFR from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed-eafr@promedmail.org>\n\n[Lassa fever outbreaks have afflicted Nigeria a lot in the last 5 years, and now it has been exported to Benin. There are also fears that the outbreak might spread to Togo since the index case in this report is a Togolese and had contact with people who have traveled to Togo.\n\nAs of January 2018, Lassa fever outbreaks have been active in at least 16 of 36 states in Nigeria. Hundreds of people have been infected, and scores of them have died. In an era of increased ease of travel, the outbreak's spread has the potential to cause an international pandemic if not checked.\n\nNigeria seems to be struggling with containing these Lassa fever outbreaks. Help from international humanitarian organizations might be needed to contain the outbreaks to stop them from spreading to other countries. - Mod.YA]\n\n[Lassa fever virus is endemic in much of northwest Africa, including Benin, Togo, and Burkina Faso. Although the 4 cases reported above all acquired their Lassa fever virus infections in Nigeria, the virus is also present in Benin. The previously reported reappearance of Lassa fever cases in Benin in an outbreak that occurred between [21 Jan and 16 Feb 2016] is an indication that the virus is endemic in that country with cases reported in 7 departments (71 cases, 6 confirmed, 10 probable and 55 suspected) in Borgou (52), Collines (13), Oueme (2), Alibori (1), Atlantique (1), Kouffo (1) and Littoral (1); with a total of 23 deaths recorded in the departments of Borgou (16), Collines (4), Atlantique (1), Oueme (1) and Plateau).\n\nThe Lassa fever virus rodent reservoirs (species in the genus _Mastomys_) are widely distributed across West and Central Africa. Control of these rodents is difficult and expensive. However, public education efforts at the village level can help to reduce exposure resulting from food materials and the environment contaminated by urine, feces and saliva of these infected rodents.\n\nSince nosocomial transmission can occur when health care personnel are exposed to blood and other fluids of infected patients -- as apparently happened the 2016 outbreak--, it is essential that health care personnel have access to personal protective equipment and are trained to use it effectively and safely. - Mod.TY\n\nHealthMap/ProMED-mail maps:\nBenin: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/59\nNigeria: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/62]", "summary": "A ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n Date: Fri 19 Jan 2018, 5:00 PM\nSource: WHO Weekly Bulletin on Outbreaks and Other Emergencies, week 3, 2018 [edited]\nhttp://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/259885/1/OEW03-1319012018.pdf\n\n\nLassa fever, Benin\n Communicated by:\nProMED-EAFR from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed-eafr@promedmail.org>\n\n[Lassa fever outbreaks have afflicted Nigeria a lot in the last 5 years, and now it has been exported to Benin.

The patient became ill on 25 Dec 2017, during a visit to Nigeria.\n\nUpon his return, he sought care at the Boukoumb\u00e9 Health Center before being transferred to the Tanqui\u00e9ta hospital.\n\n[Of the patient's contacts,] 10 were identified and followed, 9 of whom are healthcare workers.\n\nReminders about Lassa fever\n---------------------------\nLassa fever is an acute viral haemorrhagic fever that is known to be endemic in various West African countries, including Nigeria, and causes epidemics almost every year, with annual peaks observed between December and June. Lassa virus was first described in 1969 in the city of Lassa, Borno state, Nigeria.\n\nLassa fever is caused by a virus of the family Arenaviridae, the Lassa virus, whose reservoir is a rodent (_Mastomys_). The virus is endemic in several West African countries where epidemic outbreaks occur regularly and affect 100 to 300 000 people per year, of which 5 to 6000 succumb. Transmission to humans is through contact with food or household products contaminated by the faeces of the reservoir host, inhalation of aerosols of dust contaminated with rodent excreta, or inter-human contact.\n\nThe clinical picture of Lassa fever is variable, from asymptomatic infection, very common (80 percent of cases) to a lightning haemorrhagic fever. The disease begins 6-21 days after the infection with clinical signs including fever, vomiting, nausea, abdominal pain, headache, myalgia, arthralgia, and asthenia. In severe cases, the symptoms worsen, with the appearance of edema, haemorrhagic signs, pericardial and pleural effusions, and more rarely encephalitis. The patient dies in a context of hypotensive and hypovolemic shock and renal and hepatic failure.\n\nLassa fever is extremely serious for the pregnant woman, frequently leading to the death of the mother and systematically to that of the fetus.\n\nRibavirin (anti-viral drug) has been used successfully in patients with Lassa fever.\n\nLassa fever is responsible for significant morbidity and mortality.\n\nWorld Health Organization advice\n--------------------------------\nThe prevention of Lassa fever is based on the promotion of good 'community hygiene' to discourage rodents from entering homes. In healthcare settings, staff should always apply standard infection prevention and control precautions when caring for patients, regardless of their presumed diagnosis.\n\nOn rare occasions, travelers from regions where Lassa fever is endemic export the disease to other countries. Although other tropical infections are much more common, the diagnosis of Lassa fever should be considered in febrile patients returning from West Africa, especially if they have had exposure in rural areas or hospitals in countries where Lassa fever is known to be endemic. Healthcare workers who see a patient suspected of having Lassa fever should immediately contact local and national experts for advice and laboratory tests.\n\n[Byline: Claude Hengy]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[This case is an example of international movement, Nigeria to Togo and Benin, of a Lassa fever virus infected individual.

A major output of this meeting was the development of a communique with proceedings and recommendations from the meeting. As a sequel to last week's issue editorial, this week focuses on specific recommendations from the meeting with the goal to implement these for an improved response to Lassa fever in Nigeria.\n\nThe meeting had in attendance state epidemiologists of 18 states that have been affected by the current outbreak, case management physicians from these states, representatives from NCDC collaborating laboratories across the country, members of the Lassa Fever Steering Committee chaired by Prof. Oyewale Tomori, and representatives from the Federal Ministries of Agriculture, Environment, the World Health Organization, UNICEF, US Centers for Disease Control, African Field Epidemiology Network, University of Maryland Baltimore (Nigeria office) and Medecins Sans Frontiers.\n\nGiven the range of attendees cutting across policy makers, surveillance officers, case management physicians, response teams and related, extensive discussions were held and first-hand experience shared to develop the recommendations below.\n\nOne key consensus was on coordination. The coordination of Lassa fever preparedness and response activities is essential for the prevention of a large outbreak. A key activity that we have continuously advocated for is the constitution of Rapid Response Teams (RRTs) at state and Local Government Area (LGA) levels with individuals with the relevant expertise. This should also be supported by the establishment of a multi-hazard Emergency Operations Centre (EOC) and Incident Management System (IMS) for the coordination of outbreak response.\n\nIn the past, outbreaks have spread across communities with late or incomplete reporting by Disease Surveillance and Notification Officers (DSNOs) and State Epidemiologists. It is very important that surveillance officers at all levels provide complete and timely information on all cases as requested in the case-based viral haemorrhagic fever management system forms. States are also encouraged to designate and train surveillance focal persons in all health facilities and involve communities in disease surveillance. Surveillance activities have been stalled by the lack of sufficient funding. State governments are encouraged to create budgetary allocations and timely release of funds for surveillance activities and training.\n\nThe Nigeria Centre for Disease Control has developed guidelines for response to Lassa fever and related guidelines for Viral Hemorrhagic Fevers [VHFs]. These should be used as a guide to ensure a harmonized approach to prevention, detection and response across the country. In addition, it is important for each state to designate a treatment centre state with a constituted case management team/IPC team for Lassa fever and other VHFs. There should be dedicated funds at facility, LGA, state, and national levels for management of cases.\n\nIn the last few years, the NCDC collaborating laboratories in Lagos and Irrua have served as the main diagnostic facilities for Lassa fever and other VHFs. With the recent operationalization of the NCDC National Reference Laboratory in Gaduwa, Abuja, the Northern region will also have a hub for Lassa fever diagnosis. There are ongoing discussions to develop a national VHF sample transportation logistical framework, protocol and policy for sample management. This will be in addition to the establishment of VHF diagnostic laboratories in each geopolitical zone in Nigeria within the next 12 months. Each state should provide standardised sample collection and transportation kits in order to reduce the hazards inherent in current methods of shipping samples.\n\nRisk Communication and Social Mobilization have remained often ignored and underserved areas. It is important for states and federal levels to organise periodic media workshops and engagement to increase sensitisation and awareness of VHFs among the general public. An all-hazard risk communications plan currently being developed by the NCDC can be adapted by states.\n\nFinally, the NCDC will work to facilitate One Health collaborative research to establish the drivers of Lassa fever, including areas of case management, drug manufacture, Rapid Diagnostic Test (RDT) kits and vaccine development.\n\n1.

The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) together with the World Health Organisation and supporting partners, hosted the Lassa fever outbreak after action review meeting on the 21 and 22 Aug 2017. Participants were drawn from the states affected by the outbreak this year [2017], Lassa fever treatment facilities, diagnostic laboratories, NCDC surveillance, laboratory, and health emergency response teams, Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, Federal Ministry of Environment, and other key stakeholders. Technical support was provided by WHO Africa Regional Office (AFRO) and the National Lassa fever Steering Committee.\n\nThe event was declared open on the 1st day by the Honourable Minister of State for Heath, Dr Osagie Enahire, who applauded the NCDC for its efforts towards stemming the tides of Lassa fever in Nigeria and charged all present to find a lasting solution to the menace of the disease in the country. The chairperson of the National Steering Committee, Prof Oyewale Tomori gave an overview of Lassa fever outbreak since the virus was discovered in 1969 with a critical review of control efforts taken in the past which have not yielded needed results. He decried the unsustainable efforts that have plagued the surveillance system in Nigeria and called on every stakeholder to realign their activities to achieve a common goal of a strengthened surveillance system, which can be used as a strong tool in the fight against Lassa fever. He urged participants present to focus on finding practical solutions towards elimination of the disease.\n\nA national report of the 2016/2017 Lassa fever outbreak was presented. As at epi-week 33 (14-20 Aug 2017), a total of 764 suspected cases have been reported across 19 states (Ogun, Taraba, Rivers, Nasarawa, Edo, Ondo, Bauchi, Ebonyi, Plateau, Kaduna, Gombe, Cross-River, Borno, Kano, Kogi, Enugu, Anambra, Lagos, and Kwara). 247 of these cases were confirmed and 14 classified as probable cases. A total of 83 deaths have been recorded, with 69 of them in confirmed cases. Case fatality rate is 33.6 percent in confirmed and probable cases and 15.1 percent in all cases (confirmed, probable, and suspected). The response activities carried out by the NCDC, including the development of Viral Haemorrhagic Fever [VHF] guidelines, deployment of rapid response teams, provision of ribavirin and other medical supplies to states and several others, were also discussed.\n\nRobust discussions were held by the participants following various presentations made, which all focused on preparedness and response to Lassa fever outbreak. The 2-day meeting provided an opportunity to reflect on the events which led to the 2016/2017 Lassa fever outbreak in each state and also to conduct out a detailed review of the response activities carried out by the affected States and the NCDC. In addition, gaps in preparedness, response and surveillance activities were highlighted and pragmatic steps to be taken to bridge these gaps were proposed.\n\nWorking groups were created in line with the 6 thematic areas under the incident management system (IMS) for Lassa fever -- coordination/case management/infection prevention and control, laboratory, logistics, surveillance/data management and risk communication. Focus group discussions were held within these working groups during which best practises and challenges in the 2016/2017 Lassa fever outbreak were highlighted. Practical recommendations were made by every group in their individual thematic areas and in cross-cutting areas. Each state was enjoined to follow up with these recommendations, as it applies to their particular needs and circumstances and to also incorporate them in their state-specific Lassa fever preparedness work plan.\n\nThe NCDC affirmed its resolve to continue to ensure that the disease burden caused by Lassa fever, and indeed all epidemic-prone diseases in Nigeria is reduced. The steps taken at this meeting will serve as added incentives towards establishing a finish line for the scourge of Lassa fever. All stakeholders and the general public are called upon to work with the governments in the various States towards a collaborative plan for the control and elimination of Lassa fever.\n\n--\n1.

Transmission also occurs in health facilities when personal protective equipment is not employed and barrier-nursing practices are not adequate to protect staff from blood and secretions of infected patients.\n\nImages of mastomys mice, the rodent reservoir of Lassa fever virus, can be seen at http://www.ispot.org.za/node/255877.\n\nMaps of Nigeria can be accessed at http://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/map/profile/nigeria.pdf and http://healthmap.org/promed/p/62. - Mod.TY]\n\n******\n[2] Surulere, Lagos\nDate: Tue 8 Aug 2017\nSource: Pulse [edited]\nhttp://www.pulse.ng/health/lassa-fever-kills-2-in-luth-doctor-critically-ill-id7109288.html\n\n\nTwo people have reportedly died from Lassa fever while receiving treatment at the Lagos University Teaching Hospital (LUTH).\n\nMr. Seun Ogungbure, who works at a diagnostic center in Surulere that gets patients from LUTH, confirmed to Pulse Nigeria in a private chat that the Accident and Emergency unit of the hospital, as well as a few others, have been shut down due to the incident. 'It's very rare that they would close down the A and E if it wasn't something serious,' he said.\n\nHe said after contacting medical staff working at the institution that it was revealed that 2 victims died during the weekend, while a medical officer is critically ill.\n\n'It's not an airborne disease but one that can be passed by physical contact,' he said.\n\nAnother doctor that works with the hospital confirmed the story, although he said he's only aware of one casualty. He also said: 'There's a surveillance team at the hospital now to handle any other patients.'\n\nThe management of the hospital finally confirmed the story on Tue 8 Aug 2017, as Chief Medical Director Prof. Chris Bode revealed that the 2 victims presented their symptoms too late to do anything to help them. He said: 'Each of these 2 patients presented very late and died in spite of efforts to [save] them. The 1st was a 32-year old pregnant lady with a bleeding disorder who died after a stillbirth. Post-mortem examination had been conducted before her Lassa fever status was eventually suspected and confirmed. No less than 100 different hospital workers exposed to this index case are currently being monitored.'\n\nHe also confirmed that the critically ill staff member of the hospital is a resident doctor from the Department of Anatomic and Molecular Pathology. He contracted the viral hemorrhagic fever after performing autopsies on the dead victims and is currently on admission at the isolation ward of the hospital.\n\nDespite confirming that there are currently 2 other suspected cases of the virus, Prof. Bode also pleaded for members of the public not to panic as the state's Ministry of Health and the Federal Ministry of Health are doing their best to contain the situation. He said, 'There are adequate materials for containing the disease while drugs have been made available to treat anyone confirmed with it. The Centre for Disease Control in Nigeria has also been contacted. Two other suspected cases from Lagos state are also currently admitted and quarantined while undergoing confirmatory laboratory tests.\n\n'LUTH has always worked closely with officials of the state Ministry of Health in handling a number of diseases of public concern such as rabies, cholera, Lassa fever and the recent diarrhoea disease at Queen's College,' [he added].\n\nThe viral hemorrhagic fever is spread by rats and leads to death in extreme cases.\n\n[Byline: Samson Toromade]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\nand\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Surulere, in Lagos is within the Lassa fever virus endemic area in Nigeria. It is not clear whether all of these cases were exposed in a hospital or health center or in other locations where rodents in the _Mastomys_ genus are present. Apparently, at least the physician was exposed in the hospital.\n\nHospital exposures are unfortunate and preventable if health care workers wear personal protective equipment and practice barrier nursing.

Rather such patients should be referred to tertiary health institutions for prompt medical attention as time was of the essence in treating Lassa fever,'' the commissioner said.\n\nOn [Sat 8 Jul 2017], students from Federal Government Girls College, were rushed from the school clinic to the Jos University Teaching Hospital and it was observed that they were displaying symptoms of Lassa fever.\n\nTheir blood samples were taken to Lagos University Teaching Hospital (LUTH) were it was discovered that 3 out of the 4 samples were positive.\n\nLassa fever, also known as Lassa hemorrhagic fever (LHF), is a type of viral hemorrhagic fever caused by the Lassa virus. Many of those infected by the virus do not develop symptoms.\n\nWhen symptoms occur they typically include fever, weakness, headaches, vomiting, and muscle pains.\n\nThe virus is commonly transmitted by rats and is said to be responsible for about 5000 deaths every year.\n\nRecently the Nigerian Medical Association (NMA) alerted Nigerians on the need to raise their guard against another outbreak of Lassa fever and Ebola.\n\nDr Tunde Olawepo, the Chairman of the association in Kwara told our correspondent in an interview that Nigeria must not let down its guard against the deadly viruses, Ebola and Lassa fever.\n\nAccording to him, surveillance of travellers entering the country has stopped just as people had relaxed with personal hygiene like regular washing of hands and use of sanitizers. 'People have stopped using hand sanitizers and frequent hand washing as before. We need to step up with preventive measures and this means people must keep up with hygiene at all times,' he said.\n\n[Byline: Blessing Odega]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[2] National\nDate: Fri 14 Jul 2017\nSource: Nigeria Centre for Disease Control [NCDC] Weekly Epidemiological Report 7(26) [edited]\nhttp://www.ncdc.gov.ng/reports/weekly\n\n\n1.

Transmission also occurs in health facilities when personal protective equipment is not employed and barrier nursing practices are not adequate to protect staff from blood and secretions of infected patients.\n\nImages of _Mastomys_ mice, the rodent reservoir of Lass fever virus, can be seen at http://www.ispot.org.za/node/255877.\n\nOnce again, ProMED thanks Dr Olutayo Olajide Babalobi for sending in the Epidemiological Report above.\n\nMaps of Nigeria can be accessed at http://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/map/profile/nigeria.pdf and http://healthmap.org/promed/p/62. - Mod.TY]", "summary": "Figure 2: Map of Nigeria showing areas affected by Lassa fever, week 1 - 53, 2015 and week 1 - 52, 2016\n\nTable of cases by state, cumulative data weeks 1-25 [1 Jan-23 Jun 2017]:\nState: Cases / Laboratory confirmed / Deaths\n Between weeks 1 and 25 (2017) [1 Jan-23 Jun 2017], 317 suspected Lassa fever cases with 76 laboratory confirmed cases and 52 deaths (CFR, 16.40 percent) from 63 LGAs (22 states) were reported compared with 744 suspected cases with 72 laboratory confirmed cases and 87 deaths (CFR, 11.69 percent) from 126 LGAs (27 states) during the same period in 2016 (Figure 1).

Ibiyemi, however, disclosed that the affected student was not living within the students' hostel but lived with her parents in Owo town, saying the fever was imported from the town to the academic community.\n\nThe VC said 'one of the students of the university reported to the university health center for treatment. However, she was not responding to treatment and as usual, had to be transferred to the FMC where she was diagnosed of having Lassa fever symptoms. She has since been stabilized and will be discharged anytime soon.'\n\nAccording to him, the investigation carried out by the school revealed that the affected student contacted the disease from outside the school, adding that 'none of her roommates and friends, who have been screened, developed symptoms of the ailment.'\n\nIbiyemi however said that the management of the institution has decided to give the students of the university a 3-week mid- semester break from [Tue 20 Jun 2017] to allay the fears of the parents who have been calling to inquire about the welfare of their children. He also said the management of the school has concluded all arrangements to carry out precautionary measures against the outbreak of the disease in the school. He said 'This will allow the agitated parents to see their children and rest assured that they [are] safe and sound. The break will also enable the university to carry out the necessary precaution measures before the students resume back to school on [Sun 9 Jul 2017].'\n\nHe added that some health officials from the Federal Medical Center (FMC) Owo, had visited the school to educate the students and staff of the institution on how to guard against the disease, while he also disclosed that collaboration has been established between the school and the ministry of health in the state. 'The management takes the overall wellbeing of its staff and students seriously. Nothing is therefore, spared to ensure this.' the VC said.\n\nHowever, the Permanent Secretary in the ministry of Health, Dr Taiye Oni disclosed that out of the 4 cases recorded in the state, 2 were recorded in Owo metropolis and another 2 in Akoko South West local government area of the state. He explained that the latest Lassa fever occurrence was coming at unusual time but said the state government has reactivated its disease notification and surveillance mechanism.\n\nHe advised the people to properly store their foods, especially grains and also 'to give priority to personal and environmental hygiene at this critical time'\n\n'[The] Government is doing its best to contain the recorded cases by isolating the patients, to prevent further spread, and we have embarked on aggressive contact tracing, sensitization of the people not just in Owo and Ose but across the state on preventing and precautionary measures.\n\n'Most times, we have always run to Irrua Specialist Hospital in Edo state but the facility is already overwhelmed with so many cases across the country which is why we are collaborating with the Federal Medical Center, Owo in handling the recorded cases.\n\n'We are supporting FMC Owo with protective kits, injections and tablets and just as we appeal to people with cases of me occurring fever to visit the nearest government hospital for necessary attention.' he said.\n\n[Byline: Badmus Bimbola]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[These are not the 1st cases to be reported in Ondo state this year (2017).

But this turns out to be incorrect as 3 other students were confirmed to be admitted at JUTH and are being treated for different ailments. 'One of them was being treated for perforated intestine and has had surgery; the other fell and injured herself while the 3rd is being managed for renal problems.'\n\nMr Magaji, a senior member of staff at the school, personally visited the family of the deceased and the girls being treated at JUTH over the weekend.'

She was bleeding from the gums, nostril and vagina and was confirmed Lassa Fever victim in Irua.\n\n'The moment it was confirmed that she had Lassa fever, we started contacts tracing. As of now, we have about 65 we are following up, 2 of them have developed fever and their samples have been taken to Irua. We are still tracking others and we have advised them on what to do to ensure they do not transfer it to their loved ones,' he said.\n\nResidents were also urged to keep their surroundings clean and keep their foods free from rats.\n\nIt would be recalled, in May [2017], a member of the NYSC, Onwuegbuzie Stanley-Samuel, deployed to Cross River, died of Lassa fever disease at the University of Calabar Teaching Hospital (UCTH).\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Although Lassa fever was reported in 20 states in the week 21 [week 19 to 25 Mar 2017] Weekly Epidemiological Report issued on 9 Jun 2017, Anambra state was not included.

There may be an effective vaccine on the horizon. A press release sent to us by Leann Bailey <zalgenlabs@gmail.com> stated that utilizing antibodies from Zalgen and Tulane University (Tulane) coupled to the Lassa virus GPC, researchers at The Scripps Research Institute (TSRI) and other VHFC and VIC affiliated organizations successfully characterized the 1st high-resolution image of an arenavirus glycoprotein in its native trimer structure, expanding the capability for developing significantly more effective medical countermeasures. Several Zalgen/Tulane antibodies have demonstrated effectiveness as immunotherapeutics. Zalgen's 1st immunotherapeutic candidate, Arevirumab-3 demonstrated 100 percent efficacy in treating infected animals using 2 relevant model systems, and will advance to pre-clinical development, with projected Phase I studied within 3 years. The newly solved Lassa virus GPC trimer will also enable the design of better vaccines to elicit successful antibodies in recipients.\n\nImages of _Mastomys_ mice, the rodent reservoir of Lass fever virus, can be seen at http://www.ispot.org.za/node/255877.\n\nMaps of Nigeria can be accessed at http://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/map/profile/nigeria.pdf and http://healthmap.org/promed/p/62. - Mod.TY\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/62.]", "summary": "1 / 0 / 1\nKogi: 2 / 1 / 1\nNasarawa: 28 / 6 / 2\n A ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n Adamawa: 6 / 0 / 2\nBauchi: 9 / 3 / 3\nCross River: 6 / 0 / 0\n Edo: 91 / 20 / 9\nEnugu: 1 / 1 / 1\nFCT: 2 / 0 / 0 Between weeks 1 and 21 (2017), 263 suspected Lassa fever cases with 59 laboratory confirmed cases and 48 deaths (CFR, 18.25 percent) from 54 LGAs (20 States) were reported compared with 716 suspected cases with 71 laboratory confirmed cases and 87 deaths (CFR, 12.15 percent) from 125 LGAs (27 States) during the same period in 2016 (Figure 1).

Reduction of populations of this rodent will require active participation at the village level. That will necessitate mounting a public education program with support of rodent control technicians. Preventing entry of rodents into the home and keeping food materials tightly covered are helpful measures to prevent infection.

The virus, a member of the virus family Arenaviridae, is a single-stranded RNA virus and is zoonotic, or animal-born.\n\nLassa fever is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. While Lassa fever is mild or has no observable symptoms in about 80 percent of people infected with the virus, the remaining 20 percent have a severe multisystem disease.\n\nThe animal host of Lassa virus is a rodent known as the 'multimammate rat' of the genus _Mastomys_. Humans get infected with Lassa through aerosol or direct contact with excreta from the rodent. Laboratory infections do occur, primarily through contaminated needles.\n\nThe symptoms of Lassa fever typically occur 1-3 weeks after the patient comes into contact with the virus. These include fever, retrosternal pain (pain behind the chest wall), sore throat, back pain, cough, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, conjunctivitis, facial swelling, proteinuria (protein in the urine), and mucosal bleeding. Neurological problems have also been described, including hearing loss, tremors, and encephalitis.\n\nThe Lassa virus was 1st described in 1969 in the town of Lassa, in Borno State, Nigeria.\n\n[Byline: Robert Herriman]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[It is not surprising that cases of Lassa fever are continuing to occur in Nigeria.

Virus transmission to humans occur when people are in contact with the reservoir rodent host, the multimammate mouse (in the genus _Mastomys_) or their excreta. Transmission also occurs in health facilities when personal protection equipment is not employed and barrier nursing practices are not adequate to protect staff from blood and secretions of infected patients.\n\nAlso, as noted in earlier, prevention and control of Lassa fever in nature depends on control of the rodent reservoir, which occurs across Nigeria and beyond.

No death was recorded. A total of 283 suspects have so far been reported since onset of the outbreak in December 2016. A total of 99 cases have been classified: 93 confirmed cases and 6 probable cases. The total number of deaths has remained the same in the last 2 weeks, 46 deaths, of which 40 were confirmed cases and 6 probable cases. The case fatality rate for confirmed/probable is 46.5 percent and for all cases is 19.8 percent.\n\nThe Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) has continued to coordinate response in affected states. Further support has been provided through re-distribution of ribavirin to affected states for continued case management of confirmed cases. The NCDC team in Borno State has been onsite in the last 3 weeks, providing support for the outbreak response.\n\nFigure 1 [map]. States with confirmed cases, December 2016 to March 2017 (updated as of 17 Mar 2017), N = 99\n\nPreparedness for an outbreak of Lassa Fever\nIn 1969, the Lassa fever virus was 1st discovered in Lassa town, Borno State. With this discovery, there have been recurrent outbreaks of the disease over the years. Lassa fever is a seasonal disease, which occurs during the dry season. The last few years have seen this outbreak occur in states that have been previously unaffected. This brings to question the level of preparedness at the state level. It is important that all states attain a high level of preparedness to contain any possible outbreak, as this will go a long way in ensuring a good outcome, should an outbreak occur.\n\nAt the beginning of the dry season, a checklist developed by the NCDC was provided to all state epidemiologists to enable them to assess their level of preparedness in the event of an outbreak of Lassa fever or cerebrospinal meningitis, which usually occurs during this season. It is expected that gaps identified post-administration of the checklist are bridged prior to the onset of an outbreak.\n\nThe identification of gaps in a clear and systematic way will go a long way in motivating all stakeholders, including the leadership at the state level, to carry out assigned responsibilities in outbreak response.\n\nThe efforts put in by the states over the years are highly commendable, particularly in the face of limited resources. However, it is important for state governments to take ownership of outbreak management and response activities in the state while working with partners and other stakeholders in a collaborative manner. The NCDC will continue to provide support in every way it can as we all work towards achieving a surveillance system that will effectively protect the health of Nigerians.\n\n1.

Since then, the outbreak has remained active. During the week ending 19 Mar 2017, 15 suspected cases were reported, with 2 testing positive for Lassa fever. Between 16 Dec 2016 and 19 Mar 2017, a total of 283 suspected cases including 56 deaths (case fatality rate of 19.8 percent) have been reported. Of the suspected cases, 99 were confirmed by the Lagos University Teaching Hospital Lassa laboratory in Nigeria.\n\nThe cases have been distributed across 13 states: Ogun, Bauchi, Plateau, Ebonyi, Ondo, Edo, Taraba, Nasarawa, Rivers, Kaduna, Gombe, Cross-River, and Borno.\n\nBenin\n-----\nThe outbreak of Lassa fever in Benin started on 12 Feb 2017 from Tchaourou district, Borgou province, close to the border with Nigeria. It was established that this case had epidemiological link with the ongoing Lassa fever outbreak in Nigeria. On 23 Feb 2017, another suspected case from L'Atacora province was reported. Samples obtained from the 2 cases tested positive for Lassa fever in the laboratory in Cotonou, Benin, and in the Lagos University Teaching Hospital Lassa laboratory. Both cases died, giving a case fatality of 100 percent.\n\nTogo\n----\nIn Togo, Lassa fever was confirmed on 23 Feb 2017, with the case having established epidemiological linkage to Benin. A total of 12 suspected were subsequently reported, 7 of them were confirmed at the Institut National d'Hygiene in Lome, Togo. 4 of the confirmed cases died, giving a case fatality rate of 57 percent. The cases originated from Oti and Kpendjal districts.\n\nBurkina Faso\n------------\nOn 26 Feb 2017, the Ministry of Health of Burkina Faso notified WHO of a confirmed Lassa fever case admitted in a hospital in the northern part of Togo. The case originated from Ouargaye district, central eastern part of Burkina Faso. Burkina Faso has not had any other case.\n\nSierra Leone\n------------\nSierra Leone has been reporting sporadic suspected cases of Lassa fever since 28 Dec 2016. However, the outbreak situation escalated in the months of February and March 2017 when a cluster of 24 cases were reported and investigated. Out of these, 4 cases were laboratory confirmed and all of them died, thus giving case fatality rate of 100 percent among the confirmed. The outbreak has since subsided.\n\nLassa fever is endemic in Nigeria and other West African countries. Outbreaks have occurred almost every year in different parts of the region, with yearly peaks observed between December and February.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The West African countries mentioned in the report above can be located on the maps at http://www.nationsonline.org/maps/west-africa-political-map.jpg and http://healthmap.org/promed/p/62.\n\nLassa virus is a member of the family Arenaviridae and can cause acute hemorrhagic fever in humans. Lassa fever is a zoonotic disease, meaning that humans become infected from contact with infected animals. The animal reservoir, or host, of Lassa virus is a rodent of the genus _Mastomys_, commonly known as the 'multimammate rat.' _Mastomys_ rats infected with Lassa virus do not become ill, but they can shed the virus in their urine and faeces (http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs179/en/).\n\nBecause the clinical course of the disease is so variable, detection of the disease in affected patients has been difficult. When presence of the disease is confirmed in a community, however, prompt isolation of affected patients, good infection prevention and control practices, and rigorous contact tracing can stop outbreaks. About 80 percent of people who become infected with Lassa virus have no symptoms. 1 in 5 infections result in severe disease, where the virus affects several organs such as the liver, spleen, and kidneys.\n\nConsidering the seasonal flare ups of cases during this time of the year, countries in West Africa that are endemic for Lassa fever are encouraged to strengthen their related surveillance systems.\n\nHealth-care workers caring for patients with suspected or confirmed Lassa fever should apply extra infection control measures to prevent contact with the patient's blood and body fluids and contaminated surfaces or materials such as clothing and bedding. When in close contact (within 1 metre/39 in.) of patients with Lassa fever, health-care workers should wear face protection (a face shield or a medical mask and goggles), a clean, non-sterile long-sleeved gown, and gloves (sterile gloves for some procedures).\n\nLaboratory workers are also at risk. Samples taken from humans and animals for investigation of Lassa virus infection should be handled by trained staff and processed in suitably equipped laboratories under maximum biological containment conditions.\n\nThe diagnosis of Lassa fever should be considered in febrile patients returning from areas where Lassa fever is endemic. Health-care workers seeing a patient suspected to have Lassa fever should immediately contact local and national experts for advice and to arrange for laboratory testing (http://www.who.int/csr/don/18-may-2016-lassa-fever-liberia/en/). - Mod.UBA]", "summary": "A ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n \n\nHealth-care workers caring for patients with suspected or confirmed Lassa fever should apply extra infection control measures to prevent contact with the patient's blood and body fluids and contaminated surfaces or materials such as clothing and bedding.

Following this, there are currently 13 states affected by the outbreak, with 7 new suspected cases reported from 3 states. Following laboratory testing for Lassa fever and other VHFs, 4 of these suspected cases were confirmed positive, and 2 deaths were recorded.\n\nSince onset of the outbreak, 247 suspected cases have been reported with 73 confirmed cases and 6 probable deaths. A total of 43 deaths have been recorded so far (37 in confirmed cases and 6 in probable cases). The case fatality rate for all cases is 21.5 percent and for all confirmed/probable cases is 54.4 percent.\n\nThe Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) has continued to provide support (on-site and off-site) to the affected states. A team has been dispatched by the NCDC to provide support to Borno state. This was very important given the peculiar situation [violent insurgent groups] in the state, which has further created challenges with disease notification, reporting, and surveillance.\n\nThe 1st confirmed case of Lassa fever in Borno state was reported to the NCDC on 1 Mar 2017. The index case is a 32-year-old woman who presented at the hospital with a 9-day history of high-grade fever and 2-day history of bleeding from the nose and mouth.\n\nShe had a history suggestive of being exposed to rats [reservoir host of Lassa fever virus. - Mod.TY] and also poor storage of foodstuffs (uncovered foodstuff). Onset of illness was on 17 Feb 2017, and the patient 1st visited a chemist and then a traditional healer. She later presented at a health facility on 20 Feb 2017, where Lassa fever was suspected. She was put in an isolation unit and had laboratory investigations carried out; results showed she was positive for Lassa fever. The affected LGA [local government area] was notified on 21 Feb [2017], and notification was sent to the state the next day [22 Feb 2017]. Contact tracing has also been instituted.\n\nWe applaud the Borno state team for the prompt notification of this case. It is also important to highlight that the high index of suspicion among the health workers, which led to the patient's immediate isolation, played a key role in preventing further spread of the disease. We continue to encourage the general public to report immediately to a health facility if they have symptoms suggestive of Lassa fever or any VHF. We must remember that if a fever persists, it may be Lassa fever.\n\n1.

Virus transmission to humans occurs when people are in contact with the reservoir rodent host, the multimammate mouse (in the genus _Mastomys_) or their excreta. Transmission also occurs in health facilities when personal protection equipment is not employed and barrier nursing practices are not adequate to protect staff from blood and secretions of infected patients.\n\nAs noted in earlier, prevention and control of Lassa fever in nature depends on control of the rodent reservoir, which occurs across Nigeria and beyond. Reduction of populations of this rodent will require active participation at the village level. That will necessitate mounting a public education program with support of rodent control technicians. Preventing entry of rodents into the home and keeping food materials tightly covered are helpful measures to prevent infection. Elimination of these rodents completely is probably not possible.\n\nThe above report contains several interesting maps of Lassa fever distribution.

According to the commissioner, the 4 deaths were recorded in Bauchi, Alkaleri and Ganjuwa local government areas of the state. She said 2 persons died from the disease in Bauchi and 1 in Alkaleri and Ganjuwa each.

Lassa fever remains a problem in large areas of Nigeria because the virus is endemic in rodents there.

That's the reason why the health authorities in the above report advise people to prevent rodent access to their food materials. Transmission also occurs in health facilities when personal protection equipment is not employed and barrier nursing practices are not adequate to protect staff from blood and secretions of infected patients.\n\nAs noted in previous posts, prevention and control of Lassa fever in nature depends on control of the rodent reservoir, which occurs across Nigeria and beyond. Reduction of populations of this rodent will require active participation at the village level. That will necessitate mounting a public education program with support of rodent control technicians. Preventing entry of rodents into the home and keeping food materials tightly covered are helpful measures to prevent infection.

She was discharged and had a miscarriage at home. After the 2nd hospitalization in Burkina Faso, she was transmitted to a hospital in Mango, northern Togo, and passed away on 3 Mar 2017.\n\nSamples from the pregnant woman tested positive for Lassa fever at the Institut National d'Hygi\u00e8ne in Lom\u00e9, Togo.\n\nA total of 7 contacts have been identified in Togo linked to the pregnant woman, and contact tracing is ongoing; 135 contacts in Burkina Faso have been identified linked to the pregnant woman, and contact tracing is ongoing.\n\nTogo\n\nOn 2 Mar 2017, a man was admitted to a health centre in the Kpendial health district for fever and melena and was referred to a regional hospital on 3 Mar 2017.\n\nSamples from the male case were sent to the Institut National d'Hygi\u00e8ne in Lom\u00e9, Togo and tested positive for Lassa fever.

The male case and his close relatives are under follow up at their home.\n\nA total of 18 contacts were identified in Togo linked to the male case.\n\nPublic health response\n\nHealth authorities in Benin, Burkina Faso and Togo are implementing the following measures to respond to these Lassa fever cases, including:\n\n- Deployment of rapid response teams to the affected areas for epidemiological investigation.\n- Identification of contacts and follow-up.\n- Strengthening of infection prevention and control measures in health facilities and briefing of health workers.\n- Strengthening of cross border collaboration and information exchanges between Togo, Burkina, Mali and Benin.\n\nWHO risk assessment\n\nLassa fever is an acute viral haemorrhagic fever illness. The Lassa virus is transmitted to humans via contact with food or household items contaminated with rodent urine or faeces. Person-to-person infections and laboratory transmission can also occur.\n\nLassa fever is endemic in neighbouring Nigeria and other West African countries and causes outbreaks almost every year in different parts of the region, with yearly peaks observed between December and February. The most recent Lassa fever outbreak in Benin occurred in the same area in January-May 2016. At least 54 cases including 28 deaths have been reported at country level. Both Burkina Faso and Togo have reported sporadic cases in the past.\n\nGiven constant important population movements between Nigeria, Togo, Burkina Faso, Niger and Benin, the occurrence of sporadic Lassa fever cases in West Africa was expected, and further sporadic cases may occur in countries of the region.\n\nHowever, with the ongoing control measures in Benin, Togo and Burkina Faso, the risk of further disease spread from these confirmed cases is considered to be low. Considering the seasonal peaks in previous years, increase in disease awareness, better preparedness and response in general, and strengthening of regional collaboration, the risk of large scale outbreaks in the region is medium.\n\nWHO advice\n\nPrevention of Lassa fever relies on promoting good 'community hygiene' to discourage rodents from entering homes. In health-care settings, staff should always apply standard infection prevention and control precautions when caring for patients, regardless of their presumed diagnosis.\n\nOn rare occasions, travellers from areas where Lassa fever is endemic export the disease to other countries. Although other tropical infections are much more common, the diagnosis of Lassa fever should be considered in febrile patients returning from West Africa, especially if they have had exposures in rural areas or hospitals in countries where Lassa fever is known to be endemic. Health-care workers seeing a patient suspected to have Lassa fever should immediately contact local and national experts for advice and to arrange for laboratory testing.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Marianne Hopp\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Lassa fever virus is endemic in much of northwest Africa, including Benin, Togo, and Burkina Faso.

Virus transmission to humans occurs when people are in contact with the reservoir rodent host, the multimammate mouse (in the genus _Mastomys_) or their excreta. That's the reason why the health authorities advise people to prevent rodent access to their food materials. Transmission also occurs in health facilities when personal protection equipment is not employed and barrier nursing practices are not adequate to protect staff from blood and secretions of infected patients.\n\nAs noted in previous posts, prevention and control of Lassa fever in nature depends on control of the rodent reservoir, which occurs across Nigeria and beyond.

Tweh and Winston W. Parley]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Liberia, a West African country, is endemic for Lassa virus. Lassa fever cases have been reported sporadically there. The Lassa fever belt in Liberia primarily occupies Lofa, Bong and Nimba Counties across the northern tier of counties bordering Guinea. Liberia has also been a source of an imported Lassa fever case in Sweden in the past. Also, there was a businessman who acquired his infection there and then returned to New Jersey, USA, where he died.\n\nThe virus is a member of the family _Arenaviridae_ and causes acute hemorrhagic fever. Virus transmission to humans occurs when people are in contact with the reservoir rodent host, the multimammate mouse (in the genus _Mastomys_), or their excreta. Transmission also occurs in health facilities when personal protection equipment is not employed and barrier nursing practices are not adequate to protect staff from blood and secretions of infected patients.\n\nAs noted in previous posts, prevention and control of Lassa fever in nature depends on control of the rodent reservoir, which occurs across Nigeria and beyond. Reduction of populations of this rodent will require active participation at the village level. That will necessitate mounting a public education program with support of rodent control technicians. Preventing entry of rodents into the home and keeping food materials tightly covered are helpful measures to prevent infection. Elimination of these rodents completely is probably not possible.\n\nImages of mastomys mice can be seen at http://www.ispot.org.za/node/255877. - Mod.TY\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/54.]", "summary": "\n\nDr. Nagbe concluded that Lassa fever disease can take 6 to 21 days in a patient before showing symptoms, thus necessitating a 21-day observation period for those who come in contact with patients infected with Lassa fever to prevent further spread.

Dr. Chikwe Ihekweazu, the Chief Executive Officer of NCDC, said this in a statement in Lagos. Ihekweazu said the cases were reported from 23 states.\n\nHe said that, following this, the Minister of Health inaugurated a Lassa Fever Eradication Committee under the leadership of Prof. Oyewale Tomori. It said that the committee was to look into the situation and offer solutions to the NCDC towards preventing future outbreaks and reducing deaths from the disease.\n\nAccording to Ihekweazu, the committee came up with an approach that focused on strengthening the capacities and capabilities of states to prevent, detect and respond to Lassa while the NCDC coordinates the efforts.\n\nThe statement said: 'The prepositioning of commodities has now ensured that all 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory in Nigeria have a full complement of emergency materials. The materials comprised personal protection equipment [PPE], Ribavirin, disinfection sprayers, hand sanitizers, hypochlorite (bleach), case definition posters, hard copies of IDSR technical guidelines and safety boxes.'\n\nThe statement said that NCDC had dispatched a team of epidemiologists to support Ogun State to respond to the recent outbreak where a case of Lassa fever was confirmed in a healthcare worker, who died later at the Federal Medical Centre, Abeokuta. It stated: 'Emergency Operations Centre has been setup and is now monitoring all contacts of the case, disinfecting contaminated areas and coordinating all response activities. This case highlights the risk Lassa fever still poses to the lives of Nigerians, particularly at this time of the year.'\n\nThe statement said that a nationwide risk communications plan had also been developed. Ihekweazu said: 'Throughout the dry season, a new communication plan would address priority antecedents of Lassa fever outbreaks to ensure prevention is guaranteed.'\n\nHe said the communication targeted all key stakeholders, from presidency to households, and would emphasise the ways to prevent Lassa fever infection. He said: 'The Lassa virus is transmitted to humans via contact with food or household items contaminated with infected rodent urine or faeces. Lassa can also be transmitted from human to human through contact with the body fluids of an infected person. The key messages to Nigerians are, firstly protect your food items from access by rats using whatever means that you can afford; refrigerate, cover, store properly. Secondly if you do have a fever, insist on getting tested for malaria using a rapid diagnostic test, remembering that not every fever is malaria. 'No healthcare worker can diagnose malaria without a test, and it is the right of every Nigerian to demand a test.'\n\nHe urged healthcare workers to always apply standard infection prevention and control precautions when caring for patients, regardless of their presumed diagnosis, as the healthcare setting could be particularly risky.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[With Lassa fever being reported from 23 states in Nigeria, it is good to see its diagnosis, treatment and prevention being tackled on a national basis. Presumably, eradication relates to occurrence of human cases.\n\nThe virus is endemic in multimammate rodents (_Mastomys_ spp.). Although reduction of populations of these rodents in and around human habitations is possible, their eradication and elimination of the virus is not. The committee is making valuable recommendations that should contribute to the reduction of human cases both in and outside health centers. Public education will be essential for implementation of safe rodent control measures and for eliminating contamination of food materials by these rodents. Availability of PPE in health care centers will eliminate nosocomial transmission but only if that equipment is properly used.

Lassa fever season is back, and it's brought Anambra and Delta [states] closer over the River Niger bridge.\n\nNew cases popping up in Asaba [Delta state] have led to the death of a doctor and 2 others.\n\nThe doctor was transferred from El Comfort Clinic in Asaba to Nnamdi Azikiwe University Teaching Hospital in Nnewi where he died hours later.\n\nAnambra has confirmed 3 deaths, but the number of cases suspected to be Lassa is uncertain.\n\nAt least 28 people -- 18 in Anambra and 10 in Delta -- are under quarantine or surveillance on account of connection with Lassa fever.\n\nThe tracing and tracking down all who have been in contact with any of the dead confirmed for Lassa is ongoing and laborious.\n\nThe deaths in Anambra have prompted Enugu [state] to intensify watch on its borders. It is sending surveillance officers to communities that border Anambra, afraid to leave anything to chance, said Enugu chief surveillance officer Okechukwu Ossai. 'There is high daily mobility of residents of our state to Anambra and vice versa, and we share a near seamless border with Anambra,' he said.\n\nLassa fever has broken into an epidemic in Nigeria nearly every year since 1969 when it was 1st identified and named Lassa -- after the town in Borno where researchers traced it. It is endemic in the country, has been for 47 years, killing dozens every year, and all states are at risk, the Nigerian Medical Association has warned in the past.\n\nIt has a fatality rate lower than Ebola virus disease, but in one year killed more Nigerians than the Ebola outbreak ever did.\n\nConcern is about relationship with the land and animals. The Lassa virus is carried in multimammate rats (the common soft-furred African rat whose female has a double row of breasts), which normally live in bushes and visit nearby homes for food, which they contaminate. Burning bush to create space for farming drives the rats from bushes into homes. 'Local and cultural habits of drying foods on the roads, streets and even around houses, carelessly also provide avenues for the spread of the virus,' said Dr Kayode Obembe, former president of Nigerian Medical Association.\n\n80 percent of Lassa fever cases pass unnoticed with symptoms similar in many common diseases as mild fevers, body aches, tiredness and loss of appetite. But severe cases progress with sore throat, cough, vomiting, diarrhoea and unexplained bleeding from body openings. Deaths may eventually occur.\n\nAccording to the World Health Organisation, 'Some studies indicate that 300 000 to 500 000 cases of Lassa fever and 5000 deaths occur yearly across West Africa.\n\nIn fatal cases, between one and 15 out of every 100 patients hospitalised for Lassa fever could die, usually within 14 days after the illness starts. The disease is especially severe late in pregnancy. In 8 out of 10 pregnancies in 3rd trimester, Lassa can kill a mother or cause an abortion.\n\nThe 1st point of contact with Lassa fever [virus] is in consuming food contaminated by the multimammate rats. They harbour the virus, but don't fall sick from it. Instead they excrete the virus in urine, faeces and other bodily secretions, which contaminates food.\n\nPatients with Lassa also transmit the virus in body secretions -- and health workers or family caregivers handling them are at risk.\n\nThe Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) has response teams rolling through affected states to beef up surveillance and actively search for cases of Lassa fever.\n\nThe only fortunate thing about Lassa fever is that it has a definitive treatment, unlike Ebola, said NCDC director, Dr Chikwe Ihekweazu.\n\nTreatment takes care of the disease and prevents further transmission. Ihekweazu says beyond handling food to avoid contamination and contact with rats, handling patients is vital to preventing transmission.\n\nIt requires health workers to have full complement of personnel protective equipment at best or simple things as gloves at worst.\n\n[Byline: Judd-Leonard Okafor]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nCeleste Whitlow\n<whitlow.celeste@gmail.com>\n\n[ProMED thanks Celeste Whitlow for sending in this report.\n\nAlthough there has been a reported decline in the number of Lassa fever cases recently this year (2016), the virus is endemic in rodents in Nigeria and cases can occur at any time.

The fever which has afflicted over 284 has killed about 154 Nigerians from different parts of the country from August 2015 to date. Fresh cases are recorded every day in some states like Ondo and Bauchi, where the outbreak had earlier stopped, signaling that the disease could spread further.\n\nWhat implications does this development portend for Nigeria a year after the latest outbreak began? What lessons do we learn? Could this outbreak become an epidemic? No one can provide definite answers to these questions presently. The new director-general of the Nigeria Centres for Disease Control, NCDC, Abuja, Dr Chikwe Ikpeazu, had, recently, in an interview, maintained that Lassa fever outbreak is yet to become an epidemic but there are fears that the continued deaths of Nigerians as a result of the fever may be pointing in a different direction.\n\nHealth watchers believe that the outbreak has been greeted with the attitude of complacency. The minister of health, Prof Isaac Adewole, while speaking to state house correspondents in Abuja said Nigeria cannot win the battle against Lassa the same way it won the battle against Ebola because Lassa is endemic in Nigeria. The minister also, at an Emergency National Council on Health meeting, said the country should not be talking about control, but rather should sign off the obituary of Lassa. He said: 'I call it an embarrassment because as a nation we cannot witness Lassa fever every year; it is rather abnormal for a nation that has resources like we should have to be witnessing such epidemic.' He promised that with the strengthening of the nation's epidemiology surveillance and response, Lassa would be put under locked and key.\n\nBefore now, millions of Nigerians did not imagine the seriousness of the threat of Lassa outbreak. Unfortunately, months after the inauguration of the committee on the fever, the current outbreak has taken a new dimension, as the country may have failed to interrupt the transmission. Currently, the likely risk for medical personnel is the newest security threat confronting Nigeria. With the deaths of many doctors in the country, the threat of possible epidemic of the disease cannot be ruled out coupled with the resurgence of wild polio virus at a time Nigeria is facing serious economic challenges.\n\nAccording to Prof Oyewale Tomori, no fewer than 3 people are diagnosed of the disease daily in the latest outbreak. 'We have little value for life, until more than 100 people die, it is not an emergency. For many years, Lassa has been with us but we don't take it seriously. In other parts of the world, when a single person dies of a disease, it is a national emergency. For how long are we going to continue to call tragedy an embarrassment?'\n\nHe explained that the breakdown in disease surveillance did not make the country notice that Lassa has consistently brought sorrow, pains and agony to several homes. 'If you are not hearing of new cases, it is not that the disease is not occurring, but because our disease surveillance is not up to par. We deceive ourselves that it's a seasonal disease, but the fact remains that it occurs throughout the year. At least, 3 people are diagnosed of Lassa daily somewhere in the country,' Tomori said.\n\n'We abandon disease surveillance and control activities; there was a time people worked together, the laboratories at Ibadan, the Ministry of Health, NIMR [National Institute For Medical Research], joined forces to protect the country. In the 1960s to 1980s at Ibadan, we produced every reagent we needed in the country. We did not depend on importation.'\n\nSadly, with the new trend of the infectious disease, only few Nigeria laboratories can give accurate results. To Tomori, 6-7 laboratories in the country cannot give proper results due to lack of support. The only few that function in the country have the support of partner agencies and backing from abroad.\n\nThe professor of virology also, in a report, described Lassa as an annual recurrent budget of death for poor people of Nigeria, adding: 'Because we have lived in a state of denial of the disease, we handle it with characteristic laxity. Lassa lacks the zeal and trepidation that Ebola outbreak inspired and Nigeria still wakes up every year an outbreak is reported, 'running in any which direction, and forgetting about the disease till another year another outbreak.'\n\nTo another stakeholder, a renowned professor of pharmacognosy and president, Bioresources Development Group, Prof Maurice Iwu, Lassa was more than an embarrassment because the country has the personnel required, knowledge of the fever and how to prevent it, but the disease still claims lives. Iwu argued that unless the country adopts the approach used during the Ebola outbreak, many more people would fall victim. 'As long as Lassa fever is anywhere in the country, as long as we have restaurants that don't keep good hygiene, as long as we have houses that are co-infested with rat and horse, as long as we have dirty environment, we are all vulnerable,' he said. 'The only thing we can do is keep track of the virus, and from time to time do research. Our universities should make sure that 80 per cent of their research is localized to treat our own diseases, issues and viruses we live with.'\n\nFindings by Sunday Vanguard show that as far as the average Nigerian is concerned, a confirmation of pockets of the disease across the states is alarming, while an epidemic would be catastrophic. Such fears are well founded. The latest Lassa fever outbreak affected 24 states in Nigeria. Unlike outbreaks of the past, it is spreading in rural and urban areas. In the country today, millions of people are walking around with high fevers and other kinds of symptoms that could confuse diagnosis of Lassa fever. Worse still, Nigeria has been listed among countries that may be threatened by global spread of Zika virus, another terrible, viral disorder caused by mosquitoes. This time, even health workers are not spared.\n\nWHO updates\n-----------\nAn update on the World Health Organization (WHO) website showed that between August 2015 and 17 May 2016, WHO has been notified of 273 cases of Lassa fever, including 149 deaths in Nigeria. Of these, 165 cases and 89 deaths have been confirmed through laboratory testing (case fatality rate; CFR: 53.9 per cent). The cases were reported from 23 states. Since August 2015, 10 health care workers (HCW) have been infected with Lassa virus, of whom 2 have died. Of these 10 cases, 4 were nosocomial infections. Just 2 weeks ago, 2 medical doctors died from the disease in Anambra and Delta States. As of 17 May 2016, 8 states reported Lassa fever cases (suspected, probable, and confirmed), deaths and/or following of contacts for the maximum 21-day incubation period. Currently, 248 contacts are being followed up in the country. The other 15 previously affected states have completed the 42-day period following last known possible transmission.\n\nPublic health response\n----------------------\nCurrently, 2 national laboratories are supporting the laboratory confirmation of Lassa cases by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests. All the samples were also tested for Ebola, dengue, yellow fever and so far have tested negative. The 2 laboratories that are currently operational are Virology laboratory, Lagos University Teaching Hospital and Lassa fever research and control centre, Irrua specialist hospital.\n\nAlong with other key partners, WHO is supporting the Federal Ministry of Health in surveillance and response of Lassa outbreaks including contacts tracing, follow up and community mobilisation. Of particular concern since the onset of Lassa fever outbreaks in Nigeria is the high proportion of deaths among the cases that is still under investigation.\n\nAccording to WHO, Lassa fever is an acute viral haemorrhagic illness caused by Lassa virus, a member of the arenavirus family of viruses. It is transmitted to humans from contacts with food or household items contaminated with rodent excreta. The disease is endemic in the rodent population in parts of West Africa like Nigeria.\n\nHumans usually become infected with Lassa virus from exposure to urine or faeces of infected mastomys rats. Lassa virus may also be spread between humans through direct contact with the blood, urine, faeces, or other bodily secretions of a person infected with Lassa fever.\n\nThere is no epidemiological evidence supporting airborne spread between humans. Person-to-person transmission occurs in both community and health-care settings, where the virus may be spread by contaminated medical equipment, such as re-used needles. Sexual transmission of Lassa virus has been reported. It also occurs in all age groups and both sexes.\n\nThe people at greatest risk are those living in rural areas where mastomys [the multimammate mouse] are usually found, especially in communities with poor sanitation or crowded living conditions.\n\nThe incubation period of Lassa fever ranges from 2-21 days. The onset of the disease, when it is symptomatic, is usually gradual, starting with fever, general weakness, and malaise. After a few days, headache, sore throat, muscle pain, chest pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, cough, and abdominal pain may follow. In severe cases facial swelling, fluid in the lung cavity, bleeding from the mouth, nose, vagina or gastrointestinal tract and low blood pressure may develop. Protein may be noted in the urine. Shock, seizures, tremor, disorientation, and coma may be seen in the later stages. Deafness occurs in 25 per cent of patients who survive the disease. Death usually occurs within 14 days of onset in fatal cases and severe late in pregnancy, with maternal death and/or fetal loss occurring in more than 80 per cent of cases during the 3rd trimester.\n\nLassa fever is difficult to distinguish from other viral haemorrhagic fevers such as Ebola virus disease as well as other diseases that cause fever, including malaria, shigellosis, typhoid fever, and yellow fever. Definitive diagnosis requires testing that is available only in reference laboratories. Laboratory specimens may be hazardous and must be handled with extreme care.\n\nThere is currently no vaccine that protects against Lassa fever. The antiviral drug ribavirin seems to be an effective treatment for Lassa fever if given early on in the course of clinical illness. There is no evidence to support the role of ribavirin as post-exposure prophylactic treatment.\n\nLassa timeline\n--------------\nLassa fever is not new to Nigerians. The 1st ever documented case of Lassa fever was reported in Nigeria in 1969 when 2 missionary nurses died in a town called Lassa in the part of Nigeria now known as Borno State. They had complaints of weakness, headaches, fever, and general malaise.\n\nA study in the journal Cell by a team that included Christian Happi of Irrua Specialist Hospital -- where experts confirm strains of Lassa fever in samples had traced 'ancient roots' of Lassa nearly 1000 years to a region that is now present-day Nigeria. Until 2008, specimens were flown abroad for confirmation. Since 2008, 2 centres have stepped in to fill the gap in laboratory diagnosis and research into the fever -- Lassa Fever Research and Control Centre at Irrua Specialist Hospital, Edo, and Lahor Research. Samples from the latest outbreaks have undergone confirmation at Irrua, which also provided confirmation for cases from 2012 onwards. In 2012, the number of cases peaked in 2012, when 1723 cases with 112 fatalities were recorded. In 2012, half a million vials of ribavirin, an antiviral drug considered effective were procured after the 1st case of Lassa was reported in Ebonyi. By then, one doctor and up to 4 nurses had died, some others were hospitalised at Federal Teaching Hospital, Abakiliki.\n\nLassa fever has the greatest impact among haemorrhagic fevers -- rivalled only by dengue. Up to 300 000 are infected annually in West Africa alone, and an estimated 5000 of them die.

The new director-general of the Nigeria Centres for Disease Control, NCDC, Abuja, Dr Chikwe Ikpeazu, had, recently, in an interview, maintained that Lassa fever outbreak is yet to become an epidemic but there are fears that the continued deaths of Nigerians as a result of the fever may be pointing in a different direction. \n\n'We abandon disease surveillance and control activities; there was a time people worked together, the laboratories at Ibadan, the Ministry of Health, NIMR [National Institute For Medical Research], joined forces to protect the country. \n\nTo another stakeholder, a renowned professor of pharmacognosy and president, Bioresources Development Group, Prof Maurice Iwu, Lassa was more than an embarrassment because the country has the personnel required, knowledge of the fever and how to prevent it, but the disease still claims lives. A ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n Since 2008, 2 centres have stepped in to fill the gap in laboratory diagnosis and research into the fever -- Lassa Fever Research and Control Centre at Irrua Specialist Hospital, Edo, and Lahor Research. \nAn update on the World Health Organization (WHO) website showed that between August 2015 and 17 May 2016, WHO has been notified of 273 cases of Lassa fever, including 149 deaths in Nigeria. Lassa lacks the zeal and trepidation that Ebola outbreak inspired and Nigeria still wakes up every year an outbreak is reported, 'running in any which direction, and forgetting about the disease till another year another outbreak.' \n\nPrevention and control of Lassa fever in nature depends on control of the rodent reservoir, which occurs across Nigeria and beyond. However, strengthening of the nation's epidemiology surveillance and response is possible and desirable, to prevent exposure to the virus in households and medical care facilities and provide timely treatment early in the course of disease. With the deaths of many doctors in the country, the threat of possible epidemic of the disease cannot be ruled out coupled with the resurgence of wild polio virus at a time Nigeria is facing serious economic challenges. As long as Lassa fever is anywhere in the country, as long as we have restaurants that don't keep good hygiene, as long as we have houses that are co-infested with rat and horse, as long as we have dirty environment, we are all vulnerable,' he said. ' Unfortunately, months after the inauguration of the committee on the fever, the current outbreak has taken a new dimension, as the country may have failed to interrupt the transmission. \n\nLassa fever has the greatest impact among haemorrhagic fevers -- rivalled only by dengue. \n\nThe professor of virology also, in a report, described Lassa as an annual recurrent budget of death for poor people of Nigeria, adding: 'Because we have lived in a state of denial of the disease, we handle it with characteristic laxity. Fresh cases are recorded every day in some states like Ondo and Bauchi, where the outbreak had earlier stopped, signaling that the disease could spread further. \n\nFindings by Sunday Vanguard show that as far as the average Nigerian is concerned, a confirmation of pockets of the disease across the states is alarming, while an epidemic would be catastrophic. As of 17 May 2016, 8 states reported Lassa fever cases (suspected, probable, and confirmed), Death usually occurs within 14 days of onset in fatal cases and severe late in pregnancy, with maternal death and/or fetal loss occurring in more than 80 per cent of cases during the 3rd trimester. In the country today, millions of people are walking around with high fevers and other kinds of symptoms that could confuse diagnosis of Lassa fever. Lassa virus may also be spread between humans through direct contact with the blood, urine, faeces, or other bodily secretions of a person infected with Lassa fever.

If you are not hearing of new cases, it is not that the disease is not occurring, but because our disease surveillance is not up to par. LASSA FEVER - WEST AFRICA (37): NIGERIA\n***************************************\n \n\nHumans usually become infected with Lassa virus from exposure to urine or faeces of infected mastomys rats. Of particular concern since the onset of Lassa fever outbreaks in Nigeria is the high proportion of deaths among the cases that is still under investigation. The onset of the disease, when it is symptomatic, is usually gradual, starting with fever, general weakness, and malaise. \n\nThere is currently no vaccine that protects against Lassa fever. The 1st ever documented case of Lassa fever was reported in Nigeria in 1969 when 2 missionary nurses died in a town called Lassa in the part of Nigeria now known as Borno State. He said: 'I call it an embarrassment because as a nation we cannot witness Lassa fever every year; it is rather abnormal for a nation that has resources like we should have to be witnessing such epidemic.' \n\nSadly, with the new trend of the infectious disease, only few Nigeria laboratories can give accurate results. The fever which has afflicted over 284 has killed about 154 Nigerians from different parts of the country from August 2015 to date. The latest Lassa fever outbreak affected 24 states in Nigeria. According to WHO, Lassa fever is an acute viral haemorrhagic illness caused by Lassa virus, a member of the arenavirus family of viruses. A study in the journal Cell by a team that included Christian Happi of Irrua Specialist Hospital -- where experts confirm strains of Lassa fever in samples had traced 'ancient roots' of Lassa nearly 1000 years to a region that is now present-day Nigeria. \n\nPublic health response\n Person-to-person transmission occurs in both community and health-care settings, where the virus may be spread by contaminated medical equipment, such as re-used needles.", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "dengue", "lassa fever", "malaria", "shigellosis", "yellow fever", "zika"], "syndromes": ["haemorrhagic fever"], "event_date": ["2021-03-28 00:00:00", "1969-03-25 00:00:00", "2012-03-25 00:00:00", "2013-03-25 00:00:00", "2008-03-25 00:00:00", "1723-03-25 00:00:00", "2015-08-25 00:00:00", "2037-03-25 00:00:00", "2016-05-17 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Ebonyi", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Nasarawa", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Abuja", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Nassarawa", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Lassa", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Anambra", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "lassa", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Yobe", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Edo", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Ibadan", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Niger", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Benue", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Taraba", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "WEST AFRICA", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Nigeria", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "West Africa", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Lagos", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Borno State", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Irrua", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "4296038", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Lassa fever - West Africa (31): Nigeria", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=4296038", "date": "2016-06-19 11:30:04", "main_text": "LASSA FEVER - WEST AFRICA (31): NIGERIA\n***************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nIn this update:\n[1] MOH\n[2] WHO quoted\n\n******\n[1] MOH\nDate: Fri 10 Jun 2016\nSource: Nigeria Centre for Disease Control, Nigeria Federal Ministry of Health 6(19) [not yet posted on the Ministry website, edited]\n\n\nOne (1) suspected case of Lassa fever was reported from Karu LGA (Nassarawa State) in week 22 [week ending 4 Jun 2016], 2016 compared with zero cases reported in the same period in 2015.\n\nBetween weeks 1 and 22 (2016), 717 suspected Lassa fever cases with 71 lab-confirmed and 87 deaths (CFR, 12.13 percent) from 125 LGAs (27 states) were reported compared with 126 suspected cases with 8 lab-confirmed and 4 deaths (CFR, 3.17 percent) from 17 LGAs (10 states) in the same period of 2015.\n\nLassa fever case numbers as of week 22 [week ending 4 Jun 2016]\n-----------------------------------\nNumbers of cases in states reported / confirmed / deaths\nAdamawa 8 / 0 / 1\nAkwa Ibom 3 / 1 / 1\nBauchi 28 / 3 / 3\nBenue 3 / 0 / 0\nDelta 1 / 1 / 1\nEbonyi 12 / 3 / 4\nEdo 263 / 18 / 7\nEkiti 10 / 1 / 0\nFCT [Federal Capital Territory] 14 / 2 / 0\nGombe 13 / 1 / 0\nKaduna 23 / 3 / 3\nKano 17 / 1 / 7\nKatsina 11 / 0 / 1\nKebbi 6 / 0 / 0\nKogi 9 / 2 / 2\nLagos 8 / 3 / 1\nNasarawa 47 / 9 / 13\nNiger 59 / 0 / 19\nOgun 7 / 2 / 0\nOndo 82 / 10 / 11\nOsun 1 / 1 / 1\nOyo 8 / 0 / 0\nPlateau 25 / 6 / 5\nRivers 13 / 4 / 3\nSokoto 1 / 0 / 0\nTaraba 43 / 0 / 3\nYobe 2 / 0 / 1\n\nTotal 717 / 71 / 87\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nTayo Babalobi\n<tayobabalobi@gmail.com>\n\n[There is a decline in incidence that one hopes will continue.

Of these 24 suspected cases, 7 are reported to have tested positive for Lassa fever:\n- 2 cases were identified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR);\n- 2 cases were identified through the detection of IgM antibodies using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA);\n- 2 cases were identified through the detection of Lassa virus antigens using ELISA;\n- information on the type of testing employed to identify the seventh case is not currently available.\n\nAll the Lassa fever confirmed cases tested negative for Ebola virus disease. Since there are no designated laboratories in Liberia that can test samples for Lassa fever by PCR, specimens are currently sent for testing to Kenema, Sierra Leone.\n\nPublic health response\n----------------------\nTo date, 134 contacts have completed the 21-day follow-up period. A total of 17 additional contacts are being monitored. None of these contacts have so far developed symptoms.\n\nAppropriate outbreak response measures, including case management, infection prevention and control, community engagement and health education, have been put in place by the national authorities with the support of WHO and partner organizations.\n\nWHO risk assessment\n------------------\nLassa fever is endemic in Liberia and causes outbreaks almost every year in different parts of the country. Based on experiences from previous similar events, it is expected that additional cases will be reported.\n\nAlthough occasional travel-associated cases of Lassa fever have been reported in the past (see DON published on 27 and 8 April 2016), jthe risk of disease spread from Liberia to non-endemic countries is considered to be low. WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conduct risk assessments based on the latest available information.\n\nWHO advice\n----------\nConsidering the seasonal flare ups of cases during this time of the year, countries in West Africa that are endemic for Lassa fever are encouraged to strengthen their related surveillance systems.\n\nHealth-care workers caring for patients with suspected or confirmed Lassa fever should apply extra infection control measures to prevent contact with the patient's blood and body fluids and contaminated surfaces or materials such as clothing and bedding. When in close contact (within 1 metre [39 in]) of patients with Lassa fever, health-care workers should wear face protection (a face shield or a medical mask and goggles), a clean, non-sterile long-sleeved gown, and gloves (sterile gloves for some procedures).\n\nLaboratory workers are also at risk. Samples taken from humans and animals for investigation of Lassa virus infection should be handled by trained staff and processed in suitably equipped laboratories under maximum biological containment conditions.\n\nThe diagnosis of Lassa fever should be considered in febrile patients returning from areas where Lassa fever is endemic. Health-care workers seeing a patient suspected to have Lassa fever should immediately contact local and national experts for advice and to arrange for laboratory testing.\n\nWHO does not recommend any travel or trade restriction to Liberia based on the current information available.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Liberia has been the source of 2 imported Lassa fever cases in the recent past.

She had been travelling there for 6 weeks, with the last couple of weeks in the northern and northwestern parts. In 2004 there was a businessman who acquired his infection there, returned to New Jersey, USA, and died there.

All the doctors, nurses and other auxiliary staff who had contact with the late patient are currently being quarantined.\n\nImpeccable sources at the hospital disclosed that the patient, whose identity could not be verified at press time, died last week in the intensive care unit [ICU] of the hospital, after a surgical operation. The sources, who requested anonymity as they were not authorised to speak on the issue, further disclosed that all the doctors, nurses and other auxiliary staff in the theatre and the ICU who had contact with the late patient are currently being quarantined and closely monitored for symptoms of the hemorrhagic disease.\n\nIt was also gathered that all equipment that was used to treat the patient, both in the theatre and the ICU, is also being quarantined and sterilized.\n\nAll efforts made to get confirmation from the hospital management failed, as calls made to the hospital's public relations officer, Kehinde Ibitoye, went unanswered.

This could result in more contamination of the environment with virus-containing excreta from these rodents.\n\nPrevention and control of Lassa fever in nature depends on control of the rodent reservoir, which occurs across Nigeria and beyond.

She had been travelling there for 6 weeks, with the last couple of weeks in the northern and northwestern parts. The patient did not have any symptoms before or during the travel back to Sweden [2 Mar 2016]. There were rumors of cases of Lassa fever in the area where she travelled and the patient had been staying in rooms with traces of mouse excreta. The travel partner did not experience any symptoms suggestive of Lassa fever.\n\nA week after her return to Sweden, she experienced onset of symptoms such as high fever, chills, joint pain, headache, diarrhoea, and occasional vomiting. She went to an outpatient clinic, but as neurological complications did appear, she was hospitalized [17 Mar 2016] at Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Gothenburg [V\u00e4stra G\u00f6taland County]. The medical examination showed signs of encephalitis and the suspicion/probability of Lassa virus infection was raised on [29 Mar 2016]. Serology and PCR-tests were performed at the Public Health Agency of Sweden [31 Mar 2016]. Serum samples were PCR-positive as well as positive for IgG and IgM against Lassa virus. Sequencing was consequently performed and confirmed the diagnosis [1 Apr 2016]. The sequence was in agreement with prior reported sequences from Liberia.\n\nThe patient was the same day transferred to a specialized treatment center in Link\u00f6ping University Hospital in appropriate isolation to prevent secondary transmission.\n\nDuring the hospital care up to the diagnosis of Lassa, the patient was in a standard isolation room and cared for by applying proper barrier nursing and infection prevention and control practices. She had no bleeding symptoms and was afebrile during the hospital stay. Her overall status gradually improved, beside neurological signs including hearing loss.\n\nContact tracing among health care workers and family members was initiated [1 Apr 2016] and so far include 75 persons with low-level exposure that have been contacted [4 Apr 2016]. Low-level exposure is defined as being active in patient care or close household contacts. They perform twice a daily temperature control and report in case of symptoms. One patient that shared room during the hospital stay for a few hours is also under surveillance. The additional social and casual contacts have been considered as no risk exposure.\n\nContact tracing and reporting is ongoing and so far no suspected secondary case have been identified.\n\n--\nPeter Ulleryd, MD, PhD for the investigation team\nDept of communicable disease control and prevention\nRegion V\u00e4stra G\u00f6taland\nSweden\n<peter.ulleryd@vgregion.se>\n\n[This report answers some of the questions about this case raised in the previous report. The patient first became ill after her arrival in Sweden. The country where she acquired her infection, given before as West Africa, is now specifically identified as Liberia, a West African country endemic for Lassa virus. Interestingly, there was a previous Lassa fever case imported into Sweden from West Africa (country not specified) in 2011.\n\nLiberia has been the source of an imported Lassa fever case in the past. There was a businessman who acquired his infection there, returned to New Jersey, USA, and died there.\n\nThe case above in Sweden illustrates 3 points: (1) that an accurate travel history is essential to narrow the field of possible diagnoses; (2) provisional diagnosis supported by appropriate laboratory tests is a critical step in arriving at the final diagnosis; and (3) prompt treatment in an isolation unit with proper personal protective equipment is essential to avoid nosocomial infections of health care workers, which has been a significant problem in hospitals in the endemic Lassa virus areas of Africa.\n\nThe patient's observation of rodent excreta in the environment in Liberia is important. The animal reservoir of Lassa virus is a rodent of the genus _Mastomys_, known as the multimammate rat. These rats infected with Lassa virus do not become ill, but they can shed the virus in their urine and feces.

We are making frantic efforts to arrest and bring them back to the hospital before they infect others with the disease.

Person to person transmission is also possible, albeit less common.\n\nFor people witnessing the symptoms, alarm bells may ring and raise fears of Ebola -- but this is not Ebola.\n\nWest Africa as a region is seeing a flare-up of the disease, but Nigeria -- where Lassa fever was first discovered in 1969 -- is experiencing much higher mortality rates than usual.\n\nOn average, Lassa fever is deadly in 1 percent of all individuals infected, with higher rates of 15 percent morbidity among people hospitalized for the illness, but the current outbreak in Nigeria has seen more than 50 percent of those affected dying from their infection.\n\nAccording to NCDC's latest report, dated 14 Mar 2016, the total number of reported cases is 254 (129 of which confirmed by lab tests) and the total number of deaths (suspected, probable and confirmed) is 137, with a case fatality rate (CFR) of 53.9 percent.\n\nA 2012 outbreak of Lassa fever in Nigeria caused more than 1700 people to become infected, but 112 deaths, according to the Nigerian Center for Disease Control (NCDC). Despite lower case numbers, the death toll in the current outbreak are already higher.\n\n'The deaths among cases are higher than normal, and we are currently establishing the reason for this,' says Abdulsalami Nasidi, Director of the NCDC.\n\nA further concern is the geographic spread of the outbreak: 'More states are affected (than usual), and we're evaluating possible reasons,' says Nasidi.\n\nLassa fever outbreaks occur most years in West Africa, as the disease is endemic to Sierra Leone, Liberia, Guinea, and Nigeria.\n\nEach year, the virus infects an estimated 100 000-300 000 and is responsible for 5000 deaths in the region as a whole.\n\nLassa virus is in the same family of viruses as Ebola and Marburg virus, which also cause fever and sometimes haemorrhage. [This is not correct. Lassa fever virus is an arenavirus and Ebola and Marburg viruses are filoviruses. - Mod.TY]. The virus is named after the Nigerian town of Lassa where it was first discovered.\n\nOutbreaks generally occur during the region's dry season -- typically between November to February -- but this time it's persisting. Officials are speculating on the reasons for the increased mortality and spread, but the truth remains unknown. 'Viruses change over time,' says Nasidi.\n\nOne theory officials are suggesting for the spread of the virus into new states, is that there may be better awareness of symptoms after the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa, which has infected more than 28 000 people. Previously, infections often went unreported as the disease mainly affects rural areas where populations can be highly infected, but don't notify the authorities.\n\nThe main culprit behind the transmission of Lassa fever is the 'multimammate rat' -- a reservoir for the virus with the ability to spread it to humans. Touching, consuming, or inhaling, the urine or feces of a rat carrying the virus is the prime route of infection in humans. This generally happens through contaminated food and surfaces within people's homes -- particularly during the dry season.\n\n'When the rains are over, the rats then come closer to humans to steal grains,' says David Heymann, Professor of Infectious Disease Epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. In rural areas, communities often store grains in their homes after the harvest to get them through the dry season. 'They [the rodents] urinate and defecate on the rice, which makes the uncooked rice a source of human infection,' says Heymann. The meat of rodents is often eaten in the region, further increasing the likelihood of transmission.\n\nContact with the bodily fluids, or tissues, of another human carrying the virus is also a mode of transmission, but more rare.\n\nThe symptoms of the disease are wide-ranging and vary from mild to severe in different cases, making diagnosis a challenge.\n\nOne in 5 of those infected will experience symptoms including haemorrhage, respiratory problems, and facial swelling, especially if diagnosed late with the disease, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The remaining 80 percent experience much milder symptoms such as fever and weakness, which can often go undiagnosed. Up to 1/3 of people infected also risk losing their hearing.\n\nTreatment is available with the antiviral drug ribavirin, but this has its greatest effect if used early.\n\nThe NCDC and Ministry of Health have increased resources to handle the outbreak, such as mapping those at most risk, improving access to diagnostics and engaging with communities to recognize the signs and symptoms. 'Every life counts and every case must be investigated,' says Nasidi.\n\nGiven the increased mortality, the priority is prevention. This includes reducing the chances of contact between humans and rat colonies.\n\nSales of rat poison in Nigeria have boomed since the outbreak was announced, according to reports by the news service AFP.\n\nAs with Ebola, awareness and increased use of personal protective equipment when handling patients is also crucial to prevent human to human transmission, particularly in health clinics. 'The government has made the right recommendations about infection control in health facilities...the virus is passed from person to person by poor infection control,' says Heymann.\n\nAs outbreaks are somewhat regular, health officials are still hopeful the current spike in infections will come to a natural end. 'From past experiences we expect numbers to start decreasing in March/April,' says Nasidi.\n\n[Byline: Meera Senthilingam]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Kunihiko Iizuka\n\n[The number of Lassa fever deaths in Nigeria has increased from 63 as of week 7 (week ending 19 Feb 2016) to 130 reported above. The reason for the higher than usual number of fatal cases is undetermined. One possibility is an increase in the populations of multimammate mice (_Mastomys_ spp.), with increase numbers of virus carriers, due to more favorable environmental conditions for them. This could result in more contamination of the environment with virus-containing excreta from these rodents. Public education is an important measure to prevent infections in the home.

Though first described in the 1950s, the virus causing the disease was not identified until 1969. The virus is a single-stranded RNA virus belonging to the virus family _Arenaviridae_. Lassa fever is known to be endemic in Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone, and parts of Nigeria but probably exists in other West African countries as well. About 80 percent of human infections are asymptomatic; the remaining cases have severe multisystem disease, where the virus affects several organs in the body, such as the liver, spleen, and kidneys. The incubation period of Lassa fever ranges from 6-21 days.\n\n'Lassa fever is a zoonotic disease. The animal reservoir of Lassa virus is a rodent of the genus _Mastomys_, commonly known as the 'multimammate rat.' _Mastomys_ infected with Lassa virus do not become ill, but they can shed the virus in their urine and faeces. (An image of a multimammate rats can be viewed at http://www.360nobs.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Lassa-Fever..-Rats.jpg.)\n\n'Lassa fever can affect all age groups.

The patient passed away on [26 Feb 2016] following multi-organ failure. Autopsy findings were suggestive of haemorrhagic fever, and Lassa fever diagnosis was confirmed on [9 Mar 2016] at the Bernhard Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine in Hamburg, Germany.\n\nThe secondary case is a funeral home employee who handled the primary case's corpse on [2 Mar 2016]. The patient is reported to have worn gloves and does not recall being exposed to bodily fluids. Following the primary case's diagnosis, he had been under home quarantine since [9 Mar 2016]. He already had had symptoms of an upper respiratory infection when he had contact with the corpse. Symptoms waxed and waned over the following days. The 1st laboratory test for Lassa fever on [10 Mar 2016] was negative by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). When symptoms persisted, diagnostics were repeated and Lassa fever infection was confirmed by PCR on [15 Mar 2016]. The patient has been transported to a special isolation unit in Frankfurt. He has no history of travel in the 21 days prior to the illness. 4 of his family members have voluntarily agreed to be quarantined in the same isolation unit. Further investigations are ongoing.\n\nPublic health response\nFollowing laboratory confirmation of Lassa fever in the index case, 52 contacts have been identified and are currently under follow up. All contacts are either health care personnel or funeral home employees. For 38 of these contacts, the maximum incubation period (21 days) expired on [19 Mar 2016]. All contacts of the secondary case are also being followed up.\n\nWHO risk assessment\nCases of Lassa fever have already been imported from West Africa to Europe. However, it is the 1st time that secondary transmission of the infection is reported in Europe. Risk for further transmission of Lassa fever in Germany is considered to be low and limited to hospital settings caring for the cases, with all contacts accounted for and monitored. WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conduct risk assessments based on the latest available information.\n\nWHO advice\nThe secondary case identified in Germany underlines the need for all countries to ensure the application of standard infection prevention and control precautions when caring for patients, regardless of their presumed diagnosis. These include basic hand hygiene, respiratory hygiene, use of personal protective equipment (to block splashes or other contact with infected materials), safe injection practices, and safe burial practices.\n\nWHO does not recommend any restriction of travel and trade to Germany based on the information available.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail rapporteur Marianne Hopp\n\n******\n[2] Togo - WHO\nDate: Wed 23 Mar 2016\nSource: WHO Emergencies preparedness, response, Disease Outbreak News (DONs) [edited]\nhttp://www.who.int/csr/don/23-march-2016-lassa-fever-togo/en/\n\n\nLassa fever - Togo\n------------------\nOn 25 Jan 2016, the National IHR Focal Point of Benin notified WHO of an outbreak of Lassa fever.\n\nDetails of the cases\nThe 1st case was a 47 year old, non-national, male health care professional who worked in Sansann\u00e9-Mango, Savanes Region in the north of Togo. The patient developed diarrhoea, vomiting, and fever on [12 Feb 2016] and was treated for malaria. On [26 Feb 2016], he was medically evacuated with a diagnosis of malaria to Cologne, Germany, where he died of multi-organ failure within hours of arrival. He had no history of travel in the 21 days prior to the onset of symptoms. On [9 Mar 2016], postmortem diagnosis of Lassa fever was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing at the Bernhard Nocht Institute (BNI) in Hamburg, Germany.\n\nThe 2nd case is a 33 year old, non-national, male health care professional who provided care to the confirmed case above. On [5 Mar 2016], he developed signs and symptoms similar to those of case 1. On [9 Mar 2016], the patient was isolated in the same hospital. He was later medically evacuated to the United States of America, arriving in Atlanta on [12 Mar 2016]. The patient has no history of travel in the 21 days prior to the onset of symptoms. He tested positive for Lassa fever by PCR on [12 Mar 2016] at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The patient has been under treatment since his arrival on US soil. Currently, he is in stable condition in isolation.\n\nPublic health response\nThe Ministry of Health of Togo is carrying out outbreak investigation and response activities, with the support of WHO and the US CDC. Conducted activities include the review of cases under management at the affected health facility in Togo. Community mobilization and disease awareness campaigns at various levels are also ongoing. Contact tracing and follow-up are being performed. As of [18 Mar 2016], contacts were being monitored in Togo (n=13), Germany (n=52) and US (n=1). The WHO and CDC web pages for Lassa fever have been updated and the CDC website has been translated in French.\n\nWHO risk assessment\nThe affected area in Togo borders with Benin, which has been experiencing a Lassa fever outbreak since December 2015. Furthermore, intense cross-border movement of local populations is reported between the 2 countries. It is, therefore, not possible to exclude a spread of the outbreak from Benin to Togo.\n\nPreliminary sequencing information indicate that the virus incriminated in Togo is a new basal lineage not related to Nigeria, a Lassa fever affected country, which would be consistent with an autochthonous infection. Further sequencing and epidemiological investigation are ongoing to confirm these findings. WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conduct risk assessments based on the latest available information.\n\nWHO does not recommend any restriction of travel and trade to Togo based on the information available.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail rapporteur Marianne Hopp\n\n[According to the WHO updates, it appears as though there is probably ongoing transmission of Lassa fever in Togo, with the non-national cases serving as the sentinel cases alerting the international public health community of this transmission. The index sentinel case was the individual medically evacuated to Germany who was diagnosed following postmortem studies. He was associated with 2 other cases, one a co-worker in Togo who was medevaced to the USA, and the 2nd, a mortician handling his body following his death.\n\nOver the past several months there has been increased Lassa fever activity in Nigeria and in Benin. As mentioned in the reports above, Togo and Benin share a common border with extensive travel between the countries. Genetic studies on the virus currently circulating in Benin are not presently available to know if the virus isolated from Togo is the same as currently circulating in Benin although the current supposition is that the virus in Togo may be a virus specific to Togo (see Mod.TY's comment below).\n\nThe HealthMap/ProMED map of Germany can be found at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/7446 and of Togo can be found at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/64. - Mod.MPP\n\nIt would not be surprising if the Lassa fever virus isolated in Togo is somewhat distinct. Because the reservoir host is the sedentary multimammate mouse (_Mastomys_ spp.) there is an opportunity for geographic isolation and evolution of genotypes that are somewhat different from other, more distant localities.\n\nVirus transmission can occur in houses, in hospital environments, or laboratories in the absence of adequate infection-control measures. Nosocomial infections can occur in health care centers if barrier nursing practices and use of personal protective equipment are not implemented, as was the situation with the above cases.\n\nPublic education is an important measure to prevent infections in the home, where most infections occur. Infected individuals then transport the virus to hospitals. Preventing entry of rodents into the home and keeping food materials tightly covered are helpful measures to prevent infection. Prevention and control of Lassa fever depend on control of the rodent reservoir, the multimammate mouse (_Mastomys_ spp.), which occurs across Nigeria and beyond. Reduction of populations of this rodent will require active participation at the village level.\n\nImages of _Mastomys_ mice can be seen at http://www.ispot.org.za/node/255877. - Mod.TY]", "summary": "A ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n \n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail rapporteur Marianne Hopp\n\n******\n \n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail rapporteur Marianne Hopp\n\n Source: WHO Emergencies preparedness, response, Disease Outbreak News (DONs) [edited]\nhttp://www.who.int/csr/don/23-march-2016-lassa-fever-germany/en/\n\n\nLassa fever - Germany\n Source: WHO Emergencies preparedness, response, Disease Outbreak News (DONs) [edited]\nhttp://www.who.int/csr/don/23-march-2016-lassa-fever-togo/en/\n\n\nLassa fever - Togo\n \n\nThe secondary case is a funeral home employee who handled the primary case's corpse on [2 Mar 2016].

The deceased had been in contact with Lassa patients in Togo according to the county government Alzey-Worms.\n\nAfter the Lassa virus was detected in the blood of the funeral employee, he was admitted to the Frankfurt University Hospital immediately: 'It would be the 1st case of Lassa virus infection acquired in German,' [see comment below] said virologist Jonas Schmidt-Chanasit of the Bernhard Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine in Hamburg.\n\nLassa fever is known as one of the hemorrhagic fevers, such as Ebola and dengue haemorrhagic fevers. The pathogen can cause fever, headache, muscle pain, ecchymosis, and later, diarrhea and vomiting. In severe cases, it can lead to a state of shock, which can lead to organ failure.\n\nAccording to the Robert Koch Institute, the infection is often mild or without symptoms. According to estimates, 100 000 to 300 000 people are infected each year with the virus, of which one or 2 percent die from the illness. There are no vaccinations to prevent the disease.\n\nIn Germany, 6 imported cases have been reported since 1974. The most recent was a US citizen who died on [26 Feb 2016] in Cologne, who had worked in Togo as a nurse. Only several days after his death was the Lassa virus infection detected.\n\nThe body of the American was brought on [3 Mar 2016] in a special container to Alzey, where it was to be prepared for further transport to Togo, said the county government of Alzey. Six days later, on [9 Mar 2016], the diagnosis of Lassa fever was made at the Cologne University Hospital.\n\nThen, the employees were taken and tested for life-threatening diseases by the Frankfurt competence center. The 1st so-called zero-sample of [10 Mar 2016] showed no evidence of the virus. A 2nd specimen on Tue [15 Mar 2016] was positive for the Lassa fever virus.\n\nThe employees of the funeral home had only one contact with the dead body, according to the county government. By his own account, the infected mortician said that he did not come into contact with body fluids.\n\nAlthough the man's family members did not show any symptoms, they were also hospitalized.\n\nThe Frankfurt University Hospital aims to report on Thursday [17 Mar 2016] in a press conference about the case.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nGerhard Mosbach\nDr.med./Univ.Z\u00fcrich\n<bluesensing@gmail.com>\nand\nAndrea Hartanto\n<Nachtdienst006@gmail.com>\n\n[Reviewing the literature I found one report of probable local transmission of Lassa fever virus resulting from an importation of a case from West Africa to Germany in 2000.

This message is for informational purposes only.\n\nLassa fever is a rare but potentially life-threatening viral hemorrhagic disease. The risk of contamination is low, but can occur if someone comes into contact with an infected person's blood or bodily fluids. Lassa fever cannot be spread through casual contact, including skin to skin contact, without exchange of bodily fluids. Those at highest-risk would be health care workers treating patients in facilities known to have Lassa fever and family members caring for infected patients.\n\nEarly diagnosis and supportive care are essential. You should consult a medical professional if you have been in direct contact with an infected person within the past 3 weeks and have symptoms of Lassa fever, which include: fever, chest, stomach or back pain, cough, vomiting, diarrhea, or mucosal bleeding.

'We've shown that we can handle Ebola and this [Lassa fever] is a lot less communicable.'\n\nLassa fever has been endemic in Africa for many years, with up to 300 000 infections annually. Only about 3 percent presenting symptoms severe enough need hospitalization, Ribner said.\n\nOf those hospitalized, about 20 percent of the cases are fatal, compared with a 70 percent rate for all patients who catch Ebola [virus disease], which is transmitted through blood and bodily fluids.\n\n'With Lassa [fever], most of the people who get it never even know it,' Ribner said.\n\nThe worst Ebola [virus disease] outbreak in recorded history began in West Africa in December 2013, spreading to at least 11 countries on the continent before petering out. In all, more than 11 300 people died, almost all in the 3 worst-affected countries. At its height, the Ebola outbreak sparked fear around the world, prompting governments and businesses to take emergency precautions.\n\nAn outbreak of Lassa fever is now underway in Nigeria, according to the World Health Organization, and it is starting to spread to nearby countries, including Togo.\n\nAccording to a WHO statement, 159 suspected cases of Lassa fever and 82 deaths were reported between August 2015 and January 2016. Some media reports have said as many as 101 people have died as of February [2016].\n\nLike Ebola, Lassa causes a severe fever with bleeding, Ribner said. It is most commonly transmitted to people from rodent excrement, and it can be transmitted from person to person by contact with blood or bodily fluids, Ribner said.\n\nHe said the hospital will take every precaution and that the public should not be alarmed.\n\n'You can't catch it like you get the common cold,' he said. 'We can handle this.'\n\nThe disease [virus] is carried by the _Mastomys natalensis_ rodent [African soft-furred rat or Natal multimammate rat or mouse], found across sub-Saharan Africa, and often eaten as a source of protein. Lassa fever virus infects an estimated 300 000-500 000 people each year, and kills about 5000.\n\n[Byline: Rich McKay, Editing By Frank McGurty, Bernard Orr]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n******\n[3] Nigeria, Bauchi state: new cases\nDate: Fri 11 Mar 2016\nSource: Vanguard [edited]\nhttp://www.vanguardngr.com/2016/03/3-dead-10-infected-in-fresh-bauchi-lassa-fever-outbreak/\n\n\nNo fewer than 3 persons have died from a fresh outbreak of Lassa fever, while 10 members of a family are currently infected with the virus in Bauchi State.\n\nThe Executive Chairman Bauchi State Primary Health Care Development Agency, Ibrahim Gamawa, who said this yesterday [10 Mar 2016] in Bauchi, added that the 10 new cases were recorded in a single family at Jaye village in Tafawa Balewa Local Government Area of the state.

'We then immediately informed the competent authorities, with whom we are now in close coordination' spokesman Timo M\u00fcgge said.\n\nLassa occurs in several countries in West Africa. In Germany, the disease occurs only rarely and manifests when it is introduced by travelers from Africa. According to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI), since October 2011, Germany has reported only 5 cases of the disease.\n\nBoth Nigeria and Benin are experiencing current Lassa fever outbreaks.\n\nAccording to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Lassa fever is an acute viral illness that occurs in West Africa. The virus, a member of the family _Arenaviridae_, is a single-stranded RNA virus and is zoonotic, or animal-borne.\n\nLassa fever is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. While Lassa fever is mild or has no observable symptoms in about 80 percent of people infected with the virus, the remaining 20 percent have a severe multisystem disease.\n\nThe animal host of Lassa virus is a rodent known as the 'multimammate rat' of the genus _Mastomys_. Humans get infected with Lassa through aerosol or direct contact with excreta from the rodent. Laboratory infections do occur primarily through contaminated food materials.\n\nThe symptoms of Lassa fever typically occur 1-3 weeks after the patient comes into contact with the virus.

Some of these cases were evacuated from West Africa for further medical treatment and the overall mortality was 36 per cent (9/28).\n\n'None of the cases were associated with onward transmission to other patients or to fellow travellers, although delays in recognition and isolation of patients continue to occur for a variety of reasons, including failure of patients to report their travel history risks. Other causes of fever in travellers returning from West Africa are much more common, such as malaria, diarrhoeal disease and respiratory infections. However, the recent case of Lassa fever in New Jersey emphasizes the need to consider other viral haemorrhagic fevers in travellers returning from endemic areas of the world and not to focus on Ebola virus disease alone.'\n\nHis comments underscore the importance of good travel histories. They are essential in order to initiate treatment as early in the course of disease as possible.

On 3 Jan [2016], these health workers provided care to a patient suffering from haemorrhagic fever.\n\nBetween 21 Jan and 16 Feb [2016], 71 cases (6 confirmed, 10 probable and 55 suspected) were reported from 7 departments -- namely, Borgou (52), Collines (13), Oueme (2), Alibori (1), Atlantique (1), Kouffo (1) and Littoral (1). During the same period of time, a total of 23 deaths were recorded in the departments of Borgou (16), Collines (4), Atlantique (1), Oueme (1) and Plateau; 7 of the reported cases (3 confirmed, 1 probable and 3 suspected), including 2 deaths (1 confirmed and 1 probable), were health workers.\n\nTo date, 6 cases, including 2 deaths, have been laboratory confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction at the Virology Unit, Central Research Laboratory, Lagos University Teaching Hospital in Lagos, Nigeria.\n\nPublic health response\nThe Ministry of Health of Benin, with the support of WHO and partners, is coordinating the management of the outbreak. Control measures are being implemented, including field investigation, enhanced surveillance, case management, infection prevention and control, contact tracing and follow-up, and social mobilization.\n\nWHO has deployed a multidisciplinary team in the affected areas to support the response. WHO's Regional Office for Africa (WHO/AFRO) has deployed 2 experts and has provided financial support to the country.\n\nSince the beginning of the outbreak, a total of 318 contacts have been identified and 292 are currently under follow-up.\n\nWHO risk assessment\nLassa fever is endemic in neighbouring Nigeria and other West African countries. The disease causes outbreaks almost every year in different parts of Benin, with yearly peaks observed between December and February. Although this is only the 2nd Lassa outbreak reported in Benin, the outbreak is occurring during known seasonal patterns. According to available information, its characteristics are similar to other outbreaks described elsewhere; however, considering seasonal case flare-ups during this time of the year, countries in West Africa endemic for Lassa fever are encouraged to strengthen the related surveillance systems.\n\nWHO does not recommend any restriction of travel and trade to Benin based on the information available.\n\nBackground\nLassa fever is an acute viral haemorrhagic fever illness with an incubation period of 1-4 weeks and is endemic in West Africa. The Lassa virus is transmitted to humans via contact with food or household items contaminated with rodent urine or faeces. Person-to-person infections and laboratory transmission can also occur, particularly in hospitals lacking adequate infection prevent and control measures. The disease is endemic in the rodent population in parts of West Africa. Lassa fever is known to be endemic in Benin (where it was diagnosed for the 1st time in November 2014), Guinea, Liberia, Mali, Sierra Leone and parts of Nigeria, but probably exists in other West African countries as well. The overall case-fatality rate is 1 percent. Observed case-fatality rate among patients hospitalized with severe cases of Lassa fever is 15 percent. Early supportive care with rehydration and symptomatic treatment improves survival.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Public education is an important measure to prevent infections in the home.

Among the deceased, 4 cases of Lassa fever have been confirmed as positive, and 2 persons who contracted the virus are currently under treatment in quarantine isolation centres, the agencies said in a joint press release.\n\nDuring a press statement held on 23 Jan 2016, the national authorities indicated that after the confirmation of the proven case of Lassa fever at the St. Martin Zone Hospital of Papane, in the northern district of Tchaourou, a national technical team was immediately dispatched to the spot.\n\nFollowing the death of a pregnant woman on 5 Jan [2016] at the same hospital, 6 health workers -- 3 nurses, a female laboratory technician and 2 nursing auxiliaries -- developed clinical symptoms of Lassa fever. On 21 Jan [2016], a male nurse, among the suspected cases, died at the Borgou Departmental Hospital of Parakou, located in the central Benin.\n\nIn light of all this, the national authorities supported by WHO and UNICEF and humanitarian partners have set up a response strategy to the epidemic that includes setting up: quarantine units in affected areas to separate suspected cases from others patients and limit the risks of exposure to people; and a tracing system to follow the contact cases in the affected zone. To date, 203 contact cases are spread across 6 communes: Tchaourou, Ouesse, Kalale, Bembereke, Parakou, and Porto-Novo.\n\nAmong other actions, almost 200 community health workers are monitoring the contact cases across the country; supplies of medical stocks (Ribavirin) have been prepositioned in Cotonou and in affected areas; protection kits including personal protection equipment (PPE) for health professional staff, soap, tarpaulins, gloves, boots, glasses and masks, decontamination products, infrared thermometers, and water treatment units have been put at the ready; and the health staff of the affected areas have been trained in the use of protective equipment, on medical protocols, and on the identification and active search of suspected contact cases.\n\nFurther, the agencies noted that sensitization sessions are being organized for the population, and awareness raising communications are being broadcast through local and national media including radio stations, press and TV, as a well as online platforms.\n\nAccording to WHO, Lassa fever is an acute viral haemorrhagic illness caused by Lassa virus, a member of the arenavirus family of viruses. It is transmitted to humans from contact with food or household items contaminated with rodent faeces. The disease is endemic in the rodent population in parts of West Africa. The virus can also be transmitted through contact with an infected person via biological liquids: blood, urine, saliva, sperm, vomit, faeces. The incubation period of the virus is 6- 21 days.\n\nThe 1st symptoms of the disease are fever, physical fatigue, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, headaches, abdominal pains, sore throat. Neck or facial swelling can sometimes be observed. Ribavirin is an efficient treatment to fight the Lassa fever. This drug can treat infected people if it is administered as soon as the 1st signs appear.\n\nThe agencies recommend the following measures to enhance prevention: from the very 1st signs, it is imperative to immediately go to the nearest health centre; wash hands regularly with water and soap; ensure an adequate protection of food stocks and leftovers at home; avoid the manipulation and consumption of rats; avoid contact with any person suspected or confirmed with the Lassa fever; stay away from faeces, urine, saliva, vomit and contaminated objects of a person suspected, confirmed or declared dead of Lassa fever; do not touch the body of a person suspected of having died from the Lassa fever, even during funerary ceremonies.\n\nBenin was hit by a Lassa fever outbreak between October 2014 and January 2015. At that time, 16 cases were registered, and 9 people died. Among the casualties, 2 were confirmed to be from Lassa fever. Relevant authorities declared the end of the epidemic per international sanitary regulations, which recommend the observance of 2 periods of 21 days during which no new case is registered.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n[In Benin, the number of suspected cases is from 20 to 25 and deaths from 9 to 12, with 4 confirmed cases since 3 Feb 2016 (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20160206.3999178). It is tragic that 6 health care workers in the hospital were infected. The response strategy set up by the national authorities supported by WHO and UNICEF and humanitarian partners should prevent similar exposures as well as track down any cases involving people exposed to infected individuals. Since the virus is endemic in Benin and cases have occurred there in previous years, one hopes that the response strategy will continue on into the future, when new cases will doubtless appear, after the current outbreak has ended.\n\nThe virus is a member of the family _Arenaviridae_ and causes acute hemorrhagic fever.

Among the deceased, 4 cases of Lassa fever have been confirmed as positive, and 2 persons who contracted the virus are currently under treatment in quarantine isolation centres, the agencies said in a joint press release. Following the death of a pregnant woman on 5 Jan [2016] at the same hospital, 6 health workers -- 3 nurses, a female laboratory technician and 2 nursing auxiliaries -- developed clinical symptoms of Lassa fever. Since the virus is endemic in Benin and cases have occurred there in previous years, one hopes that the response strategy will continue on into the future, when new cases will doubtless appear, after the current outbreak has ended. During a press statement held on 23 Jan 2016, the national authorities indicated that after the confirmation of the proven case of Lassa fever at the St. Martin Zone Hospital of Papane, in the northern district of Tchaourou, a national technical team was immediately dispatched to the spot. The response strategy set up by the national authorities supported by WHO and UNICEF and humanitarian partners should prevent similar exposures as well as track down any cases involving people exposed to infected individuals. \n\nThe virus is a member of the family _Arenaviridae_ and causes acute hemorrhagic fever. On 21 Jan [2016], a male nurse, among the suspected cases, died at the Borgou Departmental Hospital of Parakou, located in the central Benin. The virus can also be transmitted through contact with an infected person via biological liquids: blood, urine, saliva, sperm, vomit, faeces.

Lassa fever is now a serious problem in 23 of the 36 states of that country.'\n\nLFV can be transmitted from person to person through contact with an infected individual's viremic blood in the absence of adequate personal protective equipment. Several cases of transmission have occurred in hospitals.\n\nAs the late Mod.CP pointed out in his comment in archived posting 20130131.1524034: 'In the countries of Africa, such as Nigeria, where Lassa fever is endemic, the disease is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. While Lassa fever infection is normally mild or has no observable symptoms in about 80 per cent of people infected with the virus, the remaining 20 per cent have a severe, multisystem disease. Rarely, Lassa fever is associated with epidemics, during which the case-fatality rate can reach 50 per cent. There is no preventative vaccine or treatment.

Speaking to State House correspondents at the presidential villa on [Wed 20 Jan 2016], the minister cited the case of Ebonyi State, which had so far recorded about 5 cases of Lassa fever but never cared to report [to] his ministry for necessary action.\n\nThe minister denied that cases of Lassa fever were hidden, but admitted they were not brought to the public knowledge until it became late. His words, 'Not that they were hidden but they were never brought to public knowledge. There is also what we can consider to be culture of silence in some of our states. For example, we recognised Ebonyi State as one of the endemic states.\n\n'And since the outbreak, Ebonyi has not recorded a single case or reported a single case. We dispatched our surveillance team to Ebonyi and we discovered 5 cases. We are not having a resurgence. What we had over the years is a situation which Lassa is endemic in Nigeria. And as I said on numerous occasions, we have these outbreaks. In 2012, we had the highest. We had 1700 case and that declined. Last year [2015], we had 441 cases. And what has happened is that for the 1st time in the history of the country, we are being transparent and open and we are telling the entire world what the situation is and that is what is different. We are also concerned. We want to find out why we are still having this Lassa fever in spite of human and material resources that we have in this country. We inaugurated a Lassa fever eradication committee chaired by one of the foremost virologists in this country and we are committed to signing the obituary of the Lassa fever this year [2016].'\n\nExplaining why the war against Lassa fever may not be fought the way the country tackled Ebola, the minister said the source of Ebola in Nigeria was traced to one person that imported it into the country. According to him, 'We cannot win the battle against Lassa fever the same way we won the one against Ebola. Ebola happened to be a single importation to Nigeria. Lassa fever is endemic in Nigeria. In 2012, we had upsurge in 26 states. So, it is there but I can assure you that with what we put in place this year [2016], we will sign it off.'\n\nHe said the federal government was determined to get to the root of the issue saying, 'What we want to do is put across some innovative funding mechanisms, ability to manage and put to use 10 000 primary health care centres across the country over the next 2 years. In the next 100 days, we will flag off 110 of these centres. 'We will start with the one in Fuka where we first had this outbreak. We will do one per senatorial district, 109 to make 110 in 100 days.

Lassa fever has sickened at least 57 people and killed 34 since it broke out in Nigeria late last year [2015].\n\nThe disease is transmitted by rats [multimammate mice, [_Mastomys_ spp.], and in its later stages shares symptoms with Ebola, which killed over 11 000 people in West Africa after it broke out in 2013. Lassa fever, which is named after a town in Nigeria's northeastern Borno State, sickens people who come into contact with rat excrement. Symptoms in the early stage include headache and fever, while in later stages people can bleed from their mouth and other orifices.\n\nThe fever broke out in parts of the country's north, before spreading south to the commercial capital Lagos and to Edo and Akwa Ibom states in the Niger Delta.\n\nHassan Garba, a hospital director in the northern city of Bauchi, blamed the transportation of crops for the spread of the disease. 'When you're moving food material like grains from the north to the south or the east or to the west of the country, you most probably may be moving with rats who can hide among shipments,' said Garba.\n\nThat's led to a run on supplies of rat poison in cities across the north. In Kaduna, [a resident] said he wasn't taking any chances at home. 'This fever brought by rat, so that is why I'm rushing to the market and I'll buy... rat medicine in order to kill all the rat that is in my house,' he said. A merchant said his supplies of the poison were exhausted. 'People are rushing the rat poison now. I don't even have enough to sell,' he said.\n\nBut the director of the Kaduna state ministry of health Ado Zakari Mohammed warned people to be cautious with the poison, which is deadly to humans.\n\n[Byline: Chris Stein]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[2] Nigeria (Lafia, Nasarawa state)\nDate: Sat 30 Jan 2016\nSource: Vanguard [edited]\nhttp://www.vanguardngr.com/2016/01/605552/\n\n\nA medical [doctor] in Dalhatu Specialist Hospital (DASH) Lafia, has been confirmed dead after treating a patient with Lassa fever in the only specialist hospital owned by the state.\n\nThe death of the medical doctor brings the toll to 2, while scores are hospitalized, mostly in Lafia.\n\n[The doctor] was among the members of the rescue team in DASH, He has since been buried according to Islamic injunction.\n\nConsequently, medical personnel from DASH Lafia have decided to join the ongoing strike action leaving the state grounded.\n\nDr Edego Egba, the chairman of the medical advisory committee of the hospital confirmed this to selected journalists.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[3] Nigeria (Jigawa state)\nDate: Thu 28 Jan 2016\nSource: 360 nobs [edited]\nhttp://www.360nobs.com/2016/01/lassa-fever-kills-1-26-surveillance-jigawa/\n\n\nAuthorities of Jigawa state have confirmed the outbreak of Lassa fever in the state as one person has been reported dead with over 26 other persons who had contact with the deceased currently under surveillance.\n\nCommissioner of Health, Dr Abba Zakari, while confirming the sad development, stated that the victim, who resided at Gujubaki village in Dutse Local Government area of the state had just returned from Port Harcourt in Rivers State and reported to Dutse General Hospital with signs and symptoms suggestive to Lassa fever.\n\nThe commissioner said that the state ministry of health was contacted immediately after the hospital management noticed the case, adding that the ministry without further ado sent its Rapid Response Team, RRT, which consisted of 3 doctors, disease notification officers (DNOs), and an epidemiologist to examine the victim and take a sample of his blood.\n\nAccording to him, the blood sample of the victim was taken to a laboratory in Abuja where it was confirmed positive.

However, the recent case of Lassa fever in New Jersey emphasizes the need to consider other viral haemorrhagic fevers in travellers returning from endemic areas of the world and not to focus on Ebola virus disease alone.\n\n[References cited:]\n1.

Kennedy International Airport [New York, NY] 17 May [2015], flying from Liberia via Morocco. He had no fever or symptoms during the flight, nor when he was screened at the airport upon arrival.\n\nThe next day, however, he went to an unnamed hospital in New Jersey complaining of a sore throat, fever and fatigue. When asked about his recent travel history -- a common question in wake of ongoing fears about the Ebola virus -- he did not reveal his recent visit to Liberia, according to the CDC.\n\nHe was treated and released, but returned to the hospital last Thursday, 21 May [2015], because his symptoms had worsened. He was transferred to an unnamed facility designed to treat viral hemorrhagic fevers and specimens were submitted to the CDC for testing.\n\nThe test results, available Monday morning [25 May 2015], confirmed Lassa Fever but were negative for Ebola and other viruses.\n\nThe patient died Monday evening, according to the CDC. Throughout his treatment he was in 'appropriate isolation.'\n\nThis is just the 6th case of Lassa [fever] in the United States since the virus was discovered in Nigeria in 1969. The last case here was in Minnesota, in 2014. There has never been a person-to-person transmission of the disease in the United States, according to the CDC.\n\nWhile Lassa fever and Ebola originate in roughly the same part of West Africa, they vary greatly in how contagious they are and how deadly. Ebola can be spread from person to person via contaminated bodily fluids and has a fatality rate approaching 70 percent, according to the CDC.\n\nLassa, however, has a fatality rate of 1 percent. The illness can be quite severe in about 20 percent of patients, and it routinely kills about 5000 West Africans every year. The virus is named for the locale where it was first located. It is a zoonotic virus -- meaning it is spread by animals. It is most often spread to people when they come in contact with rat droppings.\n\n'In rare cases it can be transmitted from person to person through direct contact with a sick person's blood or bodily fluids, through mucous membranes, or through sexual contact,' the CDC indicated in its announcement Monday night. 'The virus is not transmitted through casual contact, and patients are not believed to be infectious before the onset of symptoms.'\n\nCDC officials are now working with local health workers to compile a list of anyone who may have had close contact with the deceased. They will be monitored for 21 days to see if they develop any symptoms.\n\n[Byline: Kathleen O'Brien]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[2]\nDate: Tue 26 May 2015\nSource: New York Times [edited]\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/27/us/new-jersey-lassa-fever-death-prompts-cdc-action.html?_r=1\n\n\nA team of federal disease experts is in New Jersey working with hospitals that treated a man who died from Lassa fever Monday night [25 May 2015], as health officials in that state worked to identify and track people who came into contact with him.\n\nThe team, from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, includes experts on Lassa fever, infection control, occupational health, and lab and waste management, said a spokesman, Thomas Skinner. The patient, who has not been identified, had come from Liberia earlier this month [May 2015].\n\nThe New Jersey Health Department said the patient had been 55 [years old], and referred to him as 'an Essex County man.' The department did not say whether he was an American citizen, but said he had been 'returning' to the United States from Liberia.\n\nIn a statement, the state epidemiologist, Dr. Tina Tan, said, 'Given what we know about how Lassa virus spreads to people, we think the risk to the public is extremely low.'\n\nLassa fever is a viral disease common in West Africa but rarely seen in the United States. It can have symptoms similar to Ebola -- diarrhea, vomiting and bleeding -- but is less infectious [contagious] and far less likely to be fatal. About 1 per cent of Lassa patients die, compared with about 70 per cent of Ebola patients.\n\nThe patient, who was not identified, traveled from Liberia to Morocco and arrived at John F. Kennedy International Airport on 17 May [2015]. The patient did not have a fever on departure from Liberia, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said, or any other symptoms. When he arrived in the United States, his temperature was taken and he again did not have a fever.\n\nThe patient was placed under active monitoring starting on 18 May 2015, the day he came into the hospital reporting symptoms, Mr. Skinner said. Under active monitoring, local health workers contact patients to ask about symptoms and temperature. The health department reached a person listed as the man's emergency contact on 19, 20 and 21 May, and he did not report elevated temperatures, the department said. The patient was hospitalized on 22 May.\n\nThe man had a job in the mining industry that took him to Liberia numerous times a year, health officials said. Mines are located in remote, rural areas, where Lassa fever tends to be present.\n\nA spokeswoman for the New Jersey Health Department, Donna Leusner, said the patient died at 8:45 p.m. on Monday [25 May 2015]. She did not say which hospital had treated him.\n\nThe 6-member C.D.C. team arrived on Tuesday morning and is overseeing work at the hospitals, including helping hospital officials identify which, if any, health care workers should be monitored for symptoms. State and local health care workers in New Jersey are tracing the patient's contacts outside the hospital.\n\nIt was unclear whether the patient lied about his symptoms, or simply did not experience any in the days between his 1st visit to the hospital and when he was admitted on 22 May. Unlike people with Ebola [virus disease], in which symptoms tend to be constant after they 1st appear, patients infected with Lassa fever [virus] may have symptoms that ebb and flow, for example a temperature that appears one day but not the next.\n\nThe federal disease centers have been in the process of updating health guidance for Liberia since changing that country's classification on 13 May [2015] to a country with 'former widespread transmission' of Ebola [virus disease]. The World Health Organization declared Liberia free of Ebola [virus disease] on 9 May, and the federal agency was trying to account for that. It said that current guidance will continue to apply, until an update is posted.\n\nOn 4 May [2015], the C.D.C. downgraded its travel risk alert for Liberia to level 2, meaning that the agency was no longer recommending that Americans avoid nonessential travel to that country. But it continues to recommend that travelers practice 'enhanced precautions' when traveling to Liberia.\n\nAccording to the agency, the case in New Jersey is the 6th known occurrence of Lassa fever in travelers returning to the United States since 1969; 2 other cases became known only after the patients had already recovered. The last known case was reported in Minnesota in 2014.\n\nThere has never been person-to-person transmission of Lassa fever documented in the United States, the C.D.C. said. The virus is not transmitted through casual contact, and the disease is not believed to be contagious before the onset of symptoms. About 100 000 to 300 000 cases of Lassa fever, and 5000 deaths related to the illness, occur in West Africa each year.\n\nIn West Africa, Lassa virus is carried by rodents and transmitted to humans through contact with urine or droppings of infected rodents, officials say. In rare cases it can be transmitted through direct contact with a sick person's blood bodily fluids or mucous membranes, or through sexual contact.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nSukie Crandall\n<sukie@mac.com>\n\n[Lassa fever virus (LFV) is endemic in West Africa, including Liberia, and multi-mammate mice (_Mastomys_ spp.) are the rodent hosts. Lassa fever cases have been reported sporadically in Liberia. The Lassa fever belt in Liberia primarily occupies Lofa, Bong and Nimba Counties across the northern tier of counties bordering Guinea. The last outbreak in Liberia posted on ProMED-mail (archive no. 20140328.2363217) was in 2014, citing a report from the CDC. On that occasion, the Ministry of Health (MOH) of Liberia notified WHO of an outbreak of Lassa fever in a UN Mission in Liberia Kakata camp, Margibi County. A total of 14 cases including 1 death were reported from 27 Feb 2014 to 10 Mar 2014. The last case of Lassa fever contracted in Liberia with death occurring in the USA, coincidentally also in New Jersey, was in 2004. The current case, reported above, illustrates the importance of obtaining an accurate travel history. Apparently, in this case above, the patient failed to report that he had been in Liberia, which likely delayed his hospitalization and treatment.\n\nThe virus is a member of the family _Arenaviridae_ and causes acute hemorrhagic fever.

The state chapter of the Nigerian Medical Association, NMA, last Thursday [15 May 2014] announced that 11 doctors and 5 nurses had contracted the disease after participating in a clinical operation on a pregnant woman in the hospital.\n\nThe state NMA chairman, Chidi Esike, told journalists at a news conference in Abakaliki that the woman and her baby died a few days after they were discharged from the hospital.\n\nMr Esike also said that the state had recorded 25 deaths due to Lassa fever since 2005, adding that many of them were medical personnel.\n\nCommenting on the development, the commissioner said: 'No life was lost except for the pregnant woman and her baby through whom the health workers contracted the disease. The 16 patients were rushed to Irrua when they were discovered to be resistant to malaria fever treatment, and 6 of them have been confirmed positive through a laboratory test. They are now undergoing intensive care treatment, and they are all stable. But I want to say that not every case of resistance to malaria fever treatment is a Lassa fever case, he said.\n\nMr Nwangele said that the joint committee set up by the state Ministry of Health and FETHA on Lassa fever had evolved a 2-way approach for treatment of the disease. According to him, the method involves short and long-term control measures. 'On the short-term approach, the suspected patient is administered with prophylaxis tablets, while on the long-term control, the patient that is clinically down receives injectable drugs. The state government is partnering with FETHA on the short-term control method, while government has in this regard donated tablets and personal protection equipment to affected patients. The state would not accept being an endemic state and has mapped out land for the construction of a virology laboratory in Abakaliki,' he said.\n\nMr Nwangele noted that most of the Lassa fever cases in the area were imported, and manifested in the form of 'operateable cases.' He said that the pregnant woman through whom the health workers contracted the disease was not from the state.

It was gathered that the doctor became infected after he treated a patient with Lassa fever virus.\n\nExecutive chairman of the agency, Dr Nisser Ali Umar, while briefing newsmen yesterday as part of the sensitization exercise embarked upon to educate citizens on the dangers of the disease, said: 'The disease is deadly and infectious. Recently, a medical doctor got infected by the disease after treating a patient who had the fever.

A disease anywhere can appear anywhere else in the world within hours,' said CDC Director Tom Frieden, M.D., M.P.H.\n\nLassa fever is a severe viral disease that is common in West Africa but rarely seen in the United States. A total of 7 other Lassa fever cases, all travel related, have been identified in the United States, with the last one reported in Pennsylvania in 2010. Although Lassa fever can produce hemorrhagic symptoms in infected persons, the disease is not related to Ebola hemorrhagic fever, which is responsible for the current outbreak in West Africa.\n\nIn West Africa, Lassa virus is carried by rodents and transmitted to humans through contact with urine or droppings of infected rodents. In rare cases it can be transmitted from person to person through direct contact with a sick person's blood or bodily fluids, through mucous membrane, or through sexual contact. The virus is not transmitted through casual contact. About 100 000 to 300 000 cases of Lassa fever, and 5000 deaths related to Lassa fever, occur in West Africa each year.\n\nCDC is working with public health officials and airlines to determine the patient's travel route from West Africa and identify any passengers or others who may have had close contact with the infected person. Preliminary information indicates that the patient flew from West Africa to New York City and caught another flight to Minneapolis.\n\n'Given what we know about how Lassa virus is spread to people, the risk to other travelers and members of the public is extremely low,' said Martin Cetron, M.D., M.P.H., director of CDC's Division of Global Migration and Quarantine.\n\n'Casual contact is not a risk factor for getting Lassa fever,' said Barbara Knust, D.V.M., M.P.H., an epidemiologist in CDC's Division of High-Consequence Pathogens and Pathology, which performed the laboratory testing. 'People will not get this infection just because they were on the same airplane or in the same airport.'\n\nAs part of its investigation, CDC is working with the airlines to gather contact information for passengers and crew who were seated near the infected individual.

In the above case, the Minnesota hospital provided sufficient containment that no secondary cases occurred there. The West African country where the patient might have acquired the infection is not mentioned.\n\nIn endemic areas in West Africa, the rodent reservoirs are multimammate mice (_Mastomys_ spp.).

This is the 4th report of cases of Lassa fever virus for Nigeria in 2014 that ProMED-mail has posted. Cases have occurred sporadically in Liberia and this is the 1st report for 2014. Mod.CP provided an excellent summary of Lassa fever (ProMED-mail archive no. 20130911.1937742): 'Lassa fever is an acute viral illness that occurs in West Africa. The cause of the illness was found to be Lassa virus, named after the town in Nigeria where the 1st cases originated. The virus, a member of the virus family _Arenaviridae_, is a single-stranded RNA virus and is zoonotic, or animal-borne. Lassa fever is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. While Lassa fever is mild or has no observable symptoms in about 80 percent of people infected with the virus, the remaining 20 percent have a severe multisystem disease. Lassa fever is an endemic disease in portions of West Africa. It is recognized in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone as well as Nigeria. However, because the rodent species which carry the virus are found throughout West Africa, the actual geographic range of the disease may extend to other countries in the region. Individuals at risk are those who live in or visit areas with a high population of _Mastomys_ rodents infected with Lassa virus or are exposed to infected humans.\n\n'Primary transmission of the Lassa virus to humans can be prevented by avoiding contact with _Mastomys_ rodents, especially in the geographic regions where outbreaks occur. Storing food away in rodent-proof containers and keeping living areas clean help to discourage rodents from entering homes. When caring for patients with Lassa fever, further transmission of the disease through person-to-person contact or nosocomial routes can be avoided by taking preventive precautions against contact with patient secretions (together called VHF [viral hemorrhagic fever] isolation precautions or barrier nursing methods) [http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvrd/spb/mnpages/vhfmanual.htm]. Such precautions include wearing protective clothing, such as masks, gloves, gowns, and goggles; using infection control measures, such as complete equipment sterilization; and isolating infected patients from contact with unprotected persons until the disease has run its course. The disease can be treated.\n\n'Signs and symptoms of Lassa fever typically occur 1-3 weeks after the patient comes into contact with the virus. These include fever, retrosternal pain (pain behind the chest wall), sore throat, back pain, cough, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, conjunctivitis, facial swelling, proteinuria (protein in the urine), and mucosal bleeding. Neurological problems have also been described, including hearing loss, tremors, and encephalitis. Because the symptoms of Lassa fever are so varied and nonspecific, clinical diagnosis is often difficult. The anti-viral drug ribavirin can be used in treatment of severe cases. Currently, there is no protective vaccine.'\n\nA HealthMap of Nigeria can be accessed at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/62 and of Liberia at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/54. - Mod.TY\n\nThe 2-fold difference between the CFR in Nigeria for 2012 & 2013 could be explained by the possibility that a smaller proportion of the suspect cases in 2013 were actually Lassa fever, with the rest being due to other causes.

The commissioner explained that these symptoms prompted the medical personnel to send his blood specimen to the Lassa fever diagnostic centre at Irua in Edo, where he was confirmed positive to Lassa infection.\n\nMr Akabe explained that the hospital did its best to quickly isolate and treat him, and he became fairly stable until Tuesday [7 Jan 2014] when he died. He disclosed that a blood specimen taken from the victim's wife and others who had close contact with him was sent for examination, and all came out negative.\n\nThe commissioner said a team of medical personnel had been deployed to the Bukan Sidi area of the town, where the deceased resided, with a view to educating the people about Lassa fever. He said that the ministry had commenced a sensitisation programme in Lafia and its environs, educating the people to look out for such symptoms to quickly save lives, saying early detection of the disease would guarantee proper management and treatment.\n\n'If the deceased had reported early enough to the hospital, the situation would not have gotten this bad. He came to the hospital at the bleeding stage of the disease,' Mr Akabe said.\n\nThe commissioner, therefore, charged members of the public to shun self-medication but to visit the nearest hospital for proper medical attention in order to stay alive. He also encouraged the people to properly cook and cover their food as well as maintain good environmental habits that would keep rodents, 'which are the major agents of Lassa fever, away from sources of food.'\n\nOn the need to have a Lassa fever diagnostic centre in the state, Mr Akabe said that, considering the capital intensive nature of such centres, it would be difficult to establish for now. He noted that there were only 2 of such centres in the country at present. He recalled that the federal government through the Ministry of Health in 2013 promised to establish a Lassa fever diagnostic centre in each of the geopolitical zones, considering the recurrent outbreak of the disease and its fatality rate in parts of the country. Mr Akabe, therefore, appealed to the federal government to expedite action on the plan to establish such centres, saying, 'it will go a long way to save more lives through early detection and treatment.'\n\nThe commissioner said that the state government was working in collaboration with an organisation in the USA with the aim of establishing a research institute in Lafia to handle issues related to diagnosis and treatment of viral diseases, including Lassa fever, TB and HIV/AIDS, among others. He explained that the project was expected to be funded by the USA, adding that a Memorandum of Understanding will soon be signed to that effect.\n\nThe victim was a civil servant who worked in the office of the deputy governor, Dameshi Luka.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Nigeria's latest Weekly Epidemiology Report dated 3 Jan 2014 covers the last week (52) of 2013.

The illness was discovered in 1969 when two missionary nurses died in Nigeria, West Africa. The cause of the illness was found to be Lassa virus, named after the town in Nigeria where the first cases originated. Lassa virus, a member of the virus family _Arenaviridae_, is a single-stranded RNA virus and is zoonotic, or animal-borne. Lassa fever is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. While Lassa fever is mild or has no observable symptoms in about 80 percent of people infected with the virus, the remaining 20 percent have severe multisystem disease. Lassa fever is also associated with occasional epidemics, during which the case-fatality rate can reach 50 percent.\n\nThe reservoir, or host, of Lassa virus is a rodent known as the 'multimammate rat' of the genus _Mastomys_. It is not certain which [of the 8] species of _Mastomys_ are associated with Lassa fever; however, at least 2 species carry the virus in Sierra Leone. _Mastomys_ rodents breed very frequently, produce large numbers of offspring, and are numerous in the savannas and forests of West, Central, and East Africa. In addition, _Mastomys_ generally readily colonize human homes. All these factors together contribute to the relatively efficient spread of Lassa virus from infected rodents to humans.\n\nLassa fever may also spread through person-to-person contact.

Dr. Arzuakoi said 6 of the victims died at hospitals in Bong, and the rest, who contracted the disease in Gbarnga, died at the Jackson Fiah Doe hospital in Tappita, Nimba County after travelling for treatment. He said the Ministry has already taken measures to stop the spread of the epidemic and would embark on sensitization campaigns and immunisation[?] in the county.\n\nExplaining more on the dreaded fever and its dangers to humans, Arzuakoi said the disease was transmitted by a specific rat which had no hair on its tail. Arzuakoi said the symptoms of Lassa fever include severe headache, high fever and vomiting [and bleeding?] that passes through all the openings in the human body. He advised persons with such symptoms to rush to the nearest hospital for medical attention. 'The epidemic is in Bong,' Arzuakoi warns citizens.\n\nLassa fever has over the years risen to be a quiet killer with victims ignorant of its presence, according to him. Cases of infection, he said, have been reported in Gbarnga, Suakoko and other parts of Bong. 'This Lassa fever thing has been reported in other areas in the county for a while now,' he said. He said the rat, which lives in and around many homes in Africa, has been identified as the carrier of the virus.\n\nWhen the Ministry of Health deployed medical experts some weeks ago to Bong, many would have assumed it was for some common epidemic that was ravaging the county's 13 administrative districts. Such supposition would be wrong because the speedy deployment of these health experts was to control the outbreak of Lassa fever.

The cause of the illness was found to be Lassa virus, named after the town in Nigeria where the 1st cases originated. The virus, a member of the virus family _Arenaviridae_, is a single-stranded RNA virus and is zoonotic, or animal-borne. Lassa fever is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. While Lassa fever is mild or has no observable symptoms in about 80 percent of people infected with the virus, the remaining 20 percent have a severe multisystem disease. Lassa fever is an endemic disease in portions of West Africa. It is recognized in Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone, as well as Nigeria. However, because the rodent species which carry the virus are found throughout West Africa, the actual geographic range of the disease may extend to other countries in the region. Individuals at risk are those who live or visit areas with a high population of _Mastomys_ rodents infected with Lassa virus or are exposed to infected humans.\n\nPrimary transmission of the Lassa virus to humans can be prevented by avoiding contact with _Mastomys_ rodents, especially in the geographic regions where outbreaks occur. Storing food away in rodent-proof containers and keeping living areas clean help to discourage rodents from entering homes. When caring for patients with Lassa fever, further transmission of the disease through person-to-person contact or nosocomial routes can be avoided by taking preventive precautions against contact with patient secretions (together called VHF [Viral Haemorrhagic Fever] isolation precautions or barrier nursing methods) [http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvrd/spb/mnpages/vhfmanual.htm]. Such precautions include wearing protective clothing, such as masks, gloves, gowns, and goggles; using infection control measures, such as complete equipment sterilization; and isolating infected patients from contact with unprotected persons until the disease has run its course. The disease can be treated.\n\nSigns and symptoms of Lassa fever typically occur 1-3 weeks after the patient comes into contact with the virus. These include fever, retrosternal pain (pain behind the chest wall), sore throat, back pain, cough, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, conjunctivitis, facial swelling, proteinuria (protein in the urine), and mucosal bleeding. Neurological problems have also been described, including hearing loss, tremors, and encephalitis. Because the symptoms of Lassa fever are so varied and nonspecific, clinical diagnosis is often difficult. The anti-viral drug ribavirin can be used in treatment of severe cases. Currently, there is no protective vaccine.\n\nA map of Liberia, showing the location of Bong county in the centre of the country, can be accessed at: http://www.mapsofworld.com/liberia/liberia-political-map.html. - Mod.CP\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/r/1KlR.]", "summary": "Communicated by:\nDr. Richard A.

The most recent report described extensive outbreaks in central and northern Nigeria (see: Lassa fever - Nigeria (08) 20130314.1585). The current report describes a fatal case in Rivers state, which is located in the extreme south of Nigeria.\n\nThe reservoir host of Lassa virus is the rodent known as the 'multimammate rat' belonging to the genus _ Mastomys_. These rodents produce large numbers of offspring and are numerous in the savannas and forests of west, central, and east Africa. Most relevant is their habit to readily colonize human homes. The _Mastomys_ spp. rodents shed the virus in their urine and faeces. Therefore, the virus can be transmitted through direct contact with these materials, through touching or eating food contaminated with these materials, or through cuts or sores. Because _Mastomys_ rodents often live in and around homes and scavenge human food remains or poorly stored food, transmission by this means is common. Contact with the virus also may occur when a person inhales tiny particles in the air contaminated with rodent excrement. Therefore, control of human infection will require general improvement of living conditions and rodent control rather than reliance on deployment of medical care and a vaccine which does not yet exist.\n\nA map of the states of Nigeria showing Rivers state in the far south can be accessed at: http://quacked.com/image-110-nigeria.htm. - Mod.CP\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/r/1qGF.]", "summary": "A ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n \n\nThe commissioner said the state government has risen to the challenges of the Lassa fever outbreak by intensifying surveillance and consolidating the established control structures.

The cause of the illness was found to be Lassa virus, named after the town in Nigeria where the 1st cases were found. The virus, a member of the virus family _Arenaviridae_, is a single-stranded RNA virus and is zoonotic, or animalborne. In areas of Africa where the disease is endemic, Lassa fever is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. While Lassa fever is mild or has no observable symptoms in about 80 per cent of people infected with the virus, the remaining 20 per cent have a severe multisystem disease. Lassa fever is also associated with occasional epidemics, during which the case fatality rate may reach 50 per cent.\n\nAccording to the CDC Special Pathogens website (http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvrd/spb/mnpages/dispages/lassaf.htm): The number of Lassa virus infections per year in West Africa is estimated at 100 000 to 300 000, with about 5000 deaths. The reservoir of Lassa virus is a rodent known as the 'multimammate rat', belonging to the genus _Mastomys_. _Mastomys_ spp. rodents breed very frequently, produce large numbers of offspring, and are numerous in the savannas and forests of West, Central, and East Africa. _Mastomys_ rodents readily colonize human homes.\n\nAbout 15-20 per cent of patients hospitalized for Lassa fever die from the illness. However, overall, only about one per cent of infections with Lassa virus result in death. The death rates are particularly high for women in the 3rd trimester of pregnancy and for fetuses, about 95 per cent of which die in the uterus of infected pregnant mothers. Ribavirin, an antiviral drug, has been used with success in treatment of Lassa fever patients. It has been shown to be most effective when given early in the course of the illness. Otherwise, patients should receive supportive care consisting of maintenance of appropriate fluid and electrolyte balance, oxygenation, and blood pressure, as well as treatment of any other complicating infections.\n\nPreviously, ProMED-mail reported that 22 local government areas in 9 states of Nigeria had reported outbreaks of Lassa fever.

The illness was discovered in 1969 when 2 missionary nurses died in Nigeria, West Africa. The cause of the illness was found to be Lassa virus, named after the town in Nigeria where the 1st cases originated. The virus, a member of the virus family _Arenaviridae_, is a single-stranded RNA virus and is zoonotic, or animalborne. In areas of Africa where the disease is endemic, Lassa fever is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. While Lassa fever is mild or has no observable symptoms in about 80 per cent of people infected with the virus, the remaining 20 per cent have a severe multi-system disease. Lassa fever is also associated with occasional epidemics, during which the case fatality rate may reach 50 per cent.\n\nAccording to the CDC Special Pathogens website (http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvrd/spb/mnpages/dispages/lassaf.htm): 'The number of Lassa virus infections per year in West Africa is estimated at 100 000 to 300 000, with approximately 5000 deaths. Unfortunately, such estimates are crude, because surveillance for cases of the disease is not uniformly performed. In some areas of Sierra Leone and Liberia, it is known that 10-16 per cent of people admitted to hospitals have Lassa fever, which indicates the serious impact of the disease on the population of this region.'\n\nWhile the figures for case numbers and fatalities in Plateau state of Nigeria seem very large, they are not unexpected, since Plateau state is one of the mid-belt states of Nigeria reporting high incidence of Lassa fever.

The permanent secretary in the state ministry of health, Hyacinth Oteh, announced the development while receiving the health emergency response team from the Federal Ministry of Health. Oteh said the outbreak of the disease was reported on 1 Feb 2013 and confirmed that 2 of the 6 patients infected with the disease had died while the other 4 were critical.\n\nHe regretted the absence of a virology laboratory in the state to aid early diagnosis and treatment of the disease, adding that some deaths had been recorded earlier when the disease was first reported in the state in 2005. The permanent secretary advocated for the establishment of a virology laboratory in each of the geo-political zones to help contain the spread of the disease through early diagnosis and treatment. He said medical doctors and other health workers involved in the fight against the disease should emphasize contact tracing in order to isolate people identified with the disease. According to him, the state government had commenced an enlightenment campaign on the resurgence of the disease and the need for members of the public to protect themselves.\n\nJerry Kehinde, the leader of the team, said 9 states, including Ebonyi, had been identified as Lassa fever prone and maintained that the Federal Ministry of Health was doing everything to contain the spread. He said the virus was being spread by a specie of rats known as [_Mastomys natalensis_]. He said the states affected were those ravaged by the 2012 flood disaster and warned the people to avoid contacts with rats.

The illness was discovered in 1969 when 2 missionary nurses died in Nigeria, West Africa. The cause of the illness was found to be Lassa virus, named after the town in Nigeria where the 1st cases originated. The virus, a member of the virus family _Arenaviridae_, is a single-stranded RNA virus and is zoonotic, or animal-borne. Lassa fever is mild or has no observable symptoms in about 80 percent of people infected with the virus, the remaining 20 percent have a severe multisystem disease. Lassa fever is also associated with occasional epidemics, during which the case-fatality rate can reach 50 percent.\n\nThe reservoir, or host, of Lassa virus is a rodent known as the 'multimammate rat' of the genus _Mastomys_. It is not certain which species of _Mastomys_ are associated with Lassa; however, at least 2 species carry the virus in Sierra Leone. _Mastomys_ rodents breed very frequently, produce large numbers of offspring, and are numerous in the savannas and forests of West, Central, and East Africa. In addition, _Mastomys_ generally readily colonize human homes.\n\nThere are a number of ways in which the virus may be transmitted, or spread, to humans. The _Mastomys_ rodents shed the virus in urine and droppings. Therefore, the virus can be transmitted through direct contact with these materials, through touching objects or eating food contaminated with these materials, or through cuts or sores. Because _Mastomys_ rodents often live in and around homes and scavenge on human food remains or poorly stored food, transmission of this sort is common. Contact with the virus also may occur when a person inhales tiny particles in the air contaminated with rodent excretions. This is called aerosol or airborne transmission. Finally, because _Mastomys_ rodents are sometimes consumed as a food source, infection may occur via direct contact when they are caught and prepared for food.\n\nLassa fever may also spread through person-to-person contact. This type of transmission occurs when a person comes into contact with virus in the blood, tissue, secretions, or excretions of an individual infected with the Lassa virus. The virus cannot be spread through casual contact (including skin-to-skin contact without exchange of body fluids). Person-to-person transmission is common in both village and health care settings [as in the report above], where, along with the modes of transmission mentioned above, the virus also may be spread in contaminated medical equipment, such as reused needles (nosocomial transmission).\n\nApproximately 15-20 percent of patients hospitalized for Lassa fever die from the illness. However, overall only about 1 percent of infections with Lassa virus result in death. The death rates are particularly high for women in the 3rd trimester of pregnancy, and for fetuses, about 95 percent of which die in the uterus of infected pregnant mothers.

'With the number of patients currently on admission and those who have so far died from the illness, Nigeria may record the worst Lassa fever epidemic this year,' head of nurses, Lassa Fever Ward, Irrua Specialist hospital, Mrs Rebecca Atafo told Weekly Trust. Mrs Atafo said the pathetic death of a family of 3, which was wiped out by the dreaded illness in January 2013, shows the gravity of the problem at hand.\n\nThe hospital record obtained by the Weekly Trust shows that 100 patients were brought to the institution in January 2013 alone, out of whom 40 died. According to the breakdown of the cases by the scientist at the research and documentation centre of the hospital, Ikponwonsa Ordia, Edo State has the highest figure of 38 reported cases out of whom 15 died. Ondo State has the 2nd highest with 19 patients, out of whom 8 died; this was followed by Taraba State with 8 cases brought to the hospital, out of whom 3 died. Other states include Benue with 6 patients, Plateau (2 patients), Rivers, Nasarawa and Ebonyi (one each), as well as Abuja (5) among others.\n\nOrdia said that by the end of February 2013, the number of patients brought to the hospital had risen to 190, out of whom 100 died, while 30 are still in critical condition. He said these figures only represented cases brought to the hospital in Irruah, when the situation has gotten too bad to handle, explaining that many more must have died from the illness across the country. He said the victims from Taraba and Ebonyi States are health workers, wondering what could have happened to the patients they got infected from and their families.\n\nChief medical director of the hospital, Professor George Akpede said although the outbreak has been reported in more than 13 states, the epidemic may be countrywide. Confirmed cases from affected states show that the death rate is higher than the official statistics had revealed. Reports from Plateau State showed that the virus has claimed 3 lives from the village of Tuwan in Kanke local government area of the state alone. Health workers were unanimous that the illness is not limited to Tuwan alone.\n\nIn Nasarawa State, 5 cases were confirmed within Tudun Gwandara, in Karu Local Government Area after diagnoses at the Dalhatu Araf Specialists' Hospital (DASH) in Lafia. There was also an official confirmation of one death from the illness in the state. Weekly Trust [newspaper] also learned that the virus claimed 2 lives in Ebonyi State out of the 6 confirmed cases, apart from the one listed by doctors at Irrua.\n\nProf Akpede said there had been a 60 per cent increase in suspected cases and an 80 per cent increase in confirmed cases across the country. He said more than 51 million Nigerians are at risk, with the annual number of illnesses estimated at 3 million and the annual number of deaths estimated at about 58 330. He said 15-20 per cent of patients hospitalized for Lassa fever die from the illness. 'The death rate during epidemic is, however, far higher, ranging between 30 and 60 per cent. The death rate is particularly high for women in the 3rd trimester of pregnancy and for the fetus, about 95 per cent of which die in the uterus of infected pregnant mothers,' he revealed.\n\nFormer commissioner for health in Edo State Moses Momoh agreed that there is really a Lassa fever epidemic across the country. He said the disease, which is seasonal and restricted to Edo central, has now spread to all parts of the state and now occurs all year round. 'It is no longer a seasonal disease,' he noted, while calling for joint action by stakeholders to tackle the menace.\n\nWorried by the upsurge of the disease, the federal government has sent an intervention team to some of the affected states to 'investigate and put in place preventive measures to avoid the spread of the disease.' Minister of health Onyebuchi Chukwu said the team went with drugs from the ministry and with personal protection equipment; they will investigate the cases. They will do contact tracing and mount environmental control. 'Then, they will meet with the state officials to come up with information and education materials that can be distributed to people in their own languages,' he said. The minister said the aim of distributing the information materials in the vernacular was to facilitate awareness on prevention.\n\nHowever, experts, advice the federal government to find a lasting solution to the menace instead of waiting for an outbreak before deploying its men to affected areas. 'Why would the government wait for an outbreak before it begins to think of printing information materials on prevention to residents of the affected areas? What purpose would that serve in the 1st place,' a medical doctor with a private hospital in Jalingo, Dr Joseph Banjamin, queried. He said that for a disease that is seasonal, intervention was supposed to be an all-round thing. 'Between last year [2012] and now, what has really been done in the area of prevention across the country, especially since the areas prone to attacks are known? Are health centres more empowered to deal with the situation now than they were last year? How equipped is the specialist hospital in Irrua to deal with the spread?' he asked.\n\nDirector of administration of Irrua Specialist Hospital Mr Tony Edeko said the manpower and equipment available at the hospital are grossly inadequate to deal with the rising cases of Lassa fever. He said the hospital requires more isolation facilities and dialysis machines in addition to manpower to enable it to deal with the new reality. A former vice chancellor of the Ambrose Alli University, Ekpoma, Professor Dennis Agbonlahor, has said poor funding and lack of political will are responsible for the prevalence of Lassa fever endemics in Nigeria. Prof Agbonlahor said the Nigerian government had yet to show enough commitment towards Lassa fever eradication over the years.\n\nThe former AAU VC said funds donated by foreign donors for establishment of Lassa fever laboratories in each of the zones of the federation were collected by some officials of the Federal Ministry of Health but never accounted for.\n\nProf Agbonlahor said Lassa fever has claimed more lives than more publicized infectious diseases such as meningitis, HIV/AIDs, acute diarrhea, among others. He said over 100 000 lives had been lost to Lassa fever between 1969 and 2013, adding that many unrecorded deaths occurred in rural areas.\n\nProf Agbonlahor said 23 states in Nigeria were affected by Lassa fever in 2012 out of which 87 deaths were recorded. He said Lassa fever cases were confirmed in Nigeria only 39 years after its 1st outbreak in 1969 because there were inadequate laboratory diagnostic facilities for confirming suspected cases of Lassa fever. Prof Agbonlahor said vaccination against Lassa fever in the country has not been possible due to lack of funding and political will. He urged the federal government to establish zonal diagnostic offices for Lassa fever across the country and to also show more interest and concern on the control and eradication of the disease.\n\nMeanwhile, Dr Nasidi Abdulsalami, director, Nigeria Centre for Disease Control, said there has been no new case of Lassa fever since drugs were sent to Ondo and Benue. He said the cases in Ondo are still confined to Ose Local Government Area. 'But we are expanding our reach on prevention, not just with Lassa fever but other similar diseases as well. As you know, this is the season. We are in a meeting to increase the reach of prevention. We are also implementing and strengthening the early warning and reporting system to catch any suspected new case,' he said.\n\n[byline: Vincent Egunganga, Lami Sadiq, Hir Joseph]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail rapporteur Kunihiko Iizuka\n\n[This review describes vividly the extent of the current epidemic of Lassa fever affecting central and northern Nigeria but neglects consideration of the fact that the reservoir host of Lassa virus is the rodent known as the 'multimammate rat' belonging to the genus _ Mastomys_. These rodents produce large numbers of offspring and are numerous in the savannas and forests of west, central, and east Africa. Most relevant is their habit to readily colonize human homes. The _Mastomys_ spp. rodents shed the virus in their urine and faeces. Therefore, the virus can be transmitted through direct contact with these materials, through touching or eating food contaminated with these materials, or through cuts or sores. Because _Mastomys_ rodents often live in and around homes and scavenge human food remains or poorly stored food, transmission by this means is common. Contact with the virus also may occur when a person inhales tiny particles in the air contaminated with rodent excretions. Therefore, control of human infection will require general improvement of living conditions and rodent control rather than reliance on deployment of medical care and a vaccine which does not yet exist.\n\nA map of the states of Nigeria can be accessed at: http://quacked.com/image-110-nigeria.htm. - Mod.CP\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/r/1qGF.]", "summary": "\n\nDirector of administration of Irrua Specialist Hospital Mr Tony Edeko said the manpower and equipment available at the hospital are grossly inadequate to deal with the rising cases of Lassa fever.

Furthermore it states that supplies of ribavirin, the only drug known to be effective in treatment of Lassa fever virus infection, are adequate and generally available.\n\nRibavirin (brand names: Copegus, Rebetol, Ribasphere, Vilona and Virazole) is an anti-viral drug indicated for severe respiratory syncytial virus infection (individually), hepatitis C infection (used in conjunction with peginterferon alfa-2b or peginterferon alfa-2a) and other viral infections. Ribavirin is a prodrug, which when metabolised resembles purine RNA nucleotides. In this form it interferes with RNA metabolism required for viral replication. How it exactly affects viral replication is unknown; many mechanisms have been proposed for this but none of these has been proven to date. Multiple mechanisms may be responsible for its actions. The primary observed serious adverse side-effect of ribavirin is hemolytic anemia, which may worsen preexisting cardiac disease. The mechanism for this effect is unknown. It is dose-dependent and may sometimes be compensated by decreasing dose.\n\nRibavirin is active against a number of DNA and RNA viruses.

The animal reservoir of Lassa virus is a rodent of the genus _Mastomys_, commonly known as the 'multimammate rat.' _Mastomys_ infected with Lassa virus do not become ill, but they can shed the virus in their excreta. A photograph of a multimammate rat can be viewed at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Mastomys.jpg.\n\nLassa fever is known to be endemic in Guinea (Conakry), Liberia, Sierra Leone, and parts of Nigeria, but probably exists in other West African countries as well. About 80 percent of human infections are asymptomatic; the remaining cases have severe multi-system disease, where the virus affects several organs in the body, such as the liver, spleen, and kidneys. The incubation period of Lassa fever ranges from 6-21 days. Lassa fever occurs in all age groups and in both men and women. Persons at greatest risk are those living in rural areas where _Mastomys_ rats are usually found, especially in areas of poor sanitation or crowded living conditions. Health care workers are at risk if proper barrier nursing and infection control practices are not maintained.\n\nHumans usually become infected with Lassa virus from direct contact with rat droppings or urine and through touching objects or eating food contaminated with rat droppings or urine of infected _Mastomys_. Lassa virus may also be spread between humans through direct contact with the blood, urine, faeces, or other bodily secretions of a person with Lassa fever. There is no epidemiological evidence supporting airborne spread between humans. Person-to-person transmission occurs in both community and health care settings, where the virus may be spread by contaminated medical equipment, such as re-used needles.\n\nPrevention of Lassa fever in the community centers on promoting good 'community hygiene' to discourage rodents from entering homes. Effective measures include storing grain and other foodstuffs in rodent-proof containers, disposing of garbage far from the home, maintaining clean households and keeping cats. Because _Mastomys_ are so abundant in endemic areas, it is not possible to completely eliminate them from the environment.

People get the disease through direct contact with rat droppings or urine and through touching objects or eating food contaminated with rat droppings or urine. Lassa fever may also spread though person-to-person contact. The symptoms include fever, pain behind the chest, sore throat, back pain, cough, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, and bleeding from the mouth or nose. People with Lassa fever may also experience hearing loss, tremors, swelling of the face and eyelids, and swelling of the brain. Pregnant women with Lassa fever often have bleeding from the genitals and miscarriage and may die from the illness.\n\nLassa fever is seen in West Africa. Cases have been documented in Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Nigeria. However, the rats that spread Lassa fever also live in other countries in Africa, and there is the potential for further spread of the disease. The number of Lassa virus infections per year in West Africa is estimated at 100 000 to 300 000, with about 5000 deaths. These numbers are estimates because cases are not investigated everywhere. In some areas of Sierra Leone and Liberia, 10 per cent to 16 per cent of people admitted to hospitals have Lassa fever, which indicates the serious impact of the disease on the population of this region. Lassa fever can occur all year long, but most cases occur from January to May.\n\nBecause airborne transmission is possible and mortality can be high under certain conditions, Lassa virus has been classified as a category A bioterrorism agent. Early diagnosis is difficult due to insidious non-specific onset and to the great genetic divergence of the virus that makes RT-PCR assays unreliable.

This information is provisional and subject to change when laboratory results for Lassa fever in suspected cases become available.\n\nThe Federal and State governments are responding to the outbreak by enhancing the disease surveillance for early detection, reinforcing treatment of patients, and conducting awareness campaigns among the affected population. Major challenges are the ongoing security risks in the country limiting access to some areas as well as the limited availability of resources to respond to the escalating outbreak.\n\nWHO does not advise or recommend any restrictions on travel or trade with Nigeria.

The law maker urged the house to impress on the state government to direct the Ministry of Health to provide the necessary drugs to the victims of the disease. He also advised the house to embark on an enlightenment campaign to educate the people of the danger of the diseases and ways of preventing same. Other members who commented on the issue, seconded the motion describing the disease as a dangerious thing to mankind that needed urgent attention.\n\nMembers, Mark Useni, Josiah Sabo Kente and Abubakar Lawal regretted the alarming rate the disease was claiming lives within and outside the state and urged the state government to take proactive step to address the issue.\n\n[Byline: Celestine Ihejirika]\n\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Lassa virus is a single-stranded RNA virus belonging to the virus family _Arenaviridae_.

Nineteen of the country's 36 states have reported cases since the beginning of 2012. As of April 13, 2012, there were reports of 818 suspected cases, including 84 deaths. At this time, 131 cases have been confirmed by laboratory testing. Seven deaths have also been reported among health care workers. Cases have occurred in the states of Edo, Bauchi, Plateau, and Taraba. The number of reported cases of Lassa fever in Nigeria is greater this year than in previous years. However, cases in previous years could have been underestimated due to the lack of laboratory and disease investigation systems. The Nigerian government is responding to the outbreak by improving the disease investigation, treatment of patients, and conducting awareness campaigns among affected populations. Security and availability of resources are proving to be a major challenge. WHO does not advise or recommend any restrictions on travel or trade with Nigeria.\n\nLassa fever is a viral illness that is spread by rats [classically the 'multimammate mouse' _Mastomys natalensis_, also dubbed 'rat']. People get the disease through direct contact with rat droppings or urine and through touching objects or eating food contaminated with rat droppings or urine. Lassa fever may also spread though person-to-person contact. This happens when a person comes into contact with an infected person\u2019s blood, tissue, or body fluids. The symptoms include fever, pain behind the chest, sore throat, back pain, cough, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, and bleeding from the mouth or nose. People with Lassa fever may also experience hearing loss, tremors, swelling of the face and eyelids, and swelling of the brain. Pregnant women with Lassa fever often have bleeding from the genitals and miscarriage and may die from the illness.\n\nLassa fever is seen in West Africa. Cases have been documented in Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Nigeria. However, the rats that spread Lassa fever also live in other countries in Africa. The number of Lassa virus infections per year in West Africa is estimated at 100 000 to 300 000, with about 5000 deaths. These numbers are estimates because cases are not investigated everywhere. In some areas of Sierra Leone and Liberia, 10 per cent to 16 per cent of people admitted to hospitals have Lassa fever, which indicates the serious impact of the disease on the population of this region. Lassa fever can occur all year long, but most cases occur from January to May.\n\nHow can travelers protect themselves? Avoid contact with rats, especially rat urine and feces. Put food away in rodent-proof containers. Keep the home clean and rodent proof. Trap rats in and around homes. Do not eat rats. Wash hands well and often with soap, and teach children to wash their hands, too. Do not share eating or drinking utensils. Clean surfaces that are frequently touched (such as toys, doorknobs, tables, and counters) regularly with soap and water or with cleaning wipes. Avoid close contact with sick people.\n\nIf you have traveled to the area and develop symptoms of fever, headache, sore throat, muscle pain, chest pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain, see a doctor or health care provider right away. Be sure to tell your doctor or health care provider that you have recently traveled to Nigeria.\n\nFor additional information, see:\n\nLassa fever (CDC, Special Pathogens Branch) http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvrd/spb/mnpages/dispages/lassaf.htm.\n\nViral hemorrhagic fevers (CDC Yellow Book, Health Information for International Travel) http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2012/chapter-3-infectious-diseases-related-to-travel/viral-hemorrhagic-fevers.htm.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Curiously this travel alert identifies only 4 of the 19 states affected by the outbreak of Lassa fever -- Edo, Bauchi, Plateau, and Taraba, whereas the Nigerian Ministry of Health had reported previously that Lassa fever was affecting 12 states -- Edo, Nasarawa, Plu, Ebonyi, Taraba, Yobe, Ondo, Rivers, Gombe, Anambra, Delta, and Lagos [see ProMED-mail report 'Lassa fever - Nigeria (04) 20120223.1050129'].\n\nAbout 80 per cent of human infections are asymptomatic with the remainder experiencing severe multi-system disease with the virus affecting several organs in the body, such as the liver, spleen, and kidneys.

He said in Port Harcourt that two persons, including a female youth corps member, had been reported dead from the disease. Parker explained that the victims were serving in the state, but travelled to their homes in Edo and Ebonyi during the Christmas celebration, where they developed symptoms of the fever and eventually died. He said the state government had launched an enlightenment campaign to sensitise the people to the need to take necessary precautions against the disease.\n\nParker said the government had received reports of 'pockets of occurrences' of lassa fever in seven states, including Edo and Ebonyi. 'What we are doing now is to alert the people to the outbreak of the disease. 'The fever is caused by the urine of a species of rat and mistakenly, when such enters the food we eat, it can be contracted.\n\n'We want the people to be environmentally conscious and report to the nearest health centre, any symptoms of the disease, while they should avoid self medication.' 'Being a cosmopolitan area, it is possible that rats are found in trucks that bring food to the state. People should wash their fruits and vegetables with water before consumption.'\n\nThe commissioner said officers from the Ministry of Health had been sent to various communities to inform the people about the disease and educate them on what to do once the symptoms are detected in their areas. 'We are not taking chances, and we want to be pro-active in our approach to this development.'\n\nHe said the government had in stock available drugs to treat the fever.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n[Lassa fever is a zoonotic disease and humans become infected as a result of contact with infected animals.

He said that there are 9 specialist centres across Nigeria where tests on Lassa fever can be done. Pate advised Nigerians not to panic as the government is responding promptly and effectively to the outbreak.\n\nLassa fever is a viral disease that attacks the liver, nervous system, spleen, and kidney, causing them to bleed, hence the haemorrhagic fever designation. According to the online encyclopaedia Wikipedia, Lassa fever was first described in 1969 in the town of Lassa, in Borno State, Nigeria, in the Yedseram river valley at the south end of Lake Chad. It is an infection that is endemic in the West African countries of Liberia, Sierra Leone, Guinea, and even Central African Republic and Congo DR. About 300 000 to 500 000 cases occur annually, with approximately 5000 deaths. Symptoms of Lassa fever include fever, retrosternal pain (pain behind the chest wall), sore throat, back pain, cough, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhoea, conjunctivitis, facial swelling, proteinuria (protein in the urine), and mucosal bleeding, bleeding from the mouth, nose, vagina, or gastrointestinal tract and low blood pressure.\n\nThe virus lives in rats and infects humans when they come in contact with these rats' urine and faeces. Pate explained that increasing awareness is being created for Nigerians to avoid rats and keep them away from stored food and drinking water. People living in rural areas or in crowded and unsanitary environments, where rats breed, are at the greatest risk. However, health experts warn that Lassa fever can be contracted through body fluids like blood and excrements of infected persons.\n\n[Byline: Ezra Ijioma]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nRichard A 'Ran' Nisbett, PhD, MSPH\nAssistant Professor\nGlobal Health Practices Track\nDepartment of Global Health\nCollege of Public Health\nUniversity of South Florida\n13201 Bruce B Downs Blvd, MDC56\nTampa, FL 33612-3805\nUSA\nResearch Associate\nPIRE-University of Liberia\n<rnisbett@health.usf.edu>\n\n[About 80 percent of human infections are asymptomatic; the remaining cases have severe multi-system disease, where the virus affects several organs in the body, such as the liver, spleen, and kidneys.

The virus is a single-stranded RNA virus belonging to the virus family Arenaviridae. Lassa fever is known to be endemic in Guinea (Conakry), Liberia, Sierra Leone, and parts of Nigeria, but probably exists in other West African countries as well.\n\nAbout 80 per cent of human infections are asymptomatic; the remaining cases have severe multi-system disease, where the virus affects several organs in the body, such as the liver, spleen, and kidneys. The incubation period of Lassa fever ranges from 6-21 days. The onset of the disease is usually gradual, starting with fever, general weakness, and malaise. After a few days, headache, sore throat, muscle pain, chest pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, cough, and abdominal may follow. Severe cases may progress to show facial swelling, fluid in the lung cavity, bleeding from mouth, nose, vagina, or gastrointestinal tract, and low blood pressure. Protein may be noted in the urine. Shock, seizures, tremor, disorientation, and coma may be seen in the late stages. Deafness occurs in 25 per cent of patients of whom half recover some function after 1-3 months.\n\nLassa fever is a zoonotic disease, humans becoming infected from contact with infected animals. The animal reservoir of Lassa virus is a rodent of the genus _Mastomys_, commonly known as the 'multimammate rat'. Mastomys infected with Lassa virus do not become ill, but they can shed the virus in their excreta (urine and faeces).\n\nHumans usually become infected with Lassa virus from exposure to excreta of infected _Mastomys_ rats. Lassa virus may also be spread between humans through direct contact with the blood, urine, faeces, or other bodily secretions of a person with Lassa fever. There is no epidemiological evidence supporting airborne spread between humans. Person-to-person transmission occurs in both community and health care settings, where the virus may be spread by contaminated medical equipment.\n\nFurther information can be obtained from the WHO website at http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs179/en/index.html.\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map of Nigeria can be seen at http://healthmap.org/r/1F4_.

The index case was a 17 year old pregnant woman who delivered at 28\nweeks gestational age. Both she and the baby (not a 6 year old) died.\nAlthough she and her family occasionally caught and consumed rodents, there\nis no history of her running a 'rat meat restaurant'.\n\n2. In all, there were 35 identified contacts of this woman and child, but\nonly 4 developed Lassa fever. All had direct contact with the index case or\nsecondary cases, and all 4 survived. We have not identified any more cases,\nand, since the time from the last known contact of any of the confirmed\ncases has now exceeded the 3-week maximum incubation period for Lassa\nfever, we do not anticipate more cases related to this particular chain of\ntransmission.\n\n3. Whether 'the disease has migrated from the forest region of the east to\nthe savannah grasslands of the north' is a very open question. The index\ncase denied travel to the known endemic area in the east, but it is always\npossible that the infection resulted from unrecognized contact from an\ninfected person coming from the east to her village in Bombali District.\nOur zoology team is presently trapping rodents in the home and village of\nthe index case. Identification of Lassa virus-positive _Mastomys\nnatalensis_ would confirm the notion that the endemic area has expanded.\nHowever, it should be noted that suspected cases of Lassa fever have been\nreported from this area before, but laboratory facilities were not\navailable at the time to confirm them.\n\n4. There has indeed been a significant increase in reported cases of Lassa\nfever in Sierra Leone over the last 9 months or so. However, this\nobservation largely coincides with the implementation of Sierra Leone's new\npolicy of providing free care to children under 5 and pregnant and\nlactating mothers (<http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8645968.stm>). The numbers\nof patients seen in hospitals and health clinics sky-rocketed, driving\nupward the perceived incidence of virtually every disease that affects\nthese groups, including Lassa fever. Whether the observed increase in cases\nof Lassa fever is purely reflective of the change in policy or also has\nconcomitant biological determinants is unknown.

Though 1st described in the 1950s, the\nvirus causing the disease was not identified until 1969. The virus is\na single-stranded RNA virus belonging to the virus family\n_Arenaviridae_. Lassa fever is known to be endemic in Guinea, Liberia,\nSierra Leone and parts of Nigeria but probably exists in other West\nAfrican countries as well. About 80 percent of human infections are\nasymptomatic; the remaining cases have severe multi-system disease,\nwhere the virus affects several organs in the body, such as the liver,\nspleen and kidneys. The incubation period of Lassa fever ranges from\n6-21 days.\n\nLassa fever is a zoonotic disease. The animal reservoir of Lassa\nvirus is a rodent of the genus _Mastomys_, commonly known as the\n'multimammate rat.' _Mastomys_ infected with Lassa virus do not become\nill, but they can shed the virus in their urine and faeces. (An image\nof a multimammate rat can be viewed at:\n<http://www15.bni-hamburg.de/bni/bni2/neu2/getfile.acgi?area=forschunggruppen&pid=21232>).\n\nLassa fever can affect all age groups. Persons at greatest risk are\nthose living in rural areas where _Mastomys_ are usually found,\nespecially in areas of poor sanitation or crowded living conditions\nsuch as, in the present instance, military encampments. There is no\nepidemiological evidence supporting airborne spread between humans,\nbut person-to-person transmission occurs in both community and health\ncare settings.\n\nLassa virus was named after the town of Lassa in northeastern\nNigeria, where the 1st known patient contracted this infection in\n1969. Lassa viral infection may affect between 2 to 3 million people\neach year in certain portions of the West African region, causing a\nmortality of about 10 000. Lassa fever is one of the endemic zoonoses\nin Nigeria, with a high probability for nosocomial transmission due to\nseveral health care sector challenges. Although treatment is available\nfor Lassa fever, early diagnosis is still difficult in almost all\nNigerian health care institutions.

'We have so far lost\n17 people to the Lassa fever outbreak, which started about 4 weeks\nago,' state chief epidemiologist Shehu Mohammed told AFP [Agence France-Press].\n\nLassa fever is an endemic acute viral haemorrhagic illness common in\nwest Africa, which is usually contracted through contact with\nrodents' excreta. 'Scores of people have been confirmed to have been\ninfected with the disease,' said Mohammed in a phone interview. He\nsaid the outbreak was recorded in 3 local districts, including the\nstate capital Birnin-Kebbi, the worst hit with 9 recorded deaths.\n\nMohammed said the World Health Organisation has roped in medical\nexperts from South Africa, Netherlands and Nigeria's commercial\ncentre Lagos to help tackle the outbreak. The disease, which causes\nfever, headache, difficulty in swallowing and can lead to infection\nof vital organs and death, is named after the town of Lassa in\nnorthern Nigeria's Borno State where it was 1st identified in 1969.\n\nIt occurs mainly in Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria and in Sierra Leone,\nwhere it claims roughly 200 lives each year.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Lassa viral haemorrhagic fever is an acute illness of 1-4 weeks\nduration that occurs in West Africa. Though 1st described in the\n1950s, the virus causing the disease was not identified until 1969.\nThe virus is a single-stranded RNA virus belonging to the virus\nfamily _Arenaviridae_. Lassa fever is known to be endemic in Guinea,\nLiberia, Sierra Leone and parts of Nigeria but probably exists in\nother West African countries as well.\n\nAbout 80 percent of human infections are asymptomatic; the remaining\ncases have severe multi-system disease, where the virus affects\nseveral organs in the body, such as the liver, spleen and kidneys.\nThe incubation period of Lassa fever ranges from 6-21 days. The onset\nof the disease is usually gradual, starting with fever, general\nweakness, and malaise. After a few days, headache, sore throat,\nmuscle pain, chest pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, cough, and\nabdominal may follow. Severe cases may progress to show facial\nswelling, fluid in the lung cavity, bleeding from mouth, nose, vagina\nor gastrointestinal tract, and low blood pressure. Protein may be\nnoted in the urine. Shock, seizures, tremor, disorientation, and coma\nmay be seen in the late stages. Deafness occurs in 25 percent of\npatients of whom half recover some function after 1-3 months.\nTransient hair loss and gait disturbance may occur during recovery.\n\nLassa fever is a zoonotic disease. The animal reservoir of Lassa\nvirus is a rodent of the genus _Mastomys_, commonly known as the\n'multimammate rat.' _Mastomys_ infected with Lassa virus do not\nbecome ill, but they can shed the virus in their urine and faeces.\n(An image of a multimammate rat can be viewed at:\n<http://www15.bni-hamburg.de/bni/bni2/neu2/getfile.acgi?area=forschunggruppen&pid=21232>).\n\nLassa fever occurs in all age groups. Persons at greatest risk are\nthose living in rural areas where _Mastomys_ are usually found,\nespecially in areas of poor sanitation or crowded living conditions.\nThere is no epidemiological evidence supporting airborne spread\nbetween humans. Person-to-person transmission occurs in both\ncommunity and health care settings.\n\nThe virology of Lassa fever infections has recently been reviewed by\nCharrel RN, de Lamballerie X; Vet Microbiol. 2010 Jan\n27;140(3-4):213-20. Epub 2009 Aug 28). 'To date, the International\nCommittee for Taxonomy of Viruses recognizes that the family\n_Arenaviridae_ contains a unique genus _Arenavirus_ that includes 22\nviral species.

Each arenavirus is more\nor less tightly associated with a mammal host. The distribution of\nthe host dictates the distribution of the virus. Humans may become\ninfected by arenaviruses through direct contact with infected\nrodents, including bites, or through inhalation of infectious rodent\nexcreta and secreta.

According to the department's chief of operations, Dr Abdul\nRahman, the patient was flown from Abuja in Nigeria on Monday [20 APr\n2009], for treatment of suspected malaria or septicaemia. 'Following tests\nLassa fever was diagnosed and he was immediately admitted to the isolation\nward at Unitas hospital,' said Dr Rahman.\n\nLassa fever is endemic in West African countries such as Nigeria, Guinea,\nLiberia, and Sierra Leone but is very rarely found in South Africa. It is a\nviral haemorrhagic fever with symptoms that are similar to Marburg disease\nand malaria. Its initial symptoms include fever, nausea, headaches, sore\nthroat, muscle pains, and a general feeling of weakness. 'Severe cases may\nprogress to show facial swelling, fluid in the lung cavity and bleeding\nfrom the mouth and nose,' explained Dr Rahman.\n\nHumans can contract Lassa fever from contact with infected animals. The\nbest known carrier of the Lassa virus is a rodent known as the multimammate\nrat (_Mastomys_ species) that is commonly found in West African countries.\nThe rats shed the virus in their bodily excretions. The virus can also be\nspread through direct contact with the blood, urine, faeces, or other\nbodily secretions of a person with Lassa fever.\n\nAccording to the World Health Organisation (WHO) there is no\nepidemiological evidence supporting airborne spread between humans. Their\nstatistics show that up to 500 000 cases of Lassa fever are diagnosed in\nWest Africa every year and the fatality rate among hospitalised patients\nvaries between one per cent and 15 per cent.\n\nIn addition, Dr Rahman said, the pilot, 2 co-pilots and 2 paramedics who\naccompanied the doctor on the flight from Nigeria had been placed under\nquarantine as a precautionary measure. Dr Rahman explained that special\nisolation precautions had been taken at Unitas hospital to contain the\ndisease and to protect health workers in the isolation wards who might be\nmost at risk. 'These include the wearing of special protective clothing\nsuch as masks, gloves and gowns and the sterilisation of equipment,' he said.\n\nDr Rahman said early diagnosis of the patient was proof of the quality\nlaboratory services in the country which were able to make an early and\ncorrect diagnosis of the disease. 'It is also testimony to the excellent\nrelationship between the public health and private sectors, the latter\nbeing responsible for transporting the patient,' he added.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The reports of deaths resulting from the epidemics of meningitis and Lassa\nfever in Nigeria have been alarming. The campaign against these epidemics\nmust be fought collectively to achieve the desired result of overcoming\nhealth hazards. With government bearing its own responsibilities,\ncommunities and individuals must be alive to their own roles, which include\ngood personal hygiene, proper covering of foods, preventing access of rats\nto the home, and discarding food eaten by rats. - Mod.FE\n\nOne can only speculate that the Nigerian doctor was treating one of the\nLassa fever patients referenced below as some of those outbreaks have\noccurred in the Federal Capital Territories surrounding Abuja, the origin\nof the plane flight.

Such information would\nrequire close cooperation of both public health and animal health but could\nyield valuable results.

The World Health Organization (WHO)\nsaid over 93 cases of the virus [infection] had been confirmed in the\ncapital Abuja and neighboring Nasarawa state since December [2008].\n\nAt the Irrua Specialist Teaching Hospital in Edo state, confirmed\ncases rose by 60 percent from December 2008 to January 2009. 'That is\na major increase, and, furthermore, these are just the cases we hear\nabout in hospital,' Marguerite Lamunu, WHO Lassa fever expert, told\nIRIN. 'In reality, there will probably be many more cases and deaths\nin the community, plus the disease is spreading from state to state.'\n\nLassa fever is an acute viral hemorrhagic condition transmitted\nthrough contact with the urine or feces of rodents, especially rats\nand shrews. It was 1st discovered in 1969 in the town of Lassa in\nnorthern Nigeria's Borno state. Lassa fever can also be transmitted\nthrough direct contact with the bodily fluids and feces of an\ninfected person or through airborne particles, according to Osi-Ogbu.\n\n'We have an epidemic on our hands,' Ogugua Osi-Ogbu, head of Lassa\nfever prevention and care at the National Hospital in Abuja (NHA),\ntold IRIN. The disease, which has an incubation period of one to 3\nweeks, has become endemic in parts of West Africa, where it kills at\nleast 5000 people each year among 300 000 to 500 000 cases, according\nto WHO. The illness is especially severe late in pregnancy, killing\nthe fetus and/or the mother in more than 80 percent of cases.\n\nThe Nigerian Federal Ministry of Health has alerted all 36 state\nHealth Ministries, directing them to step up public awareness\ncampaigns on preventing Lassa fever. 'We have embarked on a rigorous\ncampaign on the radio to sensitize our people on the dangers of Lassa\nfever, how it is contracted and effective measures to avoid\ninfection,' Kano State Health Commissioner Aisha Isyaku Kiru told\nIRIN. 'We are specifically calling on the people to observe and\nimprove community hygiene through proper refuse disposal to\ndiscourage rats from taking refuge, and keeping food and drinking\nwater in containers not accessible to rats,' Kiru said.\n\nAccording to residents, many ethnic groups consume rodents,\nespecially rats, hedgehogs and badgers. Undergrowth is often burned\nto smoke out rodents for ''bush meat,' as it is known locally,\ndriving the animals to take shelter in homes, thereby increasing the\nrisk of Lassa fever infection. 'Rodents are a source of meat to many\nof our people and the government needs to ban their consumption to\neffectively contain Lassa fever spread,' said Bernard Ayorchia, a\nprivate medical doctor in the central Nigerian city of Makurdi.\n\nAnother hurdle in tackling Lassa in Nigeria is the lack of\nlaboratories. Only 2 facilities, in the southern states of Lagos and\nEdo, are equipped to diagnose the illness. Initial symptoms, which\ninclude headache, sore throat, muscle pain, chest pain, nausea,\nvomiting, diarrhea and coughing, are similar to those of malaria,\nwhich can also make diagnosing Lassa fever difficult, according to\nthe WHO. Severe cases may progress to bleeding from the mouth, nose,\nvagina or gastrointestinal tract. In late stages, seizures, shock,\ntremors and coma can occur.\n\n'The government must urgently provide laboratories for diagnosing\nLassa fever in all parts of the country,' said NHA's Osi-Ogbu. 'Early\ndetection of the virus and a prompt response are key in saving the\nlife of an infected person.'\n\nWHO plans in the coming days to send an evaluation team to affected\nstates in Nigeria to assess the scale of the outbreak.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[It is clear from the reaction of the Nigerian healthcare authorities\nthat the epidemic of Lassa fever is continuing to spread, but its\ntrue extent is difficult to assess.

The Health Protection\nAgency (HPA) said the death at University College Hospital was an\nisolated case and the patient had been working in Africa. The Agency\nis trying to identify members of staff or healthcare workers who\nmight have had contact with the patient who had been to Mali.\nPatients and visitors to the hospital are not at risk, the HPA said.\n\nLast month, a 66-year-old east London man, who had been travelling in\nNigeria, died of Lassa fever at London's Royal Free Hospital.\n\nThe fever is caused by a virus and is endemic in Nigeria, Sierra\nLeone, Liberia, Guinea, and the Central African Republic. Dr Dilys\nMorgan, a Lassa fever expert at the Health Protection Agency, said:\n'These people will be provided with information about Lassa fever and\nasked to get in contact with us should they develop any symptoms.'\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur A-Lan Banks\n\n[Lassa fever is a zoonotic disease, whereby humans become infected\nfrom contact with infected animals. The animal reservoirs of Lassa\nvirus are rodents of the genus _Mastomys_, the 'multimammate rat.' (A\nphotograph of a multimammate rat can be accessed at\n<http://i127.photobucket.com/albums/p145/hawthornrats/other%20pets/multis/DSCF4892.jpg>.)\nLassa virus-infected animals do not become ill, but they can shed the\nvirus in their urine and faeces. It can be transmitted also between humans.\n\nLassa fever is endemic in many countries in West Africa, but is only\nrarely imported into Europe.

Virus Reference Dept (VRD), Centre for Infections, Colindale,\nUnited Kingdom]\n\nIn February 2009, the 12th recorded case of Lassa fever, since\nsurveillance records are available, was imported to the United\nKingdom (UK). This is the 2nd case to be imported to the UK in 2009\nand the 1st reported case to have acquired infection in Mali. Risk\nassessment of 117 UK healthcare contacts with potential direct\nexposure to the patient's body fluids was undertaken. 7 contacts are\nconsidered to be at high risk of infection and are being actively\nmonitored for 21 days.\n\nBackground\n----------\nLassa fever is caused by an arenavirus and is an acute illness of\nbetween one and 3 weeks duration. The incubation period is usually 7\nto 12 days but may range between three and 21 days. About 80 percent\nof human infections in endemic areas are asymptomatic. The overall\ncase fatality rate is 1 percent, although it is reported to be 15\npercent-20 percent in hospitalised patients (1,2).\n\nThe natural host of Lassa virus is the multimammate rat (_Mastomys_\nspecies), which sheds the virus in urine and droppings. Transmission\nof the virus to humans usually occurs via direct or indirect contact\nwith rodent excreta. Person-to-person transmission occurs through\ndirect contact with blood, saliva, urine, faeces, or semen (1).\n\nLassa fever is known to be endemic in parts of West Africa, with most\ncases reported from Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Nigeria. People\nliving in rural areas of West Africa are most at risk of Lassa fever.\nImported cases to the UK are rare and occur almost exclusively in\nindividuals who have worked in endemic areas in high risk occupations\nsuch as medical or development workers (4). Although there is some\nevidence of endemicity in neighbouring countries (1,3-5), this is the\n1st case of imported Lassa fever from Mali into the UK.\n\nClinical case description\n-------------------------\nIn February 2009, a man in his 20s was admitted to University College\nHospital in London (UCLH) having been medically evacuated from Mali\nwith a 10-day history of fever and a diagnosis of falciparum malaria\nthat did not respond to treatment. He had been in a village in\nsouthern Mali for 4 weeks, where he was working in remote rural\nconditions on the border with the Ivory Coast. He had travelled\ndirectly from the UK to Bamako, Mali and then travelled overland to\nsouthern Mali. Although precise details of possible exposure to\nrodents are not known, rodents including rats were seen regularly in\nthe village.\n\nOn arrival the patient was alert and able to give a clear report on\nhis medical history. However, he deteriorated rapidly and was\ntransferred to a negative pressure room in the intensive care unit.\nHe died of multi-organ failure later the same day. His malaria blood\nfilm and rapid antigen test were negative and a diagnosis of Lassa\nfever was confirmed the same night by PCR.\n\nThe patient was originally considered at low risk of Lassa fever\nbecause the disease has never been reported in Mali and is thus not\nconsidered endemic there. However, as he became more unwell his\nstatus was upgraded. Standard universal infection control precautions\nwere followed and visors, but not full body protection, were worn\nduring the attempted resuscitation.\n\nVirological analysis\n--------------------\nThe diagnosis was confirmed in 2 different reverse transcription PCR\n(RT-PCR) assays targeting different regions of the genome and by\nsequencing of the 291 amino acids at the N-terminus of the Lassa\nvirus glycoprotein C (6). The detection of Lassa virus in 2 different\nRT-PCRs together with the characterisation of a unique part of the\nLassa virus genomic sequence constituted a definitive diagnosis.\nFurther studies including virus culture are in progress, and\nsequencing of the entire genome of the isolate is planned.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis showed that the virus was distinct from other\nLassa virus strains but grouped most closely with a strain of Lassa\nvirus (Lassa (AV)) isolated from a case reported from Germany in 2000\n(7) . The German patient had travelled through Ivory Coast, Ghana,\nand Burkina Faso during the incubation period and the investigations\ncould not determine where he had acquired the virus. The British case\nreported here had been working close to the border with Ivory Coast.\n[The original text is accompanied by a figure showing the\nphylogenetic relationship of the Mali virus with other African arenaviruses].\n\nSurveillance and management of contacts\n---------------------------------------\nAn Incident Control Team (ICT) meeting was called by UCLH early the\nfollowing day to discuss risk assessment of contacts, safe\ndecontamination of the environment, and management of the body. The\nICT identified 123 people who could have come into direct contact\nwith the Lassa virus either through contact with the case or exposure\nto body fluids. Almost all of these contacts were UCLH emergency care\nand laboratory staff. All UK based contacts were assigned to one of 3\ncategories depending upon their level of risk (no risk, low risk, or\nhigh risk, and were managed as reported recently (8). Contacts will\nbe monitored for 21 days from exposure.\n\nNone of the category 3 contacts received ribavirin prophylaxis. The\nevidence base for the use of ribavirin prophylaxis is limited, but\ncategory 3 contacts were given information explaining its possible\nbenefits and side effects and were left to make an informed choice.\n\nThe German air ambulance crew are being followed up and managed by\nGerman authorities, and the World Health Organization (WHO) is\nsupporting health authorities in Mali in conducting field\ninvestigations and in the implementation of control measures.\n\nDiscussion\n----------\nIn the case described here, the reported diagnosis of malaria and the\nfact that Mali has not been considered endemic for Lassa fever made\nthe clinical diagnosis difficult. As a consequence, the initial risk\nof Lassa fever was considered low. Only when the patient developed\nmulti-organ failure 6 hours after admission was the risk of Lassa\nfever upgraded. Universal barrier precautions were used throughout,\nbut not the high levels of protection currently recommended for viral\nhaemorrhagic fevers (9). As a result, 76 hospital staff were put at\nrisk in the space of 8 hours, and 3 of 7 category 3 contacts were\nlaboratory staff. Although transmission to healthcare workers from\nimported Lassa fever cases is very rare, this can cause considerable\nanxiety among contacts. There is only one reported case of\ntransmission in a hospital setting in an industrialised country, and\nthis was a seroconversion without clinical illness in Germany (10).\n\nThis is the 1st Lassa virus to be characterised from Mali. The virus\nis closely related to isolates from neighbouring countries and was\namplified using a widely used diagnostic PCR test (6). There is\nserological evidence that Lassa virus is present in Mali (3,5), but\nthis is the 1st proven imported case and has implications for current\nrisk assessment in travellers returning from this area.\n\nReferences\n----------\n1.

The animal reservoirs of Lassa\nvirus are rodents of the genus _Mastomys_, the 'multimammate rat.'\nLassa virus-infected animals do not become ill, but they can shed the\nvirus in their urine and faeces. (A photograph of a multimammate rat\ncan be accessed at\n<http://i127.photobucket.com/albums/p145/hawthornrats/other%20pets/multis/DSCF4892.jpg>).\n\nIn humans Lassa viral haemorrhagic fever is an acute illness of 1-4\nweeks duration that occurs in West Africa. The virus is a\nsingle-stranded RNA virus belonging to the virus family\n_Arenaviridae_. Lassa fever is known to be endemic in Guinea\n(Conakry), Liberia, Sierra Leone, and parts of Nigeria, but probably\nexists in other West African countries as well.\n\nAbout 80 percent of human infections are asymptomatic; the remaining\ncases have severe multi-system disease, where the virus affects\nseveral organs in the body, such as the liver, spleen, and kidneys.\nThe incubation period of Lassa fever ranges from 6-21 days. It has\nbeen estimated that about 300 000 to 500 000 cases of Lassa fever and\n5000 deaths occur yearly across West Africa. The overall\ncase-fatality rate is 1 percent, and up to 15 percent among\nhospitalized patients.\n\nThe disease is especially severe late in pregnancy, with maternal\ndeath and/or fetal loss occurring in greater than 80 percent of cases\nduring the 3rd trimester.\n\nHumans usually become infected with Lassa virus from exposure to\nexcreta of infected _Mastomys_. Lassa virus may also be spread\nbetween humans through direct contact with the blood, urine, faeces,\nor other bodily secretions of a person with Lassa fever. There is no\nepidemiological evidence supporting airborne spread between humans.\nPerson-to-person transmission occurs in both community and health\ncare settings, where the virus may be spread by contaminated medical\nequipment, such as re-used needles.\n\nThe current increase in cases of Lassa fever in some parts of Nigeria\nmay by a consequence of increased abundance of the vector or some\nother factor resulting in increased contact between humans and\nrodents promoting the spread of the disease in the human population. - Mod.CP\n\nThe HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map of Nigeria is available at\n<http://healthmap.org/promed/en?v=9.6,6.1,6>. - CopyEd.MJ]", "summary": "A ProMED-mail post\n<http://www.promedmail.org>\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\n<http://www.isid.org>\n\nDate: Mon 16 Feb 2009\n \n\nProf Akpede, who spoke at National Lassa Fever Stakeholders Forum at\nEkpoma [at the] weekend [14-15 Feb 2009] noted that there had been a\nmarked rise in the number of suspected and confirmed cases between\nDecember 2008 and January 2009 representing about 60 percent and 80\npercent increases respectively. \n\nIn his contribution, [the] member representing Esan Central/Esan\nWest/Igueben Federal Constituency in the House of Representatives,\nMr. Patrick Ikhariale, also expressed concern over the spread of the\nLassa fever epidemic nation-wide and called for urgent control\nmeasures at the national level.

Though 1st described in the\n1950s, the virus causing the disease was not identified until 1969.\nThe virus is a single-stranded RNA virus belonging to the virus\nfamily _Arenaviridae_. Lassa fever is known to be endemic in Guinea\n(Conakry), Liberia, Sierra Leone and parts of Nigeria, but probably\nin other West African countries as well.\n\nLassa fever is a zoonotic disease, meaning that humans become\ninfected from contact with infected animals. The animal reservoir of\nLassa virus is a rodent of the genus _Mastomys_, commonly known as\nthe 'multimammate rat.' Mastomys infected with Lassa virus do not\nbecome ill, but they can shed the virus in their excreta (urine and faeces).\n\nLassa fever occurs in all age groups and in both men and women.\nPersons at greatest risk are those living in rural areas where\nMastomys are usually found, especially in areas of poor sanitation or\ncrowded living conditions. Health care workers are at risk if proper\nbarrier nursing and infection control practices are not maintained.\n\nFamily members and health care workers should always be careful to\navoid contact with blood and body fluids while caring for sick\npersons. Routine barrier nursing precautions probably protect against\ntransmission of Lassa virus in most circumstances. However, for added\nsafety, patients suspected to have Lassa fever should be cared for\nunder specific 'isolation precautions,' which include the wearing of\nprotective clothing such as masks, gloves, gowns, and face shields,\nand the systematic sterilization of contaminated equipment.

Minister of State for Health,\nMr. Gabriel Aduku, said the spread and impact of the sickness needed\nto be checked to forestall a situation in which it would overwhelm\nthe population in the near future.\n\nAduku, who spoke at a media sensitization workshop to herald the\nRegional Conference on Lassa Fever due to be held this week, said\nalthough the Federal Ministry of Health has made some efforts and\nsigned a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Chinese\ngovernment in 2004, there was an urgent need to step up efforts in\nthe area. This, he said, would ensure a steady supply of drugs for\ntreatment of the ailment, provision of functional laboratory\nservices, as well as the development of an effective and affordable\nvaccine for Lassa fever.\n\nHe recalled that some years ago, the Federal Ministry of Health\ndesignated 3 federal tertiary health institutions as centres of\nexcellence for the control and management of the disease. According\nto Aduku, the 3 centres -- namely the Irrua Specialist Teaching\nHospital, Edo State, University of Maiduguri Teaching Hospital, Borno\nState, and the Federal Medical Centre, Owerri, Imo State -- needed to\nbe strengthened through an update of their facilities to contain the\ndisease. He, however, assured the Lassa Fever Stakeholders Forum, the\nconveners of the regional conference, of the government's continued\nsupport in the task of combating Lassa fever in the country.\n\nChief Medical Director of the Irrua Specialist Teaching Hospital,\nProfessor Godwin Akpede, disclosed that the conference is aimed at\ndeveloping capacity towards containing the challenge of the epidemic\nin the West African sub-region; delineating the constraints against\nsuccess in the efforts to reduce the prevalence, incidence and\nmortality arising from the disease; and developing strategies for the\ncontrol and eradication of the disease.\n\nLassa fever was 1st encountered in the 1950s, and the virus was\nidentified in 1969. The virus is named after Lassa, the town in Borno\nState, North Eastern Nigeria, where the 1st case of the disease\noccurred. Since then, some states in Nigeria, such as Edo, Borno,\nNasarawa, Plateau, Ebonyi and Imo, have suffered ravages of the epidemic.\n\nIt is endemic to Nigeria, Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia. The\ndisease is said to be spread by rats, which are, however, found\nthroughout West Africa. Therefore, the actual geographic range of the\ndisease may be more extensive. Evidence of the infection has also\nbeen found in the Central African Republic, Congo, Mali and Senegal.\n\n[Byline: Onwuka Nzeshi]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Lassa fever was 1st described in the 1950s, although the virus\n(_Lassa virus_, family _ Arenaviridae_, genus _Arenavirus_) was not\nisolated until 1969. The disease occurs in West Africa and is\ntransmitted to humans from wild rodents through direct or indirect\ncontact with the excreta of infected animals. Person-to-person and\nlaboratory infections occur, particularly in the hospital\nenvironment, by direct contact with blood or other body fluids of patients.\n\nThe onset of disease is gradual, with fever, vomiting and\nretrosternal pain. Signs may include conjunctival infection,\nperiorbital edema and swelling of the neck. Deafness occurs in 25\npercent of all patients. In severe cases, patients suffer shock,\nfluid in the lung cavity, haemorrhage and cerebral edema.\nApproximately 15 percent of hospitalized patients die, but the\noutcome can be improved by simple supportive care if provided early\nin the course of the disease. Specific treatment with the antiviral\ndrug ribavirin may also be effective.\n\nThe signs and symptoms of Lassa fever may be difficult to distinguish\nfrom severe malaria, typhoid fever, yellow fever and other viral\nhaemorrhagic fevers, but definitive diagnosis requires confirmation\nby laboratory testing. Health education strategies for preventing\ninfections in people living in endemic areas focus on rodent control\nand minimizing contact with rodent excreta.

The signs and symptoms of Lassa fever may be difficult to distinguish\nfrom severe malaria, typhoid fever, yellow fever and other viral\nhaemorrhagic fevers, but definitive diagnosis requires confirmation\nby laboratory testing.

Minister of State for Health,\nMr. Gabriel Aduku, said the spread and impact of the sickness needed\nto be checked to forestall a situation in which it would overwhelm\nthe population in the near future. He, however, assured the Lassa Fever Stakeholders Forum, the\nconveners of the regional conference, of the government's continued\nsupport in the task of combating Lassa fever in the country. He recalled that some years ago, the Federal Ministry of Health\ndesignated 3 federal tertiary health institutions as centres of\nexcellence for the control and management of the disease.

On 10\nFeb 2007 he was admitted to the National Hospital Abuja, where he\npresented with abdominal tenderness and fever; mildly elevated liver\nenzymes; leucopenia and thrombocytopenia were also noted. Malaria and\nviral hepatitis were ruled out. He became afebrile after 4 days of\nantibiotic treatment, but on 15 Feb [2007] presented with vomiting,\ngeneralized tonic-clonic convulsion, petechial hemorrhages on upper\ntrunk, bleeding from vena puncture sites, and confusion. Two days\nlater due to renal failure he was treated with emergency\nhemodialysis. On 19 Feb[2007] he was medically evacuated from Nigeria\nto a hospital in Pretoria, South Africa. Lassa fever was suspected,\nand blood specimens were sent to the Special Pathogens Unit of the\nNational Institute for Communicable Diseases on 20 Feb 2007, where\nLassa virus infection was confirmed by RT-PCR (reverse transcription\npolymerase chain reaction) and serology.\nTransmission of Lassa virus from its natural rodent reservoir to\nhumans can cause hemorrhagic fever syndrome, which is associated with\nhigh death rates. Lassa fever is endemic in West Africa and has been\nreported from Sierra Leone, Guinea, Liberia, and Nigeria. Only a few\ncases of importation of Lassa virus into other regions have been\ndocumented worldwide. Although importation of a Lassa fever case\nraises public concern because of the possibility of human-to-human\ntransmission and lack of an effective and safe therapy, the actual\nrisk for infection spread from an imported case appears to be low.\nThe Lassa fever patient admitted to a hospital in Pretoria is\ncurrently being treated in isolation. He is ill, but stable. South\nAfrican health authorities have taken all necessary measures to\nprevent transmission of the virus. Medical personnel in contact with\nthe patient are under observation although no specific incidents\nconstituting overt exposure to infection have been recorded.

The disease occurs in West Africa, and is transmitted\nto humans from wild rodents, through direct or indirect contact with the\nexcreta of infected animals. Person-to-person and laboratory infections\noccur, particularly in the hospital environment, by direct contact with\nblood or other body fluids of patients. The onset of disease is gradual,\nwith fever, vomiting and retrosternal pain. Signs may include conjunctival\ninjection, periorbital edema and swelling of the neck. Deafness occurs in\n25 percent of all patients. In severe cases, patients suffer shock, fluid\nin the lung cavity, haemorrhage and cerebral edema. Approximately 15\npercent of hospitalized patients die, but the outcome can be improved by\nsimple supportive care if provided early in the course of the disease.\nSpecific treatment with the antiviral drug ribavirin may also be effective.\nThe signs and symptoms of Lassa fever may be difficult to distinguish from\nsevere malaria, typhoid fever, yellow fever and other viral haemorrhagic\nfevers, but diagnosis can be assisted with simple laboratory support.\nDefinitive diagnosis requires testing that is available only in highly\nspecialized laboratories. Health education strategies for preventing\ninfections in people living in endemic areas focus on rodent control and\nminimizing contact with rodent excreta. Measures to control virus\ntransmission from cases include routine use of standard precautions,\nisolation of suspected cases and surveillance of contacts.\nLassa fever is endemic in several West African countries. The most severely\naffected countries are in the Mano River Union (Guinea, Liberia and Sierra\nLeone) and Nigeria. Cote d'Ivoire and Ghana are potentially at risk. The\nincidence of Lassa fever has been increasing in the affected areas. Civil\nunrest in the Mano River Union region created newly vulnerable populations,\nincluding refugees and humanitarian relief workers. There have been several\nrecent fatal cases of Lassa fever among United Nations peacekeeping forces.\nThe return of areas to government control and the rebuilding of civil\nsociety in Liberia and Sierra Leone puts aid workers at risk of contracting\nLassa fever.\nNosocomial outbreak \ufffd Kenema, Sierra Leone, 2004\n------------------------------------------------\nThe Kenema Government Hospital, Sierra Leone, reported an outbreak of Lassa\nfever in the winter of 2004, affecting patients from the paediatric ward,\nand claiming the lives of several health-care workers. The majority of\ncases occurred in young children, many of whom were referred directly from\nthe paediatric ward, a pattern not previously observed. WHO sent a field\ninvestigation team to Kenema to assist Ministry of Health and Sanitation\nofficials in assessing the situation and containing further spread. Between\n1 Jan and 24 Apr 2004, 95 paediatric cases were admitted, 78 percent of\nwhom were patients referred from the paediatric ward to the Lassa ward,\ncompared with only 17 percent in 2003. The mean age of cases was 18 years,\nwith half of all cases aged under 15 years; 50 percent were female. The\ncase-fatality rate was 30-50 percent in children aged under 5 years and 71\npercent in children aged under 1 year.\nThe large number of cases discharged from the paediatric ward in a\nsatisfactory condition and then readmitted for Lassa fever infection within\ndays to several weeks pointed to nosocomial transmission in the paediatric\nward. The most likely cause was parenteral drug administration from\ncontaminated multidose vials. Sharing of contaminated needles and syringes\ncould also not be ruled out. Following implementation of infection control\nmeasures, the outbreak abated.\nMano River Union Lassa fever network\n------------------------------------\nRecent peace initiatives have opened new opportunities to combat Lassa\nfever. The Office of United States Foreign Disaster Assistance, United\nNations peacekeeping forces, the European Union, national and\nnongovernmental organizations, as well as WHO have joined forces to\nestablish the Mano River Union Lassa fever network. This programme will\nassist Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone to develop national prevention\nstrategies and enhance laboratory diagnostics, clinical management and\nenvironmental control of Lassa fever. In addition, a new ward dedicated to\nthe care of patients with Lassa fever, sponsored by the European Union, is\nunder construction at Kenema Government Hospital.\nOn rare occasions, travellers arriving from areas where Lassa fever is\nendemic export the disease to other countries. Although malaria, typhoid\nfever, yellow fever and many other tropical infections are much more\ncommon, the diagnosis of Lassa fever should be considered in febrile\npatients returning from West Africa, especially if they have had exposures\nin rural areas or hospitals in countries where Lassa fever is known to be\nendemic.

It probably exists in\nother West African countries as well, according to the UN World\nHealth Organisation (WHO).\nHumans become infected with Lassa from contact with infected rodents.\nThe virus can also be transmitted from one human to another through\ndirect contact with body fluids. Rural dwellers, especially those\nliving in areas of poor sanitation or crowded living conditions, are\nat greatest risk of contracting the illness.\nSymptoms include headache, sore throat, muscle pain, chest pain,\nnausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and cough. Severe cases may progress to\nbleeding from the mouth, nose, vagina or gastrointestinal tract.\nWHO says some studies indicate that 300 000 to 500 000 cases of Lassa\nfever and 5000 deaths occur yearly across West Africa. The overall\ncase-fatality rate is 1 percent to 15 percent among hospitalised\npatients, WHO says. The illness is especially severe late in\npregnancy, with fetal loss and sometimes maternal death occurring in\nmore than 80 percent of cases.\nPewu said rural health workers in Nimba County do not have the\ncapacity to deal with the disease. 'The drugs for treatment for Lassa\nfever are in short supply,' he said.\nThe humanitarian coordination section of the UN Mission in Liberia\n(UNMIL) in its situation report early this week noted the poor state\nof health infrastructure to deal with the illness.\n'Some of the problems in tackling the disease include weak or\nnon-existent surveillance, monitoring and supervision, poor diagnosis\nof the disease at some health facilities, and lack of adequate drugs\nand treatment facilities,' the report said.\nThe report, which quoted a joint team of the Ministry of Health and\nWHO that visited villages in Nimba County, said 'there is a high\npresence of Lassa fever' in those areas.\nLiberia's recent National Human Development Report said the country's\nhealth facilities were in ruins. It said the country's 14-year civil\nwar destroyed 95 percent of health facilities, and that the number of\ntrained government doctors in the country had dropped from 400 to\nless then 20 at the war's end in 2003.\n--\nDan Silver\n<dgsilver@yahoo.com>\n[Borrowing from my colleague Mod. CP's comments in Lassa fever -\nNigeria (edo) 20050303.0654 'The disease is endemic in west Africa.\nLassa virus belongs to the old-world group of arenaviruses. Like all\narenaviruses, these viruses cause persistent infections of rodents\n(_Mastomys_ sp. in the case of Lassa virus), usually without obvious\nsigns of disease.\nHumans and other animals are infected through contact with rodent\nexcreta, particularly urine. Cases of Lassa fever are limited to West\nAfrica and have been reported most frequently from Sierra Leone, and\nto a lesser extent from Nigeria, Liberia, and Guinea. In endemic\nareas of rural West Africa, subclinical infection is common, but\noccasional outbreaks with high mortality rates have been recorded. - Mod.CP'.\nAs mentioned in the above newswire, information from the CDC fact\nsheet on Lassa fever: 'The number of Lassa virus infections per year\nin West Africa is estimated at 100 000 to 300 000, with approximately\n5000 deaths. Unfortunately, such estimates are crude, because\nsurveillance for cases of the disease is not uniformly performed. In\nsome areas of Sierra Leone and Liberia, it is known that 10 -16\npercent of people admitted to hospitals have Lassa fever, which\nindicates the serious impact of the disease on the population of this\nregion.'

Confirmatory\ntests are in progress, together with virus isolation.\nThe patient had travelled in west Africa (Ivory Coast and Chad) for a month\nbefore returning to the UK on Thu 9 Sep 2004. He became unwell the next day\nwith fever, and attended his local Accident and Emergency Department 2 days\nlater. He was admitted in the early morning of 13 Sep 2004 and when the\ndiagnosis was suspected to be Lassa fever, he was transferred to\nmedium-secure facilities. After initial tests suggested Lassa fever, he was\nstarted on ribavirin treatment and transferred to high-security infectious\ndisease facilities. He remained well with a low-grade fever and remained\nhaemodynamically stable. He was discharged from hospital after tests were\npersistently negative and he had been apyrexial for 3 days.\nContacts are being followed up for 21 days, although all are considered to\nbe low risk. Staff who cared for the patient, handled his specimens or\notherwise had contact, visitors of the patient, and other community\ncontacts are being monitored through recording daily temperatures,\nfollowing guidance in the 1996 memorandum (1). Possible non-hospital\ncontacts have been assessed as low risk, and are self-monitoring their\ntemperature.

It is endemic in west Africa. The risk\nof further transmission to humans of Lassa fever in the UK from imported\ncases is extremely low, and the natural reservoir is not found in the UK.\nRisk is confined to those who have had direct physical contact with body\nfluids from the patient during the infectious period. There have been no\nrecorded transmissions by such a route in the UK, including 74 health care\nworker contacts followed up by serology after the case in 2000 (2).

An anti-viral drug is effective in treating most\ncases of the disease, Lacy said. 'It's only the high-risk individuals,\nreally, who have the chance of getting the illness,'' said Dr. Eddy\nBresnitz, state chief epidemiologist.\nHigh risk is considered coming into contact with blood, vomit or other\nbodily secretions from an infected person. It is believed no employees at\nthe hospital had high-risk contact, but some are still being questioned,\nBresnitz said.\nThe man was admitted to the hospital after arriving at the emergency room\n24 Aug 2004. His condition deteriorated rapidly and he died of massive\nkidney and liver failure on 28 Aug 2004, said Dr. Nick Karabulut of Capital\nHealth System Mercer Medical Center, where the man was treated. 'We are\ncomfortable that this case will remain an isolated case,'' Karabulut said.\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta diagnosed the\ncause of death as Lassa fever Thursday afternoon.

Lassa fever is characterized by fever, muscle aches, sore\nthroat, nausea, vomiting, and chest and abdominal pain. Approximately 15\npercent to 20 percent of patients hospitalized for Lassa fever die from the\nillness; however, approximately 80 percent of human infections with Lassa\nvirus are mild or asymptomatic, and 1 percent of infections overall result\nin death (1). On 28 Aug 2004, a man aged 38 years residing in New Jersey\ndied from Lassa fever after returning from travel to West Africa. This\nreport summarizes the clinical and epidemiologic investigations conducted\nby federal, state, and local public health agencies. The findings\nillustrate the need for clinicians and public health officials to remain\nalert to emerging infectious diseases and to !\ninstitute appropriate measures to promptly identify and limit spread of\nunusual pathogens.\nCase Report\n-----------\nThe patient, a businessman who was born in Liberia, had resided in the\nUnited States for 5 years. During the 4-month period preceding\nhospitalization, he had been in West Africa, commuting frequently between\nLiberia and Sierra Leone, where he owned farms. One day in August 2004, the\npatient began to experience fever, chills, severe sore throat, diarrhea,\nand back pain. 2 days later, he left Freetown, Sierra Leone, and traveled\nby airplane through London, England, arriving in Newark, New Jersey. He\nthen traveled from Newark to his home by train.\nWithin hours of his arrival in the United States, the patient sought\ntreatment and was hospitalized in Trenton, New Jersey, for persistent\nfever, chills, sore throat, diarrhea, and back pain. On admission, the\npatient was alert and had a temperature of 103.6 F (39.8 C). Differential\ndiagnoses at this time included malaria and typhoid fever. On the 3rd and\n4th days of hospitalization, despite treatment with antimalarial and\nantibiotic therapy, the patient's condition deteriorated, and adult\nrespiratory distress syndrome was diagnosed. He was subsequently intubated\nand mechanically ventilated. Yellow fever and Lassa fever were considered\nas possible diagnoses. The New Jersey Department of Health and Senior\nServices (NJDHSS) was notified, CDC was consulted, and arrangements to\nadminister intravenous ribavirin under an investigational new drug protocol\nwere initiated. However, 6 hours later, the patient died before the drug\ncould be administered.\nClinical and postmortem specimens were sent to CDC for specific diagnostic\ntesting. Lassa fever was confirmed by using serum antigen detection,\nimmunohistochemical staining of postmortem liver-biopsy specimens, virus\nisolation in cell culture, and sequencing of Lassa virus by reverse\ntranscriptase-polymerase chain reaction.\nInvestigation\n-------------\nAn investigation was conducted to identify persons who might have had\ndirect contact with the patient or his body fluids while he was ill.\nContacts were categorized into low- and high-risk categories on the basis\nof multiple criteria.\nA total of 188 persons had contact with the patient during the period when\nhe was likely infectious; of these, 5 persons were classified as at high\nrisk and 183 as at low risk. The 5 at high risk were the patient's wife, 3\nof their children, and the patient's brother, who was a hospital visitor;\neach reportedly had unprotected exposure to the patient's body fluids\nduring his illness. Contacts at low risk included 9 other family members,\n139 health-care workers employed at the Trenton hospital (including 42\nlaboratory workers, 32 nurses, and 11 physicians), and 16 laboratory\nworkers employed at commercial laboratories in Virginia and California. In\naddition, 19 contacts at low risk were exposed as passengers on the flight\nfrom London to Newark.\nThe NJDHSS notified CDC's Division of Global Migration and Quarantine\n(DGMQ) of possible travel-related exposures. Because the patient reported\nillness onset 3 days before air travel, DGMQ searched for those airline\npassengers who had been seated within 6 feet of the patient. Passengers\nwere traced by using information from travel reservation records and\ncustoms declaration forms. 19 passengers seated near the patient were\nidentified. Within 5 days of notification, 13 of the 19 passengers had been\ninterviewed; within 8 days, 3 more had been contacted. The remaining 3\ncould not be contacted. 17 of 19 passengers were citizens of the United\nKingdom, and authorities in that country were notified; 2 of the passengers\nwere U.S. citizens. Interviewed passengers did not report contact with the\npatient's body fluids and were considered to have low-risk exposure. All\npassengers contacted were healthy; none reported fever as of 14 Sep 2004,\nwhich marked the end of the 21-day incubation period for Lassa fever for\nthis group.\nAll contacts at high risk (i.e., 5 family members) were monitored for\ntemperature of >101 F (>38.3 C) twice daily for 21 days after their last\npotential exposure to the patient on 28 Aug 2004. A public health nurse\nvisited the family contacts each morning and recorded their temperatures.\nIn the afternoon, the contacts recorded their own temperatures and reported\nthe results.\nThe majority of contacts at low risk (i.e., 9 other family members and 139\nhealth-care workers) were instructed to record their own temperatures at\nleast twice daily and report the results. Other contacts at low risk (i.e.,\nthe 16 laboratory workers and 19 air passengers) were asked to self-monitor\nfor temperature of >101 F (>38.3 C) and other symptoms compatible with\nLassa fever.\nNo restriction was placed on work or movement for asymptomatic adults at\neither high or low risk. However, to facilitate monitoring, the patient's\nchildren were restricted from participating in school activities. None of\nthe contacts at high risk reported any illness compatible with Lassa fever\nas of 18 Sep 2004, which ended their 21-day incubation period.\n(Reported by: P Aufiero, MD, N Karabulut, MD, D Rumowitz, S Shah, DO,\nCapital Health System, Trenton; J Nsubuga, MPH, B Piepszak, RD Salter, MA,\nCity of Trenton Div of Health; E Bresnitz, MD, CR Lacy, MD, C Robertson,\nMD, C Tan, MD, New Jersey Dept of Health and Senior Svcs.

In West Africa, Lassa fever is endemic,\ncausing 100 000 to 300 000 human infections and approximately 5000 deaths\neach year (1).\nOther than in regions where it is endemic, Lassa fever is encountered\nrarely. Cases identified in areas where Lassa fever is not endemic usually\nare imported, often by persons returning from West Africa (2). To date,\napproximately 20 cases of imported Lassa fever have been reported\nworldwide. The risk for human-to-human transmission of Lassa fever is low\n(3,4); however, healthcare-associated transmission has occurred in areas\nwhere Lassa fever is endemic, and one instance of asymptomatic\nseroconversion was reported in a European physician (4). Meticulous\nadherence to appropriate infection-control practices to prevent unprotected\nexposure to blood or other body fluids is essential to the safe management\nof patients with possible Lassa fever and to the protection of health-care\nworkers (2). Family members and others visiting a hospitalized patient must\nbe instructed to adhere to infection-control precautions and avoid exposure\nto potentially infectious blood or body fluids.\nIn the absence of proven effectiveness, oral ribavirin prophylaxis was not\nrecommended for persons who might have been exposed to the patient\ndescribed in this report. Instead, a standard treatment regimen of\nintravenous ribavirin was recommended for any contacts with clinical\nevidence of infection during the incubation period. However, none of the\ncontacts had illness compatible with Lassa fever.\nIncreasing international travel has resulted in importation of microbial\nagents not endemic to the United States, posing diagnostic challenges to\nhealth-care providers. In addition to routine evaluation, clinicians should\nconsider both uncommon and common causes of fever (e.g., malaria) in\npersons arriving from Africa. Clinical histories should include careful\nassessment of travel to regions where uncommon diseases are endemic (e.g.,\nfor Lassa fever, Liberia, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone). Every effort should\nbe made to expedite delivery of clinical specimens to appropriate\ndiagnostic laboratories.\nThe nonspecific presentation of Lassa fever and related viral infections\nthat can cause viral hemorrhagic fever syndromes underscores the need for\nconsistent application of infection-control practices. Suspected cases of\nLassa fever or related infections should be reported immediately to\nhospital infection-control professionals and to state and local health\ndepartments for treatment recommendations and to facilitate implementation\nof infection-control precautions and tracing of contacts. Clinicians also\nshould consult CDC's Special Pathogens Branch (telephone 404-639-1115),\nwhere specialized containment facilities exist to allow diagnostic\nconfirmation by serologic, virologic, molecular, and pathology techniques.\nState health departments should notify DGMQ immediately of travel-related\nimportations of suspected communicable diseases to ensure that prompt risk\nassessments, notifications, and appropriate containment measures are\nimplemented for exposed travelers.\nReferences\n----------\n1.

Lassa\nfever is endemic in both the Kenema and Kailahun districts of Sierra Leone,\nbut has previously been kept in check with medical assistance from the\nCentre for Disease Control in Atlanta in the United States.\nHowever, such aid was scaled down during the civil war that wracked the\nwest African country from 1991 to 2001.\nGborie said officials from the health ministry, the UN World Health\nOrganisation and a number of non-governmental organisations have set up a\ntask force to combat the outbreak.\n4 UN peacekeepers in a force deployed in the country have been treated for\nLassa fever and discharged from hospital, officials said.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[Lassa fever virus is a member of the family _Arenaviridae_, a group of\nnegative-sense single-stranded RNA viruses with bisegmented genomes.\nArenaviruses occur throughout the world, their distribution being\ndetermined by their natural reservoir hosts, primarily rodents.\nArenaviruses are associated with only 2 of the 30 families of rodents; the\n_Muridae_ (house mice and rats) and the _Cricetidae_ (voles, deer mice, and\ngerbils). They are maintained within their rodent hosts in a chronic\ncarrier state; in the case of Lassa fever virus, long-term viremia and\nlittle signs of disease. Most arenavirus species occur in the New World and\na few (_Guarito virus_, _Junin virus_, _Machupo virus_, and _Sabia virus_)\nare associated with severe hemorrhagic fevers in humans. 5 arenavirus\nspecies are present in the Old World, only 2 of which are associated with\nhuman disease: _Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus_ (LCMV) and _Lassa fever\nvirus_. LCMV occurs worldwide and causes mild to severe disease, whereas\nLassa fever virus occurs only in West Africa (Sierra Leone and Nigeria) and\nis associated with severe, often fatal infection of humans. The rodent\nreservoir of Lassa fever virus is _Mastomys natalensis_, an animal which\ninhabits human dwellings and surroundings. Rodent-to-human is the\npredominant route of transmission of infection in human victims and\nprobably occurs via aerosols or contact with rodent fluids and detritus.\nLess frequently human-to-human transmission can occur also in natural and\nhospital settings, probably because of the high aerosol stability of the\nvirus; hence the need for high-security containment in hospital\nenvironments. - Mod.CP\n[In the prior ProMED-mail posting on this outbreak (see Lassa fever -\nSierra Leone (south & east) 20030404.0827 ) we did not have information on\nthe numbers of cases involved. This newswire suggests that this current\noutbreak is significant with at least 80 cases and 8 deaths reported thusfar.\nAccording to the Global Infectious Diseases & Epidemiology Network (GIDEON)\n<http://www.gideononline.com> Lassa fever is most common in the eastern\nregion of Sierra Leone - where one to 4 Mastomys are found in every\nhousehold in this area, of which 1--20 percent are infected with the\nvirus. In some areas of eastern Sierra Leone, the disease accounts for 30\npercent of medical death in-hospital, 30 percent of deafness and 70 percent\nof spontaneous abortion. 8--52 of the population are seropositive. An\noutbreak was reported in Kenema District in 1995, encompassing 167 cases\n(60 fatal) - most patients were adolescent females. 799 cases (148 fatal)\nwere reported in 1996, including 99 cases (13 fatal) from Kenema District\nduring November and December. 353 (43 fatal) cases were reported during\nJanuary to April 1997.\nThere is a very informative fact sheet on Lassa fever at\n<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvrd/spb/mnpages/dispages/lassaf.htm> 'There are\na number of ways in which the virus may be transmitted, or spread, to\nhumans. The Mastomys rodents shed the virus in urine and droppings.\nTherefore, the virus can be transmitted through direct contact with these\nmaterials, through touching objects or eating food contaminated with these\nmaterials, or through cuts or sores. Because Mastomys rodents often live in\nand around homes and scavenge on human food remains or poorly stored food,\ntransmission of this sort is common. Contact with the virus also may occur\nwhen a person inhales tiny particles in the air contaminated with rodent\nexcretions. This is called aerosol or airborne transmission. Finally,\nbecause Mastomys rodents are sometimes consumed as a food source, infection\nmay occur via direct contact when they are caught and prepared for food.' -\nMod.MPP]", "summary": "A ProMED-mail post\n<http://www.promedmail.org>\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\n<http://www.isid.org>\n\nDate: 9 Apr 2003\n According to the Global Infectious Diseases & Epidemiology Network (GIDEON)\n<http://www.gideononline.com> Lassa fever is most common in the eastern\nregion of Sierra Leone - where one to 4 Mastomys are found in every\nhousehold in this area, of which 1--20 percent are infected with the\nvirus.

Pollack <pollackmp@mindspring.com>\nSource: WHO/CSR, 13 March 2000\n<http://www.who.int/emc/outbreak_news/n2000/march/13mar2000.html>\n\nA suspected, imported case of Lassa fever has been reported from the United\nKingdom. A 50-year-old British national working in Daru, Sierra Leone\nbecame ill with fever on 21 February and was airlifted to Freetown. He\nremained unwell, and on 5 March was evacuated to the UK by air ambulance.\nHe was admitted to the Hospital for Tropical Diseases, London, and then\ntransferred to Coppetts Wood Hospital, where he is being managed in high\nsecurity isolation facilities.\nLassa fever is suspected on the basis of clinical findings and preliminary\ntest results. Tests for other known viral haemorrhagic fevers have so far\nproved negative. Confirmatory tests for Lassa fever are in progress at the\nEnteric and Respiratory Virus Laboratory, Central Public Health Laboratory,\nLondon, and the results are expected within 24 hours. More than 90\npotential contacts of this patient have been identified, both in Sierra\nLeone and the UK. All have been contacted and are being monitored.\n--\nProMED-mail\ne-mail: promed@promedmail.org\n[(1) Another report, this one via George Robertson and Martha Cosgriff,\nindicated the patient had been working for the Department for International\nDevelopment in a remote rural area, helping former soldiers return to\ncivilian life after the country's civil war. Apparently, the patient is\nbeing treated with an anti-viral drug. Attending physicians said he had\nimproved at first but on Sunday his lungs began to fail and he was placed\non a ventilator.\nThe report also said, among other things: Lassa fever is a viral\nhaemorrhagic fever is spread by rats but can also be transmitted by direct\ncontact with bodily fluids. There have been 12 cases of Lassa fever\nimported to Europe and North America since 1970, with none resulting in\nfurther infection of other medical staff or patients. The disease carries a\ndeath rate of 15-20% among those taken to hospital. William Weir, a\nconsultant in infectious and tropical disease, who is treating the man,\nsaid: 'He is critically ill. I spoke to his wife yesterday and she is\nunderstandably upset. In situations like this we have to be completely\ntruthful with relatives and tell them exactly what the patient's future\ncontains.'\nThe hospital said there was no danger of the virus spreading to the public\nbut doctors, nurses, porters and ambulance staff were being interviewed\nabout their contact with the patient and some would be kept under\nsurveillance for signs of the disease so treatment could be started\nimmediately if they became ill.\nA spokeswoman for the Royal Free NHS Trust, which runs Coppetts Wood, said:\n'His status [as a carrier of an infectious tropical disease] was not clear\nwhen he came in.' Patients at the Hospital for Tropical Diseases were in\n'minimal' danger of being infected, she said, because the patient had been\nkept in an isolation room. 'This unit regularly deals with very sick\npatients, and so the hygiene and infection control regimens are very\nstrict. The likelihood of anyone at the hospital being exposed to the\ninfection is minimal.'\nLassa fever's incubation period is between three and 21 days and typical\nsymptoms are soaring temperature (up to 41C or 106F) headache, lethargy and\nmuscular pains. There is also often a rash caused by bleeding into the skin\nand mucous membranes. In the latest case, the man developed a nose bleed\nwhich, with the results of blood tests, caused doctors to suspect Lassa fever.\n(2)\nThe diagnosis of Lassa fever has now been confirmed:\n<http://www.who.int/emc/outbreak_news/n2000/march/14mar2000.html> WHO CSR\nThe patient 's condition is reported to have improved slightly, but he\nremains seriously ill. Monitoring of close contacts is continuing, and will\nbe carried out through the potential incubation period of the illness.\n(3) Dan Shapiro and I had the same thought, that a single case of Lassa\nfever, in a resident of a major industrialized country receives more media\nhype than many cases of Marburg in developing countries. - Mod.

The young woman who is\nstudying in Duesseldorf had returned to Germany at the beginning of\nthe year from a seven-week African holiday in Cote d'Ivoire (Ivory\nCoast) and Ghana.\nLassa fever is caused by a virus which is transmitted to humans from a\nsmall rat widely occurring in African dwellings -- mostly through food\ncontaminated with rodent excrement. Human-to-human transmission is\npossible under bad hygienic conditions through direct contact with\nblood, saliva, vomitus or urine from diseased individuals, particularly\nduring nursing. Most infected individuals start being infectious only\nwhen they reach the acute febrile phase. The disease, a so-called viral\nhemorrhagic fever, can lead to a severe bleeding disorder with shock\nand circulatory collapse. In hospitalised patients mortality is about 15 %.\nOften the disease may run a mild or asymptomatic course. There is\ncurrently no vaccine.\nAfter other diseases had been excluded and the suspicion of Lassa fever\ncorroborated, the necessary measures were co-ordinated in close\ncollaboration between the Medical Director of the Mission Hospital in\nWuerzburg, Professor Dr. Fleischer, the responsible outbreak\nadministrator of the Health Ministries of Bavaria and\nBaden-Wuerttemberg, the Robert Koch-Institut (http://www.rki.de)\nand the Bernhard Nocht-Institut in Hamburg\n(http://www.bni.uni-hamburg.de) where the necessary laboratory\ninvestigations are done. The Federal Health Ministry, the European\nUnion and the WHO were informed through the notification channels in\nplace for these cases.\nThe patient is being treated in an isolated part of the Hospital. She is\nin a serious state. Isolation ensures that there is no risk for other\npatients nor for the general population. Family members and friends\nwho had been in immediate contact, and the medical personnel who\nlooked after the patient in Schwaebisch Hall, are being interviewed by\nthe health authorities regarding details of their contacts and informed\nabout possible symptoms. Contact persons are being asked to take their\ntemperature twice daily, to be vigilant re possible symptoms and to\ncontact the Hospital in Schwaebisch Hall in case of symptoms. As it is a\nrare but severe infectious disease the health authorities are doing\neverything to prevent infection of others.\n--\nPress release:\nDate: Wed, 12 Jan 2000 19:19:17 +0100\nFrom: 'Muschketat, Edgar' <MuschketatE@RKI.DE>\nEdgar Muschketat\nRobert Koch-Institut\nPressesprecher\nTel: 01888.754 2286\nFax: 01888.754 2601\nE-Mail: MuschketatE@rki.de\n***\n[2]\nDate: Thu, 13 Jan 2000 11:40:19 +0100\nFrom: leitritz@m3401.mpk.med.uni-muenchen.de\nVia: Wolfgang Preiser <W.Preiser@em.uni-frankfurt.de>\nSource: Pressemitteilungen (press release) des Robert Koch-Instituts\n<RKI_PRESSEDIENST@LISTSERV.GMD.DE>\n\nFurther update - RKI press release - imported Lassa fever - Germany\nWed, 12 Jan 2000 19:19:17 +0100\nSuspicion of Lassa fever confirmed (Update)\nThe 23-year old female German student who is currently being treated\nfor Lassa fever in the Mission Hospital in Wuerzburg arrived in\nGermany, according to latest information, not on New Year's eve but on\n7 Jan 2000, probably through Frankfurt Rhein-Main airport.\nAccording to further information she spent the night of 6-7 Jan 2000 in\na still unknown hotel in Lisbon, Portugal [now doubtful -- see [3]\nbelow - Mod.JW], and had already fallen ill with high fever in Cote\nd'Ivoire (Ivory Coast) on 2 January 2000.

The references cited below describe\nscenarios of aerosol transmission unheard of for 'other bloodborne viruses'\nsuch as hepatitis B virus, and are enough to put healthy fear into any\nperson dealing with these particular agents of VHF. Although it is difficult\nto precisely quantitate the magnitude of this risk, and despite the fact\nthat barrier nursing will eliminate the majority of nosocomial transmission\nrisk, the potential for aerosol transmission not precluded by such practices\nis nevertheless finite and\nreal.\nIt is granted that the implementation of 'special isolation precautions'\n(e.g. negative-pressure room, HEPA respirators as per MMWR 44(25):475-479,\n1995) requires perspicacious judgment, and resources which, although not\nextraordinary, are infrequently available in the third world.\nMonath, TP.

Without in any way diminishing the importance and demonstrated efficacy of\nbarrier nursing practices against nosocomial transmission of viral\nhemorrhagic fevers (VHF) (see MMWR 37(S-3):1-16, 1988), let me aver that Dr.\nRosenberg seems to overlook the very definite capability of filoviruses,\n The references cited below describe\nscenarios of aerosol transmission unheard of for 'other bloodborne viruses'\nsuch as hepatitis B virus, and are enough to put healthy fear into any\nperson dealing with these particular agents of VHF.

In May the number of cases jumped from 3 or 4 cases a week to 15 or 20.\nEfforts to contain the epidemic have been hampered by the war, which\ndestroyed medical services. Despite the current ceasefire, there is still\nlooting in the villages which hampers our ability to find and treat patients.\nThere is a lot we do not yet know about Lassa fever. Treatment is with\nRibavirin, an anti-viral drug, but it is only at the trial stage, and the\nmain clinical trials near Kenema were stopped by the war.'\nBackground\nOut of 167 patients identified in Kenema district since January 1996, 65 have\ndied. No one knows how many more are suffering in the interior of Sierra\nLeone, where populations have been cut off by guerrilla warfare.\nThe epidemic centres on Kenema, a district packed with thousands of people\nwho have fled from the recent civil war in Sierra Leone. Conditions in\nKenema are ideal for the spread of Lassa fever - unclean water, unhygienic\nfood storage, overcrowding and multiplying populations of rats. The virus is\nspread in rats' urine and excreta when they contaminate human food and water\nsupplies. The current outbreak follows an increase in the number of rats\nlocally.\nThe international medical team assisting Sierra Leone health officials\ncomprises: MERLIN (Medical Emergency Relief International), World Health\nOrganisation and the US Centers for Disease Control.\nMedical staff from MERLIN have helped local health officials to set up an\nisolation unit in Kenema Hospital for Lassa fever patients, with adequate\nbeds, water and sanitation. Supplies of Ribavirin, an antiviral drug, have\nbeen donated by CDC. MERLIN is assisting the hospital in sourcing other\nmedical supplies for the unit, including antibiotics, oral rehydration salts\nand intravenous liquids.\nMeanwhile, medical teams are visiting outlying villages around Kenema to\neducate villagers about the dangers of Lassa fever and how to avoid them\nthrough hygienic food and water storage, and control of rats.\nThe Sierra Leone government is co-ordinating with foreign agencies to provide\nhealth care and other basic services for displaced people across the country.\nIt has developed considerable experience with Lassa fever, which is endemic\nat a lower level throughout West Africa.\nLassa fever kills from shock and haemorrhaging of the internal organs,\nespecially the brain, kidneys and throat. Its early symptoms are easily\nmistaken for influenza. It can kill an adult within 10 days. It is one of a\ngroup of haemorraghic fevers which includes ebola, dengue and yellow fever,\nsome of Africa's most feared diseases.\n--\nMedical Emergency Relief International <Merlin@gn.apc.org>\n...............................................................chc\n\n*##########################################################*\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.

Simms <TES@A1.cdrh.fda.gov>\nFound the following while reading an internet healthcare news listing.\n\n<http://www.fyionline.com/infoMCI/newsletter/HEALTH-MCI.html>\n\nLassa fever has killed nine people in eastern Sierra Leone. Physicians say\nthe outbreak is the worst on record there. Dr. Simon Mardel of the British\naid agency Medical Emergency Relief International (MERLIN) told Reuters by\ntelephone from Kenema that 74 sufferers had been admitted to hospital there\nin February -- the highest number on record.\n'This is clearly the worst (Lassa) epidemic -- and I mean epidemic in the\nreal sense -- in Sierra Leone to date. There has definitely been a rapid\ndeterioration recently,' Mardel said.\nThe Lassa fever ward opened May, 1996 but there were 10 cases in February\n199[7] and the annual average is usually around 35.\nLassa fever, spread by rat urine and feces or between humans, causes fever,\nminor hemorrhaging, vomiting, chest pains and low blood pressure. It killed\nabout one in four people infected in 1996.\nThe disease is endemic in eastern Sierra Leone but Mardel blamed the surge on\npoverty caused by almost five years of civil war and a rise in the rat\npopulation.\n'People don't have the mechanisms to destroy the rats or protect their food.\nThe human element of transmission has also increased because of overcrowding\nand, as a result of the war, there is less access to health care,' he said.\nThe only known cure, Ribavirin, a costly drug previously donated by the\nUnited States is no longer produced there. 'We have only one week's supply\nleft,' Mardel said.

Peters <cjp0@CIDDVD1.EM.CDC.GOV>\nAs the recent [today] ProMED-mail posting indicates, there has been an\nupsurge of Lassa fever patients arriving in the Kenema General Hopital in\nSierra Leone. This is presumably related to conditions attendant to the\ncivil unrest, but there are no objective data to identify the actual cause\n[of the increase in the number of cases], which is in part related to the\nrenewed ability to travel and seek therapy. We have been working with the\nGovernment of Sierra Leone, Medical Emergency Relief International, and the\nWHO to assess and respond to the problem. We have provided stocks of\nintravenous ribavirin (which will soon be depleted), trained people in\nbarrier nursing, as well as providing other assistance. A few treatment\ncourses of intravenous ribavirin have been retained at CDC to respond to an\nimported US hemorrhagic fever or to laboratory accidents. There are no US\nsources for intravenous ribavirin at this time. CDC's long-term project in\nSierra Leone has been moved to Guinea and that station is serving as a\nresource to provide Sierra Leone with both trained personnel (two are in\nSierre Leone at this time) and diagnostic testing. In addition, a number of\nthe former staff members are employed by MERLIN in patient care. The\nGovernment of Sierra Leone has donated a ward and committed additional staff.\nRecently, Dr. O. Tomori, an experienced Nigerian Lassa scientist with WHO\nmade an on-site assessment.\nThe situation points out three unresolved problems:\n1. Intravenous ribavirin is in short supply world-wide and is relatively\nexpensive. There may be alternative regimens using intravenous loading doses\nwith oral follow-through but these have not been tested. This drug probably\nalso has utility in [treatment of] the arenavirus hemorrhagic fevers of South\nAmerica, Congo-Crimean hemorrhagic fever, and possibly Rift Valley fever.\n2. Lassa fever is a major problem in west Africa year-in and year-out.\nThere are no accurate data, but the estimates of the number of infections\nrange from the tens to the hundreds of thousands annually. The incidence\nfluctuates by area and by year but it is always present and, even under the\nbest of circumstances, is unlikely to be adequately addressed by rodent\ncontrol.\nYet, like many other regionally important emerging infections, vaccine\ndevelopment escapes our economic priorities. The technical basis for a\nLassa vaccine was laid by Dave Auperin, Joe McCormick, and others in SPB\n[Special Pathogen Branch, CDC/Atlanta] several years ago. Another arenavirus\ndisease, Argentine hemorrhagic fever, has been controlled through a vaccine\nso this approach is practical and feasible, yet even in the case of AHF there\nare no immediate prospects for continuing vaccine production.\n3. Social and political unrest prevents long-term economic and health\ncare development as well as the longitudinal, solidly based research that\nleads to effective preventive and therapeutic solutions.\n(The usual disclaimer applies that this is not official USPHS opinion, etc.\nbut is provided to facilitate communications among interested parties.)\n---\nC.
