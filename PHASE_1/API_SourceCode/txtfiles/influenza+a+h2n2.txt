Samples of the influenza A\n(H2N2) virus, which caused the influenza pandemic of 1957-58, were\nsent to more than 6000 labs for use in testing the labs' ability to\nidentify influenza viruses. Most of the labs were in the United\nStates. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said the\norganizations that administer proficiency testing reported that all\nthe samples had been destroyed. No reports of illness have been\nlinked with possible exposure to the samples, the CDC said. The virus\nhas not circulated since 1968, which means that most people now would\nhave little or no immunity to it.\n\"Certification of the destruction of the H2N2 samples contained in\nthe proficiency testing kits effectively ends the immediate risk\nassociated with distribution of these kits, but it is only the 1st\nstep of the public health response,\" the CDC said. A multi-agency\ntask force will investigate what caused the inclusion of H2N2 in the\ntest kits, the statement added.\nAlso today [3 May 2005], the CDC and the National Institutes of\nHealth (NIH) recommended that labs use stricter safety precautions\nwhen handling H2N2 virus samples. The agencies released a\nrecommendation that labs use Biosafety Level 3 (BSL-3) instead of\nBSL-2 precautions when working with the virus. A similar\nrecommendation was made for highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI)\nviruses and for reverse-genetics research on the 1918 pandemic flu\nvirus.\nStarting last fall [2004], samples of the H2N2 virus were sent to\nlabs in 18 countries for routine testing that usually involves more\nbenign flu strains. Meridian Bioscience Inc. of Cleveland sent the\nkits on behalf of the College of American Pathologists (CAP) and 3\nother US organizations that administer lab proficiency testing. Why\nthe H2N2 virus was used has not been fully explained. But the virus\nwas classified as BSL-2 at the time, which meant it could legally be\nused in the kits, CAP officials have said. In the testing, labs have\nto determine whether a virus is influenza and whether it is type A or\nB, without identifying the subtype. But Canadian government\nresearchers discovered in March 2005 that the virus they had been\nsent was H2N2, which led the World Health Organization on 12 Apr 2005\nto urge labs to destroy all the samples. Most laboratories quickly\ndid so, but a few samples were missing, which triggered an urgent\nsearch. CDC officials reported on 21 Apr 2005 that 99 percent of the\nsamples had already been destroyed. News reports on 25 Apr 2005 said\nthe last samples outside the United States had been destroyed at the\nAmerican University of Beirut in Lebanon, after they were found at\nthe Beirut airport.\nEarlier reports said H2N2 samples were sent to 3747 labs under CAP\nauspices and to about another 2700 labs certified by other\norganizations. All but about 75 labs that received the CAP samples\nwere in the United States, reports said. How many of the other labs\nwere in the United States has not been made clear.\nThe Biosafety Recommendations released today [3 May 2005] are part of\na new edition of guidelines for biomedical labs that will be\npublished in full this fall, the CDC said. In BSL-3 labs, agents are\nhandled with equipment designed to prevent any airborne contamination\nand resulting respiratory exposure for lab workers and others. With\nregard to the 1918 pandemic virus, the recommendations state, \"Any\nresearch involving reverse genetics of the 1918 influenza strain\nshould proceed with extreme caution. The risk to laboratory workers\nis unknown at the present time, but the pandemic potential is thought\nto be significant.\" In recent studies, researchers have engineered\nviruses similar to the 1918 pandemic strain, H1N1, and exposed mice\nto them in an effort to learn what made the virus so deadly. The 1918\npandemic is estimated to have killed between 50 million and 100\nmillion people around the world.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\nSee Also\nInfluenza A (H2N2) virus: laboratory distribution, alert 20050413.1067\n.....................cp/msp/jw\n*##########################################################*\n************************************************************\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.
