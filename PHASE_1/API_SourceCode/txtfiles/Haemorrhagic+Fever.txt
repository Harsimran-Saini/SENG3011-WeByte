The Ministry of Health [is attempting to ensure they are\ntaking the necessary precautions. Three suspected deaths have occurred and\nonly one has been confirmed. Machupo virus is endemic in this region.\nMethods of prevention are:\n1. clean and weed up to 20-30 metres around houses and to avoid the field\nmouse (_Callomys callosus_).\n2. avoid contact with faeces and urine from mice and avoid sweeping to\ncause dust.\n3. hang food up to protect food and protect other areas so as to be\ninaccessible to mice.\n4. consume only well cooked food.\nThe [virus can be contracted from contaminated food, airborne dust and\nsexual contact. People with clinical symptoms should not have sex. Clinical\nsymptoms in humans are; temperature greater than 38C, headaches, and\nsimilar to flu with fever, vomiting, and vomiting with blood. You should\nvisit the health centre as there are sufficient medications available.\nChances of death are high, between 19 and 68% of all people that contract\nthe disease. The disease is endemic to these provinces and the Ministry of\nHealth does not think it will spread to other regions.\nSource: El Deber (National newspaper), Editorial (Hans Dellien S.),\nBolivia, 4 Apr 2000 (in Spanish) [Translated and summarised by Gavin\nMacgregor-Skinner\nJust before the 1970's, the Provinces of Itenez and Mamore in the Beni were\naffected by this disease. It begins with minor symptoms of a cold and then\nvital organs: brain, lungs, liver, kidneys, skin begin bleeding, shock,\ncoma and cardiorespiratory arrest. Deaths occurred mostly in Magdalena,\ncapital of Itenez, and San Joaquin, capital of Mamore.\nBetween 1959-1970, 1,500 persons died from hemorrhagic fever, and this set\nback development in the Provinces by 20 years, the equivalent of US$40\nmillion. The areas were also affected by people who moved away and\nrelocated in other regions.\nThe cause of the haemorrhagic fever epidemic was discovered by the efforts\nof nationals and two foreign scientists: Karl Johnson and Ronald MacKenzie,\nfrom the MARU [Middle America Research Institute in Panama. The initial\noutbreak was [attributed to years of indiscriminate hunting of the\nregional feline, \"Tigrillo\" or mountain cat.The skins are sold for US$10\nand this is enough money to cover the families needs for 2 days. This small\ncat is the natural predator of the mouse (_Callomys callosus_). The mouse\nis the vector [reservoir of the Machupo virus that causes hemorrhagic\nfever. The virus was named after the river that runs close to the city of\nSan Joaquin.\nThere are three new cases of probable hemorrhagic fever in the Beni, two in\nCercado and one in Itenez. One person has died. It is alarming, that these\ncases have occurred in an area abundant with the mouse and the epidemic\nscenary is repeating. The vector could move to new areas and reproduce. The\nvector has an insatiable appetite and can affect rice, maize, yuca, bananas\nand meat with Machupo virus.\nThere is a need for monitoring the population of the mouse vector,\neducation to warn local people of the danger, precautions to be taken with\ncontaminated food and what people should do if they suspect they have\nhemorrhagic fever. Whatever action is taken to avoid this new disaster in\nthe Beni, it will be priceless in the fight against poverty.\n--\nDr Gavin Macgregor-Skinner BVSc MSc MRCVS\nUnidad Nacional de Vigilancia Epidemiol\u00f3gica y Control de Enfermedades\nAnimales In Bolivia: UNIVEP\nAv.
