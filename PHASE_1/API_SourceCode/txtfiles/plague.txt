The area is located in the most active endemic plague focus in continental Africa and borders the West Nile plague endemic focus in Uganda.\n\nOn 29 Oct 2020, the head nurse of the health area of Avari alerted the central office of the chief medical doctor of Aungba about 4 community deaths in the village Amoli, close to the Ugandan border. On 30 Oct 2020, the supervision team of the Aungba health zone carried out an outbreak investigation and recorded 7 cases of bubonic plague including 4 deaths.\n\nThe index cases appear to be 2 boys aged 13 and 10 years old from the same family residing in Amoli, who died between 26 and 27 Oct 2020; both presented a clinical prognosis consistent with the definition of bubonic plague, i.e. high fever with sudden onset, headache and painful swelling in the armpits. The other 2 deceased persons are 2 girls, aged 14 and 13 years belonging to another family from a household located close to the presumed index cases.\n\nThe inhabitants of Amoli have reported domestic and peri-domestic murine epizootics (rat falls) in the week preceding the appearance of the 1st human cases.\n\nThe investigation team searched for other cases in the area, which led to the discovery of 3 other active suspected bubonic plague cases, which were treated at the nearest health center. In addition, 26 contacts were treated preventively with doxycycline (100 mg), and the 2 houses where the deaths occurred were dusted with deltamethrin to control potentially infected fleas.\n\nThis is the 8th plague outbreak reported in less than a year from the plague endemic focus in the DR Congo.\n\n--\nPascal Adroba, MD\nProvincial Division of Health\nIturi, DR Congo\n\nDelphonse Unenall, MD\nAungba Health Zone Chief MD\nIturi, DR Congo\n\nAnne Laudisoit, PhD\nEcohealth Alliance\n<laudisoit@ecohealthalliance.org>\n\n[Most cases are due to bubonic plague following the bite of an infected rodent flea causing a swollen and very tender lymph gland.

Since the start of the year [2021], 37 suspected cases have been reported, affecting multiple regions, including Alaotra-Mangoro, Analamanga, Haute Matsiatra, and Itasy. Roughly 9 deaths have been associated with this disease activity. This represents the most complete data available as of 12 Mar 2021.\n\nPlague is endemic to Madagascar, where 200-700 cases are reported each year, primarily the bubonic form. The risk of plague spreading to humans is elevated in Madagascar, where the fleas that transmit the disease are highly resistant to insecticide. The poor state of Madagascar's public health system and limited access to healthcare in rural areas may also facilitate the spread of the disease.\n\nPlague is caused by a bacterium that is usually transmitted through the bite of an infected flea. However, an infection can also occur through direct contact with tissues or fluids from infected animals, such as a scratch or bite. Bubonic plague occurs when the bacteria infect a person's lymph nodes. This form of plague is not easily transmissible from person to person. However, when the bacteria spread through the bloodstream to the lungs, pneumonic plague can transmit directly from person to person via respiratory droplets containing the plague bacteria. Symptoms of plague generally develop 1-7 days after exposure. All forms of plague cause nondescript symptoms, such as fever, chills, and extreme weakness. Symptoms of bubonic plague also include swollen, tender, and painful lymph nodes and symptoms of pneumonic plague include pneumonia with shortness of breath, chest pain, and cough.\n\nConsult a travel medicine provider before departure regarding plague vaccination. Practice basic health precautions. Avoid flea bites. Seek medical attention if symptoms develop within a week of being in affected areas.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Plague infections in Madagascar have been relatively quiet since the dramatic outbreak in 2017.\n\nThe following paragraph is from Chanteau S, Ratsifasoamanana L, Rasoamanana B, et al.: Plague, a reemerging disease in Madagascar.

In the port of Mahajanga, plague has been reintroduced, and epidemics occur every year. In Antananarivo, the capital, the number of new cases has increased, and many rodents are infected with Yersinia pestis. Despite surveillance for the sensitivity of Y. pestis and fleas to drugs and insecticides and control measures to prevent the spread of sporadic cases, the elimination of plague has been difficult because the host and reservoir of the bacillus, Rattus rattus, is both a domestic and a sylvatic rat.'\n\nFatalities related to plague usually are caused by spread of the organism from the bubo (the very painful infected lymph node that drains the area where the flea bite occurred) to the bloodstream. The bacteremia can cause a coagulopathy, producing the purpura seen in the 'black plague,' and also may spread to the lungs causing a hemorrhagic pneumonia. It is the pneumonia that can facilitate person-to-person transmission.\n\nMadagascar was the location of the isolation of multi-antimicrobial resistant _Yersinia pestis_ in 1995 (Galimand M, Guiyoule A, Gerbaud G, et al.: Multidrug resistance in _Yersinia pestis_ mediated by a transferable plasmid.

'We also offer a friendly reminder: even in the midst of a global pandemic, other diseases still occur in New Mexico, and there are steps people can take to keep themselves and their pets safe.'\n\nThe cat, which became ill in early January [2021], has now recovered following veterinary treatment.\n\nPlague is a bacterial disease in wildlife and is generally transmitted to pets through the bites of infected fleas or after eating an infected animal. Humans can also contract plague via infected fleas or direct contact with infected animals.\n\nSymptoms of plague in humans include sudden onset of fever, chills, headache, and weakness. In most cases there is a painful swelling of the lymph node in the groin, armpit, or neck area. Plague symptoms in cats and dogs are fever, lethargy, and loss of appetite; there may be swelling in the lymph nodes under the jaw. With prompt diagnosis and appropriate antibiotic treatment, the probability of death in people and pets can be greatly reduced. Physicians or veterinarians who suspect plague should promptly report to NMDOH.\n\nTo prevent plague,\n- avoid sick or dead rodents and rabbits, as well as their nests and burrows;\n- prevent your pets from roaming and hunting;\n- talk to your veterinarian about using an appropriate flea control product on your pets;\n- have any sick pets examined promptly by a veterinarian;\n- contact your medical provider about any unexplained illness involving a sudden and severe fever;\n- clean up areas near the home where rodents could live, such as woodpiles, brush piles, junk, and abandoned vehicles;\n- place hay, wood, and compost piles as far as possible from your home;\n- avoid leaving pet food and water where rodents and wildlife can access it.\n\nFor more information, including fact sheets in English and Spanish, go to the Department of Health's website at https://nmhealth.org/about/erd/ideb/zdp/plg.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Plague is primarily a disease of wild rodents. It is caused by the bacterium _Yersinia pestis_, which is mainly spread by the bites of infectious fleas. The bacterium is not native to North America. When it was introduced, it became established in some rodent populations. Surveillance efforts testing fleas are very important to detect circulation of _Y. pestis_ and risk of infection.\n\nPlague may infect human beings through several routes: 1) the bite of an infected flea carried by a rodent or, rarely, other animals (mentioned previously); 2) direct contact with contaminated tissues, generally from an animal; or 3) in rare cases, inhalation of respiratory secretions from infected people or animals.\n\nClinical signs in pets involve a localized swelling, such as under the jaw in cats, but also in the inguinal region or under the front leg (the armpit, if you will), lethargy, anorexia, and fever (or chills). These clinical signs may be present in the dog as well. Swelling under the jaw in cats is frequently mistaken as a cat-fight abscess. When this mistake occurs and the caregiver or veterinarian does not take precautions, such as exam gloves, the swelling may rupture on palpation and possibly expose the owner or the veterinarian though even small scratches on the hands or cuticles of the fingers.\n\nThis cat is clearly an indication that the _Y. pestis_ bacteria is circulating in the area's fleas.\n\nIf your pets are not on flea prevention, please ask your veterinarian about the best flea prevention. Bathing your pet in dishwashing soap is not sufficient to help your pet avoid diseases carried by fleas. Some of the over-the-counter flea prevention products may be harmful to your pet, so please check with your veterinarian. It is also a good time to make sure your pet is current on a rabies shot.\n\nKeeping your pets inside is best, and being inside a yard will help diminish your pet's ability to consume a dead animal and will further reduce the risk of plague to both you and your animal. - Mod.TG\n\nHealthMap/ProMED map:\nLos Alamos County, New Mexico, United States: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/7430]", "summary": "\n\nTo prevent plague,\n- avoid sick or dead rodents and rabbits, as well as their nests and burrows;\n- prevent your pets from roaming and hunting;\n- talk to your veterinarian about using an appropriate flea control product on your pets;\n- have any sick pets examined promptly by a veterinarian;\n- contact your medical provider about any unexplained illness involving a sudden and severe fever;\n- clean up areas near the home where rodents could live, such as woodpiles, brush piles, junk, and abandoned vehicles;\n- place hay, wood, and compost piles as far as possible from your home;\n- avoid leaving pet food and water where rodents and wildlife can access it.

Three of the 6 patients have died. 17 out of all the 21 Mongolian provinces are now at risk of the bubonic plague, the NCZD said, urging the public to avoid eating marmot meat.\n\nThe bubonic plague is a bacterial disease spread by fleas living on wild rodents such as marmots and can kill an adult in less than 24 hours if not treated in time, according to the WHO.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Plague is caused by _Yersinia pestis_. Plague appears to be more prevalent this year (2020) in Mongolia.

The swollen gland is called a 'bubo.' Bubonic plague should be suspected when a person develops a swollen gland, fever, chills, headache, and extreme exhaustion, and has a history of possible exposure to infected rodents, rabbits, or fleas.

As the plague bacteria multiply in the bloodstream, they spread rapidly throughout the body and cause a severe and often fatal condition. Infection of the lungs with the plague bacterium causes the pneumonic form of plague, a severe respiratory illness. The infected person may experience high fever, chills, cough, and breathing difficulty and may expel bloody sputum. If plague patients are not given specific antimicrobial therapy, the disease can progress rapidly to death. At this stage, person-to-person spread can occur, causing other cases of 'primary' plague pneumonia. A quarantine would be required with contact tracing and even prophylactic antimicrobials if the index case or cases actually had plague pneumonia.\n\nPlague is endemic in Mongolia. Marmots such as the Tarvaga, the Tarbagan or Mongolian marmot, _Marmota sibirica_, a large rodent related to the American woodchuck (_M. monax_), are thought to be significant zoonotic reservoirs for _Y. pestis_ in Eastern Asia.

The case, reported to the department on 3 Sep [2020], is a resident from a rural county in Colorado. The 1st case was diagnosed earlier this summer in a resident from southwest Colorado. The cases are unrelated. Both cases had exposure to sick animals: a squirrel and a cat [respectively]. Neither case is suspected of having spread the infection to other people or animals. These are the 1st cases of human plague reported in the state since 2015. In the past 10 years, there have been 14 cases of human plague in Colorado.\n\nEarlier this year [2020], plague bacteria were confirmed in rodents in Broomfield, Jefferson, and Adams counties as well as a cat in Elbert County.\n\nCDPHE reminds residents that it is not uncommon for plague to be seen this time of year, but it can also be found in rodents year-round. It sometimes spills over into other wildlife species as well as domestic cats and dogs.\n\nPeople should take the following precautions to protect themselves and their pets:\n- Do not directly handle any wildlife.\n- Keep pets away from wildlife, especially dead rodents and rabbits.\n- Don't let dogs or cats hunt prairie dogs, squirrels, voles, other rodents, or rabbits.\n- Don't allow pets to roam freely.\n- Treat all pets for fleas according to a veterinarian's advice.\n- If your pet develops a sudden illness after contact with wildlife, call a veterinarian immediately.\n- Do not feed wildlife. This attracts them to your property, brings them in close contact, and increases the risk of disease transmission.\n- Do not attempt to remove or kill prairie dogs. This may increase the risk of plague for you and your domestic animals.\n- Be aware of rodent and rabbit populations in your area and report sudden die-offs or multiple dead animals to your local health department.\n\nPlague is most commonly spread to people by the bite of an infected flea but also may be transmitted by infected animal tissues, fluids, or respiratory droplets. Infected fleas may be found near areas where multiple rodents or rabbits have died; avoiding these areas and not allowing pets or other animals to explore these areas will decrease the risk of getting plague. Citizens with direct exposure to fleas or wildlife in the affected areas may be at risk. People who think they have been exposed should contact a healthcare provider immediately. Symptoms include sudden fever, headache, chills, weakness, and tender, painful lymph nodes. While there are no publicly available vaccines to prevent plague in people, if caught early, it can be successfully treated with antimicrobials in both people and pets.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The typical sign of the most common form of human plague is a swollen and very tender lymph gland, accompanied by pain. The swollen gland is called a 'bubo.' Bubonic plague should be suspected when a person develops a swollen gland, fever, chills, headache, and extreme exhaustion and has a history of possible exposure to infected rodents, rabbits, or fleas. A person usually becomes ill with bubonic plague 2-6 days after being infected.\n\nWhen bubonic plague is left untreated or occurring without a bubo (which makes the diagnosis more difficult to make initially), plague bacteria invade the bloodstream (septicemic plague). As the plague bacteria multiply in the bloodstream, they spread rapidly throughout the body and cause a severe and often fatal condition. Infection of the lungs with the plague bacterium causes the pneumonic form of plague, a severe respiratory illness. The infected person may experience high fever, chills, cough, and breathing difficulty and may expel bloody sputum. If plague patients are not given specific antimicrobial therapy, the disease can progress rapidly to death. About 14% (one in 7) of all plague cases in the United States are fatal (https://portal.ct.gov/-/media/Departments-and-Agencies/DPH/dph/communications/CERC/PlagueFSwebpdf.pdf).\n\nThe clinical manifestations of the human case and those of the cat are not stated here. Clinical signs in pets involve a localized swelling, such as under the jaw in cats, but also in the inguinal region or under the front leg (the armpit, if you will), lethargy, anorexia, and fever. These clinical signs may be present in the dog as well. Swelling under the jaw in cats is frequently mistaken as a cat-fight abscess. If one lives in a plague-endemic area, please take your pet to a veterinarian if you notice any abnormalities.\n\nBe sure to consult your veterinarian if you find a lump on your pet, as well as to get the best flea prevention treatment for your pet. It may be necessary to have your yard and/or home treated for fleas. Vacuum your home, including any bedding and furniture, and immediately upon finishing take the vacuum back outside, seal it in a plastic bag, and dispose of it. This type of cleaning will have to be repeated every week for 4-6 weeks to break the cycle of the flea in the home. - Mod.LL\n\nHealthMap/ProMED map:\nColorado, United States: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/209]", "summary": "A ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n Communicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The typical sign of the most common form of human plague is a swollen and very tender lymph gland, accompanied by pain. \n\nWhen bubonic plague is left untreated or occurring without a bubo (which makes the diagnosis more difficult to make initially), plague bacteria invade the bloodstream (septicemic plague).

Alerted by this event, the head nurse visited the household of the deceased patient in the Onuoyia village (N 02 deg 48'13.1', E 030 deg 29'33.2'') to investigate further. He found that the 6 year old brother of the patient had similar symptoms without complication (consistent with the case definition for suspected bubonic plague - see further) and recovered after a 10-day treatment with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. However, a member of the network of volunteer community relay (RECO, or relais communautaire) notified the head nurse that on 15 Nov 2020 an 11 year old girl from the same family living in a neighboring household also died in a clinical picture of chills, headache, and painful lymph node swelling behind the ear. The parents treated the child for malaria, with no improvement. The girl identified as the index case died in the community on 15 Nov 2020.\n\nOn 27 Nov 2020, a 3 year old girl of the mother's family, who attended the funeral wake of the index case, presented with fever, painful swelling of the left axillary lymph node, and abdominal pain. She was treated at home for malaria, again, by the parent, with no improvement. The girl died on the 29 Nov 2020. The experienced head nurse of Kumbuku health area then organized an active case-tracing and surveillance in the community with the help of the RECOs. However, the information did not reach the central bureau of the health zone before 14 Dec 2020.\n\nSuspected plague is defined -- according to WHO -- in any person with a rapid onset of fever, chills, severe malaise, and prostration accompanied by the following: 1. for bubonic plague, very painful swelling of the lymph nodes (bubo); 2. for pneumonic plague, coughing with blood-stained sputum, chest pain, and breathing difficulties. In view of the increased number of people affected through active surveillance, the health center nurse issued an alert to the health zone central bureau for further investigation.\n\nAs soon as they were able to investigate, on 21 Dec 2020, the Biringi and Aru health zone medical team, consisting of the Biringi zone chief medical officer, the nurse supervisor of the Aru health zone, and the laboratory technician from Aru General Hospital, investigated 58 cases and 5 community deaths reported at the Azumba and Kumbuku health centers. They took 9 samples of bubo aspirate, which were sent to the national reference laboratory (Institut National de Recherche Biomedicale, INRB), 6 of which tested positive with a rapid diagnostic test for plague. The team visited the villages of Azumba and Onu Oyia (Biringi health zone), where 41 additional cases were identified among the population with the help of the RECO. In addition, rat epizootics were reported in the immediate vicinity of the outbreak areas around the beginning of November 2020 in the Onu Ayia, Odhu, Linya, and Ayaya villages. Moreover, according to the zone chief medical officer, access to drinking water for the entire health zone is only 2%, which is an additional public health problem for ensuring sound hygiene. With the degrading situation, the Biringi health zone medical team called on Malteser International NGO for support. The financial and logistical intervention of Malteser International allowed to implement chemoprophylaxis and treat about 86 suspected cases and 2129 contacts with doxycycline (100 mg), while 152 sick patient's homes were dusted with deltamethrin.\n\nDue to the high number of cases (more than 200) and the proximity of refugee camps and internally displaced people, a 2nd mission was carried out by the Ituri Provincial Division of Health (DPS) team with the financial support of UNICEF and WHO. Between 18 and 26 Dec 2020, they conducted an in-depth rapid outbreak investigation mission (semi-structured interviews, flea collection, and dead rodent sampling, following an original protocol developed in collaboration with international colleagues) in the Biringi health zone and brought 9 tons of UNICEF equipment to the Biringi, Aru, and Aungba health zones, which regularly notify plague (PPE [personal protective equipment], WASH [water, sanitation and hygiene], sanitation material).\n\nFlea traps (light traps) were also placed for 3 consecutive nights in 10 houses (21-24 Dec 2020) in the affected villages (Onu Ayia, Odhu, Linya, and Ayaya), and 7 houses had been dusted (insecticide) between 8 and 10 Dec 2020 by the Biringi health zone team. A total of 27 fleas were collected, namely _Ctenocephalides felis strongylus_ (26) and _Ctenocephalides canis_ (1). It is worth noting that DNA of _Yersinia pestis_ had been detected in the former species further south within the Ituri endemic plague focus in 2007 (Leulmi, et al., PLOS NTD, 2014; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0003152).\n\nSix RDT [rapid diagnostic test] for plague were also tested on dead rats (_Rattus rattus_) found in the house and vicinity of patients' households; one was positive for plague.\n\nAs of 31 Dec 2020, the Biringi health zone has reported 256 cases of bubonic plague with 7 deaths. Overall, women (51.2%) and men (48.7%) are equally affected; however, adolescents (under 17 years old) seem the most at risk, representing 78.9% of the sick people. The behavioral risk factors of exposure for this observation have not been solved.\n\nIn this region, where there are nearly 47 000 internally displaced refugees from South Sudan, with some moving freely between the 2 countries, the risk of a regional flare-up is to be considered if the epidemic also reaches this camp. The NGO ADES, which manages the closest camp (7000 people), has been asked to reinforce hygiene and sanitation measures. The medical staff of the affected health zones, the RECO, the DPS, WHO, and UNICEF are monitoring the situation.\n\ncommunicated by:\nCleophas Ntumba Jalwiny\nPascal Adroba\nGustave Losa Lona\nJean Baptiste Shuli Tchomba\nMichel Mandro\nAlex Nyakabasa Murhula\nBunia, Ituri, DR Congo\nAnne Laudisoit, Ecohealth Alliance\n<laudisoit@ecohealthalliance.org>\n\n[Most cases are due to bubonic plague following the bite of an infected rodent flea, causing a swollen and very tender lymph gland. The swollen gland is called a bubo. Bubonic plague should be suspected when a person develops a swollen gland, fever, chills, headache, and extreme exhaustion and has a history of possible exposure to infected rodents, rabbits, or fleas. A person usually becomes ill with bubonic plague 2-6 days after being bitten.\n\nWhen bubonic plague is left untreated, plague bacteria invade the bloodstream. The bacteremia can also occur as an initial event. As the plague bacteria multiply in the bloodstream, they spread rapidly throughout the body and cause a severe and often fatal condition. Infection of the lungs with the plague bacterium causes the pneumonic form of plague, a severe respiratory illness. The infected person may experience high fever, chills, cough, and breathing difficulty and may expel bloody sputum. If plague patients are not given specific antibiotic therapy, the disease can progress rapidly to death.\n\nProMED-mail thanks Dr Anne Laudisoit and colleagues for sending this report. - Mod.LL\n\nHealthMap/ProMED-mail map of DR Congo: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/194.]", "summary": "On 22 Nov 2020, the head nurse of the Kumbuku health center (trained in plague outbreak investigation while working in Aru health zone) diagnosed plague in an 11 year old boy brought in as an emergency to the health center by his family in an altered general status (coma, high fever, and bilateral swelling of axillary lymph nodes). \n\nAs soon as they were able to investigate, on 21 Dec 2020, the Biringi and Aru health zone medical team, consisting of the Biringi zone chief medical officer, the nurse supervisor of the Aru health zone, and the laboratory technician from Aru General Hospital, investigated 58 cases and 5 community deaths reported at the Azumba and Kumbuku health centers. \n\nSuspected plague is defined -- according to WHO -- in any person with a rapid onset of fever, chills, severe malaise, and prostration accompanied by the following: 1. for bubonic plague, very painful swelling of the lymph nodes (bubo); 2. for pneumonic plague, coughing with blood-stained sputum, chest pain, and breathing difficulties.

The case is a 37-year-old man from Tsetseg soum, Khovd province and is currently hospitalized in critical condition.\n\nIt is reported the patient ate marmot meat. Since the beginning of 2020, 13 human plague cases have been reported (9 suspect and 4 confirmed).\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Plague is caused by _Yersinia pestis_. Plague appears to be more prevalent this year (2020) in Mongolia. It is not clear that person-to-person spread has occurred.\n\nMost cases are due to bubonic plague following the bite of an infected rodent flea, causing a swollen and very tender lymph gland. The swollen gland is called a 'bubo'. Bubonic plague should be suspected when a person develops a swollen gland, fever, chills, headache, and extreme exhaustion, and has a history of possible exposure to infected rodents, rabbits, or fleas. A person usually becomes ill with bubonic plague 2-6 days after being bitten.\n\nWhen bubonic plague is left untreated, plague bacteria invade the bloodstream, which can occur even without a clear bubo. As the plague bacteria multiply in the bloodstream, they spread rapidly throughout the body and cause a severe and often fatal condition. Infection of the lungs with the plague bacterium causes the pneumonic form of plague, a severe respiratory illness. The infected person may experience high fever, chills, cough, and breathing difficulty and may expel bloody sputum. If plague patients are not given specific antimicrobial therapy, the disease can progress rapidly to death. At this stage, person-to-person spread can occur, causing other cases of 'primary' plague pneumonia. A quarantine would be required with contact tracing and even prophylactic antimicrobials if the index case or cases actually had plague pneumonia.\n\nPlague is endemic in Mongolia. Marmots such as the Tarvaga, the Tarbagan or Mongolian marmot, _Marmota sibirica_, a large rodent related to the American woodchuck (_M. monax_), are thought to be significant zoonotic reservoirs for _Y. pestis_ in Eastern Asia. The name marmot comes from French 'marmotte', from Latin _mures monti_ 'mountain mouse'.\n\nWhile foodborne transmission of _Y. pestis_ has been described (such as Leslie T, et al. Outbreak of gastroenteritis caused by _Yersinia pestis_ in Afghanistan. Epidemiol Infect. 2011; 139(5): 728-35; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20663260), it is far more likely that the bubonic plague cases were acquired via the bites of infected fleas. - Mod.LL\n\nMaps of Mongolia: http://www.ezilon.com/maps/images/asia/political-map-of-Mongolia.gif and http://healthmap.org/promed/p/67210]", "summary": "A ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n \n\nWhen bubonic plague is left untreated, plague bacteria invade the bloodstream, which can occur even without a clear bubo.

The 12 cases who presented at hospital were initially assumed to have tularemia, and all were successfully treated with gentamicin. When, however, their sera were tested for evidence of _Yersinia pestis_ or _Francisella tularensis_ infection (using hemagglutination, enzyme immuno-assays for specific IgM or the F1 antigen of _Y. pestis_, and micro-agglutination tests), all 12 were found to have anti-_Y. pestis_ IgM. Three dogs shot near the Saudi Arabian border were also found seropositive for antibodies against _Y. pestis_. Eleven of the 12 patients reported that 2-4 days before their symptoms appeared, they had eaten the meat cut from the carcass of the same camel, either raw (10 cases) or cooked (one case). All 12 patients were diagnosed as cases of pharyngeal plague (the 1st cases of plague reported in Jordan for more than 80 years), caused by _Y. pestis_ that most had acquired when they ate raw meat from a camel that was infected with the pathogen.\n\n---\nPlague is endemic in Mongolia. Marmots such as the Tarvaga, the Tarbagan or Mongolian marmot, _Marmota sibirica_, a large rodent related to the American woodchuck (_M. monax_), are thought to be significant zoonotic reservoirs for _Y. pestis_ in Eastern Asia.

The individual is currently under the care of a medical professional and is recovering at home. It is believed that the person, an avid walker, may have been bitten by an infected flea while walking their dog along the Truckee River Corridor north of Highway 50 or the Tahoe Keys area in South Lake Tahoe. Health officials started investigating the situation after being notified by the California Department of Public Health (CDPH).\n\n'Plague is naturally present in many parts of California, including higher elevation areas of El Dorado County,' said El Dorado County Public Health Officer, Dr. Nancy Williams. 'It's important that individuals take precautions for themselves and their pets when outdoors, especially while walking, hiking and/or camping in areas where wild rodents are present. Human cases of plague are extremely rare but can be very serious.'\n\nSeveral areas of South Lake Tahoe have signs posted to advise the public of the presence of plague and ways to prevent exposure. In past years, chipmunks with plague have been found near the Taylor Creek, Kiva Beach, Tallac Historic Site and Fallen Leaf Lake, among others.\n\nPlague is caused by the bacterium, _Yersinia pestis_. Plague bacteria are most often transmitted by the bites of fleas that have acquired the bacteria from infected squirrels, chipmunks and other wild rodents. Dogs and cats may also bring plague-infected fleas into the home. People can get plague when they are bitten by infected fleas. Plague can be prevented by avoiding contact with wild rodents, and by keeping pets away from rodent burrows.\n\nSymptoms of plague usually show up within 2 weeks of exposure to an infected animal or flea and include fever, nausea, weakness and swollen lymph nodes. Plague can be effectively treated with antimicrobials if detected early.\n\nCDPH routinely monitors rodent populations for plague activity in California and closely coordinates with county health officials. Surveillance activities in El Dorado County from 2016 to 2019 found a total of 20 rodents (ground squirrels or chipmunks) with evidence of exposure to the plague bacterium. These rodents were identified in the South Lake Tahoe area, at or near the Tallac Historic Site, Fallen Leaf Campground and/or Taylor Creek Visitor Center. There were no recent reports of plague-associated illness in people in El Dorado County prior to the current case. The last reported cases of plague in California were 2 human cases which were exposed to infected rodents or their fleas in Yosemite National Park in 2015. Both people were treated and recovered. These were the 1st reported human cases in the state since 2006.\n\nTips to prevent plague include the following:\n- Do not feed squirrels, chipmunks or other wild rodents.\n- Never touch sick, injured or dead rodents.\n- Do not allow your pets to play with or pick up sick, injured or dead rodents.\n- Do not camp, sleep or rest near animal burrows or areas where dead rodents are observed.\n- Look for and heed posted warning signs.\n- Wear long pants tucked into boot tops and spray insect repellent containing DEET on socks and pant cuffs to reduce exposure to fleas.\n- Leave pets home if possible; otherwise keep pets on a leash. Do not allow pets to approach sick or dead rodents or explore rodent burrows.\n- Protect pets with flea control products.\n- Pet cats are highly susceptible to plague and can pose a direct threat to humans. Keep cats away from rodents. Consult a veterinarian if your cat becomes sick after being in contact with rodents.\n- If you get sick after being in an area where plague is known to occur, consult a physician and tell them you may have been exposed to plague.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Although not specifically stated, the case was likely related to bubonic plague.\n\nThe following is a short history of the introduction of _Yersinia pestis_ into the USA (http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aso/databank/entries/dm00bu.html):\n\nIn the summer of 1899, a ship sailing from Hong Kong to San Francisco had had 2 cases of plague on board. Because of this, although no passengers were ill when the ship reached San Francisco, it was to be quarantined on Angel Island. When the boat was searched, 11 stowaways were found -- the next day 2 were missing. Their bodies were later found in the Bay, and autopsy showed they contained plague bacilli. Despite this scare, there was no immediate outbreak of disease. But rats from the ship probably had something to do with the epidemic that hit San Francisco 9 months later.\n\nOn 6 Mar 1900, a city health officer autopsied a deceased Chinese man and found organisms in the body that looked like plague. In 1894, 2 research physicians had simultaneously and independently identified the bacillus that causes bubonic plague. Shibasaburo Kitasato published his findings in Japanese and English; Alexandre Yersin published in French. People in different parts of the world credited one or the other with the discovery, depending which journals they had read. (Since 1970 the bacillus has been known as _Yersinia pestis_.) That the plague had an identifiable 'germ' was known. But other recent findings had not been disseminated -- or believed. Most people felt that the germ infected humans through food or open wounds. Disinfection campaigns were the order of the day. In some places they ran carbolic acid through sewers, actually spreading the disease faster because it flushed out rats that had lived there.\n\nBack in San Francisco, however, political issues vied with scientific efforts. Anti-Chinese feeling ran strong in the city then, and the 1st step taken was to quarantine Chinatown. The Chinese objected, and so did the business community. Not because they wanted to protect the rights of the Chinese, but it was bad for business to have people thinking there was plague in their city or state. The quarantine was lifted but health officials ran house-to-house inspections of Chinatown. People resisted, hiding their dead and locking their doors. But 2 more plague victims turned up. The city Board of Health officially announced that plague was present in the city. The governor refused to believe it or to do anything to help in the antiplague effort. The Surgeon General got permission from President McKinley to pass antiplague regulations. Others still denied the existence of plague, although more and more states in the country were stopping trade with California.\n\nCommissions and boards formed, fought with the governor, and were disbanded, underfunded, and reformed. Meanwhile, more plague cases were found. In April 1901, a clean-up campaign of Chinatown was undertaken, scouring almost 1200 houses and 14 000 rooms. In 1903, a new governor took office and vowed to help the boards of health in every way. On 29 Feb 1904, a woman in the town of Concord, California, died of plague, its last victim -- for a while. There had been 121 cases in San Francisco and 5 outside, with 122 deaths.\n\nKnowledge, like illness, spreads. In the next few years, information about the plague's causes and transmission would be clarified. In 1894, physician Mary Miles in Canton, China, had reported the widespread death of rats in plague epidemics. But people assumed the rats caught the disease from humans. In 1897, Japanese physician Masanori Ogata wrote 'one should pay attention to insects like fleas for, as the rat becomes cold after death, they leave their host and may transmit the plague virus directly to man.' Paul Louis Simmond put all the accumulated observations together, made his own observations (societal and microscopic), and experimented with the bacillus, rats, and fleas. He proved that rat fleas bit people (which went against received wisdom), and that a sick animal could not transmit the disease if it didn't have fleas. Simmond published his conclusions in 1898 and was roundly ridiculed. But in 1905, a British commission published some of the same findings and in 1908, issued a report confirming all of Simmond's conclusions (though not crediting him).\n\nIn 1906, an earthquake of record proportions devastated San Francisco. The ruin of the city's buildings made not just people, but rats, homeless. The subsequent year or 2 of living in refugee camps while rebuilding was highly conducive to rat and flea infestations. In 1907, cases of plague were reported. But with hindsight on the last epidemic and new knowledge from research, officials launched a new kind of campaign. They offered a bounty on rats. A similar rat-catching campaign had been used successfully to fight plague in New Orleans. It worked as well in San Francisco, and though this 2nd epidemic was stronger than the 1st, it was brought to halt in 1909. - Mod.LL\n\nHealthMap/ProMED map:\nCalifornia, United States: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/204]", "summary": "A ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n Communicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Although not specifically stated, the case was likely related to bubonic plague. \n\nTips to prevent plague include the following:\n- Do not feed squirrels, chipmunks or other wild rodents. \n\nThe following is a short history of the introduction of _Yersinia pestis_ into the USA (http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aso/databank/entries/dm00bu.html):\n\nIn the summer of 1899, a ship sailing from Hong Kong to San Francisco had had 2 cases of plague on board. The last reported cases of plague in California were 2 human cases which were exposed to infected rodents or their fleas in Yosemite National Park in 2015. \n\nSymptoms of plague usually show up within 2 weeks of exposure to an infected animal or flea and include fever, nausea, weakness and swollen lymph nodes. If you get sick after being in an area where plague is known to occur, consult a physician and tell them you may have been exposed to plague. PLAGUE - USA (05): (CALIFORNIA)\n*******************************\n Plague bacteria are most often transmitted by the bites of fleas that have acquired the bacteria from infected squirrels, chipmunks and other wild rodents. \n\n'Plague is naturally present in many parts of California, including higher elevation areas of El Dorado County,' said El Dorado County Public Health Officer, Dr. Nancy Williams. Surveillance activities in El Dorado County from 2016 to 2019 found a total of 20 rodents (ground squirrels or chipmunks) with evidence of exposure to the plague bacterium. Plague can be prevented by avoiding contact with wild rodents, and by keeping pets away from rodent burrows. \n\nCDPH routinely monitors rodent populations for plague activity in California and closely coordinates with county health officials. \n\nSeveral areas of South Lake Tahoe have signs posted to advise the public of the presence of plague and ways to prevent exposure. In 1897, Japanese physician Masanori Ogata wrote 'one should pay attention to insects like fleas for, as the rat becomes cold after death, they leave their host and may transmit the plague virus directly to man.' \n- Pet cats are highly susceptible to plague and can pose a direct threat to humans. On 6 Mar 1900, a city health officer autopsied a deceased Chinese man and found organisms in the body that looked like plague. \n- Do not allow your pets to play with or pick up sick, injured or dead rodents. People can get plague when they are bitten by infected fleas. \n- Do not camp, sleep or rest near animal burrows or areas where dead rodents are observed. Dogs and cats may also bring plague-infected fleas into the home. In 1894, 2 research physicians had simultaneously and independently identified the bacillus that causes bubonic plague. The city Board of Health officially announced that plague was present in the city. Not because they wanted to protect the rights of the Chinese, but it was bad for business to have people thinking there was plague in their city or state. In 1894, physician Mary Miles in Canton, China, had reported the widespread death of rats in plague epidemics. There were no recent reports of plague-associated illness in people in El Dorado County prior to the current case. \n- Never touch sick, injured or dead rodents. He proved that rat fleas bit people (which went against received wisdom), and that a sick animal could not transmit the disease if it didn't have fleas. In past years, chipmunks with plague have been found near the Taylor Creek, Kiva Beach, Tallac Historic Site and Fallen Leaf Lake, among others. \n- Wear long pants tucked into boot tops and spray insect repellent containing DEET on socks and pant cuffs to reduce exposure to fleas.", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "plague"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["1908-03-25 00:00:00", "2021-03-05 00:00:00", "1905-03-25 00:00:00", "1909-03-25 00:00:00", "1907-03-25 00:00:00", "1906-03-25 00:00:00", "1903-03-25 00:00:00", "1897-03-25 00:00:00", "2006-03-25 00:00:00", "1900-03-06 00:00:00", "1894-03-25 00:00:00", "1904-02-29 00:00:00", "2015-03-25 00:00:00", "1970-03-25 00:00:00", "1898-03-25 00:00:00", "1901-04-25 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Hong Kong", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "San Francisco", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "United States", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Canton", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "California", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Concord", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Highway", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "LL", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Yersinia", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "El Dorado County", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "New Orleans", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "USA", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "CALIFORNIA", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Kiva Beach", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "China", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "7622263", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Plague - USA (02): (NM) bubonic", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=7622263", "date": "2020-07-29 08:22:16", "main_text": "PLAGUE - USA (02): (NEW MEXICO) BUBONIC\n***************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Mon 27 Jul 2020 11:30 AM MDT\nSource: KOB.com [edited\nhttps://www.kob.com/albuquerque-news/new-mexico-reports-first-2020-human-bubonic-plague-case/5808212/\n\n\nThe New Mexico Department of Health [NMDOH] is reporting the state's 1st human plague case of 2020.

As stated in the WHO article, since 12 Jun 2020, an upsurge of plague cases has been noted in the Rethy Health zone, Ituri province where response has been hampered by the insecurity due to the presence of the CODECO [Cooperative for the Development of Congo] armed group in the region. The COVID-19 pandemics and the rise in cases in Bunia town are further complicating the response team interventions in the area. Other health zones have since then been affected and the case number in Rethy health zone is still increasing with 62 cases reported to date of which 6 bubonic plague cases since 1 Aug 2020. It strongly suggests that plague is actively circulating in the rodent and flea population in the whole region. Indeed, 2 additional events are worth reporting.\n\nOn 22 Jul 2020, the central office of the Aru health zone (BCZ [Health Zone Central Office]), Ituri Province, Congo DR received an alert from the Titular Nurse of the Oronzi Health Area reporting a large rat fall around and inside houses in the Burenga village (N2.81114, E30.79158). This village is located 90 km [56 mi] north from the on-going Rethy outbreak area and 10 km [6.2 mi] west to the Uganda border. This information was relayed by the RECO (Community Relay Network) network who are volunteers trained in community monitoring and surveillance.\n\nOn 23 Jul 2020, a team composed of the technician from Aru General Reference Hospital (HGR) and the Chief Physician of Aru HGR -- who is the focal point for plague surveillance in this plague endemic zone -- was sent to the field to carry out an investigation. Upon arrival, the team observed a mass die-off of a single Muridae rodent species, the black rat (_Rattus rattus_). 3 blood samples were taken on freshly dead rat carcasses and the rapid diagnostic tests performed on fresh rat carcasses were positive for plague. No human cases have been reported to date.\n\nThe team has instructed the RECO to carry out insecticidal dusting of houses (as a measure to prevent flea borne plague transmission) by spraying them with a deltamethrin-based solution, to raise awareness among the population and finally to go to the Health Centre as soon as symptoms consistent with either forms of plague appear. This rapid response highlights the success of recent community awareness campaigns that followed the Rethy Area outbreak reported on 14 Jun 2020 (ProMED archive no. 20200617.7480784) and updated on 25 Jul 2020 by WHO (ProMED archive no. 20200725.7606707).\n\nOn 31 Jul 2020 a new plague outbreak was noted in the Logo Health Zone in the Kanga Health Area sharing a border with the Wala health area, in Jupanjaya village (N2.05394, E30.94094, 1985m asl [above sea level]). Rat falls have also been reported in several villages of the health area and in particular in Juparima village (N2.08094, E30.95742, 1977m asl) where _R. rattus_ have been dying in houses and peri-domestic bushes.\n\nSo far 4 human cases have been reported and confirmed microbiologically at the Logo General Reference Hospital (Wayson staining of bubo aspirate). The index case is a 23 month old female from Jupanjaya village. Since 30 Jul 2020, the child had had chills and fever. On 31 Jul 2020, the child's condition worsened with impaired breathing, high fever, which prompted her mother to seek treatment at the health center. At her admission, the child presented with fever at 38 deg C [100.4 deg F], and dyspnea. The nurse excluded malaria with a negative RDT [rapid diagnostic test] and confirmed the pneumonia which he treated with amoxicillin and paracetamol. Slight improvements were observed, that is, fever and dyspnea regressed, however in the morning of 1 Aug 2020, the presence of left axillary bubo was noted and the child condition relapsed. 3 more of bubonic plague cases have been reported: an 8 year old boy was reported on 2 Aug 2020 from Moo village (N2.06797 E30.97878, 1555m asl), 21 year old female on 11 Aug 2020 from Raa village (N2.07814 E30.92981, 2044m asl) and a 24 month female on 14 Aug 2020 from Kanga village (N2.07428 E30.95431, 1955m asl).\n\nGiven that this area has experienced pneumonic plague in recent years, the RECOs are leading an awareness campaign to broadcast preventive measures, and are actively searching for cases in the communities to refer them to the health centres.

The frequency of the rat falls is an early alert signal that plague may be circulating and there is an urgent need for communication and outreach campaigns throughout the whole plague endemic area. Given that this area has experienced pneumonic plague in recent years, the RECOs are leading an awareness campaign to broadcast preventive measures, and are actively searching for cases in the communities to refer them to the health centres. Rat falls have also been reported in several villages of the health area and in particular in Juparima village (N2.08094, E30.95742, 1977m asl) where _R. rattus_ have been dying in houses and peri-domestic bushes. 6 bubonic plague cases since 1 Aug 2020. 3 blood samples were taken on freshly dead rat carcasses and the rapid diagnostic tests performed on fresh rat carcasses were positive for plague.

Plague appears to be more prevalent this year (2020) in Mongolia. It is not clear that person-to-person spread has occurred.\n\nMost cases are due to bubonic plague following the bite of an infected rodent flea, causing a swollen and very tender lymph gland. The swollen gland is called a 'bubo'. Bubonic plague should be suspected when a person develops a swollen gland, fever, chills, headache, and extreme exhaustion, and has a history of possible exposure to infected rodents, rabbits, or fleas. A person usually becomes ill with bubonic plague 2-6 days after being bitten.\n\nWhen bubonic plague is left untreated, plague bacteria invade the bloodstream. As the plague bacteria multiply in the bloodstream, they spread rapidly throughout the body and cause a severe and often fatal condition. Infection of the lungs with the plague bacterium causes the pneumonic form of plague, a severe respiratory illness. The infected person may experience high fever, chills, cough, and breathing difficulty and may expel bloody sputum. If plague patients are not given specific antimicrobial therapy, the disease can progress rapidly to death. At this stage, person-to-person spread can occur, causing other cases of 'primary' plague pneumonia. A quarantine would be required with contact tracing and even prophylactic antimicrobials if the index case or cases actually had plague pneumonia.\n\nPlague is endemic in Mongolia. Marmots such as the Tarvaga, the Tarbagan or Mongolian marmot, _Marmota sibirica_, a large rodent related to the American woodchuck (_M. monax_), are thought to be significant zoonotic reservoirs for _Y. pestis_ in Eastern Asia. The name marmot comes from French marmotte, from Latin _mures monti_ 'mountain mouse'. - Mod.LL\n\nMaps of Mongolia: http://www.ezilon.com/maps/images/asia/political-map-of-Mongolia.gif and http://healthmap.org/promed/p/59547]", "summary": "A ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n \n\nMost cases are due to bubonic plague following the bite of an infected rodent flea, causing a swollen and very tender lymph gland.

The 1st case, a 12-year-old girl, reported to a local health center on 12 Jun 2020 experiencing a headache, fever, cough, and an enlarged lymph node. She died on the same day, and further deaths from the community due to suspected cases of plague were subsequently reported. From 11 Jun 2020 through 15 Jul 2020, 6 of 22 health areas have been affected within Rethy health zone (11 villages), with a total of 45 cases including 9 deaths (case fatality rate: 20%). All 9 cases who died presented with signs of headache, high fever, and painful nodes; 4 of the 9 cases had cough.\n\nThe health zone team carried out an investigation resulting in 5 positive rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs). Nine additional samples were taken and shipped to the National Institute for Biomedical Research [Institut National de Recherche Biomedicale (INRB)] laboratory in Kinshasa. Of the 45 cases reported, 2 showed signs of septicemic plague; all the other cases were diagnosed as having bubonic plague. According to the available information, it is likely that all 3 types of plague clinical presentation (bubonic, septicemic and pneumonic) are present.\n\nThe distribution by sex shows 58% (26/45) are male and 93% (42/45) are greater than 5 years old. Of the 45 cases reported, 9 including 4 who died, had cough among the symptoms -- a sign indicating a potential progression from bubonic plague to pulmonary plague. This was specifically noticed among the deceased.\n\nPlague is endemic in Ituri province. Since the beginning of 2020, Ituri Province has reported a total of 64 plague cases and 14 deaths (CFR: 21.8%) in 5 health zones, namely, Aungba, Linga, Rethy, Aru and Kambala health zones. This compares against 10 cases and 5 deaths (lethality, 50.0%) during the same period in 2019, all in a single zone.\n\nThe current COVID-19 epidemic affects 7 of 26 provinces in the country. Ituri has also reported cases of COVID-19 that may further interrupt response activities due to lockdown (as of 16 Jul 2020, there have been 8162 confirmed COVID-19 cases including 191 deaths in the DRC). These are in addition to longstanding public health response challenges identified in the region, including a lack of resources and insecurity. Although it has been reported that there is no significant impact of the COVID-19 context on activities taking place in this area, there is limited information available on the current access to health care. This includes whether there is a need for the population of Ituri to seek care in Uganda, as well as the availability of human resources, drugs, and personal protective equipment (PPE). Furthermore, the reference laboratory in Bunia, Ituri province is currently not functional, which might delay the confirmation of suspected cases and response efforts.\n\nPublic health response\n- A national rapid response team (RRT) has been deployed to the affected health zone to conduct an outbreak investigation and implement initial response activities.\n- UNICEF is on the ground responding to the humanitarian situation at Bunia, working on community engagement and safe and dignified burial practices.\n- The WHO guideline for plague, including case definitions, has been disseminated to health facilities to improve the detection of cases.\n- The WHO is supporting plague-endemic areas with surveillance, investigation of cases, and training of health workers and community relays in the prevention, early detection and case management of plague.\n- Doxycycline prophylaxis has been administrated to the listed contacts.\n- Intrahousehold spraying with deltamethrin has been used in some villages.\n- Safe and dignified burials (SDB) have been performed by the health district team.\n- Sensitization of the population on plague prevention measures in the affected villages through local radio.\n\nWHO risk assessment\nInfection with plague can cause severe disease resulting in high mortality in humans, particularly if not identified early. Plague can exhibit in 3 forms: bubonic, septicemic and pneumonic. If untreated, bubonic plague can evolve to pneumonic plague. Early diagnosis and treatment are essential for survival and reduction of complications.\n\nRethy health zone is endemic for plague and regularly registers cases of enzootic variants of _Yersinia pestis_ in much of the wild rodent population. Its 1st outbreak was reported in February 2020 with cases imported from Linga health zone, based in the Godjoka health area.\n\nOn the security level, there are reports of atrocities and violence linked to the militia CODECO, which continues to impact the population of this territory (Djugu and its surroundings). There have been mass population displacements within Djugu and Mahagi territories. Currently, the Rethy health zone has received approximately 112 714 internally displaced persons (IDPs), most of whom have come from the Jiba and Linga health zone. The growing insecurity impacts traffic flow between the villages and the willingness of the population to either stay or work in that area. There has also been a deterioration of water, hygiene and sanitation conditions in the reception areas and in the IDP sites.\n\nThe early detection and reporting of the current outbreak by healthcare workers demonstrate that a functioning surveillance system is in place. Ituri province had a reference laboratory in Bunia that is no longer functional. The INRB laboratory based in Kinshasa/DRC has the ability to conduct laboratory testing for suspected cases. However, delays in shipping samples from Rethy to Bunia and then to Kinshasa, and delays in testing in Kinshasa INRB due to high workload and backload related to COVID-19 samples to be tested, might jeopardize the surveillance and response. Ongoing efforts are required to ensure that any other cases are promptly detected, isolated, and investigated to avoid the establishment of local transmission.\n\nThe risk at the national level is considered to be moderate given the evolution of the current situation is in danger of deteriorating rapidly (case fatality rate: 20%), the notification of cases of pulmonary plague, the challenges with the surveillance system and delays between sample collection and laboratory confirmation, and the volatile security situation and the existence of other epidemics in progress in the country, which prevents the setting up of a more comprehensive response. Furthermore, the health zone currently does not have enough PPE, body bags and materials needed for decontamination. Malteser International, an NGO that supplies the health zone with drugs, has had difficulty getting the products into the zone because of insecurity on the RN27 road.\n\nThe principles of control are known and have been implemented (early treatment with the recommended antibiotics, isolation of the pneumonic cases, chemoprophylaxis given to the close contacts of the latest ones, rodent and flea control, safe and dignified burials, and the prevention of nosocomial transmission), but the means are limited and the health system is unable to manage the cases in the most appropriate way. The antibiotics used for the treatment of the cases are doxycycline, ciprofloxacin and cotrimoxazole. For the pulmonary or septicemic form case, gentamycin was administrated. The lack of laboratory confirmation is worrying, but the use of rapid diagnostic tests (RDT) in the field ensures a minimum of confirmation among the suspected cases. The RDTs are especially reliable to confirm bubonic plague suspected forms.\n\nThe risk at the regional level is considered low because the epidemic seems to be contained in the Rethy health zone and that it is an isolated region. The risk is considered low globally.\n\nWHO advice\nBubonic plague is the most common form of plague and is caused by the bite of an infected flea. The plague bacillus, _Y. pestis_, enters at the bite site and travels through the lymphatic system to the nearest lymph node, where it replicates. At advanced stages of the infection, the inflamed lymph nodes can turn into suppurating open sores. There is no interhuman transmission of bubonic plague.\n\nUntreated, bubonic plague can advance and spread to the lungs, which is the more severe type of plague called pneumonic plague, the most virulent form of plague. The incubation period can be as short as 24 hours. Any person with pneumonic plague may transmit the disease via droplets to other humans. Untreated pneumonic plague, if not diagnosed and treated early, is almost always fatal. However, the probability of recovery is high if detected and treated in time (within 24 hours of onset of symptoms).\n\nEarly diagnosis and treatment are essential for survival and reduction of complications. Appropriate diagnostic samples include blood cultures, lymph node aspirates if possible, and/or sputum, if indicated. Drug therapy should begin as soon as possible after the laboratory specimens are taken. Post-exposure prophylaxis is indicated in persons with known exposure to plague, such as close contact with a pneumonic plague patient or direct contact with infected body fluids or tissues. Duration of post-exposure prophylaxis to prevent plague is 7 days.\n\nPreventive measures include informing people when zoonotic plague is present in their environment and advising them to take precautions against flea bites and not to handle animal carcasses. People, especially health workers, should also avoid direct contact with infected tissues such as buboes, or close exposure to patients with pneumonic plague.\n\nRecommended response measures for all forms of plague:\n\n- Obtain specimens, which should be carefully collected using appropriate infection, prevention and control procedures and sent to labs for testing. Confirmation of plague requires lab testing. The best practice is to identify _Y. pestis_ from a sample of pus from a bubo, blood or sputum. A specific _Y. pestis_ antigen can be detected by different techniques.\n\n- Ensure correct treatment: Prompt treatment with the correct medications is critical to prevent complications. Verify that patients are being given appropriate antimicrobial treatment such as aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones, chloramphenicol, tetracyclines, sulfonamides and supportive therapy. The antibacterial treatment may need to be adjusted depending on a patient's age, medical history, underlying health conditions, or allergies. Duration of treatment is 10 to 14 days, or until 2 days after fever subsides.\n\n- Protect health workers: Inform and train them on infection prevention and control. Workers in direct contact with pneumonic plague patients must wear a full personal protective equipment and use standard precautions for respiratory diseases. Depending on the circumstances, they can also take a chemoprophylaxis with antibiotics such as doxycycline for the duration of 7 days or at least as long as they are exposed to infected patients. However, the chemoprophylaxis cannot replace the use of PPE and the individual physical precautions.\n\n- Isolate patients with pneumonic plague: Patients with confirmed or suspected pneumonic plague should be isolated so as not to infect others via air droplets. Provide masks for pneumonic patients.\n\n- Contact follow-up: Identify, inform and monitor close contacts of pneumonic plague patients and provide them with a 7-day chemoprophylaxis.\n\n- Ensure safe burial practices: Optimal infection prevention and control measures are to be observed during funeral and burial ceremonies. Funeral ceremonies in the houses of plague victims that may involve assembly of people should be discouraged.\n\n- To effectively and efficiently manage plague outbreaks it is crucial to have an informed and vigilant healthcare work force (and community) to quickly diagnose and manage patients with infection, to identify risk factors, to conduct ongoing surveillance, to control vectors and hosts, to confirm diagnosis with laboratory tests, and to communicate findings with appropriate authorities.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Marianne Hopp\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Most cases are due to bubonic plague following the bite of an infected rodent flea, causing a swollen and very tender lymph gland.

Post-exposure prophylaxis is indicated in persons with known exposure to plague, such as close contact with a pneumonic plague patient or direct contact with infected body fluids or tissues. \n\nRethy health zone is endemic for plague and regularly registers cases of enzootic variants of _Yersinia pestis_ in much of the wild rodent population. \n\n- To effectively and efficiently manage plague outbreaks it is crucial to have an informed and vigilant healthcare work force (and community) to quickly diagnose and manage patients with infection, to identify risk factors, to conduct ongoing surveillance, to control vectors and hosts, to confirm diagnosis with laboratory tests, and to communicate findings with appropriate authorities. From 11 Jun 2020 through 15 Jul 2020, 6 of 22 health areas have been affected within Rethy health zone (11 villages), with a total of 45 cases including 9 deaths (case fatality rate: 20%). promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Most cases are due to bubonic plague following the bite of an infected rodent flea, causing a swollen and very tender lymph gland. \n\nWhen bubonic plague is left untreated, plague bacteria invade the bloodstream.

The health zone of Rethy in Ituri Province, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, has seen an upsurge of plague cases since June 2020. The WHO guideline for plague, including case definitions, has been disseminated to health facilities to improve the detection of cases. Its 1st outbreak was reported in February 2020 with cases imported from Linga health zone, based in the Godjoka health area. Bubonic plague should be suspected when a person develops a swollen gland, fever, chills, headache, and extreme exhaustion, and has a history of possible exposure to infected rodents, rabbits, or fleas.

The bubonic plague is the commonest type.\n\nThe disease doesn't spread easily to other people, and nobody else was infected, health officials said. However, experts warned of an 'increase of reported plague activity' and cautioned people to avoid handling or feeding rodents and other wildlife. 'While we see most plague activity during the summer, the disease can be found in rodents year-round, and [it] sometimes spills over into other wildlife species as well as domestic cats and dogs,' Dr Jenifer House, Colorado's public health veterinarian, said in a statement.

Household pets like cats and dogs can also catch plague from infected wildlife, so the health department advised not allowing pets to roam or to hunt rodents, according to the outlet.\n\nEarlier this summer, a squirrel in Jefferson County tested positive for the bubonic plague, which killed more than 50 million people across Africa, Asia, and Europe in the Middle Ages and came to be known as 'black death'.\n\n[byline: Natalie O'Neill]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n['The typical sign of the most common form of human plague is a swollen and very tender lymph gland, accompanied by pain.

Of the 28 big cats researchers tested, 12 were infected or had been infected, according to the study published in Environmental Conservation.\n\n'This suggests that: (bubonic plague) may be present at higher levels in the GYE than previously assumed,' it said, also adding that plague may be a 'significant' cause of death for the animals.\n\nResearchers carried out the study over the course of 9 years, following the discovery of 2 dead cougars, a mother and her cub, in Wyoming, the Smithsonian Magazine said.\n\nThe deaths weren't in and of themselves surprising, lead researcher Mark Elbroch told Livescience.\n\nIt was the winter, and so starvation was the presumed culprit, but when the true cause of death was discovered, it 'was a shocker,' he told the outlet.\n\nResearchers said it's very unlikely the average person would ever catch plague from a mountain lion, but given that the disease is capable of animal-to-human transmission, they recommended warnings for some.\n\n'We would also emphasize that hunters and others handling pumas in this region should be made aware of the possibility of exposure,' the study said.\n\nCougar behavior makes them a poor means of transferring diseases to people, but as Elbroch's team points out, their high rate of infection means the Yellowstone ecosystem itself could be a hotbed of plague.\n\nA Boy Scout came down with plague in 2008 following a camping trip in Yellowstone National Park, the Jackson Hole News & Guide reported.\n\n'Plague is very much a part of the landscape in the western U.S., and wild animals are frequently exposed to it,' a USDA researcher Sarah Bevins told National Geographic.

It is caused by the bacterium _Yersinia pestis_, which is mainly spread by the bites of infectious fleas. The bacterium is not native to North America. When it was introduced, it became established in some rodent populations. Small rodents such as deer mice and grasshopper mice are suggested to act as the reservoirs. Larger species like squirrels, chipmunks and prairie dogs are considered to be more vulnerable to infection.\n\nCarnivores (like cougars) may be infected through fleabite or ingestion of infected rodents. Studies of black bears (another carnivore) in California found plague antibody prevalence from 15% to 36%.\n\nThe study referred to can be accessed at https://doi.org/10.1017/S0376892920000065. The abstract reads: 'We tested for plague (_Yersinia pestis_) in a puma population in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (GYE) over 9 years, overlapping a case when a boy in the area became infected with plague. Antibodies to _Y. pestis_ were detected in 8 of 17 (47%) pumas tested by complementenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and the organism itself was detected in 4 of 11 (36%) pumas tested after necropsy. Neither puma sex nor age was significantly associated with _Y. pestis_ exposure or mortality, although our sample size was small. The overall prevalence of exposure we recorded was similar to that found along the western slope of Colorado, which is adjacent to the Four Corners region, a known plague hotspot in the USA. This suggests that: (1) _Y. pestis_ may be present at higher levels in the GYE than previously assumed; (2) plague is a significant source of mortality for local pumas (6.6% of sub-adult and adult mortality); and (3) pumas may be a useful sentinel for potential risk of plague exposure to humans throughout the West.

The chief medical officer of the Rethy Health zone, the head nurse and the laboratory team from the Rethy General reference hospital investigated the outbreak site. The Godjoka village is located in the Linga health zone, Djugu territory, Ituri province, in the Congo DR (N 02.01'47.9'' and E030.44'56.6'', 1940m) in the plague endemic area.\n\nThere have been 6 suspected cases of plague, including 5 deaths and 1 recovering patient. The index case is a young boy who died on 19 Feb 2020. His mother, the neighbour and her child all died on 21 Feb 2020 and were buried the night of 24 Feb 2020, under pressure from the villagers. Finally, the traditional healer ['tradipraticien'] who took care of the mother (who was the 2nd case) died in turn on 25 Feb 2020, and samples were taken that same day. The rapid diagnostic test was positive for plague. Because of their rapidly fatal course, pneumonic plague is suspected for one or more of the 5 fatal cases.\n\nThe only survivor has been under treatment at the Godjoka Health center since 22 Feb; he is the 20-year-old brother of the index case. The test on the sputum of this patient was negative.\n\n--\nFrancoise Ngave Nyisi, Rethy General Reference Hospital, DR Congo\nMandro Michel, Provincial Division of Health, Bunia, DR Congo\nAdroba Pascal, Provincial Division of Health, Bunia, DR Congo\nLaudisoit Anne, Ecohealth Alliance, New York, USA\n<laudisoit@ecohealthalliance.org>\n\n\n\n[ProMED thanks Dr Laudisoit and her hardworking Congolese colleagues for this important report. Thus far the diagnosis of plague rests on the single positive diagnostic test obtained from the traditional healer, as it appears that the first 4 fatal cases were buried before diagnostic tests could be obtained. Following this logic, It is possible that the sole survivor thus far has the bubonic form of the disease, and thus a negative sputum result. We seek and hope to obtain further information on all of these cases, including age, nature, and duration of symptoms, presence or absence of buboes, etc.\n\nThis putative plague cluster is in a known historic plague-endemic region, where there were 31 cases and 8 deaths between Jan - Oct 2019, as previously reported by ProMED (Plague - Congo DR (02): (IT) fatal 20191016.6731137). The Ituri district, of course, has also been affected by the still smouldering North Kivu-Ituri Ebola outbreak that began in July 2018. This district has also been, and continues to be, a region of great civil unrest, with multiple armed insurgency groups operating near and across the Ugandan border.\n\nThe following background information on plague by Mod.LL is copied from our most recent ProMED post on plague [see below under See Also]:\n\n'The bacterium that causes plague is _Yersinia pestis_. Most cases of plague are due to bubonic plague following the bite of an infected rodent flea causing a swollen and very tender lymph gland. The swollen gland is called a 'bubo.' Bubonic plague should be suspected when a person develops a swollen gland, fever, chills, headache, and extreme exhaustion, and has a history of possible exposure to infected rodents, rabbits, or fleas. A person usually becomes ill with bubonic plague 2-6 days after being bitten. At this point in the illness, there is no risk of person-to-person spread, so if this was indeed a case of bubonic plague, no isolation or quarantine is necessary.\n\nWhen bubonic plague is left untreated, plague bacteria invade the bloodstream. As the plague bacteria multiply in the bloodstream, they spread rapidly throughout the body and cause a severe and often fatal condition. Infection of the lungs with the plague bacterium causes the pneumonic form of plague, a severe respiratory illness.

The illness manifests in multiple clinical forms, including bubonic and pneumonic plague. Pneumonic plague is rare, rapidly fatal, and transmissible from person to person via respiratory droplets. On 4 Mar 2019, a patient with suspected pneumonic plague was hospitalized in West Nile, Uganda, 4 days after caring for her sister, who had come to Uganda from DRC and died shortly thereafter, and 2 days after area officials received a message from a clinic in DRC warning of possible plague. The West Nile-based Uganda Virus Research Institute (UVRI) plague program, together with local health officials, commenced a multipronged response to suspected person-to-person transmission of pneumonic plague, including contact tracing, prophylaxis, and education. Plague was laboratory-confirmed, and no additional transmission occurred in Uganda. This event transpired in the context of heightened awareness of cross-border disease spread caused by ongoing Ebola virus disease transmission in DRC, approximately 400 km to the south. Building expertise in areas of plague endemicity can provide the rapid detection and effective response needed to mitigate epidemic spread and minimize mortality. Cross-border agreements can improve ability to respond effectively.\n\nInvestigation and Findings\n-----------------------\nThe index patient (patient A) was a Ugandan woman, aged 35 years, living in DRC, approximately 5 km from the Ugandan border. On 27 Feb 2019, Ugandan family members traveled to DRC for the funeral of patient A's child, aged 4 years, and found patient A severely ill. They transported her to her ancestral Ugandan village in Zombo District of West Nile. While there, she complained of chest pain, experienced at least one episode of hemoptysis, and was admitted to a nearby clinic around midday the following day, 28 Feb 2019. She died a few hours later; no clinical samples were collected. She was buried in her ancestral village, preparation for which began the day of her death and culminated 2 days later, on 2 Mar 2019 [Table, for table, see original URL. - Mod.LL].\n\nMeanwhile, on 1 Mar 2019, a local government office in Uganda received an alert from a private health clinic in DRC warning of possible plague circulation in a village near the border, the village from which patient A had come. Consequently, a team from UVRI's plague program, along with local health officials, initiated plague education and risk communication at area health clinics and with village residents, in concert with the burial of patient A. Reportedly, her husband in DRC died of an acute illness at approximately the same time, and others in patient A's family in DRC were ill, some with 'fever and swellings.'\n\nOn 3 Mar 2019, in Uganda, patient B, aged 23 years (the sister of patient A), developed fever. In a health care facility on the following day, she tested positive for malaria and lacked signs of pneumonia. She received intravenous artesunate for malaria, but in light of the suspicion for plague in the area, she was admitted and empirically started on gentamicin. Approximately 8 hours later, she coughed up blood-tinged sputum. Other patients were removed from the room, and droplet precautions were instituted.\n\nBlood from patient B tested negative for Ebola virus disease and other hemorrhagic fever viruses at UVRI using established methods (5). Sputum yielded the maximal positive reaction (4+) on a commercial rapid diagnostic test (RDT) (New Horizons Diagnostics) for detection of _Yersinia pestis_ fraction 1 (F1) antigen. Cultures of blood and sputum (obtained approximately 8 hours after initiation of antibiotic treatment) were negative. Subsequent testing of plasma and sputum by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) yielded evidence of _Y. pestis_ DNA. The patient was treated with gentamicin for 7 days and doxycycline for 4 days and was discharged on 14 Mar 2019. _Y. pestis_ infection was confirmed by seroconversion on a total immunoglobulin F1 antigen passive hemagglutination assay (acute titer = 0 [collected 4 Mar 2019]; convalescent titer = 1:2,048 [collected 18 Mar 2019]).\n\nPatient B did not travel to DRC for the burial of patient A's child and did not arrive in the ancestral village to care for her sister until the morning of 28 Feb 2019. Patient B cared for patient A that morning, including using her hand to clean around patient A's mouth, feeding her, transporting her to the clinic via motorbike, and attending to her at the clinic. She was not involved in transport of patient A's body back to the village or in burial preparations.\n\nPublic Health Response\n---------------------\nOn 5 Mar 2019, UVRI and district representatives rapidly mobilized and executed contact tracing and prophylaxis administration. In total, 129 persons were identified as contacts of patient A or B, including 8 (6%) clinic staff members; 127 were placed on a 5-day prophylactic course of doxycycline, co-trimoxazole, or ciprofloxacin. Most persons identified as contacts (80; 62%) reported physical contact with or exposure within one meter or less of either patient. 98 (76%) persons reported contact with patient A, including those involved in handling her body after her death. 53 traced contacts (41%) had high-risk exposure, as determined by subjective assessment of their distance from either patient and presumed patient infectiousness [Figure, for figure, see original URL. - Mod.LL].\n\nDuring a 10-day follow-up period, no identified contacts developed plague-like symptoms, and no indication of plague activity in Uganda was detected despite active clinic-, community-, and rodent-based surveillance for plague in the region. Comprehensive public health response was limited by jurisdiction; the UVRI team was unable to provide expertise and resources to support plague control just over the border in DRC. The fate of patient A's DRC-based family and community members, given the likely ongoing circulation of _Y. pestis_ among rodents and fleas in that village, is not known.\n\nDiscussion\n----------\nPlague persists in transmission cycles involving rodents and fleas on several continents, including Africa (1). Although plague generates fear because of its historical reputation, pneumonic plague transmission in modern times can be controlled by implementing droplet precautions, antimicrobial therapy, and prophylaxis of contacts (6,7). This report summarizes importation of plague from DRC into Uganda. Rapid and effective response curtailed epidemic spread of pneumonic plague beyond a single transmission event from patient A to patient B in Uganda.\n\nWorldwide, most plague occurs following the bite of an infected flea and results in bubonic plague, characterized by acute fever and a painful swollen lymph node (1,4). Untreated, infection can spread to the lungs (2). Pneumonic plague transmission occurs via respiratory droplets and requires close contact with severely ill persons (7). The highest-risk exposures are those within 2 meters of persons coughing blood-tinged sputum; transmission might also occur during body preparation in traditional burials (8). The typical incubation period for primary pneumonic plague is less than one day to 4 days, and the condition is often fatal if effective antibiotics are not initiated within 24-36 hours of illness onset (2).\n\nPatient B's exposure to patient A was limited to the morning hours of 28 Feb 2019 and was followed by patient B's illness onset approximately 72 hours later. Persons with high-risk exposures to patient A as identified upon contact tracing were 3-5 days postexposure when antibiotic prophylaxis was initiated on 5 Mar 2019. Because only patient B became ill, the secondary attack rate among all persons with high-risk exposures was 2%. Postexposure prophylaxis might have prevented illness among some of those who received it, particularly those exposed to patient B, who were all still within the incubation period. This outcome highlights that pneumonic plague is not as transmissible as is often believed; and spread typically occurs among persons with close and substantial, rather than incidental, contact with a patient with late-stage disease (7). Secondary transmission rates in outbreaks in Madagascar and Uganda have been estimated at approximately 8%; however, transmission also depends on cultural and behavioral factors that might place persons at increased risk above the inherent transmissibility of the organism (8,9). Engagement with community leaders, members, health workers, and traditional healers in areas where plague is endemic can improve early recognition and implementation of simple interventions to curtail epidemic spread (7,10).\n\nEven in areas with endemic plague, clinical diagnosis is challenging because of the nonspecific nature of the febrile illness in the absence of painful lymphadenopathy or blood-tinged sputum (3). RDT, real-time PCR, and paired serology testing were all positive for plague in patient B, despite collection of clinical specimens after initiation of effective antibiotic treatment, which did, however, hinder recovery of the organism in culture. RDT use occurred as part of ongoing research jointly conducted by CDC and UVRI to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of RDTs for plague on human clinical specimens. Validated RDTs used by trained personnel might have value in providing rapid information to guide public health response but should be supported by additional diagnostic tests. Even in the remote setting of northwestern Uganda, collection of multiple clinical samples and use of multiple tests allowed for confirmation of the etiology.\n\nCDC has worked with Uganda's Ministry of Health and UVRI since 2003 to provide technical support for clinic- and animal-based plague surveillance, laboratory capacity, and community education and to conduct multifaceted research into improved diagnostics and effectiveness of environmental plague prevention approaches. Despite initial cross-border notification of suspected plague in DRC, lack of an established local cross-border collaboration prevented the resources and plague expertise in Uganda from supporting mitigation of ongoing risk just over the porous geopolitical boundary. Cross-border collaboration can improve capability to effectively respond to public health threats that affect border regions.\n\nReferences\n---------\n1. Pollitzer R. Plague.

The latest case of the plague has again been recorded in Inner Mongolia, where the 3 previous cases have stemmed from. The local was a rural herder in the Siziwang county, who was diagnosed and subsequently treated in hospital. He is now said to be in a stable condition, although 4 others who came into contact with him have been quarantined.\n\nHealth authorities in China confirmed it is a case of the bubonic, rather than pneumonic, plague, which was known as the Black Death in the 14 century. Bubonic plague causes swelling of the lymph nodes. However, pneumonic plague infects the lungs, making the disease airborne and much easier to transfer.\n\nAnother 3 cases of the plague have been confirmed in China in November 2019, with 2 of them being pneumonic.\n\nPaul Hunter, professor of health protection at the University of East Anglia, told Express.co.uk: 'The worrying thing about the Chinese cases is that two are pneumonic plague. If you're bitten by a flea, typically you'll get bubonic plague where it is in the lymph nodes and they swell and then discharge. In pneumonic plague it goes to the lungs and then you start coughing it up. And the scary thing about pneumonic plague is that it is substantially more fatal untreated and has a much higher mortality rate. You can spread it person to person as you're coughing, the bacteria then drifts in the air and then people inhale it.'\n\n'Most cases of the plague these days are bubonic form and they don't really spread from person to person. But with the people in Beijing, they had the pneumonic form.' However, Prof Hunter added there is no need to panic.\n\nIn the 14th century the Black Death spread across the Mediterranean and Europe, killing up to 60 per cent of Europe's total population. More than 100 million people may have perished -- reducing the world population from an estimated 450 million down to 350-375 million.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the USA, the plague is treatable with antibacterials. CDC advises the earlier people seek treatment, the more likely it is they will make a full recovery. Those who come into close contact with plague victims may need preventative antibiotic therapy. In the 21st century, the plague is endemic to select regions of the planet. 3 other countries where the plague still circulates are the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Madagascar, and Peru. Isolated cases often also spring up in the USA, with up to a dozen people diagnosed annually.\n\n[byline: Sean Martin]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The bacterium that causes plague is _Yersinia pestis_. Most cases of plague are due to bubonic plague following the bite of an infected rodent flea causing a swollen and very tender lymph gland. The swollen gland is called a 'bubo'. Bubonic plague should be suspected when a person develops a swollen gland, fever, chills, headache, and extreme exhaustion, and has a history of possible exposure to infected rodents, rabbits, or fleas. A person usually becomes ill with bubonic plague 2 to 6 days after being bitten. At this point in the illness, there is no risk of person-to-person spread so if this was indeed a case of bubonic plague, no isolation or quarantine is necessary.\n\nWhen bubonic plague is left untreated, plague bacteria invade the bloodstream. As the plague bacteria multiply in the bloodstream, they spread rapidly throughout the body and cause a severe and often fatal condition. Infection of the lungs with the plague bacterium causes the pneumonic form of plague, a severe respiratory illness. The infected person may experience high fever, chills, cough, and breathing difficulty and may expel bloody sputum. If plague patients are not given specific antimicrobial therapy, the disease can progress rapidly to death. At this stage, as appears to have happened in this case, person-to-person spread can occur, causing other cases of 'primary' plague pneumonia. - Mod.LL\n\nHealthMap/ProMED-mail map of China: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/65262.]", "summary": "Most cases of plague are due to bubonic plague following the bite of an infected rodent flea causing a swollen and very tender lymph gland. \n\n'Most cases of the plague these days are bubonic form and they don't really spread from person to person. \n\nWhen bubonic plague is left untreated, plague bacteria invade the bloodstream.

Three days later on 14 Nov 2019, another case of _Y. pestis_ was identified in a patient from Huade County of Ulanchabu City in Inner Mongolia, 130 km from the 1st 2 cases. China CDC established no epidemiological relationship between the 2 events.\n\nA total of 447 persons with direct contact in Beijing and 46 in Inner Mongolia were quarantined for medical observation. As of 21 Nov 2019, all persons with direct contact were discharged from medical observation.\n\nInvestigation and Results\n----------------------\nPatient A. The index case (Patient A) was a 43-year-old male herdsman. On 25 Oct 2019, the day after working the soil on his farm, he had sudden onset of fever (40 C [104 F]), with chills, vomiting, chest pain, breathlessness, and cough with blood-tinged sputum. He reported no swollen lymph nodes. He sought treatment in a local county hospital, where he was admitted and stayed for 2 days. On 27 Oct 2019, his condition deteriorated, and he was transferred to League Central Hospital (LCH) by ambulance and was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) where he stayed for 7 days.\n\nPatient B. On 31 Oct 2019, while Patient A was in the ICU, his wife (Patient B, 46 years old), who had accompanied and cared for him, had onset of cough with a low-grade fever (38 C [100 F]). She was hospitalized in LCH. Over the next 24 hours, her condition worsened with increasing cough, blood-tinged sputum production, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Computerized tomography revealed pneumonia. Husband and wife were treated with antibiotics in the local hospital from 25 Oct to 2 Nov 2019 but did not show significant improvement. They were transferred by ambulance to a general hospital in Beijing on 3 Nov 2019 and were given moxifloxacin and cefoperazone sodium along with supportive treatment. There was no clinical improvement.\n\nOn 12 Nov 2019, blood and sputum specimens were tested by Beijing CDC and were found to be positive by RT-PCR and colloidal gold-immunochromatography assay targeting the F1 antigen and by reverse indirect hemagglutination assay (RIHA). Although _Y. pestis_ was not able to be isolated by culture, NGS sequencing was weakly positive for _Y. pestis_ genetic material. Beijing CDC and Inner Mongolia CDC immediately initiated a coordinated investigation, including evaluation of potential exposures to the patient and an environmental assessment to determine risk of further transmission. The Inner Mongolia Plateau is home to _Meriones unguiculatus_ (_M. unguiculatus_), a primary mammalian host of _Y. pestis_, with cases of intense wild rodent epizootic disease in 2019.\n\nPatient C. On 11 Nov 2019, Patient C (55-year-old male) sought treatment in a local hospital in Huade County for swollen lymph nodes and fever. Patient C had eaten a dead hare he found in the field. A clinician noted this exposure and suspected _Y. pestis_ infection. The Inner Mongolia CDC laboratory identified _Y. pestis_ by culture with the phage lysis test and with RT-PCR from lymph nodes aspirates. Blood cultures were negative for _Y. pestis_. On 13 Nov 2019, the patient was reported to Huade County CDC as having bubonic plague. An epidemiological investigation indicated no relation between Patients A/B and Patient C. However, Patient C lives in a county that is known to be a natural focus of _Y. pestis_.\n\nPublic Health Response\n-----------------------\nWhen epizootic plague is detected, local health-care providers and the public should be alerted to potential risks of plague. Educational efforts should promote personal protection measures, including: 1) educating the public to avoid direct contact with sick or dead animals (e.g., rodents and rabbits in Inner Mongolia); 2) wearing long pants and applying insect repellent on the skin, to clothing, and to outer bedding of anyone who engages in outdoor activities in an area that is an endemic focus for plague; 3) abstaining from handling or skinning wild or domestic animals that died of unknown reasons and using gloves when handling animals killed by trapping or hunting; 4) taking prophylactic antibiotics if risk of exposure is high; and 5) keeping pet dogs and cats in natural plague foci free from fleas and not allowing them to wander freely (1).\n\nIn response to the events reported above, key preventive measures have been implemented in Inner Mongolia. These include: 1) enhanced surveillance for plague in rodents and rodent predators in enzootic areas; 2) use of insecticides and rodenticides to eliminate wild rodent fleas and reservoirs; 3) strengthening of professional training and alerting doctors to the forms of plague; 4) strengthening of professional training for local CDC and clinical laboratory staff; 5) monitoring rodent die-offs and educating the public to report sightings of dead animals and reductions in animal colony size; and 6) considering plague in the differential diagnosis of ill domestic animals, including dogs and cats, in the natural plague foci areas.\n\nDiscussion\n--------\nPlague is an acute, often fulminating, infectious disease caused by _Y. pestis_. There are 3 main forms of plague, with the specific form depending upon route of infection: bubonic plague, septicemic plague, and pneumonic plague (1). Most human plague cases are of the bubonic form, which results from bites by infected fleas. However, plague can also be transmitted to humans by handling infected animals or by inhaling infectious aerosols from persons with pneumonic plague and from diseased or dead animals. The family of patients A and B lived in an independent house in a grassland, and investigators determined that the index patient most likely became infected while working the soil on his farm, an area where _M. unguiculatus_ serves as a primary plague host. 500 meters from the house of Patients A and B, a live _M. unguiculatus_ was trapped and found to be culture-positive for _Y. pestis_. A large rodent die-off was also observed in the area, raising the possibility that the decayed bodies in the dirt or in rat holes could have produced infectious aerosols. The wife (Patient B) most likely was infected from contact with her husband.\n\nPlague is primarily a rodent-hosted, transmitting disease. Animal to animal transmission is mediated by the bites of fleas that became infected by biting infected animals. Humans can be infected by the bites of bacterium-bearing fleas or by direct contact with wild or domestic animals that died from plague or are diseased with plague (marmots, foxes, lynxes and badgers, dogs (2), Tibetan sheep (3), and cats). Person-to-person transmission occurs only with pneumonic plague. Plague is categorized as a Class A infectious disease, the most serious category under China's Law on the Prevention and Treatment of Infectious Diseases (4).\n\nPlague in Inner Mongolia\n----------------------\nHuman plague has been well controlled since 1959 in Inner Mongolia. During 1960-2018, only 9 human plague cases with 2 deaths occurred in Inner Mongolia (5). The most recent human plague cases were reported from this focus in 2004, and as with Patient C, were due to skinning a dead hare (6).\n\nThere are 4 plague foci in Inner Mongolia (7). These are an _M. unguiculatus_ plague focus in the Inner Mongolian Plateau, a _Microtus brandti_ plague focus in the Xilin Gol Grassland, a _Spermophilus dauricus_ plague focus in the Song-Liao Plain and a _Marmota sibirica_ plague focus in the Hulun Buir Plateau (a silent plague focus). The _M. unguiculatus_ plague focus in Inner Mongolia can be divided into 2 parts: the Ordos plateaus and the desert steppe of the Ulanqab plateaus. The _S. dauricus_ focus includes the Song-Liao plain hills and the dry steppe of Qahar area (5).\n\nCombining previous plague epizootic data (5) and recent surveillance data, the Inner Mongolia animal plague epidemic can be divided into 4 phases, as illustrated in Table 1. The Inner Mongolia plateau focus of _M. unguiculatus_ was 1st identified in 1954. The total area of this focus is 134 803 square km and encompasses 22 counties (Qi) in the middle and western parts of Inner Mongolia (5). In the last 5 years, the Inner Mongolia natural foci of animal plague has been active. In 2019, virulent animal plague epidemics occurred in this focus, which has a high density of rats.\n\nSince the founding of the People's Republic of China, this is the 1st instance in which pneumonic plague was imported into a major city in China. Although clearly a transported case, awareness and appropriate measures should always be implemented. These 3 cases can provide important lessons for public health practitioners.\n\nReferences:\n[1] CDC. Plague. Atlanta, GA: US Department of Health and Human Services, CDC; 2019.

This infection was behind several pandemics including the Black Death of the late middle ages, which is estimated to have killed up to 60% of the European population.\n\nThe 2 new cases being treated at a hospital in Beijing are of the pneumonic form, which is even more serious than bubonic plague. According to the CDC, plague typically spreads to humans who have handled an infected animal or who have been bitten by a flea hosted by an infected animal. However, in the case of pneumonic plague, it can be spread when an infected person coughs. Pneumonic plague is highly contagious and is fatal if not treated quickly with [antimicrobials].\n\nThe WHO said it understood that close contacts were being screened and managed. 'The [Chinese] National Health Commission are implementing efforts to contain and treat the identified cases and increasing surveillance,' said Fabio Scano, of WHO China.\n\nIt is not the 1st time in recent history that China has dealt with cases of plague. In 2014 the city of Yumen was sealed off and 151 people were placed in quarantine after a man died from the disease.\n\nAccording to the CDC, plague -- largely of the bubonic form -- continues to crop up in rural areas of the USA, including northern Arizona, southern Colorado, and southern Oregon. In 2014 there were 16 cases and 4 deaths in the USA, including that of a man from Utah thought to have come into contact with an infected flea or dead animal.\n\nRecent epidemics have been reported in Africa, Asia, and South America, predominately in rural regions. The WHO reported 3248 cases and 584 deaths from plague worldwide between 2010 and 2015.\n\nIn 2017 Madagascar had an outbreak of plague, with 2348 cases and 202 deaths, of which 1791 cases were pneumonic plague.\n\nThis year, 2019, in Mongolia a couple died from plague apparently after eating raw marmot kidney, triggering a 6-day quarantine in the region.\n\n[Byline: Nicola Davis]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[2]\nDate: Tue 12 Nov 2019\nSource: Xinhua [edited]\nhttp://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2019-11/12/c_138549881.htm\n\n\nTwo people have been diagnosed with pneumonic plague in Beijing, local health authorities confirmed Tuesday [12 Nov 2019].\n\nAccording to the government website of Chaoyang District in Beijing, 2 patients from north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region were diagnosed with pneumonic plague, which doctors in Beijing confirmed Tuesday [12 Nov 2019].\n\nAt present, the 2 patients have received proper treatment in a relevant medical institution of Chaoyang District, and relevant disease prevention and control measures have been taken.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[3]\nDate: Wed 13 Nov 2019\nSource: Slate.com [edited]\nhttps://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/11/pneumonic-plague-black-death-china-sparks-fears-outbreak.html\n\n\nThe Chinese government announced Tuesday [12 Nov 2019] that 2 people in Beijing have been diagnosed with pneumonic plague, a deadly pandemic, once known as the Black Death, that killed tens of millions of people across Europe in the Middle Ages. The 2 patients were 1st treated in Inner Mongolia, a sparsely populated area in northern China, but after persistent respiratory problems and high fever, 2 symptoms of the plague, they were taken to a hospital in Beijing's Chaoyang District. A local news outlet said police quarantined the patients' room on Monday night [11 Nov 2019], but a now-deleted social media post by a doctor at the hospital indicated the pair 1st sought treatment as long back as 10 days ago [3 Nov 2019].\n\nThe timeline of the diagnosis is significant for multiple reasons in assessing the pandemic risk of the highly infectious illness, which can be transmitted by humans. First, although the pneumonic plague is universally fatal when left untreated, if diagnosed and treated with antibiotics within 24 hours of showing symptoms, the recovery rate is high, according to the World Health Organization. That would make the timing of the initial hospital visit and when the patients showed symptoms particularly important, as well as whom they may have come into contact with in the meantime.\n\n'On Tuesday [12 Nov 2019], Chinese censors instructed online news aggregators in China to 'block and control' online discussion related to news about the plague,' according to a directive seen and reported on by The New York Times. 'Skeptical Chinese internet users have charged the government with being slow to disclose news about the disease, which is transmitted between humans and kills even faster than the more-common bubonic form. China has a history of covering up and being slow to announce infectious outbreaks, prompting many people to call for transparency this time.'\n\n[Byline: Elliot Hannon]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The cases occurred in Inner Mongolia and were transferred to Beijing for therapy. Based on the 3rd post stating that the illness or illnesses began 10 days before and that without therapy plague pneumonia has a rapid progression to death, it is likely that the cases began with bubonic plague and spread to the lungs in at least one case.\n\nMost cases are due to bubonic plague following the bite of an infected rodent flea causing a swollen and very tender lymph gland. The swollen gland is called a 'bubo'. Bubonic plague should be suspected when a person develops a swollen gland, fever, chills, headache, and extreme exhaustion, and has a history of possible exposure to infected rodents, rabbits, or fleas. A person usually becomes ill with bubonic plague 2 to 6 days after being bitten.\n\nWhen bubonic plague is left untreated, plague bacteria invade the bloodstream. As the plague bacteria multiply in the bloodstream, they spread rapidly throughout the body and cause a severe and often fatal condition. Infection of the lungs with the plague bacterium causes the pneumonic form of plague, a severe respiratory illness. The infected person may experience high fever, chills, cough, and breathing difficulty and may expel bloody sputum. If plague patients are not given specific antimicrobial therapy, the disease can progress rapidly to death.

The 1st 3 cases of bubonic plague have just been recorded 50 km west of the capital. No deaths have occurred for the moment, but the Ministry of Health is watching. As every year, awareness campaigns have started. The goal: to prevent the spread of epidemics like that of 2017, the black year, which had more than 200 victims and 2400 people infected by the bacterium throughout the Malagasy territory.\n\n'Do not repeat the mistakes of the past' is the stated ambition of the Ministry of Health. Contacted by telephone, the Director General of Preventive Medicine, Dr. Fidiniaina Randriatsarafara, said that 'information and awareness activities have started. Radio clips are being broadcast on local radio stations to remind the public that the appearance of swelling, sudden fever, or chest pains require an immediate visit to the nearest health center. Clinics are sometimes several hours walking distance away, and patients more easily consult traditional healers.\n\nAt present, health centers in plague-endemic areas are all expected to be provided with drugs, since treatment exists to treat both forms of plague on the island. However, some clinics are still awaiting them, according to a ministry official.\n\nAnother important preventive measure is the requirement for road transport companies to register the name and telephone number of all passengers during the plague season. In 2017, it was a sick traveler who transmitted the pneumonic plague to other passengers, extending the epidemic to Tamatave. However, according to a regional carrier, many companies do not register passengers and are not sanctioned.\n\n--\nCommunicated by\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\nfrom\nProMED-FRA\n\n[Plague infections in Madagascar have been relatively quiet since the dramatic outbreak in 2017.\n\nThe following paragraph is from Chanteau S, Ratsifasoamanana L, Rasoamanana B, et al.

In the capital city of Antananarivo, more cases are being notified each year since 1990. Madagascar (pop. 13 million) has accounted for 45% of all the cases of plague in Africa.'\n\nFatalities related to plague usually are caused by spread of the organism from the bubo (the very painful infected lymph node that drains the area where the flea bite occurred) to the bloodstream. The bacteremia can cause a coagulopathy, producing the purpura seen in the 'black plague,' and also may spread to the lungs causing a hemorrhagic pneumonia. It is the pneumonia that can facilitate person-to-person transmission.\n\nMadagascar was the location of the isolation of multi-antimicrobial resistant _Yersinia pestis_ in 1995 (Galimand M, Guiyoule A, Gerbaud G, et al.

The strain was resistant to chloramphenicol, streptomycin, and tetracycline but sensitive to fluoroquinolones and trimethoprim as well as other aminoglycosides. This was an ominous observation; however, it is not clear whether this naturally occurring strain has persisted or spread. - Mod.LL\n\nHealthMap/ProMED map available at:\nAntananarivo, Analamanga, Madagascar: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/9420]", "summary": "A ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n \n\nAt present, health centers in plague-endemic areas are all expected to be provided with drugs, since treatment exists to treat both forms of plague on the island.

Plague can also be transmitted by direct contact with infected animals. Pet dogs and cats can become infected with plague when they eat an infected rodent or when they are bitten by an infected flea.\n\nNMDOH staff have gone door-to-door in the affected area to inform neighbors about plague and provided them with education to reduce their risks.\n\n'No matter where you call home in New Mexico, you can reduce the risk of plague by avoiding contact with rodents or their fleas, or outdoor pets by providing appropriate flea prevention for pets year-round,' said Secretary of Health Kathy Kunkel.\n\nSymptoms of plague in humans include sudden onset of a fever, chills, headache, and weakness usually within one to 7 days of becoming infected. There may be a painful swelling of the lymph node in the neck, armpit or groin areas, referred to as bubonic plague. The infection can also spread to the blood, causing septicemic plague, or to the lungs, causing pneumonic plague.\n\nWith prompt diagnosis and appropriate antibiotic treatment, the fatality rate in people and pets can be greatly reduced. Physicians who suspect plague should promptly report all cases to the New Mexico Department of Health.\n\nTo prevent plague, the Department of Health recommends that residents:\n\n- Avoid sick or dead rodents and rabbits, and their nests and burrows.\n- Clean up areas near the house where rodents could live, such as woodpiles, brush piles, junk and abandoned or un-used vehicles.\n- See a healthcare provider about any unexplained illness involving a sudden and severe fever. Inform your healthcare provider about any flea bites, contact with rodents, or burrows during the previous couple of weeks.\n- Wear protective clothing to prevent flea bites while working outside.\n- Provide safe and effective flea control for pets as recommended by a veterinarian.\n- Sick pets should be examined promptly by a veterinarian.\n\nThis is the 1st human plague case in New Mexico since 2017, a year where there was a total of 4 human cases. There has been one animal plague case in a dog in Quay County in 2019 (see Department of Health Reports Plague Case in Quay County).

Debate about whether septicemic plague is always secondary to frank or subclinical bubonic or pneumonic disease continues, but work in mice lends support to the existence of a syndrome of septicemic disease without histological changes in lymph nodes in a few animals infected by flea bites.'\n\nEarlier comment of Mod.TG (archive number 20190413.6421127):\n\n'Plague is primarily a disease of wild rodents. It is caused by the bacterium _Yersinia pestis_, which is mainly spread by the bites of infectious fleas. The bacterium is not native to North America. When it was introduced, it became established in some rodent populations. Surveillance efforts testing fleas are very important to detect circulation of _Y. pestis_ and risk of infection.\n\nPlague may infect human beings through several routes: 1) the bite of an infected flea carried by a rodent or, rarely, other animals (mentioned previously; 2) direct contact with contaminated tissues, generally from an animal; or 3) in rare cases, inhalation of respiratory secretions from infected people or animals.\n\nClinical signs in pets involve a localized swelling, such as under the jaw in cats, but also in the inguinal region or under the front leg (the armpit, if you will), lethargy, anorexia, and fever (or chills).

Bathing your pet in dishwashing soap is not sufficient to help your pet avoid diseases carried by fleas. Some of the over the counter flea preventions may be harmful to your pet, so please check with your veterinarian.

A plague rapid diagnostic test (RDT) was performed on the 3 other patients but only one was weakly positive, possibly due to antibiotic treatment.

The man died on 27 Apr [2019], and the woman died 3 days later, reports the Siberian Times.\n\nThe highly contagious bacterial disease is spread by fleas living on wild rodents. It has sparked fears of an outbreak, and urgent measures and precautions have been put in place to stop the infection spreading. Around 158 people have been put under intensive medical supervision after coming into contact directly or indirectly with the couple.\n\nThere were dramatic scenes when a flight from Bayan, Ulgii and Khovd in Mongolia -- the area where the couple fell ill -- was met by workers in white anti-contamination suits as [the plane] landed in the country's capital of Ulaanbaatar.\n\nEleven passengers from the west of the country were held at the airport and sent immediately for hospital checks. Others were examined in a special facility at the airport. Paramedics in anti-contamination boarded the flight as soon as it landed.\n\nSome frontier checkpoints with Russia are reported to have been closed, leading to foreign tourists being stranded in Mongolia.\n\nDr N. Tsogbadrakh, director of National Centre for Zoonotic Dermatology and Medicine, said, 'Despite the fact that eating marmots is banned, Citizen T hunted marmot. He ate the meat and gave it to his wife, and they died because the plague affected his stomach. Four children are orphaned.'\n\nBubonic plague is believed to be the cause of the Black Death that spread through Asia, Europe, and Africa in the 14th century, killing an estimated 50 million people.\n\nThe plague is a bacterial disease that is spread by fleas living on wild rodents such as marmots.

It is caused by the bacterium _Yersinia pestis_, which is mainly spread by the bites of infectious fleas. The bacterium is not native to North America. When it was introduced, it became established in some rodent populations. Surveillance efforts testing fleas are very important to detect circulation of _Y. pestis_ and risk of infection.\n\nPlague may infect human beings through several routes: 1) the bite of an infected flea carried by a rodent or, rarely, other animals mentioned previously; 2) direct contact with contaminated tissues, generally from an animal; or 3) in rare cases, inhalation of respiratory secretions from infected people or animals.\n\nClinical signs in pets involve a localized swelling, such as under the jaw in cats, but also in the inguinal region or under the front leg (the armpit, if you will), lethargy, anorexia, and fever (or chills). These clinical signs may be present in the dog as well as the cat. Swelling under the jaw in cats is frequently mistaken as a cat-fight abscess. Contact with the fluid from such an abscess carries a high risk of infection for the person contacting it.\n\nPlease take your pet to a veterinarian if you notice any abnormalities. Be sure to consult your veterinarian if you find a lump on your pet, as well as to get the best flea-prevention treatment for your pet, regardless of whether it is a cat, dog, or even a rabbit. It may be necessary to have your yard and/or home treated for fleas. Vacuum your home, including any bedding and furniture, and immediately upon finishing, take the vacuum bag outside, seal it in a plastic bag, and dispose of it. This type of cleaning will have to be repeated every week for 3-6 weeks to break the cycle of the flea in the home. This disease should be taken seriously, so please be sure your pet is on some form of flea-prevention year around.\n\nIf your pets are not on flea prevention, please ask your veterinarian about the best flea prevention. Bathing your pet in dishwashing soap is not sufficient to help your pet avoid diseases carried by fleas. Some of the over-the-counter flea preventions may be harmful to your pet, so please check with your veterinarian. It is also a good time to make sure your pet is current on a rabies shot.\n\nKeeping your pets inside is best, and being inside a yard will help diminish the ability to consume a dead animal and will further reduce the risk of plague to your animal and to yourself. - Mod.TG\n\nHealthMap/ProMED-mail map:\nQuay County, New Mexico, United States: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/11455]", "summary": "A ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n Plague may infect human beings through several routes: 1) the bite of an infected flea carried by a rodent or, rarely, other animals mentioned previously; 2) direct contact with contaminated tissues, generally from an animal; or 3) in rare cases, inhalation of respiratory secretions from infected people or animals. \n\nHumans can contract the plague through contact with tissues of infected animals and rarely through inhalation of coughed droplets from a sick pet. \n\nIf your pets are not on flea prevention, please ask your veterinarian about the best flea prevention.

The name marmot (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marmot) comes from French marmotte, from Latin _mures monti_ 'mountain mouse.'\n\nMaps of Mongolia: http://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/map/profile/mongolia.pdf and http://healthmap.org/promed/p/34282.

The Mongolian Ministry of Health confirmed 2 people -- a 38-year-old man and his pregnant wife, 37 -- died from plague after consuming raw meat and internal organs of a marmot. Bubonic plague should be suspected when a person develops a swollen gland, fever, chills, headache, and extreme exhaustion, and has a history of possible exposure to infected rodents, rabbits, or fleas.

At this stage, as appears to have happened in the report above, person-to-person spread can occur, causing other cases of 'primary' plague pneumonia. Infection of the lungs with the plague bacterium causes the pneumonic form of plague, a severe respiratory illness. Most cases are due to bubonic plague following the bite of an infected rodent flea causing a swollen and very tender lymph gland. \n\nSanitary and epidemiological services in Russia's Altai and Tuva republics, which neighbour the Bayan-Uglii province of Mongolia, are on high alert since news broke of the plague outbreak. \n\nThe Mongolian Ministry of Health stressed they did not think that the situation with the plague was critical or anywhere near epidemic. The tragic family that died from plague got infected after eating raw kidneys of a marmot. A person usually becomes ill with bubonic plague 2 to 6 days after being bitten. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20663260), it is far more likely that these bubonic plague cases were acquired via the bites of infected fleas. As the plague bacteria multiply in the bloodstream, they spread rapidly throughout the body and cause a severe and often fatal condition. \n\n'Did you think that the plague was something from the Dark Ages?", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "plague"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2037-03-25 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2011-03-25 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Afghanistan", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Kemerovo", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Tarbagan", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "FATAL", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Netherlands", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "http://healthmap.org/promed/p/34282", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Switzerland", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "US", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Yersinia", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Germany", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Russia", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Sweden", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "South Korea", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "6147679", "headline": "PRO/AH> Crayfish plague - Ireland: (WH) white-clawed crayfish", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=6147679", "date": "2018-11-15 12:17:42", "main_text": "CRAYFISH PLAGUE - IRELAND: (WESTMEATH) WHITE-CLAWED CRAYFISH\n************************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Wed 14 Nov 2018\nSource: Afloat [edited]\nhttps://afloat.ie/marine-environment/marine-wildlife/item/41091-water-users-called-on-to-help-limit-crayfish-plague-outbreak-in-athlone\n\n\nAll water users along the River Shannon are being urged to take precautions after confirmation of an outbreak of crayfish plague on a stretch of the Al River.

According to the general secretary of the Madagascar Ministry of Health, between 300 and 600 suspected cases are reported each year, with about 30 cases of pulmonary plague and 10 to 70 deaths.\n\nSince August 2018, Madagascar health officials have reported 105 human plague cases. Of these, 91 cases were identified as bubonic plague, while 14 were pneumonic plague. Of the bubonic plague cases reported to date, 19 people have died; 12 of the 14 pneumonic plague cases also perished.\n\nThe districts that include confirmed cases of plague are Manandriana, Tsiroanomandidy, Ambositra, Midongy Atsimo, Ambalavao, Befotaka, Ambatofinandrahana, Miarinarivo, Anjozorobe, Faratsiho, Fianarantsoa, Moramanga, Ankazobe, Arivonimamo, Betafo, and Mandoto.\n\nPlague is an infectious disease caused by the bacterium _Yersinia pestis_. It is found in animals throughout the world, most commonly rats but also other rodents like ground squirrels, prairie dogs, chipmunks, rabbits, and voles. Fleas typically serve as the vector of plague. Human cases have been linked to the domestic cats and dogs that bring infected fleas into the house.\n\nPeople can also get infected through direct contact with an infected animal, through inhalation, and, in the case of pneumonic plague, person to person. _Y. pestis_ [infection] is treatable with antimicrobials if started early enough.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\nvia\nProMED-EAFR\n<promed-eafr@promedmail.org>\n\n[Plague infections on Madagascar have been relatively quiet since the dramatic outbreak in 2017.\n\nThe following paragraph is from Chanteau S, Ratsifasoamanana L, Rasoamanana B, et al.

However since 1990, an annual 200 cases are being reported and bubonic plague takes on epidemic form, especially in the port of Mahajanga, each year. In the capital city of Antananarivo, more cases are also being notified each year since 1990. Madagascar (pop. 13 million) has accounted for 45% of all the cases of plague in Africa.'\n\nFatalities related to plague usually are caused by spread of the organism from the bubo (the very painful infected lymph node that drains the area where the flea bite occurred) to the bloodstream. The bacteremia can cause a coagulopathy, producing the purpura seen in the 'black plague', and also may spread to the lungs causing a hemorrhagic pneumonia. It is the pneumonia that can facilitate person-to-person transmission.\n\nMadagascar was the location of the isolation of multi-antimicrobial resistant _Yersinia pestis_ in 1995 (Galimand M, Guiyoule A, Gerbaud G, et al.

It is caused by the bacterium _Yersinia pestis_, which is mainly spread by the bites of infectious fleas. The bacterium is not native to North America. When it was introduced, it became established in some rodent populations. Surveillance efforts testing fleas are very important to detect circulation of _Y. pestis_ and risk of infection.\n\nPlague may infect human beings through several routes: 1) the bite of an infected flea carried by a rodent or, rarely, other animals (mentioned previously; 2) direct contact with contaminated tissues, generally from an animal; or 3) in rare cases, inhalation of respiratory secretions from infected people or animals.\n\nClinical signs in pets involve a localized swelling, such as under the jaw in cats, but also in the inguinal region or under the front leg (the armpit, if you will), lethargy, anorexia, and fever (or chills). These clinical signs may be present in the dog as well. Swelling under the jaw in cats is frequently mistaken as a cat-fight abscess.\n\nPlease take your pet to a veterinarian if you notice any abnormalities. Be sure to consult your veterinarian if you find a lump on your pet, as well as to get the best flea prevention treatment for your pet. It may be necessary to have your yard and/or home treated for fleas. Vacuum your home, including any bedding and furniture, and immediately upon finishing, take the vacuum bag outside, seal it in a plastic bag, and dispose of it. This type of cleaning will have to be repeated every week for 3-6 weeks to break the cycle of the flea in the home. This disease should be taken seriously, so please be sure your pet is on some form of flea prevention.\n\nIf your pets are not on flea prevention, please ask your veterinarian about the best flea prevention. Bathing your pet in dishwashing soap is not sufficient to help your pet avoid diseases carried by fleas. Some of the over the counter flea preventions may be harmful to your pet, so please check with your veterinarian. It is also a good time to make sure your pet is current on a rabies shot.\n\nKeeping your pets inside is best, and being inside a yard will help diminish the ability to consume a dead animal and further reduce the risk of plague to your animal and to yourself. - Mod.TG\n\nHealthMap/ProMED map available at:\nWyoming, United States: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/251]", "summary": "A ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n Plague may infect human beings through several routes: 1) the bite of an infected flea carried by a rodent or, rarely, other animals (mentioned previously; 2) direct contact with contaminated tissues, generally from an animal; or 3) in rare cases, inhalation of respiratory secretions from infected people or animals.

The bacteria behind anthrax and the pneumonic plague are 2 of the deadliest pathogens that could be used in warfare. Researchers from The Catholic University of America therefore created a single vaccine that could provide complete protection against the 2 diseases. Tests on animals showed the vaccine worked, even if they were infected with a deadly dose of either of the 2 killer pathogens.\n\n'This dual anthrax-plague vaccine is a strong candidate for stockpiling against a potential bioterror attack involving either one or both of these biothreat agents,' scientists led by Dr. Pan Tao said. The Washington DC-based team combined toxins from the bacteria _Bacillus anthracis_ and _Yersinia pestis_, which cause anthrax and the pneumonic plague, respectively. These toxins are known to stimulate an immune response when a person becomes infected.\n\nWhen given to mice, rats and rabbits, the vaccine gave complete protection against both diseases, even when the animals were infected with doses that are known to [be] deadly.

Both anthrax and plague can kill in as little as 3 days.\n\nThe most deadly form of anthrax is inhaled (pneumonic), which can quickly cause sufferers to cough up blood and even fall into coma. If spores enter a person's lymph nodes, they can multiply and produce deadly toxins that spread throughout the body. This can lead to life-threatening internal bleeding, as well as the death of tissues and [failure of] major organs. Although there is an FDA-approved anthrax vaccine, it can cause the airways to collapse and general circulation failure.\n\nThere is no approved vaccine for plague; however, an experimental one is sometimes used in the military. It is unclear what the potential side effects of the newly-developed dual vaccine may be. The pneumonic form of plague is the most dangerous, which can cause patients to cough up blood and suffer sudden cardiac arrest. The bacteria for both diseases are most often inhaled as infected droplets.\n\nAs well as protecting against a potential terror threat, the researchers believe the plague vaccine could be used globally.

Available in PDF at:\nhttps://mbio.asm.org/content/mbio/9/5/e01926-18.full.pdf\n\nAbstract\n--------\n_Bacillus anthracis_ and _Yersinia pestis_, the causative agents of anthrax and plague, respectively, are 2 of the deadliest pathogenic bacteria that have been used as biological warfare agents. Although Biothrax is a licensed vaccine against anthrax, no Food and Drug Administration-approved vaccine exists for plague. Here, we report the development of a dual anthrax-plague nanoparticle vaccine employing bacteriophage (phage) T4 as a platform. Using an in vitro assembly system, the 120- by 86-nm heads (capsids) of phage T4 were arrayed with anthrax and plague antigens fused to the small outer capsid protein Soc (9\u2009kDa). The antigens included the anthrax protective antigen (PA) (83\u2009kDa) and the mutated (mut) capsular antigen F1 and the low-calcium-response V antigen of the type 3 secretion system from _Y. pestis_ (F1mutV) (56\u2009kDa). These viral nanoparticles elicited robust anthrax- and plague-specific immune responses and provided complete protection against inhalational anthrax and/or pneumonic plague in 3 animal challenge models, namely, mice, rats, and rabbits. Protection was demonstrated even when the animals were simultaneously challenged with lethal doses of both anthrax lethal toxin and _Y. pestis_ CO92 bacteria. Unlike the traditional subunit vaccines, the phage T4 vaccine uses a highly stable nanoparticle scaffold, provides multivalency, requires no adjuvant, and elicits broad T-helper 1 and 2 immune responses that are essential for complete clearance of bacteria during infection. Therefore, phage T4 is a unique nanoparticle platform to formulate multivalent vaccines against high-risk pathogens for national preparedness against potential bioterror attacks and emerging infections.\n\nImportance\n----------\nFollowing the deadly anthrax attacks of 2001, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) determined that _Bacillus anthracis_ and _Yersinia pestis_ that cause anthrax and plague, respectively, are 2 Tier 1 select agents that pose the greatest threat to the national security of the United States. Both cause rapid death, in 3 to 6\u2009days, of exposed individuals. We engineered a virus nanoparticle vaccine using bacteriophage T4 by incorporating key antigens of both _B. anthracis_ and _Y. pestis_ into one formulation. Two doses of this vaccine provided complete protection against both inhalational anthrax and pneumonic plague in animal models. This dual anthrax-plague vaccine is a strong candidate for stockpiling against a potential bioterror attack involving either one or both of these biothreat agents. Further, our results establish the T4 nanoparticle as a novel platform to develop multivalent vaccines against pathogens of high public health significance.\n\nDiscussion, Comment\n-------------------\nIt is significant that the dual anthrax-plague vaccine, unlike the traditional subunit vaccines, elicited robust immune responses against both antigens in the absence of an adjuvant. In fact, addition of adjuvants such as Alhydrogel and/or liposomes to the nanoparticles did not enhance the immune responses (data not shown). We speculate that this might be because the viral nanoparticles, mimicking the PAMPs of a natural pathogen, engage with the TLRs and robustly stimulate the innate and adaptive immune systems of the host and do not need an external adjuvant (46) [see URL for references]. Consistent with this hypothesis, the T4 dual vaccine elicited both TH1- and TH2-mediated antibody responses against both antigens. This seems to be a signature characteristic of the phage T4 nanoparticle platform, one that is highly desirable for clearance of pathogenic organisms during natural infection. However, further studies are needed to understand the mechanisms.\n\nIn conclusion, our studies highlight some unique properties of the T4 phage nanoparticle that are distinct from the traditional subunit vaccines, which could facilitate formulation of multivalent vaccines against high-risk pathogens. Potentially, additional antigens from other biothreat agents and/or from emerging pathogens could be incorporated using the same principle, and these formulations can be customized to address different threats in different geographical regions of the world. Additional advantages of phage T4 platform include the following: highly stable structure, scalability, cost-effectiveness, safety, and lack of preexisting immunity in humans. Together, these factors could accelerate the streamlining of clinical trials, manufacture, and deployment at a much reduced cost, time, and effort. Phage T4, thus, is a good candidate to develop as a 'universal' platform for creating and stockpiling multivalent vaccines as part of our national preparedness against potential future biothreats and emerging infections. With some more refinement, this platform may have the most desirable target product profile for licensure.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[This apparently very successful vaccine worked for mice, rats, and rabbits. It is still a long way away from trials in humans. But from this account it may well be a winner. It is quick. It is effective. It is efficient. People ask me whether I have fears working with _Bacillus anthracis_. Frankly no because humans are hard to infect and antibiotics are effective.\n\nWhat does frighten me is exposure to _Yersinia pestis_ as we have no effective vaccine: the French have a vaccine which they use but I can see delays if it were needed in a hurry. It is a horrible death and it is not called the 'Black Death' for nothing. So while this joint vaccine may be promulgated as a defence in case of a biowarfare attack, which is not every day events, split into its components they have a place for protection for those exposed to these pathogens occupationally. The reservoir for _Y. pestis_ is field rodents in Arizona. Anthrax is increasingly sporadic in cattle but it has its favorite spots, but otherwise we see it in deer in west Texas, in Wood Bison, and in northern cattle. The 'Hot Shot' men burning those infected bison carcasses, which average around 2500 lbs each, deserve some immunity protection. And from this account of this experimental dual vaccine, 2 shots are enough. A significant improvement over the present human anthrax vaccine. - Mod.MHJ]\n\n.................................................mhj/ao/jh", "summary": "A ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n[1]\n \n\n'This dual anthrax-plague vaccine is a strong candidate for stockpiling against a potential bioterror attack involving either one or both of these biothreat agents,' the researchers noted in the study. \n\n'This dual anthrax-plague vaccine is a strong candidate for stockpiling against a potential bioterror attack involving either one or both of these biothreat agents,' scientists led by Dr. Pan Tao said.

The outbreak was notable not only for the large number of cases but also for the high percentage of cases of pneumonic plague in urban settings and in areas where the infection generally does not occur.\n\nThe following paragraph is from Chanteau S, Ratsifasoamanana L, Rasoamanana B, et al. Plague, a reemerging disease in Madagascar.

However since 1990, an annual 200 cases are being reported and bubonic plague takes on epidemic form, especially in the port of Mahajanga, each year. In the capital city of Antananarivo, more cases are also being notified each year since 1990. Madagascar (pop. 13 million) has accounted for 45 per cent of all the cases of plague in Africa.'\n\nFatalities related to plague usually are caused by spread of the organism from the bubo (the very painful infected lymph node which drains the area where the flea bite occurred) to the bloodstream. The bacteremia can cause a coagulopathy, producing the purpura seen in the 'black plague' and also spread to the lungs causing a hemorrhagic pneumonia. It is the pneumonia that can facilitate person-to-person transmission.\n\nMadagascar was the location of the isolation of multi-antimicrobial resistant _Yersinia pestis_ in 1995 (Galimand M, Guiyoule A, Gerbaud G, et al.

It is caused by the bacterium _Yersinia pestis_, which is mainly spread by the bites of infectious fleas. The bacterium is not native to North America. When it was introduced, it became established in some rodent populations. Surveillance efforts testing fleas are very important to detect circulation of _Y. pestis_ and risk of infection.\n\nPlague may infect human beings through several routes: 1) the bite of an infected flea carried by a rodent or, rarely, other animals (mentioned previously; 2) direct contact with contaminated tissues, generally from an animal; or 3) in rare cases, inhalation of respiratory secretions from infected people or animals.\n\nClinical signs in pets involve a localized swelling, such as under the jaw in cats, but also in the inguinal region or under the front leg (the armpit, if you will), lethargy, anorexia, and fever. These clinical signs may be present in the dog as well. Swelling under the jaw in cats is frequently mistaken as a cat fight abscess.\n\nPlease take your pet to a veterinarian if you notice any abnormalities. Be sure to consult your veterinarian if you find a lump on your pet, as well as to get the best flea prevention treatment for your pet. It may be necessary to have your yard and/or home treated for fleas. Vacuum your home, including any bedding and furniture, and immediately upon finishing take the vacuum back outside, seal it in a plastic bag, and dispose of it. This type of cleaning will have to be repeated every week for 3-6 weeks to break the cycle of the flea in the home. This disease should be taken seriously, so please be sure your pet is on some form of flea prevention.\n\nIf your pets are not on flea prevention, please ask your veterinarian about the best flea prevention. Bathing your pet in dishwashing soap is not sufficient to help your pet avoid diseases carried by fleas. Some of the over the counter flea preventions may be harmful to your pet so please check with your veterinarian. It is also a good time to make sure your pet is current on a rabies shot.\n\nKeeping your pets inside is best and inside a yard will help diminish the ability to consume a dead animal and further reduce the risk of plague to your animal and to yourself. - Mod.TG\n\nHealthMap/ProMED map available at:\nWyoming, United States: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/251]", "summary": "A ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n The department recommends using insect repellent on boots and pants in areas possibly having fleas; using flea repellent on pets; properly disposing of rodents brought home by pets; avoid exposure and contact to rodents dead or alive; and avoid areas with 'unexplained rodent die-offs.'

Most cases are due to bubonic plague following the bite of an infected rodent flea, causing a swollen and very tender lymph gland. The swollen gland is called a 'bubo.' Bubonic plague should be suspected when a person develops a swollen gland, fever, chills, headache, and extreme exhaustion and has a history of possible exposure to infected rodents, rabbits, or fleas. A person usually becomes ill with bubonic plague 2-6 days after being bitten.\n\nWhen bubonic plague is left untreated, plague bacteria invade the bloodstream. As the plague bacteria multiply in the bloodstream, they spread rapidly throughout the body and cause a severe and often fatal condition. Infection of the lungs with the plague bacterium causes the pneumonic form of plague, a severe respiratory illness. The infected person may experience high fever, chills, cough, and breathing difficulty and may expel bloody sputum. If plague patients are not given specific antimicrobial therapy, the disease can progress rapidly to death. Only if spread to the lungs occurs can the infection spread from person to person. However, if one acquires the infection by the respiratory route, this pneumonia is infectious as well. - Mod.LL\n\nHealthMap/ProMED-mail map:\nLambayeque, Peru: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/53696\n]", "summary": "A ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n[1]\n Moreno also indicated that surveillance and vector-control actions are continuing in different parts of the region in order to prevent the spread of the _Yersinia pestis_ bacteria, which causes bubonic plague, a disease usually transmitted by the bite of fleas from sick rodents. \n\nDafne Moreno said that, for 20 years, no deaths from this disease were reported in this region following the outbreak of plague occurring in several areas of Morrope; several people died in that outbreak.

There may be a swelling in the lymph nodes under the jaw of pets. Prompt diagnosis and appropriate antibiotic treatment can greatly reduce the risk of death in people and pets.\n\nPlague was identified in 2015 and 2016 in ground squirrels in both Elmore and south Ada counties.

The Jiuquan government also imposed quarantine measures at Subei People's Hospital and at the patient's residence in Subei to prevent the spread of the disease, the statement said. The National Health and Family Planning Commission, China's top health authority, and the Gansu commission sent experts to Subei to guide disease control and prevention, the statement said.\n\nPlague, a virulent microbe that can be transmitted to humans from wild animals, is classed as a Category A infectious disease -- meaning extremely dangerous -- under Chinese law. The only other disease falling into the category is cholera. The law requires that authorities adopt strict measures for control and prevention, including immediately reporting suspected cases, keeping infected people under quarantine during treatment and sterilizing the bodies of the deceased and cremating them.\n\nOnly one plague case was reported on the Chinese mainland in 2016 and the person didn't die, according to the national health commission. No cases were reported on the mainland between January and June 2017.\n\nTuesday's case was the 1st reported in Gansu since 2014, according to the provincial health commission. Three cases were reported in the province that year [2014], and all 3 people died. In July 2017, Gansu became the 1st provincial region in China to adopt strict measures for the control and prevention of plague. Governments at the county level and higher that are in, or near, places prone to the disease were asked to establish institutions to prevent and control the disease.\n\nResidents were advised to avoid contact with sick animals that might be infected with the disease -- marmots, for example -- and told not to eat them.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Most plague cases are due to the bubonic form following the bite of an infected rodent flea causing a swollen and very tender lymph gland. The swollen gland is called a 'bubo.' Bubonic plague should be suspected when a person develops a swollen gland, fever, chills, headache, and extreme exhaustion, and has a history of possible exposure to infected rodents, rabbits, or fleas. A person usually becomes ill with bubonic plague 2 to 6 days after being bitten.\n\nWhen bubonic plague is left untreated, the _Yersinia pestis_ organism can invade the bloodstream. As the plague bacteria multiply in the bloodstream, they spread rapidly throughout the body and cause a severe and often fatal condition 'septicemic plague'. Infection of the lungs with the plague bacterium causes the pneumonic form of plague, a severe respiratory illness. The infected person may experience high fever, chills, cough, and breathing difficulty and may expel bloody sputum. If plague patients are not given specific antibiotic therapy, the disease can progress rapidly to death. At this stage, as appears to have happened in this case, person-to-person spread can occur, causing cases of 'primary' plague pneumonia.\n\nThe marmot is the most common reservoir for _Yersinia pestis_ in eastern Asia. The etymology of the term 'marmot' is uncertain (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marmot). It may have arisen from the Gallo-Romance prefix marm-, meaning to mumble or murmur (an example of onomatopoeia).

The CSU Veterinary Teaching Hospital notified faculty, staff, and students on Monday [11 Dec 2017].\n\nLocal media reports that this was the 7th case of plague in a domestic animal in Colorado this year [2017].\n\nOfficials say they have taken all of the steps to directly notify anyone who may have been exposed to the bacteria, either directly at the hospital or who had animals that were also patients at the time the infected dog was hospitalized.\n\nFor those who were in contact with the infected dog, early detection of infections with this bacteria are very treatable with an antibiotic. Those who are at risk have been provided with information about how to monitor for symptoms.\n\nA limited number of people were exposed, but as a precaution, anyone with concerns about exposure should consult with their medical care provider. If you have not received a direct contact from the Veterinary Teaching Hospital VT(H), you or your pet were not identified as being at risk for potential exposure.\n\nThis was a complex case because some of the dog's symptoms were atypical for plague. As soon as tests confirmed late Friday [8 Dec 2017] that the dog was infected with the bacteria that causes plague, the hospital took immediate steps to notify people who may have been exposed. Those steps were:\n\n- We immediately identified and directly notified students, staff and faculty who were potentially exposed to the dog. We provided specific information about the case and proactive next steps these individuals should take.\n- We immediately identified and then directly notified the owners of 59 animals (48 dogs, 10 cats and a rabbit) at the hospital that were potentially exposed via sharing space with the infected dog. We provided information about proactive next steps and best practices, which include giving these pets an antibiotic, and are providing that medication for free to these clients.\n- We cleaned and disinfected the treatment areas where the dog was receiving care, following best practices recommended by experts at CSU and the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment.\n- We notified the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, Larimer County Department of Public Health, and other regulatory agencies, and began collaborating on a response, following public health best practices and recommendations.\n- Before the test confirmed the infection, the dog had been placed on a drug that would treat this infection, and would greatly reduce exposure to others after the 1st 48 hours. After the infection was confirmed, veterinarians began treating all other pets who had been in close proximity to the infected dog that were at the VTH.\n\nFacts about _Yersinia pestis_ and plague:\n- This bacterium is commonly found in rodents in Colorado, including the Fort Collins area.\n- Plague is an extremely rare diagnosis in a dog.\n- The timeframe for showing symptoms of illness after exposure are up to 7 days but can occur in a much shorter time frame, such as 2-3 days.\n- The bacteria most commonly spread via a bite from an infected flea. Less commonly, they can spread through direct contact with body fluids or tissue from an infected person or animal, or by breathing in infected droplets from the cough of an infected person, generally limited to those with close contact.\n- Plague is most common in the area during the warm months of May to September. Freezing temperatures often greatly diminish the spread.\n- Public health officials have advised that the chance of infection is limited to those with direct contact with the infected animal. They recommend as a precaution that all of those potentially exposed consult with their medical care provider to discuss monitoring for fever and other signs of infection, and potential prophylactic antibiotic treatment.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Plague may infect human beings through several routes: 1) the bite of an infected flea carried by a rodent or, rarely, other animals (mentioned previously; 2) direct contact with contaminated tissues, generally from an animal; or 3) in rare cases, inhalation of respiratory secretions from infected people or animals.\n\nClinical signs in pets involve a localized swelling, such as under the jaw in cats, but also in the inguinal region or under the front leg (the armpit, if you will), lethargy, anorexia, and fever. These clinical signs may be present in the dog as well. Swelling under the jaw in cats is frequently mistaken as a cat fight abscess. Please take your pet to a veterinarian if you notice any abnormalities. Be sure to consult your veterinarian if you find a lump on your pet, as well as to get the best flea prevention treatment for your pet. It may be necessary to have your yard and/or home treated for fleas. Vacuum your home, including any bedding and furniture, and immediately upon finishing take the vacuum back outside, seal it in a plastic bag, and dispose of it.

However, because plague is endemic in Madagascar and the plague season lasts from September to April, more cases of bubonic and sporadic pneumonic plague are expected to be reported until April 2018. WHO and other stakeholders will continue to support the Ministry of Health of Madagascar to maintain vigilance and to sustain a strong alert and response system to rapidly detect and respond to new plague cases as they emerge.\n\nFrom [Mon 20 to Sun 26 Nov 2017], 72 cases of plague (one confirmed, 6 probable and 65 suspect) were reported to WHO. The date of onset of the last confirmed bubonic case was [Sat 18 Nov 2017] and the date of onset of the last case of secondary pneumonic plague (primary bubonic form) was [Sun 19 Nov 2017].\n\nFrom [Tue 1 Aug to Sun 26 Nov 2017], a cumulative total of 2417 confirmed, probable and suspected cases of plague, including 209 deaths (case fatality rate 9 percent), have been reported from 57 of 114 (50 percent) districts in Madagascar. Analamanga Region in central Madagascar has been the most affected, with 68 percent of all recorded cases. Since the beginning of this outbreak, the vast majority of cases have been treated and have recovered. As of [Sun 26 Nov 201], only 13 people were hospitalized for plague. There has been no international spread outside the country.\n\nThe majority of the reported cases (1854, 77 percent) have been clinically classified as pneumonic plague, 355 have been classified as bubonic plague (15 percent), one was septicemic, and 207 have not yet been classified (further classification of cases is in process). Up to 81 healthcare workers have had illness compatible with plague, none of whom have died.\n\nOf the 1854 clinical pneumonic cases, 390 (21 percent) have been confirmed, 618 (33 percent) are probable and 846 (46 percent) remain suspected (additional laboratory results are in process). Up to 33 isolates of _Yersinia pestis_ have been cultured and are sensitive to all antimicrobials recommended by the National Plague Control Program.\n\nA total of 7318 contacts identified during this outbreak have been put under a course of prophylactic antibiotics, including 11 contacts who developed symptoms compatible with plague and were classified as suspect cases. On [Sun 26 Nov 2017], 24 of 29 (83 percent) contacts were followed.\n\nPlague is endemic on the Plateaux of Madagascar, including Ankazobe District, where the current outbreak originated. A seasonal upsurge, predominantly of the bubonic form, usually occurs yearly between September and April. This year [2017], the plague season began earlier than usual. The current outbreak is predominantly pneumonic and is affecting both endemic and non-endemic areas, including major urban centres such as Antananarivo (the capital city) and Toamasina (a port city).\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[There is a continued downward trend in cases.

The department collected blood in September [2017] from 2 bears killed under depredation permits, and the samples tested positive for antibodies to _Yersinia pestis_, the bacterium that causes plague.\n\nThe California Department of Fish and Wildlife issued the depredation permits. Tanya Espinosa, spokesperson for U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, said she could not reveal the location the bears were found because they were not on public lands.\n\nThey were removed by Animal and Plant Health Inspection Services because they were damaging private lands and an agricultural resource, Espinosa said.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture Wildlife Services routinely submits blood samples from bears and other predators it encounters in wildlife management activities. This is, in part, to determine whether they have been exposed to plague in the past.\n\nPlague is a flea-borne disease spread through contact with infected animals, dead or alive, and flea bites. In the 1300s, it killed millions in Europe, and took on the name of the Black Death. Symptoms include fever, nausea, headaches, weakness and swollen, tender lymph nodes. If caught early, it's treatable in the modern age with antibiotics.\n\nPredators like bears often prey on rodents, which are the primary carriers of plague, according to the state Public Health Department. When bears scavenge a plague-infected rodent, they are exposed to plague bacteria and develop antibodies. These bears were infected with the bacterium that causes plague, but unlike humans, bears do not become ill from plague infection, according to the state.\n\nThe public health department can get an indication of plague activity in a geographic area by testing bear blood samples and finding plague antibodies. Positive samples help identify areas where the state department or local agencies can focus rodent surveillance activities to determine the risk to humans and if there is increased plague activity.\n\nPlague routinely occurs in the Sierra Nevada, where the state public health department suspects the bears were most likely exposed, in the mountains east of Paradise. It's hard to pin down exactly where the plague exposure occurred because bears have large home ranges, according to the department.\n\nHistorically, about 12 percent of bear samples have tested positive for plague antibodies, according to California Department of Public Health. Positive bear samples have been found in 32 counties in California.\n\n[Byline: Ashiah Scharaga]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Plague is primarily a disease of wild rodents. It is caused by the bacterium _Yersinia pestis_ which is mainly spread by the bites of infectious fleas. The bacterium is not native to North America. When it was introduced, it became established in some rodent populations. Small rodents such as deer mice and grasshopper mice are suggested to act as the reservoirs. Larger species like squirrels and chipmunks are considered to be more vulnerable to infection.\n\nThe pathogen occurs in California most commonly in chipmunks, ground squirrels, and other rodents, where infection can be subclinical or contribute to mass die-offs. Carnivores (like bears) may be infected through fleabite or ingestion of infected rodents.

Moreover, every school, private and public, has a device, like an isolation room, and can monitor the health of each pupil, under the control of the state, making it possible to detect a probable case of plague at school level.\n\nThis is the latest new case notified to Antananarivo-city, after a few days of silence about the plague epidemic. A total of 12 patients are being treated in hospitals of the Big Island; 6 of them are in Antananarivo, 3 in the Upper Matsiatra region, 1 in the Bongolava region and 1 in Itasy. A notable fact of this latest plague situation is, also, the existence of a patient in the region of Atsimo-Andrefana.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n[Atsimo-Andrefana region is in south eastern Madagascar, not in the endemic areas for plague. - Mod.LL\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/181.]", "summary": "Sep 2017 / 73 / 17 / 3\n3 Oct 2017 / 194 / 30 / 40\n5 Oct 2017 / 258 / 36 / 32\n7 Oct 2017 / 343 / 42 / 43\n8 Oct 2017 / 387 / 45 / 44\n9 Oct 2017 / 449 / 48 / 62\n10 Oct 2017 / 500 / 54 / 51\n11 Oct 2017 / 561 / 57 / 61\n13 Oct 2017 / 684 / 57 / 61\n16 Oct 2017 / 805 / 74 / 40\n17 Oct 2017 / 878 / 80 / 44\n18 Oct 2017 / 1032 / 89 / 164\n19 Oct 2017 / 1153 / 94 / 121\n20 Oct 2017 / 1297 / 102 / --\n 23 Oct 2017 / 1192 / 124 / 10\n25 Oct 2017 / 1309 / 93 / 58\n27 Oct 2017 / 1554 / 113 / 122\n30 Oct 2017 / 1801 / 127 / 82\n1 Nov 2017 / 1836 / 133 / 17\n3 Nov 2017 / 1947 / 143 / 55\n10 Nov 2017 / 2119 / 171 / 25\n13 Nov 2017 / 2158 / 174 / 13\n17 Nov 2017 / 2267 / 195 / 27\n- Mod.

Many of the district's current affected have no experience of the disease, which represents another challenge in addition to the difficulties in controlling the epidemic in urban areas.\n\nThe total number of cases (2158) is already 5 times higher than the average annual total of 400 (September to April). However, there is a clear decrease in plague cases, from 502 cases during epidemiological week 40 (2-8 Oct 2017) to 70 cases during week 45 (6-12 Nov 2017).\n\nThe spread of pneumonic plague in high-density urban areas is faster, with a risk of large-scale epidemics, while the implementation of health and non-health responses is confronted with access problems (difficulty in tracing contacts, especially in slums) and the frequent moving of people. The capital city of Antananarivo, the country's trade and transport hub, is most affected by this epidemic.\n\nPneumonic plague due to person-to-person transmission by air poses a high health risk for all actors involved in the response, including health service providers in hospitals and health centers, social workers, health workers security and defense forces, journalists, hygienists, communicators, volunteers, etc. Since the beginning of the epidemic, 82 health personnel have been infected (with no deaths).\n\nThe epidemic has had consequences for tourism with the cancellation of cruises, but the situation is being addressed with the direct involvement of the World Tourism Organization. School has been suspended for one month.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n[There is a continued downward trend in cases.

There were 1791 cases of pneumonic plague, of which 22 percent were confirmed, 34 percent were probable, and 44 percent were suspected. In addition to pneumonic cases, there were reports of 341 cases of bubonic plague, one case of septicemic plague and 215 cases with type unspecified. In total, 81 healthcare workers have had illness compatible with plague, none of whom have died.\n\nSince the beginning of the outbreak, cases of pneumonic and bubonic plague have been detected in 55 out of 114 districts (48 percent), including non-endemic areas and major cities. Analamanga region has been the most affected, with 68 percent of the cumulative reported cases. All contacts identified (7289) during this outbreak have completed their course of prophylactic antis. 11 contacts developed symptoms compatible with plague and were classified as suspect cases. All contacts had completed their follow up.\n\nThe Institut Pasteur Madagascar has cultured 33 isolates of _Yersinia pestis_, which were all sensitive to the antimicrobials recommended by the National Program for the Control of Plague.\n\nPlague is endemic in some areas of Madagascar and additional cases of plague may occur, at least until the end of the plague season in April 2018. It is therefore important that control measures continue through the end of the plague season.\n\nPublic health response\n----------------------\nThe Ministry of Public Health of Madagascar is coordinating the response, with the support of WHO, the Institute Pasteur Madagascar, and other agencies, stakeholders, and partners. The Ministry of Public Health of Madagascar activated crisis units in Antananarivo and Toamasina to coordinate the outbreak response efforts. All cases and contacts have been provided treatment or prophylactic antimicrobials at no cost to themselves.\n\nThe public health response measures have included:\n- strengthened epidemiological surveillance in the all affected districts, and enhanced case finding;\n- rapid investigation of new cases;\n- sample collection, referral, and testing;\n- isolation and treatment of all pneumonic cases, as well as treatment of bubonic cases;\n- active finding, tracing, and monitoring of contacts and provision of free prophylactic antibiotics;\n- disinsection, including rodent and vector control\n- raising public awareness on prevention for bubonic and pneumonic plague;\n- raising awareness among health care workers and providing information to improve case detection, infection control measures, and protection from infection;\n- providing information about infection control measures during burial practices.\n\nWHO has coordinated and mobilised regional and global partners in the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) to support the outbreak response and will continue work with partners to ensure further rapid response support as needed. Working together, the Ministry of Health, WHO, GOARN, and other partners have trained more than 1800 community health workers for contact tracing, about 300 doctors as contact tracing supervisors and has established rapid response teams for case investigation. The IFRC, UNICEF, and USAID have supported case management, including establishment of plague treatment centres. Laboratory confirmation of plague cases is conducted by the Institute Pasteur of Madagascar (IPM). WHO and IPM established a system for specimen collection and referral from peripheral areas to the IPM laboratory to strengthen laboratory capacity for testing and confirmation.\n\nEnhanced measures for exit screening have been implemented at the International Airports in Antananarivo and Nocib\u00e9, to avoid the international spread of pneumonic plague cases. These measures included: filling a special departure form at the airport (to identify passengers at risk); temperature screening of departing passengers, and referring passengers with fever to airport physicians for further consultation; passengers with symptoms compatible with pneumonic plague are immediately isolated at the airport and investigated using a rapid diagnostic test and notified according to the response alert protocol. Symptomatic passengers are not allowed to travel. A WHO GOARN team, consisting of US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and L'Institut de veille sanitaire/Sant\u00e9 publique France (InVS/SPF), provided technical support at the airport to establish exit screening. WHO and partners will support the MOH to re-evaluate the need for continuity of the exit screening and will implement appropriate recommendations.\n\n9 countries and overseas territories in the African region (Comoros, Ethiopia, Kenya, Mauritius, Mozambique, La R\u00e9union (France), Seychelles, South Africa, and Tanzania) had been identified as priority countries for plague preparedness and readiness by virtue of their trade and travel links to Madagascar. These countries have been implementing readiness activities, including increased public awareness of plague, enhancing surveillance for the disease (particularly at points of entry), and prepositioning of equipment and supplies. WHO will support these countries to integrate the plague preparedness and operational readiness activities into their overall multi-hazard preparedness and readiness functions.\n\nWHO risk assessment\n-------------------\nNo new cases of confirmed bubonic plague have been notified after 8 Nov 2017 and no new cases of confirmed pneumonic have been notified since 14 Nov 2017. All contacts finished follow up on 19 Nov 2017. However, plague in Madagascar is seasonal and WHO expects additional reports of cases. It is therefore important for the Ministry of Health, WHO, and partners to sustain prevention and response activities until April 2018. A longer term strategy will be needed for plague prevention, preparedness, and response.\n\nBased on the current epidemiology and response capacity, WHO estimates the risk of plague at the national level is moderate. The risk at the regional and global levels is low.\n\nWHO travel advice\n-----------------\nTo date, there are no reported cases related to international travel. WHO advises against any restriction on travel or trade on Madagascar. WHO recommends that travel measures put in place by neighboring countries in relation to this outbreak be discontinued, given the containment of the pneumonic plague outbreak.\n\nInternational travelers arriving in Madagascar should be informed that plague is endemic in Madagascar, and about the recent plague outbreak. Travelers should protect themselves against flea bites, avoid contact with dead animals, infected tissues or materials, and avoid close contact with patients with pneumonic plague. In case of sudden symptoms of fever, chills, painful and inflamed lymph nodes, or shortness of breath with coughing and/or blood-tainted sputum, travelers should immediately contact a medical service. Travelers should avoid self-medication, even if for prophylaxis. Prophylactic treatment is only recommended for persons who have been in close contact with cases, or with other high risk exposures (such as bites from fleas or direct contact with body fluids or tissues of infected animals). Upon return from travel to Madagascar, travelers should be on alert for the above symptoms. If symptoms appear, travellers should seek medical care and inform their physician about their travel history to Madagascar.\n\nFollowing the visit of the Secretary General of the World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) on 3 Nov 2017, the UN body expressed confidence on tourism in Madagascar and echoed the WHO advice against any travel or trade restrictions against Madagascar.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[There is a continued downward trend in cases as can be seen in Figure 1 in the source URL above.

We did first aid; he was then taken to a big hospital for further treatment. He succumbed sometime after,' says our source.\n\nBefore this last case, the Minister of Public Health, Professor Mamy Lalatiana Andriamanarivo, welcomed the 'Zero deaths for 10 days in Toamasina and for 5 days in Antananarivo'.

The AI-2 system is implicated in regulating various bacterial virulence genes in diverse environmental niches. Deletion of the gene encoding the synthetic enzyme for the AI-2 substrate, luxS, leads to either no significant change or, paradoxically, an increase in in-vivo bacterial virulence. We showed that deletion of the rbsA and lsrA genes, components of ABC transport systems that interact with AI-2, synergistically disrupted AI-2 signaling patterns and resulted in a more-than-50-fold decrease in _Y. pestis_ strain CO92 virulence in a stringent pneumonic plague mouse model. Deletion of luxS or lsrK (encoding AI-2 kinase) from the ArbsA AlsrA background strain or complementation of the ArbsA AlsrA mutant with the corresponding gene(s) reverted the virulence phenotype to that of the wild-type _Y. pestis_ CO92. Furthermore, the administration of synthetic AI-2 in mice infected with the ArbsA AlsrA AluxS mutant strain attenuated this triple mutant to a virulence phenotype similar to that of the ArbsA AlsrA strain in a pneumonic plague model. Conversely, the administration of AI-2 to mice infected with the ArbsA AlsrA AluxS AlsrK mutant did not rescue animals from lethality, indicating the importance of the AI-2-LsrK axis in regulating bacterial virulence. By performing high-throughput RNA sequencing, the potential role of some AI-2-signaling-regulated genes that modulated bacterial virulence was determined. We anticipate that the characterization of AI-2 signaling in _Y. pestis_ will lead to reexamination of AI-2 systems in other pathogens and that AI-2 signaling may represent a broad-spectrum therapeutic target to combat antibiotic-resistant bacteria, which represent a global crisis of the 21st century.\n\n'_Yersinia pestis_ is the bacterial agent that causes the highly fatal disease plague. The organism represents a significant concern because of its potential use as a bioterrorism agent, beyond the several thousand naturally occurring human infection cases occurring globally each year. While there has been development of effective antibiotics, the narrow therapeutic window and challenges posed by the existence of antibiotic-resistant strains represent serious concerns. We sought to identify novel virulence factors that could potentially be incorporated into an attenuated vaccine platform or be targeted by novel therapeutics. We show here that a highly conserved quorum-sensing system, autoinducer-2, significantly affected the virulence of _Y. pestis_ in a mouse model of pneumonic plague. We also identified steps in autoinducer-2 signaling which had confounded previous studies and demonstrated the potential for intervention in the virulence mechanism(s) of autoinducer-2. Our findings may have an impact on bacterial pathogenesis research in many other organisms and could result in identifying potential broad-spectrum therapeutic targets to combat antibiotic-resistant bacteria, which represent a global crisis of the 21st century.' - Mod.LL\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/181.]", "summary": "Sep 2017 / 73 / 17 / 3\n3 Oct 2017 / 194 / 30 / 40\n5 Oct 2017 / 258 / 36 / 32\n7 Oct 2017 / 343 / 42 / 43\n8 Oct 2017 / 387 / 45 / 44\n9 Oct 2017 / 449 / 48 / 62\n10 Oct 2017 / 500 / 54 / 51\n11 Oct 2017 / 561 / 57 / 61\n13 Oct 2017 / 684 / 57 / 61\n16 Oct 2017 / 805 / 74 / 40\n17 Oct 2017 / 878 / 80 / 44\n18 Oct 2017 / 1032 / 89 / 164\n19 Oct 2017 / 1153 / 94 / 121\n20 Oct 2017 / 1297 / 102 / --\n 23 Oct 2017 / 1192 / 124 / 10\n25 Oct 2017 / 1309 / 93 / 58\n27 Oct 2017 / 1554 / 113 / 122\n30 Oct 2017 / 1801 / 127 / 82\n1 Nov 2017 / 1836 / 133 / 17\n3 Nov 2017 / 1947 / 143 / 55\n\nFor any budding pathophysiologists interesting in plague virulence, the following is reproduced here:\nFitts EC, Andersson JA, Kirtley ML, et al: New Insights into Autoinducer-2 signaling as a virulence regulator in a mouse model of pneumonic plague.

However, the occurrence of new cases is finally decreasing, according to a report released [Wed 1 Nov 2017] by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.\n\nThe week of 9 Oct 2017, there were 477 new cases, compared with 161 during the week of 23 Oct 2017. The report says 1044 patients have been cured, and 83 others are receiving treatment. The number of hospitalizations because of the plague has also decreased, according to the WHO. Although the number of total cases has continued to increase, this is because of 'enhanced surveillance and ongoing investigations,' the WHO said; some of the cases were not actually infected, upon inspection.\n\nThe epidemic remains active in 12 districts, and among the total cases reported, 61 percent are said to be the pneumonic plague, according to the UN office. This is faster-spreading and more transmittable than bubonic plague, noted Tarik Jasarevic, a spokesman for the WHO; 'compared with past outbreaks, this year [2017] there is a higher portion of pneumonic plague cases.'\n\nSince plague is endemic (or regularly found) in Madagascar, its 'spread to non-endemic areas which were not used to handling plague cases, including densely populated cities,' may have caused a more severe outbreak, according to Jasarevic. The unusual spread of pneumonic plague in this outbreak was due to one infected person who traveled to find care early in the outbreak, infecting people along the way. These individuals infected others, leading to several chains of transmission, added Nyka Alexander, a representative of the WHO Health Emergencies Programme.\n\nOngoing efforts to control the spread of bubonic and pneumonic plague include seeking out and treating new cases, identifying the method of disease contact, disease follow-up and antibiotic treatment, rodent and flea control, and 'safe and dignified burials,' the WHO said in a statement.\n\n[Byline: Victoria Larned]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[2]\nDate: Thu 2 Nov 2017 8:34\nSource: L'Express Madagascar [machine transl, edited]\nhttp://www.lexpressmada.com/blog/actualites/antananarivo-trois-morts-suspects-de-peste-dans-la-communaute/\n\n\nThe calm of the plague has been broken by the suspicious death of 3 people in Antananarivo, [Tue 31 Oct and Wed 1 Nov 2017]. Unlike the cases reported recently, they all died at the community level with a rapid diagnostic test (RDT) positive for plague, as reported by the Municipal Bureau of Health (BMH) of the Urban Commune of Antananarivo (AUC), which supports the deceased outside health facilities and burial of plague victims in the city of Antananarivo. These deaths were recorded in Andohamandry Manjakamiadana at Andrainarivo and Ampahibe. The first 2 were on [Tue 31 Oct 2017], and the last [Wed 1 Nov 2017]. The Ministry of Health has not yet confirmed cases in Andrainarivo and Amparibe.\n\nOne of Andrainarivo victims was homeless. 'He bowed out on the street,' reports a source at the BMH. It would, thus, the 1st homeless victim of the plague in the capital. 'If the response is not reinforced, the disease will spread quickly to his family and all those who came into contact with him,' says a doctor. The BMH took his body for burial in the grave of Anjanahary last night [Wed 1 Nov 2017].\n\nThe deaths at community level should be alarming indicators for the Department of Public Health. People probably think that the danger is past, with the decline of the victims. So, they will not join the health facilities, despite the presence of symptoms, namely high fever, chills, fatigue, chest pain, cough with sputum streaked with blood. The active case, awareness and all response activities should be strengthened.\n\nYesterday, [Wed 1 Nov 2017], the Secretary General of Public Health, Dr. Jos\u00e9a Ratsirarson emphasized that the plague patient who escaped the anti-plague hospital in Ambohimiandra (CHAPA), last [Thu 26 Oct 2017], has not been found. 'We do not know what has become of him. The last time we joined him on the phone, he agreed to come back to the hospital for treatment, so far he has not showed up, 'he says. We do not know until yesterday [Wed 1 Nov 2017], if it is one of those who died in Antananarivo.\n\nOn [Tue 31 Oct 2017], 83 people were under treatment at the facility level, a thousand people have been cured since the beginning of the epidemic and 7 new cases were recorded throughout Madagascar.

Additionally, it is still difficult to see how the case fatality rate could be as low as it is with over 60 percent of the cases said to be pneumonic plague.\n\nDate / Cases / Deaths / Average new cases per day\n-------------------------------------------------\n14 Sep 2017 / 28 / 5\n30 Sep 2017 / 73 / 17 / 3\n3 Oct 2017 / 194 / 30 / 40\n5 Oct 2017 / 258 / 36 / 32\n7 Oct 2017 / 343 / 42 / 43\n8 Oct 2017 / 387 / 45 / 44\n9 Oct 2017 / 449 / 48 / 62\n10 Oct 2017 / 500 / 54 / 51\n11 Oct 2017 / 561 / 57 / 61\n13 Oct 2017 / 684 / 57 / 61\n16 Oct 2017 / 805 / 74 / 40\n17 Oct 2017 / 878 / 80 / 44\n18 Oct 2017 / 1032 / 89 / 164\n19 Oct 2017 / 1153 / 94 / 121\n20 Oct 2017 / 1297 / 102 / --\n23 Oct 2017 / 1192 / 124 / 10\n25 Oct 2017 / 1309 / 93 / 58\n27 Oct 2017 / 1554 / 113 / 122\n30 Oct 2017 / 1801 / 127 / 82\n1 Nov 2017 / 1836 / 133 / 17. - Mod.LL\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/181.]", "summary": "Sep 2017 / 73 / 17 / 3\n3 Oct 2017 / 194 / 30 / 40\n5 Oct 2017 / 258 / 36 / 32\n7 Oct 2017 / 343 / 42 / 43\n8 Oct 2017 / 387 / 45 / 44\n9 Oct 2017 / 449 / 48 / 62\n10 Oct 2017 / 500 / 54 / 51\n11 Oct 2017 / 561 / 57 / 61\n13 Oct 2017 / 684 / 57 / 61\n16 Oct 2017 / 805 / 74 / 40\n17 Oct 2017 / 878 / 80 / 44\n18 Oct 2017 / 1032 / 89 / 164\n19 Oct 2017 / 1153 / 94 / 121\n20 Oct 2017 / 1297 / 102 / --\n 23 Oct 2017 / 1192 / 124 / 10\n25 Oct 2017 / 1309 / 93 / 58\n27 Oct 2017 / 1554 / 113 / 122\n30 Oct 2017 / 1801 / 127 / 82\n1 Nov 2017 / 1836 / 133 / 17. - Mod.

' \n\nThe week of 9 Oct 2017, there were 477 new cases, compared with 161 during the week of 23 Oct 2017. This is faster-spreading and more transmittable than bubonic plague, noted Tarik Jasarevic, a spokesman for the WHO; 'compared with past outbreaks, this year [2017] there is a higher portion of pneumonic plague cases.' \n\nOngoing efforts to control the spread of bubonic and pneumonic plague include seeking out and treating new cases, identifying the method of disease contact, disease follow-up and antibiotic treatment, rodent and flea control, and 'safe and dignified burials,' the WHO said in a statement. PLAGUE - MADAGASCAR (29): FATAL\n*******************************\n \n\nSince plague is endemic (or regularly found) in Madagascar, its 'spread to non-endemic areas which were not used to handling plague cases, including densely populated cities,' may have caused a more severe outbreak, according to Jasarevic. On [Tue 31 Oct 2017], 83 people were under treatment at the facility level, a thousand people have been cured since the beginning of the epidemic and 7 new cases were recorded throughout Madagascar. The first 2 were on [Tue 31 Oct 2017], and the last [Wed 1 Nov 2017]. Unlike the cases reported recently, they all died at the community level with a rapid diagnostic test (RDT) positive for plague, as reported by the Municipal Bureau of Health (BMH) of the Urban Commune of Antananarivo (AUC), which supports the deceased outside health facilities and burial of plague victims in the city of Antananarivo. The calm of the plague has been broken by the suspicious death of 3 people in Antananarivo, [Tue 31 Oct and Wed 1 Nov 2017].

As of [Fri 10 Nov 2017], a total of 2119 confirmed, probable and suspected cases of plague, including 171 deaths (case fatality rate: 8 percent), have been reported by the Ministry of Health of Madagascar to WHO.\n\nFrom 1 Aug through 10 Nov 2017, 1618 (76 percent) cases and 72 deaths have been clinically classified as pneumonic plague, including 365 (23 percent) confirmed, 573 (35 percent) probable and 680 (42 percent) suspected cases. In addition to the pneumonic cases, 324 (15 percent) cases of bubonic plague, one case of septicemic plague, and 176 unspecified cases (8 percent), have been reported to WHO (Figure 1 [for Figures, see original URL - Mod.LL]). Up to 82 healthcare workers have had illness compatible with plague, none of whom have died.\n\nFrom 1 Aug through 10 Nov, 16 (out of 22) regions of Madagascar have reported cases. Analamanga Region has been the most affected, reporting 72 percent of the overall cases (Figures 2 and 3).\n\nAs of [Fri 10 Nov 2017], 218 out of 243 (90 percent) contacts under follow-up were reached and provided with prophylactic antimicrobials. Since the beginning of the outbreak, a total of 7122 contacts were identified, 6729 (95 percent) of whom have completed their 7-day follow up and a course of prophylactic antimicrobials. Only 9 contacts developed symptoms and became suspected cases.\n\nLaboratory confirmation of plague is being conducted by the Institut Pasteur of Madagascar, National WHO Collaborating Center for plague in Madagascar. Up to 25 isolates of _Yersinia pestis_ have been cultured and all are sensitive to antimicrobials recommended by the National Program for the Control of Plague.\n\nThe number of new cases and hospitalizations of patients due to plague is declining in Madagascar. The last confirmed bubonic case was reported on [Tue 24 Oct 2017] and the last confirmed pneumonic case was reported on [Sat 28 Oct 2017].\n\nSince plague is endemic to parts of Madagascar, WHO expects more cases to be reported until the end of the typical plague season in April 2018. It is therefore important that control measures continue through to the end of the plague season.\n\nPublic health response\n----------------------\n- The Ministry of Public Health of Madagascar is coordinating the health response, with the support of WHO and other agencies and partners.\n- The Ministry of Public Health of Madagascar has activated crisis units in Antananarivo and Toamasina and all cases and contacts have been provided access to treatment or prophylactic antibiotics at no cost to themselves.\n\nPublic health response measures include:\n- Investigation of new cases\n- Isolation and treatment of all pneumonic cases\n- Enhanced case finding\n- Active finding, tracing and monitoring of contacts and provision of free prophylactic antibiotics\n- Strengthened epidemiological surveillance in the all affected districts\n- Disinsection, including rodent and vector control\n- Raising public awareness on prevention for bubonic and pneumonic plague\n- Raising awareness among health care workers and providing information to improve case detection, infection control measures and protection from infection\n- Providing information about infection control measures during burial practices.\n- Enhanced measures for exit screening have been implemented at the International Airport in Antananarivo. These measures include: filling a special departure form at the airport (to identify passengers at risk); temperature screening of departing passengers, and referring passengers with fever to airport physicians for further consultation; passengers with symptoms compatible with pneumonic plague are immediately isolated at the airport and investigated using a rapid diagnostic test and notified according to the response alert protocol. Symptomatic passengers are not allowed to travel. A WHO GOARN team, consisting of US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and L'Institut de veille sanitaire/ Sant\u00e9 publique France (InVS/SPF), is providing technical support at the airport.\n\nA total of 9 countries and overseas territories in the African region (Comoros, Ethiopia, Kenya, Mauritius, Mozambique, La R\u00e9union (France), Seychelles, South Africa, and Tanzania) have been identified as priority countries for plague preparedness and readiness by virtue of their trade and travel links to Madagascar. These countries are implementing readiness activities, including increased public awareness of plague, enhancing surveillance for the disease (particularly at points of entry), and prepositioning of equipment and supplies.\n\nWHO risk assessment\n-------------------\nSince mid-October 2017, the number of new cases of plague, the number of hospitalizations of patients due to plague, and the number of geographic districts reporting plague has decreased. While the declining trend in new plague case reports and reduction in hospitalizations due to plague are encouraging signs, WHO expects more cases of plague to be reported from Madagascar until the typical plague season ends in April 2018.\n\nThe decline in case reports suggest that the epidemic phase of the outbreak is ending, however sustaining ongoing operations is critical to minimize bubonic plague infections and human-to-human transmission of pneumonic plague.\n\nThe trend in the number of new cases of plague has been declining for more than a month, indicating that measures taken to contain the outbreak have been effective. WHO is working with the Ministry of Health in Madagascar and other partners to maintain ongoing outbreak control efforts, including active case finding and treatment, comprehensive contact identification, follow-up and antibiotic treatment, rodent and flea control, and safe and dignified burials through this outbreak and the plague season into 2018, and to outline a longer term strategy for plague preparedness and control.\n\nSince the beginning of this outbreak, the vast majority of cases, and more than 7000 contact persons, have been treated and have recovered. As of 15 November 2017, only 12 people are hospitalized for plague. There has been no international spread outside the country.\n\nBased on available information and response measures implemented to date, WHO estimates the risk of potential further spread of the plague outbreak at national level remains high. The risk of international spread is mitigated by the short incubation period of pneumonic plague, implementation of exit screening measures and advice to travellers to Madagascar, and scaling up of preparedness and operational readiness activities in neighbouring Indian Ocean islands and other southern and east African countries. The overall global risk is considered to be low. WHO is re-evaluating the risk assessment based on the evolution of the outbreak and information from response activities.\n\nAdvice on prevention and control measures and treatment options has been provided to Madagascar and to priority countries in the region.\n\nWHO travel advice\n-----------------\nBased on the available information to date, the risk of international spread of plague appears very low. WHO advises against any restriction on travel or trade on Madagascar. To date, there are no reported cases related to international travel.\n\nInternational travellers arriving in Madagascar should be informed about the current plague outbreak and the necessary protection measures. Travellers should protect themselves against flea bites, avoid contact with dead animals, infected tissues or materials, and avoid close contact with patients with pneumonic plague. In case of sudden symptoms of fever, chills, painful and inflamed lymph nodes, or shortness of breath with coughing and/or blood-tainted sputum, travellers should immediately contact a medical service. Travellers should avoid self-medication, even if for prophylaxis. Prophylactic treatment is only recommended for persons who have been in close contact with cases, or with other high risk exposures (such as bites from fleas or direct contact with body fluids or tissues of infected animals). Upon return from travel to Madagascar, travellers should be on alert for the above symptoms. If symptoms appear, travellers should seek medical care and inform their physician about their travel history to Madagascar.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[With so many cases of pneumonic plague, the case fatality rate seems low.\n\nDate / Cases / Deaths / Average new cases per day\n-------------------------------------------------\n14 Sep 2017 / 28 / 5\n30 Sep 2017 / 73 / 17 / 3\n3 Oct 2017 / 194 / 30 / 40\n5 Oct 2017 / 258 / 36 / 32\n7 Oct 2017 / 343 / 42 / 43\n8 Oct 2017 / 387 / 45 / 44\n9 Oct 2017 / 449 / 48 / 62\n10 Oct 2017 / 500 / 54 / 51\n11 Oct 2017 / 561 / 57 / 61\n13 Oct 2017 / 684 / 57 / 61\n16 Oct 2017 / 805 / 74 / 40\n17 Oct 2017 / 878 / 80 / 44\n18 Oct 2017 / 1032 / 89 / 164\n19 Oct 2017 / 1153 / 94 / 121\n20 Oct 2017 / 1297 / 102 / --\n23 Oct 2017 / 1192 / 124 / 10\n25 Oct 2017 / 1309 / 93 / 58\n27 Oct 2017 / 1554 / 113 / 122\n30 Oct 2017 / 1801 / 127 / 82\n1 Nov 2017 / 1836 / 133 / 17\n3 Nov 2017 / 1947 / 143 / 55.\n10 Nov 2017 / 2119 / 171 / 25. - Mod.LL\n\nA map showing the distribution of cases in Madagascar can be found at the WHO AFRO (African Regional Office) Situation Report 09 from 9 Nov 2017 available at: http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/259424/1/Ex-PlagueMadagascar09112017.pdf. - Mod.MPP\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/181.]", "summary": "Sep 2017 / 73 / 17 / 3\n3 Oct 2017 / 194 / 30 / 40\n5 Oct 2017 / 258 / 36 / 32\n7 Oct 2017 / 343 / 42 / 43\n8 Oct 2017 / 387 / 45 / 44\n9 Oct 2017 / 449 / 48 / 62\n10 Oct 2017 / 500 / 54 / 51\n11 Oct 2017 / 561 / 57 / 61\n13 Oct 2017 / 684 / 57 / 61\n16 Oct 2017 / 805 / 74 / 40\n17 Oct 2017 / 878 / 80 / 44\n18 Oct 2017 / 1032 / 89 / 164\n19 Oct 2017 / 1153 / 94 / 121\n20 Oct 2017 / 1297 / 102 / --\n \n\nPublic health response measures include:\n- Investigation of new cases\n- Isolation and treatment of all pneumonic cases\n- Enhanced case finding\n- Active finding, tracing and monitoring of contacts and provision of free prophylactic antibiotics\n- Strengthened epidemiological surveillance in the all affected districts\n- Disinsection, including rodent and vector control\n- Raising public awareness on prevention for bubonic and pneumonic plague\n- 23 Oct 2017 / 1192 / 124 / 10\n25 Oct 2017 / 1309 / 93 / 58\n27 Oct 2017 / 1554 / 113 / 122\n30 Oct 2017 / 1801 / 127 / 82\n1 Nov 2017 / 1836 / 133 / 17\n3 Nov 2017 / 1947 / 143 / 55.

While the number of patients decrease, 978 people have been cured, 122 are currently on treatment, and 113 deaths have been reported.\n- Between 1 Aug 2017 and 27 Oct 2017, a total of 1554 cases have been notified, out of which 985 are pneumonic plague, 230 bubonic plague, and 339 unknown. Out of these total reported cases, 332 cases are confirmed, 495 cases are probable, and 727 cases suspected. It is noteworthy that only 27 per cent of pneumonic cases have been confirmed so far, while 34 per cent remaining probable and 35 per cent suspect. Considering the current situation and the fact that the plague season in Madagascar runs through April, continued vigilance of the response is required.\n- Treatment and referral capacity, data management, contact tracing, and communication and sensitization have been significantly reinforced. The current focus is on rumour management, addressing stigmatization, safe and respectful burial, and clarifying diagnosis of very young children who are unable to go through regular testing.\n- To facilitate the reopening of schools and the return to school for 415 000 children in affected areas on 6 Nov 2017 (following the precautionary closure of schools on 2 Oct 2017), UNICEF has been working with the Ministry of Education on plague detection and referral protocol and related special training for more than 15 000 teachers and administrative staff to ensure that children with symptoms are properly referred to treatment centres without causing stigmatization or panic.\n- UNICEF's support to the response is focused on improving the health case management in treatment centres, including hygiene and wash provisions; facilitating food provision for patients and families in hospitals and a continuously evolving communication response aimed at sensitizing communities on the dangers of the epidemic; advice on how to prevent and access treatment, as well as address rumours; reduce stigma and facilitate work at community level (tracing, referral, burials).\n\nData as of 27 Oct 2017:\n- 1554 total cases notified, of which 985 cases of pneumonic plague, 230 cases of bubonic plague, and 339 unknown cases, notably in the urban areas of Tamatave and Antananarivo\n- 978 recoveries\n- 113 deaths reported\n- 40 out of 114 districts have been affected with the highest number of cases detected in the capital\n\nSituation overview & humanitarian response\n------------------------------------------\nMadagascar is experiencing 2 concurrent outbreaks of plague: a flea-transmitted bubonic plague outbreak that has spread beyond the usual rural areas where the plague is endemic, into new rural, as well as urban areas; and a 2nd highly-contagious human to human transmitted pneumonic plague outbreak which has been spreading rapidly predominantly in the 3 main urban areas of the country.

The number of new cases of pulmonary plague has continued to decline in all active areas across the country. In the past 2 weeks, 12 previously affected districts reported no new confirmed or probable cases of pulmonary plague. From 1 Aug 2017 to 24 Oct 2017, a total of 1309 suspected cases of plague, including 93 deaths (7 percent), were reported. The figures in this report are based on a rigorous data cleaning, verification and analysis process aimed to give a better understanding of the dynamics of the epidemic. Of these, 882 (67 percent) were clinically classified as pulmonary plague, 221 (17 percent) were bubonic plague, 1 was septicemic, and 186 were unspecified (further classification of cases is in process). Since the beginning of the outbreak, 71 healthcare workers (with no deaths) have been affected.\n\nOf the 882 clinical cases of pneumonic plague, 235 (27 percent) were confirmed, 300 (34 percent) were probable and 347 (39 percent) remain suspected (additional laboratory results are in process). 14 strains of Yersinia pestis have been isolated and were sensitive to antimicrobials recommended by the National Program for the Control of Plague.\n\nBetween 1 Aug 2017 and 24 Oct 2017, 29 districts have reported confirmed and probable cases of pulmonary plague. The number of districts that reported confirmed and probable cases of pulmonary plague during the last 2 weeks reduced to 17. About 70 percent (3467) of 4990 contacts identified have completed their 7-day follow-up and a course of prophylactic antibiotics. A total of 7 contacts developed symptoms and became suspected cases. On 24 Oct 2017, 1165 out of 1239 (94 percent) contacts were followed up and provided with prophylactic antimicrobials.\n\nPlague is endemic on the Plateaux of Madagascar, including Ankazobe district, where the current outbreak originated. A seasonal upsurge, predominantly of the bubonic form, usually occurs yearly between September and April. In 2017, the plague season began earlier and the current outbreak is predominantly pneumonic and is affecting both endemic and non-endemic areas, including major urban centres such as Antananarivo (the capital city) and Toamasina (the port city).\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n[The overall numbers of cases and deaths, as noted in this report, have been lessened based on 'a rigorous data cleaning, verification and analysis process aimed to give a better understanding of the dynamics of the epidemic' although the Outbreak News report from 30 Oct 2017 gives higher numbers from perhaps a different source.

The disease can be transmitted between humans by contact with infected bodily fluids; humans can be also infected by touching or skinning infected animals.\n- The infection can cause a severe disease in humans but can be successfully treated with early administration of antimicrobials. If bubonic form is not treated, the infection can spread through the bloodstream to the lungs, resulting in pneumonic or septicemic form of plague.\n- A case of bubonic plague can be suspected on aircraft or ships when a passenger or a crew member leaving an affected area has a fever associated with swollen lymph nodes.\n- The presence of trained crew members and their awareness of the disease could help reduce the risk of onboard transmission.\n- The main risk of transmission on aircraft and ships lies in infected fleas infesting a passenger and/or his/her belongings. The transmission by bodily fluids (such as the fluid from the buboes) requires exposure to infected material through a break in the skin; this can be considered unlikely on aircraft and ships, but it cannot be excluded.\n- Members of the cabin crew assisting an ill passenger should wear gloves; the ill passenger and the crew member assisting him/her should follow standard infection control precautions.\n- Local authorities at the arrival airport/mooring port of call should be informed immediately after the identification of a suspected case of bubonic plague on board so they can plan mitigation measures aimed at reducing the risk of further spread.\n- If there is a suspected plague case on board, passengers should be informed about how to self-monitor for plague-compatible symptoms; the collection of passenger contact details is crucial for further contact tracing.\n- Physicians should consider early post-exposure prophylaxis for passengers and crew members who have come in direct contact with body fluids of the ill passenger.\n- Arrangements for post-event disinfection and disinsection procedures for the aircraft and the ill passenger's belongings should be considered after disembarking.\n- On a ship, the WHO's International medical guide for ships suggests that the patient's quarters and all other passenger quarters should be treated with insecticide powder in order to ensure the extermination of fleas.\n- After disembarking from a ship, the sickbay and/or the cabin where the ill passenger was isolated should be disinfected and disinsected.

A person can die within 48 hours of the disease's onset if not treated with antibiotics. Symptoms of pneumonic plague include coughing, fever, chest pain and difficulty breathing.\n\nWhile plague is a recurring problem in Madagascar, this particular outbreak has triggered a nationwide panic because it has moved from remote rural areas into the cities, including the capital, Antananarivo.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[2]\nDate: Thu 19 Oct 2017\nSource: BNGRC (National Office for the Management of Risks and Crises) [in French. trans., edited]edited]\nhttp://www.bngrc-mid.mg/images/document/Peste2017/Bulletin_Flash_19_10_2017_20h00_vff6.pdf\n\n\nCurrently, 39 districts in 17 Regions of Madagascar are affected by the plague epidemic.

Symptoms include painful, swollen lymph nodes, called bubos, as well as fever, chills and coughing.\n\nPneumonic plague is more virulent or damaging and is an advanced form characterized by a severe lung infection that can be transmitted from person to person via airborne droplets such as through coughing or sneezing, for example. The incubation period is short, and an infected person may die within 12 to 24 hours. Both forms can be treated with antimicrobials, making early detection a priority.\n\nOf Madagascar's 114 districts, 40 have reported cases of pneumonic plague and less than 30 percent of people who have had contact with cases can be traced, according to the UN office. Those who've been in contact might need treatment themselves and may pose further risk of spreading the infection. Cases have been reported in at least 10 cities, including the larger, more populated, cities of Antananarivo and Toamasina. But 780 individuals have been cured of their infection since 1 Aug 2017 and 6 of the affected districts have not reported new cases for 15 days, the UN report states. Despite the increase in numbers, the trend has been relatively stable, a World Health Organization representative told CNN.\n\nDr Charlotte Ndiaye, WHO representative in Madagascar, added that about half the deaths are occurring in the community, not health centers, according to government figures, which demonstrates that more work needs to be done to help people understand that treatment is available, and they need to go to health services as quickly as possible.\n\nPlague is endemic to Madagascar, with an estimated 400 cases reported there every year, mostly the bubonic variety, but the current outbreak has affected more areas and started earlier than usual. It is also unusual for large urban areas to be affected, as they have been this year, the WHO previously told CNN.\n\nThe current outbreak began after the death of a man in the central highlands of the country -- a plague-endemic area -- after which the Ministry of Public Health began investigating and tracing his contacts, according to the WHO. The epidemic has garnered national and international control efforts. 8 health centers have been designated by WHO to manage plague cases and alleviate the burden on hospitals and health clinics. Last week [week of 16 Oct 2017] the International Federation of Red Cross also announced the deployment of a treatment center in the country.\n\nWHO has also provided the medications to treat up to 5000 people and protect 100 000 people who may have been in contact with infected individuals. Both organizations have trained and mobilized thousands of volunteers. Protocols are also being proposed for safe burial practices to ensure maximum safety and protection from infection. Public schools are closed and the government has forbidden public gatherings, according to the Red Cross.\n\nThe risk of further spread nationally remains very high, WHO stated in its most recent situation report, and risk of regional spread is moderate due to neighboring islands and southern and east African countries. 'The risk of international spread is low, because generally, people with plague are too sick to travel,' Ndiaye told CNN in a previous report. She explained WHO is working closely with Madagascar's airport authorities to ensure control measures -- such as temperature checks and medical teams -- are in place at airports and ports to prevent the spread of infection outside the country.\n\n[Byline: Meera Senthilingam]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\nThe plague epidemic in Madagascar continues to grow dramatically with a majority of cases being pneumonic plague which is easily passed from person-to-person and has involved healthcare workers as well.\n\nDate / Cases / Deaths / Average new cases per day\n-------------------------------------------------\n14 Sep 2017 / 28 / 5\n30 Sep 2017 / 73 / 17 / 3\n3 Oct 2017 / 194 / 30 / 40\n5 Oct 2017 / 258 / 36 / 32\n7 Oct 2017 / 343 / 42 / 43\n8 Oct 2017 / 387 / 45 / 44\n9 Oct 2017 / 449 / 48 / 62\n10 Oct 2017 / 500 / 54 / 51\n11 Oct 2017 / 561 / 57 / 61\n13 Oct 2017 / 684 / 57 / 61\n16 Oct 2017 / 805 / 74 / 40\n17 Oct 2017 / 878 / 80 / 44\n18 Oct 2017 / 1032 / 89 / 164\n19 Oct 2017 / 1153 / 94 / 121\n20 Oct 2017 / 1297 / 102 / --\n23 Oct 2017 / 1192 / 124 / 10\n\n[Sources reported 105 more cases of plague on 20 Oct 2017 than what has come out in the latest WHO report.

The announcement was made by Hery Perez De Cuellar, president of the National Association of Interns inside the University Hospital Joseph Ravoahangy Andrianavalona (CHU JRA) yesterday, 23 Oct 2017. 'We are weakly protected in the care of patients. The mouth covers used are those used by surgeons. The on-call blouses change only every 24 hours. And at the beginning of the epidemic, we bought ourselves this equipment,' said the medical student, shocked.\n\nThese 7th and 8th year students of the Faculty of Medicine are an integral part of health personnel involved in the care of plague victims. 'We receive the patients at the triage, do the tubing or the puncture for the rapid diagnostic test, and inject the patients. Sometimes we take samples from a corpse. So we are exposed to the bacteria at any time,' testified these future doctors. The majority of these students are already healed, and some are still undergoing treatment. Others are on contact chemoprophylaxis.\n\nThese interns threaten to suspend their activities, if they do not have personal protective equipment. 'We are not going to expose our lives to such a danger, however, knowing that other health workers receive more appropriate protection,' they say.\n\nThe Ministry of Public Health denies this information. 'They exaggerate. The delivery of equipment has been slightly delayed, but that's it; it arrived and was given to beneficiaries this afternoon (note: yesterday),' says a source from the ministry.\n\nThese students are not the only [healthcare] victims of this disease since the beginning of the epidemic. In 2 months, at least 2 dozen doctors, paramedics, and other health workers, have been affected and were cured.\n\n[Byline: Miangaly\u2008Ralitera]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n[The following from my old friend Bob Weinstein (Kool JL, Weinstein RA: Risk of person-to-person transmission of pneumonic plague. Clin Infect Dis 2005; 40: 1166-72) summarizes what is known about person-to-person spread of _Y. pestis_. Although from 2005, it is not clear that there is much more recent data. The table, references and the entire paper can be seen at\nhttps://academic.oup.com/cid/article/40/8/1166/2040909:\n\n'Experimental data\n------------------\nDuring the Manchurian epidemic of 1910-11, Strong and Teague did experiments to characterize the airborne spread of the bacteria [7]. Agar plates were exposed for different durations at distances varying from 5 cm to 2 m from patients' mouths. All experiments were done with patients in the final stage of disease, who produced bloody sputum. Plates with visible drops of sputum were discarded. These experiments were done under extremely difficult conditions; their sensitivity to detect airborne bacteria is unknown. Only 1 of 39 plates held in front of non-coughing patients yielded positive results. The furthest observed distance of spread was 1 m (3.3 ft) (table 3). The only 2 plates that were exposed at 2 m (6.6 ft) were overgrown with other bacteria and could not be evaluated [7]. Other researchers have done similar experiments; the largest reported distance of spread varies from 50 cm to 1.12 m (1.6-3.7 ft) [6].\n\nDiscussion\n----------\nPneumonic plague is perhaps the only disease for which we have to rely largely on information that is almost a century old. This information is often anecdotal, may have been subject to bias, and may not satisfy modern scientific standards. Nevertheless, I believe that the researchers of those days tried to be conscientious and professional, and that their assessments are still valuable. The historical accounts as well as the limited evidence from more recent outbreaks discussed in this article agree that pneumonic plague is not easily transmitted from one person to another. Most modern experts agree with this interpretation [9, 12], which was also strengthened by a mathematical model using data from published outbreaks that found an R0 value (that is, the average number of secondary cases per primary case) that was close to 1 [21].\n\nPerhaps the most convincing evidence of the low risk of transmission is the absence of any documented human-to-human transmission of plague in the Untied States since 1925, long before effective antibiotics were available as prophylaxis for contacts. Antibiotic prophylaxis has been available since 1948. However, the diagnosis of plague often is delayed for several days, such as in the case of a patient in 1980 who was only diagnosed with plague 4 days after her death and after 180 persons had been in contact with her [22]. It is unlikely that post-exposure prophylaxis could have been responsible for prevention of all infections, if plague would be easily transmitted from person to person. The conclusion is that improved living conditions, better hygiene, better understanding of the disease, and a low underlying risk of infection must have been important factors for the absence of transmission.\n\nThe historical accounts I have cited show large differences in infection rates. These can probably be explained by differences in living conditions, hygiene, and observance of protective measures. There are no indications that differences in virulence or host factors could have played a role.\n\nTransmission apparently occurs through direct contact or through inhalation of airborne droplets expelled by coughing persons. The very close contact required for transmission in clinical settings and the limited distance of spread demonstrated by experiments are indications that droplet nuclei do not play a significant role [23].\n\nPatients in the early stage of pneumonic plague (approximately the 1st 20-24 h) apparently pose little risk [9]. This is likely because of the low counts of bacteria in their respiratory secretions and the general absence of coughing. Patients in the final stages of disease who cough sputum with much visible blood and/or pus pose the highest risk of infection.\n\nAntibiotic medication rapidly clears the sputum of plague bacilli, so that a patient generally is not infective within hours after initiation of effective antibiotic treatment [8]. This means that in modern times many patients may not reach a stage where they pose a significant risk to others.\n\nSimple protective measures can further reduce the risk of infection. This is evidenced by the numerous outbreaks that stopped as soon as the population at risk realized that they were dealing with a contagious disease and before public health authorities took measures to control it. The main factors preventing transmission must have included avoidance of direct contact with patients, maintenance of a greater physical distance between caretakers and ill persons, reduction of the time caretakers spent with each patient, and perhaps implementation of better hygienic practices, such as hand washing. In the Manchurian epidemics, a mask made of several layers of gauze seems to have protected almost all physicians who used it.\n\nWhat precautions should health care workers take while caring for suspected pneumonic plague patients? In the case of a bioterrorist event involving plague, the health care system of a region will be easily overwhelmed, especially if strict isolation is instituted indiscriminately for many patients. Strict isolation by itself can reduce a patient's chance of recovery [24]. Therefore, it is important to carefully triage patients according to which patients should be nursed with precautions, and it is important to reevaluate precautions for patients who may no longer pose a risk. Protective measures, prophylaxis, and treatment of the patient should be commenced as soon as there is suspicion of pneumonic plague. However, the diagnosis of pneumonic plague should be confirmed by microbiological examination of respiratory secretions. If a bioterrorist event is suspected, it is also important to obtain an isolate to determine its antibiotic susceptibility, because the bacteria may have been engineered for resistance.\n\nRecommendations have been published by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices [25], the Working Group on Civilian Biodefense [2], and the Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology, and CDC's Hospital Infections Program [26]. All of these guidelines agree on an approach that balances the risk of person-to-person transmission with limited health care resources, and they include the following recommendations:\n- implement droplet precautions for patients with suspected cases of pneumonic plague until they have received effective antibiotic treatment for 48 h (72 h of treatment is recommended in [26]);\n- wear disposable surgical masks to help reduce the risk from large respiratory droplets. Because droplet nuclei are not thought to be a factor in the airborne spread of plague [2, 23], use of fitted N95 masks, full face pieces with N-/R-/P-100 filters, or powered air-purifying respirators with high-efficiency filters is not recommended.\n- use standard precautions for non-pneumonic plague patients;\n- monitor the body temperature of potentially exposed persons;\n- consider post-exposure chemoprophylaxis for persons who have been in unprotected close contact (defined as coming within 2 m by [2] and [25] and within 1 m by [26]) with a person with pneumonic plague who has not received antibiotic treatment for at least 48 h. Doxycycline, ciprofloxacin, chloramphenicol, and cotrimoxazole can be used for prophylaxis. If possible, the choice of drug should be guided by the antimicrobial resistance profile of the isolated strain;\n- Isolation of asymptomatic close contacts is not recommended.'\n- Mod.LL]", "summary": "Sep 2017 / 73 / 17 / 3\n3 Oct 2017 / 194 / 30 / 40\n5 Oct 2017 / 258 / 36 / 32\n7 Oct 2017 / 343 / 42 / 43\n8 Oct 2017 / 387 / 45 / 44\n9 Oct 2017 / 449 / 48 / 62\n10 Oct 2017 / 500 / 54 / 51\n11 Oct 2017 / 561 / 57 / 61\n13 Oct 2017 / 684 / 57 / 61\n16 Oct 2017 / 805 / 74 / 40\n17 Oct 2017 / 878 / 80 / 44\n18 Oct 2017 / 1032 / 89 / 164\n19 Oct 2017 / 1153 / 94 / 121\n20 Oct 2017 / 1297 / 102 / --\n23 Oct 2017 / 1192 / 124 / 10\n\n[Sources reported 105 more cases of plague on 20 Oct 2017 than what has come out in the latest WHO report. \n- use standard precautions for non-pneumonic plague patients;\n- monitor the body temperature of potentially exposed persons;\n- consider post-exposure chemoprophylaxis for persons who have been in unprotected close contact (defined as coming within 2 m by [2] and [25] and within 1 m by [26]) with a person with pneumonic plague who has not received antibiotic treatment for at least 48 h.

[1] WHO numbers\n[2] Personal protective equipment\n\n******\n \n\nPneumonic plague is more virulent or damaging and is an advanced form characterized by a severe lung infection that can be transmitted from person to person via airborne droplets such as through coughing or sneezing, for example. \n\nOf Madagascar's 114 districts, 40 have reported cases of pneumonic plague and less than 30 percent of people who have had contact with cases can be traced, according to the UN office.

PLAGUE - MADAGASCAR (25): FATAL, REVISED NUMBERS, HEALTH CARE TRANSMISSION\n \n\nAntibiotic medication rapidly clears the sputum of plague bacilli, so that a patient generally is not infective within hours after initiation of effective antibiotic treatment [8]. \nPneumonic plague is perhaps the only disease for which we have to rely largely on information that is almost a century old. However, the diagnosis of plague often is delayed for several days, such as in the case of a patient in 1980 who was only diagnosed with plague 4 days after her death and after 180 persons had been in contact with her [22]. [The following from my old friend Bob Weinstein (Kool JL, Weinstein RA: Risk of person-to-person transmission of pneumonic plague. Patients in the early stage of pneumonic plague (approximately the 1st 20-24 h) apparently pose little risk [9]. Plague is caused by infection with the bacterium _Yersinia pestis_ and is typically spread through the bite of infected fleas, frequently carried by rats, causing bubonic plague. \n\nThese 7th and 8th year students of the Faculty of Medicine are an integral part of health personnel involved in the care of plague victims. ' Therefore, it is important to carefully triage patients according to which patients should be nursed with precautions, and it is important to reevaluate precautions for patients who may no longer pose a risk. [Byline: Miangaly\u2008Ralitera]\n\n--\n Because droplet nuclei are not thought to be a factor in the airborne spread of plague [2, 23], use of fitted N95 masks, full face pieces with N-/R-/P-100 filters, or powered air-purifying respirators with high-efficiency filters is not recommended. Communicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n The majority of cases, 67 percent, were the pneumonic form of the disease, which can spread from person to person. The historical accounts as well as the limited evidence from more recent outbreaks discussed in this article agree that pneumonic plague is not easily transmitted from one person to another. In the case of a bioterrorist event involving plague, the health care system of a region will be easily overwhelmed, especially if strict isolation is instituted indiscriminately for many patients. With close to 65 percent of the cases diagnosed as pneumonic plague, the case fatality rate of about 8 percent seems quite low. - Mod. MJ]\n\n*****\n But 780 individuals have been cured of their infection since 1 Aug 2017 and 6 of the affected districts have not reported new cases for 15 days, the UN report states. A total of 30 health care students have contracted plague by intervening in the management of patients, since the beginning of the epidemic. It is unlikely that post-exposure prophylaxis could have been responsible for prevention of all infections, if plague would be easily transmitted from person to person. 14 Sep 2017 / 28 / 5\n30 The risk of international spread is low, because generally, people with plague are too sick to travel,' Ndiaye told CNN in a previous report. Date / Cases / Deaths / Average new cases per day\n 8 health centers have been designated by WHO to manage plague cases and alleviate the burden on hospitals and health clinics. \n\nTransmission apparently occurs through direct contact or through inhalation of airborne droplets expelled by coughing persons. The main factors preventing transmission must have included avoidance of direct contact with patients, maintenance of a greater physical distance between caretakers and ill persons, reduction of the time caretakers spent with each patient, and perhaps implementation of better hygienic practices, such as hand washing. Protective measures, prophylaxis, and treatment of the patient should be commenced as soon as there is suspicion of pneumonic plague. \n\nRecommendations have been published by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices [25], the Working Group on Civilian Biodefense [2], and the Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology, and CDC's Hospital Infections Program [26]. If possible, the choice of drug should be guided by the antimicrobial resistance profile of the isolated strain;\n- Isolation of asymptomatic close contacts is not recommended.' Plague is endemic to Madagascar, with an estimated 400 cases reported there every year, mostly the bubonic variety, but the current outbreak has affected more areas and started earlier than usual. \n\nSimple protective measures can further reduce the risk of infection. The risk of further spread nationally remains very high, WHO stated in its most recent situation report, and risk of regional spread is moderate due to neighboring islands and southern and east African countries. ' [2] Personal protective equipment\n The conclusion is that improved living conditions, better hygiene, better understanding of the disease, and a low underlying risk of infection must have been important factors for the absence of transmission. \n\nWHO has also provided the medications to treat up to 5000 people and protect 100 000 people who may have been in contact with infected individuals. She explained WHO is working closely with Madagascar's airport authorities to ensure control measures -- such as temperature checks and medical teams -- are in place at airports and ports to prevent the spread of infection outside the country. The very close contact required for transmission in clinical settings and the limited distance of spread demonstrated by experiments are indications that droplet nuclei do not play a significant role [23]. Patients in the final stages of disease who cough sputum with much visible blood and/or pus pose the highest risk of infection. [1] WHO numbers\n \n\nThese students are not the only [healthcare] victims of this disease since the beginning of the epidemic. Most modern experts agree with this interpretation [9, 12], which was also strengthened by a mathematical model using data from published outbreaks that found an R0 value (that is, the average number of secondary cases per primary case) that was close to 1 [21]. Clin Infect Dis 2005; 40: 1166-72) summarizes what is known about person-to-person spread of _Y. pestis_. \n\nThe historical accounts I have cited show large differences in infection rates. This is evidenced by the numerous outbreaks that stopped as soon as the population at risk realized that they were dealing with a contagious disease and before public health authorities took measures to control it. \n\nThe Ministry of Public Health denies this information.

When it began to move out from the areas where it traditionally occurs, people became increasingly alarmed - both within the island nation and in neighbouring territories and countries. From August to late October [2017], more than 1800 suspected, probable or confirmed plague cases were reported, resulting in 127 deaths. This outbreak is unusually severe, and there are still 5 more months to go before the end of the plague season. WHO has acted quickly, releasing funds and sending experts and supplies to Madagascar, while supporting neighbouring countries to reduce the risk of regional spread.\n\nPlague is one of the oldest - and most feared - of all diseases. Historically, plague has been responsible for widespread pandemics with high mortality. It was known as the 'Black Death' during the 14th century, causing more than 50 million deaths in Europe. Nowadays, plague is easily prevented and treated with antibiotics if detected early enough, and infection can be prevented through the use of standard precautions.\n\n'An outbreak of plague no longer unfolds in the manner portrayed by our history books,' said Dr Sylvie Briand, Director of WHO's Infectious Hazard Management Department. 'Plague is an old disease, but the challenges it poses today are contemporary and fundamentally different from what we had even 40 years ago.'\n\nDespite the relative ease of treatment, plague's association with the Black Death weighs heavily on the popular conscience - and is regularly cited in media reports and tabloid headlines about outbreaks. So it is important to strike a balance between encouraging countries in the region to be ready to act in case of an outbreak, while avoiding panic that could result in unnecessary or counterproductive measures such as trade restrictions or travel bans on affected countries.\n\nDays after being alerted to the plague outbreak in Madagascar, WHO conducted an assessment to determine the risk of further spread. Taking into account the country's capacities and vulnerabilities, the assessment found that the overall risk of further spread at the national level was high, at the regional level was moderate, and at the global level was low.\n\nWHO moved quickly to support the Government of Madagascar to respond to the outbreak, while at the same time working with nearby countries and territories. Neighboring Comoros, Mauritius, Mozambique, Reunion and Mayotte, Seychelles, South Africa, and the United Republic of Tanzania were prioritized for increased plague preparedness and surveillance. WHO has also helped Ethiopia and Kenya to raise preparedness levels because of their direct airline connections with Madagascar.\n\nWhen WHO began to increase support for the Malagasy Government's response to the outbreak, one of the 1st places they went was the capital's international airport. A WHO team advised on putting in place more robust and visible public health measures. The strengthened exit screening system provides information about plague to all travellers, screens passengers through temperature checks and medical questionnaires, and includes procedures to isolate and treat symptomatic passengers. 'The exit screening process tracks passengers from the moment they enter the airport until they board a flight. We also provided information to airline companies and spoke to airport medical personnel. We explained the disease, the risks, and how they can be prepared,' said Dr Briand.\n\nFor the 9 priority regional countries and territories, the first step was to identify weak points in preparedness and operational readiness. WHO worked with national health authorities to complete a plague preparedness checklist to assess their readiness, and to identify concrete actions to bridge gaps. The checklist assesses national coordination mechanisms, and logistical, epidemiological, and laboratory surveillance capabilities. It verifies that Rapid Response Teams are ready to deploy, that risk communication and community engagement strategies are prepared, and that preparedness measures are in place at points of entry. If gaps are identified, immediate steps are taken to address them. In Seychelles, WHO supported laboratory testing of suspected cases, deployed experts and medical supplies, and provided guidance for the tracing and treatment of contacts of people suspected to be infected.\n\nIn Mauritius, in addition to completing the checklist, WHO helped to address concerns about the high number of direct flights between Madagascar and Mauritius by supporting the Health Minister to communicate the measures being taken to strengthen plague preparedness at all levels.\n\nWHO logistics teams also prepositioned equipment and supplies - including personal protective equipment (PPE), antibiotics, and other equipment required to safely identify plague cases - in Comoros, Mauritius, Mozambique, and the United Republic of Tanzania.\n\nThe quick and coordinated efforts to strengthen plague preparedness have also helped build regional outbreak response capacity more generally. 'We've accomplished a great deal in a short time, and helped to strengthen overall regional health security,' said Dr Ibrahima-Soce Fall, WHO Regional Emergencies Director for the WHO African Region. 'But to ensure longer-term sustainability, we have to provide continuing support for Madagascar's health system to better anticipate, detect, and respond to future plague outbreaks. Supporting these efforts improves health security for everyone.'\n\nThrough its Health Emergencies programme, financial support for WHO's response to the plague outbreak in Madagascar has been provided by the WHO Contingency Fund for Emergencies (CFE) and the governments of Italy and Norway.\n\nThe International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, as well as the Malagasy National Society, the Institute Pasteur, M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF), UNICEF, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Sant\u00e9 publique France, the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) and other partners are actively supporting the government and health authorities in Madagascar.\n\nWHO has provided technical and operational support in a wide range of areas from coordination and planning to surveillance, case management, community engagement, logistics, and more.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[There continues to be substantial variation in the numbers reported in this significant outbreak of plague, making interpretations of control difficult to make.

It affects mainly poor and remote populations. Late diagnosis is one of the major causes of human death and spread of the disease, since it limits the effectiveness of control measures. We aimed to develop and assess a rapid diagnostic test (RDT) for plague.\n\nMethods: We developed a test that used monoclonal antibodies to the F1 antigen of _Yersinia pestis_. Sensitivity and specificity were assessed with a range of bacterial cultures and clinical samples, and compared with findings from available ELISA and bacteriological tests for plague. Samples from patients thought to have plague were tested with the RDT in the laboratory and by health workers in 26 pilot sites in Madagascar.\n\nFindings: The RDT detected concentrations of F1 antigen as low as 0.5 ng/mL in up to 15 min, and had a shelf life of 21 days at 60 deg C [140 deg F]. Its sensitivity and specificity were both 100 percent. RDT detected 41.6 percent and 31 percent more positive clinical specimens than did bacteriological methods and ELISA, respectively. The agreement rate between tests done at remote centres and in the laboratory was 89.8 percent. With the combination of bacteriological methods and F1 ELISA as reference standard, the positive and negative predictive values of the RDT were 90.6 percent and 86.7 percent, respectively.\n\nInterpretation: Our RDT is a specific, sensitive, and reliable test that can easily be done by health workers at the patient's bedside, for the rapid diagnosis of pneumonic and bubonic plague.

At least 39 healthcare workers have contracted plague since the beginning of the outbreak.\n\nOf the 849 reported cases, 78 (9.2 percent) were confirmed, 304 (35.8 percent) were classified as probable after testing positive on rapid diagnostic tests (RDT) and 467 (55 percent) remain suspected. 11 strains of _Yersinia pestis_ have been isolated and were sensitive to antibiotics recommended by the National Program for the Control of Plague.\n\nOut of 22 regions in the country, 18 (81.2 percent), including traditionally non-endemic areas, have been affected. The district of Antananarivo Renivohitra has been the most affected, accounting for 57.1 percent of the reported cases. As of 16 Oct 2017, a total of 3745 contacts were identified, 79.2 percent (2967) of them were followed up on the day of reporting.\n\nPlague is endemic on the Plateaux of Madagascar, including Ankazobe district where the current outbreak originated. There is a seasonal upsurge, predominantly of the bubonic form, which occurs every year, usually between September and April. The plague season began earlier this year [2017] and the current outbreak is predominantly pneumonic and is affecting non-endemic areas including major urban centres such as Antananarivo (the capital city) and Toamasina (the port city).\n\n[The full document is available at the source URL above]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[2] Madagascar Ministry of Public Health\nDate: Wed 18 Oct 2017 20:00 EAT\nSource: Madagascar Ministry of Public Health [in French, machine trans., edited]\nhttp://www.bngrc-mid.mg/images/document/Peste2017/Bulletin_flash_18_10_2017_20h00_vff5.pdf\n\n\nGeneral situation of plague in Madagascar\n----------------------------------------\nThe plague epidemic currently affects 39 districts spread over 17 regions of Madagascar.

Effective treatment with antiserum was initiated in 1896, but this therapy was supplanted by sulfonamides in the 1930s and by streptomycin starting in 1947. India suffered an estimated 6 million deaths in 1900-1909, and Viet Nam, during its war in 1965-1975, accounted for approximately 80 percent of the world's cases; since then, African countries have dominated, with more than 90 percent of the world's cases in the 1990s and early 21st century. Serological diagnosis with fraction 1 antigen to detect anti-plague antibodies was developed in the 1950s. Vaccine development started in 1897 with killed whole bacterial cells, and this was followed by a live attenuated bacterial vaccine, leading to millions of persons receiving injections, but the benefits of these vaccines remain clouded by controversy. Plasmid-mediated virulence was established in 1981, and this was followed by specific DNA methods that have allowed detection of plague genes in skeletal specimens from European graves of the 6th to 17th centuries.'\n- Mod.LL\n\nMaps of Madagascar can be seen at http://www.geoatlas.com/medias/maps/countries/madagascar/mar2582r/madagascar_pol.jpg and http://healthmap.org/promed/p/181. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ]", "summary": "Sep 2017 / 73 / 17 / 3\n3 Oct 2017 / 194 / 30 / 40\n5 Oct 2017 / 258 / 36 / 32\n7 Oct 2017 / 343 / 42 / 43\n8 Oct 2017 / 387 / 45 / 44\n9 Oct 2017 / 449 / 48 / 62\n10 Oct 2017 / 500 / 54 / 51\n11 Oct 2017 / 561 / 57 / 61\n13 Oct 2017 / 684 / 57 / 61\n16 Oct 2017 / 805 / 74 / 40\n17 Oct 2017 / 878 / 80 / 44\n\nAlthough the WHO report above mentions 849 cases and 67 deaths, the Madagascar MOH indicates 878 cases and 80 deaths; I have made a moderator's decision to use the higher numbers.

Situation update:\nMadagascar has been experiencing a large outbreak of plague affecting major cities and other non-endemic areas since August 2017. Between one August and 19 October 2017, a total of 1297 cases (suspected, probable and confirmed) including 102 deaths (case fatality rate 7.9 percent) have been reported. Of these, 846 cases (65.2 percent) were clinically classified as pneumonic plague, 270 (20.8 percent) were bubonic plague, one case was septicaemic plague, and 180 cases were unspecified (further classification of cases is in process). Of the 846 cases of pulmonary plague, 91 (10.8 percent) have been confirmed and 407 (48.1 percent) were probable.\n\nBetween one Aug and 15 Oct 2017, a total of 793 specimens were analysed by the Institut Pasteur de Madagascar (IPM). Of these, 126 (15.9 percent) have been confirmed either by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or bacteriological culture, 242 (30.5 percent) were probable after testing positive on rapid diagnostic tests (RDT) and 425 (53.6 percent) remain suspected (additional laboratory results are in process). Eleven strains of Yersinia pestis have been isolated and were sensitive to antimicrobials recommended by the National Program for the Control of Plague.\nOverall, 33 out of 114 (30 percent) districts in 14 of 22 (63.6 percent) regions in the country have been affected by pulmonary plague. The district of Antananarivo Renivohitra has reported the largest number of pulmonary plague cases, accounting for 63.6 percent of all the cases.\n\nOn 19 October 2017, 1621 out of 2 470 (65.6 percent) contacts were followed up and provided with prophylactic antimicrobials. A total of 372 contacts completed the 7-day follow up without developing symptoms.\n\nPlague is endemic on the Plateaux of Madagascar, including Ankazobe District where the current outbreak originated. There is a seasonal upsurge, predominantly of the bubonic form, which occurs every year, usually between September and April. The plague season began earlier this year [2017] and the current outbreak is predominantly pneumonic and is affecting non-endemic areas including major urban centres such as Antananarivo (the capital city) and Toamasina (the port city).\n\nAs this is a rapidly changing situation, the reported number of cases and deaths, contacts being monitored and the laboratory results are subject to change due to enhanced surveillance, contact tracing activities, ongoing laboratory investigations, reclassification, and case, contact and laboratory data consolidation.\n\nCurrent risk assessment:\nWhile the current outbreak began with one large epidemiologically linked cluster, cases of pneumonic plague without apparent epidemiologic links have since been detected in regions across Madagascar, including the densely populated cities of Antananarivo and Toamasina. Due to the increased risk of further spread and the severe nature of the disease, the overall risk at the national level is considered very high. The risk of regional spread is moderate due to the occurrence of frequent travel by air and sea to neighbouring Indian Ocean islands and other southern and east African countries, and the observation of a limited number of cases in travelers. This risk is mitigated by the short incubation period of pneumonic plague, implementation of exit screening measures in Madagascar and scaling up of preparedness and operational readiness activities in neighbouring Indian Ocean islands and other southern and east African countries. The overall global risk is considered to be low.\n\nThe risk assessment will be re-evaluated by WHO based on the evolution of the situation and the available information.\n\nStrategic approach to the prevention, detection and control of plague:\n\nWHO recommends the implementation of proven strategies for the prevention and control of plague. These strategies include (i) coordination of the response, (ii) enhanced surveillance, (iii) laboratory confirmation, (iv) contact identification and follow-up, (v) case management, (vi) infection prevention and control, (vii) safe and dignified burials, (viii) social mobilization and community engagement, (ix) logistics, (x) risk communication, (xi) vector control, (xii) partner engagement, (xiii) research and (xiv) resource mobilization.\n\nCoordination of the response:\n\nA high level coordination forum to provide strategic and policy directions to the plague outbreak response has been established, chaired by the Prime Minister. Similarly, the Country Humanitarian Team of the United Nations System established a strategic coordination platform for partners, chaired by the Resident Coordinator. The health response is coordinated by the Ministry of Public Health, co-led by WHO and supported by agencies and partners directly involved in the health response. The health sector response is organized into four major committees: (i) surveillance, (ii) community response, (iii) case management, and (v) communication; with the logistics committee crosscutting all committees. Coordination of partners in the Health cluster has been strengthened to ensure effectiveness, avoid duplication in the field and ensure efficient coverage of the affected areas. The Health cluster is having weekly meetings, with some partners participating in the national coordination platforms. Since the declaration of the outbreak, WHO (Country Office, Regional Office for Africa (AFRO) and Headquarters (HQ) are providing direct technical and operational support to the country, and collaborating closely with partners, including partners in the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) to ensure rapid and effective international assistance to this outbreak response. WHO has classified the event as a Grade 2 emergency, based on its internal Emergency Response Framework. Accordingly, WHO has established its Incident Management System (IMS), as well as repurposed/mobilized internal and external resources. The regional emergency operations centres (EOC) are fully operational in five hotspots areas, including Antananarivo, Tamatave, Mahajunga, Fionarantsoa, and Fenerive. Other sub-national coordination capacities are being assessed, depending of the epidemiological situation.\n\nSurveillance, contact identification and follow-up:\nA total of 1800 community health workers in Antananarivo and 2632 from other affected regions are carrying out contact tracing activities, being supervised by 340 medical doctors and students. Surveillance activities at the points of entry (airports and ports) are being strengthened. Plans are underway to train community health workers to detect and investigate community deaths.\n\n2. Actions to date:\nLaboratory\nDiagnostic capacity for plague is provided at the Institut Pasteur de Madagascar (IPM). Since [Wed 27 Sep 2017], IPM distributed 2074 rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) to Toamasina (205), the Centers Hospitaliers d'Antananarivo (719) and the Plague Department of Ministry of Public Health (367).\n\nCase management\nUp to 9 plague treatment centres have been established, of which 6 are in Antananarivo. The treatment centres are supported by IFRC, MSF, MdM, UNICEF, and WHO. Treatment protocol has been updated to cover a large number of respiratory diseases.\n\nInfection prevention and control\nA total of 300 water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) specialists have been trained and are now working in hospitals. Training of healthcare workers on infection prevention and control (IPC) started on [Thu 19 Oct 2017], with 45 staff trained. The training will continue on [Fri 20 and Sat 21 Oct 2017].\n\nSocial mobilization, community engagement and risk communications\nA telephone line number 910, referred to as a green line, has been set up and is functional for reporting of alerts and rumours. The line is also used to request ambulance services. Journalists were trained on how and what to communicate about plague. Religious leaders have been engaged to disseminate appropriate preventive messages. A rumour-monitoring unit has been established, to inform development of health education messages for the public. A protocol for safe and dignified burials has been tested with success in the community in Antananarivo and Tamatave. Social mobilizers have joined contact tracing teams in order to reduce resistance from the community.\n\nLogistics\nA total of 1.2 million doses of antimicrobials have been delivered to the national authorities in the country. Coordination of partners is ongoing to map needs and ensure better distribution of resources. USAID has donated 18 000 respirator masks, 100 000 simple masks and 10 vehicles to support operations of the Department of Public Health.\n\nResources mobilization\nThe joint response plan between the Government of Madagascar and its partners has been adjusted to USD 9.5 million, in view of the multisectoral response to the urban plague outbreak. To date, WHO has provided US$ 1.5 million, UNICEF USD 500 000, the International Federation of the Red Cross USD 250 000, UNDP USD 300 000, and UNFPA USD 331 000. In addition, other organizations have provided assistance in kind: China has provided medicines worth USD 200 000.\n\nPartnership\nIn support of the Ministry of Public Health and the other national authorities, WHO and the GOARN partners deployed emergency response teams. By [Mon 16 Oct 2017], 114 experts (43 through WHO external recruitment, 17 CDC Polio Stop Team, 11 GOARN, and 43 internal WHO staff) have been deployed.\n\nWHO and the GOARN continue to mobilize partners to provide technical, personnel and logistical support to the country, and are working closely with the United Nations Clusters, stakeholders and donors to ensure appropriate support to the outbreak response.\n\nPreparedness/operations readiness\nA total of 9 countries and overseas territories have been identified as priority countries in the African region for plague preparedness and readiness by virtue of having trade and travel links to Madagascar. These countries and overseas territories include Comoros, Ethiopia, Kenya, Mauritius, Mozambique, La R\u00e9union (France), Seychelles, South Africa, and Tanzania. The key readiness actions being implemented in each priority country, in coordination and collaboration with major partners (UNICEF, CDC, ECDC, Red Cross/Red Crescent Societies etc.), include: Increasing public awareness on plague and enhancing surveillance for the disease particularly at points of entry, such as air and sea ports; Conducting specific contingency planning with all health sector partners; Prepositioning of equipment and supplies, including PPE, antibiotics, and other equipment required to safely identify plague cases. Providing in-country technical assistance in a range of areas, including surveillance, training on case detection, contact tracing, social mobilisation and risk communication. WHO has deployed 2 epidemiologists to support Seychelles to strengthen in-country preparedness and response to the probable cases. WHO is also deploying a risk communications expert to support the country. WHO is prepositioning equipment and supplies, including PPE, antibiotics and other equipment required to safely identify plague cases, in Comoros, Mauritius, Mozambique, Seychelles, and Tanzania.\n\nIHR Travel measures\nOn [Tue 3 Oct 2017], WHO issued advice for international travellers to Madagascar. As of [Sun 8 Oct 2017], WHO and Ministry of Public Health of Madagascar initiated measures at points of entry to avoid international spread of plague. At the International Airport in Antananarivo, these measures include: filling a departure form at the airport (to identify passengers at risk); temperature screening of departing passengers and referring passengers with fever to airport physicians for further consultation; passengers with symptoms compatible with pneumonic plague are immediately isolated at the airport and investigated via rapid diagnostic test, and notified under standard alert protocol. Search for contacts would be done locally and close contacts would be placed on prophylactic treatment. Symptomatic individuals are not allowed to travel. A WHO GOARN team (CDC and INVS/ SPF) is providing technical support at the airport to finalize the exit screen protocol with the airport and Points of Entry authorities, and to implement an evaluation of the exit screening protocol. Some of the neighbouring countries, namely Comoros, Mauritius and South Africa have put in place measures to protect their population, including entry screening, information provision to passengers on how to seek medical care in case of symptoms and other preparedness measures. On [Tue 17 Oct 2017], there were media reports of travel advisories being implemented by Ireland, Hong Kong and United Arab Emirates. Based on the available information to date, the risk of international spread of plague appears very low. WHO advises against any restriction on travel or trade on Madagascar based on the available information. International travellers arriving in Madagascar should be informed about the current plague outbreak and that plague is endemic in Madagascar (see WHO advice for travellers mentioned above). WHO has produced and shared with neighbouring countries a draft guidance note on International Health Regulation 2005 (IHR) requirements related to travel to support preparedness and readiness activities at points of entry, especially airports and seaports. On [Wed 11 Oct 2017], the Seychelles Ministry of Health announced (in a press release on its website) several measures against pneumonic plague. As many of these measures significantly interfere with international traffic, on [Fri 13 Oct 2017], the Ministry of Health informed WHO that it will provide the scientific evidence and public health rationale for these measures, as required by Article 43.3 of the International Health Regulations (IHR, 2005). http://www.who.int/ith/updates/20171003/en/\n\n3. Summary of public health risks, needs and gaps\nWhile progress has been made, the main focus at this stage is to strengthen effectiveness and coverage of outbreak control measures, including investigation of new cases and contact tracing, provision of outbreak response logistics, enhancing infection prevention and control to mitigate exposure of healthcare workers, vector control, and targeted operational research. Effective risk communication, social mobilization and community engagement are critical. In addition, preparedness and readiness in neighbouring regions and countries, including at the points of entry, should be enhanced. Proposed ways forward include:\n\n- Continue strengthening response operations at the community level, especially case detection and referral.\n- Providing adequate supplies of personal protective equipment and rapid diagnostic test kits at operational level.\n- Improving community-based surveillance systems to facilitate early detection of cases.\n- Enhance risk communication and social mobilization through the various communication channels.\n- Continue with preparedness and readiness activities in the high risk countries.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The plague epidemic in Madagascar continues to grow dramatically with a majority of cases being pneumonic plague which is easily passed from person-to-person and has involved healthcare workers as well.\n\nDate / Cases / Deaths / Average new cases per day\n-------------------------------------------------\n14 Sep 2017 / 28 / 5\n30 Sep 2017 / 73 / 17 / 3\n3 Oct 2017 / 194 / 30 / 40\n5 Oct 2017 / 258 / 36 / 32\n7 Oct 2017 / 343 / 42 / 43\n8 Oct 2017 / 387 / 45 / 44\n9 Oct 2017 / 449 / 48 / 62\n10 Oct 2017 / 500 / 54 / 51\n11 Oct 2017 / 561 / 57 / 61\n13 Oct 2017 / 684 / 57 / 61\n16 Oct 2017 / 805 / 74 / 40\n17 Oct 2017 / 878 / 80 / 44\n18 Oct 2017 / 1032 / 89 / 164\n19 Oct 2017 / 1153 / 94 / 121\n20 Oct 2017 / 1297 / 102 / 144\n\nWith close to 65 percent of the cases diagnosed as pneumonic plague, the case fatality rate of about 8 percent seems quite low.\n\nThe latest global statistics on plague 2010-2015 (http://www.who.int/wer/2016/wer9108.pdf?ua=1)\nYear / 2010 / 2011 / 2012 / 2013 / 2014 / 2015\nTotal (deaths) / 534 (50) / 573 (116) / 427 (81) / 772 (130) / 622 (130) / 320 (77)\nOver the past 2+months, the number of plague cases in Madagascar is more than the worldwide total of cases from 2014 and 2015 combined and it is early in the season for plague in Madagascar. - Mod.LL\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/181.]", "summary": "Sep 2017 / 73 / 17 / 3\n3 Oct 2017 / 194 / 30 / 40\n5 Oct 2017 / 258 / 36 / 32\n7 Oct 2017 / 343 / 42 / 43\n8 Oct 2017 / 387 / 45 / 44\n9 Oct 2017 / 449 / 48 / 62\n10 Oct 2017 / 500 / 54 / 51\n11 Oct 2017 / 561 / 57 / 61\n13 Oct 2017 / 684 / 57 / 61\n16 Oct 2017 / 805 / 74 / 40\n17 Oct 2017 / 878 / 80 / 44\n18 Oct 2017 / 1032 / 89 / 164\n19 Oct 2017 / 1153 / 94 / 121\n20 Oct 2017 / 1297 / 102 / 144\n\nWith close to 65 percent of the cases diagnosed as pneumonic plague, the case fatality rate of about 8 percent seems quite low.

These strategies include (i) coordination of the response, (ii) enhanced surveillance, (iii) laboratory confirmation, (iv) contact identification and follow-up, (v) case management, (vi) infection prevention and control, (vii) safe and dignified burials, (viii) social mobilization and community engagement, (ix) logistics, (x) risk communication, (xi) vector control, (xii) partner engagement, (xiii) research and (xiv) resource mobilization. While progress has been made, the main focus at this stage is to strengthen effectiveness and coverage of outbreak control measures, including investigation of new cases and contact tracing, provision of outbreak response logistics, enhancing infection prevention and control to mitigate exposure of healthcare workers, vector control, and targeted operational research. \n\nStrategic approach to the prevention, detection and control of plague:\n\nWHO recommends the implementation of proven strategies for the prevention and control of plague. Since the declaration of the outbreak, WHO (Country Office, Regional Office for Africa (AFRO) and Headquarters (HQ) are providing direct technical and operational support to the country, and collaborating closely with partners, including partners in the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) to ensure rapid and effective international assistance to this outbreak response. At the International Airport in Antananarivo, these measures include: filling a departure form at the airport (to identify passengers at risk); temperature screening of departing passengers and referring passengers with fever to airport physicians for further consultation; passengers with symptoms compatible with pneumonic plague are immediately isolated at the airport and investigated via rapid diagnostic test, and notified under standard alert protocol. Actions to date:\nLaboratory\nDiagnostic capacity for plague is provided at the Institut Pasteur de Madagascar (IPM). Situation update:\nMadagascar has been experiencing a large outbreak of plague affecting major cities and other non-endemic areas since August 2017. promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The plague epidemic in Madagascar continues to grow dramatically with a majority of cases being pneumonic plague which is easily passed from person-to-person and has involved healthcare workers as well. \n\nAs this is a rapidly changing situation, the reported number of cases and deaths, contacts being monitored and the laboratory results are subject to change due to enhanced surveillance, contact tracing activities, ongoing laboratory investigations, reclassification, and case, contact and laboratory data consolidation. PLAGUE - MADAGASCAR (24): FATAL\n*******************************\n The plague season began earlier this year [2017] and the current outbreak is predominantly pneumonic and is affecting non-endemic areas including major urban centres such as Antananarivo (the capital city) and Toamasina (the port city). This risk is mitigated by the short incubation period of pneumonic plague, implementation of exit screening measures in Madagascar and scaling up of preparedness and operational readiness activities in neighbouring Indian Ocean islands and other southern and east African countries. \n\nSocial mobilization, community engagement and risk communications\n Between one August and 19 October 2017, a total of 1297 cases (suspected, probable and confirmed) including 102 deaths (case fatality rate 7.9 percent) have been reported. \n\nWHO and the GOARN continue to mobilize partners to provide technical, personnel and logistical support to the country, and are working closely with the United Nations Clusters, stakeholders and donors to ensure appropriate support to the outbreak response. \n\nA high level coordination forum to provide strategic and policy directions to the plague outbreak response has been established, chaired by the Prime Minister. As of [Sun 8 Oct 2017], WHO and Ministry of Public Health of Madagascar initiated measures at points of entry to avoid international spread of plague. While the current outbreak began with one large epidemiologically linked cluster, cases of pneumonic plague without apparent epidemiologic links have since been detected in regions across Madagascar, including the densely populated cities of Antananarivo and Toamasina. As many of these measures significantly interfere with international traffic, on [Fri 13 Oct 2017], the Ministry of Health informed WHO that it will provide the scientific evidence and public health rationale for these measures, as required by Article 43.3 of the International Health Regulations (IHR, 2005).

The government has deployed resources to curb the disease, but many obstacles remain. As plague cases rose last week [week of 9 Oct 2017] in Madagascar's capital, many city dwellers panicked. They waited in long lines for antimicrobials at pharmacies and reached through bus windows to buy masks from street vendors. Schools have been canceled, and public gatherings are banned. For the 1st time, the disease long seen in the country's remote areas is largely concentrated in its 2 largest cities, Antananarivo and Toamasina.\n\nGlobal health officials have responded quickly. The WHO, criticized for its slow response to the 2014 Ebola epidemic in West Africa, has released USD 1.5 million and sent plague specialists and epidemiologists. The Red Cross is sending its 1st-ever plague treatment center to Madagascar.\n\nOn [Wed 11 Oct 2017], Madagascar's minister of public health rallied doctors and paramedics in a packed auditorium at the country's main hospital, saying they're not allowed to go on vacation. 'Let's be strong, because it's only us. We're at the front, like the military,' Mamy Lalatiana Andriamanarivo said. The outbreak could continue until the end of infection season in April [2018], experts warn.\n\nMadagascar has about 400 plague cases per year, or more than half of the world's total, according to a 2016 WHO report. Usually, they are cases of bubonic plague in the rural highlands. Bubonic plague is carried by rats and spread to humans through flea bites. It is fatal about the half the time, if untreated. Most of the cases in the current outbreak are pneumonic plague, a more virulent form that spreads through coughing, sneezing, or spitting and is almost always fatal if untreated. In some cases, it can kill within 24 hours. Like the bubonic form, it can be treated with common antimicrobials if caught in time.\n\nThe WHO calls plague a 'disease of poverty' caused in part by unsanitary living conditions. Madagascar has a per capita GDP of about USD 400, and national programs to control the disease have been 'hampered by operational and management difficulties', according to a report by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. But the airborne pneumonic plague, which accounts for about 75 percent of cases in the current outbreak, makes no class distinctions. 'Normally, the people who catch the plague are dirty people who live in poor areas, but in this case we find the well-to-do, the directors, the professors, people in every place in society, catching the disease,' said Dr Manitra Rakotoarivony, Madagascar's director of health promotion.\n\nThe current outbreak began in August 2017, earlier than usual, when a 31-year-old man who had spent time in a village in the central highlands, Ankazobe [Analamanga region], travelled by bush taxi to the east coast, unaware that he had the plague. He died en route and was buried without any safety precautions in Toamasina. 4 people in contact with him also died.\n\nResidents of the capital began to relax in recent days amid the global response to the outbreak, but the disease remains a serious threat with the number of new cases per day remaining steady.\n\nMadagascar has fought the disease for more than a century. It was introduced to the island in 1898 when steamships from India brought rats infected with the bacteria that cause the disease. The plague nearly disappeared from Madagascar for 60 years, starting in 1930, but re-emerged in recent decades.\n\nWhile the WHO says the risk of the epidemic spreading beyond the region is very low and does not advise restrictions on travel to Madagascar.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The rapid rise of cases of _Yersinia pestis_ infection with a predominance of pneumonic plague is quite worrisome.\n\nDate / Cases / Deaths / Average new cases per day\n-------------------------------------------------\n14 Sep 2017 / 28 / 5\n30 Sep 2017 / 73 / 17 / 3\n3 Oct 2017 / 194 / 30 / 40\n5 Oct 2017 / 258 / 36 / 32\n7 Oct 2017 / 343 / 42 / 43\n8 Oct 2017 / 387 / 45 / 44\n9 Oct 2017 / 449 / 48 / 62\n10 Oct 2017 / 500 / 54 / 51\n11 Oct 2017 / 561 / 57 / 61\n13 Oct 2017 / 684 / 57 / 61\n16 Oct 2017 / 805 / 74 / 40\n\nCases and deaths of plague reported by the WHO for Madagascar 2010-2015 (http://www.who.int/wer/2016/wer9108.pdf):\nYear / 2010 / 2011 / 2012 / 2013 / 2014 / 2015\nCases 324 / 392 / 256 / 675 / 482 / 275\nDeaths / 30 / 93 / 60 / 118 / 112 / 63\n- Mod.LL\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/181.]", "summary": "Sep 2017 / 73 / 17 / 3\n3 Oct 2017 / 194 / 30 / 40\n5 Oct 2017 / 258 / 36 / 32\n7 Oct 2017 / 343 / 42 / 43\n8 Oct 2017 / 387 / 45 / 44\n9 Oct 2017 / 449 / 48 / 62\n10 Oct 2017 / 500 / 54 / 51\n11 Oct 2017 / 561 / 57 / 61\n13 Oct 2017 / 684 / 57 / 61\n16 Oct 2017 / 805 / 74 / 40\n\nCases and deaths of plague reported by the WHO for Madagascar 2010-2015 (http://www.who.int/wer/2016/wer9108.pdf):\nYear / 2010 / 2011 / 2012 / 2013 / 2014 / 2015\n A ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n Date: Tue 17 Oct 2017\nSource: France24 [edited]\nhttp://www.france24.com/en/20171017-madagascar-plague-seychelles-health-disease\n\n\nA plague outbreak in Madagascar has killed at least 74 people and 805 cases have been reported so far. \n\nThe current outbreak began in August 2017, earlier than usual, when a 31-year-old man who had spent time in a village in the central highlands, Ankazobe [Analamanga region], travelled by bush taxi to the east coast, unaware that he had the plague.

Also, health officials in Seychelles are closely monitoring 11 people in hospital isolation, a step that follows the announcement 3 days ago of a probable imported case in a man who had traveled to Madagascar.\n\nOf Madagascar's new cases, 197 are pneumonic, putting that total at 474. 12 more deaths have been reported, lifting that number to 57. The WHO said the latest totals reflect an overall reduction in the case-fatality rate, which over the past few days has dropped from 11.6% to 8.3%.\n\nIllnesses have now been reported in 35 of Madagascar's 114 districts, 8 more since the previous update, the WHO said. The hardest-hit area is Antananarivo Renivohitra District, a large urban area surrounding the country's capital.\n\nOf the 684 cases, 63 are confirmed, 271 are probable, and 350 are suspected. In addition to the 474 pneumonic cases, 156 are bubonic, 1 is septicemic, and 54 are unspecified. So far 11 _Yersinia pestis_ strains have been isolated, and tests show that all are sensitive to antimicrobials recommended for treatment.\n\nThe WHO has said that the overall threat of disease spread within Madagascar is high, while the regional risk is moderate, and the overall global risk is low. Madagascar and its global health partners have scaled up surveillance and contact tracing, and the Pasteur Institute has sent 1918 rapid diagnostic tests to outbreak hot spots and to the health ministry.\n\nThe International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) announced on 13 Oct 2017 that it is deploying its 1st-ever plague treatment center in Madagascar. It said the 50-bed facility will include a full medical team, using national health staff to isolate and treat patients sick with plague. It is also releasing about USD 1 million from its disaster relief emergency fund to scale up the local Red Cross medical treatment capacity. Fatoumata Nafo-Traore, MD, IFRC regional director for Africa, said in a statement: 'Our past experience in outbreak response had underlined the importance of responding quickly and effectively.'\n\nMedicine du Monde is setting up 5 isolation and treatment centers, and Doctors without Borders has deployed 70 people to help support the response in Toamasina, another hot spot that is also Madagascar's main seaport. The WHO has delivered personal protective equipment (PPE) and antimicrobials, and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) has donated PPE and vehicles to help the country's health officials.\n\nIn a Facebook update, the Seychelles Ministry of Health (MOH) said there have been a few more hospital admissions linked directly or indirectly to the initial probable case. One is a foreign national who had not had contact with any other known cases and presented with fever and mild respiratory symptoms on 10 Oct 2017, which prompted isolation. The rapid screening test was weakly positive for plague, but the finding hasn't been confirmed yet by the Pasteur Institute.\n\nYesterday, 12 Oct 2017, a 26-year-old woman was transferred to the hospital with symptoms, where she was isolated and put on antimicrobials while testing is underway. The ministry said a total of 12 people have been admitted and are receiving treatment as a precaution. One is a child who may have had contact with some children at a school, and health officials will offer the students antimicrobial prophylaxis. The MOH said all of the patients, apart from the index case, are stable and are on treatment with no respiratory distress. More than 320 people who had contact with the imported probable case have been prescribed antimicrobial prophylaxis.\n\nEarlier this week, Air Seychelles cancelled all flights to and from Madagascar, and health officials there are isolating everyone entering from Madagascar and are temporarily advising against travel to Madagascar. The WHO has said it advises against any restriction on travel or trade to Madagascar, is aware of the Seychelles measure restricting travel from Madagascar, and is in contact with authorities to confirm the information and learn the public health rationale and scientific evidence, based on the International Health Regulations.\n\n[Byline: Lisa Schnirring]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The rapid rise of cases of _Yersinia pestis_ infection with a predominance of pneumonic plague is quite worrisome.\n\nDate / Cases / Deaths\n---------------------\n14 Sep 2017 / 28 / 5\n30 Sep 2017 / 73 / 17\n3 Oct 2017 / 194 / 30\n5 Oct 2017 / 258 / 36\n7 Oct 2017 / 343 / 42\n8 Oct 2017 / 387 / 45\n9 Oct 2017 / 449 / 48\n10 Oct 2017 / 500 / 54\n11 Oct 2017 / 561 / 57\n13 Oct 2017 / 684 / 57\n\nCases and deaths of plague reported by the WHO for Madagascar 2010-2015 http://www.who.int/wer/2016/wer9108.pdf?ua=1:\n\nYear / 2010 / 2011 / 2012 / 2013 / 2014/ 2015\nCases 324 / 392 / 256 / 675 / 482 / 275\nDeaths / 30 / 93 / 60 / 118 / 112 / 63\n\nThe Seychelles portion of the post confirms yesterday's [13 Oct 2017] post, but it remains unclear whether additional imported cases of _Y. pestis_ infection have occurred and if local transmission has occurred there. - Mod.LL\n\nProMED-mail HealthMaps:\nMadagascar: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/181\nSeychelles: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/183]", "summary": "Sep 2017 / 73 / 17\n3 Oct 2017 / 194 / 30\n5 Oct 2017 / 258 / 36\n7 Oct 2017 / 343 / 42\n8 Oct 2017 / 387 / 45\n9 Oct 2017 / 449 / 48\n10 Oct 2017 / 500 / 54\n 11 Oct 2017 / 561 / 57\n13 Oct 2017 / 684 / 57\n\nCases and deaths of plague reported by the WHO for Madagascar 2010-2015 http://www.who.int/wer/2016/wer9108.pdf?ua=1:\n\nYear / 2010 / 2011 / 2012 / 2013 / 2014/ 2015\n A ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n The World Health Organization (WHO) said today [13 Oct 2017] in an update on Madagascar's plague outbreak that the number of infections as of 12 Oct 2017 has climbed to 684, an increase of 297 cases since its last update on 9 Oct 2017.

Adam was called to the National Assembly after the 1st case of pneumonic plague in Seychelles was confirmed on Tue 10 Oct 2017. The patient is a man who returned to Mahe, the main island, last [Fri 6 Oct 2017], on board the last Air Seychelles flight from Madagascar.\n\nThe health minister also confirmed that 258 people are currently under observation and receiving treatment after the case of pneumonic plague was detected. 'The 258 includes 41 passengers and 7 crew from the flight, 12 close family members, and 18 staff and patients from the Anse Boileau health centre where the man went when he fell ill.'\n\nThe man disobeyed instructions given upon his arrival to remain at home for a period of time and attended a party that same evening. The minister explained that the result of the tests conducted on the infected man was sent to the Pasteur Institute in Paris, which confirmed the pneumonic plague.\n\nAdam said that 'all the 170 people who were at the party including the 13 staff working at the venue are also under passive surveillance. We were already putting Seychellois and tourists under active observation at their homes or at hotels. But as from today [11 Oct 2017], all those arriving from Madagascar will be put in isolation for 6 days,' the Minister said.\n\nAdam added that the authority will be using the Seychelles Coast Guard military academy as the isolation centre located at Perseverance, a reclaimed island on the outskirts of Victoria.\n\nThe national airline -- Air Seychelles -- had suspended all flights to Madagascar, following guidance and requests of the Seychelles' Public Health Authority amid concerns over the outbreak of the plague in Madagascar. To date, there are 449 cases confirmed in Madagascar and 48 people have died [now 500 cases and 54 deaths - Mod.LL]. Air Seychelles is the only airline in the region to suspend all its flights to the island.\n\nThe health ministry has also liaised with the Seychelles Fishing Authority to get fishermen who may have travelled to Madagascar recently to report their trips and if necessary to seek advice from health professionals. 'We are also in contacts with boats, and we want to urge those who may have travelled to Madagascar informally to stop this practice and to report to their nearest health centres.' Adam said this is important for assessment and also 'for us to decide if they need to be placed under surveillance for treatment. We are also liaising with travel agents to discourage people from visiting the island.'\n\nSeychelles, a group of 115 islands in the western Indian Ocean, is on high alert ever since it was confirmed that a Seychellois basketball coach, who died in a hospital in Madagascar in September 2017, had contracted the plague.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n[Seychelles seems to have responded in appropriate ways related to the single importation (so far) of a person who developed pneumonic plague after returning from Madagascar.

Since the last report on [Wed 4 Oct 2017], a total of 230 new suspected cases including 17 deaths (case fatality rate 7.4 percent) were reported. Between 1 Aug 2017 and 8 Oct 2017, a total of 387 cases (suspected, probable and confirmed) including 45 deaths (case fatality rate 11.6 percent) have been reported from 27 out of 114 districts in the country. Of these, 277 cases (71.6 percent) had the pneumonic form of the disease, 106 were bubonic plague, one case was septicemia plague, and 3 cases were unspecified. Of 279 cases reported to the Central Plague Laboratory of the Institut Pasteur of Madagascar, 38 were confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), 113 were classified as probable cases after testing positive on rapid diagnostic tests (RDT) and 123 remain suspected cases, pending results.

The man who traveled to Madagascar, arrived in Seychelles on [Fri 6 Oct 2017], at which point he was placed under passive surveillance.\n\n'He presented with symptoms yesterday, [Mon 9 Oct 2017]. He was not feeling well and reported to a health center. Because he was under surveillance, he was immediately put in isolation at the Seychelles Hospital,' Dr Gedeon said. Several tests were done, some of which had normal results. 'We also conducted a rapid plague test which produced a weakly positive result,' Dr Gedeon added. Following this, the result was sent to L'institut Pasteur in France for cross-checking, at which point it was confirmed to be a positive plague result.\n\nThe man has been immediately given antimicrobial treatment and all people who came into direct contact with him have also been put under active surveillance. These include his partner who also presented with symptoms today [Tue 10 Oct 2017], but has not been confirmed to be infected, and a child who resides with them.\n\nDr Gedeon has reassured that there is no reason to panic and that the Public Health Authority is continuing to enforce measures to prevent an outbreak within the country. 'We continue to monitor passengers who enter the country from Madagascar. There are currently 42 people who are under passive surveillance,' he stated. Moreover, 15 people who have been identified to have come into contact with the man have also been put on antimicrobial treatment to prevent infection.\n\n'Plague can easily be treated with antimicrobials when detected early. And, our objective is to have early diagnosis and identification of points of contact, so we can administer treatment early,' Dr Gedeon further added with regards to strategies being implemented by the Ministry of Health.\n\nAt the moment, Air Seychelles has cancelled all flights to and from Madagascar as a further preventative measure.

He said this during an interview with the media today [Tue 10 Oct 2017]. The new unit will be temporarily located on the 2nd floor of the Seychelles Hospital on Hermitte Ward. The Hermitte Ward is being moved to the antenatal ward. Thus, the 2 maternity wards will be merged until further notice.\n\nThis measure is being taken by the Ministry of Health in the event that more cases of plague are diagnosed. 'We need to provide a facility for patients who will be put under isolation and the best place to properly do this is Hermitte Ward,' Dr Louange explained. 'The unit requires 2 separate sections and Hermitte ward already allows for this to be done. In addition it has 2 different doorways.' This will permit staff to have different entrances based on their stations.\n\nIt is important that people with symptoms of plague are put in the correct environment. They need to be in a facility where they can get the right care and treatment.

Primary pneumonic plague arises as a result of inhalation of plague bacilli in infectious aerosols, such as would be produced when there are 2ary pneumonic complications in bubonic/septicemic plague.\n\nPrimary plague pneumonia has a short incubation period of 1-3 days, after which there is sudden onset of flu-like symptoms including fever, chills, headache, generalized body pains, weakness and chest discomfort. A cough develops with sputum production, which may be bloody, and increasing chest pain and difficulty in breathing. As the disease progresses, hypoxia (low oxygen concentration in the blood) and hemoptysis (coughing up blood) are prominent. The disease is invariably fatal unless antimicrobial therapy commences within 24 hours of onset of symptoms.\n\nPatients with primary pneumonic plague generate large quantities of infectious aerosols that pose a significant risk to close contacts. CDC guidelines identify contacts within 2 meters [6.6 feet] as being at greatest risk and do not consider the organism likely to be carried through air ducts or vents. Persons who have been in contact with pneumonic plague patients or handling potentially infectious body fluids or tissues without appropriate protection should receive preventive antimicrobial therapy. The preferred antimicrobial agents for prophylaxis are tetracyclines, quinolones, or chloramphenicol.\n\nSeychelles, officially the Republic of Seychelles, is an archipelago and country in the Indian Ocean.

The government had already prohibited crowds from gathering in order to curb the further spread of the dangerous disease that had sickened 343 people as of [Sun 8 Oct 2017], according to Health Ministry figures. On [Fri 6 Oct 2017], the ministry put the death toll at 36, with 250 sickened.\n\n'In the heavily populated capital, Antananarivo, 142 people have been infected. Schools in the affected cities of Antananarivo, Toamasina and other regions have been closed for a week,' the health ministry said. Outbreaks of bubonic plague are common in Madagascar, which lies off Africa's southeastern coast, but the most recent outbreak has included cases of the more serious pneumonic form of plague. About 400 cases of plague are reported in Madagascar every year, most of them bubonic, which is transmitted by fleas. The much rarer pneumonic strain of the disease that is spread person-to-person is fatal unless treated within 24 hours.\n\nThe WHO said it had delivered 1.4 million doses of antimicrobials to Madagascar in view of the plague. With this up to 5000 infected people can be treated and 100 000 can be given a prophylaxis. With early diagnosis, the chances of recovery are good,' said WHO.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[2] Exportations\nDate: Sat 7 Oct 2017\nSource: UPI [edited]\nhttps://www.upi.com/Top_News/World-News/2017/10/07/WHO-acting-to-contain-Madagascar-plague-outbreak/9891507406347/\n\n\nThe WHO issued a warning about a worrisome outbreak of plague on the African island of Madagascar that has caused 200 infections and 33 deaths since September 2017 [as above, now 343 and 42 - Mod.LL].\n\nThe outbreak of plague is an annual occurrence in Madagascar, which normally reports about 400 cases per year, usually in the remote island highlands. What makes this outbreak different, according to the WHO, is that many of the infected live in more densely populated towns and the capital Antananarivo. Also, the infections reported are pneumatic plague, which is transmitted through the air, making it much more difficult to control.\n\nPneumatic plague is different from bubonic plague, which is the more common form on Madagascar. Bubonic plague is transmitted when an infected individual is bitten by fleas carried by rats. On Madagascar, the outbreaks are more common in rural rice farming areas and are not as easily transmitted. Both versions of the plague were the cause of the Black Death epidemic in the mid-14th century, which wiped out a 3rd of Europe's population.\n\nIn response to the threat, Madagascar's government has closed schools, businesses and outlawed large public gatherings including concerts and sporting events where the disease could be spread to dozens or even hundreds of people at a time.\n\nThe disease is already confirmed to have left the island after several participants in an international basketball tournament displayed symptoms after arriving home. One coach from the Indian Ocean island nation Seychelles died and another from South Africa was diagnosed but survived. Other tournament participants are being monitored for symptoms.\n\nThe outbreak is similar in some respects to the deadly Ebola outbreak that ravaged parts of west Africa in 2014. Similar to Madagascar's outbreak, a single individual infected in an isolated area traveled to a population center, sparking a deadly outbreak.\n\n[Byline: Eric DuVall]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The case count is growing.

As of [Fri 6 Oct 2017], 258 have been sickened and 36 have died just since August 2017, according to Madagascar's Ministry of Public Health. To try to stifle the spread, the government has forbidden public gatherings, including sporting events, and schools have closed for insecticide treatments that kill plague-spreading fleas. People have swarmed pharmacies, desperately seeking face masks and any antibiotics they can get. The WHO on [Fri 6 Oct 2017], announced that it has released 1.5 million [USD] in emergency funds and delivered nearly 1.2 million antimicrobial doses to help combat the outbreak.\n\nPlague, caused by the bacterium _Yersinia pestis_, is endemic to Madagascar and pops up all year-round. But outbreaks can erupt between September to November, with seasonal shifts in rat and flea populations. Rats, which harbor the bacteria, tend to see their populations plump and peak around harvest times in July and August. A boom in the flea population, which transmits the disease, follows in tandem. But as crops are harvested and the weather cools, the rat population shrinks, and the surging, hungry batch of fleas turns to humans.\n\nThe island has been battling the disease since it arrived there on steamboats from India in 1898. (The disease still appears in many countries around the world, including the USA, but most epidemics occur in African countries.) Madagascar got a handle on its seasonal outbreaks during the 1950s with the help of antibiotics, insecticides, and better hygiene campaigns. But it lost its grip in the 1990s when it started seeing increases in case counts. In recent years, the country has tallied between 275 and 675 cases annually.\n\nBut this year [2017] is different. The disease is spreading not just in rural, agricultural areas; it's also spreading in cities. As of [Sat 30 Sep 2017], the disease had taken hold in 10 cities across the island, including the capital, Antananarivo.\n\n'WHO is concerned that plague could spread further because it is already present in several cities and this is the start of the epidemic season, which usually runs from September to April,' Dr. Charlotte Ndiaye, WHO representative in Madagascar, said in a recent statement.\n\nIt is also spreading in 2 different ways--by fleas and by people--which some have dubbed a 'double plague.' Usually, plague infections arise as bubonic plague, spread by flea bites. In this case--the Black Death scenario--_Y. pestis_ moves from the site of a flea bite on a human to the lymphatic system, taking up residence and inflaming a lymph node. This causes a painful swelling called a bubo, where the infection gets its name. If it is left untreated, the infection can spread to the blood, causing septicaemic plague, or the lungs, causing pneumonic plague.\n\nPneumonic plague is the most severe form. It can become a life-threatening situation in just 24 hours and can begin to spread from person to person in droplets, coughed or sneezed. Most of the people infected in the current outbreak in Madagascar have the pneumonic form.\n\nAuthorities suspect that the outbreak kicked off when a 31-year-old man from the coastal city of Tamatave visited the Ankazobe District in the Central Highlands. On [Sun 27 Aug 2017] during his visit, he developed what he thought were malaria symptoms. Four days later, he was showing respiratory symptoms while taking a shared, public taxi on the way home. He died during the journey, and his body was prepared for burial, without safety precautions, in the Moramanga District Hospital, which was along the way. Health officials linked his case to 31 others, 4 of which resulted in death.\n\nOfficials caught on to the outbreak on [Mon 11 Sep 2017], and cases have piled up since then. People all over the island are spooked by the deadly and fast-spreading pneumonic version of the disease. Lines of people have been appearing at local pharmacies before dawn. They hope to get a face-mask and/or antibiotics, which are now in short supply and expensive.\n\nA 50-year-old resident of Antananarivo, told the Agence France-Presse on [Wed 4 Oct 2017], that he and his wife were alarmed by the current outbreak. 'I'd already visited 6 [pharmacies] this morning and at each one they told me that they didn't have any more masks,' he said. He again left empty-handed.\n\nLocal health authorities have been trying to calm residents, telling them that face masks aren't necessary and that the plague can be treated.\n\n'Plague is curable if detected in time. Our teams are working to ensure that everyone at risk has access to protection and treatment. The faster we move, the more lives we save,' WHO's Dr. Ndiaye said.\n\n[Byline: Beth Mole]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Primary pneumonic plague (one percent of natural plague presentations) arises as a result of inhalation of plague bacilli in infectious aerosols, such as would be produced when there are secondary pneumonic complications in bubonic/septicemic plague.\n\nPrimary plague pneumonia has a short incubation period of 1-3 days, after which there is sudden onset of flu-like symptoms including fever, chills, headache, generalized body pains, weakness and chest discomfort. A cough develops with sputum production, which may be bloody, and increasing chest pain and difficulty in breathing. As the disease progresses, hypoxia (low oxygen concentration in the blood) and hemoptysis (coughing up blood) are prominent. The disease is invariably fatal unless antimicrobial therapy commences within 24 hours of exposure.\n\nPatients with primary pneumonic plague generate large quantities of infectious aerosols that pose a significant risk to close contacts. CDC guidelines identify contacts within 2 meters [6.6 feet] as being at greatest risk and do not consider the organism likely to be carried through air ducts or vents. Persons who have been in contact with pneumonic plague patients or handling potentially infectious body fluids or tissues without appropriate protection should receive preventive antimicrobial therapy. The preferred antimicrobial agents for prophylaxis are tetracyclines, quinolones, or chloramphenicol. - Mod.LL\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/181.]", "summary": "promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Primary pneumonic plague (one percent of natural plague presentations) arises as a result of inhalation of plague bacilli in infectious aerosols, such as would be produced when there are secondary pneumonic complications in bubonic/septicemic plague.

In addition, the death count has grown to 48.\n\nA breakdown of the types of plague reported is as follows: Pneumonic or pulmonary plague (322), bubonic (123) and septicemic (1). A total of 3 other cases are classified as suspect as of today, [Tue 10 Oct 2017].\n\nIn the capital city of Antananarivo, 239 cases and 21 deaths have been reported.

It is highly communicable under appropriate climate conditions, overcrowding and cool temperatures.

Although bubonic plague occurs nearly every year in Madagascar, an unusual outbreak of plague pneumonia is occurring in geographically widespread areas, including in heavily populated cities of Antananarivo (the capital city and its suburbs) and Toamasina (the most affected districts and cities include Antananarivo, the capital city, and its suburbs, Toamasina, and the rural district of Faratsiho; cases have also been reported in Ambatondrazaka, Ambohidratrimo, Andramasina, Ankazobe, Anosibe An'ala, Anta-Atsimondrano, Anta-Avaradrano, Anta-Renivohitra, Arivonimamo, Faratsiho, Maevatanana, Mahajanga I, Miarinarivo, Moramanga, Toamasina I, Toamasina II, Tsiroanomandidy, Voh\u00e9mar, and Ambalavao). New cases continue to be reported; as of [10 Oct 2017], 322 of the cases are plague pneumonia (which can be spread from person to person) and 123 are bubonic plague (which is spread through flea bites).\n\nIn response to the outbreak, the local government is working to control fleas and is canceling mass gatherings because plague pneumonia can be spread from person to person in close contact.\n\nWhat is plague?\n---------------\nPlague is a bacterial infection that is usually spread through bites by infected fleas. When acquired by flea bite, plague has symptoms of high fever and swollen and tender lymph nodes (bubonic plague) that occur 2-6 days after the bite. If it is not treated, the infection can spread to the lungs and cause pneumonia. In rare but serious cases, a person with plague pneumonia can spread the infection directly to others by coughing the plague bacteria into the air (more information [link in the URL]). The current outbreak is unusual in that most cases are plague pneumonia. Plague can be treated with antibiotics; however, without prompt treatment, plague can cause serious illness or death.\n\nHow can travelers protect themselves?\n-------------------------------------\nBased on available information, the risk to travelers appears to be very low; however, travelers have been infected, and one died. Travelers to Madagascar should use insect repellent to prevent flea bites and avoid close contact with sick or dead animals. Travelers should also avoid close contact with ill people, especially those with cough or pneumonia.\n\nNo vaccine is available to prevent plague. Plague can be prevented with antimicrobials. Travelers who have had close contact with people with plague pneumonia or other high-risk exposures should immediately notify a health care provider. They may need to take antimicrobials to prevent plague. During or after travel to Madagascar, travelers should be alert for symptoms of plague, and if they appear, seek medical care and inform the provider about their travel to Madagascar.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The rapid rise of cases with a predominance of pneumonic plague as well as infection in health care workers are both very worrisome.\n\nDate / Cases / Deaths\n---------------------\n14 Sep 2017 / 28 / 5\n30 Sep 2017 / 73 / 17\n3 Oct 2017 / 194 / 30\n5 Oct 2017 / 258 / 36\n7 Oct 2017 / 343 / 42\n8 Oct 2017 / 387 / 45\n9 Oct 2017 / 449 / 48\n\nIt is frightening to monitor substantial outbreaks of infectious diseases in 2017.

'We have recorded 194 suspected cases of plague, including 30 deaths,' health official Manitra Rakotoarivony said in a statement, updating the death toll from 25. Madagascar has a history of plague outbreaks almost every year since 1980, often sparked by rats fleeing forest fires.\n\nThe current outbreak is unusual as it has affected urban areas, increasing the risk of transmission, said the WHO. The government has banned public gatherings in the capital Antananarivo in a bid to slow the disease's spread. The outbreak has caused widespread panic, with long queues forming outside pharmacies to buy masks.\n\nTrying to reassure Madagascans, WHO official Charlotte Ndiaye said: 'It is as if the plague is the end of the world... but it is a disease like any other. We are lucky that treatment is available for this disease and it is free.'\n\nThe outbreak combines bubonic plague, which is spread by infected rats via flea bites, and pneumonic plague, spread from person to person.

The number of cases of pneumonic plague and the presence of _Yersinia pestis_ in nonendemic areas is of concern.\n\nPlague is caused by the _Yersinia pestis_ bacillus, carried by rat fleas. At the start of the rainy season, currently, rats flee the sewers of Madagascar in massive numbers and take refuge in people's cottages. Care must be taken in any rodent eradication program to ensure that a flea-killing compound is part of the plan. Just as in a natural rodent die-off from _Y. pestis_, the fleas will seek alternate hosts, that is, humans.\n\nThe following paragraph is from 1998 (Chanteau S, Ratsifasoamanana L, Rasoamanana B, et al: Plague, a reemerging disease in Madagascar. Emerg Infect Dis. 1998;4(1):101-4, PMID: 9452403; available at http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/4/1/98-0114_article.htm).\n\n'Between 1930 and 1990, bubonic plague had 'virtually disappeared' on the island due to efficient pest-control and good health management. However since 1990, an annual 200 cases are being reported and bubonic plague takes on epidemic form, especially in the port of Mahajanga, each year. In the capital city of Antananarivo, more cases are also being notified each year since 1990. Madagascar (pop. 13 million) has accounted for 45 percent of all the cases of plague in Africa.'\n\nFatalities related to plague usually are caused by spread of the organism from the bubo (the very painful infected lymph node which drains the area where the flea bite occurred) to the bloodstream. The bacteremia can cause a coagulopathy, producing the purpura seen in the 'black plague' and also spread to the lungs causing a hemorrhagic pneumonia. It is the pneumonia that can facilitate person-to-person transmission.\n\nMadagascar was the location of the isolation of multi-antimicrobial resistant _Y. pestis_ in 1995 (Galimand M, Guiyoule A, Gerbaud G, et al: Multidrug resistance in _Yersinia pestis_ mediated by a transferable plasmid.

The strain was resistant to chloramphenicol, streptomycin, and tetracycline but sensitive to fluoroquinolones and trimethoprim as well as other aminoglycosides. This was an ominous observation; however, it is not clear whether this naturally occurring strain has persisted or spread. - Mod.LL\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/181.]", "summary": "\n\nThe outbreak combines bubonic plague, which is spread by infected rats via flea bites, and pneumonic plague, spread from person to person.

Chem Biol Interact. 2017; 267: 89-95; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cbi.2016.03.030\nAbstract\n--------\n'_Yersinia pestis_, the agent of plague, is among the deadliest bacterial pathogens affecting humans, and is a potential biological weapon. Because antibiotic resistant strains of _Y. pestis_ have been observed or could be engineered for evil use, vaccination against plague might become the only means to reduce mortality. Although plague is re-emerging in many countries, a vaccine with worldwide license is currently lacking. The vaccine strategy described here is based on an oral vaccination with an attenuated strain of _Y. pseudotuberculosis_. Indeed, this species is genetically almost identical to _Y. pestis_, but has a much lower pathogenicity and a higher genomic stability. Gradual modifications of the wild-type _Y. pseudotuberculosis_ strain IP32953 were performed to generate a safe and immunogenic vaccine. Genes coding for three essential virulence factors were deleted from this strain. To increase cross-species immunogenicity, an F1-encapsulated _Y. pseudotuberculosis_ strain was then generated. For this, the _Y. pestis_ caf operon, which encodes F1, was inserted first on a plasmid, and subsequently into the chromosome. The successive steps achieved to reach maximal vaccine potential are described, and how each step affected bacterial virulence and the development of a protective immune response is discussed. The final version of the vaccine, named VTnF1, provides a highly efficient and long-lasting protection against both bubonic and pneumonic plague after a single oral vaccine dose. Since a _Y. pestis_ strain deprived of F1 exist or could be engineered, we also analyzed the protection conferred by the vaccine against such strain and found that it also confers full protection against the two forms of plague. Thus, the properties of VTnF1 makes it one of the most efficient candidate vaccines for mass vaccination in tropical endemic areas as well as for populations exposed to bioterrorism.'\n\n- and an adenovirus-based vector:\nSha J, Kirtley ML, Klages C, et al: A replication-defective human type 5 adenovirus-based trivalent vaccine confers complete protection against plague in mice and nonhuman primates. Clin Vaccine Immunol. 2016; 23(7): 586-600; http://cvi.asm.org/content/23/7/586.long\nAbstract\n--------\n'Currently, no plague vaccine exists in the United States for human use. The capsular antigen (Caf1 or F1) and 2 type 3 secretion system (T3SS) components, the low-calcium-response V antigen (LcrV) and the needle protein YscF, represent protective antigens of _Yersinia pestis_. We used a replication-defective human type 5 adenovirus (Ad5) vector and constructed recombinant monovalent and trivalent vaccines (rAd5-LcrV and rAd5-YFV) that expressed either the codon-optimized lcrV or the fusion gene designated YFV (consisting of ycsF, caf1, and lcrV). Immunization of mice with the trivalent rAd5-YFV vaccine by either the intramuscular (i.m.) or the intranasal (i.n.) route provided protection superior to that with the monovalent rAd5-LcrV vaccine against bubonic and pneumonic plague when animals were challenged with _Y. pestis_ CO92. Preexisting adenoviral immunity did not diminish the protective response, and the protection was always higher when mice were administered one i.n. dose of the trivalent vaccine (priming) followed by a single i.m. booster dose of the purified YFV antigen. Immunization of cynomolgus macaques with the trivalent rAd5-YFV vaccine by the prime-boost strategy provided 100 percent protection against a stringent aerosol challenge dose of CO92 to animals that had preexisting adenoviral immunity. The vaccinated and challenged macaques had no signs of disease, and the invading pathogen rapidly cleared with no histopathological lesions. This is the first report showing the efficacy of an adenovirus-vectored trivalent vaccine against pneumonic plague in mouse and nonhuman primate (NHP) models.'\n- Mod.LL\n\nMaps of Madagascar can be seen at http://www.geoatlas.com/medias/maps/countries/madagascar/mar2582r/madagascar_pol.jpg and http://healthmap.org/promed/p/181. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ]", "summary": "A ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n Thus, the properties of VTnF1 makes it one of the most efficient candidate vaccines for mass vaccination in tropical endemic areas as well as for populations exposed to bioterrorism.'\n\n- and an adenovirus-based vector:\nSha J, Kirtley ML, Klages C, et al: A replication-defective human type 5 adenovirus-based trivalent vaccine confers complete protection against plague in mice and nonhuman primates.

While the number of cases in this outbreak is consistent with what has been observed in previous years, the unusually high proportion of pneumonic forms (64 percent) is of concern [13,14]. Pneumonic plague is prone to spread in densely populated urban areas in the case of very close contact with a symptomatic case. Controlling the outbreak will depend on the ability of Madagascar to ensure rapid early detection and isolation of cases, their treatment using appropriate infection control measures, comprehensive contact tracing for post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP), and infection prevention and control measures. In contrast, the provision of care by traditional healers, the unsafe burial practices, and the limited application of infection control in healthcare settings may amplify the transmission as previously observed in Madagascar [14,23,24]. The outbreak currently involves several uncontrolled chains of transmission of pneumonic plague and the situation remains unclear at this stage. The infection and death of a foreign visitor to the country without a known source of transmission is of concern. The likelihood of further spread of the outbreak in Madagascar is considered high until the prevention and control activities implemented by the national authorities with the support of the WHO and international partners allow the outbreak to be controlled in the affected districts [23,24]. According to WHO and as of 2 Oct 2017, the overall risk at the national level is high [24].\n\n- The likelihood of spread to neighboring countries, including the EU outermost regions [EU OMRs]:\nThe short incubation period of pneumonic plague and the fact that Madagascar is an island limits the risk of spread in the region to incubating visitors travelling by air. Antananarivo is connected to neighboring islands in the Indian Ocean, including Mayotte and La R\u00e9union (EU OMRs), as well as the capital cities of eastern and southern African countries. No importation of infectious cases of plague to La R\u00e9union and Mayotte has occurred in the past 10 years. The fact that a foreign visitor developed pneumonic plague in Madagascar before returning to his home country underlines the fact that an incubating traveler may develop symptoms during a flight and upon return in his/her home country. There is no indication that contacts of the foreign pneumonic case have developed symptoms and they are likely to have received prophylactic antimicrobial treatment decreasing the risk of further spread and exportation. The likelihood of spread of plague at the regional level will depend on the intensity of transmission, mainly in the capital city. The regional risk is assessed by WHO as moderate due to frequent flights to neighboring Indian Ocean islands [24].\n\n- The risk for EU citizens residing in or travelling to the affected areas in Madagascar:\nAccording to the Madagascar tourist office, 293 000 tourists visited Madagascar in 2016. The most popular months were October, November, and December with around 40 000 visitors each month [30]. In 2016, around 137 000 travelers from 23 EU countries travelled to Madagascar by air, of which 75 percent originated from continental France. The peak travel months were July, August, and October. In addition, there are daily flights to La R\u00e9union and Mayotte, the EU OMRs in the Indian Ocean. Madagascar is also a popular destination for cruises. The probability of contracting plague in the affected areas in Madagascar is considered to be very low for EU travelers and would most likely result from a direct close contact with a case of pneumonic plague. The probability of importation to the EU through an incubating traveler arriving from Madagascar is considered very low. This probability would be slightly higher among people in the EU or OMRs returning home in Madagascar to visit friends and relatives (VFRs). The Malagasy community in France is estimated at between 100 000 to 140 000 residents mainly in the Ile-de-France region around Paris. The risk of international spread of plague appears very low according to WHO travel advice based on the available information as of 2 Oct 2017[24]. ECDC is closely following the situation, and the level of risk will be reassessed in light of further available information about the outbreak and the occurrence of multiple foci of transmission within the capital city, Antananarivo.'\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n******\n[2] Alleged exhumations\nDate: Sat 7 Oct 2017 7:34 EAT\nSource: L'Express Madagascar [in French, machine trans., edited]\nhttp://www.lexpressmada.com/blog/actualites/epidemie-des-cadavres-de-pestiferes-voles/\n\n\nThe lifeless body of a person who died in Amboditsiry, Antananarivo, following a suspected pneumonic plague outbreak on Wed 4 Oct 2017, could not be buried in the common grave of Anjanahary [Antananarivo], as stated by an official of the Municipal Bureau of Health (BMH). His family took the body, on the sly, to the district of Manjakandriana [Analamanga region], north east of the capital, where the family tomb stands. The official refused to admit if his relatives succumbed to the plague. 'We were faced with people who were ready to kill, if anyone touched the body, we were still around to try to negotiate. Unfortunately, they found an underground path to escape. They would have taken him to their family tomb,' a source said 6 Oct 2017.\n\nIn the district of Toamasina I, the corpse of a person with plague already buried in the cemetery of Manangareza disappeared from the mass grave. His family would have dug it up to move it in his family grave. The police of Toamasina I was alerted yesterday, 6 Oct 2017. 'We do not know which of the 2 bodies of the plague victims, buried in this cemetery was stolen. The teams of the Ministry of Public Health and gendarmerie went downstairs this day (yesterday [6 Oct 2017]) to find out,' a source told the Toamasina gendarmerie.\n\nDoctors say that there is risk of the bacteria spreading. 'The germ lives in the grave. The tombs were those who died of plague are buried are required to be sealed for years. Otherwise, the bacteria will continue to spread and affect the living,' says a doctor.\n\nJust yesterday, 6 Oct 2017, a boy, invited to a ceremony in the exhumation in Avaradrano district [Toamasina], in just a few days, tested positive for the pneumonic plague in a clinic in Antananarivo city. 'He surely contracted this illness during this event because he did not go anywhere else,' said the grandmother, worried about the health of her grandson. He is undergoing treatment at a large hospital in Antananarivo city since 6 Oct 2017. In addition, 10 days ago, a girl living in Soavimasoandro [Antananarivo], who attended an exhumation in Fianarantsoa, is suspected of having died of plague.\n\nDoctors noticed the coincidence between the period of exhumation and the plague season. 'All must be vigilant, especially, doctors. Sometimes the family of the deceased conceals certain information during the interrogation, if the death occurred outside the health facility,' says another doctor. Active research of all persons coming into contact with these bodies is now underway, indicated a source with the Ministry of Public Health. With the slightest mistake or negligence, the plague epidemic will continue to rage.\n\n[Byline: Miangaly Ralitera]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n[The following piece by C Claiborne Ray addresses the possibility of plague transmission from the dead (http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/19/science/can-you-contract-plague-from-a-corpse.html):\n\n'Can you contract plague from a corpse?\n---------------------------------------\nQ. If long-ago victims of the bubonic plague are dug up, could the germs infect someone?\nA. The body of a person who died from plague would not transmit the disease to another person unless that person had been in contact with lymph nodes, respiratory tissues, or bodily secretions soon after the death or had encountered a body that was frozen and then thawed, said Dr Roy M Gulick, chief of infectious disease at New York-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center. Neither sequence of events seems likely, Dr Gulick said, adding that fleas from plague-infected rodents in the area would be much more suspect.\n\nBubonic plague, one form of a chiefly flea-spread disease caused by the bacterium _Yersinia pestis_, is only rarely spread from person to person among the living, and any disease-causing organisms in an infected person who dies usually decompose quickly, Dr Gulick said.\n\nBubonic plague is not directly transmitted from one human to another unless there is direct contact with lymph node tissue or secretions, he said. However, the pneumonic and septicemic forms of the plague can be transmitted through infected droplets in the air.\n\n'In the Middle Ages,' Dr Gulick said, 'corpses of people who died of plague were used as biological weapons by catapulting them into walled cities.' The disease did spread to townspeople (and catapulters), he said, but it is not clear whether it was spread by bodily secretions or infected fleas.'\n\nIt is conceivable that aerosolization of infected secretions could occur in exhumation or reburial procedures, especially is there is manipulation of the oral cavity, but it is not clear how frequently, this occurs. In the ECDC risk assessment above, 'unsafe' burial practices is mentioned but not elaborated on. - Mod.LL]\n\n******\n[3] Seychelles: airline suspension\nDate: Sat 7 Oct 2017\nSource: Madagascar Tribune [in French, machine trans., edited]\nhttp://www.madagascar-tribune.com/Air-Seychelles-suspend-ses-vols,23339.html\n\n\n'Following the advice and at the request of the Authority of Public Health of Seychelles on the concerns of the plague in Madagascar, Air Seychelles will suspend temporarily its services between Seychelles and Madagascar from Sun 8 Oct 2017.'

The risk of international spread of plague appears very low according to WHO travel advice based on the available information as of 2 Oct 2017[24]. Pneumonic plague is prone to spread in densely populated urban areas in the case of very close contact with a symptomatic case. The fact that a foreign visitor developed pneumonic plague in Madagascar before returning to his home country underlines the fact that an incubating traveler may develop symptoms during a flight and upon return in his/her home country. The likelihood of spread of plague at the regional level will depend on the intensity of transmission, mainly in the capital city.

The basketball coach died in hospital in Antananarivo on Wed 27 Sep 2017 while visiting the island nation for a sports event. Health authorities are tracing people with whom he came into contact in recent days and who may have become exposed to the illness. Once identified, they will be given antimicrobials to prevent infection as a precautionary measure. The incident brings the death count to 21 since the outbreak was identified in late August 2017; at least 114 people have been infected.\n\n'WHO is concerned that plague could spread further because it is already present in several cities, and this is the start of the epidemic season, which usually runs from September to April,' said Dr. Charlotte Ndiaye, WHO Representative in Madagascar. 'Our teams are on the ground in Madagascar providing technical guidance, conducting assessments, supporting disease surveillance, and engaging with communities,' she added. 'We are doing everything we can to support the government's efforts, including by coordinating health actors.'\n\nFurther deployments of WHO staff and through response partners in the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) are underway, as well as increased supplies of antibiotics, personal protective equipment and other supplies. WHO has released USD 300 000 in emergency funds, as well as critical medical supplies, to quickly scale up operational efforts and is appealing for USD 1.5 million to support the response.\n\nPlague is endemic to Madagascar, where around 400 cases of -- mostly bubonic -- plague are reported annually. Contrary to past outbreaks, this one is affecting large urban areas, which increases the risk of transmission. The number of cases identified thus far is higher than expected for this time of year. Bubonic plague is spread by infected rats via flea bite, pneumonic by person-to-person transmission. The current outbreak includes both forms of plague. Nearly half of the cases identified so far are of pneumonic plague.\n\nPlague is a disease of poverty. It thrives in places with poor sanitary conditions and inadequate health services. It can kill quickly if left untreated but can also be cured by common antibiotics if delivered early. The last reported outbreak in December 2016 was mainly bubonic plague occurring in remote areas.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Some sources report as many as 24 deaths as of 30 Sep 2017 (https://sivertimes.com/plague-madagascar-announces-emergency-measures/71001).\n\nPlague is caused by the _Yersinia pestis_ bacillus, carried by rat fleas. At the start of the rainy season, rats flee the sewers of Madagascar in massive numbers and take refuge in people's cottages. Care must be taken in any rodent eradication program to ensure that a flea-killing compound is part of the plan. Just as in a natural rodent die-off from _Y. pestis_, the fleas will seek alternate hosts, that is, humans.

Further deployments of WHO staff and response partners in the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) are underway, as well as increased supplies of antibiotics, personal protective equipment and other supplies.\n- Active case finding, field investigations and contact tracing are ongoing in all the main affected areas. In addition, monitoring of contacts of cases as well as provision of chemoprophylaxis is ongoing.\n- Information on pneumonic plague has been disseminated to the health professionals to improve case detection and case management.\n- Awareness campaigns are being conducted through various channels to sensitize people about the disease spread and prevention measures.\n- Houses of all the identified cases and close contacts in Antananarivo have been sprayed with insecticides.\n- Recommendations for standard management of dead bodies from all suspected, probable and confirmed plague cases are being put in place.\n- WHO has deployed an epidemiologist to support the Country Office and the Ministry of Health in response to the outbreak.\n- Procurement of rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) is being done to enhance diagnostic capacity.\n\nSituation interpretation\n------------------------\nPlague is endemic in Madagascar, especially in the central highlands, where a seasonal upsurge (predominantly the bubonic form) occurs each year, usually between August and September. Although the occurrence of the pneumonic form of the disease during the seasonal surge is usually expected, the current outbreak affecting major urban centers is unusual and concerning. Cases have been reported from 14 different districts, including Toamasina and Antananarivo, an overcrowded city of over 2 million people. These places have highly populated settlements, characterized by rapid and unplanned urbanization with poor living standards. The management and control of an outbreak in such setting is therefore complex and difficult.\n\nThe current outbreak of pulmonary plague originated in Ankazobe, a known plague endemic area. The initial cases probably developed bubonic plague, which later evolved to secondary pulmonary form due to lack of treatment. This pneumonic form facilitated rapid spread of the disease to several people when the initial case travelled using public transportation. The spread was further aided by the poor management of the dead bodies prior to the declaration of the outbreak. Some of the dead bodies were the subject of rituals, including funeral vigils and transportation over long distances before the final burial.\n\nIn order to control this outbreak, strategic coordination of response is required at all affected areas. Epidemiologic surveillance and early patient care needs to be well established. Infection prevention and control measures, vector control and disease risk communication to the community are crucial.\n\n[Figures regarding: Geographical distribution of plague cases in Madagascar, 23 August - 30 September 2017 and Weekly trend of plague cases in Madagascar, 1 August - 30 September 2017 can be seen at the originally URL. - Mod.LL]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[This is early in the plague 'season' in Madagascar. The number of cases of pneumonic plague and the presence of _Yersinia pestis_ in nonendemic areas is of concern.\n\nPlague is caused by the _Yersinia pestis_ bacillus, carried by rat fleas.

However since 1990, an annual 200 cases are being reported and bubonic plague takes on epidemic form, especially in the port of Mahajanga, each year. In the capital city of Antananarivo, more cases are also being notified each year since 1990. Madagascar (pop. 13 million) has accounted for 45 percent of all the cases of plague in Africa.'\n\nFatalities related to plague usually are caused by spread of the organism from the bubo (the very painful infected lymph node which drains the area where the flea bite occurred) to the bloodstream. The bacteremia can cause a coagulopathy, producing the purpura seen in the 'black plague' and also spread to the lungs causing a hemorrhagic pneumonia. It is the pneumonia that can facilitate person-to-person transmission.\n\nMadagascar was the location of the isolation of multi-antimicrobial resistant _Y. pestis_ in 1995 (Galimand M, Guiyoule A, Gerbaud G, et al: Multidrug resistance in _Yersinia pestis_ mediated by a transferable plasmid.

The strain was resistant to chloramphenicol, streptomycin, and tetracycline but sensitive to fluoroquinolones and trimethoprim as well as other aminoglycosides.

It is a form of plague that is highly transmissible (person-to-person) and quickly causes death without treatment. WHO is concerned that the outbreak may spread because it is already present in several cities and this is just the start of the plague epidemic season, which usually runs from September to April.\n\nPlague is endemic to Madagascar but contrary to past outbreaks, this one affects large urban areas, including the capital and port cities. The overall risk of further spread at the national level is high, at the regional level is moderate due to frequent flights to neighboring Indian Ocean islands, and at the global level is perceived to be low.\n\nThe outbreak is affecting the densely populated cities in Madagascar that include Antananarivo/Analamanga with 3 724 021 inhabitants, Tamatave/ Atsinanana with 1 412 021 inhabitants, Majunga /Boeny with 889 277 inhabitants, and Finanrantsoa /Haut Matsuartra with 1 333 550 inhabitants. Antananarivo is the capital city of Madagascar. A total of 8 regions have reported cases including Sava, Boeni and Atsinanana. These coastal regions are non-endemic areas for bubonic plague.\n\nMany of the cases identified are directly or indirectly linked to the 1st recognized case, which is evidence of person-to-person transmission of pneumonic plague. Urgent public health response is required and support is needed to strengthen capacities already available at country level to control the outbreak.\n\nPeople Affected\n----------------\nA total of 104 cases of which 52 pneumonic plague (23 Aug 2017 - 28 Sep 2017)\nUp to 20 deaths 19.23 percent case fatality rate (CFR) of the current outbreak\n\nKey facts\n---------\n- Plague is caused by the bacteria _Yersinia pestis_, a zoonotic bacteria, usually found in small mammals and their fleas.\n- Plague can kill quickly if left untreated, but common antimicrobials can effectively cure it if they are delivered early.\n- People infected with plague usually develop 'flu-like' symptoms after an incubation period of 1-7 days.\n- There are 2 main clinical forms of plague infection: bubonic and pneumonic.\n- Bubonic plague is the most common form and is spread by rats, pneumonic by person-to-person transmission.

On [Sun 27 Aug 2017], he developed respiratory symptoms during his journey in a shared public taxi from Ankazobe District to Tamatave (via Antananarivo). His condition worsened and he died. His body was prepared for a funeral at the nearest hospital, Moramanga District Hospital, without safety procedures. Additionally, 31 people who came into contact with this case either through direct contact with the primary case or had other epidemiological links, became ill, and 4 cases of them died.\n\nThe outbreak was detected on [Mon 11 Sep 2017], following the death of a 47-year-old woman from Antananarivo, who was admitted to a hospital with respiratory failure caused by pneumonic plague. The public health authorities Direction de la Veille Sanitaire et de la Surveillance Epid\u00e9miologique (DVSSE) immediately launched field investigations.\n\nAs of 28 September 2017, a total of 51 cases (suspected, probable and confirmed) of pneumonic plague, including 12 deaths were reported in the country. The diagnosis was confirmed by the Institut Pasteur de Madagascar by polymerase chain reaction test and using rapid diagnostic test.\n\nIn addition to the 51 suspected, probable and confirmed cases of pneumonic plague, and during the same period another 53 cases of bubonic plague including 7 deaths have been reported throughout the country. One case of septicaemic plague has also been identified and they were not directly linked to the outbreak.\n\nPublic health response\n----------------------\nThe Ministry of Health activated crisis units in Antananarivo and Toamasina and all cases have been provided access to treatment at no cost. Active case finding and contact tracing are on-going and all pneumonic cases are being isolated and treated, and all contacts are receiving chemoprophylaxis.\n\nThere are additional ongoing key public health response measures which include:\n- Ongoing investigation of new cases.\n- Strengthening of the epidemiological surveillance in the affected and surrounding districts, including contact identification, administration of chemoprophylaxis, and monitoring close contacts of pneumonic plague cases.\n- Disinfection of affected areas, including rodent and vector control.\n- Raising awareness of the population about prevention and actions after exposure.\n- Raising awareness among health care workers and providing information including infection control measures, and implementation of safe burial practices.\n\nWHO risk assessment\n-------------------\nPlague is an infectious disease caused by the bacterium _Yersinia pestis_, a zoonotic bacteria, usually found in small mammals and their fleas. It is transmitted between animals from their fleas. Humans can be contaminated by the bite of infected fleas, through direct contact with infected materials or by inhalation.\n\nThere are 3 forms of plague infection, depending on the route of infection: bubonic, septicaemic and pneumonic.\n\nBubonic plague (known in medieval Europe as the 'Black Death') is the most common form of plague and is caused by the bite of an infected flea. Plague bacillus, _Yersinia pestis_, enters at the bite and travels through the lymphatic system to the nearest lymph node where it replicates itself. The lymph node then becomes inflamed, tense and painful, and is called a 'bubo'. At advanced stages of the infection the inflamed lymph nodes can turn into open sores filled with puss.\n\nPneumonic plague-or lung-based plague- is the most virulent form of plague. Incubation period can be as short as 24 hours. Typically, the pneumonic form is caused by spread to the lungs from advanced bubonic plague. However, a person with secondary pneumonic plague may form aerosolized infective droplets and transmit plague via droplets to other humans. Untreated pneumonic plague is always fatal.\n\nSepticemic plague occurs when infection spreads through the bloodstream, following a bubonic or a pneumonic plague.\n\nPlague can be a very severe disease in people, particularly in its septicaemic and pneumonic forms, with a case-fatality ratio of 30-100 percent if left untreated. The pneumonic form is invariably fatal unless treated early, is especially contagious and can trigger severe epidemics through person-to-person contact via droplets in the air.\n\nPlague is an endemic disease in Madagascar; cases of bubonic plague are reported nearly every year, during the epidemic season (between September and April). However, the ongoing pneumonic plague event has been reported in a non-endemic area and in densely populated coastal cities for the 1st time.\n\nPneumonic plague is a form of plague that is transmissible from person-to-person, with a potential to trigger severe epidemics if inadequately controlled. Detection of this outbreak occurred more than 2 weeks after the 1st case died during which cases travelled to different parts of the country, including the capital Antananarivo. Therefore, the overall risk at the national level is high. The overall regional risk is moderate due to frequent flights to neighboring Indian Ocean islands. The global risk is low.\n\nWHO advice\n----------\nPrevention and control measures:\n\n- Preventive measures include informing people when zoonotic plague is present in their environment and advising them to take precautions against flea bites and not to handle animal carcasses. The most rapid and effective method for controlling fleas is to apply an appropriate insecticide formulated as a dust or low-volume spray. People, especially health workers, should also avoid direct contact with infected tissues such as buboes, or close exposure to patients with pneumonic plague. Important prevention and control measures include:\n- Find and stop the source of infection.\n- Protect health workers: inform and train them on infection prevention and control. Isolate: patients with pneumonic plague. They should be isolated so as not to infect others via air droplets.\n\nSurveillance:\n- Identify and monitor close contacts of pneumonic plague patients and give them a 7 day chemoprophylaxis.\n- Obtain specimens which should be carefully collected and sent to labs for testing.\n- Ensure safe burial practices.\n\nTreatment:\nUntreated plague can be rapidly fatal, so early diagnosis and treatment is essential for survival and reduction of complications. Antimicrobials and supportive therapy are effective against plague if patients are diagnosed in time.\n\nTravel advice:\nWHO advises against any restriction on travel or trade on Madagascar based on the available information. It is recommended to provide information at the ports of entry (airports, seaports) of Madagascar about the disease and the necessary protection measures required.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n\n[The rapid increase in number of cases of plague, especially pneumonic plague and cases in non-endemic areas, are of concern especially so early in the plague season.\n\nA recently published paper has shed light on the maintenance of plague on Madagascar:\n\nVogler AJ, Andrianaivoarimanana V, Telfer S, et al: Temporal phylogeography of Yersinia pestis in Madagascar: Insights into the long-term maintenance of plague. PLoS Negl Trop Dis 2017;11(9): e0005887. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0005887\n\nAbstract:\nBackground\n----------\n'_Yersinia pestis_ appears to be maintained in multiple, geographically separate, and phylogenetically distinct subpopulations within the highlands of Madagascar. However, the dynamics of these locally differentiated subpopulations through time are mostly unknown. To address that gap and further inform our understanding of plague epidemiology, we investigated the phylogeography of _Y. pestis_ in Madagascar over an 18 year period.\n\nMethodology/Principal findings\n------------------------------\n'We generated whole genome sequences for 31 strains and discovered new SNPs that we used in conjunction with previously identified SNPs and variable-number tandem repeats (VNTRs) to genotype 773 Malagasy _Y. pestis_ samples from 1995 to 2012. We mapped the locations where samples were obtained on a fine geographic scale to examine phylogeographic patterns through time. We identified 18 geographically separate and phylogenetically distinct subpopulations that display spatial and temporal stability, persisting in the same locations over a period of almost 2 decades. We found that geographic areas with higher levels of topographical relief are associated with greater levels of phylogenetic diversity and that sampling frequency can vary considerably among subpopulations and from year to year. We also found evidence of various _Y. pestis_ dispersal events, including over long distances, but no evidence that any dispersal events resulted in successful establishment of a transferred genotype in a new location during the examined time period.\n\nConclusions/Significance\n------------------------\n'Our analysis suggests that persistent endemic cycles of _Y. pestis_ transmission within local areas are responsible for the long term maintenance of plague in Madagascar, rather than repeated episodes of wide scale epidemic spread. Landscape likely plays a role in maintaining _Y. pestis_ subpopulations in Madagascar, with increased topographical relief associated with increased levels of localized differentiation. Local ecological factors likely affect the dynamics of individual subpopulations and the associated likelihood of observing human plague cases in a given year in a particular location.'\n\nAuthor summary\n--------------\n'Plague exists in several geographically separate phylogenetic groups within Madagascar, but little is known about the dynamics of these groups through time. We subtyped 773 Malagasy plague samples and identified 18 phylogenetic groups that showed persistence in the same locations over a period of almost 2 decades. Locations with more topographical relief contained more phylogenetic groups than flatter areas and different phylogenetic groups varied considerably in the number of samples collected each year. Transfers of plague from one location to another definitely occur, but appear to seldom result in the transplanted phylogenetic group becoming successfully established in a new location. Persistent, local transmission cycles are likely responsible for the long term maintenance of plague in Madagascar, rather than repeated wide scale disease transmission events. Landscape likely plays a role in maintaining different phylogenetic groups, with increased topographical relief associated with increased numbers of phylogenetic groups. Local ecological factors likely affect the dynamics of individual subpopulations and the associated likelihood of observing human plague cases in a given year in a particular location.' - Mod.LL\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/181.]", "summary": "- Plague is endemic to Madagascar, where around 400 cases of, mostly bubonic, plague are reported annually\n- Madagascar's last severe plague outbreak in December 2016 affected 68 people and caused 27 deaths.\n\n--\n A ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n[1]\n Up to 20 deaths 19.23 percent case fatality rate (CFR) of the current outbreak\n\nKey facts\n---------\n- Plague is caused by the bacteria _ [The rapid increase in number of cases of plague, especially pneumonic plague and cases in non-endemic areas, are of concern especially so early in the plague season.

A total of 93 suspected plague patients have been registered between [1 Aug 2017] and [25 Sep 2017] and 5 of them have died, according to the latest report from the Ministry of Public Health, announced at the meeting of daily meeting Ambohidahy yesterday, [Tue 26 Sep 2017].\n\nAs many as 17 districts are now affected by the epidemic, particularly those of the central highlands. These are, among others, Antananarivo city, Avaradrano, Atsimondrano, Andramasina, Ankazobe, Moramanga, Ankazobe, Ambohidratrimo, Tsiroanomandidy, Miarinarivo, Faratsiho, of Arivonimamo and Maevatanana. The disease is widespread in areas that do not usually have the plague, such as Voh\u00e9mar and Toamasina, where imported cases were reported at the beginning of September [2017]. It was a person, infected with plague from Ankazobe, who traveled aboard a bush taxi to Toamasina, in late August [2017], which caused the epidemic of pneumonic plague in Toamasina and Antananarivo to Voh\u00e9mar city. Cases of bubonic plague are reported in other districts.\n\nIn Antananarivo, 4 patients, suspected of pulmonary plague, are still receiving treatment at the anti-plague hospital in Ambohimiandra (CHAPA), as of [Tue 26 Sep 2017]. Two others have returned home, cured and without risk of infection. The Minister of Health, Professor Mamy Lalatiana Andriamanarivo, says that the epidemic is under control, but new cases appear almost every day, However, there was the death of a girl in Soavimasoandro on [Sun 24 Sep 2017], following a pulmonary suspicion, and there were also patients admitted to CHAPA, last week. Following this, the figure has almost doubled in a few days. Last week, there were still 60 cases confirmed by the Institute Pasteur of Madagascar (IPM).\n\nIt is only at the beginning of the plague season right now. It may last through April [2018]. Until then, this epidemic may infect hundreds, if serious measures are not taken. Everyone has to make his own, especially in terms of sanitation, to prevent the rise of rats at the village level. Plague is a disease of rats that is transmitted accidentally to man. Pneumonic plague presents with sudden high fever, fatigue, and a blood-streaked cough. The appearance of painful (lymphatic) glands is a distinctive symptom of bubonic plague. If treated on time, the disease presents no danger.\n\n[Byline: Miangaly Ralitera]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\npromed@promedmail.org\n\n[Plague is caused by the _Yersinia pestis_ bacillus, carried by rat fleas. At the start of the rainy season, rats flee the sewers of Madagascar in massive numbers and take refuge in people's cottages. Care must be taken in any rodent eradication program to ensure that a flea-killing compound is part of the plan. Just as in a natural rodent die-off from _Y. pestis_, the fleas will seek alternate hosts, that is, humans. It is worrisome that some cases have spread to the east side of the island where plague is not often seen.\n\nThe last WHO statistics on global plague infections was published in 2016 with data 2010-2015; Bertherata E: Plague around the world, 2010-2015.

The Ministry of Public Health is stepping up its efforts to prevent the spread of the disease. The Ambohimiandra anti-plague hospital (CHAPA) admitted its 6th case yesterday, [Thu 21 Sep 2017].The rapid diagnostic test (RDT) for the pneumonic plague was positive.[Wed 20 Sep 2017], in the early evening, another case was admitted. Shortly before this, a young man living in Manjakaray was also hospitalized. In total, therefore, there are 6 undergoing treatment in this hospital right now. Still considered as suspected cases of pneumonic plague, their sputum analyses were sent to the Pasteur Institute of Madagascar (IPM) for confirmation.\n\nThese patients all live in the agglomeration of Antananarivo, namely Manjakaray, Andraisoro, Ankaraobato, Soavimasoandro and Ambohimanarina. The route of infection remains an enigma in some of the cases, while for others, it was transmitted by victims of pulmonary plague that killed 5 people in Toamasina and Antananarivo earlier .\n\nAt this rate, the CHAPA carrying capacity, limited to 8 patients, will soon be exceeded. The Ministry of Health has, therefore, requested the National Bureau of Risk Management and Disaster (BNGRC) quickly install a tent in the grounds of the hospital, if other cases arise. The team, who works hard to support the sick, will also be strengthened. The doctors reassured that the plague is easily treated. 'If the case is diagnosed and treated in time, there is no risk of death. Patients are already discharged healthy, 'said a doctor who strongly advises medical consultation in case of high fever, fatigue, cough, sputum streaked with blood or lymph nodes.\n\nSince the end of August until [Sun 17 Sep 2017], 60 cases of plague, throughout Madagascar, were confirmed by the IPM, according to Dr. Manitra Rakotoarivony, director of Health Promotion. 'Fifty have been treated and are alive. Ten have succumbed,' he said, after the daily meeting of ministry staff on the plague season yesterday [Thu 21 Sep 2017]. He did not specify the number of victims of pneumonic plague. The Minister of Health, Professor Mamy Lalatiana Andriamanarivo, said [Mon 18 Sep 2017] that the victims of this epidemic of pulmonary plague amounted to 30 and 5 died.\n\nSince [Wed 20 Sep 2017], volunteers and the Ministry of Health teams have conducted campaigns of disinfection and disinfestation in neighborhoods where there have been suspected cases and in hazardous locations.

He developed malaria-like symptoms in mid-August, and during his journey in a bush-taxi from Ankazobe District to Tamatave (via Antananarivo) on [Sun 27 Aug 2017], he developed severe respiratory symptoms and died. After preservation of the body at Moramanga District Hospital, he was buried in a village close to Tamatave. Subsequently, 27 other individuals became ill - all cases either had direct contact with the primary case or other epidemiologic links.\n\nAs of [Thu 14 Sep 2017], a total of 28 cases, including 5 deaths (case fatality rate 17.8 percent) have been reported since the initial case was detected on [Sun 27 Aug 2017]. A total of 2 cases have been confirmed by rapid diagnostic test (RDT) at the Institut Pasteur de Madagascar (IPM).

She died at the Respiratory Diseases Service of the hospital in Antananarivo-city, after being admitted on [ Sun 10 Sep 2017], according to concordant sources.\n\nThe victim had contracted the disease during a holiday in the east of the Big Island.

She also stressed that members of the family of the deceased in Toamasina would have already returned home to Mahajanga and Voh\u00e9mar.\n\nHowever, there is no risk of transmission of the disease to those who have been in contact with the victim. The team of the Ministry of Public Health and of the BMH had been rushed to the hospital to distribute plague prevention drugs to his family and relatives and the hospital staff. They have also conducted a service disinfection operation where the deceased was admitted and the mortuary.

A previous die-off was reported in early July [2017].\n\nA notice posted on the Apache County website states: 'The Health Department has received an additional report of another prairie dog die-off in Old Concho.'\n\nThe notice bluntly states that 'Old Concho is now considered a plague-positive area.' The die-off occurred earlier in July [2017].\n\nFleas, and the rodents they commonly live on and feed off of, act as hosts for the life cycle of the bubonic plague bacteria, _Yersinia pestis_. Prairie dogs are quite susceptible to the disease and die quickly. Since their hosts are dead and the fleas can no longer get a meal of blood from them, the insects abandon their hosts who die deep in their burrows. They climb up and hang out near the entrance of the burrow, hoping to catch a ride and a meal on another passing animal, usually another rodent.\n\nThe new area of infestation is on the opposite side of Highway 61 northwest from the original infestation. A map of the affected area has been posted on the Apache County website.\n\n'They both happened during the same time period. If it was the same mode of transmission, I don't know,' said Apache County Public Health Director Chris Sexton. Sexton said he could not be sure if rodents or some other type of animal is moving the fleas around Concho.\n\nThe most recent die-off occurred on vacant land in an area with a smaller number of prairie dog burrows. Sexton said it was about 300 feet [about 91.5 m] to the nearest residence. He did not say who reported the die-off.\n\nThe property where the previous prairie dog die-off occurred was recently treated for fleas. A crew from Coconino County Public Health dusted the affected burrows with an insecticide to kill any fleas that were still alive.\n\nOn [13 Jul 2017], Dr Joe Busch, a staff scientist with the Pathogen and Microbiome Institute at Northern Arizona University, took samples of fleas from burrows where the die-off occurred at the property. 10 percent of the fleas sampled tested positive for the bubonic plague bacteria.\n\nSexton said that the burrows in the area of the most recent die-off will not be dusted because the property owners cannot be reached. He said the dusting crew must have the owner's permission before entering their property. Apache County does not conduct insecticide dusting of prairie dog burrows -- they contract with Coconino County for that work. Sexton said Coconino County staffers were unable to reach the property owners. No one from Apache County has attempted to contact them, he said.\n\nSexton was not concerned about the bacteria spreading from the untreated burrows, noting that no die-offs had been reported in Concho Valley. 'If this was something highly transmissible, like measles or flu, we would take more precautions,' he said.\n\nThe US averages about 7 cases of plague in humans annually, according to the Centers for Disease Control, although the disease did cause 4 deaths in 2015. Most US cases are in Arizona and New Mexico, according to a map on the CDC website.\n\nJeff Nafziger, an environmental health specialist with Navajo County, confirmed [Tue 1 Aug 2017] that a prairie dog die-off had occurred somewhere near Taylor, but he did not give a specific location.

But [sylvatic plague is] still out there.\n\nThe bacterium that causes the disease, _Yersinia pestis,_ was found in fleas collected from prairie dog burrows earlier this month [July 2017]. The burrows are located on the south side of Highway 61, on ranch land in Concho [Apache County]. The disease caused a die-off in several prairie dog colonies in the area. [MM] was the first to notice there was something wrong with the prairie dogs. 'I watch prairie dogs from my porch when I drink my coffee in the morning,' she said, noting that she can also see their burrows from other locations on her property.\n\nIn late June and early July [2017], MM noticed the burrows were strangely silent. No prairie dogs scurrying around in the cool of the morning, barking and calling to each other. She asked her husband, who runs cow-calf pairs at a ranch, to watch other burrows on the property. He also found some of them were silent, seemingly deserted. Knowing something was amiss, MM began calling state and local agencies, trying to get someone to check it out.\n\nOn [13 Jul 2017], Dr Joe Busch, a staff scientist with the Pathogen and Microbiome Institute at Northern Arizona University [NAU], arrived in Concho with some student assistants. MM didn't know how they had heard about the problem with prairie dogs in Concho, but she was glad to see them. MM wasn't aware that her chain of telephone calls had activated a state network that includes the Arizona Department of Health Services and the Arizona Game and Fish Department.\n\nThe network, which includes county health departments, keeps an eye on plague outbreaks in the state. Northeastern Arizona's prairie dog populations are the primary hosts for the disease in the state. 'She did all the right things, she was very proactive,' Busch said in a telephone interview.\n\nBusch and his student team came to Concho to take samples of fleas from the silent burrows outside MM's home. Wearing gloves taped to their long sleeves and pants taped at the ankle, the scientists placed 4-inch square pieces of white flannel into the entrances of a number of the burrows, after breathing onto the little squares of cloth. 'The carbon dioxide from their breath is what attracts the fleas.' Busch said.\n\nWhy collect fleas? Fleas, and the rodents they commonly live on and feed off of, act as hosts for the biological lifecycle of the bacteria. 'Plague can replicate and grow in fleas,' Busch said. The infected fleas then bite the rodents they live on and infect them with plague bacteria. Prairie dogs are quite susceptible to the disease and die quickly. Since their hosts are dead and the fleas can no longer get a meal of blood from them, the insects abandon their hosts who expire deep in their burrows. They climb up and hang out near the entrance of the burrow, hoping to catch a ride and a meal on another passing animal, usually another rodent.\n\nThe team spent about 6 hours in Concho, collecting samples from different burrows. 'We might get one flea from a burrow, we might get 30 fleas,' he said. After the fleas jump onto the fabric, the students promptly placed it inside a zipper baggie, noting the GPS location of each burrow that was sampled.\n\nBack in the lab at NAU, the fleas are frozen overnight to kill them, then they are mashed up and their DNA extracted from the mashed cells. The scientists look for the bacteria in the flea's DNA. 10 percent of the fleas from the sampled burrows in Concho tested positive for plague bacteria. Apache County Health Department director Chris Sexton said the county has contracted with Coconino County to visit Concho and dust the affected prairie dog burrows to kill the fleas.\n\nThis is not the 1st time a prairie dog die-off from the plague has occurred in Concho. Busch visited the area to take samples from burrows in 2012 as well.\n\nThe risk of infection for pets and humans is minimal.\n\nSince the plague has such a deadly reputation, it can be alarming. MM said that her husband has taken precautions, wearing insect repellent, and they have also treated their dog for fleas as a preventive measure. These are all good steps to take, according to Busch, because people and pets can get the plague if they are bitten by infected fleas.\n\nIn 2017, however, the risk of infection is low and the disease is readily treated with antibiotics; drugs that were far beyond the imagination of people who suffered with the disease in the 1300s.\n\nThe US averages about 7 cases of plague in humans annually, according to the Centers for Disease Control, although the disease did cause 4 deaths in 2015. Most US cases are in Arizona and New Mexico, according to a map on the CDC website.\n\nSexton said the best way to protect yourself and your pets is to stay away from burrows where a die-off has occurred. If you live in proximity to these burrows, use flea preventive products on your pets and keep them confined away from burrows if they run loose. People should wear insect repellent, tight-fitting clothes and hats if they venture near burrows, or if they work, camp, or hike outdoors. Don't let pets sleep in your bed.\n\nPlague symptoms are similar to the flu -- aches, fever, nausea, lack of energy. Symptoms usually occur within 2 to 7 days after a flea bite. People infected with the plague can also develop black, swollen boils near lymph nodes in the neck, underarms and groin -- the symptom that led to the name 'Black Death.' See your doctor promptly if you develop flu symptoms and you think you may have been bitten by a flea.\n\nMM feels authorities took too long to alert people to the potential threat, so she took steps herself to notify neighbors and people in the area. 'I felt like I'm sort of ground zero on this. I felt like if somebody got sick and I didn't tell people, I would feel responsible,' she said.\n\nFor more information about plague and how to prevent it, see the Public Health Notice on the homepage of the Apache County website at http://www.co.apache.az.us/apache-county-public-health-services-public-notice-07192017/ or visit the CDC webpage about the plague at https://www.cdc.gov/plague/index.html.\n\n[Byline: Trudy Balcom]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The state of Arizona can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/62015.

It is well marked and we are asking the public to respect all signs and closures for their own safety,' the park's manager Jude Smith explained in the statement.

It comes after large numbers of dead freshwater crayfish were reported on the river earlier this month [May 2017]. DNA analysis has now confirmed that the cause of death was crayfish plague.\n\nThe kill has only impacted white-clawed crayfish and other freshwater animals are not affected. This is a characteristic feature of the disease which only infects species of crayfish but causes 100 percent mortality. All agencies, including the National Parks and Wildlife Service, Inland Fisheries Ireland, and Tipperary County Council will be working to contain the outbreak to this stretch of the River Suir. Given the experience of outbreaks elsewhere, a total kill of the population is expected which will have major consequences for the ecology of the river. Crayfish are very common in the Suir and are important in maintaining its ecology.\n\nAnyone using the river is being urged to observe the 'check, clean, and dry' protocol once they leave the river and before using it again. This means that all wet gear (boats, clothing, and equipment) should be checked for any silt or mud, plant material, or animals before being cleaned and finally dried. Disinfectant or hot water (over 40 deg C [104 deg F]) should be used to clean all equipment and this should be followed by a 24 hour drying period.\n\nThe drying period is especially important in ensuring that all equipment is clear of infectious organism, including the removal of any water inside the boat. The crayfish plague organism can be carried on wet equipment to new sites and containment of the outbreak is essential to prevent spread to other unaffected populations in Ireland.\n\nThis is the 2nd confirmed outbreak of the disease in Ireland following one in County Cavan in 2015. There is no indication of how the disease reached the Suir although a link to the Cavan outbreak is considered unlikely as the disease there appears to have run its course. This outbreak on the River Suir is of great concern as the stretch of river affected is popular with anglers and canoeists.\n\nThe white-clawed crayfish is a globally threatened species and Ireland holds one of the largest surviving population. It is the only freshwater crayfish species found in Ireland and is present in lakes, rivers, and streams over much of the island. Throughout its European range, this species has been decimated by the impact of crayfish plague which spread to Europe with the introduction of North American species of crayfish.\n\nUntil 2015, Ireland was considered free of the disease and it remains the only European country without any established non-native crayfish species.\n\nIf crayfish plague becomes established there is a high probability that the white-clawed crayfish, which is currently protected under Irish Law and the EU Habitats Directive, will be eliminated from much of Ireland. If non-native crayfish are found to be established in Ireland, this could have a severe impact on habitats as they can destabilise canal and river banks by burrowing. It could also impact other freshwater species, such as salmon and trout fisheries.

The cat is expected to make a full recovery, and the owner is taking preventive antibiotics. Weld County has taken the lead on the case, but the home is near the Larimer-Weld county line.\n\nThe Larimer County Department of Health and Environment has one key message for residents: Don't panic. Larimer and Weld counties have instances of plague in rodents nearly every year, especially in more rural areas. Prairie dogs test positive for plague fairly regularly, and family pets occasionally contract the disease. Larimer County health department spokeswoman Katie O'Donnell said 3 cats and a dog have been infected in Larimer County in the past 2 years.\n\nPlague is treatable, both in people and animals, as long as it's caught early, O'Donnell said.\n\nThe most common strain in the area is bubonic plague, which is not contagious person to person but is carried by infected fleas and rodents. People most commonly contract plague from the bite of an infected flea, but they can also get the disease from direct contact with an infected animal. O'Donnell said the department sees the bulk of its cases between spring and the 1st freeze in the fall.\n\nSymptoms include a sudden onset of fever, headache, chills, weakness, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea, as well as swollen and painful lymph nodes near the flea bite.\n\nPeople can help prevent infection by applying insect repellent on themselves and flea-prevention treatments on their animals, O'Donnell said.\n\nIn 2015, TG, a 16-year-old Poudre High School student, died after he contracted septicemic plague, a rare and highly fatal strain. He was Larimer County's 1st confirmed plague death since 1999.\n\nPlague is largely concentrated in the western United States, and an average of 7 people contract the disease nationwide each year, according to the Centers for Disease Control.\n\nPrevent plague and other animal-borne diseases [Source: Weld County Department of Public Health and Environment]\n- Avoid flea bites: Stay away from rodents, and consider wearing repellent when in areas where rodents are present.\n- Keep fleas off your pets by applying flea-control products.\n- Do not allow cats or dogs that roam and hunt to sleep in your bed, as they can carry fleas.\n- Reduce rodent habitat around your home.

The cat tested positive for bubonic plague on 21 Apr 2017. The cat was given antibiotics and has improved, while the family is taking post-exposure plague medications and has not shown any symptoms, according to the news release. [Post exposure plague medication? This is only true in the sense that we typically do not take the necessary antibiotics until we have a reason, but this is a statement that is a bit out of the norm. - Mod.TG]\n\nThe cat is the 1st instance of confirmed plague in Boulder County this season. Plague occurs naturally in Colorado and is spread through fleas to wild rodents and small mammals such as squirrels, rats, prairie dogs and rabbits. Plague can spread to humans if they are bitten by an infected flea.\n\nCarol McInnes, Boulder County Public Health environmental health specialist, said in the news release that people should limit their exposure to fleas to reduce the risk of plague spreading. 'Keeping cats indoors is the best way to protect them from getting plague,' McInnes said. 'Pet owners should also discuss the best way to protect pets from fleas with their veterinarians.'\n\nRain and warmer weather typically mark the beginning of spring migration season for many rodents and small mammals throughout the Front Range. This migration season can increase the risk of other animal-borne diseases such as rabies, tularemia, hantavirus and West Nile virus, according to the news release.\n\nPeople should keep their property tidy and clear any areas where rodents or rabbits can hide and breed as well as storing bird and pet food away from areas that rodents could access. Stop pets from eating wild rodents and wear closed [toed] shoes in areas where animals have been sick or died. Do not mow over animal carcasses. Make sure pets are vaccinated against rabies. People should see a health care professional if they or their pet becomes sick after spending time near wildlife.\n\nBubonic plague\n--------------\nWhat is it? The commonest form of plague caused by the bacteria _Yersinia pestis_. It is an infection of the lymph nodes.\n\nHow does it spread? It spreads primarily through bites from infected fleas, which travel on small mammals and rodents. In some cases, the plague can be transmitted to humans from sick animals.\n\nIs it treatable? People with plague need immediate antibiotic treatment in the 1st 24 hours that symptoms occur. Without treatment, about 50 per cent of people with bubonic plague die. With treatment, about 13 per cent of people infected with bubonic plague die.\n\nWhat are the symptoms? Symptoms usually show up between 2 and 6 days after being infected. Chills, fever, fatigue or malaise, headache, muscle pain, seizures, and painful lymph gland swelling in the groin, armpits, or neck.\n\nHow do I avoid it? Protect pets from fleas and ticks and keep pets on a leash and out of wild rodent habitats. If you enter a wild rodent habitat, wear insect repellent and tuck pants cuffs into socks to prevent flea bites. Do not touch or feed wild rodents. Do not touch dead or sick animals. Prevent rodents in and around your home by clearing plants from outside walls, storing food properly and setting traps.

Test results were not complete on [Mon 17 Apr 2017].\n\nDiMenna said he doesn't expect the city to alter its trap-neuter-return program for feral cats in response to the infected animals. Under trap-neuter-return, cats living in feral colonies are trapped, sterilized, vaccinated, and returned to the area where they were found.\n\n'We are not trying to leverage this to make any changes' to trap-neuter-return, DiMenna said in an interview. 'I think the city is pretty committed to this program.'\n\nDiMenna urged groups and individuals who work with feral cats to take precautions, such as wearing gloves when they handle cats, and seeking prompt treatment for bites and scratches.\n\nHe also urged people not to put out food for feral cats, which can attract wild animals, such as skunks and raccoons, that can carry plague, in addition to predators such as coyotes that prey on cats.\n\nPeople also need to be aware of clinical signs of plague in both cats and people, which in cats can include swollen lymph nodes, vomiting, diarrhea, loss of appetite, and the presence of abscesses, discharge, or bloody sputum. In humans include sudden onset of fever, chills, headache, weakness, and painful swelling of the lymph nodes in the groin, armpit, or neck areas.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Plague is primarily a disease of wild rodents.

Human infections are rare but can be life-threatening. The case fatality rate of plague depends on the clinical presentation (that is, bubonic, septicemic, or pneumonic) and timing of initiation of antibiotic therapy; if untreated, the case fatality rate is over 50 percent for bubonic plague and approaches 100 percent for pneumonic plague. Rapid laboratory identification can help guide therapy.\n\nDomestic cats and dogs can also contract plague from infective fleas. They may carry infected fleas home to their owners. Cats may serve as a direct source of infection. There are many flea treatments and repellents appropriate for pets available.

Please take your pet to a veterinarian if you notice any abnormalities.\n\nVeterinarians should protect themselves by wearing gloves when examining these swellings. A bubo that ruptures may infect the veterinarian or even the pet owner if the pet owner is the one palpating the swelling.\n\nAnother form of the disease is the respiratory form. Cats may acquire this form and can spread it to their owners or the veterinarians through infected expiratory droplets. People are also prone to the respiratory infection.\n\nYou should also be aware that the fleas that hitchhike into the home via a pet vehicle can also transmit disease to you, the owner, or caretaker of the pet. Sleeping in the same bed with dogs has been associated with plague in enzootic areas. Plague patients with no history of exposure to rodents can be infected by _Y. pestis_ if their pets carry infected rodent fleas into the home. Veterinarians always should recommend flea control to dog and cat owners.\n\nPlague is infamous for killing millions of people in Europe during the Middle Ages. Today, modern antibiotics are effective in treating plague, but without prompt treatment, the disease can cause serious illness or death.

Zoonotic foci exist on several continents; however, resource-poor areas in sub-Saharan Africa account for most human cases (1). The pathogenesis of plague involves facultative intracellular infection of host macrophages, followed by fulminant extracellular growth and bacteremia (2). In the absence of effective antimicrobial drug treatment, bubonic plague is fatal in about 50 percent of cases and pneumonic plague in greater than 90 percent [of cases] (1,3).\n\nDrugs approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of plague include streptomycin and doxycycline. Streptomycin is bactericidal but rarely used because of limited availability and serious toxicities. Doxycycline is bacteriostatic and lacks concentration-dependent activity or a post-antibiotic effect, which might limit its efficacy for serious _Y. pestis_ infections (4). Nevertheless, low cost and oral dosing have made doxycycline a 1st-line treatment in several countries (5,6). Fluoroquinolones, include ciprofloxacin, have recently been approved by the FDA for treatment of plague based on animal and in vitro studies (4,7,8). Clinical experience with these agents, however, is limited (1,5).\n\nDuring 2011-2014, patients with suspected plague seen at 6 clinics and 2 hospitals in the West Nile region of Uganda were offered enrollment in an open-label study evaluating the safety and efficacy of ciprofloxacin for treatment of plague. Patients were excluded if they were pregnant, less than 8 years of age, considered too ill to receive oral treatment, or had received antimicrobial drug treatment in the preceding 7 days. After written consent was obtained, diagnostic samples were collected and oral ciprofloxacin administered for 10 days at a weight-calibrated dosage of approximately 15 mg/kg [0.00052 oz] twice daily (range 13-17 mg/kg)[0.00045-0.00059 oz], with a maximum dose for adults of 750 mg [0.026 oz] twice daily. Diagnostic samples were cultured on sheep blood agar and suspect isolates confirmed by bacteriophage lysis (9). Patients were monitored daily during treatment, and clinical outcome was assessed 14-21 days after initial evaluation. Because of simultaneous prevention efforts and lower than expected enrollment, the study was terminated early. The study was approved by Institutional Review Boards at the Uganda Virus Research Institute, the Uganda National Council for Science and Technology, and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nA total of 5 patients with culture-confirmed plague were enrolled and treated with oral ciprofloxacin (Table [for table, see original URL. - Mod.LL]). Median patient age was 27 years (range 10-52 years); median time between illness onset and enrollment was 4 days (range 1-7 days). Up to 4 patients had bubonic plague, with _Y. pestis_ isolated from bubo aspirates or blood cultures. The fifth patient, a 13-year-old boy, had pneumonic plague as indicated by hemoptysis, patchy bilateral infiltrates on chest radiograph, and _Y. pestis_ isolated from sputum. The illness had evolved over 6 days, a clinical course suggestive of secondary rather than primary pneumonic plague (3); the primary focus of infection was not identified. Three patients were admitted and 2 treated as outpatients. In addition to ciprofloxacin, all received acetaminophen, and 2 received a bolus of normal saline. All became afebrile within 2 days. At 14 days, all had been discharged and returned to their normal activities. The 13-year-old boy with culture-confirmed pneumonic plague reported mild, nonproductive cough, but no complications were identified.\n\nFluoroquinolones have pharmacokinetic properties that make them attractive for treatment of plague, including bactericidal activity, good oral bioavailability, excellent tissue penetration, and an established safety record (8,10). In vitro assays suggest that ciprofloxacin is comparable to streptomycin and superior to doxycycline or gentamicin for killing of intracellular _Y. pestis_ (4), and efficacy has been demonstrated in rodent and nonhuman primate models (8). Along with FDA approval, our results add to growing clinical experience (5) and support the broader use of oral ciprofloxacin for treatment of human plague, especially in resource-poor areas where [access to] intravenous treatment is limited.\n\nReferences\n----------\n1.

In vitro assays suggest that ciprofloxacin is comparable to streptomycin and superior to doxycycline or gentamicin for killing of intracellular _Y. pestis_ (4), and efficacy has been demonstrated in rodent and nonhuman primate models (8). The 13-year-old boy with culture-confirmed pneumonic plague reported mild, nonproductive cough, but no complications were identified. After written consent was obtained, diagnostic samples were collected and oral ciprofloxacin administered for 10 days at a weight-calibrated dosage of approximately 15 mg/kg Up to 4 patients had bubonic plague, with _Y. pestis_ isolated from bubo aspirates or blood cultures.

The African nation has the world's highest incidence of the bacterial infection that earned the grim name 'The Black Death' after it killed an estimated 50 million people in the 14th century. The rat- and flea-borne illness hits the island nation every year from about December to April.\n\nBut 2017 is different, says the WHO's Dr. Eric Bertherat. This latest outbreak has popped up in a completely new area. The mountainous area of Befotaka in southeastern Madagascar has seen 68 cases -- of which 27 have died -- since the end of 2016, according to WHO estimates.\n\nBertherat said there also are unconfirmed reports of a nearby 2nd cluster of some 30 cases. 'This outbreak occurred in a place where they had no plague case reported since 1950,' he told VOA from Geneva, after returning from a recent visit to Madagascar to assess the situation.\n\nEven more alarming, he says, is the fact that 'it occurred in a very remote and insecure place where it's very difficult to go. And that's the main problem, for the time being. There is no one to control the outbreak, because we are still trying to organize a kind of rescue operation to go there.'\n\nBertherat says plague is impossible to entirely eradicate. To do so, he said, would mean killing every plague-carrying wild animal, which is an impossible task, and very likely would disrupt a delicate ecological balance. Some developed nations like the USA experience plague. The CDC reported 16 cases in 2015. Four of those cases ended in death.\n\nBertherat says Madagascar is exceptionally susceptible, however, because of its persistent poverty. The spread of plague is often aided by poor sanitation and a lack of health care. But why, with modern medicine and new rapid tests available in Madagascar, does this 14th century affliction appear to be growing? The answer, Bertherat says, may lie in a very modern trend: deforestation. Madagascar has seen massive deforestation because of illegal logging and as subsistence farmers continue to push into wild habitats.\n\n'Our hypothesis,' he said, 'is that this re-emergence in fact is due to the further extension of the natural focus of the migration of the rats, and also the fact that there is more and more contact between the local population and the forest area.'\n\n[Byline: Anita Powell]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The following paragraph is from Chanteau S, Ratsifasoamanana L, Rasoamanana B, et al: Plague, a reemerging disease in Madagascar.

The district is outside the area known to be endemic in Madagascar. No plague cases have been reported in this area since 1950.\n\nAs of 27 Dec 2016, 62 cases (6 confirmed, 5 probable, 51 suspected) including 26 deaths (case fatality rate of 42 percent) have been reported in 2 adjacent districts in 2 neighboring regions of the country. As many as 28 cases, including 10 deaths, have been reported from Befotaka District in Atsimo-Atsinanana Region and 34 cases, including 16 deaths, have been reported from Iakora district in Ihorombe Region. Of the 11 samples tested, 5 were positive for plague on rapid diagnostic test and 6 are now confirmed at Institut Pasteur laboratory. Of the total reported cases, 5 are classified as pneumonic plague cases and the remaining as bubonic plague.\n\nRetrospective investigations carried out in those 2 districts showed that it is possible that the outbreak might have started in mid-August 2016. The investigation in neighbouring villages is still ongoing. On 29 Dec 2016, an investigation carried out within 25 km [approx. 15.5 mi] of the initial foci in Befotaka district has reported 3 deaths and is being investigated further for possible linkage to the outbreak. The affected zone is located in a very remote, hard to reach and highly insecure area (classified as red zone due to local banditry). Despite arrangements made with the local authorities, insecurity slows down the investigations and response activities. In addition, a helicopter has been made available but its use has been limited due to bad weather and financial limitations.\n\nPublic Health Response\n----------------------\nOn 6 Dec 2016, a 15 member multidisciplinary team from MoH, Institute Pasteur including public health professional, epidemiologist, entomologist and laboratory professional visited the affected area for epidemiological investigation and response activities. Key response activities already implemented include:\n\n- Epidemiological investigations including active case finding and rapid diagnostic testing\n- Training of community health workers on community-based surveillance and early detection of cases\n- Clinical management of suspected cases\n- Identification, follow up and chemoprophylaxis of contacts\n- Vector and reservoir control through the use of Kartman boxes\n- Sensitization of the population\n- Strengthening the community based surveillance\n- Free treatment of other diagnosed disease such as malaria\n- Strengthening early detection in neighboring districts\n- Laboratory confirmation\n\nWHO Risk Assessment\n-------------------\nBased on the available information to date, the risk of international spread appears unlikely, especially as it is occurring in a very remote area. However, the difficulty to reach the affected area hampered prompt investigation and therefore at this stage the real magnitude of the outbreak is still to be defined, and the risk of further spread in the area and sustained transmission cannot be formally ruled out. WHO continues supporting the ongoing investigation and response activities.\n\nWHO Advice\n----------\nFurther ecological investigations will be needed to understand the occurrence of a plague outbreak in an area which has not reported any cases of plague since 1950 in order to adapt long term surveillance and control measures.\n\nThe outbreak impacts rural communities which have already suffered from remoteness and inadequate access to health services. Staff from the MoH is supported by the Pasteur Institute of Madagascar, who are all experienced on control measures. However, local conditions make their implementation complex.\n\nDue to the remoteness of the affected area and the conditions for getting infected by the disease, the current outbreak does not represent a significant risk for travelers.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Plague is caused by the _Yersinia pestis_ bacillus, carried by rat fleas.

Elements of the Ministry of Public Health have been dispatched to this non-plague area. Authorities in the Befotaka Atsimo district and the Midongy Atsimo district have reported suspicious deaths in Inosy Ambalarano commune, Befotaka Atsimo district, in the Atsimo Atsinanana region this weekend. The victims had the same symptoms, namely [swollen] lymph nodes, such as those of bubonic plague. The exact statistics of the deceased escape from these sources. The brigade commander of the Befotaka gendarmerie Atsimo, a reliable source, reported 2 deaths. 'Our people did not see these bodies,' said a source from the police.\n\nAnother source in Midongy Atsimo, the district closest to the scene of the drama, reported dozens of deaths in 2 months. 'We have heard about people who died for unknown causes in Ambalarano 2 months ago. The inhabitants of this commune who come to shop in Midongy Atsimo speak of it, but they believe that it is due to the sorcery', it is explained.\n\nMaroriky, deputy of the district of Befotaka Atsimo, meanwhile, reported a dozen deaths. These figures came from the elements of the civil security of this small town which informed him of this drama, 4 days before. For now, everything is unclear as to the cause of the disease and the exact number of deaths.\n\nTeams from the Ministry of Public Health and the Pasteur Institute of Madagascar were dispatched to the site.

Local veterinarians also performed necropsies, when applicable, to establish the diagnosis. Idaho's Central District Health Department and Eastern Idaho Public Health coordinated with DPH on submission of specimens to the DPH Bureau of Laboratories for _Y. pestis_ testing and interviewed veterinary staff and pet owners. Specimens from blood, spleen, liver, and lymph nodes were screened using real-time polymerase chain reaction and confirmed by culture and phage lysis testing.\n\nAmong evaluated animals, _Y. pestis_ was isolated from 6 of 12 cats; 5 of the 6 were from areas in southwestern Idaho where dead ground squirrels with confirmed _Y. pestis_ had been reported in May 2016, and 1 was from eastern Idaho. Among these 6 cats, specimen collection occurred during [31 May-12 Jul 2016; cats ranged in age from 10 months to 14.5 years (median = 4 years), 4 (67 percent) were male, 5 (83 percent) resided both indoors and outdoors, and one resided outdoor only. All 6 cats were domestic shorthair breed and had been neutered or spayed. Fever and lymphadenopathy (n = 4, 67 percent) were the most commonly reported signs of illness. None of the cats had known pulmonary involvement. 3 of the 6 cats were treated with appropriate antibiotics (1); of these, 2 survived and 1 was euthanatized. The 3 other cats had died or had been euthanatized. All 6 cats reportedly had contact with ground squirrels and other wild rodents or rabbits before becoming ill; one had flea control administered before illness onset.\n\nCat owners, their household members, and veterinary staff were advised to be alert for fever and other plague symptoms (2) in themselves and other pets that might have had contact with the ill cats. Veterinary staff members were reminded about methods to prevent occupational exposure when managing pets suspected of having plague (1). In June 2016, an updated plague advisory was sent to veterinarians in 4 southwestern Idaho counties and 8 eastern Idaho counties. Local public health districts used the Idaho Health Alert Network to enhance situational awareness among health care providers and issue guidance on management and reporting of plague cases. Public communication strategies to raise awareness about the risk for and prevention of _Y. pestis_ transmission to persons and pets included an online map of plague-affected areas, warnings posted in affected public areas, and press releases advising residents about preventive measures. No human plague cases were reported.\n\nCat-associated human plague cases, including fatalities, have been reported in the western United States since 1977 (3). Compared with dogs, cats are highly susceptible to plague illness and can transmit disease to humans directly through exposure to respiratory droplets and infectious body fluids associated with bites or scratches (1). Cats could also carry infected fleas into households. _Y. pestis_-infected cats usually develop fever, anorexia, lethargy, and lymphadenitis (submandibular in approximately 75 percent of cases); approximately 10 percent of cases are pneumonic (4) and present the most risk to pet owners and veterinary staff members. During 1926-2012, 6 (43 percent) of all primary pneumonic cases of human plague that occurred in the United States had contact with domestic cats (5). No plague vaccine for pets is available.\n\nVeterinarians should consider the diagnosis of plague in pets, including cats, with compatible signs and exposure to rodent habitats, rodents, or ill pets in areas where plague is endemic or epizootic. Suspicion of plague should trigger the following actions by veterinary staff: 1) implementation of personal protective measures, including wearing masks and gloves; 2) isolation of the ill pet; 3) assessment of pulmonary involvement; 4) initiation of diagnostic testing for _Y. pestis_; 5) prompt administration of antibiotic therapy; 6) implementation of flea control for affected animals and the hospital environment; 7) provision of advice on household flea control to pet owner; and 8) notification of public health officials (1). Pet owners can reduce the risk for plague in pets by controlling pet roaming, implementing a flea control program, and minimizing rodent habitats and food sources inside and outside the home.

There are several forms of plague in human beings: bubonic, septicemic, and pneumonic.\n\nPlague, caused by _Yersinia pestis_, is enzootic among rodents in the western United States. Humans can be infected through 1) the bite of an infected flea carried by a rodent or, rarely, other animals; 2) direct contact with contaminated tissues; or 3) in rare cases, inhalation of respiratory secretions from infected people or animals.\n\nPlague is a potential bioterrorism agent. Human infections are rare but can be life-threatening. The case fatality rate of plague depends on the clinical presentation (that is, bubonic, septicemic, or pneumonic) and timing of initiation of antibiotic therapy; if untreated, the case fatality rate is over 50 per cent for bubonic plague and approaches 100 per cent for pneumonic plague. Rapid laboratory identification can help guide therapy.\n\nDomestic cats and dogs can also contract plague from infective fleas. They may carry infected fleas home to their owners. Cats may serve as a direct source of infection. There are many flea treatments and repellents appropriate for pets available. Some products may be suitable for dogs but not cats, or may be suitable for an adult but not a younger animal. Be sure to consult your veterinarian, as some products may be toxic to cats, kittens, and puppies, even resulting in fatalities.\n\nClinical signs in pets involve a localized swelling, such as under the jaw in cats, but also in the inguinal region or under the front leg (the armpit, if you will), lethargy, anorexia, and fever. These clinical signs may be present in the dog as well. Swelling under the jaw in cats is frequently mistaken as a cat fight abscess. Please take your pet to a veterinarian if you notice any abnormalities.\n\nVeterinarians should protect themselves by wearing gloves when examining these swellings. A bubo that ruptures may infect the veterinarian or even the pet owner if the pet owner is the one palpating the swelling.\n\nAnother form of the disease is the respiratory form. Cats may acquire this form and can spread it to their owners or the veterinarians through infected expiratory droplets. People are also prone to the respiratory infection.\n\nYou should also be aware that the fleas that hitchhike into the home via a pet vehicle can also transmit disease to you, the owner, or caretaker of the pet. Sleeping in the same bed with dogs has been associated with plague in enzootic areas. Plague patients with no history of exposure to rodents can be infected by _Y. pestis_ if their pets carry infected rodent fleas into the home. Veterinarians always should recommend flea control to dog and cat owners.\n\nPlague is infamous for killing millions of people in Europe during the Middle Ages. Today, modern antibiotics are effective in treating plague, but without prompt treatment, the disease can cause serious illness or death. Presently, human plague infections continue to occur in the western United States, but significantly more cases occur in parts of Africa and Asia.\n\nParts of this comment have been excerpted from CDC.

There are several forms of plague in human beings: bubonic, septicemic, and pneumonic.\n\nPlague, caused by _Yersinia pestis_, is enzootic among rodents in the western United States. Humans can be infected through 1) the bite of an infected flea carried by a rodent or, rarely, other animals; 2) direct contact with contaminated tissues; or 3) in rare cases, inhalation of respiratory secretions from infected people or animals.\n\nPlague is a potential bioterrorism agent. Human infections are rare but can be life-threatening. The case fatality rate of plague depends on the clinical presentation (that is, bubonic, septicemic, or pneumonic) and timing of initiation of antibiotic therapy; if untreated, the case fatality rate is over 50 per cent for bubonic plague and approaches 100 per cent for pneumonic plague. Rapid laboratory identification can help guide therapy.\n\nDomestic cats and dogs can also contract plague from infective fleas. They may carry infected fleas home to their owners. Cats may serve as a direct source of infection. There are many flea treatments and repellents appropriate for pets available. Some products may be suitable for dogs but not cats, or may be suitable for an adult but not a younger animal. Be sure to consult your veterinarian, as some products may be toxic to cats, kittens, and puppies, even resulting in fatalities.\n\nClinical signs in pets involve a localized swelling, such as under the jaw in cats, but also in the inguinal region or under the front leg (the armpit, if you will), lethargy, anorexia, and fever. These clinical signs may be present in the dog as well. Swelling under the jaw in cats is frequently mistaken as a cat fight abscess. Please take your pet to a veterinarian if you notice any abnormalities.\n\nVeterinarians should protect themselves by wearing gloves when examining these swellings. A bubo that ruptures may infect the veterinarian or even the pet owner if the pet owner is the one palpating the swelling.\n\nAnother form of the disease is the respiratory form. Cats may acquire this form and can spread it to their owners or the veterinarians through infected expiratory droplets. People are also prone to the respiratory infection.\n\nYou should also be aware that the fleas that hitchhike into the home via a pet vehicle could also transmit disease to you, the owner, or caretaker of the pet. Sleeping in the same bed with dogs has been associated with plague in enzootic areas. Plague patients with no history of exposure to rodents can be infected by _Y. pestis_ if their pets carry infected rodent fleas into the home. Veterinarians always should recommend flea control to dog and cat owners.\n\nPlague is infamous for killing millions of people in Europe during the Middle Ages. Today, modern antibiotics are effective in treating plague, but without prompt treatment, the disease can cause serious illness or death. Presently, human plague infections continue to occur in the western United States, but significantly more cases occur in parts of Africa and Asia.\n\nParts of this comment have been excerpted from CDC.

On 10 Apr 2015, Zambia's Ministry of Health was notified by the Eastern Provincial Medical Office of possible bubonic plague cases in Nyimba District [Eastern Province]. 11 patients with acute fever and cervical lymphadenopathy had been evaluated at 2 rural health centers during 28 Mar to 9 Apr 2015; 3 patients died. To confirm the outbreak and develop control measures, the Zambia Ministry of Health's Field Epidemiology Training Program (ZFETP) conducted epidemiologic and laboratory investigations in partnership with the University of Zambia's schools of Medicine and Veterinary Medicine and the provincial and district medical offices.\n\n21 patients with clinically compatible plague were identified, with symptom onset during 26 Mar to 5 May 2015. The median age was 8 years, and all patients were from the same village. Blood specimens or lymph node aspirates from 6 (29 per cent) patients tested positive for _Yersinia pestis_ by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). There is an urgent need to improve early identification and treatment of plague cases. PCR is a potential complementary tool for identifying plague, especially in areas with limited microbiologic capacity. 12 (57 per cent) patients, including all 6 with PCR-positive plague and all 3 who died, also tested positive for malaria by rapid diagnostic test (RDT). Plague patients coinfected with malaria might be misdiagnosed as solely having malaria, and appropriate antibacterial treatment to combat plague might not be given, increasing risk for mortality. Because patients with malaria might be coinfected with other pathogens, broad spectrum antimicrobial treatment to cover other pathogens is recommended for all children with severe malaria, until a bacterial infection is excluded.\n\nEpidemiologic investigation\n---------------------------\nAfter the initial report of possible plague cases, the Nyimba District Medical Office began active case finding in the health center catchment areas. During 26 Mar to 5 May 2015, a total of 111 patients with fever or recent history of fever, and swollen lymph nodes were identified and evaluated for possible plague; 82 (75 per cent) patients were admitted to the health centers, treated with intravenous gentamicin and benzyl penicillin, and observed for at least one night. The remaining 29 patients received oral doxycycline and cotrimoxazole as outpatients.\n\nThe ZFETP investigation team arrived on 29 Apr 2015 to support the local response. Illness clinically compatible with plague was defined as temperature greater than or equal to 100.4 degrees F (greater than or equal to 38 degrees C) or history of recent fever, and at least one of the following signs or symptoms: 1) painful, visibly enlarged cervical, axillary, or inguinal lymph nodes; 2) evidence of sepsis (prostration, reduced responsiveness, or hypotension); or 3) severe pneumonia (cough with respiratory distress or hemoptysis). A suspected case of plague was defined as a clinically compatible illness in a resident of Nyimba District, with symptom onset during 15 Mar to 5 May 2015.\n\nAmong the 82 patients who had been hospitalized, 25 (not including any of the 21 identified with clinically compatible plague with symptom onset during 26 Mar to 5 May 2015) were available for physical examination. None had lymph node enlargement consistent with buboes, and none met the case definition. Based on medical record review, among all 82 hospitalized patients, 21 (26 per cent) from the same village met the suspected plague case definition. Among these patients, the earliest reported symptom onset was 26 Mar 2015, and the number of cases peaked during 6-7 Apr 2015 (Figure [for figure and tables, see original URL - Mod.LL]). The median age was 8 years (range 3-18 years), and 95 per cent were aged less than 15 years. 11 (52 per cent) patients were male. After fever, the commonest signs and symptoms were swollen cervical lymph nodes (90 per cent), cough (38 per cent), and headache (33 per cent) (Table 1). 2 patients who died lacked documentation of enlarged nodes, although both had reported neck pain.\n\nAmong the 21 suspected cases, blood specimens were collected from 11 (52 per cent) patients, and lymph node aspirates were collected from 3 (14 per cent) patients for culture. Both blood and lymph node aspirates were obtained from 2 patients (Table 2). Specimens were stored at the district hospital laboratory at 39-46 degrees F (4-8 degrees C) before being transported to the University Teaching Hospital reference laboratory in Lusaka, a process that took 3-17 days. Blood from 4 patients was placed in ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)-containing tubes, making these specimens unsuitable for culture. The remaining 7 blood specimens remained negative for _Y. pestis_ after 7 days, including one that likely grew a contaminant. All 3 lymph node aspirates were culture-negative. 5 blood specimens and 2 lymph node aspirates (6 patients) tested positive for _Y. pestis_ by PCR targeting a 478-base pair region of the _Y. pestis_ plasminogen activator gene (2) (Table 2).\n\nAmong 18 (86 per cent) suspected plague patients tested for malaria during initial evaluation by RDT (SD-Bioline Malaria Ag, Standard Diagnostic Incorporation, St Ingbert, Germany), 12 (57 per cent) tested positive, including all 6 who tested PCR-positive for plague. All of the 1st (according to date of symptom onset) 4 suspected plague patients tested positive for malaria and were treated with antimalarials (coartem and arteminisin combination therapy) on their 1st visit. However 3 of the 4 patients had antimicrobials added to their treatment regimen on their 2nd visits to the health center. 2 of the 3 patients who experienced this delayed initiation of antimicrobial therapy died.\n\nStructured interviews conducted with suspected plague patients or their caretakers and families of the decedents revealed that all 21 cases slept on reed mats on the floors of their huts, which was the practice among children in the village. Although no comparison group was interviewed, village elders reported that adults generally slept on beds or mats elevated off the ground.\n\nIn response to the outbreak, indoor spraying of 1303 (96 per cent) households in the 2 rural health center catchment areas was conducted using organophosphates (fenitrothion and pirimiphos-methyl), aimed at reducing the flea population, and recommendations were made to local leaders regarding risks for plague transmission, including that no one should sleep on the floor. Heightened surveillance for possible plague cases was initiated in this catchment area.\n\nDiscussion\n----------\nThe 1st recorded outbreak of bubonic plague in Nyimba District, Zambia resulted in 21 suspected cases and 3 deaths, primarily among children, during 26 Mar to 5 May 2015. Although no cases were confirmed by culture (the gold standard), 6 patients tested positive for _Y. pestis_ by PCR. The median age of cases in this outbreak was much lower than that in previous outbreaks in Africa (3,4). One possible explanation for the younger age distribution and absence of cases among adults was the practice of children sleeping on the floor, which might have brought children into closer contact with fleas, whereas adults generally slept on beds elevated off the floor. The identification of exclusively cervical buboes was unexpected, but it is not clear that examination of inguinal or axillary areas was performed consistently. A higher frequency of cervical buboes in plague cases in children compared with adults has been reported, although the inguinal region was the most common bubo location in all age groups (3).\n\nA large proportion (57 per cent) of cases, including all 3 fatal cases and all 6 PCR-positive plague cases, also tested positive for malaria. Malaria positivity might have delayed diagnosis and initiation of antibiotic treatment in some early cases in this outbreak, which might have contributed to poor outcomes. Malaria is often overdiagnosed in regions of Africa with endemic malaria, potentially delaying appropriate therapy for other bacterial illnesses (5). In areas where malaria is highly endemic, parasitemic patients can be acutely coinfected with another pathogen (6), including _Y. pestis_ (7). Malaria parasitemia in Nyimba is high (21.2 per cent) (8), so testing of febrile patients for malaria is routine. The availability of malaria RDTs in health facilities might influence a health provider to treat an RDT-positive patient for only malaria without considering bacterial coinfections. Malaria treatment guidelines published by the Zambia Ministry of Health and the World Health Organization recommend antibiotics for all patients with severe disease. This recommendation could be strengthened by explicit guidance that antibiotic treatment of severely ill patients should be administered even if the patient tests positive for malaria. The antibiotic regimens that were given to the suspected cases were appropriate for the treatment of plague and might have reduced the possibility of developing worse outcomes.\n\nPCR supported the plague diagnosis in Nyimba, because _Y. pestis_ was not isolated from blood specimens or lymph node aspirates obtained from suspected cases. Bacterial isolation is difficult in rural Zambia because of the lack of local microbiology capacity, inexperience with specimen collection and handling, and transport delays to the reference microbiology and PCR laboratory, 217 miles (350 kilometers) away. Blood specimens from the 1st cases were improperly collected, and at least one culture was contaminated with skin flora, suggesting breaches in sterile specimen collection technique. _Y. pestis_ grows on general nutrient-rich media, but at 98.6 degrees F (37 degrees C), its growth rate is slower than that of most other bacteria; therefore, organisms that replicated faster (9) might have masked its presence. Further, it is likely that most patients received antibiotics before specimen collection, although this was not documented. Under these challenging conditions, PCR testing might be more sensitive than culture, because it does not rely on detection of viable organisms. Microbiologic confirmation has been lacking in previous plague outbreaks in Zambia (10) and elsewhere in Africa (4). However, PCR is not considered the gold standard for plague, because false-positive results can occur with specimen cross-contamination.\n\nThe findings in this report are subject to at least 3 limitations. First, among 111 patients identified through active case finding, medical records of 29 (26 per cent) were unavailable for review, which might have resulted in underascertainment of cases. Second, only 25 patients were available for examination during their acute illness, leaving investigators to rely on review of medical records to classify cases. Although follow-up interviews with patients or their parents allowed investigators to confirm symptoms, the number of actual cases might have been underestimated because of missing and incomplete data. Finally, the lack of a control group limited the ability to assess risk factors for illness compatible with plague.\n\nPlague is probably underdetected in Zambia because of limited clinical recognition and laboratory capacity. Had the multiple subsequent cases not raised alarm, the initial cases in Nyimba would likely have been attributed to severe malaria, and plague might not have been recognized. PCR might improve detection, but will not influence clinical management given the long diagnostic delays. A point-of-care diagnostic test could improve early diagnosis and guide appropriate therapy. Efforts to increase awareness of plague among frontline health workers can improve early case recognition and treatment. Broad spectrum antibiotic treatment to cover other pathogens is recommended for all children with severe malaria, until a bacterial infection is excluded.\n\nReferences\n1.

Plague patients coinfected with malaria might be misdiagnosed as solely having malaria, and appropriate antibacterial treatment to combat plague might not be given, increasing risk for mortality. Illness clinically compatible with plague was defined as temperature greater than or equal to 100.4 degrees F (greater than or equal to 38 degrees C) or history of recent fever, and at least one of the following signs or symptoms: 1) painful, visibly enlarged cervical, axillary, or inguinal lymph nodes; 2) evidence of sepsis (prostration, reduced responsiveness, or hypotension); or 3) severe pneumonia (cough with respiratory distress or hemoptysis). All of the 1st (according to date of symptom onset) 4 suspected plague patients tested positive for malaria and were treated with antimalarials (coartem and arteminisin combination therapy) on their 1st visit. \n\nStructured interviews conducted with suspected plague patients or their caretakers and families of the decedents revealed that all 21 cases slept on reed mats on the floors of their huts, which was the practice among children in the village. 11 patients with acute fever and cervical lymphadenopathy had been evaluated at 2 rural health centers during 28 Mar to 9 Apr 2015; 3 patients died. Among the 82 patients who had been hospitalized, 25 (not including any of the 21 identified with clinically compatible plague with symptom onset during 26 Mar to 5 May 2015) were available for physical examination. The 1st recorded outbreak of bubonic plague in Nyimba District, Zambia resulted in 21 suspected cases and 3 deaths, primarily among children, during 26 Mar to 5 May 2015. \n\n21 patients with clinically compatible plague were identified, with symptom onset during 26 Mar to 5 May 2015. \n\nPCR supported the plague diagnosis in Nyimba, because _Y. pestis_ was not isolated from blood specimens or lymph node aspirates obtained from suspected cases. Based on medical record review, among all 82 hospitalized patients, 21 (26 per cent) from the same village met the suspected plague case definition.

In response to the outbreak, indoor spraying of 1303 (96 per cent) households in the 2 rural health center catchment areas was conducted using organophosphates (fenitrothion and pirimiphos-methyl), aimed at reducing the flea population, and recommendations were made to local leaders regarding risks for plague transmission, including that no one should sleep on the floor. Among these patients, the earliest reported symptom onset was 26 Mar 2015, and the number of cases peaked during 6-7 Apr 2015 (Figure [for figure and tables, see original URL - Mod. Had the multiple subsequent cases not raised alarm, the initial cases in Nyimba would likely have been attributed to severe malaria, and plague might not have been recognized. Because patients with malaria might be coinfected with other pathogens, broad spectrum antimicrobial treatment to cover other pathogens is recommended for all children with severe malaria, until a bacterial infection is excluded. \n\n\nOutbreak of plague in a high malaria endemic region -- Nyimba District, Zambia, March-May 2015\n A higher frequency of cervical buboes in plague cases in children compared with adults has been reported, although the inguinal region was the most common bubo location in all age groups (3). First, among 111 patients identified through active case finding, medical records of 29 (26 per cent) were unavailable for review, which might have resulted in underascertainment of cases. [authors: Nyambe Sinyange,Ramya Kumar, Akatama Inambao; Loveness Moonde, Jonathan Chama, Mapopa Banda, et al]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n< Although no cases were confirmed by culture (the gold standard), 6 patients tested positive for _Y. pestis_ by PCR. After the initial report of possible plague cases, the Nyimba District Medical Office began active case finding in the health center catchment areas. A suspected case of plague was defined as a clinically compatible illness in a resident of Nyimba District, with symptom onset during 15 Mar to 5 May 2015. On 10 Apr 2015, Zambia's Ministry of Health was notified by the Eastern Provincial Medical Office of possible bubonic plague cases in Nyimba District In areas where malaria is highly endemic, parasitemic patients can be acutely coinfected with another pathogen (6), including _Y. pestis_ (7). Malaria parasitemia in Nyimba is high (21.2 per cent) (8), so testing of febrile patients for malaria is routine. The antibiotic regimens that were given to the suspected cases were appropriate for the treatment of plague and might have reduced the possibility of developing worse outcomes. After fever, the commonest signs and symptoms were swollen cervical lymph nodes (90 per cent), cough (38 per cent), and headache (33 per cent) (Table 1). Both blood and lymph node aspirates were obtained from 2 patients (Table 2). Malaria treatment guidelines published by the Zambia Ministry of Health and the World Health Organization recommend antibiotics for all patients with severe disease. This recommendation could be strengthened by explicit guidance that antibiotic treatment of severely ill patients should be administered even if the patient tests positive for malaria. Second, only 25 patients were available for examination during their acute illness, leaving investigators to rely on review of medical records to classify cases. One possible explanation for the younger age distribution and absence of cases among adults was the practice of children sleeping on the floor, which might have brought children into closer contact with fleas, whereas adults generally slept on beds elevated off the floor. There is an urgent need to improve early identification and treatment of plague cases. However 3 of the 4 patients had antimicrobials added to their treatment regimen on their 2nd visits to the health center. The availability of malaria RDTs in health facilities might influence a health provider to treat an RDT-positive patient for only malaria without considering bacterial coinfections. Malaria positivity might have delayed diagnosis and initiation of antibiotic treatment in some early cases in this outbreak, which might have contributed to poor outcomes. Yersiniosis I: microbiological and clinicoepidemiological aspects of plague and non-plague Yersinia infections. PLAGUE - ZAMBIA: (EASTERN) 2015\n Although follow-up interviews with patients or their parents allowed investigators to confirm symptoms, the number of actual cases might have been underestimated because of missing and incomplete data. 2 of the 3 patients who experienced this delayed initiation of antimicrobial therapy died. \nOutbreaks of plague have been recognized in Zambia since 1917 (1). Efforts to increase awareness of plague among frontline health workers can improve early case recognition and treatment. Heightened surveillance for possible plague cases was initiated in this catchment area. Specimens were stored at the district hospital laboratory at 39-46 degrees F (4-8 degrees C) before being transported to the University Teaching Hospital reference laboratory in Lusaka, a process that took 3-17 days. Blood from 4 patients was placed in ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)-containing tubes, making these specimens unsuitable for culture. 2 patients who died lacked documentation of enlarged nodes, although both had reported neck pain. Malaria is often overdiagnosed in regions of Africa with endemic malaria, potentially delaying appropriate therapy for other bacterial illnesses (5).", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "malaria", "plague", "yersiniosis"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["1303-03-25 00:00:00", "1999-03-25 03:50:00-04:00", "1997-03-25 00:00:00", "2016-03-25 00:00:00", "2006-03-25 00:00:00", "1917-03-25 00:00:00", "2015-03-25 00:00:00", "2015-04-10 00:00:00", "2015-04-29 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "the Republic of Zambia", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Frean J", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Nyimba District", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Madagascar", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Zambia", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Mbulu", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Yersinia", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Uganda", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Mahajanga", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Tanzania", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Malaria", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Germany", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "malaria", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "4345331", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Plague, animal - USA (08): (MT) ferret, prairie dog, drone-delivered vaccine", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=4345331", "date": "2016-07-14 16:07:19", "main_text": "PLAGUE, ANIMAL - USA (08): (MONTANA) BLACK FOOTED FERRET, PRAIRIE DOG, DRONE-DELIVERED VACCINE\n**********************************************************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Tue 12 Jul 2016, 12.17 EDT\nSource: The Guardian [edited]\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jul/12/us-government-black-footed-ferret-mandm-vaccines\n\n\nThe US government is set to unleash drones that fire vaccine-covered M&Ms in a bid to save the endangered black-footed ferret, a species that is facing a plague epidemic across America's great plains. The US Fish and Wildlife (FWS) has developed a plan to bombard ferret habitat in Montana with the vaccine, which will be administered via specially designed drones that will be able to shoot M&Ms in 3 directions simultaneously.\n\nThe vaccines will be targeted at the prairie dog population at the UL Bend National Wildlife Refuge in north-eastern Montana. Black footed ferrets - North America's only native ferret - are completely dependent upon prairie dogs, which are a type of burrowing rodent, for their food and shelter. Both black-footed ferrets and prairie dogs are susceptible to the sylvatic plague, a flea-borne disease spread from rats that were introduced from ships arriving in California in the 1800s. While individual ferrets can be vaccinated by an injection, wildlife officials have found it difficult to protect prairie dogs over large areas.\n\nBlack-footed ferrets feast upon prairie dogs and invade their burrows, meaning that the disappearance of their co-dependent animal would prove disastrous for the species. Prairie dogs are considered a 'keystone' species due to their importance to a range of animals, such as eagles, owls and coyotes.\n\n'We dropped the vaccine out of a bag while walking around, but that's very hard to do over thousands of acres,' said Randy Machett, a FWS biologist. 'Spraying burrows with insecticide to kill the fleas is also labor intensive and not a long-term solution. So we are working with private contractors to develop equipment to drop the vaccine uniformly across an area, rather than one hog getting to eat a big pile of them.' Machett said a 'glorified gumball machine' has been devised to dispense the vaccine. This device can be fitted to a drone, which will use its GPS to reliably drop vaccines at 30ft [approx.9m] intervals. The drone will also be able to fire out the M&Ms to the left and right, meaning that 3 vaccines can be dropped at once. A modified fish bait machine has helped create the vaccine, which will consist of M&Ms smeared in vaccine-laden peanut butter. Machett said lab tests show that prairie dogs find the bait 'delicious', with a dye added to the mix reliably showing up on the animals' whiskers.\n\nOnly 300 black-footed ferrets remain in the US across a handful of isolated sites. The species was briefly thought to be extinct in 1981, only for a number of animals to be brought into captivity for breeding. The current population originates from just 7 ferrets that were selectively bred. Black-footed ferrets and prairie dogs have suffered population crashes due to disease, shooting and habitat loss. Many farmers still consider both species to be a pest, with some voicing their unhappiness at the M&M drone plan.\n\nHowever, Machett said most submissions during a public comment period were 'highly supportive' of the plan and he hopes that it will be operational by 1 September following final FWS approval. Other ferret populations in Arizona and Colorado will also be aided by the drones following the trial in Montana. 'It is the fastest, cheapest way to distribute the vaccine,' Machett said. 'We are hopeful this oral vaccine will be used to mitigate plague sites and treat tens of thousands of acres each year.\n\n'This is what the Endangered Species Act is all about - saving species, particularly those affected by human actions.'\n\n[Byline: Oliver Milman]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Plague is primarily a disease of wild rodents.

Prairie dog populations are cyclic, having population crashes that are caused in part by _Y. pestis_ infection. The pathogen does not disappear between the population crashes, but it only causes significant mortality under some environmental conditions and given high abundances and presence of alternative hosts, where transmission is enhanced and the condition of the animals is deteriorated.

Confirmatory testing was conducted at the Scientific Laboratory Division. This is the 1st human case of plague in New Mexico and in the USA in 2016.\n\n'We will conduct an environmental investigation at the teen's home to look for ongoing risk and to ensure the health of the immediate family and neighbors,' said Department of Health Secretary Designate Lynn Gallagher. 'Staff will go door-to-door to neighbors near the patient's home to inform them about plague found in the area and educate them on reducing their risk.'\n\nPlague is a bacterial disease of rodents and is generally transmitted to humans through the bites of infected fleas, but can also be transmitted by direct contact with infected animals, including rodents, wildlife and pets.\n\n'Late spring and summer are when we see most cases of plague, though they can occur throughout the year in New Mexico,' said Dr Paul Ettestad, public health veterinarian for the Department of Health. 'Sick or dead rodents and rabbits are being reported from many areas in the state so it is very important to take precautions to avoid rodents and their fleas which can expose you to plague. Pets that are allowed to roam and hunt can bring plague-infected fleas from dead rodents back into the home, putting you and your children at risk.'\n\nTo prevent plague, the Department of Health recommends:\n- avoid sick or dead rodents and rabbits, and their nests and burrows;\n- keep your pets from roaming and hunting;\n- talk to your veterinarian about using an appropriate flea control product on your pets as not all products are safe for cats, dogs, or your children;\n- clean up areas near the house where rodents could live, such as woodpiles, brush piles, junk, and abandoned vehicles;\n- sick pets should be examined promptly by a veterinarian;\n- see your doctor about any unexplained illness involving a sudden and severe fever;\n- put hay, wood, and compost piles as far as possible from your home; and\n- don't leave your pet's food and water where rodents can get to it.\n\nSymptoms of plague in humans include sudden onset of fever, chills, headache, and weakness. In most cases there is a painful swelling of the lymph node in the groin, armpit, or neck areas. Plague symptoms in cats and dogs are fever, lethargy, and loss of appetite. There may be a swelling in the lymph node under the jaw. Prompt diagnosis and appropriate antibiotic treatment can greatly reduce the risk of death. Physicians who suspect a patient may have plague should promptly report it to the Department of Health.\n\nIn New Mexico, there were 4 human plague cases in 2015 with one death.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nPaul Ettestad DVM\nPublic Health Veterinarian\nNew Mexico Department of Health\nUSA\n<Paul.Ettestad@state.nm.us>\n\n[ProMED-mail thanks Dr Ettestad for this post.

In recent decades, an average of 7 human plague cases have been reported each year (range: 1-17 cases per year) with 0-2 deaths.\n\nThe following was extracted from Prentice MB, Rahalison L: Plague.

It is important to note that 3 squirrels or fox squirrels, which often live in residential areas, are not of concern.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[It is great news to hear this cat is being successfully treated. This is a great success story.\n\nPlague is transmitted by fleas. There are several forms of plague in human beings: bubonic, septicemic, and pneumonic.\n\nPlague, caused by _Yersinia pestis_, is enzootic among rodents in the western United States. Humans can be infected through 1) the bite of an infected flea carried by a rodent or, rarely, other animals; 2) direct contact with contaminated tissues; or 3) in rare cases, inhalation of respiratory secretions from infected people or animals.\n\nPlague is a potential bioterrorism agent. Human infections are rare but can be life-threatening. The case fatality rate of plague depends on the clinical presentation (that is, bubonic, septicemic, or pneumonic) and timing of initiation of antibiotic therapy; if untreated, the case fatality rate is over 50 per cent for bubonic plague and approaches 100 per cent for pneumonic plague. Rapid laboratory identification can help guide therapy.\n\nDomestic cats and dogs can also contract plague from infective fleas. They may carry infected fleas home to their owners. Cats may serve as a direct source of infection. There are many flea treatments and repellents appropriate for pets available. Some products may be suitable for dogs but not cats, or may be suitable for an adult but not a younger animal. Be sure to consult your veterinarian, as some products may be toxic to cats, kittens, and puppies, even resulting in fatalities.\n\nClinical signs in pets involve a localized swelling, such as under the jaw in cats, but also in the inguinal region or under the front leg (the armpit, if you will), lethargy, anorexia, and fever. These clinical signs may be present in the dog as well. Swelling under the jaw in cats is frequently mistaken as a cat fight abscess. Please take your pet to a veterinarian if you notice any abnormalities.\n\nVeterinarians should protect themselves by wearing gloves when examining these swellings. A bubo that ruptures may infect the veterinarian or even the pet owner if the pet owner is the one palpating the swelling.\n\nAnother form of the disease is the respiratory form. Cats may acquire this form and can spread it to their owners or the veterinarians through infected expiratory droplets. People are also prone to the respiratory infection.\n\nYou should also be aware that the fleas that hitchhike into the home via a pet vehicle can also transmit disease to you, the owner, or caretaker of the pet. Sleeping in the same bed with dogs has been associated with plague in enzootic areas. Plague patients with no history of exposure to rodents can be infected by _Y. pestis_ if their pets carry infected rodent fleas into the home. Veterinarians always should recommend flea control to dog and cat owners.\n\nPlague is infamous for killing millions of people in Europe during the Middle Ages. Today, modern antibiotics are effective in treating plague, but without prompt treatment, the disease can cause serious illness or death. Presently, human plague infections continue to occur in the western United States, but significantly more cases occur in parts of Africa and Asia.\n\nParts of this comment have been excerpted from CDC.

Human contraction of plague is generally from flea bites, while human contraction of tularemia is from deer fly bites, Department of Health veterinarian Dr. Paul Ettestad said Mon [14 Jun 2016]. These illnesses also can be transmitted by direct contact with infected animals, including pets.\n\nEttestad said the contraction rate of both plague and tularemia this year 'is higher than average, but not on a record pace.' In New Mexico, plague and tularemia are more prevalent in the spring and early summer.\n\n'We are seeing recent die-offs of rabbits in several areas of New Mexico from both plague and tularemia,' Ettestad said. 'People can be exposed to plague when pets bring infected fleas back into the home, by caring for a sick pet without proper precautions, or by contact with rodents or fleas outdoors. Exposure to tularemia can occur from bites from deer flies or handling infected animals or pets which have been exposed,' he said.\n\nSymptoms of plague and tularemia in humans are similar and include sudden onset of fever, chills, headache, weakness, swollen lymph nodes and possible infection at the bite site, Ettestad said. Likewise, he noted, signs of plague and tularemia in cats and dogs are similar, and include fever, lethargy, loss of appetite and possible swelling in the lymph node under the jaw.\n\nThe only sure way to distinguish the difference between these is through laboratory testing, he said. With prompt diagnosis and appropriate antibiotic treatment, the fatality rate in people and pets can be greatly reduced. According to statistics compiled by the Department of Health for 2015, 4 people in New Mexico contracted plague, with 1 fatality in Santa Fe County, and 8 cases of tularemia were confirmed, with no fatalities. There were also 63 confirmed cases of tularemia in dogs and cats in 2015, and 18 confirmed pet plague cases.\n\n[Byline: Rick Nathanson]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Fleas and ticks are the guilty party in spreading these diseases to other animals, including our pets and us. Protecting our pets and ourselves from fleas and ticks is primary. Flea and tick collars around your ankles when hiking these areas can be helpful. For pets there are generally once-a-month treatments available that work very well.\n\nPlague is primarily a disease of wild rodents. It is caused by the bacterium _Yersinia pestis_, which is mainly spread by the bites of infectious fleas. The bacterium is not native to North America. When it was introduced, it became established in some rodent populations, with some species being particularly susceptible. Free-ranging carnivores, including feral cats, are particularly exposed to plague as they prey on its reservoir.\n\nTularemia is a bacterial septicemia that affects, aside from people, more than 250 species of wild and domestic mammals, birds, reptiles and fish. It is listed as a category A bioterrorism agent because of the potential for fatality, airborne dissemination, and societal disruption if released. The causative bacterium, _Francisella tularensis_, is a nonspore-forming, Gram-negative coccobacillus antigenically related to _Brucella_ spp.\n\nTularemia can be transmitted by aerosol, direct contact, ingestion, or arthropods. Inhalation of aerosolized organisms (in the laboratory or as an airborne agent in an act of bioterrorism) can produce a pneumonic form. Direct contact with, or ingestion of, infected carcasses of wild animals (such as cottontail rabbit) can produce the ulceroglandular, oculoglandular, oropharyngeal (local lesion with regional lymphadenitis), or typhoidal form. Immersion in or ingestion of contaminated water can result in infection in aquatic animals. Ticks can maintain infection transstadially [pathogen remains with the vector from one life stage ('stadium') to the next] and transovarially [transmission of a pathogen from an organism (as a tick) to its offspring by infection of eggs in its ovary], making them efficient reservoirs and vectors.\n\nThe commonest source of infection for people and herbivores is the bite of an infected tick, but people who prepare or eat improperly cooked wild game are also at increased risk. Dogs, cats, and other carnivores may acquire infection from ingestion of an infected carcass. Case reports have implicated cats as a source of infection in people. - Mod.TG\n\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/233.]", "summary": "A ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n \n\nSymptoms of plague and tularemia in humans are similar and include sudden onset of fever, chills, headache, weakness, swollen lymph nodes and possible infection at the bite site, Ettestad said.

This is the 2nd cat death within the last week thought to be connected to the bacterial infection, though the cats were owned by separate families. The most recent cat lived both indoors and outdoors, and had contact with ground squirrels before becoming ill. Family members and other household pets are being monitored to ensure the cat did not spread the infection. Final lab results will be available next week.\n\nThe cat lived approximately 2 miles [3.2 km] from Mountain Home in an area not previously identified with confirmed plague. 'We want to emphasize that plague is likely present at some level in ground squirrel populations throughout the sagebrush habitat in southern Idaho. With the known confirmed cases in these areas we want to people to be aware and be able to take appropriate steps to protect themselves and their pets from plague,' said State Wildlife Veterinarian Dr Mark Drew.\n\nPlague is transmitted through the bites of infected fleas and can cause serious illness to people and pets if not treated quickly. It also can be transmitted to people by direct contact with infected animals, including rodents, rabbits and pets. Common rodents that can become infected include ground squirrels, rats, voles, and mice. Tree squirrels in Idaho are not known to carry plague.\n\nPublic health officials urge everyone to take proper precautions to protect themselves and their pets against plague regardless of where they live in proximity to the latest area of impact. To prevent plague in humans:\n- see your doctor immediately about any unexplained illness with a severe fever if you have been in the affected area;\n- avoid picking up or touching dead animals; wear gloves if you must handle dead animals;\n- do not let pets sleep in bed with you. This has been shown to increase your risk of getting plague;\n- clean up areas near the house where rodents could live, such as woodpiles, brush piles, junk and abandoned vehicles;\n- put hay, wood, and compost piles as far as possible from your home;\n- wear long-sleeved shirts and long pants;\n- use DEET on clothing in accordance with label instructions or wear clothing pre-treated with permethrin;\n- use DEET on exposed skin, in accordance with label instructions.\n\nPlague prevention in pets:\n- do not let your pets hunt or roam in the affected area;\n- talk to your veterinarian about using an appropriate flea control product on your pets;\n- sick pets should be examined promptly by a veterinarian;\n- don't leave your pet's food and water where rodents can get to it.\n\nSymptoms of plague in humans\n----------------------------\nSymptoms of plague in humans include sudden onset of fever, chills, headache, and weakness. In most cases there is a painful swelling of the lymph node in the groin, armpit or neck areas. Physicians who suspect plague should promptly report it to their local public health district.\n\nSigns of plague in animals\n--------------------------\nPlague signs in cats and dogs are fever, lethargy, and loss of appetite. There may be a swelling in the lymph node under the jaw. With prompt diagnosis and appropriate antibiotic treatment, the fatality rate in people and pets can be greatly reduced.\n\nAmong pets, cats are highly susceptible to plague and may be an indicator that plague is in the area. If plague is suspected, any type of animal or human should be treated by a health professional immediately.\n\nBackground\n----------\nIn late May [2016], the Idaho Department of Fish and Game collected dead ground squirrels from several areas in Ada County and submitted them to public health laboratories for testing. The laboratory found the plague bacterium. Ground squirrel populations with plague can experience high mortality, sometimes evidenced by large numbers of carcasses. At this time, plague has been detected in ground squirrels -- not tree squirrels. Subsequently, a cat in neighboring Elmore County died of plague.\n\nPlague activity can increase in the spring and summer months when rodents are more active. However, wildlife experts say ground squirrels begin hibernating in late June/early July, at which time the threat of plague will decrease.\n\nArea of impact where plague has been identified in ground squirrels to date. Please note that rodents outside of this area may carry plague and prevention efforts should be heeded.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Plague, caused by _Yersinia pestis_, is enzootic among rodents in the western United States. Humans can be infected through 1) the bite of an infected flea carried by a rodent or, rarely, other animals; 2) direct contact with contaminated tissues; or 3) in rare cases, inhalation of respiratory secretions from infected people or animals.\n\nPlague is a potential bioterrorism agent. Human infections are rare but can be life-threatening. The case fatality rate of plague depends on the clinical presentation (that is, bubonic, septicemic, or pneumonic) and timing of initiation of antibiotic therapy; if untreated, the case fatality rate is over 50 per cent for bubonic plague and approaches 100 per cent for pneumonic plague. Rapid laboratory identification can help guide therapy.\n\nDomestic cats and dogs can also contract plague from infective fleas. They may carry infected fleas home to their owners. Cats may serve as a direct source of infection. There are many flea treatments and repellents appropriate for pets available. Some products may be suitable for dogs but not cats, or may be suitable for an adult but not a younger animal. Be sure to consult your veterinarian, as some products may be toxic to cats, kittens, and puppies, even resulting in fatalities.\n\nClinical signs in pets involve a localized swelling, such as under the jaw in cats, but also in the inguinal region or under the front leg (the armpit, if you will), lethargy, anorexia, and fever. Please take your pet to a veterinarian if you notice any abnormalities.\n\nVeterinarians should protect themselves by wearing gloves when examining these swellings. A bubo that ruptures may infect the veterinarian or even the pet owner if the pet owner is the one palpating the swelling.\n\nAnother form of the disease is the respiratory form. Cats may acquire this form and can spread it to their owners or the veterinarians through infected expiratory droplets. People are also prone to the respiratory infection.\n\nYou should also be aware that the fleas that hitchhike into your home via a pet vehicle can also transmit disease to you, the owner, or caretaker of the pet. Sleeping in the same bed with dogs has been associated with plague in enzootic areas. Plague patients with no history of exposure to rodents can be infected by _Y. pestis_ if their pets carry infected rodent fleas into the home. Veterinarians always should recommend flea control to dog and cat owners.\n\nParts of this comment have been excerpted from: CDC. Notes from the field: 2 cases of human plague -- Oregon, 2010.

Idaho public health and Idaho Fish and Game officials are asking people to take precautions as outdoor summer activities shift into high gear over the long Memorial Day [30 May 2016] weekend.\n\nLast year [2015], plague was confirmed in ground squirrels in the same general areas of southern Idaho. Plague can circulate in wild animal populations every year. Confirmatory laboratory tests are being conducted, with results expected next week [week of 1 Jun 2016].\n\nPlague is a bacterial disease of rodents that is transmitted through the bites of infected fleas and can cause serious illness to people and pets if not treated quickly. It also can be transmitted to people by direct contact with infected animals, including rodents, rabbits and pets. Common rodents that can become infected include ground squirrels, rats, voles and mice. Tree squirrels in Idaho are not known to carry plague.\n\n'Just like last year [2015], our investigation began in May after hearing reports from people finding dead ground squirrels in the desert southeast of Boise,' State Wildlife Veterinarian Dr Mark Drew said. 'We hope to have confirmation of these results soon and will keep the public up to date as we learn more.'\n\nPeople can greatly reduce their risk of becoming infected with plague by taking simple precautions, including avoiding contact with wild rodents, their fleas and rodent carcasses. Health officials recommend:\n- do not feed rodents in picnic or campground areas and never handle sick or dead rodents;\n- keep your pets from roaming and hunting ground squirrels or other rodents in affected desert areas;\n- talk to your veterinarian about using an appropriate flea control product on pets as not all products are safe for cats, dogs or children;\n- clean up areas near your home where rodents can live, such as woodpiles;\n- sick pets should be examined promptly by a veterinarian, especially if they may have had contact with sick or dead rodents in the desert areas south and east of Boise;\n- see your doctor if you have any unexplained illness involving a sudden and severe fever after being in a plague-impacted area;\n- put hay, wood, and compost piles as far as possible from your home;\n- don't leave pet food and water where rodents or other wild animals can access them.\n\nSymptoms of plague in humans include sudden onset of fever, chills, headache, and weakness. In most cases there is a painful swelling of the lymph node in the groin, armpit, or neck areas. Plague clinical signs in cats and dogs are fever, lethargy, and loss of appetite, with possible swelling in the lymph node under the jaw. With prompt diagnosis and appropriate antibiotic treatment, the fatality rate in people and pets can be greatly reduced. Physicians who suspect plague should promptly report it to their local public health district.\n\nIdaho Fish and Game is interested in reports of multiple (greater than 5) dead ground squirrels, yellow-bellied marmots (aka 'rock-chucks'), voles, cottontail rabbits, or jackrabbits. Please do not report single mortalities; observations of multiple mortalities are a greater indicator of possible plague activity. If people find groups of 5 or more dead animals listed above, they should not touch them, but should report the location to the Idaho Department of Fish and Game at https://idfg.idaho.gov/plague. All reports are reviewed and appropriately handled, however, not all people submitting reports will be contacted for follow-up.\n\nSince 1940, only 5 human cases of plague have been reported in Idaho. The last 2 cases reported in Idaho occurred in 1991 and 1992, with both patients fully recovering. In 2015, a dog tested positive for plague after ground squirrel exposure. The dog recovered after medical treatment.\n\nFor more information:\n- General overview: http://www.cdc.gov/plague/\n- FAQs: http://www.cdc.gov/plague/faq/index.html\n- Protect yourself from plague fact sheet: http://www.cdc.gov/plague/resources/235098_Plaguefactsheet_508.pdf\n- Idaho Department of Fish and Game: http://fishandgame.idaho.gov\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[2] Domestic cat\nDate: Fri 3 Jun 2016\nSource: Idaho Elmore County Health Department Announcement\nhttp://www.cdhd.idaho.gov/pdfs/News/2016/06-03-16%20Pet-Cat-Likely-Died-of-Plague.pdf\n\n\nElmore County [Idaho] Cat Likely Died of Plague\nGround Squirrel Plague Area of Impact Expanded to the East\n----------------------------------------------------------\nLaboratory tests indicate an Elmore County cat likely died from plague.

No human cases have been identified. All 3 cats lived in Cody, off the South Fork Road. The illness was confirmed in the 1st pet by the Wyoming State Veterinary Laboratory in Laramie on 12 Apr 2016, with confirmation of the 3rd on 20 Apr 2016.\n\n'Plague is a serious bacterial infection that can be deadly for pets and for people if not treated promptly with antibiotics,' said Dr Karl Musgrave, state public health veterinarian with WDH. 'The disease can be transmitted to humans from ill animals and by fleas coming from infected animals. We want people to know of the potential threat in the area the cats were from as well as across the state. Dogs can also become ill and transmit the disease.'\n\n'While the disease is rare in humans, it's safe to assume that the risk for plague exists all around Wyoming,' Musgrave said. Six human cases of plague have been confirmed in Wyoming since 1978 with the last one reported in 2008. There are an average of 7 human cases across the nation each year.\n\nPrecautions Musgrave recommends to help prevent plague infections include:\n- avoid unnecessary exposure to rodents;\n- avoid contact with rodent carcasses;\n- avoid areas with unexplained rodent die-offs;\n- use insect repellent on boots and pants when in areas that might have fleas;\n- use flea repellent on pets, and properly dispose of rodents pets may bring home.\n\nPlague signs in animals can include enlarged lymph glands; swelling in the neck, face or around the ears; fever; chills; lack of energy; coughing; vomiting; diarrhea and dehydration. Ill animals should be taken to a veterinarian.\n\nPlague symptoms in people can include fever, swollen and tender lymph glands, extreme exhaustion, headache, chills, coughing, difficulty breathing, abdominal pain, vomiting and diarrhea. People who are ill should seek professional medical attention.\n\nMore information about plague is available online from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention at http://www.cdc.gov/plague/.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Plague is transmitted by fleas. There are several forms of plague in human beings: bubonic, septicemic and pneumonic.\n\nPlague, caused by _Yersinia pestis_, is enzootic among rodents in the western United States. Humans can be infected through 1) the bite of an infected flea carried by a rodent or, rarely, other animals; 2) direct contact with contaminated tissues; or 3) in rare cases, inhalation of respiratory secretions from infected people or animals.\n\nPlague is a potential bioterrorism agent. Human infections are rare but can be life-threatening. The case fatality rate of plague depends on the clinical presentation (that is, bubonic, septicemic, or pneumonic) and timing of initiation of antibiotic therapy; if untreated, the case fatality rate is over 50 per cent for bubonic plague and approaches 100 per cent for pneumonic plague. Rapid laboratory identification can help guide therapy.\n\nDomestic cats and dogs can also contract plague from infective fleas. They may carry infected fleas home to their owners. Cats may serve as a direct source of infection. There are many flea treatments and repellents appropriate for pets available. Some products may be suitable for dogs but not cats, or may be suitable for an adult but not a younger animal. Be sure to consult your veterinarian, as some products may be toxic to cats, kittens, and puppies, even resulting in fatalities.\n\nClinical signs in pets involve a localized swelling, such as under the jaw in cats, but also in the inguinal region or under the front leg (the armpit, if you will), lethargy, anorexia, and fever. These clinical signs may be present in the dog as well. Swelling under the jaw in cats is frequently mistaken as a cat fight abscess. Please take your pet to a veterinarian if you notice any abnormalities.\n\nVeterinarians should protect themselves by wearing gloves when examining these swellings. A bubo that ruptures may infect the veterinarian or even the pet owner if the pet owner is the one palpating the swelling.\n\nAnother form of the disease is the respiratory form. Cats may acquire this form and can spread it to their owners or the veterinarians through infected expiratory droplets. People are also prone to the respiratory infection.\n\nYou should also be aware that the fleas that hitchhike into the home via a pet vehicle can also transmit disease to you, the owner, or caretaker of the pet. Sleeping in the same bed with dogs has been associated with plague in enzootic areas. Plague patients with no history of exposure to rodents can be infected by _Y. pestis_ if their pets carry infected rodent fleas into the home. Veterinarians always should recommend flea control to dog and cat owners.\n\nPlague is infamous for killing millions of people in Europe during the Middle Ages.

The plague bacterium (_Yersinia pestis_) is transmitted by fleas and cycles naturally among wild rodents. Plague can also infect humans and their pets. Plague can be treated successfully with antimicrobials, but an infected person must be treated promptly. Anyone who has been exposed to the illness can be treated with antibiotics before developing symptoms.\n\nPlague is most often transmitted through bites of infected fleas. It can also be contracted by touching or skinning infected animals (coyotes, squirrels, rats, prairie dogs, and rabbits) or inhaling droplets from the cough of an infected person or animal (especially sick cats).

There are several forms of plague in human beings: bubonic, septicemic and pneumonic.\n\nPlague, caused by _Yersinia pestis_, is enzootic among rodents in the western United States. Humans can be infected through 1) the bite of an infected flea carried by a rodent or, rarely, other animals; 2) direct contact with contaminated tissues; or 3) in rare cases, inhalation of respiratory secretions from infected people or animals.\n\nPlague is a potential bioterrorism agent. Human infections are rare but can be life-threatening. The case fatality rate of plague depends on the clinical presentation (that is, bubonic, septicemic, or pneumonic) and timing of initiation of antibiotic therapy; if untreated, the case fatality rate is over 50 per cent for bubonic plague and approaches 100 per cent for pneumonic plague. Rapid laboratory identification can help guide therapy.\n\nDomestic cats and dogs can also contract plague from infective fleas. They may carry infected fleas home to their owners. Cats may serve as a direct source of infection. There are many flea treatments and repellents appropriate for pets available. Some products may be suitable for dogs but not cats, or may be suitable for an adult but not a younger animal. Be sure to consult your veterinarian, as some products may be toxic to cats, kittens, and puppies, even resulting in fatalities.\n\nClinical signs in pets involve a localized swelling, such as under the jaw in cats, but also in the inguinal region or under the front leg (the armpit, if you will), lethargy, anorexia, and fever. These clinical signs may be present in the dog as well. Swelling under the jaw in cats is frequently mistaken as a cat fight abscess.. Please take your pet to a veterinarian if you notice any abnormalities.\n\nVeterinarians should protect themselves by wearing gloves when examining these swellings. A bubo that ruptures may infect the veterinarian or even the pet owner if the pet owner is the one palpating the swelling.\n\nAnother form of the disease is the respiratory form. Cats may acquire this form and can spread it to their owners or the veterinarians through infected expiratory droplets. People are also prone to the respiratory infection.\n\nYou should also be aware that the fleas that hitchhike into the home via a pet vehicle can also transmit disease to you, the owner, or caretaker of the pet. Sleeping in the same bed with dogs has been associated with plague in enzootic areas. Plague patients with no history of exposure to rodents can be infected by _Y. pestis_ if their pets carry infected rodent fleas into the home. Veterinarians always should recommend flea control to dog and cat owners.\n\nParts of this comment have been excerpted from: CDC. Notes from the field: two cases of human plague -- Oregon, 2010.

The bacterial disease is spread to people who have been bitten by infected rodent fleas, the WHO says.\n\nEfforts to curb the spread of the disease are being impeded by a build-up of garbage in Antananarivo amid a dispute between the municipality and the national government over who is responsible for waste management in the city.\n\n[Byline: Fanja Razafimahatratra]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Plague is caused by the _Yersinia pestis_ bacillus, carried by rat fleas. At the start of the rainy season, currently, rats flee the sewers of Madagascar in massive numbers and take refuge in people's cottages. Care must be taken in any rodent eradication program to ensure that a flea-killing compound is part of the plan. Just as in a natural rodent die-off from _Y. pestis_, the fleas will seek alternate hosts, that is, humans.\n\nThe following paragraph is from 1998 (Chanteau S, Ratsifasoamanana L, Rasoamanana B, et al: Plague, a Reemerging Disease in Madagascar. Emerg Infect Dis 1998; 4(1): 101-4; http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/4/1/98-0114_article.htm).\n\n'Between 1930 and 1990, bubonic plague had 'virtually disappeared' on the island due to efficient pest-control and good health management. However since 1990, an annual 200 cases are being reported, and bubonic plague takes on epidemic form, especially in the port of Mahajanga, each year. In the capital city of Antananarivo, more cases are also being notified each year since 1990. Madagascar (pop. 13 million) has accounted for 45 percent of all the cases of plague in Africa.'\n\nFatalities related to plague usually are caused by spread of the organism from the bubo (the very painful infected lymph node which drains the area where the flea bite occurred) to the bloodstream. The bacteremia can cause a coagulopathy, producing the purpura seen in the 'black plague' and also spread to the lungs causing a hemorrhagic pneumonia. It is the pneumonia that can facilitate person-to-person transmission.\n\nMadagascar was the location of the isolation of multi-antimicrobial resistant _Y. pestis_ in 1995 (Galimand M, Guiyoule A, Gerbaud G, et al: Multidrug resistance in _Yersinia pestis_ mediated by a transferable plasmid.

The geographical distribution of the disease is very focalized. Occasionally, the pathogen _Yersinia pestis_ can infect humans through infected flea bites. Human plague is a serious disease, particularly in its septicaemic and pneumonic forms. The pneumonic form, invariably fatal unless treated early, is especially contagious and can trigger terrifying epidemics through direct person-to-person contact. In these circumstances, plague is simultaneously a medical and a public health emergency.\n\nBetween 1 Jan 2010 and 31 Dec 2015, 3248 cases of plague in humans were reported, resulting in 584 deaths (Table 1) [for Table, see source URL above. - Mod.LL]. The principal animal reservoir (which differs from region to region) and local socioeconomic conditions are determinants of the epidemiological characteristics of the disease and the risk of transmission to humans. Plague is a disease of poverty in Africa, South America, and India, where the animal reservoir essentially comprises commensal rodents, but tends to be a sporadic disease associated with outdoor occupations in the other endemic regions.\n\nAfrica\n------\nIn Africa, 4 countries still regularly report cases.\n\nMadagascar is the most seriously affected country in the world. The surveillance system is relatively effective, thanks to the support of the national Pasteur Institute. Thus, specimens are taken from 95 percent of suspected cases and nearly 55 percent of these are confirmed as plague cases. Incidence has declined in the last 2 years but there has been an increase in the overall case fatality rate (23 percent in 2015) associated with the higher frequency of pneumonic forms (23.3 percent). This increase in serious forms of the disease is symptomatic of the deteriorating fabric of the health system as a result of the recent social and political crisis in the country. In 2014, one case of pneumonic plague (with a subsequently fatal outcome) was confirmed in the capital, Antananarivo. The rapid response of the health authorities fortunately prevented the emergence of any secondary cases.\n\nThe Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) has seen incidence rates collapse in recent years, but it is unlikely that this indicates a decrease in real terms. The 2 endemic health districts with a population of 1.9 million are located in the north-east of the country, a troubled region where the surveillance system is coming under increasing strain. In addition to sporadic cases, the region is regularly affected by epidemics affecting dozens of people: in 2014, for example, there was an epidemic of bubonic plague with a case-fatality rate of 8.7 percent and another of pneumonic plague with a case-fatality rate of more than 41 percent.\n\nUganda shares the same plague focus as the DRC and reports cases every year in Arua region. 30 percent of these cases are confirmed by laboratory diagnosis.\n\nAt the end of 2014, an epidemic of bubonic plague occurred in Mbule district in the Manyara region of the United Republic of Tanzania, resulting in the deaths of 5 of the 38 people affected. None of the cases were confirmed using international standards, however.\n\nIt should be noted that no cases have been reported in North Africa, a region that witnessed several re-emergent outbreaks in the previous decade.\n\nThe Americas\n------------\nIn the Americas, Peru regularly reports cases in 4 regions in the north-west of the country, where new foci emerged in 2013. These are essentially sporadic cases of bubonic plague associated with farming activities in rural areas. The return of the El Nino weather pattern in 2016 might go hand in hand with a recrudescence of plague, as has been noted on previous occasions.\n\nIn the western United States of America (USA), plague circulates among wild rodents in rural and semi-rural areas, resulting in several cases every year. Humans are regularly infected through contact with domestic animals (cats or dogs). In 2014, 3 people in Colorado developed pneumonic plague following exposure to a sick animal and a fourth person might have been infected through contact with one of these patients, making this the first possible case of person-to-person transmission recorded in the USA since 1924.\n\nAsia\n----\nIt is thought that plague originated in Central Asia, and this region is still the biggest natural focus of the disease. However, the at-risk population is restricted to breeders and hunters because the reservoirs consist mainly of gerbils in the steppe and marmots in mountainous areas. Consequently, the risk of transmission to humans is very low and outbreaks of the disease in people are totally sporadic.\n\nTwo marmot hunters contracted bubonic plague, one in Kyrgyzstan in 2013, the other in the Russian Federation in 2014. Kyrgyzstan had seen no cases of human plague since 1981, and in the Gorno-Altaisk mountains in the Russian Federation, this was the 1st case since 1961.\n\nMongolia and China sporadically report similar cases.\n\nDiscussion\n----------\nBy simply monitoring the incidence of human plague cases, we can only get a partial picture of the true extent of circulation of the microorganism in nature, and hence of the risk to people. Among endemic countries that have reported no cases in the period 2010-2015, some, for example India or Kazakhstan, carry out planned and regular entomological and zoological surveillance activities. But this surveillance is expensive and complicated to maintain, and is very often neglected in the absence of any human cases.\n\nIn many endemic countries, it is hard to obtain detailed knowledge about the status or development of natural foci. The interpretation that should be given to the sudden emergence of a case of human plague, in some places decades after the most recent outbreak, can therefore present special challenges.\n\nSurveillance of circulating strains of _Y. pestis_ has revealed no evidence of new resistance to antibiotics.\n\nThe challenge in 2015 remains that of ensuring early treatment and hence diagnosis of plague, both clinically and in terms of laboratory testing. The use of rapid diagnostic tests has made laboratory confirmation much easier, but this method is still not being routinely employed. Some of the cases reported in Africa might not fit the definition of probable or confirmed cases, but the information that would enable us to make a determination is not available.\n\nMoreover, given that total incidence does not exceed a few hundred cases and as the endemic areas are highly localized, minor changes in surveillance in a particular administrative region or even in a particular health district can significantly affect national and even global data.\n\nAnnual variations in incidence should be treated with caution.\n\nTo what extent is the reported global incidence a reflection of the actual plague situation?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nA number of countries have demonstrated their capacity to detect and confirm isolated and completely unexpected cases following decades of epidemiological silence (Kyrgyzstan in 2013 and the Russian Federation in 2014). It is not unlikely that some cases escape surveillance, particularly in Africa and South America. Yet it is scarcely probable that these cases would have a significant impact on the rate of global incidence: human plague is still a rare and serious disease which, in its pneumonic form, triggers epidemics that make headlines because of their high case-fatality rate.\n\nThe downward trend in global incidence observable in recent years therefore appears to mirror the reality. In the absence of systematic global surveillance of natural foci, it is not possible to say that this development is related to changes in the way that the microorganism is circulating in the environment. Moreover, there has been no significant improvement in prevention.\n\nThe role of improved living conditions cannot be ruled out, but it could also be a natural cyclical development as already seen in the past. Whatever the explanation, the human plague burden cannot be gauged solely by the number of cases or deaths. In the past 15 years, violent epidemics of pneumonic plague and the emergence and re-emergence of the disease in urban areas have continually fuelled public anxiety and mobilized the international community.\n\nIn the collective unconscious and beyond the epidemiological reality, plague is still seen as a scourge of humanity in 2016.\n\n[Byline: E Bertherat]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[2015 was a 'banner year' for _Yersinia pestis_ infections in the USA, with now 16 cases and 4 deaths.

The case was confirmed at the Department of Health's Scientific Laboratory Division. This is the 4th human case of plague in New Mexico in 2015 and the 2nd in Santa Fe County. The woman was hospitalized and is back home recovering.

The dead animal was found at the Kiva picnic area on 17 Aug [2015]. So far, health officials are not aware of any human contact with the infected squirrel.\n\n'It's something that we don't see in large pandemics in the modern era of antibiotics,' explained Dr Randall Todd of the Washoe County Health District. 'But we do still worry about it a little bit in the western and southwestern states because it lives endemically in some of the rodent populations.' Doctor Todd referred to a map from the CDC, which shows where human cases of plague have been reported between 1970 and 2012. Several were right here in northern Nevada.\n\nThe disease is carried by fleas, and spread by rodents, and other small animals like rabbits and prairie dogs. Dr. Todd said that if one of these animals allows you to get close, that's unusual behavior. They may be sick. He said don't touch it, and don't let your dogs get close either.\n\n'If you have pets like dogs or cats that are allowed to roam free where they might be exposed to fleas, then you would probably want to take some steps to do flea prevention on your pets, and you probably would not want them to sleep on or in your bed,' he says. According to information from the CDC, human infection is rare. Fewer than 20 cases have been reported per year over the past 15 years, but it can be fatal.\n\nIf you are exposed, you may have a fever, headache, and painful swollen lymph nodes. Seek medical attention right away.\n\nTo reduce your chances of catching the disease, El Dorado County health officials say don't feed squirrels or other wild rodents.

The 1st case was identified on 17 Aug 2015 in a rural township in Moramanga district [Alaotra-Mangoro region, Toamasina province]. The case passed away on 19 Aug 2015. As of 30 Aug 2015, 14 cases, including 10 deaths, were reported. All confirmed cases are of the pneumonic form. Since 27 Aug 2015, no new cases have been reported from the affected or neighboring districts.\n\nPublic health response\n----------------------\nThe national task force has been activated to manage the outbreak. With support from partners -- including WHO and the Pasteur Institute of Madagascar -- the government of Madagascar is implementing thorough public health measures, including active case and contact finding, provision of chemoprophylaxis, case and contact management, enhanced epidemiologic surveillance, infection prevention and control (house disinfection), vector control activities, social mobilization, coordination and resource mobilization.\n\nWHO risk assessment\n-------------------\nWHO does not recommend any travel or trade restriction based on the current information available. In urban areas, such as Antananarivo, the surveillance of epidemic risk indicators is highly recommended for the implementation of preventive vector control activities.\n\nBackground\n----------\nPlague is a bacterial disease caused by _Yersinia pestis_, which primarily affects wild rodents. It is spread from one rodent to another by fleas. Humans bitten by an infected flea usually develop a bubonic form of plague, which produces the characteristic plague bubo (a swelling of the lymph node). If the bacteria reach the lungs, the patient develops pneumonia (pneumonic plague), which is then transmissible from person to person through infected droplets spread by coughing. If diagnosed early, bubonic plague can be successfully treated with antibiotics. Pneumonic plague, on the other hand, is one of the most deadly infectious diseases; patients can die 24 hours after infection. The mortality rate depends on how soon treatment is started, but is always very high.\n\nThe current outbreak follows another plague outbreak that occurred in Madagascar between 2014 and 2015, with a peak in November 2014 when over 335 cases and 79 deaths were reported.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Plague is caused by the _Yersinia pestis_ bacillus, which in Madagascar is carried by rat fleas. At the start of the rainy season, currently, rats flee the sewers of Madagascar in massive numbers and take refuge in people's cottages.\n\nThe following paragraph of this posting is from Chanteau S, Ratsifasoamanana L, Rasoamanana B, et al: Plague, a Reemerging Disease in Madagascar. Emerg Infect Dis 1998; 4(1): 101-4; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2627662/pdf/9452403.pdf:\n\nBetween 1930 and 1990, bubonic plague had 'virtually disappeared' on the island due to efficient pest-control and good health-management. However since 1990, an annual 200 cases are being reported and bubonic plague takes on epidemic form especially in the port of Mahajanga each year. In the capital city of Antananarivo more cases are also being notified each year since 1990. Madagascar (pop. 13 million) [pop. 22.92 million, 2013] has accounted for 45 percent of all the cases of plague in Africa.\n\nFatalities related to plague usually are caused by spread of the organism from the bubo (the very painful infected lymph node which drains the area where the flea bite occurred) to the bloodstream. The bacteremia can cause a coagulopathy producing the purpura seen in the 'Black Plague' and also spread to the lung causing a hemorrhagic pneumonia.

This is the 1st Utah resident to be diagnosed with plague since 2009.\n\nPlague is a rare, life-threatening, flea-borne illness that is maintained in a rodent-flea transmission cycle. Species such as prairie dogs, black footed-ferrets, squirrels, and rabbits are especially susceptible and experience high mortality upon infection. Plague is naturally occurring in Utah, and typically seen in the prairie dog populations each year.\n\nSince 1 Apr 2015, a total of 12 cases of human plague have been reported in residents of 7 states: Arizona (2), California (1), Colorado (4), Georgia (1), New Mexico (2), Oregon (1), and Utah (1). The 2 cases in Georgia and the California resident have been linked to exposures at or near Yosemite National Park in California.\n\nThe investigation continues into the circumstances surrounding the Utah [resident's] illness. The patient may have contracted the disease from a flea, or contact a dead animal. At this time, public health officials believe there was no travel history indicating that the Utah resident traveled anywhere else where plague is common.\n\nHuman plague occurs in areas where the bacteria are present in wild rodent populations. The risks are generally highest in rural and semi-rural areas, including campsites and homes that provide food and shelter for various ground squirrels, chipmunks, and wood rats, or other areas where you may encounter rodents.\n\nPlague is a very serious illness, but it is treatable with commonly available antimicrobials. The earlier a patient seeks medical care and receives treatment that is appropriate for plague, the better the chance for a full recovery. Some common symptoms may include fever, headache, chills, and weakness. If you are experiencing symptoms, seek immediate medical attention.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[During 2001-2012, the annual number of human plague cases reported in the USA ranged from 1-17 (median = 3 cases). A map of the location of plague cases in the USA from 1970-2012 can be found at http://www.cdc.gov/plague/maps/. Most case reports are around the Four Corners area of the southwest where Utah, Colorado, New Mexico, and Arizona come together. This seems clear in New Mexico and Arizona where most cases occur in the northern parts of the states but somewhat in Colorado and clearly in Utah, the cases are less concentrated in the southern parts.\n\nAs outlined by the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) and quoted in ProMED-mail post 20120601.1153277: 'Death from bubonic plague occurs after the bacterium _Yersinia pestis_ escapes from the infected bubo into the bloodstream (septicemic plague) causing the manifestations of the sepsis syndrome. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) with subsequent cutaneous hemorrhage may well have been what was called the 'Black Death' in the Middle Ages. The bacterium can spread to the lungs, causing a secondary plague pneumonia (secondary to the bacteremia), or to the meninges, causing a plague meningitis. Both of these events have a high case fatality rate and the secondary plague pneumonia is the way the infection spreads (by aerosol) from person to person.\n\n'The typical sign of the most common form of human plague is a swollen and very tender lymph gland, accompanied by pain. The swollen gland is called a 'bubo.' Bubonic plague should be suspected when a person develops a swollen gland, fever, chills, headache, and extreme exhaustion, and has a history of possible exposure to infected rodents, rabbits, or fleas. A person usually becomes ill with bubonic plague 2-6 days after being infected.\n\n'When bubonic plague is left untreated, plague bacteria invade the bloodstream. As the plague bacteria multiply in the bloodstream, they spread rapidly throughout the body and cause a severe and often fatal condition. Infection of the lungs with the plague bacterium causes the pneumonic form of plague, a severe respiratory illness. The infected person may experience high fever, chills, cough, and breathing difficulty and may expel bloody sputum. If plague patients are not given specific antibiotic therapy, the disease can progress rapidly to death.

The cases in Georgia and California residents have been linked to exposures at or near Yosemite National Park in the southern Sierra Nevada Mountains of California. Nine of the 11 patients were male; median age was 52 years (range = 14-79 years). Three patients aged 16, 52, and 79 years died.\n\nPlague is a rare, life-threatening, flea-borne zoonosis caused by the bacterium _Yersinia pestis_. During 2001-2012, the annual number of human plague cases reported in the USA ranged from 1-17 (median = 3 cases) (1). It is unclear why the number of cases in 2015 is higher than usual. Plague circulates among wild rodents and their fleas in rural and semirural areas in the western USA (2). Transmission to humans occurs through the bite of infected fleas, direct contact with infected body fluids or tissues, or inhalation of respiratory droplets from ill persons or animals, including ill domesticated cats and dogs (3). The usual incubation period between exposure and illness onset is 2-6 days.\n\nIn humans, plague is characterized by the sudden onset of fever and malaise, which can be accompanied by abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. There are 3 main forms of plague, depending upon the route of infection. Bubonic plague, resulting from the bite of an infected flea, accounts for approximately 80-85 percent of cases; patients develop a 'bubo,' a painful swelling of one or several lymph nodes that progresses during the 1st few days of illness. Septicemic plague, accounting for approximately 10 percent of cases, can occur from a flea bite or from direct contact with infectious fluids; infection spreads directly through the bloodstream with no localizing signs. Primary pneumonic plague, occurring in approximately 3 percent of plague patients, results from aerosol exposure to infective droplets and is characterized by a fulminant primary pneumonia. Secondary pneumonic plague can result from the spread of _Y. pestis_ to the lungs in patients with untreated bubonic or septicemic infection.\n\nThe mortality rate for untreated plague has ranged from 66 percent to 93 percent; however, in the antimicrobial era, mortality has been reduced to approximately 16 percent (4). Prompt treatment with antimicrobials such as aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones, or doxycycline greatly improves outcome (4).\n\nHealth care providers should consider the diagnosis of plague in any patient with compatible signs or symptoms, residence or travel in the western USA, and recent proximity to rodent habitats or direct contact with rodents or ill domestic animals. Suspicion of plague should prompt 1) collection of blood, bubo aspirate, or sputum samples for _Y. pestis_ diagnostic testing; 2) implementation of isolation and respiratory droplet precautions for patients with respiratory involvement; 3) immediate antimicrobial treatment (before laboratory confirmation); and 4) notification of public health officials. _Y. pestis_-specific testing is available at state health laboratories. Recommendations for diagnostic testing and antibiotic treatment are available at http://www.cdc.gov/plague/healthcare/clinicians.html. Misidentification of _Y. pestis_ as _Pseudomonas luteola_ and other organisms through the use of automated bacterial identification systems has been reported (5).\n\nPersons engaging in outdoor activities in areas where plague is endemic should wear long pants when possible and use insect repellent on clothing and skin. Persons also should avoid direct contact with ill or dead animals and never feed squirrels, chipmunks, or other rodents. In addition, pet owners should regularly use flea control products on their pets and consult a veterinarian if their pet is ill. Rodent habitat can be reduced around the home by removing brush, clutter, and potential rodent food sources such as garbage or pet food. Additional information on prevention of plague is available at http://www.cdc.gov/plague/prevention/index.html.\n\nReferences\n--------\n1.

The California Department of Public Health announced 'a presumptive positive case of plague' involving someone from Georgia who had spent time in early August 2015 in the state.\n\nBefore feeling sick, this person visited Yosemite, the Sierra National Forest, and nearby areas. No other details were given, including who the person is, their current medical condition, and where exactly he or she stayed overnight. Nor is it certain this person contracted the plague while in California.\n\nStill, the report suggests that 2 people recently in California have a disease best known for killing millions centuries ago, which, despite all the advances of modern science, remains a real, present-day problem. In addition to the California cases, 2 people contracted the plague this year [2015] in Colorado. Both of them, a teenager in Larimer County and the other an adult in Pueblo County, died of the disease.\n\nNews of the latest probable plague case in California comes just after Yosemite National Park shut down its Tuolumne Meadows Campground after authorities determined 2 dead squirrels had the plague. The campground will be closed from Mon 17 Aug - Fri 21 Aug 2015. It is one of 13 around Yosemite, which, with about 4 million visitors, is the 3rd most visited U.S. national park. Staff will treat the Tuolumne Meadows site with deltamethrin, a chemical that kills fleas that spread the plague, according to the park.\n\nThe 1st Yosemite campground to get the once over was Crane Flat, which is where a child -- after visiting nearby Stanislaus National Forest -- had stayed in mid-July 2015. In that case, an insecticide that contained deltamethrin was used on rodent burrows on 10-11 Aug 2015. That child is recovering from the plague, and no other members of the camping party have reported any related symptoms, according to authorities.\n\nUntil now, California hadn't had an instance of human plague since 2006, when there were 3 cases in Mono, Los Angeles and Kern counties, according to state health officer Dr. Karen Smith. There have been 42 cases in the state since 1970, of which 9 proved fatal.

Plague is a highly infectious bacterial disease carried by various types of wild rodents and is transmitted primarily by flea bites. Squirrels, prairie dogs and other mammals, such as rabbits and cats are susceptible to plague because they carry fleas.\n\n'The risk of residents contracting plague is extremely low,' said Jefferson County Public Health Director Dr. Mark Johnson. 'We want people to be aware that summer marks the beginning of the plague season, and just a few simple precautions will further reduce that risk.'\n\nJCPH and the City of Golden Animal Control are working together to investigate the cases and to determine the extent of the die-off in the area.\n\nWhen plague appears in an area, there is usually a die-off of the rodents and rabbits. When the animal dies, the fleas leave to find another host, thus spreading the disease. Most human plague cases result from infected flea bites. Less commonly, people are infected by direct contact (i.e. through a bite) with blood or tissues of infected animals.\n\nThe best way to prevent plague is to control the presence of rodents and fleas in and around the home. In addition, people should avoid contact with any species of wild rodents, especially sick or dead rodents. If a dead rodent is found, do not handle the animal directly, use gloves and place it in a plastic bag. Dogs and cats should be confined so they cannot prey on infected rodents and then bring the disease home with them. Pet owners who live close to rodent populations should use flea control products recommended by their veterinarian. Controlling fleas on pets will prevent the transfer of fleas to humans. If these reasonable precautions are taken, the probability of contracting plague is extremely low.\n\nPlague is easily treated in humans with antibiotics when recognized early. Two to 6 days after being infected with plague, people become ill with the following symptoms: sudden onset of high fever; muscle pain; malaise, or a general feeling of being ill; nausea and vomiting. Anyone experiencing these symptoms should consult a physician immediately.\n\nJefferson County Public Health will continue its plague surveillance of rodent populations in the county. Citizens are requested to report any unusual rodent die-offs to City of Golden Animal Control 303-384-8045.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Plague is primarily a disease of wild rodents. It is caused by the bacterium _Yersinia pestis_, which is mainly spread by the bites of infectious fleas. The bacterium is not native to North America. When it was introduced, it became established in some rodent populations. Some species are particularly susceptible. For example, _Y. pestis_ caused the extinction of entire colonies of black-tailed prairie dogs. Small rodents such as deer mice and grasshopper mice are suggested to act as the reservoirs. Larger species like squirrels and chipmunks are considered to be more vulnerable to infection.\n\nA map of the affected area can be accessed at http://healthmap.org/r/awKA. - Mod.PMB\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/209.]", "summary": "A ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n Communicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Plague is primarily a disease of wild rodents. \n\nThe best way to prevent plague is to control the presence of rodents and fleas in and around the home. \n\nWhen plague appears in an area, there is usually a die-off of the rodents and rabbits.

State Public Health Veterinarian Jennifer House says 3 cats in Colorado have tested positive for the plague so far this year [2015].\n\nThe plague can be transmitted to people through a flea bite and direct contact with infected animals. Typical symptoms include sudden onset of fever and chills, severe headache, muscle aches, nausea, vomiting and a general feeling of systemic illness.\n\nOne person has died from the plague in 2015. Taylor Gaes of Larimer County died on 8 Jun 2015 after coming down with what he thought was a bad case of the flu, but tests confirmed it was a rare form of the plague.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Plague, caused by _Yersinia pestis_, is enzootic among rodents in the western United States. Humans can be infected through 1) the bite of an infected flea carried by a rodent or, rarely, other animals; 2) direct contact with contaminated tissues; or 3) in rare cases, inhalation of respiratory secretions from infected people or animals.\n\nPlague is a potential bioterrorism agent. Human infections are rare but can be life-threatening. The case fatality rate of plague depends on the clinical presentation (that is, bubonic, septicemic, or pneumonic) and timing of initiation of antibiotic therapy; if untreated, the case fatality rate is over 50 per cent for bubonic plague and approaches 100 per cent for pneumonic plague. Rapid laboratory identification can help guide therapy.\n\nDomestic cats and dogs can also contract plague from infective fleas. They may carry infected fleas home to their owners. Cats may serve as a direct source of infection. There are many flea treatments and repellents appropriate for pets available. Some products may be suitable for dogs but not cats, or may be suitable for an adult but not a younger animal. Be sure to consult your veterinarian, as some products may be toxic to cats, kittens, and puppies, even resulting in fatalities.\n\nClinical signs in pets involve a localized swelling, such as under the jaw in cats, but also in the inguinal region or under the front leg (the armpit, if you will), lethargy, anorexia, and fever. Please take your pet to a veterinarian if you notice any abnormalities.\n\nVeterinarians should protect themselves by wearing gloves when examining these swellings. A bubo that ruptures may infect the veterinarian or even the pet owner if the pet owner is the one palpating the swelling.\n\nAnother form of the disease is the respiratory form. Cats may acquire this form and can spread it to their owners or the veterinarians through infected expiratory droplets. People are also prone to the respiratory infection.\n\nYou should also be aware that the fleas that hitchhike into your home via a pet vehicle can also transmit disease to you, the owner, or caretaker of the pet. Sleeping in the same bed with dogs has been associated with plague in enzootic areas. Plague patients with no history of exposure to rodents can be infected by _Y. pestis_ if their pets carry infected rodent fleas into the home. Veterinarians always should recommend flea control to dog and cat owners.\n\nAlthough plague is relatively rare in wild ungulates, this report (J Wildl Dis. 2008 Oct;44(4):983-7. Ocular plague (_Yersinia pestis_) in mule deer (_Odocoileus hemionus_) from Wyoming and Oregon. Edmunds DR1, Williams ES, O'Toole D, Mills KW, Boerger-Fields AM, Jaeger PT, Bildfell RJ, Dearing P, Cornish TE) describes ocular lesions associated with _Yersinia pestis_ infection in 3 free-ranging mule deer (_Odocoileus hemionus_) from Wyoming and Oregon, USA. All deer were observed antemortem and seemed to be blind. Post-mortem examination revealed gross lesions of bilateral keratoconjunctivitis and/or panophthalmitis in the 1st 2 deer, but only partial retinal detachment in the 3rd deer. Microscopically, all deer had moderate-to-severe necrotizing and fibrinopurulent endophthalmitis and varying degrees of keratoconjunctivitis with abundant intralesional coccobacilli. The lesions in the 1st (D1) and 3rd deer (D3) suggested an acute course, whereas those in the 2nd deer (D2) were subacute to chronic. _Yersinia pestis_ was isolated from ocular tissue swabs or ocular fluids of D1 and D2, and it was demonstrated by immunohistochemistry within ocular lesions of D1 and D3. Although plague does not seem to be a major cause of morbidity or mortality in free-ranging mule deer, keratoconjunctivitis or pinkeye is relatively common in these animals, and plague should be considered as a differential diagnosis in such cases, with appropriate precautions taken to protect human and animal health.\n\nParts of this comment have been excerpted from: CDC.

Symptoms include: sudden onset of fever, headache, chills, weakness, and swollen, tender, and painful lymph nodes (generally near the site where bacteria entered the body).

No other members of the camping party reported symptoms and health officials are continuing to monitor the child's family and treatment providers. The child is recovering.\n\n'Human cases of plague are rare, with the last reported human infection in California occurring in 2006,' Dr. Smith said. 'Although this is a rare disease, people should protect themselves from infection by avoiding any contact with wild rodents. Never feed squirrels, chipmunks, or other rodents in picnic or campground areas, and never touch sick or dead rodents. Protect your pets from fleas and keep them away from wild animals,' Dr Smith added.\n\nCDPH is working closely with the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health (LACDPH), US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Yosemite National Park and the US Forest Service to investigate the source of the infection, and the patient's travel history and activities during the incubation period.\n\nAs a precaution, Yosemite National Park will provide additional information to visitors about steps to prevent plague exposure, and post caution signs at the Crane Flat campground and nearby campgrounds. Steps the public can take to avoid exposure to human plague include:\n- never feed squirrels, chipmunks or other rodents and never touch sick or dead rodents;\n- avoid walking, hiking or camping near rodent burrows;\n- wear long pants tucked into socks or boot tops to reduce exposure to fleas;\n- spray insect repellent containing DEET on socks and pant cuffs to reduce exposure to fleas;\n- keep wild rodents out of homes, trailers, and outbuildings and away from pets.\n\nIn California, plague-infected animals are most likely to be found in the foothills and mountains and to a lesser extent, along the coast. Desert and Central Valley areas are considered low risk for plague. State and local health officials regularly monitor plague-prone areas by testing animals and their fleas. In 2014, non-human plague activity was detected in animals in 7 counties: El Dorado, Mariposa, Modoc, Plumas, San Diego, Santa Barbara, and Sierra.\n\nPlague is not transmitted from human to human, unless a patient with plague also has a lung infection and is coughing. There have been no known cases of human-to-human infection in California since 1924. LACDPH and CDPH believe the risk of human-to-human transmission is similarly low in this case. The last reported cases of human plague in California occurred in 2005 and 2006 in Mono, Los Angeles, and Kern counties and all 3 patients survived following treatment with antibiotics. Since 1970, 42 human cases of plague have been confirmed in California, of which 9 were fatal.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[This is a short history of the introduction of _Yersinia pestis_ into the USA (http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aso/databank/entries/dm00bu.html):\n\nIn the summer of 1899, a ship sailing from Hong Kong to San Francisco had had 2 cases of plague on board. Because of this, although no passengers were ill when the ship reached San Francisco, it was to be quarantined on Angel Island. When the boat was searched, 11 stowaways were found -- the next day 2 were missing. Their bodies were later found in the Bay, and autopsy showed they contained plague bacilli. Despite this scare, there was no immediate outbreak of disease. But rats from the ship probably had something to do with the epidemic that hit San Francisco 9 months later.\n\nOn 6 Mar 1900, a city health officer autopsied a deceased Chinese man and found organisms in the body that looked like plague. In 1894, 2 research physicians had simultaneously and independently identified the bacillus that causes bubonic plague. Shibasaburo Kitasato published his findings in Japanese and English; Alexandre Yersin published in French. People in different parts of the world credited one or the other with the discovery, depending which journals they had read. (Since 1970 the bacillus has been known as _Yersinia pestis_.) That the plague had an identifiable 'germ' was known. But other recent findings had not been disseminated -- or believed. Most people felt that the germ infected humans through food or open wounds. Disinfection campaigns were the order of the day. In some places they ran carbolic acid through sewers, actually spreading the disease faster because it flushed out rats that had lived there.\n\nBack in San Francisco, however, political issues vied with scientific efforts. Anti-Chinese feeling ran strong in the city then, and the 1st step taken was to quarantine Chinatown. The Chinese objected, and so did the business community. Not because they wanted to protect the rights of the Chinese, but it was bad for business to have people thinking there was plague in their city or state. The quarantine was lifted but health officials ran house-to-house inspections of Chinatown. People resisted, hiding their dead and locking their doors. But 2 more plague victims turned up. The city Board of Health officially announced that plague was present in the city. The governor refused to believe it or to do anything to help in the antiplague effort. The Surgeon General got permission from President McKinley to pass antiplague regulations. Others still denied the existence of plague, although more and more states in the country were stopping trade with California.\n\nCommissions and boards formed, fought with the governor, and were disbanded, underfunded, and reformed. Meanwhile, more plague cases were found. In April 1901, a clean-up campaign of Chinatown was undertaken, scouring almost 1200 houses and 14 000 rooms. In 1903, a new governor took office and vowed to help the boards of health in every way. On 29 Feb 1904, a woman in the town of Concord, California, died of plague, its last victim -- for a while. There had been 121 cases in San Francisco and 5 outside, with 122 deaths.\n\nKnowledge, like illness, spreads. In the next few years, information about the plague's causes and transmission would be clarified. In 1894, physician Mary Miles in Canton, China, had reported the widespread death of rats in plague epidemics. But people assumed the rats caught the disease from humans. In 1897, Japanese physician Masanori Ogata wrote 'one should pay attention to insects like fleas for, as the rat becomes cold after death, they leave their host and may transmit the plague virus directly to man.' Paul Louis Simmond put all the accumulated observations together, made his own observations (societal and microscopic), and experimented with the bacillus, rats, and fleas. He proved that rat fleas bit people (which went against received wisdom), and that a sick animal could not transmit the disease if it didn't have fleas. Simmond published his conclusions in 1898 and was roundly ridiculed. But in 1905, a British commission published some of the same findings and in 1908, issued a report confirming all of Simmond's conclusions (though not crediting him).\n\nIn 1906, an earthquake of record proportions devastated San Francisco. The ruin of the city's buildings made not just people, but rats, homeless. The subsequent year or 2 of living in refugee camps while rebuilding was highly conducive to rat and flea infestations. In 1907, cases of plague were reported. But with hindsight on the last epidemic and new knowledge from research, officials launched a new kind of campaign. They offered a bounty on rats. A similar rat-catching campaign had been used successfully to fight plague in New Orleans. It worked as well in San Francisco, and though this 2nd epidemic was stronger than the 1st, it was brought to halt in 1909. - Mod.LL\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/29430.]", "summary": "Steps the public can take to avoid exposure to human plague include:\n- never feed squirrels, chipmunks or other rodents and never touch sick or dead rodents;\n- avoid walking, hiking or camping near rodent burrows;\n- wear long pants tucked into socks or boot tops to reduce exposure to fleas;\n- spray insect repellent containing DEET on socks and pant cuffs to reduce exposure to fleas;\n- keep wild rodents out of homes, trailers, and outbuildings and away from pets.

Humans can be infected through 1) the bite of an infected flea carried by a rodent or, rarely, other animals; 2) direct contact with contaminated tissues; or 3) in rare cases, inhalation of respiratory secretions from infected people or animals.\n\nPlague is a potential bioterrorism agent. Human infections are rare but can be life-threatening. The case fatality rate of plague depends on the clinical presentation (that is, bubonic, septicemic, or pneumonic) and timing of initiation of antibiotic therapy; if untreated, the case fatality rate is over 50 per cent for bubonic plague and approaches 100 per cent for pneumonic plague. Rapid laboratory identification can help guide therapy.\n\nDomestic cats and dogs can also contract plague from infective fleas. They may carry infected fleas home to their owners. Cats may serve as a direct source of infection. There are many flea treatments and repellents appropriate for pets available. Some products may be suitable for dogs but not cats, or may be suitable for an adult but not a younger animal. Be sure to consult your veterinarian, as some products may be toxic to cats, kittens, and puppies, even resulting in fatalities.\n\nClinical signs in pets involve a localized swelling, such as under the jaw in cats, but also in the inguinal region or under the front leg (the armpit, if you will), lethargy, anorexia, and fever. Please take your pet to a veterinarian if you notice any abnormalities.\n\nVeterinarians should protect themselves by wearing gloves when examining these swellings. A bubo that ruptures may infect the veterinarian or even the pet owner if the pet owner is the one palpating the swelling.\n\nAnother form of the disease is the respiratory form. Cats may acquire this form and can spread it to their owners or the veterinarians through infected expiratory droplets. People are also prone to the respiratory infection.\n\nYou should also be aware that the fleas that hitchhike into your home via a pet vehicle can also transmit disease to you, the owner, or caretaker of the pet. Sleeping in the same bed with dogs has been associated with plague in enzootic areas. Plague patients with no history of exposure to rodents can be infected by _Y. pestis_ if their pets carry infected rodent fleas into the home. Veterinarians always should recommend flea control to dog and cat owners.\n\nAlthough plague is relatively rare in wild ungulates, this report (J Wildl Dis. 2008 Oct;44(4):983-7. Ocular plague (_Yersinia pestis_) in mule deer (_Odocoileus hemionus_) from Wyoming and Oregon. Edmunds DR1, Williams ES, O'Toole D, Mills KW, Boerger-Fields AM, Jaeger PT, Bildfell RJ, Dearing P, Cornish TE) describes ocular lesions associated with _Yersinia pestis_ infection in 3 free-ranging mule deer (_Odocoileus hemionus_) from Wyoming and Oregon, USA. All deer were observed antemortem and seemed to be blind. Post-mortem examination revealed gross lesions of bilateral keratoconjunctivitis and/or panophthalmitis in the 1st 2 deer, but only partial retinal detachment in the 3rd deer. Microscopically, all deer had moderate-to-severe necrotizing and fibrinopurulent endophthalmitis and varying degrees of keratoconjunctivitis with abundant intralesional coccobacilli. The lesions in the 1st (D1) and 3rd deer (D3) suggested an acute course, whereas those in the 2nd deer (D2) were subacute to chronic. _Yersinia pestis_ was isolated from ocular tissue swabs or ocular fluids of D1 and D2, and it was demonstrated by immunohistochemistry within ocular lesions of D1 and D3. Although plague does not seem to be a major cause of morbidity or mortality in free-ranging mule deer, keratoconjunctivitis or pinkeye is relatively common in these animals, and plague should be considered as a differential diagnosis in such cases, with appropriate precautions taken to protect human and animal health.\n\nParts of this comment have been excerpted from: CDC.

Authorities are still investigating the 8 Jun 2015 death. CBS Denver reports that the teenager acquired the infection most likely from fleas on a dead rodent or other animal on the family acreage. He was a 16-year-old high school athlete who played quarterback on the football team and was a starting pitcher in baseball.\n\nThe Larimer County Health Department said this is the 1st county resident confirmed to have contacted the plague since 1999. The agency is leading the investigation with help from experts from the CDC, the State Health Department and the coroner's office. Officials say the family is reaching out to people who visited the home before the cause of death was known. There is a small chance that others could have been bitten by infected fleas.\n\nPlague can spread through rodent populations in a localized area often resulting in mass animal 'die-offs.' The only animals with confirmed plague so far in 2015 in Larimer County were in an area of Soapstone Natural area that is not open to the public, according to CBS Denver.\n\nThe plague killed millions of people in Europe in the Middle Ages in a series of outbreaks known as the Black Death. 'Now, it's very rare, especially in the USA. There are only about 7 to 10 cases a year, but it still exists,' medical contributor Dr Holly Phillips told 'CBS This Morning.' 'Think of rodents in very rural states -- western states, southwest, ranches, farms -- that's likely what happened here.'\n\nThe plague can be treated with antimicrobials, but Phillips said that because it's so rare and early symptoms can resemble the flu, it may not be recognized in time. The most common form of the disease, bubonic plague, accounts for about 80 percent of cases in humans. It causes painful swelling of the lymph nodes, fever, and muscle aches, and as the bacteria multiply they can spread to the respiratory system and bloodstream.\n\nA 7-year-old girl recovered from the plague after contracting it while camping in southwest Colorado in 2015. Her mother said may have been infected by insects near a dead squirrel she wanted to bury.\n\nIn recent decades, an average of 7 human plague cases are reported each year nationwide according to the CDC. Most human cases in the United States are scattered in rural areas and occur predominantly in northern New Mexico, northern Arizona, and southern Colorado, California, southern Oregon, and far western Nevada.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nChanel Schwartzentruber\n<cschwart@mail.uoguelph.ca>\n\n[Another report of this case was submitted by Adrienne LeBailly, MD, MPH, Director, Larimer County Dept. of Health & Environment.

This appears to be a case of primary septicemic plague.\n\nAs outlined by the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) and quoted in ProMED-mail post 20120601.1153277: 'Death from bubonic plague occurs after the bacterium _Yersinia pestis_ escapes from the infected bubo into the bloodstream (septicemic plague) causing the manifestations of the sepsis syndrome. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) with subsequent cutaneous hemorrhage may well have been what was called the 'Black Death' in the Middle Ages. The bacterium can spread to the lungs, causing a secondary plague pneumonia (secondary to the bacteremia), or to the meninges, causing a plague meningitis. Both of these events have a high case fatality rate and the secondary plague pneumonia is the way the infection spreads (by aerosol) from person to person.\n\n'The typical sign of the most common form of human plague is a swollen and very tender lymph gland, accompanied by pain. The swollen gland is called a 'bubo.' Bubonic plague should be suspected when a person develops a swollen gland, fever, chills, headache, and extreme exhaustion, and has a history of possible exposure to infected rodents, rabbits, or fleas. A person usually becomes ill with bubonic plague 2 to 6 days after being infected.\n\n'When bubonic plague is left untreated, plague bacteria invade the bloodstream. As the plague bacteria multiply in the bloodstream, they spread rapidly throughout the body and cause a severe and often fatal condition. Infection of the lungs with the plague bacterium causes the pneumonic form of plague, a severe respiratory illness. The infected person may experience high fever, chills, cough, and breathing difficulty and may expel bloody sputum.

It is caused by the bacterium _Yersinia pestis_, which is mainly spread by the bites of infectious fleas. The bacterium is not native to North America. When it was introduced, it became established in some rodent populations. Some species are particularly susceptible. For example, _Y. pestis_ caused the extinction of entire colonies of black-tailed prairie dogs. Small rodents such as deer mice and grasshopper mice are suggested to act as the reservoirs. Larger species like squirrels and chipmunks are considered to be more vulnerable to infection.\n\nA map of the affected area can be accessed at http://healthmap.org/r/awKj. - Mod.PMB]\n\n[Plague, caused by _Yersinia pestis_, is enzootic among rodents in the western USA.

Human infections are rare but can be life-threatening. The plague case-fatality rate depends on the clinical presentation (that is, bubonic, septicemic, or pneumonic) and timing of initiation of antibiotic therapy; if untreated, the case-fatality rate is over 50 per cent for bubonic plague and approaches 100 per cent for pneumonic plague. Rapid laboratory identification can help guide therapy.\n\nDomestic cats and dogs can also contract plague from infective fleas. They may carry infected fleas home to their owners. Cats may serve as a direct source of infection. There are many flea treatments and repellents appropriate for pets available. Some products may be suitable for dogs but not cats, or may be suitable for an adult but not a younger animal. Be sure to consult your veterinarian, as some products may be toxic to cats, kittens, and puppies, even resulting in fatalities.\n\nClinical signs in pets involve a localized swelling, such as under the jaw in cats, but also in the inguinal region or under the front leg (the armpit if you will), lethargy, anorexia, and fever. Please take your pet to a veterinarian if you notice any abnormalities.\n\nVeterinarians should protect themselves by wearing gloves when examining these swellings. A bubo that ruptures may infect the veterinarian or even the pet owner if the pet owner is the one palpating the swelling.\n\nAnother form of the disease is the respiratory form.

According to Central District Health Department (CDHD), the dog became ill at the end of May 2015. Plague was confirmed in ground squirrels in an area south of Boise to the Snake River and from Kuna to Mountain Home nearly 2 weeks ago.\n\nThe dog's owner took it to a veterinarian where a sample was taken and submitted to the State Public Health Laboratory for testing. Preliminary tests indicate the dog likely has the disease. CDHD spokesperson Christine Myron said final results are expected in a week. The dog was treated for the plague and is now recovering. Those who handled the dog while it was ill are being monitored and provided preventative medication if needed, Myron said.\n\nPlague is a bacterial disease of rodents and is generally transmitted to humans through the bites of infected fleas. It can also be transmitted by direct contact with infected animals, including rodents, wildlife and pets. 'This is a reminder that people who live and recreate in the area of impact need to take precautions to avoid contact with ground squirrels and their potentially infected fleas. Do not let your dog touch ground squirrels in the affected area. People can be exposed to plague when pets bring infected fleas back into the home, by caring for a sick pet without proper precautions, or by contact with rodents carrying fleas,' said Sarah Correll, epidemiologist for Central District Health Department.\n\nTo prevent plague, the public health department recommends the following:\n\n- see your doctor about any unexplained illness with a severe fever if you have been in the affected area;\n- avoid picking up or touching dead animals; wear gloves if you must handle dead animals;\n- do not let pets sleep in bed with you. This has been shown to increase your risk of getting plague;\n- do not let your pets hunt or roam in the affected area;\n- talk to your veterinarian about using an appropriate flea control product on your pets;\n- clean up areas near the house where rodents could live, such as woodpiles, brush piles, junk and abandoned vehicles;\n- sick pets should be examined promptly by a veterinarian;\n- put hay, wood, and compost piles as far as possible from your home;\n- don't leave your pet's food and water where rodents can get to it;\n- If you enter the identified Area of Impact, take the proper precautions:\n- wear long-sleeved shirts and long pants;\n- use DEET on clothing in accordance with label instructions or wear clothing pre-treated with permethrin;\n- use DEET on exposed skin, in accordance with label instructions.\n\nSymptoms of plague in humans include sudden onset of fever, chills, headache, and weakness. In most cases, there is a painful swelling of the lymph node in the groin, armpit, or neck areas. Plague signs in cats and dogs are fever, lethargy, and loss of appetite. There may be a swelling in the lymph node under the jaw. With prompt diagnosis and appropriate antibiotic treatment, the fatality rate in people and pets can be greatly reduced.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Plague is transmitted by fleas. There are several forms of plague in human beings: bubonic, septicemic and pneumonic.\n\nThis article leads us to believe the contact with ground squirrel, or fleas from the ground squirrel, transmitted plague to the dog.\n\nPlague, caused by _Yersinia pestis_, is enzootic among rodents in the western United States. Humans can be infected through 1) the bite of an infected flea carried by a rodent or, rarely, other animals; 2) direct contact with contaminated tissues; or 3) in rare cases, inhalation of respiratory secretions from infected people or animals.\n\nPlague is a potential bioterrorism agent. Human infections are rare but can be life-threatening. The case fatality rate of plague depends on the clinical presentation (that is, bubonic, septicemic, or pneumonic) and timing of initiation of antibiotic therapy; if untreated, the case fatality rate is over 50 per cent for bubonic plague and approaches 100 per cent for pneumonic plague. Rapid laboratory identification can help guide therapy.\n\nDomestic cats and dogs can also contract plague from infective fleas. They may carry infected fleas home to their owners. Cats may serve as a direct source of infection. There are many flea treatments and repellents appropriate for pets available. Some products may be suitable for dogs but not cats, or may be suitable for an adult but not a younger animal. Be sure to consult your veterinarian, as some products may be toxic to cats, kittens, and puppies, even resulting in fatalities.\n\nClinical signs in pets involve a localized swelling, such as under the jaw in cats, but also in the inguinal region or under the front leg (the armpit, if you will), lethargy, anorexia, and fever. Please take your pet to a veterinarian if you notice any abnormalities.\n\nVeterinarians should protect themselves by wearing gloves when examining these swellings. A bubo that ruptures may infect the veterinarian or even the pet owner if the pet owner is the one palpating the swelling.\n\nAnother form of the disease is the respiratory form. Cats may acquire this form and can spread it to their owners or the veterinarians through infected expiratory droplets. People are also prone to the respiratory infection.\n\nYou should also be aware that the fleas that hitchhike into your home via a pet vehicle can also transmit disease to you, the owner, or caretaker of the pet. Sleeping in the same bed with dogs has been associated with plague in enzootic areas.

Only about 10 to 20 human cases of plague are reported in the United States each year, generally contracted in prairie settings.\n\nMason says it was 1st detected in the Nebraska National Forests and Grasslands in 2004 on both the Buffalo Gap and Fort Pierre National Grasslands in South Dakota, and has since spread to the adjacent Badlands National Park and to the Lower Brule Indian Reservation. The initial outbreak posed a serious threat to the black-footed ferret, which was successfully reintroduced over 20 years ago in the Conata Basin area of the Buffalo Gap NG and has since been introduced in other locations around the region.\n\nThe Forest Service and other agencies began an aggressive campaign of dusting the entrances of prairie dog colonies with a contact insecticide to kill fleas and keep the plague from spreading, but Mason says there are no plans at this time to extend that into the Oglala NG. As for the threat of plague spreading to humans, Mason says prevention is the best remedy. She says to avoid any contact with wild rodents such as prairie dogs, dead or alive, that may have infected fleas, never feed wildlife.

At later stages the disease causes gangrene and a large amount of pustules, or buboes, on the skin. The incubation period could be up to 7 days.\n\nModern medications are effective in fighting bacterium that causes plague, _Yersinia pestis_, though it can be deadly if left untreated.\n\nThe last plague epidemic in the United States was in Los Angeles between 1924 and 1925, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nPlague originally came to North America via rodents on steamships from Asia.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Plague is primarily a disease of wild rodents. It is is caused by the bacterium _Yersinia pestis_, which is mainly spread by the bites of infected fleas. Though the bacterium is not native to North America, when it was introduced, it became established in some rodent populations. Some species are particularly susceptible. For example, _Y. pestis_ caused the extinction of entire colonies of black-tailed prairie dogs. Small rodents such as deer mice and grasshopper mice have been suggested as reservoirs. Larger species like squirrels and chipmunks are considered to be more vulnerable to infection.

The organism had been previously misidentified as _Pseudomonas luteola_ by an automated system in the hospital laboratory. An investigation led by Tri-County Health Department (TCHD) revealed that patient A's dog had died recently with hemoptysis. 3 other persons who had contact with the dog, 1 of whom also had contact with patient A, were ill with fever and respiratory symptoms, including 2 with radiographic evidence of pneumonia. Specimens from the dog and all 3 human contacts yielded evidence of acute _Y. pestis_ infection. 1 of the pneumonia cases might have resulted through human-to-human transmission from patient A, which would be the first such event reported in the USA since 1924.\n\nThis outbreak highlights 1) the need to consider plague in the differential diagnosis of ill domestic animals, including dogs, in areas where plague is endemic; 2) the limitations of automated diagnostic systems for identifying rare bacteria such as _Y. pestis_; and 3) the potential for milder plague illness in patients taking antimicrobial agents. Hospital laboratorians should be aware of the limitations of automated identification systems, and clinicians should suspect plague in patients with clinically compatible symptoms from whom _P. luteola_ is isolated.\n\nInvestigation and results\n-------------------------\nPatient A, a previously healthy middle-aged man, developed fever and cough on 28 Jun 2014. Over the next 24 hours his condition worsened with increasing cough and the production of bloody sputum. He was admitted to a local hospital where he was diagnosed with pneumonia (Figure [for figure and tables see source URL above URL. - Mod.LL]). Blood cultures collected on [30 Jun 2014] grew a Gram negative rod that was initially identified as _P. luteola_ using an automated identification system. Over the next 6 days patient A's respiratory status deteriorated, and he was transferred to another facility where he required intubation. Because of the severity of his illness and previous reports of misidentification of _Y. pestis_ as _P. luteola_ (1,2), the isolate was sent to the CDPHE laboratory for further testing. On 8 Jul 2014, the specimen was correctly identified as _Y. pestis_, and patient A received a diagnosis of pneumonic plague. Patient A was treated with broad-spectrum antimicrobials, including levofloxacin and streptomycin, and recovered after hospitalization for 23 days.\n\nTCHD initiated an investigation, consisting of interviews with patient A's family, evaluation of potential exposures to the patient, and an environmental assessment to determine the risk for further disease transmission. The investigation revealed that patient A's dog, a male American pit bull terrier aged 2 years, became ill with fever, jaw rigidity, drooling, and right forelimb ataxia on 24 Jun 2014 (Table). The dog was kept overnight at a veterinary clinic and humanely euthanized the following day after developing dyspnea and bloody sputum. Patient A had close contact with the dog during euthanasia. Necropsy revealed gastric and pulmonary hemorrhage. Samples tested negative for evidence of rabies virus infection and anticoagulants; histopathologic examination of the tissues was declined by patient A. Following patient A's diagnosis with plague, liver and lung tissues from the dog were tested for _Y. pestis_, and results were positive by both polymerase chain reaction assay and culture. Archived formalin-fixed tissues from the dog were processed for histopathology, revealing severe acute bronchopneumonia with intra-alveolar bacteria. The investigation also identified 3 other persons who had been in close contact with the ill dog, one of whom who also had contact with patient A. All 3 subsequently received diagnoses of plague, and all 3 recovered (Table, Figure).\n\nOn 30 Jun 2014, 2 days after patient A became ill, patient B, a female veterinary clinic employee, developed a fever and cough and visited an urgent care facility, where bronchitis was diagnosed. She reported close contact with the ill dog on 24-25 Jun 2014. After her symptoms failed to improve with self-initiated amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, patient B visited an emergency department on 5 Jul 2014, received a diagnosis of pneumonia, and was treated with azithromycin, with improvement over the next several days. After notification on 10 Jul 2014 of her exposure to plague, she visited a health care provider and was treated with oral levofloxacin. A polymerase chain reaction test on a sputum specimen was positive for _Y. pestis_. Subsequent testing of paired acute and convalescent serum specimens demonstrated a 4-fold increase in antibody titers to _Y. pestis_, indicative of recent infection (Table).\n\nPatient C, a female veterinary clinic employee, also had close contact with the dog on 24-25 Jun 2014 and self-initiated a 6-day course of oral doxycycline on 25 Jun 2014. On 4 Jul 2014, she experienced fever, chills, myalgia, and fatigue; symptoms progressed to chest tightness and cough. Following notification of the exposure to plague on 9 Jul 2014, patient C self-initiated a second course of doxycycline and was medically evaluated later that day. Crackles were heard during chest auscultation; however, results of a chest radiograph were normal. A full course of oral doxycycline was continued with resolution of symptoms. Initial and follow-up serum specimens tested positive for antibody to _Y. pestis_, with a greater than fourfold decrease in antibody titers at follow-up 6 months later (Table).\n\nOn 4 Jul 2014, patient D, a woman who was a close contact of patient A, experienced chest tightness, dyspnea, and fever. She was evaluated at an emergency department, received a diagnosis of pneumonia, and was treated with oral levofloxacin. Patient D handled the body of the dog on 25 Jun 2015 after it died, at one point getting blood on her hands. She also had extended close contact with patient A on 29-30 Jun 2014 while he was coughing bloody sputum. On 8 Jul 2014, after patient A was identified with pneumonic plague, patient D was hospitalized and treated with levofloxacin and streptomycin. Paired acute and convalescent serum specimens for patient D demonstrated a greater than 4-fold increase in antibody titers to _Y. pestis_ (Table).\n\nPublic health response\n----------------------\nTCHD evaluated potential exposures from each patient and conducted an environmental assessment to determine the risk for further disease transmission. Case status was assigned according to case definitions developed by the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists for CDC's National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System.\n\nMedical personnel and personal contacts of all 4 patients were notified of their possible exposure to plague. A total of 114 persons had close contact with the dog or one or more of the human patients: 36 in veterinary settings, 58 in human health care settings, and 20 as close personal contacts. Antimicrobial prophylaxis was recommended for 88 persons interviewed within 7 days of exposure. The remaining 26 were advised to monitor for fever for 7 days and to seek medical attention immediately if symptoms occurred.\n\nOn 9 Jul 2014, TCHD surveyed patient A's property for evidence of plague. Live rabbits were observed on the property but no other wildlife. Inactive prairie dog burrows were present; however, it was reported that the prairie dog colony had been intentionally eradicated in October 2013.\n\nCDPHE issued press releases for public awareness and Health Alert Network notifications to health care providers and veterinarians on 9, 10, and 18 Jul 2014. Medical facilities were instructed to use droplet precautions for persons with suspected plague. TCHD staff members distributed information on plague symptoms and transmission risk to homes in the vicinity of the index patient. No further cases have been identified.\n\nDiscussion\n----------\nPlague is a rare but life-threatening zoonosis caused by _Y. pestis_. A median of 8 cases of human plague are reported annually in the USA (3), primarily among residents of semirural areas in New Mexico, Arizona, Colorado, and California. Normally a pathogen of rodents, _Y. pestis_ is transmitted to humans through the bite of infected rodent fleas or direct contact with the tissues or secretions of infected animals.\n\nBubonic plague, characterized by fever and painful regional lymphadenopathy, results from percutaneous exposure and accounts for approximately 85 percent of reported cases. Pneumonic plague occurs as either a complication of untreated bubonic plague (10-13 percent of all cases) or as a primary pneumonia following inhalation of infectious droplets (2 percent of all cases) (4). Untreated pneumonic plague has a fatality rate of 93 percent or more and can be spread from person to person through aerosols generated during coughing. A 3rd clinical form, septicemic plague, is characterized by fever and shock without localizing signs or symptoms. Laboratory diagnosis of plague is based on culture or polymerase chain reaction assays of blood, sputum, or lymph node aspirates, or on serology. Effective therapy includes aminoglycosides and doxycycline. In addition, the fluoroquinolones levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin have been approved recently by the Food and Drug Administration based on animal studies. The advent of antimicrobial therapy has reduced overall plague mortality from more than 60 percent to approximately 16 percent (3,5,6).\n\nIn this outbreak, all 4 patients had laboratory-confirmed plague, including 3 patients (A, B, and D) with clinical and radiographic evidence of pneumonia. The 4th patient (C) had an atypical presentation with respiratory symptoms but no radiographic evidence of pneumonia, possibly as a result of partial treatment immediately after exposure. 3 patients (A, B and C) became ill shortly after exposure to an ill infected dog. The source of infection for patient D is less certain because she had exposure to both the dog on 25-26 Jun 2014 (an incubation period of 9-10 days) and to patient A on 29-30 Jun 2014 while he had hemoptysis (an incubation period of 5-6 days). The shorter incubation period is more typical of plague and therefore supports human-to-human transmission (6). Nevertheless, transmission from the dog cannot be excluded given the animal's role in the other 3 infections and because incubation periods of up to 10 days have been reported, although rarely (7). Primary pneumonic plague is rare in the USA with only 74 cases reported during 1900-2012, and this event represents the largest outbreak and the 1st instance of possible human-to-human transmission since an outbreak in Los Angeles in 1924 (3,5).\n\n_Y. pestis_ infection in dogs generally is either asymptomatic or the cause of only a mild, self-limiting febrile illness (8). Dogs can play a role in human infection through transport of rodent fleas into the home (8,9). This outbreak began with illness in a pet dog, a previously unrecognized source of plague exposure in the USA. The only previously published case of direct transmission of plague from a dog to a human was reported from China in 2009 (10). Although symptomatic plague in dogs is rare, veterinarians should consider the possibility of _Y. pestis_ infection in ill dogs with wildlife exposure in areas where plague is endemic.\n\nThis outbreak is notable for the several factors that delayed its recognition. First, patient A's bacterial isolate initially was identified as _P. luteola_ by an automated blood culture system, and the correct identification of _Y. pestis_ was only made 7 days later. This delay resulted in the exposure of numerous medical personnel. Misidentification and a resulting delayed diagnosis have been previously reported, reinforcing the need for critical evaluation of results from automated systems and education of hospital microbiologists regarding this limitation (1,2). Among 12 _Y. pestis_ isolates obtained from patients in the USA during 2010-2013, at least 3 (25 percent) were originally misidentified by automated systems (Division of Vector-borne Diseases, National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases, CDC, unpublished data, 2015). Second, the spectrum of disease was broader than usual for pneumonic plague (7), with 2 of the 4 patients not requiring hospitalization. The clinical course of the milder cases might have been modified by self-administration of antimicrobials or medical prescription of azithromycin, an antibiotic not recommended for plague. Pneumonia is the only form of plague with the potential for human-to-human transmission. Delayed recognition because of inaccurate laboratory test results and atypical clinical presentations can lead to high numbers of potential exposures to health care workers, laboratory workers, and other close contacts.\n\nAlthough human plague is rare in North America, it remains a public health concern in the western USA where _Y. pestis_ circulates among wild rodent populations. The risk for plague can be minimized by avoidance of possibly infected rodents (such as prairie dogs) and their fleas. All suspected or confirmed plague cases and rodent die-offs in areas where plague is endemic should be reported immediately to public health officials so that exposures can be minimized to prevent additional transmission. Once plague is suspected, appropriate precautions and treatment should be initiated immediately, and clinical specimens should be collected and tested as soon as possible. Early recognition of plague, especially the pneumonic form, is critical to effective clinical management and a timely public health response. Veterinarians should consider plague in the differential diagnosis of ill domestic animals, including dogs, in areas where plague is endemic.\n\nReferences\n----------\n1.

The districts around the capital do not seem to be the only ones infected. According to information gathered from the Ministry of Health yesterday [6 Jan 2015], 13 suspected cases were registered in the urban commune of Antananarivo, from 4 Aug 2014 to 29 Dec 2014. The disease has infected several neighborhoods, including Anosibe, Anosimahavelona, Anosizato, Manjakaray, Antanimora and Ankasina.\n\nFaced with this situation, a source from the Public Health Service District reacted, stating that: 'The situation is now under control; all these people were registered as suspects, as they presented the symptoms of this disease, namely high fever and buboes. Only 3 cases have been confirmed after laboratory analysis,' the source said.\n\nNdranto Rakotonanahary, director of population and health at the town hall of Antananarivo, has not confirmed these 13 suspected cases. 'There is only one case, in the district of Ankasina, which was treated by the municipal health service. We are not aware of other cases,' he said.\n\nSince the 'beginning' of the plague season, between 4 Aug 2014 and 29 Dec 2014, 224 cases of plague were reported in the Big Island. 58 of the cases have died. The meeting between the WHO and the Ministry of Public Health, on 10 Dec 2014 in Anosy, reported 47 deaths. The number of people identified as infected with the disease was 189 at that time.\n\n[Byline: Vonjy Radasimalala and Michella Raharisoa]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Plague is caused by the _Yersinia pestis_ bacillus, carried by rat fleas. At the start of the rainy season, currently, rats flee the sewers of Madagascar in massive numbers and take refuge in people's cottages. Care must be taken in any rodent eradication program to ensure that a flea-killing compound is part of the plan. Just as in a natural rodent die-off from _Y. pestis_, the fleas will seek alternate hosts, that is, humans.\n\nThe following paragraph is from 1998 (Chanteau S, Ratsifasoamanana L, Rasoamanana B, et al: Plague, a Reemerging Disease in Madagascar. Emerg Infect Dis 1998; 4(1): 101-4; http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/4/1/98-0114_article.htm).\n\n'Between 1930 and 1990, bubonic plague had 'virtually disappeared' on the island due to efficient pest-control and good health management. However since 1990, an annual 200 cases are being reported, and bubonic plague takes on epidemic form, especially in the port of Mahajanga, each year. In the capital city of Antananarivo, more cases are also being notified each year since 1990. Madagascar (pop. 13 million) has accounted for 45 percent of all the cases of plague in Africa.'\n\nFatalities related to plague usually are caused by spread of the organism from the bubo (the very painful infected lymph node which drains the area where the flea bite occurred) to the bloodstream. The bacteremia can cause a coagulopathy, producing the purpura seen in the 'Black Plague' and also spread to the lungs causing a hemorrhagic pneumonia. It is the pneumonia that can facilitate person-to-person transmission.\n\nMadagascar was the location of the isolation of multi-antimicrobial resistant _Y. pestis_ in 1995 (Galimand M, Guiyoule A, Gerbaud G, et al: Multidrug resistance in _Yersinia pestis_ mediated by a transferable plasmid.

The swollen gland is called a 'bubo.' Bubonic plague should be suspected when a person develops a swollen gland, fever, chills, headache, and extreme exhaustion, and has a history of possible exposure to infected rodents, rabbits, or fleas. A person usually becomes ill with bubonic plague 2 to 6 days after being bitten.\n\nWhen bubonic plague is left untreated, the _Yersinia pestis_ organism can invade the bloodstream. As the plague bacteria multiply in the bloodstream, they spread rapidly throughout the body and cause a severe and often fatal condition. Infection of the lungs with the plague bacterium causes the pneumonic form of plague, a severe respiratory illness. The infected person may experience high fever, chills, cough, and breathing difficulty and may expel bloody sputum. If plague patients are not given specific antibiotic therapy, the disease can progress rapidly to death. At this stage, as appears to have happened in this case, person-to-person spread can occur, causing cases of 'primary' plague pneumonia.\n\nThe marmot is the most common reservoir for _Yersinia pestis_ in eastern Asia. The etymology of the term 'marmot' is uncertain (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marmot). It may have arisen from the Gallo-Romance prefix marm-, meaning to mumble or murmur (an example of onomatopoeia). Another possible origin is post-classical Latin, mus montanus, meaning 'mountain mouse.' - Mod.LL\n\nMaps of China can be seen at http://www.sacu.org/maps/provmap.png and http://healthmap.org/promed/p/333. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ]", "summary": "A ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n Communicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Dan Silver\n\n[Most plague cases are due to the bubonic form following the bite of an infected rodent flea causing a swollen and very tender lymph gland.

The latest November 2014 statistics reported 47 deaths from plague. The number of people reported infected with the disease to date, is 189 in Madagascar. 179 of these patients are suffering from bubonic plague. 5 people have been infected with pneumonic plague. The other 5 cases remain unclear. However, a source at the Ministry of Public Health remains cautious. '96 cases have now been confirmed with the Pasteur Institute in Madagascar. The number of people affected by this disease could be close to 100,' confirmed the source.\n\nOut of the 44 districts with plague, the remaining currently infected districts in the Big Island are Amparafaravola, Miarinarivo, Tsiroanomandidy, and Ankazobe. 'A locality is described as an area at the end of plague when there are no cases reported 12 days after the registration of the last case,' said a doctor at the Ministry of Public Health. The short-term eradication of plague in a plague outbreak remains a great challenge. 'There needs to be a comprehensive plan to exterminate rodents in these districts to prevent this disease. Environmental protection such as the fight against burning bushes and forest is also crucial. But all these actions should not only be the prerogative of the Ministry of Public Health. Everyone in the country must be mobilized', the doctor suggested.\n\nDespite the rising number of deaths, WHO is reassuring on its website. 'WHO, as already pointed out in its initial statement, does not recommend any travel restrictions or fewer trade goods to and from Madagascar'. According to its statement, WHO wishes to stress that all public health facilities in the country are able to support any suspected or confirmed case of plague.\n\n[Byline: Vonjy Radasimalala]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Plague is caused by the _Yersinia pestis_ bacillus, carried by rat fleas.

The disease re-emerged in the country in the 1990s. And now Madagascar reports more cases than any other country -- about 300 to 600 each year. People catch the plague bacteria, _Yersinia pestis_, from fleas that live on rodents. So the disease thrives in cities with poor sanitation.\n\nAfter a coup d'etat in 2009, Antananarivo's health and sanitation systems collapsed, Aaron Ross wrote on the Pulitzer Center's website in January 2014. 'Trash can go weeks, even months, without being collected and rats have become a common sight along the narrow alleyways that coil around the city's steep hillsides,' Ross wrote.\n\nThe plague's signature symptom is large, swollen lymph nodes. This form of the disease is called bubonic plague. And it's not very contagious. When the infection moves to the lungs, it's called pneumonic plague, a form that's more dangerous. It kills quickly, and it spreads from person to person through coughs. In the current outbreak, so far, only 2 percent of the cases are pneumonic, WHO says.\n\nBoth forms of the plague are easily cured with antimicrobials when the disease is caught early.\n\n[Byline: Michaeleen Doucleff]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nSara Volk de Garcia\nChicago, Illinois\nUSA\n<sara.m.volk@gmail.com>\n\n[Plague is caused by the _Yersinia pestis_ bacillus, carried by rat fleas.

None have shown any symptoms so far. His home village has also been isolated and thoroughly disinfected. It is the 2nd plague death in Jiuquan in 2014. The other fatality was also marmot-related.\n\nThe National Health and Family Planning Commission has sent specialists to the county to prevent the plague from spreading.

Most deaths from _Yersinia pestis_ human infection relates to bacteremic complications or the primary or secondary development of pneumonic plague. It is that form of infection that can result in person-to-person transmission. Given the isolation precautions, it might be assumed that the gentleman had developed pneumonic plague.\n\nPrimary pneumonic plague (one percent of natural plague presentations) arises as a result of inhalation of plague bacilli in infectious aerosols, such as would be produced when there are secondary pneumonic complications in bubonic/septicemic plague.\n\nPrimary plague pneumonia has a short incubation period of 1-3 days, after which there is sudden onset of flu-like symptoms including fever, chills, headache, generalized body pains, weakness, and chest discomfort. A cough develops with sputum production, which may be bloody, and increasing chest pain and difficulty in breathing. As the disease progresses, hypoxia (low oxygen concentration in the blood) and hemoptysis (coughing up blood) are prominent. The disease is invariably fatal unless antimicrobial therapy commences within 24 hours of exposure.\n\nPatients with primary pneumonic plague generate large quantities of infectious aerosols that pose a significant risk to close contacts. CDC (US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) guidelines identify contacts within 2 meters (6.5 ft) as being at greatest risk and do not consider the organism likely to be carried through air ducts or vents. Persons who have been in contact with pneumonic plague patients or handling potentially infectious body fluids or tissues without appropriate protection should receive preventive antimicrobial therapy. The preferred antimicrobial agents for prophylaxis are tetracyclines, quinolones, or chloramphenicol.\n\nThe marmot is the most common reservoir for _Yersinia pestis_ in eastern Asia. The etymology of the term 'marmot' is uncertain (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marmot). It may have arisen from the Gallo-Romance prefix marm-, meaning to mumble or murmur (an example of onomatopoeia). Another possible origin is post-classical Latin, mus montanus, meaning 'mountain mouse'. - Mod.LL\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/333.]", "summary": "\n\nPrimary pneumonic plague (one percent of natural plague presentations) arises as a result of inhalation of plague bacilli in infectious aerosols, such as would be produced when there are secondary pneumonic complications in bubonic/septicemic plague.

Notices posted on fence posts around a 44-acre open-space property say that 'wild rodents and other small mammals' including squirrels, prairie dogs and rabbits 'may be infected with plague.' The signs recommend people treat their pets with anti-flea medication, avoid open spaces where the plague has been confirmed and avoid contact 'with all sick or dead rodents.'\n\nOther advice:\n\n- Avoid fleas. Protect pets with flea powder or drops, or a new flea collar. Keep pets on a leash and out of wild rodent habitats.\n\n- Avoid all contact with wild rodents, including squirrels; do not feed or handle them.\n\n- Prevent rodent infestations around your house. Clear plants and material away from outside walls, reduce access to food items and set rodent traps.\n\n- Treat known rodent sites around your home with flea powder or a suitable insecticide.\n\nAccording to KUSA-TV, it is the 1st confirmed case of plague in Boulder County since 2011, when a domesticated cat and a dead squirrel tested positive for it. According to the Boulder County Public Health Department, 2 squirrels had been tested for plague earlier this year [2014], but those tests came back negative.\n\n'The fleas don't travel large distances, so it's nothing we're seeing spread or becoming an epidemic,' Lane Drager, consumer protection coordinator for Boulder County Public Health, told the Daily Camera.

Humans can be infected through 1) the bite of an infected flea carried by a rodent or, rarely, other animals; 2) direct contact with contaminated tissues; or 3) in rare cases, inhalation of respiratory secretions from infected people or animals.\n\nPlague is a potential bioterrorism agent. Human infections are rare but can be life-threatening. The case fatality rate of plague depends on the clinical presentation (that is, bubonic, septicemic, or pneumonic) and timing of initiation of antibiotic therapy; if untreated, the case fatality rate is over 50 per cent for bubonic plague and approaches 100 per cent for pneumonic plague (1). Rapid laboratory identification can help guide therapy.\n\nDomestic cats and dogs can also contract plague from infective fleas. They may carry infected fleas home to their owners or, especially with cats, serve as a direct source of infection. There are many flea treatments and repellents appropriate for pets available. Some products may be suitable for dogs but not cats or may be suitable for an adult but not a younger animal. Be sure to consult your veterinarian, as some products may be toxic to cats, kittens, and puppies, even resulting in fatalities.\n\nClinical signs in pets involve a localized swelling, such as under the jaw in cats, but also in the inguinal region or under the front leg (the armpit, if you will), lethargy, anorexia, and fever. Please take your pet to a veterinarian if you notice any abnormalities.\n\nVeterinarians should protect themselves by wearing gloves when examining these swellings. A bubo that ruptures may infect the veterinarian or even the pet owner if the pet owner is the one palpating the swelling.\n\nAnother form of the disease is the respiratory form. Cats may acquire this form and can spread it to their owners or the veterinarians through infected expiratory droplets. People are also prone to the respiratory infection.\n\nYou should also be aware that the fleas that hitchhike into your home on a pet can also transmit disease to you, the owner or caretaker of the pet. Sleeping in the same bed with dogs has been associated with plague in enzootic areas (2). Plague patients with no history of exposure to rodents can be infected by _Y. pestis_ if their pets carry infected rodent fleas into the home. Veterinarians always should recommend flea control to dog and cat owners.\n\nReferences\n----------\n1. CDC. Human plague -- four states, 2006.

'The plague is basically what's been here for centuries,' said 9NEWS Medical Expert Dr. John Torres. 'It's what caused the Black Death back in the Middle Ages.'\n\nEven though it doesn't kill people in large numbers like it once did, it is a serious disease. One man from Adams County [Colorado] is in the hospital recovering from a form of plague. The disease is part of the fabric of nature in Colorado now, found in rodents -- mainly prairie dogs. It's transmitted through the fleas they carry.\n\n'When the prairie dogs actually die, the fleas need somewhere to go. So once there is a prairie dog die-off, the fleas are out looking for somewhere to get a meal from,' said Jennifer House of the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment.\n\nIn the latest case, doctors discovered the owner of a dog contracted plague. Tests later showed the dog, which had died unexpectedly, also had the disease.\n\nThere are 3 types of plague; all can be potentially deadly, if not treated. The 1st is bubonic, which causes lymph nodes to swell. There is also septicemic, which comes about when the plague gets into the bloodstream. Finally, there is pneumonic, which is the kind the patient in Colorado has. Doctors said it can be especially worrisome. 'It's a type of pneumonia,' Dr. John said. 'It can be spread from person to person, and that's what makes it kind of scary and kind of dangerous.'\n\nThe Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment said there have been 12 cases of plague in Colorado in the past decade [2004-2014]. The last case of pneumonic plague was in 2004. 'In humans, it's actually become fairly rare,' House said. 'We don't see a lot of cases.'\n\nStill, experts said to protect yourself, insect repellent with DEET helps. They also recommend staying away from wildlife and making sure your pets do as well. The key is to make sure fleas that carry plague don't land on you.\n\nTo treat the plague, doctors give patients specific antimicrobial agents. As for how exactly the latest patient and the dog contracted the plague, the department of health said that was still under investigation.\n\n[Byline: Maya Rodriguez]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[2]\nDate: 9 Jul 2014\nSource: Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment\nhttps://www.colorado.gov/pacific/cdphe/news-release-pneumonic-plague-found-colorado-resident-and-pet-dog\n\n\nThe Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment laboratory yesterday [8 Jul 2014] identified pneumonic plague in a Colorado resident. Investigation revealed the family dog had recently died unexpectedly. The carcass was recovered and tested at the Colorado State University Veterinarian Diagnostic Laboratory, where tests were positive for plague.\n\nTri-County Health Department officials and the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment are working together to investigate the source of exposure and to identify those who may have been exposed through close contact with the individual. Any individuals exposed will be recommended for antibiotic treatment.\n\nThe patient and the dog may have been exposed in eastern Adams County. Plague is spread from fleas on rodents, most commonly prairie dogs. People walking in open spaces and trails should avoid contact with rodents.\n\nDr. Jennifer House, public health veterinarian at the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, encourages people take the following precautions to prevent plague exposure:\n\n- Do not directly handle any dead rodents.\n- Keep pets away from wildlife, especially dead rodents.\n- Don't let dogs or cats hunt prairie dogs or other rodents.\n- Don't allow pets to roam freely.\n- Treat all pets for fleas according to a veterinarian's advice.\n- Do not feed prairie dogs or other rodents - this attracts them to your property, brings them in close contact with other rodents and increases the risk of disease transmission.\n- Be aware of rodent populations in your area and report sudden die-offs or multiple dead animals to your local health department.\n\nContact your physician if you develop a high fever and other plague symptoms following a fleabite or direct contact with dead rodents. Symptoms of plague include a sudden onset of high fever, muscle pain, malaise, nausea and vomiting, or a general feeling of being ill. Individuals with bubonic plague will develop a large, swollen, painful lymph node in the area of a flea bite, usually in the groin or armpit. If untreated, the disease can enter the bloodstream or lungs, which are severe, life-threatening complications. Individuals with pneumonic plagues (the lung form) develop fever, headache, weakness, shortness of breath, chest pain, cough which can lead to respiratory failure. Pneumonic plague is the most serious form of the disease and is the only form of plague that can be spread from person to person (by infectious droplets from coughing). Although human cases occur infrequently, plague is severe and potentially life-threatening if not detected and quickly treated with common antibiotics.\n\nPlague often is identified when there is an unusual die-off of prairie dogs in an area. When an infected animal dies, the fleas leave the carcass to find another host, thus spreading the disease. Most human plague cases occur when humans are bitten by infected fleas. Less commonly, people are infected by direct contact with blood or tissues from an infected animal or from pets that become infected and transmit the disease. Since 1957, Colorado has identified 60 cases of human plague, 9 (15 percent) of which were fatal.\n\nAdditional information on plague can be found at: http://www.cdc.gov/plague\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Most cases of _Yersinia pestis_ infections in the USA are reported from the 4 Corners area of the USA where the states of Colorado, Utah, Arizona, and New Mexico come together.\n\nAs outlined by the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) and quoted in ProMED-mail post 20120601.1153277: 'Death from bubonic plague occurs after the bacterium _Yersinia pestis_ escapes from the infected bubo into the bloodstream (septicemic plague), causing the manifestations of the sepsis syndrome. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) with subsequent cutaneous hemorrhage may well have been what was called the 'Black Death' in the Middle Ages. The bacterium can spread to the lungs, causing a secondary plague pneumonia (secondary to the bacteremia), or to the meninges, causing a plague meningitis. Both of these events have a high case fatality rate, and the secondary plague pneumonia is the way the infection spreads (by aerosol) from person to person.\n\n'The typical sign of the most common form of human plague is a swollen and very tender lymph gland, accompanied by pain. The swollen gland is called a 'bubo.' Bubonic plague should be suspected when a person develops a swollen gland, fever, chills, headache, and extreme exhaustion, and has a history of possible exposure to infected rodents, rabbits, or fleas. A person usually becomes ill with bubonic plague 2 to 6 days after being infected.\n\n'When bubonic plague is left untreated, plague bacteria invade the bloodstream. As the plague bacteria multiply in the bloodstream, they spread rapidly throughout the body and cause a severe and often fatal condition. Infection of the lungs with the plague bacterium causes the pneumonic form of plague, a severe respiratory illness. The infected person may experience high fever, chills, cough, and breathing difficulty and may expel bloody sputum. If plague patients are not given specific antibiotic therapy, the disease can progress rapidly to death. About 14 per cent (1 in 7) of all plague cases in the United States are fatal.'\n\nAdams County is the 5th most populous of the 64 counties of the US state of Colorado.

This is the 1st known human plague case in the USA in 2014. The case developed right axillary bubonic plague which progressed to secondary septicemic plague and then to secondary pneumonic plague. Potentially exposed friends, family members and hospital staff are being evaluated and offered antibiotic prophylaxis if indicated. An environmental investigation will be done to look for possible rodent die off in the area due to plague.\n\n'The New Mexico Department of Health (NMDOH) is reporting a case of plague in a 57-year-old man from Torrance County who is currently hospitalized in critical condition. Confirmatory testing is being conducted at the NMDOH's Scientific Laboratory Division. This is the 1st human case of plague in New Mexico and in the USA in 2014. An environmental investigation will take place at the man's home to look for ongoing risk to others in the surrounding area.\n\n'An epidemiologic investigation and an environmental investigation around the home of the plague case are being conducted by NMDOH staff to look for ongoing risk and to ensure the safety of the immediate family and neighbors,' said Department of Health Secretary Retta Ward, MPH. 'Staff will go door-to-door to neighbors near the case to inform them about plague found in the area and educate them on reducing their risk. Health care providers and others close to the patient who have been determined to have been exposed are taking preventive antibiotic therapy.'\n\nPlague is a bacterial disease of rodents and is generally transmitted to humans through the bites of infected fleas, but can also be transmitted by direct contact with infected animals, including rodents, wildlife and pets.\n\n'Plague cases have occurred every month of the year in New Mexico, but most cases usually occur in the summer months,' said Dr. Paul Ettestad, public health veterinarian for the Department of Health. 'It is especially important now that it is warming up to take precautions to avoid rodents and their fleas which can expose you to plague. Pets that are allowed to roam and hunt can bring infected fleas from dead rodents back into the home, putting you and your children at risk.'\n\nTo prevent plague, the Department of Health recommends:\n- Avoid sick or dead rodents and rabbits, and their nests and burrows.\n- Keep your pets from roaming and hunting\n- Talk to your veterinarian about using an appropriate flea control product on your pets as not all products are safe for cats, dogs, or your children.\n- Clean up areas near the house where rodents could live, such as woodpiles, brush piles, junk and abandoned vehicles.\n- Sick pets should be examined promptly by a veterinarian.\n- See your doctor about any unexplained illness involving a sudden and severe fever.\n- Put hay, wood, and compost piles as far as possible from your home.\n- Don't leave your pet's food and water where mice can get to it.\n\nSymptoms of plague in humans include sudden onset of fever, chills, headache, and weakness. In most cases there is a painful swelling of the lymph node in the groin, armpit or neck areas. Plague symptoms in cats and dogs are fever, lethargy and loss of appetite. There may be a swelling in the lymph node under the jaw. With prompt diagnosis and appropriate antibiotic treatment, the fatality rate in people and pets can be greatly reduced. Physicians who suspect plague should promptly report to NMDOH.\n\nIn New Mexico, there were 4 human plague cases in 2013 with 1 fatality, 1 human plague case in 2012, 2 human cases of plague in 2011, no cases in 2010, and 6 human cases of plague in 2009, 1 of them fatal.'\n\n--\nPaul Ettestad DVM, MS\nState Public Health Veterinarian\nEpidemiology and Response Division\nNew Mexico Department of Health\n<Paul.Ettestad@state.nm.us>\n\n[ProMED thanks Dr. Ettestad for this report.\n\nIndeed, the development of secondary pneumonic plague caused by _Yersinia pestis_ disseminating to the lungs causes the distinct potential of human-to-human transmission of the infection.

Christophe Rogier, director of the Pasteur Institute in Madagascar, revealed information that was not reassuring in his progress report for the fight against the plague in prisons launched by the Ministry of Public Health, by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and by the prison administration.\n\n'The plague remains sporadic but is much more deadly than malaria. The disease can emerge in a locality where the epidemic has not yet hit, as was the case in Ambilobe in 2011. This sporadic case that was not contained can thus turn into an epidemic. We must be very careful because we get a case of plague each week all over the island,' said Christophe Rogier.\n\nThe main cause of the resurgence of the disease is not very clear. Some doctors argue that the bush fires are pushing the rats to seek refuge in the homes. They carry fleas infected by the plague, then transmit the disease to humans. This theory is in part true, says Christophe Rogier, but the people infected by the plague in Ambilobe lived in the forest in a mining site far from bush fires.\n\nOn the other hand, prisons which usually get a lot of cases of plague have not reported any cases yet. In 2012, thanks to the pest control campaign carried out by the ICRC in the prison of Antanimora, 1600 rats were caught. The short film, made by the ICRC to alert people to the fight against this disease, was a moving testimony for a different reason. The prisoners did not get infected by the plague, but the son of the district chief of Miari\u00adnarivo, Justin Tata.\n\n'Plague can infect the whole world. The change in behavior must be priority number one,' emphasized Christoph Vogt, regional head of delegation of the ICRC in the Indian Ocean.\n\nFaced with this situation, Philemon Tafangy, general secretary of the ministry of public health, accused other entities. 'Let's not only accuse the ministry of public health, but let's ask the right questions: Who should collect the trash so as not to attract the rats? Who is responsible for the lack of drugs in the health centers? Who is in charge of prohibiting bush fires in order not to disturb the natural habitat of rodents? Who should encourage people to go to health centers when they are sick?' he asked.\n\n[Byline: Vonjy Radasimalala]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Plague continues to occur on the island of Madagascar at a slow rate. - Mod.LL\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/r/1kSe.]", "summary": "A ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n PLAGUE - MADAGASCAR\n*******************\n Christophe Rogier, director of the Pasteur Institute in Madagascar, revealed information that was not reassuring in his progress report for the fight against the plague in prisons launched by the Ministry of Public Health, by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and by the prison administration.

That the genetics of the Justinian plague were different from the Black Death proves nothing, except that more than one plague strain has the power to provoke -- under the right circumstances -- a pandemic. Nothing new in that. Plague with pandemic potential has been out there in Central Asia for centuries. There were 3 separate huge outbreaks of pneumonic plague in Manchuria in the early 20th century, which killed a total of 85 000 people. But a worldwide pandemic never broke out, even without antibiotics, because the intelligent doctors who rushed into Manchuria imposed ultimately successful quarantines. Otherwise, at least one of those outbreaks could have reached Peking [Beijing], and that could have been nasty indeed, though a worldwide pandemic on the scale of the Black Death still would have been most unlikely. As the great plague doctor Wu Lien-teh said, no disease is so susceptible to quarantine as plague. And he was speaking of the worst form of plague, pneumonic plague.\n\nThe Justinian plague, unlike the Black Death, was probably never very communicable -- there is no evidence of contagion from any of the primary sources. The Prophet Muhammad, who witnessed later stages of the pandemic, noted its random pattern -- that plague appeared to strike out of nowhere -- and concluded that the disease was God's gift. During the Black Death, Muslim physicians who witnessed contagion and insisted the disease spread through contact got into serious trouble for contradicting the Prophet. But they were observing a different disease pattern altogether than the one Muhammad saw. The Justinian plague seems to have rat- and rat-flea-borne bubonic plague, which was fostered by the immense storehouses of grain erected by Emperor Justinian, and by the grain trade across the Mediterranean from the great grain-growing regions of North Africa, from where it 1st burst into humanity. The Central Asian origins of the Justinian plague remain quite likely -- though there is nothing new in this observation: to gerbils and grass rats, Asia and Africa are one long habitat. The Justinian plague was most parallel to the plague outbreak in India in the early 20th century, which followed the same pattern: random 'strikes' not shared in households, and no evidence of contagion. This is what the late plague expert Robert Pollitzer called 'zoonotic plague' as opposed to the 'demic' plague of the Black Death and the Manchurian outbreaks, which is human-to-human borne.\n\nAnyone studying the Justinian plague and the Black Death would have realized that, given the pattern of transmission alone, these were very different outbreaks, and therefore had to be very different genetically. Proving this tells us nothing, since the researchers cannot possibly pinpoint which genetic changes signal human-to human transmission.\n\nThe most important point is that social conditions on earth have changed so dramatically that it is impossible to imagine, except in the case of a bioterrorist using the right plague strain with the genetic potential to transmit immediately lung-to-lung (and good luck with that -- the Soviets knew how to identify those strains, but at this point the likelihood of a bioterrorist repeating their discoveries seems vanishingly small) and then adding in antibiotic resistance. But that sort of plague outbreak could be handled with quarantine.\n\nA natural Black Death? Seriously -- does anybody believe this? People would be immediately isolated and treated with antibiotics, as happens in Central Asia all the time. It's also important to remember that the Black Death wasn't just pneumonic, it was bubonic also. And this wouldn't be the rat-rat-flea pattern seen in the Justinian Plague. This was 'demic' bubonic plague, spread by the so-called human flea, _Pulex irritans_. Both those conditions, uncontrolled pneumonic plague and human-to-human flea-borne transmission via _P. irritans_, were necessary to produce the Black Death. So was ignorance, and filth, and the updated Mongolian Silk Road, which provided rapid transportation out of Central Asia.\n\nAnother Black Death? Most unlikely.\n\nOh, and by the way, the Athenian plague (as even a cursory look at Thucydides would reveal) was not, and could not have been, the plague; that outbreak -- complete with secondary outbreaks of Brill-Zinsser's -- disease was almost certainly typhus. And the Antonine plague -- probably smallpox or measles -- wasn't caused by _Yersinia pestis_ either.\n\n_Y. pestis_ is still out there in rodents, as it has been for millennia. I wouldn't lose any sleep over it.\n\n--\nWendy Orent-Goldman\nLecturer, Emory University\nAtlanta, Georgia\nUSA\n<orentw@bellsouth.net>\n\n******\n[2]\nDate: Tue 4 Feb 2014\nFrom: Hugh Baker <drhugh@sympatico.ca> [edited]\n\n\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, the prevailing epidemiology was that the Mongol hoards brought the plague with them, the famine that stimulated the Mongol migration west having driven together the various grain-hungry vectors required for a pandemic of _Yersinia pestis_. This point of view was partly driven by anti-Chinese politics of the time.\n\nToward the end of the 20th century, there was some thought that the Romans imported the plague accidentally into the Mediterranean area by their incessant exploration of central Africa looking for ivory. The deeper into the forest the searches penetrated, the more they were exposed to the wild rodent vector of the bacillus, thus allowing the ship-board rats to acquire the fleas of the rodents of the deep forest. Due to the habit of burying at sea crew or passengers that died in transit, it took a while for human cases to manifest in Roman cities. If this scenario is true, it is probable that the Mongols took the plague BACK to the Far East, thus introducing it to a naive population.\n\nThat the Justinian strain and the Hong Kong strain are so significantly different may be an example of isolation of a population and allowing it to diverge by rapid expansion into a new niche.\n\n--\nHugh J Baker, DVM\nEtobicoke, Ontario\nCanada\n<drhugh@sympatico.ca>\n\n[ProMED-mail thanks the authors for their comments.

Research into one of the most devastating pandemics in human history - the Plague of Justinian, where half the world's population died - found evidence that such an episode could happen again. Scientists who isolated genetic traces of the plague from the teeth of 2 1500-year-old victims found it was caused by a distinctly different bacterial strain from that responsible for the later Black Death.\n\nBoth scourges were triggered by the bubonic plague bacterium, _Yersinia pestis_, which can be spread from rats [or other infected rodents - Mod. LL] to humans by fleas. The new research shows that the 2 infectious organisms were distinct strains. While the Justinian strain vanished from the Earth, the Black Death strain gave rise to another pandemic in the late 1800s. The discovery suggests that a new deadly strain of plague could strike again without warning.\n\nDr Dave Wagner, a member of the international team of scientists from Northern Arizona University in the USA, said: 'We know the bacterium _Y. pestis_ has jumped from rodents into humans throughout history and rodent reservoirs of plague still exist today in many parts of the world.\n\n'If the Justinian plague could erupt in the human population, cause a massive pandemic, and then die out, it suggests it could happen again. Fortunately we now have antibiotics that could be used to effectively treat plague, which lessens the chances of another large-scale human pandemic.' The Plague of Justinian struck in the 6th century and is estimated to have killed between 30 million and 50 million people as it spread across Asia, North Africa, the Middle East and Europe - virtually half the world's population at the time. Some 800 years later, the Black Death wiped out 50 million Europeans between 1347 and 1351.\n\nThe scientists managed to recover tiny DNA fragments of the bacterium from the teeth of two Justinian plague victims buried in Bavaria, Germany. From these short remnants they reconstructed the genome of the Justinian strain of _Y. pestis_ and compared it with a database of more than 100 contemporary strains.\n\nThe findings, published online in the journal The Lancet Infectious Diseases, revealed that the strain responsible for the Justinian plague was an evolutionary 'dead end'. It came, did its damage, and disappeared from the Earth, having no connection with the later Black Death.\n\nThe 19th century pandemic which spread across the globe from Hong Kong was a likely descendant of the more successful Black Death strain, said the scientists.\n\nExperts now think the Justinian strain of _Y. pestis_ originated in Asia, not in Africa as originally thought. But there was no molecular evidence of a link with earlier smaller epidemics such as the Plague of Athens in 430 BC and the Antonine Plague between the years 165 and 180.\nThese outbreaks could also represent separate, independent emergences of Y. pestis strains capable of infecting humans, it is believed.\n\n'This study raises intriguing questions about why a pathogen that was both so successful and so deadly died out,' said Australian co-author Dr Edward Holmes, from the University of Sydney. 'One testable possibility is that human populations evolved to become less susceptible.'\n\n[Byline: Jessica Best]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED Rapporteur Kunihiko Iizuka\n\n\n\n[The paper highlighted is : Wagner DM, lunkheads J, Harbeck M, et al: Yersinia pestis and the Plague of Justinian 541--543 AD: a genomic analysis.

The second (Black Death, 14--17th centuries) and third (19--20th centuries) have been genetically characterised, but there is only a limited understanding of the first pandemic, the Plague of Justinian (6--8th centuries). To address this gap, we sequenced and analysed draft genomes of _Y. pestis_ obtained from two individuals who died in the first pandemic.\n\nMethods\n-------\nTeeth were removed from two individuals (known as A120 and A76) from the early medieval Aschheim-Bajuwarenring cemetery (Aschheim, Bavaria, Germany). We isolated DNA from the teeth using a modified phenol-chloroform method. We screened DNA extracts for the presence of the _Y. pestis_ specific pla gene on the pPCP1 plasmid using primers and standards from an established assay, enriched the DNA, and then sequenced it. We reconstructed draft genomes of the infectious _Y. pestis_ strains, compared them with a database of genomes from 131 _Y. pestis_ strains from the second and third pandemics, and constructed a maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree.\n\nFindings\n-------\nRadiocarbon dating of both individuals (A120 to 533 AD [plus or minus 98 years]; A76 to 504 AD [plus or minus 61 years]) places them in the timeframe of the first pandemic. Our phylogeny contains a novel branch (100 percent bootstrap at all relevant nodes) leading to the two Justinian samples. This branch has no known contemporary representatives, and thus is either extinct or unsampled in wild rodent reservoirs. The Justinian branch is interleaved between two extant groups, 0.ANT1 and 0.ANT2, and is distant from strains associated with the second and third pandemics.\n\nInterpretation\n------------\nWe conclude that the _Y. pestis_ lineages that caused the Plague of Justinian and the Black Death 800 years later were independent emergences from rodents into human beings. These results show that rodent species worldwide represent important reservoirs for the repeated emergence of diverse lineages of _Y. pestis_ into human populations.\n\nOnce again, this is another study that underscores how Mother Nature remains the World's best bioterrorist. with MERS-CoV, influenza H5N1 and H7N9, and others, she continues to challenge us.

Redclaw has also been grown in New Zealand, Southeast Asia, Africa, Central and South America, and the US.\n\nThey are often called 'freshwater lobsters' for their physical resemblance and large size -- red claw can grow to over one pound (454 g; http://www.ncagr.gov/markets/aquaculture/aussieredclawcrayfish.pdf and http://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/fisheries/pests-diseases/freshwater-pests/species/redclaw).\n\nRedclaw are tolerant of a broad range of environmental conditions, have a simple reproductive cycle and fast growth rates which has generated interest in the species for commercial aquaculture and ornamental aquarium use.\n\nThe name 'redclaw' comes from the fact that mature male specimens display distinctive red patches on the claws. The male is larger than the female reaching a maximum of 25 cm (9.8 in) in length and weight up to 600 g (1.3 lb). In their native range, redclaw inhabit a diversity of freshwater habitats including still ponds, small creeks, isolated rock pools, and fast flowing rivers (http://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/fisheries/pests-diseases/freshwater-pests/species/redclaw).\n\nRedclaw (_Cherax quadricarinatus_) photos can be seen at http://www.fao.org/fishery/culturedspecies/Cherax_quadricarinatus/en#tcNA003F.\n\nMaps of Taiwan are available at http://www.ephotopix.com/taiwan_admin_map.html and http://healthmap.org/r/1ob5. - Mod.CRD]", "summary": "Population type: farmed\nProduction system: semi-closed\nAffected animals:\nSpecies / Morbidity / Mortality / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered\n Population type: farmed\nProduction system: semi-closed\nAffected animals:\nSpecies / Morbidity / Mortality / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered\n Population type: farmed\nProduction system: semi-closed\nAffected animals:\nSpecies / Morbidity / Mortality / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered\n Population type: farmed\nProduction system: semi-closed\nAffected animals:\nSpecies / Morbidity / Mortality / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered\n Population type: farmed\nProduction system: semi-closed\nAffected animals:\nSpecies / Morbidity / Mortality / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered\n Reason for notification: 1st occurrence of a listed disease\nManifestation of disease: clinical disease\nCausal agent: _Aphanomyces astaci_\nNature of diagnosis: laboratory (basic), laboratory (advanced), necropsy\n A ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n Measures applied: quarantine;

The cases have been recorded at various geographical locations: Mandritsara in the north, Soanierana Ivongo in the [northeast], Ikongo in the southwest, and Tsiroanomandidy in the central highlands.\n\nDr Voahangy Ravaoalimalala, vice-director of the Malagasy Institut Pasteur, which performs pathogen tests for the health ministry in Antananarivo, told IRIN: 'Bubonic plague can be treated easily with antibiotics, but this time some cases of pneumonic plague have also been identified. This form of plague is harder to treat, as it can kill people within 3 days.'\n\nMost cases of the 3 common plague forms are bubonic. Between 2 and 8 days after exposure, the patient develops fever and chills, as well as the [painful] swelling of lymph nodes -- the buboes -- to which the bacteria move and where they multiply. The 2nd is septicemic plague, with a fatality rate of 50 percent -- higher than bubonic --, and the 3rd is pneumonic plague, which is fatal in all cases unless the patient is given antibiotics as soon as the symptoms appear.\n\nThe health ministry notes that between 300 and 600 cases of bubonic plague occur annually in Madagascar, usually between October and March. Despite some anxiety in the capital, Antananarivo, and local media reports that there was a suspected case of plague in Manjakandriana, 20 km [12.4 mi] from the densely populated city, the cases and fatalities have occurred in fairly isolated areas. 2 weeks ago, officials announced Antananarivo's coffers were empty and there was no money to spare for rubbish collection. Refuse has been piling up in the city, encouraging the spread of rats and mice. The UN Development Programme (UNDP) and the European Union (EU) have donated money and equipment, and have mobilized volunteers to assist in clearing the city of garbage.\n\nAccording to the WHO, 21 725 persons were infected with plague worldwide in the 1st decade of the 21st century, accounting for 1612 deaths and a case fatality rate of 7.4 percent.\n\nIn many countries the disease has retreated as a result of access to medication, rodent-proof housing and better urban hygiene, but living conditions in Madagascar's highland villages -- where people often store their rice crops in their homes -- attract rats and make the country more prone to plague outbreaks. According to WHO, bubonic plague is endemic in many parts of Africa, and 'the most heavily affected African countries are the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Madagascar, Mozambique, Uganda and Tanzania.'\n\nPlague is thought to have arrived in Madagascar in 1898, carried by infected rats on ships from India. As a result of vaccination campaigns, improved housing and public hygiene, and the discovery of streptomycin and the use of insecticides, plague was brought under control in the 1950s.\n\nDuring the next 30 years, only 20 to 50 cases per year were reported in Madagascar, but since 1989 the number of suspected cases has increased steadily.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The numbers in this UN IRIN report differ slightly from previous reports of the current _Yersinia pestis_ infection situation on the island nation of Madagascar.

Tests were carried out after at least 20 people in the village, near the northwestern town of Mandritsara, were reported to have died last week.\n\nThe International Committee of the Red Cross warned in October 2013 that Madagascar was at risk of a plague epidemic.\n\nThe disease is transmitted to humans via fleas, usually from rats, and is caused by the bacterium _Yersinia pestis_. Essentially a disease of wild rodents spread by fleas, plague spreads to humans either by the bite of infected fleas or rats and does not spread from person to person. Patients develop swollen, tender lymph glands (called buboes) and fever, headache, chills, and weakness. It is treatable if caught early but can be lethal.\n\nIn 2012, Madagascar had 60 deaths from the plague, the world's highest recorded number. The Pasteur Institute of Madagascar confirmed on Tue 10 Dec 2013 that tests taken from bodies in the village last week showed that they had died of the bubonic plague.\n\nThe BBC's Tim Healy in the capital, Antananarivo, says health officials have now gone to the remote area to investigate.\n\nThe Pasteur Institute said there were concerns that the disease could spread to towns and cities where living standards have declined since a coup in 2009 and the ensuing political crisis.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Plague is caused by the _Yersinia pestis_ bacillus, carried by rat fleas. At the start of the rainy season, currently, rats flee the sewers of Madagascar in massive numbers and take refuge in people's cottages. [The following paragraph of this posting is from 1998 (Chanteau S, Ratsifasoamanana L, Rasoamanana B, et al: Plague, a Reemerging Disease in Madagascar. Emerg Infect Dis 1998; 4: 101-4:; http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/4/1/98-0114_article.htm]:\n\n'Between 1930 and 1990, bubonic plague had 'virtually disappeared' on the island due to efficient pest-control and good health management. However, since 1990, an annual 200 cases are being reported, and bubonic plague takes on epidemic form, especially in the port of Mahajanga each year. In the capital city of Antananarivo, more cases are also being notified each year since 1990. Madagascar (pop. 13 million) has accounted for 45 percent of all the cases of plague in Africa.'\n\nFatalities related to plague usually are caused by spread of the organism from the bubo (the very painful infected lymph node which drains the area where the flea bite occurred) to the bloodstream. The bacteremia [presence of bacteria in the blood] can cause a coagulopathy [clotting disorder, an impairment of the blood's ability to clot] producing the purpura [red or purple discolorations on the skin] seen in the 'Black Plague' and can also spread to the lungs, causing a hemorrhagic pneumonia. It is the pneumonia that can facilitate person-to-person transmission.\n\nMadagascar was the location of the isolation of multi-antimicrobial resistant _Y. pestis_ in 1995 (Galimand M, Guiyoule A, Gerbaud G, et al: Multidrug resistance in _Yersinia pestis_ mediated by a transferable plasmid.

Although long regarded as fungi, this group, the Oomycetida, are now considered protists and are classified with diatoms and brown algae in a group called the Stramenopiles or Chromista.\n\nThe 1st reports of large crayfish mortalities go back to 1860 in Italy. These were followed by further reports of crayfish mortalities, where no other aquatic species were affected, in the Franco-German border region in the 3rd quarter of the 19th century. From there a steady spread of infection occurred, principally in 2 directions: down the Danube into the Balkans and towards the Black Sea, and across the North German plain into Russia and from there south to the Black Sea and north west to Finland and, in 1907, to Sweden. In the 1960s, the 1st outbreaks in Spain were reported, and in the 1980s further extensions of infection to the British Isles, Turkey, Greece and Norway followed. The reservoir of the original infections in the 19th century was never established; _Orconectes_ spp. were not known to have been introduced until the 1890s, but the post-1960s extensions are largely linked to movements of North American crayfish introduced more recently for purposes of crayfish farming. Escapes of such introduced species were almost impossible to prevent, and _Pacifastacus leniusculus_ and _Procambarus clarkii_ are now widely naturalised in many parts of Europe.\n\nTo date, all species of freshwater crayfish have to be considered as susceptible to infection with _Aphanomyces astaci_.\n\nThe target tissue that becomes initially infected is the exoskeleton cuticle.

The bacterium can spread to the lungs, causing a secondary plague pneumonia (secondary to the bacteremia), or to the meninges, causing a plague meningitis. Both of these events have a high case fatality rate and the secondary plague pneumonia is the way the infection spreads (by aerosol) from person to person.\n\n'The typical sign of the most common form of human plague is a swollen and very tender lymph gland, accompanied by pain. The swollen gland is called a 'bubo.' Bubonic plague should be suspected when a person develops a swollen gland, fever, chills, headache, and extreme exhaustion, and has a history of possible exposure to infected rodents, rabbits, or fleas. A person usually becomes ill with bubonic plague 2 to 6 days after being infected.\n\n'When bubonic plague is left untreated, plague bacteria invade the bloodstream. As the plague bacteria multiply in the bloodstream, they spread rapidly throughout the body and cause a severe and often fatal condition. Infection of the lungs with the plague bacterium causes the pneumonic form of plague, a severe respiratory illness. The infected person may experience high fever, chills, cough, and breathing difficulty and may expel bloody sputum.

Researchers in the College of Science at Oregon State University [OSU] say these SCSD viruses are associated with a dramatic increase in the white plague that has erupted in recent decades.\n\nPrior to this, it had been believed that the white plague was caused primarily by bacterial pathogens. Researchers are anxious to learn more about this disease and possible ways to prevent it, because its impact on coral reef health has exploded.\n\n'20 years ago you had to look pretty hard to find any occurrences of this disease, and now it's everywhere,' said Nitzan Soffer, a doctoral student in the Department of Microbiology at OSU and lead author on a new study just published in the International Society for Microbial Ecology. 'It moves fast and can wipe out a small coral colony in a few days.\n\n'In recent years the white plague has killed 70-80 percent of some coral reefs,' Soffer said. 'There are 20 or more unknown pathogens that affect corals and in the past we've too-often overlooked the role of viruses, which sometimes can spread very fast.'\n\nThis is one of the 1st studies to show viral association with a severe disease epidemic, scientists said. It was supported by the National Science Foundation.\n\nMarine wildlife diseases are increasing in prevalence, the researchers pointed out. Reports of non-bleaching coral disease have increased more than 50 times since 1965, and are contributing to declines in coral abundance and cover.\n\nWhite plague is one of the worst. It causes rapid tissue loss, affects many species of coral, and can cause partial or total colony mortality. Some, but not all types are associated with bacteria. Now it appears that viruses also play a role. Corals with white plague disease have higher viral diversity than their healthy counterparts, the study concluded.\n\nIncreasing temperatures that stress corals and make them more vulnerable may be part of the equation, because the disease often appears to be at its worst by the end of summer.\n\nOverfishing that allows more algae to grow on corals may help spread pathogens, researchers said, as can pollution caused by sewage outflows in some marine habitats.\n\nViral infection, by itself, does not necessarily cause major problems, the researchers noted. Many healthy corals are infected with herpes-like viruses that are persistent but not fatal, as in many other vertebrate hosts, including humans.\n\n[Byline: David Stauth]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[In the Caribbean, corals suffer 4 common diseases: Caribbean coral disease, yellow-band disease, dark-spot syndrome and white-plague disease. Recent modelling work suggested that these diseases do not follow a contagious-disease model. Coral diseases may have multiple interacting causes. Coral reefs worldwide are threatened by increasing anthropogenic stressors, particularly overfishing and the problems associated with global climate change. Coral disease is recognized as another problem causing the degradation of reefs, which is demonstrated by a global increase in the numbers of coral diseases, coral species affected and disease outbreaks. The hypothesis that most closely matches the data is that environmental thresholds are exceeded, and then these environmental conditions either weaken the corals, which are then more susceptible to infection, or the conditions increase the virulence or abundance of pathogens. Exceeding such environmental thresholds will most likely become increasingly common in rapidly warming oceans, leading to more frequent coral disease outbreaks, where diverse components of the parasite community will be implicated.\n\nA picture of a coral with white plague can be accessed at http://cdn.c.photoshelter.com/img-get/I0000gsabEkdmNIM/s/750/750/MPOFL294.jpg. - Mod.

' \n\nIncreasing temperatures that stress corals and make them more vulnerable may be part of the equation, because the disease often appears to be at its worst by the end of summer. \n\nOverfishing that allows more algae to grow on corals may help spread pathogens, researchers said, as can pollution caused by sewage outflows in some marine habitats. Reports of non-bleaching coral disease have increased more than 50 times since 1965, and are contributing to declines in coral abundance and cover. Corals with white plague disease have higher viral diversity than their healthy counterparts, the study concluded. Exceeding such environmental thresholds will most likely become increasingly common in rapidly warming oceans, leading to more frequent coral disease outbreaks, where diverse components of the parasite community will be implicated.

The Red Cross and Pasteur Institute say inmates in the island's rat-infested jails are particularly at risk.\n\nThe number of cases rises each October as hot humid weather attracts [promotes breeding of] fleas, which transmit the disease from rats and other animals to humans. Madagascar had 256 plague cases and 60 deaths in 2012, the world's highest recorded number.\n\nBubonic plague, known as the Black Death when it killed an estimated 25 million people in Europe during the Middle Ages, is now rare. Bubonic plague swept through Europe in the 14th Century, killing between one third and one half of the entire population. But the Black Death, as it was called, seemed to disappear some time in the 17th Century, and many people today assume it has died out completely. In fact bubonic plague remains a serious public health problem in many parts of the world. In Madagascar [and Mongolia and the western USA], plague is endemic in the animal population, and cannot be eradicated.\n\nThe prevalence of rats in Madagascar's prisons means the plague can spread easily. Fleas from plague-carrying rats infect prisoners, prison guards and visitors. And rats, unlike the prisoners, can go in and out of jail anytime. The threat to the general population is clear.\n\nOctober is regarded as the start of the plague season in Madagascar. The hot, humid weather means more fleas, and more risk of disease.\n\nThe International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) in Geneva and the Pasteur Institute have worked with local health groups in Madagascar since February 2012 on a campaign to improve prison hygiene. 'If the plague gets into prisons there could be a sort of atomic explosion of plague within the town. The prison walls will never prevent the plague from getting out and invading the rest of the town,' said the institute's Christophe Rogier.\n\nThe ICRC said the 3000 inmates of Antanimora, the main prison in the heart of the capital Antananarivo, live with a huge rat population which spreads infected fleas through food supplies, bedding, and clothing.\n\nThe ICRC's Evaristo Oliviera said this could affect not only inmates and staff, but others they come into contact with. 'A prison is not a sealed place, first of all the staff themselves who work in the prison are at risk, and they go home at the end of the day, already perhaps being a vector of the disease,' he told the BBC. 'Also the rats themselves, they can go in and out of the jail and also propagate the disease. And the prisoners do have visitors who can be also infected, and the prisoners eventually go out as well so we have many, many ins and outs for the disease to spread.'\n\nThe BBC's Imogen Foulkes in Geneva says the eradication project undertaken by the ICRC is tricky because simply killing the rats is not enough. To prevent their infected fleas transferring to another host, possibly a human, the insects must be destroyed as well as the rodents, she says.\n\nExperts say that Africa -- especially Madagascar and the Democratic Republic of Congo -- accounts for more than 90 percent of cases worldwide. During the last 20 years, at least 3 countries experienced outbreaks of human plague after dormant periods of about 30-50 years, experts say. These areas were India in 1994 and 2002, Indonesia in 1997 and Algeria in 2003. According to the WHO, the last significant outbreak of bubonic plague was in Peru in 2010 when 12 people were found to have been infected.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[As yet, in 2013, there have been no reported cases of plague infection on the island nation of Madagascar [for 2012, see ProMED archives below].\n\nPlague is caused by the _Yersinia pestis_ bacillus, carried by rat fleas. At the start of the rainy season, currently, rats flee the sewers of Madagascar in massive numbers and take refuge in people's cottages. [The following paragraph of this posting is from 1998 (Chanteau S, Ratsifasoamanana L, Rasoamanana B, et al: Plague, a Reemerging Disease in Madagascar.

However since 1990, an annual 200 cases are being reported and bubonic plague takes on epidemic form especially in the port of Mahajanga each year. In the capital city of Antananarivo more cases are also being notified each year since 1990. Madagascar (pop. 13 million) has accounted for 45 percent of all the cases of plague in Africa.'\n\nFatalities related to plague usually are caused by spread of the organism from the bubo (the very painful infected lymph node which drains the area where the flea bite occurred) to the bloodstream. The bacteremia can cause a coagulopathy producing the purpura seen in the 'Black Plague' and also spread to the lungs causing a hemorrhagic pneumonia. It is the pneumonia that can facilitate person-to-person transmission.\n\nMadagascar was the location of the isolation of multi-antimicrobial resistant _Y. pestis_ in 1995 (Galimand M, Guiyoule A, Gerbaud G, et al: Multidrug resistance in _Yersinia pestis_ mediated by a transferable plasmid.

An environmental investigation will take place at the girl's home to look for ongoing risk to others in the surrounding area.\n\n'Everyone needs to avoid sick or dead rodents and rabbits and their nests and burrows,' said Department of Health Secretary Retta Ward, MPH. 'Families should also talk to their veterinarian about an appropriate flea product for their pets.'\n\nPlague is a bacterial disease of rodents and is generally transmitted to humans through the bites of infected fleas but can also be transmitted by direct contact with infected animals, including rodents, wildlife and pets. 'Unfortunately, it is not possible to eradicate plague from the rodent population or to totally eliminate risk to residents who live in areas where there is plague,' said Dr. Paul Ettestad, public health veterinarian for the Department of Health. 'Education about how plague is transmitted to people and what steps can be taken to reduce your risk are key in preventing future cases of this potentially deadly disease.'\n\nTo prevent plague, the Department of Health also recommends:\n- Keep your pets from roaming and hunting.\n- Clean up areas near the house where rodents could live, such as woodpiles, brush piles, junk and abandoned vehicles.\n- Sick pets should be examined promptly by a veterinarian.\n- See your doctor about any unexplained illness involving a sudden and severe fever.\n- Put hay, wood, and compost piles as far as possible from your home.\n- Don't leave your pet's food and water where mice can get to it.\n\nSymptoms of plague in humans include sudden onset of fever, chills, headache, and weakness. In most cases, there is a painful swelling of the lymph node in the groin, armpit or neck areas. Plague symptoms in cats and dogs are fever, lethargy and loss of appetite. There may be a swelling in the lymph node under the jaw. With prompt diagnosis and appropriate antibiotic treatment, the fatality rate in people and pets can be greatly reduced. Physicians who suspect plague should promptly report to the New Mexico Department of Health.\n\nThe 1st human plague case in New Mexico this year [2013] was reported in August 2013 in a 15-year-old boy from Torrance County. There was one human plague case in New Mexico in 2012, 2 human cases of plague in 2011, no cases in 2010, and 6 human cases of plague in 2009, one of them fatal.\n\nThis case of bubonic plague (left femoral lymphadenopathy) had antibiotics prior to any cultures being done, so there was no growth on culture.

It is therefore likely to be the case that the other cases were also acquired from flea bites and not from exposure to the teenager who died. The death is likely to have been caused by septicemia from the infection or pneumonia.\n\nDeath from bubonic plague occurs after the bacterium _Yersinia pestis_ escapes from the infected bubo into the bloodstream (septicemic plague) causing the manifestations of the sepsis syndrome. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) with subsequent cutaneous hemorrhage may well have been what was called the 'Black Death' in the Middle Ages. The bacterium can spread to the lungs, causing a secondary plague pneumonia (secondary to the bacteremia), or to the meninges, causing a plague meningitis. Both of these events have a high case fatality rate and the secondary plague pneumonia is the way the infection spreads (by aerosol) from person to person.\n\nThe typical sign of the most common form of human plague is a swollen and very tender lymph gland, accompanied by pain. The swollen gland is called a 'bubo.' Bubonic plague should be suspected when a person develops a swollen gland, fever, chills, headache, and extreme exhaustion, and has a history of possible exposure to infected rodents, rabbits, or fleas. A person usually becomes ill with bubonic plague 2 to 6 days after being infected.\n\nWhen bubonic plague is left untreated, plague bacteria invade the bloodstream. As the plague bacteria multiply in the bloodstream, they spread rapidly throughout the body and cause a severe and often fatal condition. Infection of the lungs with the plague bacterium causes the pneumonic form of plague, a severe respiratory illness. The infected person may experience high fever, chills, cough, and breathing difficulty and may expel bloody sputum. If plague patients are not given specific antibiotic therapy, the disease can progress rapidly to death. About 14 per cent (1 in 7) of all plague cases in the United States are fatal.\n\nPortions of this comment have been extracted from http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvbid/plague/resources/plagueFactSheet.pdf.\n\nThe marmot is the most common reservoir for _Yersinia pestis_ in eastern Asia. The etymology of the term 'marmot' is uncertain (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marmot). It may have arisen from the Gallo-Romance prefix marm-, meaning to mumble or murmur (an example of onomatopoeia). Another possible origin is post-classical Latin, mus montanus, meaning 'mountain mouse'.

It is found in animals throughout the world, most commonly in rats, but also in other rodents like ground squirrels, prairie dogs, chipmunks, rabbits and voles. Fleas typically serve as the vector of plague. Human cases have been linked to domestic cats and dogs that bring infected fleas into the house.\n\nBubonic plague is the most common form of plague. In this form, the bacteria typically enter the body through the bite of an infected flea or rodent. The bacteria then infect the lymphatic system. After a few days to week, the person will experience fever, chills, weakness, and swollen lymph glands. These are called buboes. Untreated, bubonic plague is fatal about half the time.\n\n_Yersinia pestis_ is treatable with antibiotics if started early enough. Members of the public who see dead ground squirrels in recreational areas, or who want more information about precautions, should contact the LA County Department of Public Health, Vector Management Program at (626) 430-5450.\n\n[byline: Robert Herriman]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Plague, caused by _Yersinia pestis_, is enzootic among rodents in the western USA. Humans can be infected through 1) the bite of an infected flea carried by a rodent or, rarely, other animals; 2) direct contact with contaminated tissues; or 3) in rare cases, inhalation of respiratory secretions from infected people or animals.\n\nPlague is a potential bioterrorism agent. Human infections are rare but can be life-threatening. The case fatality rate of plague depends on the clinical presentation (that is, bubonic, septicemic, or pneumonic) and timing of initiation of antibiotic therapy; if untreated, the case fatality rate is over 50 per cent for bubonic plague and approaches 100 per cent for pneumonic plague (1). Rapid laboratory identification can help guide therapy.\n\nDomestic cats and dogs can also contract plague from infective fleas. They may carry infected fleas home to their owners or, especially with cats, serve as a direct source of infection. There are many flea treatments and repellents appropriate for pets available. Some products may be suitable for dogs but not cats or may be suitable for an adult but not a younger animal. Be sure to consult your veterinarian, as some products may be toxic to cats, kittens, and puppies, even resulting in fatalities.\n\nClinical signs in pets involve a localized swelling, such as under the jaw in cats, but also in the inguinal region or under the front leg (the armpit, if you will), lethargy, anorexia, and fever. Please take your pet to a veterinarian if you notice any abnormalities.\n\nVeterinarians should protect themselves by wearing gloves when examining these swellings. A bubo that ruptures may infect the veterinarian or even the pet owner if the pet owner is the one palpating the swelling.\n\nAnother form of the disease is the respiratory form. Cats may acquire this form and can spread it to their owners or the veterinarians through infected expiratory droplets. People are also prone to the respiratory infection.\n\nYou should also be aware that the fleas that hitchhike into your home on a pet can also transmit disease to you, the owner or caretaker of the pet. Sleeping in the same bed with dogs has been associated with plague in enzootic areas (2). Plague patients with no history of exposure to rodents can be infected by _Y. pestis_ if their pets carry infected rodent fleas into the home. Veterinarians always should recommend flea control to dog and cat owners.\n\nReferences\n----------\n1. CDC. Human plague -- four states, 2006.

Human infections are rare but can be life-threatening. The plague case-fatality rate depends on the clinical presentation (that is, bubonic, septicemic, or pneumonic) and timing of initiation of antibiotic therapy; if untreated, the case-fatality rate is over 50 per cent for bubonic plague and approaches 100 per cent for pneumonic plague. Rapid laboratory identification can help guide therapy.\n\nDomestic cats and dogs can also contract plague from infective fleas.

The Big Island remains one of the countries most affected by this disease in the world, the 2nd after the Congo Democratic Republic. With the current heat and rain, cases are increasing in this period. Several foci are being discovered around the capital, Antananarivo.\n\n10 patients have just been newly identified some 80 km from the capital. Other cases have been reported even closer. In total, since the beginning of 2012, the plague has already affected 250 people, 90 since early October 2012, with nearly one out of 5 patients dying. Dr. Celine Seignon-Kandissounon, representative of the WHO in Madagascar, reports an increase in the number of deaths: 'Compared to 2011, there are fewer cases, but these cases were more serious. It was noted that there are more deaths in 2012.'\n\nThe problem with the plague is that too often patients have consulted late, and since the beginning of the crisis 4 years ago, it has worsened. 'The vulnerability of the population has increased,' says Dr. Seignon, 'with the [worsening of the] socio-economic situation. Sometimes, accessibility to the health care centers is difficult, so delay in treatment can explain the increase in the number of deaths.'\n\nInformation campaigns and treatment are underway. The villages affected by the disease are quarantined to contain the outbreak, but it is certain that in Madagascar, plague will never be eradicated.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-FRA\n<promed-fra@promedmail.org>\n\n[There have been few cases but more deaths this year (2012) compared to last year.

In any case, this article is quite pessimistic.

In the port of Mahajanga, plague has been reintroduced, and epidemics occur every year. In Antananarivo, the capital, the number of new cases has increased, and many rodents are infected with _Yersinia pestis_. Despite surveillance for the sensitivity of _Y. pestis_ and fleas to drugs and insecticides and control measures to prevent the spread of sporadic cases, the elimination of plague has been difficult because the host and reservoir of the bacillus, _Rattus rattus_, is both a domestic and a sylvatic rat.\n\nIn the last 15 years [through 1998], Madagascar (population 13 million) has accounted for 45 percent of the cases of plague in Africa. - Mod.JW]\n\n[Fatalities related to plague usually are caused by spread of the organism from the bubo (the very painful infected lymph node which drains the area where the flea bite occurred) to the bloodstream. The bacteremia can cause a coagulopathy producing the purpura seen in the 'black plague' and also spread to the lung causing a hemorrhagic pneumonia. It is the pneumonia that can facilitate person-to-person transmission.\n\nMadagascar was the location of the isolation of multi-antimicrobial resistant _Y. pestis_ in 1995 (Galimand M, Guiyoule A, Gerbaud G, et al: Multidrug resistance in _Yersinia pestis_ mediated by a transferable plasmid. N Engl J Med 1997; 337(10): 677-80). The strain was resistant to chloramphenicol, streptomycin, and tetracycline but sensitive to fluoroquinolones and trimethoprim as well as other aminoglycosides.

Delayed treatment may explain this fact, but we must also consider other factors such as the virulence of the infecting strains, resistance to the antibiotics used, counterfeit drugs, and, therefore, under-dosage of those used in the treatment of the disease. The bacteremia can cause a coagulopathy producing the purpura seen in the 'black plague' and also spread to the lung causing a hemorrhagic pneumonia. \n\n--\n", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "plague"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2021-03-02 00:00:00", "1998-03-25 00:00:00", "1990-03-25 00:00:00", "2012-03-25 00:00:00", "2011-03-25 00:00:00", "1995-03-25 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Big Island", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Madagascar", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Yersinia", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "the Congo Democratic Republic", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Mahajanga", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Rasoamanana", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "1415379", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Plague - Madagascar: fatalities", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=1415379", "date": "2012-11-19 11:43:14", "main_text": "PLAGUE - MADAGASCAR: FATALITIES\n******************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Thu 15 Nov 2012\nSource: L'Express de Madagascar [in French, trans.

The Bongolava region has paid the highest price. 'Of the 43 cases identified, 2 people died of bubonic plague on [2 Oct 2012], 2 others died on 5 Nov 2012, and another person died on 9 Nov 2012 person,' the statistical management of health monitoring and epidemiological surveillance (DVSSE) within the Ministry of Public Health reported yesterday [14 Nov 2012].\n\nHowever, this epidemic does not affect this region alone. Another victim of the plague was also registered in the District of Mandoto in Vakinankaratra, on 9 Oct 2012. The same day, 3 other non-fatal cases were found in the district of Ambalavao in the Haute-Matsiatra region.\n\nThe cause of this deadly epidemic seems always the same. 'The plague victims sometimes live in remote areas and they self-medicate before going to a health center when the disease worsens. However, all health centers are equipped with rapid diagnostic test and medications to treat this disease immediately,' said Alain Marcel Rahetilahy, head of epidemic and neglected diseases within the Ministry of Health. In contrast, the Regional Director of Public Health for Tsiroanomandidy refused to disclose the circumstances of this deadly epidemic in its domain, without the written permission of the Secretary General of the Ministry of Health.\n\nHowever, Alain Marcel Rahetilahy does not want to dramatize the situation. 'These cases have yet to be confirmed by the Pasteur Institute of Madagascar. And every year, only 30-40 percent of reported cases are confirmed, even if the initial result is positive by a rapid diagnosis test. So the situation is it not very disturbing,' he reassured.\n\nYet other doctors remain cautious. 'The heat, the rain, and the bushfires that devastated several regions in recent months, forced the rats, propagation vectors of the plague, to flee to the villages. This is why people must remain vigilant,' warned a doctor who does not wish to reveal his name. And according to the Secretary General of the Ministry of Health, Philemon Tafangy, the number of suspected cases of plague is between 300 and 500 annually.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Plague is caused by the _Yersinia pestis_ bacillus, carried by rat fleas.

It also has been detected on the Buffalo Gap National Grasslands, in Badlands National Park, and on the Lower Brule Indian Reservation.\n\nThere have not been any confirmed cases of the plague in people in South Dakota.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[There are 2 parts to this comment: 1) comments regarding transmission to domestic animals and 2) issues regarding prairie dogs (_Cynomys_) and the black footed ferret (_Mustela nigripes_).\n\nPlague, caused by _Yersinia pestis_, is enzootic among rodents in the western USA. Humans can be infected through 1) the bite of an infected flea carried by a rodent or, rarely, other animals; 2) direct contact with contaminated tissues; or 3) in rare cases, inhalation of respiratory secretions from infected people or animals.\n\nPlague is a potential bioterrorism agent. Human infections are rare but can be life-threatening. The plague case-fatality rate depends on the clinical presentation (that is, bubonic, septicemic, or pneumonic) and timing of initiation of antibiotic therapy; if untreated, the case-fatality rate is over 50 per cent for bubonic plague and approaches 100 per cent for pneumonic plague (1). Rapid laboratory identification can help guide therapy.\n\nDomestic cats and dogs can also contract plague from infective fleas. They may carry infected fleas home to their owners or, especially cats, serve as a direct source of infection. There are many flea treatments and repellents appropriate for pets and available. Some products may be suitable for dogs but not cats, or may be suitable for an adult but not a younger animal. Be sure to consult your veterinarian, as some products may be toxic to cats, kittens, and puppies, even resulting in fatalities.\n\nClinical signs in pets involve a localized swelling, such as under the jaw in cats, but also in the inguinal region or under the front leg (the armpit if you will), lethargy, anorexia, and fever. Please take your pet to a veterinarian if you notice any abnormalities in your pet.\n\nVeterinarians should protect themselves by wearing gloves when examining these swellings. A bubo that ruptures may infect the veterinarian or even the pet owner if the pet owner is the one palpating the swelling.\n\nAnother form of the disease is the respiratory form. Cats may acquire this form and can spread it to their owners or the veterinarians through infected expiratory droplets. People are also prone to the respiratory infection.\n\nYou should also be aware that the fleas that hitchhike into your home via a pet vehicle can also transmit disease to you, the owner or caretaker of the pet. Sleeping in the same bed with dogs has been associated with plague in enzootic areas (2). Plague patients with no history of exposure to rodents can be infected by _Y. pestis_ if their pets carry infected rodent fleas into the home. Veterinarians always should recommend flea control to dog and cat owners.\n\nReferences\n----------\n1. CDC: Human plague -- four states, 2006.

It can afflict numerous species of mammals, including humans. Prairie dogs are highly susceptible to plague and are the primary food source of the highly endangered black-footed ferret, which is also susceptible to the disease. Sylvatic plague can decimate prairie dog colonies, with mortality rates of 90 percent or more, resulting in local extinctions and population reductions. Because of the susceptibility of prairie dogs to sylvatic plague, coupled with the potentially devastating effect the disease can have on black-footed ferrets, plague control is a vital concern for ferret recovery programs and conservation efforts.\n\nScientists at the USGS National Wildlife Health Center (NWHC), in collaboration with colleagues at the University of Wisconsin, state agencies, and other Federal agencies, have tested the feasibility of vaccinating black-footed ferrets and prairie dogs against sylvatic plague infections. The plague vaccine was developed for humans by the US Army Medical Research Institute for Infectious Disease and is being tested for use on animals at the USGS National Wildlife Health Center. Vaccination of ferrets by injection was shown to be highly successful both in the laboratory and in the field. However, injectable vaccines are not practical for field use in free-ranging animals, such as prairie dogs. Ultimately, management of the disease in ferrets will depend on managing the disease in prairie dogs.\n\nCurrently, efforts to halt the spread of plague rely on dusting individual prairie dog burrows with pesticides that kill plague-infected fleas, but pesticide application is labor intensive, costly and difficult to sustain over time.\n\nSylvatic plague vaccine (SPV)\n-----------------------------\nImmunizing entire populations of free-ranging prairie dogs and other rodents is highly challenging, but preliminary NWHC studies indicate prairie dogs can be successfully immunized by voluntarily eating vaccine-laden baits. These studies suggest that plague in prairie dogs could be managed through oral immunization, which would be especially useful in areas where black-footed ferrets reside and in populations of prairie dogs of conservation concern.\n\nThe Sylvatic Plague Vaccine Subcommittee of the Black-footed Ferret Recovery and Implementation Team is acting to coordinate efforts to complete development and delivery of SPV as a management tool to combat plague in grassland ecosystems. Currently, the NWHC is working with USDA's Center for Veterinary Biologics to register SPV for use in the field. Field safety trials with SPV are scheduled to begin in summer 2012 in Colorado. Field efficacy studies for free-ranging prairie dog populations are planned to begin in 2013.

I'm going to lose all my fingers on both hands. I don't know about my thumbs. The toes, I might lose all them, too.'\n\n'We didn't even know the plague was around anymore,' said his sister. 'We thought that was an ancient, ancient disease.'\n\nThe disease, which rampaged through Europe in the Middle Ages and is thought to have wiped out between 1/4th and 1/3rd of the population, is caused by the _Yersinia pestis_ bacterium. It can develop into 3 kinds of plague, including bubonic plague, which swells lymph nodes across the body. The other 2 are septicemic plague, which affects the bloodstream, and pneumonic plague, which affects the lungs.\n\nThe illness began after he saw a stray cat with a dead mouse jammed in the back of his throat. The cat appeared to be choking, so he and a friend attempted to dislodge the mouse. The distressed cat bit his hand. Unable to remove the mouse, the man shot the cat to end his suffering and buried him in the yard. Two days later, he awoke with a fever and chills.\n\nHe spent nearly a month on life support and only recently left the intensive care unit. At one point, doctors thought he was going to die, said his wife.\n\nThe cat's body was dug up, and tests confirmed it had the plague.

Health officials report the yet unnamed man is currently hospitalized in stable condition.\n\nAccording to a New Mexico Department of Health press release Thursday (31 May 2012) [http://www.health.state.nm.us/CommunicationsOffice/2012%20News%20Releases/NewsRelease-20120531-PlagueFirstCase-EN.pdf], they confirmed the man as having the plague, or _Yersinia pestis_ [infection]. NM Department of Health Cabinet Secretary, Dr Catherine Torres said, 'The Department of Health takes action when a plague case occurs to ensure the safety of the immediate family, neighbors, and health care providers. We inform neighbors door-to-door about plague found in the area and educate them on reducing their risk. We determine whether individuals close to the patient may also have been exposed to the plague and recommend preventative treatment when necessary.'\n\nPlague is an infectious disease caused by the bacterium _Yersinia pestis_. It is found in animals throughout the world, most commonly rats but other rodents like ground squirrels, prairie dogs, chipmunks, rabbits, and voles. Fleas typically serve as the vector of plague. Human cases have been linked to the domestic cats and dogs that brought infected fleas into the house.\n\nBubonic plague is the most common form of plague. In this form, the bacteria typically enter the body through the bite of an infected flea or rodent. Here the bacteria infect the lymphatic system. After a few days to a week, the person will experience fever, chills, weakness, and swollen lymph glands. These are called buboes.\n\nNM public health veterinarian, Dr Paul Ettestad says plague activity usually begins to increase in the spring and continues into the summer months. Now is the season and people need to take precautions to avoid rodents and their fleas which can expose them to plague. Ettestad says, 'Pets that are allowed to roam and hunt can bring infected fleas from dead rodents back into the home, putting you and your children at risk.'\n\nHealth authorities offer the following recommendations to prevent plague:\n- Avoid sick or dead rodents and rabbits, and their nests and burrows.\n- Keep your pets from roaming and hunting\n- Talk to your veterinarian about using an appropriate flea control product on your pets\n- Clean up areas near the house where rodents could live, such as woodpiles, brush piles, junk, and abandoned vehicles.\n- Sick pets should be examined promptly by a veterinarian.\n- See your doctor about any unexplained illness involving a sudden and severe fever.\n- Put hay, wood, and compost piles as far as possible from your home.\n- Don't leave your pet's food and water where mice can get to it.\n\n[Byline: Robert Herriman]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[New Mexico can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at http://healthmap.org/r/2uyq.

Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) with subsequent cutaneous hemorrhage may well have been what was called the 'Black Death' in the Middle Ages. The bacterium can spread to the lungs, causing a secondary plague pneumonia (secondary to the bacteremia), or to the meninges, causing a plague meningitis. Both of these events have a high case fatality rate and the secondary plague pneumonia is the way the infection spreads (by aerosol) from person to person.\n\n'The typical sign of the most common form of human plague is a swollen and very tender lymph gland, accompanied by pain. The swollen gland is called a 'bubo.' Bubonic plague should be suspected when a person develops a swollen gland, fever, chills, headache, and extreme exhaustion, and has a history of possible exposure to infected rodents, rabbits, or fleas.

The dog was most\nlikely infected when running in open fields on the north end of the\ncity and encountering sick or dead rabbits and other rodents, health\nofficials said.\n\n'A plague case in a pet serves as a warning that there is plague\nactivity in rabbits, rodents, and their fleas in the area,' said Dr\nCatherine Torres, the Department of Health's cabinet secretary. 'I\nencourage everyone to follow simple prevention recommendations to keep\nthemselves and their families and pets safe.'\n\nPlague, a bacterial disease of rodents, is generally transmitted to\nhumans through the bites of infected fleas, but can also be\ntransmitted by direct contact with infected animals, including\nrodents, rabbits and pets. 'Pets infected with plague are often\nhunters who have eaten an infected rodent or been bitten by a rodent's\nfleas prior to getting ill,' said Dr Paul Ettestad, public health\nveterinarian for the Department of Health. 'Pets can transport the\nfleas back into the home where they can infect people.'\n\nSymptoms of plague in humans include sudden onset of fever, chills,\nheadache, and weakness. In most cases there is a painful swelling of\nthe lymph node in the groin, armpit, or neck areas. Plague symptoms in\ncats and dogs are fever, lethargy, and loss of appetite. There may be\na swelling in the lymph node under the jaw. With prompt diagnosis and\nwith appropriate antibiotic treatment, the fatality rate in people and\npets can be greatly reduced.\n\nTo prevent plague, the Department of Health recommends the\nfollowing:\n- avoid sick or dead rodents and rabbits, and their nests and\nburrows;\n- keep your pets from roaming and hunting, and talk to your\nveterinarian about using an appropriate flea control product;\n- clean up areas near the house where rodents could live, such as\nwoodpiles, brush piles, junk, and abandoned vehicles;\n- sick pets should be examined promptly by a veterinarian;\n- see your doctor about any unexplained illness involving a sudden\nand severe fever;\n- put hay, wood, and compost piles as far as possible from your home;\n- don't leave your pet's food and water where mice can get to it.\n\nIn New Mexico, there have been 2 human cases so far in 2011, both\nfrom Santa Fe County; no human cases in 2010 and 6 human cases of\nplague in 2009: 3 from Santa Fe County, 2 from Bernalillo County and\none from Sandoval County.

Humans can be infected through 1) the bite of an infected\nflea carried by a rodent or, rarely, other animals; 2) direct contact\nwith contaminated tissues; or 3) in rare cases, inhalation of\nrespiratory secretions from infected people or animals.\n\nPlague is a category A potential bioterrorism agent. Human infections\nare rare but can be life-threatening. The plague case-fatality rate\ndepends on the clinical presentation (that is, bubonic, septicemic, or\npneumonic) and timing of antibiotic therapy initiation; if untreated,\nthe case-fatality rate is over 50 per cent for bubonic plague and\napproaches 100 per cent for pneumonic plague (1). Rapid laboratory\nidentification can help guide therapy.\n\nDomestic cats and dogs can also contract plague from infective fleas.\nThey may carry infected fleas home to their owners or, especially\ncats, serve as a direct source of infection. There are many flea\ntreatments and repellents appropriate for pets and available. Some\nproducts may be suitable for dogs but not cats or may be suitable for\nan adult but not a younger animal. Be sure to consult your\nveterinarian, as some products may be toxic to cats, kittens, and\npuppies, even resulting in fatalities.\n\nClinical signs in pets involve a localized swelling, such as under\nthe jaw in cats, but also in the inguinal region or under the front\nleg (the armpit if you will), lethargy, anorexia, and fever. Please\ntake your pet to a veterinarian if you notice any abnormalities in\nyour pet.\n\nVeterinarians should protect themselves by wearing gloves when\nexamining these swellings. A bubo that ruptures may infect the\nveterinarian or even the pet owner if the pet owner is the one\npalpating the swelling.\n\nAnother form of the disease is the respiratory form. Cats may acquire\nthis form and can spread it to their owners or the veterinarians\nthrough infected expiratory droplets. People are also prone to the\nrespiratory infection as well.\n\nYou should also be aware that the fleas that hitchhike into your home\nvia a pet vehicle can also transmit disease to you, the owner or\ncaretaker of the pet. Sleeping in the same bed with dogs has been\nassociated with plague in enzootic areas (2). Plague patients with no\nhistory of exposure to rodents can be infected by _Y. pestis_ if their\npets carry infected rodent fleas into the home. Veterinarians always\nshould recommend flea control to dog and cat owners.\n\nReferences\n----------\n1. CDC. Human plague -- four states, 2006.

But\n2 confirmed cases of rabies in bats rolled in this week to take its\nplace.\n\nOn 3 Jun 2011, Boulder County Public Health (BCPH) announced that a\ndomestic cat and a dead squirrel tested positive for plague. The cat\nlived in the 2500 block of 6th Street, and the squirrel was found at\n8th Street and Maxwell Avenue. Health officials posted signs around\nthe neighborhood advising residents of the danger and listing\nprecautionary measures to take.\n\nJoe Malinowski, manager of the BCPH Environmental Health Division,\nsaid this week that a 2nd dead squirrel tested positive for plague,\nbut the cat was successfully treated for the disease. There have been\nno other confirmed cases, he said, adding that he knows of no humans\nwho have reported contracting symptoms of the plague, which include\nhigh fever, extreme fatigue and painful, swollen lymph nodes. His\noffice has, however, received a few calls from area residents\nreporting additional dead squirrels. But Malinowski said officials\nwon't test another squirrel unless 2 or more are found in the same\nlocation.\n\nThe same area got hit with a similar plague infestation in 2005, he\nsaid, but usually the disease targets prairie dogs, not squirrels.\nMalinowski added that the plague typically runs its course within a\nfew days. 'It goes through the population pretty quickly,' he said.\nUsually, prairie dogs return to the empty burrows of a colony that has\nbeen wiped out, and the squirrel population on Mapleton Hill is\nexpected to bounce back as well, he explained.\n\nThis is the 1st confirmed case of plague identified this season\n[2011], but Malinowski said it is common to have outbreaks each year.\n\nResidents were advised to keep cats indoors, since they seem to be\nmore susceptible to plague than dogs.\n\nOfficials suggest protecting pets with flea powder and keeping them\non a leash and out of wild rodent habitats. People entering wild\nrodent habitats should wear insect repellent and tuck their pants into\nsocks to prevent flea bites. Long-handed shovels should be used to\nremove dead rodents, and they should be sealed in garbage bags and\nplaced in garbage cans.

Contacts with the individual have been notified and are receiving preventive antibiotics, officials said. The man reported contact with a sick stray cat in his neighborhood, they added.\n\nCrook County officials did not identify the man, citing patient confidentiality regulations, but a family member contacted NewsChannel 21, which then learned he's in critical condition at St. Charles Medical Center-Bend. A family member told us he's been only given 30 percent survival odds at present.\n\nThe man was bitten by the cat last week and within 48 hours was taken to a Portland hospital for treatment. He was then moved to Bend, where he is now fighting for his life. Friends say his organs started shutting as they wait to see if antibiotics can get rid of the illness.\n\nPlague is spread to humans or animals through a bite from an infected flea or by contact with an animal sick with the disease. 'People can protect themselves, their family members and their pets,' said Karen Yeargain, communicable disease coordinator with the Crook County Health Department. 'Using flea treatment on your pets will prevent your pets from bringing fleas into your home. Plague is serious but it is treatable with antibiotics if caught early.'\n\nA domestic cat in Crook County tested positive for bubonic plague a year ago. 'For people, it's the cats bringing home the fleas to a household or being in contact with a cat or dog who is actually sick with the plague,' Yeargain told NewsChannel 21. 'Almost exactly a year ago, we did have a cat diagnosed with the plague,' said Yeargain, 'that cat also had septicemic, or bloodstream infection, and that cat did pull through.'\n\nPlague is rare in Oregon. Only 3 human cases have been diagnosed statewide since Crook County's last case of plague in 1995. According to Yeargain, the last Crook County case occurred in a resident who was exposed to plague-infected fleas from household cats that hunted rodents in the fields. 2 of 3 cats in that household also tested positive for plague exposure. In 2010, 2 human cases of plague were diagnosed in Lake County. Further investigation revealed that the family dog had also been exposed to plague. In 2011, an additional case with exposures in Lake County was diagnosed. There were no fatalities in humans or household animals in these cases.\n\nSymptoms of plague typically develop within 1 to 4 days after exposure. 3 clinical syndromes have been described; bubonic (lymph node infection), septicemic (blood infection), and pneumonic (lung infection). Bubonic plague is the most common form and is characterized by high temperatures, lethargy and swollen lymph nodes, most commonly in the neck and under the jaw. Infected lymph nodes may spontaneously abscess and drain.\n\nCollin Gillin, DVM, Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife, reminds people that if anyone observes sick or dead rodents of any kind, to contact the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife veterinarians. Some additional steps to prevent flea bites are to wear insect repellant, tuck pant cuffs into socks when in areas heavily occupied by rodents, and avoid contact with wildlife including rodents. Pet owners are encouraged to keep cats indoors. Also, do not handle ill-appearing stray or wild animals.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Most cases of _Yersinia pestis_ infections in the USA are reported from the Four Corners area of the USA where the states of Colorado, Utah, Arizona and New Mexico come together although as mentioned in the posting, cases occur in Oregon as well as California.\n\nAs outlined by the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) at http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvbid/plague/diagnosis.htm: 'Death from bubonic plague occurs after the bacterium _Yersinia pestis_ escapes from the infected bubo into the bloodstream (septicemic plague) causing the manifestations of the sepsis syndrome. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) with subsequent cutaneous hemorrhage may well have been what was called the 'Black Death' in the Middle Ages. The bacterium can spread to the lungs, causing a secondary plague pneumonia (secondary to the bacteremia), or to the meninges, causing a plague meningitis. Both of these events have a high case fatality rate and the secondary plague pneumonia is the way the infection spreads (by aerosol) from person to person.\n\n'The typical sign of the most common form of human plague is a swollen and very tender lymph gland, accompanied by pain. The swollen gland is called a 'bubo.' Bubonic plague should be suspected when a person develops a swollen gland, fever, chills, headache, and extreme exhaustion, and has a history of possible exposure to infected rodents, rabbits, or fleas. A person usually becomes ill with bubonic plague 2 to 6 days after being infected.\n\n'When bubonic plague is left untreated, plague bacteria invade the bloodstream. As the plague bacteria multiply in the bloodstream, they spread rapidly throughout the body and cause a severe and often fatal condition. Infection of the lungs with the plague bacterium causes the pneumonic form of plague, a severe respiratory illness. The infected person may experience high fever, chills, cough, and breathing difficulty and may expel bloody sputum. If plague patients are not given specific antibiotic therapy, the disease can progress rapidly to death. About 14 per cent (1 in 7) of all plague cases in the United States are fatal.'\n\nThe severity of the illness in this man suggests that septicemic plague is occurring here.

Emilio\nDeBess, Oregon's public health veterinarian, said the 6-year-old cat,\nnamed Meow, was brought into a veterinarian in Prineville at the end\nof May with an abscessed lymph node on its neck and an elevated fever.\nThe vet, worried about the symptoms, alerted DeBess and sent a sample\nof the cat's lymph node to the Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory at\nOregon State University. Sure enough, Meow had the plague, a disease\nthat has infected wild animals such as squirrels and rats in New\nMexico, Arizona, California and Colorado but is rarely seen in Oregon\nor Washington. The only recent case of a wild animal in Oregon\ninvolved mule deer in Grant County in 2005.\n\nThe plague is carried by fleas, which often infect mice and rats but\ncan bite people and pets as well. DeBess said that since 1995, only 3\npeople in Oregon have been infected. 2 of those cases -- a mother and\ndaughter in Lakeview -- got sick last year [2010]. Their dog was\ninfected as well but the husband was not sick.\n\nStill, those 2 cases grabbed DeBess' attention. 'That's a change from\nwhat we've seen in the past,' he said. 'We're keeping an eye on what's\ngoing on.'\n\nThe other case involved a woman in Bend in 1995 and her 2 cats. All 3\npeople recovered. So did the cats and the dog and Meow is also on his\nway to a full recovery. Meow's owners did not get sick, DeBess said.\n\nEarly detection of the infection and treatment with antibiotics is\ncritical. Untreated, the plague can be fatal. Cats are especially\nsusceptible, DeBess said. Although dogs can become infected, they're\nwhat's known as sentinel animals in that they don't show any symptoms.\nPlague symptoms usually appear one to 4 days after exposure and\ninclude fever, chills, headache, swollen lymph nodes, abdominal pain\nand pneumonia.\n\nDeBess said this latest case should not cause panic but push people\ntowards prevention. 'This is a reminder to use flea treatment and to\nwatch for illnesses that we might not normally think of,' he said.\nCheck with your vet on the best flea treatments for your pets. People\ncan guard against flea bites with insect repellent. Additional\nmeasures may be necessary in areas rife with rodents, including\ntucking pant cuffs into socks. Obviously, avoid contact with mice and\nrats.

Humans can be infected through 1) the bite of an infected\nflea carried by a rodent or, rarely, other animals, 2) direct contact\nwith contaminated tissues, or 3) in rare cases, inhalation of\nrespiratory secretions from infected people or animals.\n\nPlague is a category A potential bioterrorism agent. Human infections\nare rare but can be life-threatening. The plague case-fatality rate\ndepends on the clinical presentation (that is, bubonic, septicemic, or\npneumonic) and timing of antibiotic therapy initiation; if untreated,\nthe case-fatality rate is over 50 per cent for bubonic plague and\napproaches 100 per cent for pneumonic plague (1). Rapid laboratory\nidentification can help guide therapy.\n\nDomestic cats and dogs can also contract plague from infective fleas.\nThey may carry infected fleas home to their owners or, especially\ncats, serve as a direct source of infection. There are many flea\ntreatments and repellents appropriate for pets and available. Some\nproducts may be suitable for dogs but not cats or may be suitable for\nan adult but not a younger animal. Be sure to consult your\nveterinarian, as some products may be toxic to cats, kittens, and\npuppies, even resulting in fatalities.\n\nClinical signs in pets involve a localized swelling, such as under\nthe jaw in cats, but also in the inguinal region or under the front\nleg (the armpit if you will), lethargy, anorexia, and fever. Please\ntake your pet to a veterinarian if you notice any abnormalities in\nyour pet.\n\nVeterinarians should protect themselves by wearing gloves when\nexamining these swellings. A bubo that ruptures may infect the\nveterinarian or even the pet owner if the pet owner is the one\npalpating the swelling.\n\nAnother form of the disease is the respiratory form. Cats may acquire\nthis form and can spread it to their owners or the veterinarians\nthrough infected expiratory droplets. People are also prone to the\nrespiratory infection as well.\n\nYou should also be aware that the fleas that hitchhike into your home\nvia a pet vehicle can also transmit disease to you, the owner or\ncaretaker of the pet. Sleeping in the same bed with dogs has been\nassociated with plague in enzootic areas (2). Plague patients with no\nhistory of exposure to rodents can be infected by _Y. pestis_ if their\npets carry infected rodent fleas into the home.

In the absence of pneumonia spread from\nthe local node, person-to-person transmission in bubonic plague does\nnot occur.\n\nTobruk or Tubruq is a town, seaport, and peninsula in northeastern\nLibya, near the border with Egypt, in North Africa. It is the capital\nof Al Butnan District (formerly Tobruk District). Its location can be\nfound on a map at: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobruk. The last\ncluster of _Yersinia pestis_ infection occurred in 2009 in the same\narea of northeastern Libya. The following contains a description of\nprevious outbreaks in the Saharan Africa area.\n\nConsumption of the meat of an infected camel has been reported to\ncause plague in Libya in 1976 (1). The abstract of the paper is: 'In\n1976, in a small, remote Libyan village, an apparently sick camel was\nslaughtered and skinned, and the camel meat was distributed for human\nconsumption. A few days later, 15 villagers suffered a severe febrile\nillness. Of the 5 individuals who had participated in the killing and\ndispensation of the camel, all were dead within 4 days. When samples\nof serum from 9 of the remaining patients were examined, 7 were found\nto be positive for plague as determined by the passive\nhemagglutination test. Another 6 persons became ill after killing 2\ngoats, and the serum of one goat contained antibodies to _Yersinia\npestis_. Because all of the remaining patients except one were treated\nearly enough, they recovered. These incidents confirm previous reports\nthat the camel and the goat are susceptible to naturally occurring\nplague infection and have a significant role in the dissemination of\nhuman plague.'\n\nTwo more recent outbreaks in the Arab world have been reported in\n2005. In Saudi Arabia (2), a cluster of 5 plague cases were reported\nincluding 4 with severe pharyngitis and submandibular lymphadenitis.\nThese 4 case-patients had eaten raw camel liver. _Yersinia pestis_ was\nisolated from bone marrow of the camel and from jirds [rodents]\n(_Meriones libycus_) and fleas (_Xenopsylla cheopis_) captured at the\ncamel corral. In Jordon (3), a 1997 outbreak of plague was reported\nassociated with cervical lymphadenopathy and fever that occurred in\nthe Jordanian village of Azraq ad-Druze, 50 km [31 miles] west of the\nborder with Saudi Arabia. The 12 cases who presented at hospital were\ninitially assumed to have tularaemia, and all were successfully\ntreated with gentamicin. But all 12 were found to have anti-_Y.\npestis_ IgM. 11 of the 12 patients reported that, 2-4 days before\ntheir symptoms appeared, they had eaten the meat cut from the carcass\nof the same camel, either raw (10 cases) or cooked (one case). All 12\npatients were diagnosed as cases of pharyngeal plague (the 1st cases\nof plague reported in Jordan for more than 80 years) caused by _Y.\npestis_ that most had acquired when they ate raw meat from a camel\nthat was infected with the pathogen.\n\nThe source of the cases of bubonic plague in northeastern Libya is\nnot reported in this posting but may be related to camels and camel\nfleas.

Humans can be infected through 1) the bite of an infected\nflea carried by a rodent or, rarely, other animals, 2) direct contact\nwith contaminated tissues, or 3) in rare cases, inhalation of\nrespiratory secretions from infected persons or animals. In September\n2010, the Oregon Health Authority reported the 1st 2 cases of human\nplague in Oregon since 1995 and the only 2 USA cases in 2010.\n\nBoth illnesses began on 21 Aug 2010. The patients, aged 17 and 42\nyears, lived in the same household and might have been exposed to\nplague by infected fleas from a dog; that dog was found to be\nseropositive for _Y. pestis_ by the passive\nhemagglutination-inhibition assay (dilution of 1:64). One patient\nacknowledged sleeping in the same bed with the dog during the 2 weeks\nbefore illness onset. Both patients had high fever and multiple\nbilateral inguinal buboes; one patient had hypotension, tachycardia,\nand acute renal failure and was hospitalized. A gram-negative rod with\nbipolar staining was isolated from a specimen of that patient's\nblood.\n\nFour different clinical laboratories attempted to identify the\nisolate. Three different commercial automated systems identified the\norganism as _Acinetobacter lwoffii_, _Pseudomonas luteola_, and\n_Yersinia pseudotuberculosis_, respectively. However, 25 days after\nspecimen collection, the isolate was identified as _Y. pestis_ by\ndirect fluorescent antibody to F1 antigen, polymerase chain reaction,\nand bacteriophage lysis at the Spokane (Washington) Regional Health\nDistrict Laboratory, prompting notification of the Oregon Health\nAuthority. The 2nd patient was identified retrospectively on the basis\nof a single positive serology (passive hemagglutination-inhibition\n[dilution of 1:32]). Plague was not suspected initially. Both patients\nrecovered uneventfully after empiric therapy with doxycycline and\namoxicillin clavulanate potassium, respectively, although the latter\nis not considered effective in treating plague.\n\nAutomated bacterial identification systems can misidentify _Y.\npestis_ (1,2). Automated identification of _Yersinia_ spp. in blood\nshould prompt further clinical evaluation of the patient to determine\nwhether symptoms are compatible with plague. When plague is suspected,\ntreatment should be started immediately, and both the state public\nhealth laboratory and public health authorities should be notified\npromptly.\n\nPlague is a Category A potential bioterrorism agent. Human infections\nare rare but can be life-threatening. The plague case-fatality rate\ndepends on the clinical presentation (i.e., bubonic, septicemic, or\npneumonic) and timing of antibiotic therapy initiation; if untreated,\nthe case-fatality rate is over 50 percent for bubonic plague and\napproaches 100 percent for pneumonic plague (3). Rapid laboratory\nidentification can help guide therapy.\n\nSleeping in the same bed with dogs has been associated with plague in\nenzootic areas (4). Plague patients with no history of exposure to\nrodents can be infected by _Y. pestis_ if their pets carry infected\nrodent fleas into the home. Veterinarians always should recommend flea\ncontrol to dog and cat owners.\n\nReferences\n--------\n1.

The patient, a researcher in a university laboratory,\nhad been working along with other members of the laboratory group with\na pigmentation-negative (pgm-) attenuated _Y. pestis_ strain (KIM\nD27). The strain had not been known to have caused laboratory-acquired\ninfections or human fatalities. Other researchers in a separate\nuniversity laboratory facility in the same building had contact with a\nvirulent _Y. pestis_ strain (CO92) that is considered a select\nbiologic agent; however, the pgm- attenuated KIM D27 is excluded from\nthe National Select Agent Registry (1). The university, CDPH, the\nIllinois Department of Public Health (IDPH), and CDC conducted an\ninvestigation to ascertain the cause of death.\n\nThis report summarizes the results of that investigation, which\ndetermined that the cause of death likely was an unrecognized\noccupational exposure (route unknown) to _Y. pestis_, leading to\nseptic shock. _Y. pestis_ was isolated from premortem blood cultures.\nPolymerase chain reaction (PCR) identified the clinical isolate as a\npgm- strain of _Y. pestis_. Postmortem examination revealed no\nevidence of pneumonic plague. A postmortem diagnosis of hereditary\nhemochromatosis was made on the basis of histopathologic, laboratory,\nand genetic testing. One possible explanation for the unexpected fatal\noutcome in this patient is that hemochromatosis-induced iron overload\nmight have provided the infecting KIM D27 strain, which is attenuated\nas a result of defects in its ability to acquire iron, with sufficient\niron to overcome its iron-acquisition defects and become virulent (2).\nResearchers should adhere to recommended biosafety practices when\nhandling any live bacterial cultures, even attenuated strains, and\ninstitutional biosafety committees should implement and maintain\neffective surveillance systems to detect and monitor unexpected acute\nillness in laboratory workers.\n\nCase report\n-----------\nOn 10 Sep 2009, the researcher, a man aged 60 years with\ninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, was evaluated at an outpatient\nclinic for fever, body aches, and cough of approximately 3 days\nduration. A clinic physician suspected influenza or other acute\nrespiratory infection and referred the patient to an emergency\ndepartment (ED) for further evaluation; however, the patient did not\nseek further care at that time. On 13 Sep 2011, the patient was\nbrought by ambulance to a Chicago hospital ED because of fever, cough,\nand worsening shortness of breath. Paramedics recorded an oxygen\nsaturation level of 92 percent, and oxygen was administered via mask.\n\nUpon arrival at the ED, the patient was noted to be alert and able to\nconverse, with a temperature of 100.9 deg F (38.3 deg C), pulse of 106\nbeats per minute, respiratory rate of 42 breaths per minute, and blood\npressure of 106/75 mm/Hg. Examination revealed distant breath sounds,\nabdominal distention, peripheral cyanosis, and trace pedal edema; no\nlymphadenopathy, rash, or jaundice was noted. A chest radiograph\nrevealed normal lung fields; however, the patient continued to have\nlabored breathing and required supplemental oxygen. Blood chemistries\nshowed renal failure (creatinine: 6.5 mg/dL; blood urea nitrogen: 73\nmg/dL), incipient acidosis (bicarbonate: 17 mEq/L; PaCO2: 31mmHg; pH:\n7.36), and elevated liver function enzymes (aspartate\naminotransaminase: 794 IU/L; alanine aminotransaminase: 160 IU/L).\nComplete blood count showed severe leukocytosis (white blood cells: 79\n200/mL) with a left shift (22 percent band forms) and hemoglobin level\nand platelet count within normal limits. Extracellular bacteria were\nnoted on a peripheral blood smear.\n\nThe patient initially was treated with diuretics for suspected\ncongestive heart failure and later with intravenous antibiotics\n(vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam) once infection was suspected.\nAt approximately 12 hours after presentation, the patient had\nworsening respiratory distress and was intubated. He died 1 hour later\nof cardiac arrest, despite resuscitation attempts.\n\nThe patient had last worked in the laboratory on 4 Sep 2009. On 10\nSep 2009, he notified his supervisor about his illness to explain his\nabsence from work. Whether the patient himself suspected his symptoms\nwere consistent with plague is not known; however, existing laboratory\npolicy called for laboratory workers with illness consistent with\nplague to report to the university's occupational health clinic (or to\nthe ED). The patient's occupation was not documented in the records of\neither the outpatient clinic he visited or the hospital ED.\n\nOn 14 Sep 2009, blood cultures drawn the previous day yielded\ngram-negative bacilli (4 of 4 bottles), gram-positive cocci (3 of 4\nbottles), and yeast (1 of 4 bottles and presumed to be a contaminant).\nOn 15 Sep 2009, the clinical laboratory identified the gram-positive\ncocci as nutritionally variant streptococci (NVS). An autopsy\nperformed the same day identified no signs of pneumonia, bowel\nperforation, or endocarditis, which is often associated with NVS\ninfection. Efforts to identify the slow-growing, gram-negative\norganism were under way when, on 16 Sep 2009, an ED physician learned\nthat the patient had worked in a laboratory that conducted research on\nselect biologic agents and notified the hospital clinical laboratory.\nOn the morning of 18 Sep 2009, 16S ribosomal DNA sequencing performed\nby the hospital clinical laboratory narrowed the identity of the\ngram-negative bacilli to either _Y. pestis_ or _Y.\npseudotuberculosis_. That same day, hospital infection control staff\nmembers notified CDPH of the suspected _Y. pestis_ case.\n\nEpidemiologic and environmental investigation\n---------------------------------------------\nOn 18 Sep 2009, CDPH, IDPH, CDC, and the university initiated a joint\ninvestigation to determine the source of _Y. pestis_ infection,\nidentify any potential additional infections, and implement prevention\nand control measures. Because inhalation exposure could not be\nexcluded, antimicrobial prophylaxis was offered to all staff members\nat the research laboratory in which the patient worked and to his\nclose contacts. A close contact was defined as a person who had been\nwithin 6 feet [2 m] of the patient or who had handled his blood or\ntissue samples during 7-18 Sep 2009. Unless contraindications existed,\na 7-day course of doxycycline was prescribed for prophylaxis. All 30\ncoworkers were prescribed prophylaxis during 19-20 Sep 2009. 1\nhousehold contact and 64 other close contacts, including medical,\nlaboratory, and pathology personnel, were identified, and 61 (94\npercent) accepted prophylaxis during 18-20 Sep 2009. No additional _Y.\npestis_ infections have been identified.\n\nAn assessment of the laboratory environment identified no major\ndeficiencies in laboratory engineering controls. A review of\nOccupational Safety and Health Administration Form 300 logs identified\nno recent work-related injuries or illnesses among workers in this\nlaboratory. A review of attendance records for university biosafety\ntraining identified deficiencies in staff attendance (including the\npatient) at a number of required biosafety courses. The patient's\nfamily members and coworkers were asked about knowledge of any\npossible exposure events, such as a needle puncture or splash of\nliquid to the face, and none were reported. Interviews with laboratory\ncoworkers revealed that the patient inconsistently complied with the\nlaboratory policy to wear gloves while handling _Y. pestis_ KIM D27\nbacterial cultures.\n\nLaboratory and pathologic testing\n----------------------------------\nPreliminary PCR and microbiologic analyses conducted by the\nuniversity research laboratory identified the organism isolated from\nthe patient as a pgm- attenuated strain of _Y. pestis_ (3), consistent\nwith the KIM D27 strain with which the patient worked, and not the\nvirulent _Y. pestis_ strain CO92, which was used in a separate\nlaboratory facility on another floor. The IDPH Division of\nLaboratories confirmed the infecting organism as _Y. pestis_. CDC\nindependently isolated _Y. pestis_ from an aliquot of 1 of the\noriginal blood culture bottles and confirmed the absence of the pgm\nlocus. CDC also identified a chloramphenicol resistance gene (a\ncommon, laboratory-based resistance marker) that was not in the\noriginal laboratory stock strain, suggesting that the infecting strain\nhad been modified as part of routine laboratory research.\n\nTo determine whether new virulence mechanisms had been acquired or\ngenetically inserted into the infecting strain, CDC compared the\nvirulence of the infecting strain with that of CO92 from CDC culture\narchives and the original, attenuated KIM D27 stock strain from the\npatient's laboratory. Male Swiss Webster mice were inoculated\nsubcutaneously with varying doses of bacteria ranging from 3 to 8 logs\nof colony-forming units (CFUs) for the infecting strain and the\nparental KIM D27 strain, and from 2 to 3 logs for CO92. Virulence was\nmeasured by determining the median lethal dose (LD). The LD of CO92\nwas equal to or less than 100 CFUs. In contrast, an LD was not\nachieved for either the infecting strain or KIM D27; less than 3% of\nthe mice died after injection with doses as high as 8 logs of CFUs.\nSuch findings suggest that the strain with which the patient was\ninfected was attenuated and that no new virulence mechanisms were\nacquired by or engineered into the infecting strain.\n\nHistopathologic examination of the patient's lung tissue at CDC\nrevealed preserved alveolar structure without inflammatory infiltrates\nthat would have indicated pneumonic processes consistent with plague\n[for figures, see original URL - Mod.LL]). Immunohistochemical tests\nusing an anti-_Y. pestis_ mouse monoclonal antibody revealed abundant\nstaining of _Y. pestis_ in blood vessels of multiple organs,\nconsistent with septicemic plague. Histologic staining revealed\nabnormal iron deposits in the liver, but not in pancreatic or cardiac\ntissues. Postmortem testing of blood samples revealed a total serum\niron of 541 microg/dL (reference range: 40-160 microg/dL), iron\nsaturation of 83.5 percent (reference range: 14-50 percent), and total\niron binding capacity of 648 microg/dL (reference range: 230-430\nmicrog/dL). Genetic testing revealed that the patient was homozygous\nfor the C282Y mutation of the HFE gene, confirming a postmortem\ndiagnosis of hereditary hemochromatosis (4). Investigators found no\nevidence that the researcher knew he had hemochromatosis or that he\nexhibited any symptoms of this condition.\n\n[Reported by: Ritger K, Black S, Weaver K, et al]\n\nEditorial note\n--------------\nThis report describes the 1st known fatality from a\nlaboratory-acquired infection with attenuated _Y. pestis_. The last\nknown laboratory-acquired infection with _Y. pestis_ in the USA\noccurred in 1959 and was caused by inhalation of a virulent strain\n(5). Pathology findings for the case described in this report are\nconsistent with septicemic plague and inconsistent with pneumonic\nplague, suggesting a transdermal or mucosal route of infection.\nHowever, a recent study (6) demonstrated that intranasal infection of\nmice with KIM D27 can result in persistent colonization of the lung\nvasculature, subsequent dissemination of infection, and eventual death\nwithout classic pathologic signs of pneumonic plague. Consequently, a\nrespiratory route of infection cannot be ruled out definitively.\nAlthough the route of transmission for the infection remains unclear,\ndeficiencies in biosafety practices, including inconsistent use of\ngloves, could have resulted in inadvertent transdermal exposure.

The\nsevere outcome experienced by the patient was unexpected, given that\nhe had worked with an attenuated _Y. pestis_ strain that 1) is widely\nused by laboratory researchers, 2) has not been associated with\nprevious laboratory-acquired infections or fatalities, and 3) is\nexcluded from select biologic agent requirements (1). A ProMED-mail post\n<http://www.promedmail.org>\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\n<http://www.isid.org>\n\nDate: Thu 24 Feb 2011\n One possible explanation for the unexpected fatal\noutcome in this patient is that hemochromatosis-induced iron overload\nmight have provided the infecting KIM D27 strain, which is attenuated\nas a result of defects in its ability to acquire iron, with sufficient\niron to overcome its iron-acquisition defects and become virulent (2). To determine whether new virulence mechanisms had been acquired or\ngenetically inserted into the infecting strain, CDC compared the\nvirulence of the infecting strain with that of CO92 from CDC culture\narchives and the original, attenuated KIM D27 stock strain from the\npatient's laboratory. Whether the patient himself suspected his symptoms\nwere consistent with plague is not known; however, existing laboratory\npolicy called for laboratory workers with illness consistent with\nplague to report to the university's occupational health clinic (or to\nthe ED). Other researchers in a separate\nuniversity laboratory facility in the same building had contact with a\nvirulent _Y. pestis_ strain (CO92) that is considered a select\nbiologic agent; however, the pgm- attenuated KIM D27 is excluded from\nthe National Select Agent Registry (1). Postmortem testing of blood samples revealed a total serum\niron of 541 microg/dL (reference range: 40-160 microg/dL), iron\nsaturation of 83.5 percent (reference range: 14-50 percent), and total\niron binding capacity of 648 microg/dL (reference range: 230-430\nmicrog/dL). Researchers working with\nattenuated _Y. pestis_ and other potentially infectious material\nshould always use at least biosafety level 2 practices (10), and\nlaboratory managers should ensure that staff adheres to recommended\nbiosafety practices. Although NVS\nbacteremia cannot be excluded as a contributing factor in the\npatient's death, the clinical course, lack of endocarditis, and the\nvisualization of _Y. pestis_ in blood vessels throughout the body\nstrongly support gram-negative sepsis as the cause of death. Researchers should adhere to recommended biosafety practices when\nhandling any live bacterial cultures, even attenuated strains, and\ninstitutional biosafety committees should implement and maintain\neffective surveillance systems to detect and monitor unexpected acute\nillness in laboratory workers. Institutional safety committees should implement\nand maintain effective surveillance programs to identify and monitor\nacute illness among laboratory workers, and health-care providers\nshould routinely inquire about occupational exposures when evaluating\npatients. Blood chemistries\nshowed renal failure (creatinine: 6.5 mg/dL; blood urea nitrogen: 73\nmg/dL), incipient acidosis (bicarbonate: 17 mEq/L; PaCO2: 31mmHg; pH:\n7.36), and elevated liver function enzymes (aspartate\naminotransaminase: 794 IU/L; alanine aminotransaminase: 160 IU/L). CDC also identified a chloramphenicol resistance gene (a\ncommon, laboratory-based resistance marker) that was not in the\noriginal laboratory stock strain, suggesting that the infecting strain\nhad been modified as part of routine laboratory research. The patient, a researcher in a university laboratory,\nhad been working along with other members of the laboratory group with\na pigmentation-negative (pgm-) attenuated _Y. pestis_ strain (KIM\nD27). Efforts to identify the slow-growing, gram-negative\norganism were under way when, on 16 Sep 2009, an ED physician learned\nthat the patient had worked in a laboratory that conducted research on\nselect biologic agents and notified the hospital clinical laboratory. MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep 2011; 60(07): 201-5 [edited]\n<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6007a1.htm?s_cid=mm6007a1_w>\n\n\nFatal laboratory-acquired infection with an attenuated _Yersinia\npestis_ strain -- Chicago, Illinois, 2009\n On 18 Sep 2009, the Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH) was\nnotified by a local hospital of a suspected case of fatal\nlaboratory-acquired infection with _Yersinia pestis_, the causative\nagent of plague. Interviews with laboratory\ncoworkers revealed that the patient inconsistently complied with the\nlaboratory policy to wear gloves while handling _Y. pestis_ KIM D27\nbacterial cultures. The last\nknown laboratory-acquired infection with _Y. pestis_ in the USA\noccurred in 1959 and was caused by inhalation of a virulent strain\n(5). On the morning of 18 Sep 2009, 16S ribosomal DNA sequencing performed\nby the hospital clinical laboratory narrowed the identity of the\ngram-negative bacilli to either _Y. pestis_ or _Y.\npseudotuberculosis_. Conceivably, hemochromatosis-induced iron\noverload might have a similar effect, enhancing the virulence of the\ninfecting KIM D27 strain by compensating for its iron-acquisition\ndefects (2). Male Swiss Webster mice were inoculated\nsubcutaneously with varying doses of bacteria ranging from 3 to 8 logs\nof colony-forming units (CFUs) for the infecting strain and the\nparental KIM D27 strain, and from 2 to 3 logs for CO92. 1\nhousehold contact and 64 other close contacts, including medical,\nlaboratory, and pathology personnel, were identified, and 61 (94\npercent) accepted prophylaxis during 18-20 Sep 2009. A clinic physician suspected influenza or other acute\nrespiratory infection and referred the patient to an emergency\ndepartment (ED) for further evaluation; however, the patient did not\nseek further care at that time. On 18 Sep 2009, CDPH, IDPH, CDC, and the university initiated a joint\ninvestigation to determine the source of _Y. pestis_ infection,\nidentify any potential additional infections, and implement prevention\nand control measures. Because inhalation exposure could not be\nexcluded, antimicrobial prophylaxis was offered to all staff members\nat the research laboratory in which the patient worked and to his\nclose contacts. \n\nHistopathologic examination of the patient's lung tissue at CDC\nrevealed preserved alveolar structure without inflammatory infiltrates\nthat would have indicated pneumonic processes consistent with plague\n \n\nThis report summarizes the results of that investigation, which\ndetermined that the cause of death likely was an unrecognized\noccupational exposure (route unknown) to _Y. pestis_, leading to\nseptic shock. However, a recent study (6) demonstrated that intranasal infection of\nmice with KIM D27 can result in persistent colonization of the lung\nvasculature, subsequent dissemination of infection, and eventual death\nwithout classic pathologic signs of pneumonic plague. Pathology findings for the case described in this report are\nconsistent with septicemic plague and inconsistent with pneumonic\nplague, suggesting a transdermal or mucosal route of infection.\n Upon arrival at the ED, the patient was noted to be alert and able to\nconverse, with a temperature of 100.9 deg F (38.3 deg C), pulse of 106\nbeats per minute, respiratory rate of 42 breaths per minute, and blood\npressure of 106/75 mm/Hg. CDC\nindependently isolated _Y. pestis_ from an aliquot of 1 of the\noriginal blood culture bottles and confirmed the absence of the pgm\nlocus. On 10 Sep 2009, the researcher, a man aged 60 years with\ninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, was evaluated at an outpatient\nclinic for fever, body aches, and cough of approximately 3 days\nduration. The patient's\nfamily members and coworkers were asked about knowledge of any\npossible exposure events, such as a needle puncture or splash of\nliquid to the face, and none were reported. An autopsy\nperformed the same day identified no signs of pneumonia, bowel\nperforation, or endocarditis, which is often associated with NVS\ninfection. On 14 Sep 2009, blood cultures drawn the previous day yielded\ngram-negative bacilli (4 of 4 bottles), gram-positive cocci (3 of 4\nbottles), and yeast (1 of 4 bottles and presumed to be a contaminant). Such findings suggest that the strain with which the patient was\ninfected was attenuated and that no new virulence mechanisms were\nacquired by or engineered into the infecting strain. Although iron deposition in pancreatic tissue is known to\ncause bronze diabetes, pathologic examination ruled out iron\ndeposition as the cause of this patient's diabetes. \n\nHemochromatosis, an iron-overload disease (7), is characterized by\nincreased iron absorption and progressive iron storage in multiple\norgans. A close contact was defined as a person who had been\nwithin 6 feet [2 m] of the patient or who had handled his blood or\ntissue samples during 7-18 Sep 2009. Research using animal models of hemochromatosis (9) is under way to\nbetter understand susceptibility to infection with bacteria attenuated\nas a result of defects in iron acquisition. A review of attendance records for university biosafety\ntraining identified deficiencies in staff attendance (including the\npatient) at a number of required biosafety courses. Animal studies have shown that the virulence of pgm- _Y. pestis_\nstrains can be enhanced by the simultaneous injection of iron into\nexperimental animals (2). Genetic testing revealed that the patient was homozygous\nfor the C282Y mutation of the HFE gene, confirming a postmortem\ndiagnosis of hereditary hemochromatosis (4). \n\nThe patient initially was treated with diuretics for suspected\ncongestive heart failure and later with intravenous antibiotics\n Lee-Lewis H, Anderson DM: Absence of inflammation and pneumonia\nduring infection with nonpigmented _Yersinia pestis_ reveals a new\nrole for the pgm locus in pathogenesis. In contrast, an LD was not\nachieved for either the infecting strain or KIM D27; less than 3% of\nthe mice died after injection with doses as high as 8 logs of CFUs. A postmortem diagnosis of hereditary\nhemochromatosis was made on the basis of histopathologic, laboratory,\nand genetic testing. Although the route of transmission for the infection remains unclear,\ndeficiencies in biosafety practices, including inconsistent use of\ngloves, could have resulted in inadvertent transdermal exposure.", "reports": [{"diseases": ["unknown", "other", "plague", "tuberculosis"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["1956-03-25 00:00:00", "1997-03-25 00:00:00", "2009-09-10 00:00:00", "2021-03-25 00:00:16", "2009-09-16 00:00:00", "2009-09-15 00:00:00", "1959-03-25 00:00:00", "1999-03-25 00:00:00", "1906-12-25 00:00:00", "2010-03-25 00:00:00", "2009-09-04 00:00:00", "2007-09-18 20:09:00", "2009-03-25 00:00:00", "2011-02-24 00:00:00", "2009-09-14 00:00:00", "2009-09-18 00:00:00", "2011-09-13 00:00:00", "2011-02-18 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Black S", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "DC", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Atlanta", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Illinois", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Chicago", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Yersinia", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "pH", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Washington", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "623557", "headline": "PRO/AH> Plague, pneumonic, 2009 - China: (QH) follow up", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=623557", "date": "2011-01-09 14:00:04", "main_text": "PLAGUE, PNEUMONIC, 2009 - CHINA: (QINGHAI), FOLLOW UP\n***********************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\n<http://www.promedmail.org>\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\n<http://www.isid.org>\n\nDate: Thu 6 Jan 2011\nFrom: Jack Woodall <woodall@promedmail.org>\n\n\nThe report from China of this unusual outbreak has just been\npublished: Hu Wang et al: A Dog-Associated Primary Pneumonic Plague\nin Qinghai Province, China.

Experts warn\nthe species could become extinct from the UK within the next 30 years; it\nis currently a protected species.\n\nToday, white-clawed crayfish have been upgraded from 'vulnerable' to\n'endangered' on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN)\nRed List of Threatened Species, following a Sampled Red List Index (SRLI)\nassessment by the Zoological Society of London (ZSL). The ranking gives an\nindication of how likely a species is to become extinct.\n\nEve Leegwater, technical biodiversity officer at the Environment Agency,\nsaid: 'It is important to base conservation efforts on scientific research,\nand the IUCN Red List has become an increasingly important tool to guide\ngovernment and scientific institutes towards the conservation and\nlegislation of species and habitats at risk of extinction.' She added: 'The\nchange in status of white-clawed crayfish will help stress the need for\nconservation strategies to be implemented to aid this valuable species.'\n\nUp to 70 per cent of white-clawed crayfish have been lost from the south\nwest, and some parts of the UK have lost their entire populations. This is\npredominantly due to the crayfish plague, a fungus-like disease which is\nharmless to people and most animals but lethal to white-clawed crayfish.\nThe crayfish plague is spread by the invasive American signal crayfish, a\nnon-native species which is taking over UK waterways and wiping out our\nsmaller native species.\n\nThe South West Crayfish Project is currently running the largest strategic\ntranslocation in the UK to date, re-homing at-risk populations of\nwhite-clawed crayfish to new safe sites. In addition, a breeding programme\nfor the crayfish is being developed at Bristol Zoo Gardens, the sister\norganisation to the Bristol Conservation and Science Foundation (BCSF).\n\nMaddy Rees, UK conservation officer for the Bristol Conservation and\nScience Foundation, said: 'The plague can be carried on anything that gets\nwet in infected water, so we are urging people to wash, dry and, if\npossible, disinfect footwear, fishing tackle, nets and other equipment that\ngets damp in our rivers and lakes. Never trap for any species of crayfish\nwithout a trapping licence, as it is illegal, and finally, never move wild\nfish between waterways; always use a reputable stockist.'\n\nThe survival of white-clawed crayfish will be the focus of a conference\nheld at Bristol Zoo Gardens later this year [2010]. The event, called\n'Species survival: Securing white-clawed crayfish in a changing\nenvironment' will take place on 16 and 17 Nov 2010. It will include a range\nof lectures from speakers from across Europe and presentations from experts\nin the field of UK crayfish conservation.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The aetiological agent of crayfish plague is _Aphanomyces astaci_, a\nmember of a group of organisms commonly known as the water moulds. Although\nlong regarded to be fungi, this group, the Oomycetida, are now considered\nprotists and are classified with diatoms and brown algae in a group called\nthe Stramenopiles or Chromista.\n\nThere is evidence that established older _A. astaci_ strains that have been\npresent in Europe for many years are less aggressive than newer strains\nintroduced with crayfish imports from North America since the 1960s. Some\nisolates from warmer waters in Spain have temperature/growth curves with\nhigher optimum temperatures compared with those from northern Europe.\n\nAlthough _A. astaci_ is not an obligate parasite and will grow well under\nlaboratory conditions on artificial media, in the natural environment it\ndoes not survive well for long periods in the absence of a suitable host.\nIt has been shown that _A. astaci_ cysts survive for 2 weeks in distilled\nwater, and that zoospores remained motile for up to 3 days. As _A. astaci_\ncan go through 3 cycles of zoospore emergence, the maximum life span\noutside of a host could be several weeks.\n\n_A. astaci_, both in culture and in infected crayfish, is killed by a short\nexposure to temperatures of 60 C (140 F) or to temperatures of -20 C (-4 F)\nor less for 48 hours or more. Sodium hypochlorite and iodophores are\neffective for disinfection of contaminated equipment. Thorough drying of\nequipment (more than 24 hours) is also effective, as _Aphanomyces_ is not\nresistant to desiccation.\n\nThere is good field and experimental evidence that movements of fish from\nareas in which crayfish plague is active can transmit infection from one\nwatershed to another. _A. astaci_ can also be spread by contaminated\nequipment (nets, boots, clothing, etc).\n\nThe information above is derived from chapter 2.3.7.

As _A. astaci_\ncan go through 3 cycles of zoospore emergence, the maximum life span\noutside of a host could be several weeks.\n\n_A. astaci_, both in culture and in infected crayfish, is killed by a short\nexposure to temperatures of 60 deg C (140 deg F) or to temperatures of -20\ndeg C (-4 deg F) or less for 48 hours or more. Sodium hypochlorite and\niodophores are effective for disinfection of contaminated equipment.\nThorough drying of equipment (more than 24 hours) is also effective, as\n_Aphanomyces_ is not resistant to desiccation.\n\nThere is good field and experimental evidence that movements of fish from\nareas in which crayfish plague is active can transmit infection from one\nwatershed to another. _A. astaci_ can also be spread by contaminated\nequipment (nets, boots, clothing, etc).\n\nThe information above is derived from chapter 2.3.7.

No human cases detected so far\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nPlumas County Environmental Health reports that a rodent found in the\nPlumas Eureka State Park area has tested positive for plague. This\nreport is the 1st sign of plague activity in Plumas County in many years.\n\nPlumas County Environmental Health is working with the State\nVector-Borne Disease program and will be monitoring this situation.\nPlague warnings will be posted in the Plumas Eureka State Park Area\nand surrounding campgrounds. Additional surveillance activities will\nalso begin in these areas.\n\nPlague is a highly infectious bacterial disease which primarily\naffects rodents. Humans and their pets (dogs, and especially cats)\ncan get plague if they visit areas where wild rodents are infected.\n\n'At the present time, there have been no cases of human plague in\nPlumas County. However, it is vital that the disease be diagnosed and\ntreated in its early stages,' states Dr Valeska Armisen, health\nofficer for Plumas County.\n\nIn humans, the initial symptoms of plague include fever, chills,\nmuscle aches, a feeling of weakness and, commonly, swollen and tender\nlymph nodes. The usual incubation period is 2 to 6 days, but contact\na physician immediately if you become ill within 7 days of being in a\nplague-affected area. Plague is curable when diagnosed early. You can\nhelp with diagnosis by telling your doctor where you have been and\nthat you may have been exposed to plague.\n\nPeople can get the disease from animals in several ways. The most\nimportant route of transmission is through bites of fleas from\ninfected rodents, but direct contact with sick or dead animals should\nalso be avoided.\n\nThe most important wild rodents that can carry plague are squirrels\n(especially ground squirrels), chipmunks, wood rats, mice, and\nmarmots. Plague is lethal to many rodents. Therefore, a sick or dead\nrodent is a possible warning that plague may be in the area.\n\nIt is important to note that while it is not uncommon to find plague\nin wild animals in Plumas County, no human cases have been confirmed\nin several years. Nonetheless, Plumas County residents and guests are\nurged to take the following general precautions to help prevent the\nspread of plague:\n- avoid all contact with rodents and their fleas. Do not touch sick\nor dead rodents, but report them to campground hosts or park rangers\n- do not camp, sleep or rest near animal burrows\n- do not feed rodents in campgrounds and picnic areas. Store food and\nrefuse in rodent-proof containers\n- wearing long pants tucked into boot tops can reduce your exposure\nto fleas. Insect repellent sprayed on socks and trouser cuffs also may help\n- leave pets at home if possible. If not, keep pet confined or on a\nleash. Do not allow pet to approach sick or dead rodents or to\nexplore rodent burrows\n- if you have any questions, visit the state Department of Public\nHealth website at\n<http://www.cdph.ca.gov/HealthInfo/discond/Pages/Plague.aspx>.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[For more information of plague, readers are directed to the\nModerator's comments in ProMED-mail post 20100817.2849 - Mod.TG]\n\n[The state of California can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail\ninteractive map at\n<http://healthmap.org/r/037r>.\nPlumas County can be located on the map at\n<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plumas_County,_California>. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ]", "summary": "A ProMED-mail post\n<http://www.promedmail.org>\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\n<http://www.isid.org>\n\nDate: Sat 14 Aug 2010\n Do not allow pet to approach sick or dead rodents or to\nexplore rodent burrows\n- if you have any questions, visit the state Department of Public\nHealth website at\n<http://www.cdph.ca.gov/HealthInfo/discond/Pages/Plague.aspx>.

Military sources have completely rejected\nthe possibility of outside intervention that could be causing the\nepidemic.\n\nSyria is currently facing the worst drought in 40 years. Hundreds of\nthousands of people are experiencing food shortages; peasants have\nbeen decimated, and many people are fleeing the country. Already,\nnearly 60 000 small livestock owners have lost all their animals, and\n50 000 others have lost 50-60 percent of their cattle.\n\nIf the early symptoms of plague have occurred in the military (the\nSyrian army has 215 000 men, plus 300 000 reservists), it is probable\nthat the soldiers will spread the disease, especially with the\napproach of Ramadan [11 Aug-9 Sep 2010] when a great number of\nsoldiers return to their villages.\n\nThe last plague epidemic in Europe was in 1910.\n\n[Byline: Ftouh Souhail]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Plague is a bacterial infection of humans and other animals, caused\nby the Gram-negative bacillus _Yersinia pestis_. Three major plague\npandemics have been recorded in human history: the 1st in the 6th\ncentury; the 2nd in the 14th century, which killed up to 1/3rd of the\nEuropean population; and the 3rd at the end of the 19th century\nfollowed the spread of infection from China. Sporadic cases and\nlimited outbreaks of plague continue occur currently in various\ncountries throughout the world. However, during the winter of 1910 to\n1911, an explosive epidemic of primary pneumonic plague raged in\nManchuria and northern China and killed more than 50 000 people\n[Levison ME. Lessons learned from history on mode of transmission for\ncontrol of pneumonic plague. Curr Infect Dis Reports. 2000; 2 (4):\n269-271].\n\nIn the United States, the last urban plague epidemic occurred in Los\nAngeles in 1924-25. Since then, human plague in the United States has\noccurred as mostly scattered cases in rural areas (an average of 10 to\n15 persons each year); more than 90 percent of human plague occurs in\nthe Southwest, especially New Mexico, Arizona, California, and\nColorado. Plague bacillus has also been listed among possible\nbioterrorism agents.\n\nWild rodents in certain areas around the world are infected with the\nplague bacillus. The organism is transmitted among these animals by\nthe bite of infected fleas. Plague may spill over from wild rodents\ninto the peridomestic rodent populations and their fleas, which bring\nplague into human contact. The usual mode of transmission for bubonic\nplague is the bite of an infected rat flea. Direct contacts with\ntissue or bodily fluids of an infected animal or inhaling infectious\nairborne droplets of respiratory secretions are other modes of\ntransmission.\n\nOutbreaks of plague are most likely to occur when rats live closely\nwith humans, usually in poverty-stricken areas with poor sanitation,\nand when humans share habitat with wild rodents infected with plague\nbacteria.\n\nPlague occurs mainly in 3 clinical forms: Bubonic plague, with\nenlarged, tender lymph nodes (buboes), fever, chills and prostration;\nsepticemic plague, with fever, chills, prostration, shock and bleeding\ninto skin and other organs; and pneumonic plague, with fever, chills,\ncough, and difficulty breathing. Septicemic plague may occur with or\nwithout bubonic plague. Pneumonic plague may either be due to a\nsecondary spread through the bloodstream of advanced bubonic plague\n(secondary pneumonic plague), or due to inhalation of aerosolized\ninfectious droplets (primary pneumonic plague). Pharyngeal plague and\nplague meningitis are less common forms. Rapid diagnosis and treatment\nis essential to reduce complications and fatality.\n\nAs noted by ProMED moderator JW, plague has occurred in this region\nhistorically\n(<http://entomology.montana.edu/historybug/napoleon/plague_syria.htm>).\nHowever, the news release above fails to detail microbiologic\nconfirmation, clinical manifestations and epidemiology of this current\noutbreak among the Syrian military.

They say the virus is transmitted to humans through the\nfleas on rodents, rabbits, and pets.\n\nThis is the 3rd case this year [2010] involving animals in New\nMexico. In all cases, the animals have recovered.\n\nFor more information on the plague go to\n<http://www.health.state.nm.us/erd/HealthData/plague.shtml>\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The causative bacterium, _Yersinia pestis_, is transmitted to people\nthrough fleabite and direct contact with infected animals. Each\nrodent species is host to one or more species of flea, which, when\ninfected, is a carrier. These fleas generally do not infest other\nanimals unless their natural hosts are unavailable.\n\nDomestic cats and dogs can also contract plague from infected fleas.\nThey may carry infected fleas home to their owners or, especially in\nthe case of cats, serve as a direct source of infection.\n\nAlthough prairie dogs are more sensitive indicators of plague than\ncats, these are quite sensitive. Often, plague lesions in cats,\nparticularly domestic cats, may initially be confused with a cat\nfight (or cat bite) abscess, as there are often swellings in the\nmandibular region. Plague swellings are buboes, abscesses from\ninfection. Consequently, veterinarians, technicians, animal shelter\nworkers and animal caretakers may become victims when buboes rupture.\n\nPlague, caused by _Y. pestis_, is an acute and sometimes fatal\nbacterial zoonosis that is transmitted primarily by the fleas of rats\nand other rodents. Enzootic foci of sylvatic plague exist in the\nwestern USA and throughout the world, including Eurasia, Africa, and\nNorth and South America. In addition to rodents, other mammalian\nspecies that have been naturally infected with _Y. pestis_ include\nlagomorphs, felids, canids, mustelids, and some ungulates. Domestic\ncats and dogs have also developed plague from oral mucous membrane\nexposure to infected rodent tissues, typically when they are allowed\nto roam and hunt in enzootic areas. Birds and other non-mammalian\nvertebrates appear to be resistant to plague. On average, 10 human\nplague cases are reported each year in the USA; the majority are from\nNew Mexico, California, Colorado, and Arizona. Most human cases\nresult from the bite of an infected flea, although direct contact\nwith infected wild rabbits, rodents, and occasionally other wildlife\nand exposure to infected domestic cats are also risk factors.\n\n_Y. pestis_ is a gram-negative, nonmotile, coccobacillus belonging to\nthe Enterobacteriaceae family. It exhibits a bipolar staining,\n'safety pin' appearance when stained with Wright, Giemsa, or Wayson\nstains. _Y. pestis_ grows slowly even at optimal temperatures (28 deg\nC [82.4 deg F]) and can require greater than 48 hours to produce\ncolonies. Several types of media can be used to grow _Y. pestis_,\nincluding blood agar, nutrient broth, and un-enriched agar. Colonies\nare small (1-2 mm), gray, non-mucoid, and have a characteristic\n'hammered copper' appearance. Different virulence factors are\nexpressed by the organism at different temperatures and environments,\nallowing the organism to survive in flea vectors and then be\ntransmitted to and multiply in mammalian hosts. The organism does not\nsurvive for long at high temperatures or in dry environments.\n\n_Y. pestis_ is easily destroyed by sunlight and drying. Even so, when\nreleased into the air, the bacteria will survive for up to one hour,\nalthough this could vary depending on conditions.\n\nPneumonic plague is one of several forms of plague. Depending on\ncircumstances, these forms may occur separately or in combination.\nPneumonic plague occurs when _Y. pestis_ infects the lungs. This type\nof plague can spread from person to person through the air.\nTransmission can take place if someone breathes in aerosolized\nbacteria, which could happen in a bioterrorist attack. Pneumonic\nplague is also spread by breathing in _Y. pestis_ suspended in\nrespiratory droplets from a person (or animal) with pneumonic plague.\nBecoming infected in this way usually requires direct and close\ncontact with the ill person or animal. Pneumonic plague may also\noccur if a person with bubonic or septicemic plague is untreated and\nthe bacteria spread to the lungs.\n\nBubonic plague is the most common form of plague. This occurs when an\ninfected flea bites a person or when materials contaminated with _Y.\npestis_ enter through a break in a person's skin. Patients develop\nswollen, tender lymph glands (called buboes) and fever, headache,\nchills, and weakness. Bubonic plague does not spread from person to\nperson.\n\nSepticemic plague occurs when plague bacteria multiply in the blood.\nIt can be a complication of pneumonic or bubonic plague or it can\noccur by itself. When it occurs alone, it is caused in the same ways\nas bubonic plague; however, buboes do not develop. Patients have\nfever, chills, prostration, abdominal pain, shock, and bleeding into\nskin and other organs. Septicemic plague does not spread from person\nto person.\n\nWith pneumonic plague, the 1st signs of illness are fever, headache,\nweakness, and rapidly developing pneumonia with shortness of breath,\nchest pain, cough, and sometimes bloody or watery sputum. The\npneumonia progresses for 2 to 4 days and may cause respiratory\nfailure and shock. Without early treatment, patients may die.\n\nEarly treatment of pneumonic plague is essential. To reduce the\nchance of death, antibiotics must be given within 24 hours of 1st\nsymptoms. Streptomycin, gentamicin, the tetracyclines, and\nchloramphenicol are all effective against pneumonic plague.\n\nAntibiotic treatment for 7 days will protect people who have had\ndirect, close contact with infected patients.

A test\non another cat in the same household is pending. The Vector Control\nSection of the California Department of Health Services and the Kern\nCounty Environmental Health, which is now part of Public Health, are\ncollaborating to investigate these cases.\n\nThere is no evidence of human infection at this time, Kim Rodriguez\nwith the KCDPH said. Appropriate preventive steps including\nantibiotics have been recommended to protect those who may have been\nexposed to these cats. One of the symptomatic cats is responding well\nto antibiotics, but one of the cats has died, Rodriguez said.\n\n'(The) plague is still very much present in our county, although we\nmay want to believe that it is an obsolete disease of the past,' says\nMatt Constantine, Director of Public Health. 'The most effective\nweapons in fighting this disease are public awareness, education, and\npreventative measures to reduce the risk for exposure.'\n\nPlague, infection with the bacterium _Y. pestis_, is endemic\nthroughout the southwest United States, including much of Kern County.\nEach year numerous mammals, including domestic cats, are identified\nwith evidence of infection with _Y. pestis_, Rodriguez said. Cats are\nbelieved to be the domestic species most susceptible to plague.\n\nAs in humans, 3 clinical syndromes have been described: bubonic,\nsepticemic, and pneumonic. Bubonic is the most common manifestation\nand is characterized by high fever (105-106 degrees F), lethargy, and\nswollen lymph glands, most commonly of the glands of the neck and\nunder the jaw in cats but in the inguinal area in humans. Infected\nlymph nodes may spontaneously abscess and drain, Rodriguez said.\n\nCats can pose a risk of plague transmission to humans. Because of the\npotential for transmission to humans, cats suspected of having plague\nshould be hospitalized and placed in isolation. Persons having\nsignificant contact with a plague-infected cat, particularly cats with\nrespiratory signs or draining abscesses, should consult with their\nhealth care provider regarding the need for a prophylactic course of\nantibiotics. Local and state public health officials should be\nnotified immediately of cases of plague diagnosed in domestic cats,\nRodriguez said.\n\nPlague is known to be related to fluctuations in rodent population at\nelevations greater than 2500 feet. Residents and visitors in these\nregions are advised to take the following precautions:\n\n-- Do not feed or handle wild animals, particularly ground squirrels\nand chipmunks\n-- Eliminate trash near living areas, which attract and can harbor rodents.\n-- Report any animals acting strangely (i.e., sluggishly) to Kern\nCounty Environmental Health.\n-- Do not touch sick or dead animals. Report their location to Kern\nCounty Environmental Health.\n-- If odors or flies are noticed around rodent burrows, report this to\nKern County Environmental Health.\n-- Do not camp or sit near rodent burrows, where infected animals may\nlive. When possible, sleep off the ground, such as on cots.\n-- Domestic animals visiting plague-suspected areas should be observed\nfor 7 days. If they become ill, they should be examined by a\nveterinarian.\n-- Use insect repellent in plague-endemic areas.\n-- Wear protective clothing including long-sleeved shirts and long\npants with cuffs tucked into the socks.\n-- Use flea-repellent products on your pets regularly; ie: collars,\nbath, ointments, and powders, especially after returning from a\nwilderness area.\n-- If pets appear sick after returning from a wilderness area, handle\nthem carefully and take them to a veterinarian immediately.\n-- See a physician if within 7 days of a visit to an endemic area you\nbecome ill with fever, chills, muscle aches, nausea, sore throat,\nheadaches, physical exhaustion and/or painful swollen lymph nodes as\nthe initial symptoms may be nonspecific.\n\nIt is prudent for all residents and visitors in known endemic areas of\nthe county adhere to measures that would minimize their exposure to\npotentially infected animals.

The Vector Control\nSection of the California Department of Health Services and the Kern\nCounty Environmental Health, which is now part of Public Health, are\ncollaborating to investigate these cases. Pneumonic\nplague is also spread by breathing in _Y. pestis_ suspended in\nrespiratory droplets from a person (or animal) with pneumonic plague. Pneumonic plague may also occur\nif a person with bubonic or septicemic plague is untreated and the\nbacteria spread to the lungs. Often, plague lesions in cats, particularly domestic cats, may\ninitially be confused with a cat fight (or cat bite) abscess, as there\nare often swellings in the mandibular region. Clinton, WA 98236\n<anmlpepl@whidbey.com>\n\nThe causative bacterium, _Yersinia pestis_, is transmitted to people\nthrough fleabite and direct contact with infected animals. Local and state public health officials should be\nnotified immediately of cases of plague diagnosed in domestic cats,\nRodriguez said. \n\n'(The) plague is still very much present in our county, although we\nmay want to believe that it is an obsolete disease of the past,' says\nMatt Constantine, Director of Public Health. ' The Kern County Department of Public Health has confirmed a test\nresult positive for _Yersenia pestis_, the bacterium that causes\nplague, conducted on a domestic cat from Hart Flat, California. \n\nIt is prudent for all residents and visitors in known endemic areas of\nthe county adhere to measures that would minimize their exposure to\npotentially infected animals. With pneumonic plague, the 1st signs of illness are fever, headache,\nweakness, and rapidly developing pneumonia with shortness of breath,\nchest pain, cough, and sometimes bloody or watery sputum. Plague, caused by _Yersinia pestis_, is an acute and sometimes fatal\nbacterial zoonosis that is transmitted primarily by the fleas of rats\nand other rodents. Because of the\npotential for transmission to humans, cats suspected of having plague\nshould be hospitalized and placed in isolation. This occurs when an\ninfected flea bites a person or when materials contaminated with _Y.\npestis_ enter through a break in a person's skin. Most human cases result\nfrom the bite of an infected flea, although direct contact with\ninfected wild rabbits, rodents, and occasion! On average, 10 human\nplague cases are reported each year in the USA; the majority are from\nNew Mexico, California, Colorado, and Arizona. Enzootic foci of sylvatic plague exist in the\nwestern USA and throughout the world, including Eurasia, Africa, and\nNorth and South America. \nally other wildlife and exposure to infected domestic cats are also\nrisk factors. Prairie dogs [which are\nactually ground squirrels] are more sensitive than cats, but\nnevertheless, cats are quite sensitive. In addition to rodents, other mammalian\nspecies that have been naturally infected with _Y. pestis_ include\nlagomorphs, felids, canids, mustelids, and some ungulates. -- Use flea-repellent products on your pets regularly; ie: collars,\nbath, ointments, and powders, especially after returning from a\nwilderness area. Each rodent\nspecies is host to one or more species of flea, which, when infected,\nis a carrier. _Y. pestis_ grows slowly even at optimal temperatures (28 deg\nC [82.4 deg F]) and can require greater than 48 hours to produce\ncolonies. Appropriate preventive steps including\nantibiotics have been recommended to protect those who may have been\nexposed to these cats. Patients develop\nswollen, tender lymph glands (called buboes) and fever, headache,\nchills, and weakness. The most effective\nweapons in fighting this disease are public awareness, education, and\npreventative measures to reduce the risk for exposure.' Patients have\nfever, chills, prostration, abdominal pain, shock, and bleeding into\nskin and other organs. Consequently, veterinarians,\ntechnicians, animal shelter workers and animal caretakers may become\nvictims when buboes rupture. The\npneumonia progresses for 2 to 4 days and may cause respiratory failure\nand shock. Even so, when\nreleased into the air, the bacteria will survive for up to one hour,\nalthough this could vary depending on conditions.", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "plague"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2009-03-25 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "California", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "USA", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "the United States", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Colorado", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "New Mexico", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Eurasia", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "North and South America", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "United States", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Yersinia", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Kern County", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Yersenia", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Arizona", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "CALIFORNIA", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "262465", "headline": "PRO/AH> Plague, pneumonic - China (05): (QH) Comment", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=262465", "date": "2009-08-07 21:00:06", "main_text": "PLAGUE, PNEUMONIC - CHINA (05): (QINGHAI) COMMENT\n*************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\n<http://www.promedmail.org>\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\n<http://www.isid.org>\n\nDate: Thu 6 Aug 2009\nFrom: Wendy Orent\n<orentw@bellsouth.net>\n\n\nI've been following this plague in China business with the greatest\ninterest. No one has pointed out in ProMed that all the research done\nby ex-Soviet scientists on marmot plague indicates that it has a\npneumotropism (though I do not know if anyone has demonstrated it on\na molecular level.)\n\nThere were 3 huge outbreaks of pneumonic plague in the 20th Century:\n60 000 dead in 1910, 16 000 in 1916 in Shanxi, China, in 1915-16, and\n10 000 in 1920, with Wu Lien-teh literally sitting right on top of it\n(he treated the index case) but the thing exploded anyway, because\npeople fled. Of the 3 outbreaks there were 3 survivors, acording to\nWu. I was surprised that this time the index case got the plague from\na dog, but I knew marmots had to be involved somehow. They are the\nonly creatures besides humans who can pass pneumonic plague from one\nto another under normal (not laboratory) circumstances. Of course\nthey live in big colonies and they just keep passing it around; the\ngerm survives in their burrows either inside protozoa or in a biofilm\nso it's impossible to eradicate, as the Soviets found when they tried\nkilling off the marmots.\n\nIt is such a shame the people keep fleeing, as the disease can be\ntreated now. I hope we don't have a major outbreak, since that's\nexactly what happened in 1920 at the very least; people just escaped\nfrom quarantine and spread the disease all over Manchuria via the\nrailroad tracks. I think a lot of the common wisdom about\ntransmissibility doesn't apply to marmot plague -- the disease really\ncan't be compared to what we see in this country, where it almost\nnever goes pneumonic except if someone skins a coyote or gets it from\ntheir pet cat (and then, since 1924, it has never spread.) Prairie\ndog plague seems to lack the pneumotropism; prairie dogs spread it\nthrough their fleas, according to prairie dog expert John Hoogland.\nBut no one ever saw a flea on any human being during the Manchurian\nplagues, and those scientists looked! Rats also were never involved.\nAfter the 1st person was infected by exposure to a marmot, it was all\nspread via direct contagion. So it's hard to believe that rats and\nfleas were involved this time, and I wonder why the government is\napparently killing them.\n\n--\nWendy Orent\nAtlanta, Georgia\n<orentw@bellsouth.net>", "summary": "A ProMED-mail post\n<http://www.promedmail.org>\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\n<http://www.isid.org>\n\nDate: Thu 6 Aug 2009\n I think a lot of the common wisdom about\ntransmissibility doesn't apply to marmot plague -- the disease really\ncan't be compared to what we see in this country, where it almost\nnever goes pneumonic except if someone skins a coyote or gets it from\ntheir pet cat (and then, since 1924, it has never spread.) \n\nThere were 3 huge outbreaks of pneumonic plague in the 20th Century:\n60 000 dead in 1910, 16 000 in 1916 in Shanxi, China, in 1915-16, and\n10 000 in 1920, with Wu Lien-teh literally sitting right on top of it\n Prairie\ndog plague seems to lack the pneumotropism; prairie dogs spread it\nthrough their fleas, according to prairie dog expert John Hoogland.\n No one has pointed out in ProMed that all the research done\nby ex-Soviet scientists on marmot plague indicates that it has a\npneumotropism (though I do not know if anyone has demonstrated it on\na molecular level.)

The most common clinical form is bubonic\nplague, which is characterized by high fever and regional\nlymphadenitis. Without treatment, infection can spread from lymph\nnodes [through the bloodstream - Mod.LL] to the lungs, resulting in\npneumonic plague and the potential for person-to-person transmission\nthrough respiratory droplets (1,2).\n\nIn November 2006, the Uganda Ministry of Health received reports of\nan increase in bubonic plague cases and a possible outbreak of\npneumonic plague among residents in the Arua and Nebbi districts. In\nresponse, the Uganda Ministry of Health and CDC conducted a joint\ninvestigation in the 2 districts during 28 Nov 2006-30 Dec 2006. The\nresults of this investigation underscore the need to 1) continue\nefforts to educate residents of rural Uganda regarding the source,\nsigns, and symptoms of plague and the life-saving importance of\nseeking treatment; 2) strengthen plague surveillance and diagnostic\ncapabilities; and 3) improve emergency response and vector-control\ncapacity, especially in remote regions of the country.\n\nIn rural Uganda, where laboratory capacity is limited, clinicians\ngenerally rely on clinical criteria for the diagnosis of plague.\nThese criteria, as established by the Uganda Ministry of Health, are\nas follows: sudden onset of fever, chills, malaise, headache, or\nprostration accompanied by either painful regional lymphadenitis\n(bubonic plague) or cough with hemoptysis (pneumonic plague). For\nthis investigation, a plague case was defined as clinically diagnosed\nplague with onset during 1 Jul 2006-30 Dec 2006, in a resident of\nArua or Nebbi districts. Beginning 28 Nov 2006, cases were\nascertained through retrospective review of patient logs in 8 clinics\nand 2 hospitals that historically have accounted for 85 percent of\nreported plague cases in the region (Uganda Virus Research Institute,\nunpublished data, 1999-2005).\n\nInformation was collected on patient age, sex, village of residence,\nclinical presentation, and outcome. In addition, clinicians at these\nfacilities and all other health clinics in Arua and Nebbi districts\nwere asked to report immediately by cellular telephone or messenger\nany new cases identified. When possible, diagnostic samples (that is,\nserum and bubo aspirates) were collected from patients with acute or\nrecent illness diagnosed as plague. Laboratory-confirmed plague was\ndefined as isolation of _Y. pestis_ or a 4-fold change in antibody\ntiter to F1 antigen between paired acute and convalescent serum\nsamples with a least one sample having a titer equal to or grater\nthan 1:16.\n\nA total of 127 plague cases with onset dates during 19 Jul 2006-30\nDec 2006 (Figure 1 [for figures and tables, see original URL -\nMod.LL]), were identified in Arua and Nebbi districts in northwestern\nUganda (Figure 2). Among the 102 patients with documented symptoms,\n90 (88 percent) had bubonic plague, and 12 (12 percent) had pneumonic\nplague. 2 or more plague cases were reported from 9 different\nvillages, including 4 villages that reported 10 or more cases (Nave,\n18; Kestro, 18; Andosi, 17; and Yiapi, 10). The median patient age\nwas 14 years (range: 2 weeks-65 years); 65 patients (51 percent) were\nfemale (Table).\n\nOf 11 pneumonic plague deaths, 6 (55 percent) occurred in a single\nvillage, in which 4 members of a single family died. Interviews with\nvillage residents indicated that the index case in that family was in\na boy aged 10 years who developed fever and a cervical bubo, followed\nby hemoptysis; he died on 3 Nov 2006. Within 7 days, the child's\nmother, grandmother, and aunt, all of whom had cared for the child,\nalso developed hemoptysis and died. Initially, ill village residents\ndid not seek health care because they believed the illness was of\nsupernatural origin stemming from a local feud. However, when 2\nadditional village members not involved in the feud died of similar\nsymptoms on 8 Nov 2006, ill villagers began seeking care at the\nhealth clinic, where they were treated with appropriate antibiotics\nand recovered.\n\nBubo aspirates were obtained from 11 (12 percent) of 90 patients with\nbubonic manifestations. None of the cases met the criteria for\nlaboratory confirmation. _Y. pestis_ was not recovered from any of\nthe 11 aspirates; however, 8 of the 11 patients had been treated with\nantibiotics before sample collection. Paired acute and convalescent\nblood samples were obtained from 7 (6 percent) of the 127 patients\nand convalescent blood samples alone from another 31 (24 percent). No\npaired serum samples had a 4-fold change in antibody titer. However,\nconvalescent sera from 5 (13 percent) of the 38 total patients with\nconvalescent samples had single titers that ranged from 1:16 to 1:256\n(median: 1:64), which is suggestive of recent or previous _Y. pestis_\ninfection. Samples were not available from any of the 12 patients who\nreceived a diagnosis of pneumonic plague; 11 of these patients died\nbefore the investigation began.\n\nTo evaluate access to care, patient behaviors, and potential plague\nexposures, structured interviews were conducted during 1-16 Dec 2006\nwith a convenience sample of 39 plague patients in 6 Arua and Nebbi\nvillages. Dates of illness onset for interviewed patients were from\n13 Oct 2006 to 14 Dec 2006. 27 patients (69 percent) reported that\nthey walked to the local health clinic for treatment of plague\nsymptoms, and 12 (31 percent) rode a bicycle. 15 patients (38\npercent) said travel to the nearest health clinic took more than 2\nhours, and 24 patients (62 percent) said travel took 2 hours or less.\n17 (44 percent) of the interviewed patients reported taking\nmedications, including acetaminophen, chloroquine, or traditional\nherbs, obtained in the village before visiting the clinic. 23\npatients (59 percent) reported seeing dead rats in their homes during\nthe 2 weeks preceding their illness; some villagers reported recently\nfinding and burying dead rats near their homes.\n\nWhile visiting villages, investigators in the 2 districts recovered 8\ndead rats (_Rattus rattus_), of which 4 tested positive for _Y.\npestis_ by direct fluorescent antibody staining and 2 tested positive\nby culture isolation. Live _R. rattus_ species trapped in 2 affected\nvillages were found to have an average of 2 fleas per rat; recovery\nof more than 1 flea per rat has been associated with increased risk\nfor plague transmission (3). On 8 Dec 2006, vector-control teams\ncomprised of local villagers began applying dichlorvos, a residual\ninsecticide, to households in affected villages in an effort to\ninterrupt plague transmission. By 14 Dec 2006, the teams had treated\n935 houses in 10 Arua District villages that had reported 2 or more\nplague cases since 1 Sep 2006. The death of the vector-control team\nleader from causes unrelated to plague prevented expansion of the\nspraying operation to affected villages in Nebbi District.\n\n[Reported by: Ogen-Odoi A, Katangole Mbidde E, Lutwama J, et al]\n\nEditorial note\n--------------\nAfrican countries accounted for nearly 90 percent of the 28 530\nplague cases reported to the World Health Organization during the\nmost recent 10-year reporting period (1994-2003) (4). In Uganda,\n200-400 clinically diagnosed plague cases are reported annually, with\nan estimated case-fatality rate of 30 percent (4). Although human\ncases typically occur sporadically or in small clusters, the\npotential for pneumonic outbreaks with spread to other areas is a\ngreat concern (5,6). Approximately 6 weeks after this investigation,\nan outbreak of pneumonic plague with 7 deaths was reported from\nMasindi District, a neighboring but ecologically distinct region\nwhere plague is not endemic. The index patient was an adolescent girl\naged 15 years who had become ill while visiting relatives in a\nplague-affected area of Nebbi District.\n\nThe investigation described in this report highlights some of the\nchallenges associated with identifying and controlling plague in\nrural Africa. Because of limited laboratory capacity, clinicians\nusually rely on clinical criteria alone when diagnosing illnesses.\nConsequently, patients with other causes of acute lymphadenitis (such\nas, staphylococcal) can be misdiagnosed as having plague, and\npatients with plague can be misdiagnosed as having other illnesses.\nWhen laboratory services are available, impassible roads and other\nlogistic barriers can prevent timely specimen collection. Patients\nwith less serious conditions might survive long enough to be tested;\nhowever, patients with more severe _Y. pestis_ infection are likely\nto die before specimens can be collected. Such differential testing\nmight have contributed to the low rate of seropositivity observed in\nthis investigation among those patients whose specimens were tested.\nGreater regional laboratory capacity and point-of-care diagnostic\nassays would help clinicians and health officials identify plague\ncases more quickly, distinguish these cases from other causes of\nsimilar illness, and facilitate more effective control of plague in\nAfrica.\n\nAlso highlighted by this investigation is the effect of local beliefs\non care-seeking behavior. Anthropologic studies have indicated that\ntribes living in Arua District hold diverse beliefs about disease\ncausation and the role of the supernatural in human illness (7).\nInvestigators observed that villagers initially ascribed an outbreak\nof pneumonic plague to feuding rather than to a disease that can be\ntreated with antibiotics. Because prompt antimicrobial treatment can\nbe life-saving for patients with plague, further studies are needed\nto 1) define local beliefs as they relate to plague, 2) determine how\nthey influence care-seeking, and 3) identify effective messages that\nwill result in plague patients seeking care at their local health\ncenter more quickly.\n\nTo enhance recognition, treatment, and control of plague in Uganda,\nCDC has entered into a cooperative agreement with the Uganda Ministry\nof Health and the Uganda Viral Research Institute. Studies are under\nway to 1) evaluate rapid, point-of-care diagnostic assays for plague,\n2) describe belief systems that influence health-care-seeking\nbehavior, 3) define the relative importance of various rodent and\nfleas species in plague transmission, and 4) assess opportunities for\nintegrating flea control into existing vector-control programs (such\nas, indoor residual spraying for malaria prevention). The overarching\ngoal of this multidisciplinary effort is to create effective\nprevention programs and develop and exercise local contingency plans\nfor plague outbreak response.\n\nReferences\n----------\n1.

That's bad news for the park's\nprairie dogs and black-footed ferrets, but visitors should be OK if\nthey use common sense safety precautions.\n\nSylvatic plague, which was 1st detected in South Dakota in 2004,\nturned up last year [2008] in the prairie dog population of the\nConata Basin just south of Badlands National Park. Since fleas spread\nplague from infected animals to healthy ones (and occasionally to\nhumans as well), officials ordered a flea suppression campaign that\nentailed applying insecticides to prairie dog colonies over an area\nof about 11 000 acres. In addition, black-footed ferrets were\ncaptured and given plague vaccinations. It was fervently hoped that\nthese measures would keep the disease from spreading to Badlands\nNational Park, which not only harbors many thousands of prairie dogs\nbut also a small and struggling population of endangered black-footed\nferrets that mainly feed on prairie dogs.\n\nAlas, about a week ago, wildlife biologists confirmed that the\nprairie dog population in the Sage Creek Wilderness Area of the park\nis being assaulted by sylvatic plague. Tularemia (rabbit fever) has\nalso been detected in one of the park's prairie dog colonies. Both\ndiseases sicken and kill prairie dogs, so this disease outbreak has\nthe potential to decimate the park's prairie dog population and\nperhaps undo much of the effort that's been invested in\nreestablishing black-footed ferrets there.\n\nAlthough few people in the U.S. have ever been infected by plague or\ntularemia, both diseases can be transmitted to humans and should be\nconsidered potentially dangerous. Park officials are advising\nvisitors to take these common sense safety precautions to minimize\nthe likelihood of infection:\n\n- Be aware that potentially dangerous diseases can be transmitted to\nhumans by way of ticks or bites and scratches, urine-contaminated\nwater, and the inhaling of infectious aerosols.\n- Apply DEET insect repellant to clothing and skin to avoid bites\nfrom fleas and ticks.\n- Avoid handling sick or dead animals in the park.\n- Do not allow pets to wander into prairie dog colonies where they\nmay come into contact with disease-carrying fleas.\n- See a doctor if you think that you may have been exposed to plague\nor tularemia.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Brent Barrett\n\n[These are diseases spread by ground squirrels and other wild\nrodents, frequently in the western portion of the United States.\n'Sylvatic' means pertaining to the woods (sylvan). These are diseases\nspread by wild rodents, which serve as a reservoir for humans. In the\nwestern part of the US, they are often spread by prairie dogs, ground\nsquirrels and other small ground rodents. These diseases can happen\nalmost anywhere, but we frequently see the problems in the western\nregion of the US.\n\nPlague results from infection by _Yersinia pestis_, a non-motile,\nfacultatively intracellular, Gram negative rod (family _Enterobacteriaceae_).\n\nPlague is usually spread between rodents or humans by the bites of\ninfected fleas. Vectors include a variety of rodent fleas,\nparticularly the oriental rat flea (_Xenopsylla Cheopis_). In the\nU.S., the most common vector is _Oropsylla Montana_, a flea often\nfound on California ground squirrels, rock squirrels, and sometimes\nother rodents including prairie dogs. Human fleas (_Pulex irritans)_\nmay also carry _Y. pestis_. _Y. pestis_ is also present in the\ntissues and body fluids of infected animals; these bacteria can be\ntransmitted directly through mucous membranes and broken skin.\nAerosols from people or animals with the pneumonic form are\ninfectious, and animals may transmit bacteria in bites. Carnivores\noften become infected when they eat diseased rodents.\n\nPrairie dogs are considered to be sensitive indicators of plague and tularemia.\n\nTularemia results from infection by _Francisella tularensis_\n(formerly known as _Pasteurella tularensis_), a Gram negative,\nnon-motile coccobacillus. Two subspecies exist: _F. tularensis\ntularensis_ (also known as Jellison type A) and _F. tularensis\nholarctica_ (Jellison type B). _F. tularensis tularensis_ is found in\nlagomorphs in North America and is highly virulent for humans and\ndomestic rabbits; _F. tularensis holarctica_ is less virulent and\noccurs in beavers, muskrats and voles in North America and in hares\nand small rodents in Eurasia.\n\n_F. tularensis_ can be transmitted by ingestion, inhalation,\narthropod-borne transfer or direct contact through the skin and\nmucous membranes. Organisms are found in the blood and tissues of\ninfected animals and can survive for long periods on fomites\nincluding food and water. Aquatic animals may develop tularemia after\nbeing immersed in contaminated water. Carnivores sometimes become\ninfected after ingesting a contaminated carcass. Vectors for _F.\ntularensis tularensis_ include ticks (including _Dermacentor\nandersoni_, _D. variabilis_ and _Amblyomma americanum_) and biting\nflies (particularly deerflies). _F. tularensis holarctica_ is also\ntransmitted by mosquitoes in Russia. Rarely, the organism is spread\nby animal bites.\n\n_F. tularensis_ can survive for long periods in arthropod vectors and\nin the environment. Individual flies may carry the organism for 2\nweeks and ticks throughout their lifetimes. Viable bacteria can also\nbe found for weeks to months in the carcasses and hides of infected\nanimals and in fomites including grain dust, straw, water, soil and\nbedbugs. This organism is highly resistant to freezing; live\norganisms have been found after 3 years in rabbit meat stored at -15 C.\n\nPortions of this comment have been extracted from:\n<http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/Tularemia.pdf> and\n<http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/factsheets/pdfs/plague.pdf>. - Mod.TG]", "summary": "A ProMED-mail post\n<http://www.promedmail.org>\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\n<http://www.isid.org>\n\nDate: 11 Jul 20099\n Park officials are advising\nvisitors to take these common sense safety precautions to minimize\nthe likelihood of infection:\n\n- Be aware that potentially dangerous diseases can be transmitted to\nhumans by way of ticks or bites and scratches, urine-contaminated\nwater, and the inhaling of infectious aerosols.

Furthermore, some notable outbreaks\nhave been reported in Asia in the last 20 years. A limited outbreak with 5\ncases has recently been notified by the health authorities of the Libyan\nArab Jamahiriya.\n\nIntroduction\n------------\nPlague is a zoonosis caused by the bacillus _Yersinia pestis_. This disease\nmay have caused over 200 million deaths in the history of humanity (1). The\ndisease is principally transmitted from animal to animal by fleas. Humans\nusually become infected through the bite of an infected flea (mainly)\n_Xenopsylla cheopis_). The occurrence of bubonic plague cases is therefore\nthe result of the presence of fleas, rodents, and humans in a given place\nat a given time.\n\nSince the 1st description of what may have been a plague outbreak in 430 BC\nin Ancient Greece (2), the plague has spread worldwide during the course of\nseveral pandemic waves. Between 1998 and 2008, more than 23 278 cases were\nreported including 2116 fatalities (case fatality ratio, CFR, of\napproximately 9 per cent) in 11 countries (3). Over 95 per cent of the 23\n278 cases, however, were reported in Africa with well-identified endemic\nplague foci (mainly in 3 countries: Madagascar, the Democratic Republic of\nCongo [DRC], and Tanzania).\n\nThe bubonic plague is the most common form of the disease (93 per cent of\nplague cases in Madagascar (4) and 81 per cent of plague cases in the\nUnited States (US) (5). Without adequate treatment, the case-fatality rate\nof bubonic plague ranges from 50 to 90 per cent. Bubonic plague does not\ngive rise to direct human-to-human transmission.\n\nPulmonary plague is not the most frequent form of the disease (3 per cent\nof the plague cases in the US, 8 per cent in DRC, sometimes more frequent\nin outbreaks with sustained human-to-human transmission), but is deadly in\nalmost all cases in absence of adequate and timely treatment. This clinical\npresentation may give rise to human-to-human transmission through droplet\ntransmission. Available evidence points to effective prevention of\nhuman-to-human transmission of pneumonic plague through isolation and\ntreatment of cases and the observance of standard precautions completed by\ndroplet and contact precautions during healthcare (6,7). There is no\navailable vaccine for large-scale use.\n\nOutbreak report\n---------------\nOn 14 Jun 2009, the health authorities of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya\nreported suspected cases of bubonic plague (including one death) to the\nWorld Health Organization in compliance with the Revised International\nHealth Regulations (IHR) [see ProMED-mail post Plague, bubonic - Libya:\n(BN) 20090616.2227].\n\nThe case definition proposed by the World Health Organization was used (8).\nThe outbreak occurred in a semi-nomadic setting. Subsequent epidemiological\ninvestigations by an international team ascertained a total of 5 cases. 3\nof these occurred in a family cluster in the Tobruk rural area (near the\nborder with Egypt). The 1st identified case was a child who presented with\npneumonic plague and died. 2 siblings were subsequently identified as\nhaving bubonic plague. 2 other epidemiologically unlinked cases occurred in\nyoung women living in the same district. Confirmatory testing is ongoing.\nRodent control measures have been implemented locally.\n\nThe last outbreak reported in the Maghreb to date occurred in Algeria in\nJuly 2008. At that time, the Algerian health authorities reported 4 cases\nincluding 3 fatalities in Laghouat [WHO, unpublished data]. All identified\ncases presented with bubonic plague. The last outbreak reported by the\nLibyan Ministry of Health occurred in 1984 with 8 cases of bubonic plague\n(no deaths) (1). The last deaths due to plague reported in that country\noccurred during a 1977 outbreak that affected 11 people (6 deaths).\n\nDiscussion and conclusion\n-------------------------\nThe implementation in 2007 of the revised IHR and improved surveillance in\nmany countries has strengthened communication between countries and WHO.\nRegional networks have also emerged which facilitate cross-border and\nregional exchange of public health alerts. The Libyan health authorities\nhave been prompt in describing and reporting the outbreak described here,\nthereby enabling speedy confirmation and the implementation of control\nmeasures.\n\nThe Maghreb is no longer considered an endemic area for plague (9). The\nrecent human plague clusters, however, raise the issue of the persistence\nof a large focus or of several limited natural foci, which have been\nquiescent for decades and remain capable of 're-emergence' at various dates\nand locations (Table, Figure [available at the source URL above]). These\nclusters of human cases are generally sporadic and limited, but they may\ncontinue to occur despite the necessary extensive rodent control measures,\nwhich will probably be insufficient to eradicate the plague reservoir in\nwild animals. Health care workers require training to better recognise\nsigns of a disease, which is no longer endemic. Informing and increasing\nawareness of populations living in and around plague foci, strengthening of\nlocal health systems and targeted public health measures around the cases\nremain the key control strategies in plague-prone areas. Improved knowledge\nof the natural foci is also a pre-requisite for any rational vector and\nrodent control.\n\nReferences\n----------\n1. WHO.

Symptoms of bubonic plague\nin humans include fever; chills; painful swollen lymph nodes in the\ngroin, armpit or neck; and sometimes headache, vomiting and diarrhea.\nSepticemic plague, which occurs when the bacteria spread to the\nblood, also can bring a high fever, abdominal pain and diarrhea.\nPneumonic plague involves the lungs and is the form that can spread\ndirectly from person to person.\nNew Mexico reported 5 human cases of plague in 2007 with one\nfatality.

Plague is almost always fatal to infected\nprairie dogs and has killed a large number of the rodents, wildlife\nexperts said. Black-footed ferrets hunt and dine almost exclusively\non prairie dogs.\n\n'When ferrets eat an infected prairie dog, they'll get a massive\ndose' of plague, said Kevin Atchley, Wall District ranger for the\nU.S. Forest Service. 'It's likely that some ferrets have perished.'\n\nThe infected area has bloomed from 4000 acres to 9100 acres as of\nlast week [1 - 4 Jul 2008], Atchley said. The infected area is within\nthe 300 000-acre Conata Basin south of Wall, SD.\n\nPlague is an infectious disease caused by the bacterium _Yersinia\npestis_. The disease, also known as bubonic plague, spread through\nthe West after it appeared in San Francisco in 1902. It was 1st\ndetected in South Dakota wildlife in western Custer County in 2004.\n\nThe disease is mainly spread through wildlife populations -- coyotes\nbeing a favored traveling host -- by infected fleas that transmit the\ndisease through their bite.\n\nIn late May [2008], workers with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service,\nthe U.S. Forest Service, the National Park Service and the U.S.\nDepartment of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection\nService began dusting prairie dog towns with insecticide to kill the\nfleas but keep the ferret's preferred food source alive.\n\nThe insecticide, similar to what is given to dogs and cats to control\nfleas, is released via a wand sprayer from a tank mounted on an\nall-terrain vehicle. Workers stick the wand down each burrow entrance\nto release the dust. As the prairie dogs enter and exit, the dust is\nrubbed into the fur and kills the fleas. As of last week, workers\ndusted 2440 acres of prairie dog towns, including 700 acres within\nBadlands National Park.\n\n'We've dusted specific areas to hold onto our good, productive ferret\nareas,' said Scott Larson, spokesman for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife\nService in Pierre, SD. 'We think it's taken out a lot of the prairie\ndog population, and a lot of that (area) is occupied by ferrets.'\n\n'We'll spray one-third of the colonies to protect two-thirds of the\nferret population,' Atchley said.\n\nThe plague is headed toward Badlands National Park.\n\n'We're anticipating that it'll be in our prairie dog towns,' said\nBrian Kenner, chief of resource management for the park. 'I don't\nthink there's any way to stop it. We don't have a strategy to stop\nit. It can jump pretty far.'\n\nDusting also will be done along Highway 44 and Conata Basin Road as a\nprecaution against a transfer to people. Transmission between\nwildlife and humans is rare, but it is possible. There has never been\na case of human plague reported in South Dakota, said state\nepidemiologist Dr. Lon Kightlinger.\n\nStill, signs have been posted along Highway 44 in the Conata Basin\nand Badlands National Park, warning visitors of the threat. The\nbright yellow signs advise people to stay in their vehicle -- and\nkeep their pets inside the vehicle as well -- around prairie dog villages.\n\nVisitors don't seem to be worried.\n\n'Very few people have expressed a concern about it,' said Judy Olson,\nchief of interpretation for the park.\n\nYet the threat remains for the black-footed ferret, once thought to\nbe extinct but now representing one of the most successful\nreintroduction efforts of wild animals back into a species'\nhistorical range. For the black-footed ferret, that range included\ngrassland habitats in 12 U.S. states, two Canadian provinces and\npossibly northern Mexico.\n\nThe last wild ferrets -- Fish and Wildlife Service officials called\nthem the rarest 18 mammals on Earth -- were captured in Wyoming in\n1987 to begin the breeding and reintroduction program. There are an\nestimated 600 to 800 ferrets now living at 15 reintroduction sites.\n\nAbout 300 ferrets live within the Conata Basin -- considered by\nwildlife advocates to be the most successful of all the sites.\n\nBut the outbreak could hamper future release efforts in western South Dakota.\n\n'We're very concerned,' Larson said. 'That's why we're out there with\nthe other agencies to put down that dust.'\n\n[Byline: Thom Gabrukiewicz\n<tgabrukiew@argusleader.com>]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[A photo of the black-footed ferret may be found at:\n<http://animals.nationalgeographic.com/animals/mammals/black-footed-ferret.html>\n\nIt has taken a little less than a year for this disease to reach the\nConata Basin.

Each\nrodent species is host to one or more species of flea, which, when\ninfected, is a carrier. These fleas generally do not infest other\nanimals unless their natural hosts are unavailable. Rock squirrels\n(_Spermophilus variegatus_) are closely related to California ground\nsquirrels and are the most significant plague host in Colorado. Their\nprincipal flea (_Diamanus montanus_) is an aggressive parasite and\nwill readily bite other animals and people. Domestic cats and dogs\ncan also contract plague by infective fleas.

The other 4 cases were in Teton\nCounty and the Greater Yellowstone Area of northwestern Wyoming.\n\n'Plague is an important consideration when mountain lions are found\nsick or dead in Wyoming and elsewhere in the western United States,'\nCornish said.\n\nThose who find sick or dead mountain lions or similar species,\nincluding bobcats, should avoid contact with the animals and are\nasked to contact the Wyoming Game and Fish Department (WGFD), Cornish\nsaid. Contact information for regional offices can be found on the\nWGFD website at\n<http://gf.state.wy.us/admin/regional/index.asp>.\n\n'Appropriate personal safety precautions should be taken by wildlife\nprofessionals working in the field and diagnosticians working in\nlaboratories when handling these animals or their tissues,' he added.\nInformation on how people can protect themselves is available on the\nWyoming State Veterinary Laboratory (WSVL) website at\n<http://wyovet.uwyo.edu/Disease_Updates.asp>.\n\n'Plague is a serious zoonotic disease capable of causing significant\nillness and even death in humans, as exemplified by a recent fatal\ncase of plague in a wildlife biologist working at Grand Canyon\nNational Park (in Arizona),' Cornish said. A zoonotic disease is one\nthat can be transmitted from animals to humans.\n\nThe National Park Service biologist, Eric York, 37, performed a\nnecropsy of a mountain lion carcass last October [2007], and\napproximately 5 days later, he developed a high temperature, mild\nnausea, muscle aches, chills, a cough and streaks of blood in his\nsaliva, according to an article in the April 2008 edition of the\nNewsletter of the Wildlife Disease Association (WDA).\n\nYork died several days later, and specimens from the biologist and\nthe mountain lion both tested positive for the bacterium that causes\nplague, _Yersinia pestis_, according to the WDA article.\n\nWildlife biologists, wildlife veterinarians, public health officials,\nhunters skinning an animal with plague and the owners of domestic\ncats stricken with the disease are among those susceptible to plague.\nCats can contract plague by eating an infected rodent or by being\nbitten by fleas from an infected host.\n\nCornish said: 'What's becoming more of a common recommendation is to\navoid allowing your cats to hunt wildlife. Concerned cat owners\nshould also consider visiting with their veterinarian about a\nflea-control program.'\n\nThere have been one fatal and 4 non-fatal cases of humans contracting\nplague in Wyoming since 1978, said Karl Musgrave, state public health\nveterinarian with the Wyoming Department of Health. There were 2\ncases in Washakie County and one each in Goshen, Laramie and Sheridan counties.\n\nThe 1992 Sheridan County case resulted in the death of a man after he\ncontracted the disease when skinning an infected bobcat. The Goshen\nCounty case involved a resident of Colorado.\n\nWGFD assistant veterinarian Cynthia Tate said: 'Finding plague in\nanimals such as mountain lions and bobcats -- and occasionally\ndomestic cats -- is not surprising because they eat rodents, and\nrodents are the typical carriers.'\n\nTate added: 'Those who hunt or trap predators should protect\nthemselves while skinning animals or handling traps by wearing long\nrubber or latex gloves. They should avoid contact with an animal that\nappears sick (rough hair, coat and/or drainage out of the eyes) and\nimmediately contact the WGFD.'\n\nTate cautions that animals having plague may not appear sick because\nthe disease can kill rapidly. The incubation period of plague is\nbetween 2 and 6 days after exposure, she noted. If hunters or others\ndevelop flu-like symptoms within that period, they should call their doctor.\n\nKen Mills, a professor in the UW Department of Veterinary Sciences,\nsaid: 'Plague could be a risk to mountain lion hunters, but I see it\nas more of a risk to the owners of domestic cats allowed to go\noutside and hunt rodents.'\n\nThere have been at least 7 unrelated cases of plague in domestic cats\nin Wyoming since 2005, Mills said. They included 4 in Laramie County\nand one each in Albany, Natrona and Teton counties.\n\n'If your cat develops a fever and has swollen lymph nodes, it is\ndefinitely time to call a veterinarian,' he said.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Cats are sensitive indicators of plague. The size of the cat is\nimmaterial, and these cases demonstrate the sensitivity. Prairie dogs\nare more sensitive than cats, but nevertheless, cats are quite sensitive.\n\nOften, plague in cats, particularly domestic cats, may initially be\nconfused with a cat fight or cat bite abscess, as there are often\nswellings in the mandibular region. These swellings are buboes,\nabscesses from a fight. Consequently, veterinarians, technicians,\nanimal shelter workers and animal caretakers may be come victims when\nbuboes rupture.\n\nPlague, caused by _Yersinia pestis_, is an acute and sometimes fatal\nbacterial zoonosis that is transmitted primarily by the fleas of rats\nand other rodents. Enzootic foci of sylvatic plague exist in the\nwestern USA and throughout the world, including Eurasia, Africa, and\nNorth and South America. In addition to rodents, other mammalian\nspecies that have been naturally infected with _Y. pestis_ include\nlagomorphs, felids, canids, mustelids, and some ungulates. Domestic\ncats and dogs have also developed plague from oral mucous membrane\nexposure to infected rodent tissues, typically when they are allowed\nto roam and hunt in enzootic areas. Birds and other non-mammalian\nvertebrates appear to be resistant to plague. On average, 10 human\nplague cases are reported each year in the USA; the majority are from\nNew Mexico, California, Colorado, and Arizona. Most human cases\nresult from the bite of an infected flea, although direct contact\nwith infected wild rabbits, rodents, and occasionally other wildlife\nand exposure to infected domestic cats are also risk factors.\n\n_Y. pestis_ is a gram-negative, nonmotile, coccobacillus belonging to\nthe _Enterobacteriacae_ family. It exhibits a bipolar staining,\n'safety pin' appearance when stained with Wright, Giemsa, or Wayson\nstains. _Y. pestis_ grows slowly even at optimal temperatures (28 C)\nand can require greater than 48 hours to produce colonies. Several\ntypes of media can be used to grow _Y. pestis_, including blood agar,\nnutrient broth, and un-enriched agar. Colonies are small (1-2 mm),\ngray, nonmucoid, and have a characteristic 'hammered copper'\nappearance. Different virulence factors are expressed by the organism\nat different temperatures and environments, allowing the organism to\nsurvive in flea vectors and then be transmitted to and multiply in\nmammalian hosts. The organism does not survive for long at high\ntemperatures or in dry environments.\n\n_Y. pestis_ is easily destroyed by sunlight and drying. Even so, when\nreleased into air, the bacterium will survive for up to one hour,\nalthough this could vary depending on conditions.\n\nPneumonic plague is one of several forms of plague. Depending on\ncircumstances, these forms may occur separately or in combination.\n\nPneumonic plague occurs when _Y. pestis_ infects the lungs. This type\nof plague can spread from person to person through the air.\nTransmission can take place if someone breathes in aerosolized\nbacteria, which could happen in a bioterrorist attack. Pneumonic\nplague is also spread by breathing in _Y. pestis_ suspended in\nrespiratory droplets from a person (or animal) with pneumonic plague.\nBecoming infected in this way usually requires direct and close\ncontact with the ill person or animal. Pneumonic plague may also\noccur if a person with bubonic or septicemic plague is untreated and\nthe bacteria spread to the lungs.\n\nBubonic plague is the most common form of plague. This occurs when an\ninfected flea bites a person or when materials contaminated with _Y.\npestis_ enter through a break in a person's skin. Patients develop\nswollen, tender lymph glands (called buboes) and fever, headache,\nchills, and weakness. Bubonic plague does not spread from person to person.\n\nSepticemic plague occurs when plague bacteria multiply in the blood.\nIt can be a complication of pneumonic or bubonic plague or it can\noccur by itself. When it occurs alone, it is caused in the same ways\nas bubonic plague; however, buboes do not develop. Patients have\nfever, chills, prostration, abdominal pain, shock, and bleeding into\nskin and other organs. Septicemic plague does not spread from person to person.\n\nSymptoms and Treatment:\nWith pneumonic plague, the 1st signs of illness are fever, headache,\nweakness, and rapidly developing pneumonia with shortness of breath,\nchest pain, cough, and sometimes bloody or watery sputum. The\npneumonia progresses for 2 to 4 days and may cause respiratory\nfailure and shock. Without early treatment, patients may die.\n\nEarly treatment of pneumonic plague is essential. To reduce the\nchance of death, antibiotics must be given within 24 hours of 1st\nsymptoms. Streptomycin, gentamicin, the tetracyclines, and\nchloramphenicol are all effective against pneumonic plague.\n\nAntibiotic treatment for 7 days will protect people who have had\ndirect, close contact with infected patients. Wearing a close-fitting\nsurgical mask also protects against infection.\n\nA plague vaccine is not currently available for use in the United States.\n\nPortions of this comment were extracted from:\n<http://www.merckvetmanual.com/mvm/index.jsp?cfile=htm/bc/51900.htm&word=plague>\nand\n<http://www.bt.cdc.gov/agent/plague/factsheet.asp>.\n- Mod.TG]", "summary": "\n\nThe National Park Service biologist, Eric York, 37, performed a\nnecropsy of a mountain lion carcass last October [2007], and\napproximately 5 days later, he developed a high temperature, mild\nnausea, muscle aches, chills, a cough and streaks of blood in his\nsaliva, according to an article in the April 2008 edition of the\n A ProMED-mail post\n<http://www.promedmail.org>\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\n<http://www.isid.org>\n\nDate: 21 May 2008\n \n\nWGFD assistant veterinarian Cynthia Tate said: 'Finding plague in\nanimals such as mountain lions and bobcats -- and occasionally\ndomestic cats -- is not surprising because they eat rodents, and\nrodents are the typical carriers.'\n\n Plague is a serious zoonotic disease capable of causing significant\nillness and even death in humans, as exemplified by a recent fatal\ncase of plague in a wildlife biologist working at Grand Canyon\nNational Park (in Arizona),' Cornish said.

The most common and\nmost treatable form is bubonic plague, which results in swelling of\nlymph nodes in the neck.

Before that case, plague\nhad not been confirmed in South Dakota for decades, although plague\nhad wiped out prairie dog towns in eastern Wyoming.\nPlague in prairie dogs and other animals (known as sylvatic plague)\ngenerally does not pose a widespread threat to humans, although\npeople can get the disease.\nHowever, the appearance of plague has wildlife officials worried\nabout the already established ferret population in Conata Basin.\nAfter the Custer County case, plague killed thousands of prairie dogs\nin a huge complex north of Oglala on the Pine Ridge Indian\nReservation 2 years ago.\nSince then, plague has spread on the reservation, with smaller\noutbreaks east of Oglala to the Wolf Creek community northeast of\nPine Ridge, west near the Prairie Wind Casino, and about 15 miles\nnorth just below Cuny Table and Red Shirt Table, according to Trudy\nEcoffey, senior biologist with the Oglala Sioux Tribe Parks and\nRecreation Department.\nEcoffey said she thought last fall that the plague would spread\nfaster. But it hasn't moved far this summer [2007], she said.\nAlthough plague showed up northeast of Pine Ridge, it skipped other\nprairie dog towns between Oglala and Pine Ridge, she said.\nEcoffey said she estimates plague has affected 30 000 acres of\nprairie dogs. She said pockets of prairie dogs have begun showing up\nagain at the huge complex just north of Oglala.\nNow, plague is suspected of spreading west, where it has killed\nsizeable numbers of prairie dogs in eastern Fall River County on the\nBuffalo Gap National Grassland, east of Smithwick, according to Fall\nRiver District Ranger Mike McNeill.\nThe die-offs are in the heart of an area targeted for a ferret\nreintroduction, he said.\nAlthough no prairie dogs have been tested and confirmed with plague,\nthey have disappeared from large colonies in the area. McNeill said\nplague is the most reasonable explanation.\nOf 900-1200 acres in the area occupied by prairie dogs a year or 2\nago east of Smithwick, only about 450-500 acres have prairie dogs\nnow, according to U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service biologist Scott\nLarson of Pierre.\nThe die-off makes the area much less attractive as a site to\nreintroduce black-footed ferrets, Larson said. 'It becomes a lower\npriority at this time.'\nBut Larson wouldn't rule out the Smithwick area for a future ferret\nreintroduction. 'We probably have better sites now than Smithwick. It\nmight look entirely different in 5 years.'\nFerrets can get plague by eating prairie dogs that have died of the\ndisease or may get it from fleas that carry the organism, as prairie\ndogs do. Prairie dogs make up about 90 percent of the ferrets' diet.\nFerrets reintroduced elsewhere in the country have died from eating\nplague-infected prairie dogs, Larson said.\nFWS officials have said plague in prairie dog towns has hampered\nblack-footed ferret reintroductions in Wyoming, Montana, Colorado and Utah.\nOfficials also said ferrets can get plague from one flea bite.\nWildlife officials continue to worry about plague harming the\nestimated 250 black-footed ferrets now roaming Conata Basin just\nsouth of Badlands National Park's North Unit.\nConata Basin is about 40 miles northeast of the big Oglala complex\nhit hard by plague in 2005. With plague now approaching Cuny Table,\nit is about 25 miles from Conata Basin.\nAt Conata Basin, the government has spent years and millions of\ndollars to establish a population of black-footed ferrets, which were\nonce thought to be extinct.\nTo protect the project, FWS crews have been dusting prairie dog\nburrows in Conata Basin with an insecticide that kills fleas, the\nprimary carriers of plague.\nThis year [2007], they will dust about 1600 acres of at least 26 000\nacres occupied by prairie dogs, Larson said. But the dusting is being\ndone in an area known to be occupied by ferrets.\nThe dusting by itself won't keep the plague out of Conata Basin,\nLarson said. 'We're hoping to hang on to a few ferret-occupied areas\nin case it comes in.'\nNow in its 3rd year, the dusting appears to be reducing the number of\nfleas, according to David Jachowski, an FWS biologist with the\nnational Black-footed Ferret Conservation Center in Colorado who is\nhelping with the dusting. 'We see fewer fleas on prairie dogs,' Jachowski said.\nCrews dusted 7000 acres 2 years ago. They spray an insecticide powder\ninto the prairie dog burrows, where it gets onto the prairie dogs'\nhides and kills fleas.\nCrews sprayed more than 300 000 burrows in 2005, according to Micah\nReuber, a biologist with FWS, based in Wall.\nIronically, the FWS crews dusting for plague to prevent prairie dogs\nand ferrets from getting plague are working in areas not far from\nplaces where state crews have poisoned prairie dogs in recent years\nto keep them from spreading onto nearby private rangeland.\nRanchers have complained prairie dogs damaged vegetation on their\nprivate ground and on parts of the national grassland they lease for grazing.\nThe Nebraska National Forest, which administers the Buffalo Gap\nNational Grassland, is considering expanding the poisoning to kill\nprairie dogs in the interior of Conata Basin beyond the\npublic-private boundaries.\nMost of the poisoning alternatives being considered are aimed at\ncapping prairie dog acres on the national grasslands.\nEnvironmental groups say the poisoning, particularly if expanded into\nthe grasslands interior, poses a threat to the ferrets and other\nspecies, such as the burrowing owl, that depend on prairie dogs.\nThey argue that ferrets, one of the rarest mammals in the world,\noccupy just 6 10ths of one percent of the national grasslands and\nthat some of the poisoning alternatives would reduce that percentage\neven lower. Livestock are allowed to graze on approximately 99\npercent of the national grasslands.\nArt Smith, wildlife-damage-management program administrator for the\nSouth Dakota Game, Fish & Parks Department, said none of the areas\nbeing dusted for fleas in order to protect prairie dogs are areas\nbeing poisoned to kill prairie dogs.\n'In some areas, (the prairie dog) needs to be controlled,' Smith\nsaid. 'In other areas, it needs to be protected.'\nMeanwhile, Larson said, the annual ferret population survey in Conata\nBasin has just begun.\n'They're finding decent numbers,' he said. Last year's [2006] survey\ncounted about 245 ferrets, he said.\nBut if plague gets into Conata Basin and threatens the ferrets,\nfederal officials might move the ferrets elsewhere.\nSo far, it appears the plague has been confined to the Pine Ridge\nReservation and a little way into Fall River County.\nEcoffey, who is monitoring the plague's spread on the Pine Ridge\nReservation, said the disease eventually may reach Conata Basin, home\nof the endangered ferrets. 'If it's here to stay, there's no reason\nto say it won't,' she said.\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\n[Fall River county is in the southwest corner of the state of North Dakota.\n<http://www.mapsofworld.com/usa/states/south-dakota/maps/south-dakota-county-map.jpg>.\nPrairie dogs are often sensitive sentinels for plague.

The sites are at Schriever Air\nForce Base and on neighboring property, in eastern El Paso County.\nPlague is commonly found in the Western US in small ground animals\nthat have been bitten by fleas.\nHuman cases aren't common, but plague can be transmitted to people\nfrom infected animals. Since 1941, there have been 55 cases statewide\nof human plague.\nAccording to the Health Department, take the following precautions to\nprevent infection:\n* Avoid contact with sick or dead prairie dogs and rabbits.\n* Keep a close eye on pets, and make sure they are treated for fleas\nand properly secured when outdoors.\n* Do not linger in areas populated by prairie dogs, rabbits, or\nsimilar animals. Also do not attempt to catch, feed, or play with them.\n* Treat pants, socks, shoe tops, arms, and legs with insect repellent\nwhen engaged in outdoor activities, such as hiking or jogging.\n* Be aware of dead animal smells or heavy fly populations indicating\nanimal 'die-offs,' which are a key sign of plague. Report such areas\nto the Health Department.\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Joseph P. Dudley, Ph.D\n[Prairie dogs are often sensitive sentinels for plague. A photo of a\nprairie dog may be seen at\n<http://www.northrup.org/photos/Animals/nl-41.htm>.\nBlack-tailed prairie dogs (_Cynomys ludovicianus_) are numerous in Colorado.\nThe causative bacterium _Yersinia pestis_ is transmitted to people\nthrough fleabite and direct contact with infected animals. Each\nrodent species is host to one or more species of fleas which, when\ninfected, are carriers. These fleas generally do not infest other\nanimals unless their natural hosts are unavailable. Rock squirrels\n(_Spermophilus variegates_) are closely related to California ground\nsquirrels and are the most significant plague host in Colorado. Their\nprincipal flea _Diamanus montanus_ is an aggressive parasite and will\nreadily bite other animals and people. Domestic cats and dogs can\nalso contract plague by infective fleas. They may carry infected\nfleas home to their owners or, especially with cats, serve as a\ndirect source of infection.\nIn humans, the incubation period (interval between exposure and\nappearance of symptoms) is usually 2-6 days. Typical symptoms include\nsudden onset of fever and chills, severe headache, muscle aches,\nnausea, vomiting, and a general feeling of systemic illness. Extreme\npain and swelling in a lymph node draining the infection site is a\nsuggestive symptom of bubonic plague. (The swollen, painful node is\ncalled a 'bubo'). Other forms of the disease include septicemic\nillness with no bubo developing, and pneumonic plague in which the\nlungs are involved. The septicemic and pneumonic forms are the most\nserious. In addition, pneumonic plague can be spread by inhalation of\ninfective droplets expelled by another human or animal with plague pneumonia.\nTreatment with antibiotics is effective during the early stages of\ndisease. If diagnosis and appropriate treatment are delayed,\nlife-threatening complications may follow. A doctor or hospital\nemergency room should be consulted as soon as symptoms appear and a\nhistory of exposure to potentially infected animals is very important\nin evaluating the risk from plague.

They will also knock on doors to warn\nresidents and distribute brochures explaining how to avoid\ncontracting the severe infection, which is commonly spread to humans\nfrom fleas that have feasted on infected rodents.\nThe woman has recovered after being hospitalized and already has been\nspreading the word in her neighborhood, according to the New Mexico\nDepartment of Health. The woman had septicemic plague, a blood\ninfection that can cause death. Symptoms can include fever, vomiting,\ndiarrhea, abdominal pain, low blood pressure, blood-clotting\nproblems, and organ failure.\nDr. Paul Ettestad, a public health veterinarian for the Health\nDepartment, said it's not a good sign that the state has confirmed 4\ncases of plague since April [2007]. 'It could be a significant year\nfor a lot of plague activity,' he said.\nPrairie dogs and rock squirrels, common carriers of the plague, may\nhave swelled in number over the past couple of years because of\nwetter than usual seasons, Ettestad said. Combine a lot of rodents\nwith a cool, wet spring, in which fleas multiply, and you have got a\nmixture that could produce more plague cases in humans in 2007, he\nsaid.\nRecent cases seem to have other factors in common: plague-infected\nrodents scurrying near but not inside the house, cats or dogs that\nlike to hunt rodents, cats or dogs that have not been treated for\nfleas, and cats or dogs that flop on beds or couches inside the\nhouse. Ettestad admits it is hard to prove that this is exactly how\nthe fleas got from the rodents to the humans, but he thinks it is\nplausible.\n'There are ways to protect you and your pets from plague: Prevent\nyour pets from roaming and hunting rodents, use a flea control\nproduct on all your pets, and do not allow them to sleep in bed with\nyou,' Ettestad said.\nLast year [2006], 8 people in New Mexico had confirmed cases of\nplague, and 2 of them died.

Local bacterial proliferation\nis sometimes evident (4-10 percent of cases) in the form of an\nabscess or ulcer at the site of infection (1).\nSepticemic plague may occur as a consequence of more common\nbubonic form or may occur after exposure without the development of\na bubo. The absence of a bubo may delay considering the appropriate\ndiagnosis and treatment, increasing morbidity and mortality.\nThe mechanism of transmission of plague from flea to mammalian host\nis as follows:\nFleas become infected upon feeding on the blood of a rodent suffering\nfrom bacteremic infection. The bacteria are restricted to the\nalimentary tract of the flea, where they multiply in the midgut. The\nbacteria may form large brown clumps that extend throughout the\nmidgut, esophagus and proventriculus, a valve-like chamber situated\nbetween the esophagus and the midgut. The clumps increase in mass\nover a few days until the proventriculus is blocked.\nThe 'blocked' flea then feeds on blood, but the meal is unable to\npass into the stomach. The flea continues to attempt to feed, but as\nit futilely sucks blood from the host, the blood meal, mixed with\nbacteria from the foregut, is regurgitated into the mammal.

A citizen had\nnoticed a die-off of squirrels in the neighborhood and reported it to\nDenver Animal Control. A carcass was collected Wednesday and tested\nat the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment\nlaboratory where preliminary tests were positive for plague.\nJohn Pape, an epidemiologist who specializes in animal-related\ndiseases for the department's Disease Control and Environmental\nEpidemiology Division, said, 'Plague is a disease seen every year\namong rodent populations in rural areas of Colorado, including the\nFront Range. It is unusual to find plague in the center of an urban\narea although it has happened before.' In Colorado, plague-infected\nanimals are most likely found in the foothills and mountains, he\nadded.\nAccording to Pape, 'Plague [bacteria are] maintained in various\nspecies of rodents and rabbits and transmitted by fleas. When an\ninfected rodent becomes sick and dies, its fleas can carry the\ninfection to other warm-blooded animals, including humans. People\nalso can be exposed through direct contact with infected rodents,\nrabbits and cats.'\n'The risk of Denver residents contracting plague is extremely low,'\nsaid Denver Public Health Director Dr. Chris Urbina. 'We want people\nto be aware of what to look for and take a few simple precautions to\nfurther reduce that risk.' He indicated that Denver Health, the\nColorado Department of Public Health and Environment and Denver\nEnvironmental Health are working together to investigate the case and\nto determine the extent of the die-off in the area.\nWhen plague appears in an area, there is usually a die-off of the\nrodents and rabbits. When the animal dies, the fleas leave the\ncarcass to find another host thus spreading the disease. Most human\nplague cases result from infected fleabites. Less commonly, people\nare infected by direct contact with blood from an infected animal or\nfrom cats which can become infected and transmit the disease.\nPeople should not directly handle any dead rodents they find and\nshould keep their pets away from them. If a dead rodent is found, do\nnot handle the animal directly. Use gloves and place in a plastic\nbag. Contact CO-HELP (Colorado Health Education Line for the Public)\nat 1-877-462-2911 to report a dead rodent or rabbit. Although the\nillness is severe and potentially life threatening, human cases occur\ninfrequently and plague is easily treated with common antibiotics\nwhen recognized early.\nDr. Urbina said that after 2-6 days after being infected, people\nbecome very ill with the following symptoms:\nA sudden onset of high fever;\nMuscle pain;\nMalaise; or a general feeling of being ill;\nNausea and vomiting.\n'With bubonic plague, individuals develop a large, swollen, painful\nlymph node called a bubo in the area of the flea bite, usually in the\ngroin or armpit,' he explained. 'If untreated, the disease can enter\nthe bloodstream (septicemic plague) or lungs (pneumonic plague) which\nare severe, life-threatening complications.'\nAccording to Pape, since 1957, 58 cases of human plague, 9 (15.5\npercent) of which were fatal, have been confirmed in Colorado. In\n2004, 3 human cases of plague were reported, including one fatality.\nHunters infected while cleaning rabbits comprised 2 of these cases,\nand another person was infected by a fleabite while camping. A total\nof 4 cases was reported in both 2005 and 2006; none of these 8 cases\nwas fatal. Most were infected by fleabites from around their home.\nPlague was identified last year in wild animals from 25 Colorado\ncounties, according to Pape. Veterinarians' diagnosed 23\nplague-infected cats, which are highly susceptible to plague and are\nusually infected from eating rodents. Cats with plague become\nextremely ill and develop an illness very similar to people with high\nfever and swollen lymph nodes.\nOwners are advised to contact their veterinarian if they see these\nsigns in a cat, especially cats known to hunt rodents. Dogs are\ngenerally resistant to plague but can bring infected fleas into the\nhome.\nPape and Urbina offered the following precautions for Denver citizens to take:\nDo not feed squirrels or other rodents. This brings them onto your\nproperty and in close contact with each other increasing the risk of\ndisease transmission;\nRodent-proof houses and outbuildings;\nDon't let dogs or cats catch or eat squirrels;\nDo not allow pets to roam freely, and keep them treated for fleas\naccording to a veterinarian's advice;\nBe aware of rodent and rabbit populations in your area and report\nsudden die-offs or multiple dead animals;\nContact your physician if you develop a high fever and other plague\nsymptoms following a fleabite or direct contact with dead rodents or\nrabbits.\nAdditional information on plague can be found on the CDPHE website:\n<http://www.cdphe.state.co.us/dc/Zoonosis/plague/index.html>\nContact CO-HELP (Colorado Health Education Line for the Public) at\n1-877-462-2911 to report a dead rodent or rabbit.\n--\nCommunicated by:\nSuzanne Kelley, M.Ed, MT (ASCP)\nPublic Information Officer/Client Relations Manager/State Training Coordinator\nColorado Department of Public Health and Environment\nLaboratory Services Division\n8100 Lowry Boulevard\nDenver, CO 80230\nUSA\nSimilar information communicated by ProMED-mail Rapporteur Joseph Dudley, Ph.D.\n[The causative bacterium _Yersinia pestis_ is transmitted to people\nthrough flea bite and direct contact with infected animals. Each\nrodent species is host to one or more species of fleas which, when\ninfected, are carriers. These fleas generally do not infest other\nanimals unless their natural hosts are unavailable. Rock squirrels\n(_Spermophilus variegates_) are closely related to California ground\nsquirrels and are the most significant plague host in Colorado. Their\nprincipal flea _Diamanus montanus_ is an aggressive parasite and will\nreadily bite other animals and people. Domestic cats and dogs can\nalso contract plague by infective fleas. They may carry infected\nfleas home to their owners or, especially with cats, serve as a\ndirect source of infection.\nIn humans, the incubation period (interval between exposure and\nappearance of symptoms) is usually 2-6 days. Typical symptoms include\nsudden onset of fever and chills, severe headache, muscle aches,\nnausea, vomiting and a general feeling of systemic illness. Extreme\npain and swelling in a lymph node draining the infection site is a\nsuggestive symptom of bubonic plague. (The swollen, painful node is\ncalled a 'bubo'). Other forms of the disease include septicemic\nillness with no bubo developing, and pneumonic plague in which the\nlungs are involved. The septicemic and pneumonic forms are the most\nserious. In addition, pneumonic plague can be spread by inhalation of\ninfective droplets expelled by another human or animal with plague\npneumonia.\nTreatment with antibiotics is effective during the early stages of\ndisease. If diagnosis and appropriate treatment are delayed,\nlife-threatening complications may follow. A doctor or hospital\nemergency room should be consulted as soon as symptoms appear and a\nhistory of exposure to potentially infected animals is very important\nin evaluating the risk from plague. Anti-plague vaccine is not\nreadily available.

Less commonly, people\nare infected by direct contact with blood from an infected animal or\nfrom cats which can become infected and transmit the disease. If untreated, the disease can enter\nthe bloodstream (septicemic plague) or lungs (pneumonic plague) which\nare severe, life-threatening complications.' In addition, pneumonic plague can be spread by inhalation of\ninfective droplets expelled by another human or animal with plague\npneumonia. It may be advantageous for researchers or people\nworking with plague-infected animals to be vaccinated but it is not\nindicated for the general public. Cats with plague become\nextremely ill and develop an illness very similar to people with high\nfever and swollen lymph nodes. With bubonic plague, individuals develop a large, swollen, painful\nlymph node called a bubo in the area of the flea bite, usually in the\ngroin or armpit,' he explained. ' Dogs are\ngenerally resistant to plague but can bring infected fleas into the\nhome. In Colorado, plague-infected\nanimals are most likely found in the foothills and mountains, he\nadded. People\nalso can be exposed through direct contact with infected rodents,\nrabbits and cats.' When an\ninfected rodent becomes sick and dies, its fleas can carry the\ninfection to other warm-blooded animals, including humans. Other forms of the disease include septicemic\nillness with no bubo developing, and pneumonic plague in which the\nlungs are involved. One human case was reported in conjunction with a previous outbreak of plague\namong urban populations of fox squirrels (_Scirus niger_) in Denver\nduring 1968. They may carry infected\nfleas home to their owners or, especially with cats, serve as a\ndirect source of infection. Rock squirrels\n(_Spermophilus variegates_) are closely related to California ground\nsquirrels and are the most significant plague host in Colorado.", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "plague"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2021-03-31 00:00:00", "2006-03-25 00:00:00", "2005-03-25 00:00:00", "2004-03-25 00:00:00", "1957-03-25 00:00:00", "1968-03-25 00:00:00", "2021-03-25 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Yersinia", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Denver", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Colorado", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "California", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Urbina", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "9285", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Plague, bubonic, fatal - Tanzania (Manyara)", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=9285", "date": "2007-03-28 19:00:03", "main_text": "PLAGUE, BUBONIC, FATAL - TANZANIA (MANYARA)\n*******************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\n<http://www.promedmail.org>\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\n<http://www.isid.org>\nDate: Wed 28 Mar 2007\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: IPP Media, Guardian report [edited]\n<http://www.ippmedia.com/ipp/guardian/2007/03/28/87237.html>\n\nAt least 8 people have died of plague in Endoji Village, Mbulu\nDistrict, in Manyara Region.

The swollen lymph node is\ncalled a 'bubo' which is very painful and can become suppurated as an open\nsore in advanced stage of infection;\n\n'* Septicaemic form of plague occurs when infection spreads directly\nthrough the bloodstream without evidence of a 'bubo'. More commonly\nadvanced stages of bubonic plague will result in the presence of _Y.\npestis_ in the blood. Septicaemic plague may result from flea bites and\nfrom direct contact with infective materials through cracks in the skin.\n\n'* Pneumonic form of plague is the most virulent and least common form of\nplague. Typically, pneumonic form is due to a secondary spread from\nadvanced infection of an initial bubonic form. Primary pneumonic plague\nresults from inhalation of aerosolized infective droplets and can be\ntransmitted from human to human without involvement of fleas or animals.\nUntreated pneumonic plague has a very high case fatality ratio.'\n\nPlague is endemic in many countries in Africa, in the former Soviet Union,\nthe Americas, and Asia. In 2003, 9 countries reported 2118 cases and 182\ndeaths. Of [the total number of] cases and deaths, 98.7 per cent and 98.9\nper cent, respectively, were reported from Africa.

Plague pneumonia occurs in a\nsecondary form related to bacteremic spread for the bubonic form or in its\nprimary form due to person-to-person spread.\nThe first signs of pneumonic plague are fever, headache, weakness, and\nrapidly developing pneumonia with shortness of breath, chest pain, cough,\nand sometimes bloody or watery sputum. The pneumonia progresses for 2 to 4\ndays and may cause respiratory failure and shock. Without early treatment,\npatients may die. To reduce the chance of death, antibiotics must be given\nwithin 24 hours of first symptoms. Streptomycin, gentamicin, the\ntetracyclines, and chloramphenicol are all effective against pneumonic\nplague.

[So\nfar] in 2006, a total of 13 human plague cases have been reported among\nresidents of 4 states: New Mexico (7 cases), Colorado (3), California (2),\nand Texas (1).\nThis is the largest number of cases reported in a single year in the USA\nsince 1994. Dates of illness onset ranged from 16 Feb to 14 Aug 2006; 2 (15\npercent) cases were fatal. The median age of patients was 43 years (range:\n13-79 years); 8 (62 percent) patients were female. Five (38 percent)\npatients had primary septicemic plague, and the remaining 8 (62 percent)\nhad bubonic plague. Two (15 percent) patients developed secondary plague\npneumonia, leading to administration of antibiotic prophylaxis to their\nhealth-care providers.\nThis report summarizes 6 of the 13 cases, highlighting the severity and\ndiverse clinical presentations of plague and underscoring the need for\nprompt diagnosis and treatment when plague is suspected.\nCase 1. On 17 Feb 2006, a man aged 39 years from Travis County, Texas, was\nhospitalized with a 1-day history of high fever, delirium, nausea, and\nvomiting. Although lymphadenopathy was not detected on the initial\nexamination, a prominent axillary bubo was noted later. Blood cultures\nyielded _Y. pestis_. The patient recovered after treatment with multiple\nantibiotics, including gentamicin, doxycycline, ciprofloxacin, and\nlevofloxacin. Before his illness, the patient had hunted rabbits in Lea\nCounty, New Mexico, and skinned the rabbit carcasses. Cultures from one of\nthe carcasses yielded _Y. pestis_ that was indistinguishable from the\nclinical isolates when subtyped by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE).\nCase 2. On 17 Apr 2006, a woman aged 28 years received the 1st diagnosis of\nplague in Los Angeles County, California, since 1984. The woman was\nhospitalized with fever, septic shock, and a painful right axillary\nswelling;blood cultures grew _Y. pestis_. She responded to treatment with\ngentamicin and levofloxacin. Although symptoms were compatible with bubonic\nplague, the diagnosis had not been suspected because the patient did not\nreport traveling outside her urban Los Angeles neighborhood. Later,\nhealth-care providers learned that the patient had handled raw meat from a\nrabbit that had been killed in Kern County, California, and transported to\nher home. An environmental investigation in Kern County revealed evidence\nof die-off among jackrabbits and cottontails; rabbit carcasses collected in\nthe area yielded _Y. pestis_. PFGE patterns of isolates from the patient\nand rabbits were indistinguishable. A total of 16 medical contacts and\nfamily members and friends who had visited the patient's residence received\nantibiotic prophylaxis.\nCase 3. On 17 May 2006, a woman aged 54 years from Bernalillo County, New\nMexico, went to a local urgent care center with a 4-day history of fever,\nsevere abdominal pain, and bloody stools. No lymphadenopathy was noted.\nWhile being evaluated, the patient began vomiting blood and experienced\nacute respiratory distress. She was transferred to a regional hospital but\ndied within a few hours of arrival. Blood and lung cultures obtained at\nautopsy yielded _Y. pestis_; however, no histologic evidence of plague\npneumonia was discovered. One of the patient's dogs and a rock squirrel\n(_Spermophilus variegatus_) that had been trapped by investigators on her\nproperty had serologic evidence of past infection with _Y. pestis_.\nCase 4. On 25 May 2006, a man aged 45 years from Santa Fe County, New\nMexico, went to a hospital emergency department with a 3-day history of\nnausea, vomiting, and fever to 104 degrees F (40 degrees C). Initial chest\nradiographs revealed right lower lobe infiltrates; he was admitted with a\ndiagnosis of pneumonia. The patient was treated with gentamicin but was not\nplaced in respiratory isolation. On hospital day 1, the patient required\nintubation for respiratory distress. On hospital day 2, blood cultures\ndrawn at admission yielded _Y. pestis_. The patient remained on mechanical\nventilation for 4 weeks and eventually recovered. At least 37 hospital\nworkers who had contact with the patient before he was intubated received\npostexposure prophylaxis with doxycycline. Both of the patient's dogs had\nserologic evidence of past _Y. pestis_ infection. _Y. pestis_ was isolated\nfrom fleas (_Anomiopsyllus nudatus_) combed from a woodrat (_Neotoma\nmicropus_) that was trapped by investigators on the patient's property.\nCase 5. On 9 Jul 2006, a man aged 30 years from La Plata County, Colorado,\nwent to a hospital emergency department with a 3-day history of fever,\nnausea, vomiting, and right inguinal lymphadenopathy. He was discharged\nhome without treatment. Three days later, the man returned and was\nhospitalized with sepsis and bilateral pulmonary infiltrates. Plague was\nconsidered immediately, and the patient was placed in respiratory\nisolation. He was treated with gentamicinand recovered. Five hospital\nworkers were administered doxycycline prophylaxis because of exposures\nbefore respiratory isolation had been initiated. Cultures of blood and a\nlymph node aspirate grew _Y. pestis_. One of the patient's dogs had\nserologic evidence of past _Y. pestis_ infection. _Y. pestis_ was recovered\nfrom fleas of 2 species (_Aetheca wagneri_ and _Pulex simulans_) collected\nnear the patient's home. A plague epizootic had been noted in the area, and\n4 other human plague cases have been reported from La Plata County since\nJul 2005.\nCase 6. On 18 Jul 2006, a woman aged 43 years from Torrance County, New\nMexico, went to a local clinic with a 1-day history of vomiting, diarrhea,\nabdominal pain, and fever. The patient reported a recent dog bite and was\ntreated for presumed cellulitis. The next day, the woman returned to the\nclinic because of worsening symptoms and pain in the left side of her\ngroin. She was transported by ambulance to the emergency department, where\ninguinal lymphadenopathy was noted and plague was suspected. She was\nadmitted to the hospital, placed in the intensive care unit, and\nadministered gentamicin and doxycycline. _Y. pestis_ was isolated from\nblood cultures. Despite treatment, she died on 22 Jul 2006. Animals trapped\non the patient's property, including 4 mice (_Peromyscus spp._) and 5 rock\nsquirrels, did not have laboratory evidence of infection with _Y. pestis_.\n[Reported by: Bertram-Sosa L, Jaso C, A Valadez A, et al]\nEditorial Note:\nThe natural reservoir of plague is wild rodents. Human infection usually is\nacquired through the bites of infected rodent fleas and has an incubation\nperiod of 1-6 days (1). Plague also can be contracted from handling\ninfected animals, especially rodents, lagomorphs (e.g., rabbits or hares),\nand domestic cats, or through close contact with patients with pneumonic\nplague. However, person-to-person transmission is extremely rare; the last\nsuch transmission in the USA was reported in 1925. During 1990-2005, a\ntotal of 107 cases of plague were reported in the USA (CDC, unpublished\ndata, 2006), a median of 7 cases per year. The increased plague activity in\n2006 is consistent with the predicted relationship between climate and the\nfrequency of human plague in the southwestern USA. 2 consecutive Feb-Mar\nperiods with high precipitation and an intervening cool summer predicts\nincreased cases of plague the next summer; this effect is thought to lead\nto increased reproduction and survival rates among rodents and fleas (2).\nThe principal forms of plague are bubonic, septicemic, and pneumonic (3).\nAll of these forms can be accompanied by fever and systemic manifestations\nof gram-negative sepsis. Bubonic plague is distinguished by the presence of\na bubo (i.e., one or more enlarged, tender, regional lymph node). Patients\nwith septicemic plague often have prominent gastrointestinal symptoms,\nincluding nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain (4), and patients\nwith pneumonic plague have dyspnea, chest pain, and a cough that can\nproduce bloody sputum. During 1990-2005, a total of 81 (76 percent) of 107\nplague cases in the USA were classified as primary bubonic plague, 19 (18\npercent) as primary septicemic plague, and 5 (5 percent) as primary\npneumonic plague; 2 (2 percent) were not classified (CDC, unpublished data,\n2006). Eleven (10 percent) cases were fatal. In 2006, 5 (38 percent) of the\n13 patients had primary septicemic plague, underscoring the need for\nclinicians to consider this diagnosis !\nin patients who do not have an obvious bubo. Septicemic and pneumonic\nplague progress rapidly and are usually fatal without prompt treatment;\nbubonic plague has a mortality rate of 50-60 percent if untreated.\nIn the USA, nearly all fatal plague cases are associated with delays in\ndiagnosis and treatment. In its early stages, plague is treatable with\nappropriate antibiotics. Health-care providers should consider a diagnosis\nof plague in persons who 1) have unexplained fever, suspected sepsis, or\npneumonia with or without lymphadenopathy or a classic bubo, and 2) live in\nor have traveled to a plague-endemic region (e.g., the western United\nStates) (3). When plague is suspected, appropriate antibiotic treatment\nshould be initiated immediately and not delayed for laboratory\nconfirmation. Drugs effective against plague include streptomycin and the\ntetracyclines. Although not approved by FDA for treatment of plague,\ngentamicin is more readily available than streptomycin and has been used\nsuccessfully (5). Fluoroquinolones are used empirically to treat critically\nill patients and have demonstrated activity against _Y. pestis_ but are not\nFDA-approved for this indication (6).\nThe majority of exposures to plague occur in the peridomestic environment\n(3); free-roaming pets that bring infected rodent fleas into the home have\nbeen suspected as a potential source of human infections. Persons residing\nin areas where plague is endemic should keep their dogs and cats free of\nfleas through regular use of flea treatments and by keeping them indoors.\nYear-round rodent control should be conducted, including rodent-proofing of\nstructures and eliminating food sources (e.g., pet food or garbage) and\nharborage (e.g., piles of wood or debris) in the peridomestic environment.\nPersons who participate in outdoor recreational activities, particularly\nrabbit hunting (7), in areas of epizootic plague activity also are at risk\nfor plague.\nPersonal protective measures include using insect repellents, wearing\nprotective clothing, and avoiding sick or dead animals. In areas of\nepizootic plague activity, public health officials should treat rodent\nhabitats with insecticides and should educate the public regarding plague\nprevention and control. Health-care providers and veterinarians should be\neducated regarding the manifestations and diagnosis of plague. Antibiotic\nprophylaxis might be indicated for close contacts (who come within 2 m) of\npatients with plague pneumonia (5). Appropriate respiratory droplet\nprecautions should be taken when treating patients with suspected plague\nwho have evidence of respiratory involvement (8).\n1.

The woman died early last week of bubonic\nplague, the bacterium of which many historians blame for the Black Death\nthat killed more than a million people in Europe during the mid-14th century.\nBubonic plague is usually transmitted to humans through the bites of\ninfected fleas but also can be transmitted through infected pets or other\nanimals. Symptoms of the plague include fever; painful, swollen lymph nodes\nin the groin, armpit and neck [these very painful lymph gland swellings are\ncalled buboes - Mod.LL]; and chills.\nDr. Paul Ettestad, the state's public health veterinarian, says Bernalillo\nCounty and other north-central New Mexico counties had increased plague\nactivity this year [2006]. Plague peaks during the warmer months, so\nEttestad says it's very important to avoid rodents and fleas now.\nFour people in New Mexico were infected with the plague in 2005. The last\ndeath from plague was 12 years ago, when a child in Rio Arriba County died\nof the disease.\n[Byline: Todd Dukart]\n--\nPablo Nart\n<pablo.nart@terra.es>\n[Bubonic plague is the classical form of _Yersinia pestis_ infection,\nrepresenting 85-90 percent of clinical presentations. Individuals present\nwith fever, chills, headache and the painful bubo. The process arises as a\nresult of a bite from an infected flea or by contamination of an open skin\nlesion. Local bacterial proliferation is sometimes evident (4-10 percent of\ncases) in the form of an abscess or ulcer at the site of infection (1).\nSymptoms of fever and malaise develop 2-6 days after exposure. The bubo\ngenerally occurs in the groin lymph nodes (90 percent), more commonly in\nthe femoral than inguinal nodes. Axillary and cervical lymph nodes may be\ninvolved reflective of the location of the fleabite. Usually heralded by\nvery severe pain within 6-8 hours after the onset of constitutional\nsymptoms, the bubo becomes evident within 24 hours. It has been said (1)\nthat the bubo may be so tender that semicomatose patients will posture in a\nway to attempt to decrease pressure on the swelling. The bubo may not be\nevident in the 1st few days of symptoms. Furthermore, involvement of deeper\nlymph nodes may not be visible. In these cases, abdominal pain suggestive\nof appendicitis, colitis, enteritis or cholecystitis may be described. In\nsuch cases, tenderness upon abdominal palpitation will be misleading and\nmay result in hazardous exploratory surgery and a potentially lethal delay\nin specific antimicrobial therapy.\nThe mechanism of transmission of plague from flea to mammalian host is as\nfollows:\nFleas become infected upon feeding on the blood of a rodent suffering from\nbacteremic infection. The bacteria are restricted to the alimentary tract\nof the flea, where they multiply in the midgut. The bacteria may form large\nbrown clumps that extend throughout the midgut, esophagus and\nproventriculus, a valve-like chamber situated between the esophagus and the\nmidgut. The clumps increase in mass over a few days until the\nproventriculus is blocked.\nThe 'blocked' flea then feeds on blood, but the meal is unable to pass into\nthe stomach. The flea continues to attempt to feed, but as it futilely\nsucks blood from the host, the blood meal, mixed with bacteria from the\nforegut, is regurgitated into the mammal. As many as 24 000 bacilli may be\ntransmitted in a single attempted feeding (2).\nDeaths from plague are generally related to spread of the bacilli from the\ninfected bubo into the blood stream with septicemia and dropping blood\npressure. The septicemia can spread to the lungs causing a secondary plague\npneumonia. It is this form that can spread from person-to-person.

It's likely others are infected with the potentially\ndeadly disease.\nA plea today to people heading to parks, beaches, or anywhere wild rodents\nroam: don't feed the animals. 'Just about everybody who comes here, they\nfeed them peanuts, cat food,' says a Morro Bay resident. He's seen people\nfeeding squirrels here all the time, but San Luis Obispo County health\nofficers hope that will change now that it could be life threatening.\n'That dead rodent could've passed it on via the flea to another rodent,'\nsays Dr. Frank Mazzoni, a family practitioner. The plague is an infectious\nbacterial disease spread by rodents and their fleas. Humans can contract\nthe disease if exposed to infected fleas or if they handle infected\nanimals, which includes feeding them.\nOther residents know all too well how dangerously close these rodents get.\n'I know the bravery of these things; it would be nothing for someone to get\nbit,' says a resident. 'They walk right up to you, no fear of man whatsoever.'\nHealth officers are not releasing the name of the Morro Bay park where the\ninfected squirrel was found, but they're warning everyone to avoid contact\nwith wild rodents and walking near their burrows. They also advise leaving\nyour pets at home during outings and warn that cats are highly susceptible\nto plague and can spread the disease to humans.\nDr. Mazzoni adds the discovery is reason for concern, but not panic. 'It\ncan be a relatively serious infection, but the risk of developing it is\nrelatively low.'\nSymptoms of plague include high fever, chills, headaches, and swollen\nglands. Individuals who develop these symptoms should seek immediate\nmedical attention. If caught early, plague is treatable with antibiotics;\nif untreated, it can be deadly.

The domestic\ncat and the white-tailed antelope squirrel both tested positive for\nplague this week, said Steve DeFeyter, director of environmental\nhealth for the Mesa County Health Department.\nThis new plague report comes a week after the plague was found in 2\nchipmunks on Colorado National Monument, resulting in the closing of\nthe Saddlehorn Campground. 'It is odd and puzzling to have plague\nactivity this early in the year,' DeFeyter said.\nApril is the earliest DeFeyter said he expected to see plague\nactivity. Rodents are usually in hibernation this time of year, he\nsaid. From what he has seen on the monument and in the Redlands area,\n'as far as I can tell, there's a lot of rodent activity going on,' he\nsaid.\n'I'm confident that the unseasonably warm weather, spring weather,\nthat we've had ... is a factor in us seeing activity this early,'\nDeFeyter said.\nIn 2005, the 1st case of plague was reported in May in a woman from\nGateway. It was later found in rodents and several cats.\nWith the recent plague-positive tests, 'I would consider the entire\nRedlands from Kingsview (Road) clear to the Gunnison River an area of\nconcern,' DeFeyter said.\nSaddlehorn Campground remains closed, and the National Park Service\nis in the process of assessing the plague risk in the area and doing\nfollow-up studies, DeFeyter said. 'They're concerned about it. We're\nconcerned about it,' DeFeyter said. 'It could be that there has been\nan outbreak of plague in the animals up there.'\nThe domestic cat that most recently tested positive for the plague is\nalive and being treated, he said. The cat apparently brought home the\nplague-infected squirrel after catching it, said Dr. Michael\nAduddell, director of the Health Department.\nIt is one of 2 cats in this particular Redlands household, and the\nother cat is also being tested for the plague. Those results are\npending. DeFeyter said, 'It wouldn't surprise me if it came out\npositive too.'\nPlague is transmitted through the bite of a flea infected with the\nplague bacteria. Ground squirrels, prairie dogs and rabbits are\ncommon hosts for infected fleas, the Health Department said.

Neighbors\nare being warned to avoid contact with dead animals and fleas from\nrodents and pets.\nAlthough human cases of the plague are uncommon, it is endemic to\nground squirrels and some rodents in parts of the Angeles National\nForest, Tehachapi, Lake Isabella and Frazier Park.\nThe last major urban epidemic in the USA occurred in Los Angeles in\n1924, resulting in dozens of deaths. On average, about 5 to 15 people\nget the plague annually around the country, mostly in rural areas,\naccording to the CDC. [Most of the cases are in the southwestern part\nof the USA in the states of Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico and Utah. - Mod.LL]\nBubonic plague is primarily transmitted through flea bites or direct\ncontact with infected open wounds or sores.\n[Byline: Michelle Keller]\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[Bubonic plague is the classical form of _Yersinia pestis_ infection,\nrepresenting 85-90 percent of clinical presentations. Individuals\npresent with fever, chills, headache and the painful bubo. The\nprocess arises as a result of a bite from an infected flea or by\ncontamination of an open skin lesion. Local bacterial proliferation\nis sometimes evident (4-10 percent of cases) in the form of an\nabscess or ulcer at the site of infection (1).\nSymptoms of fever and malaise develop 2-6 days after exposure. The\nbubo generally occurs in the groin lymph nodes (90 percent), more\ncommonly in the femoral than inguinal nodes. Axillary and cervical\nlymph nodes may be involved reflective of the location of the\nfleabite. Usually heralded by very severe pain within 6-8 hours after\nthe onset of constitutional symptoms, the bubo becomes evident within\n24 hours. It has been said (1) that the bubo may be so tender that\nsemicomatose patients will posture in a way to attempt to decrease\npressure on the swelling. The bubo may not be evident in the 1st few\ndays of symptoms. Furthermore, involvement of deeper lymph nodes may\nnot be visible. In these cases, abdominal pain suggestive of\nappendicitis, colitis, enteritis or cholecystitis may be described.\nIn such cases, tenderness upon abdominal palpitation will be\nmisleading and may result in hazardous exploratory surgery and a\npotentially lethal delay in specific antimicrobial therapy.\nThe mechanism of transmission of plague from flea to mammalian host\nis as follows:\nFleas become infected upon feeding on the blood of a rodent suffering\nfrom bacteremic infection. The bacteria are restricted to the\nalimentary tract of the flea, where they multiply in the midgut. The\nbacteria may form large brown clumps that extend throughout the\nmidgut, esophagus and proventriculus, a valve-like chamber situated\nbetween the esophagus and the midgut. The clumps increase in mass\nover a few days until the proventriculus is blocked.\nThe 'blocked' flea then feeds on blood, but the meal is unable to\npass into the stomach. The flea continues to attempt to feed, but as\nit futilely sucks blood from the host, the blood meal, mixed with\nbacteria from the foregut, is regurgitated into the mammal. As many\nas 24 000 bacilli may be transmitted in a single attempted feeding (2).\n1. McGovern, T. W. and Friedlander A. M. Plague. In Zajtchuk R. and\nBellamy R.F. (eds.)

On average, about 5 to 15 people\nget the plague annually around the country, mostly in rural areas,\naccording to the CDC.

A 4th cat, in neighboring Albany County,\nalso was diagnosed with plague.\n'Getting 4 of them in southern Wyoming in a short period of time is\nunusual,' said Ken Gage of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\n(CDC) in Fort Collins, Colorado. 'It's not cause for panic, or anything,\nbut it is cause for some concern.'\nIn many parts of the West, plague is endemic in the fleas infesting rodent\npopulations. The disease can jump to other animals, including humans, if\nthey come into contact with infected fleas. Researchers speculate that the\ninfected cats probably caught or ate infected rodents.\nHuman cases remain extremely rare. A southwest Colorado woman who caught\nplague from infected fleas is the region's only human case this year.\nWyoming has had just 5 human cases since 1978.\nBut state health officials also point out that they hadn't recorded any\nfeline cases in more than 20 years.\n'I think this is just going to be the tip of the iceberg,' Lopez said. 'And\nwhat really concerns me is these cases with cats right now really increase\nthe risk of human exposure.'\nThat's because handling infected animals is much riskier than simply being\nexposed to infected fleas. In the 5 recorded human cases since 1978 in\nWyoming, each had handled an infected animal, Gage said.\nAn infected cat might bring infected fleas into a home; it might also\ninfect people by biting, scratching or coughing. 'That's very, very\ndangerous, because the disease progresses very rapidly in that situation,'\nGage said.\nDr. Tracy Murphy, Wyoming's state epidemiologist, said rodent populations\nappeared to be up in Wyoming and much of the West this year, in part\nbecause of increased rain and snow during winter and spring. As rodent\npopulations increase, so does the chance that rodents will infect each\nother, spreading plague.\nHealth officials are warning people to avoid contact with rodents or with\nany sick or dead animals. If such contact is unavoidable, people should\nwear gloves and insect repellant. Pets or people showing plague symptoms --\nswollen glands, fever, chills, pain and extreme exhaustion -- should get\nimmediate medical attention.\n[Byline: Dan Lewerenz]\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[Plague is caused by _Yersinia pestis_ and transmitted most often by flea\nbites.\nWhen sylvatic outbreaks occur in rodent populations, domestic cats can be\ninfected by fleas on the rodents or by direct contact with infected rodent\ntissues -- as they chomp on squirrels or other rodents. The incubation\nperiod in cats may be short, a day or 2, and marked by a fever of up to\n41.5 C and lymphadenopathy. Typical buboes often occur in the head and\nneck, and can be mistaken for cat fight abscesses. Dogs are considered to\nbe less susceptible.\nBubonic plague, one form of the disease, is of zoonotic concern, as\nindividuals may contract disease from either infected fleas or contact with\npurulent discharges or blood from the cat. An even greater threat occurs\nwhen the disease in cats progresses to pneumonic plague. This has been\ndocumented in cats, including transmission to veterinarians and owners.\nAntibiotic treatment is effective in cats, but the threat of plague is only\none of many reasons that people should keep their pets free of fleas.\nThere are many good flea control products and methods of eliminating fleas\nfrom the animal as well as the yard. If an animal owner is having trouble\nwith fleas, a visit to the veterinarian may be in order. If an animal has a\nswelling, extra caution should be taken by the animal owner as well as the\nveterinarian. The swellings may rupture and expose the owner and/or the\nveterinarian to the plague agent. The disease is treatable with\nantibiotics, so a trip to the veterinarian may be in order. - Mod.TG]", "summary": "A ProMED-mail post\n<http://www.promedmail.org>\nProMED-mail, a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\n<http://www.isid.org>\n [Byline: Dan Lewerenz]\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n A local cat was diagnosed with plague Friday -- the 4th in southern Wyoming\nthis year -- and public health officials warned that people should take\nprecautions to protect their pets and themselves.\n Pets or people showing plague symptoms --\nswollen glands, fever, chills, pain and extreme exhaustion -- should get\nimmediate medical attention.\n \nDr. Tracy Murphy, Wyoming's state epidemiologist, said rodent populations\nappeared to be up in Wyoming and much of the West this year, in part\nbecause of increased rain and snow during winter and spring.

'The\nepidemiological data is still incomplete but we are sure there are at least\n61 deaths. The main problem is that due to panic, maybe two thirds of the\npopulation, ran away from the mine,' Eric Bertherat, head of the WHO team,\ntold reporters. 'There is a risk that some patients in [the] incubation\n[period] run away and maybe arrive in Kisangani. So it is very important to\ninform health care workers to alert them of the risk of admission of highly\ncontagious patients,' he said.\nKisangani is Congo's 3rd biggest city and a major trading center on the Congo\nRiver.\nPlague, which is spread between rodents by fleas, can also be transmitted to\npeople through infected rodent flea bites. It has a case-fatality rate of 50%\nto 60% in humans if not treated with antibiotics, WHO says. There are 3 main\nforms of plague in humans and the one suspected in the former Zaire is\npneumonic plague, WHO said. 'It is very important to quarantine, isolate\nthese people who are sick with pneumonic plague so that the transmission is\nbrought under control. If we can find the cases and treat them effectively,\nthis can be stopped,' said May Chu, a WHO expert.\nA 10-member WHO emergency team was leaving at the weekend with supplies of\nantibiotics to try to stem the outbreak and ensure that health workers in the\nregion isolate suspect cases. But the remote mine in mineral-rich Ituri,\nreportedly controlled by rebels, is difficult to reach and the team will\nrequire U.N. security clearances, officials said.\nCases are still occurring in the mine, where conditions are crowded and\nunsanitary, and 20 workers were admitted to health facilities in Zobia with\nsymptoms Wednesday [16 Feb 2005], he added. The diagnosis of plague had been\nverified through testing, WHO spokesman Dick Thompson said.\n[By Stephanie Nebehay]\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[As implied in the posting, the epidemic curve and analysis are\nneeded to discover the potential cause of the outbreak.

' As of Tue, 15 Feb 2005, WHO has received reports of 61 deaths from pneumonic\nplague in the district of Ituri, Oriental province, in the northern part of\nthe country. Many of the 7000 miners working in Zobia, north of the city of Kisangani,\nhave fled since the outbreak began 2 months ago, and could have spread the\nhighly contagious disease, the United Nations agency said. ' A 10-member WHO emergency team was leaving at the weekend with supplies of\nantibiotics to try to stem the outbreak and ensure that health workers in the\nregion isolate suspect cases.

According to the\nvictim's son, his father was hunting near Breckenridge. He was hospitalized\non Mon 6 Dec 2004.\nLocal health department Director Chris Nevin-Woods said the man had an open\nwound on one of his hands and probably was exposed while skinning an\ninfected rabbit that he had shot. She said more testing will be done on the\nrabbit for plague.\nThe case was the 1st plague-related death in Colorado since 1999 and the\nstate's 3rd case in 2004. Since the 1st human case was reported in 1957,\nColorado has reported 50 cases with 8 fatalities. The state averages 2\ncases per year.\nIn Colorado, plague-infected animals are most likely to be found in the\nfoothills and mountains. Most human cases occur in the summer and early\nfall months.\nJohn Pape, an epidemiologist who specializes in animal-related diseases\nwith the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment's Disease\nControl and Environmental Epidemiology Division, explained: 'When a rodent\nbecomes infected, the bacteria circulates in the blood. Fleas are infected\nwhile feeding on the animal and can transmit the infection to other\nwarm-blooded animals, including humans. People also can be exposed through\ncontact with blood from infected animals.\n'Plague is found throughout Colorado and cycles from year to year,' Pape\nsaid. 'This summer, we saw an increase in plague activity around the state,\nincluding 20 cats, which are highly susceptible to the disease.'\nAlthough plague is a serious illness, it can be readily treated with common\nantibiotics if recognized early. People will have a very sudden onset of\nhigh fever, fatigue and weakness, and a painful, swollen lymph node. The\nswollen lymph node is usually under the armpit, in the groin area, or in\nthe neck.\nPape said that people can greatly reduce their risk of becoming infected\nwith plague by taking a few simple precautions, including avoiding contact\nwith sick rodents and rabbits. Hunters should use gloves when cleaning and\ndressing rabbits and other game to avoid blood exposure. 'Do not feed\nrodents in picnic or campground areas, and never handle sick or dead\nrodents. Leave your pets at home when visiting rural areas,' Pape advised.\nState and local health officials regularly monitor plague-prone areas. If\nsick and dying rodents or other evidence of plague are observed, and a high\nrisk of transmission to humans is determined, affected areas may be\ntemporarily closed to protect the public and to implement control measures.\nIn recent years, Pueblo County bubonic plague outbreaks occurred in 2001\nnear Lake Pueblo and the southern edge of Pueblo West and, in 1998, near\nSouth Park Elementary School, according to Chieftain reports. Officials\nwere alerted when prairie dog colony die-offs were reported.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[Fleas become infected upon feeding on the blood of a rodent suffering from\nbacteremic infection. The bacteria are restricted to the alimentary tract\nof the flea, where they multiply in the midgut. The bacteria form large\nbrown clumps that extend throughout the midgut, esophagus and\nproventriculus, a valve-like chamber situated between the esophagus and the\nmidgut. The clumps increase in mass over a few days until the\nproventriculus is blocked.\nThe 'blocked' flea then feeds on blood, but the meal is unable to pass into\nthe stomach. The flea continues to attempt to feed, but as it futilely\nsucks blood from the host, the blood meal, mixed with bacteria from the\nforegut, is regurgitated into the mammal. As many as 24 000 bacilli may be\ntransmitted in a single attempted feeding (1).\nBlockage of the flea, and thus efficient transmission of bacteria, has been\nshown to be dependent on the _Y. pestis_ hemin storage locus (hms) (2).\nAlthough originally identified as being responsible for binding and storage\nof hemin (and Congo Red) in the outer membrane, the hms (+) phenotype\nappears to be required for the hydrophobic surface properties of the\nbacteria. _Y. pestis_ hms mutants are hydrophilic, not autoaggregating in\naqueous environments. The mutants are unable to colonize the proventriculus\nand produce blockage, although they do colonize the midgut and produce the\nlarge pigmented masses. Proventriculus blockage is temperature dependent\nwith temperature more than 30 C preventing the obstruction. The effect is\nnot due to differences in hms protein expression but rather\nposttranslational stability (3). Since one hms protein possesses enzyme\nactivity similar to enzymes vital to the production of polysaccharides for\nbiofilms, it is possible that biofilm, rather than the hms proteins\ndirectly, is responsible for the blockage (3).\n1.

A plague warning is in effect there.\n4 gray foxes that were trapped in Mount Charleston tested positive for\nplague. The disease is transmitted to people through a fleabite or direct\ncontact with an infected animal. Health officials say if you're visiting\nMount Charleston you should wear long-sleeved shirts and pants and stay\naway from wild animals.\nResidents who live in the area are already taking precautions. Christopher\nOlson, who lives on Mount Charleston, said, 'I have heard that the rodents\nhere do have some type of infection, so we told the kids to stay away from\nthe mice and whether they're dead or alive.'\nPlague can be transmitted to humans through a fleabite or direct contact\nwith an infected animal. The symptoms are swollen glands, fever, chills,\nheadache, and extreme exhaustion. The Clark County Health District advises\nanyone who visits the Mount Charleston area to avoid contact with rodents\nand wild animals.\nHealth officials say if you take your pet up to Mount Charleston, don't let\nthem wander and keep a flea collar on them. If a human were to contract it,\nif it's detected early, plague responds well to antibiotics.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[The introduction of plague into the US via California about a century ago\nled to the spread of the infection eastward across about halfway across the\ncountry. It did not reach the east coast. The infection continues to be\nendemic in rodents in the southwestern parts of the US including Colorado,\nNew Mexico, Arizona, and California.\n_Yersinia pestis_ is the agent responsible for bubonic plague. Endemic foci\nof sylvatic plague exist in the western USA and several other areas of the\nworld. Fleas are the vectors primarily responsible for spreading _Y.\npestis_ from these reservoirs, although contact with infected rabbit\ncarcasses has been a significant source of infection for man during the\nwinter. Throughout history, outbreaks of human plague involving rats in\ndensely populated agricultural or urban areas have occurred when rats\ncommingled with infected sylvatic rodents.\nPrairie dogs are often considered sentinel animals because of their\nsusceptibility to the organism. However, cats are extremely sensitive as\nwell and may be the source that exposes humans. The swollen lymph glands\nmay be mistaken for normal abscesses where a cat has been bitten. If one of\nthese buboes (swollen lymph glands) ruptures, it may be the source of\nbacteria to people associated with the cat.\nIn humans, the bubo in the groin or under the arm is most common. However,\nthere may also be a systemic infection involving the lungs and,\nconsequently, transmission between people is possible. Pneumonic plague can\nbe recognized by the bloody sputum coughed up by patients that are TB-negative.\nThe flea vector of _Y. pestis_ would rather feed on its usual host, but in\nthe absence of a warm-blooded prairie dog, it may attempt to feed on a\nhuman. Infection in the flea causes obstruction in the gastrointestinal\ntract of the flea, which regurgitates the bacilli while attempting to\nfeed.

Throughout history, outbreaks of human plague involving rats in\ndensely populated agricultural or urban areas have occurred when rats\ncommingled with infected sylvatic rodents. The flea vector of _Y. pestis_ would rather feed on its usual host, but in\nthe absence of a warm-blooded prairie dog, it may attempt to feed on a\nhuman. Infection in the flea causes obstruction in the gastrointestinal\ntract of the flea, which regurgitates the bacilli while attempting to\nfeed. [The introduction of plague into the US via California about a century ago\nled to the spread of the infection eastward across about halfway across the\ncountry. If one of\nthese buboes (swollen lymph glands) ruptures, it may be the source of\nbacteria to people associated with the cat. There are\na number of excellent products to combat fleas on your pets available from\nyour veterinarian; however, some such products may be toxic to cats. Pet\nowners should consult their veterinarian about anti-flea products and\nshould thoroughly read the label of the product. The Clark County Health District advises\nanyone who visits the Mount Charleston area to avoid contact with rodents\nand wild animals. Endemic foci\nof sylvatic plague exist in the western USA and several other areas of the\nworld. However,\nthere may also be a systemic infection involving the lungs and,\nconsequently, transmission between people is possible. \n4 gray foxes that were trapped in Mount Charleston tested positive for\nplague.

In addition, the patient's\n47-year-old wife has symptoms consistent with bubonic plague and laboratory\ntest results are pending.\nBoth patients reside in Santa Fe County, New Mexico - in an area that is\nknown to be an enzootic focus for plague. The source of these patients'\ninfections is suspected to be rodents and rodent fleas near their home, as\na woodrat that was found in the patients' back yard this past July tested\npositive for plague. Fleas taken from this woodrat also tested positive\nfor plague.\nThis couple traveled to New York City on November 1, 2002 and both\ndeveloped a flu-like illness on November 3rd. As symptoms continued to\nworsen, they were admitted to a hospital on November 5th and on examination\nboth had fever and swollen, tender inguinal lymph nodes ('buboes'). A\nblood culture on the male patient tested positive at the NYC DOHMH's Public\nHealth Laboratory this evening for Yersinia pestis by both polymerase chain\nreaction and direct fluorescent antibody testing. Further confirmatory\ntests will be performed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\n(CDC). Laboratory tests on the female patient are still pending, but her\nclinical presentation is consistent with bubonic plague. Both patients are\nbeing treated with aminoglycosides and doxycycline. The 53-year-old male,\nwho is also diabetic, is in critical condition with a secondary septicemia\nand multi-system failure; the 47-year-old female is stable.\nAll epidemiologic evidence suggests that these infections were naturally\nacquired in New Mexico. Although the exact source of exposure for these\npatients is not yet known, most human plague cases are due to bites from\nplague-infected fleas around the home. The usual incubation period for\nplague is between 2 to 7 days. As these patients became ill within 48\nhours of their arrival in New York City, their exposure occurred in New\nMexico. Since Y. pestis was isolated recently from fleas on their property,\nthis is the location where they probably were infected. The New Mexico\nDepartment of Health and the CDC are currently conducting an environmental\ninvestigation in the area around these patients' home to assess potential\nsources of exposure.\nAs neither patient had symptoms or radiographic evidence of pneumonia,\nantibiotic prophylaxis has not been recommended for any hospital or social\ncontacts. Laboratory staff handling specimens from these patients have\nbeen instructed to follow Biosafety Level 2 precautions.\nNaturally occurring plague is a disease primarily affecting rodents, and\ntransmission between rodents is via infected fleas. In the United States,\nbubonic plague is transmitted to humans through the bites of infected\nfleas; bubonic plague is not transmitted person to person. Pneumonic\nplague is transmitted after plague bacilli are inhaled following direct\ncontact with infected animals, including rodents, wildlife and pets (cats\nand dogs) or via droplet transmission from a patient with pneumonic plague.\nBubonic plague symptoms in humans include fever; painful swollen lymph\nnodes in the groin, armpit or neck areas; chills; and headache, vomiting,\nand diarrhea. Patients may develop secondary septicemic plague or pneumonic\nplague; pneumonic plague can be spread person-to-person. With prompt\ndiagnosis and appropriate antibiotic treatment and supportive care, most\npatients with bubonic plague survive.\nHuman plague has been reported most often from the four western states of\nArizona, California, Colorado and New Mexico. Wild rodents, especially\nground squirrels and prairie dogs, are the natural reservoir for the plague\nbacterium. Since January 1980, there have been 272 cases of plague\nreported in the United States; the overwhelming majority of cases were\nbubonic plague. Of these, 143 (53%) were acquired in New Mexico. Plague\nis not enzootic in the eastern United States; there has not been a case of\nplague in New York City in at least 100 years.\nUseful websites for additional information on plague include:\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention\n\nJohns Hopkins Center for Civilian Biodefense Strategies\n\nCenter for Infectious Disease Research and Policy\n\n--\nNew York City Department of Health & Mental Hygiene\n<http://www.ci.nyc.ny.us/html/doh/>\n******\n[2]\nDate: 6 Nov 2002\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: New York City Department of Health & Mental Hygiene Press Release\n<http://www.ci.nyc.ny.us/html/doh/html/public/press02/pr931106.html>\n\nAn Individual who travelled to New York City from Sante Fe, New Mexico is\npreliminarily positive for plague\nThis Form Of Plague Is Not Spread From Person-To-Person\n------------------------------------------------\nThe New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) has\npresumptively diagnosed bubonic plague in a 53-year-old male resident of\nSanta Fe, New Mexico who was visiting New York City. In addition, the\npatient's 47-year-old wife has similar symptoms and laboratory test results\nare pending. He is currently hospitalized in critical condition; she is in\nstable condition. The couple arrived in New York City from New Mexico on\nNovember 1, 2002 and went to the hospital after two days of flu-like\nsymptoms, high fevers and swollen lymph nodes. The usual incubation period\nfor plague is between two to seven days. As these patients became ill\nwithin 48 hours of their arrival in New York City, their exposure occurred\nin New Mexico. These individuals live in a plague-endemic area and all\nepidemiologic evidence indicates that the source of their infection is\nrodents and rodent fleas in the vicinity of their home in which plague was\nconfirmed earlier this summer. Bubonic plague is not spread from\nperson-to-person. An investigation of the patients' home is being conducted\nby the New Mexico Department of Health (NMDOH) and the U.S. Centers for\nDisease Control and Prevention (CDC).\nBubonic plague is a bacterial disease of rodents transmitted to humans\nthrough the bites of infected fleas. Pneumonic plague, a more serious form\nof the disease occurs when plague bacteria are inhaled after direct contact\nwith infected animals including rodents, wildlife and pets. Most people\nbecome ill two to seven days after being infected with the plague bacteria.\nPlague symptoms in humans include fever; painful swollen lymph nodes in the\ngroin, armpit or neck areas; chills; and sometimes headache, vomiting, and\ndiarrhea. With prompt diagnosis and appropriate antibiotic treatment, the\nfatality rate in people can be greatly reduced.\nCDC reports that there are 10-15 cases of plague per year, mostly rural\nareas in New Mexico, Colorado, Arizona, California, Oregon and Nevada. The\nillness occurs in areas where infection of wild animals is common,\nincluding parts of the American Southwest. Wild rodents, especially ground\nsquirrels and prairie dogs, are the natural reservoir for the plague\nbacterium. Rats, other wild rodents, cats and dogs can become infected with\nplague, and the disease is occasionally transmitted to people by these\nanimals or their infected fleas. Most patients with plague can be\nsuccessfully treated with antibiotics, particularly if treated in the early\nstages of the disease. If detected in its early stages, plague is treatable\nwith antibiotics. Plague is treatable by a 10-day course of antibiotics.\nHowever, approximately 10% of patients who become ill from plague die.\nThe hospital reported the case to the DOHMH on Tuesday, November 5. Within\nhours of this report, specimens were sent to DOHMH's Public Health\nLaboratories and presumptive positive results were received this evening.\nThis case underscores the critical link between hospitals and physicians\nwith the DOHMH to control and prevent diseases in New York City. The DOHMH\nis working closely with CDC, NMDOH and the New York State Department of\nHealth in this investigation.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[In our earlier report we noted the lack of mention of bubos with concern\nfor a possible plague pneumonia picture.

As the former State Public Health\nVeterinarian in New Mexico, and author of several papers on cats, plague,\nand transmission to people, I was able to gain a lot of experience in this\narea.\nWhenever the risk of cats acquiring plague is mentioned, flea control is\nalways emphasized. Our studies in New Mexico indicated that cats probably\ndo not primarily acquire plague by the bite of a flea. In some unpublished\nresearch we did, having seen fleas on your cat or lack of use of flea\ncontrol did not increase the probability of a cat getting plague, in\ncomparison to other cats in the household and neighborhood that did not\ncome down with the disease. Evidence in the infected cats of a flea bite,\nsuch as an abscess on the leg or back, or bubo in those areas, was\nrelatively rare. In addition, the type of fleas that spread plague in the\nwestern U.S. are rodent fleas, not cat fleas, and as such don't spend a\nwhole lot of time on cats compared to rodents.\nRather, the primary risk\nfactor was hunting behavior. This fits with the predominant symptom in cat\nplague cases of submandibular lymphadenopathy (with those lymph nodes\ndraining the mouth/head area). Of course, we can't be sure whether the\ncats are becoming infected by direct inoculation of the organism in the\ninfected rodents into the mouth, or by infected fleas from the rodents\nbiting the cat in the face while the cat is eating them. Lesions inside\nthe mouth and tongue, including abscesses, were also reported, perhaps\nsupporting the direct inoculation rather than flea bites to the face.\nThus, although flea control is important and should be recommended, in\nregards to reducing cats getting plague, preventing hunting behavior is\nmore important, and of course, can be difficult to do with outdoor cats. I\nbelieve the educational materials on plague need to emphasize the\nimportance, if you have an outdoor hunting cat, of prompt veterinary\ndiagnosis of any illness, including just the down and draggy febrile cat\n(which could have septicemic plague), but particularly the cat with fever\nand a bubo.\nIt's been decades since we've had person-to-person spread of\nprimary pneumonic plague in the U.S. Thus these days a person's primary\nrisk factor for developing primary pneumonic plague is from an undiagnosed\ncat, whose symptoms have progressed far enough that it's pneumonic. This\nrarely happens any more with people, who usually get hospitalized before\nthey develop plague pneumonia. The case count of people developing\npneumonic plague from cats, or from handling cats with draining plague\nabscesses or buboes, keeps increasing, because of a lack of early diagnosis\nof plague-infected cats.\nPeople also can catch plague directly from their\nclinically ill plague-infected dogs, which few people are aware of.\nFortunately, most dogs infected with plague develop subclinical infections,\nbut some clinical illnesses with the capability of being transmitted to\npeople have occurred .\nI think these particular aspects too often are overlooked.\n--\nMillicent Eidson, MA, DVM, Dipl.

These deaths are among the five cases reported by the Centers\nfor Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in 1996.\nAn 18-year-old man from Flagstaff, Arizona was bitten by fleas while walking\nthrough a colony of prairie dogs in the northeast part of the state.\nThe same month, a 16-year-old Colorado girl contracted the plague. It is\nreported that she lived near an area where many prairie dogs had died. The\nCDC believes she got the plague from her cat, who became infected from the\nprairie dogs. Cats can get infected from fleas or rodents and pass it on\nwhen they bite, scratch or lick humans.\nHuman plague can be treated with antibiotics if treatment is begun early\nenough. There have been 390 of human plague in the United States since\n1947, resulting in 60 deaths.

Lake)\n\nAll-in-all, the program was excellent.\nShortcomings: overdramatization\nof the risks and the exposures of the field investigators. Not to\ndenigrate this in the least -- it's just TV's way of keeping you on\nthe channel. Also, there were a rather select group of expert participants.\nAlso, no mention of the technology (ie. this mailing list) that helps\nprovide support for emerging diseases.\nStrengths: Showing the horrible medical conditions in many (African)\nregions. The pitiful facilities, lack of clean water, drugs, and\ntransportation. Also a very insightful presentation of the cultural\nrole of sex workers in Africa and India -- and the very difficult\ntask of changing these cultural norms.\nWished they would have: Shown more detail of the laboratory work\nrequired to support viral identification. Also a more graphic\nvisualization of the impact of these diseases. Even with the numbers\nquoted, it is difficult to visualize in one's mind the severity of\nthe impacts.\nAgain: Solid facts, excellent presentation of the brave persons involved,\nand no casting of US social standards into the rest of the world.\n--\nRobin Lake\nEnvironmental Modeling Inc.\nrbl@po.cwru.edu\n---------------------------\n[2]\nDate: Mon, 21 Apr 1997 17:09:13 -0400\nFrom: Alexandra Sevilla <alexs@wri.org>\n\nClassically, the movie is not as good as the book....\nThe Coming Plague documentary so far has given viewers glossy and\nsexy profiles of a few of the most eminent doctors/epidemiologists in the\nfield and a noble, but ultimately thin, overview of the AIDS pandemic.\nUnfortunately, the program lacks the pacing of Laurie Garrett's great\nbook. Too often it seems to switch gears from disease to disease, time\nperiod to time period, location to location, without building the case of the\nsociological, political, historical, environmental, and economic factors in\nthe emergence and resurgence of infectious diseases which made\nGarrett's book much more important than a collection of outbreak\nnarratives.\n[I believe that will be covered in Part 2 - Mod.JW]\nIt also is very thin on science in terms of explaining what\nvirus are, how they infect humans, jump species, treatments....\nPositively, it is a fascinating program to those who are not entirely\nfamiliar with the impacts and history of infectious diseases (or the book).\nThe program does do an outstanding job packaging information into\nhighly understandble concepts for people who know nothing of the\nscience and epidemiology of infectious diseases. It would make an\nexcellent introductory education tool and promotes awareness\neffectively.\nI watched the program with several people who are not\nfamiliar with the subject matter at all and each felt it was an excellent\nproduction and really shed light on issues that they were not remotely\naware of.\nI look forward to seeing the next installment.\n--\nAlexandra Sevilla\nWorld Resources Institute\nalexs@wri.org\n-------------------------\n[3]\nFrom: EdRegis@aol.com\nDate: Mon, 21 Apr 1997 21:47:18 -0400 (EDT)\n\nI thought the first two hours were remarkably error-free (other than for\ndating the Kikwit outbreak in 1994), balanced, and objective. Especially\ninstructive was Joe McCormick's comment about hemorrhagic fever viruses such\nas Ebola:\n'These hemorrhagic viruses are scary enough without making them into science\nfiction. Doctors don't need space suits to treat patients or space capsules\nto move them about.

A public awareness\nprogramme has been initiated in Santa Catarina.\nContact with the venom causes a burning sensation and spotting on the\nskin. If left untreated, it can lead to high fever, bleeding from the\nnose and ears, kidney failure and death, said Luis Dalla Costa, a doctor\nin the Santa Catarina city of Chapeco. Since December, 20 people have\nbeen treated in hospital after contact with the caterpillars, Costa said.\nIn most cases, unsuspecting victims grab a tree trunk or another\nobject where the caterpillar rests. But authorities are concerned that\nchildren, attracted by the greenish worm-like creature, might become\ncurious and want to feel it. It grows to a length of two inches (5 cms).\nIt is appears every year from December to March. The pupal and adult\nforms are harmless.\nOnce just a rural phenomenon, the caterpillars this year are migrating\ninto urban centres, turning up on porches and in the fruit trees of\nsuburban gardens. This apparent increase is being blamed on the excessive\nuse of toxic fertiliser killing the caterpillars' normal predators.\nDavid W.
