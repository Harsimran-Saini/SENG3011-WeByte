The disease is called brucellosis, and the Department of Fish and Game recently detected cases in the Mulchatna Caribou herd; they discovered the 1st potential case about a year ago.\n\nBiologists typically find the bacteria brucella, which cause brucellosis, in caribou herds to the north, not in in the southwestern part of the state. The disease is caused by the bacteria brucella; it can be lethal to caribou, and it can also lead to miscarriages.\n\n'This was the 1st time we were having actual cases in the Mulchatna herd,' Dr Kimberlee Beckmen, a wildlife veterinarian for Fish and Game, said. 'It's such a low level in caribou throughout Alaska, we don't pick it up very often. Right now, we know there's an increase, because more caribou in the herd have brucella or are showing antibodies.'\n\nBiologists have detected those antibodies during routine sampling. They also found the bacteria in 2 dead caribou and have observed swollen knees and enlarged scrotums in others. A common sign of brucellosis in caribou is swelling in the knees, where most of the bacteria are stored.\n\nIn people, brucellosis can cause a high fever, similar to the flu. Beckman said people can stay safe by handling raw meat carefully and cooking it properly [People should wash their hands after handling raw meat. - Mod.TG]. 'Freezing doesn't kill the bacteria,' she said. 'Smoking and drying are not extremely effective because there can be some pathogens and parasites surviving those (temperatures). So, it's really important to cook the meat to 165 F [74 C].' After handling game meat, wash your hands thoroughly, and clean utensils with hot, soapy water.\n\nBiologists typically find brucella in caribou to the north, in the Western Arctic, Teshekpuk and Central Arctic herds. There aren't enough samples from the Mulchatna herds to determine how many cases are present. Beckman advises those who harvest Mulchatna caribou to report any signs of the disease to the state.\n\n[byline: Tyler Thompson]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n['Brucellosis is a highly contagious disease caused by bacteria called _Brucella suis_ type 4 in caribou and reindeer. It is spread in the afterbirth and fluids during calving. _Brucella suis_ occurs naturally in caribou and reindeer and has also been seen in muskoxen and moose.\n\n'Brucella is most common in the 4 arctic caribou herds (Western Arctic, Teshekpuk, Central Arctic, and Porcupine herds). Predators, such as bears and wolves, are exposed when they feed on infected caribou. Humans can be infected by _Brucella suis_ type 4.\n\n'Animals may appear healthy and not show any signs of disease. Brucellosis usually affects the reproductive organs and leg joints. Often, animals will have swollen leg joints causing limping or lameness (especially in the front legs).\n\n'When butchering, you may find pus-filled swellings under the skin, in the meat, or in the internal organs. The testicles or womb may be swollen.\n\n'In people, brucellosis often causes a high fever that frequently comes and goes. [Sometimes, the disease is called relapsing fever, because the fever occurs and vanishes then reappears very soon afterwards. - Mod.TG].\n\n'Humans can get brucellosis through exposure to contaminated parts. The bacteria can enter through cuts or scratches in your skin or through your eyes, nose, or mouth. You can also get brucellosis by eating infected meat not fully cooked.\n\n'Do not cut into diseased parts. Do not spill fluid from the womb onto the meat. Use extreme care when handling any fetal membranes or aborted tissues. Wash your hands, knives, and clothes with hot soapy water after handling the animal.\n\n'Report any animals suspected of having brucellosis to your nearest ADF&G biologist. https://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=contacts.main.\n\n'Meat from animals with brucellosis should be thoroughly cooked. Freezing, smoking, drying, and pickling do not kill Brucella. Raw bone marrow from infected animals can contain the bacteria.

Aside from one person with clinical symptoms, all the others did not have clinical symptoms and were not ill.\n\nThe official website stated that this event happened from 24 Jul-20 Aug 2019. China Animal Husbandry Industry Co., Ltd.'s biopharmaceutical plant produces brucellosis vaccine for animal use. Because disinfectant [used in the fermenter] had expired, exhaust gas containing vaccine strain was insufficiently sterilized. As the Lanzhou Veterinary Institute is downwind from the biopharmaceutical plant, [the exhaust gas] was inhaled or made contact with mucous membranes causing the positive brucellosis antibodies event.\n\nInvestigation found that from July to August 2019, winds in Lanzhou are mainly southeastern at windspeed level 2 to 3. Waste gases containing pathogen released by the biopharmaceutical plant were aerosolized and carried by the wind to a limited distance. Exposure levels were very low. So there would not be large numbers of people with positive antibodies.

Brucellosis also causes decreased milk production, weight loss, abortion, and infertility in cattle. For these reasons, beginning in the mid-1950s, great efforts were made to eliminate the disease from all livestock within the United States. While these efforts were successful at eliminating transmission within cattle nation-wide, sporadic transmission from wildlife to cattle in and around the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem has been on the increase. Brucellosis can result in serious financial burdens to cattle producers, potentially resulting in quarantine of a herd, increased testing and vaccination costs, and possible difficulty in trade with other states and countries.\n\nAlthough the disease can cause abortions in elk, measurable population effects on population size or trend due to brucellosis have not been documented. However, the potential for transmission to livestock results in decreased acceptance of elk on private property which, in many areas, constitutes a large proportion of elk winter range. Historically, rates of exposure in elk (measured by blood tests) have been very low (below 2 percent in the early 1990's) and limited in distribution. Recent research and surveillance efforts have indicated that the prevalence and geographical distribution of the disease in elk is likely increasing. Brucellosis now exists in elk populations outside of the Greater Yellowstone Area.

The ranch, which is inside Montana's brucellosis Designated Surveillance Area (DSA), is quarantined as they undergo an epidemiological investigation. No other animals were found infected on the ranch.\n\nAccording to Montana Department of Livestock, previous brucellosis cases show animals picked up the disease from infected elk.\n\nMontana Department of Livestock Veterinarian Dr. Marty Zaluski says there are benefits in spotting animals infected with brucellosis in the beginning stages.\n\nSince the DSA was established in 2010, the state is able to maintain its brucellosis Class Free Status, according to Montana Department of Livestock.\n\n'It can be concerning when a brucellosis affected herd is discovered, but our DSA producers and veterinarians should be commended for their efforts and compliance with regulations,' Zaluski said in the press release. 'A high rate of testing, much of it voluntary, is the primary reason we continue to find affected herds rapidly, which not only minimizes the impact on that producer but protects our state and our trading partners.'\n\n[Byline: Posie Buffington]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[This article is referring to the bacterium _Brucella abortus_. The infectious disease can affect humans, wildlife and domestic animals, including dogs. Historically, cattle have been the primary carriers but as states move more into close interaction with wildlife, such as the Greater Yellowstone area, or with managing cervids and buffalo, the carrier in a particular area may not necessarily be cattle. This article states that it may be the elk. Other wildlife carriers include bison, reindeer, caribou and feral swine.\n\nLarge animals, especially elk and bison may have no obvious signs of the disease. The brucella bacterium collects in the lymphatic system, the udder and the reproductive tract. Abortion is a sign of the disease. Other signs in animals may include retained placenta, swollen testicles, reduced pregnancy rates, decreased milk production and swollen, painful joints.\n\nIn humans this disease is known by several names, including Malta fever, Mediterranean fever and undulant fever. Humans may acquire the disease through assisting an infected animal in the birthing process, examining an aborted fetus without protection, drinking unpasteurized milk or other dairy products, through an open wound, or even intact skin, or a slash of infected body fluids into the eyes, nose or mouth. Slaughter workers, and veterinarians are at risk because of the nature of their jobs. Consumption of infected raw meat by humans may also be a source of infection, however if the meat is properly cooked it does not present a disease risk.\n\nWhen a person is infected clinical signs and symptoms may include, fever, body aches, anorexia, lethargy, weakness, fatigue as well as swollen lymph nodes and possibly enlargement of the spleen and liver. Symptoms may develop over several weeks or months, or even immediately. Joints, bones, and especially the spine may be painful. Other joints such as ankles, hips, knees and shoulders may be swollen, warm, and painful.\n\nThe DSA is so named because this particular area is no stranger to this disease and this area is subject to additional surveillance. However, they are catching cases earlier in cattle and able to deal with fewer animals having the disease and spreading. It's nice to see the producers and the veterinarians of the state office working closing to contain this disease.

Five people were placed under investigation.\n\nAs well as being packed into tight, poorly aired pens, around half the dogs were found to be infected with _Brucella canis_, a very infectious dog bug transmissible to man.\n\nAlthough it held almost 900 animals, the facility was only authorised for a maximum of 61.\n\nBrucellosis [in man] is also known as undulant fever, Malta fever, and Mediterranean fever.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[_Brucella canis_ is a Gram-negative coccobacillus in the family Brucellaceae (class Alphaproteobacteria). Other _Brucella_ species occasionally associated with disease in dogs include _B. abortus_, _B. melitensis_, and _B. suis_.\n\n_B. canis_ is an important cause of reproductive failure in dogs, especially in kennels. Infections can result in abortions and stillbirths in bitches, and epididymitis, prostatitis, orchitis, and sperm abnormalities in males. Although spayed or neutered dogs do not have reproductive signs, they occasionally develop other conditions such as ocular disease and discospondylitis. _B. canis_ may persist in an animal even after antibiotic treatment. In kennels, infected dogs are often euthanized to prevent them from infecting other dogs or people. Canine brucellosis is sometimes difficult to diagnose with the currently available tests.\n\nThe importance of _B. canis_ as a cause of human illness is still unclear. Few clinical cases have been reported in people, and most have been mild. However, human infections with this organism may be underdiagnosed, as the symptoms are nonspecific, diagnostic suspicion among physicians is low, and obtaining a definitive diagnosis may be difficult. One clinical case was caused by the M-strain of _B. canis_, a laboratory strain that has reduced virulence and is used as an antigen for serological testing.\n\nDogs are thought to be the only significant hosts for _B. canis_ among domesticated animals. Antibodies to this organism have been detected in cats in South America, but bacteria were not recovered. Antibodies to _B canis_ have also been reported occasionally in wild canids.\n\n_B. canis_ appears to be widely distributed. It has been reported in North, Central, and South America and parts of Asia, Africa, and Europe. New Zealand and Australia appear to be free of _B. canis_; however, Australia has reported some _B. suis_ infections in dogs, mainly in animals used to hunt feral pigs.\n\nThe above, and additional exhaustive information, is available in the 2018 fact sheet 'Brucellosis: Canine' by Anna Rovid Spickler, at http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/brucellosis_canis.pdf.\n\nAccording to information published in the journal of the Dutch Veterinary Society in January 2019, several dogs originating in east Europe had been found there infected by _B. canis_ since 2016.

Other species of _Brucella_ that may be found in cattle include _B. melitensis_, which can be important in cattle in some countries, _B. suis_ and _B. canis_.\n\n'Cattle, American bison (_Bison bison_), water buffalo, African buffalo, and elk are known reservoir hosts for _B. abortus_.\n\n'Bovine brucellosis is often introduced into a herd in an infected animal. _B. abortus_-free herds should not be allowed to contact potentially infected animals or contaminated environments, such as those where animals recently aborted. Herd replacements should be seronegative and should come from brucellosis-free regions or herds. If such herds are unavailable in an endemic area, vaccinated calves or nonpregnant heifers are considered to be the safest option. Herd additions should be quarantined and re-tested before being released into the herd. Some infected animals, especially animals latently infected when they were young, might not be detected by either serology or culture. Semen for artificial insemination should only be collected from _Brucella_-negative animals that are tested regularly.\n\n'In an infected herd, the placenta, any abortion products, and contaminated bedding should be removed promptly and destroyed. Where feasible, areas exposed to infected animals and their discharges should be cleaned and disinfected. The offspring of infected animals should not be used as herd replacements due to the risk that they may be latently infected. _B. abortus_ can be eradicated from a herd by test and removal procedures, or by depopulation. Programs to eradicate this organism from a country also include movement controls on infected herds, surveillance, and tracing of infected animals.\n\n'Vaccines can help control the clinical signs in infected herds. They have also been used to reduce the prevalence of _B. abortus_ during eradication campaigns. Strain 19 and RB51 vaccines are generally used, although other vaccines (such as the strain 82 and 75/79-AB _B. abortus_ vaccines in Russia, and the S2 _B. suis_ vaccine in China) are employed in some areas.\n\n'_B. abortus_ is zoonotic. The live attenuated organisms in strain 19 and RB51 vaccines are also pathogenic for humans; however, RB51 appears to be safer than strain 19.'\n\nSource: Spickler, Anna Rovid. 2018.

MMWR. 2020; 69(15): 482-483. doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm6915a4.\n\nIn December 2018, the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture (PDA) and Pennsylvania Department of Health (PADOH) were notified of a New York patient with brucellosis caused by infection with _Brucella abortus_ RB51, the live attenuated vaccine strain of _B. abortus_ used to prevent brucellosis in cattle (1). Brucellosis is a serious zoonotic infection caused by the bacteria _Brucella_ spp. The most common sign is fever, followed by osteoarticular symptoms, sweating, and constitutional symptoms (2). Without proper treatment, infection can become chronic and potentially life-threatening (2). The patient had consumed raw (unpasteurized) milk from dairy A in Pennsylvania. In July 2017, Texas health officials documented the 1st human case of domestically acquired RB51 infection associated with raw milk consumption from a Texas dairy (3). In October 2017, a 2nd RB51 case associated with raw milk consumption was documented in New Jersey; the milk source was not identified at the time.\n\nTo determine the RB51 source for the New York case, PDA conducted an environmental investigation at dairy A in December 2018. PDA collected individual milk samples from all cows, excluding those known not to have been vaccinated against _B._, and from the bulk milk tank, which included milk pooled from all cows. All milk samples underwent polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing and culture; whole-genome sequencing (WGS) was performed on patient and milk sample isolates. PDA conducted a traceback investigation of any cow with a milk sample that tested positive for RB51. PADOH worked with the raw milk cooperative that distributed dairy A's milk to notify potentially exposed consumers and distributed notifications through Epi-X to identify cases.\n\nDairy A sold only raw milk and did not provide RB51 vaccination to cows born there (16 of the 30-cow herd). The remaining 14 cows were born outside the dairy and had inadequate vaccination records to determine whether they had received RB51. Because these cows might have been vaccinated, milk samples were collected from them. RB51 was detected by PCR and isolated in milk samples collected from the bulk tank and a single cow (cow 122). WGS identified 2 distinct RB51 strains shed by cow 122: one matched the 2018 New York patient's isolate (3 single nucleotide polymorphisms [SNPs] different) and one, unexpectedly, matched the 2017 New Jersey patient's isolate (1 SNP different). The 2 different RB51 strains were also shed from different quarters of cow 122's udder.\n\nTraceback revealed that cow 122 had received RB51 in 2011 and was purchased by dairy A in 2016. During 2016-2018, dairy A distributed raw milk potentially contaminated with RB51 to 19 states; PADOH notified those states' public health veterinarians. PADOH provided a letter with RB51 information and brucellosis prophylaxis recommendations to the cooperative, which they distributed to dairy A customers. No additional cases were identified. Cow 122 was excluded from milk production, and serial PCR testing of bulk milk samples were subsequently negative for RB51.\n\nIsolation of 2 different RB51 strains from different quarters of a cow's udder has not previously been reported. These infections highlight the need to prevent RB51 infections. Raw milk consumption is also associated with serious illnesses caused by other pathogens, including _Campylobacter_ spp., Shiga toxin-producing _Escherichia coli_, and _Salmonella_ spp. (4). During 2007-2012, the number of raw milk outbreaks in the USA increased; 66 (81%) of 81 reported outbreaks occurred in states where raw milk sale is legal (5). Pregnant women, children, older adults, and persons with immunocompromising conditions are at greatest risk for infection.\n\nTo eliminate infection risk from milkborne pathogens, including RB51, all milk should be pasteurized. Because limited information is available about intermittent or continuous RB51 shedding among dairy cows, more research is needed to more fully understand this emerging public health threat for milk consumers. States can also consider the United States Animal Health Associations' recommendations regarding the need for RB51 vaccination in areas where _B. abortus_ is not endemic in wildlife.\n\nReferences\n1.

In July 2017, Texas health officials documented the 1st human case of domestically acquired RB51 infection associated with raw milk consumption from a Texas dairy (3). Cow 122 was excluded from milk production, and serial PCR testing of bulk milk samples were subsequently negative for RB51. During 2016-2018, dairy A distributed raw milk potentially contaminated with RB51 to 19 states; PADOH notified those states' public health veterinarians. All milk samples underwent polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing and culture; whole-genome sequencing (WGS) was performed on patient and milk sample isolates. WGS identified 2 distinct RB51 strains shed by cow 122: one matched the 2018 New York patient's isolate (3 single nucleotide polymorphisms [SNPs] different) and one, unexpectedly, matched the 2017 New Jersey patient's isolate (1 SNP different). Dairy A sold only raw milk and did not provide RB51 vaccination to cows born there (16 of the 30-cow herd). Notes from the field: _Brucella abortus_ vaccine strain RB51 infection and exposures associated with raw milk consumption, Wise County, Texas, 2017. Because limited information is available about intermittent or continuous RB51 shedding among dairy cows, more research is needed to more fully understand this emerging public health threat for milk consumers. Raw milk consumption is also associated with serious illnesses caused by other pathogens, including _Campylobacter_ spp. RB51 was detected by PCR and isolated in milk samples collected from the bulk tank and a single cow (cow 122). Non-zoonotic organisms such as _Streptococcus pyogenes_, _Salmonella_ Typhi, _Corynebacterium diphtheriae_, _Shigella_ spp., _Salmonella_ Paratyphi A, _Salmonella_ Paratyphi B, enterotoxins from _Staphylococcus aureus_, and hepatitis A have also been associated with the ingestion of raw milk.

Humans generally acquire the disease through direct contact with infected animals, by eating or drinking contaminated animal products, or by inhaling airborne agents. Consumption of unpasteurized milk and dairies as well as contact with an animal or animal product infected with the _Brucella_ bacterium are the main causes of brucellosis, Amiri said.\n\nWestern, northwestern, and northeastern provinces are the most affected regions in Iran, he added. 'Information dissemination to animal farmers as well as vaccination of livestock have been conducted in this region,' he noted.\n\nThe disease has been reported in more than a half-million people each year in 100 countries, according to the WHO.\n\nGeneral symptoms of brucellosis are often vague and similar to influenza. They may include fever, back pain, body-wide aches and pains, poor appetite and weight loss, headache, night sweats, weakness, abdominal pain, and cough.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[This infection, a bacterial zoonosis, is classified among the category B biowarfare agents.

The bacilli tend to localize in the reproductive organs of the animals, causing sterility and abortions, and are shed in large numbers in the animal's urine, milk, and placental fluid. This localization allows for efficient spread to farmers, veterinarians, slaughterhouse workers, and consumers.\n\nAmong the 4 species known to cause disease in humans, _Brucella melitensis_ (from goats, sheep, or camels) may be the most virulent, producing the most severe and acute cases of brucellosis with disabling complications. A prolonged course of illness, which may be associated with suppurative destructive lesions, is associated with _B. suis_ (from feral or commercially raised pigs) infection. _B. abortus_ (from cattle, buffalo, and camels) is associated with mild-to-moderate sporadic disease that is rarely associated with complications.\n\nIn the Maghreb and the Middle East, human brucellosis is usually contracted through consumption of raw goat/ewe's milk or local artisanal cheese made from raw milk, and _Brucella melitensis_ is responsible for the great majority of the reported cases, with a marked predominance of its biovar 3, as in other Mediterranean countries. - Mod.LL\n\nHealthMap/ProMED-mail map:\nIran: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/128]", "summary": "A ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n Communicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[This infection, a bacterial zoonosis, is classified among the category B biowarfare agents.

Reproductive losses are the most common syndrome in animals, while humans may suffer from a debilitating nonspecific illness or localized involvement of various organs. Each species of _Brucella_ tends to be associated with a specific host, but other animals can be infected, especially when they are in close contact. Cattle are the usual hosts for _B. abortus_. This organism also causes brucellosis in bison, water buffalo, camels, and elk, and occasionally affects other species.

These are 2 citizens of Ath Vouali, hospitalized Wednesday [28 Aug 2019] at the EPH Kaci Yahia M'Chedallah. The affected subjects are a 40-year-old father and his 15-month-old son. Met in the halls of the hospital, the father indicated that he and his family have consumed raw milk from the farmer whose goats were infected almost 2 months ago.\n\nAfter these 2 new victims, 6 cases of human brucellosis have been detected since last week [18-24 Aug 2019] in this commune and hospitalized at M'Chedallah hospital. In this context, we learned that a Daira commission, composed of a member of the APC executive of Ath Mansour, the subdivisionary of agriculture of Ahnif, a member of the prevention of the Ahnif EPSP and the M'Chedallah Civil Protection Unit, was set up on the instructions of the Daira Chief.\n\nThis commission has already visited the premises where the goat farmer in question resides, in Rodha, south of the capital of the commune, to make the necessary arrangements, such as the census of the animals and their quarantine (isolation) with slaughter orientation on those carrying this disease. It should be remembered that caprine brucellosis was detected by an animal health practitioner at the farm level in June 2019 and that part of the herd was already slaughtered at the municipal slaughterhouse.\n\nA total of 75 goats were slaughtered out of 300 heads, with carcass burial as stipulated by the regulations in force. 'The transmission of this epidemic was made from the consumption of milk that the farmer of the contaminated livestock sold to a merchant of this commune. This product, raw or curd, was then sold retail to customers. It should be noted that the brucellosis virus has an incubation period that can last several months before the 1st symptoms, which are fever and nausea followed by a general weakness, begin to appear. The treatment is also spread over a long period of time,' says a medical source who expects more cases to be detected in the coming days.\n\nDistraught, the citizens of Ath Mansour storm the health institutions of the region where samples are taken for the purposes of screening. A source close to the agricultural services says that none of the citizens hitherto infected by this bacterium has goats.\n\n[Byline: Oulaid Soualah]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[This infection, a bacterial zoonosis, is classified among the category B biowarfare agents.

In a statement [Fri 6 Dec 2019], the Lanzhou Veterinary Research Institute, an affiliated institute of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, said that the 1st few grad students from the institute's foot-and-mouth disease prevention team tested positive for brucellosis antibodies on [28 Nov 2019]. The labs affected have been closed, the institute said, and national and local health authorities have assembled a team to investigate the outbreak.\n\nLi Hui, an official at the health commission in Lanzhou, the provincial capital, told Sixth Tone on [Mon 9 Dec 2019] that the total number of brucellosis cases at the institute had climbed to 96. None have shown clinical symptoms, according to domestic media, and it remains unclear how they were exposed to the bacteria.\n\nBrucellosis -- also known as Malta, Mediterranean, or undulant fever -- is a zoonotic disease that mainly affects animals, including livestock and dogs, which can in turn transmit the bacteria to humans through direct contact. Symptoms include fever, chills, sweating, lethargy, and aches and pains, according to the WHO. In the absence of early diagnosis and treatment, brucellosis can become a chronic condition that is difficult to cure.\n\nIn China, brucellosis is a Class B disease, ranking below a more serious category that includes cholera and plague. Human-to-human transmission has only been known to occur between lactating mothers and their babies. According to state broadcaster China National Radio, the brucellosis outbreak at the Gansu veterinary institute has prompted health checks among local students and staff who fear that they may have come into contact with infected animals.\n\nOne of the last brucellosis outbreaks in China occurred in 2011, when an agricultural university in the northeastern Heilongjiang province reported 28 cases stemming from infected goats being used in lab research. The school publicly apologized, fired 2 administrators, and offered each of the students' affected monetary compensation.\n\nScientific labs are subject to different experimental standards depending on their biosafety level, according to a researcher surnamed Yang at the Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, an affiliate of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.\n\n'If the protection levels don't keep pace (with biosafety levels), there will be a risk of infection,' Yang, who studies viruses and works in a Biosafety Level 2+ lab, told Sixth Tone. As a result, labs generally require researchers to undergo safety training or even pass an exam to earn a certification, said Yang, who only used her surname because she was not authorized by her employer to speak to media.\n\nThe Lanzhou Veterinary Research Institute describes itself as 'China's only authorized research center for working with the live virus that causes foot-and-mouth disease,' a highly contagious disease affecting livestock. The institute is reportedly also one of the few in China with Biosafety Level 3 labs, which are required for _brucella_ pathogen studies, according to the National Health Commission.\n\nAs the local agriculture department tries to ascertain the source of the recent infections, Lanzhou's health commission said [Fri 6 Dec 2019], it is implementing precautionary measures so that brucellosis does not pose a threat to neighboring communities.\n\n[Byline: Yuan Ye]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[An earlier report suggested that 4 persons were clinically ill but this is not confirmed here.\n\nBrucellosis (http://www.medicinenet.com/brucellosis/article.htm) is a disease that is thought to have existed since ancient times, as it was 1st described more than 2000 years ago by the Romans and Hippocrates. It was not until 1887 that a British physician, Dr. David Bruce, isolated the organism that causes brucellosis from several deceased patients from the island of Malta. This disease has had several names throughout its history, including Mediterranean fever, Malta fever, Crimean fever, Bang's disease, and undulant fever (because of the relapsing nature of the fever associated with the disease).\n\nThe symptoms and signs of brucellosis may develop from days to months after the initial exposure to the organism. While some individuals may develop mild symptoms, others may go on to develop long-term chronic symptoms. The signs and symptoms of brucellosis are extensive, and they can be similar to many other febrile illnesses, so recognition of potential exposure -- from ingestion of unpasteurized milk or cheese, employment as a veterinarian or veterinary student, in a slaughter house or meat processing plant, or working in a microbiology lab -- is vital.

The strain _Brucella canis_ infects, predominantly, dogs.\n\nThe alert announcement comes following the results of laboratory tests indicating infection in a pure-bred Pomeranian bitch, while 2 other dogs were found suspected of infection. This has led to suspecting possible additional infections in pure-bred dogs.\n\n_Brucella canis_ has not been recorded in Israel before. In dogs, this disease is manifested by inappetence, depression and muscle pain; bitches may abort. In extremely rare cases, _B. canis_ may cause human infection, causing fever and complications.\n\nThe spokeswoman for the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, Ms. Dafna Yurista, informed KanIsrael that about 3 weeks ago [prior to 10 Oct 2019, namely during the 3rd week of September 2019], the owner of the aborting bitch approached a veterinary clinic in the city Kiryat Shmona.\n\nThe bitch was one of 6 kept by him, and was the 2nd to abort. Consequently, the animal was tested, and suspicion for _B. canis_ infection was raised. Consequently, and as instructed by the Regional Office of the VSAH (Israel's Veterinary Services & Animal Health), the owner was asked to return urgently to the clinic with all his dogs for examination. When failing to do so, the Galilee-Golan regional VSAH office, accompanied by inspectors of the Ministry's Investigation/enforcement unit (Pitzuach), entered the owner's premises with a court order. They discovered, in a rear warehouse, 6 Pomeranian dogs in good condition and without suspicion of abuse. The 6 dogs were confiscated and taken for testing for ab antibodies (serology) and for the antigen.\n\nIt was found that one bitch was infected with the bacterium and 2 others suspected; the remaining 3 were found negative. The bitches are currently being kept under quarantine pending a decision on further handling of the matter. The suspect owner was detained for interrogation on suspicion of spreading diseases in animals. His investigation revealed that the dogs had been brought to Israel several months ago. When he discovered that they were ill, his intention was to return them to the seller.\n\nIn view of the said history, the Ministries of Agriculture and Health have published an advisory that anyone who has purchased a purebred puppy of any breed during the past 6 months should bring the dog to a veterinarian for examination to exclude _B. canis_ infection.\n\n[byline: Moshe Naim]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[There are several points to be clarified in relation to the above report. In particular, the origin of the infected batch of Pomeranians, the route of their introduction into Israel, and -- in case legally introduced -- was testing for _B. canis_ in the place (country) of origin required. In addition, details of the laboratory tests establishing the identity of the pathogen and excluding the brucella species widely spread in Israel (_B. melitensis_), would be helpful.\n\nIt is not clear whether the case described above can be considered as autochthonous or, rather, an imported _B. canis_ case.\n\n_Brucella canis_ is a Gram negative coccobacillus in the family Brucellaceae (class Alphaproteobacteria). Other _Brucella_ species occasionally associated with disease in dogs include _B. abortus_, _B. melitensis_ and _B. suis_.\n\n_B. canis_ is an important cause of reproductive failure in dogs, especially in kennels. Infections can result in abortions and stillbirths in bitches, and epididymitis, prostatitis, orchitis and sperm abnormalities in males. Although spayed or neutered dogs do not have reproductive signs, they occasionally develop other conditions such as ocular disease and discospondylitis. _B. canis_ may persist in an animal even after antibiotic treatment. In kennels, infected dogs are often euthanized to prevent them from infecting other dogs or people. Canine brucellosis is sometimes difficult to diagnose with the currently available tests.\n\nThe importance of _B. canis_ as a cause of human illness is still unclear. Few clinical cases have been reported in people, and most have been mild. However, human infections with this organism may be underdiagnosed, as the symptoms are nonspecific, diagnostic suspicion among physicians is low, and obtaining a definitive diagnosis may be difficult. One clinical case was caused by the M-strain of _B. canis_, a laboratory strain that has reduced virulence and is used as an antigen for serological testing.\n\nDogs are thought to be the only significant hosts for _B. canis_ among domesticated animals. Antibodies to this organism have been detected in cats in South America, but bacteria were not recovered. Antibodies to _B. canis_ have also been reported occasionally in wild canids.\n\n_B. canis_ appears to be widely distributed. It has been reported in North, Central and South America, parts of Asia, Africa and Europe. New Zealand and Australia appear to be free of _B. canis_; however, Australia has reported some _B. suis_ infections in dogs, mainly in animals used to hunt feral pigs. The Netherlands has reported recently its 1st officially autochthonous confirmed case ( 20190509.6462102).\n\nThe above and additional exhaustive information is available in the 2018 fact sheet Brucellosis: Canine, by Anna Rovid Spickler, at http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/brucellosis_canis.pdf. - Mod.AS\n\nHealthMap/ProMED map available at:\nIsrael: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/90]", "summary": "\n\n[byline: Moshe Naim]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n< A ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n Following the discovery of _Brucella canis_ in purchased purebred puppies, the ministries of agriculture and health announced today [Thu 10 Oct 2019] that they call upon any person who purchased, during the last 6 months, puppies of purebred breeds to immediately bring the dog to a veterinarian. \n\nDogs are thought to be the only significant hosts for _B. canis_ among domesticated animals.

The most common source of infection is through the consumption of raw, unpasteurized dairy products. Prior to becoming ill, the patient in this case had consumed unpasteurized homemade dairy products from Mexico. No other risk factors have been identified.\n\nThe individual was hospitalized and is recovering after being treated for the illness. A 2nd, related case of brucellosis is also pending confirmation by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n\n'Cases such as this one can serve as an unfortunate reminder that we are vulnerable to certain bacteria and should take precautions to protect ourselves,' said Department of Public Health (DPH) Medical Director Dr. Rick Hong. 'Delawareans are encouraged to avoid purchasing and consuming unpasteurized dairy products. Consuming questionable food items is not worth the risk to your health.'\n\nBrucellosis infection is most frequently transmitted by eating or drinking raw/unpasteurized dairy products such as milk and cheese, yet can also be contracted through inhalation or physical contact with infected animals or animal products. When sheep, goats, cows or camels are infected, their milk becomes contaminated with the bacteria. If the milk from infected animals is not pasteurized, the infection will be transmitted to people who consume the milk and/or cheese products. Brucellosis is not common in the USA. Nationally, the average is fewer than 200 human cases each year. Person-to-person transmission is rare. Prior to this case, the DPH has confirmed 3 cases since 2010; those cases occurred in 2010, 2017 and 2018. The case in 2010 was associated with consumption of unpasteurized milk while the nature of exposure in the 2017 and 2018 cases is unknown.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Although these cases are related to unpasteurized dairy products from Mexico, cases of infection from US dairy also occur.

The bacterium causes the brucellosis disease. In theory, this disease can also spread to people, although the chance is very small.\n\nAll veterinarians in the Netherlands have received a newsletter in which the NVWA alerts the professional group about the emergence of this disease of dogs. The most important signs of the disease are serious back- and neck pains. In addition, the bacterium may cause infertility, dead or weak neonates, and difficulties in urination and defecation.\n\nThe human disease may be expressed by long-term fever. Often, there are complaints such as headache, fatigue, listlessness, sweating and joint problems. Brucellosis can be treated with antibiotics, but if this is not done in a timely way, a chronic disease can develop. However, the risk of human disease in the Netherlands is very small, says the the NVWA: 'To date, there have been no reports of infection in people in the Netherlands, not even in people who had intensive contact with infected dogs.'\n\nThe NVWA discovered the dogs' disease when a veterinarian recently examined a dog imported from Russia with serious back pain. After a blood test, the animal was found to be infected with _Brucella canis_. The dog was owned by a Dutch breeder with multiple breeds. The NVWA has examined all dogs present at the breeding farm. Dogs of different breeds and genera were found to be infected. That also applied to some offspring of these dogs. All infected dogs were euthanized after consulting experts and NVWA and in consultation with the keeper.\n\nThe NVWA does not want to disclose the name of the breeding and the breeds of the dogs. In the letter to the vets, the NVWA says that 'with everything in its power' it tries to track down the dog owners who have bought a puppy from the relevant breeder. The agency wants to inform the owners about the infection and discourage them from breeding the animals. The disease is not deadly, says the NVWA. But: 'It is a condition that seriously affects the well-being of dogs when developing back problems. Because there is no curative therapy, it often means that the dog is then euthanized.'\n\n_B. canis_ was also found in the Netherlands in 2017 [This may refer to imported cases? - Mod.AS].

One clinical case was caused by the M-strain of _B. canis_, a laboratory strain that has reduced virulence and is used as an antigen for serological testing.\n\nDogs are thought to be the only significant hosts for _B. canis_ among domesticated animals. Antibodies to this organism have been detected in cats in South America, but bacteria were not recovered. Antibodies to _B canis_ have also been reported occasionally in wild canids.\n\n_B. canis_ appears to be widely distributed.

The infection with _Brucella_ species is not spread from person to person.\n\nSpokesperson for the department, Neil Shikwambana, says the farmer contracted the disease after he was reported to have drank unpasteurized (unboiled) milk from his cattle.\n\nBrucellosis can be contracted through eating undercooked/uncooked meat or consuming unpasteurized/raw dairy products (milk, cheese, ice cream), or coming into contact with an infected animal. Bacteria can also enter wounds in the skin/mucous membranes through contact with infected animals.

The USA has quarantine facilities at ports for cattle, horses and other livestock. It needs to be expanded to include dogs and likely other animals. Imported rescue dogs especially need to have their vaccinations for prevention of rabies, distemper, parvo virus and other diseases. While being held at a facility, they should be checked for other diseases such as canine influenza and zoonotic diseases such as brucellosis.\n\nRescue animals from other countries need to be quarantined, not put in foster homes where there could be exposure to other animals or immunosuppressed individuals until some of these vaccines and testing have been performed. These quarantine facilities should be inspected by knowledgeable individuals according to law.\n\nBrucellosis is a zoonotic bacterial disease caused by several species in the genus _Brucella_. _Brucella canis_ is an important cause of reproductive failure in dogs, especially in kennels. Infections can result in abortions and stillbirths in females, and epididymitis, prostatitis, orchitis and sperm abnormalities in males. Although spayed or neutered dogs do not have reproductive signs, they occasionally develop other conditions such as ocular disease and discospondylitis. _B. canis_ may persist in an animal even after antibiotic treatment. In kennels, infected dogs are often euthanized to prevent them from infecting other dogs or people. Canine brucellosis is sometimes difficult to diagnose [in dogs] with the currently available tests.\n\nThe importance of _B. canis_ as a cause of human illness is still unclear. Few clinical cases have been reported in people, and most have been mild. However, human infections with this organism may be underdiagnosed, as the symptoms are nonspecific, diagnostic suspicion among physicians is low, and obtaining a definitive diagnosis may be difficult (http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/brucellosis_canis.pdf).\n\nFurthermore, immunosuppressed people, from cancers or other diseases, may be at a more significant risk. Veterinarians, veterinary technicians or nurses, and kennel help may also be more susceptible due to their more frequent exposure to urine.\n\nReaders are also encouraged to see the moderator's remarks on ProMED-mail Brucellosis, canine - USA: public health risk 20180818.5974044. - Mod.TG\n\nOne estimate has put the cost of the H3N2 canine influenza outbreaks that resulted from importation of Korean rescue dogs over USD 75 million for US dog owners due to veterinary care for sick pets, vaccinations, business losses during outbreaks at kennels/boarding facilities, etc. Add in the potential costs from another strain of distemper virus wildlife species in North America have no immunity to, and now Brucellosis, a human health risk.

In total, 18 bovine animals were tested; 10 bovine animals revealed positive results in serological testing. Additional brucelin skin test was performed on all bovine animals older than 12 months, out of which 5 animals were positive. Those bovine animals were slaughtered, and samples were taken for confirmation purposes. _Brucella melitensis_ was isolated from the samples (supramamary limph nodes) originating from 3 bovines.

In some countries, particularly in southern Europe, Africa, and western Asia, where cattle are kept in close association with sheep or goats, infection can also be caused by _B. melitensis_. Occasionally, _B. suis_ may cause a chronic infection of the mammary gland of cattle, but it has not been reported to cause abortion or spread to other animals. Infection with _Brucella_ in cattle is widespread globally, but several countries in northern and central Europe, Canada, Japan, Australia, and New Zealand are believed to be free from both _B. abortus_ and _B. melitensis_.\n\nThe disease is usually asymptomatic in young animals and non-pregnant females. Following infection with _B. abortus_ or _B. melitensis_, pregnant adult females develop a placentitis usually resulting in abortion between the 5th and 9th month of pregnancy. Even in the absence of abortion, profuse excretion of the organism occurs in the placenta, fetal fluids, and vaginal discharges. The mammary gland and associated lymph nodes may also be infected, and organisms may be excreted in the milk. Subsequent pregnancies are usually carried to term, but uterine and mammary infection recurs, with reduced numbers of organisms in afterbirth products and milk. In acute infections, the organism is present in most major body lymph nodes. Adult male cattle may develop orchitis/epididymitis, and brucellosis may be a cause of infertility in both sexes. Hygromas, usually involving leg joints, are a common manifestation of brucellosis in some tropical countries and may be the only obvious indicator of infection; the hygroma fluid is often infected with _Brucella_.\n\n_Brucella abortus_, _B. melitensis_, and _B. suis_ are highly pathogenic for humans, and potentially contaminated tissues, cultures, and materials must be handled under appropriate containment conditions.'\nSource: http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.01.04_brucellosis.pdf\n- Mod.CRD\n\nHealthMap/ProMED-mail map:\nCroatia: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/74]", "summary": "A ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n Cattle / rose bengal test (RBT) / 12 Oct 2018 / positive\nCattle / complement fixation test (CFT) / 12 Oct 2018 / positive\n\nFuture reporting\n Cattle / 29 / 3 / 0 / 0 / 5\n\nOutbreak statistics\nSpecies / Apparent morbidity rate / Apparent mortality rate / Apparent case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*\n Measures to be applied: disinfection\n\nDiagnostic test results\nLaboratory name and type: Croatian Veterinary Institute, Zagreb (national laboratory)\n Total animals affected:\nSpecies / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered\n BRUCELLOSIS - CROATIA: (SISACKO-MOSLAVACKA) MELITENSIS, BOVINE, OIE\n*******************************************************************\n Total outbreaks: 1\nOutbreak 1: Katinovac, Katinovac, Topusko, Sisacko-Moslavacka\n Source: OIE, WAHID (World Animal Health Information Database), weekly disease information [edited]\nhttp://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=28835\n\n\nInformation received on [and dated] 3 Dec 2018 from Dr Damir Tudan, assistant minister, chief veterinary officer, Veterinary and Food Safety Directorate, Ministry of Agriculture, Zagreb, Croatia\n\n Summary\nReport type: immediate notification\n Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n< Cattle / immunocapture ELISA / 12 Oct 2018 / positive\nCattle / polymerase chain reaction (PCR) / 28 This event pertains to a defined zone within the country\n\nNew outbreaks (1)\n Date of start of the event: 3 Oct 2018\n 12 Oct 2018 / positive\n [The location of the outbreak can be seen on the interactive map included in the OIE report at the source URL above.]\n\n--\n Date of start of the outbreak: 3 Oct 2018\n Measures applied: slaughter, vaccination prohibited, no treatment of affected animals\n Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction, and/or slaughter\n\nEpidemiology\n Date of confirmation of the event: 28 Nov 2018\n Date: Mon 3 Dec 2018\n", "reports": [{"diseases": ["unknown", "other", "brucellosis"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2018-03-24 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Zagreb", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Australia", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "WAHID", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "New Zealand", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Canada", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Japan", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Croatia", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "6223249", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Brucellosis - USA (08): (PA) bovine, human", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=6223249", "date": "2018-12-27 10:11:38", "main_text": "BRUCELLOSIS - USA (08): (PENNSYLVANIA) BOVINE, HUMAN\n****************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: 22 Dec 2018\nSource: Penn Live [edited]\nhttps://www.pennlive.com/news/2018/12/did-you-get-unpasteurized-milk-from-this-central-pa-farm-discard-it-officials-say.html\n\n\nOfficials with Pennsylvania's Department of Agriculture are asking consumers to discard certain dairy products purchased from a farm in Lancaster county.\n\nUnpasteurized cow's milk or dairy products from Miller's Biodiversity Farm in Lancaster county should immediately be discarded, according to a news release from the agency.

'Pasteurized dairy products from Miller's Biodiversity Farm have been deemed safe.'\n\nOfficials note that pasteurized milk sold elsewhere in the state is safe to consume.\n\nOne person in New York has been diagnosed with _B. abortus_ after confirmation by the Centers for Disease Control. The illness causes no clinical signs in cattle, but it can be spread to humans.\n\nSymptoms (in people) include flu-like symptoms, fever, sweats, headaches, back pain, and physical weakness.\n\n[Byline: Travis Kellar]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The article mentioned raw, unpasteurized milk as being the source. The type of test used to test the milk may have other bacteria causing a positive cross reaction. Depending upon the test used, a repeat test with a laboratory reference method should be used.\n\nThis article mentions Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, which is in the southern portion of the state, but the _Brucellosis_ sp. positive individual was in New York state. So, one wonders whether the ill person in New York was traveling and purchased the milk or whether the individual lives in northern Pennsylvania and was transported to a hospital in New York, or whether this is from the same dairy?\n\nThis article is referring to the bacterium _Brucella abortus_. The infectious disease can affect humans, wildlife and domestic animals, including dogs. Historically, cattle have been the primary carriers, but as states move more into close interaction with wildlife, such as the Greater Yellowstone area, or with managing cervids and buffalo, the carrier in a particular area may not necessarily be cattle. Other wildlife carriers include bison, elk, reindeer, caribou and feral swine.\n\nLarge animals, especially elk and bison may have no obvious signs of the disease. The _Brucella_ bacterium collects in the lymphatic system, the udder and the reproductive tract. Abortion is a sign of the disease. Other signs in animals may include retained placenta, swollen testicles, reduced pregnancy rates, decreased milk production and swollen, painful joints.\n\nIn humans, this disease is known by several names, including Malta fever, Mediterranean fever and undulant fever. Humans may acquire the disease through assisting an infected animal in the birthing process, examining an aborted fetus without protection, drinking unpasteurized milk or other dairy products, through an open wound, or even intact skin, or a splash of infected body fluids into the eyes, nose or mouth. Slaughterhouse workers and veterinarians are at risk because of the nature of their jobs. Consumption of infected raw meat by humans may also be a source of infection, however if the meat is properly cooked it does not present a disease risk.\n\nWhen a person is infected, clinical signs and symptoms may include fever, body aches, anorexia, lethargy, weakness, fatigue as well as swollen lymph nodes and possibly enlargement of the spleen and liver. Symptoms may develop over several weeks or months, or even immediately. Joints, bones, and especially the spine may be painful. Other joints such as ankles, hips, knees and shoulders may be swollen, warm, and painful. - Mod.TG\n\nThat the strain has been characterized as _B. abortus_ suggests that, like several past cases, this one is related to the bovine vaccine strain.

As is mentioned in the epidemiological comments, the 6 animals that aborted were positive to the disease. However, it is not clear whether all the susceptible animals on the premises were tested. As is mentioned in the OIE Terrestrial Manual: 'The disease is usually asymptomatic in young animals and non-pregnant females. Following infection with _B. abortus_ or _B. melitensis_, pregnant adult females develop a placentitis, usually resulting in abortion between the 5th and 9th months of pregnancy. Even in the absence of abortion, profuse excretion of the organism occurs in the placenta, fetal fluids and vaginal discharges. The mammary gland and associated lymph nodes may also be infected, and organisms may be excreted in the milk. Subsequent pregnancies are usually carried to term, but uterine and mammary infection recurs, with reduced numbers of organisms in afterbirth products and milk.

The disease, called brucellosis, poses a financial concern for dairy producers and cattle ranchers, but its effects on the wild elk population have generally been considered minor.\n\nIn recent years, however, elk pregnancy rates have become the subject of controversy. Various researchers claim that stress caused by fear of wolves and nutritional deficiencies caused by drought can explain low pregnancy rates in specific elk herds, but until now the effects of brucellosis on elk pregnancy have not been scrutinized.\n\nUtah State University researchers Gavin Cotterill and Johan du Toit report by mid-winter, elk testing positive for brucellosis are less likely to be pregnant than healthy elk, independent from the abortions caused by the disease later in the year. Cotterill and du Toit, along with colleagues from the Wyoming Game and Fish Department, US Geological Survey Northern Rocky Mountain Science Center, and University of California Berkeley, discuss their findings in Ecology and Evolution published on [28 Oct 2018] (DOI 10.1002/ece3.4521).\n\n'Mid-winter elk pregnancy rates are often seen as an indicator of an elk herd's health and viability,' says Cotterill, a PhD candidate at USU and lead author of the paper. 'If we're interested in figuring out the effect that predators or climate are having on elk we need to also account for disease.'\n\nThe researchers analyzed pregnancy and disease data collected over the last 20 years at Wyoming's supplemental winter feed-grounds for elk and ran additional pregnancy tests on stored blood samples.\n\n'We found the disease causes a substantial decline in the probability of pregnancy among young adult elk and the effect is weaker in older animals, but it's still unclear what the mechanism is that's causing this to happen,' said du Toit.\n\nThe results are not a cause for alarm but are a signal this disease, which came to the area in infected cattle, has previously hidden consequences for the wild elk population. Quantifying this effect is important, particularly as brucellosis is spreading through the elk population, so that the effects of other factors influencing elk reproduction may be estimated more accurately.\n\n'Elk numbers in most of the region are high, and we don't expect changes because of brucellosis,' said Cotterill. 'It's one more factor researchers and managers need to keep in mind moving forward.'\n\n[Byline: Jessie E.

However, this article is from the proverbial other side of the fence. It is examining the effects of brucellosis on the wildlife herd, especially the elk.\n\nIn all probability, in some era past, the cattle likely transmitted the disease to the elk that have harbored a low level in some groups, thus transmitting it back into the cattle herds occasionally, after ranchers worked to clean the disease from their cattle.\n\nThis article is especially interesting because it details the effects on the wildlife. Wildlife are a natural resource and it is nice to know the numbers are still high. Nevertheless, in a perfect world, treatment for both wildlife and domestic animals would be considered quite the advancement over test and slaughter.\n\nBrucellosis is a zoonotic disease, and in many places around the world, it still causes severe infections in humans. Brucellosis also causes decreased milk production, weight loss, abortion, and infertility in cattle. For these reasons, beginning in the mid-1950s, great efforts were made to eliminate the disease from all livestock within the United States. While these efforts were successful at eliminating transmission within cattle nation-wide, sporadic transmission from wildlife to cattle in and around the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem has been on the increase. Brucellosis can result in serious financial burdens to cattle producers, potentially resulting in quarantine of a herd, increased testing and vaccination costs, and possible difficulty in trade with other states and countries.\n\nAlthough the disease can cause abortions in elk, measurable population effects on population size or trend due to brucellosis have not been documented. However, the potential for transmission to livestock results in decreased acceptance of elk on private property which, in many areas, constitutes a large proportion of elk winter range. Historically, rates of exposure in elk (measured by blood tests) have been very low (below 2% in the early 1990's) and limited in distribution. Recent research and surveillance efforts have indicated that the prevalence and geographical distribution of the disease in elk is likely increasing. Brucellosis now exists in elk populations outside of the Greater Yellowstone Area. Hunters and game processors should take precautions (gloves and good hygiene) when handling reproductive and/or fetal material from hunter-harvested elk and bison.\n\nPortions of this comment extracted from: http://fwp.mt.gov/fishAndWildlife/diseasesAndResearch/healthPrograms/brucellosis/.- Mod.TG]\n\n[A map showing the location of the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem can be found at http://greateryellowstone.org/map/. - Mod.ML\n\nHealthMap/ProMED map available at:\nYellowstone National Park, Wyoming, United States: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/11246]", "summary": "\n\nUtah State University researchers Gavin Cotterill and Johan du Toit report by mid-winter, elk testing positive for brucellosis are less likely to be pregnant than healthy elk, independent from the abortions caused by the disease later in the year.

Dogs are the only definitive host of this organism. Infection has caused a reduction of 75 percent in the number of pups weaned in some breeding kennels. The disease disseminates rapidly among closely confined dogs, especially at time of breeding or when abortions occur. Transmission occurs via ingestion of contaminated materials or venereal routes. Urine transmission has been reported but seems to be unusual. Both sexes appear to be equally susceptible.\n\nInfected dogs may develop generalized lymphadenitis and frequently epididymitis, periorchitis, and prostatitis. Spondylitis and uveitis are occasional complications. Bacteremia is frequent and persists for about 18 months after exposure. Fever is not characteristic.\n\nLymphadenitis is common in dogs infected with _B. canis_ and may be regional or generalized. Epididymitis and scrotal edema can occur during the acute stage in infected males, and orchitis may be seen occasionally. Self-trauma (e.g., licking) can result in scrotal dermatitis. Concurrent prostatitis is common and may lead to pain and difficulty in urinating and defecating. Unilateral or bilateral testicular atrophy can be seen in chronic infections, and some males become infertile. Other male dogs can have abnormal sperm with morphological abnormalities and reduced viability. Occasionally reported clinical signs in dogs include lethargy or fatigue, exercise intolerance, decreased appetite, weight loss, and behavioral abnormalities (loss of alertness, poor performance of tasks); however, most animals do not appear seriously ill, and many are asymptomatic. Occasionally, discospondylitis can cause stiffness, lameness, or back pain. Chronic uveitis, unilateral endophthalmitis, dermatitis, endocarditis, osteomyelitis, and meningoencephalitis/low-grade meningitis have also been reported. Fever is rare. Dogs with brucellosis may recover spontaneously beginning a year after infection, but recovery is more common after 2-3 years, and some animals remain chronically infected for years. Deaths are rare except in the fetus or newborn. http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/brucellosis_canis.pdf\n\nAttempts at immunization of the dog have not been successful. Control is based on elimination or isolation of infected dogs identified by positive cultural or serologic tests at monthly intervals. Incidence of infection is much lower in kennels where dogs are caged individually. Long-term therapy (e.g., with a combination regimen of streptomycin or gentamicin and tetracycline) has been successful in many cases. Neutering of infected dogs is sometimes an alternative to euthanasia.\n\nPrevention of canine brucellosis is done by testing before entry and breeding. The disease is reportable in some states. _B canis_ is zoonotic, although cases of human infection are rare and less severe than those caused by the smooth species of the genus. The true incidence is unknown. Appropriate measures to prevent exposure should be taken. https://www.merckvetmanual.com/reproductive-system/brucellosis-in-dogs/overview-of-brucellosis-in-dogs\n\nInfection in humans:\n\nHumans usually become infected with members of the genus _Brucella_ by ingesting organisms or via the contamination of mucous membranes (including the conjunctiva and respiratory tract) and abraded skin. In case reports, _B. canis_ infections have occurred after close contact with dogs, especially animals that recently aborted or gave birth, or after exposure to large amounts of the organism in laboratories. However, there have also been clinical cases where the source of the organism could not be determined. [It is possible these cases may have come from infected dogs (either known or unknown infection status) where the owner cleaned up urine from the affected pet. - Mod.TG] There are no reports of person-to-person transmission of _B. canis_, although this is theoretically possible. For other species of _Brucella_, routes implicated in rare instances of human-to-human transmission include blood transfusion, bone marrow transplantation, exposure to contaminated material while assisting at a delivery, sexual intercourse, and nursing (infants). There is no indication that members of the genus _Brucella_ are transmitted between people by casual contact under ordinary conditions. http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/brucellosis_canis.pdf\n\nWhile documented human cases of _B. canis_ are rare and may be underreported, immunocompromised people should be especially careful around animals known to be positive for _B. canis_.\n\n_Brucella canis_ in dogs is not common, but nor is it rare. Gerald Hoff found that 4 percent of Florida pound dogs had positive titres of 1:200 or higher (see Brucella canis, dogs, retrospective - USA (Florida) 19980518.0954).\n\nHuman beings may be at risk of infection from dogs having the infection, and the owner may or may not realize the dog has the infection. While the article indicates there may be a bigger risk to human beings than has previously been acknowledged, then it must also acknowledge there are more infected canines than previously recognized.

Serologic testing at both laboratories has shown reactor level results on 3 animals from one herd. Further testing, including bacterial culture, will be conducted to confirm serology results.\n\nLogan and assistant state field veterinarian, Dr. Thach Winslow, are working with the owner of the infected cattle as well as the owners of 6 contact herds to determine risk levels and conduct an epidemiologic investigation. The herd with known _Brucella_-positive animals is under quarantine at this time, and quarantines will be issued to contact herd owners as the investigation proceeds. Contact herd owners are currently under hold-order movement restrictions, and no sexually intact cattle can be moved until the herd has been cleared by a complete risk assessment and appropriate brucellosis testing is conducted.\n\nBrucellosis is a bacterial disease that can cause cattle, elk, and bison to abort their pregnancies, typically late term. All of Wyoming's brucellosis cases since 1988 have been determined to have been caused by transmission from infected wildlife to cattle or domestic bison. Wyoming's last cases were found in late 2015, and the last affected herd was released in June of 2017.\n\nFor more information, contact the Wyoming Livestock Board field office at 1-307-857-4140.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The disease in cattle, water buffalo, and bison is caused almost exclusively by _Brucella abortus_; however, _B. suis_ occasionally is isolated from seropositive cows but does not appear to cause clinical signs and is not contagious from cow to cow. In some countries, the disease in cattle is caused by _B. melitensis_. The syndrome is similar to that caused by _B. abortus_. _B. melitensis_ is not present in the USA.\n\nInfection spreads rapidly and causes many abortions in unvaccinated cattle. In a herd in which disease is endemic, an infected cow typically aborts only once after exposure; subsequent gestations and lactations appear normal. After exposure, cattle become bacteremic for a short period and develop agglutinins and other antibodies; some cattle resist infection, and a small percentage of infected cows spontaneously recover.\n\nNatural transmission occurs by ingestion of organisms, which are present in large numbers in aborted fetuses, fetal membranes, and uterine discharges. Cattle may ingest contaminated feed and water or may lick contaminated genitals of other animals. Venereal transmission by infected bulls to susceptible cows appears to be rare. Transmission may occur by artificial insemination when _Brucella_-contaminated semen is deposited in the uterus but, reportedly, not when deposited in the midcervix. Brucellae may enter the body through mucous membranes, conjunctivae, wounds, or intact skin in both people and animals.\n\nEfforts are directed at detection and prevention, because no practical treatment is available. Eventual eradication depends on testing and eliminating reactors. The disease has been eradicated from many individual herds and areas by this method. Herds must be tested at regular intervals until 2 or 3 successive tests are negative.\n\nNoninfected herds must be protected. The greatest danger is from replacement animals. Additions should be vaccinated calves or nonpregnant heifers. If pregnant or fresh cows are added, they should originate from brucellosis-free areas or herds and be seronegative. Replacements should be isolated for about 30 days and retested before being added to the herd.\n\nVaccination of calves with _B. abortus_ Strain 19 or RB51 increases resistance to infection. Resistance may not be complete, and some vaccinated calves may become infected, depending on severity of exposure. A small percentage of vaccinated calves develop antibodies to Strain 19 that may persist for years and can confuse diagnostic test results. To minimize this problem, calves in the USA are mostly vaccinated with a vaccine of Strain RB51. It is a rough attenuated strain and does not cause production of antibodies, which are detected by most serologic tests.\n\nWhole-herd adult cattle vaccination using Strain 19 or RB51 has been practiced in certain high-incidence areas and selected herds in the USA with much success (see https://www.merckvetmanual.com/reproductive-system/brucellosis-in-large-animals/brucellosis-in-cattle).\n\nIt is standard for the state veterinarian's office to initiate tracings of the animals moved into a herd (trace- ins) and animals moved out of the herd (trace-outs). It helps determine if the disease was moved into the herd and, if so, which other herds may be infected, or if potentially other infected animals have moved out of the herd to another herd. This can take a bit of time and may or may not uncover other affected animals.

One case of RB51 infection (brucellosis) has been confirmed in New York, and an unknown number of people may have been exposed to RB51 from drinking the milk from this farm. This type of _Brucella_ is resistant to first-line drugs and can be difficult to diagnose because of limited testing options and the fact that early brucellosis symptoms are similar to those of more common illnesses like influenza.\n\nThe New York case is the 3rd known instance of an infection with RB51 associated with consuming raw milk or raw milk products produced in the USA. The other 2 human cases occurred in October 2017 in New Jersey and in August 2017 in Texas. Those cases reported drinking raw milk from an online retailer and a Texas farm, respectively. In addition to these 3 confirmed cases, hundreds of others were potentially exposed to RB51 during these 3 incidents.\n\nSymptoms of _Brucella_ infection (brucellosis)\n----------------------------------------------\n- Initial symptoms of brucellosis can include fever, sweats, loss of appetite, headache, fatigue, muscle and joint pain, and potentially more serious complications.\n- In pregnant patients, _Brucella_ infections can lead to miscarriage.\n- Symptoms can start anywhere from 5 days to 6 months after exposure.\n- People who are infected but are not treated can go on to develop more serious complications like arthritis; heart problems; enlargement of the spleen or liver; and, in rare cases, nervous system problems, like meningitis.\n\nAdvice to consumers\n-------------------\n- Raw milk and raw milk products are those that have not undergone a process called pasteurization that kills disease-causing germs.\n- RB51 is a live, weakened strain used in a vaccine to protect cows against a more severe form of _Brucella_ infection that can cause abortions in cows and severe illness in people. On rare occasions, cows vaccinated with RB51 vaccine can shed the bacteria in their milk. People who drink raw milk from cows that are shedding RB51 can develop brucellosis.\n- RB51 is resistant to rifampin, one of the antimicrobials that would typically be used to prevent or treat brucellosis. CDC recommends that anyone who may have been exposed to RB51 go to their doctor to see if they need antibiotics to prevent infection and symptoms from developing.\n- People who consumed raw milk or raw milk products from this dairy farm since January 2016 may have been exposed and should talk to their doctor.\n-- People who are still within 6 months of the date they last consumed the raw milk are at an increased risk for brucellosis and should receive antimicrobials to prevent an infection and symptoms, and should monitor their health for possible symptoms for 6 months. If symptoms develop, they should see their doctor immediately for testing.\n-- People who last drank raw milk from this dairy more than 6 months ago and have had symptoms of brucellosis - but not been treated - should see their doctor immediately for testing that can determine if they are infected and need antibiotics to prevent long-term health problems caused by brucellosis.\n- Discard any leftover or stored raw milk or raw milk products from this dairy farm.\n\nInvestigation details\n---------------------\n- A New York resident, who drank raw milk purchased from Miller's Biodiversity Farm in Quarryville, Pennsylvania, was diagnosed with brucellosis in November 2018.\n- Milk samples from Miller's Biodiversity tested positive for RB51. A cow that tested positive for RB51 has been removed from the milking herd.\n- As of 22 Jan 2019, investigators have determined that people in 19 states have bought or consumed raw milk from the implicated farm.

These new cases are in addition to the 31 cases recorded at the beginning of June [2018]. The same observation must be made concerning the 2 balance sheets.\n\nAlmost all cases of brucellosis recorded are concentrated in the Ouaguenoun Circle, a locality located 15 km northeast of the provincial capital. Indeed, out of the 36 cases lamented during the last 48 hours, 29 concern subjects living in this circle. As a result, firm instructions have been given to the people of this region especially, but also to the entire population of the province to avoid categorically eating cow's milk, butter or whey.\n\nA health and population director at the provincial level said yesterday [7 Jul 2018] that brucellosis is a serious disease that can lead to the death of someone who has it, if there is no treatment in urgent medical care. The 1st symptoms of this disease are fever and night sweats. Brucellosis, added the same person in charge of the DSP of Tizi Ouzou, can be contracted by consuming un-boiled cow's milk but also by the simple fact of being in contact with a suffering animal. It is urgent that the breeders use the veterinarians of the region to check whether their cows are free of this disease, which can endanger the health, even the lives, of dozens of citizens if a lack of vigilance is found.\n\nThe 36 people with this disease have all been urgently transported to the Nedir Mohamed University Hospital Center in Tizi Ouzou. Given the seriousness of this disease and the ease and speed with which it can spread, the governor of Tizi Ouzou, Mohamed Bouderbali, has just signed an order formally prohibiting the sale of cow's milk and its derivatives. This was said by an official at the level of the provincial director of agricultural services (DSA). This measure is taken in parallel with the investigation carried out by the departments concerned to detect the origin of this disease that has lasted for more than a month.\n\nAt the beginning of last June [2018], 31 other cases of brucellosis had been reported in the same province, with a high prevalence in the Ouaguenoun region. Other communes had also been affected by this disease in June 2018, in particular: Ait Boumahdi, near Ouacifs, Draa El Mizan, Tizi Rached, Ililten, and Ait Oumalou. The services concerned had been able to identify the same origin that led the people to be affected by brucellosis.\n\nIndeed, all reported drinking raw cow's milk. For the moment, and to the extent that some citizens are forced to consume cow's milk, for one reason or another, it would be imperative to boil it before consuming it. As for the breeders, they are called upon to protect themselves by taking care of the monitoring of their livestock by a veterinarian.\n\nBrucellosis is an infectious disease caused by a bacterium of the genus _Brucella_, common to certain animals and to humans. Brucellosis is one of the notifiable occupational diseases (Mpdo) in Algeria and in many countries around the world. Anyone affected should be systematically reported to the provincial health directorate. The latter must then, in an emergency, dispatch a team on the ground to circumscribe as soon as possible, detect the disease, and discover the affected animals and their immediate surroundings.\n\n[Byline: Aomar Mohellebi]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\nfrom\nProMED-FRA\n<promed-fra@promedmail.org>\n\n[This infection, a bacterial zoonosis, is classified among the category B biowarfare agents. Natural transmission to humans occurs after occupational exposure or through ingestion of contaminated food products. Although brucellosis has become a rare entity in the United States and many industrialized nations because of animal vaccination programs, this condition remains a significant health problem in many developing countries.\n\nEach species of _Brucella_ has a specific animal reservoir in which chronic disease is present. The bacilli tend to localize in the reproductive organs of the animals, causing sterility and abortions, and are shed in large numbers in the animal's urine, milk, and placental fluid.

Brucellosis, added the same person in charge of the DSP of Tizi Ouzou, can be contracted by consuming un-boiled cow's milk but also by the simple fact of being in contact with a suffering animal. As a result, firm instructions have been given to the people of this region especially, but also to the entire population of the province to avoid categorically eating cow's milk, butter or whey.

Notes from the field: Adverse event associated with unintentional exposure to the _Brucella abortus_ RB51 vaccine - Oregon, December 2017. doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm6726a4\n\nOn 7 Dec 2017, a previously healthy, middle-aged male veterinarian was evaluated at an Oregon emergency department (ED) for cough, malaise, myalgia, fever, and arthralgia of 4 days' duration. The patient reported having sustained a needle stick while administering the _Brucella abortus_ strain RB51 vaccine (RB51) to cattle 3 weeks before symptom onset. While the patient was in the ED, a probable diagnosis of brucellosis was considered, but _Brucella_ testing was not performed. After a chest radiograph, the patient was discharged with a doxycycline prescription for right upper lobe pneumonia. On 11 Dec 2017, the patient returned to the ED with worsening pneumonia. At that time, the Oregon Health Authority Public Health Division (OPHD) was notified of the probable brucellosis case. The patient was hospitalized and began oral rifampin and intravenous ceftriaxone and azithromycin, and continued oral doxycycline treatments. OPHD and the local health jurisdiction provided RB51-specific treatment and testing recommendations to clinicians and provided guidance for laboratory biosafety precautions through coordination with the Oregon State Public Health Laboratory. As a result, the hospitalist discontinued rifampin, continued doxycycline, and started trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX). By 3 days after admission, the patient's symptoms had improved, and he was discharged and prescribed doxycycline and TMP/SMX for 60 days, which is the recommended treatment for human RB51 infections (1). Blood and sputum cultures collected at admission were later negative for _Brucella_ spp. During reinterview, the patient confirmed that his only known RB51 exposure was the needle stick. Although he administered the vaccine regularly and was aware of its potential for pathogenicity in humans, he had not sought the recommended postexposure prophylaxis of doxycycline and TMX/SMX for 21 days (1).\n\nBrucellosis is a zoonotic bacterial disease of humans and many animal species, with a low infectious dose in humans (1). Occupational _Brucella_ spp. exposures most commonly affect veterinarians, health-care workers, and laboratorians. RB51 is a live-attenuated vaccine, approved for use as part of the Brucellosis Eradication Program in the mid-1990s (2). It is resistant to rifampin, a first-line treatment choice for human brucellosis, and does not induce an antibody response detectable by commercially available serologic assays, requiring culture for confirmation (1). Human infections with RB51 most commonly result from needle-stick injuries, which are relatively common and underreported among veterinarians (3). In a summary of RB51 exposures reported to CDC during 1998-1999, 7 of 26 (27 percent) persons reported persistent illnesses with symptoms similar to those reported by this patient (2). Although killed by pasteurization and not commonly shed in milk, RB51 recently gained attention nationwide during investigation of cases and exposures after raw (unpasteurized) milk consumption in Texas and New Jersey (4,5). These cases highlighted the lack of awareness of the unique challenges in diagnosing and treating RB51 infections in humans.\n\nThis report serves as a reminder that occupational RB51 exposure is a risk among veterinary personnel. Clinicians, laboratory staff members, and public-health officials should be aware of RB51 diagnosis and treatment challenges and be prepared to manage RB51 cases and exposures. State and local health jurisdictions should consider regular communication with veterinary and laboratory communities regarding occupational RB51 exposures and can serve as a resource to clinicians unfamiliar with management of human RB51 Brucella infections and exposures.\n\nReferences\n-----------\n1.

Reports were received from 26 individuals. Accidental exposure to RB51 occurred by needle-stick injury in 21 people (81 percent), conjunctival spray exposure in 4 (15 percent), and spray exposure of an open wound in one (4 percent) individual. At least one systemic symptom was reported in 19 (73 percent) people, including 3 (12 percent) who reported persistent local reactions with systemic involvement. One case required surgery, and _B. abortus_ strain RB51 was isolated from the wound of that individual. A total of 7 cases reported no adverse events associated with accidental exposure. As many as 9 cases reported previous exposure to _Brucella_ vaccines, including one case that also reported a previous diagnosis of brucellosis following exposure to S19 vaccine. Accidental needle-stick injuries and conjunctival or open-wound exposures of humans with the RB51 vaccine are associated with both local and systemic adverse events in the USA that are consistent with brucellosis; however, it remains undetermined if strain RB51 vaccine can cause systemic brucellosis in humans.

The above reported outbreak was reported by ProMED-mail on 30 Jun 2018 (see http://www.promedmail.org/post/5883595). At that time, no final identification of the pathogen as _B. melitensis_ was yet available.\n\nA solitary outbreak of _B. melitensis_ was reported by Austria to the OIE in January 2009, affecting a small sheep holding in Steiermark. Out of 47 susceptible sheep, 2 cases were lab identified. The 2 positive animals were slaughtered, no further actions undertaken/ reported. Steiermark is located in southeastern and central Austria, bordering Slovenia on the south.\n\nThe introduction of _B. melitensis_ into a cattle farm in Austria is highly exceptional. Possible human-borne infection deserves to be excluded. According to annual reports of ECDC, sporadic exotic human cases of _B. melitensis_ have been reported from Austria several times. - Mod AS]\n\n['Brucellosis is the generic name used for the animal and human infections caused by several species of the genus _Brucella_, mainly _Brucella abortus_, _B. melitensis_ and _B. suis_.\n\n'Infection with _Brucella_ in cattle is usually caused by biovars (bv.) of _Brucella abortus_. In some countries, particularly in southern Europe, Africa and western Asia, where cattle are kept in close association with sheep or goats, infection can also be caused by _B. melitensis_. Occasionally, _B. suis_ may cause a chronic infection of the mammary gland of cattle, but it has not been reported to cause abortion or spread to other animals. Infection with _Brucella_ in cattle is widespread globally but several countries in northern and central Europe, Canada, Japan, Australia and New Zealand are believed to be free from both _B. abortus_ and _B. melitensis_.\n\n'The disease is usually asymptomatic in young animals and non-pregnant females. Following infection with _B. abortus_ or _B. melitensis_, pregnant adult females develop a placentitis usually resulting in abortion between the 5th and 9th month of pregnancy. Even in the absence of abortion, profuse excretion of the organism occurs in the placenta, fetal fluids and vaginal discharges. The mammary gland and associated lymph nodes may also be infected, and organisms may be excreted in the milk. Subsequent pregnancies are usually carried to term, but uterine and mammary infection recurs, with reduced numbers of organisms in afterbirth products and milk.

In humans, the disease is characterized by fever and nonspecific influenza-like symptoms frequently including myalgia, arthralgia, and night sweats. Without appropriate treatment, brucellosis can become chronic, and life-threatening complications can arise. Human brucellosis transmitted by cattle was once common in the United States. Control strategies have focused on elimination of brucellosis through vaccination and surveillance of cattle herds, in addition to milk pasteurization. Because of these measures, domestically acquired human cases are now rare in the USA.\n\nFiji was free of the disease until recently. The cattle population has been reportedly free of the disease for many years until a re-emergence occurred in the Fiji Islands (Viti Levu) in 2009. The Fiji outbreak of _Brucella abortus_ occurred in cattle in 2009 (Wainivesi basin) in Tailevu province.\n\n'Prior to the outbreak, Fiji declared freedom from _B. abortus_ to OIE in 1996 after a successful eradication campaign. During the course of the outbreak investigation, serum samples were collected from between 9790 and 21 624 cattle per annum between 2009 and 2013 from 87 farms on the main island of Fiji (Viti Levu). Blood samples were tested for brucellosis using the Rose Bengal test (RBT) in 2009 and the indirect ELISA test in subsequent years. At the time of the outbreak in Fiji (2009) the apparent prevalence in cattle was 1.50 percent and this has fluctuated since the outbreak. The true prevalence (TP) for the main island in Fiji for the indirect ELISA tests was 2.40 percent in 2010, reached a peak of 3.49 percent in 2011 then reduced to 0.12 percent by 2013. The significant reduction in prevalence compared to 2010 is most likely due to the control programs being implemented in Fiji.\n\n'The re-emergence of _B. abortus_ in Fiji could be attributed to the lack of monitoring for the disease until 2009, combined with inadequate management of exposed animals, thus illustrating how important it is for authorities not to become complacent.

The farm's veterinarian investigated and collected blood samples. AGES confirmed brucellosis on [Fri 22 Jun 2018].\n\nThe competent authority acted without delay and has already taken all relevant measures. The dairy farm affected is currently restricted from selling milk and moving animals.\n\nBrucellosis is a disease caused by bacteria of the genus Brucella. The infection of humans usually takes place via foods such as raw milk. Infection of farmers or veterinarians is also possible when assisting cows during parturition or when handling aborted material. In Austria, during the last decade, between 1 and 7 imported cases per year were found in humans. In 2018, 2 cases of brucellosis have been reported in humans.\n\nBrucellosis is a very rare disease in humans and animals in Austria. The incubation period of brucellosis is usually 1 to 2 months. Up to 90 percent of all infections are without disease symptoms; infection can only be detected by testing for specific antibodies in the patient, they are an expression of an effective immune defense.\n\nIn acute [human] brucellosis, early symptoms are fatigue, mild fever, headache and body aches. After a short, symptom-free interval, flu-like symptoms may appear, which do not stop after 7 to 10 days, as is usual with influenza.\n\nA typical indicator of brucellosis infection are elevated evening temperature (up to 40 C [104 F]) associated with excessive sweating. The disease can be treated with antibiotics.\n\nIn Austria, the cattle population (since 1999) and the sheep and goat populations (since 2001) are officially recognized free of this pathogen. The control of this animal disease in the present case focuses on the detection, isolation and culling of the infected animals as well as on the control of animal movements in order to avoid the spread of the pathogen. The milk from the affected farm has not caused any risk to consumers, since it is consistently undergone the compulsory pasteurization.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nSabine Zentis\nCastleview English Longhorns\nGut Laach\nD-52385 Nideggen\nGermany\nhttp://www.cvlonghorns.de\n<cvlonghorns@aol.com>\n\n\n[According to the media, about 50 percent of the 100 milking cows on the affected holding are infected.

Here's the short version of the story:\n\nA dog in the Netherlands developed fever, ascites (fluid free in the abdomen), and inflammation of the testicles. After failing to respond to antibiotics, it was taken to surgery to be neutered. In the process, culture samples were collected from the epididymis (tissue adjacent to the testicle) and from the abdominal fluid. _B. suis_ was identified in both samples, which presumably caused a bit stir in the lab and the clinic since this bacterium is rarely identified, can also infect people and is federally notifiable in the Netherlands (that is, the government has to be contacted when it's found). Ultimately, the dog was euthanized after failing to respond to further treatment.\n\nBecause this is a notifiable disease, there was an investigation. The dog did not have any of the typical exposures that would increase the risk of _Brucella_ infection, such as contact with wildlife or livestock, breeding, or travel to brucellosis-endemic areas. The dog's raw, rabbit-based diet that was imported from Argentina therefore became the leading suspected source. _B. suis_ was ultimately identified in samples from a 30 000 kg batch of raw rabbit imported from Argentina, a country where _B. suis_ is present.\n\nIt's a single case report so we can't get too worked up about it, but it's noteworthy for a couple reasons:\n\nReason 1 is the disease -- brucellosis is a nasty. It can be hard to treat, is potentially zoonotic, and sometimes results in public health-mandated euthanasia of the dog.\n\nReason 2 is the importation aspect. The dog wasn't imported but the bacterium was, via food. We're trying to increase awareness of the need to query travel and importation history in pets, as it can significantly impact disease risks. Querying diet origins is even tougher. While most people know where their dog has been in the past few weeks, they may not know much about where their dog's diet has been. With commercial processed food, it's not a big deal, but with higher-risk food like raw meat, importing food can be similar to the dog visiting the country of origin, from a disease standpoint. With raw meat, knowing where the meat came from and the disease risks in those areas may be important, but often not easy to find out.\n\nThe incidence of disease in dogs and cats associated with raw meat feeding isn't clear, and is probably low. Nevertheless, I recommend avoiding raw meat feeding, especially in high risk households (such as those with elderly individuals, kids less than 5 years of age, pregnant women, or immunocompromised individuals). However, if raw meat is to be fed, some basic precautions can used to help reduce the risks. For details, see the raw meat infosheet on the Worms & Germs Resources - Pets page (https://www.wormsandgermsblog.com/files/2008/04/M2-Raw-Meat-Owner1.pdf).\n\n[Byline: Scott Weese]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[For the full version of the referred Dutch report see ref 1 below.\n\nAbstract\n--------\n'A _Brucella suis_ biovar 1 infection was diagnosed in a dog without typical exposure risks, but the dog had been fed a raw meat-based diet (hare carcasses imported from Argentina).

To our knowledge, no human infections were linked to this case.\n\n'_B. suis_ biovar 1 is a potential threat to the pig farming industry because introduction of _B. suis_ into pig herds can have substantial economic consequences. A striking detail is that the last _B. suis_ infection in pigs in the Netherlands (1969) was associated with swill feeding of hares imported from Argentina.\n\n'In response to our findings, preventive measures were implemented (such as, sampling of imported raw meat and communication of risk to international authorities and raw-feed suppliers). This case stresses the microbiological risks for humans and animals of feeding raw meat-based diets, which has become increasingly popular among pet owners.

The disease is primarily transmitted through contact with infected birth tissues and fluids.\n\nMore information about Brucellosis and the Targeted Elk Brucellosis Surveillance project can be found online at:\nhttp://fwp.mt.gov/fishAndWildlife/diseasesAndResearch/healthPrograms/brucellosis/.\n\n[Byline: Ricky Blackburn]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Brucellosis is a zoonotic disease, and in many places around the world, it still causes severe infections in humans. Brucellosis also causes decreased milk production, weight loss, abortion, and infertility in cattle. For these reasons, beginning in the mid-1950s, great efforts were made to eliminate the disease from all livestock within the United States. While these efforts were successful at eliminating transmission within cattle nation-wide, sporadic transmission from wildlife to cattle in and around the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem has been on the increase. Brucellosis can result in serious financial burdens to cattle producers, potentially resulting in quarantine of a herd, increased testing and vaccination costs, and possible difficulty in trade with other states and countries.\n\nAlthough the disease can cause abortions in elk, measurable population effects on population size or trend due to brucellosis have not been documented. However, the potential for transmission to livestock results in decreased acceptance of elk on private property which, in many areas, constitutes a large proportion of elk winter range. Historically, rates of exposure in elk (measured by blood tests) have been very low (below 2 percent in the early 1990's) and limited in distribution. Recent research and surveillance efforts have indicated that the prevalence and geographical distribution of the disease in elk is likely increasing. Brucellosis now exists in elk populations outside of the Greater Yellowstone Area. Hunters and game processors should take precautions (gloves and good hygiene) when handling reproductive and/or fetal material from hunter-harvested elk and bison.\n\nPortions of this comment extracted from: http://fwp.mt.gov/fishAndWildlife/diseasesAndResearch/healthPrograms/brucellosis/.\n\nThis map provides and aerial view of the Tendoy Mountains https://mapcarta.com/23709406, and a HealthMap/ProMED-mail map of Montana, United States, can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/228.\n- Mod.TG]", "summary": "A ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n Communicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Brucellosis is a zoonotic disease, and in many places around the world, it still causes severe infections in humans. \n\n'The discovery of an exposed elk in the Tendoys emphasizes the importance of elk surveillance near the boundary of the DSA [designated surveillance area - Mod. \n\nBrucellosis is a bacterial disease that infects cattle, bison, and elk and can result in abortion or the birth of weak calves. \n\nMore information about Brucellosis and the Targeted Elk Brucellosis Surveillance project can be found online at:\n However, the potential for transmission to livestock results in decreased acceptance of elk on private property which, in many areas, constitutes a large proportion of elk winter range.

CDC's Bacterial Special Pathogens Branch (BSPB) confirmed the isolate as _Brucella abortus_ vaccine strain RB51 (RB51).\n\nBrucellosis is a zoonotic bacterial disease that affects humans and many animal species. In humans, the disease is characterized by fever and nonspecific influenza-like symptoms that frequently include myalgia, arthralgia, and night sweats. Without appropriate treatment, brucellosis can become chronic, and life-threatening complications can arise. Human brucellosis transmitted by cattle was once common in the United States. Control strategies have focused on elimination of brucellosis through vaccination and surveillance of cattle herds, in addition to milk pasteurization. Because of these measures, domestically acquired human cases are now rare (1).\n\nRB51, a live-attenuated vaccine used to prevent _B. abortus_ infection in cattle, has been documented to cause human disease, most commonly through occupational exposures such as needle sticks (2). Importantly, unlike wild strains of _B. abortus_, RB51 does not stimulate an antibody response detectable by routine serological assays, requiring culture for confirmation. Additionally, RB51 is resistant to rifampin, a common treatment choice for human brucellosis (2,3). This case represents the 1st documented instance of human brucellosis caused by RB51 through consumption of raw milk acquired in the USA.\n\nFollowing isolation of RB51 from the patient's blood, bulk milk tank samples from the farm tested positive for RB51 by polymerase chain reaction and bacterial culture. Culture of individual milk samples from all 43 cows in the herd identified 2 RB51 culture-positive cows. Subsequent whole genome sequencing indicated genetic relatedness between the cow and human isolate.\n\nIn Texas, farm sales of raw milk products to the public are legal with a 'Grade 'A' Raw for Retail' license, regulated by the DSHS Milk and Dairy Group. By the end of August [2017], through correspondence with the dairy, DSHS had identified approximately 800 persons who might have visited the farm during [1 Jun 2017 to 7 Aug 2017]. On [1 Sep 2017], Texas DSHS and BSPB began notification calls to these households, recommending that all exposed persons (i.e., those who consumed raw milk products from the farm during [1 Jun 2017 to 7 Aug 2017]) seek medical attention and begin 3 weeks of postexposure prophylaxis, even if asymptomatic (4).\n\nContact information was available for 582 households. The notification was issued successfully to 397 (68.2 percent) households. Among these notified households, 324 (81.6 percent) identified at least 1 exposed household member. Contacted persons referred 34 additional potentially exposed households, including households from 7 other states (Alabama, Arkansas, California, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, and Tennessee). A nationwide press release and Health Alert Network Health Advisory were issued in September to facilitate further identification of exposed persons (5).\n\nTo date, there are no other confirmed cases associated with this investigation. CDC and Texas DSHS continue measures to increase awareness among health care providers and the public regarding unique challenges associated with treatment and diagnosis of RB51 in humans and the risks of consuming raw milk.\n\nReferences\n----------\n1.

This was the first of 2, presumably unrelated cases, of strain RB51 causing human infections related to the ingestion of unpasteurized milk, the other occurred in New Jersey and is listed in the 'see alsos'. This report does not even mention the NJ case.\n\nRegarding human exposures to the _Brucella abortus_ RB51 vaccine, this 2004 report outlined 26 exposures, none related to milk.\n\nAshford DA, di Pietra J, Lingappa J, et al: Adverse events in humans associated with accidental exposure to the livestock brucellosis vaccine RB51. Vaccine. 2004;22(25-26):3435-9.\n\nAbstract\n--------\n'_Brucella abortus_ strain RB51 vaccine, is an attenuated live bacterial vaccine that was licensed conditionally by the Center for Veterinary Biologics, Veterinary Services, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, USDA, on 23 Feb 1996, for vaccination of cattle in the USA. Accidental human inoculations can occur during vaccination of cattle, and previous live brucella vaccines designed for cattle have been known to cause brucellosis in humans. The CDC established passive surveillance for accidental inoculation with the RB51 vaccine in the USA to determine if this veterinary vaccine is associated with human disease, to describe the circumstances of accidental inoculation, to evaluate the potential efficacy of post-exposure chemoprophylaxis, and to develop recommendations for post-exposure management following exposure to RB51. Reports were received from 26 individuals. Accidental exposure to RB51 occurred by needle stick injury in 21 people (81 percent), conjunctival spray exposure in 4 (15 percent), and spray exposure of an open wound in one (4 percent) individual. At least one systemic symptom was reported in 19 (73 percent) people, including 3 (12 percent) who reported persistent local reactions with systemic involvement. One case required surgery, and _B. abortus_ strain RB51 was isolated from the wound of that individual. A total of 7 cases reported no adverse events associated with accidental exposure. As many as 9 cases reported previous exposure to brucella vaccines, including one case who also reported a previous diagnosis of brucellosis following exposure to S19 vaccine. Accidental needle stick injuries and conjunctival or open wound exposures of humans with the RB51 vaccine are associated with both local and systemic adverse events in the USA that are consistent with brucellosis; however, it remains undetermined if strain RB51 vaccine can cause systemic brucellosis in humans. Early culture attempts on those exposed and developing disease in the future and serologic diagnostic assays for anti-RB-51 antibodies are needed to define if these adverse events are due to RB51 and to define appropriate prophylaxis regimens.'\n\nRegarding brucella vaccine strains in milk, this appears to be uncommon and it is not clear if human transmission of the vaccine strain has occurred from unpasteurized milk:\n\n1. Miranda KL, Poester FP, Dorneles EM, et al: _Brucella abortus_ RB51 in milk of vaccinated adult cattle. Acta Trop. 2016;160: 58-61.\n\nAbstract\n--------\n'The aim of this study was to evaluate the shedding of _Brucella abortus_ in the milk of cows vaccinated with a full dose of RB51 during lactation. A total of 18 cows, 9 previously vaccinated with S19 as calves and 9 non-vaccinated, were immunized subcutaneously with 1.3 x10(exp10)CFU of _B. abortus_ RB51, 30-60 days after parturition. Milk samples from all animals were collected daily until day 7, and at weekly interval for the next 9 weeks after vaccination. To evaluate the shedding of _B. abortus_, milk samples were submitted for culture and PCR. No _B. abortus_ was isolated from any sample tested. Only one sample, collected on 1st day after vaccination from a cow previously vaccinated, was faintly positive in the PCR. In conclusion, the public health hazard associated with milk consumption from cows vaccinated with RB51 in post-partum is very low, despite vaccination with the full dose and regardless of previous S19 vaccination.'\n\n2.

Braz J Microbiol. 2012;: 594-601\n\nAbstract\n--------\n'This paper aimed to determine the excretion period of B19 vaccine strain during a complete reproductive cycle (from estrus synchronization, artificial insemination, pregnancy and until 30 days after parturition) of dairy cows from 3 to 9-years-old that were previously vaccinated from 3 to 8 months. Three groups were monitored with monthly milk and urine collection during 12 months: G1 with 7 cows from 3 to 4-years-old; G2 with 3 cows from 5 to 6-years-old; and G3 with 4 cows from 7 to 9-years-old. Urine and milk samples were submitted to bacteriological culture and urine and PCR reactions for detection of _Brucella spp._ and PCR-multiplex for B19 strain identification. Ring test (RT) was also performed in the milk samples, and serum samples were tested by buffered acidified plate antigen test (BAPA). All animals were serologically negative at BAPA and _Brucella spp._ was not isolated from both urine and milk samples. RT revealed 13/210 (6.2 percent) positive milk samples. PCR reactions detected DNA of _Brucella spp._ in 86/420 (20.5 percent) samples.

Accidental needle stick injuries and conjunctival or open wound exposures of humans with the RB51 vaccine are associated with both local and systemic adverse events in the USA that are consistent with brucellosis; however, it remains undetermined if strain RB51 vaccine can cause systemic brucellosis in humans. The CDC established passive surveillance for accidental inoculation with the RB51 vaccine in the USA to determine if this veterinary vaccine is associated with human disease, to describe the circumstances of accidental inoculation, to evaluate the potential efficacy of post-exposure chemoprophylaxis, and to develop recommendations for post-exposure management following exposure to RB51.

This paper aimed to determine the excretion period of B19 vaccine strain during a complete reproductive cycle (from estrus synchronization, artificial insemination, pregnancy and until 30 days after parturition) of dairy cows from 3 to 9-years-old that were previously vaccinated from 3 to 8 months. Accidental exposure to RB51 occurred by needle stick injury in 21 people (81 percent), conjunctival spray exposure in 4 (15 percent), and spray exposure of an open wound in one (4 percent) individual. In conclusion, the public health hazard associated with milk consumption from cows vaccinated with RB51 in post-partum is very low, despite vaccination with the full dose and regardless of previous S19 vaccination.'\n\n2. In July 2017, the Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS) Region 2/3 office reported a human case of brucellosis associated with the consumption of raw (unpasteurized) cow's milk purchased from a dairy in Paradise, Texas. \n\nRB51, a live-attenuated vaccine used to prevent _B. abortus_ infection in cattle, has been documented to cause human disease, most commonly through occupational exposures such as needle sticks (2). As many as 9 cases reported previous exposure to brucella vaccines, including one case who also reported a previous diagnosis of brucellosis following exposure to S19 vaccine.

Culture of individual milk samples from all 43 cows in the herd identified 2 RB51 culture-positive cows. CDC: Brucellosis: exposure to RB51 through raw milk or milk products: how to reduce risk of infection. Regarding human exposures to the _Brucella abortus_ RB51 vaccine, this 2004 report outlined 26 exposures, none related to milk. In Texas, farm sales of raw milk products to the public are legal with a 'Grade 'A' Raw for Retail' license, regulated by the DSHS Milk and Dairy Group. Urine and milk samples were submitted to bacteriological culture and urine and PCR reactions for detection of _Brucella spp._ and PCR-multiplex for B19 strain identification. A total of 18 cows, 9 previously vaccinated with S19 as calves and 9 non-vaccinated, were immunized subcutaneously with 1.3 x10(exp10)CFU of _B. abortus_ RB51, 30-60 days after parturition. This was the first of 2, presumably unrelated cases, of strain RB51 causing human infections related to the ingestion of unpasteurized milk, the other occurred in New Jersey and is listed in the 'see alsos'. Accidental human inoculations can occur during vaccination of cattle, and previous live brucella vaccines designed for cattle have been known to cause brucellosis in humans.

Middle- to late-term abortion, stillbirths, and the delivery of weak offspring are the characteristic clinical signs of the disease that is associated with an extensive negative impact in a flock's productivity. _B. melitensis_ is also the most virulent _Brucella_ species for humans, responsible for a severely debilitating and disabling illness that results in high morbidity with intermittent fever, chills, sweats, weakness, myalgia, abortion, osteoarticular complications, endocarditis, depression, anorexia, and low mortality. Historical observations indicate that goats have been the hosts of _B. melitensis_ for centuries; but around 1905, the Greek physician Themistokles Zammit was able to build the epidemiological link between 'Malta fever' and the consumption of goat milk. While the disease has been successfully managed in most industrialized countries, it remains a significant burden on goat and human health in the Mediterranean region, the Middle East, Central and Southeast Asia (including India and China), sub-Saharan Africa, and certain areas in Latin America, where approximately 3.5 billion people live at risk. In this review, we describe a historical evolution of the disease, highlight the current worldwide distribution, and estimate (by simple formula) the approximate costs of brucellosis outbreaks to meat- and milk-producing farms and the economic losses associated with the disease in humans. Successful control leading to eradication of caprine brucellosis in the developing world will require a coordinated Global One Health approach involving active involvement of human and animal health efforts to enhance public health and improve livestock productivity.'\n\nMaps of Paraguay can be seen at http://www.nationsonline.org/maps/paraguay-administrative-map.jpg and http://healthmap.org/promed/p/4191.

ABORTUS VACCINE STRAIN, ALERT, REQUEST FOR INFORMATION\n********************************************************************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Tue 21 Nov 2017\nSource: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] News Release [edited]\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2017/p1121-contaminated-raw-milk.html\n\n\nFor the 2nd time in 3 months, CDC is warning people who might have consumed contaminated raw milk and milk products to visit their doctor. People who bought and drank raw milk from a company called Udder Milk may have been infected with a rare but potentially serious bacterium called _Brucella abortus_ RB51. While brucellosis can cause anyone to become sick, women may suffer miscarriage and other pregnancy complications, making it critical for pregnant women who may have consumed the raw milk from Udder Milk to seek medical care immediately.\n\nIn late September 2017, a New Jersey woman became ill after drinking raw milk from the company. CDC confirmed that her illness was _Brucella_ RB51 in late October 2017. Because Udder Milk has not provided information about the farms that supply their milk, it has not been possible to trace the source of the woman's infection. CDC scientists have been collaborating with state health officials on the investigation. The Department of Agriculture and the Food and Drug Administration are working with state health and agriculture officials to trace the source of the contaminated raw milk and raw milk products.\n\nUntil more information is available about which farms may be supplying contaminated milk or until officials can test milk from the farms, CDC recommends that anyone who drank raw milk or consumed raw milk products from Udder Milk in the past 6 months visit their doctor for antimicrobials to prevent illness. Information suggests that the company delivers milk in Connecticut, New Jersey, New York and Rhode Island.\n\n'Because health officials have no direct way to let people know they may have drunk contaminated milk, everyone who consumed milk from Udder Milk in the past 6 months should receive therapy now to avoid having long-term health effects from the bacterium,' said William Bower, MD, team lead for the CDC group that investigates brucellosis, the illness caused by RB51.\n\nThe New Jersey patient is the 2d known domestically acquired illness caused by _Brucella_ RB51 in raw milk in the USA in 2017; the other was in Texas in July 2017. The Texas and New Jersey incidents are not connected.\n\nThe locations of the farms supplying Udder Milk are not known. Neither are the places where the company sells and distributes raw milk and other products. Online information about Udder Milk points to members-only websites through which people purchase raw milk online and delivery sites that shift to avoid detection by public health officials. Selling and distributing raw milk and raw dairy products is illegal in New Jersey, and selling it outside of the farm that produces it is illegal in New York. Farms that sell raw milk in New York also must have a permit to sell it.\n\nAll people who consumed raw milk and raw milk products from Udder Milk should seek medical care and start treatment to prevent future chronic disease from RB51. The RB51 strain is resistant to some antimicrobials that would normally be used to prevent or treat brucellosis. Therefore, people who consumed raw milk from Udder Milk should tell their doctor that they may have been exposed to this particular strain. Doctors can learn more about testing patients for RB51 and which antibiotics to employ to prevent or cure infection at https://www.cdc.gov/brucellosis/clinicians/rb51-raw-milk.html.\n\nPeople who have consumed the milk and other products made from Udder Milk raw milk should check themselves daily for fever for one month after they last drank the milk and watch for other brucellosis symptoms for 6 months. These symptoms include muscle pain, lasting fatigue, arthritis, depression, and swelling of the testicles. Untreated _B. abortus_ RB51 infection can result in long-term health problems like arthritis; heart problems; enlargement of the spleen or liver; and, in rare cases, nervous system problems like meningitis. RB51 can cause severe illness in people with weakened immune systems and miscarriages in pregnant women.\n\nRB51 is a weakened strain of _Brucella abortus_ bacteria used to vaccinate young female cattle. Intensive vaccination campaigns have nearly eradicated _B. abortus_, which can cause abortions in cattle. The bovine vaccine reduces the risk of people contracting brucellosis from infected cows. However, in rare cases, vaccinated cows can shed RB51 in their milk. The only way to avoid this potential exposure to RB51 is to drink pasteurized milk. The heat of pasteurization kills RB51, other types of _Brucella_, and a variety of other disease-causing bacteria.\n\nHuman brucellosis cases in the USA have fallen from about 3000 per year in the 1950s to 100-150 per year in recent years. Most cases of brucellosis in the USA are caused by strains other than _B. abortus_ and occur in people who traveled to countries where the bacterium is more common and drank contaminated milk or had contact with infected animals. Among cases who acquired brucellosis in the USA, infections occur from contact with feral swine or, more rarely, dogs, or because of accidental exposures among lab workers testing samples from ill people.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail rapporteur Mary Marshall\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Since the initial report of the Texas case, little information has emerged about other cases in Texas or other states, although CDC published 'Exposure to RB51 through Raw Milk or Milk Products: How to Reduce Risk of Infection' (https://www.cdc.gov/brucellosis/clinicians/rb51-raw-milk.html):\n\n'People who have consumed raw milk or raw milk products that are potentially contaminated with RB51 are at high risk for brucellosis infection. For these people, symptom monitoring and antibiotics to prevent infection (also called post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP)) is recommended.\n\n'PEP for RB51 should include:\n- doxycycline, in addition to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or another suitable antimicrobial, for 21 days. Those with contraindications to doxycycline or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole should consult with their health care provider.\n\n'Prophylaxis for exposure to _Brucella_ species other than RB51 routinely consists of a combination of doxycycline and rifampin. RB51, however, is resistant to rifampin in vitro and to penicillin, so rifampin and penicillin are not recommended.\n\n'Symptom monitoring\n------------------\nRoutine serologic tests for brucellosis are not effective for diagnosing or monitoring RB51 infections. So those at high risk should be monitored for the development of symptoms of brucellosis. Monitoring should include:\n- for 4 weeks from last exposure, check temperature for fever\n- for 6 months from last exposure, watch for broader symptoms of brucellosis\n\nPeople potentially exposed to RB51 who develop symptoms should consult a health care provider.\n\nIf brucellosis occurs despite prophylaxis, treatment regimens should be selected based on antimicrobial susceptibility results.'\n\nThe RB51 vaccine is called an attenuated strain; it is not clear to me how this relates to humans. The following publications seem to address this point, but more recent information seems lacking, ProMED-mail would appreciate more information in this regard and how it relates to the illness presenting in people infected with RB51:\n\nAshford DA, di Pietra J, Lingappa J, et al. Adverse events in humans associated with accidental exposure to the livestock brucellosis vaccine RB51. Vaccine. 2004 Sep 3;22: 3435-3439.\n\nAbstract:\n_Brucella abortus_ strain RB51 vaccine, is an attenuated live bacterial vaccine that was licensed conditionally by the Center for Veterinary Biologics, Veterinary Services, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, USDA, on 23 Feb 1996, for vaccination of cattle in the USA. Accidental human inoculations can occur during vaccination of cattle, and previous live _Brucella_ vaccines designed for cattle have been known to cause brucellosis in humans. The CDC established passive surveillance for accidental inoculation with the RB51 vaccine in the USA to determine if this veterinary vaccine is associated with human disease, to describe the circumstances of accidental inoculation, to evaluate the potential efficacy of post-exposure chemoprophylaxis, and to develop recommendations for post-exposure management following exposure to RB51. Reports were received from 26 individuals. Accidental exposure to RB51 occurred by needle stick injury in 21 people (81 per cent), conjunctival spray exposure in 4 (15 per cent), and spray exposure of an open wound in 1 (4 per cent) individual. At least one systemic symptom was reported in 19 (73 per cent) people, including 3 (12 per cent) who reported persistent local reactions with systemic involvement. One case required surgery, and _B. abortus_ strain RB51 was isolated from the wound of that individual. Seven cases reported no adverse event associated with accidental exposure. Nine cases reported previous exposure to _Brucella_ vaccines, including one case who also reported a previous diagnosis of brucellosis following exposure to S19 vaccine. Accidental needle stick injuries and conjunctival or open wound exposures of humans with the RB51 vaccine are associated with both local and systemic adverse events in the USA that are consistent with brucellosis; however, it remains undetermined if strain RB51 vaccine can cause systemic brucellosis in humans. Early culture attempts on those exposed and developing disease in the future and serologic diagnostic assays for anti-RB-51 antibodies are needed to define if these adverse events are due to RB51 and to define appropriate prophylaxis.\n\nCDC: Human exposure to Brucella abortus strain RB51--Kansas, 1997. MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep. 1998 Mar 13;47: 172-175.\n\nAbstract:\nOn 26-27 May 1997, 9 persons (a farmer, 4 veterinary clinicians, and 4 veterinary students) in Manhattan, Kansas, participated in an attempted vaginal delivery, a caesarean delivery, and a necropsy on a stillborn calf that died because of _Brucella abortus_ infection. The infection was confirmed by isolation of _B. abortus_ from placental and fetal lung tissue cultures. The National Animal Disease Center, Department of Agriculture (USDA), identified the _B. abortus_ isolate from the calf as the RB51 vaccine strain. RB51 is a live, attenuated strain that was licensed conditionally by the Veterinary Services, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, USDA, on 23 Feb 1996, for vaccination of cattle in the USA.

Monitoring should include:\n- for 4 weeks from last exposure, check temperature for fever\n- for 6 months from last exposure, watch for broader symptoms of brucellosis\n\nPeople potentially exposed to RB51 who develop symptoms should consult a health care provider.

The Department of Agriculture and the Food and Drug Administration are working with state health and agriculture officials to trace the source of the contaminated raw milk and raw milk products. People who bought and drank raw milk from a company called Udder Milk may have been infected with a rare but potentially serious bacterium called _Brucella abortus_ RB51. While brucellosis can cause anyone to become sick, women may suffer miscarriage and other pregnancy complications, making it critical for pregnant women who may have consumed the raw milk from Udder Milk to seek medical care immediately. BRUCELLOSIS - USA (16): (NEW JERSEY) RAW MILK, B. ABORTUS VACCINE STRAIN, ALERT, REQUEST FOR INFORMATION\n Accidental needle stick injuries and conjunctival or open wound exposures of humans with the RB51 vaccine are associated with both local and systemic adverse events in the USA that are consistent with brucellosis; however, it remains undetermined if strain RB51 vaccine can cause systemic brucellosis in humans. The CDC established passive surveillance for accidental inoculation with the RB51 vaccine in the USA to determine if this veterinary vaccine is associated with human disease, to describe the circumstances of accidental inoculation, to evaluate the potential efficacy of post-exposure chemoprophylaxis, and to develop recommendations for post-exposure management following exposure to RB51. Online information about Udder Milk points to members-only websites through which people purchase raw milk online and delivery sites that shift to avoid detection by public health officials. Therefore, people who consumed raw milk from Udder Milk should tell their doctor that they may have been exposed to this particular strain. Accidental exposure to RB51 occurred by needle stick injury in 21 people (81 per cent), conjunctival spray exposure in 4 (15 per cent), and spray exposure of an open wound in 1 (4 per cent) individual.

Abstract:\n_Brucella abortus_ strain RB51 vaccine, is an attenuated live bacterial vaccine that was licensed conditionally by the Center for Veterinary Biologics, Veterinary Services, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, USDA, on 23 Feb 1996, for vaccination of cattle in the USA. \n\nThe New Jersey patient is the 2d known domestically acquired illness caused by _Brucella_ RB51 in raw milk in the USA in 2017; the other was in Texas in July 2017. Nine cases reported previous exposure to _Brucella_ vaccines, including one case who also reported a previous diagnosis of brucellosis following exposure to S19 vaccine. Selling and distributing raw milk and raw dairy products is illegal in New Jersey, and selling it outside of the farm that produces it is illegal in New York. \n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail rapporteur Mary Marshall\n< Because Udder Milk has not provided information about the farms that supply their milk, it has not been possible to trace the source of the woman's infection.

While rare, people can become infected by eating or drinking contaminated raw milk products. A brucellosis infection can cause a range of symptoms including fever, sweats, chills, weight loss, headache, fatigue and muscle and joint pain. Symptoms may appear up to 6 months after exposure. In severe cases, infections of the central nervous system or lining of the heart may occur.\n\nPeople who may have consumed contaminated milk should see a doctor right away. _Brucella_ RB51 cannot be diagnosed through tests commonly used to diagnose the disease, and this strain is resistant to one of the antimicrobials commonly used to treat brucellosis in people.\n\nFrom 1993 through 2012, 127 outbreaks linked to raw milk were reported to CDC, resulting in 1909 illnesses and 144 hospitalizations.

Symptoms in people include high undulating fevers and joint and muscle pain that can persist for years. As a result, brucellosis poses a substantial economic and health burden on Nepal's herders who seasonally move long distances with their animals, said Jackson. Despite years of research, neither the distribution nor the economic and public health impact of the disease in Nepal's mountainous regions had been well characterized, Jackson noted.\n\nThus, Jackson assessed the burden, prevalence and distribution of brucellosis in domestic yak and their herders in the mountain region of Nepal's Shey Phoksumdo National Park. With funding from Cornell's College of Veterinary Medicine's Expanding Horizons program, which supported field research in Nepal, among other sources, Jackson visited Nepal's Yak Breeding Station in Syangboche and toured veterinary facilities and colleges in Kathmandu with Nepalese veterinarians and veterinary students. His research provides information that may help to improve the lives of animals and people in the region.\n\nJackson's project involved 8 weeks in remote regions of Nepal that required large animal clinical skills, psychological and physical stamina, and a great measure of patience, Jackson said. He walked for approximately 45 days employing a donkey team and a small research team including a guide and translator. His group was self-sufficient, carrying and purchasing supplies as needed while on the move.

'In the United States, we are fortunate to have systems in place that reduce the risk of disease transmission,' said Jackson. 'In rural Nepal, knowledge about basic food safety and disease transmission is lacking. Small, simple changes based on the identification of risk stand to make a large impact.

As a result, brucellosis poses a substantial economic and health burden on Nepal's herders who seasonally move long distances with their animals, said Jackson.

An investigation found 2 cows in K-Bar Dairy's herd were shedding _Brucella_ bacteria in their milk. The bacteria appear in the raw milk of infected animals like cows and goats. It is the most common source of human infection from drinking unpasteurized milk products. Subsequent testing has shown no further evidence of bacteria in K-bar's milk or equipment, the Texas Department of State Health Services confirmed in an update Wed 11 Oct 2017.\n\nK-Bar Dairy is a small, family-operated dairy farm in Wise County that produces around 120 gallons per day of raw milk, a type of milk that has not been pasteurized to kill microorganisms. Licensed raw milk distributors like K-Bar are only permitted to sell their milk and milk products on the farm; the products are not available in stores.\n\n'Milk is our livelihood,' says K-Bar owner Kim Lambert. She and her husband, Jeff, have been in the business several decades without incident. 'Then something like this happens,' she said Wednesday [11 Oct 2017] with a sigh. 'We're slowly starting to pick back up. But it'll take a while to earn the public's trust,' she said. Lambert said the 2 cows that were infected with _Brucella_ had to be put down.\n\nIn August 2017, a recall was issued on K-Bar's raw milk after a person who drank the product was hospitalized with symptoms of fever, joint pain and fatigue. Laboratory testing later confirmed the same strain of _Brucella_ in milk samples collected at the dairy and in the infected individual. The company is now clear to resume sales, but state health officials will periodically test its milk for _Brucella_ for up to a year.\n\n[Byline: Sabriya Rice]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The following is extracted from a CDC News Release from 15 Sep 2017 regarding the episode\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2017/p0915-raw-milk-brucella.html, which seems to be the last public notice about it. It is unclear whether any additional cases of human brucellosis did occur in Texas or other states. ProMED would like information in this regard, although according to the EpiCore participant submission from Tennessee below, one of the states listed below may be a 2nd case. There may be others.\n\n'Milk from K-Bar dairy is known to have caused _Brucella_ infection in one Texas resident. An illness in a Texas woman has been linked to the dairy. Purchase records and illness reports indicate additional people in Texas and some as far away as California and North Dakota may need antimicrobials to prevent or treat infection. In Texas, raw milk is only allowed to be sold on site at the dairy. According to Texas DHSH, K-Bar dairy has been operating in compliance with state dairy laws and rules and is cooperating fully with the investigation.\n\nCDC and Texas health officials have been trying to reach people in more than 800 households known to have purchased K-Bar raw milk. Texas is following up with 170; CDC tried to contact the remaining 672 households, but many did not provide contact information. Of the 485 households with contact information, CDC successfully reached 236 households. Among the 236 households, 83 percent of people were exposed to RB51 by drinking the milk. Due to incomplete contact information, CDC staff have been unable to reach about 200 households in which someone bought K-Bar milk. People who sampled the milk at the dairy or got the milk from friends or family also may not be aware of their risk. So far, CDC and Texas health officials have received reports about people who drank K-Bar milk or have symptoms consistent with brucellosis caused by RB51 in Alabama, Arkansas, California, Ohio, North Dakota, Tennessee and Texas.\n\nAbout RB51\n----------\nRB51 is a weakened strain of _B. abortus_ used to vaccinate young female cattle against infection with more serious strains of _Brucella_. Vaccinating cows with the RB51 vaccine helps prevent abortions in cows and reduces the risk of people coming into contact with cows infected with more severe strains. However, in rare cases, vaccinated cows can shed RB51 in their milk.\n\nTesting of milk from the individual cows in the dairy herd revealed 2 cows that were infected with _B. abortus_ RB51, supporting the conclusion that these cows are a source of RB51 contamination of the dairy's raw milk. Testing is ongoing by Texas officials to assure that the remaining cows in the herd do not pose an ongoing risk of RB51 contamination of the dairy's raw milk. The only way to avoid this potential exposure is to drink milk that has been pasteurized to kill the germs.\n\nBrucellosis is rare in the USA, largely due to our vaccination practices in cattle to prevent brucellosis. There are about 120 reported cases in people each year. Most cases of brucellosis in the USA occur in people who traveled to countries where brucellosis is more common and drank contaminated cow, sheep or goat milk or had contact with infected animals. Among cases in the USA who acquired brucellosis here, infections occur from contact with feral swine or, more rarely, dogs, or because of accidental exposure in lab settings.\n\nRaw Milk: a Risk for Infections\n-----------------------\nRaw milk and raw milk products are those that have not undergone a process called pasteurization that kills disease-causing germs. CDC recommends that people only drink milk that has been pasteurized to kill germs. Even healthy animals may carry germs that can contaminate milk. There is no substitute for pasteurization to assure that milk is safe to drink. The risk of getting sick from drinking raw milk is greater for infants and young children, the elderly, pregnant women, and people with weakened immune systems, such as people with cancer, an organ transplant, or HIV/AIDS. However, healthy people of any age can get very sick if they drink raw milk contaminated with harmful germs.' - Mod.LL]\n\n******\n[2] EpiCore Report\nDate: Thu 12 Oct 2017\nSource: EpiCore Global Surveillance Project [edited]\n\n\nOn approximately 1 Sep 2017, _Brucella_ (species not known) was cultured from a patient at Regional One Medical Center in Memphis, TN.

Despite significant symptoms, doctors didn't immediately diagnose that the Wheatland, WY farmer [J] had been infected with the human form of the animal disease brucellosis. Perhaps that's because it is rare in people, and its various symptoms don't point to an obvious cause.\n\nUndulant fever, also called Bang's disease, is marked by an irregular pattern of joint pain, fatigue, headaches, high fever, chills, drenching sweats, backache, weight loss, and loss of appetite. The farmer experienced a lot of that. Lasting effects include arthritis, depression, and organ swelling, the U.S. Department of Agriculture says.\n\nWhile few people die from undulant fever, it can be chronic, and hence 'is too serious to be dealt with lightly,' the federal agency says. The farmer's tale of infection and suffering underscores one reason why federal and state officials targeted the disease for eradication more than 60 years ago. 'I just knew I was sick,' the farmer said. 'I had pain like no other, indescribable pain between my hips. I had it in my back. It really hurt, an area as big as a cantaloupe or watermelon.'\n\nHe spent 9 days in a hospital as doctors poked, prodded, and tested. 'They did a CAT scan or X-ray to figure out whether I had kidney stones,' he said. 'Doctors didn't know what was going on.' Almost 3 months later, still undiagnosed and out of the hospital, the farmer fell on an icy walk and broke a rib. The pain from that injury did something funny; in time, it migrated to the opposite side of his body from the fracture. J went back to the hospital. The infection 'landed in my spine,' he said. 'It's a real sharp pain. It's not directed to any one spot.'\n\n'They did another CAT scan and sent me straight to the neurosurgeons,' he said. An infectious-disease specialist made the diagnosis. 'The doctor called me and said, 'You've got brucellosis.' They finally got the culture and finally got it right.'\n\nUndulant fever used to be far more widespread; 6400 cases were reported in 1947. A federal and state eradication program begun that same year has cut those to about 100 reported cases a year. Most cases, J said, probably involve large-animal veterinarians. To prevent infection, farmers and ranchers should wear sturdy rubber gloves when aiding stock during birthing; hunters should do the same when field-dressing game. Raw milk and unpasteurized milk products also can spread the disease.\n\n'It's not certain where I got it,' the farmer said. 'It's untraceable.' Connecting the dots that lead to an infection can be difficult, even impossible, with this quirky disease. It is possible that 2 years ago, during a trip to India, J had butter or cheese made from unpasteurized milk. He doesn't think he got it from his farm. He has only horses, which can contract the disease, but no cattle, bison, pigs, or goats that more commonly carry it.\n\nBut last November 2016, during the hunting season, he helped a friend field-dress and pack out an elk. During the excursion, he cut a finger. 'A rough bone piece got me on the hand,' he said. 'It bled.' Even that theory of infection doesn't fit neatly with what's known about brucellosis and the_ Brucella_ bacterium that causes the disease. 'That elk would not have been in the prime time of her life to spread brucellosis,' the farmer said, casting doubt on his own leading theory of infection.\n\nThe farmer 1st noticed his undulant fever symptoms 10 weeks after retrieving the elk carcass, longer than the typical 6-week incubation period. But undulant fever also can lie dormant before exhibiting itself. Nevertheless, the farmer suspects the elk.\n\nToday, he is slowly healing, though he's weak and tires easily. 'My doctor is very attentive, since this is such a rare disease,' he said. 'It's everybody's 1st try.' He received intravenous doses of an antibacterial over a 28-day period. 'That pretty much drove that pain away from me.' Now he's taking oral antimicrobials, 5 pills a day. 'They are very powerful,' he said of the medications. '(The doctor) has told me, more than likely, we're going to wipe it out.'\n\n[Byline: Angus M.

Symptoms of brucellosis can include: fever, sweats, malaise, anorexia, headache, fatigue, muscle & joint pain, and potentially more serious complications (e.g., swelling of heart, liver, or spleen, neurologic symptoms).\n\nBackground\n----------\nA person who drank raw milk from K-Bar Dairy in Paradise, Texas, has been hospitalized with brucellosis. Milk samples from the dairy have tested positive for a _Brucella_ strain called RB51. People who consumed milk or milk products from this dairy from [1 Jun 2017] to [7 Aug 2017] are at an increased risk for brucellosis and should receive appropriate post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP). They are advised to consult with their health care providers regarding PEP care and possible diagnostic testing. Please note: the incubation period for brucellosis can range from 5 days to 6 months.\n\nRecommendations\n---------------\n_Brucella_ strain RB51 is resistant to rifampin and penicillin. A combination of doxycycline and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole for 21 days is the recommended first-line PEP regimen for RB51 exposure. There is no serological test available to detect RB51 infection. Blood culture is the recommended diagnostic test for exposed symptomatic individuals. When ordering blood cultures to diagnose brucellosis, please advise the laboratory that blood culture may grow _Brucella_ and that appropriate laboratory (1) precautions should be observed. If brucellosis occurs despite prophylaxis, treatment regimens (2) should be selected based on antimicrobial susceptibility results. Please see the diagram below for information [for diagram, see original URL - Mod.LL] on developing an evaluation and treatment plan for exposed patients. Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding should consult with their health care provider.\n\nFor More Information\n--------------------\nRisks from Unpasteurized Dairy Products:\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/brucellosis/exposure/unpasteurized-dairy-products.html\n\nExposure to RB51 through Raw Milk or Milk Products: How to Reduce Risk of Infection:\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/brucellosis/clinicians/rb51-raw-milk.html\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/brucellosis/symptoms/index.html\n\nBrucellosis and Expecting Mothers:\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/brucellosis/exposure/expecting-mothers.html\n\nRaw Milk Questions and Answers:\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/foodsafety/rawmilk/raw-milk-questions-and-answers.html\n\nReferences\n----------\n1.

It is still not stated whether additional cases have been identified and how many potentially exposed individuals are undergoing prophylaxis.\n\nThe following is a recent review on veterinary _Brucella_ vaccines: Lalsiamthara J and Lee JH: Development and trial of vaccines against _Brucella_. J Vet Sci. 2017;18(Suppl 1): 281-90.\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5583415/\n\nAbstract\n--------\n'The search for ideal brucellosis vaccines remains active today. Currently, no licensed human or canine anti-brucellosis vaccines are available. In bovines, the most successful vaccine (S19) is only used in calves, as adult vaccination results in orchitis in male, prolonged infection, and possible abortion complications in pregnant female cattle. Another widely deployed vaccine (RB51) has a low protective efficacy. An ideal vaccine should exhibit a safe profile as well as enhance protective efficacy. However, currently available vaccines exhibit one or more major drawbacks. Smooth live attenuated vaccines suffer shortcomings such as residual virulence and serodiagnostic interference. Inactivated vaccines, in general, confer relatively low levels of protection. Recent developments to improve brucellosis vaccines include generation of knockout mutants by targeting genes involved in metabolism, virulence, and the lipopolysaccharide synthesis pathway, as well as generation of DNA vaccines, mucosal vaccines, and live vectored vaccines, have all produced varying degrees of success. Herein, we briefly review the bacteriology, pathogenesis, immunological implications, candidate vaccines, vaccinations, and models related to _Brucella_'.\n\nText extracted from the manuscript (citations available at original URL - Mod.LL):\n\n'Interestingly, _Brucella_ organisms are very closely related to plant microbes. It is remarkable how the proto-Brucella may jump between the two kingdoms, from plant to animal. _Brucellae_ are classified under \u03b1-Proteobacteria phylogenetically, which are related to plant pathogens and symbionts such as _Rhizobium_, _Agrobacterium_, and an animal endosymbiont _Wolbachia_, to intracellular animal parasites such as _Bartonella_ and _Rickettsia_, and to opportunistic and free-living bacteria like _Ochrobactrum_ and _Caulobacter_ [32,69]. Accurate identification of _Brucellae_ and differentiating them from closely related opportunistic _Ochrobactrum_ is important for accurate diagnosis [83]. It is not well understood whether pre-existing anti-_Ochrobactrum_ immunity may hinder successful vaccination against _Brucella_. _Brucellae_ are gram-negative, non-sporulating, capnophilic, facultative intracellular bacteria [28].\n\n'The most widely used vaccine for the prevention of brucellosis in cattle is the _B. abortus_ S19 vaccine, which remains the reference vaccine to which other vaccines are compared. It is used as a live vaccine and is normally given to female calves aged between 3 and 6 months as a single subcutaneous dose of 50-80 000 000 000 viable organisms or as a reduced dose of from 300 000 000 to 30 000 000 000 organisms that can be administered subcutaneously to adult cattle. Alternatively, it can be administered to cattle of any age as either 1 or 2 doses of 5 000 000 000 viable organisms, given via the conjunctival route [50]. _B. abortus_ S19 has the normal properties of the biovar 1 strain of _B. abortus_, but it does not require CO2 for growth, does not grow in the presence of benzylpenicillin (3 microg/mL equal 5 IU/mL), thionin blue (2 microg/mL), or i-erythritol (1 mg/mL) (all final concentrations), and presents with high L-glutamate use [50].\n\n'_B. abortus_ strain 45/20 is a rough strain that is able to protect guinea pigs and cattle from _Brucella_ infection; however, reversions to the wild smooth type has limited its use as a live vaccine [62,97].\n\n'_B. abortus_ strain RB51, a rough attenuated organism, was originally derived from a rifampicin-resistant mutant of _B. abortus_ strain 2308 and has replaced _B. abortus_ S19 strain as a vaccine candidate in some developed countries. Strain RB51 is very stable and has no, or highly reduced, abortifacient characteristics [84]. Protective efficacy and immunity induced by strain RB51 is similar to or better than that induced by strain 19 [24,59]. However, although strain RB51 has an excellent record of stability, it is rifampicin resistant to important antimicrobials used in the treatment of brucellosis; moreover, it is still infectious to humans and the exact nature of its mutations have not been described. Recently, it was reported that RB51 vaccinated cattle in the Greater Yellowstone Area in the USA were still susceptible to brucellosis [76,103]'.\n\nRegarding human exposures to the _Brucella abortus_ RB51 vaccine, this 2004 report outlined 26 exposures, none related to milk:\n\nAshford DA, di Pietra J, Lingappa J, et al: Adverse events in humans associated with accidental exposure to the livestock brucellosis vaccine RB51. Vaccine. 2004;22: 3435-3439.\n\nAbstract\n--------\n'_Brucella abortus_ strain RB51 vaccine, is an attenuated live bacterial vaccine that was licensed conditionally by the Center for Veterinary Biologics, Veterinary Services, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, USDA, on [23 Feb 1996], for vaccination of cattle in the USA. Accidental human inoculations can occur during vaccination of cattle, and previous live brucella vaccines designed for cattle have been known to cause brucellosis in humans. The CDC established passive surveillance for accidental inoculation with the RB51 vaccine in the USA to determine if this veterinary vaccine is associated with human disease, to describe the circumstances of accidental inoculation, to evaluate the potential efficacy of post-exposure chemoprophylaxis, and to develop recommendations for post-exposure management following exposure to RB51. Reports were received from 26 individuals. Accidental exposure to RB51 occurred by needle stick injury in 21 people (81 percent), conjunctival spray exposure in 4 (15 percent), and spray exposure of an open wound in one (4 percent) individual. At least one systemic symptom was reported in 19 (73 percent) people, including 3 (12 percent) who reported persistent local reactions with systemic involvement. One case required surgery, and _B. abortus_ strain RB51 was isolated from the wound of that individual. A total of 7 cases reported no adverse event associated with accidental exposure. A total of 9 cases reported previous exposure to brucella vaccines, including one case who also reported a previous diagnosis of brucellosis following exposure to S19 vaccine. Accidental needle stick injuries and conjunctival or open wound exposures of humans with the RB51 vaccine are associated with both local and systemic adverse events in the USA that are consistent with brucellosis; however, it remains undetermined if strain RB51 vaccine can cause systemic brucellosis in humans. Early culture attempts on those exposed and developing disease in the future and serologic diagnostic assays for anti-RB-51 antibodies are needed to define if these adverse events are due to RB51 and to define appropriate prophylaxis regimens.'\n\nRegarding _Brucella_ vaccine strains in milk, this appears to be uncommon and it is not clear if human transmission of the vaccine strain has occurred from unpasteurized milk:\n\n1. Miranda KL, Poester FP, Dorneles EM, et al: _Brucella abortus_ RB51 in milk of vaccinated adult cattle. Acta Trop. 2016 Aug;160: 58-61.\n\nAbstract\n--------\n'The aim of this study was to evaluate the shedding of _Brucella abortus_ in the milk of cows vaccinated with a full dose of RB51 during lactation. A total of 18 cows, 9 previously vaccinated with S19 as calves and 9 non-vaccinated, were immunized subcutaneously with 1.3A--10(10)CFU of _B. abortus_ RB51, 30-60 days after parturition. Milk samples from all animals were collected daily until day 7, and at weekly interval for the next 9 weeks after vaccination. To evaluate the shedding of _B. abortus_, milk samples were submitted for culture and PCR. No _B. abortus_ was isolated from any sample tested. Only one sample, collected on 1st day after vaccination from a cow previously vaccinated, was faintly positive in the PCR. In conclusion, the public health hazard associated with milk consumption from cows vaccinated with RB51 in post-partum is very low, despite vaccination with the full dose and regardless of previous S19 vaccination.'\n\n2.

Three groups were monitored with monthly milk and urine collection during 12 months: G1 with 7 cows from 3 to 4-years-old; G2 with 3 cows from 5 to 6-years-old; and G3 with 4 cows from 7 to 9-years-old. Urine and milk samples were submitted to bacteriological culture and urine and PCR reactions for detection of _Brucella spp._ and PCR-multiplex for B19 strain identification. Ring test (RT) was also performed in the milk samples, and serum samples were tested by buffered acidified plate antigen test (BAPA). All animals were serologically negative at BAPA and _Brucella spp._ was not isolated from both urine and milk samples. RT revealed 13/210 (6.2 percent) positive milk samples. PCR reactions detected DNA of _Brucella spp._ in 86/420 (20.5 percent) samples. In urine it was found a significantly higher frequency (35.2 percent; 74/210) than in milk (5.7 percent; 12/210), more frequently from the estrus to 150 days of pregnancy and after parturition (6.7 percent; 10/150), and from 150 days of pregnancy to parturition (3.4 percent; 2/60), and they were all identified as B19 strain. In 3 groups, intermittent excretion of B19 strain was detected mainly in urine samples, which confirmed its multiplication and persistence in cows for until 9 years.\n- Mod.LL\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/245.]", "summary": "\n\nExposure to RB51 through Raw Milk or Milk Products: How to Reduce Risk of Infection:\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/brucellosis/clinicians/rb51-raw-milk.html\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/brucellosis/symptoms/index.html\n\nBrucellosis and Expecting Mothers:\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/brucellosis/exposure/expecting-mothers.html\n\nRaw Milk Questions and Answers:\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/foodsafety/rawmilk/raw-milk-questions-and-answers.html\n\nReferences\n----------\n1.

Vaccine. 2004;22: 3435-3439.\n\nAbstract\n--------\n'_Brucella abortus_ strain RB51 vaccine, is an attenuated live bacterial vaccine that was licensed conditionally by the Center for Veterinary Biologics, Veterinary Services, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, USDA, on 23 Feb 1996, for vaccination of cattle in the USA. Accidental human inoculations can occur during vaccination of cattle, and previous live brucella vaccines designed for cattle have been known to cause brucellosis in humans. The CDC established passive surveillance for accidental inoculation with the RB51 vaccine in the USA to determine if this veterinary vaccine is associated with human disease, to describe the circumstances of accidental inoculation, to evaluate the potential efficacy of post-exposure chemoprophylaxis, and to develop recommendations for post-exposure management following exposure to RB51. Reports were received from 26 individuals. Accidental exposure to RB51 occurred by needle stick injury in 21 people (81 percent), conjunctival spray exposure in 4 (15 percent), and spray exposure of an open wound in one (4 percent) individual. At least one systemic symptom was reported in 19 (73 percent) people, including 3 (12 percent) who reported persistent local reactions with systemic involvement. One case required surgery, and _B. abortus_ strain RB51 was isolated from the wound of that individual. A total of 7 cases reported no adverse event associated with accidental exposure. Nine cases reported previous exposure to brucella vaccines, including one case who also reported a previous diagnosis of brucellosis following exposure to S19 vaccine. Accidental needle stick injuries and conjunctival or open wound exposures of humans with the RB51 vaccine are associated with both local and systemic adverse events in the USA that are consistent with brucellosis; however, it remains undetermined if strain RB51 vaccine can cause systemic brucellosis in humans. Early culture attempts on those exposed and developing disease in the future and serologic diagnostic assays for anti-RB-51 antibodies are needed to define if these adverse events are due to RB51 and to define appropriate prophylaxis regimens'\n\nRegarding brucella vaccine strains in milk, this appears to be uncommon and it is not clear if human transmission of the vaccine strain has occurred from unpasteurized milk:\n\n1.

Acta Trop. 2016 Aug;160: 58-61.\n\nAbstract\n--------\nThe aim of this study was to evaluate the shedding of _Brucella abortus_ in the milk of cows vaccinated with a full dose of RB51 during lactation. A total of 18 cows, 9 previously vaccinated with S19 as calves and 9 non-vaccinated, were immunized subcutaneously with 1.3\u00c3--10(10)CFU of _B. abortus_ RB51, 30-60 days after parturition. Milk samples from all animals were collected daily until day 7, and at weekly interval for the next 9 weeks after vaccination. To evaluate the shedding of _B. abortus_, milk samples were submitted for culture and PCR. No _B. abortus_ was isolated from any sample tested. Only one sample, collected on 1st day after vaccination from a cow previously vaccinated, was faintly positive in the PCR. In conclusion, the public health hazard associated with milk consumption from cows vaccinated with RB51 in post-partum is very low, despite vaccination with the full dose and regardless of previous S19 vaccination.\n\n2.

Three groups were monitored with monthly milk and urine collection during 12 months: G1 with 7 cows from 3 to 4-years-old; G2 with 3 cows from 5 to 6-years-old; and G3 with 4 cows from 7 to 9-years-old. Urine and milk samples were submitted to bacteriological culture and urine and PCR reactions for detection of _Brucella spp._ and PCR-multiplex for B19 strain identification. Ring test (RT) was also performed in the milk samples, and serum samples were tested by buffered acidified plate antigen test (BAPA). All animals were serologically negative at BAPA and _Brucella spp._ was not isolated from both urine and milk samples. RT revealed 13/210 (6.2 percent) positive milk samples. PCR reactions detected DNA of _Brucella spp._ in 86/420 (20.5 percent) samples. In urine it was found a significantly higher frequency (35.2 percent; 74/210) than in milk (5.7 percent; 12/210), more frequently from the estrus to 150 days of pregnancy and after parturition (6.7 percent; 10/150), and from 150 days of pregnancy to parturition (3.4 percent; 2/60), and they were all identified as B19 strain.

Raw milk from the K-Bar Dairy in Paradise, Texas (northwest of Fort Worth), tested positive for a rare but potentially serious bacterium known as _Brucella [abortus_] RB51.\n\nCDC advises that people who consumed raw milk or milk products from the K-Bar Dairy between 1 June 2017 and 7 August 2017, should get antimicrobial treatment to avoid the risk of lifelong, chronic infections. Initially, people with brucellosis experience fever, sweats, aches and fatigue. If not treated, _Brucella [abortus_] RB51 infection can result in long-term complications, like arthritis; heart problems; enlargement of the spleen or liver; and, in rare cases, nervous system problems, such as meningitis. RB51 can [also] cause severe illness in people with weakened immune systems and miscarriages in pregnant women.\n\n'It's very important for people who drank raw milk from this dairy to seek treatment to prevent infection with _Brucella [abortus_] RB51,' said William Bower, M.D., team lead for the CDC group that investigates brucellosis. 'Even if people don't have any symptoms now, they can develop a chronic infection that can impact their health for years to come.'\n\nMilk from K-Bar dairy is known to have caused _Brucella_ infection in one Texas resident. An illness in a Texas woman has been linked to the dairy. Purchase records and illness reports indicate additional people in Texas and some as far away as California and North Dakota may need antimicrobials to prevent or treat infection. In Texas, raw milk is only allowed to be sold on site at the dairy. According to Texas DHSH, K-Bar dairy has been operating in compliance with state dairy laws and rules and is cooperating fully with the investigation.\n\nCDC and Texas health officials have been trying to reach people in more than 800 households known to have purchased K-Bar raw milk. Texas is following up with 170; CDC tried to contact the remaining 672 households but many did not provide contact information. Of the 485 households with contact information, CDC successfully reached 236 households. Among the 236 households, 83 percent of people were exposed to RB51 by drinking the milk. Due to incomplete contact information, CDC staff have been unable to reach about 200 households in which someone bought K-Bar milk. People who sampled the milk at the dairy or got the milk from friends or family also may not be aware of their risk. So far, CDC and Texas health officials have received reports about people who drank K-Bar milk or have symptoms consistent with brucellosis caused by RB51 in Alabama, Arkansas, California, Ohio, North Dakota, Tennessee and Texas.\n\nCDC recommends that anyone who drank raw milk or consumed milk products from K-Bar dairy between 1 June 2017 and 7 August 2017, see their doctor for antimicrobial treatment to prevent infection. Because brucellosis can cause complications during pregnancy, including miscarriage, it is especially important for pregnant women who may have been exposed to seek medical care. RB51 is resistant to some antimicrobials that would normally be used to prevent or treat brucellosis, so people who drank the milk should tell their doctor that they may have been exposed to RB51 and refer their healthcare provider to the CDC website (link below).\n\nPeople who have consumed the milk should also check themselves for fever for 4 weeks after they last drank the milk and watch for other brucellosis symptoms for 6 months. These symptoms include but are not limited to: muscle pain, lasting fatigue, arthritis, depression, and swelling of the testicles.\n\nDoctors can find more information about testing patients for RB51 and which antibiotics to use to prevent infection on the CDC website at: https://www.cdc.gov/brucellosis/clinicians/rb51-raw-milk.html.\n\nAbout RB51\n----------\nRB51 is a weakened strain of _B. abortus_ used to vaccinate young female cattle against infection with more serious strains of _Brucella_. Vaccinating cows with the RB51 vaccine helps prevent abortions in cows and reduces the risk of people coming into contact with cows infected with more severe strains. However, in rare cases, vaccinated cows can shed RB51 in their milk.\n\nTesting of milk from the individual cows in the dairy herd revealed 2 cows that were infected with _B. abortus_ RB51, supporting the conclusion that these cows are a source of RB51 contamination of the dairy's raw milk. Testing is ongoing by Texas officials to assure that the remaining cows in the herd do not pose an ongoing risk of RB51 contamination of the dairy's raw milk. The only way to avoid this potential exposure is to drink milk that has been pasteurized to kill the germs.\n\nBrucellosis is rare in the USA, largely due to our vaccination practices in cattle to prevent brucellosis. There are about 120 reported cases in people each year. Most cases of brucellosis in the USA occur in people who traveled to countries where brucellosis is more common and drank contaminated cow, sheep or goat milk or had contact with infected animals. Among cases in the USA who acquired brucellosis here, infections occur from contact with feral swine or, more rarely, dogs, or because of accidental exposure in lab settings.\n\nRaw Milk: a Risk for Infections\n-------------------------------\nRaw milk and raw milk products are those that have not undergone a process called pasteurization that kills disease-causing germs. CDC recommends that people only drink milk that has been pasteurized to kill germs. Even healthy animals may carry germs that can contaminate milk. There is no substitute for pasteurization to assure that milk is safe to drink. The risk of getting sick from drinking raw milk is greater for infants and young children, the elderly, pregnant women, and people with weakened immune systems, such as people with cancer, an organ transplant, or HIV/AIDS. However, healthy people of any age can get very sick if they drink raw milk contaminated with harmful germs.\n\nMore info on raw milk: https://www.cdc.gov/foodsafety/rawmilk/raw-milk-index.html.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n[This CDC report regarding this ongoing investigation indicates that this is likely a widespread cluster of unpasteurized milk associated, _B. abortus_ RB51, a live, attenuated vaccine strain, although 'abortus' is not mentioned in the report. Additional cases (not previously mentioned) may have occurred in other areas of Texas as well as 6 other states so far. How many more cases in Texas or elsewhere will be found is yet to be determined. It will also be quite interesting to hear how the potentially deadly milk came to these states.\n\nThis review clearly highlight the risk of unpasteurized dairy milk as a health hazard: Costard S, Espejo L, Groenendaal H, Zagmutt FJ: Outbreak-related disease burden associated with consumption of unpasteurized cow's milk and Cheese, United States, 2009-2014. Emerg Infect Dis. 2017;23(6):957-964 https://dx.doi.org/10.3201/eid2306.151603:\n\n'In conclusion, outbreaks linked to the consumption of cow's milk and cheese were estimated to cause on average 761 illnesses and 22 hospitalizations per year in the USA. Unpasteurized products are consumed by a small percentage of the US dairy consumers but cause 95 percent of illnesses; the risk for illness was found to be greater than 800 times higher for consumers of unpasteurized milk or cheese than for consumers of pasteurized dairy products. Therefore, outbreak-related illnesses will increase steadily as unpasteurized dairy consumption grows, likely driven largely by salmonellosis and campylobacteriosis.'\n\nA previous report from the same journal In the March 2012 issue (Langer AJ, Ayers T, Grass J, et al: Nonpasteurized dairy products, disease outbreaks, and state laws -- United States, 1993-2006. Emerg Infect Dis. 2012; 18(3): 385-91 http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/18/3/11-1370_article), the authors report on 121 foodborne outbreaks (with 4413 cases of reported illness) caused by contaminated dairy products, and 73 (60 percent) were involved with unpasteurized dairy products. A total of 65 (54 percent) involved cheese (42 percent made from unpasteurized milk) and 56 involved fluid milk (82 percent involved unpasteurized milk). In these outbreaks, _Campylobacter_ spp was responsible for 54 percent of the outbreaks, followed by _Salmonella_ spp (22 percent), enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ (13 percent), _Brucella_ spp (4 percent), _Listeria_ (4 percent), and _Shigella_ spp (3 percent).

A total of 65 (54 percent) involved cheese (42 percent made from unpasteurized milk) and 56 involved fluid milk (82 percent involved unpasteurized milk). \n\nCDC advises that people who consumed raw milk or milk products from the K-Bar Dairy between 1 June 2017 and 7 August 2017, should get antimicrobial treatment to avoid the risk of lifelong, chronic infections. \n\nCDC recommends that anyone who drank raw milk or consumed milk products from K-Bar dairy between 1 June 2017 and 7 August 2017, see their doctor for antimicrobial treatment to prevent infection. People who consumed raw milk or raw milk products from a Texas dairy should contact their health care provider immediately, warn health investigators from the CDC and the Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS). Testing of milk from the individual cows in the dairy herd revealed 2 cows that were infected with _B. abortus_ RB51, supporting the conclusion that these cows are a source of RB51 contamination of the dairy's raw milk. This review clearly highlight the risk of unpasteurized dairy milk as a health hazard: Costard S, Espejo L, Groenendaal H, Zagmutt FJ: Outbreak-related disease burden associated with consumption of unpasteurized cow's milk and Cheese, United States, 2009-2014. \n\nPeople who have consumed the milk should also check themselves for fever for 4 weeks after they last drank the milk and watch for other brucellosis symptoms for 6 months. \nRaw milk and raw milk products are those that have not undergone a process called pasteurization that kills disease-causing germs. Emerg Infect Dis. 2012; 18(3): 385-91 http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/18/3/11-1370_article), the authors report on 121 foodborne outbreaks (with 4413 cases of reported illness) caused by contaminated dairy products, and 73 (60 percent) were involved with unpasteurized dairy products. People who sampled the milk at the dairy or got the milk from friends or family also may not be aware of their risk. In these outbreaks, _Campylobacter_ spp was responsible for 54 percent of the outbreaks, followed by _Salmonella_ spp (22 percent), enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ (13 percent), _Brucella_ spp (4 percent), _Listeria_ (4 percent), and _Shigella_ spp (3 percent). It's very important for people who drank raw milk from this dairy to seek treatment to prevent infection with _Brucella [abortus_] The risk of getting sick from drinking raw milk is greater for infants and young children, the elderly, pregnant women, and people with weakened immune systems, such as people with cancer, an organ transplant, or HIV/AIDS. \n\nCDC and Texas health officials have been trying to reach people in more than 800 households known to have purchased K-Bar raw milk. Most cases of brucellosis in the USA occur in people who traveled to countries where brucellosis is more common and drank contaminated cow, sheep or goat milk or had contact with infected animals. \n\n\nCDC and Texas Health Officials Warn About Illness Linked to Raw Milk from Texas Dairy\n Testing is ongoing by Texas officials to assure that the remaining cows in the herd do not pose an ongoing risk of RB51 contamination of the dairy's raw milk. A ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n 2017;23(6):957-964 https://dx.doi.org/10.3201/eid2306.151603:\n\n'In conclusion, outbreaks linked to the consumption of cow's milk and cheese were estimated to cause on average 761 illnesses and 22 hospitalizations per year in the USA. \n\nMilk from K-Bar dairy is known to have caused _Brucella_ infection in one Texas resident. RB51 is resistant to some antimicrobials that would normally be used to prevent or treat brucellosis, so people who drank the milk should tell their doctor that they may have been exposed to RB51 and refer their healthcare provider to the CDC website (link below).

Sporadic infections caused by _B. abortus_ or _B. suis_ have been observed in sheep and goats, but such cases are extremely rare. Infection with Brucella in sheep and goats is endemic in the Mediterranean region, but infection is widespread worldwide. North America (except Mexico) is believed to be free from the agent, as are northern and central Europe, southeast Asia, Australia and New Zealand.\n\nPathologically and epidemiologically, _B. melitensis_ infection in sheep and goats is very similar to _B. abortus_ infection in cattle. In most circumstances, the primary routes of transmission of Brucella are the placenta, fetal fluids and vaginal discharges expelled by infected ewes and goats when they abort or have full-term parturition. Shedding of Brucella is also common in udder secretions and semen, and Brucella may be isolated from various tissues, such as lymph nodes from the head, spleen and organs associated with reproduction (uterus, epididymides and testes), and from arthritic lesions' http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.01.04_BRUCELLOSIS.pdf.\n\n'_B. melitensis_ is highly pathogenic for humans; this organism is considered to be the most severe human pathogen in the genus. Occupational exposure is seen in laboratory workers, farmers, veterinarians and others who contact infected animals or tissues. Brucellosis is one of the most easily acquired laboratory infections. People who do not work with animals or tissues usually become infected by ingesting unpasteurized dairy products. The Rev-1 B. melitensis vaccine is also pathogenic for humans and must be handled with caution to avoid accidental injection or contamination of mucous membranes or abraded skin' http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/brucellosis_melitensis.pdf. - Mod.CRD\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/81.]", "summary": "Epidemiological unit: Backyard\nAffected animals:\nSpecies / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered\nSheep/ goats / 368 / 10 / 0 / 10 / 0\n\nSummary of outbreaks: Total outbreaks: 4\nTotal animals affected:\nSpecies / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered\n Epidemiological unit: Backyard\nAffected animals:\nSpecies / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered\nSheep / 205 / 3 / 0 / 3 / 0\n\nOutbreak 4: Kochan, Satovcha, Blagoevgard\n Epidemiological unit: Backyard\nAffected animals:\nSpecies / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered\nSheep/ goats / 257 / 21 / 0 / 21 / 0\n\nOutbreak 3: Kochan, Blagoevgard\n A ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n Recurrence of a listed disease\nDate of previous occurrence: 2 Nov 2016\nManifestation of disease: Sub-clinical infection\n Farm\nAffected animals:\nSpecies / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered\n Sheep / 125 / 0 / 0 / 0 / 0\n\nOutbreak 2: Gergevec, Sliven\n Outbreak statistics: [rates apparent, expressed as percentages]:\nSpecies / Apparent morbidity rate / Apparent mortality rate / Apparent case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*\n Goats / 105 / 3 / 0 / 3 / 0\n Sheep / 330 / 3 / 0 / 3 / 0\n BRUCELLOSIS - BULGARIA (06): (SLIVEN, BLAGOEVGARD) MELITENSIS, LIVESTOCK, OIE\n*****************************************************************************\n Sheep / goats / 625 / 31 / 0 / 31 / 0\n Sheep / goats / 4.96 / 0 / 0 / 4.96\n* Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n< Goats / 2.86 / 0 / 0 / 2.86\n Sheep / 0.91 / 0 / 0 / 0.91\n Information received on [and dated] 4 Sep 2017 from Dr Damyan Iliev, Chief Veterinary Officer & Deputy Executive Director, Bulgarian Food Safety Agency, Ministry of Agriculture and Food, Sofia, Bulgaria\n\nSummary:\n Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: Unknown or inconclusive\n\nControl measures\n", "reports": [{"diseases": ["unknown", "other", "brucellosis"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2021-03-06 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Mexico", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Kochan", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Australia", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "New Zealand", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Bulgaria", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "5256690", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Brucellosis - Algeria: (EO)", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=5256690", "date": "2017-08-17 15:18:49", "main_text": "BRUCELLOSIS - ALGERIA: (EL-OUED)\n********************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Mon 14 Aug 2017 15:53\nSource: APS [machine transl., edited]\nhttp://www.aps.dz/sante-science-technologie/61720-el-oued-70-cas-de-brucellose-enregistres-durant-le-1er-semestre-2017\n\n\nNo less than 70 cases of human brucellosis have been recorded during the 1st half of 2017 in the province of El-Oued.

The infected animal was first identified during voluntary herd testing on a Madison County ranch. Infection was confirmed by the National Veterinary Services Laboratory (NVSL) in Ames, Iowa (IA) by tissue culture following euthanasia of the animal. The ranch has been placed under quarantine and the department has initiated an epidemiological investigation. Testing of all other animals on the ranch is already under way.\n\n'This animal previously tested negative in December of 2016, indicating this is a recent infection,' said state veterinarian, Marty Zaluski. 'Because of the continued risk of transmission from positive elk in the DSA, we expect transmission to domestic cattle or bison to occasionally occur.'\n\nProducers with cattle or bison in the DSA are subject to increased identification and testing requirements. 'Through the significant efforts of veterinarians and producers, we are able to find these cases early and within the boundaries of our DSA, thus protecting our state as well as our trading partners,' Zaluski said.\n\nThis is the 9th herd found to be affected by brucellosis since the DSA was created in 2010. In all 3 Greater Yellowstone Area states, elk have been determined to be the likely source of infection in livestock. The disease investigation and pending results from genetic fingerprinting (genotyping) of the cultured bacteria will help the department better understand the source of infection in this case.\n\nThe mission of the Montana Department of Livestock is to control and eradicate animal diseases, prevent the transmission of animal diseases to humans, and to protect the livestock industry from theft and predatory animals.

The infectious disease can affect humans, wildlife and domestic animals, including dogs. Historically, cattle have been the primary carriers but as states move more into close interaction with wildlife, such as the Greater Yellowstone area, or with managing cervids and buffalo, the carrier in a particular area may not necessarily be cattle. This article states that it may be the elk. Other wildlife carriers include bison, reindeer, caribou and feral swine.\n\nLarge animals, especially elk and bison may have no obvious signs of the disease. The brucella bacterium collects in the lymphatic system, the udder and the reproductive tract. Abortion is a sign of the disease. Other signs in animals may include retained placenta, swollen testicles, reduced pregnancy rates, decreased milk production and swollen, painful joints.\n\nIn humans this disease is known by several names, including Malta fever, Mediterranean fever and undulant fever. Humans may acquire the disease through assisting an infected animal in the birthing process, examining an aborted fetus without protection, drinking unpasteurized milk or other dairy products, through an open wound, or even intact skin, or a slash of infected body fluids into the eyes, nose or mouth. Slaughter workers, and veterinarians are at risk because of the nature of their jobs. Consumption of infected raw meat by humans may also be a source of infection, however if the meat is properly cooked it does not present a disease risk.\n\nWhen a person is infected clinical signs and symptoms may include, fever, body aches, anorexia, lethargy, weakness, fatigue as well as swollen lymph nodes and possibly enlargement of the spleen and liver. Symptoms may develop over several weeks or months, or even immediately. Joints, bones, and especially the spine may be painful.

They stated that there is 'absolute control' over the source focus of this case.\n\nBrucellosis is a livestock disease. Human infection occurs by contact with fluids from an infected animal, in this case sheep. According to Covap, transmission of the disease from person to person does not occur; infection routes are oral, nasal, ocular, and through skin injuries, cuts or wounds.\n\nCurrently, brucellosis mainly affects people involved in the management of livestock: breeders, veterinarians and slaughter line staff in slaughterhouses.

This raw, unpasteurized milk can carry dangerous bacteria such as _Brucella_, _Listeria_, _Salmonella_, _E. coli_, and _Campylobacter_, which are responsible for causing numerous foodborne illnesses and outbreaks.\n\nThe Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS) recommends that people drink and eat only pasteurized dairy products (including soft cheese, ice cream, and yogurt). Pasteurization is the process of heating milk to a high enough temperature for a long enough time to kill dangerous bacteria. This is especially important for people at higher risk for foodborne illness: children younger than 5, pregnant women, adults 65 and older, and people with weakened immune systems. However, healthy people of any age can get very sick or even die if they drink raw milk contaminated with harmful germs.\n\nBrucellosis\n----------\nBrucellosis is an infectious disease caused by bacteria. It is a reportable condition in Texas. People can get the disease when they are in contact with infected animals or animal products, including raw milk, contaminated with the bacteria. Animals that are most commonly infected include sheep, cattle, goats, and pigs, among others. Initial symptoms can include fever, sweats, malaise, anorexia, headache, pain in muscles, joint, and/or back, and fatigue. Some signs and symptoms may persist for longer periods of time. Others may never go away or reoccur. These can include recurrent fevers, arthritis, swelling of the testicle and scrotum area, inflammation of the heart (endocarditis), neurologic symptoms (in up to 5% of all cases), chronic fatigue, depression, and swelling of the liver and spleen. Brucellosis in pregnancy is associated with risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes such as premature delivery, miscarriage, and intrauterine infection with fetal death. Neonatal infection may occur through transplacental transmission during a maternal bacteremic phase, from exposure to blood, urine, or vaginal secretions during delivery, or through breastfeeding.\n\nLaboratory diagnosis of brucellosis involves testing to look for bacteria in samples of blood, bone marrow, or other body fluids. Treatment consists of combination antibacterial therapy. Depending on the timing of treatment and severity of illness, recovery may take a few weeks to several months. Death from brucellosis is rare, occurring in no more than 2% of all cases.\n\nBrucellosis Case Investigation\n----------------------\nIn the course of diagnosing the cause of fever, muscle and joint pain, and fatigue in a Texas resident, blood culture results revealed that the patient was infected with _Brucella_. Through investigation by DSHS, the most probable source of the infection was determined to be raw cow's milk, which the person had been consuming. The source of the milk was K-Bar Dairy, a licensed raw milk dairy in Paradise, Texas.\n\nDSHS is concerned that other people who consumed raw milk from K-Bar Dairy may also have been exposed to _Brucella_ and became infected. Brucellosis may cause short-term and long-term disease. Without specific testing, this disease may elude correct diagnosis, and without appropriate antibiotic therapy, illness may persist.\n\nRecommended Action\n--------------------\nHealth care providers should consider brucellosis among differential diagnoses when a patient presents with a clinically-compatible constellation of signs and symptoms. The patient should be asked about risk factors for brucellosis. A key question affecting the level of suspicion of brucellosis in this scenario is the patient's consumption of raw milk or raw milk products from K-Bar Dairy in Paradise Texas in Wise County since 1 Jun 2017. These individuals are considered to be at high risk of contracting brucellosis. Consumers are advised not to consume any raw milk or raw milk products from K-Bar Dairy that are still in their possession and to discard them.\n\nAt this time, it is uncertain how long _Brucella_ may have been present in the raw milk from this dairy. Testing is ongoing in an attempt to answer that question. If a patient seeks consultation because they consumed raw milk or raw milk products from this dairy between January and June 2017, they should be advised to be watchful for signs of chronic brucellosis and clinically evaluated as appropriate. As a healthcare professional, we ask you to familiarize yourself with brucellosis, since it is an uncommon infection and can present with a wide variety of non-specific symptoms and signs that can wax and wane over weeks or even months. For these reasons, brucellosis presents a diagnostic challenge that requires the clinician to become familiar with the risk factors (e.g., potential exposure), signs, symptoms, natural history, available diagnostic tests, and treatment options.\n\nCDC has indicated that laboratory testing for this strain of _Brucella_ relies upon polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to establish timely presumptive results and recovery via blood culture for _Brucella_ species confirmation. The strain of _Brucella_ recovered from the index patient in this case is resistant to rifampin and penicillin. The CDC is one reliable source for current information on _Brucella_: https://www.cdc.gov/brucellosis/.\n\nDSHS may issue additional alerts to aid the public and healthcare professionals as circumstances warrant.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Brucellosis is a disease that is thought exist since ancient times, as it was 1st described more than 2000 years ago by the Romans and Hippocrates.

DSHS is investigating additional illnesses that may be connected to this product and advising people who consumed milk from this dairy since 1 Jun 2017 to consult with their health care provider.\n\nA person who drank milk from K-Bar Dairy in Paradise, Texas has been hospitalized for an infection of a strain of the _Brucella_ bacterium. The patient's only known exposure is through the raw milk, and milk samples taken at that dairy have also tested positive for _Brucella_. The dairy, which is cooperating fully with the investigation, is contacting customers and telling them to discard any milk they have on hand. Because the dairy does not have record of all customers, DSHS is alerting the public about the recall. The department has also issued a health alert asking health care providers to be aware of possible _Brucella_ infections in patients, ask about the consumption of raw milk if considering a _Brucella_ diagnosis, and order appropriate diagnostic testing.\n\n_Brucella_ can cause a range of symptoms including fever, sweats, headache, muscle and joint pain, loss of appetite, and fatigue. Symptoms can persist for a long time or may come and go repeatedly. Less common symptoms include inflammation of the heart, swelling of the liver and spleen, neurologic symptoms, and in pregnant women, miscarriage. Pregnant women, very young children, older adults, and people with suppressed immune systems are at an increased risk of serious illness due to _Brucella_.\n\nPeople who consumed milk from K-Bar Dairy since 1 Jun 2017 are considered to be at high risk of brucellosis and should contact their health care provider and explain the situation. DSHS recommends testing people with symptoms who consumed the product and treating those who test positive. People who consumed milk from this dairy but have no symptoms should discuss the issue with their provider and monitor themselves for fever and other symptoms.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The state of Texas can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/36946.

In fact, the wide-open spaces that make this ranch ideal for bison are also ideal for other wildlife, including an elk herd that harbours brucellosis and spreads it to bison.\n\nTed Turner, the largest bison owner in the world, bought the Flying D in 1989 and put it under a conservation easement in 1990. It comprises about 175 sq miles [about 453.25 sq km] of contiguous property in the southern part of Montana.\n\nHowever, the bison herd has been quarantined by the US Department of Agriculture since 2010, when some animals tested positive for brucellosis. Chronic infection in the elk herd that frequents the property means the bison herd will never be free of the contagious and untreatable disease. 'The only real solution is going to be a better vaccine,' said ranch manager Danny Johnson. 'Until there's a better vaccine, there is no chance of us getting off of quarantine because we have to have 3 consecutive (negative) tests' of the entire bison herd.\n\nJohnson said the Montana Fish and Game department estimates 27 percent of the elk herd in the region carries brucellosis.\n\nSince the bison herd is tested only once a year, Johnson said the chances of finding no brucellosis cases in that many bison over 3 years are virtually nil. 'We were quarantined for brucellosis in 2010, and it's from migrating elk. We're never going to get away from that, so basically animals cannot leave here unless they're on a USDA sealed truck and trailer and going to slaughter, so we try to keep them here as long as we can.'\n\nFor the Flying D, that has led to establishment of 2 Supplemental Nutrition for Animal Performance (SNAP) areas on the ranch. They are essentially feedlots, although Johnson said they're trying to avoid that term. Each lot holds 499 head, keeping numbers below the level where commercial feedlot rules would apply. Each allows 800 sq feet [74.32 sq m] per animal. 'The main reason we've gone into it, and actually all the ranches are kind of heading this direction anyway, the longer we can keep (the bison) home, the more comfortable they're going to be,' said Johnson.\n\nThe bison have free choice of grain and can choose from 3 different kinds of hay so they can follow natural instincts to balance nutritional needs and rumen health. Animals enter the SNAP facilities at 18 months and are shipped at about 28 months after 180 days on feed. Young bulls are fed through fall and winter and heifers in spring and summer.\n\n'We're trying to grow things on this ranch, rather than importing feeds ... wherever we can and try to feed them out,' said Johnson. 'All the hay comes off the ranch right now and we're trying programs with oats and barley. And field peas, we tried that. Just things we can grow here on the ranch.'\n\nAbout 10 percent of heifers are kept each year as replacements, and the rest are fed out. During the once-per-year processing, the entire herd is tested, tagged and sorted. It takes about 5 weeks.\n\nBack in 2010, when brucellosis appeared during random blood test screening, the USDA demanded that the entire herd be tested. That required a 2nd run through the chutes, and Johnson said he thinks the stress left the herd open to an outbreak of mycoplasma. About 800 head were lost to that illness in 2010. 'The herd's healthy right now,' said Johnson.\n\nTurner owns 3 other ranches in Montana, 6 in Nebraska, 3 in New Mexico, 2 in South Dakota, one in Kansas, and 3 in Argentina. He owns about 56 000 bison.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[When you see one of the ranch's 1000 head herds grazing one of the extensive meadows it is immediately obvious why Ted Turner is besotted with this beast. It is beautiful beyond belief and the large grazing herds invoke the plains history of this country. And that large herd is in fact made up of individual maternal mobs and elderly bulls; the young bulls are scattered around the periphery. When you buy bison beef this is the environment that they come from.\n\nTurner's ranch staff and management are expert. Every animal is microchipped so that when it goes through the headgate at the head of the chute, its record immediately comes up on the foreman's laptop. Following an anthrax epidemic in 2010 they are vaccinated with Sterne; a trial showed that a single shot managed to cover them for the next year's anthrax season.\n\nI checked with Dave Hunter, ranch veterinarian, about the possibility of adult vaccination against brucellosis. His reply: 'We tried adult vaccination of the bison, but as we only handle our herds when they are pregnant, and on the safety trial 18 out of 20 aborted with RB51. Not good. We are still trying. Dr Schurig (developer of RB51) is working on modifying the vaccine to better protect bison. We will have to see.'

A separate shed has been built for these animals 30 km away from the temple town of Tirupati. There are nearly 3100 cows and bulls at the goshala.\n\nThe milk used in all TTD temples is supplied from the same dairy farm. Out of the 30 Indian breeds, nearly 10-12 are seen in the same farm.\n\nHumans dealing with infected animals are likely to be infected by brucellosis. They can also be infected if they consume non-pasteurised milk or products made from the milk of infected animals. It may cause fever, spondylitis, and muscular and joint pain in humans.\n\nDirector of the Gosamrakshana Sala K Harnatha Reddy said: 'It is very difficult to detect the disease; it is possible only when the animals are pregnant.

But as this is milk for the TTD temples, it is likely worth it.\n\nBovine brucellosis is usually caused by _Brucella abortus_, less frequently by _B. melitensis_ (which affects mainly goats and sheep), and occasionally by _B. suis_ (porcine brucellosis). Infection is widespread globally. Several countries in Northern and Central Europe, Canada, Japan, Australia and New Zealand are believed to be free from _B. abortus_.\n\nClinically, the disease is characterised in cattle by one or more of the following signs: abortion, retained placenta, orchitis (testicular inflammation), epididymitis (inflammation of the epididymis, a tube at the back of the testicle) and, rarely, arthritis, with excretion of the organisms in uterine discharges and in milk. Diagnosis depends on the isolation of _Brucella_ bacteria from abortion material, udder secretions, or from tissues removed post-mortem. Presumptive diagnosis can be made by assessing specific cell-mediated or serological responses to _Brucella_ antigens.\n\nThough both _B. abortus_ and _B. melitensis_ are known to be endemic in India (Ref), only _B. abortus_ is mentioned in India's annual reports to the OIE. The bacteria _B. melitensis_ and _B. suis_, both highly pathogenic for humans, are included in India's OIE report for 2015 in the list of diseases 'for which no information has been provided.'\n\nAccording to India's most recent available (2014) annual statistical-epidemiological report to the OIE, a total of 113 cases of bovine brucellosis in cattle and one in a buffalo, in 7 new outbreaks, were recorded during that year.

Now researchers at the Kenya Medical Research Institute (Kemri) and 6 international institutions, want the responsible test withdrawn from public hospitals. For example, in 2012 some 75 256 cases of brucellosis were reported to the Kenya Health Information System, but going by the new study only about 1 percent of these patients may have been infected.\n\n'It is that bad. The diagnosis for brucellosis has been a challenge and it is time we looked into it seriously,' said study supervisor Prof Sam Kariuki of Kemri. Prof Kariuki said such an off mark diagnostic tool has serious costs and health implications to patients. 'It is also a serious contributor to the growing antimicrobial resistance in the country,' he said of the study led by John Mwaniki Njeru also of Kemri.\n\nThe test, called febrile antigen brucella agglutination test or FBAT is used in Government facilities throughout Kenya. 'It appears to have very poor diagnostic specificity and should be phased out,' the study recommends. The study, published on [Fri 7 Apr 2017] in the journal PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases, also involved the Nairobi-based International Livestock Research Institute and several research institutions from Germany, UK, Spain and Sweden.\n\nThe researchers tested 825 patients for brucellosis at the Busia County Referral Hospital and at Kemri's Alupe clinic in the same area. The team used the regular government test FBAT, a 2nd one called Rose Bengal Test (RBT), while another 2 kits were used to confirm the results. Out of the 825 cases, 196 patients or 19.6 percent were found positive for brucellosis from the regular tests. However, when the positive cases were tested with the 2nd and the other confirmatory tests only 8 people or 1 percent of the total were found to have been infected with brucellosis. In this case, if not for the 2ary and confirmatory tests, 188 people would have unnecessarily been put on the brucellosis treatment.\n\nThis is something the authors indicate may be happening across the country and especially among pastoralist communities who are normally in close contact with livestock. The researchers also suspected the reagents being marketed to and used in government facilities to test for brucellosis are of poor quality and hinted at the possibility of foul play in their procurement. They explain that while there are 2 strains of brucellosis which infect humans, there are no tests at clinic level which can distinguish between the 2. Yet Government health workers, the researchers said, claimed to be able to do so using varied reagents. They recommend that all possible efforts be made to ensure reagents are sourced only from established sources with high standards of quality control\n\n[Byline: Gatonye Gathura]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The publication referred to is:\n\nde Glanville WA, Conde-\u00c1lvarez R, Moriy\u00f3n I, et al: Poor performance of the rapid test for human brucellosis in health facilities in Kenya.

In Kenya, and throughout East Africa, laboratory diagnosis for the disease is based primarily on the febrile antigen Brucella agglutination test (FBAT), yet few studies of the diagnostic accuracy of this test exist. Assessment of the performance of the FBAT is essential for its appropriate clinical use, as well as for evaluating surveillance data reported by public health systems. To assess FBAT performance, we collected sera from people with symptoms compatible with brucellosis attending 2 health facilities in Busia County, Kenya. Sera were tested using the FBAT and results compared with those from the Rose Bengal Test (RBT), an assay with well-known performance characteristics. Positives on either test were confirmed using the classical serum agglutination test (SAT)-Coombs test combination and a rapid IgM/IgG lateral flow immunochromatography assay (LFA). A questionnaire focusing on known risk factors for exposure to Brucella spp. was also conducted, and relationships with FBAT positivity examined using logistic regression. Out of 825 recruited individuals, 162 (19.6 percent) were classified as positive using the FBAT. In contrast, only eight (1.0 percent) were positive using the RBT. Of the 162 FBAT positives, one (0.62 percent) had an atypical agglutination in SAT and three (1.9 percent) showed low Coombs titres. Out of 148 FBAT positive individuals tested using the LFA, five (3.4 percent) were IgM positive and none were IgG positive. Poor or no correlation was observed between FBAT results and most established risk factors for Brucella infection. We observed substantial disagreement between the FBAT and a number of well-known serological tests, with the majority of reactive FBAT results appearing to be false positives. Poor FBAT specificity, combined with a lack of confirmatory testing, strongly suggests overdiagnosis of brucellosis is common in this low prevalence setting. This is expected to have important economic impact on affected patients subjected to the long and likely unnecessary courses of multiple antibiotics required for treatment of the disease.'\n\nThere had been several older studies in this journal underscoring the usefulness of the screening test but perhaps production issues have intervened. - Mod.LL\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/174.]", "summary": "Communicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The publication referred to is:\n\nde Glanville WA, Conde-\u00c1lvarez R, Moriy\u00f3n I, et al: Poor performance of the rapid test for human brucellosis in health facilities in Kenya.

Emerg Infect Dis. 2017; 23(6) [date cited] http://dx.doi.org/10.3201/eid2306.162018\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nMembers of the genus _Brucella_ are the infectious agents of brucellosis, a neglected disease responsible for economic losses resulting from abortion and low performance in production animals (1). The 4 species mainly responsible for this widespread bacterial zoonosis are _B. melitensis_, _B. abortus_, _B. suis_, and to a lesser extent _B. canis_. Underdiagnosis and limited awareness of the disease among healthcare practitioners is common in many countries (1).\n\n_B. neotomae_, isolated in 1957 from wood rats (_Neotoma lepida_) in North America (2), has been considered nonzoonotic (3). It has been isolated from target organs of experimentally infected mice and guinea pigs (4,5). We report the isolation of _B. neotomae_ from cerebrospinal fluid samples from 2 human patients with neurobrucellosis.\n\nThe study\n---------\nIn 2008, a _Brucella_ sp. isolate was submitted to the Tropical Diseases Research Center at the Universidad de Costa Rica. This isolate (denoted strain bneohCR2) was cultured from a cerebrospinal fluid sample obtained from a 64 year old male patient at one of the main hospitals in San Jos\u00e9, Costa Rica. In 2011, another isolate (denoted strain bneohCR1) was recovered from a cerebrospinal fluid sample from a 51 year old male patient at a regional hospital in Costa Rica. As is common for other patients with brucellosis, the blood leukocyte count for each patient was almost within the reference range, and C-reactive protein level was within reference range. Both patients showed clinical signs compatible with neurobrucellosis (6), had positive Rose Bengal test results, and recovered after receiving 1 month of streptomycin (750 mg/d) and 3 months of doxycycline (100 mg/12 h).\n\nFurther bacteriologic analysis (7,8) confirmed that the isolates were a _Brucella_ sp.) (table and figures [see source URL above - Mod.LL]). Real-time PCR high-resolution melting analysis (9) confirmed genus designation but was inconclusive regarding species designation. Bruce-ladder multiplex PCR (10) and multiple loci variable number of tandem repeats-16-loci panel analysis indicated that the profiles for both DNA isolates corresponded to profiles for _B. neotomae_. Analysis of bneohCR2 by multiplex single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) primer extension assay (11) and by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry of protein extracts (12) (Technical Appendix [https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/23/6/16-2018-techapp1.pdf Table 1) confirmed that the isolate was _B. neotomae_.\n\n[The whole genome sequencing analysis can be found at the source URL above - Mod.LL]\n\nConclusions\n-----------\nThis report of _B. neotomae_ as a cause of zoonotic disease raises questions about possible underrepresentation of reported cases. This study also has implications for brucellosis diagnosis. Specifically, the differences among _B. neotomae_ and the other _Brucella_ species at the biochemical level are subtle. The major difference between _B. neotomae_ and _B. abortus_, the main cause of human brucellosis in Costa Rica, is the presence of oxidase activity in _B. abortus_, which is assessed subjectively (7,8). Because _B. neotomae_ has not, until now, been considered zoonotic, some cases of brucellosis reported as being caused by atypical zoonotic classical Brucella might have been misdiagnosed cases of _B. neotomae_ infection. The introduction of whole-genome sequencing into the clinical field will thus improve diagnosis.\n\nA lack of epidemiologic information with regard to the 2 patients reported here precluded the investigation of exposure or contact with hosts known to harbor _B. neotomae_. Further studies are needed to establish which animals may act as reservoirs for _B. neotomae_ in Costa Rica.\n\nIn summary, _B. neotomae_ should be considered a zoonosis risk for infection in humans. Incorporation of molecular techniques for diagnosis will help resolve the _Brucella_ genus homogeneity obtained when only biochemical assays are used.\n\nReferences\n----------\n1. WHO.

A total of 35 publications were analyzed and 187 neurobrucellosis cases were evaluated. Headache, fever, sweating, weight loss, and back pain were the predominant symptoms, while meningeal irritation, confusion, hepatomegaly, hypoesthesia, and splenomegaly were the most frequent findings. The major complications in patients were cranial nerve involvement, polyneuropathy/radiculopathy, depression, paraplegia, stroke, and abscess formation. Antibiotics were used in different combinations and over different intervals. The duration of antibiotic therapy reported ranged from 2 to 15 months (median 5 months). The mortality was 0.5 per cent with suitable antimicrobials. Neurobrucellosis may mimic various pathologies.

For instance the index (percentages) was 1.8 in 2014, 1.4 in 2015, last year [2016] it was a little higher than 1 per cent,' he said. He said some farmers do not put the cattle on the register; as a result, one sick head can infect dozens of others. 'We apply blood tests in spring and autumn. The cattle found infected with brucellosis are slaughtered,' he said.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nAnton van Engelen\nfreelance livestock consultant\n\n[According to the Russian-language website 'Kazakh-zerno', Kazakhstan, similarly dated [Wed 12 Apr 2017] (machine-translated), Kazbek Tashimov has disclosed 3 human brucellosis infections in West Kazakhstan since the start of the year [2017]. (He did not refer to the species of the agent responsible for the cases, which may be either _Brucella abortus_ or _B. melitensis_, both known to be endemic in Kazakhstan). Tashimov referred only to cattle and named several affected locations, indicating that one of the main reasons for the outbreaks was uncontrolled movement of cattle, including purchase of animals from other regions without the owners registering the introduced animals. It was further stated that West Kazakhstan received, as of the report date, 2.8 million doses of animal vaccines, including about 350 000 doses of nodular dermatitis (lumpy skin disease) vaccine. For the said and additional information, subscribers are referred to http://kazakh-zerno.kz/novosti/agrarnye-novosti-kazakhstana/235379-zapadnyj-kazakhstan-tri-zhitelya-zarazilis-brutsellezomat (in Russian).\n\nIn the English source, there was some confusion between West and East Kazakhstan being the site of the discussed brucellosis events. According to the Russian source cited above, the brucellosis events in the current discussion are definitely located in the West Kazakhstan oblast (situated in north west Kazakhstan; map at http://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/map/kazakhstan-administrative-map.htm).\n\nAccording to Kazakhstan's annual reports to the OIE since 2010, both _Brucella abortus_ and _B. melitensis_ circulate there though no quantitative figures are disclosed. Control measures against both reportable zoonoses, as checked for the period Jan 2010 - Jun 2016, include, among others, 'vaccination prohibited'. Controlling brucellosis without vaccination, relying solely on strict zoosanitary measures including periodical tests of registered, identified individual animals, is a complex and costly (compensations!) undertaking. If eradication of _B. melitensis_ in small ruminants, in endemic situation, is considered, it is difficult to envisage success without the initial application of vaccine during the 1st stages of the project.\n\nAccording to Kazakhstan's OIE reports, a decline in the number of human brucellosis has been noted since 2010: the number of reported human cases in 2011 was 1800; in 2013, 1443 cases and in 2015, 884 cases.\n\nIn view of the above information on lumpy skin disease vaccination in West Kazakhstan, an update on the situation of this disease in Kazakhstan would be useful. Similarly, it would be useful to obtain updated results of (hopefully applied) targeted surveillance addressing peste des petits ruminants, an emerging disease in Kazakhstan's neighbors.\n\nThe livestock population of Kazakhstan (2015 figures) includes about 6 million cattle and more than 18 million sheep. - Mod.AS\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/56.]", "summary": "A ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n \n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nAnton van Engelen\nfreelance livestock consultant\n\n According to Kazakhstan's OIE reports, a decline in the number of human brucellosis has been noted since 2010: the number of reported human cases in 2011 was 1800; in 2013, 1443 cases and in 2015, 884 cases.

The disease is usually asymptomatic in young animals and non-pregnant females. Following infection, pregnant adult females develop a placentitis, usually resulting in abortion between the 5th and 9th month of pregnancy. The mammary gland and associated lymph nodes may also be infected, and organisms may be excreted in the milk. Subsequent pregnancies are usually carried to term, but uterine and mammary infection recurs, with reduced numbers of organisms in afterbirth products and milk. In acute infections, the organism is present in most major body lymph nodes. Adult male cattle may develop orchitis/epididymitis, and brucellosis may be a cause of infertility in both sexes.\n\n2. Most human _B. abortus_ infections are direct, resulting from exposure to infected foeti, fetal fluids and vaginal discharges of attended cattle. Most indirect infections result from the consumption of unpasteurized milk and unpasteurized dairy products. While udders and testicles of infected cattle are of high risk, the consumption of meat (muscular tissue) from such animals is significantly less hazardous, and even allowed by some countries.\n\nThe Malaysian _B. abortus_ situation has recently been reviewed (Ref. 1). From the said reference, we hereby present the following extracted data.\n\nThe prevalence of bovine brucellosis _Brucella abortus_ in 2014 ranged between 1-2 percent in Thailand and Indonesia, and 4-5 percent in Malaysia and Myanmar. 'Test-and slaughter' is the general policy against brucellosis adopted by most ASEAN [Association of Southeast Asian Nations] countries to eradicate the disease. Under this program, the Rose Bengal Plate Test (RBPT) is used as the screening test to identify infected farm/herd, while the complement fixation test (CFT) is the confirmatory test.\n\nThe 'test-and-slaughter' method is expensive and internationally recommended as feasible only in countries where the prevalence rate does not exceed 2 percent and where surveillance and laboratory facilities are excellent. However, the small number of cattle in Malaysia of approximately 800 000 head made the program less expensive and feasible, and it was started in 1979.\n\nThe national bovine brucellosis eradication program had successfully reduced the prevalence of bovine brucellosis in Malaysia from 3.3 percent in 1979 to 0.23 in 1988 to approximately one percent in 1998, but was unable to eradicate the disease, which recurred to reach a prevalence of 5 percent in 2015. The failure of eradication was due to several factors, including inability to locate and identify the remaining affected animals and to control their movement, importation of breeder animals from non-brucellosis-free countries and lack of participation by the farmers who claimed that the program eliminated uninfected breeder animals following unreliable test results. To support the eradication policy, research activities since the 1980s have suggested combinations of serological tests to improve diagnosis, while surveillance should be focused on hot spot areas. The prevalence can be further reduced by strictly sourcing breeder animals from brucella-free areas or countries.\n\nReference\nM. Zamri-Saad, M.I. Kamarudin.

Melitensis_ and _B. Suis_) (Infection with (_Brucella abortus_, _B. Melitensis_ and _B. Suis_) at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.01.04_BRUCELLOSIS.pdf from which the following commentary is quoted:\n\n' Brucellosis is the generic name used for the animal and human infections caused by several species of the genus _Brucella_, mainly _Brucella abortus_, _B. melitensis_, and _B. suis_. Infection with _Brucella_ in cattle is usually caused by _B. abortus_, less frequently by _B. melitensis_, and occasionally by _B. suis_. _Brucella melitensis_ is the main causative agent of infection with _Brucella_ in sheep and goats. Infection with _Brucella_ in pigs is due to _B. suis_ biovars 1-3, but the disease caused by biovar 2 differs in its host range, its limited geographical distribution and its pathogenicity. In some areas, _B. suis_ infection has become established in wild pigs. Clinically, infection with _Brucella_ in animals is characterised by one or more of the following signs: abortion, retained placenta, orchitis, epididymitis and, rarely, arthritis, with excretion of the organisms in uterine discharges and in milk. Unequivocal diagnosis depends on the isolation of _Brucella_ from abortion material, udder secretions or from tissues removed at post-mortem. _B. abortus_, _B. melitensis_, and _B. suis_ are highly pathogenic for humans, and potentially contaminated tissues, cultures and materials must be handled under appropriate containment conditions.\n\nInfection with _Brucella_ in cattle is usually caused by biovars (bv.) of _B. abortus_. In some countries, particularly in southern Europe, Africa and western Asia, where cattle are kept in close association with sheep or goats, infection can also be caused by _B. melitensis_. Occasionally, _B. suis_ may cause a chronic infection of the mammary gland of cattle, but it has not been reported to cause abortion or spread to other animals.\n\nInfection caused by _B. suis_ bv. 2 differs from infection caused by bv. 1 and bv. 3 in its host range, distribution, and in pathogenicity. Historically, the geographical distribution of _B. suis_ bv. 2 has been in a broad range between Scandinavia and the Balkans. The prevalence in wild boars [_Sus scrofa_] appears to be high throughout continental Europe. In outbreaks in Europe, wild boars were implicated as the source of transmission of bv. 2 to outdoor reared pigs, and are considered as the main wild reservoir of this infection. _B. suis_ bv. 2 causes miliary lesions, particularly in reproductive tissues, that often become purulent. To date, bv. 2 has rarely been reported as the cause of human brucellosis. However, bv. 2 infections have been reported in immunocompromised hunters, who had been extensively exposed through gutting or skinning boars or hares. Moreover, rare cases of _B. suis_ bv. 2 infection without clinical signs have been reported in Europe in cattle or sheep exposed to infected wild boars.\n\nIn addition to wild boar, the European hare (_Lepus europaeus_) is also considered to be a reservoir for _B. suis_ bv. 2 and has been implicated as a possible source of transmission to domestic livestock. The disease in the European hare is characterised by the formation of nodules, varying in size from that of a millet seed to a cherry or even larger; these often become purulent. Such nodules may occur in almost any location, sometimes subcutaneously or intramuscularly, in the spleen, liver, or lung and in the reproductive organs of either sex. The bodily condition of the hare may be surprisingly unaffected. Other species may also become infected by cohabitation with _B. suis_ bv. 2 infected swine, wild boars, or hares. Gutting or skinning wild boars in cattle sheds could be a route of transmission to cattle.' - Mod.CRD\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/56472.]", "summary": "A ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n Measures to be applied: no other measures\n\nDiagnostic test results\nLaboratory name and type:\nCODA-CERVA (DILAVE) (national laboratory)\n Summary of outbreaks:\nTotal outbreaks: 1\nOutbreak 1: Bertrix, Bertrix, Luxembourg\n Date of confirmation of the event: 2 Dec 2016\nReason for notification: reoccurrence of a listed disease\n \nInformation received on 14 Dec 2016 from Dr Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Heymans, Director, Animal Health and Safety of Products of Animal Origin, Federal Agency for the Safety of the Food Chain (FASFC), Brussels, Belgium\n\nSummary\nReport type: Brucella suis_ biovar 2\nNature of diagnosis: laboratory (basic)\n (Infection with (_Brucella abortus_, _B.

Antibiotic treatment lasted for weeks.\n\nWith this kind of ailment, symptoms may return several months after treatment concludes and symptoms may appear anywhere from 5 days to 5 months from exposure.\n\nWhere did this infection come from if New York is brucellosis free? Isn't the US free of brucellosis? The answer to those questions is yes, the US is free of the disease in commercial herds.\n\nBut there are other production methods and other potential sources for the bacteria. Pasture-raised farms have pigs outdoors. These pigs may have access to feral hogs. Could these outdoor pigs or feral pigs been the source for the human infection?\n\nThe person infected was assisting with farrowing on the family's farm in Schoharie County. The diagnosis was made via blood culture, testing positive for _B. suis_ biotype 1. The pasture-raised swine had no known contact with feral hogs.\n\nThe USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service's Wildlife Services was called in to assist. All adult breeding hogs on the farm were tested with 7 of the 29 hogs testing positive on multiple tests for the same strain.\n\nAll but 2 that tested negative were humanely euthanized due to zoonotic -- human transmission -- risk. The 2 remaining hogs were kept under quarantine for 'testing out.'\n\nIn swine, brucellosis infection causes reproductive issues such as infertility, abortion, stillborn or weak piglets, testicular swelling, and reluctance to mate. There may also be signs of lameness with painful, swollen joints. It may be transmitted through breeding or ingestion of urine or placentas, aborted fetuses, or uterine fluids.\n\nThe farm had sold feeder pigs or breeding stock to numerous farms with 4 herds testing positive for _B. suis_ biotype 1. 2 were in New York -- Schoharie and Rensselaer counties -- 1 herd was in Virginia, and 1 herd was in New Jersey. They were all pasture-raised operations.\n\nThe initial infected farm purchased a breeding boar from a farm in Washington County, New York. Back in 2004, the Washington County farm observed a feral boar gain access and breed 2 sows, and then escape. Both sows had litters that sold as feeders or directly to restaurants. The farm kept 1 pig from each litter -- male and female.\n\nThe breeding boar died in 2014 but the sow farrowed multiple litters. Over 78 percent of the herd tested positive for brucellosis -- 59 of 75. They had sold or shared hogs with multiple farms.\n\nA total of 50 herds in 13 states were investigated. 9 brucellosis-infected herds were found, all pasture-raised swine, with 6 infected herds in New York: 2 in Schoharie County, 1 in Rensselaer County, and 3 in Washington County.\n\nAs of [26 Sep 2016], all known infected and exposed pigs had been depopulated. These farms received indemnity paid by the New York State Department of Agriculture & Markets and the USDA.\n\nThe farm owners performed dry cleaning on their premises and then disinfected with Virkon. Pastures were required to be fallow for 60 to 120 days. Restocking of the herds was done from validated herds, those that had tested brucellosis free.\n\nThere were 2 strains of _B. suis_ identified from this outbreak.\n\nWas the strain around a long time, opening the possibility for variation? Were there multiple sources of infected pigs? What's the takeaway message here?\n\nBiosecurity and traceability are important, especially when it comes to diseases such as brucellosis.\n\nHere are some other biosecurity tips:\n- feral hog populations need to be kept away from domestic hogs with secure fencing;\n- avoid sharing breeding boars between herds or have the boar tested for brucellosis before using him for breeding;\n- purchase only tested animals or animals from validated free herds (herds that undergo routine testing for brucellosis);\n- isolate newly purchased animals for 30 days and consider retesting them for brucellosis before using them for breeding or mixing them with the rest of the herd. Don't borrow or lend disease to your neighbor;\n- avoid sharing equipment that comes in contact with animals. Thoroughly clean and disinfect all equipment that is borrowed;\n- practice good herd hygiene. Do not feed aborted fetuses and placenta to other pigs or dogs;\n- keep equipment clean including transport trailers, chutes; and other tools for handling swine;\n- thoroughly clean feed and water troughs before reusing with another group of animals;\n- practice good manure management and remove manure as each group cycles through, or sooner if needed;\n- keep yourself safe, too. Wear protective clothing such as coveralls or barrier aprons and rubber boots when working with swine;\n- thoroughly clean and disinfect your boots and apron when you are finished and wash your coveralls;\n- Be very careful when handling aborted fetuses or placentas, or when assisting with farrowing;\n- use rubber gloves, safety goggles, and a mask to cover your nose and mouth.\n- Afterward, wash thoroughly with soap and water, paying close attention to any areas where birth products have accidentally touched your skin or soaked through your clothing;\n- During cooking and food prep, avoid eating under-cooked meat and wash your hands thoroughly after handling raw meat.\n\n[Byline: Nancy Glazier, Cornell Extension]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Brucellosis in people has many other names, including Malta fever, and undulating fever. The fever associated with this disease seems to be present for a few days and then gone for a few days only to return again. This cycle repeats. In other words, a recurrent fever.\n\nIn addition to the recurrent fever the patients with this disease experience malaise, fatigue, headaches, anorexia, and body pain, often in the back, legs, joints, and spine. The pain and recurrent fever and sweats and general malaise often produce depression. The abdomen may be tender to painful as the liver and/or spleen generally swell with this disease.\n\nSadly as in this case, physicians believe the state is free of this bacterial disease and it is often not their differential radar. However, if it is diagnosed, this bacterial disease can be treated with antibiotics. The combination of rifampin and doxycycline generally works well. Treatment may be needed for as long as 6-8 weeks depending on the patient and how long the bacteria have been propagating the human being. There are cases where patients have been on antibiotic therapy for a couple of months.\n\nRegardless of the state designation of a disease, this disease and others should be on the differential list. Diseases travel widely in this age of jetting about our global community.\n\nThis article raises some good points on biosecurity of farm raised swine and trading or loaning boars.

Vaccine 2016; (in press, corrected proof; available online 19 Oct 2016)\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nAbstract\n--------\nBrucellosis is a zoonotic disease that can cause severe illness in humans and considerable economic loss in the livestock industry. Although small ruminants are the preferential host for _Brucella melitensis_, this pathogen has emerged as a cause for _Brucella_ outbreaks in cattle. S19 vaccination is implemented in many countries where _B. abortus _is endemic but its effectiveness against _B. melitensis_ has not been validated. Here we show that vaccine effectiveness in preventing disease transmission between vaccinated and unvaccinated cohorts, as determined by seroconversion, was 87.2 percent (95 percent CI [confidence interval] 69.5-94.6 percent). Furthermore, vaccination was associated with a reduced risk for abortion. Together, our data emphasize the role S19 vaccination could play in preventing _B. melitensis_ outbreaks in areas where this pathogen is prevalent in small ruminant populations.\n\nConclusions\n-----------\nWe demonstrate that the _B. abortus_ S19 vaccine was effective in preventing disease transmission and clinical symptoms such as abortion and reduced gestation length (data not shown) following natural challenge with _B. melitensis_. To the best of our knowledge, cross protection of a _B. abortus_ vaccine in dairy cattle naturally infected with _B. melitensis_ has not been demonstrated previously.\n\nOur findings emphasize the possible role _B. abortus_ vaccines could play in programs aimed to control and prevent _B. melitensis_ outbreaks in dairy herds. Although the evidence for our findings was quite conclusive, it must be stressed that our study was not designed as a randomized, controlled trial. Therefore, the presence of a cohort effect cannot be excluded. Such an effect, if present, could introduce bias if the exposure to _B. melitensis_ was not of the same magnitude or varied over time between the vaccinated and unvaccinated heifers. We aimed to reduce the probability of a cohort effect by choosing the groups in such a way that the maximum age difference between 2 heifers from different cohorts was 6 months. This way the cohorts most likely shared pens or were housed in adjacent pens at the time of exposure.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Bovine brucellosis is usually caused by _Brucella abortus_, less frequently by _B. melitensis_, and rarely by _B. suis_. The disease is manifested by abortion and excretion of the organisms in uterine discharges and in milk. Brucellosis is highly pathogenic for humans, _B. melitensis_ is regarded as more pathogenic for humans than _B. abortus_. B. melitensis is the main causative agent of caprine and ovine brucellosis; it appears to occur mainly in the Mediterranean regions, but infection occurs worldwide.\n\n_B. abortus_ was eradicated in Israel in 1984. Its continued absence was monitored, during the following years, by compulsory surveillance of all farms, which included periodic bulk milk testing. In the event of a positive reaction, the test was repeated on bulk milk from groups of cows, and the cows of a suspected group underwent individual blood testing. Cows with positive test results were slaughtered with full state compensations, and their organs bacteriologically examined in the State Reference Laboratory for Brucellosis in the Kimron Veterinary Institute.\n\n_B. melitensis_ infection in small ruminants, and the subsequent disease in humans, 'undulant fever' ('Malta fever'), have been known in Israel since the early years of the 20th century. Occasionally, this pathogen was found to infect cattle as well. In one case (1977), the bacterium was introduced into a large dairy cattle operation by the feeding of raw unpasteurized whey, a by-product of sheep cheese, from a central dairy factory in the vicinity of the farm, with serious damages, including several clinical cases among the attending personnel.\n\nAfter the final eradication of bovine brucellosis (_B. abortus_) in 1984, vaccinations of all dairy female calves between the ages of 2-6 months with strain 19 brucellosis live attenuated vaccine were continued compulsorily for years. This, in view of the continued circulation of _B. melitensis_ in the sheep and goat herds, and despite the fact that no clear evidence for its cross-protection was available. In 1988, a dairy farm with 765 animals tested positive on the periodic milk-ring test and was found infected with _B. melitensis_. Circumstantial evidence implicated contaminated whey from sheep or goat milk as the most likely vehicle of infection but the final epidemiologic investigation was inconclusive. The dairy herd was put under quarantine, and test and slaughter policies applied, leading to the compulsory slaughter of 150 head (23 percent of the herd). During one of the later events, the entire population (about 500 head) of a dairy operation had to be culled.\n\nFollowing a risk assessment, vaccination with 'S19' vaccine was officially discontinued on 1 Jan 2014 (see archive no. 20151103.3762268). Subsequently, the routine, periodic performance of the bulk milk testing was discontinued in 2015.\n\nWhen notified, it was stated that the said decisions 'would be subject to evaluation/review every 2 years or when there is a new brucellosis outbreak on a dairy farm.' (http://www.vetserv.moag.gov.il/NR/rdonlyres/A51D5662-DB7D-4D6D-AAD4-F1FA700DA379/0/mivhan__mrt.pdf; in Hebrew). Such evaluation/review, in case performed, will benefit from the findings and conclusions in the paper presented above.\n\nDuring the current year (2016), the number of human brucellosis cases in Israel seems to be increasing again. According to the current data of the Ministry of health's department of epidemiology, the accumulated number since the start of 2016, as of 15 Oct 2016 (41st week of the year), is 386 officially registered human cases, compared to 362 during the same period in 2015.

Sporadic infections caused by_ B. abortus_ or_ B. suis_ have been observed in sheep and goats, but such cases are extremely rare. Infection with Brucella in sheep and goats is endemic in the Mediterranean region, but infection is widespread worldwide. North America (except Mexico) is believed to be free from the agent, as are northern and central Europe, south-east Asia, Australia and New Zealand. Pathologically and epidemiologically, _B. melitensis_ infection in sheep and goats is very similar to _B. abortus_ infection in cattle. In most circumstances, the primary routes of transmission of Brucella are the placenta, fetal fluids and vaginal discharges expelled by infected ewes and goats when they abort or have full-term parturition. Shedding of Brucella is also common in udder secretions and semen, and Brucella may be isolated from various tissues, such as lymph nodes from the head, spleen and organs associated with reproduction (uterus, epididymides and testes), and from arthritic lesions. http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.01.04_BRUCELLOSIS.pdf\n\n_B. melitensis_ is also an important human pathogen. In humans, brucellosis is a serious, debilitating and sometimes chronic disease that can affect a variety of organs. Most cases are the result of occupational exposure to infected animals, but infections can also occur from ingesting contaminated dairy products. In addition, _B. melitensis_ could be used in a bioterrorist attack. http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/brucellosis_melitensis.pdf. - Mod.CRD\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/74.]", "summary": "\n\nOutbreak statistics\nSpecies / Apparent morbidity rate / Apparent mortality rate / Apparent case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*\nSheep / 0.32 percent / 0 percent / 0 percent / 0.32 percent\n A ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n Measures applied: vaccination prohibited; no treatment of affected animals\nMeasures to be applied: disinfection/disinfestations; traceability; official disposal of carcasses, by-products and waste\n\nDiagnostic test results\nLaboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result\n Total animals affected:\nSpecies / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered\nSheep / 313 / 1 / 0 / 1 / 0\n Summary of outbreaks:\nTotal outbreaks: 1\nOutbreak 1: Bogovolja, Bogovola, Cetingrad, Karlovacka\n *Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction, and/or slaughter\n\nEpidemiology\nSource of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive\n\nControl measures\n --------------------------------------------\nInformation received on [and dated] 18 Nov 2016 from Dr Tomislav Kis, Assistant to Minister, Veterinary and Food Safety Directorate, Ministry of Agriculture, Zagreb, Croatia\n\nSummary\nReport type: Source: OIE, WAHID (World Animal Health Information Database), weekly disease information 2016; 29(47) [edited]\nhttp://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=21589\n\n\nBrucellosis (_Brucella melitensis_), Croatia\n Date of previous occurrence: 28 Nov 2014\nManifestation of disease: sub-clinical infection\n BRUCELLOSIS - CROATIA: (KARLOVACKA) MELITENSIS, OVINE, OIE\n**********************************************************\n Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n< This event pertains to a defined zone within the country\n\nNew outbreaks (1)\n Croatian Veterinary Institute, Zagreb (national laboratory) / Sheep / bacteriological examination / 18 Nov 2016 / Positive\n [The location of the outbreak can be seen on the interactive map included in the OIE report at the source URL above.]\n\n--\n", "reports": [{"diseases": ["unknown", "other", "brucellosis"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2014-03-24 00:00:00", "2016-03-24 00:00:00", "2016-11-18 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Bogovolja", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Zagreb", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Croatia", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Cetingrad", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Bogovola", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Mexico", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Australia", "country": "Australia"}, {"location": "New Zealand", "country": "New Zealand"}, {"location": "WAHID", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "4595618", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Brucellosis, canine - USA: (WI) canine", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=4595618", "date": "2016-10-30 14:08:45", "main_text": "BRUCELLOSIS, CANINE - USA: (WISCONSIN) CANINE\n*********************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: 29 Oct 2016\nSource: Hudson Star-Observer [edited]\nhttp://www.hudsonstarobserver.com/news/4146319-quarantine-continues-gregorys-gift-hope-animal-shelter\n\n\nGregory's Gift of Hope Animal Shelter in New Richmond will remain quarantined until 1 Dec 2016 after an outbreak of canine brucellosis.\n\nCanine brucellosis is a reproductive disease that affects dogs, according to the United States Department of Agriculture.\n\nSeveral animals from the rescue have been infected by the [bacterium], according to a press release from the organization. Gregory's said anyone who has adopted a dog between 15 Jun 2015 and 1 Sep 2016 should have the animal tested with their current veterinarian. All dogs were considered exposed to the [bacterium] by the Wisconsin statute regarding zoonotic diseases. 'Although it is very rare, it can cause devastation when it is diagnosed,' the release said.\n\nThe rescue has closed its boarding services and dog adoption to be proactive of the possible spread of the [bacterium]. Rescue personnel became aware of the exposure after an adopted dog was diagnosed with the [bacterium]. 'We remind people this is a population problem (the animals themselves) not a facility issue, so when we re-open, there is no concern for spreading of the [bacteria],' Gregory's press release stated.\n\nAs a no-kill shelter, Gregory's said it is having each of its dogs tested and put through the quarantine period rather than euthanization as many other shelters would. 'Being the only operating animal shelter in the county and being placed in this position has been very hard on all of us here at the organization as well as the animals in need in our communities,' the rescue said in its release.\n\nThough the dog population is quarantined, Gregory's is continuing to help rescue cats in the area. The rescue is currently running a cat adoption special through the end of October 2016.\n\n'With the weather turning, we are in great need of having forever homes found so we can continue to help those in need during the hard cold fall and winter months,' the release stated.\n\nVisit Gregory's website at http://www.ggohinc.com for more details.\n\n[Byline: Rebecca Mariscal]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[_Brucella melitensis_, _suis_ and _abortus_ species exhibit either rough (R) or smooth (S) colonies on growth in the lab, determined by expression of O-polysaccharide chain as a component of the bacterial outer membrane lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (endotoxin). Loss of expression of O chains results in rough colonial variants. _B. canis_ lack the O chain naturally and only has a rough colonial form.\n\nThe virulence of _Brucella_ for humans is mainly associated with smooth colonial phenotypes of _B. melitensis_, _suis_, and _abortus_, and conventional serological techniques (that is, agglutination tests) use smooth phase antigens that will diagnose infection due to _B. abortus_, _B. melitensis_, and _B. suis_, but are not useful for diagnosing infections caused by the rough species (_B. ovis_ and _B. canis_) in humans or dogs.\n\nFor additional information on brucellosis see: _B. suis_ in dogs: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3311166/ and http://www.scirp.org/journal/PaperInformation.aspx?PaperID=34279#.VOdcGkLnesQ.\n\nCanine brucellosis, caused by _Brucella canis_, is an important cause of reproductive failure, particularly in kennels. This organism causes abortions, stillbirths, epididymitis [inflammation of ducts next to the testicle], orchitis [inflammation of the testicle] and sperm abnormalities in dogs. Although dogs that have been spayed or neutered do not have reproductive signs, they occasionally develop other conditions such as ocular disease and discospondylitis (inflammation of the spinal vertebrae and intervertebral discs). _B. canis_ can persist in an animal even after antibiotic treatment. In kennels, infected dogs are often euthanized to prevent them from infecting other dogs or people. Canine brucellosis is sometimes difficult to diagnose with the currently available tests.\n\nAlthough _B. canis_ is zoonotic, its importance as a cause of human illness is still unclear. Few cases have been reported in people, and most of these infections have been mild. However, human infections with _B. canis_ may be underdiagnosed. The symptoms of this disease are nonspecific, diagnostic suspicion is low among physicians, and bacterial culture is the only commonly available test for diagnosis in people.\n\n_B. canis_ occurs in the fetus, placenta, fetal fluids, and vaginal discharge after an abortion or stillbirth. It can persist in vaginal discharges for several weeks after an abortion. It is also shed in normal vaginal secretions, particularly during estrus, as well as in milk. High concentrations of _B. canis_ may be found in semen for weeks or months after infection, and intermittent shedding of smaller quantities can occur for years. _B. canis_ is also shed in urine, and low concentrations of bacteria may be excreted in saliva, nasal and ocular secretions and feces.\n\nIn dogs, _B. canis_ primarily enters the body by ingestion and through the genital, oronasal and conjunctival mucosa, but transmission through broken skin may also be possible. Most cases are thought to be acquired by venereal transmission or by contact with the fetus and fetal membranes after abortions and stillbirths. Puppies can be infected in utero, and may remain persistently infected even if they appear normal. Nursing puppies can be infected from milk, but the importance of this route is controversial. Other potential sources of infection include blood transfusions and contaminated syringes.\n\n_B. canis_ can be spread on fomites. In conditions of high humidity, low temperatures and no sunlight, _Brucella_ spp can remain viable for several months in water, aborted fetuses, feces, equipment, and clothing. _Brucella_ spp can withstand drying, particularly when organic material is present, and can survive in dust and soil. Survival is longer when the temperature is low, particularly when it is below freezing.\n\nHumans usually become infected with members of the genus _Brucella_ by ingesting organisms or via the contamination of mucous membranes and abraded skin. In case reports, _B. canis_ infections have been described after close contact with dogs, especially animals that recently aborted or gave birth, and after exposure to large amounts of the organism in laboratories (such as, contact with bacterial cultures). However, the source of the organism could not be determined in some cases.\n\nWhile documented human cases of _B. canis_ are rare, and may be underreported, immunocompromised people should be especially careful around animals known to be positive for _B. canis_.\n\nPortions of this comment were extracted from http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/brucellosis_canis.pdf.\n\n_Brucella canis_ in dogs is not common, but nor is it rare. Gerald Hoff found that 4% of Florida pound dogs had positive titres of 1:200 or higher; see Brucella canis, dogs, retrospective - USA (Florida) 19980518.0954.

There have been 13 brucellosis infections in residents so far in 2016, affecting patients between 6 and 80 years old, according to a health advisory notice released on Thursday, 15 Sep 2016.\n\nAll of the patients reported eating cheese brought into the USA from Mexico by friends or relatives, consuming the cheese while traveling in Mexico, or eating unidentified cheese products from local street vendors, officials said. The county typically sees 2 to 6 cases a year, though 11 were recorded in 2004.\n\nHealth officials confirmed all the Dallas County cases by blood culture. In 2 instances, hospital lab personnel were exposed while handling the samples.\n\nThe brucella bacterium can infect livestock and is most commonly transmitted to humans who consume unpasteurized dairy products. Some areas, such as Mexico and Central and South America, are considered high-risk, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nProponents of raw milk products say it's more natural, tastes better and has health benefits. But many state and federal agencies are less keen, saying it can lead to more foodborne illnesses, such as listeriosis. A listeria outbreak at Brenham [Texas]-based Blue Bell Creameries in 2015 sickened 10 people and was linked to 3 deaths.\n\nWhile legal in Texas, raw milk may only be sold at the dairy. State Rep Dan Flynn, R-Van, drafted a bill in 2015 to allow people who produce raw milk or raw milk products to sell directly to consumers at their homes or farmers' markets. Sale at supermarkets would have remained against the law. The bill failed to pass.\n\nSymptoms of brucellosis include fever, fatigue, weakness, weight loss, night sweats and headaches. Antimicrobials are used to treat the infection, and recovery can take weeks to several months. While rarely fatal, some people can also develop chronic or severe conditions. The American Academy of Pediatrics has warned that pregnant women and children should not consume raw milk or raw milk products.\n\n[byline: Claire Z Cardona]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[In the March 2012 issue of Emerging Infectious Diseases (Langer AJ, Ayers T, Grass J, et al.

Their findings were reported [23 Aug 2016] in mBio, the online, open-access journal of the American Society of Microbiology. The researchers sampled and analyzed raw cow's milk from 899 tanker trucks as they arrived at 2 dairy processors in California's San Joaquin Valley during spring, summer and fall. The samples were analyzed using gene sequencing. This collection included 229 tankers filled in the fall of 2013 and another 264 and 406 tankers filled in the spring and summer of 2014, respectively. The larger set of samples collected in the summer included milk collected from 2 sampling dates a week apart.\n\n'The level of bacterial diversity that we discovered in these shipments of raw milk was amazing,' said lead author and microbiologist Maria Marco, an associate professor in the UC-Davis Department of Food Science and Technology. 'More than half of the bacterial groups identified represented less than 1 per cent of the total microbial content.' She said the broad mix of bacteria could be due to raw milk's high nutrient content, as well as the many potential sources of bacteria associated with dairies. These include bacteria from the cows' skin, feed, bedding and aerosols, and from human handlers and the equipment and containers used to collect, store and transport the raw milk.\n\nRaw milk is known to harbor diverse strains of bacteria that strongly influence shelf life, sensory qualities and safety of fluid milk, as well as that of fermented dairy products such as cheese and yogurt.

The remaining bacteria can still cause spoilage and quality defects in dairy foods.\n\nResearchers found that a 'core community' of microbes remains constant throughout the seasons and across farms where the milk is collected. This core community represented 29 different bacterial groups and included high proportions of streptococcus and staphylococcus, as well as Clostridiales, bacteria frequently associated with dairy cattle. The study revealed that milk collected in the spring contained the most diverse bacterial communities with the highest total cell numbers and highest proportions of Actinobacteria (such as actinomyces and streptomyces), one of the largest known groups of bacteria. The group includes some pathogens.\n\nResearchers also found that the bacterial composition of raw milk stored in silos at processing plants was distinct from that of the tanker trucks.

Mod.AS, edited]\nhttp://www.ynet.co.il/Ext/Comp/ArticleLayout/CdaArticlePrintPreview/0,2506,L-4842350,00.html\n\n\nTwo patients are hospitalized at Meir Medical and another patient at Schneider Hospital in Petach Tikvah. They suffer from brucellosis following the consumption of unpasteurized camel milk produced by 'Bereshit'. This was reported today (Tue 16 Aug 2016) from the Ministry of Health. Their condition is mild to moderate. Last week, 2 children were hospitalized for mild to moderate condition at Ichilov Hospital, after drinking camel milk marketed by the said company. Following their admission, MOH officials ordered the destruction of 4 tons of camel milk.\n\nM. Sh. (64) and his wife from Kfar Sava have suffered high fever during the recent weeks.'Four months ago, we started to drink camel milk of Bereshit, after being convinced that it had medicinal properties,' he said. 'They told us that many people drink this milk, and everything was fine. We did not think anything would happen to us, even if the milk was unpasteurized.'\n \nHe said, 'They told us that the production is supervised and controlled and insisted that there was nothing to worry about.' But 3 weeks ago he and his wife began to feel ill and suffered from high fever. 'After 4 days of unexplained elevated body temperature, we went to the family doctor; she referred us to tests, but nothing was found. The fever did not decline; we suffered madening sweat bouts, weakness and loss of appetite,' he said. 'Throughout the period, we did not know what we had; we did a series of tests, and, even when they asked us if we had connection with animals, we responded negatively because we did not see the connection,' said M.Sh, 'until we read, last Thursday, about the 2 children infected by brucellosis and hospitalized at Ichilov and remembered that we similarly drank Bereshit milk'. He went to the Meir hospital [Kefar Saba], and after some tests it was decided to hospitalize him. 'My blood was sent to the reference laboratory, and they immediately started to treat me intravenously with antibotics. Yesterday [15 Aug 2016], the preliminary results confirmed the presence of the brucellosis bacterium. My wife has also been tested, and it is considered that she also got brucellosis,' said [the patient]. 'I am expected to stay a week in the hospital and have to take the medication for another 6 weeks.'\n \nIn the Schneider Children's Hospital [Petach Tiqva], a girl suspected of brucellosis after also drinking the Bereshit camel milk is hospitalized [see comment].\n \nDr. Michal Katzir, a specialist in infectious diseases, Infectious Diseases Unit in the Meir Medical Center, said: '_Brucella_ is a bacterium transmitted in unpasteurized milk. The disease is usually expressed as fever, which can be accompanied by non-specific signs such as weakness, loss of appetite, weight loss and more. There may also be signs such as pain, infection of joints and bones,and it may involve nearly all body systems.\n \n'Most people develop the disease within 2 weeks to a month from exposure to the infective product, but it can be delayed. Therefore, a person who had consumed unpasteurized dairy products and developed symptoms should be examined. The blood tests include cultures and antibodies which testify for the presence of the bug. Recently, a considerable increase in the number of brucellosis patients has been recorded; it is therefore very important to avoid consuming unpasteurized dairy products and milk.'\n \nThe Health Ministry issued a closure order for the 'Bereshit milk' on Thursday [11 Aug 2016] and decided to destroy the products. A hearing of the company owner was scheduled for today [16 Aug 2016], but he has asked to postpone it due to illness, and therefore the hearing will be held next week. At the same time, it was decided to file a complaint against the company with respect to maintenance of food in inadequate conditions from an unknown source and without identification while endangering public health.\n\n[Byline: Rotem Elizera]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The infective milk was traced to a business located in Moshav Sitria near Rehovot, which sells camel milk under the label 'Bereshit (Genesis) Milk', coined 'Milk from Eden' on the plant's web-site, which includes a list of health conditions against which the product is advertised to be curative.\n\nOn 11 Aug 2016, the MOH district director, Dr. Ofra Chavkin, issued a closure order to shut down the moshav business where the milk is sold. A press release, indicating the brucella contamination, was issued by the ministry at http://www.health.gov.il/NewsAndEvents/SpokemanMesseges/Pages/11082016_3.aspx.\n\nAn interview on the brucellosis issue, with Prof. Shai Ashkenazi, infectious disease specialist at the Schneider Children's Hospital, was screened by Israel's Channel 1 News on 16 Aug 2016. Prof Ashkenazi referred to a 17-year-old girl suffering an immune-depressive condition, who had been drinking the product for 3 months before admittance to the hospital in a concerning condition, including a severe weigh-loss and arthritis. Her condition has improved following the several 1st days of the prescribed treatment. The expert expressed concern about the consumption of unpasteurized milk ('retreating hundreds of years backwards'), which could have caused additional, hitherto unreported or not yet recognised infections. The recognition may be delayed since the course of this disease may be long, signs developing slowly, and sometimes remaining insidious. - Mod.AS]\n\n******\n[2] Comment\nDate: Mon 15 Aug 2016\nFrom: Michael van Straten <vanstraten@hachaklait.co.il> [edited]\n\n\nRe: Brucellosis - Israel (02): camel milk, human infection susp, RFI\n-----------------------------------\nIt must be stressed that the sale of raw camel milk (RCM), described in the above ProMED-mail post, was not clandestine; for years this product has been openly advertised on the internet and through other public media. The most important question from the public health point of view remains unanswered: How is it possible that RCM is being sold to the public without intervention of the authorities?\n\n_Brucella melitensis_ has been isolated from camel milk at least as early as 1992 (Ref. 1). Since then, such events have not been uncommon. Indeed, even in Israel, human brucellosis following ingestion of infected camel milk has been documented and published (Ref. 2).\n\nAccording to media sources (http://www.globes.co.il/news/article.aspx?did=1001145581, Hebrew), the camel farm in question was warned a year ago by the Ministry of Health about the sale of RCM; no actual measures were taken until the present cluster of brucellosis in children was made public.\n\nThe situation is even worse: RCM is specifically being sold to and consumed by individuals belonging to sub-populations, including children, with malfunctioning immune systems. Individuals suffering from cancer, Crohn's disease, auto-immune diseases and other syndromes are lured to purchase RCM by evidence-deficient claims that it can cure these illnesses.\n\nReferences\n1.

Karnataka Milk Federation (KMF) has also stopped purchasing milk from the farm due to the disease and has decided to resume only after getting clearance from its veterinarians.\n\nThe Brucellosis is a bacterial disease chiefly affecting cattle and causing undulant fever in humans.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Bovine brucellosis is usually caused by _Brucella abortus_, less frequently by _B. melitensis_ (which affects mainly goats and sheep), and occasionally by _B. suis_ (porcine brucellosis). Infection is widespread globally. Several countries in Northern and Central Europe, Canada, Japan, Australia and New Zealand are believed to be free from _B. abortus_.\n\nClinically, the disease is characterised in cattle by one or more of the following signs: abortion, retained placenta, orchitis (testicular inflammation), epididymitis (inflammation of the epididymis, a tube at the back of the testicle) and, rarely, arthritis, with excretion of the organisms in uterine discharges and in milk. Diagnosis depends on the isolation of _Brucella_ bacteria from abortion material, udder secretions or from tissues removed at post-mortem. Presumptive diagnosis can be made by assessing specific cell-mediated or serological responses to _Brucella_ antigens.\n\nThough both _B. abortus_ and _B. melitensis_ are known to be endemic in India (Ref), only _B. abortus_ is mentioned in India's annual reports to the OIE. The bacteria _B. melitensis_ and _B. suis_, both highly pathogenic for humans, are included, in India's OIE report for 2015, in the list of diseases 'for which no information has been provided'.\n\nAccording to India's most recent available (2014) annual statistical-epidemiological report to the OIE, a total of 113 cases of bovine brucellosis in cattle and 1 in a buffalo, in 7 new outbreaks, were recorded during that year. The final annual report for 2015 is not yet available.

At a time when BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party] wings are agitating against killing of cows in the country, the Karnataka Government has ordered culling of 49 cows at a farm belonging to a legislature member in Kolar due to dreaded 'Brucellosis' disease found in these animals. Clinically, the disease is characterised in cattle by one or more of the following signs: abortion, retained placenta, orchitis (testicular inflammation), epididymitis (inflammation of the epididymis, a tube at the back of the testicle) and, rarely, arthritis, with excretion of the organisms in uterine discharges and in milk. \n\nThe Brucellosis is a bacterial disease chiefly affecting cattle and causing undulant fever in humans. According to India's most recent available (2014) annual statistical-epidemiological report to the OIE, a total of 113 cases of bovine brucellosis in cattle and 1 in a buffalo, in 7 new outbreaks, were recorded during that year.

This followed the hospitalisation of 3 children in the Ichilov and Laniado hospitals due to brucellosis infection associated with the consumption of the said product. The brucellosis bacteria may be found in unpasteurised milk. The closure has, for unknown reasons, been delayed until the current brucellosis cases of the milk consumers.\n\nThe Ministry's 'Sherut Hamazon' (National Food Service) personnel of the Central District Health Department Office started today (11 Aug 2016) the destruction of about 4 tons [4.06 tonnes] of unpasteurised camel's milk from an unknown source.

The management of the said plant insists that the nutritional value of whole pasteurised milk matches the value of fresh camel milk.\n\nBrucellosis, caused by _Brucella melitensis_, has become a serious public and animal health issue during the last 5 years, culminating in 2014 to record numbers (see 20150801.3550984). In 2014, camel infection, followed by human disease, was reported as well (see 20140622.2558324).\n\nThe camel population in Israel is estimated at 3500 (OIE 2015 data).

Israel's Milotal Frozen Vegetables company on Friday [12 Aug 2016] called on the public to return all its frozen French fries, after lab tests found listeria contamination in the product.\n\nThe Hebrew\u00ad language news website NRG on Thursday [11 Aug 2016] quoted officials from the company as saying that there was no danger to the public since the low temperatures of the freezing process would kill any bacteria. But in a statement on Friday, Milotal said: 'Following further examinations by an external lab received today, and for the sake of prudence, it has been decided to expand the recall scale to all frozen chips products.' The statement extends the list of products the company is recalling to include all frozen potato products.\n\nThe recall by Milotal came a day after the CEO of another major food producer, Salatey Shamir (Shamir Salads), said some of its tahina (sesame paste) products tainted with salmonella had hit the shelves, and most likely been eaten by Israeli consumers. Shamir is one of Israel's largest hummus manufacturers and the biggest customer of the Prince Tahina factory, which on Wednesday [10 Aug 2016] announced that its tahina was contaminated and recalled shipments sent to Israeli companies using it to make a wide variety of food products.\n\nSome 200 tons [203 tonnes] of Prince Tahina's paste were slated for destruction after Health Ministry inspectors said the product was tainted by the bacteria. Prince Tahina's recall came too late, Shamir Salads chief executive officer Ami Guy claimed on Thursday in an interview with the Ynet news website. 'The tahina supplier notified us too late. We've already been producing this [tainted tahina] for 10 days. We can assume that people have eaten from these products,' Guy said.\n\n'In the wake of [Prince Tahina's] notice and in coordination with the Health Ministry and the National Food Service, company management decided to recall all products made with this ingredient,' a statement from Shamir said on Thursday. 'We ask customers not to consume these products.'\n\nThe list of products feared to be contaminated is as follows:\nAll hummus products from the brands Shufersal, Yesh, Shamir, Asli, Hamutag, Delicatessen, Salatey Habait, Yohananof and Picnic, with expiry dates between 1 and 18 Sep 2016.\n\nAll tahina products from the brands Shufersal, Yesh, Shamir, Asli, Hamutag, Delicatessen, Salatey Habait, Yohananof and Picnic, with expiry dates between 16 Sep and 3 Oct 2016.\n\nAll eggplant\u00ad tahina products from the brands Shufersal, Yesh, Shamir, Asli, Hamutag, Delicatessen, Salatey Habait, Yohananof and Picnic, with expiry dates between 1 and 18 Sep 2016.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[3] Salmonella in salads\nDate: Thu 11 Aug 2016\nSource: Jerusalem Online [summ., edited]\nhttp://www.jerusalemonline.com/news/in-israel/health-and-environment/salmonella-tainted-israeli-salads-recalled-also-in-europe-22919\n\n\nSalmonella scandal: contaminated products taken off the shelves in Israel and in Europe\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe Knesset's Health [sic; should read State Control; see comment] Committee will hold an emergency meeting in order to discuss the recent incidents in which salmonella [bacteria] were discovered in Israeli foods. As a result of the contamination, thousands of products belonging to Shamir Salads were taken off the shelves today [11 Aug 2016], not only in Israel but also in Europe.\n\nThousands of products were taken off the shelves today (Thursday) due to another case of salmonella contamination -- this time in packages of HaNasich tahina that were supplied to the company Shamir Salads. As a result of the discovery, one of the largest tahina factories in Israel was closed. While everyone is still trying to understand why reports of the contamination were so late to arrive, the Knesset's Committee announced it will hold an emergency meeting in order to discuss the 2nd salmonella scandal to take place in Israel within 2 days and to try and stop the next failure from taking place.\n\nThe source of the contamination was located at HaNasich's tahina factory, where suspicions that the products were contaminated emerged as early as the end of July [2016]. The tahina factory's owner took responsibility for the failure, as a result of which 200 tons [203 tonnes] of salads were destroyed, but failures were also recorded at Shamir Salads' factory and at the Israeli Health Ministry.\n\nThe investigation of the failures found that Shamir Salads did not inspect one of the main ingredients it uses in its products, and it is still unclear why the failure was not discovered somewhere along the production line. This was not the 1st time that Shamir Salads' factory has been involved in failures, and production was brought to a halt at the factory several times in the past.\n\nMeanwhile, the Israeli salmonella scandal reached Europe, where Shamir Salads are also marketed, as hundreds of European chain stores and supermarkets received an email instructing them to take Shamir Salads products off their shelves.\n\n[byline: Tom Dolev]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The salmonella-tainted cereals recall (see 20160806.4399003, 20160807.4399991) which has engaged Israel's media, consumers and politicians since 4 Aug 2016, was followed by enhanced control activities of the state's relevant authorities and subsequently to the concerning findings and measures described above.\n\nThe State Control Committee of the Knesset (Israeli parliament) held an emergency meeting on the 'Cornflakes storm' on Thursday afternoon, 11 Aug 2016.

The region receives rainfall during June to August (Kharif season). Animal herding including cattle, camels, sheep and goats is the main profession of the people living in the mountains of Dhofar. A serosurvey conducted in 1985-86 in the animals in Dhofar Governorate revealed a prevalence of brucellosis of 8 per cent in camels, 6.4 per cent in goats and sheep and 3.3 per cent in cattle.\n\nThe northern Governorates in Oman have shown a consistently low incidence for brucellosis in the past decades. However, recently there has been a rise in the number of cases. A cluster of 55 brucellosis cases was identified during the period May to July 2016 from the coastal area in the north of Oman mainly in the North Batinah Governorate. The index case was confirmed by positive serology for _Brucella melitensis_ and a positive blood culture on 15 May 2016. Epidemiological investigation revealed 6 additional cases in the family. There was no history of visiting or staying in southern endemic area of Dhofar. There was a history of consumption of locally produced goat cheese. The local cheese producer had over 100 goats and a cow in his farm; it was his traditional family business.\n\nAdditional cases and family clusters were diagnosed during the period of intensive surveillance (15 May -- 31 Jul 2016). Several had a past history of consuming the locally produced goat cheese. The Ministry of Agriculture conducted a serosurvey among the farm animals of the cheese producer and the 23 seropositive goats were culled. Further investigations are ongoing and long term actions will be decided on the information in collaboration with the Ministry of Agriculture and the Municipality. A joint plan of action has been drafted to deal with the surge of the disease in the northern governorates of Oman with the aim of eradicating the diseases from animals in this part of the country.\n\nAs of 31 Jul 2016, 236 cases of brucellosis were reported to the Surveillance department at MoH, of which 71 (30 per cent) were from northern governorates. This proportion is over 3 times of the average of 2010 to 2015 (8.1 per cent).\n\n--\nDr Seif Al-Abri\nDr Idris al-Abaidani\nDr Ali Al-Moqbali\nSalem al-Mahrooqi\nMinistry of Health\nMuscat\nSultanate of Oman\n<salabri@gmail.com>\n\n[ProMED-mail thanks the authors for submitting this report.\n\nBrucellosis is zoonotic infection that can be spread not only by direct contact with the animal carrier but also by the ingestion of unpasteurized dairy products such as milk and cheese. The infection is also known as undulant fever, related to the occurrence of 1-3 week febrile periods separated by 1-3 days of afebrility. This occurs more likely with _Brucella melitensis_ (acquired from goats) than with _B. abortus_ (cattle) and _B. suis_ (swine).\n\nThe infection can be subclinical. Acute symptomatic brucellosis is generally manifest with nonspecific symptoms such as fever, chills, night sweats, anorexia, and an increased sense of ill health. The disease can be diagnosed serologically and/or by blood culture. The organism may grow quite slowly on primary isolation, and the clinician should make the microbiology laboratory aware of this potential diagnosis.\n\nLocalized infection may occur. Sites for localization include the skeletal system (1), heart valves (2) and urinary tract (3). Genitourinary [GU] brucellosis may present identically to GU tuberculosis. Psychiatric manifestations such as depression and anxiety are possible as late symptoms of brucellosis (4, 5), so-called chronic neurobrucellosis. It remains unclear whether active brucella infection is present at that time. Overt central nervous system infection can, however, include meningitis and encephalitis (6,7).\n\nReferences\n----------\n1. Beeching NJ, Madkour MM. Brucellosis.

The irrational belief in raw milk as a health food is widely supported on the internet and public health people are said to be involved in a government conspiracy against users and suppliers.\n\n--\nJoshua Fierer, MD\nProfessor of Medicine\nUC San Diego School of Medicine\n<jfierer@ucsd.edu>\n\n[ProMED thanks Dr Fierer for his comment. I saw cases of _S._ Dublin associated with unpasteurized milk from the Altadena Dairy during my ID fellowship at Stanford 1974-1976.\n\nIn the March 2012 issue of Emerging Infectious Diseases (Langer AJ, Ayers T, Grass J, et al: Nonpasteurized dairy products, disease outbreaks, and state laws -- United States, 1993-2006. Emerg Infect Dis 2012; 18(3): 385-91; available at http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/18/3/11-1370_article.htm), the authors reported on 121 foodborne outbreaks (with 4413 cases of reported illness) caused by contaminated dairy products, and 73 (60 percent) were involved with unpasteurized dairy products; 65 (54 percent) involved cheese, 42 percent made from unpasteurized milk; and 56 involved fluid milk, 82 percent involving unpasteurized milk. In these outbreaks, _Campylobacter_ was responsible for 54 percent of the outbreaks, following by _Salmonella_ spp (22 percent), enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ (13 percent), _Brucella_ spp (4 percent), _Listeria_ spp (4 percent), and _Shigella_ spp (3 percent).\n\nA recently published paper (Claeys WL, Cardoen S, Daube G, et al: Raw or heated cow milk consumption: Review of risks and benefits. Food Control 2013; 31(1): 251-62) is available at http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodcont.2012.09.035. It addresses the arguments that pasteurization removes significant nutrients from milk.\n\nThe abstract, introduction, and conclusions are given below with the citations removed.\n\n'Abstract\n---------\n'In the context of the prevailing trend toward more natural products, there seems to be an increasing preference for raw milk consumption as raw milk is associated with several perceived health benefits that are believed to be destroyed upon heating. However, many human pathogens can be isolated from raw cow milk. The prevalence of foodborne pathogens in raw cow milk varies, but their presence has been demonstrated in many surveys, and foodborne infections have been repeatedly reported for _Campylobacter_, _Salmonella_ spp and human pathogenic verocytotoxin-producing _Escherichia coli_ [VTEC]. In industrialized countries, milk-borne and milk product-borne outbreaks represent 2-6 percent of the bacterial foodborne outbreaks.\n\n'The aim of this review is to present scientifically sound data regarding the risks and benefits related to the consumption of raw and heated cow milk. Both microbiological aspects (such as the prevalence of milk-borne pathogens, pathogen growth inhibition by antimicrobial systems and by lactic acid producing bacteria, probiotic bacteria, etc) and nutritional or health aspects (nutritional value, immunity, allergies, lactose intolerance, diabetes, milk digestibility, etc) are considered.\n\n'As such, it is demonstrated that consumption of raw milk poses a realistic health threat due to a possible contamination with human pathogens. It is therefore strongly recommended that milk should be heated before consumption. With the exception of an altered organoleptic profile [taste], heating (in particular ultra high temperature and similar treatments) will not substantially change the nutritional value of raw milk or other benefits associated with raw milk consumption.\n\n'Introduction\n------------\n'The consumption of raw milk is not well-documented, but in the context of the current trend toward 'consuming natural' and 'purchasing locally,' raw milk consumption is becoming more popular. This is nourished by the perception that heating destroys the nutritional and health benefits of milk, and can even induce some detrimental effects. However, due to its high nutritional value together with the neutral pH and high water activity [content?], raw milk serves as an excellent growth medium for different micro-organisms, whose multiplication depends mainly on temperature and on competing micro-organisms and their metabolic products. In order to guarantee its microbial safety and to prolong its shelf-life, milk is heat treated.\n\n'The impact of milk pasteurization on public health can be clearly illustrated by means of historical data. Before 1938, an estimated 25 percent of all foodborne and waterborne disease outbreaks in the USA were associated with milk, whereas nowadays, the percentage of such outbreaks associated with milk is estimated to be below 1 percent. Between 1880 and 1907, 29 milk-borne outbreaks were reported on average each year in the USA. With the adoption of pasteurization in 1938, milk-borne diseases dropped to only 46 outbreaks during the 19-year period from 1973 to 1992, corresponding to an average of 2.4 outbreaks each year. A recent report of the USA CDC indicates that the vast majority of milk-borne outbreaks in the USA are in states that permit the sale of raw milk. In England and Wales, the great majority of milk-borne outbreaks during the 1980s were attributed to the consumption of raw milk. In Scotland, a similar situation existed until the sale of unpasteurized milk was prohibited in 1983, which led to a significant drop of the incidence of diseases related to liquid milk consumption.\n\n'In the mid-20th century, the main illnesses associated with raw milk consumption were brucellosis and tuberculosis. These have been eradicated as milk-borne diseases in developed countries, mainly through herd certification programs which included culling of infected animals, the installation of refrigerated bulk tanks for milk collection on farms, and the introduction of pasteurization. In the past, pasteurization conditions were standardized based on the destruction of _Mycobacterium bovis_, a relatively heat-resistant non-sporogenic bacterium that formerly was among the most serious pathogenic bacteria present in milk. Pasteurization standards today are based upon the destruction of _Coxiella burnetii_, the most heat-resistant milk-borne zoonotic pathogen known. In the past 30 years, several previously unrecognized foodborne bacterial infections, including infection with _Campylobacter jejuni_, _Listeria monocytogenes_, and _Escherichia coli_ strain O157 (or more general verocytotoxin-producing pathogenic _E. coli_ [VTEC]), have emerged as significant causes of human morbidity and mortality. Pathogens mainly present in raw milk today are, among others, _C. jejuni_, _Salmonella_ spp., _Staphylococcus aureus_, _Listeria monocytogenes_, pathogenic _E. coli_ and _Yersinia enterocolitica_.\n\n'In Europe, the current regulatory microbial criteria for raw cow milk are less than or equal to 100 000 colony forming units (cfu)/ml for plate count (at 30 deg C/86 deg F) and less than or equal to 400 000 cfu/ml for somatic cells, as is stipulated in Regulation (EC) 853/2004 laying down specific hygiene rules on the hygiene of foodstuffs. In this Regulation, health requirements for production animals and hygienic requirements on milk production holdings (such as regarding premises and equipment, hygiene during milking, collection, and transport, staff hygiene) are established as well. In general, raw milk intended for human consumption must meet the requirements of the General Food Law (Regulation (EC) 178/2002) and be free of pathogens. Even though improvements in hygiene resulted in routine production of raw cow milk with less than 20 000 cfu (total flora)/ml), this does not guarantee raw milk to be free of pathogens. In approximately 1-6 percent of the human outbreaks reported in developed countries, milk has been identified as the vehicle of infection. An overview of foodborne disease reports from different industrialized countries indicates that milk and milk products are implicated in 1-5 percent of the total bacterial foodborne outbreaks, with 39.1 percent attributed to milk, 53.1 percent to cheese, and 7.8 percent to other milk products.\n\n'Whereas milk quality and safety has been the topic of many research studies, raw milk still continues to be an issue for debate, which is primarily held on the internet where often non-scientifically based information circulates. Therefore, the aim of this study is to evaluate the risks and benefits related to the consumption of raw cow milk at one hand, and to evaluate the effect of heat treatments of milk on these risks and benefits on the other hand, considering the microbiological as well as the nutritional (health) aspects.\n\n'Conclusions\n-----------\n'In this evaluation it is clearly demonstrated that the consumption of raw milk poses a realistic and unnecessary health threat because of its possible contamination with pathogenic bacteria. It is therefore recommended to heat [raw] milk before consumption, especially when served to young children, pregnant women, or any person suffering from a chronic disease or a suppressed immune system. In this context the attention is drawn to raw milk provided on farms to the general public (such as during a school visit) and raw milk distributors allowing the automatic supply of raw milk from a bulk reservoir to the consumer.\n\n'Historical data show that the pasteurization of milk has led to improved public health, and more recent data on occasional raw milk consumption indicate the hazard of bacterial infections, which could be avoided by a heat treatment. At present, thermal treatment remains the most frequently used and most effective method to increase the microbiological safety of milk without substantially changing the nutritional value of milk or other benefits associated with raw milk consumption. Table 4 [see source URL above] summarizes the main (claimed) benefits of raw milk consumption and the (claimed) detrimental effects of heating discussed in the present paper. Almost all arguments put forward by raw milk proponents for not heating milk, can be refuted, and the only substantial disadvantage of heating is the change in the organoleptic profile [taste] of milk. It is clear that this 'detrimental' effect of heating does not countervail the risk posed by raw milk consumption, namely of a milk-borne pathogen infection, which can have serious health consequences.' - Mod.LL]", "summary": "An overview of foodborne disease reports from different industrialized countries indicates that milk and milk products are implicated in 1-5 percent of the total bacterial foodborne outbreaks, with 39.1 percent attributed to milk, 53.1 percent to cheese, and 7.8 percent to other milk products.

She presented with on and off abdominal pain and fever since 13 Apr 2016 and was admitted to a public hospital twice from 18 to 20 Apr 2016 and from 12 to 26 May 2016, respectively.\n\nHer blood specimen collected on 13 May 2016 yielded _Brucella melitensis_. She was treated with antimicrobials and her condition was stable.\n\nShe had traveled to Mainland China in mid-March 2016 and had a history of preparing soup with lamb placenta and meat during her stay. She had consumed the soup and lamb meat but not the lamb placenta. Her home contacts were asymptomatic. She had no occupational exposure to animals, their carcasses or internal organs. She reported no history of contact with live animals. Investigation is on-going.\n\nAccording to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), people can get the disease when they are in contact with infected animals or animal products contaminated with the bacterium. Animals that are most commonly infected include sheep, cattle, goats, and pigs.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Brucellosis is zoonotic infection that can be spread not only by direct contact with the animal carrier but also by the ingestion of unpasteurized dairy products such as milk and cheese. The infection is also known as undulant fever, related to the occurrence of 1-3 week febrile periods separated by 1-3 days of afebrility. This occurs more likely with _B. melitensis_ (acquired from goats) as compared to _B. abortus_ (cattle) and _B. suis_ (swine).\n\nThe infection can be subclinical. Acute symptomatic brucellosis is generally manifest with nonspecific symptoms such as fever, chills, night sweats, anorexia, and an increased sense of ill health. The disease can be diagnosed serologically and/or by blood culture. The organism may grow quite slowly on primary isolation, and the clinician should make the microbiology laboratory aware of this potential diagnosis.\n\nLocalized infection may occur. Sites for localization include the skeletal system (1), heart valves (2) and urinary tract (3). Genitourinary [GU] brucellosis may present identically to GU tuberculosis. Psychiatric manifestations such as depression and anxiety are possible as late symptoms of brucellosis (4,5), so-called chronic neurobrucellosis. It remains unclear whether active brucella infection is present at that time. Overt CNS infection can, however, include meningitis and encephalitis (6,7).\n\nReferences\n----------\n1.

The disease was unintentionally introduced to elk and bison in the greater Yellowstone area on at least 5 separate occasions over the past century, but, more recently, is transmitting from elk to cattle and undermining livestock control efforts.\n\n'This study provides the most definitive evidence to date that brucellosis is now self-sustaining in Montana elk and has spread at an increased rate in elk populations outside of the feeding grounds,' said Pauline Kamath, USGS ecologist and lead author of the study.\n\nFederal scientists developed and analyzed a genomic dataset of _Brucella abortus_, the bacteria that causes brucellosis, which spanned 30 years and included samples from cattle, bison and elk. Four out of the 5 strains are now primarily associated with elk and originated from the Wyoming feeding grounds, where state and federal land managers provide feed for elk in the winter.\n\nTwo of these elk-associated strains have spread at about 4 to 8 kilometers [about 2.5 to 5 miles] per year. Scientists conclude that elk are the most likely source of current brucellosis outbreaks in livestock.\n\nThe 5th genetically-distinct strain originated and was mainly found in bison of Yellowstone National Park. This strain appeared to be spreading less rapidly.\n\nPreviously, it was not known whether elk could sustain the disease in the absence of bison or supplemental feeding grounds. This study shows that elk, in some areas distant from the feeding grounds, have strains that are unrelated to bison, suggesting that management of bison and feeding grounds may not affect brucellosis dynamics in these other elk populations, where the disease has been spreading.\n\n'Any attempt to control the rate of spread in wildlife must be evaluated at the ecosystem scale and include an effective strategy to address infection in elk across the greater Yellowstone area. Focus on bison alone, as was suggested in the past, will not meet the disease eradication objective and conserve wildlife,' said the National Park Service's Rick Wallen, lead wildlife biologist for the bison program in Yellowstone National Park and co-author on the study.\n\nBrucellosis is a disease found in livestock and humans worldwide. Infected animals often experience a termination of pregnancy and further transmission occurs through direct contact with the fetuses and tissues.\n\nIn North America, the greater Yellowstone area is the last remaining reservoir of _Brucella abortus_. Over 20 cattle and farmed bison herds have been infected in Wyoming, Idaho and Montana since 2002, and the presence of the disease within livestock results in additional testing requirements and trade restrictions.\n\nThe study is a collaborative effort between the USGS, Northern Arizona University, University of Montana, U.S. Department of Agriculture, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services, Idaho Department of Fish and Game, Wyoming Game and Fish Department, Montana Fish Wildlife and Parks, the National Park Service and the University of New Hampshire.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The article 'Genomics Reveals Historic and Contemporary Transmission Dynamics of a Bacterial Disease among Wildlife and Livestock' published in Nature Communications can be accessed at http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2016/160429/ncomms11448/pdf/ncomms11448.pdf.\n\nBovine brucellosis (caused by _Brucella abortus_) has caused devastating losses to farmers in the United States over the last century.

To date, this disease has not been documented outside of the western half of the state.\n\nGame and Fish has been conducting statewide surveillance for brucellosis since 1991.

During the last week [21-26 Feb 2016], 14 additional primipara cows [1st lactation], out of 200 in the cohort group (7 percent) have tested positive to _Brucella melitensis_ and consequently culled. This rate is lower than the one detected in previous tests.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Brucellosis, caused by _Brucella melitensis_ (field strain biotype 1) was detected in October 2015 in the dairy cattle operation of Kibbutz Revivim (see map at http://tinyurl.com/gqfvw9c) in an aborted calf. Subsequently, 135 dairy cows (out of a total of about 1300 in this segment) were identified as infected and subsequently destroyed. Since then, several repeated serum and milk tests have been performed by Israel's Veterinary Services & Animal Health (VSAH) in the dairy operation described above to try detect additional cases, aiming at recovering the farm's status as free of brucellosis. So far, the total number of animals found infected (most of them primipara = 1st lactation) is about 200, all culled against compensation. The total number of cattle, all ages, in the said collective farm exceeds 2000. It is one of Israel's 10 leading dairy operations, with an annual production of about 7.5 million liters. An initial report of the event was published by the VSAH on 2 Nov 2015 (see 20151103.3762268). An updated interim epidemiological report is anticipated.\n\nIn response to our requests for information, we have received, from the Public Health Services in Israel's Ministry of Health (MOH), the following data, for which we are very grateful:\n'1. In relation to the _B. melitensis_ event in Kibbutz Revivim:\na. 5 persons have been recognised as cases.\nb. 2 of the patients belonged to the personnel of the dairy cattle operation, 3 others were laborers in the Kibbutz.\nc. the start of their respective illness took place during weeks 45-52 of 2015.\nd. All patients were males, aged 15-44.\ne. Hospitalisation was not required (ambulatory treatment).\n\n2. The total (countrywide) number of reported brucellosis cases in humans in Israel during 2015 was 430.'\n\nThe VSAH launched investigations into possible spread from Revivim to contact farms. The Grofit dairy farm, in the Arava region (southeast Israel; see map at http://tinyurl.com/hrq323v) was found to have purchased some cattle from Revivim. When tested, several positive animals were discovered and culled (see archive no 20151204.3840328). We have recently noted that this farm has been retested twice without additional cases detected.\n\nLeakage of _B. melitensis_ into high-yielding industrial dairy cattle operations reflects the worsening of the brucellosis situation among Israel's sheep/goats, described in detail in posting 20150801.3550984. The following statistics on the total annual number of human 'Malta fever' (cases) have been published by Israel's Ministry of Health: 2005 (141); 2006 (138); 2007 (152); 2008 (149); 2009 (136); 2010 (139); 2011 (127); 2012 (183); 2013 (336); 2014 (596); and in 2015, as reported above, 430. While 2014 seems to have been a record year, 2015's figures are still higher than in the years before.\n\nThere are numerous nomadic an backyard sheep and goat flocks in the vicinity of Revivim, in which brucellosis is known to be present. It may be assumed that the infection originated in such flocks. The route of _B. melitensis_ introduction from neighboring infected flocks into the (zero-grazing) Kibbutz dairy farm has yet to be established. An anecdotal source mentioned crows transporting residues of sheep/goats placentae into the water troughs of the dairy farm. In previous cases on cattle farms in Israel, stray dogs were mentioned as doing the same.\n\nFor decades, brucellosis in livestock in Israel has been caused exclusively by _B. melitensis_. The pathogen of bovine brucellosis, _B. abortus_, which causes massive abortions in this species, has long been eradicated (last case in 1984). _B. suis_ has never been diagnosed in Israel.\n\nSeveral issues related to this event are under deliberation; the parliamentary 'Health Committee' of Israel's Knesset discussed the event on 23 Nov 2015 and issued a press communiqu\u00e9 mentioning the approval of a budget of 50 million Israeli Shekels (about USD 13 million) for immediate control measures in animals (http://main.knesset.gov.il/News/PressReleases/Pages/press231115u.aspx; in Hebrew). A previous national attempt to control _B. melitensis_ in Israel, undertaken during the 1990's (last century), led to encouraging results but the project was not sustained due to discontinued budgetary support (see item 2 in archive no 20140622.2558324). This lesson deserves to be remembered. A carefully designed, multistage _B. melitensis_ control plan, taking into consideration all segments of the animal populations and their respective stakeholders, may have chances of success only if budgets and trained manpower in field and laboratory are secured for its entire duration. Such a project may aim at reducing, as much as possible, the infection rate in small ruminants and subsequently in humans, while preventing altogether outbreaks on cattle farms. Attempting to a complete durable eradication of the agent from Israel, as successfully achieved in relation to _B. abortus_, could be considered only if the project encompasses both Israel and the West Bank, cooperatively. Such a project was under advanced stages of planning within a regional animal-health project, which was operational during the 1990's, lamentably discontinued in 2002, due to the deteriorated political situation.\n\nVaccination of female calves between the ages of 2-6 months with strain 19 brucellosis live attenuated vaccine has been compulsorily applied in Israel for decades; this vaccination was officially discontinued on 1 Jan 2014 (see 20151103.3762268). In case this policy change was preceded by a risk-assessment, its details will be interesting. The event in Revivim is expected to serve as a field experiment of real-life dimensions enabling to check whether there is a difference between vaccinated and non-vaccinated animals concerning their infection and their respective shedding of the _B. melitensis_ bacteria. Results of such observations and their evaluation are expected with interest within and beyond Israel.

The problem is exacerbated by the fact that nomadic cattle farmers like the Maasai often do not use prevention methods, such as milk pasteurization and veterinary care for livestock.\n\nThe disease has been largely contained in Sub-Saharan Africa. But it is still common in Kenya and Tanzania, the researchers found.\n\nThe scientists screened samples from about 2300 animals and 1140 people in selected areas of Kenya and Tanzania. They found the disease in 22.7 per cent of the human samples, far above the 3-8 per cent incidence level found in previous pan-African studies.\n\n'In both countries, screening of the disease should be considered in patients who have not responded to treatments for malaria,' as both diseases cause similar symptoms and can be hard to distinguish, the paper says.\n\nThe most common species of Brucella bacteria are found in cattle and goats, says the study's lead researcher Andrew Chota, an agricultural scientist at the Tanzania Veterinary Laboratory Authority, a government agency.\n\nJo Halliday, an epidemiologist at Glasgow University in the United Kingdom, tells SciDev.Net that controlling brucellosis is important to avoid animal deaths and illness in humans, which both cause economic losses.\n\n'Vaccination of livestock has been used in many countries to greatly reduce the impacts of this disease,' says Halliday, who has conducted studies on brucellosis in Tanzania. She adds that other control options include boiling or pasteurization of milk to prevent animal to human transmission via this route of infection.\n\nThe most important way to control brucellosis, according to Chota, is to raise awareness of the disease and the economic losses it can cause to farms and families.\n\nOnce that knowledge is well disseminated, he says people would see the value of control strategies like boiling milk, buying pasteurized milk and hiring trained veterinarians to help with calving and the handling of placentas and aborted foetuses.\n\n[Byline: Gilbert Nakweya]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Brucellosis is one of the diseases listed as 'WHO's 7 neglected endemic zoonoses.' It is an ancient disease with host-specific evolutionary mechanisms that allow it to hide from or manipulate cellular immunity and achieve intracellular persistence. The disease yields low fatality rates but can cause substantial disabilities. It is one of the zoonotic diseases officially addressed by the international health agencies, WHO on the human side and the OIE on the animal side. Bovine brucellosis, caprine and ovine brucellosis, and porcine brucellosis are 3 disease entities included in OIE's official list of compulsorily reportable animal diseases.\n\nThe animal hosts of _B. melitensis_ are sheep, goats, cows and camels (biovars 1, 2, 3). _B. melitensis_ biovar 3 has also been found in Nile catfish and dogs. _B. abortus_ (biovars 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9) naturally infects cattle, bison, buffalo, elk, yak and camels.\n\nThe animal hosts of _B. suis_ are horses (biovar 1), pigs and wild boars (biovars 1, 2, 3), the European hare (biovar 2), caribou and reindeer (biovar 4), and rodents (biovar 5). _B. suis_ biovars 1, 3, 4 have been reported to cause human disease.\n\nHumans can also be infected from marine mammals (_B. ceti_ in whales, dolphins, porpoises) and, rarely, from canines (_B. canis_).\n\nOut of the 308 postings addressing brucellosis currently available in ProMED-mail's archive, only 2 are related to Sub-Saharan Africa, though brucellosis incidence in this region is considered to be high, particularly in cattle and goats.\n\nThe abstract of the paper, referenced in the above media report follows:\n\nChota, A.C., Magwisha, H._B., Stella, _B. et al.

There are several reports of occurrence of the disease in livestock populations especially in Tanzania and Kenya, suggesting chances of increased spread to humans, and the disease being misdiagnosed for malaria. The objective of this study was to determine brucellosis prevalence in livestock and incidence in humans among pastoralists and agro-pastoralists communities in some areas of Kenya and Tanzania. A total of 2349 ruminants were screened using different serological techniques, in the selected areas. Serum samples from the Southern Highlands Zone (SHZ), Northern zone (NZ) and Eastern Zone (EZ) were screened using Rose Bengal Plate Test (RBPT) antigen, and later positive samples were confirmed using competitive enzyme linked immune-sorbent assay (c-ELISA). Results showed prevalence of 11.4 percent in the SHZ (n=799), 2.4 percent in the EZ (n=169) and 1 percent in the NZ (n= 408). Milk ring test was used to test milk samples from Migori, West Pokot and Mwingi, and the prevalences recorded in cattle were 17.9 percent (n=56) in 2012 and 11.7 (n=77) in 2014. Within the same period, West Pokot recorded prevalence of up to 21.9 percent (n=96) in cattle and 16.7 percent (n=6) in goats. Generally, Migori had lower prevalence in Kenya, but being the 3rd lower in Tanzania and Kenya with the prevalence being 4.3 percent (n=70) in goats and 2.2 percent (n=45) in goats. Serum from cattle and goats were tested using compliment fixation test (CFT); showing 0.9 percent (n=212) prevalence in Migori. In West Pokot, the prevalence was 4.0 percent (n=101) in cattle, 20 percent (n=100) in goats and 13.8 percent (=29) in sheep; whereas in Mwingi prevalence was 4.75 percent (n=43) and 9.5 percent (n=21) in cattle and goats respectively. A total of 1140 human cases were followed up in selected study areas where livestock samples were collected, and an overall incidence of 22.7 percent (n=1140) was confirmed. Selected areas in Tanzania had an incidence of 28.2 percent (n=578) and in Kenya 17.1 percent (n=562). Brucellosis is endemic in many areas of Tanzania and Kenya and pose a high risk to human health.'\n\nThis paper, though confined to Kenya and Tanzania, and the current ProMED-mail posting will, hopefully, serve as a trigger to enhanced surveillance and improved reporting of this neglected zoonosis in all countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. - Mod.AS\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/97.]", "summary": "In West Pokot, the prevalence was 4.0 percent (n=101) in cattle, 20 percent (n=100) in goats and 13.8 percent (=29) in sheep; whereas in Mwingi prevalence was 4.75 percent (n=43) and 9.5 percent (n=21) in cattle and goats respectively. \n\nThe animal hosts of _B. suis_ are horses (biovar 1), pigs and wild boars (biovars 1, 2, 3), the European hare (biovar 2), caribou and reindeer (biovar 4), and rodents (biovar 5).

On the basis of false beliefs, [raw] milk is considered as a healthy product, naturally sterile, and can be consumed without having to boil it. This contributes to the high incidence of brucellosis as does the consumption of a traditional cheese known as 'Alkmara', very much appreciated by residents of the Mzab valley.\n\nThe situation induced the population to point out the responsibility of consumer associations, municipal health control services, and local trade services, and their failure to deal with the problem. It must be recalled that each case requires at least 6 months to heal, using a treatment that costs the general treasury over 120 000 Algerian Dinar [ca. USD 1000].\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-MENA\n<promed-mena@promedmail.org>\n\n[This infection, a bacterial zoonosis, is classified among the category B biowarfare agents. Natural transmission to humans occurs after occupational exposure or through ingestion of contaminated food products. Although brucellosis has become a rare entity in the United States and many industrialized nations because of animal vaccination programs, this condition remains a significant health problem in many developing countries.\n\nEach species of _Brucella_ has a specific animal reservoir in which chronic disease is present. The bacilli tend to localize in the reproductive organs of the animals, causing sterility and abortions, and are shed in large numbers in the animal's urine, milk, and placental fluid. This localization allows for efficient spread to farmers, veterinarians, slaughterhouse workers, and consumers.\n\nAmong the 4 species known to cause disease in humans, _Brucella melitensis_ (from goats, sheep, or camels) may be the most virulent, producing the most severe and acute cases of brucellosis with disabling complications. A prolonged course of illness, which may be associated with suppurative destructive lesions, is associated with _B. suis_ (from feral or commercially raised pigs) infection. _B. abortus_ (from cattle, buffalo, and camels) is associated with mild-to-moderate sporadic disease that is rarely associated with complications. _B. canis_ has a disease course that is indistinguishable from _B. abortus_ infection. - Mod.LL\n\nMaps of Algeria can be seen at http://www.ezilon.com/maps/images/africa/political-map-of-Algeria.gif\nand of Ghardaia at\nhttp://healthmap.org/promed/p/32014. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ]", "summary": "A ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n The number of brucellosis cases contracted through direct contact with infected livestock or consumption of fresh milk and milk products, especially traditional cheese, has reached about 363 cases during the current year, compared to 277 in 2014 and 116 cases in 2013. \n\nThe increasing incidence of brucellosis is the result of the reluctance of livestock owners and consumers to adhere to basic hygienic rules, and some breeders even refuse to vaccinate their livestock, arguing that vaccination causes abortion in pregnant females, and continue to use repeatedly potentially infected males for breeding.

Melitensis_ (field strain biotype 1) and destroyed, the State Veterinary Services launched investigations into possible spread to contact farms. The Grofit dairy farm, in the Arava region (southeast Israel; map at http://www.eyeonisrael.com/Israel-touring-map.html, select square 19) was found to have purchased some cattle from Revivim. When tested, several positive animals were discovered, 7 of which were reported in the above weekly circular 'Hachaklait'.\n\nLeakage of _B. melitensis_ into high-yielding industrial dairy cattle operations reflects the worsening brucellosis situation among Israel's sheep/goats, described in detail in posting 20150801.3550984. The following statistics on the total annual number of human 'Malta fever' cases have been published by Israel's Ministry of Health: 2005 - 141; 2006 - 138; 2007 - 152; 2008 - 149; 2009 - 136; 2010 - 139; 2011 - 127; 2012 - 183; 2013 - 336; 2014 - 596. According to the ministry's most recent available Weekly Epidemiological Report, dated 21 Nov 2015, the (preliminary) accumulated number of diagnosed new human brucellosis cases since the beginning of 2015 is 384, compared with 573 during the same period in 2014. While 2014 seems to have been a record year, 2015's figures are still higher than the years before.\n\nIt will be interesting to learn whether human cases have followed animal infection in the said cattle farms, if their personnel have undergone serological tests and, in case affirmative, what the results were.\n\nIt may be assumed that the infection in Revivim originated in neighboring grazing sheep/goat flocks. The route of _B. melitensis_ introduction from infected flocks into the (zero-grazing) Kibbutz dairy farm has yet to be established.\n\nFor decades, brucellosis in livestock in Israel has been caused exclusively by _B. melitensis_. The pathogen of bovine brucellosis, _B. abortus_, which causes massive abortions in this species, has long been eradicated (last case in 1984). _B. suis_ has never been diagnosed.\n\nThe main clinical damage caused by _B. melitensis_, when initially introduced into sheep and goat flocks, is abortion waves (mostly during the 3rd trimester of pregnancy); the abortion rate decreases in subsequent years. The financial losses to owners are significantly lower than the devastating damage to human health. This situation is an obstacle in obtaining the cooperation of owners (particularly in nomadic flocks) needed for effective control measures, including vaccination and animal identification. Such cooperation is more likely when measures are offered free of charge and full, immediate compensations are paid when animals are culled.\n\nThe affected dairy cattle farms have to undergo repeated tests, applying the 'test-and-slaughter' policy until declared free of infection. In case of excessive infection rate, it may become necessary to cull the entire herd. - Mod.AS\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/29822.]", "summary": "A ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n AS, summ., edited; subscription required]\nhttp://www.hachaklait.org.il\n\nIn the dairy operation of Kibbutz Grofit, 7 additional dairy cows have been found infected with _Brucella melitensis_ this week. promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Following the discovery of Brucellosis in the dairy cattle operation of Kibbutz Revivim in late October 2015 (references in 'see also'), where 135 dairy cows (out of about 1300) were initially found to be infected with _Br. \n\nLeakage of _B. melitensis_ into high-yielding industrial dairy cattle operations reflects the worsening brucellosis situation among Israel's sheep/goats, described in detail in posting 20150801.3550984. \n\nThe main clinical damage caused by _B. melitensis_, when initially introduced into sheep and goat flocks, is abortion waves (mostly during the 3rd trimester of pregnancy); the abortion rate decreases in subsequent years. \n\nIt will be interesting to learn whether human cases have followed animal infection in the said cattle farms, if their personnel have undergone serological tests and, in case affirmative, what the results were.

Results were received Wednesday [9 Dec 2015] from the Wyoming State Veterinary Laboratory (WSVL) in Laramie. Logan, with concurrence of USDA-APHIS, has designated the herd from which the reactor cows originated as 'brucellosis affected' as of Wed [9 Dec 2015].\n\nCattle from the Sublette County herd, located within Wyoming's Designated Surveillance Area (DSA), were positive to blood tests at the WSVL and the National Veterinary Services Laboratory (NVSL) in Ames, Iowa. Specified cattle from the DSA are required to be tested within 30 days prior to change of ownership or movement from counties within the DSA. The herd was quarantined on 19 Nov 2015 when preliminary tests were suspicious for brucellosis. The quarantine will remain in effect until the herd has undergone 3 consecutive, negative, whole-herd tests after any reactors have been removed from the herd.\n\nWhole-herd testing was conducted on the 'affected' herd on 3 and 4 Dec 2015, and additional reactor animals were identified. There are 5 contact herds also under quarantine for herd testing. The contact herds will be released from quarantine if their herd tests are negative.\n\nThe testing is being conducted as a cooperative effort between herd owners, Wyoming Livestock Board (WLSB) personnel, and private veterinary practitioners. Epidemiologic interviews with herd owners are ongoing and quarantine herd plans will be developed with each herd owner associated with the case. Epidemiologic tracing will continue in the upcoming weeks by WLSB and APHIS personnel.\n\n'Finding brucellosis in our DSA is not an unexpected event,' said Logan. 'We have a reservoir of brucellosis in wildlife in northwest Wyoming that occasionally will spill over into cattle. Our producers do a good job of mitigating their risks and trying to prevent brucellosis in their cattle herds. This situation illustrates the value and effectiveness of our surveillance program in Wyoming. We believe we found this case before the disease spread to other areas, and we are dealing with it appropriately. At this time, we do not have verification that this case has resulted from wildlife exposure, but that is very likely. The epidemiological investigation will give us an answer with time. All of Wyoming's cases of brucellosis, from 2003 to 2011, have been verified as elk source exposure.'\n\nLogan would like to thank all the producers and veterinarians in the area for their good cooperation in a very difficult situation. 'We expect to complete the initial stages of this response by the end of December [2015] with follow-up testing to occur in the ensuing months.'\n\nThe WLSB also has one Park County herd under quarantine for a brucellosis case verified in mid-November [2015]. That herd has since undergone one negative herd test. The only contact herd in this case has been released from quarantine, having tested clean on a whole-herd test.\n\nFor further information, please contact Logan at 307-857-4140 or 307-421-1682.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[This is Wyoming's 2nd case in a very short time.\n\nFor more information on brucellosis, readers are encouraged to read the moderator's comments on ProMED-mail posting 20151122.3811521. - Mod.TG\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/865.]", "summary": "The quarantine will remain in effect until the herd has undergone 3 consecutive, negative, whole-herd tests after any reactors have been removed from the herd.

All people affected by this anthropo-zoonosis, also known as Malta fever, were supported by health facilities, and their health is out of danger, according to the head of the DSP, Dr Tahar Semache.\n\nThe disease is considered a 'rare' disease in several Mediterranean countries, thus this upsurge in cases of human brucellosis observed in the province of Ghardaia since the beginning of the year represents a matter for concern, said the head of prevention. He added that cases are contracted through contact with livestock, consumption of raw milk or dairy products including 'Kamaria', a traditional cheese popular in Ghardaia.\n\nAccording to the DSP statistics, the number of registered cases, amounting to 819 up until [April 2016], exceeded the cumulative number recorded during the last 3 years (427 cases in 2015, 277 in 2014 and 116 in 2013).\n\nVeterinary services, for their part, confirmed 80 cases of bovine brucellosis circumscribed in 13 clusters in the provinces of Ghardaia, Zelfana, Guerrara, Beriane, and Metlili & El-Menea since the beginning of the year [2016], and indicated that brucellosis detection is going on in bovines, sheep, goats and camels, and those animals found reactive [probably to a serological test not specified] are culled.\n\nAccording to epidemiological investigations launched by Ghardaia veterinary services, this upsurge of human brucellosis is attributed to non-compliance with regulations and lack of hygiene, as well as the refusal of some farmers to vaccinate their livestock, arguing (without proof) that vaccination causes abortion in pregnant females. Also, the frequent use by some breeders of a potentially infected male parent for reproduction is incriminated.\n\nThe sale of unpasteurized cow, goat and camel milk in plastic bottles intended for mineral water, the lack of control in the marketing of raw milk of dubious origin, and 'kamaria' cheese sold on public roads all contribute to the resurgence of the disease. Many consumers in Ghardaia province believe firmly in the virtues of natural raw milk, which is considered to be a 'naturally sanitized product' that they can drink without boiling. Health care practitioners believe that raw milk and derivative products manufactured and sold without labeling are of doubtful safety, calling on consumers to avoid such products. 'It is imperative to boil milk,' said Dr K Mustapha, explaining that milk from sick animals transmits germs to humans (such as tuberculosis, brucellosis).\n\nThe 'alarming' increase of human brucellosis throws light on the absence of strict control of animals and the failure of prophylaxis, including vaccination in livestock, and this causes significant economic losses through direct effects on animals (abortions, infertility, decreased production), say many local veterinarians.\n\nBrucellosis constitutes 'a heavy financial burden for hospitals and the economy,' said acting DSP Bashir Bahaz, warning that the disease may spread wider and further with deficiencies in disease control measures in livestock, hygiene measures, and a lack of regulations on the transportation of livestock and vaccination.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-MENA\n<promed-mena@promedmail.org>\n\n[Ghardaia province is experiencing a real brucellosis epidemic with such a high cumulative number of cases over only 4 months.

The species _Brucella suis_ consists of 5 biovars, but the infection in pigs is caused by _B. suis_ biovars 1, 2, or 3. The disease caused by biovars 1 and 3 is similar, while that caused by biovar 2 differs from 1 and 3 in its host range, its limited geographical distribution, and its pathology.\n\nBiovar 2 is rarely pathogenic for humans, whereas biovars 1 and 3 are highly pathogenic causing severe disease.\n\nPorcine brucellosis is of widespread occurrence; generally, however, the prevalence is low, with the exception of South America and South East Asia where the prevalence is higher. In some areas, _B. suis_ infection has become established in wild or feral pigs -- diagnostic methods recommended for wild and feral pigs are the same as for domestic pigs. Various biovars of _B. suis_ cause infections in animals other than pigs, such as reindeer, caribou, hares and various murine species, and occasionally in cattle and dogs.\n\nSigns of disease in sows include infertility and abortion at any stage of gestation, and birth of dead or weak piglets. In boars, the most prominent sign is orchitis, and the secondary sex organs may be affected. _Brucella suis_ may be present in the semen, sometimes in the absence of clinical signs. Transmission during copulation is more common than is the case with brucellosis in ruminants. In both sexes, bones and especially joints and tendon sheaths may be affected, causing lameness and sometimes paralysis.\n\nIn humans, the infection is usually confined to those who are occupationally exposed to pigs, and to laboratory workers. The capability of _B. suis_ to colonise the bovine udder with subsequent shedding in milk, has the potential to be a serious human health risk.' - Mod.CRD\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/27364.]", "summary": "A ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n \nInformation received on [and dated] 3 Nov 2015 from Dr Carlos A Correa Messuti, [Uruguay OIE delegate, International Affairs Unit, Directorate General of Livestock Services (DGSG), Ministry of Livestock, Agriculture and Fisheries (MGAP)], Montevideo, Uruguay\n\nSummary\nReport type: immediate notification\n [The location of this outbreak can be seen on the interactive map included in this OIE report at the source URL above.]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n< Summary of outbreaks:\nTotal outbreaks: 1\nOutbreak 1: Canelones, El Colorado, 4a seccion de Canelones, Canelones\n Date of confirmation of the event: 9 Oct 2015\nReason for notification: reoccurrence of a listed disease\n Total animals affected:\nSpecies / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered\n BRUCELLOSIS - URUGUAY: (CANELONES) SWINE, OIE\n*********************************************\n This event pertains to a defined zone within the country\n\nNew outbreaks (1)\n Measures to be applied: stamping out\n\nDiagnostic test results\nLaboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Porcine brucellosis, at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.08.05_PORCINE_BRUC.pdf from which the following commentary is quoted:\n\n'Brucellosis in pigs is caused by _Brucella suis_, a bacterial infection that, after an initial bacteraemia, causes chronic inflammatory lesions in the reproductive organs of both sexes, with occasional localisation and lesions in other tissues.

Results were received on 19 Nov 2015 from the Wyoming State Veterinary Laboratory in Laramie, Wyoming.\n\nDr. Logan, with the concurrence of USDA-APHIS, has designated the herd from which the reactor cow originated as 'brucellosis affected' as of today [22 Nov 2015].\n\nOne cow that originated from a herd within Wyoming's Designated Surveillance Area (DSA) was positive to blood tests at the WSVL and the National Veterinary Services Laboratory in Ames, Iowa. Specified cattle from the DSA are required to be tested within 30 days prior to change of ownership or movement from counties within the DSA. The herd was quarantined on 10 No 2015. It will remain under quarantine until the herd has undergone 3 consecutive, negative, whole-herd tests after any reactors have been removed from the herd.\n\nWhole-herd testing was conducted on the 'affected' herd on 15 Nov 2015, and no additional reactor animals were identified. There is one contact herd also under quarantine for herd testing. The contact herd could be released from quarantine if their herd test is negative.\n\nThe testing is being conducted as a cooperative effort between herd owners, Wyoming Livestock Board personnel, and private veterinary practitioners. Epidemiologic interviews with herd owners are ongoing, and quarantine herd plans will be developed with each herd owner associated with the case. Epidemiologic tracing will be conducted in the upcoming weeks by WLSB and APHIS personnel.\n\n'Finding brucellosis in our DSA is not an unexpected event,' said Logan. 'We have a reservoir of brucellosis in wildlife in northwest Wyoming that occasionally will spill over into cattle. Our producers do a good job of mitigating their risks and trying to prevent brucellosis in their cattle herds. This situation illustrates the value and effectiveness of our surveillance program in Wyoming. We have found this case before the disease spread to other areas and are dealing with it appropriately. At this time, we do not have verification that this case has resulted from wildlife exposure. The epidemiological investigation will give us an answer with time. All of Wyoming's cases of brucellosis, from 2003 to 2011, have been verified as elk source exposure.'\n\nLogan said he expects to complete the initial stages of this response by the end of November [2015] with follow-up testing to occur in the ensuing months.\n\nWLSB veterinary staff is also investigating a potential case of brucellosis in Sublette County, which is also in the DSA. Blood test results indicate there may be a positive herd. If this is an 'affected herd,' there will likely be additional contact/exposed herds that will need to be quarantined until tested.\n\nFor further information, please contact Wyoming State Veterinarian Dr. Jim Logan at 307-857-4140 or 307-421-1682.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Wyoming has it challenges with wildlife, as it is part of the Greater Yellowstone area. Wyoming does a great job of managing this situation and staying on top of surveillance.\n\nThe only known focus of _Brucella abortus_ infection left in the nation is in bison and elk, which originally acquired the infection from cattle. The bacterium became established in these wildlife species and does not currently pose a threat for their populations. However, it does represent a big concern for domestic livestock.\n\nElk, also known as wapiti (_Cervus canadensis_), are a reservoir of the disease, originally acquired from cattle. The elk are free to move in and out of the national park of Yellowstone. The elk feed at feeding grounds in the park. It is a tremendous tourist draw to see the large number of impressive animals. Some of these animals give birth to a calf at or near the feeding grounds. _Brucella abortus_, the organism responsible for the disease brucellosis, is often spread through the birthing process, fluids, and tissues. Other animals investigate the birthing site and probably become infected with the organism at that time. These same elk are free to move in and out of the park region, and thus may be spreading the disease to cattle they come into contact with in the area, thus, the article's statement of the likely source of the disease in the cow in question being elk.\n\nIn areas where a cow is found positive, the producers test their animals prior to moving them to market. This can be time consuming and is certainly an added cost to the producer.\n\nThe Greater Yellowstone Area (GYA) is a portion of 3 states: Idaho, Montana and Wyoming.

The serum was found to be brucellosis positive by the applied complement and agglutination tests. On 26 Oct 2015, _Brucella melitensis_ was isolated from the placenta of the said heifer and identified as field strain biotype 1.\n\nIn view of these findings, the herd was put under quarantine. During the following 2 days, milk samples were collected for the milk ring test (MRT): this included a pooled bulk milk sample from the milk tank and individual samples from all lactating cows (in 52 batches). The bulk milk sample and 24 out of the 52 batches were found positive by the MRT. The marketing of milk from the plant was banned.\n\nDuring the same and the following day, blood samples were collected from all lactating cows as well as from pregnant heifers and non-lactating ('dry') cows. A total of 135 of them were found positive by the complement fixation test [CFT] and subsequently separated, put to sleep, transported to the country's central animal/animal products destruction plant in Ein Hamifratz, and incinerated.\n\nThe plant is being maintained under quarantine and will be retested (blood and milk) to enable eventually recovering its freedom from brucellosis status. The milk produced by the CFT-negative animals is allowed transportation to a prescribed, selected dairy factory where it undergoes an enhanced pasteurization process in line with the Ministry of Health requirements and under its supervision.\n\nThe veterinary services call upon all cattle holders/breeders who have purchased, during the recent 6 months, animals from Kibbutz Revivim to contact their respective district veterinary offices in order to obtain the required guidance and instructions.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The above communication does not provide the total numbers of cows (lactating and dry) and of heifers and other bovines in the affected plant. According to a previous posting ( 20151031.3757610), the number of cows in lactation is 1300. It may be assumed that the total number of animals on the infected premises includes several hundreds more. This plant, in Kibbutz Revivim (map at http://tinyurl.com/pgxlcye), is one of the largest and most advanced dairy operations in Israel. During the years 1999-2007, Israel's dairy cattle industry underwent a successful reform, during which the total number of dairy farms was reduced from 1453 to 1010, more than a 30 percent reduction, accompanied by upgraded sanitary and operational conditions. The Revivim plant tripled its size and united with 2 other farms, which moved their cows to a common, newly built facility in Revivim. This process was accomplished in 2006. For additional information on the reform, see http://www.milk.org.il/info/env/docs/english.pdf.\n\nA previous statement, which said that the attending veterinary practitioner in Revivimon was infected, has since been denied. At present, no human cases related to the event are known to have occurred; it would be interesting to note whether the vet and the personnel of this farm have been serologically tested. Hopefully, no raw milk from the plant has been marketed or consumed. Although this is prohibited in Israel, exceptions may have (and have) occurred elsewhere and in the past; clinical cases of Malta fever among the personnel of infected dairy operations were recorded in several similar events. On at least one occasion, the entire bovine population of the (large) farm had to be culled.\n\nVaccination of female calves between the ages of 2-6 months with strain19 brucellosis live attenuated vaccine has been compulsorily applied in Israel for decades; this vaccination was officially discontinued on 1 Jan 2014. It would be interesting to check, during the current event, whether there is a difference between vaccinated and non-vaccinated animals concerning their infection and their respective shedding of the pathogen in milk.\n\nIn a previous posting, the significance/value of the milk ring test (MRT) when performed in a single (and thus diluted) sample from the (bulk) milk tank of large dairy operations was questioned (see 20151102.3760110). In the current case, the 1300 lactating cows were reportedly sampled individually, with the samples divided into 52 batches, allowing MRT testing to be performed effectively. Notably, the single bulk sample was, reportedly, found positive as well. This deserves explanation.\n\nAs we noted, the application of periodic MRT in Israel's dairy farms was discontinued altogether on 1 Mar 2015.

Mod.AS, summ., edited; subscription required]\nhttp://www.hachaklait.org.il/\n\n\nAn industrial, cooperative dairy farm in a southern Kibbutz, HaDarom (South) district, has been found to be infected with _Brucella melitensis_. Of the 1350 lactating cows, 12 per cent (135 animals) have been found positive by the CF [complement fixation] test; all positive cows have been separated and subsequently culled. The causative bacterium has been isolated and identified from the blood and placenta of an aborting heifer. There have been 2 additional abortions (registered but not sampled) on the farm.\n\nThe index case in this event was the attending veterinary practitioner.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The briefly described event reflects the deteriorated brucellosis situation in Israel, as described in detail in posting 20150801.3550984. The fact that the pathogen spread extensively in the dairy operation, discovered only after the diagnosis of a human case, is rather concerning. Periodic milk tank sampling and testing is meant to discover brucellosis infection in herds earlier. The history of the testing regime in this herd deserves to be reviewed. It will be also interesting to note if vaccinated animals are included among the positive ones.\n\nIt may be assumed that the infection in this event originated in neighboring sheep/goat flocks. The route of _B. melitensis_ introduction from infected flocks into the (zero-grazing) Kibbutz dairy farm is yet to be established.\n\nBrucellosis in livestock in Israel is caused, since decades, exclusively by _B. melitensis_. The pathogen of bovine brucellosis, _B. abortus_, which causes massive abortions in this species, has been long eradicated.\n\nHumans are mostly infected by the consumption of unpasteurized dairy products originating from extensively held, infected dairy sheep and goat flocks. However, about 20 per cent of the human cases are known to be infected directly from animals. Occasionally, cattle are infected as well, becoming an efficient source of human infection. In difference with sheep and goats, _B. melitensis_ rarely causes abortion in cattle, their infection expected to be discovered by the application of periodic milk tank sampling and testing.\n\nThe deterioration in the brucellosis situation in Israel is reflected by the following statistics published by Israel's Ministry of Health addressing human cases: 2005 - 141, 2006 - 138, 2007 - 152, 2008 - 149, 2009 - 136, 2010 - 139, 2012 - 183, 2013 - 336, 2014 - 596.\n\nAccording to the ministry's most recent available Weekly Epidemiological Report, dated 3 Oct 2015, the accumulated number of officially reported new human brucellosis cases since the beginning of 2015 is 349, compared with 539 during the same period in 2014. While 2014 seems to have been a record year (a total of 596 human cases in 52 weeks), 2015's figures are still higher than all years previous to 2014.\n\nThe described situation may not be attributed to a change in the hygiene measures in patients' kitchens (deplorable as they may be) but to increased exposure to the pathogen, namely spread within the animal vectors. Financial losses caused by the disease to animal owners (abortions in sheep and goats) are much lower than the devastating damage to human health. This is an obstacle in obtaining the owners' cooperation, unless control measures, including vaccination and animal identification, are free of charge and full, immediate compensations are paid when animals are culled.\n\nThe affected dairy cattle farm has to undergo repeated tests, applying the 'test and slaughter' policy until declared free. In case of excessive infection rate, it may become necessary to cull the entire herd. In the past, such a measure was applied at least once. - Mod.AS\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/10308.]", "summary": "A ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n \n\nHumans are mostly infected by the consumption of unpasteurized dairy products originating from extensively held, infected dairy sheep and goat flocks. \n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n< The deterioration in the brucellosis situation in Israel is reflected by the following statistics published by Israel's Ministry of Health addressing human cases: 2005 - 141, 2006 - 138, 2007 - 152, 2008 - 149, 2009 - 136, 2010 - 139, 2012 - 183, 2013 - 336, 2014 - 596.

However, certain points mentioned in the report do need to be clarified to better understand this event.\n\nSome clarity is needed regarding the species of _Brucella_ which caused the disease. The heading of the report states that the agent is _Brucella abortus_, but the causative agent description is limited to just _Brucella_ spp. The report also indicates that advanced diagnostic methods were utilized. However, for this event, only the rose bengal test was used, which is a screening test, and any positive results would need to be verified with confirmatory tests. Furthermore, one of the outbreaks is reported as occurring in caprines, a species not normally affected by _B. abortus_. Therefore, it would be useful to have additional information on the types of confirmatory tests that were conducted, and on the outcome of the epidemiological investigation.\n\nAs the OIE Terrestrial Manual of Diagnostic Tests and Vaccines indicates: 'Presumptive evidence of _Brucella_ is provided by the demonstration, by modified acid-fast staining of organisms, of _Brucella_ morphology in abortion material or vaginal discharge, especially if supported by serological tests. The polymerase chain reaction methods provide additional means of detection. Whenever possible, _Brucella_ spp. should be isolated using plain or selective media by culture from uterine discharges, aborted fetuses, udder secretions or selected tissues, such as lymph nodes and male and female reproductive organs. Species and biovars should be identified by phage lysis, and by cultural, biochemical and serological criteria. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) can provide both a complementary and biotyping method based on specific genomic sequences.\n\n'The buffered _Brucella_ antigen tests, i.e. rose bengal test and buffered plate agglutination test, the complement fixation test, the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or the fluorescence polarisation assay, are suitable tests for screening herds and individual animals. However, no single serological test is appropriate in each and all epidemiological situations. Therefore, the reactivity of samples that are positive in screening tests should be assessed using an established confirmatory and/or complementary strategy. The indirect ELISA or milk ring test performed on bulk milk samples are effective for screening and monitoring dairy cattle for brucellosis, but the milk ring test is less reliable in large herds.'\nSee: http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.04.03_BOVINE_BRUCELL.pdf.\n\nIt is worth noting that in 2007 Botswana reported 4 outbreaks of brucellosis in cattle that were caused by _Brucella melitensis_ (see Botswana annual report 2007 at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/semestrial/review?year=2007&semester=0&wild=0&country=BWA&this_country_code=BWA&detailed=1; Note: see Sections 1 and 3 of the report).\n\nBased on the OIE Manual:\n\n- 'Bovine brucellosis is usually caused by _Brucella abortus_, less frequently by _B. melitensis_, and occasionally by _B. suis_. Infection is widespread globally. Several countries in Northern and Central Europe, Canada, Japan, Australia and New Zealand are believed to be free from the agent.' http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.04.03_BOVINE_BRUCELL.pdf\n\n- 'Brucellosis in sheep and goats (excluding _Brucella ovis_ infection) is primarily caused by one of the 3 biovars of _B. melitensis_. Sporadic infections caused by _B. abortus_ or _B. suis_ have been observed in sheep and goats, but such cases are rare.' http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.07.02_CAPRINE_OVINE_BRUC.pdf\n\nAnother point of confusion lies in the fact that Botswana reports as manifestation of the disease 'sub-clinical infection'; however, in the epidemiological section, they report the animals as having aborted, which is one of the signs of the disease, and which prompts investigators to always consider _Brucella_ spp. as the causative organism. As the OIE Manual also states: 'Clinically, the disease is characterised by one or more of the following signs: abortion, retained placenta, orchitis, epididymitis and, rarely, arthritis, with excretion of the organisms in uterine discharges and in milk.' http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.04.03_BOVINE_BRUCELL.pdf\n\nFinally, it would be important to learn if modified stamping out was or will be used as a control measure given that this disease is highly pathogenic for humans.\n\n'_Brucella abortus_, _B. melitensis_ and _B. suis_ are highly pathogenic for humans, and all infected tissues, cultures and potentially contaminated materials must be handled under appropriate containment conditions.' http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.04.03_BOVINE_BRUCELL.pdf. - Mods.CRD/AS]", "summary": "Measures applied: Movement control inside the country; traceability; official disposal of carcasses, by-products and waste; no vaccination; no treatment of affected animals\nMeasures to be applied: No other measures\n\nDiagnostic test results\nLaboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result\n A ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n Affected population: Goats grazing in communal area\n\nSummary of outbreaks: Total outbreaks: 2\nTotal animals affected:\nSpecies / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered\n Goats / 23 / 2 / 0 / 0 / 0\n\nOutbreak statistics [rates apparent, expressed as percentages]:\nSpecies / Morbidity rate / Mortality rate / Case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*\n Epidemiological unit: Village\nAffected animals:\nSpecies / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered\n Epidemiological unit: Village\nAffected animals:\nSpecies / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered\n Source: OIE, WAHID weekly disease information 2015; 28(38) [edited]\nhttp://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=18602\n\n\nBrucellosis (_Brucella abortus_), Botswana\n Immediate notification\nDate of start of the event: 10 Aug 2015\n Causal agent: _Brucella_ spp\nNature of diagnosis: Laboratory (advanced)\n Goats / 23 / 2 / 0 / 0 / 0\n Cattle / 600 / 6 / 0 / 0 / 0\n Cattle / 600/ 6 / 0 / 0 / 0\n Cattle / 1 / 0 / 0 / 0\n Goats / 8.70 / 0 / 0 / 0\n Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n< \n\n'The buffered _Brucella_ antigen tests, i.e. rose bengal test and buffered plate agglutination test, the complement fixation test, the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or the fluorescence polarisation assay, are suitable tests for screening herds and individual animals.

This infection causes significant losses from decreased productivity and lost trade in much of the developing world. _B. melitensis_ is considered to be a re-emerging pathogen in the Middle East. It has been eradicated from some nations, but the cost of surveillance to remain _B. melitensis_-free is significant.\n\n_B. melitensis_ is highly pathogenic for humans; this organism is considered to be the most severe human pathogen in the genus. Occupational exposure is seen in laboratory workers, farmers, veterinarians and others who contact infected animals or tissues. Brucellosis is one of the most easily acquired laboratory infections. People who do not work with animals or tissues usually become infected by ingesting unpasteurized dairy products. The Rev-1 _B. melitensis_ vaccine is also pathogenic for humans and must be handled with caution to avoid accidental injection or contamination of mucous membranes or abraded skin.\n\nAsymptomatic infections can occur in humans. In symptomatic cases, the disease is extremely variable, and the clinical signs may appear insidiously or abruptly. Typically, brucellosis begins as an acute febrile illness with nonspecific flu-like signs such as fever, headache, malaise, back pain, myalgia and generalized aches. Drenching sweats can occur, particularly at night. Some patients recover spontaneously, while others develop persistent symptoms that typically wax and wane. Occasionally seen complications include arthritis, spondylitis, chronic fatigue, and epididymo-orchitis. Neurologic signs (including personality changes, meningitis, uveitis and optic neuritis), anemia, internal abscesses, nephritis, endocarditis and dermatitis can also occur. Other organs and tissues can also be affected, resulting in a wide variety of syndromes.\n\nTreatment is with antibiotics; however, relapses can be seen months after the initial symptoms appear, even in successfully treated cases. The mortality rate is low; in untreated persons, estimates of the case fatality rate vary from less than 2 percent to 5 percent. Death is usually caused by endocarditis or meningitis.'\n\nTo date, 13 individuals have been diagnosed with brucellosis in the municipality of Rila. Given the occurrence of _B. melitensis_ in Bulgaria, many of these cases could be directly associated with infected herds detected in this municipality. It is not known whether human cases have been detected in the district of Pleven.

According to Rospotrebnadzor [Federal Service for Consumer Protection and Human Welfare], the brucellosis epidemic is increasing rapidly. During the 1st 7 months of 2015, 73 cases of brucellosis were registered in Stavropol. There were 29 cases reported during the same period in 2014.\n\nThe highest prevalence has been recorded in the following districts: Neftekumsky area (9 cases), Levokumsky (8), Shpakovsky (6), Kursky (5), and Alexandrovsky, Budyonnovsky, Izobilnensky, and Novoselitsky areas (4 cases each).\n\nThe main source of the disease are infected large and small ruminants. The increased incidence is caused by uncontrolled, illegal trade of meat and dairy products, non-compliance with sanitary-epidemiological norms, poor quality inspection of cattle, sheep, and goats by veterinarians, as well as the sale of meat and dairy products without prior testing and quality assurance.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-RUS\n<promed-rus@promedmail.org>\n\n[It would be useful to obtain further information on the agent involved: _Brucella abortus_ or _B. melitensis_? The latter, which is the historical etiological cause of Malta fever in humans (and is, most probably, the one widely spread in Stavropol), is a specific pathogen of small ruminants (goats and sheep), but may readily infect in-contact cattle. In contrast to _B. abortus_, which is the specific pathogen of bovine brucellosis and a cause of abortion in this species, _B. melitensis_ is less likely to clinically affect cattle (including abortion), but will be disseminated in cattle milk and dairy products, infecting other animals and humans. Meat (muscle tissue) is significantly less likely to be infectious.\n\nSmall ruminants (goats and sheep) readily abort following infection with _B. melitensis_ and remain carriers (in fact, vectors) throughout life, though they may give birth to viable offspring in subsequent gestations. The pathogenicity of _B. melitensis_ for humans is generally regarded to be of a higher rate than the pathogenicity of _B. abortus.\n\nOn top of the need for sanitary measures and strict compliance with legal requirements, vaccination of the susceptible animal reservoir, provided it is meticulously applied, combined with pasteurization of milk and dairy products, will significantly reduce the human health hazard.\n\nAccording to a 2013 paper (ref 1), brucellosis is still reported from all types of farms and domestic livestock in Russia. Between 1999 and 2009, the number of infected sites slightly increased, ranging from 54 in 2001 to 112 in 2009. The number of sites affected with _B. melitensis_ reportedly increased but remained low: 13 in 2004 and 21 in 2009 (see Fig 2 'Ovine brucellosis in the Russian Federation, 2003 to 2009' in ref 1).\n\nReference\n---------\n1.

MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep 2008; 57(22): 603-5; http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5722a3.htm:\n\nAbstract\n--------\nHuman brucellosis, a nationally notifiable disease, is uncommon in the United States. Most human cases have occurred in returned travelers or immigrants from regions where brucellosis is endemic, or were acquired domestically from eating illegally imported, unpasteurized fresh cheeses. In January 2005, a woman aged 35 years who lived in Nassau County, Florida, received a diagnosis of brucellosis, based on results of a _Brucella_ immunoglobulin M (IgM) enzyme immunoassay (EIA) performed in a commercial laboratory using analyte specific reagents (ASRs); this diagnosis prompted an investigation of dairy products in 2 other states. Subsequent confirmatory antibody testing by _Brucella_ microagglutination test (BMAT) performed at CDC on the patient's serum was negative. The case did not meet the CDC/Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists' (CSTE) definition for a probable or confirmed brucellosis case, and the initial EIA result was determined to be a false positive. This report summarizes the case history, laboratory findings, and public health investigations. CDC recommends that _Brucella_ serology testing only be performed using tests cleared or approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or validated under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) and shown to reliably detect the presence of _Brucella_ infection. Results from these tests should be considered supportive evidence for recent infection only and interpreted in the context of a clinically compatible illness and exposure history. EIA is not considered a confirmatory _Brucella_ antibody test; positive screening test results should be confirmed by _Brucella_-specific agglutination (that is, BMAT or standard tube agglutination test) methods.\n\nIn parallel, misidentification of the organism can occur in rapid bacterial identification systems as documented in Barham WB, Church P, Brown JE, Paparello S: Misidentification of _Brucella_ species with use of rapid bacterial identification systems. Clin Infect Dis. 1993; 17(6): 1068-9, and elsewhere.\n\nFurthermore, in addition to the classical species of _Brucella_, _melitensis_, _suis_, and _abortus_, _B. canis_ can be transmitted to humans as reported in Lucero NE, Escobar GI, Ayala SM, Jacob N: Diagnosis of human brucellosis caused by Brucella canis. J Med Microbiol. 2005; 54 (Pt 5): 457-61; http://jmm.sgmjournals.org/content/journal/jmm/10.1099/jmm.0.45927-0#tab2.\n\nAbstract\n--------\nThe transmission of _Brucella canis_ to man commonly occurs through contact with infected dogs or their secretions, or through direct laboratory exposure. The disease is underdiagnosed due to a general lack of serological testing facilities and misconceptions concerning its prevalence. This report shows the potential use of an indirect ELISA (IELISA) for the diagnosis of human brucellosis caused by _B. canis_ in a population of patients negative by smooth-_Brucella_ antigen tests but positive by rapid slide agglutination test (RSAT). 110 sera from asymptomatic people found negative by tests using smooth _B. abortus_ antigen and by RSAT showed an IELISA specificity of 100 percent when a cut-off value of 27 percent positivity was selected. For 17 sera from patients with positive _B. canis_ culture or in close contact with culture-positive dogs, the IELISA sensitivity was 100 percent with the same cut-off value. The positive patients presented clinical symptoms similar to brucellosis caused by other species of _Brucella_ and some of them received antibiotic treatment and made good progress. Using this cut-off value, we studied 35 patients with negative blood cultures but positive RSATs, and IELISA detected 18 as positive; of the 17 IELISA-negative, 2 were RSAT-positive at dilution 1:2 and 15 were weakly positive with pure serum. These samples were probably from patients at an early stage of infection or indicate false-positive results. No cross-reaction was observed among the sera from 9 cases with a diagnosis other than brucellosis, but cross-reactivity was evident in sera from patients infected with smooth-_Brucella_ species. Since routine brucellosis diagnosis does not include _B. canis_ investigation, infection with this species may be more widespread than is currently suspected. The RSAT could be a suitable screening test for the diagnosis of _B. canis_ human brucellosis, and a supplementary technique, such as IELISA, performed on all positive RSAT samples that were negative by _B. abortus_ antigen could ensure diagnostic specificity and confirm the diagnosis. - Mod.LL]\n\n[Brucellosis deserves to be excluded in the contact dog by bacteriological examination and serological tests. - Mod.AS\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/363.]", "summary": "Using this cut-off value, we studied 35 patients with negative blood cultures but positive RSATs, and IELISA detected 18 as positive; of the 17 IELISA-negative, 2 were RSAT-positive at dilution 1:2 and 15 were weakly positive with pure serum.

He added that the results obtained on samples taken from his cows and sent to the diagnostic laboratory located in the municipality of Draa Benkhadda, Tizi Ouzou province, took more than 20 days to be released and finally showed that 1 of his cows was infected and had to be culled immediately. He expressed his astonishment regarding this delay as such results used to reach owners within only 3 or 4 days in the past. He minimized the importance of the loss of his cow, and stressed the impact of such disease on public health and the wellbeing of citizens.\n\nIt should be noted that 7 brucellosis cases were registered a few days ago following the consumption of contaminated milk.

The province of Bouira is located in the Kabylie region, south east of Algiers. It is divided in 12 districts totaling 45 municipalities (https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilaya_de_Bouira; in French).\n\nLivestock rearing is widespread in the rural areas of the province, and consumption of raw milk and cheese made from it is not uncommon.\n\nIn this province and in other Algerian provinces, abortion storms do occur in both cattle and small ruminants; they often lead to a significant number of human brucellosis cases, requiring prompt and efficient therapy.\n\nIt seems that the efficiency of veterinary services has decreased recently, hence the appearance of the reported high number of brucellosis cases in humans. - Mod.AB\n\nIt is striking to note that no postings on brucellosis in Algeria have been published by ProMED-mail since 2004, in spite of the serious zoonotic implications of the disease, endemic in Algeria and in the Maghreb, the Eastern Mediterranean, throughout the Middle East, Asia, Africa, and beyond. No reports on brucellosis have been received from the other Maghreb countries, Morocco and Tunisia, since the inauguration of ProMED-mail in 1995. This worldwide underreporting was addressed recently by OIE's director general, who stated, in his preface to Ref 1: 'The study of zoonotic brucellosis served as a basis for some of the great early advances in epidemiology, yet the disease remains the most common chronic bacterial infection in the world. It continues to cause important medical, veterinary, socioeconomic, and conservation problems, mainly because its overall burden remains underestimated and often neglected.'\n\nA recent example illuminating the accuracy and actuality of the said statement has been provided by the recent Bulgarian _Brucella melitensis_ outbreak. According to a media report dated 7 Aug 2015, multiple holdings have already become known as infected in the municipality of Rila. Bulgaria's main concern, in relation to the recently discovered human brucellosis cases, is the undetected spread of the agent in animals, with humans becoming the unfortunate sentinels instead of the vector animals. This is underlined by the large number (18) of separate holdings already detected as infected. Human cases started to appear in Bulgaria since 2012. Bulgaria, where the last case of _B. melitensis_ in small ruminants was reported in 2009, has become an infected country and is expected to report the recent outbreak in goats to the OIE, as prescribed by the International Animal Health Code. Hopefully, the report will include available information on the origin of the outbreaks in Rila (see http://www.focus-fen.net/news/2015/08/07/379969/19-people-owners-of-brucellosis-infected-goats-in-bulgarias-rila.html).\n\nReference\n---------\nPlumb G, Olsen S & Pappas G (editors).

The infection is also known as undulant fever, related to the occurrence of 1-3 week febrile periods separated by 1-3 days of afebrility. This occurs more likely with _Brucella melitensis_ (acquired from goats) as compared to _B. abortus_ (cattle) and _B. suis_ (swine).\n\nThe infection can be subclinical. Acute symptomatic brucellosis is generally manifest with nonspecific symptoms such as fever, chills, night sweats, anorexia, and an increased sense of ill health. The disease can be diagnosed serologically and/or by blood culture. The organism may grow quite slowly on primary isolation, and the clinician should make the microbiology laboratory aware of this potential diagnosis.\n\nLocalized infection may occur. Sites for localization include the skeletal system (1), heart valves (2) and urinary tract (3). Genitourinary [GU] brucellosis may present identically to GU tuberculosis. Psychiatric manifestations such as depression and anxiety are possible as late symptoms of brucellosis (4,5), so-called chronic neurobrucellosis. It remains unclear whether active brucella infection is present at that time. Overt CNS infection can, however, include meningitis and encephalitis (6,7).\n\nReferences\n----------\n1.

A retrospective study was conducted to assess the impact of the 1997 decision to discontinue a veterinarian control campaign on the epidemiology of human brucellosis in the region.\n\nDiscussion\n----------\nBrucellosis appears to have been endemic to Middle East countries since ancient times affecting domesticated animals and humans as well. In modern times, rigorous control measures instituted by the Israel Ministry of Agriculture have eliminated brucellosis caused by _B. abortus_ among bovines, making the industrialized milk product supply safe. _Brucella melitensis_, however, continued to be endemic among sheep and goats, especially in nomadic Bedouin herds, and the veterinary control of the disease in this setting encountered serious logistic difficulties such as geographical dispersion of small herds, lack of shepherds' incentive to participate in the program, budgetary constraints, and illegal trade in infected animals. Although cessation of the eradication campaign in 1997 could have been justified by the steady decline in the endemic level of brucellosis observed countrywide, the present data clearly show that the disease was far from being brought to control in southern Israel. The results of the study demonstrate that, after a decline in the incidence of brucellosis in the early 2000's, starting in 2007, rates increased again and significantly exceeded the 1997 endemic level in 2012.\n\nThe relationship between the timing of the cessation of the veterinary control campaign and the epidemiological changes in the incidence of human disease in the Negev region is, therefore, not obvious. It is speculated that control measures did, in fact, decrease the prevalence of the zoonosis among domesticated animals because most infected sheep and goats were slaughtered and replaced by immunized animals, reducing the source of human contagion. Although the campaign was discontinued in 1997, its effect was still felt at the beginning of the following decade resulting in low attack rate of human infections. It is speculated that because the disease was not completely eradicated, brucellosis slowly built-up among animal herds, taking a few years before it spilled-over to the human population of the region. Close examination of the data demonstrate that the disease remained almost limited to Negev Bedouins who, although undergoing a rapid process of modernization and settlement in permanent towns, still keep goat and sheep herds and consume unpasteurized dairy products. The average incidence of brucellosis in the Bedouin community for the 11-year period (77.9 per 100 000 population) is appalling and ranks 2nd only to that reported among the population of neighboring Syria. These results indicate that countrywide data may overlook the incidence of a locally-endemic infection by diluting cases of disease amidst a large global denominator, and imply that the true magnitude of the problem should be assessed using specific data for the relevant population at risk.\n\nThe incidence rate of human brucellosis found in the present study can be considered only a minimal estimate. The study design did not include a small proportion of patients who could have been diagnosed in a few small clinical microbiology laboratories other than the CMLSUNC [Clinical Microbiology Laboratory of the Soroka University Medical Center, city of Beer-Sheva].\n\nIn addition, the protean clinical manifestations of human brucellosis may mimic other infectious and non-infectious conditions and, therefore, the true nature of the symptoms and signs may be easily missed. In a previous study conducted in southern Israel, isolation of _B. melitensis_ was frequently an unexpected finding in febrile Bedouin patients in whom the disease was not suspected. In a study conducted in the region, active search for the disease among relatives of 4 index patients with brucellosis resulted in the detection of an additional 12 undiagnosed cases. A similar experience was reported in Saudi Arabia, where screening of 404 family members of 55 diagnosed cases revealed an additional 53 (13.1 percent) serologically positive individuals, of which 9 were also bacteremic.\n\nConclusions\n-----------\nHuman brucellosis caused by _B. melitensis_ has reemerged as a serious public health threat to the Bedouin population of southern Israel in recent years. The Israel Ministry of Agriculture should reconsider its premature decision to terminate veterinary measures aimed to control brucellosis in domesticated animals, and implement a public education campaign to reduce human exposure to this preventable zoonotic disease. - Mod.LL]\n\n[Human brucellosis in Israel is caused exclusively by _Brucella melitensis_, mostly byproducts from infected small ruminants (goats and sheep) and direct contact with them. Occasionally, cattle are infected as well and become another source of human infection. In the not-too-far past, several high-producing dairy herds were infected with subsequent infection in their personnel. _Brucella abortus_, causing bovine brucellosis, has been successfully eradicated in Israel decades back.\n\nThe deterioration in the brucellosis situation can be seen from the following statistics published by Israel's Ministry of Health. According to their most recent available Weekly Epidemiological Report, as of 18 Jul 2015 the accumulated number of officially reported new human brucellosis cases since the beginning of 2015 was 252, compared to 368 during the same period in 2014. It remains to be seen if these figures herald a halt in the sharp increase seen during the previous 3 years. The annual figures since 2005 are the following: 2005 - 141, 2006 - 138, 2007 - 152, 2008 - 149, 2009 - 136, 2010 - 139, 2012 - 183, 2013 - 336, 2014 - 603 (a record of all times). Such increase may not be attributed to a change in the hygiene measures in patients' kitchens (deplorable as they may be) but to increased exposure to the pathogen, namely spread within the animal vectors. Unfortunately, humans became the sentinels to animal infection. The financial losses caused by the disease to animal owners (abortions in sheep and goats) are much lower than the devastating damage to human health; this is an obstacle in obtaining the owners' cooperation, unless control measures, including vaccination and animal identification, are free of charge and full, immediate compensations are paid when required. The story, in the above media report, about the infected/infective camel still kept alive -- if true -- is alarming.\n\nThe disease has, in the past, been seen to spill over into all segments of the population (several veterinarians and laboratory personnel included). Even if the budget mentioned in the media report (about USD 30 million) is obtained, while the required manpower and policing support available and privatization of the State Veterinary Service put on halt, the timeframe for eradication will be (much) longer than the one mentioned in the media report. This is a long-term issue, requiring the safeguarding of budget for its entire duration, and a One Health attitude. - Mod.AS\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/90.]", "summary": "Communicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[This discussion from Shemesh AA, Yagupsky Y: Increasing Incidence of Human Brucellosis in Southern Israel after the Cessation of a Veterinarian Control Campaign?

In April and May 2015, 2 laboratory-confirmed cases of _Brucella melitensis_ were reported to the NYC Health Department. Both patients reported symptoms consistent with brucellosis, traveled to a country where the disease is endemic, and consumed unpasteurized milk while there. The diagnosis was not suspected, and the laboratories were not notified to consider brucellosis and take appropriate precautions when handling clinical specimens and isolates. No laboratory workers developed brucellosis. We urge clinicians and laboratorians to take specific steps to prevent transmission of brucellosis and other highly infectious diseases.\n\nBackground\n-----\nBrucellosis is a common zoonotic disease throughout Africa, Asia, the Middle East, Mediterranean Basin, Eastern Europe, the Caribbean, Central America and South America. In the USA, only 100-140 brucellosis cases are reported annually, including 2-3 cases from NYC.\n\nBrucellae are small, slow-growing Gram-negative coccobacilli that typically infect livestock (goats, sheep, cattle, swine). Most exposures occur in countries where brucellosis is endemic, with consumption of unpasteurized milk or milk products being the most common risk factor. Infection in NYC and elsewhere also has occurred following consumption of cheese that originated from another country (e.g., soft cheese from Mexico). Less commonly, brucellae are inhaled in farm settings or inoculated into cuts and other skin breaks after direct contact with blood or body fluids when an infected animal is slaughtered (e.g., feral pig). The primary human pathogens are _B. melitensis_, _B. abortus_ and _B. suis_.\n\nAfter an incubation period that ranges from weeks to months, predominant symptoms are fever (intermittent and/or undulating), profuse sweating (often described as malodorous), fatigue, headache, weight loss and arthralgia. Cytopenias, hepatitis, lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly and splenomegaly are common. Combination antimicrobial therapy for weeks to months is required, and infection is prone to relapse.\n\nBrucellosis is the most commonly reported laboratory-acquired bacterial infection, which is likely due to the low infectious dose of _Brucella spp._ and the ease by which brucellae can be aerosolized in laboratory settings and inhaled or ingested (e.g., mouth pipetting or sprays to the face) by unprotected personnel. CDC recommends that laboratories use procedures that minimize splashes or aerosols of unidentified isolates, that culture plate sniffing should be prohibited, and that slow-growing Gram-negative and Gram-variable organisms should be handled in a biological safety cabinet. (See http://www.cdc.gov/brucellosis/laboratories/index.html)\n\nBacterial isolation is the most reliable way to diagnose brucellosis. In addition to blood, _Brucella spp._ can be isolated from bone marrow, joint fluid, CSF, splenic/hepatic abscesses, and purulent discharge. Of note, more than 72 hours of growth is typically needed to detect Brucella in automated blood culture systems. Clinicians must notify their microbiology laboratory that brucellosis is suspected so that cultures can be incubated for at least 10 days and biosafety measures taken to prevent laboratory exposures.\n\nIncident 1\n-----\nA male patient in his 40s presented to a NYC hospital with debilitating neck pain. He had been living in Africa for 6-9 months. On presentation, he was afebrile, though he developed fever, chills and sweats after he arrived at the emergency department (ED). His CBC was normal, and transaminases were not tested. 2 days after admission, a consultant elicited a history of recurrent fever, weight loss, and anorexia while he was in Africa. He ultimately was diagnosed with extensive cervical prevertebral and retropharyngeal phlegmons.\n\nAfter 4 days of incubation, 2 sets of blood cultures were flagged as positive by the instrument. Blood culture bottles were vented and Gram stained in a biological safety cabinet, and small, Gram-negative coccobacilli were observed. Colony growth on subculture was apparent after roughly 24 hours of incubation. The following laboratory work was done on an open bench: subculturing; catalase test; a qualitative method for identifying _Neisseria_ and _Haemophilus spp._ that requires inoculation with standardized suspensions of bacteria; and spotting bacterial growth on a steel plate for analysis with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS).\n\nMALDI-TOF MS could not identify the organism, because Brucella is not included in the instrument's reference database. Approximately 1 week after the blood cultures initially demonstrated growth, the isolate was sent to an outside laboratory for additional testing, which identified a presumptive _Brucella sp._ pathogen of voles and sea mammals, and the NYC Health Department was notified. The patient was re-interviewed when this information was received, and he reported weekly consumption of unpasteurized cow, goat, and camel milk in Africa. The clinical isolate was sent to CDC and confirmed as _B. melitensis_.\n\nA laboratory risk assessment was conducted. (For information about assessing laboratory risk after exposure to _Brucella spp._, see http://www.cdc.gov/brucellosis/laboratories/risk-level.html) A total of 35 persons were classified as having had either high- or low-risk exposures in the microbiology laboratory during the week that laboratorians worked with the unidentified isolate on an open bench.\n\nIncident 2\n------\nA patient in his 20s presented to a NYC hospital with a 2-month history of recurrent fever, dry cough, night sweats, weight loss, myalgia, arthralgia, and fatigue. He had returned recently from a stay of 2-3 months in the Middle East. On evaluation, he had fever (T 102 F), anemia, and elevated transaminases. Chest x-ray was negative; chest CT showed hepatosplenomegaly.\n\nThe initial concern was that the patient might have tuberculosis, but this was ruled out. After 5 days, 2 sets of blood cultures that were collected on admission were flagged as positive for microbial growth. All microbiology laboratory work, including blood culture bottle venting, Gram staining, and vortexing, was conducted on an open laboratory bench. The blood culture Gram stains were read as tiny, Gram-positive cocci in pairs and chains. After subculture and incubation for 2 days, colony growth of tiny, Gram-negative cocci was observed. An automated microbial identification system identified a presumptive _B. melitensis_ the following day, and the NYC Health Department was contacted. A MALDI-TOF MS instrument undergoing validation at the facility also failed to identify the isolate, because Brucella is not in the instrument's reference database.\n\nThe patient was re-interviewed by clinical staff, and he reported drinking unpasteurized sheep milk during his time in the Middle East. The NYC Public Health Laboratory confirmed the isolate as _B. melitensis_.\n\nA laboratory risk assessment was conducted by the hospital's infectious disease department and infection control program. Because multiple potential aerosol-generating procedures and other manipulations of Brucella cultures were performed on an open laboratory bench, 18 people were classified as having had either high- or low-risk exposures.\n\nPrevention of laboratory exposures to _Brucella_ and other potentially hazardous organisms\n---------------\nIncidents involving unrecognized biological hazards can be prevented. These 2 incidents highlight aspects of clinical and laboratory practice requiring greater attention.\n\n1st, brucellosis was not suspected or considered as a potential diagnosis until blood culture isolates were presumptively identified by the laboratory. Both incidents involved patients with recurrent fever, travel to countries where zoonoses are common, and with histories and findings consistent with brucellosis. If the diagnosis had been considered, risk exposures for the disease could have been readily identified and the microbiology laboratories alerted that brucellosis was a suspected diagnosis. Clinicians should always obtain travel histories and query for risk exposures when patients present with fever and infectious disease symptoms and should share the information with their microbiology laboratory when it may contribute to laboratory diagnosis. If brucellosis or infection from another highly infectious agent is suspected, inform the clinical laboratory so that laboratorians can take special precautions to prevent laboratory exposures.\n\n2nd, work with clinical specimens and slow-growing, small Gram-negative organisms occurred on an open bench, including procedures that could aerosolize brucellae. Microbiology laboratories are advised to work with clinical specimens (body fluids, blood, tissues, etc.) and suspect clinical isolates in a biological safety cabinet until highly infectious agents have been ruled out. Laboratories are advised to incorporate controls that prevent work with slow-growing Gram-negative isolates from being done on open benches unless they have been identified as organisms that can be handled safely in a BSL-2 environment. Similarly, if meningococcus is suspected after Gram stain, all further manipulations of the isolate should be conducted in a biological safety cabinet.\n\nIn both incidents, blood cultures required at least 4 days of incubation before growth was detected. This was an important clue that a potentially hazardous isolate (e.g., _Francisella_ or _Brucella_) was present; that it needed to be handled safely within a biological safety cabinet rather than on an open bench; that appropriate personal protective equipment was indicated for laboratorians working with the unknown isolate; and that the patient's history, travel and risk exposures should be reviewed with the clinical team. _Brucella spp._ are commonly mistaken for small cocci and may retain crystal violet stain in blood culture smears, appearing Gram positive. If slow-growing blood culture smears suggest the presence of small, Gram-positive cocci or Gram-variable or Gram-negative organisms, laboratorians are asked to continue all subsequent work in a biological safety cabinet and to contact the NYC Health Department for referral when _Brucella spp._ and other potential biological threat agents (BTAs) cannot be ruled out.\n\nFinally, automated identification systems and mass spectrometry were used when referral to the NYC Public Health Laboratory was indicated. As above, diagnosis would have been more rapid and laboratory exposures prevented if the microbiology laboratories had contacted the NYC Health Department and referred the unknown isolates to the NYC Public Health Laboratory instead of attempting identification with automated systems or mass spectrometry. Laboratories are asked to review the American Society of Microbiology (ASM) protocols for ruling out and referring potential BTAs including _Bacillus anthracis_, _Brucella spp._ and _Francisella tularensis_. Detailed sentinel-level laboratory protocols are available on the ASM website (https://www.asm.org/index.php/guidelines/sentinel-guidelines). BTA bench cards for sentinel laboratories that summarize steps to recognize, rule out and refer potential BTAs also are available through the Association of Public Health Laboratories. (http://www.aph l.org/aphlprograms/preparedness-and-response/documents/aphl-sentinel-laboratory-biothreat-bench-cards.pdf)\n\nMicrobiology laboratories are cautioned that automated systems commonly misidentify brucellae as _Moraxella spp_., _Micrococcus spp._, _Corynebacterium spp._, 'slow growing' _Staphylococcus spp._, _Oligella ureolytica_, _Bordetella bronchiseptica_, _Haemophilus spp._, or _Pasteurella spp_.\n\nMALDI-TOF MS was used unsuccessfully in both institutions to identify the isolate. This technology is emerging as a promising rapid diagnostic tool in microbiology laboratories. However, the instruments used by both hospital laboratories did not include organisms that are considered select agents, including Brucella, in the reference database. When this technology is being utilized, it is essential for laboratories to understand the database and software limitations and to employ the above ASM protocols to recognize and refer potential BTAs to the NYC Public Health Laboratory.\n\nThese 2 recent incidents exposed a large number of laboratorians to _B. melitensis_, requiring many of them to take weeks of antibiotic post-exposure prophylaxis to prevent brucellosis and months of serologic surveillance and fever/symptom checks. We ask clinicians and laboratories implement processes and procedures that address potential gaps in clinical assessment and laboratory biosafety.\n\n[Authors: Joel Ackelsberg, MD, MPH, Jennifer Rakeman, PhD]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Any febrile illness with a history of travel to an endemic brucellosis area with the ingestion of unpasteurized dairy products, or such an illness without travel but with ingestion of unpasteurized dairy products imported from an endemic area, should bring up the possibility of brucellosis and the notification of the laboratory processing any cultures to take proper precautions.\n\nAs noted in the text, the identification of brucellae can be difficult and misidentification occurs especially in automated systems. - Mod.LL]\n\n[Photo of cultured _B. melitensis_\nhttp://image.slidesharecdn.com/brucella-130401032146-phpapp02/95/brucella-mahadi-ppt-12-638.jpg?cb=1364791952 - Mod.JW\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/234.]", "summary": "\n\nBrucellosis is the most commonly reported laboratory-acquired bacterial infection, which is likely due to the low infectious dose of _Brucella spp._ and the ease by which brucellae can be aerosolized in laboratory settings and inhaled or ingested (e.g., mouth pipetting or sprays to the face) by unprotected personnel. promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Any febrile illness with a history of travel to an endemic brucellosis area with the ingestion of unpasteurized dairy products, or such an illness without travel but with ingestion of unpasteurized dairy products imported from an endemic area, should bring up the possibility of brucellosis and the notification of the laboratory processing any cultures to take proper precautions.

'The dog had been unwell for a week, it was lethargic, not eating, and the owner noticed its testicles were swollen -- an obvious sign of the infection,' Ms Robinson said.\n\n'I conducted a blood test which returned positive for brucellosis -- this is the 1st case Gunnedah has seen.'\n\nOther clinical signs include fever, back pain, lameness, vomiting, enlarged lymph nodes, and blood in urine.\n\nUnder NSW legislation, brucellosis is a notifiable disease, and was reported to the NSW Department of Primary Industries (NSW DPI), who recommend euthanasia.\n\n'There isn't enough known about brucellosis in dogs and how long they remain infectious for, so the recommendation is euthanasia due to the risk of spreading to other dogs and people,' Ms Robinson said.\n\n'There is no effective treatment or cure for the disease.'\n\nMs Robinson said the dog was euthanised and all other dogs from the property were tested, returning negative results and would be re-tested in 6 weeks.\n\nShe said the disease was caught from direct contact with feral pigs. 'It is caught from bodily fluids and has also been detected in dogs that have been fed raw feral pig meat,' Ms Robinson said.\n\n'It can also be passed on to pups at birth if the mother is infected.'\n\nNSW DPI senior veterinary officer Amanda Lee said the disease had been detected in dogs that had been pig-hunting in northern NSW, particularly around the Moree area.\n\nThe NSW DPI website states brucellosis is potentially fatal in people, with symptoms [in people - Mod.TG] including intermittent fever, sweating, lethargy, loss of appetite, headaches, and back pain. Symptoms in human beings begin with a flu-like illness and can occur up to 6 months later, with potential relapses.\n\nMs Robinson said it was important for pig hunters to keep their dogs and themselves safe from contracting the disease. 'Hygiene is very important and protective clothing when gutting or killing feral pigs,' Ms Robinson said.\n\n'People should cover any cuts or abrasions on themselves or their dogs before pig hunting and not feed dead carcasses to animals.\n\n'People need to seek medical advice if they are unwell or veterinary attention for their dog if symptoms or clinical signs in the animal present after pig hunting.'\n\n[Byline: Ashley Gardner]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Brucellosis is a bacterial infection caused by Gram negative coccobacillus (short rods).\n\nBrucellosis is a serious, globally distributed zoonotic disease. Humans are susceptible to infection by _Brucella suis_, _B. abortus_, _B. melitensis_, and _B. canis_, and can have lifelong symptoms of undulating fever, enlarged lymph nodes, malaise, and arthritis.\n\nConsumption of unpasteurized dairy products confers the highest risk for brucellosis in disease-endemic areas. However, hunters and owners of hunting dogs are at high risk for transmission of brucellosis from wildlife. Sporadic transmission of _B. canis_ from pet dogs to their owners has been reported. We caution the public about the potential for transmission to humans in contact with infected dogs and wild hogs.\n\nSmooth _Brucella_ spp. express the immunodominant O side chain on the lipopolysaccharide of their surface. Therefore, this side chain forms the antigenic basis of diagnostic tests, such as the card test. The _B. abortus_ plate antigen (BAPA) test can detect smooth species. Because _B. canis_ does not express the O side chain on its surface, serologic tests for _B. canis_ differ from tests for _B. abortus_, _B. suis_, or _B. melitensis_. Therefore, _B. suis_-infected dogs are unlikely to have positive results for _B. canis_ tests and vice versa.\n\nAlthough transmission of _B. suis_ from dogs to humans has not been reported, _B. suis_ is second only to _B. melitensis_ in its pathogenicity to humans. Therefore, dogs exposed to feral hogs should be tested for _Brucella_ spp. and monitored for clinical signs, while keeping in mind that sensitivity and specificity of _B. abortus_-specific tests is unknown. If a pet is infected with _B. canis_, a long course of antimicrobial drugs and spaying or neutering to prevent breeding is advisable but might not be completely effective.\n\nBecause _B. suis_ is more pathogenic to humans than _B. canis_, and its mechanisms of pathogenesis in dogs can vary, the same recommendations might not be true for _B. suis_-infected dogs. Given the serious zoonotic implications of _B. suis_ infections, euthanasia of the affected pet may be advocated by regulatory agencies and physicians treating exposed humans.\n\nLittle information, including that for pathogenesis or duration of bacteremia, is available for _B. suis_ infections in dogs. Therefore, blood cultures might not reliably detect _B. suis_-infected dogs. For _B. canis_ infections, only animals certified free of _Brucella_ spp. by 2 consecutive serologic or blood culture tests conducted 4-6 weeks apart can be used as breeding stock in kennels. If an outbreak occurs in a kennel, all infected animals should be isolated and euthanized after showing positive test results. The premises should also be thoroughly disinfected before restocking.\n\n_B. suis_ is a public health concern in Australia, being mainly a recreational or occupational disease of feral pig hunters, farm workers, veterinarians, and abattoir workers.\n\nOrchitis is one of the predominant symptoms of _B. suis_ infection in pigs and dogs.\n\nReferences\n----------\n1.

Kamath's research also showed that a large herd of elk that winters in the Madison Valley seems to have been infected by elk that visited a winter elk feeding ground in Idaho.\n\nKamath presented the results of her study Saturday [17 Jan 2015] at Montana State University during a brucellosis talk organized by Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks. About 50 people attended.\n\nWyoming was long blamed for Montana's problems because, since 1909, it has concentrated elk on winter feedgrounds, at 1st to keep the elk from eating ranchers' grass, and more recently to artificially sustain wildlife populations for the state's popular elk hunting industry. Last year [2014], there were more than 20 state-sponsored winter feedgrounds in western Wyoming.\n\nIt's widely accepted among scientists that brucellosis is more easily spread when animals are concentrated, such as on feedgrounds.\n\nBut Kamath's analysis of 250 tissue samples from elk, wild bison, farmed bison and cattle debunks the long-held belief that Montana's wildlife was infected by Wyoming's feedground practices.\n\nSimilar genetic research has been used to track whether a dentist infected his patients with HIV as well as to find out that severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was transmitted to humans via an infected bat.\n\nBrucellosis can cause female ungulates to abort their 1st calves as well as infect humans with brucellosis. The most likely transmission source is when uninfected animals or people come into contact with aborted material from an infected host.\n\nAnother popularly circulated belief was that the outbreaks of brucellosis in cattle herds in the Paradise Valley, south of Livingston, were due to infected corriente cattle brought in from Mexico or Texas.\n\n'Based on the cases and isolates we have, there are no genetics from outside the (Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem) suggesting that,' Kamath said. 'It's very unlikely that something from outside is the source.'\n\nOver the last 3 years, Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks has enacted measures such as hazing, fencing and lethal removal of elk to try to keep elk and cattle separated to prevent the disease from spreading to cattle. Opponents have charged that there's little evidence that elk are the source of the infections, but Kamath's research shows otherwise.\n\nBy examining the _Brucella abortus_ bacteria in tissue from infected animals, Kamath could trace the infection almost like a family tree, showing where it originally came from and where it had split off to different hosts.\n\n'It's pretty accepted that (brucellosis) was introduced into the system when they brought in dairy cattle,' Kamath said, marking the 1st time brucellosis was found in the Yellowstone, Paradise Valley areas.\n\nSeparate source animals brought brucellosis to Wyoming and Idaho, her analysis showed.\n\nYet without actually seeing a cow touch infected elk birthing material, Kamath said she couldn't say positively that elk were the source of outbreaks of brucellosis in Montana cattle. 'I can just say it was the most likely route of transmission,' based on the genetic analysis, she said.\n\nThe preponderance of evidence does point to elk as the source of outbreaks, though, said Neil Anderson, FWP lab supervisor in Bozeman.\n\n'I'm a wildlife guy, and I don't want it to come from elk,' he said. 'But it's hard to say that elk are probably not the source.'\n\nIn the 1930s the U.S. Department of Agriculture attempted to wipe out brucellosis in all livestock with an intensive eradication and vaccination program. The work was so successful that brucellosis is believed to only persist in the United States in wildlife in Montana, Wyoming and Idaho.\n\nWhat's odd is that the disease can be traced back in elk and bison in Montana and Wyoming 30 to 40 years, yet it's only in the last 7 years that cattle tested positive for brucellosis in Montana. Why that has happened is unknown. 'There's something that's driving this expansion in the system,' Kamath said.\n\nWildlife managers believe it may be higher concentrations of elk in Montana on private and public lands -- up to 2600 elk in some herds -- changes in elk movements, or simply because of increased surveillance.\n\n[Byline: Brett French]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Bovine brucellosis (caused by _Brucella abortus_) has caused devastating losses to farmers in the United States over the last century.

According to the superficial description of the research, these introductions were of different sources in Wyoming and Idaho.

These 2 species share a common title name, also in several Middle Eastern countries, probably because many flocks are composed of both.\n\n_Brucella melitensis_ (biovars 1, 2, or 3) is the main causative agent of 'caprine and ovine brucellosis'. Sporadic cases caused by _B. abortus_ have been rarely observed in these species.\n\nClinically, the disease is characterised by one or more of the following signs: abortion, retained placenta, orchitis, epididymitis and, rarely, arthritis, with excretion of the organisms in uterine discharges and in milk. Diagnosis depends on the isolation of Brucella from abortion material, udder secretions or from tissues removed at post-mortem.\n\nPresumptive diagnosis of _Brucella_ infection can be made by assessing specific cell-mediated or serological responses to _Brucella_ antigens.\n\n_Brucella melitensis_ is highly pathogenic for humans, causing Malta fever, one of the most serious zoonoses in the world. All infected tissues, cultures, and potentially contaminated materials should therefore be handled at containment level 3. _B. melitensis_ is included in OIE list of reportable diseases/pathogens.\n\n_Brucella melitensis_ is endemic in the Mediterranean region, but infection is widespread world-wide. North America (except Mexico) is believed to be free from the agent, as are Northern and Central Europe, South-East Asia, Australia, and New Zealand. Southern and some central territories of the Russian Federation are long known to be infected by _B. melitensis_. The most recent Russian periodic report to the OIE, covering January-June 2014, mentions 19 new outbreaks (total of 30). In relation to the Tver oblast (north of Moscow; see maps at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tver_Oblast#/media/File:Tver_in_Russia.svg and http://www.mapsofworld.com/images/russia-political-enlarged-map.jpg) the following information could be derived from OIE's WAHID system, covering the period January 2005-June 2014: _B. melitensis_ cases have been reported only during the period July-December 2009 (2 cases in sheep/goats, destroyed) and January-June 2010 (7 cases in seep/goats, destroyed).\n\nAccording to a 2013 paper (Ref 1), brucellosis is still reported from all types of farms and domestic livestock in Russia, including strains of _B. abortus_, _B. melitensis_, _B. suis_, and _B. ovis_. Between 1999 and 2009, the number of infected sites slightly increased, ranging from 54 in 2001 to 112 in 2009. The number of sites affected with _B. melitensis_ reportedly increased but remained low: 13 in 2004 and 21 in 2009 (see Fig. 2 'Ovine brucellosis in the Russian Federation, 2003 to 2009' in Ref 1). The current cases in Tver may be indicative of increased incidence.\n\n'However', the authors of Ref 1 say, 'relatively low number of brucellosis-infected areas does not diminish the epizootic and epidemic significance of sheep and goats in the transmission of brucellosis. Since the Soviet Union's dissolution at the beginning of the 1990s, social and economic changes in Russia have led to huge changes in the management and ownership of agricultural animals. About 80 percent of all sheep and goats, and more than 50 percent of all cattle, were transferred from state to private farms. New livestock owners were largely unable to implement costly anti-brucellosis measures. As these private farms now included multiple livestock species, favourable conditions arose for the transmission of _B. melitensis_ to cattle, leading to a dramatic rise in new cases of brucellosis in humans (adults and children), due to this pathogen. Over the last 2 decades, large and small animal brucellosis has become a considerable problem within the Southern Federal District, the Southern Volga region, and the Siberian Federal District.'\n\n'In recent years, the epizootic situation of brucellosis in Russia has been complicated by:\n- economic difficulties that led to drastic reductions in regulatory efforts to stem brucellosis,\n- less effective veterinary and customs controls in areas bordering brucellosis-infected territories (Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Mongolia),\n- a decline in serological testing and vaccination of animals,\n- a reduction in microbiological evaluation of animal infection, leading to a lack of knowledge about the origin of infection,\n- a reduction in the ability to plan and implement brucellosis control policies in infected territories.'\n\nAdditional updated information on brucellosis in animal and man is available in Ref 2.\n\nReferences\n----------\n1.

This was associated with pain and swelling in his left knee, in which he had an uncomplicated total knee replacement 5 years previously for early-onset osteoarthritis following a motorcycling accident. There were no systemic abnormalities other than fever and there was an effusion in the symptomatic knee. Blood cultures yielded Gram negative coccobacilli after 3 days incubation (BioMerieux Bact/ALERT blood culture system), identified as _Brucella melitensis_ by MALDI-TOF (Bruker microflex LT), but not before 2 laboratory scientists had been exposed to open culture plates. Aspirate of cloudy fluid from the knee showed over 6000 lymphocytes and brucella organisms were cultured after 7 days' incubation. The patient has commenced a 3-month course of doxycycline and rifampin, together with parenteral gentamicin for the first 14 days. The exposed laboratory scientists were given doxycycline 100mg twice daily for 21 days as postexposure prophylaxis according to UK guidelines (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/brucella-reference-unit-bru-managing-laboratory-exposure).\n\nThe patient made frequent visits to Thailand, where he had stayed with a friend on his farm in Nakom Pathom province from 11 Dec 2014 to 8 Jan 2015. During that time he helped deliver several parturient goats and handled newly born kids and other products of conception with his bare hands. He had not consumed unpasteurized dairy products and had no contact with cattle or buffaloes. When his diagnosis was established, he informed us that a farm laborer was simultaneously being investigated in a Thai hospital for a mysterious fever. After the UK diagnosis was relayed to the physicians in Thailand, a diagnosis of brucellosis was thought likely and empiric treatment was commenced pending test results, with clinical improvement. The friend who owns the farm has now also been admitted with a similar illness, and investigations for suspected brucellosis are under way.\n\nDespite our local interest in brucellosis (1,2), this is not a diagnosis we would normally consider in a traveler returning from Thailand. As a contributing center, we reported this case within the GeoSentinel network and interrogated the GeoSentinel database, which now includes over 235 000 returning travellers (3). It includes only 82 patients with brucellosis. Only 22 from Asia: 2 cases from Thailand, 16 from South Central Asia (India 11, Iran 2, Nepal 2, Afghanistan 1) and 4 from North East Asia (China 2, Taiwan 1, 1 not specified).\n\nFoci in China, Mongolia and Central Eurasia are well recognised but the range of other countries newly affected by brucellosis continues to expand (4-6). Human infections seem to be grossly underreported compared to the patchy knowledge of its increasing incidence in livestock in South Asia (7). An outbreak of caprine and related human brucellosis in Ratchaburi Province in Thailand was reported in ProMed in 2003. The only other ProMed reports of brucellosis from this region included a boy who acquired brucellosis from raw goat's milk in Penang, Malaysia in 2010 and a German visitor who acquired brucellosis more recently in Myanmar, probably from drinking lassi. There have been sporadic case reports and 2 more detailed reviews of emerging brucellosis endemicity in Thailand over the past decade (8,9). As demonstrated by our patient, the highest risk to humans in Thailand is exposure to parturient goats (_B. melitensis_) but there is a separate risk of _B. abortus_ transmission from buffaloes. The areas of highest incidence appear to be Nakhon Si Thammarat Province and Kanchanaburi Province (8), which borders Nakom Pathom Province.\n\nClinicians should consider brucellosis as well as more commonly encountered causes of fever in returnees from Thailand and neighboring countries, such as dengue, scrub typhus, murine typhus, leptospirosis and malaria, and rarer bacterial infections such as melioidosis. A detailed risk exposure history will provide useful clues, and diagnosis of illness in travellers may aid diagnosis of unexplained illness in the country of origin.\n\nWe thank Elena Axelrod, David Hamer and Patricia Schlagenhauf for providing data from the GeoSentinel database and for helpful comments and we acknowledge our colleagues from the other 56 centres currently contributing data to the GeoSentinel network.\n\nReferences\n----------\n1.

The infection is also known as undulant fever, related to the occurrence of 1-3 week febrile periods separated by 1-3 days of afebrility. This occurs more likely with _B. melitensis_ (acquired from goats) as compared to _B. abortus_ (cattle) and _B. suis_ (swine).\n\nThe infection can be subclinical. Acute symptomatic brucellosis is generally manifest with nonspecific symptoms such as fever, chills, night sweats, anorexia, and an increased sense of ill health. The disease can be diagnosed serologically and/or by blood culture. The organism may grow quite slowly on primary isolation, and the clinician should make the microbiology laboratory aware of this potential diagnosis.\n\nLocalized infection may occur. Sites for localization include the skeletal system (1), heart valves (2) and urinary tract (3). Genitourinary [GU] brucellosis may present identically to GU tuberculosis. Psychiatric manifestations such as depression and anxiety are possible as late symptoms of brucellosis (4,5), so-called chronic neurobrucellosis. It remains unclear whether active brucella infection is present at that time. Overt CNS infection can, however, include meningitis and encephalitis (6,7).\n\nReferences\n----------\n1.

'That's why we have a program; we have to assure other states we're doing everything we can to manage this endemic wildlife disease problem.'\n\nSimilar to affected herds in the past, the low infection rate indicates early detection. 'It demonstrates that our aggressive surveillance program finds the disease before it is allowed to spread within the herd, which reduces costs for producers and minimizes risk for our trading partners,' he said.\n\nThe state has now found at least one case of brucellosis in cattle in 5 of the past 8 years.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Bovine brucellosis (caused by _Brucella abortus_) has caused devastating losses to farmers in the United States over the last century.

The bacterium became established in these wildlife species and does not currently pose a threat for their populations. However, it does represent a big concern for domestic livestock.\n\nElk, also known as wapiti (_Cervus canadensis_), are a reservoir of the disease, originally acquired from cattle. The elk are free to move in and out of the national park of Yellowstone. The elk feed at feeding grounds in the park. It is a tremendous tourist draw to see the large number of impressive animals. Some of these animals give birth to a calf at or near the feeding grounds. _Brucella abortus_, the organism responsible for the disease brucellosis, is often spread through the birthing process, fluids, and tissues. Other animals investigate the birthing site and probably become infected with the organism at that time. These same elk are free to move in and out of the park region, and thus may be spreading the disease to cattle they come into contact with in the area, thus, the article's statement of the likely source of the disease in the cow in question being elk.\n\nIn areas where a cow is found positive, the producers test their animals prior to moving them to market.

The disease leads to parasites [bacteria] in the host's bloodstream, and episodes may last weeks, months or even years. It causes potentially recurrent episodes of high fever, sweating and related anemia.\n\nAt least 4 of the victims of the outbreak have been hospitalized in the neighboring city of Porto, a spokesperson from the Northern Regional Health Administration told the Expresso newspaper.\n\nLocal authorities in the Porto municipality of Baiao said the source of the brucellosis outbreak was cheese from a home-based factory, adding that the infection had been contained.\n\n'The cases of brucellosis originated from consumption of cheese produced in an artisan fashion. The place and period when they were consumed has been identified,' a local government spokesperson said.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[According to OIE data, both _Brucella abortus_ and _B. melitensis_ are present in Portugal. _B. abortus_ is related (almost) exclusively to bovines, while _B, melitensis_, generally related to small ruminants (sheep & goats), has been shown to occasionally infect cattle as well, without clinical signs but readily causing the excretion of large quantities of the bacterium in milk, becoming a serious public health hazard. This mostly happens when cattle are exposed to aborting sheep or goats.\n\nThe report does not specify the pathogen involved, nor the animal species from which the milk for the incriminated cheese production was derived. Pasteurisation of the milk prior to its processing would have prevented brucella contamination of the final product (cheese), even if sourced from infected flocks. However, certain sheep cheeses are traditionally produced from raw, un-pastuerised milk. In such cases, the cheese should undergo pasteurisation after its processing and prior to marketing.\n\nPortugal is one of the few EU member states still infected with _B. melitensis_, similar to Spain, Greece and Italy. The following OIE data on _B. melitensis_ in Portugal pertain to the recent 5 years 2009-2013:\n\nYear / Outbreaks in animals / Human cases / Rate per 100 000 population\n2009 / 126 / 81 / 0.7666\n2010 / 91 / 86 / 0.8139\n2011 / 436* / 85 / 0.8045\n2012 / 133 / 47 / 0.4448\n2013 / 91 / 35 / 0.3312\n\nThe general trend observed in Portugal during the 5 years seems to indicate a gradual decrease in the number of outbreaks in animals (sheep/goats) and in the number of human cases (*the striking increase in number of animal outbreaks as reported for 2011 is in need of explanation/clarification).\n\nBrucellosis in humans yields low fatality rates but causes substantial host disability.

After wrestling with the emotions over taking an animal's life and surveying the distance back to the truck, I remembered an extra task that demanded immediate attention.\n\nI searched through my pack, found a small plastic tube and filled it with blood while field dressing the elk. I capped the container, placed it inside a protective bag and secured it back inside the pack.\n\nThe vial was one of about 1500 that the Idaho Department of Fish and Game provides to elk hunters each fall, according to Dr Mark Drew, the agency's state veterinarian. The blood samples are tested to gauge the prevalence of brucellosis, an infectious bacterial disease that causes pregnant elk to abort during their middle trimester. The particular strain that affects ruminants, _Brucella abortus_, likely arrived in North America via European cattle more than a century ago, then spilled over to elk and bison. According to a 2006 report from an Idaho wildlife brucellosis work group, the US Department of Agriculture implemented a national eradication effort in 1934.\n\nSince then, federal, state, and private resources amounting to more than USD 3 billion were used to address and eventually eradicate brucellosis in livestock. One region of the United States known as the Greater Yellowstone Area, however, still harbors elk and bison infected by the disease.\n\nNot only can brucellosis affect the health of Idaho's elk herds, but its continuing presence and potential for 'spillover' back to cattle remains worrisome. Twice in the past decade the state lost its 'Class Free' status when cattle in eastern Idaho likely became infected by elk.\n\nEliminating the infection in wildlife residing in the national park and the surrounding areas of Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming appears unlikely.\n\n'If it was easy, we would have done it decades ago,' Drew said. 'Coordinating between the states, 3 federal land-management agencies, several tribes and private landowners is a challenge.' When that effort covers a large landscape for animals that roam freely and cross all those entities' boundaries, the task becomes even more difficult.\n\nDrew believes that Idaho's management seems to be working, noting that, in contrast, Montana's and Wyoming's occurrence of brucellosis infections is increasing.\n\nThe main thrust behind Idaho's efforts focuses on keeping cattle and elk separate, especially during late winter. Deep snows can concentrate wildlife and livestock at a time when pregnant elk are in their 2nd trimester and most susceptible to abortions. If the 2 species mingle at that time, the likelihood for disease transmittal rises sharply.\n\nThe emphasis on separation is coordinated by state wildlife officials and the Idaho Department of Agriculture using several tactics. Idaho prohibits any private feeding of elk inside a specific region near Yellowstone known as the Designated Surveillance Area, Drew said. In addition, fences there are constructed not only to keep elk away from haystacks, but also to force cattle to remain inside their winter feeding areas.\n\nIn order to determine the prevalence and distribution of brucellosis in elk, Fish and Game established 2 means of monitoring. The Idaho Brucellosis Management Plan mandates that elk which the state feeds more than 3 consecutive winters are trapped, bled and tested on site. Seropositive elk -- or animals that carry brucellosis antibodies but not necessarily the disease -- are removed from the area.\n\nIn addition, Fish and Game supplies hunters with blood sampling kits like the one that I carried into the Pioneer Mountains last fall and mailed back to their laboratory in Boise. These kits are distributed on an annual rotation between 3 areas that include one west, one south and one inside Idaho's portion of the Greater Yellowstone Area.\n\nDrew says 15 percent of the sampling kits are usually returned, and with about half being usable, the laboratory often yields about 200 good samples. This effort, along with the live testing of elk at feeding sites, indicates that eastern Idaho's critical area contains seropositive elk at a rate of 2 percent to 3 percent.\n\nOf the samples returned last year [2013] from the entire area west of Interstate 15, no elk tested positive, Drew said.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Bovine brucellosis (caused by _Brucella abortus_) has caused devastating losses to farmers in the United States over the last century.

It usually begins with a high fever, which lasts for 7-10 days, but in case of absence of appropriate therapy, the temperature would keep up even for 2-3 months [so-called indolent fever - Mod.LL]. The fever is accompanied by chills, excessive sweating and general symptoms of intoxication. Later, it is joined by symptoms involving the musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, nervous, and other body systems.\n\n'Frequency of cases in 2014 has not changed in comparison with 2013,' she noted. 'The highest number of cases is reported in Ganja, Imishli and Bilasuvar, and the lowest number in Baku, North and South regions (Guba, Khachmaz, Astara and Masalli).

'Epidemic analysis of materials related to the main sources and routes of brucellosis transmission in our country in recent years has shown that the main source of infection is small livestock.'\n\nSuch cases have been recorded throughout the current year [2014] in Azerbaijan.

It was not until 1887 that a British physician, Dr David Bruce, isolated the organism that causes brucellosis from several deceased patients from the island of Malta. This disease has had several names throughout its history, including Mediterranean fever, Malta fever, Crimean fever, Bang's disease, and undulant fever (because of the relapsing nature of the fever associated with the disease).\n\nThe symptoms and signs of brucellosis may develop from days to months after the initial exposure to the organism.

The patients were found infected by the brucellosis bacterium, known to contaminate cheese and unpasteurized milk from infected animals. The cases have been reported to the Ministry of Health.\n\nThe bacteria cause a disease known as 'Malta fever.' The disease is found mainly in the non-Jewish sector in the Galilee [north], Wadi Ara [centre] and the Negev [south].\n\nThe Director of the pediatric infectious disease service in the Galilee medical center, Dr. Daniel Glickman, said the patients, arriving during the last 2 weeks at the hospital, are residents of the Druze villages Yarka and Julis, half of them children who consumed unpasteurized cheese; many of them relatives (father and daughter, cousins) who most probably consumed cheese from a common source.\n\n'The signs of the disease are usually joint and bone pain, accompanied by high fever. The disease is not contagious among humans and is mainly treated by antibiotics,' he said.\n\nThe patients were hospitalized in the pediatric and internal departments. One case, a 5-year-old girl, had to be hospitalized in the ICU to stabilize her condition.\n\nIt has been said that the current wave may continue, since the incubation period of exposed persons may take weeks and sometimes even months before clinically manifested. According to the Medical Center, throughout the course of 2013, only 10 patients had to be treated.\n\nAfter questioning by the hospital's doctors, 3 possible sources of infection have been identified.\n\nAbout 10 days ago, another cluster of brucellosis was discovered, in Jerusalem; 14 people were found infected following the consumption of unpasteurized cheese brought from the territory of the Palestinian Authority [West Bank].\n\n[Byline: Achiya Rabbed]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Most likely, all reported cases of Malta fever (the commonly used name for brucellosis in Israel) have been caused by _Brucella melitensis_, the bacteria species which is regarded endemic. There is a concerning increase of reported human cases during recent years (see further data of 2011-2013). The true number of human infections is generally considered to be significantly higher, many remaining unreported.\n\nUnfortunately, humans seem to have become the sentinels of brucellosis in sheep/goat flocks.\n\nNumber of outbreaks in animals and human cases (OIE data)\n---------------------------------------------------------\nYear / Outbreaks in animals / Human cases / Rate per 100 000 population\n2011 / 6 / 127 / 1.8076\n2012 / 14 / 183 / 2.6046\n2013 / 11 / 336 / 4.7822\n\nThe majority of the human brucellosis cases in Israel are caused by the ingestion of unpasteurized dairy products produced from family-owned sheep and/or goat flocks. Exposure to infected farm animals (occupational infection) is another common cause of infection. Though most of the human cases have been encountered, during previous years, in southern Israel, the current events are indicative of significant circulation of the agent in other parts of the country. The situation in the Palestinian territories is known to be even worse.\n\nThe main reservoir of _B. melitensis_ are sheep and goats, with the main symptom being abortions. _B. melitensis_ may occasionally infect cattle. In contrast to _B. abortus_, which causes abortions in cattle, _B. melitensis_ is not abortifacient in cattle, but will infect the udders, followed by massive discharge of the highly pathogenic bacteria in the milk and consequent human infections.\n\nResults of laboratory investigations, confirming the clinical diagnosis of the described cases, will be appreciated. It will be interesting to follow the epidemiological investigations at the 3 suspected sources of infection (Western Galilee) and obtain their results, hopefully identifying the source(s).

Both dogs presented separately to private veterinarians with clinical signs suggestive of brucellosis infection, including fever, enlarged lymph nodes and enlarged testicles.'\n\nDPI has been assisted by Local Land Services in the investigations.\n\nDr Lee said 2 other cases highlight the risk of brucellosis being transmitted to pups at birth.\n\n'We've also confirmed that a Bull Arab cross living in Sydney [NSW], and a Great Dane cross pup in Walgett [NSW] have tested positive for this disease,' Dr Lee said. 'Neither of the dogs have had any known contact with feral pigs, and we suspect the disease may have been passed on by their mother at birth. It is a crucial reminder for people to be aware of their animal's history and to purchase or obtain pups from reputable breeders.'\n\nDPI recommends that dogs confirmed infected with brucellosis be euthanased because of the potential risk to people.\n\nDirector of Communicable Diseases Branch NSW Health Dr Vicky Sheppeard said NSW Health is in contact with the owners of the infected dogs and vets who treated the dogs.\n\n'Brucellosis in humans is a potentially fatal disease, and symptoms may include intermittent fever, sweating, lethargy, loss of appetite, headache, and back pain,' Dr Sheppeard said. 'It is essential that people who are at an increased risk of brucellosis infection, including feral pig hunters, farm workers, vets and abattoir workers, practice good personal hygiene and wear protective clothing when in close contact with potentially infected animals.'\n\nOwners who are concerned that their dog may have signs of Brucellosis should contact their local veterinarian to have it assessed. The veterinarian will notify a Local Land Services inspector or an inspector with DPI if they consider the case suspect for brucellosis.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Brucellosis is a bacterial infection caused by Gram-negative coccobacillus (short rods).\n\nBrucellosis is a serious, globally distributed zoonotic disease. Humans are susceptible to infection by _Brucella suis_, _B. abortus_, _B. melitensis_, and _B. canis_, and can have lifelong symptoms of undulating fever, enlarged lymph nodes, malaise, and arthritis.\n\nConsumption of unpasteurized dairy products confers the highest risk for brucellosis in disease-endemic areas. However, hunters and owners of hunting dogs are at high risk for transmission of brucellosis from wildlife. Sporadic transmission of _B. canis_ from pet dogs to their owners has been reported. We caution the public about the potential for transmission to humans in contact with infected dogs and wild hogs.\n\nSmooth _Brucella_ spp. express the immunodominant O side chain on the lipopolysaccharide of their surface. Therefore, this side chain forms the antigenic basis of diagnostic tests, such as the card test. The _B. abortus_ plate antigen (BAPA) test can detect smooth species. Because _B. canis_ does not express the O side chain on its surface, serologic tests for _B. canis_ differ from tests for _B. abortus_, _B. suis_, or _B. melitensis_. Therefore, _B. suis_-infected dogs are unlikely to have positive results for _B. canis_ tests and vice versa.\n\nAlthough transmission of _B. suis_ from dogs to humans has not been reported, _B. suis_ is 2nd only to _B. melitensis_ in its pathogenicity to humans. Therefore, dogs exposed to feral hogs should be tested for _Brucella_ spp. and monitored for clinical signs, while keeping in mind that sensitivity and specificity of _B. abortus_-specific tests is unknown. If a pet is infected with _B. canis_, a long course of antimicrobial drugs and spaying or neutering to prevent breeding is advisable but might not be completely effective.\n\nBecause _B. suis_ is more pathogenic to humans than _B. canis_, and its mechanisms of pathogenesis in dogs can vary, the same recommendations might not be true for _B. suis_-infected dogs. Given the serious zoonotic implications of _B. suis_ infections, euthanasia of the affected pet may be advocated by regulatory agencies and physicians treating exposed humans.\n\nLittle information, including that for pathogenesis or duration of bacteremia, is available for _B. suis_ infections in dogs. Therefore, blood cultures might not reliably detect _B. suis_-infected dogs. For _B. canis_ infections, only animals certified free of _Brucella_ spp. by 2 consecutive serologic or blood culture tests conducted 4-6 weeks apart can be used as breeding stock in kennels. If an outbreak occurs in a kennel, all infected animals should be isolated and euthanized after showing positive test results.

Increasing Incidence of Human Brucellosis in Southern Israel after the Cessation of a Veterinarian Control Campaign\n---------------------------------------\nAbstract\n----------\nThe southern region of Israel is populated by a mostly urban Jewish majority (population: 385 200 inhabitants) and a large semi-nomadic Bedouin minority (population: 188 900) who maintain herds of sheep and goats. A retrospective study was conducted to assess the impact of the 1997 decision to discontinue a veterinarian control campaign on the epidemiology of human brucellosis in the region.\n\nDiscussion\n-------------\nBrucellosis appears to have been endemic to Middle East countries since ancient times affecting domesticated animals and humans as well. In modern times, rigorous control measures instituted by the Israel Ministry of Agriculture have eliminated brucellosis caused by _B. abortus_ among bovines, making the industrialized milk product supply safe. _Brucella melitensis_, however, continued to be endemic among sheep and goats, especially in nomadic Bedouin herds, and the veterinary control of the disease in this setting encountered serious logistic difficulties such as geographical dispersion of small herds, lack of shepherds' incentive to participate in the program, budgetary constraints, and illegal trade in infected animals. Although cessation of the eradication campaign in 1997 could have been justified by the steady decline in the endemic level of brucellosis observed countrywide, the present data clearly show that the disease was far from being brought to control in southern Israel. The results of the study demonstrate that, after a decline in the incidence of brucellosis in the early 2000's, starting in 2007, rates increased again and significantly exceeded the 1997 endemic level in 2012.\n\nThe relationship between the timing of the cessation of the veterinary control campaign and the epidemiological changes in the incidence of human disease in the Negev region is, therefore, not obvious. It is speculated that control measures did, in fact, decrease the prevalence of the zoonosis among domesticated animals because most infected sheep and goats were slaughtered and replaced by immunized animals, reducing the source of human contagion. Although the campaign was discontinued in 1997, its effect was still felt at the beginning of the following decade resulting in low attack rate of human infections. It is speculated that because the disease was not completely eradicated, brucellosis slowly built-up among animal herds, taking a few years before it spilled-over to the human population of the region. Close examination of the data demonstrate that the disease remained almost limited to Negev Bedouins who, although undergoing a rapid process of modernization and settlement in permanent towns, still keep goat and sheep herds and consume unpasteurized dairy products. The average incidence of brucellosis in the Bedouin community for the 11-year period (77.9 per 100 000 population) is appalling and ranks 2nd only to that reported among the population of neighboring Syria. These results indicate that countrywide data may overlook the incidence of a locally-endemic infection by diluting cases of disease amidst a large global denominator, and imply that the true magnitude of the problem should be assessed using specific data for the relevant population at risk.\n\nThe incidence rate of human brucellosis found in the present study can be considered only a minimal estimate. The study design did not include a small proportion of patients who could have been diagnosed in a few small clinical microbiology laboratories other than the CMLSUNC [Clinical Microbiology Laboratory of the Soroka University Medical Center, city of Beer-Sheva].\n\nIn addition, the protean clinical manifestations of human brucellosis may mimic other infectious and non-infectious conditions and, therefore, the true nature of the symptoms and signs may be easily missed. In a previous study conducted in southern Israel, isolation of _B. melitensis_ was frequently an unexpected finding in febrile Bedouin patients in whom the disease was not suspected. In a study conducted in the region, active search for the disease among relatives of 4 index patients with brucellosis resulted in the detection of an additional 12 undiagnosed cases. A similar experience was reported in Saudi Arabia, where screening of 404 family members of 55 diagnosed cases revealed an additional 53 (13.1 percent) serologically positive individuals, of which 9 were also bacteremic.\n\nConclusions\n-----------\nHuman brucellosis caused by _B. melitensis_ has reemerged as a serious public health threat to the Bedouin population of southern Israel in recent years. The Israel Ministry of Agriculture should reconsider its premature decision to terminate veterinary measures aimed to control brucellosis in domesticated animals, and implement a public education campaign to reduce human exposure to this preventable zoonotic disease.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[For additional details, including (16) references, subscribers are referred to the full text at the source URL. As apparent from the earlier postings this year [2014] (see at 'See Also'), the situation has been deteriorating in other parts of the country as well. The situation in the Palestinian territories (West Bank) is, most likely, as concerning as the one observed in the Negev Bedouin population.\n\nAccording to the most recent available Weekly Epidemiological Report of Israel's Ministry of Health, the tendency of increased human infection has been continuing in 2014. As of 24 May 2014 (the end of the 21st week of 2014), the accumulated number of officially reported new human cases was 210, compared to a total of 120 during the same period in 2013 (75 percent increase).

Human Brucellosis Outbreak Acquired through Camel Milk Ingestion in Southern Israel.\n------------------------------------\nAbstract\n--------\nBackground: Human brucellosis is common in southern Israel among the semi-nomadic Bedouin, a population that consumes unpasteurized dairy products. Though camel milk ingestion is a known mechanism for brucellosis acquisition, only a few reports of sporadic cases have been published in the medical literature.\n\nObjectives: To describe a local brucellosis outbreak in 15 extended Bedouin family members, following ingestion of infected camel milk.\n\nMethods: Data regarding patients' clinical manifestations, laboratory findings, treatment and outcome were collected from the hospital and the health fund clinics' computerized database. Camel's blood and milk were tested for Brucella serology and culture. Cases were defined by positive Rose Bengal test, symptoms correlating with brucellosis, and consumption of infected camel milk.\n\nResults: 15 patients were diagnosed with acute brucellosis from March to June 2011. 60 percent of cases had serum agglutination test titers of 1:160 or higher, and 4/8 (50 percent) had positive blood culture for _Brucella melitensis_. Arthralgia and fever were the most consistent clinical manifestations. Blood and milk serology and milk culture taken from the female camel were positive for _Brucella melitensis_.\n\nConclusions: The treating physicians must consider the possibility of infected camel milk ingestion as the mode of infection, both in sporadic cases and in outbreaks of brucellosis.\n\nDiscussion (excerpt)\n--------------------\nThe incidence rate of brucellosis in the Bedouin population in southern Israel was 49.4/100 000 in 2009 compared to the 1.8/100 000 nationwide incidence rate (Ministry of Health data) [later data available in item 2 above]. The high incidence rate of brucellosis in the Bedouin population could be attributed to lack of awareness regarding the nature of disease, modes of transmission and prevention methods.\n\nBetween 1998 and 2001, the local office of the Health Ministry initiated an educational community-based program aimed to increase awareness in the Bedouin population of the nature of disease, modes of transmission, and prevention methods including livestock vaccination. Evaluation of this program demonstrated a significant increase in the population's knowledge about brucellosis and its prevention methods, but there were no positive behavior changes (e.g., avoiding unpasteurized animal milk and not wearing gloves when in contact with animals).\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The camel population of Israel is, reportedly, about 11 000. Most countries in the region, which maintain much larger camel populations and where camel milk has become a popular and widely distributed commodity, may probably witness significantly higher numbers of human brucellosis cases. Information from such countries will be appreciated.\n\nIsrael managed to eradicate animal diseases such as bovine tuberculosis and _B. abortus_, and to successfully control others; efforts to control _B. melitensis_ have not been, so far, successful in spite of applied efforts, as described and discussed in item 2 above and in Ref 1. The situation in other countries, particularly in the Middle east and central Asia but also in the rest of the Mediterranean basin, in the Balkans and Mexico, is similar and in some of them even worse. Israel's experience deserves to be studied and lessons drawn for all concerned.\n\nThe financial losses caused by the disease to animal owners are much lower than the devastating damage to human health; this is an obstacle in obtaining the owners' cooperation, unless control measures, including vaccination and animal identification, are free of charge and full, immediate compensations are paid when required. Only a 'one health' attitude, backed by the legal, financial and enforcement powers of national authorities would have a chance for significant achievements in the efforts to control, and -- hopefully -- eventually eradicate this long-known zoonosis from animals and consequently from humans. Some internationally accumulated lessons and guidelines may be found in refs 2 and 3.\n\nIn his preface to a recent edition of OIE's Rev Sci Tech dedicated to Brucellosis (ref 3), OIE's Director General, Bernard Vallat, wrote: 'The study of zoonotic brucellosis served as a basis for some of the great early advances in epidemiology, yet the disease remains the most common chronic bacterial infection in the world. It continues to cause important medical, veterinary, socioeconomic and conservation problems, mainly because its overall burden remains underestimated and often neglected.'\n\nReferences\n\n1.

Bredio Velazco, Veterinarian and Animal Health deputy director of the Ministry of Agricultural Development (MIDA), confirmed to FOX Report that there are 6 affected animal farms, but denied that it was passed to humans.\n\nThe secretary general of the MoH, Felix Bonilla reported that they are awaiting for results of confirmatory tests from Gorgas Memorial Hospital reports La Prensa,\n\nThe 22 examined in October [2013] are working on the farms El Pensamiento and Los Mangos, located 30 minutes from downtown Capira. The [detection of bovine brucellosis] in Capira Resume took place in October 2013, when 72 cattle were slaughtered on 3 farms, 2 dairy and 1 meat, in Monte Oscuro, and the valley was quarantined. Despite the measure, which banned the movement of cattle, Velazco confirmed that 2 animals were infected with brucellosis in Darien, on a farm whose owner is the same as that of one in Capira, which has raised questions about the effectiveness of the quarantine. '129 animals were sacrificed,' Velazco told local television.\n\nThe official did not seem concerned said La Prensa. 'I foresaw more cases,' he said. 'We are mitigating the situation,' he added. But for the Association of Dairy Producers (Aprogalpa), the cases are 'worrying' because it is a highly contagious disease and especially as the origin of the outbreak is still unknown.\n\nThe last time Panama had bovine brucellosis was in 2004, and human cases in 2009, according to the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE). The spread of brucellosis to humans is through consumption of unpasteurized milk, undercooked meat, or contact with secretions from infected animals. It produces abortions in animals and in humans, fever, weakness, and general pain. 'It is an extremely infectious zoonosis' warns the OIE.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The following moderator comments regarding _Brucella abortus_ in bovines are taken from ProMED-mail 'Brucellosis, bison - Canada: (AB),' archive number 20110730.2294:\n\n'Brucellosis, in cattle, water buffalo, and bison is caused almost exclusively by _Brucella abortus_; however, _B. suis_ or _B. melitensis_ are occasionally implicated in some cattle herds. _B. suis_ does not appear to be contagious from cow to cow. Infection spreads rapidly and causes many abortions in unvaccinated cattle. In a herd in which the disease is endemic, an infected cow typically aborts only once after exposure; subsequent gestations and lactations appear normal. After exposure, cattle become bacteremic for a short period and develop agglutinins and other antibodies; some resist infection, and a small percentage of infected cows recover. A positive serum agglutination test usually precedes an abortion or a normal parturition but may be delayed in about 15 per cent of cows. The incubation period may be variable and is inversely related to stage of gestation at time of exposure. Organisms are shed in milk and uterine discharges, and the cow may become temporarily infertile. Bacteria may be found in the uterus during pregnancy, uterine involution, and infrequently, for a prolonged time, in the non-gravid uterus. Shedding from the vagina largely disappears with the decrease of fluids following parturition. Some infected cows that previously aborted shed brucellae from the uterus at subsequent normal parturitions. Organisms are shed in milk for a variable length of time, in most cattle for life.\n\nNatural transmission occurs by ingestion of organisms, which are present in large numbers in aborted fetuses, fetal membranes, and uterine discharges. Cattle may ingest contaminated feed and water, or lick contaminated genitals of other animals. Venereal transmission by infected bulls to susceptible cows appears to be rare. Transmission may occur by artificial insemination when brucella-contaminated semen is deposited in the uterus but, reportedly, not when deposited in the mid-cervix. Brucellae may enter the body through mucous membranes, conjunctivae, wounds, or intact skin.\n\nBrucellae have been recovered from fetuses and from manure that has remained in a cool environment for more than 2 months. Exposure to direct sunlight kills the organisms within a few hours.\n\nBecause organisms are shed in the milk, unpasteurized milk, and cheese represent a human health concern. Many individuals believe drinking unpasteurized milk is better for their health. Diseases that are not killed by pasteurization represent a risk to the consumer.

Exposure to direct sunlight kills the organisms within a few hours.\n\nBecause organisms are shed in the milk, unpasteurized milk, and cheese represent a human health concern. \n\n\nA total of 7 people in Capira [district, Panama province] are suspected of being infected with bovine brucellosis, a potentially deadly disease detected in cattle from 6 farms the area and in Darien. Despite the measure, which banned the movement of cattle, Velazco confirmed that 2 animals were infected with brucellosis in Darien, on a farm whose owner is the same as that of one in Capira, which has raised questions about the effectiveness of the quarantine. ' The [detection of bovine brucellosis] in Capira Resume took place in October 2013, when 72 cattle were slaughtered on 3 farms, 2 dairy and 1 meat, in Monte Oscuro, and the valley was quarantined. The spread of brucellosis to humans is through consumption of unpasteurized milk, undercooked meat, or contact with secretions from infected animals. \n\nThe last time Panama had bovine brucellosis was in 2004, and human cases in 2009, according to the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE). The secretary general of the MoH, Felix Bonilla reported that they are awaiting for results of confirmatory tests from Gorgas Memorial Hospital reports La Prensa,\n\nThe 22 examined in October [2013] are working on the farms El Pensamiento and Los Mangos, located 30 minutes from downtown Capira. After exposure, cattle become bacteremic for a short period and develop agglutinins and other antibodies; some resist infection, and a small percentage of infected cows recover. \n\nNatural transmission occurs by ingestion of organisms, which are present in large numbers in aborted fetuses, fetal membranes, and uterine discharges.

'It is still an uncontrolled serious public health problem in many developing countries, including India. In livestock, brucellosis results in reduced productivity, abortions and infertility, leading to considerable economic losses,' said Dr Gill.\n\nAsked about the measures to control it, he said that to date there is no treatment for it. 'While foreign nations slaughter animals, here it is not allowed. All we can do is to isolate animal from farm. In humans, antibiotics can only control the spread. That too only if damage has not reached beyond a level. If [it has] reached the joints, then it is irreversible,' he said.\n\n[Byline: Divya Goyal]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Bovine brucellosis is usually caused by _Brucella abortus_, less frequently by _B. melitensis_, and occasionally by _B. suis_. Infection is widespread globally. Several countries in Northern and Central Europe, Canada, Japan, Australia and New Zealand are believed to be free from _B. abortus_.\n\nClinically, the disease is characterised in cattle by one or more of the following signs: abortion, retained placenta, orchitis (testicular inflammation), epididymitis (inflammation of the epididymis, a tube at the back of the testicle) and, rarely, arthritis, with excretion of the organisms in uterine discharges and in milk. Diagnosis depends on the isolation of _Brucella_ from abortion material, udder secretions or from tissues removed at post-mortem. Presumptive diagnosis can be made by assessing specific cell-mediated or serological responses to _Brucella_ antigens.\n\nThough both _B. abortus_ and _B. melitensis_ are known to be endemic in India (Ref), only _B. abortus_ is mentioned in India's annual reports to the OIE. The bacteria _B. melitensis and _B. suis_, both highly pathogenic for humans, are included in the list of diseases 'for which no information has been provided.'\n\nAccording to India's most recent annual report to the OIE, a total of 7 cases of bovine brucellosis, in 5 new outbreaks, have been recorded in cattle during 2012 throughout the entire country. This is an astonishingly low figure for a disease known to be endemic. The deficient surveillance, which leads to under-reporting, is particularly concerning when a zoonotic disease is at stake. In such a situation, high prevalence of human disease should not surprise.\n\nThe brucellosis-related control measures applied in India are, reportedly, limited to 'testing' and 'quarantine.' The above media report indicates that slaughter of infected animals is the only available means of control. Why preventive cattle vaccination has not been applied, remains to be clarified. Similarly, information on the situation regarding _B. melitensis_ and _B. suis_ is requested.\n\nReference:\nMantur B G and Amarnath S K 2008. Brucellosis in India -- a review; J.

This has been reportedly claimed in a report submitted by a leading diagnostic centre of the city to the Kanpur zoo authorities, giving complete description of the health status of the entire zoo staff.\n\nThe diagnostic centre had conducted medical check-up of the zoo employees and confirmed the presence of these bacteria in zoo employees. In September and October [2013], the zoo authorities had gotten their employees to undertake medical tests at a leading private diagnostic centre. The tests performed by this centre revealed that the staffers are suffering from various zoonotic diseases and need proper treatment. The decision to conduct the medical check-up for zoonotic diseases of the entire zoo staff was taken by the zoo veterinarians Dr RK Singh and Dr UC Srivastava.\n\nAccording to reliable sources, as many as 30 zoo employees are affected with leptospirosis disease (caused by bacteria _Leptospira_) alone. Some 10 zoo staffers are affected with brucellosis, including the zoo director, Kuruvilla Thomas, and zoo veterinarian RK Singh.\n\nDr Ashish Srivastava, a doctor (member) of a medical panel constituted by the Chief Medical Officer, Kanpur Nagar, on his visit to Kanpur zoo for conducting the health check-up of the zoo staff, told TOI [Times of India] that 'the zoo director and zoo veterinarian are affected with _Brucella_ bacteria but there is nothing to worry and neither is there any threat of spread of any epidemic'.\n\n'Those who stay in contact with the animals, especially at places like zoos, often suffer from zoonotic diseases. This could be termed as an occupational disease. But there is nothing to worry about. We have already examined 60 zoo employees and the remaining will be examined on Friday [15 Nov 2013]. Also, the required medicines which form the part of the treatment will be given to the zoo authorities in a day or 2,' said Dr Srivastava while talking to TOI.\n\nA panel of doctors comprising Dr Ashish Srivastava, deputy District Tuberculosis Officer Dr AP Mishra and 5 other medical staff visited Kanpur zoo on Thursday [14 Nov 2013] to conduct the health check-up of the zoo staff.\n\nThe panel of doctors had been constituted by CMO Kanpur Nagar Dr RP Yadav on the request of the Kanpur zoo administration to re-check them against zoonotic diseases and to give them proper treatment for the same.\n\nContacted, CMO Dr Yadav said, 'Those staying around wild animals, especially in places like zoos, are often exposed to these bacteria. Such risk runs in the employees of the Kanpur zoo as well. On the request of the Kanpur zoo authorities, I had constituted a team of doctors who visited zoo on Thursday [14 Nov 2013] and conducted some tests for confirmation of the diseases.'\n\nTOI also spoke to zoo director Kuruvilla Thomas. He said, 'It was a routine check up of the health of the zoo staff. The team of doctors was the part of the panel constituted by the CMO. The doctors medically examined the zoo staff for zoonotic diseases, including tuberculosis. We will treat the affected persons accordingly.'\n\nHowever, when the zoo director was asked whether he was suffering from any zoonotic disease, he refused to comment.\n\nZoo veterinarian Dr RK Singh said that the prescribed tests were performed on the zoo staff according to the All-India Service Rules. The zoo authorities also followed the guidelines of the Central Zoo Authority while conducting the health check-up of the staff, he added. However, he too declined any comment about his health.\n\n[Byline: Abhinav Malhotra]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Zoos and wildlife reserves often house many species of wild mammals, birds, amphibians and reptiles. Because many zoo employees work in close contact with these wild animals, there is risk of transmission of zoonotic diseases from wild animals to humans. Zoonotic diseases that could be transmitted from wild animals in zoos include tuberculosis, rabies, anthrax, leptospirosis, listeriosis, brucellosis, tularemia, campylobacteriosis, salmonellosis, enteric _E. coli_ infections, hepatitis E, Q fever, psittacosis, influenza A, Newcastle disease, hendra virus, nipah virus, herpes B encephalitis, toxoplasmosis, cat scratch disease, SARS, malaria of nonhuman primates, hantavirus infections, ebolavirus and Marburg virus infections, and bacterial and fungal skin infections, to mention only a selection (http://www.absa.org/pdf/ZoonoticFactSheet.pdf). Some are transmitted by direct contact (including animal bites and needle stick injuries), contaminated food, water, aerosol, or bites of arthropod vectors. Some have multiple modes of transmission. A zoo employee with a contagious zoonosis may then become a source for further spread of the infection into the community.\n\nAn excellent review on this topic is: Chethan Kumar HB, Lokesha KM, Madhavaprasad CB, Shilpa VT, Karabasanavar NS and Kumar A (2013) Occupational zoonoses in zoo and wildlife veterinarians in India, Vet World 6(9): 605-613. This article reports that there are in India 198 zoos (including circuses), 102 national parks, 515 wildlife sanctuaries, 47 conservation reserves and 4 community reserves for the purpose of wildlife conservation.\n\nIt appears from the news report above that so far 60 employees at the zoo in Kanpur, India were examined for the presence of some of these zoonoses. We are not told which zoonotic diseases were surveyed and exactly how the examinations were done, perhaps by history and physical exams, serologies, skin tests (e.g., tuberculin skin test), microbiologic tests (e.g., stool cultures), or chest X-rays. Of the 60 employees examined so far, 30 have evidence, perhaps serological, of leptospirosis, and 10 have evidence, also perhaps serological, of brucellosis.\n\nWe are also not told if any of these employees were currently ill as a result of a zoonosis, nor the degree of contact the employees had with the zoo animals. For example, some of the zoo employees with evidence of leptospirosis or brucellosis may have administrative roles with very limited animal contact.\n\nTo understand the significance of this prevalence survey, however, we would also need to know if the prevalence of these diseases in zoo employees reflects their prevalence in the general community. (See: Forsyth MB, Morris AJ, Sinclair DA, Pritchard CP. Investigation of zoonotic infections among Auckland Zoo staff: 1991-2010. Zoonoses Public Health. 2012;59(8):561-7.

Jorge Handal, chairman of the Cattlemen's Association (Agas, by its initials in Spanish) said that unless action is taken these [outbreaks] can turn into an epidemic that could deal a serious blow to Honduran livestock because the bacteria affect the breeding cow, which would not be able to breed again.\n\n'The livestock sector in Honduras has been given a real hit. If this [outbreak) becomes an epidemic, and we hope to God that it will not, all the cattle could be lost,' said Handal, who has called upon President Porfirio Lobo to revive a [livestock] health program to control the outbreak of the bacteria.\n\nLivestock producers attended a seminar given by Julio Paredes, a veterinarian and microbiologist from Ecuador, on how to detect positive cases of the bacteria in cattle and what measures to take. These bacteria are a problem that occurs in all countries that have livestock.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[We do not often hear of simultaneous outbreaks of bovine tuberculosis and brucellosis, but it can happen.\n\nBovine brucellosis, caused by the bacterium _Brucella abortus_, is an economically important cause of abortions in cattle. _B. abortus_ also affects other species including bison, buffalo, and elk; some species are maintenance hosts for this organism. Infections in wildlife can hinder eradication efforts in cattle. In addition, _B. abortus_ is a human pathogen. In humans, brucellosis can be a serious, debilitating, and sometimes chronic disease that may affect a variety of organs. Most cases are the result of occupational exposure to infected animals, but infections can also occur from ingesting contaminated dairy products.\n\nIn animals, _B. abortus_ frequently causes abortion, especially in bovine, and is usually transmitted by contact with the placenta, fetus, fetal fluids, and vaginal discharges from infected animals. Animals are infectious after either abortion or full-term parturition. _B. abortus_ may also be found in the milk, urine, semen, feces, and hygroma [cystic swelling containing a serous fluid] fluids. Shedding in milk can be prolonged or lifelong, and may be intermittent. Many infected cattle become chronic carriers.\n\nUnderstanding the epidemiology of the disease, where it came from, and how it came to be in a particular herd are important aspects of controlling the disease. This investigation allows one to determine how far the disease has spread, and therefore, how to contain it.\n\n_B. abortus_ can be eradicated from a herd by test and removal procedures, or by depopulation. It is possible, using this method, to become brucellosis free.\n\nBovine tuberculosis is a chronic bacterial disease of cattle that occasionally affects other species of mammals. This disease is a significant zoonosis that can spread to humans, typically by the inhalation of aerosols or the ingestion of unpasteurized milk. In developed countries, eradication programs have reduced or eliminated tuberculosis in cattle, and human disease is now rare; however, reservoirs in wildlife can make complete eradication difficult. Bovine tuberculosis is still common in less developed countries, and severe economic losses can occur from livestock deaths, chronic disease, and trade restrictions. In some situations, this disease may also be a serious threat to endangered species.\n\nBovine tuberculosis results from infection by _Mycobacterium bovis_, a Gram positive, acid-fast bacterium in the _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ complex of the family _Mycobacteriaceae_.\n\n_M. bovis_ can be transmitted by the inhalation of aerosols, by ingestion, or through breaks in the skin. The importance of these routes varies between species. Bovine tuberculosis is usually maintained in cattle populations, but a few other species can become reservoir hosts.\n\nTuberculosis is usually a chronic debilitating disease in cattle, but it can occasionally be acute and rapidly progressive. Early infections are often asymptomatic. In countries with eradication programs, most infected cattle are identified early and symptomatic infections are uncommon. In the late stages, common symptoms include progressive emaciation, a low-grade fluctuating fever, weakness, and inappetence. Animals with pulmonary involvement usually have a moist cough that is worse in the morning, during cold weather or exercise, and may have dyspnea or tachypnea. In the terminal stages, animals may become extremely emaciated and develop acute respiratory distress.\n\nBovine tuberculosis can be controlled by test-and-slaughter or test-and-segregation methods. Affected herds are re-tested periodically to eliminate cattle that may shed the organism; the tuberculin test is generally used. Infected herds are usually quarantined, and animals that have been in contact with reactors are traced. Only test-and-slaughter techniques are guaranteed to eradicate tuberculosis from domesticated animals.\n\nWhile there is a vaccine to control brucellosis in bovines, until recently there has not been a vaccine for tuberculosis in bovines.

In animals, _B. abortus_ frequently causes abortion, especially in bovine, and is usually transmitted by contact with the placenta, fetus, fetal fluids, and vaginal discharges from infected animals. Communicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n Bovine tuberculosis is usually maintained in cattle populations, but a few other species can become reservoir hosts. If this [outbreak) becomes an epidemic, and we hope to God that it will not, all the cattle could be lost,' said Handal, who has called upon President Porfirio Lobo to revive a [livestock] health program to control the outbreak of the bacteria. Bovine tuberculosis results from infection by _Mycobacterium bovis_, a Gram positive, acid-fast bacterium in the _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ complex of the family _Mycobacteriaceae_. \n\n_B. abortus_ can be eradicated from a herd by test and removal procedures, or by depopulation. In countries with eradication programs, most infected cattle are identified early and symptomatic infections are uncommon.", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "brucellosis", "tuberculosis"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": [], "locations": [{"location": "SB", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Ecuador", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Honduras", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "La Prensa", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "2084249", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Brucellosis, canine - USA: (MI)", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=2084249", "date": "2013-12-01 10:17:58", "main_text": "BRUCELLOSIS, CANINE - USA: (MICHIGAN)\n*************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Wed 27 Nov 2013\nSource: Detroit Free Press [edited]\nhttp://www.freep.com/article/20131127/NEWS06/311270054/Canine-brucellosis-disease\n\n\nState agriculture officials said this week that they've recently investigated 3 cases [involving 8 dogs] of a bacterial disease that affects dogs and can be transmitted to humans.\n\nCanine brucellosis has been found in dogs in Montcalm, Calhoun, and Mackinac counties, according to the Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development. 3 investigations were launched in the past 4 months, officials said.\n\nCanine brucellosis is often sexually transmitted and can cause dogs to experience miscarriage, stillbirths, inflammation in the male reproductive system, semen abnormalities, eye problems, and back pain. People can become infected if they're exposed to a dog's birthing fluid, saliva, feces, urine, or eye or nasal fluids.\n\nState officials are encouraging anyone who suspects their dog is infected, or who has a dog that may have come from a breeder with infected dogs, to get the animal tested. Antibiotics will not cure the disease in dogs. 'Pets do not have to be euthanized, but it's important to follow the guidelines to prevent spreading the infection, including spaying or neutering, and isolation from other dogs,' State Veterinarian James Averill said in message posted this week [26 Nov 2013] on the agriculture department's website\n[http://www.michigan.gov/mdard/0,4610,7-125-1572_3628-317198--,00.html].\nIn a 2009 report, the department said canine brucellosis was 'an emerging concern in Michigan's dog breeding facilities and 'puppy mills.' ' That year, officials investigated 14 suspected cases; 5 were confirmed positive.\n\nPeople infected with brucellosis may experience fever, body aches, headaches, sweating and fatigue, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In humans, brucellosis is also known as undulant fever or Mediterranean fever, state officials said. [or Malta fever - Mod.TG]\n\nOther animals that are most commonly infected with brucellosis include sheep, cattle, goats and pigs, according to the CDC. Consuming undercooked meat or raw dairy products can lead to human infection.\n\nKristi Valentini, marketing manager for Michigan Veterinary Specialists, said it's rare to see brucellosis in dogs. 'It's so rare that the 3 internists I talked to in our Southfield and Ann Arbor hospitals have never seen a case of it in their careers,' she said. 'It's more likely to occur in large animals, like livestock, or dogs that are breeding animals.'\n\nMontcalm County case\n--------------------\nOfficials said the Montcalm County case involved an occasional dog breeder with 6 dogs, including Boston terriers, pugs, and French bulldogs. 5 of the 6 dogs tested positive for brucellosis and were euthanized. No humans were known to have fallen ill.\n\nMackinac County case\n--------------------\nThe Mackinac County case involved 2 golden retriever/Labrador mixes who were brought to Michigan from Kentucky in 2011. The dogs were littermates and had a history of back pain, state officials said. Both dogs tested positive and were euthanized.\n\nCalhoun County case\n-------------------\nIn Calhoun County, a breeder with 14 breeding dogs took 4 of them to a veterinarian for testing. One of the males tested positive and was euthanized. The other dogs were put under quarantine. No humans were known to have fallen ill.\n\nState officials offered these tips:\n- Dog owners should make sure that any dogs they are planning to use in a breeding program do not have brucellosis.\n- Breeding kennels should be on a brucellosis surveillance program.\n- People purchasing a puppy from a breeder should ask to see negative test results from the dogs that produced the litter. Anyone getting a dog from a pet shop or animal shelter should talk to their veterinarian about screening tests.\n- Newly acquired breeding dogs and dogs with a history of reproductive problems or certain eye or spine disorders should be tested.\n\n[Byline: Ann Zaniewski]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The state of Michigan can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at http://healthmap.org/r/2_1t. The counties affected can be seen on the map at http://geology.com/county-map/michigan.shtml.\n\nCanine brucellosis, caused by _Brucella canis_, is an important cause of reproductive failure, particularly in kennels. This organism causes abortions, stillbirths, epididymitis [inflammation of ducts next to the testicle], orchitis [inflammation of the testicle] and sperm abnormalities in dogs. Although dogs that have been spayed or neutered do not have reproductive signs, they occasionally develop other conditions such as ocular disease and discospondylitis (inflammation of the spinal vertebrae and intervertebral discs). _B. canis_ can persist in an animal even after antibiotic treatment. In kennels, infected dogs are often euthanized to prevent them from infecting other dogs or people. Canine brucellosis is sometimes difficult to diagnose with the currently available tests.\n\nAlthough _B. canis_ is zoonotic, its importance as a cause of human illness is still unclear. Few cases have been reported in people, and most of these infections have been mild. However, human infections with _B. canis_ may be underdiagnosed. The symptoms of this disease are nonspecific, diagnostic suspicion is low among physicians, and bacterial culture is the only commonly available test for diagnosis in people.\n\n_B. canis_ occurs in the fetus, placenta, fetal fluids, and vaginal discharge after an abortion or stillbirth. It can persist in vaginal discharges for several weeks after an abortion. It is also shed in normal vaginal secretions, particularly during estrus, as well as in milk. High concentrations of _B. canis_ may be found in semen for weeks or months after infection, and intermittent shedding of smaller quantities can occur for years. _B. canis_ is also shed in urine, and low concentrations of bacteria may be excreted in saliva, nasal and ocular secretions and feces.\n\nIn dogs, _B. canis_ primarily enters the body by ingestion and through the genital, oronasal and conjunctival mucosa, but transmission through broken skin may also be possible. Most cases are thought to be acquired by venereal transmission or by contact with the fetus and fetal membranes after abortions and stillbirths. Puppies can be infected in utero, and may remain persistently infected even if they appear normal. Nursing puppies can be infected from milk, but the importance of this route is controversial. Other potential sources of infection include blood transfusions and contaminated syringes.\n\n_B. canis_ can be spread on fomites. In conditions of high humidity, low temperatures and no sunlight, _Brucella_ spp can remain viable for several months in water, aborted fetuses, feces, equipment, and clothing. _Brucella_ spp can withstand drying, particularly when organic material is present, and can survive in dust and soil. Survival is longer when the temperature is low, particularly when it is below freezing.\n\nHumans usually become infected with members of the genus _Brucella_ by ingesting organisms or via the contamination of mucous membranes and abraded skin. In case reports, _B. canis_ infections have been described after close contact with dogs, especially animals that recently aborted or gave birth, and after exposure to large amounts of the organism in laboratories (such as, contact with bacterial cultures). However, the source of the organism could not be determined in some cases.\n\nWhile documented human cases of _B. canis_ are rare, and may be underreported, immunocompromised people should be especially careful around animals known to be positive for _B. canis_.\n\nPortions of this comment were extracted from http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/brucellosis_canis.pdf. - Mod.TG]", "summary": "Source: Detroit Free Press [edited]\nhttp://www.freep.com/article/20131127/NEWS06/311270054/Canine-brucellosis-disease\n\n\nState agriculture officials said this week that they've recently investigated 3 cases [involving 8 dogs] of a bacterial disease that affects dogs and can be transmitted to humans.

In general, the geographical distribution of biovar 2 has historically been in a broad range between Scandinavia and the Balkans. The prevalence in wild boars appears to be high throughout continental Europe. In recent outbreaks in Europe, wild boars have been implicated as the source of transmission of biovar 2 to outdoor reared pigs; in rare cases, such as the one recently described in Belgium (see 20120520.1139015), other domestic animals, such as bovines, may become infected.\n\nIn addition to wild boars, the European hare (_Lepus capensis_) is also considered to be a reservoir for _B. suis_ biovar 2 and has been implicated as a possible source of transmission to domestic livestock. _Brucella suis_ biovar 2 causes miliary lesions, particularly in reproductive tissues, that often become purulent. To date, biovar 2 has rarely been reported as the cause of human brucellosis. However, biovar 2 infection has been reported in 2 immuno-compromised hunters who had been extensively exposed through gutting or skinning boars or hares.\n\nThe above information is mainly derived from chapter 2.8.5 of OIE's Manual of Diagnostic Tests and Vaccines for Terrestrial Animals, where additional information can be found; available at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.08.05_PORCINE_BRUC.pdf.\n\nThe above OIE notification includes an interactive map.

'It's unfortunate. We obviously don't like finding brucellosis in our cattle, but the silver lining is that the program we've invested so much time and effort in is working,' Zaluski said. 'The infected cow was found quickly and didn't leave the DSA.'\n\nThe state will not lose its Brucellosis Class Free Status, Zaluski said, as the US Department of Agriculture's [USDA] brucellosis program is currently operating under an interim rule that de-emphasizes class status and directs states to focus on surveillance.\n\nThe cow was found in a herd of about 1000 head, which are currently quarantined and undergoing a whole-herd test. In previous brucellosis-affected herds, the rate of infection has been extremely low -- around 1 percent, Zaluski said.\n\n'Fact is, we're finding it, we're finding it early, and we're not letting infected animals make it to market,' Zaluski said. 'We've got a good program that works well for our producers and keeps infected animals from entering interstate commerce.' Governor Steve Bullock said the state has been aggressive in developing and implementing a 'practical and workable' brucellosis plan.\n\n'When brucellosis was found in 2007 for the 1st time in 22 years, it was a real wake-up call,' Bullock said. 'The livestock industry is a vital component of our economy, and as an export state, we had to reassure our trade partners that we're serious about managing brucellosis and eliminating risks to other states.

I think the last reactor we had in Louisiana was in an animal that went to market, was routinely tested, and found positive. It had come from a herd that had been closed for some 16 years, nothing in, nothing out. The problem is made harder in Montana because of the background of occasional reactors found in the bison and elk populations. Ted Turner, a significant bison rancher in Montana, supports an aggressive bleeding and testing of his thousands of plains bison. We reported a single reactor, a bull bison in 2011 [ 20111204.3528], also in Madison County. The elk prevalence has been estimated at 3-5 percent; locally it can be higher, e.g., 12 percent. As the elk live on high ground it is hard and expensive to dart, bleed, and then work out what to do when any are found positive.\n\nAnother complication is that at very low prevalences false positives rear their ugly and expensive heads. - Mod.MHJ\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/r/1rLN.]", "summary": "A ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n Communicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The ranch is located within the state's Designated Surveillance Area (DSA), a disease management area involving Beaverhead, Gallatin, Madison and Park counties, with management practices that include Official Calfhood Vaccination as required by DSA rules and a herd plan. \n\nThe state will not lose its Brucellosis Class Free Status, Zaluski said, as the US Department of Agriculture's [USDA] brucellosis program is currently operating under an interim rule that de-emphasizes class status and directs states to focus on surveillance.

We believe that the measures implemented, such as placing the farms under quarantine and restricting the movement of animals, will allow us to rapidly recover our status of brucellosis-free region,' he added.\n\nBovine brucellosis is a communicable disease of cattle. It leads to frequent miscarriage events when the disease strikes for the 1st time. It may also lead to the production of weak offspring, causing important economical losses, and it may also become a public health problem.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Maps of Chile may be found at http://www.ildado.com/genimg/chile-map5.jpg and http://healthmap.org/r/5u-x.\n\nBrucellosis, in cattle, water buffalo, and bison is caused almost exclusively by _Brucella abortus_; however, _B. suis_ or _B. melitensis_ are occasionally implicated in some cattle herds. _B. suis_ does not appear to be contagious from cow to cow. Infection spreads rapidly and causes many abortions in unvaccinated cattle. In a herd in which the disease is endemic, an infected cow typically aborts only once after exposure; subsequent gestations and lactations appear normal. After exposure, cattle become bacteremic for a short period and develop agglutinins and other antibodies; some resist infection and a small percentage of infected cows recover. A positive serum agglutination test usually precedes an abortion or a normal parturition but may be delayed in about 15 percent of cows. The incubation period may be variable and is inversely related to stage of gestation at time of exposure. Organisms are shed in milk and uterine discharges, and the cow may become temporarily infertile. Bacteria may be found in the uterus during pregnancy, uterine involution, and infrequently, for a prolonged time, in the non-gravid uterus. Shedding from the vagina largely disappears with the decrease of fluids following parturition. Some infected cows that previously aborted shed brucellae from the uterus at subsequent normal parturitions. Organisms are shed in milk for a variable length of time -- in most cattle for life.\n\nNatural transmission occurs by ingestion of organisms, which are present in large numbers in aborted fetuses, fetal membranes, and uterine discharges. Cattle may ingest contaminated feed and water, or lick contaminated genitals of other animals. Venereal transmission by infected bulls to susceptible cows appears to be rare. Transmission may occur by artificial insemination when brucella-contaminated semen is deposited in the uterus but, reportedly, not when deposited in the mid-cervix. Brucellae may enter the body through mucous membranes, conjunctivae, wounds, or intact skin.\n\nBrucellae have been recovered from fetuses and from manure that has remained in a cool environment for more than 2 months. Exposure to direct sunlight kills the organisms within a few hours.\n\nBecause organisms are shed in the milk, unpasteurized milk, and cheese represent a human health concern. Many individuals believe drinking unpasteurized milk is better for their health. Diseases that are not killed by pasteurization represent a risk to the consumer. Brucellosis in humans causes malaise, fever, chills, sweats, headache, neck pain, low back pain, joint pain, muscle pain, occasionally diarrhea, constipation, anorexia, weight loss, abdominal pain, weakness, irritability, insomnia, and depression. Brucellosis has been called undulating fever because of its habit of producing fever and signs that wax and wane over an extended period of time.\n\nPortions of this comment have been extracted from http://www.merckvetmanual.com/mvm/index.jsp?cfile=htm/bc/110502.htm&word=Brucellosis. - Mod.TG]", "summary": "\n\nFor his part, Mr Gerardo Otzen, Regional Director of SAG for the Magallanes Region, mentioned that 'given the importance of this disease and its economical consequences, the service has implemented emergency measures, establishing working teams dedicated primarily to investigating the route by which the disease was introduced into this region, which might have been by contact with or introduction of animals from Argentina, given that no cattle has entered the northern region of Chile during the past 10 years.'

In a herd in which the disease is endemic, an infected cow typically aborts only once after exposure; subsequent gestations and lactations appear normal.

The incubation period may be variable and is inversely related to stage of gestation at time of exposure. Organisms are shed in milk and uterine discharges, and the cow may become temporarily infertile. Bacteria may be found in the uterus during pregnancy, uterine involution, and infrequently, for a prolonged time, in the non-gravid uterus.

The disease is caused by various bacteria of the family Brucella, which [each] tend to infect a specific animal species. However, most species of Brucella are able to infect other animal species as well. The disease affects cattle, swine, sheep and goats, camels, equines, and dogs. It may also infect other ruminants, some marine mammals, and humans.\n\nThe disease in animals is characterized by abortions or reproductive failure. While animals typically recover and will be able to have live offspring following the initial abortion, they may continue to shed the bacteria.\n\nBrucellosis in cattle (_B. abortus_) in sheep and goats (_B. melitensis_) and in swine (_B. suis_) are diseases listed in the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) Terrestrial Animal Health Code and must be reported to the OIE (Terrestrial Animal Health Code).\n\nBrucellosis is a zoonosis highly infectious for humans causing a disease often called undulant fever or Malta fever, since it was 1st recognized in Malta during the 1850s http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Media_Center/docs/pdf/Disease_cards/BCLS-EN.pdf.\n\nQuantitative information obtained from the OIE's WAHID database shows that during 2012, 9586 outbreaks of brucellosis (_Brucella abortus_) were reported in the region of the Americas: Bolivia (44), Brazil (1188), Canada (1), Chile (32), Colombia (9), Costa Rica (201), Cuba (33), Dominican Republic (101), Ecuador (62), El Salvador (31), Guatemala (173), Honduras (49), Mexico (6994), Nicaragua (22), Panama (1), Paraguay (508), Peru (4) and Uruguay (131). This information is available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Diseaseinformation/statusdetail.\n\nIn the United States of America, 2 outbreaks were reported during 2012. The disease was limited to free-ranging bison (_Bison bison_) and wapiti (_Cervus elaphus_) in the Greater Yellowstone National Park area. http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Diseaseinformation/statuslist/note/id/249/disn/Brucellosis%2B%2528Brucella%2Babortus%2529.\n\nThe disease is also present in Argentina and Venezuela, but no quantitative data are available http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Diseaseinformation/statuslist.\n\nPanama is the southernmost country of Central America. The country is situated on the isthmus connecting North and South America and is bordered by Costa Rica to the west, Colombia to the southeast, the Caribbean Sea to the north, and the Pacific Ocean to the south. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panama. The country is divided into 9 provinces: Bocas del Toro, Chiriqui, Cocle, Colon, Darien, Herrera, Los Santos, Panama and Veraguas. Capira is a district of the province of Panama http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capira_District.\n\nFrom January 2006 to December 2012, Panama reported 59 outbreaks of brucellosis (_Brucella abortus_). These 59 outbreaks were located in 7 of the 9 provinces. The incidence of brucellosis during this 7-year period and the distribution by province is summarized as follows:\nProvinces /2006 / 2007 / 2008 / 2009 / 2010 / 2011 / 2012\nBocas del Toro / / / 4 / 3 / 4 / / /\nChiriqui / 2 / 6 / 2 / 3 / 2 / / /\nCocle / 1 / 1 / / / / / /\nColon / / 1 / / / / / /\nDarien / / 1 / / / / / /\nLos Santos / / / 1 / / / / /\nVeraguas / 4 / 15 / 19 / 11 / 6 / 3 / 1\n\nThis information and additional data on Panama's outbreaks can be found in the OIE's WAHID database at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Diseaseinformation/statusdetail.

But veterinary authorities say after a major effort, they expect to have the disease fully under control within the next 12 months.\n\nPresenter: Geraldine Coutts\n\nSpeaker: Dr Stephen Angus, Principal Veterinary Officer from the Department of Agriculture in Fiji\n\nAngus: First of all I'll give you a brief history of brucellosis in Fiji, there was a major campaign to eradicate brucellosis and tuberculosis in the 80s. Fiji was declared free of brucellosis on or about 1990. But unfortunately TB was never eradicated and brucellosis re-emerged in 2009. It started with an abortion storm in an area called Tailevu, which is one of the major dairying areas not far from Suva.\n\nCoutts: The link between TB and brucellosis? So, is it transmitted between people and cattle?\n\nAngus: The link, they're both zoonotic diseases affecting both animals and humans and they are of public health concern. The 2 diseases are not inextricably linked except through the dairying industry.\n\nCoutts: How contagious is it and, I guess the follow on from that, is it easily spread?\n\nAngus: Brucellosis and tuberculosis are easily spread, they're both bacterial diseases, they're both highly infectious, and if left unchecked you can get quite high morbidities.\n\nCoutts: Where exactly are the flashpoints, the points of most concern in Fiji at the moment?\n\nAngus: The concerns at the moment are that brucellosis is mainly in the dairy industry, the major dairying areas in the central region of Fiji.\n\nCoutts: Can the brucellosis itself in cattle be cured? Or if an animal gets it, does it necessarily mean it needs to be destroyed?\n\nAngus: Unfortunately that is so, there is no effective cure; once an animal is infected it generally is infected for life and unfortunately has to be destroyed.\n\nCoutts: And does that mean that if a cow in a herd gets it, the whole herd is contaminated?\n\nAngus: Absolutely not. We have had major success in the last year in cleaning out a number of herds of cattle of this infection.\n\nCoutts: The problem of not being able to contain it, how can that be explained?\n\nAngus: Hang on a second, I think someone's been misinforming you. Containing it is exactly what we've been doing in the last 12 months. Prior to that it was in an epidemic phase and the prevalence rose to approximately 3 per cent of the dairy herd in the central region. It is currently running at well under one per cent.\n\nCoutts: Well, why can't it be eradicated?\n\nAngus: It certainly can be eradicated and we are putting in major efforts to do so.\n\nCoutts: But it hasn't been because it's been evident in the country for some years now.\n\nAngus: It's been evident since 2009. As I explained there was an abortion storm and that was the re-emergence of brucellosis after an absence of nearly 20 years in Fiji.\n\nCoutts: So what happens from this point on?\n\nAngus: From this point on, we put in a major effort into controlling the infected herds. As I say we're having some considerable degree of success at the moment, and we expect to have the disease fully under control within the next 12 months.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Bovine brucellosis, a zoonotic bacterial disease, is usually caused by _Brucella abortus, less frequently by _B. melitensis_, and occasionally by _B. suis_. Infection is widespread globally. Several countries in Northern and Central Europe, Canada, Japan, Israel, Australia, and New Zealand are believed to be free from the agent.\n\nClinically, the disease is characterised by one or more of the following signs: abortion, retained placenta, orchitis, epididymitis and, rarely, arthritis, with excretion of the organisms in uterine discharges and in milk. Diagnosis depends on the isolation of _Brucella_ from abortion material, udder secretions, or from tissues removed at post-mortem. Presumptive diagnosis can be made by assessing specific cell-mediated or serological responses to _Brucella_ antigens.\n\n_Brucella abortus_, _B. melitensis_, and _B. suis_ are highly pathogenic for humans, and all infected tissues, cultures and potentially contaminated materials must be handled under appropriate containment conditions. Additional background is available in OIE's terrestrial Manual, at http://tinyurl.com/cvby6ao.\n\nAccording to Fiji's most recent available annual report to the OIE (2011), during that year 25 new outbreaks of bovine brucellosis (_B, abortus_) were recorded, including 250 'cases' among 6129 susceptible animals of which none were destroyed, while 63 were slaughtered. 116 bovine animals were 'routine vaccinated'; 259 were 'ring vaccinated'.\n\nThe cattle population in 2011 was 44 388 head in 792 establishments.\n\nAdditional information on the current control policy addressing bovine brucellosis in Fiji will be welcomed. - Mod.AS\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/r/1Cyn.]", "summary": "A ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Bovine brucellosis, a zoonotic bacterial disease, is usually caused by _Brucella abortus, less frequently by _B. melitensis_, and occasionally by _B. suis_.

It causes lumps and scars in the ram's testicle, which can block the flow of sperm. According to Senior District Vet Dan Salmon, many producers are unaware of the disease and the problems it can cause -- reduced fertility or infertility, lower lambing percentages, longer joining and lambing intervals, and consequent economic losses.\n\n'In the late 1990s, testing of all rams in the former Riverina RLPB district (Moulamein and Deniliquin) revealed that ovine brucellosis was present in one third of ram flocks,' he said.\n\n'There is no effective treatment for brucellosis and all producers are at risk. Infected rams spread the disease during joining through the ewe or off-season through sodomy.\n\n'Prevention is the key with this disease. Producers should only buy rams from an Ovine Brucellosis Accredited Stud and also regularly check rams.'\n\nProducers can easily check their own rams by feeling for abnormal lumps in the rams' testicles. 'This should be done twice a year, well in advance of joining and recently after the last joining. This will allow enough time for re-tests if they are needed,' Dr Salmon said.\n\n'Any lumps or bumps should be further investigated -- this involves contacting your vet who will organise blood testing. Your vet will also discuss the options available.\n\n'If you are unsure about the rams you have purchased, keep them separate from your home rams until you have them blood tested.\n\n'Also remember that rams often move freely across or through boundary fences, potentially picking up diseases and bringing them back to your property.'\n\nProducers wishing to establish a group to combat ovine brucellosis should contact their local LHPA for assistance.\n\nFurther information on ovine brucellosis, including the list of ovine brucellosis accredited flocks, is available at http://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/agriculture/livestock/sheep/health/ovine-brucellosis-scheme.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Brucella ovis_ produces a disease unique to sheep, in which epididymitis and orchitis impair fertility -- the principal economic effect. Occasionally, placentitis and abortion are seen, and there may be perinatal mortality. The disease was 1st described in New Zealand and Australia and has since been reported from many sheep-raising areas of the world.\n\nRams, as young as 8 weeks, have been infected experimentally by various nonvenereal routes. The disease can be transmitted among rams by direct contact. Active infection in ewes is unusual but has developed after mating with naturally infected rams. Contaminated pastures do not appear to be important in the spread of the disease. Infection frequently persists in rams, and a high percentage shed _B. ovis_ intermittently for several years.\n\nBecause not all infected rams show palpable abnormalities of scrotal tissues (and not all cases of epididymitis are due to brucellosis), the remaining rams must be examined further. Rams shedding organisms, but having no lesions, must be identified by culture of semen. Repeated examinations may be necessary to identify intermittent shedders. Microscopic examination of stained semen smears may also be helpful; fluorescent antibody examination is a highly specific diagnostic aid. Serologic tests used for eradication of disease and certification of animals include ELISA, complement fixation, hemagglutination inhibition, indirect agglutination, and gel diffusion.\n\nIncidence and spread of the disease may be reduced by regular examination of rams before the breeding season and culling of those with obvious genital abnormalities. Because susceptibility in rams increases markedly with age, it is advantageous to keep a young ram flock and isolate noninfected rams from older, possibly infected rams.\n\nImmunization of rams has been practiced extensively in New Zealand using 2 doses of killed _B. ovis_ cells in adjuvant. Because infection in ewes apparently originates almost exclusively from service by infected rams, lamb losses through infection of ewes may be controlled economically by restricting vaccination to rams.\n\nChlortetracycline and streptomycin used concurrently have affected bacteriologic cures. However, treatment is not economic except in especially valuable rams, and even if infection is eliminated, fertility may remain impaired.\n\nPortions of this comment have been extracted from http://www.merckvetmanual.com/mvm/index.jsp?cfile=htm/bc/110506.htm.\n\nNew South Wales, Australia may be found on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at http://healthmap.org/r/1oP3. - Mod.TG]", "summary": "Because susceptibility in rams increases markedly with age, it is advantageous to keep a young ram flock and isolate noninfected rams from older, possibly infected rams. \n\nProducers can easily check their own rams by feeling for abnormal lumps in the rams' testicles.

The provincial Ministry of Labor has ordered the suspension of activities in the municipal dog pound [animal shelter].\n\nASOEM director Eduardo Cabral said: 'Last week [week of 29 Oct 2012], we had confirmation of 2 new cases of brucellosis in municipal workers and are awaiting the results for other workers. We are talking of about 8 workers with brucellosis.'\n\nThe Administration and Records Secretary noted that this is an incurable disease and complained that in 2010, the union had already asked the Ministry of Labor to close the shelter and make the necessary renovations to keep the animals and the workers separate.

Subsequently, human infections were diagnosed, primarily in laboratory workers as well as dog owners. It was subsequently clearly shown by a group from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 1975 (2) that routine brucella agglutinin testing is not helpful for _B. canis_ infection in dogs or humans, and a more specific assay is now available (3).\n\nThe manifestations of _B. canis_ in humans can be minimal or can be an indolent bacteremia, as in this case. Complications of this infection can occur, including osteomyelitis, endocarditis, mycotic aneurysms, and granulomatous hepatitis (3).\n\n1. Carmichael LE, Bruner DW.

Urine from infected dogs is one of the main sources of infection to people.\n\nIn dogs, _B. canis_ is mainly transmitted by contact with the fetus and fetal membranes after abortions/stillbirths or by venereal transmission. This organism primarily enters the body by ingestion and through the genital, oronasal, and conjunctival mucosa, but transmission through broken skin may also be possible. In utero infections occur. Nursing puppies can be infected from milk, but the importance of this route is controversial. Other potential sources of infection include blood transfusions and contaminated syringes.\n\nDogs often become chronically infected with _B. canis_ and can shed this organism for prolonged periods. Although some dogs clear the infection after a year (generally with treatment), others remain bacteremic for 5 years and possibly longer.\n\n_B. canis_ can also be spread on fomites. In conditions of high humidity, low temperatures, and no sunlight, _Brucella_ spp. can remain viable for several months in water, aborted fetuses, feces, equipment, and clothing. _Brucella_ species can withstand drying, particularly when organic material is present, and can survive in dust and soil. Survival is longer when the temperature is low, particularly when it is below freezing.\n\nHumans usually become infected with _Brucella_ spp. by ingesting organisms or by the contamination of mucous membranes and abraded skin. Infection with _B. canis_ seems to require close contact with infected dogs or contact with bacterial cultures. _B. canis_ is zoonotic, but the virulence of this organism for humans may be low, although it may be higher than has been reported in the past. Under-reporting of this disease may skew the reporting statistics. Under-reporting may occur because the disease is difficult to diagnose, and many physicians do not have the disease on their zoonotic radar.\n\n_B. canis_ infections in humans resemble brucellosis caused by other _Brucella_ species. Some people infected with _Brucella_ remain asymptomatic, which is one reason for the difficulty in diagnosis and the resulting subsequent under-reporting. In symptomatic cases, brucellosis is extremely variable, and the clinical signs may appear insidiously or abruptly. Typically, this disease begins as an acute febrile illness with nonspecific flu-like signs such as fever, headache, malaise, back pain, myalgia, and generalized aches. Drenching sweats can occur, particularly at night. Oral lesions were reported in a child concurrently infected with _B. canis_ and cytomegalovirus and resolved with antibiotic treatment for brucellosis. Another patient with a _B. canis_ infection had fever of unknown origin.\n\nSome patients with brucellosis recover spontaneously, while others develop persistent symptoms that typically wax and wane. Occasionally seen complications include arthritis, spondylitis, chronic fatigue, and epididymo-orchitis. Neurologic signs (including personality changes, meningitis, uveitis, and optic neuritis), anemia, internal abscesses, nephritis, endocarditis, and dermatitis can also occur. Other organs and tissues can also be affected, resulting in a wide variety of syndromes. Treatment is with antibiotics; however, relapses can be seen months after the initial symptoms, even in successfully treated cases. The mortality rate is low; in untreated persons, estimates of the case fatality rate vary from less than 2 per cent to 5 per cent. Deaths are usually caused by endocarditis or meningitis.\n\nPortions of this comment have been extracted from http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/brucellosis_canis.pdf. - Mod.TG\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/r/1yJb.]", "summary": "A ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n BRUCELLOSIS, HUMAN, CANINE - ARGENTINA: (TIERRA DEL FUEGO), BRUCELLA CANIS, SHELTER WORKERS\n*******************************************************************************************\n \n\nASOEM director Eduardo Cabral said: 'Last week [week of 29 Oct 2012], we had confirmation of 2 new cases of brucellosis in municipal workers and are awaiting the results for other workers.

In the context of a bulk tank milk screening aimed at controlling this outbreak, a sample from a farm near Florennes (Province of Namur) was found ELISA positive by the local 1st-line laboratory (ARSIA). Subsequent individual serum testing of all (155) lactating animals of this herd identified a single 4-year old cow (born on the farm and not pregnant) that tested positive by ELISA and sero-agglutination. This animal displayed no clinical symptom of brucellosis and was slaughtered on 23 Apr 2012.\n\nBacteriological tests were conducted at the national reference laboratory (CERVA-CODA) on lymph nodes, spleen and uterus. The lymph nodes were found negative, but colonies of a _Brucella_ sp. were isolated from both the spleen and the uterus and were unexpectedly identified as _Brucella suis biovar 2_ (_B. suis bv2_) using both biochemical and molecular typing methods. A B. suis-specific real-time PCR test (Ref 1) turned positive on DNA extracted directly from the uterus, ruling out a possible cross-contamination in the laboratory. Molecular typing of this cow isolate demonstrated a genetic profile highly related to the profile of _B. suis bv2_ strains normally retrieved from wild boars in Belgium. None of the other animals in the herd was found positive for Brucella.\n\nAuthorities have ordered a one-month hunting campaign in the surroundings of Florennes [which] started on 19 May 2012 with the aim of reducing urgently the local wild boar population while providing an opportunity to investigate _B. suis_ carriage in these animals. A key issue will be achieved by comparing the genetic profile of the cow isolate to that of the local wild boar strains, if those turn out to be carriers of _B. suis bv2_.\n\nWild boars and hares are known to be infected by _B. suis bv 2_ in many European countries. A case of cattle infection by _B. suis bv2_ probably transmitted from an infected wild hare was reported in Denmark in 1995 (Ref 2). In the present case, contaminated wild boars are the most probable source of infection. The wild boar population of the Walloon region in Belgium is known to be steadily increasing since the last 2 decades, with a concomitant risk of introducing swine brucellosis in pig farms, especially when pigs are raised outdoors. However, the way _B. suis bv2_ can be passed from wild boars to cattle as reported here remains elusive.\n\nContaminated viscera from a hunted animal or aborted material left over in a pasture are possible contamination sources. It should be reminded that harvested viscera and carcasses of wild boars shot dead by hunters represent a potential contamination risk for susceptible animals and [should] not be left over in the natural environment, especially in the vicinity of pastures or farming areas.\n\nReferences\n1.

The isolated strain was identified as _Brucella melitensis_ biovar 3. The patient had presented in late November 2011 with non-specific symptoms that had been ongoing since that date. Usual at-risk exposures were investigated: recent or ancient travel in an endemic/enzootic country, consumption of raw milk or raw milk products imported from an enzootic country, professional or accidental exposure to _Brucella_ strains in a laboratory, direct contact with animals, etc. As the patient had not had such an exposure at any point before, the case was considered to be an autochthonous case of acute brucellosis of undetermined origin.\n\nIn April 2012, brucellosis was confirmed in a dairy cow in a herd of the same district of the French Alps. The seropositive cow had aborted in late January 2012, and a strain of _Brucella melitensis_ biovar 3 was isolated from the milk sampled from the animal. The animal belonged to a herd 21 dairy cows, and no other animal in the herd presented with symptoms suggesting brucellosis or showed any serological reaction. Approximately 20 kg of Reblochon cheese (soft raw milk cheese) are usually produced daily on the affected farm.\n\nBrucellosis surveillance in France\n----------------------------------\nFrance has been officially free of brucellosis in cattle since 2005, and the last outbreak of brucellosis in sheep and goats was reported in 2003. In order to detect and prevent any re-emergence of the disease, annual screening using Rose Bengal test or complement fixation test is carried out in all cattle, sheep and goat farms producing raw milk as well as in all cattle herds, and every 1-3 years in small ruminant, according to EU regulations (1-4). Moreover, abortion in ruminants is mandatorily notifiable, and the investigation of abortion includes examination for brucellosis.\n\nHuman brucellosis in France is mandatorily notifiable. The National Reference Centre (NRC) determines the characteristics of _Brucella_ strains isolated from patients (5,6). Serological suspicions also have to be confirmed by the NRC, as the low specificity of available tests can be responsible for false-positive results. The confirmation is carried out using a combination of in-house tests including Rose Bengal test, immunoassay, complement fixation test, and specific detection of antibodies against _Yersinia enterocolitica_.\n\nVeterinary investigation\n------------------------\nAll animals were tested serologically (Rose Bengal test, complement fixation test and indirect enzyme linked immunosorbent assay) before slaughter in April 2012 (5). Following French regulations, all animals in the infected herd were immediately slaughtered, and 3 pairs of lymph nodes (retropharyngeal, retromammary and internal iliac) were sampled from all animals for _Brucella_ culture (5) and PCR (7). All animals were seronegative with the exception of the index animal which showed a very strong reaction in all 3 tests. However, _Brucella_ was isolated from a 2nd animal in the herd, and PCR-positive results were obtained for 4 further animals, in addition to the index animal and the 2nd cow with an isolation of _Brucella_.\n\nFollowing the confirmation of brucellosis in the cow, a trace-back investigation was implemented by the veterinary services to determine the origin of the contamination of the herd. The animals of the infected herd had not taken part in a transhumance nor did they graze with other herds on the same pastures. Other neighboring farms as well as farms that had traded animals with the infected farm in the year before the outbreak were investigated. All tested negative in serology (5).\n\nA trace-forward investigation was also carried out to determine the places of distribution of cheese produced at the affected farm since the abortion of the cow.\n\nReblochon cheese is a raw milk soft cheese, requiring a maturation period of 3 weeks to one month. The cheese from the affected farm had been commercialized after the abortion in 7 districts. Cheese was sold directly at the farm, and as whole pieces or in parts in supermarkets. Cheese produced by the affected farm had not been exported to other countries but might have been bought by foreign tourists during their winter holidays in several ski resorts in the area. For this reason, the European rapid alert system for food and feed (RASFF) was informed.\n\nHuman investigations\n--------------------\nAfter the identification of the 1st bovine case, the human case was interviewed again to investigate any direct or indirect epidemiological link with the infected herd. During the 2nd interview, it became clear that the patient and their family had visited the infected farm in autumn 2011, although it was not possible to determine the exact date. During this visit, the family had bought Tome Blanche cheese, a fresh cheese obtained during the 1st step of Reblochon production. The 4 family members had shared the Tome Blanche on the same day, but the index case was the only one who later presented with symptoms. The other 3 family members were serologically investigated in May 2012 and only one had a positive high agglutination titer. The farm reported no other visitors during that period, apart from neighbors.\n\nMicrobiological investigations\n------------------------------\nThe strain isolated from the human case and from the 2 cows both belonged to _Brucella melitensis_ biovar 3. The strains had the same genotype as determined by multilocus variable number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA) (8).\n\nControl measures\n----------------\nAll cheese pieces produced by the affected farm and still within the shelf life were withdrawn from retailers. In addition, a recall of already sold products was carried out via a national press release by the cheese producer and by posters in the sale points. Medical doctors in the concerned districts were informed by the regional health authorities. Consumers of these products were advised to seek medical attention should they present symptoms consistent with brucellosis.\n\nThe release of cheese from the affected farm was immediately stopped. The movements of animals from other herds that had epidemiological links with the infected herd (those that were geographically close to the infected herd, or had been bought from the infected herd) have been restricted until the end of the investigation. Furthermore, raw cheese products from farms with epidemiological links to the infected farm were put on sale only after negative bacteriological tests results had been obtained.\n\nReinforcement of human surveillance\n-----------------------------------\nNotification of human brucellosis is mandatory in France. All notified human cases in France have to be confirmed by the national reference laboratory. From 2002 to 2011, 219 human cases were confirmed in France. Among them, 183 (84 percent) were patients infected through the consumption of raw milk products or direct contact with animals in (or from) countries with enzootic brucellosis; 14 (6 percent) were laboratory workers infected through the handling of _Brucella_ strains; 17 (8 percent) were relapses in people with past infection, while the origin of contamination could not be determined for 5 patients (2 percent) (9).\n\nBecause the investigation of the origin of the human case diagnosed in January 2012 had been inconclusive, it was decided to reinforce the surveillance immediately. Since January 2012, all notified suspected cases have been interviewed with a trawling questionnaire before the diagnosis was confirmed. Since April 2012, any epidemiological link with the infected herd has been systematically investigated. No other related human cases have been identified so far.\n\nDiscussion\n----------\nAt this time, several hypotheses can be proposed to explain the re-emergence of brucellosis in cattle in France. One explanation is contact with infected cattle or small ruminants. Knowing that the affected herd had not received any imported animals, it needs to be investigated whether animals had been introduced in one of the herds that sold animals to the affected farm or whether the affected herd had been in contact with animals of neighboring farms. Another hypothesis would be a contamination of cattle by wildlife. Some chamois (_Rupicapra rupicapra_) were found infected with _B. melitensis_ biovar 3 in 1988 in the Alps, and some of these animals may have become chronically infected and not display symptoms (10). However, no infected chamois has been identified in the last 10 years, despite several serological surveys (Garin-Bastuji, personal communication, July 2012). _B. melitensis_ biovar 3 is the most common biovar isolated in ruminants worldwide, and therefore the identification of this biovar in a district like the French Alps with many different ruminant species cannot contribute to a more precise hypothesis.\n\nThe veterinary investigations are still ongoing to determine the origin of the contamination of the herd, to investigate the possible spread of the infection to other herds and to take control measures to avoid the infection of new herds and consequently the occurrence of additional human cases.\n\nHowever, the absence of infected animals in the herds that are epidemiologically linked with the infected herd, and the absence of other autochthonous human cases argue in favor of a single outbreak and a limited episode. The index animal on the farm was born from a dam that itself was born in 1999 before the last outbreak in the area and died in 2006. The lifetime of the mother of the index infected animal is therefore consistent with the hypothesis of a congenital case of bovine brucellosis (11).\n\nIn addition to the investigations already carried out, all herds coming back from transhumance [the seasonal movement of people with their livestock between fixed summer and winter pastures - Mod.LL] in the concerned district will be serologically screened during the fall. Serological tests lack specificity, but they have a good sensitivity and are of good value to detect recent or active infections. The index animal had an active infection demonstrated by _Brucella_ excretion in milk. This animal displayed a high level of antibodies in relation with the active although possibly chronic infection. During the early investigation, a _Brucella_ strain and _Brucella_ DNA were detected in ganglions of seronegative animals, demonstrating chronic latent infections, with no antibodies. Strengthened surveillance of human and animal brucellosis will be maintained until the end of the investigations.\n\nThe surveillance of human brucellosis in nonendemic countries is complicated by the lack of specificity of serological tests (12-16). In our experience, all available tests still may cross-react with other bacteria (mainly _Y. enterocolitica_, but not only), and can also give false positive results in patients presenting with immune disorders. In countries with low prevalence and incidence of the disease, this low specificity contributes to the low positive predictive value of serology. A positive diagnosis has important consequences for the patients (long antimicrobial therapy with possible adverse effects and ecological consequences on intestinal bacteria), and for the dairy animals (culling of the entire herd in our country). It is therefore important to obtain as much evidence as possible to confirm a serological diagnosis.\n\nReferences\n----------\n1.

Osteoarticular complications were the most frequent, totaling 113 cases (66 percent), followed by genitourinary with 18 cases (5.1 percent of males), hepatic (2.5 percent), neurologic (1.7 percent), and heart (1.5 percent). Nine patients (1.7 percent) had more than one complication. In a multivariate analysis, diagnostic delay greater than 30 days, ESR greater than 40 mm/hr, and levels of alpha-2 globulin greater than 7.5 g/L were statistically significant independent variables associated with the presence of focal forms.\n\n25 patients with complications (14.8 percent) required surgical treatment. The relapse rate was 3.6 percent for those patients without complications and 4.1 percent for patients with focal forms (p greater than 0.05). However, when therapeutic failure, relapses, and mortality were considered together, the risk of an unfavorable evolution was significantly greater in patients with focal forms (10.6 percent versus 3.6 percent in patients without complications; p less than 0.005).

Generally, the penetration of _B. melitensis_ into cattle farms is regarded as a spin-off from infected flocks of sheep and goats. Cattle infections are, in most cases, not associated with abortion storms. As observed in Israel, where -- similarly to Spain -- several dairy cattle farms got infected in previous years, the eradication of _B. melitensis_ from dairy cattle involved additional concerns in comparison to the eradication of _B. abortus_. Humans easily contract _B. melitensis_ due to the extremely low inoculum dose required. Since the bacteria are excreted in the milk, which in the cow are produced in large quantities, the requirement to remove the udder and internal organs from slaughtered cows would necessarily lead to exposure of the abattoir personnel to huge amounts of the organisms. Therefore, in Israel, it was recommended to dry-off suspected cows prior to sending them to slaughter. - Mod.AS]\n\n[A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/r/1oxc.]", "summary": "Among them, 183 (84 percent) were patients infected through the consumption of raw milk products or direct contact with animals in (or from) countries with enzootic brucellosis; 14 (6 percent) were laboratory workers infected through the handling of _Brucella_ strains; 17 (8 percent) were relapses in people with past infection, while the origin of contamination could not be determined for 5 patients (2 percent) (9).

Sometimes, the bacteria cause severe infections of the brain, bone, heart, liver or spleen, the CDC says.\n\nAfter the carcass of the porpoise was recovered on 29 January 2012, a university faculty member, 2 students and a community volunteer performed a necropsy on the animal. Although the team members wore gloves, they did not wear any protection over their noses and mouths to prevent themselves from breathing in the bacteria. (_Brucella_ can become airborne during a necropsy.)\n\nSubsequent lab testing on samples from the porpoise revealed it was infected with _Brucella_.\n\nBecause the 4 people who performed the necropsy did not wear respiratory protection, they were considered at high risk for _Brucella_ infection, and were required to take antibiotics for 3 weeks, check themselves daily for fevers, and undergo weekly blood tests performed by CDC personnel. After 24 weeks, none of the individuals had become ill (signs of the disease can show up months after a person becomes infected).\n\n'Persons who handle marine mammals should be educated on the potential for infection associated with their activities and the precautions necessary to avoid being exposed to infectious agents,' the CDC researchers wrote. 'Failure to use primary protection to avoid exposure necessitates using more costly and time-consuming secondary strategies.'\n\nFacilities that allow students and volunteers to participate in the rescue and handling of marine mammals should provide the same level of training and protection for this population as they do for their employees, the CDC said. _Brucella_ is not common in the United States, but is endemic in many parts of the world, according to the CDC. It is found in animals, including cattle, swine, goats and sheep. Between 2000 and 2009, an average of 113 cases of brucellosis a year, the disease caused by _Brucella_, were reported to the CDC.\n\nThe new report will be published tomorrow (June 29) in the CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Week's Report.\n\nPass it on: Marine mammals can harbor infectious diseases, and people who rescue or handle them should use proper protection.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nPromed Mail from Health map alerts\n\n\n\n[_Brucella_ infections have recently been recognized in seals, sea lions, walruses, dolphins, porpoises, whales and an otter. This organism appears to be widespread in marine mammals, and has probably been endemic in these populations for a long time. The clinical significance is uncertain. A few infections have been associated with placentitis/abortions, neonatal mortality, meningoencephalitis, abscesses or other syndromes, but _Brucella_ has also been isolated from normal tissues and asymptomatic animals. There are concerns that brucellosis might affect reproduction or echolocation, particularly in threatened species or naive populations.\n\nMarine mammal isolates of _Brucella_ can infect terrestrial mammals, but the frequency of this event is unknown. Some polar bears, which feed on marine mammals, are seropositive for _Brucella_, and there are concerns about possible impacts on this species. Experimental infections in cattle and sheep have been described. Rare human infections have also been documented. One marine mammal isolate caused acute brucellosis in a researcher. Three other infected people had no occupational exposure to marine mammals; two individuals had neurological signs, and the third developed spinal osteomyelitis.\n\nMarine mammal _Brucella_ isolates are genetically distinct from terrestrial species, and if the traditional naming system is continued, they are expected to receive species names. _B. maris_ was originally suggested for all marine mammal strains of __Brucella__, with division into 2 or more biovars based on host specificity. (Biovar 1 would contain seal and otter isolates, and biovar 2 would contain cetacean isolates.) A more recent proposal suggests division into at least 2 species: _B. pinnipediae_ for strains from pinnipeds (seals, sea lions and walruses) and _B. cetaceae_ for isolates from cetaceans (whales, porpoises and dolphins). Another scheme suggests a division into 3 distinct groups comprised of isolates from seals, porpoises and dolphins.\n\nCurrently, there is little or no information about the significance of infection in each species. _Brucella_ has been found in asymptomatic animals, stranded or dead animals with lesions and, rarely, animals that are ill. _Brucella_ may be endemic in populations that have a high seroprevalence, such as hooded seals and dusky dolphins, and an incidental infection in other species.\n\nTerrestrial species can be infected with marine mammal isolates, probably as incidental hosts. Antibodies to _Brucella_ have been found in polar bears; these antibodies are thought to result from exposure to infected seals and other prey. Experimental infections with marine mammal isolates have been described in cattle, sheep and guinea pigs, and unpublished experiments suggest that piglets can be infected transiently. Symptomatic infections have also been described in humans.\n\nTransmission of _Brucella_ is poorly understood in marine mammals, with little direct evidence to support any route of infection. Terrestrial species of _Brucella_ are often transmitted by exposure to the infected placenta, birth fluids and vaginal secretions, and by venereal spread. These routes may also occur in marine mammals; _Brucella_ has been isolated from the reproductive organs of cetaceans. Transmission in milk or in utero may be possible. The survival of marine isolates in the environment has not been studied; however, terrestrial species of _Brucella_ can remain viable for several months in water and on some fomites, particularly when the temperature is low.\n\nThe frequency and route of transmission to humans and other terrestrial mammals is unknown. Predation on infected seals has been suggested as a possible route of exposure for polar bears. Cattle have been infected experimentally by intravenous injection, and cattle and sheep by intraconjunctival inoculation. One human infection occurred after exposure in the laboratory, but the source of 3 other infections is unknown. Humans usually become infected with terrestrial species of _Brucella_ by ingesting organisms in food, or by the contamination of mucous membranes and abraded skin.\n\nNo clinical syndrome has been established for brucellosis in marine mammals. Limited evidence suggests that this organism can be considered in abortions, orchitis, epididymitis, abscesses, meningitis/meningoencephalitis and systemic disease. _Brucella_ has been found in apparently normal as well as symptomatic animals.\n\nIn dolphins with meningitis, the differential diagnosis includes parasitism (_Nasitrema_ sp.), staphylococcal infection, and herpesvirus and morbillivirus infections. Other diseases causing abortions, orchitis, epididymitis, abscesses and systemic disease should be considered in marine mammals with these syndromes and evidence of _Brucella_ infection.\n\nHumans have been infected with marine mammal isolates of _Brucella_; samples should be collected and handled with all appropriate precautions.\n\n_Brucella_ has been isolated from all major body tissues in marine mammals. In particular, this organism has been found in the male and female reproductive organs, mammary gland, abscesses, lung and a variety of lymph nodes. Oral, nasal, tracheal, vaginal and anal swabs, as well as feces, can be submitted for culture from live animals. Serum should also be collected for serology. At necropsy, samples should be collected from all tissues with gross lesions. Other samples may also be taken; _Brucella_ has been isolated from tissues with microscopic but no gross lesions, as well as tissues without lesions. Blood cultures collected from the heart are occasionally successful at necropsy.\n\nZoonotic infections with marine mammal strains may be similar to infections with terrestrial strains. In humans, most species of _Brucella_ cause similar syndromes. Infections can be either asymptomatic or symptomatic. In symptomatic cases, the disease is extremely variable and the clinical signs may appear insidiously or abruptly. Typically, human brucellosis begins as an acute febrile illness with nonspecific flu-like signs such as fever, headache, malaise, back pain, myalgia and generalized aches. Drenching sweats can occur, particularly at night. Some patients recover spontaneously, while others develop persistent symptoms that typically wax and wane. Occasionally seen complications include arthritis, spondylitis, chronic fatigue, and epididymo-orchitis. Neurologic signs (including personality changes, meningitis, uveitis and optic neuritis), anemia, internal abscesses, nephritis, endocarditis and dermatitis can also occur. Neurological signs usually occur in less than 5% of patients. Other organs and tissues can also be affected, resulting in a wide variety of syndromes. Treatment is with antibiotics; however, relapses can be seen months after the initial symptoms, even in successfully treated cases. The mortality rate is low; in untreated persons, estimates of the case fatality rate vary from less than 2 percent to 5 percent. Deaths are usually caused by endocarditis or meningitis.\n\nPortions of this comment have been extracted from: http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/brucellosis_marine.pdf The entire article from the factsheet is well worth the reading. - Mod.TG\n\n\n\n]", "summary": "Failure to use primary protection to avoid exposure necessitates using more costly and time-consuming secondary strategies.'\n\nFacilities that allow students and volunteers to participate in the rescue and handling of marine mammals should provide the same level of training and protection for this population as they do for their employees, the CDC said. \n\nThe case serves as a reminder of the potential for infection when rescuing or handling marine mammals, and the importance of using proper protection to avoid exposure to diseases, the researchers said in their report. \n\nMarine mammal _Brucella_ isolates are genetically distinct from terrestrial species, and if the traditional naming system is continued, they are expected to receive species names. \n\nTerrestrial species can be infected with marine mammal isolates, probably as incidental hosts. \n\nZoonotic infections with marine mammal strains may be similar to infections with terrestrial strains. \n\n'Persons who handle marine mammals should be educated on the potential for infection associated with their activities and the precautions necessary to avoid being exposed to infectious agents,' the CDC researchers wrote.

Background\n-------------\nBrucellosis is frequently reported among wild boar populations in Europe. The aim of the study was to assess the epidemiological situation in Belgium, regarding the steady increase of wild boar populations over the last decades. Several serological tests were used and compared with culture and IS711 polymerase chain reaction (PCR), to determine the most suitable combination of diagnostic tools for conducting a successful prevalence study in wildlife.\n\n2. Results\n----------\nAn indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (iELISA) was used on 1168 sera from hunter-killed wild boar sampled between 2003 and 2007 in 4 natural regions of southern Belgium. Results gave an apparent prevalence of 54.88 percent (95 percent CI 52.03-57.73). Prevalence was significantly affected by age and by the year of study, but not by sex nor by the region of sampling. The relative sensitivities of the complement fixation test (CFT), the Rose Bengal test (RBT), and the slow agglutination test (SAT) versus the iELISA differed widely between tests, reaching 62.67, 46.68, and 34.77 percent, respectively. The relative specificities of the CFT, RBT and SAT versus the iELISA were respectively 99.01, 92.49, and 99.1 percent. From seropositive animals (iELISA), 9 percent were positive by culture and 24 percent by PCR when testing spleen and/or tonsils. Sensitivity of the PCR was higher on tonsils than on spleen. All bacterial isolates were identified as Brucella suis biovar 2.\n\n3. Conclusions\n--------------\nBrucellosis is widespread among wild boar in southern Belgium, with seroprevalences having increased over 10 years, and constitutes a growing risk of spill back to outdoor-farmed pig herds. The iELISA showed a better sensitivity than the CFT, RBT and SAT. Serological tests must be associated with direct diagnosis and PCR proved more sensitive than culture under wildlife sampling conditions. Spleen and tonsils are lymphoid tissues usually sampled in multi-disease monitoring programs. They remain top-grade organs for direct diagnosis of brucellosis, with a preference for tonsils.\n\nThe complete article is available as a provisional PDF.

In general, the geographical distribution of biovar 2 has historically been in a broad range between Scandinavia and the Balkans. The prevalence in wild boars appears to be high throughout continental Europe. In recent outbreaks in Europe, wild boars have been implicated as the source of transmission of biovar 2 to outdoor reared pigs; in rare cases, such as the one recently described in Belgium (see 20120520.1139015), other domestic animals, such as bovines, may get infected.\n\nIn addition to wild boars, the European hare (_Lepus capensis_) is also considered as a reservoir for _B. suis_ biovar 2 and has been implicated as a possible source of transmission to domestic livestock. _Brucella suis_ biovar 2 causes miliary lesions, particularly reproductive tissues, that often become purulent. To date, biovar 2 has rarely been reported as the cause of human brucellosis. However, biovar 2 infection has been reported in 2 immuno-compromised hunters, who had been extensively exposed through gutting or skinning boars or hares.\n\nThe above information is mainly derived from chapter 2. 8. 5 of OIE's Manual of Diagnostic Tests and Vaccines for Terrestrial Animals, where additional information can be found; available at http://tinyurl.com/7t8syh4. - Mod.AS\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/r/1zJs.]", "summary": "A ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n [Authors: Fabien Gregoire, Benedicte Mousset, David Hanrez, Charles Michaux, Karl Walravens and Annick Linden (e-mail addresses and affiliations, at the source URL)]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nSabine Zentis\n Castleview English Longhorns\nGut Laach\nD-52385 Nideggen, Germany\nhttp://www.cvlonghorns.de\n\n SEROVAR 2, WILD BOAR\n****************************************************\n \n\nBrucellosis caused by _B. suis_ biovar 2 differs from infection caused by biovars 1 and 3 in its host range, its distribution, and in its pathology. --------------\nBrucellosis is widespread among wild boar in southern Belgium, with seroprevalences having increased over 10 years, and constitutes a growing risk of spill back to outdoor-farmed pig herds.

Subsequently, human infections were diagnosed, primarily in laboratory workers as well as dog owners. It was subsequently clearly shown by a group from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 1975 (2) that routine brucella agglutinin testing is not helpful for _B. canis_ infection in dogs or humans and a more specific assay is now available (3).\n\nThe manifestations of _B. canis_ in humans can be minimal or can be an indolent bacteremia, as in this case. Complications of this infection can occur including osteomyelitis, endocarditis, mycotic aneurysms and granulomatous hepatitis (3).\n\n1. Carmichael LE, Bruner DW.

Urine from infected dogs is one of the main sources of infection to people.\n\nIn dogs, _B. canis_ is mainly transmitted by contact with the fetus and fetal membranes after abortions/stillbirths, or by venereal transmission. This organism primarily enters the body by ingestion and through the genital, oronasal, and conjunctival mucosa, but transmission through broken skin may also be possible. In utero infections occur. Nursing puppies can be infected from milk, but the importance of this route is controversial. Other potential sources of infection include blood transfusions and contaminated syringes.\n\nDogs often become chronically infected with _B. canis_ and can shed this organism for prolonged periods. Although some dogs clear the infection after a year (generally with treatment), others remain bacteremic for 5 years and possibly longer.\n\n_B. canis_ can also be spread on fomites. In conditions of high humidity, low temperatures, and no sunlight, _Brucella_ spp. can remain viable for several months in water, aborted fetuses, feces, equipment, and clothing. _Brucella_ species can withstand drying, particularly when organic material is present, and can survive in dust and soil. Survival is longer when the temperature is low, particularly when it is below freezing.\n\nHumans usually become infected with _Brucella_ spp. by ingesting organisms or by the contamination of mucous membranes and abraded skin. Infection with _B. canis_ seems to require close contact with infected dogs or contact with bacterial cultures. _B. canis_ is zoonotic, but the virulence of this organism for humans may be low, although it may be higher than has been reported in the past. Under-reporting of this disease may skew the reporting statistics. Under-reporting may occur because the disease is difficult to diagnose, and many physicians do not have the disease on their zoonotic radar.\n\n_B. canis_ infections in humans resemble brucellosis caused by other _Brucella_ species. Some people infected with _Brucella_ remain asymptomatic, which is one reason for the difficulty in diagnosis and the resulting subsequent under-reporting. In symptomatic cases, brucellosis is extremely variable and the clinical signs may appear insidiously or abruptly. Typically, this disease begins as an acute febrile illness with nonspecific flu-like signs such as fever, headache, malaise, back pain, myalgia, and generalized aches. Drenching sweats can occur, particularly at night. Oral lesions were reported in a child concurrently infected with _B. canis_ and cytomegalovirus, and resolved with antibiotic treatment for brucellosis. Another patient with a _B. canis_ infection had fever of unknown origin. Some patients with brucellosis recover spontaneously, while others develop persistent symptoms that typically wax and wane. Occasionally seen complications include arthritis, spondylitis, chronic fatigue, and epididymo-orchitis. Neurologic signs (including personality changes, meningitis, uveitis, and optic neuritis), anemia, internal abscesses, nephritis, endocarditis, and dermatitis can also occur. Other organs and tissues can also be affected, resulting in a wide variety of syndromes. Treatment is with antibiotics; however, relapses can be seen months after the initial symptoms, even in successfully treated cases. The mortality rate is low; in untreated persons, estimates of the case fatality rate vary from less than 2 per cent to 5 per cent. Deaths are usually caused by endocarditis or meningitis.\n\nPortions of this comment have been extracted from http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/brucellosis_canis.pdf. - Mod.TG\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/r/1nEs, http://healthmap.org/r/1nEs.]", "summary": "A follow up blood culture was obtained, which also became positive for the same appearing Gram negative bacillus, after which she was readmitted, and another blood culture also revealed the same small, unencapsulated Gram negative coccobacillus that grew aerobically, was catalase-positive and identified by the New York City Department of Health and Human Services as _Brucella canis_.\n\n A ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n \n\nDogs often become chronically infected with _B. canis_ and can shed this organism for prolonged periods.

The farm has been declared infected and all cattle in the herd will be slaughtered as soon as possible. Additional analyzes will be conducted in the infected herd to assess the extent of infection.\n\nTo date, a total of 39 farms which may be epidemiologically linked to the infected farm are subject to special investigations.

Over the following months he developed various symptoms such as fever, profuse sweating, chills, abdominal pain, and weight loss. He was admitted to the Hospital Dr Hernan Enriquez Aravena, Temuco after the diagnosis of brucellosis was made.\n\nDr Claudio Armstrong, deputy health authority, detailed that the affected man 'is an employee of a meat processing plant in the region. The bacterial strain _Brucella abortus_ (a bacterium transmitted mainly from cattle) was isolated by the ISP so we have the definitive diagnosis and the infection was most likely acquired within the meat processing plant.'\n\nThis is the 2nd case detected in the region in 5 years.

Researchers found that about 9 percent of feral pigs studied in Johnston County and less than one percent surveyed randomly at 13 other sites across the state showed exposure to _B. suis_.\n\nSuzanne Kennedy-Stoskopf, a North Carolina State research professor of wildlife infectious diseases, says that testing positive for antibodies to _B. suis_ means the feral pigs have been exposed to and mounted an immune response against the bacteria. Antibodies do not eliminate _B. suis_ from pigs, so the animals are considered infected and capable of transmitting the bacteria to other pigs and people. The United States has long had a swine brucellosis control and eradication program, which by the late 1990s eliminated the disease from all commercial pig populations.\n\nFor the domestic swine herd, the risk is that the bacteria can spread beyond feral hogs and cause abortions in affected swine. Kennedy-Stoskopf says that _B.suis_ can be transmitted when pigs ingest infected tissue or fluids. Also, direct contact with infected pigs or ingestion of contaminated food and water could cause currently uninfected pig populations to become infected.\n\nBiosecurity protocols in place to prevent herd exposure to other pathogens are important in preventing the spread of _B.suis_ into a domestic herd. 'Spillover from infected feral pigs to commercial pigs is an economic and a public-health concern,' Kennedy-Stoskopf said. 'The biggest public-health risk is to pork processors and hunters who field dress feral pigs.'\n\nThe study's co-author, Chris DePerno, associate professor of forestry and environmental resources at North Carolina State, points out the bacteria are transmitted to humans by unsafe butchering and consumption of undercooked meat. 'Now that exposure to _B. suis_ has been found in North Carolina's feral pig populations, people need to take care when hunting, butchering and cooking feral pigs,' he said. 'That means wearing gloves when field dressing feral pigs and cooking the meat to the proper temperature.'\n\nKennedy-Stoskopf emphasizes that although cases of brucellosis are rare in the United States, people need to understand the clinical signs, which mimic the flu and feature intermittent fevers and persistent headaches. 'Because clinical signs are so non-specific, it's important to tell your physician if you have had any exposure to feral swine carcasses and meat,' she added.\n\nFeral pig populations are exploding across the country, and are in nearly every state. Efforts to control them often meet with controversy. 'Control of feral pig populations is difficult at best,' DePerno says. 'Research indicates that about 70 percent of the population will need to be removed each year to keep a wild population stable. Regarding feral pigs, hunting usually removes from 8-50 percent of a given wild population.'\n\nDePerno hopes that more research on how far feral pigs travel -- and increased scrutiny of hunters who move feral pigs from place to place -- will help keep feral populations from spreading.\n\nThe North Carolina State research is published in Journal of Wildlife Diseases.\n\n[Byline: Marlys Miller]\n\n---\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The article referred to can be found at http://www.jwildlifedis.org/content/48/2/462.abstract?sid=1258a59a-28d4-4c99-b9bc-a33c02853735.\n\nThe rapid growth of the feral swine population in the USA raises concern and entails health risks for humans, domestic animals and the whole ecosystem. _Brucella suis_ is a pathogen that can be transmitted to humans, and spillover into the domestic swine population can adversely impact profits.

The aetiologic agent is a Gram negative, facultative intracellular bacterium of the genus _Brucella_. In marine mammals, it is an emerging infectious disease. From the 1990s onward, previously unknown strains of _Brucella_ were detected in free-ranging pinnipeds and cetaceans from the around the world. Brucellae isolated from cetaceans constitute 2 species with different preferred hosts, that is, _B. phocoenidae_ in porpoises and _B. delphini_ in dolphins.\n\nPathogenic findings associated with brucellosis in cetaceans include placentitis, orchitis, abortion, mastitis, pneumonia, subcutaneous lesions, arthritis, non-suppurative meningoencephalitis, and encephalitis. Brucella-induced neurologic disorders may lead to strandings. The role of environmental factors in the emergence of marine mammal brucellosis is unknown.\n\nBrucellosis is a zoonotic disease.

He said a reproductive disease called brucellosis infected the island herd in 2000 and as a result, pregnancy rates have dropped to about 30 per cent from 80 per cent.\n\nNow social media like Facebook and cheap shipping rates from the airlines for country food are helping people in communities like Iqaluit where caribou is scarce, order meat from Coral Harbour hunters, putting more stress on the herd.\n\nThe herd on Southampton Island was hunted to extinction in the 1950s, and was re-established when 50 animals were transplanted there in 1968.\n\n'They've gone down from a high of 30 000 in 1997 to what we surveyed this last June [2011] which was about 7500 animals,' said Campbell.\n\nCampbell said more than 1500 caribou had been exported this winter [2011-2012], which is higher than the birth rate, and that is only halfway through the season.\n\n'We believe that if this isn't stopped, this is an unsustainable harvest and probably will cause the population to be devastated within the next 3 years or so,' he said. 'One of the only ways that we will be able to control the harvest is by applying a total allowable harvest.'\n\nCampbell said efforts to meet with the Coral Harbour Hunters and Trappers Organization have been unsuccessful.\n\nNo one from the organization was available to speak with CBC.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[In cattle, bison, and buffalo, and in all caribou (_Rangifer tarandus_, a cervid), brucellosis is mainly caused by _Brucella abortus_, a Gram negative coccobacillus or short rod. This organism is a facultative intracellular pathogen. Up to 9 _B. abortus_ biovars (1-9) have been reported, but some of these biovars differ only slightly and their status is unresolved. Other _Brucella_ species uncommonly associated with disease in cattle include _B. melitensis_ and _B. suis_. (For information on _B. suis_ or _B. melitensis_, see the fact sheets titled 'Porcine Brucellosis' (http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/brucellosis_suis.pdf and 'Ovine and Caprine Brucellosis,' http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/brucellosis_melitensis.pdf, respectively.)\n\nIn animals, _B. abortus_ is usually transmitted by contact with the placenta, fetus, fetal fluids, and vaginal discharges from infected animals. Animals are infectious after either abortion or full-term parturition. _B. abortus_ may also be found in the milk, urine, semen, feces, and hygroma fluids. Shedding in milk can be prolonged or lifelong, and may be intermittent. Many infected cattle become chronic carriers.\n\nInfection usually occurs by ingestion and through mucous membranes, but _B. abortus_ can be transmitted through broken skin. Although the mammary gland is usually colonized during the course of an infection, it can also be infected by direct contact, with subsequent shedding of the organisms in the milk. In utero infections also occur. Venereal transmission seems to be uncommon. Transmission by artificial insemination is reported to occur when contaminated semen is deposited in the uterus but not in the midcervix. _B. abortus_ can be spread on fomites including feed and water. In conditions of high humidity, low temperatures, and no sunlight, these organisms can remain viable for several months in water, aborted fetuses, manure, wool, hay, equipment and clothes. _Brucella_ species can withstand drying, particularly when organic material is present and can survive in dust and soil. Survival is longer when the temperature is low, particularly when it is below freezing.\n\nIn cattle, abortions and stillbirths usually occur 2 weeks to 5 months after infection. Reproductive losses typically occur during the 2nd half of gestation; thus, the incubation period is longer when animals are infected early in gestation.\n\nIn cattle, _B. abortus_ causes abortions and stillbirths; abortions usually occur during the 2nd half of gestation. The abortion rate may be as high as 80 percent. Some calves are born alive but weak, and may die soon after birth. The placenta may be retained and secondary metritis can occur. Lactation may be decreased. After the 1st abortion, subsequent pregnancies are generally normal; however, cows may shed the organism in milk and uterine discharges. Epididymitis, seminal vesiculitis, orchitis, or testicular abscesses are sometimes seen in bulls. Infertility occurs occasionally in both sexes, due to metritis or orchitis/epididymitis. Hygromas, particularly on the leg joints, are a common symptom in some tropical countries. Arthritis can develop in some long-term infections. Systemic signs do not usually occur in uncomplicated infections, and deaths are rare except in the fetus or newborn.

The presence of Brucella in raw milk represents a significant danger to public health.'\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-Mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[It is now apparent that the diagnosis of brucellosis in this case is incorrect due to a false positive result. It was not stated in the initial report how the diagnosis was initially made, either by serological and microbiological means. It is most likely that a commercial laboratory antibody test for brucellosis was the culprit rather than a culture report for 2 reasons. The main reason relates to the fact that every assay has some degree of false positive tests and if the assay is done in a low prevalence population, many of the positives will be false positives. Additionally, culture of brucellae usually takes, especially on primary isolation, more time than it took to become positive here.\n\nIt still may be the case that the individual's illness was related to the ingestion of the raw milk but the diagnosis is not brucellosis. - Mod. LL]\n\n[Any time there is a suspected human case of brucellosis there is traceback to the dairy that may have produced the milk or been involved in the disease. In this case the dairy is known so the animals in question would have undergone a series of testing. There are many tests used before an animal is deemed to be positive. Each test has a certain level of sensitivity and specificity associated with it. Ultimately it means that no test is perfect. When there are cases where a test appears to be positive, then one has to examine what makes a test appear to be positive. Some of the animal tests cross react with _Yersinia enterocolitica_ which the animals can harbor. This bacterium can also be transferred by dirty milking equipment or by operators with dirty hands.\n\nEach animal at the dairy will be subject to blood tests and may also be subject to milk test.\n\nMicroscopic examination of smears stained with the Stamp's modification of the Ziehl-Neelsen method can be useful for a presumptive diagnosis, particularly if the direct examination is supported by serology. Brucella species are not truly acid-fast, but they are resistant to decolorization by weak acids, and stain red against a blue background. Brucellae are coccobacilli or short rods, usually arranged singly but sometimes in pairs or small groups. This test is not definitive. Other organisms such as _Chlamydophila abortus_ and _Coxiella burnetii_ can resemble Brucella. Immunostaining is sometimes used to identify Brucella in smears.\n\nSerology can be used for a presumptive diagnosis of brucellosis, or to screen herds. Serological tests used to test individual cattle and herds include the buffered Brucella antigen tests (rose bengal test and buffered plate agglutination test), complement fixation, indirect or competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) or the fluorescence polarization assay. Other serological tests include rivanol precipitation, acidified antigen procedures and the serum agglutination test (tube or microtiter test). Supplemental tests such as complement fixation or rivanol precipitation are often used to clarify the results from plate or card agglutination tests. ELISAs or the Brucella milk ring test (BRT) can be used to screen herds by detecting antibodies in milk. In vaccinated cattle, the native hapten-based gel precipitation tests (gel diffusion or radial immunodiffusion tests) are sometimes used to distinguish vaccination from infection.\n\nA brucellin allergic skin test can be used to test unvaccinated cattle for B. abortus. This test is performed by injecting the allergen intradermally into the caudal fold, the skin of the flank, or the side of the neck.\n\nA definitive diagnosis can be made if B. abortus is cultured from an animal. Brucella spp. can be isolated on a variety of plain media, or selective media such as Farrell's medium or Thayer-Martin\u2019s modified medium. Enrichment techniques can also be used. Brucella colonies usually become visible after two days growth. After four days of incubation, the colonies are round and approximately 1-2 mm in diameter with smooth margins. When the plates are viewed in daylight through a transparent medium, the colonies are translucent and a pale honey color. From above, they are convex and pearly white. Smooth (S) Brucella cultures can dissociate to rough (R) forms. These colonies are much less transparent and become more granular and dull. In crystal violet staining, rough colonies stain red and smooth colonies stain pale yellow. B. abortus can be identified to the species and biovar level by phage typing and cultural, biochemical and serological characteristics. Genetic techniques can also be used for biotyping. The vaccine strains (B. abortus strains S19 and RB51) can be distinguished from field strains by their growth characteristics and sensitivity to antibiotics and other additives.\n\nIn cattle, B. abortus causes abortions and stillbirths; abortions usually occur during the second half of gestation. Some calves are born alive but weak, and may die soon after birth. The placenta may be retained and secondary metritis can occur. Lactation may be decreased. After the first abortion, subsequent pregnancies are generally normal; however, cows may shed the organism in milk and uterine discharges. Epididymitis, seminal vesiculitis, orchitis or testicular abscesses are sometimes seen in bulls. Infertility occurs occasionally in both sexes, due to metritis or orchitis/epididymitis. Hygromas, particularly on the leg joints, are a common signs in some tropical countries. Arthritis can develop in some long-term infections. Systemic signs do not usually occur in uncomplicated infections, and deaths are rare except in the fetus or newborn. Infections in nonpregnant females are usually asymptomatic. This fact may cause an infection to be unnoticed and/or undiagnosed.\n\nLikewise, there are reasons other than infections which may cause cows to abort their calves, such as genetic defects in the calves or severe mineral imbalances. While dairies will notice them, not every abortion has a definitive diagnosis attached to it. Other diseases causing abortion or epididymitis and orchitis should be considered. In cattle, the differential diagnosis includes trichomoniasis, vibriosis, leptospirosis, listeriosis, infectious bovine rhinotracheitis and various mycoses.\n\nAnimal inoculation is rarely used to isolate B. abortus, but may be necessary if other techniques fail. Guinea pigs or mice can be used.\n\nPolymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques and other genetic techniques (restriction fragment length polymorphism or Southern blotting) are available in some laboratories. Similar tests are used to diagnose B. abortus infections in species other than cattle, but each test must be validated in that species.\n\nOne might also ask if the diary workers had any illnesses. There are times when the dairy workers may be the first to have acquired brucellosis, or conversely have passed an infection to the animal.\n\nRaw milk has come under fire from people concerned about diseases, as well as those who believe it to be the most healthy. The first case of bovine tuberculosis that is transmitted to a person consuming raw will may well be undoing of the raw milk industry. While cattle are tested, a disease such as tuberculosis that develops slowly and over time may not test positive for some time. But it could have devastating consequences to the individual(s) involved.\n\nThere are numerous state and federal regulations covering milk production. However, dairy inspections are done by people. Mistakes can and do happen. Political clout can cause some inspectors or their supervisors to \u2018overlook\u2019 some infractions of regulations listed in the Pasteurized Milk Ordinance (PMO). Furthermore, every dairy wants to remain in business, and will complain to authorities including the state veterinarian, who in many cases are pseudo-politicians themselves. These authorities are often interested in keeping dairies open,  and commerce flowing, thus downgrading the importance of public health protection by overlooking regulations within the PMO.\n\nTherefore, the ultimate questions remain: how safe is raw milk? How well are regulations about public health enforced? And for those who choose commerce over public health, will they be able to live with the issue of human death on their hands when it happens on their watch? \u2013 Mod.TG\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/r/1vdg.]", "summary": "Serological tests used to test individual cattle and herds include the buffered Brucella antigen tests (rose bengal test and buffered plate agglutination test), complement fixation, indirect or competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) or the fluorescence polarization assay. \n\n'While initial test results did show up positive, further, more specific and accurate testing by the CDC confirmed that the person does not have brucellosis,' Nathan L'Etoile wrote in the message forwarded by the NOFA/Massachusetts Raw Milk Network. \n\nEach animal at the dairy will be subject to blood tests and may also be subject to milk test.

He said the animal was destroyed.\n\nMiller said the ranches were open about the infection and encouraged\nthe Montana Department of Livestock to release the information about\nthe ranch. 'We had one positive animal on the ranch and we tested the\nentire herd,' Miller said. 'It's not unexpected when you're in the\ndesignated surveillance area (for brucellosis), which was created for\na reason.'\n\nLast month state veterinarian Marty Zaluski announced that a bull\nanimal on a Madison County ranch had tested positive for the disease,\nwhich can cause females [bison, cattle, elk] to abort their young.\nZaluski would not release the species of animal or the location of the\nranch other than to say it was in Madison County. He was complying\nwith a law passed by the 2011 Legislature that requires the state to\nkeep information confidential [that would] reveal specific ranchers\nfound to have an animal with the disease .\n\nThe Montana Standard challenged Zaluski to release the information,\nbut had not received a reply as of Wednesday.\n\nMiller said the Snowcrest performed 1,698 tests for brucellosis on the\nranch and the bull was the only one that came back positive. He said\nthey are confident the disease was transmitted by elk. They are\ntesting to confirm that using modern methods that can help identify\nthe source.\n\n'It's not unanticipated; the state would confirm that is an area with\na higher expectation because of elk,' he said. 'I don't think we or\nany of our neighbors are immune to further incidents of brucellosis.'\n\nLast year the Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks began a\nstudy of brucellosis in Ruby Valley elk. Biologists found that 12 of\n100 cow elk captured tested positive for exposure to the disease.\n\nThe lone bull bison that tested positive does not trigger a loss of\nMontana's brucellosis-free status by the federal government, said Eric\nLiska, brucellosis program veterinarian with the Montana Department of\nLivestock. Under the rules of the designated surveillance area (for\nbrucellosis), the Snowcrest Ranch is under quarantine.\n\nThat means any livestock taken off the ranch must be hauled in a\nsealed trailer and taken directly to slaughter, Liska said. The ranch\nis barred from selling livestock to other ranches.\n\nLiska said the new rules for ranchers within the surveillance area\ngive them options to manage their herd and prevent further infections\nwithout causing the entire state to lose its brucellosis-free status.\nHe said the adjoining properties will be required to test all their\nanimals.\n\nThe Snowcrest Ranch will need 3 negative tests of all its animals to\nhave the quarantine lifted, Liska said.

Brucellosis is an infectious disease passed primarily between animals, but it can be acquired by humans through the consumption of raw milk.\n\nOfficials from the state Department of Public Health said they are investigating Twin Rivers Farm in Ashley Falls as the possible source of the infection, because the infected man purchased raw milk there. The dairy sells raw milk only at the facility, not in retail stores, and officials urged anyone who bought raw milk there to discard it. The owners of Twin Rivers Farm could not be reached for comment. Raw milk is not pasteurized, a process that heats food to kill bacteria. Health officials stressed that pasteurized milk is safe to drink.\n\nDr Alfred DeMaria, the state's top disease tracker, said the infected man, who was not identified because of patient confidentiality rules, is believed to have consumed the milk in late December 2011. But because the illness often starts with flu-like symptoms, it was difficult to pinpoint at first. 'It can percolate along with fever, fatigue, muscle aches, and with nonspecific symptoms, and can be very difficult to diagnose,' DeMaria said. 'It's an astute physician that worked it out,' he said, and alerted public health officials last night.\n\nThe man is recovering and is at home, DeMaria said, and there have been no other reported human infections. Preliminary tests to confirm the infection are expected back next week. State agriculture officials have worked hard over the past half century to reduce brucellosis infections in livestock. Dr Eugene White, an associate professor at the Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine at Tufts University, said the disease is not widely contagious among farm animals, but in areas of the world where it is common, such as South America, it can significantly hamper a herd's ability to reproduce. 'In regions of world that have this commonly, 10 to 25 per cent of cows will abort,' he said.\n\nDr Catherine Brown, the state's public health veterinarian, said the germ is not typically found in the USA, and particularly not in New England. 'We have not seen the bacteria identified in a Massachusetts animal in decades,' Brown said. If the infection is confirmed, it will have 'significant implications' for Massachusetts livestock, she said. 'We will have to figure out how the organism got here, if other livestock was exposed ,and if others are at risk,' she said.\n\nWilliam Gillmeister of the Massachusetts Department of Agricultural Resources said his agency has inspected Twin Rivers Farm and found it to be a well-run business with no history of problems. He said investigators are still trying to determine the source of the infection and are not certain that it is in the farm's raw milk, but the milk sales have been discontinued. Gillmeister said farms must obtain a permit from his department to sell raw milk. 'We regularly test the milk to make sure it is safe,' he said.\n\nThe department and health officials are advising consumers who have purchased raw milk from Twin Rivers Farm to discard it, and anyone who believes they became ill from drinking raw milk should immediately seek medical attention and notify the local board of health or the state's Food Protection Program, at 617-983-6712.\n\n[byline: Kay Lazar]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[It is not clearly stated that the milk was of bovine origin but the comments in the posting suggest that this is the case and that the isolate may be _Brucella abortus_, instead of _B. suis_ or _B. melitensis_. However, it appears that additional testing is pending. It is also not stated if, at this point, the diagnosis has been suspected by the use of serological testing of the patient or if brucellae have been isolated from the patient's blood cultures. The organism is fastidious and can be a slow grower on primary growth from the blood.\n\nCampaigns to eradicate _B. abortus_ from cattle in the USA began in 1934 and have been quite successful. A year ago, commenting on a cluster of _B. abortus_ in cattle in Starr County, Texas http://www.tahc.state.tx.us/news/pr/2011/2011Feb_BrucellosisInStarrCounty.pdf it was stated that 'Currently, the only known reservoir for bovine brucellosis is in elk and bison and is in the US Greater Yellowstone Area (GYA) located in parts of Montana, Idaho, and Wyoming.' ProMED-mail has posted on bovine _B. abortus_ infection in this area in recent years (see 'see also').\n\nOnce again, the specter of human infection acquired from unpasteurized milk or other dairy product has raised its head. Among the illness linked to raw milk include zoonotic organisms such as _Brucella abortus_, _Brucella melitensis_, _Mycobacterium bovis_, _Salmonella_ species, _Listeria monocytogenes_, _Campylobacter_ species, _Yersinia_ species, Coxiella burnetii, and _E. coli_ O157:H7. Non-zoonotic organisms such as _Streptococcus pyogenes_, _Salmonella_ Typhi, _Corynebacterium diphtheriae_, _Shigella_ species, _Salmonella_ Paratyphi A, _Salmonella_ Paratyphi B, enterotoxins from _Staphylococcus aureus_, and hepatitis A.\n\nOther diseases that can be related to unpasteurized milk are highlighted in these paragraphs extracted from Leedom JM. Milk and infectious diseases in humans. Clin Infect Dis 2006;43: 610-615 with the citations renumbered to be consecutive starting from 1:\n\n'In 1996 and 1998, there were 2 episodes involving rabid cows that occurred in Massachusetts (1). Milk from rabid cows can contain rabies virus, and transmission via unpasteurized milk is theoretically possible. Temperatures reached during pasteurization kill the virus. 80 persons consumed unpasteurized milk that was collected from the 2 cows, and 9 more had contact with saliva from the cows. All 89 persons received postexposure rabies prophylaxis, and no human cases of rabies eventuated. A similar report in Oklahoma of possible rabies exposure associated with the consumption of raw milk or cream from a rabid cow was circulated in 2006 (2). Tickborne encephalitis, a zoonotic arbovirus infection usually transmitted to humans by the bite of an _Ixodes persulcutus_ or _Ixodes ricinis_ tick, is endemic to Central Europe, Eastern Europe, and Russia (3). However, the virus can be found in the milk of cows and goats with tickborne encephalitis and was reported to be transmissible to humans by the consumption of unpasteurized milk (4). A case-control study failed to confirm oral transmission (5). A diarrhea syndrome (later named Brainerd diarrhea) occurred among 122 residents of Brainerd, Minnesota, during the period Dec 1983-Jul 1984 (6). It was characterized by acute onset, marked urgency, lack of systemic symptoms, failure to respond to conventional antimicrobial agents, and a long median duration of illness (median duration, 16.5 months). The syndrome was linked to consumption of raw milk from a single dairy (6). No etiologic agent was ever isolated. The outbreak of Brainerd diarrhea stopped when all of the dairy's output was diverted and pasteurized (6, MT Osterholm, personal communication). Subsequent outbreaks in Illinois and Texas were not directly associated with milk, although cattle had been in the vicinity of an Illinois well that had its water implicated as a vehicle of transmission (7). Another outbreak of Brainerd-like diarrhea, although not associated with raw milk, affected 58 (15 percent) of 394 passengers aboard a cruise ship visiting the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador (8).\n\n1.

Infection spreads rapidly and causes many abortions in unvaccinated cattle. In a herd in which the disease is endemic, an infected cow typically aborts only once after exposure; subsequent gestations and lactations appear normal. After exposure, cattle become bacteremic for a short period and develop agglutinins and other antibodies; some resist infection and a small percentage of infected cows recover. A positive serum agglutination test usually precedes an abortion or a normal parturition but may be delayed in about 15 per cent of cows. The incubation period may be variable and is inversely related to stage of gestation at time of exposure. Organisms are shed in milk and uterine discharges, and the cow may become temporarily infertile. Bacteria may be found in the uterus during pregnancy, uterine involution, and infrequently, for a prolonged time, in the non-gravid uterus. Shedding from the vagina largely disappears with the decrease of fluids following parturition. Some infected cows that previously aborted shed brucellae from the uterus at subsequent normal parturitions. Organisms are shed in milk for a variable length of time -- in most cattle for life.\n\nNatural transmission occurs by ingestion of organisms, which are present in large numbers in aborted fetuses, fetal membranes, and uterine discharges. Cattle may ingest contaminated feed and water, or lick contaminated genitals of other animals. Venereal transmission by infected bulls to susceptible cows appears to be rare. Transmission may occur by artificial insemination when brucella-contaminated semen is deposited in the uterus but, reportedly, not when deposited in the mid-cervix. Brucellae may enter the body through mucous membranes, conjunctivae, wounds, or intact skin.\n\nBrucellae have been recovered from fetuses and from manure that has remained in a cool environment for more than 2 months. Exposure to direct sunlight kills the organisms within a few hours.\n\nBecause organisms are shed in the milk, unpasteurized milk, and cheese represent a human health concern. Many individuals believe drinking unpasteurized milk is better for their health. Diseases that are not killed by pasteurization represent a risk to the consumer. Brucellosis in humans causes malaise, fever, chills, sweats, headache, neck pain, low back pain, joint pain, muscle pain, occasionally diarrhea, constipation, anorexia, weight loss, abdominal pain, weakness, irritability, insomnia, and depression. Brucellosis has been called undulating fever because of its habit of producing fever and signs that wax and wane over an extended period of time.\n\nPortions of this comment have been extracted from http://www.merckvetmanual.com/mvm/index.jsp?cfile=htm/bc/110502.htm&word=Brucellosis. - Mod.LL\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/r/1vdg.]", "summary": "\n\nThe department and health officials are advising consumers who have purchased raw milk from Twin Rivers Farm to discard it, and anyone who believes they became ill from drinking raw milk should immediately seek medical attention and notify the local board of health or the state's Food Protection Program, at 617-983-6712.

If confirmed, it would\nbe the region's 15th infection in livestock since 2004.\n\nIntroduced by early European settlers and once widespread, brucellosis\nhas since been largely eradicated from cattle nationwide after a\ndecades-long government effort. It persists in parts of Texas and in\nwildlife in and around Yellowstone National Park.\n\nBrucellosis can cause pregnant animals to miscarry and has been blamed\nfor weight loss and other problems in cattle. It is not considered a\nsignificant threat to human health.\n\nErrol Rice with the Montana Stockgrowers Association said the\nsuspected infection in the 150-head herd demonstrated that more needs\nto be done to eliminate the disease. 'The more cases we continue to\nidentify, it makes you wonder have we really made that much progress\non mitigating the problem,' Rice said. 'The fact remains we still have\na large reservoir of the disease in a particular area of Montana that\ncontinues to affect our industry.'\n\nThousands of Yellowstone bison have been captured and sent to\nslaughter over the last decade to prevent transmissions to cattle when\nthe bison migrate to lower elevations in Montana. That has not stopped\ntransmissions from the tens of thousands of elk that roam freely\nacross the Yellowstone region.\n\nTests on elk over the last year revealed a new area of wildlife\ninfections in parts of Montana west of Yellowstone. Montana, Idaho,\nand Wyoming in recent years started requiring more stringent testing\nand vaccinations against the disease. That prompted the federal\ngovernment to stop automatically imposing trade restrictions on states\nthat have multiple infections.\n\nThe government also no longer requires that infected herds be\nslaughtered. State officials did not disclose the name of the ranch\nwhere the disease was found.

Some hunters\nparticipate in disease surveillance by providing samples for testing.\nAn outfitter, provided with information and sample kits by Sustainable\nResource Development, harvested 2 adult female bison in February and\nMarch [2011] that tested positive for exposure to brucellosis.

Infection\nspreads rapidly and causes many abortions in unvaccinated cattle. In a\nherd in which the disease is endemic, an infected cow typically aborts\nonly once after exposure; subsequent gestations and lactations appear\nnormal. After exposure, cattle become bacteremic for a short period\nand develop agglutinins and other antibodies; some resist infection\nand a small percentage of infected cows recover. A positive serum\nagglutination test usually precedes an abortion or a normal\nparturition but may be delayed in about 15 percent of cows. The\nincubation period may be variable and is inversely related to stage of\ngestation at time of exposure. Organisms are shed in milk and uterine\ndischarges, and the cow may become temporarily infertile. Bacteria may\nbe found in the uterus during pregnancy, uterine involution, and\ninfrequently, for a prolonged time, in the non-gravid uterus. Shedding\nfrom the vagina largely disappears with the decrease of fluids\nfollowing parturition. Some infected cows that previously aborted shed\nbrucellae from the uterus at subsequent normal parturitions. Organisms\nare shed in milk for a variable length of time -- in most cattle for\nlife.\n\nNatural transmission occurs by ingestion of organisms, which are\npresent in large numbers in aborted fetuses, fetal membranes, and\nuterine discharges. Cattle may ingest contaminated feed and water, or\nlick contaminated genitals of other animals. Venereal transmission by\ninfected bulls to susceptible cows appears to be rare. Transmission\nmay occur by artificial insemination when _Brucella_ -contaminated\nsemen is deposited in the uterus but, reportedly, not when deposited\nin the mid-cervix. Brucellae may enter the body through mucous\nmembranes, conjunctivae, wounds, or intact skin.\n\nBrucellae have been recovered from fetuses and from manure that has\nremained in a cool environment for more than 2 months. Exposure to\ndirect sunlight kills the organisms within a few hours.\n\nBecause organisms are shed in the milk, unpasteurized milk, and cheese\nrepresent a human health concern. Many individuals believe drinking\nunpasteurized milk is better for their health. Diseases that are not\nkilled by pasteurization represent a risk to the consumer. Brucellosis\nin humans causes malaise, fever, chills, sweats, headache, neck pain,\nlow back pain, joint pain, muscle pain, occasionally diarrhea,\nconstipation, anorexia, weight loss, abdominal pain, weakness,\nirritability, insomnia, and depression.

The government\nordered them sold and slaughtered to keep a disease from spreading to\nother cattle or people.\n\nOf the 38 head of cattle, 8 tested positive for bovine brucellosis.\nIt's a potentially deadly disease that took the government about 80\nyears to get rid of. It came back. This time, they weren't taking any chances.\n\nSilence fills the air on this Starr County ranch. The corrals sit\nempty, no bulls, cows, or calves. All of the rancher's livestock are\ngone, slaughtered by order of the Texas Animal Health Commission.\n\n'All the cattle, even the ones that tested negative. The explanation\nthey gave me is that since they were offspring from the other cattle\nand the bull, they had to destroy all of them,' said the Starr County rancher.\n\nThe state sent a letter to the rancher after part of their herd was\ntested for the disease in January [2011]. Veterinarians claimed\nseveral of the cows were infected with bovine brucellosis. It's the\n1st confirmed case in more than 5 years.\n\nThe rare bacterial infection causes cows to abort their fetus. It's a\nmeat livestock producer's nightmare.\n\nVeterinarian Jack Valerius says brucellosis spreads through birth\nfluids and milk.\n\n'We just don't want this to be present and begin to expand without\nknowing where it is and getting rid of it because there's been a lot\nof effort and a lot of money spent to accomplish this eradication,'\nsays Valerius.\n\nIt has caused heartaches and headaches for the rancher. 'My email\nmachine is loaded with things like that. That I should be sent to\njail. That I should be sent to prison for selling infected cattle.\nHow did I know that these cattle were infected?' says the rancher.\n\nThe rancher expects the state will pay for his cattle soon. Right\nnow, that's the least of his worries. 'I just hope that something\nlike this doesn't happen to my neighbors,' says the rancher.\n\n'Now they're in the process of testing the herds in the surrounding\nareas, approximately 1 mile [1.6 km] from where these cases were\nfound, and so far, I understand there are no positives,' says Valerius.\n\nThe rancher and his wife wanted to raise a few head of cattle. 'It's\nsomething my father had started many, many years ago, and we\ncontinued. But it's over now, and I just don't wish that for anyone\nelse,' he said.\n\nThe ranch is quarantined. Their hopes and the herd are gone.\n\nBrucellosis can also cause a disease in humans known as undulant\nfever. It proved to be deadly in the 1930s and '40s, but modern\nmedicine has made it treatable.\n\n[Byline: Polo Sandoval]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Brucellosis, in cattle, water buffalo, and bison is caused almost\nexclusively by _Brucella abortus_ ; however, _B. suis_ or _B.\nmelitensis_ are occasionally implicated in some cattle herds. _B.\nsuis_ does not appear to be contagious from cow to cow. Infection\nspreads rapidly and causes many abortions in unvaccinated cattle. In\na herd in which the disease is endemic, an infected cow typically\naborts only once after exposure; subsequent gestations and lactations\nappear normal. After exposure, cattle become bacteremic for a short\nperiod and develop agglutinins and other antibodies; some resist\ninfection and a small percentage of infected cows recover. A positive\nserum agglutination test usually precedes an abortion or a normal\nparturition but may be delayed in about 15 per cent of cows. The\nincubation period may be variable and is inversely related to stage\nof gestation at time of exposure. Organisms are shed in milk and\nuterine discharges, and the cow may become temporarily infertile.\nBacteria may be found in the uterus during pregnancy, uterine\ninvolution, and infrequently, for a prolonged time, in the non-gravid\nuterus. Shedding from the vagina largely disappears with the decrease\nof fluids following parturition. Some infected cows that previously\naborted shed brucellae from the uterus at subsequent normal\nparturitions. Organisms are shed in milk for a variable length of\ntime -- in most cattle for life.\n\nNatural transmission occurs by ingestion of organisms, which are\npresent in large numbers in aborted fetuses, fetal membranes, and\nuterine discharges. Cattle may ingest contaminated feed and water, or\nlick contaminated genitals of other animals. Venereal transmission by\ninfected bulls to susceptible cows appears to be rare. Transmission\nmay occur by artificial insemination when _Brucella_ -contaminated\nsemen is deposited in the uterus but, reportedly, not when deposited\nin the mid-cervix. Brucellae may enter the body through mucous\nmembranes, conjunctivae, wounds, or intact skin.\n\nBrucellae have been recovered from fetuses and from manure that has\nremained in a cool environment for more than 2 months. Exposure to\ndirect sunlight kills the organisms within a few hours.\n\nBecause organisms are shed in the milk, unpasteurized milk, and\ncheese represent a human health concern. Many individuals believe\ndrinking unpasteurized milk is better for their health. Diseases that\nare not killed by pasteurization represent a risk to the consumer.\nBrucellosis in humans causes malaise, fever, chills, sweats,\nheadache, neck pain, low back pain, joint pain, muscle pain,\noccasionally diarrhea, constipation, anorexia, weight loss, abdominal\npain, weakness, irritability, insomnia, and depression.

The bacterium causes abortions and infertility in dogs and\nmay, in exceptional cases, infect humans. The infected bitch was\nkilled. At present, steps have been undertaken to carry out tests and\nto try trace contact cases in order to stop the spread.\n\nThe affected animal was an American Staffordshire terrier-bitch\nimported from Poland, where it has was mated. When she aborted her\nlitter in June 2011, samples were taken to find the cause. The samples\nshowed positive results for _B. canis_ in the National Veterinary\nInstitute (SVA) and, in July 2011 at the EU reference laboratory. The\nSwedish Board of Agriculture decided that the bitch should be killed\nimmediately to prevent further spread of infection. The male suspected\nof having infected the bitch was born in Serbia and found to present\nreduced fertility, a symptom of the disease. The male is now in\nSweden.\n\nIt is important to test dogs from other countries\n-------------------------------------------------\nOne should not breed animals that are infected with _B. canis_. It is\nalways a greater risk to mate in a foreign country or import dogs,\nsays Pia Ehrenpris, veterinarian at the Board of Agriculture. We\nrecommend all owners to be careful when identifying the animals used\nfor breeding or imported. Many diseases such as leptospirosis can\noften be excluded by means of preventive testing prior to breeding or\nimportation.\n\nSexually transmitted disease\n----------------------------\nThe bacteria are spread primarily through mating, but they also occur\nthrough the transfer, for example, of aborted materials, milk, and\nurine. In exceptional cases, the bacteria can also infect humans. Sick\nanimals may particularly suffer impaired fertility but may also have\nproblems with back, eyes, and skin. Asymptomatic infections are\noccurring. Although one might try treating an infected dog, it is\nimpossible to guarantee that the dog ever becomes free of the\nbacteria.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nSabine Zentis\nCastleview Pedigree English Longhorns\nGut Laach\n52385 Nideggen\nGermany\nhttp://www.cvlonghorns.de\n<cvlonghorns@aol.com>\n\n[Initial publication of the suspected case was released by the Swedish\nBoard of Agriculture on 1 Jul 2011; see '_Brucella canis_ in Sweden'\nhttp://www.jordbruksverket.se/amnesomraden/djur/nyheteromdjur/nyheterdjur2011/brucellacanisisverige.5.695e8a9d130df3a0f5880001529.html\n(in Swedish).\n\nCanine brucellosis, caused by _B. canis_, is an important cause of\nreproductive failure in dogs, particularly in kennels and can end the\nreproductive career of a breeding animal. _B. canis_ is zoonotic,\nalthough disease appears to be rare in humans. Other _Brucella_\nspecies occasionally associated with disease in dogs include _B.\nabortus_, _B. melitensis_, and _B. suis_. Genetic and immunologic\nevidence suggests that all members of the genus _Brucella_ are closely\nrelated.\n\nDogs are the only species known to be affected by _B. canis_; however,\nantibodies to this organism have been found in other carnivores.\n\n_B. canis_ has been reported from the United States (particularly the\nsouthern states), Canada, Central and South America (including\nMexico), some European countries, Tunisia, Nigeria, Madagascar,\nMalaysia, India, Korea, Japan, and China. _B. canis_ is probably found\nthroughout most of the world; however, New Zealand and Australia\nappear to be free of this organism.\n\nIn dogs, _B. canis_ is mainly transmitted by contact with the fetus\nand fetal membranes after abortions/stillbirths, or by venereal\ntransmission. This organism can be found in vaginal discharges for 4\nto 6 weeks after an abortion. It is also shed in normal vaginal\nsecretions, particularly during estrus, as well as in milk. High\nconcentrations of _B. canis_ are found in semen for up to 2 months\nafter infection, and intermittent shedding of smaller quantities can\noccur for years. _B. canis_ is also found in urine, and low\nconcentrations of bacteria may be excreted in saliva, nasal and ocular\nsecretions, and feces.\n\nCanine brucellosis is usually introduced into a kennel in an infected\ndog or semen. This disease is controlled by sanitation and the removal\nof infected dogs. Housing in individual cages reduces the spread of\nthe organism. Repeated testing and the removal of seropositive or\nculture-positive animals, combined with quarantine and testing of\nnewly added dogs, have been used to eradicate brucellosis from some\nkennels. There is no vaccine for _B. canis_.\n\nLong-term antibiotic therapy has been used successfully to treat some\ndogs, but some animals relapse. Neutering can be used as an additional\ncontrol measure.\n\nHumans usually become infected with _Brucella_ spp. by ingesting\norganisms or by the contamination of mucous membranes and abraded\nskin. Infection with _B. canis_ seems to require close contact with\ninfected dogs or contact with bacterial cultures. The virulence of\nthis organism for humans may be low. Approximately 30 cases have been\nreported worldwide since the 1960s. However, _B. canis_ infections can\nbe difficult to diagnose in humans and may be underreported.

Repeated testing and the removal of seropositive or\nculture-positive animals, combined with quarantine and testing of\nnewly added dogs, have been used to eradicate brucellosis from some\nkennels. B. canis_ has been reported from the United States (particularly the\nsouthern states), Canada, Central and South America (including\nMexico), some European countries, Tunisia, Nigeria, Madagascar,\nMalaysia, India, Korea, Japan, and China. Typically, this disease\nbegins as an acute febrile illness with nonspecific flu-like signs\nsuch as fever, headache, malaise, back pain, myalgia, and generalized\naches. Canine brucellosis, caused by _B. canis_, is an important cause of\nreproductive failure in dogs, particularly in kennels and can end the\nreproductive career of a breeding animal. In dogs, _B. canis_ is mainly transmitted by contact with the fetus\nand fetal membranes after abortions/stillbirths, or by venereal\ntransmission. _B. canis_ is also found in urine, and low\nconcentrations of bacteria may be excreted in saliva, nasal and ocular\nsecretions, and feces. \n\nHumans usually become infected with _Brucella_ spp. by ingesting\norganisms or by the contamination of mucous membranes and abraded\nskin. The male suspected\nof having infected the bitch was born in Serbia and found to present\nreduced fertility, a symptom of the disease. B. canis_ is probably found\nthroughout most of the world; however, New Zealand and Australia\nappear to be free of this organism. The samples\nshowed positive results for _B. canis_ in the National Veterinary\nInstitute (SVA) and, in July 2011 at the EU reference laboratory. Although one might try treating an infected dog, it is\nimpossible to guarantee that the dog ever becomes free of the\nbacteria. Other _Brucella_\nspecies occasionally associated with disease in dogs include _B.\nabortus_, _B. melitensis_, and _B. suis_. Canine brucellosis: _Brucella canis_; available at\nhttp://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/brucellosis_canis.pdf.\n- Mod. The bacteria are spread primarily through mating, but they also occur\nthrough the transfer, for example, of aborted materials, milk, and\nurine. In\nsymptomatic cases, brucellosis is extremely variable and the clinical\nsigns may appear insidiously or abruptly. It is\nalways a greater risk to mate in a foreign country or import dogs,\nsays Pia Ehrenpris, veterinarian at the Board of Agriculture. Sick\nanimals may particularly suffer impaired fertility but may also have\nproblems with back, eyes, and skin. The\nSwedish Board of Agriculture decided that the bitch should be killed\nimmediately to prevent further spread of infection. We\nrecommend all owners to be careful when identifying the animals used\nfor breeding or imported. Many diseases such as leptospirosis can\noften be excluded by means of preventive testing prior to breeding or\nimportation.", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "brucellosis"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2011-06-24 00:00:00", "2011-07-24 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Poland", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "the United States", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Korea", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Mexico", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Australia", "country": "Australia"}, {"location": "Madagascar", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "India", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "New Zealand", "country": "New Zealand"}, {"location": "Sweden", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Malaysia", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Serbia", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "China", "country": "China"}, {"location": "Tunisia", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Nigeria", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "POLAND", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Canada", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Japan", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "598398", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Brucellosis, human, livestock - Russia: (SR) RFI", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=598398", "date": "2010-12-06 15:00:04", "main_text": "BRUCELLOSIS, HUMAN, LIVESTOCK - RUSSIA: (SARATOV) REQUEST FOR INFORMATION\n*************************************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\n<http://www.promedmail.org>\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\n<http://www.isid.org>\n\nDate: Thu 2 Dec 2010\nSource: Komsomolskaya Pravda [in Russian, trans.

The adult beef cow was from a ranch in Park County. State\nanimal health officials currently are investigating the case, and\nmaking plans for further testing of the cow, as well as the herd she\nwas from.\n\nAccording to assistant state veterinarian Bob Meyer, a diagnosis of\nbrucellosis in a Wyoming cow is no longer as big a threat to the\nstate's cattle industry as it used to be.\n\nIn the past, 2 herds diagnosed with brucellosis within 2 years meant\nthat state would lose Class Free status and would be subjected to more\nstringent testing requirements. On 27 Dec 2010, the United States\nDepartment of Agriculture (USDA) published an interim rule amending\nthe brucellosis regulations.\n\nMeyer explained that the new interim rule says that, 'if you have\ncases of brucellosis in your state, like we do -- and if you're\nresponding appropriately (like we are, by testing, doing epidemiology,\nmaking sure the outbreak is contained and are implementing a\nbrucellosis management plan) -- then the USDA will no longer\nautomatically downgrade your status.'\n\nAs John Clifford, chief veterinary officer for the USDA's Animal and\nPlant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), explained, 'The brucellosis\nprogram has been very successful at reducing the disease in this\ncountry ... These new regulations will help us better address the\ncurrent situation and continue to move toward our long-term goal of\ncomplete eradication.'\n\n'That's good news,' Meyers said. 'The rest of our producers aren't\nthreatened because of this outbreak. In fact,' he said, 'I'm\nresponding to the outbreak as we speak.' Meyers then returned to a\nmeeting with herd owners.\n\n[byline: MJ Clark]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The move by the USDA to not strip a state of its 'free' status is\nlikely driven by budget constraints. Buying out a herd of cattle\nbecause of a disease becomes an expensive proposition. Likewise, the\nUS is moving close to eradication of the disease in domestic animals.\n\nOne of the last and controversial strongholds of the disease is the\nwildlife feeding grounds of the Greater Yellowstone Area (GYA). The\nfeeding areas are hugely popular; they bring in tourist dollars to the\narea, which relies on tourism for much of its living. These feeding\ngrounds stir controversy among conservationist and disease-control\nauthorities. Brucellosis can be transmitted between wildlife and\ndomestic stock. Congregating the animals may assist the spread of the\ndisease among wildlife, which subsequently can spread the disease to\ndomestic stock. Because of the many factions that clash over the GYA,\nit is likely to remain the last brucellosis hot spot in the US.\n\nFor the livestock producers in the states and areas bordering the\nGYA, USDA's action is indeed good news.\n\nInterestingly, while authorities with the USDA stated that all the\nUSA had obtained a brucellosis free status in domestic stock, the\ndisease reappeared in Texas recently.

But once again, he said it\nappears the cattle were exposed to brucellosis in free-ranging elk.\n\nHistorically, the discovery of brucellosis in a 2nd cattle herd would cause\nthe state's cattle industry to lose its federal 'brucellosis-free' status,\nbut Logan said that likely won't be the case now. Officials with the USDA's\nAnimal and Plant Health Inspection Service have been working on a new\npolicy that provides some flexibility in how outbreaks are handled, and as\na result, 'Wyoming is not in jeopardy of losing its free status as long as\nthe state is appropriately handling the cases that arise,' he said.\n\nBrucellosis can cause spontaneous abortions, infertility, decreased milk\nproduction, and weight loss in cattle, elk, bison, and other mammals. It\npersists in herds of wild elk and bison around Yellowstone National Park\nand has periodically passed to cattle in Montana, Idaho, and Wyoming.\n\nLoss of a state's 'brucellosis-free' status can trigger costly restrictions\non marketing of all cattle from that state. According to the media release,\n12 heifers in Park County were tested for brucellosis this fall [2010] when\nthey were sold, a requirement under the state's brucellosis rules in that\npart of the state. 2 of the 12 were found to have been exposed to the\ndisease. One of the animals was destroyed on 10 Nov 2010, and samples from\nthe heifer were tested to determine whether it was actually infected. The\ninfection was confirmed on 24 Nov 2010.\n\nThe remaining 11 animals from the group of 12 were tested, along with 250\nherd mates, the release said. 8 of those animals were found to have been\nexposed to the disease. While a blood test from a live animal can detect\nexposure to brucellosis, the only way to confirm actual infection of an\nanimal is to destroy it.\n\nAs a result of the test results, federal officials have designated the herd\nas an 'affected herd'. The Wyoming Livestock Board has quarantined the herd\nand another 'adjacent' herd, and testing is scheduled to continue on Monday\n[29 Nov 2010] on the affected herd and adjacent herds. 'Epidemiologic\ninterviews are under way to determine the extent of this outbreak,' the\nrelease said.\n\nLate last week [week of 15 Nov 2010], Logan said officials were preparing\nto lift a quarantine of nearly a dozen cattle herds in northern Wyoming\nfollowing the earlier case detected in Park County, also believed to have\nbeen caused by contact with infected elk.\n\nThe state tested more than 3500 cattle in the county after 4 cows of one\n300-head herd were found to have the disease in October [2010]. The herd\nand 11 others nearby were quarantined while tests were done to see if the\ndisease had spread. Officials determined it had not.\n\nIn that earlier case, the one herd with the infected cows will remain under\nquarantine for about a year and undergo more testing to make sure the\ndisease is no longer present. The 4 infected cows have been slaughtered. If\nmore cases are found within the herd, that entire herd may have to be\nslaughtered.\n\nIn Wednesday's [24 Nov 2010] media release, Logan said the USDA is\npreparing to issue a new 'interim rule' regarding brucellosis, a result of\na year and a half of discussion among federal officials and state\nveterinarians in Wyoming, Idaho, and Montana. He said he met late last week\nwith USDA regional officials to discuss the implications of the 2 Park\nCounty cases and was given assurance that Wyoming's brucellosis-free status\nis not yet in jeopardy. [This is good news for Wyoming. It is also\nindicating that the USDA recognizes the challenges of dealing with this\ndisease in an area that is probably the last reservoir of the disease.

The\nstate is working with the owner to test the entire herd. 3\nsurrounding cattle herds also are being tested, even though the bison\nare fenced in, Meyer said.\n\nIt's suspected that elk may have been the source of the disease in\nthe bison, he said.\n\n'We want to make sure that any of the surrounding herds right around\nthere didn't get the same exposures to the elk because the elk can\njump over fences both ways,' Meyer said.\n\nThe new case is not related to an earlier case discovered in late\nOctober [2010] in a separate cattle herd in Park County, located in\nnorthwest Wyoming.

The bison herds of the plains of\nthe US were in danger of possible extinction. The herds were\nco-mingled with cattle, and the disease was thought to have entered\nbison though this co-mingling. Nevertheless, brucellosis is similar\nin bison to that in cattle. However, bison are not believed to\ndemonstrate abortion as do domestic cattle. This may or may not be\ntrue. It might all depend upon the ability to observe and document\nthe circumstances.\n\nIt is encouraging to know the bison from the Yellowstone area remain\nfree of the disease and are not threatened by contact with the remaining herd.\n\nWhile elk are suspected as being the source, this is still a\ndisturbing disease to be found on a ranch whose management is\nregarded as very good.\n\nBrucellosis vaccine RB51 has been shown to be effective in bison.\nHowever, handling these wonderful creatures can be another challenge.\n\nWith approximately 2 million acres of personal and ranch land, Ted\nTurner is the largest individual landholder in North America. Turner\nlands are innovatively managed and work to partner economic viability\nwith ecological sustainability. All Turner ranches operate as working\nbusinesses, relying on bison and outfitting as principal enterprises.\nIn addition, Turner ranches support many progressive environmental\nprojects including water resource management, reforestation and the\nreintroduction of native species to the land.\n\nTurner Enterprises also manages over 50 000 head of bison across the\nvarious Turner ranches.\n\nThe Flying D ranch is 113 613 acres (45 977.549 hectares) and was\nacquired in 1989. The ranch supports bison ranching, elk hunting,\nwolf restoration, and cutthroat trout reintroduction.\n\nBison seem to be a politically sensitive topic, and with dwindling\nfunds for USDA to buy out diseased herds, it is understandable they\nwill take a case by case approach to find the most workable solution\nto this situation.\n\nPortions of this comment have been extracted from:\n<http://www.tedturner.com/enterprises/ranches.asp>. - Mod.TG]\n\n******\n[3] Wyoming\nDate: 5 Nov 2010\nSource: Cattlenetwork.com [edited]\n<http://www.cattlenetwork.com/Another-Cow-Tests-Positive-For-Livestock-Disease/2010-11-05/Article_Latest_News.aspx?oid=1280139&fid=CN-LATEST_NEWS>\n\n\nOnly one more cow has initially tested positive for brucellosis, as\nthe state continues testing more than 1000 cows in the northern Wyoming area.\n\nThe new cow with the disease was from the same herd where the 1st 3\ncows tested positive for exposure to the disease in preparation for\nsale at a livestock market.\n\nState Veterinarian Jim Logan tells the Powell Tribune that he's\nencouraged that extensive testing has yielded only one more positive result.\n\n14 Meeteetse area herds are quarantined under a state order until\ntesting is complete.

But, actually, should we\nassume that _B. abortus_ is the causative agent in this particular\ncase? Reference is made to the last case of bovine brucellosis\n(presumably due to _B. abortus_) occurring more than 5 years ago (2003\nposting in ProMED). Unfortunately, in the moderator's comments,\nreference is not made to 2 other cases of brucellosis posted by ProMED\nthat occurred in Texas a decade or so ago and that are\nepidemiologically relevant. One case was in goats (_Brucella\nmelitensis_ infection), and the other case was in a feral pig hunter\n(the Brucella species is not mentioned).\n\nMy concern is that _B. melitensis_ infection in goats in 1999/2000\nalso took place in Starr county (with a likely origin across the\nMexican border). _B. melitensis_ infection in cattle has been\ndocumented and is a major public health concern (Verger et al, 1989;\nSamaha et al, 2008).\n\nFor the brucellosis case in the feral pig hunter posted in 2009, the\nreader is referred to the Houston Chronicle, which reported Thursday\n[17 Sep 2009] that about 10 percent of Texas feral hogs test positive\nfor brucellosis bacteria: presumably _B. suis_ biovar 1.\n\nAgain, should we make such an assumption? In the south of the USA,\npopulations of feral swine are heavily infected with _B. suis_ biovar\n1 (Olsen and Tatum, 2010), and infections with _B. suis_ biovar 1 in\nhumans occur in people handling pigs, including the hunting of feral\nswine. Texas and other southeastern states report numerous cases of\nseropositive cattle, which are shown by bacterial culture to be\ninfected with _B. suis_ (Olsen and Tatum, 2010). However, it has\nrecently been shown in South Carolina that feral pigs were infected\nwith _B. abortus_ wildtype, S19 and RB51 vaccine strains besides _B.\nsuis_ biovar 1 (Stoffregen et al, 2007). I am wondering whether this\ncould be the case in feral pigs in Texas too.\n\nReferences:\n- Verger, J.M., Garinbastuji, B., Grayon, M., Mahe, A.M., 1989.\nBrucella-Melitensis Infection in Cattle in France.

The\nDepartment of Primary Industries' (DPI) sheep disease project leader\nRobert Suter said he would normally only expect 2-3 reports of ovine\nbrucellosis in Victorian flocks at this time of the year.\n\nThe recent increase in confirmed reports followed drops in scanning\nor lamb marking rates of 10-20 per cent, triggering an investigation,\nhe said. He was not aware of any interstate flocks being affected or\nidentified as a source of infected rams.\n\nOvine brucellosis caused infertility in affected rams and Dr Suter\nsaid in one case an infected ram was shared among 3 flocks. The\nincreased number of reports was a concern because it came at a time\nwhen a lot of attention was being focused on flock reproductive\nperformance and rebuilding the nation's sheep flock, he said.\n\n'It is disappointing for producers when they put a lot of effort into\nbuilding a fertile ewe flock which is managed well throughout\npregnancy only to have the other part of the reproductive equation,\nthe ram, not able to do his job,' Dr Suter said. 'The only treatment\nis to cull these rams.'\n\nDr Suter said DPI was trying to identify the sources of infected rams\nto ensure they did not come from flocks accredited under the Ovine\nBrucellosis Accreditation Scheme. None of the recently reported cases\nindicated there had been any breakdown in the scheme's accreditation\nprocess, he said. 'The best protection is to buy only from ovine\nbrucellosis-free accredited ram sources and check that they can\nprovide a current accreditation certificate.\n\n'If in doubt, have your ram flock assessed by a veterinarian 2 or so\nmonths before mating, as this allows time to source replacement rams\nif necessary,' Dr Suter said.\n\n'Even if brucellosis is not present, the examination can identify\nrams of sub-optimal fertility well prior to mating.'\n\nHe said affected rams could be identified by examination of the\nscrotum and its contents by a veterinarian, who would confirm suspect\nanimals with a blood test as other conditions could mimic brucellosis\nsigns. Dr Suter said once brucellosis had been introduced into the\nram flock, it often took a long series of examinations and blood\ntests to achieve a clean flock of rams.\n\n'By this time a large proportion will have been culled,' Dr Suter said.\n\n[Byline: Terry Sim]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Finding where the disease began is the 1st step in breaking the\ncycle of transmission. Sharing rams is economical, until a disease\npassed from the ram affects the entire flock for many years, which\nmay mean sharing a ram was not so economical after all. Brucellosis\nis a major impact on any producer.\n\n_Brucella ovis_ produces a disease unique to sheep, in which\nepididymitis and orchitis impair fertility -- the principal economic\neffect. Occasionally, placentitis and abortion are seen, and there\nmay be perinatal mortality. The disease was 1st described in New\nZealand and Australia and has since been reported from many\nsheep-raising areas of the world.\n\nRams as young as 8 weeks have been infected experimentally by various\nnonvenereal routes. The disease can be transmitted among rams by\ndirect contact. Active infection in ewes is unusual but has developed\nafter mating with naturally infected rams. Contaminated pastures do\nnot appear to be important in spread of the disease. Infection\nfrequently persists in rams, and a high percentage shed _B ovis_\nintermittently for several years.\n\nBecause not all infected rams show palpable abnormalities of scrotal\ntissues (and not all cases of epididymitis are due to brucellosis),\nthe remaining rams must be examined further. Rams shedding organisms,\nbut having no lesions, must be identified by culture of semen.\nRepeated examinations may be necessary to identify intermittent\nshedders. Microscopic examination of stained semen smears may also be\nhelpful; fluorescent antibody examination is a highly specific\ndiagnostic aid. Serologic tests used for eradication of disease and\ncertification of animals include ELISA, complement fixation,\nhemagglutination inhibition, indirect agglutination, and gel diffusion.\n\nIncidence and spread of the disease may be reduced by regular\nexamination of rams before the breeding season and culling of those\nwith obvious genital abnormalities. Because susceptibility in rams\nincreases markedly with age, it is advantageous to keep a young ram\nflock and isolate noninfected rams from older, possibly infected rams.\n\nImmunization of rams has been practiced extensively in New Zealand\nusing 2 doses of killed _B ovis_ cells in adjuvant. Because infection\nin ewes apparently originates almost exclusively from service by\ninfected rams, lamb losses through infection of ewes may be\ncontrolled economically by restricting vaccination to rams.\n\nChlortetracycline and streptomycin used concurrently have effected\nbacteriologic cures. However, treatment is not economic except in\nespecially valuable rams, and even if infection is eliminated,\nfertility may remain impaired.\n\nPortions of this comment have been extracted from:\n<http://www.merckvetmanual.com/mvm/index.jsp?cfile=htm/bc/110506.htm> - Mod.TG]\n\n[The interactive HealthMap/ProMED map for Victoria, Australia, is\navailable at: <http://healthmap.org/r/00I2> - CopyEd.EJP]\n\n....................sb/tg/ejp/mpp\n\n*##########################################################*\n************************************************************\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.

He said the 7 farms were still being\nquarantined but this would be reviewed after they\nreceived the results from Australia.\n\nCol Smith said the farms that were not being\nquarantined by their officers had been given 'the\ngreen light' to continue with their daily work.\nHe said this also included selling their cattle to other farms or customers.\n\n[Byline: Reijeli Kikau]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promedmail@promedmail.org>\n\n[These articles do not say if these are dairy\ncattle, but it is strongly likely they are dairy operations.\n\nDairy cattle infected with brucellosis can\ntransmit the disease to humans through the\nconsumption of raw or unpasteurized milk.\n\nThe disease in cattle, water buffalo, and bison\nis caused almost exclusively by _Brucella\nabortus_ ; however, _B suis_ or _B melitensis_ is\noccasionally implicated in some cattle herds. B\nsuis does not appear to be contagious from cow to\ncow. Infection spreads rapidly and causes many\nabortions in unvaccinated cattle. In a herd in\nwhich disease is endemic, an infected cow\ntypically aborts only once after exposure;\nsubsequent gestations and lactations appear normal.\n\nAfter exposure, cattle become bacteremic for a\nshort period and develop agglutinins and other\nantibodies; some resist infection and a small\npercentage of infected cows recover. A positive\nserum agglutination test usually precedes an\nabortion or a normal parturition but may be\ndelayed in approximately 15 percent of cows. The\nincubation period may be variable and is\ninversely related to stage of gestation at time\nof exposure. Organisms are shed in milk and\nuterine discharges, and the cow may become temporarily infertile.\n\nBacteria may be found in the uterus during\npregnancy, uterine involution, and infrequently,\nfor a prolonged time in the nongravid uterus.\nShedding from the vagina largely disappears with\nthe decrease of fluids following parturition.\nSome infected cows that previously aborted shed\nbrucellae from the uterus at subsequent normal\nparturitions. Organisms are shed in milk for a\nvariable length of time\u0097in most cattle for life.\n\nNatural transmission occurs by ingestion of\norganisms, which are present in large numbers in\naborted fetuses, fetal membranes, and uterine\ndischarges. Cattle may ingest contaminated feed\nand water, or lick contaminated genitals of other\nanimals. Venereal transmission by infected bulls\nto susceptible cows appears to be rare.\nTransmission may occur by artificial insemination\nwhen Brucella -contaminated semen is deposited in\nthe uterus but, reportedly, not when deposited in\nthe midcervix. _Brucellae_ may enter the body\nthrough mucous membranes, conjunctivae, wounds, or intact skin.\n\n_Brucellae_ have been recovered from fetuses and\nfrom manure that has remained in a cool\nenvironment for greater than 2 months. Exposure\nto direct sunlight kills the organisms within a few hours.\n\nEfforts are directed at detection and prevention\nbecause no practical treatment is available.\nEventual eradication depends on testing and\neliminating reactors. The disease has been\neradicated from many individual herds and areas\nby this method. Herds must be tested at regular\nintervals until 2 or 3 successive tests are negative.\n\nBecause organisms are shed in the milk,\nunpasteurized milk, and cheese represent a human\nhealth concern. Many individuals believe drinking\nunpasteurized milk is better for their health.\nDiseases that are not killed by pasteurization\nrepresent a risk to the consumer.

At this time, brucellosis is suspected\nbut it is NOT detected or confirmed.\n\nThe 2 slaughtered cows were classified as reactors on serological\ntests for brucellosis, meaning their status is brucellosis-suspect.\nThe remaining serum samples from these cows (no tissue samples were\ntaken) have been sent to the World Organization for Animal Health\n(OIE) reference laboratory for brucellosis which is located in the\nCanadian Food Inspection Agency's (CFIA) laboratory in Ottawa. Here,\nadditional laboratory investigations are being carried out on these\nsamples in order to further characterize the nature and cause of the\nserological test results obtained in the US.\n\nThe 2 herds from which the 3 suspect cows originated are quarantined\nwhile further investigations, including whole herd tests, are carried\nout in these herds. The purpose of these investigations is to\nascertain the true infection status of these herds 'and to establish\nthe absence or presence of brucellosis. An essential element of these\ninvestigations is a thorough examination of all possible routes by\nwhich these herds could have been exposed to _Brucella abortus_,\nincluding all trace-ins to these herds. Cattle removed from the herds\n(trace-outs) are being identified.\n\nThese 2 cattle herds are located very close to one another in\nsouthern BC and at a considerable distance from any known reservoirs\nof _B. abortus_ infection; and at an even greater distance from known\nreservoirs of _Brucella. suis_ infection (which could cause the\nobserved reactions). Canada has not practiced vaccination for\nbrucellosis for more than a decade; and import controls are in place\nto prevent the introduction of the disease from other countries.\n\nAlthough the last confirmed case of brucellosis in cattle in Canada\noccurred more than 20 years ago, Canada has maintained a high level\nof vigilance for this disease. Robust surveillance programs for\nbrucellosis have remained in place. These programs detect a small\nnumber of brucellosis suspect reactor cattle, not unlike these three\ncows, each year. Every finding of a suspect reactor under these\nprograms has triggered a comprehensive trace-back investigation of\nall herds associated with the reactor animal, similar to the\ninvestigations being undertaken for these three reactor cows. Since\n1989, each and every one of these investigations has confirmed the\nabsence of brucellosis infection in these herds and in Canadian\nlivestock.\n\nThe investigations into these 3 suspect reactor cows are being\nundertaken with the same diligence and thoroughness as is employed\nfor all suspect brucellosis investigations in Canada. The laboratory\ntests and field investigations that are required to definitively\nanswer the question 'has brucellosis been found in Canada?' are being\ncarried out as expeditiously as possible. I would be pleased to\nprovide an update once we have the answer.\n\n--\nMaria A. B.

He said preliminary\nresults could be completed by next week [week of 31 May 2010]. But\nmeanwhile, the agency continues investigating the movement of cattle\nto and from the farms in an effort to determine the origin of the\nbrucellosis.\n\nIt's not known why the disease would make a comeback after it was\nthought to have been eradicated 20 years ago. 'We worked very hard,\nprobably in the mid-1900s to the later 1900s, at eradicating\nbrucellosis from the Canadian herd and that was done through a\nslaughter and testing program,' Mr. Lehman said.\n\nPeople can contract undulant fever [brucellosis in humans] by\ndrinking unpasteurized milk from infected cows or through contact\nwith animal tissue during the slaughter process if good sanitary\nmeasures aren't used, Mr. Lehman said.\n\nSymptoms include joint and muscle pain.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Clearly the Canadians are doing a thorough epidemiological\ninvestigation to learn where the disease originated. They will be\ntesting the herd of origin and likely, any animals that have moved\ninto the herd or been removed from the herd (trace-ins and\ntrace-outs) in an effort to locate any nidus of infection within any\nother herds of contact.\n\nThe disease in cattle, water buffalo, and bison is caused almost\nexclusively by _Brucella abortus_ ; however, _B. suis or _B.\nmelitensis_ are occasionally implicated in some cattle herds. _B.\nsuis_ does not appear to be contagious from cow to cow. Infection\nspreads rapidly and causes many abortions in unvaccinated cattle. In\na herd in which the disease is endemic, an infected cow typically\naborts only once after exposure; subsequent gestations and lactations\nappear normal. After exposure, cattle become bacteremic for a short\nperiod and develop agglutinins and other antibodies; some resist\ninfection and a small percentage of infected cows recover. A positive\nserum agglutination test usually precedes an abortion or a normal\nparturition but may be delayed in about 15 per cent of cows. The\nincubation period may be variable and is inversely related to stage\nof gestation at time of exposure. Organisms are shed in milk and\nuterine discharges, and the cow may become temporarily infertile.\nBacteria may be found in the uterus during pregnancy, uterine\ninvolution, and infrequently, for a prolonged time, in the non-gravid\nuterus. Shedding from the vagina largely disappears with the decrease\nof fluids following parturition. Some infected cows that previously\naborted shed brucellae from the uterus at subsequent normal\nparturitions. Organisms are shed in milk for a variable length of\ntime -- in most cattle for life.\n\nNatural transmission occurs by ingestion of organisms, which are\npresent in large numbers in aborted fetuses, fetal membranes, and\nuterine discharges. Cattle may ingest contaminated feed and water, or\nlick contaminated genitals of other animals. Venereal transmission by\ninfected bulls to susceptible cows appears to be rare. Transmission\nmay occur by artificial insemination when _Brucella_ -contaminated\nsemen is deposited in the uterus but, reportedly, not when deposited\nin the mid-cervix. Brucellae may enter the body through mucous\nmembranes, conjunctivae, wounds, or intact skin.\n\nBrucellae have been recovered from fetuses and from manure that has\nremained in a cool environment for more than 2 months. Exposure to\ndirect sunlight kills the organisms within a few hours.\n\nBecause organisms are shed in the milk, unpasteurized milk, and\ncheese represent a human health concern. Many individuals believe\ndrinking unpasteurized milk is better for their health. Diseases that\nare not killed by pasteurization represent a risk to the consumer.\nBrucellosis in humans (undulant fever, Malta fever) causes malaise,\nfever, chills, sweats, headache, neck pain, low back pain, joint\npain, muscle pain, occasionally diarrhea, constipation, anorexia,\nweight loss, abdominal pain, weakness, irritability, insomnia, and\ndepression. Brucellosis has been called undulant fever because of its\nhabit of producing fever and signs that wax and wane over an extended\nperiod of time.\n\nPortions of this comment have been extracted from\n<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dbmd/diseaseinfo/Brucellosis_g.htm> and\nfrom\n<http://www.merckvetmanual.com/mvm/index.jsp?cfile=htm/bc/110502.htm&word=Brucellosis>.\n- Mod.TG]\n\n[British Columbia can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail\ninteractive map of Canada at\n<http://healthmap.org/r/01d5>. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ]", "summary": "A ProMED-mail post\n<http://www.promedmail.org>\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\n<http://www.isid.org>\n\nDate: Wed 26 May 2010\n Brucellosis in humans (undulant fever, Malta fever) causes malaise,\nfever, chills, sweats, headache, neck pain, low back pain, joint\npain, muscle pain, occasionally diarrhea, constipation, anorexia,\nweight loss, abdominal pain, weakness, irritability, insomnia, and\ndepression.

Over the last decade, cattle\ninfections have appeared in all 3 states bordering the park.\n\n'It's no longer appropriate to say bison and the supplemental feed\ngrounds are the only sources of contamination,' Cross said.\n\nCross was the lead author of a USGS study published online Friday [23\nApr 2010] by the Public Library of Science. Co-authored by\nresearchers from Wyoming Game and Fish, Montana State University and\nUSGS, the study was based on more than 6000 blood tests collected\nfrom Wyoming elk between 1991 and 2009.\n\nSince the testing began, Cross said disease rates increased\ndramatically in 2 'hot spots,' north of Dubois, Wyo. and northwest of\nCody, Wyo. Both of those areas are far from the state's 23 artificial\nfeeding grounds.\n\nThe study comes on the heels of another USGS report in March 2010\nthat found brucellosis rates on the rise across the region.\nPrevalence rates increased from between 0 percent and 7 percent in\n1991-1992, to between 8 percent and 20 percent in 2006-2007.\n\nWyoming's feeding grounds were established decades ago to keep elk\nseparate from cattle in the winter. By providing elk with a\nguaranteed food source, it was hoped they would not eat hay left out\nfor cattle. But the feeding grounds also facilitated the spread of disease.\n\nMontana does not allow feeding grounds. Yet state veterinarian Marty\nZaluski said the same problems result when large elk herds congregate\non private lands off-limits to hunters. Zaluski compared the trend\nwith colds and other viruses that spread quickly through facilities\nsuch as day-care centers. 'You put any animals in close\nconcentration, you're going to exacerbate these disease issues,' he said.\n\nRepresentatives of the cattle industry -- backed by members of the\nMontana Legislature -- have pushed for the state Livestock Department\nto take more control over elk management. They argue that would be\nthe only way to stem infections that can result in severe\nrestrictions against out-of-state cattle exports. Livestock officials\nso far have declined the calls to intervene, saying elk fall under\nthe jurisdiction of Montana Fish Wildlife and Parks.\n\nIn Wyoming, wildlife managers have driven down brucellosis rates for\nelk in some areas through a pilot program to capture, test and kill\ndisease-positive animals at 3 feeding grounds. Where those efforts\nwere successful, brucellosis exposure rates have dropped as low as 5\npercent. That's versus 35 percent or more historically, said Brandon\nScurlock with Wyoming Game and Fish. Expanding the program across the\nregion would carry a steep price tag. The 5-year pilot effort cost\nUSD 1.3 million and removed 197 brucellosis-positive elk. That comes\nout to about USD 6600 per animal.\n\n[Byline: Matthew Brown]\n\n--\nCommunicated by\nProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The current price of test and removal of elk may be more than\nranchers and the general public care to pay, as it would surely\ninfluence taxes in an economy that is already suffering a load.\nHowever, the price quoted in the article sounds about right for a\ncaptive elk, except those being bred for genetics of the rack.\n\nPerhaps it is not the elk that should be behind high fences but\nrather the cattle that are at risk. - Mod.TG]", "summary": "A ProMED-mail post\n<http://www.promedmail.org>\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\n<http://www.isid.org>\n\nDate: 24 Apr 2010\n Communicated by\nProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The current price of test and removal of elk may be more than\nranchers and the general public care to pay, as it would surely\ninfluence taxes in an economy that is already suffering a load.\n Co-authored by\nresearchers from Wyoming Game and Fish, Montana State University and\nUSGS, the study was based on more than 6000 blood tests collected\nfrom Wyoming elk between 1991 and 2009. \n\nIn Wyoming, wildlife managers have driven down brucellosis rates for\nelk in some areas through a pilot program to capture, test and kill\ndisease-positive animals at 3 feeding grounds.

The disease is highly infectious and can cause cattle to abort.\nIdaho State veterinarian Bill Barton said all animals in the herd have been\ntested and most results are back.\n\nThe department and the industry take a brucellosis finding seriously as\nanother finding in a separate herd would cause the state to lose its\nbrucellosis-free status, wreaking havoc on cattlemen's ability to market\ntheir animals. The industry lost its brucellosis-free status in January\n2006. Aggressive action saw the state regain its status in July 2007.\n\nAlthough another animal was found to be suspect for the disease discovered\nlast week, further testing confirmed it was not infected. The 2 positive\nanimals were found in a 600 head herd based in Rigby and assembled over the\nlast couple of years, Barton said.\n\nFurther testing was needed on the 1st animal, a 15 year old cow, because it\nwas vaccinated with an older vaccine that can show a false positive with\nthe standard blood test. 'The vaccine is the best we have, but at 15 years\nof age, immunity is waning a little bit,' Barton said. The older strain 19\nvaccine has about the same efficacy as the newer RB15 vaccine, but where\nit's been used, epidemiologist must take a milk sample and culture the\ntissue for a definitive diagnosis. All animals in the herd had been\nvaccinated as required by the state, Barton said.\n\nThe 1st positive finding came as a result of another animal from the herd\ntesting suspect at slaughter. 'All animals at the slaughter plant are\ninspected with a blood test,' Barton said. If one shows up positive or\nsuspect, all animals in the herd are tested. 'We are continuing our\ninvestigation as rapidly as possible,' he said. That entails not only\ntesting the herd, which is now complete, but also tracing animals to their\nherd of origin and testing those herds. Barton has confirmed that all\nanimals that left the herd were sold to slaughter.\n\nThat's good news in regard to any possible forward infection from the herd.\nThe question now is whether the herds where the animals originated are\ninfected. Barton is more of the mind that the infection came from wild elk\nor bison that the herd came in contact with.\n\nBrucellosis is prevalent in those wild animals in the Greater Yellowstone\nArea and the herd summers in the Teton Basin. Cattlemen in the West are\nanxiously awaiting Idaho's testing results.\n\nBrucellosis is one of a handful of bovine diseases that cause concerns when\nit comes to moving cattle from state to state, said Matt Byrne, vice\npresident of the California Cattlemen's Association. California is\nbrucellosis-free and cattle producers want it to stay that way, he said.\n'Hopefully we'll find that it is a localized incident and won't have an\nimpact on California,' he said.\n\nCalifornia has had its own infectious disease troubles with tuberculosis,\nwhich has infected 8 cows in the state since January 2008, according to the\nstate's Department of Food and Agriculture. About 419 000 head of cattle\nhave been TB tested, 2 herds depopulated and more than 8000 cattle killed\nas part of an ongoing investigation, the CDFA [California Department of\nFood and Agriculture] reports. The USDA last year [2008] stripped\nCalifornia of its tuberculosis-free status, causing cattle to have to be\ntested before they leave the state.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Idaho is located close to California, as can be seen on the map at\n<http://healthmap.org/r/010E>. Idaho and California have quite an exchange\nof goods from fruit to cattle, and even a migration of people between these\nstates.\n\nAccording to\n<http://www.aphis.usda.gov/animal_health/animal_dis_spec/cattle/downloads/rb51_vaccine.pdf>\nRB51 was licensed for use in 1996. So while this vaccine moved through\ntransition of being phased in while Strain 19 was being phased out, it is\nentirely possible that there is an aged cow that was vaccinated with Strain 19.\n\nStrain 19 vaccination was phased out because it created many false\npositives within the testing scheme, which was costly to producers. Now 13\nyears down the road, there are questions as to the long term efficacy of\nRB51 by some groups.\n\nThe disease in cattle, water buffalo, and bison is caused almost\nexclusively by _Brucella abortus_ ; however, _B. suis or B. melitensis_ are\noccasionally implicated in some cattle herds. _B. suis_ does not appear to\nbe contagious from cow to cow. Infection spreads rapidly and causes many\nabortions in unvaccinated cattle. In a herd in which the disease is\nendemic, an infected cow typically aborts only once after exposure;\nsubsequent gestations and lactations appear normal. After exposure, cattle\nbecome bacteremic for a short period and develop agglutinins and other\nantibodies; some resist infection and a small percentage of infected cows\nrecover. A positive serum agglutination test usually precedes an abortion\nor a normal parturition but may be delayed in about 15 per cent of cows.\nThe incubation period may be variable and is inversely related to stage of\ngestation at time of exposure. Organisms are shed in milk and uterine\ndischarges, and the cow may become temporarily infertile. Bacteria may be\nfound in the uterus during pregnancy, uterine involution, and infrequently,\nfor a prolonged time, in the non-gravid uterus. Shedding from the vagina\nlargely disappears with the decrease of fluids following parturition. Some\ninfected cows that previously aborted shed brucellae from the uterus at\nsubsequent normal parturitions. Organisms are shed in milk for a variable\nlength of time -- in most cattle for life.\n\nNatural transmission occurs by ingestion of organisms, which are present in\nlarge numbers in aborted fetuses, fetal membranes, and uterine discharges.\nCattle may ingest contaminated feed and water, or lick contaminated\ngenitals of other animals. Venereal transmission by infected bulls to\nsusceptible cows appears to be rare. Transmission may occur by artificial\ninsemination when _Brucella_ -contaminated semen is deposited in the uterus\nbut, reportedly, not when deposited in the mid-cervix. Brucellae may enter\nthe body through mucous membranes, conjunctivae, wounds, or intact skin.\n\nBrucellae have been recovered from fetuses and from manure that has\nremained in a cool environment for more than 2 months. Exposure to direct\nsunlight kills the organisms within a few hours.\n\nBecause organisms are shed in the milk, unpasteurized milk, and cheese\nrepresent a human health concern. Many individuals believe drinking\nunpasteurized milk is better for their health. Diseases that are not killed\nby pasteurization represent a risk to the consumer. Brucellosis in humans\ncauses malaise, fever, chills, sweats, headache, neck pain, low back pain,\njoint pain, muscle pain, occasionally diarrhea, constipation, anorexia,\nweight loss, abdominal pain, weakness, irritability, insomnia, and\ndepression. Brucellosis has been called undulating fever because of its\nhabit of producing fever and signs that wax and wane over an extended\nperiod of time.\n\nPortions of this comment have been extracted from\n<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dbmd/diseaseinfo/Brucellosis_g.htm> and from\n<http://www.merckvetmanual.com/mvm/index.jsp?cfile=htm/bc/110502.htm&word=Brucellosis>.\n- Mod.TG\n\nA map of Idaho can be found at\n<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:National-atlas-idaho.PNG>; its border\nwith California is at its lower (southern) edge on the left (west). - Mod.SH]", "summary": "A ProMED-mail post\n<http://www.promedmail.org>\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\n<http://www.isid.org>\n\nDate: Sun 13 Dec 2009\n Brucellosis in humans\ncauses malaise, fever, chills, sweats, headache, neck pain, low back pain,\njoint pain, muscle pain, occasionally diarrhea, constipation, anorexia,\nweight loss, abdominal pain, weakness, irritability, insomnia, and\ndepression.

His brucellosis was traced\nto him cleaning a feral hog in March 2009. He and his son butchered\none of the many feral hogs they had shot or trapped.\n\n'People need to know that they should be cautious when they handle\nthose pigs, and always wear gloves,' he said. 'I wouldn't want what's\nhappened to me to happen to anybody.'\n\nThe man faces months of more treatment for the disease, which is\ncaused by a bacterium linked to feral hogs. An estimated 2 million of\nthe wild creatures roam Texas. The Houston Chronicle reported Thursday\n[17 Sep 2009] that about 10 percent of Texas feral hogs test positive\nfor brucellosis bacteria, but the rate in eastern parts of the state\nhas been known to be higher. The disease can cause pregnant animals to\nprematurely abort their young.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n[The CDC, earlier in 2009, reported on similar cases in the\nsoutheastern USA. As an occupation-related disease, brucellosis can\nresult from the organism from diseased animals entering through skin\nlesions or mucous membranes, or from the inhalation of contamination\ndust or aerosols.\n\nInhalation is involved with many cases associated with abattoir\nworkers (1). Contamination of skin lesions is also common in meat\npacking workers or veterinarians. As in this cluster, hunters may be\ninfected through skin lesions or by accidental ingestion of bacilli\nduring or after cleaning moose, elk, or (as here) feral pigs.\n\nHistorically (2), Capasso found bone lesions typical of brucellosis in\nadult skeletal remains of people killed during the 1st volcanic surge\nof Mount Vesuvius.

Reports indicate the syndrome has been\noccurring since February 2009.\n\nPreliminary analysis for brucellosis of 2429 sera collected from 9\nherds in June 2009 by Rose Bengal test identified 236 strongly\nreactive sera from 6 of the herds tested. A sub-sample of RBT\nreactive sera was subsequently analysed with the assistance of the\nQueensland Department of Primary Industries in Australia by both CFT\nand ELISA for Brucella. Serology results were 35/50 sera positive by\nCFT (titres ranging from 1/16 to 1/4096) and 48/50 sera positive by ELISA.\n\nCulture results are currently pending. Further serological analysis\nis to be conducted. Pre-emptive slaughter of reactor cattle has been\nundertaken in a number of herds.\n\nInvestigation of the source of the outbreak is ongoing.

Infected animals have been detected in the\nagricultural enterprises 'Bakhcha,' Krasnoarmeysky district and\n'Turunovskiy,' Cheboksary district.\n\nAll cattle and small ruminants in the 2 facilities, over 200, have been\neliminated: 51 cattle and one horse (conditionally healthy animal, which\ndid not show positive tests for brucellosis) have been slaughtered at the\n'OAO Vurnarsky meat plant', while others have been recycled in the SUE\n'Tsivilsky vetsanutilzavod' plant. Note that the positive reactions to\nbrucellosis were detected in 40 sheep and 2 cows.\n\nBrucellosis in animals was recorded in March [2009], after a check-up in\nFebruary by experts of the Russian Federal Service for Veterinary and\nPhytosanitary Surveillance (Rosselkhoznadzor). It was revealed that on 25\nDec 2008, 150 [infected?] sheep for breeding were transported with an\ninvalid veterinary certificate from the agricultural production plant\n'Bakhcha' to 'Turunovskiy.' The veterinary certificate was 'backdated,'\navoiding the prescribed quarantine period at the location of origin, which\ninvolves diagnostic tests. In this connection, 149 sheep out of the 150\ntransported were put in quarantine, sampled, and positive brucellosis\nreactors discovered. Chuvashia had been regarded free of brucellosis for\nseveral decades and the 'Turunovskiy' plant did not keep sheep before;\ntherefore, other routes of disease introduction could be regarded improbable.\n\nAs to the way the disease penetrated the 'Bakhcha' enterprise, [the\nepidemiological investigation] revealed that sheep were introduced in 2005\nfrom 7 facilities in the Astrakhan, Yaroslavl, and Ivanovo regions with\nsevere violations of requirements of normative legal certificates of the\nRussian Federation in the field of veterinary science.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-RUS\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[In view of the available information, particularly the involvement of\nsheep, it may be assumed that the pathogen involved is _Brucella\nmelitensis_. Laboratory confirmation is anticipated, preferably with\ninformation on the serovar (there are 3 _B. melitensis_ serovars). The\nsevere zoonotic nature of _B. melitensis_ calls for caution in handling of\nthe infected animals and premises. Other domestic animals, including dogs,\nshould be tested as well; the pathogen mainly infects sheep and goats, but\noccasionally also cattle, camels, and dogs, and rarely horses and pigs.\nInfections in sheep and goats can spill over into wild ruminants.\n\n_B. melitensis_ is highly pathogenic for humans; this organism is\nconsidered the most severe human pathogen in the genus. Occupational\nexposure is seen in farmers, their family members, laboratory workers,\nveterinarians, and others who contact infected animals or tissues. Aborted\nfoeti and vaginal secretions are particularly rich in infective material.\nBrucellosis is one of the most easily acquired laboratory infections.\nPeople who do not work with animals or tissues usually become infected by\ningesting unpasteurized dairy products.\n\nThe application of recycling of the culled cattle is interesting; it is\nindicative of allowing the utilisation of cattle-derived meat and bone meal\nin Russia.

This organism can be found in vaginal discharges for 4\nto 6 weeks after an abortion. It is also shed in normal vaginal\nsecretions, particularly during estrus, as well as in milk. High\nconcentrations of _B. canis_ are found in semen for up to 2 months\nafter infection, and intermittent shedding of smaller quantities can\noccur for years. _B. canis_ is also found in urine, and low\nconcentrations of bacteria may be excreted in saliva, nasal and\nocular secretions, and feces.\n\nCanine brucellosis is usually introduced into a kennel in an infected\ndog or semen. This disease is controlled by sanitation and the\nremoval of infected dogs. Housing in individual cages reduces the\nspread of the organism.

Infection with _B. canis_ seems to require close contact with\ninfected dogs or contact with bacterial cultures. The virulence of\nthis organism for humans may be low. Approximately 30 cases have been\nreported worldwide since the 1960s. However, _B. canis_ infections\ncan be difficult to diagnose in humans and may be underreported. In\nsymptomatic cases, brucellosis is extremely variable and the clinical\nsigns may appear insidiously or abruptly.

So far, only wildlife\nnear Yellowstone have tested positive for brucellosis, Aasheim said. 'We\nhave not found brucellosis anywhere else,' he said.\n\nOfficials have known for years that elk carry the disease and can transmit\nit to cattle and bison. But after finding it in 2 different cattle herds\nduring the past year [2008], causing Montana to lose its brucellosis-free\nstatus, state wildlife experts have ramped up efforts to track the disease.\n\nSince 1981, FWP has tested nearly 7000 elk for brucellosis, mostly north\nand west of Yellowstone Park. But this year, after the National Veterinary\nService said elk were the likely culprits infecting cattle, FWP expanded\nefforts to collect blood samples from hunter-harvested elk in south western\nMontana. And the agency is working toward implementing better tracking\nsystems, Aasheim said, 'collaring another bunch of elk as we speak.'\n\nExisting tests show that up to 5 per cent of the elk grazing in and near\nthe park have been exposed to brucellosis. Fewer than half of those\ninfected are capable of passing it on, said state veterinarian Marty\nZaluski. But cattle ranchers, nervous about the disease, are asking the\nstate to increase elk-monitoring efforts, said Errol Rice, executive vice\npresident of the Montana Stockgrowers Association.\n\nBy better understanding the disease, the FWP aims to limit cattle-wildlife\ninteractions during late-winter and spring months when the potential for\ntransmission is highest, rather than targeting brucellosis-positive elk for\nremoval, Aasheim said. And although brucellosis may be more visible now\nwith increased testing, the threat to Montana cattle likely has not\nincreased, Aasheim said. 'I don't think the threat is any greater than it's\never been,' Aasheim said.\n\nWhile it's no surprise the disease popped up this week, Rice said ranchers\nneed to be vigilant and lobby the state to fund wildlife testing, to help\nensure cattle herds stay healthy. 'Just hunters alone are not going to be\nable to give adequate numbers,' Rice said. 'We can always do more.'\n\nOn Monday, the Montana Board of Livestock approved an 'action plan' to\nlimit transmission of the disease among cattle, requiring cattle in a\n7-county area considered high risk be tested, largely based on exposure to\nelk and bison. And Zaluski said the state's various efforts to halt the\ndisease are paying off. 'We've made a fair amount of progress in a short\namount of time,' Zaluski said. 'But we still have a way to go.'\n\nThe 2 elk killed on Tuesday were tested last spring [2008] and found to be\ncarrying the disease, but Montana wildlife officials waited until the\nanimals left the park before putting them down.\n\n[byline: Jessica Mayrer]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nHealthMap Alerts via ProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The disease is caused by a group of bacteria known scientifically as the\ngenus _Brucella_. 3 species of _Brucella_ cause the most concern: _B.\nabortus_, principally affecting cattle, bison, and cervids; _B. suis_,\nprincipally affecting swine and reindeer but also cattle and bison; and _B.\nmelitensis_, principally affecting goats but not present in the United\nStates. In the Greater Yellowstone Area, the bacterium of concern is _B.\nabortus_. In cattle and bison, the disease currently localizes in the\nreproductive tract discharges.\n\nThere is no effective way to detect infected animals by their appearance.\nThe most obvious signs in pregnant animals are abortion or birth of weak\ncalves. Milk production may be reduced from changes in the normal lactation\nperiod caused by abortions and delayed conceptions. Not all infected cows\nabort, but those that do usually abort between the 5th and 7th month of\npregnancy. Infected cows usually abort once, but a percentage will abort\nduring additional pregnancies, and calves born from later pregnancies may\nbe weak and unhealthy. Even though their calves may appear healthy,\ninfected cows continue to harbor and discharge infectious organisms and\nshould be regarded as dangerous sources of the disease. Other signs of\nbrucellosis include an apparent lowering of fertility with poor conception\nrates, retained afterbirths with resulting uterine infections, and\n(occasionally) enlarged, arthritic joints. organs and/or the udder.\nBacteria are shed in milk or via the aborted fetus, afterbirth, or other\nreproductive tract discharges.\n\nThe incubation period of brucellosis in cattle, bison, and other animals is\nquite variable ranging from about 2 weeks to 1 year and even longer in\ncertain instances. When abortion is the 1st sign observed, the minimum\nincubation period is about 30 days. Some animals abort before developing a\npositive reaction to the diagnostic test. Other infected animals may never\nabort.\n\nGenerally, infected animals that do not abort develop a positive reaction\nto the diagnostic test within 30 to 60 days after infection, although some\nmay not develop a positive reaction for several months to more than a year.\n\nRepeated attempts to develop a cure for brucellosis in animals have failed.\nOccasionally, animals may recover after a period of time. More commonly,\nhowever, only the signs disappear and the animals remain diseased. Such\nanimals are dangerous sources of infection for other animals with which\nthey associate.\n\nBrucellosis is commonly transmitted to susceptible animals by direct\ncontact with infected animals or with an environment that has been\ncontaminated with discharges from infected animals. Aborted fetuses,\nplacental membranes or fluids, and other vaginal discharges present after\nan infected animal has aborted or calved are all highly contaminated with\ninfectious brucella organisms. Cows may lick those materials or the genital\narea of other cows or ingest the disease-causing organisms with\ncontaminated food or water. Despite occasional exceptions, the general rule\nis that brucellosis is carried from one herd to another by an infected or\nexposed animal. This mode of transmission occurs when a herd owner buys\nreplacement cattle or bison that are infected or have been exposed to\ninfection prior to purchase. The disease may also be spread when wild\nanimals or animals from an affected herd mingle with brucellosis-free herds.\n\nThe presence of brucellosis in free-ranging bison and elk in Yellowstone\nNational Park and Grand Teton National Park threatens the brucellosis\nstatus of the surrounding states and the health of their livestock herds,\nwhich are free of the disease. Reintroduction of the disease into a\nbrucellosis-free state could have a serious economic impact on domestic\nlivestock markets and potentially threaten export markets. The US\nDepartment of Agriculture's (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection\nService (APHIS) is working cooperatively with other State and Federal\nagencies toward containing the spread of brucellosis from bison to domestic\nlivestock and eliminating the disease from the Yellowstone and Teton herds\nwhile maintaining viable free-roaming bison herds in the parks.\n\nThis comment has been extracted from\n<http://www.aphis.usda.gov/lpa/pubs/fsheet_faq_notice/faq_ahbrucellosis.html>\n- Mod.TG\n\nA map showing the State of Montana may be viewed at\n<http://www.infoplease.com/atlas/state/montana.html> - CopyEd.EJP]", "summary": "The US\nDepartment of Agriculture's (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection\nService (APHIS) is working cooperatively with other State and Federal\nagencies toward containing the spread of brucellosis from bison to domestic\nlivestock and eliminating the disease from the Yellowstone and Teton herds\nwhile maintaining viable free-roaming bison herds in the parks.

The government of Kyrgyzstan is well aware of the\nbrucellosis situation in animals and humans and is treating this as an\nurgent national issue.\n\nA national control program for brucellosis has been set in motion with\nmulti-donor assistance from the World Bank, the Swiss Development\nCooperation (SDC), the EU, the Swedish International Development Agency,\nand others. Kyrgyzstan is recognized as a country having one of the highest\nrates of brucellosis in animals and humans. Naryn has been the focus for\nmuch of the surveys and initial pilot work. Based on the results of the\ninitial survey work, the Government has instituted a national vaccination\nprogram in 2008 to control the disease at source in the livestock\npopulation. This has been combined with a public awareness campaign to\nimprove personal hygiene and prevent human exposure through direct contact\n(that is, during lambing, care after animals) or consumption of\ncontaminated food products.\n\nIt is likely that the 10 per cent incidence of brucellosis reported in\nhumans in the province of Naryn, and refuted by the Ministry of Health,\nactually refers to a 10 per cent Rose Bengal test [RBT] seroprevalence\nfound in small ruminants in a recent randomized survey of animals in 13\nvillages in Ak-Talaa, a district in Naryn. A seroprevalence of 1.7 per cent\nwas found in cattle. The final seroprevalence will depend on results of\nindirect ELISAs [enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay] on all RBT reactors.\n\nBrucellosis in humans in Naryn province during 11 months of 2-8 [?2008]\nappeared to be 151.3 per 100 000 population [from] recently conducted\n[studies] in the high risk area of Naryn [that is, the incidence of\nbrucellosis in Naryn is actually about 0.15 per cent instead of 10 per cent\nindicated in the ProMED-mail report]; the incidence of brucellosis in\nhumans has been stabilized and is reduced.\n\nThe Government of Kyrgyzstan takes this situation very seriously, is\ncommitted to a long term strategy for reducing the incidence of brucellosis\nin animals and humans, and has moved to a risk-based approach. This\nincludes high-coverage vaccination of small ruminants, control programs for\ncattle, awareness campaigns, and public involvement at the village level.\nIn fact, the brucellosis program has evolved from donor supported projects\nfor community and village health and also bird flu control and is an\nimportant part of the comprehensive approach to 'One Health'. This effort\nis coordinated through the deputy prime minister and with uniquely close\ncooperation between the MAWRPI [Ministry of Agriculture, Water Resources\nand Processing Industry] and the Ministry of Health for the control of\nzoonotic diseases. The program is also consistent with the Government's\nvery close collaboration with the OIE [World Organisation for Animal\nHealth] in upgrading its veterinary services to meet international\nstandards in accordance with its WTO [World Trade Organisation] commitments.\n\nIt should also be recognized that this work is being carried out during a\nvery difficult period of fiscal crisis and with considerable limitations on\nthe national budget and resources.\n\nNurlan Dyusheev\nFirst Deputy Director General of the State Veterinary Department\nMAWRPI [Ministry Agriculture, Water Resources and Processing Industry]\nKyrgyz Republic\nJalalidin Gaibulin\nDirector of the Centre of Quarantine and Dangerous Infection\nMoH [Ministry of Health]\nKyrgyz Republic\n\n--\nJoldoshbek Kasymbekov\nChief of the Information and Communication Unit\nState Veterinary Department (SVD)\n(MAWRPI)\nKyrgyz Republic\n<joldoshbekk@yahoo.com>\n\n[ProMED-mail thanks Nurlan Dyusheev, first deputy director general of the\nState Veterinary Department and Jalalidin Gaibulin, director of the Centre\nof Quarantine and Dangerous Infection of the Ministry of Health, Kyrgyz\nRepublic, for their clarification of the situation in Kyrgyzstan and\nexplanation of data presented in ProMED-mail posting archive 20090102.0010.\n- Mod.ML]", "summary": "Kyrgyz Republic\n<joldoshbekk@yahoo.com>\n\n[ProMED-mail thanks Nurlan Dyusheev, first deputy director general of the\nState Veterinary Department and Jalalidin Gaibulin, director of the Centre\nof Quarantine and Dangerous Infection of the Ministry of Health, Kyrgyz\nRepublic, for their clarification of the situation in Kyrgyzstan and\nexplanation of data presented in ProMED-mail posting archive 20090102.0010.

Brucellosis is transmitted to humans either by direct\ncontact with tissues of infected animals or their\npost-partum/post-abortion secretions, or by the ingestion of\ncontaminated, unpasteurized food products, mainly dairy products.\nDirect person-to-person transmission from an infected mother to infant\ncan occur by means of breast-feeding. Sexual transmission has also\nbeen reported. _B. melitensis_, which causes the most severe\ninfections in humans, is maintained in small ruminants (sheep and\ngoats), though cases in cattle and buffalo may occur sporadically. _B.\nabortus_ is maintained mainly in large bovines (cattle and buffalo).\nThe _Brucella_ species that are causing brucellosis in Kyrgyzstan are\nnot given in the news release.\n\nBrucellosis in humans causes fever, sweating, weakness, headaches,\ndepression, and muscle and joint pains, the duration of the which can\nvary from a few weeks to many months or even years. Mortality is low\n(less than 2 percent), and is usually associated with endocarditis.\nFocal complications include sacroiliitis, endocarditis,\nepididymoorchitis, and meningitis. Diagnosis is based on isolation of\nthe organism and/or serology.\n\nBrucellosis in humans can be prevented by eradication of brucellosis\nin animals and by pasteurization of milk. Brucellosis control\nprograms in animals involve test-and-slaughter, and/or vaccination.\n\n_Brucella_ can also be used as a bioweapon, in which the\nmicroorganism is delivered as an aerosol. An outbreak following\naerosolization would be initially difficult to detect because the\nearliest indications of infection are non-specific flu-like symptoms.\n\nThe current situation with brucellosis in Kyrgyzstan is likely a\ncontinuation of a prior outbreak that was noted in ProMED-mail post\narchive number 20060924.2725. In this post, Dr Steve Berger said\nthat: '[Kyrgyzstan] may have the highest rate of brucellosis in the\nworld.

In 1972, the USA Department\nof Agriculture National Brucellosis Eradication Program was expanded\nto cover swine herds. Subsequent elimination of brucellosis in\ncommercial swine resulted in a decrease in _B. suis_-associated\nillness in humans. Currently, swine-associated brucellosis in humans\nin the USA is predominantly associated with exposure to infected\nferal swine (i.e., wild boar or wild hogs), that is, swine that have\nlived any part of their lives as free-roaming animals.\n\nIn May and July 2008, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\n(CDC) was contacted by the state health departments in South Carolina\nand Pennsylvania regarding 2 cases of brucellosis possibly linked to\nferal swine hunts. Both state health departments contacted the state\nhealth department in Florida, where the hunts took place. The\nsubsequent investigation, conducted jointly by the 3 state health\ndepartments and the CDC, determined that the 2 patients had confirmed\nbrucellosis from _B. suis_ infection and the brother of 1 patient had\nprobable brucellosis. All 3 exposures were associated with feral\nswine hunting, and at least 2 patients did not have symptoms until\n4-6 months after exposure (Table [for table, see original URL -\nMod.LL]). The findings from this investigation suggest that\nclinicians treating patients with unexplained febrile illness should\nconsider brucellosis in the differential diagnosis and obtain a\nthorough history of travel (e.g., to enzootic areas), food\nconsumption, occupation, and recreational activities, including feral\nswine hunting. Cross-agency collaboration by state health departments\nand agriculture agencies is needed on brucellosis investigations to\nreduce the risk for illness through contact with infected animals.\n\nCase Reports\n------------\nPatient A. On 7 May 2008, a man aged 67 years from South Carolina\n(patient A) was referred by his private physician to a local\nemergency department after 1 week of fever (cyclic daily range: 99.2\ndegrees - 102.5 degrees F [37.3 degrees C - 39.2 degrees C]),\nmalaise, anorexia, painful swollen left knee, and headaches. Patient\nA had a left total knee arthroplasty in 2004 and uneventful treatment\nin 2005 for septic arthritis in the same knee. Before onset of\nsymptoms for his acute illness, patient A reported that he felt well\nexcept for an unintended 13 pound weight loss over a 16 week period\nand night sweats that began the day before he sought treatment. In\nthe emergency department, blood and synovial fluid were obtained for\nculture, and the patient was empirically treated with intravenous\nnafcillin for septic arthritis.\n\nThen, 2 days later, on 9 May 2009, the man was referred to a hospital\nwith chills, persistent fever, continuing left knee arthralgia, and\nedema. He was admitted with a diagnosis of left knee infection and\nsepsis and treated initially with vancomyin. Knee aspirate cell count\nresults were 16 700 white blood cells/cubic mm (normal: greater than\n150) and 1322 red blood cells/cubic mm (normal: greater than 1).\nSpecimens of blood and a knee aspirate were collected for culture.\nInitial microbiologic examination indicated _Corynebacterium\nurealyticum_. Upon infectious disease consultation, the patient was\nstarted on doxycycline and naprosyn; on 11 May 2009, he developed\nepididymo-orchitis and was changed to levofloxacin and daptomycin on\n12 May 2009 for a 6 week course. _Brucella spp._ subsequently were\nidentified from isolates from the blood and synovial specimens\ncollected from patient A on 7 May 2009. Isolates were sent to the\nSouth Carolina state public health laboratory and CDC for\nconfirmatory testing. On 29 May 2009, _B. suis_ biovar 1 was identified.\n\nThe epidemiologic investigation revealed that patient A had hunted\nferal swine in southwestern and south central Florida with 2\ncompanions during 23 - 29 Dec 2007. All participated in field\ndressing and butchering 8 or 9 feral swine at 2 locations. While\nfield dressing one of the swine, patient A cut his hand with a knife.\nNo personal protective equipment was worn during the field dressing\nand butchering. The meat was brought back to South Carolina, stored\nin a freezer, and boiled before being consumed by patient A over\nseveral months. No one else prepared or ate the meat, and no meat was\ncollected for testing. No other risk factors for brucellosis were identified.\n\nBecause patient A's hunting companions were well, serologic testing\nfor brucellosis was not performed. Patient A recovered with no\npermanent knee joint damage after antimicrobial therapy with\nlevofloxacin and daptomycin for 6 weeks.\n\nPatient B. On 14 Jul 2008, a previously healthy man aged 37 years\nfrom Pennsylvania (patient B) went to a local emergency department\nafter 1 week of morning fevers, chills, myalgia, shortness of breath,\nand night sweats. He also reported an unintended 30 pound weight loss\nover a 1 month period, beginning 3 weeks before illness onset. A\nblood chemistry profile was within normal limits with the exception\nof glucose of 121 mg/dL (normal: 74 - 100). A blood specimen for\nculture was obtained.\n\nClinical impression was acute viral syndrome; patient B was\ndischarged with instructions to use an albuterol metered-dose inhaler\n3 times daily for 1 - 2 days for his shortness of breath and to\nfollow up with his private physician in 2-3 days. On 23 Jul 2009, the\nPennsylvania state public health laboratory received patient B's\nblood specimen from the local hospital and isolated and identified\n_B. suis_ using Laboratory Response Network standardized biochemical\ntests and polymerase chain reaction.\n\nEpidemiologic investigation revealed that, on 29 Dec 2007, patient B\nhad hunted feral swine in Florida with his brother (patient C), a\nFlorida resident. Both men participated in field dressing and\nbutchering 4 feral swine. No personal protective equipment was worn\nduring these procedures, and no other risk factors for brucellosis\nwere identified. Patient B brought the meat back to Pennsylvania and\nstored it in a freezer. The meat was prepared and consumed by patient\nB and his family members over a 7 month period. According to patient\nB, the meat was cooked adequately (i.e., to an internal temperature\nof 160 degrees F [71.1 degrees C]).\n\nThe CDC received 3 _B. suis_ isolates for confirmation and further\nmolecular characterization. One isolate was from the blood of patient\nB, and the other 2 were recovered from frozen sausage and tenderloin\nof a feral swine from the 29 Dec 2009 hunt. All 3 _B. suis_ isolates\nwere analyzed at the CDC by molecular genotyping assay, using\nmultiple-locus variable-number tandem repeat analysis. The assay\nindicated that the 2 meat isolates had identical signatures at all of\nthe 15 genomic markers, and the patient B isolate matched the meat\nisolates at all but 1 of 15 markers, suggesting that the 3 isolates\nwere linked.\n\nPatient B reported that his wife and children were not ill; however,\nhis brother (patient C) had experienced similar symptoms in April\n2008. Although asymptomatic, initial serologic testing for\nbrucellosis was performed on all household family members, and no\nantibody elevation was noted. Patient B recovered after 6 weeks of\ntreatment with rifampin and doxycycline.\n\nPatient C. In August 2008, the Pennsylvania state health department\nreported the association between patient B's infection and feral\nswine hunting to the Florida state health department, which, on 21\nAug 2008, contacted patient C (patient B's brother who had\naccompanied him on feral swine hunts). At the time, neither patient C\nnor his family members reported experiencing symptoms of brucellosis.\nHowever, patient C recalled feeling ill in April 2008 with night\nsweats and shortness of breath. He did not seek treatment because he\nattributed his symptoms to a recent scorpion sting.\n\nOther than feral swine hunting, no other brucellosis risk factors\nwere identified for patient C. He reported that all the meat he\nreceived from the December 2007 feral swine hunts was either smoked,\nroasted, or barbequed and was consumed at one family cookout. On 12\nSep 2008, a serum specimen from patient C was tested at CDC for\nanti-Brucella antibodies using the Brucella microagglutination test.\nThe resulting immunoglobulin G titer of 1:640 met the case definition\nfor probable brucellosis.\n\nBecause patient C's family was well, serologic testing for\nbrucellosis was not performed. Treatment was recommended for patient\nC, but he was lost to follow-up.\n\nEditorial Note:\n---------------\nBrucellosis is a bacterial zoonotic infection usually caused by\n_Brucella abortus_, _B. melitensis_, _B. suis_, or rarely _B. canis_.\nHumans are infected through occupational or recreational exposure to\ninfected animals, inhalation of infectious aerosols, laboratory\nexposure (1), consumption of contaminated unpasteurized dairy\nproducts, or consumption of inadequately cooked contaminated meat.\nThe average incubation period for brucellosis is 2-10 weeks but, as\nseen in this report, can range to 6 months. Symptoms can be\nnonspecific and influenza-like: intermittent fever, chills, malaise,\ndiaphoresis, arthralgia, myalgia, headache, anorexia, and fatigue\n(2,3). Because of its nonspecific clinical syndrome, _B. suis_\ninfection likely is underreported. Clinicians should inquire about\ntravel, food consumption, occupation, and recreational activities\n(including feral swine hunting) of patients with nonspecific\ninfluenza-like symptoms with intermittent fever.\n\nPatient A likely was infected through the hand wound he acquired\nwhile field dressing feral swine. The investigations suggest that\npatient B and patient C also were infected during the field dressing\nor butchering process because family members consumed the meat and\nwere not affected clinically. Clinicians should order brucellosis\ntesting for persons who are symptomatic and have a history of feral\nswine hunting. Duration and type of therapy is dependent upon\nmultiple factors such as health status or age of patient and the\nmanifestation of disease. Untreated brucellosis can last from several\nweeks to several years. Chronic untreated brucellosis can lead to\nabscesses in the liver, spleen, heart valves, brain, or bone;\nosteoarticular complications; and, in rare cases, death (2,3).\n\nHuman brucellosis is a nationally notifiable disease in all 50\nstates, New York City, the District of Columbia, and all USA\nterritories except Puerto Rico. In 2007, 131 brucellosis cases were\nreported in the United States (Figure [for figure, see original URL -\nMod.LL]). States with the highest numbers of reported cases were\nCalifornia (33), Texas (25), and Florida (10) (4).\n\nFeral swine have been reported in 35 states (J. Corn, PhD, personal\ncommunication, Southeastern Cooperative Wildlife Disease Study,\n2009). The national feral swine population is estimated at\napproximately 4-5 million, with the largest populations in Texas (1.5\nmillion), California, Florida, and Hawaii. Serologic surveys have\ndetected endemic feral swine infection with _B. suis_ in 10 states\n(Arkansas, California, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Louisiana,\nMississippi, Missouri, South Carolina, and Texas) (5-9). Feral swine\nhunting is allowed in most states with feral swine presence, and most\nstates require some form of license to hunt feral swine. Out-of-state\nhunters, as in this report, often bring swine meat back to their home states.\n\nEfforts to prevent _B. suis_ infection should focus on education of\nhunters and partnerships between state and local public health,\nwildlife, and agricultural agencies, and sportsmen's associations.\nEducational materials for feral swine hunters should include\nrecommendations for safe field dressing, butchering, and cooking (9).\nAll human brucellosis cases should be investigated jointly by state\nhealth departments and agriculture agencies to determine the sources\nof infection and prevent further illness in humans.\n\nReferences\n----------\n1.

Patient C. In August 2008, the Pennsylvania state health department\nreported the association between patient B's infection and feral\nswine hunting to the Florida state health department, which, on 21\nAug 2008, contacted patient C (patient B's brother who had\naccompanied him on feral swine hunts). A ProMED-mail post\n<http://www.promedmail.org>\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\n<http://www.isid.org>\n\nDate: Thu 11 Jun 2009\n The\nsubsequent investigation, conducted jointly by the 3 state health\ndepartments and the CDC, determined that the 2 patients had confirmed\nbrucellosis from _B. suis_ infection and the brother of 1 patient had\nprobable brucellosis. On 7 May 2008, a man aged 67 years from South Carolina\n(patient A) was referred by his private physician to a local\nemergency department after 1 week of fever (cyclic daily range: 99.2\ndegrees - 102.5 degrees F [37.3 degrees C - 39.2 degrees C]),\nmalaise, anorexia, painful swollen left knee, and headaches. The assay\nindicated that the 2 meat isolates had identical signatures at all of\nthe 15 genomic markers, and the patient B isolate matched the meat\nisolates at all but 1 of 15 markers, suggesting that the 3 isolates\nwere linked. \n\nOther than feral swine hunting, no other brucellosis risk factors\nwere identified for patient C. He reported that all the meat he\nreceived from the December 2007 feral swine hunts was either smoked,\nroasted, or barbequed and was consumed at one family cookout. Currently, swine-associated brucellosis in humans\nin the USA is predominantly associated with exposure to infected\nferal swine (i.e., wild boar or wild hogs), that is, swine that have\nlived any part of their lives as free-roaming animals. In May and July 2008, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\n(CDC) was contacted by the state health departments in South Carolina\nand Pennsylvania regarding 2 cases of brucellosis possibly linked to\nferal swine hunts. \n\nClinical impression was acute viral syndrome; patient B was\ndischarged with instructions to use an albuterol metered-dose inhaler\n3 times daily for 1 - 2 days for his shortness of breath and to\nfollow up with his private physician in 2-3 days. All 3 exposures were associated with feral\nswine hunting, and at least 2 patients did not have symptoms until\n4-6 months after exposure (Table [for table, see original URL -\nMod.LL]). The investigations suggest that\npatient B and patient C also were infected during the field dressing\nor butchering process because family members consumed the meat and\nwere not affected clinically. Pennsylvania state public health laboratory received patient B's\nblood specimen from the local hospital and isolated and identified\n_B. suis_ using Laboratory Response Network standardized biochemical\ntests and polymerase chain reaction. On 14 Jul 2008, a previously healthy man aged 37 years\nfrom Pennsylvania (patient B) went to a local emergency department\nafter 1 week of morning fevers, chills, myalgia, shortness of breath,\nand night sweats. Before onset of\nsymptoms for his acute illness, patient A reported that he felt well\nexcept for an unintended 13 pound weight loss over a 16 week period\nand night sweats that began the day before he sought treatment. Upon infectious disease consultation, the patient was\nstarted on doxycycline and naprosyn; on 11 May 2009, he developed\nepididymo-orchitis and was changed to levofloxacin and daptomycin on\n12 May 2009 for a 6 week course. Humans are infected through occupational or recreational exposure to\ninfected animals, inhalation of infectious aerosols, laboratory\nexposure (1), consumption of contaminated unpasteurized dairy\nproducts, or consumption of inadequately cooked contaminated meat. \n\nEditorial Note:\n---------------\nBrucellosis is a bacterial zoonotic infection usually caused by\n_Brucella abortus_, _B. melitensis_, _ In\nthe emergency department, blood and synovial fluid were obtained for\nculture, and the patient was empirically treated with intravenous\nnafcillin for septic arthritis. Symptoms can be\nnonspecific and influenza-like: intermittent fever, chills, malaise,\ndiaphoresis, arthralgia, myalgia, headache, anorexia, and fatigue\n(2,3). Sir David Bruce 1st\nisolated the organism associated with Maltese (or Malta) fever from a\nBritish soldier who died in 1887 and the organism was eventually\nnamed in his honor. Feral swine\nhunting is allowed in most states with feral swine presence, and most\nstates require some form of license to hunt feral swine. \n\nEpidemiologic investigation revealed that, on 29 Dec 2007, patient B\nhad hunted feral swine in Florida with his brother (patient C), a\nFlorida resident. \n\nThe epidemiologic investigation revealed that patient A had hunted\nferal swine in southwestern and south central Florida with 2\ncompanions during 23 - 29 Dec 2007. One isolate was from the blood of patient\nB, and the other 2 were recovered from frozen sausage and tenderloin\nof a feral swine from the 29 Dec 2009 hunt. \n\nPatient B reported that his wife and children were not ill; however,\nhis brother (patient C) had experienced similar symptoms in April\n2008. \n\nFeral swine have been reported in 35 states (J. Corn, PhD, personal\ncommunication, Southeastern Cooperative Wildlife Disease Study,\n2009). Clinicians should order brucellosis\ntesting for persons who are symptomatic and have a history of feral\nswine hunting. Serologic surveys have\ndetected endemic feral swine infection with _B. suis_ in 10 states\n \n\nEfforts to prevent _B. suis_ infection should focus on education of\nhunters and partnerships between state and local public health,\nwildlife, and agricultural agencies, and sportsmen's associations. Zygmont SM, Nettles VF, Shotts EB, et al: Brucellosis in wild\nswine: a serologic and bacteriologic survey in the southeastern\nUnited States and Hawaii. All human brucellosis cases should be investigated jointly by state\nhealth departments and agriculture agencies to determine the sources\nof infection and prevent further illness in humans. \n\nThen, 2 days later, on 9 May 2009, the man was referred to a hospital\nwith chills, persistent fever, continuing left knee arthralgia, and\nedema. Cross-agency collaboration by state health departments\nand agriculture agencies is needed on brucellosis investigations to\nreduce the risk for illness through contact with infected animals. Stoffregen WC, Olsen SC, Wheeler CJ, et al: Diagnostic\ncharacterization of a feral swine herd enzootically infected with\nBrucella. The national feral swine population is estimated at\napproximately 4-5 million, with the largest populations in Texas (1.5\nmillion), California, Florida, and Hawaii. _Brucella spp._ subsequently were\nidentified from isolates from the blood and synovial specimens\ncollected from patient A on 7 May 2009. Subsequent elimination of brucellosis in\ncommercial swine resulted in a decrease in _B. suis_-associated\nillness in humans. In 1972, the USA Department\nof Agriculture National Brucellosis Eradication Program was expanded\nto cover swine herds. Knee aspirate cell count\nresults were 16 700 white blood cells/cubic mm (normal: greater than\n150) and 1322 red blood cells/cubic mm (normal: greater than 1). promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[As an occupation-related disease, infection can result from the\norganism from diseased animals through skin lesions or mucous\nmembranes or from the inhalation of contamination dust or aerosols. \n\nHuman brucellosis is a nationally notifiable disease in all 50\nstates, New York City, the District of Columbia, and all USA\nterritories except Puerto Rico. According to patient\nB, the meat was cooked adequately (i.e., to an internal temperature\nof 160 degrees F [71.1 degrees C]). Patient A recovered with no\npermanent knee joint damage after antimicrobial therapy with\nlevofloxacin and daptomycin for 6 weeks. Duration and type of therapy is dependent upon\nmultiple factors such as health status or age of patient and the\nmanifestation of disease. Historically (2), Capasso found bone lesions typical of brucellosis\nin adult skeletal remians of people killed during the 1st volcanic\nsurge of Mount Vesuvius. In 2007, 131 brucellosis cases were\nreported in the United States (Figure [for figure, see original URL -\nMod.LL]). Although asymptomatic, initial serologic testing for\nbrucellosis was performed on all household family members, and no\nantibody elevation was noted. As in this cluster, hunters may be\ninfected through skin lesions or by accidental ingestion of bacilli\nduring or after cleaning moose, elk or (as here) feral pigs. No personal protective equipment was worn\nduring these procedures, and no other risk factors for brucellosis\nwere identified. Chronic untreated brucellosis can lead to\nabscesses in the liver, spleen, heart valves, brain, or bone;\nosteoarticular complications; and, in rare cases, death (2,3). \n\nMicrobiologically, classical biovar typing methodology is\ntime-consuming, poorly standardized, and required high-level\nbiosafety containment. Isolates were sent to the\nSouth Carolina state public health laboratory and CDC for\nconfirmatory testing. All 3 _B. suis_ isolates\nwere analyzed at the CDC by molecular genotyping assay, using\nmultiple-locus variable-number tandem repeat analysis. From the discovery\nof the Malta fever's agent to the discovery of a marine mammal\nreservoid, brucellosis has continuously been a re-emerging zoonosis. Typing the 4 biovars of _B. suis_ involves\nhydrogen sulfide production, growth in dyes, bacteriophage\nsusceptibility and agglutination with biovar-specific antisera. To\nsimplify this process, real-time polymerase chain reaction technology\nlooking at single nucleotide polymorphism can be used (3).", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "brucellosis", "rabies"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["1972-03-24 00:00:00", "2009-05-29 00:00:00", "2007-03-24 00:00:00", "2006-03-24 00:00:00", "2008-08-24 00:00:00", "2004-03-24 00:00:00", "1887-03-24 00:00:00", "2007-12-24 00:00:00", "2021-03-01 00:00:00", "1905-03-24 00:00:00", "2008-04-24 00:00:00", "2009-05-24 00:00:00", "2008-05-07 00:00:00", "2009-05-09 00:00:00", "2009-03-24 00:00:00", "1322-03-24 00:00:00", "2021-05-09 00:00:00", "2009-12-24 00:00:00", "2009-05-11 00:00:00", "2008-08-21 00:00:00", "2008-07-14 00:00:00", "2005-03-24 00:00:00", "2009-05-07 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "PENNSYLVANIA", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Georgia", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Malta", "country": "Malta"}, {"location": "Louisiana", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Minnesota", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Arkansas", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Humphrey P", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Florida", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "the United States", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Washington", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "South Carolina", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Puerto Rico", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Queeenland", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Philadelphia", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Texas", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Mississippi", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Pennsylvania", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "DC", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Missouri", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "USA", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Indiana", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "United States", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Hawaii", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "the District of Columbia", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "US", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "New York City", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "California", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "118656", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Brucellosis, porcine - Romania: OIE", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=118656", "date": "2008-10-11 11:00:32", "main_text": "BRUCELLOSIS, PORCINE - ROMANIA: OIE\n***********************************\nA ProMED-mail post\n<http://www.promedmail.org>\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\n<http://www.isid.org>\n\nDate: Fri 10 Oct 2008\nSource: OIE's WAHID interface [edited]\n<http://www.oie.int/wahid-prod/public.php?page=single_report&pop=1&reportid=7410>\n\n\nBrucellosis (Brucella suis) in Romania\n--------------------------------------\nInformation received on 10 Oct 2008 from Dr. Stefan Nicolae,\nDirecteur General, Direction Generale, Autorite Nationale Sanitaire\nVeterinaire pour la Securite des Aliments (ANSVSA), Bucuresti, Romania\n\nSummary\nReport type: Immediate notification\nStart date: 15 Jul 2008\nDate of first confirmation of the event: 08 Oct 2008\nReport date: 10 Oct 2008\nDate submitted to OIE: 10 Oct 2008\nReason for notification: Reoccurrence of a listed disease\nDate of previous occurrence: 2006\nCausal agent: _Brucella suis_\nNature of diagnosis: Laboratory (advanced)\nThis event pertains to a defined zone within the country\n\nNew outbreaks\nOutbreak 1: Fantanele, Fantanele, CONSTANTA [see map at the above URL]\nDate of start of the outbreak: 15 Jul 2008\nOutbreak status: Continuing (or date resolved not provided)\nEpidemiological unit: Farm\nAffected animals\nSpecies/ Susceptible/ Cases/ Deaths/ Destroyed/ Slaughtered\nSwine/ 22 232/ 1284/ 0/ 0/ 0\nAffected population: swines in a comercial farm\nSummary of outbreaks\nTotal outbreaks: 1\nOutbreak statistics\nSpecies/ Apparent morbidity rate/ Apparent mortality rate/ Apparent\ncase fatality rate/\nSwine/ 5.78 percent/ 0.00 percent/ 0.00 percent\n\nEpidemiology\nSource of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: Unknown or inconclusive\n\nControl measures\nMeasures applied\n- Stamping out\n- Quarantine\n- Movement control inside the country\n- Screening\n- Disinfection of infected premises/establishment(s)\n- Vaccination prohibited\n- No treatment of affected animals\n\nMeasures to be applied: No other measures\n\nDiagnostic test results\nLaboratory name and type: Institute for Diagnosis and Animal Health\n(National laboratory)\nTests and results\nSpecies/ Test/ Test date/ Result\nSwine/ bacteriological examination/ 08 Oct 2008/ Positive\n\nFuture Reporting\nThe event is continuing.

He also warned that the number of unregistered infected people\nis estimated to be 3 times higher. Data for the other Bosnian entity,\nRepublika Srpska, was not immediately available, but brucellosis has\nbeen seen as a growing problem there as well.\n\nWith more than 30 infections per 100 000 residents, Bosnia's\nFederation entity has seen the greatest share of brucellosis\ninfections than any other European country, Puvacic said.\n\nBrucellosis is carried by domestic and wild animals and can spread to\nhumans who work with animals or eat meat which was not properly\ncooked.\n\nIn addition to hundreds of registered human cases, tens of thousands\nof cases of brucellosis have been registered among domestic animals\nin Bosnia over the past few years.\n\nBosnia is especially susceptible to this and other infectious\ndiseases transmitted by animals because of the weak capacity of its\nhealth and veterinary services, but also because of a complex\nadministrative setup which prevents cooperation among different\nsectors and administrative units. As a result, many infected humans\nand animals are diagnosed late. Farmers often have to wait for weeks,\neven months for the culling of infected domestic animals, which are\nthen sometimes inappropriately disposed of.\n\nIn humans, brucellosis induces inconstant fevers, sweating, weakness,\nanemia, headaches, depression and muscular and bodily pain but is\nusually not fatal. It is treatable with antibiotics, although it can\ntake weeks, even months to recover.\n\nIn October 2008, the World Bank announced the launch of a new project\naimed at improving the country's technical and administrative\ncapacity to fight infectious diseases, including bird flu.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The current outbreak of brucellosis in Bosnia and Herzegovina was\npreviously noted in ProMED post Brucellosis - Bosnia & Herzegovina\n20080523.1696.

Indeed, the species _Brucella ovis_,\n_Brucella neotomea_ and _Brucella microti_ are not regarded as human\npathogens, and within the _Brucella suis_ species, _B. suis_ biovar 2\nhas been reported to infect humans only in very rare instances, for\nexample, if they are immuno-compromised.

The Missaukee,\nOsceola, Wexford, and Van Buren county kennels have been quarantined\nand MDA is in the process of notifying purchasers.\n\nCanine brucellosis is a contagious bacterial disease that causes\nabortions, death of puppies shortly after birth, and chronic health\nproblems in older dogs. Canine brucellosis is a reportable disease\nand an emerging concern in dog breeding facilities and 'puppy mills'\nin Michigan. There is no vaccine for the disease and no long-term\ncure. Antibiotics will control the infection and spaying dogs will\nminimize the risk of transmission to almost zero.\n\nCB is considered a zoonotic disease, even though the risk of actual\nhuman infection from a pet is very low. Although people can get CB\nfrom infected pets, transmission is very rare. It is mostly\ntransmitted through handling birthing tissues from an infected dog,\nalthough it can be transmitted in water and food dishes, in urine,\nand in feces. Even though most dog infections generally do not result\nin human illness, people with weakened immune systems are more\nsusceptible and should not handle dogs known to be infected with\ncanine brucellosis. There is also a higher risk to people working in\ninfected kennels.\n\nMDA has limited information that CB might be present in other canine\npopulations. An individual in Macomb County adopted a rescued dog\nfrom an animal shelter. The recently spayed female dog had signs of\nillness and the owner brought it to her veterinarian. The dog was\ntested and found positive for CB. The veterinarian treated the dog\nwith a course of antibiotics. The dog is home and is not considered\ninfectious.\n\nTo limit the potential spread of infection, the state veterinarian\nstrongly recommends pet shops purchasing puppies for resale require\nthe kennel of origin to provide evidence that all animals are tested\nnegative for brucellosis. This includes puppies from kennels in other\nstates.\n\nThe state veterinarian also recommends sexually intact dogs from\nunknown backgrounds, adopted or rescued from animal shelters, be\nscreened for canine brucellosis. Note that state law requires adopted\ndogs and cats to be spayed and neutered by the new owners, so we have\na public health safeguard.\n\nMDA actions to contain canine brucellosis:\n1. The breeding kennels have been quarantined and depopulated at the\nowner's expense, or are on a test-and-remove program. With\ntest-and-remove, the kennel remains quarantined, with no sales\nallowed, until there is no infection.\n2. When possible, people who purchased or traded dogs from these\nkennels have been contacted. We are contacting families in the\nvicinities of infected breeding kennels as some neighbors' dogs were\nallowed to breed at the kennels. Unfortunately, some of the kennel\noperators do not have complete records, so the following additional\nsteps will be taken.\n3. We are asking veterinarians statewide to be on heightened alert\nfor CB in small, mixed breed, and pure bred small dogs from shelters.\nThe Michigan Veterinary Medical Association (MVMA) is assisting MDA\nby contacting practicing veterinarians.

That\nwould mean additional testing requirements for Wyoming cattle before\nthey're sold or transported across the state line.\n\nBut ranchers throughout western Wyoming must already submit cattle to\nadditional testing because they're in a brucellosis surveillance area.\n\n'We have to test in order to sell breeding livestock,' said a\nDaniel-area rancher. 'We are not the same as the rest of the state.\nWe are currently under restriction, and we don't have the same rights\nas everybody else in the state.'\n\nState Veterinarian Walt Cook has asked the federal government to\nextend its slaughter deadline until later this fall [2008], when the\n11 other herds that have had contact with the infected herd can be\ntested. The USDA [US Department of Agriculture] rejected Cook's\ninitial request for an extension, and he has appealed that decision.\n\nAnother Daniel-area rancher, said by refusing to extend the deadline\nfor the rancher to make his decision, the federal government is\npressuring the rancher to slaughter his breeding cattle.\n\n'They're trying to force him. They're trying to make it so bad he'll\nhave to slaughter,' [he] said. 'The guy's worked on those cows for\nyears. It's a high-altitude herd. These cattle have been acclimated\nto this area. So why should he have to start all over again? He's\nchoosing between 2 evils.'\n\nLivestock officials point out the rancher could preserve some of that\nbreeding effort through 'test and slaughter' - testing his cattle and\nkilling only those that test positive.\n\nThe program would take at least one year to complete. In the\nmeantime, Wyoming would lose its brucellosis-free status.\n\nThe state will also lose its status if another Wyoming herd tests\npositive for brucellosis within 2 years.\n\n[A] Wheatland cattle rancher, said he would support the rancher if he\ndecided not to slaughter his breeding cattle, even though that would\nadd a burden to his own operation.\n\n'It's a genetic base he's been working on for generations of cattle.\nHe's been selecting and raising his cattle according to what he sees\nas most fit for his environment and the customer,' [the cattle\nrancher] said. 'If he were to depopulate, he'd liquidate that genetic\nbase that he's been building for years. I understand very much his reluctance.'\n\n[The cattle rancher] said he believes the USDA's Animal and Plant\nHealth Inspection Service [APHIS] has given the rancher an\nunwarranted ultimatum by holding fast to its 29 Aug [2008] slaughter deadline.\n\n'Brucellosis isn't like foot-and-mouth or other highly contagious\ndiseases,' [he] said. 'When it has been quarantined, there isn't any\ndanger to public health, or the health of the national cattle herd.'\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The state of Wyoming, in the western United States, can be located\non the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at\n<http://healthmap.org/promed?v=40,-97.6,4>.\n\nThe Greater Yellowstone Area includes Montana, Wyoming, and Idaho; it\ncan be seen on the map at <http://gorp.away.com/gifs/states/wy/m_gryel2.gif>.\n\nThe article makes good points in that the disease is contagious\nbetween animals, but certainly not in the same rapid fashion as\nfoot-and-mouth disease (FMD). Even in the FMD outbreak in the UK in\n2001 the aspect of valuable genetics of animals was an issue.\n\nGiven the genetics of the animals and the disease not having the same\nspread capacity as FMD, and the fact that Wyoming is already under\nsurveillance, it would seem prudent on the part of USDA to allow a\nlittle more time for consideration on the issue. After all, this is\nlikely many years of work and it being the only herd, it is not\npresently urgent to depopulate.\n\nIt is gratifying to see fellow producers encouraging more time and\nunderstanding that the best way for this owner may not be\ndepopulation and their support of him.\n\nIt is understandable that USDA would like to eliminate this domestic\nnidus of infection, but until the Greater Yellowstone Area is free of\nthe disease, situations like this may offer perhaps even next year.\n\nThe disease in cattle, water buffalo, and bison is caused almost\nexclusively by _Brucella abortus_ ; however, _B. suis or B.\nmelitensis_ are occasionally implicated in some cattle herds. _B.\nsuis_ does not appear to be contagious from cow to cow. Infection\nspreads rapidly and causes many abortions in unvaccinated cattle. In\na herd in which disease is endemic, an infected cow typically aborts\nonly once after exposure; subsequent gestations and lactations appear\nnormal. After exposure, cattle become bacteremic for a short period\nand develop agglutinins and other antibodies; some resist infection\nand a small percentage of infected cows recover. A positive serum\nagglutination test usually precedes an abortion or a normal\nparturition but may be delayed in about 15 percent of cows. The\nincubation period may be variable and is inversely related to stage\nof gestation at time of exposure. Organisms are shed in milk and\nuterine discharges, and the cow may become temporarily infertile.\nBacteria may be found in the uterus during pregnancy, uterine\ninvolution, and infrequently, for a prolonged time, in the non-gravid\nuterus. Shedding from the vagina largely disappears with the decrease\nof fluids following parturition. Some infected cows that previously\naborted shed brucellae from the uterus at subsequent normal\nparturitions. Organisms are shed in milk for a variable length of\ntime -- in most cattle for life.\n\nNatural transmission occurs by ingestion of organisms, which are\npresent in large numbers in aborted fetuses, fetal membranes, and\nuterine discharges. Cattle may ingest contaminated feed and water, or\nlick contaminated genitals of other animals. Venereal transmission by\ninfected bulls to susceptible cows appears to be rare. Transmission\nmay occur by artificial insemination when _Brucella_ -contaminated\nsemen is deposited in the uterus but, reportedly, not when deposited\nin the mid-cervix. Brucellae may enter the body through mucous\nmembranes, conjunctivae, wounds, or intact skin.\n\nBrucellae have been recovered from fetuses and from manure that has\nremained in a cool environment for more than 2 months. Exposure to\ndirect sunlight kills the organisms within a few hours.\n\nBecause organisms are shed in the milk, unpasteurized milk and cheese\nrepresent a human health concern. Many individuals believe drinking\nunpasteurized milk is better for their health. Diseases that are not\nkilled by pasteurization represent a risk to the consumer.\nBrucellosis in humans is not a pleasant disease.\n\nSigns and symptoms in people include malaise, fever, chills, sweats,\nheadache, neck pain, low back pain, joint pain, muscle pain,\noccasionally diarrhea, constipation, anorexia, weight loss, abdominal\npain, weakness, irritability, insomnia, and depression.

Two cattle from the rancher's\nseparate purebred Angus herd were determined earlier this month [June\n2008] to have the disease, which can cause pregnant cows to abort\ntheir young. The remaining 250 or so Angus cattle will be tested next\nweek, Logan said. Once the entire herd is tested, the state will\nbegin testing surrounding herds belonging to other ranchers.\n\nWhile the state has confirmed the presence of brucellosis, the\nfederal government was still conducting tests to make the\nconfirmation official.\n\nWyoming is in danger of losing its brucellosis-free status if the\ndisease is found in another herd or if the Daniel rancher declines to\nslaughter his entire herd.\n\nSchwartz said it's 'fairly high,' but not alarming to have 15 cattle\nin the herd test positive for brucellosis.

A zoonotic disease, it can be passed to\nhumans through unpasteurized dairy products and contact with birthing\nfluids from an infected animal.\n\nMontana had been brucellosis-free since 1985, but the disease was\ndiscovered in a Bridger cattle herd in May of 2007.

The disease is brucellosis. The cow was in Paradise Valley. In\nMay 2008, it tested positive for the disease that causes cows to abort. The\ncase will cause Montana to lose its federal designation as brucellosis-free.\n\n'The big unknown is what will be the impact on the marketplace here in\nMontana,' said Dennis McDonald, former president of the Montana Cattlemen's\nAssociation. 'None of us know for sure. It'll be a financial burden. It's a\nquestion to what extent.'\n\nWhat it means is that all of Montana's livestock producers will now be\nrequired to test bulls and cows, unspayed and 18 months old or older a\nmonth before interstate shipment. Montana cattle ranchers who want to ship\nor move their stock will have to prove to the US Department of Agriculture\n(USDA) that the animals do not have _Brucella abortus_ bacterium, the\ncausative agent of the disease.\n\n'It's an enormous amount of work,' McDonald said. Montana veterinarian\nMarty Zaluski said the loss of brucellosis-free status is particularly\nfrustrating given efforts by livestock producers and the industry to\nmitigate risks and increase disease surveillance.\n\n'Producers in the Paradise Valley have been involved and diligent, and they\nhave taken it upon themselves to be proactive in regard to managing the\nrisk of brucellosis transmission,' Zaluski said. 'In this particular case,\nthe owner did everything right. The cow had been vaccinated twice and was\npart of a herd management plan.'\n\nOfficials will test to track the cause of the disease in the Paradise\nValley animal. The last case was linked to elk, Zaluski said.\n\nAbout a year ago, the disease was discovered in a Bridger cattle herd. Two\nherds, totaling 585 animals were killed to limit the spread of the disease.\nTo keep its brucellosis-free status from the USDA, the state would have had\nto have no cases until July 2009. Previously, Montana livestock had been\nfree of the disease since 1985.\n\nThe soonest the state can apply to regain class free status is a year from\nthe date the last positive animal was killed, which will be 27 May next\nyear [2009].\n\nAll other animals in the herd where the sick cow was found have tested\nnegative for brucellosis. Herds with links to the herd where the infected\ncow was found will be placed under quarantine unless, or until, they are\nwhole-herd tested. McDonald of the Cattlemen's Association said the 2nd\ncase does not come as a surprise. 'I'm only surprised it took as long as it\ndid,' he said. 'It's obvious that park wildlife is a reservoir of brucellosis.'\n\nMcDonald said the National Park Service has not made any significant\nefforts to curb the spread of the disease, which he was careful not to\nblame on bison. McDonald advocated for vaccination 'We need funds for more\nresearch into a better vaccine. We need a plan to vaccinate wildlife in a\nmanner that's least destructive to their lives and ecosystems,' McDonald said.\n\nPlus, he said, the area near Yellowstone National Park needs to be treated\ndifferently than the rest of the state. Gov Schweitzer agreed. Montana\nneeds 'split-state' status, he said, so cattle ranchers across the state\nwon't be affected by cases near Yellowstone.\n\nSchweitzer has been advocating for a different brucellosis management\nstrategy near the park since taking office. He called for a small, separate\nmanagement zone -- termed 'split-state status' by USDA -- for the area\nimmediately surrounding the park. Only about 5 per cent of the state's\ncattle would have been affected by the USDA action.\n\n'Let's not play the blame-game,' McDonald said. 'Let's roll up our sleeves\nand figure out the next step.'\n\n[byline: Robert Struckman]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail rapporteur Brent Barrett\n\n[For cattle owners this becomes an economic burden.

Human\nbrucellosis represents a professional hazard, being acquired via\ningestion, inhalation in laboratories or abattoirs, conjunctiva and\nskin trauma contamination with infected animal tissues and products\n(1,2). Symptoms can appear as acute or insidious onset, after 5 to 60\ndays and last for days, months and occasionally as long as a year.\nRelapses can also occur. Treatment is effective with antibiotics.\nUntreated brucellosis can lead to death (case-fatality ratio around 2\npercent), usually by heart complications.\n\nEpidemiological situation in Greece\n-----------------------------------\nBetween 2000 and 2007, the mean yearly incidence rate of brucellosis\nin Greece was 2.9/100 000 population. The annual incidence rate shows\na decreasing tendency: 5 in 2000, 3.7 in 2001, 3 in 2002, 2.2 in\n2003, 2.1 in 2004, 3.1 in 2005, 2.6 in 2006, and 1.38 in 2007. The\ndata indicate that the disease mainly affects rural areas of the\nmainland, all cases either engaged in a high-risk occupation\n(shepherds, workers in animal husbandry, vets) or sharing\nunpasteurized milk or dairy products with friends and relatives (3-5).\n\nStrict regulation in Greece only permits the circulation in the\nmarket of licensed producers' fully processed milk and its products\n(either pasteurized or cheese matured for at least 3 months before\nconsumption) and Human Public Health and Veterinary Public Health\nauthorities in all prefectures of the country ensure implementation\nby performing regular inspections in all restaurants, hotels,\ncatering establishments and other settings. During the summer months,\nthe Ministry of Health and Social Solidarity (MHSS) reinforces more\nfrequent inspections for the prevention of all foodborne diseases,\nincluding brucellosis.\n\nThe majority of islands, including Thassos of Kavala mainland\nPrefecture, are free from human cases and herds are considered\nbrucellosis-free, with serology conducted sporadically that prove\nthis. The Ministry of Rural Development and Food (MRDF), regularly\nprovides these results to the Hellenic Center for Disease Control and\nPrevention (HCDCP) and the MHSS, both of which it collaborates with\nclosely. All animals are tested before importation to the islands, so\nno brucellosis vaccination is conducted thereafter. On the other\nhand, in mainland Greece the brucellosis control program includes\nvaccination of herds and regular testing for brucellosis.\n\nOutbreak in Thassos\n-------------------\nNo cases of human brucellosis were reported in Thassos in 2007 or\nduring the 1st quarter of 2008, until early May 2008, when a\nconsiderable number of cases were notified to the Department of\nEpidemiologic Surveillance and Intervention, of the HCDCP MHSS (Table\n1 [for tables, see original URL - Mod.LL]). The onset of symptoms of\nthe 1st case was 1 Apr 2008. As of 17 Jun 2008, 55 human cases have\nbeen reported: 53 had consumed unpasteurized milk and/or dairy\nproducts (Figure 1 [for figures, see original URL - Mod.LL]): 8 had a\nhigh-risk profession (6 herd owners and 2 butchers), and 9 had had\nsystematic contact with sheep and/or goats. A total of 50 cases and 5\ncases were permanent residents of Thassos and Kavala respectively,\nthe age ranging from 8 to 88 years old, with a median of 46 years,\nsparing only 0-4 years old (Figure 2); 26 cases were male, 29 female.\n\nLaboratory results\n------------------\nAll cases reported tested positive for brucellosis (Standard\nAgglutination Test), except for 1 patient who met the clinical and\nepidemiological criteria while the laboratory result was pending when\nreported. 8 were asymptomatic while testing positive, 6 of whom\nreported consumption of non-pasteurized milk/dairy products, and 2\nreported their husbands' illness and high-risk profession.\n\nThere is a widespread custom among local residents of Thassos of\nconsuming unpasteurized milk and its products around Easter-time in\ntheir households. This does not affect tourists from Greece or abroad\nvisiting the island.\n\nControl measures\n----------------\nThere is a a standard procedure of close cooperation between the\nHuman Public Health (HPH) and Veterinary Public Health (VPH)\nofficials at the local level in the Prefectures of Greece, under the\nconstant supervision of the Unit for Zoonoses and Foodborne Diseases,\nof the HCDCP-MHSS, and the Ministry of Rural Development and Food.\nMore specifically, once the HPH is informed by physicians of the\nNational Health System (general practicioners, internists,\npediatricians) of a single human brucellosis case, they define the\nanimals or flock linked in any way with the patient and immediately\nprovide this information to the Veterinary Public Health office so\nthat brucellosis serology and/or testing of milk and its products are\nconducted in the veterinary reference laboratories. If indicated, the\nherd immediately undergoes all measures indicated by the brucellosis\neradication and control programme operating in Greece. A spontaneous\nsharing of all data has been established across the country among\nlocal HPH, VPH authorities, HCDCP, and the General Veterinary\nDirectorate, MRDF.\n\nSoon after the 1st human case was notified early in May 2008 in\nThassos, the above spontaneous usual procedures resulted in positive\nherd serologies. The HPH officials, being aware of the local habit,\ndistributed advice to all health authorities, and to all residents,\ndoor to door, suggesting the destruction of any improperly processed\nmilk products in households.\n\nCurrently, the slaughter of seropositive animals and vaccination has\nbeen applied to all herds of the island, which is the control program\nalready operating across mainland Greece (6), and this will continue\nuntil the island is again free of brucellosis.\n\nCoordinated HPH and VPH inspections in all restaurants, groceries,\nhotels, and other settings proved that only licensed products were\ncirculated in the market. A rapid telephone survey with a structured\nquestionnaire was conducted by the Unit for Zoonoses and Foodborne\nDiseases, HCDCP, and all interviewed cases confirmed that these\nhousehold products were not offered to any tourist in any setting.\n\nWork on a case control study has been initiated and is scheduled to\ntake place shortly.\n\nConclusions\n-----------\nBrucellosis is a disease of public health priority in Greece. The HPH\nand VPH authorities (7) at the central and local levels have a close\ncollaboration and integration, aiming at the target of eradicating\nthe disease which, judging by both reported cases and comments from\nleading hospitals? microbiologists, is thought to be in decline\nregarding annual incidence in the country. According to the\ninformation we have on this outbreak at the time of writing, it is\nunlikely that any tourists were exposed to brucellosis on Thassos. In\naddition, the public health measures applied after this local\noutbreak ensure that there is no future risk for tourists visiting the island.\n\n1. Young EJ: Brucella species.

The\ndisease can cause cows to abort, deliver weak calves, or produce less milk.\nCattle brucellosis is a zoonotic disease (can be spread from animals to\nman) that caused significant human disease incidence until the eradication\nprogram reduced the incidence of the disease in cattle, and, sanitary\npractices and pasteurization procedures for milk were implemented to reduce\ntransmission to humans. All other states in the United States are\nclassified brucellosis-free, some for more than 25 years.\n\n'Texas was the last state to achieve the 'free' status. We have more herds\nand more cattle than any other state -- 14 million at last count. We also\nhad more brucellosis infection to fight. In 1959, when Texas officially\njoined the national eradication program, we had more than 20 000 of the\ncountry's 100 000 infected herds,' said Dr Bob Hillman, Texas' state\nveterinarian and head of the Texas Animal Health Commission (TAHC), the\nstate's livestock and poultry health regulatory agency. 'This victory for\nthe cattle industry did not come easily or without hardship,' said Dr\nHillman. 'For many cattle producers in the early days of the program, it\nmeant losing a herd with only salvage value payment, or having the herd\nunder quarantine and being unable to sell animals for long periods of time.\nSome producers' herds became re-infected. In recent years, infected herds\nwere purchased from owners and depopulated whenever possible, to quickly\nwipe out infection.'\n\nDr Hillman credited the 2006 Brucellosis Eradication Working Group with\nre-evaluating all aspects of the Texas brucellosis program, in preparation\nfor the USDA review, which was conducted in summer 2007. The group was\ncomprised of about 25 cattle industry members. 'I also want to thank TAHC\nand USDA staff for their long days of testing cattle, consulting with\nproducers, keeping detailed test records, and handling tense situations\nwhen herds had to be quarantined. The efforts by the industry, the TAHC and\nUSDA have brought us to a great place -- disease eradication.\n\n'Now we must ensure that the disease is not reintroduced, or if it is\nlingering undetected, we must find the infection and eradicate it quickly.\nIf 2 infected herds are detected within the next 2 years, we could lose\nthis hard-earned, well-deserved status, so we must do everything to protect\nthe health of our herds,' said Dr Hillman.\n\n'To this end, we must continue testing our cattle at the first-point of\nconcentration and change of ownership for the next couple of years,' said\nDr Hillman. 'This procedure is part of the national brucellosis program\nstandard and was included in the program as a means of assuring that states\nthat have just acquired free-status could identify infected herds should\nthe disease have been left undetected in a herd or is re-introduced into a\nstate. Additionally, brucellosis slaughter surveillance will continue for\nmany years to come to assure that the disease is completely eradicated from\ncattle herds in Texas and other states of the United States.'\n\n'Decades of hard work are now paying off with this incredible\naccomplishment. I commend the cattle industry of the state and the Texas\nAnimal Health Commission for working together to establish Texas as cattle\nbrucellosis-free,' Texas agriculture commissioner Todd Staples said.\n\n'Texas ranks first in the nation in the number of cattle and calves and the\nindustry is a USD 16 billion business for the Texas economy. This new\nstatus will positively improve the industry and help our dedicated cattle\nproducers,' commissioner Staples said.\n\n'Hearing the words 'cattle brucellosis-free' is music to the industry's\nears,' said Mr Ernie Morales, chairman of the Texas Animal Health\nCommission (TAHC). 'While in the short term we will have to continue\ntesting our cattle, there is a tremendous benefit for cattle producers to\nbe able to market their cattle as cattle from a brucellosis-free state.\nThis status designation will provide cattle producers and trading partners\nadditional assurance that Texas cattle do not pose a disease risk.'\n\n'This tremendous achievement could not have been accomplished without the\ncombined efforts of state and federal agencies and industry,' said Bruce\nKnight, under secretary for USDA's marketing and regulatory programs\nmission area. The interim rule declaring Texas as brucellosis free was\npublished in the 1 Feb 2008 Federal Register and became effective upon\npublication.\n\n'We must now focus our efforts on eradicating brucellosis from the\nfree-ranging elk and bison populations in the Greater Yellowstone Area in\norder to protect our national cattle herd against future outbreaks of this\ndisease,' said Under Secretary Knight. He said the presence of brucellosis\nin free-ranging bison and elk in Yellowstone National Park and Grand Teton\nNational Park still threatens cattle health in surrounding states.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nCarla Everett\n<ceverett@tahc.state.tx.us>\n\n******\n[2]\nDate: 1 Feb 2008\nSource: North Texas e-News [edited]\n<http://www.ntxe-news.com/artman/publish/article_43544.shtml>\n\n\nAgriculture Commissioner Todd Staples has received notice from the US\nDepartment of Agriculture that Texas has been declared brucellosis-free.\nThis news means for the first time in the 74-year history of the\nbrucellosis program, all 50 states, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands\nhave simultaneously achieved Class Free status.\n\n'Today is a landmark day for the nation's number one cattle state.

There is no known treatment for brucellosis, and\ndepopulation of infected and exposed animals is the only effective means of\ndisease containment and eradication.\n\nThere are 14 million head of cattle in Texas, more than half of the state's\npeople population and cattle production is the number one agriculture\ncommodity in Texas in terms of cash receipts. Bottom line, the cattle\nindustry is big business in Texas.\n\n'The Texas cattle industry is a USD 16 billion business for the Texas\neconomy. This new brucellosis-free status will positively improve the\nindustry and help our dedicated cattle producers,' commissioner Staples said.\n\nThis is historic news but the work is not over. Brucellosis-free status is\nbased on a state finding no known brucellosis in cattle for 12 months.

But the\nItalian papers say the local vets who are supposed to test and put\ndown infected animals have been intimidated by the local mafia -- the\nCamorra -- who also control some of the farms. Consequently, it is\nreported, the disease has been allowed to spread to almost 30 percent\nof the herd.\n\nCaserta, one of 2 key mozzarella-producing areas, is the worst\naffected.

The Minnesota Department of Health (MDH)\ncontacted CDC regarding this suspected multistate cluster of\nlaboratory-acquired brucellosis. MDH and the Indiana State Department\nof Health (ISDH) asked CDC to conduct further testing on _Brucella_\nisolates suspected of causing the infections and to provide\nrecommendations for appropriate response by the laboratories. This\nreport summarizes the investigation conducted jointly by MDH, ISDH,\nand CDC, provides guidance on safe laboratory handling of _Brucella\nspp._, and makes recommendations for responding to _Brucella_\nlaboratory exposures. The results of that investigation determined\nthat 146 workers at the 2 laboratories had been exposed to and that,\nalthough 2 _Brucella_ isolates had been handled by both laboratories,\ninfections in the 2 microbiologists were caused by 2 unrelated\nisolates. Because _Brucella spp._ pose a risk for aerosol-transmitted\ninfection, CDC recommended risk assessment for all Brucella-exposed\nlaboratory workers, postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) for those at high\nrisk, surveillance for symptoms of disease, and serologic follow-up\nwith workers. The events in Indiana and Minnesota emphasize the\nimportance of adhering to recommended biosafety practices, timely\nsharing of information regarding laboratory exposures, and rapid\nimplementation of response protocols.\n\nCase Reports\n-------------\nIndiana: On 28 Sep 2006, a microbiologist aged 47 years\n(microbiologist A) who worked at a clinical laboratory had onset of\nhigh fever, sweating, malaise, anorexia, headache, and hip pain.\nInitially, her symptoms were not severe; she did not seek medical\ntreatment until 3 weeks later, after her symptoms had progressively\nworsened. The microbiologist was hospitalized on 22 Oct 2006 and\nrecovered fully with treatment. On 26 Oct 2006, an unidentified blood\nculture isolate from microbiologist A (isolate A) was submitted for\nidentification to a Minnesota clinical laboratory and determined to\nbe _Brucella spp._; both MDH and IDSH were notified of the finding.\nEpidemiologic investigation later revealed that, on 17 Jul 2006,\nmicrobiologist A had subcultured on an open laboratory bench an\nunidentified isolate (isolate C) from a referring laboratory. Isolate\nC subsequently was forwarded for identification to the same Minnesota\nclinical laboratory and identified as _Brucella spp_.\n\nMinnesota: On 25 Oct 2006, a microbiologist aged 61 years\n(microbiologist B), who worked at the same Minnesota clinical\nlaboratory that received microbiologist A's isolate, had onset of\nlow-grade fever, fatigue, and night sweats. She was hospitalized and\nrecovered with treatment. On 9 Nov 2006, the Minnesota laboratory\nidentified a blood culture isolate from microbiologist B (isolate B)\nas _Brucella spp._ and notified MDH. The subsequent investigation\ndetermined that microbiologist B had not handled isolate A from\nmicrobiologist A. However, previously she had handled on an open\nbench 2 unidentified isolates subsequently identified as _Brucella\nspp_. Her 1st exposure had occurred on 21 Jul 2006 while she was\nhandling isolate C, which had been forwarded from the Indiana\nclinical laboratory. The 2nd exposure had occurred on 8 Aug 2006\nduring testing of an isolate from a Texas referring clinical\nlaboratory (isolate D).\n\nInvestigation and Response\n--------------------------\nThe investigation revealed that all potentially implicated specimens\nor isolates had been manipulated on an open bench, the routine\npractice for handling unidentified isolates in these laboratories. No\nspills or aerosol-generating procedures had occurred. Neither\nlaboratory had formal protocols for 1) notification and follow-up of\nstaff members who worked with isolates identified as _Brucella spp._\nor 2) notification of laboratories that forwarded isolates later\nidentified as _Brucella spp_.\n\nBrucella-exposed workers (any person present in the microbiology\nlaboratory from the time the culture was first manipulated until all\nculture isolates were destroyed or removed from the laboratory) from\neach laboratory were identified, and their exposures were classified\nas either high risk or low risk.\n\nA high-risk exposure was defined as 1) having direct personal\nexposure (e.g., sniffing bacteriologic cultures; direct skin contact;\npipetting by mouth; inoculation; or spraying into the eyes, nose, or\nmouth), 2) performing work on an open bench (i.e., outside of\nbiosafety level 3 containment equipment) with an open culture plate\ncontaining a _Brucella_ isolate or being in close proximity to such\nwork (e.g., across an open bench top or within 5 feet), or 3)\npresence in the laboratory during any procedure conducted on a\n_Brucella_ isolate that might result in generation of aerosolized\norganisms and inhalational exposure (e.g., vortexing or catalase\ntesting). A low-risk exposure was defined as being present in the\nlaboratory during an exposure but not meeting the definition for a\nhigh-risk exposure.\n\nIn Indiana, 105 staff members were exposed; 15 of those exposures\nwere classified as high risk, including the exposure of\nmicrobiologist A. In Minnesota, 41 staff members were exposed; 13 of\nthose exposures were classified as high risk, including the exposure\nof microbiologist B. All staff members classified with high-risk\nexposure, other than the 2 microbiologists who received antimicrobial\ntherapy, were advised to receive post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP).\n\nTo determine the source of the _Brucella_ infections, CDC compared\nblood culture isolates from the microbiologists with the isolates\nthey handled, using multiple-locus variable number tandem repeats\nanalysis at 21 genomic regions. All isolates were identified as\n_Brucella melitensis_ biovar 3. Matching of 16 genomic amplicons\nsuggested that isolate C was the source of infection for\nmicrobiologist A, the Indiana microbiologist. Matching of 17 genomic\namplicons suggested that isolate D was the source of infection for\nmicrobiologist B, the Minnesota microbiologist.\n\nSerial serum samples from the 105 exposed Indiana laboratory staff\nmembers, excluding microbiologist A, were tested at CDC for\nanti-_Brucella_ antibodies, using the Brucella microagglutination\ntest (BMAT); the Minnesota laboratory conducted voluntary serial BMAT\ntesting for 11 exposed laboratory staff members. No additional\ninfections were detected in either group.\n\n[Reported by: Griffith J, Sullivan M, Howell J, et al]\n\nEditorial Note\n--------------\nBrucellosis is a bacterial zoonotic infection usually caused by\n_Brucella abortus_, _B. melitensis_, _B. suis_, or less commonly by\n_B. canis_. Humans usually are infected by occupational exposure to\ninfected animals, consumption of unpasteurized dairy products from\ninfected animals, or inhalation of infectious aerosols. The average\nincubation period for brucellosis is 2-10 weeks but ranges from a few\ndays to 6 months. Symptoms include intermittent fever, chills,\nmalaise, sweating, joint and lower back pain, headache, anorexia, and\nfatigue (1). Untreated brucellosis can last from several weeks to\nseveral years. Chronic untreated brucellosis can lead to abscesses in\nthe liver, spleen, heart valves, brain, or bone; osteoarticular\ncomplications; and, in rare cases, death. A definitive diagnosis\nrequires that bacteria be cultured from clinical specimens. A\npresumptive diagnosis requires demonstrating high or rising titers of\nspecific antibodies in the serum (1).\n\nSince 1986, fewer than 150 cases of brucellosis have been reported\nannually in the USA (2; CDC, unpublished data, 2007). However,\nbrucellosis is among the most commonly reported laboratory-acquired\nbacterial infections (3). In a review of laboratory-associated\ninfections during 1979-1999, _Brucella spp._ accounted for\napproximately 8 percent of all laboratory infections, 16 percent of\nbacterial infections, and 4 percent of deaths (4). Infections have\noccurred from sniffing culture plates, spilling blood-culture\nbottles, mucocutaneous exposure to sprays of organism-containing\nsuspensions, aerosol generation from ruptured centrifuge tubes, or\nroutine laboratory work with _Brucella_ cultures outside of\nbiological safety cabinets (5-9).\n\nBiosafety level 3 (BSL-3) practices, containment equipment, and\nfacilities are recommended for all manipulations of _Brucella_\ncultures (Box 1, for boxes, see original URL. - Mod.LL) (10). Because\nunidentified isolates are commonly manipulated on an open bench,\ninadvertent exposure can occur when _Brucella_ unexpectedly grows in\na culture. A formal notification and response protocol must be used\nafter identification of _Brucella spp_. Timely identification,\nnotification, and appropriate follow-up of potentially exposed\nworkers, in combination with worker training to maximize awareness\nand observance of appropriate safety practices, can prevent\nunnecessary illness and hospitalization from brucellosis. Exposures\ncan be minimized by clinicians and forwarding laboratories clearly\nidentifying specimens they suspect to be _Brucella_.\n\nOnce _Brucella_ has been identified (or is highly suspected),\nclinical laboratories should notify the state health department and\nsend the isolate to the state public health laboratory or nearest\nLaboratory Reference Network laboratory for confirmation and species\nidentification. When _Brucella_ is confirmed, the state public health\nlaboratory should notify all other laboratories that handled the\nspecimen, and exposure to workers should be assessed at the\nsubmitting laboratory and other laboratories involved.\n\nClassification of exposures as high risk or low risk by practitioners\nof occupational health, infection control, or public health\ndetermines PEP recommendations. PEP is recommended for persons with\nhigh-risk exposure (Box 2, for boxes, see original URL, but primarily\ndoxcycline and rifampin for 3 weeks. - Mod.LL). Serologic follow-up\nfor exposed persons using quantitative assays (e.g., BMAT) should be\nperformed at the time of exposure and at weeks 2, 4, 6, and 24 after\nexposure. Active, regular (e.g., weekly) surveillance for symptoms\nconsistent with brucellosis should be conducted for all exposed\nlaboratory workers for 6 months after exposure. PEP and monitoring\ndiffer for persons exposed to _B. abortus_ RB51, an attenuated\nveterinary vaccine strain that is less commonly associated with human\nillness, is rifampin resistant in vitro, and does not elicit a\nmeasurable serologic response using available tests. Laboratory\nworkers who might have been exposed to _Brucella_ and who have\nunexplained febrile illness consistent with brucellosis should be\nreferred to health-care providers for evaluation. Evaluation should\ninclude blood culture and anti-_Brucella_ antibody serologic testing,\nand treatment for brucellosis should be initiated when compatible\nillness is confirmed.\n\n_Brucella spp._ are dangerous infectious bacteria listed among CDC's\ncategory B bioterrorism agents. CDC and the Animal and Plant Health\nInspection Service (APHIS) regulate the transfer, possession, or use\nof such agents in the USA. New isolations, laboratory exposures, and\nother incidents associated with the intentional or unintentional\nrelease of _B. abortus_ (excluding RB51), _B. melitensis_, or _B.\nsuis_ must be reported as soon as possible to either CDC or APHIS.\nPersons seeking assistance in identifying _Brucella spp._ or\nserologic monitoring of exposed persons should contact their state\nhealth departments or the CDC Bacterial Zoonoses Branch at telephone,\n404-639-1711.\n\nReferences\n----------\n1.

In Indiana, 105 staff members were exposed; 15 of those exposures\nwere classified as high risk, including the exposure of\nmicrobiologist A. In Minnesota, 41 staff members were exposed; 13 of\nthose exposures were classified as high risk, including the exposure\nof microbiologist B. All staff members classified with high-risk\nexposure, other than the 2 microbiologists who received antimicrobial\ntherapy, were advised to receive post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP). Infections have\noccurred from sniffing culture plates, spilling blood-culture\nbottles, mucocutaneous exposure to sprays of organism-containing\nsuspensions, aerosol generation from ruptured centrifuge tubes, or\nroutine laboratory work with _Brucella_ cultures outside of\nbiological safety cabinets (5-9). \n\nBrucella-exposed workers (any person present in the microbiology\nlaboratory from the time the culture was first manipulated until all\nculture isolates were destroyed or removed from the laboratory) from\neach laboratory were identified, and their exposures were classified\nas either high risk or low risk.

The results of that investigation determined\nthat 146 workers at the 2 laboratories had been exposed to and that,\nalthough 2 _Brucella_ isolates had been handled by both laboratories,\ninfections in the 2 microbiologists were caused by 2 unrelated\nisolates. _ pose a risk for aerosol-transmitted\ninfection, CDC recommended risk assessment for all Brucella-exposed\nlaboratory workers, postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) for those at high\nrisk, surveillance for symptoms of disease, and serologic follow-up\nwith workers. The subsequent investigation\ndetermined that microbiologist B had not handled isolate A from\nmicrobiologist A. However, previously she had handled on an open\nbench 2 unidentified isolates subsequently identified as _Brucella\nspp_. This\nreport summarizes the investigation conducted jointly by MDH, ISDH,\nand CDC, provides guidance on safe laboratory handling of _Brucella\nspp._, and makes recommendations for responding to _Brucella_\nlaboratory exposures. Timely identification,\nnotification, and appropriate follow-up of potentially exposed\nworkers, in combination with worker training to maximize awareness\nand observance of appropriate safety practices, can prevent\nunnecessary illness and hospitalization from brucellosis.

When _Brucella_ is confirmed, the state public health\nlaboratory should notify all other laboratories that handled the\nspecimen, and exposure to workers should be assessed at the\nsubmitting laboratory and other laboratories involved. : On 25 Oct 2006, a microbiologist aged 61 years\n(microbiologist B), who worked at the same Minnesota clinical\nlaboratory that received microbiologist A's isolate, had onset of\nlow-grade fever, fatigue, and night sweats. In a review of laboratory-associated\ninfections during 1979-1999, _Brucella spp._ accounted for\napproximately 8 percent of all laboratory infections, 16 percent of\nbacterial infections, and 4 percent of deaths (4). On 26 Oct 2006, an unidentified blood\nculture isolate from microbiologist A (isolate A) was submitted for\nidentification to a Minnesota clinical laboratory and determined to\nbe _Brucella spp._; both MDH and IDSH were notified of the finding. Serologic follow-up\nfor exposed persons using quantitative assays (e.g., BMAT) should be\nperformed at the time of exposure and at weeks 2, 4, 6, and 24 after\nexposure. \n\nTo determine the source of the _Brucella_ infections, CDC compared\nblood culture isolates from the microbiologists with the isolates\nthey handled, using multiple-locus variable number tandem repeats\nanalysis at 21 genomic regions. Laboratory\nworkers who might have been exposed to _Brucella_ and who have\nunexplained febrile illness consistent with brucellosis should be\nreferred to health-care providers for evaluation. New isolations, laboratory exposures, and\nother incidents associated with the intentional or unintentional\nrelease of _B. abortus_ (excluding RB51), _B. melitensis_, or _B.\nsuis_ must be reported as soon as possible to either CDC or APHIS. The events in Indiana and Minnesota emphasize the\nimportance of adhering to recommended biosafety practices, timely\nsharing of information regarding laboratory exposures, and rapid\nimplementation of response protocols. MDH and the Indiana State Department\nof Health (ISDH) asked CDC to conduct further testing on _Brucella_\nisolates suspected of causing the infections and to provide\nrecommendations for appropriate response by the laboratories. Because\nunidentified isolates are commonly manipulated on an open bench,\ninadvertent exposure can occur when _Brucella_ unexpectedly grows in\na culture. Persons seeking assistance in identifying _Brucella spp._ or\nserologic monitoring of exposed persons should contact their state\nhealth departments or the CDC Bacterial Zoonoses Branch at telephone,\n404-639-1711. Evaluation should\ninclude blood culture and anti-_Brucella_ antibody serologic testing,\nand treatment for brucellosis should be initiated when compatible\nillness is confirmed. --------------\nBrucellosis is a bacterial zoonotic infection usually caused by\n_Brucella abortus_, _B. melitensis_, _B. suis_, or less commonly by\n_B. canis_. Epidemiologic investigation later revealed that, on 17 Jul 2006,\nmicrobiologist A had subcultured on an open laboratory bench an\nunidentified isolate (isolate C) from a referring laboratory. A low-risk exposure was defined as being present in the\nlaboratory during an exposure but not meeting the definition for a\nhigh-risk exposure. On 9 Nov 2006, the Minnesota laboratory\nidentified a blood culture isolate from microbiologist B (isolate B)\nas _Brucella spp._ and notified MDH. The 2nd exposure had occurred on 8 Aug 2006\nduring testing of an isolate from a Texas referring clinical\nlaboratory (isolate D). Active, regular (e.g., weekly) surveillance for symptoms\nconsistent with brucellosis should be conducted for all exposed\nlaboratory workers for 6 months after exposure.

The center is funded by a USD 18 million DHS grant,\naccording to an Associated Press report.\nAccording to the Sunshine Project, Texas A&M notified the CDC about\nthe case of brucellosis in April 2007, a year after the worker's\nillness was confirmed.

He said\nthe 30 Jun 2007 order applies to every agent the lab works with. The\nlist of affected agents is not public information because of security\nconcerns, Roebuck said.

However, it is highly\ninfectious when it becomes airborne and is inhaled by humans. The\nagent has previously been weaponized and is considered a potential\nterrorist threat.\nBrucellosis presents prolonged fever and a wide range of other\npossible manifestations, such as arthritis, hepatitis, and\nmeningitis. Symptoms can be prolonged, but the disease is rarely\nfatal. In livestock, brucellosis causes infertility and abortions.

Then the rancher is\nleft with 2 choices; one is bad, the other awful.\nEarly Monday, Jim and Sandy Morgan, who had 7 cows from their ranch\nsouth of Bridger test positive for brucellosis in May 2007, picked\nthe bad choice.\nSandy Morgan and her mother, Connie Malcolm of Emigrant, stoically\nworked the corrals, helping 5 Montana Department of Livestock brand\ninspectors sort, herd and load the cows -- cattle from her\ngrandfather's genetic lines -- into double-decker cattle trucks to be\nhauled to slaughter in South Dakota.\n'It's devastating,' Sandy Morgan said. 'You're OK as long as you\npretend they're going to summer grass.'\nThe awful choice would have been for the Morgans to refuse the USD\n423 000 federal livestock officials offered for their nearly 600\ncows, bulls and calves. Then the entire state of Montana would lose\nits brucellosis-free status and producers would have to spend\nmillions to vaccinate and test cattle before shipping.\nBrucellosis causes domestic cows to abort their calves. It is also\nfound in elk and bison. The feds have an unbendable rule: Once\nbrucellosis is found in a herd, that herd must be slaughtered.\nActing State Veterinarian Jeanne Rankin said she is breathing freer\nfor now. 'It's a difficult decision, and nobody is happy,' Rankin\nsaid. 'We need to protect the 2.4 million cattle in Montana and the\nlivelihood of these other ranchers.'\nYet Montana remains under a brucellosis cloud. If one more cow tests\npositive in the next 2 years, the state will lose its brucellosis-free\nstatus.\nUnder the midday sun Monday [16 Jul 2007], the thermometer stuck at\n103 F outside; 6 cattle trucks were lined up to ship the 284 cows and\n16 bulls from Morgan's herd to Cimpl Packing in Yankton, South Dakota.\nThe 284 calves from the herd will be shipped today [17 Jul 2007]\nfrom the ranch to Modesto, California, where they will be made into\nveal. Rankin said the calves needed to go to another facility because\nthey weigh less and need different equipment at the packing plant than\nadult cattle. Starting at 7 am Monday [16 Jul 2007], the calves were\nweighed, and the numbered tag on each cow and bull was marked off on\nthe official federal list to make sure no animal was missing.\nBy 11 a.m., Sandy and Jim and the state officials were herding the\nconfused cows up the cattle chute into the trailer of the 1st truck.\nThe 1st 6 were cows that had tested positive for brucellosis, bearing\na big 'B' brand on the left side of their necks. The 7th positive cow\nwas euthanized in Iowa in May 2007. The rest of the herd tested\nnegative, but they may have been exposed to the highly contagious\ndisease.\nAfter crunching the numbers, the Morgans decided not to keep the\ncalves and fatten them for fall shipping. After the calves were\nweighed Monday [16 Jul 2007], Jim and his wife's father, Bruce\nMalcolm, watched an online video auction where similar weight calves\nwere selling for USD 1.45 a pound. The federal Animal and Plant Health\nInspection Service, a division of the U.S.\nDepartment of Agriculture, offered the Morgans 85 cents a pound. 'So\nwe're USD 56 000 short just on our calves,' he said.\nDr. Ray Randall of Bridger Veterinary Clinic said the Morgan's calves\nwouldn't have brought top price because they may have been exposed to\nbrucellosis. He said the Morgans may have a financial argument to\nmake, but the alternative of rejecting the buyout was unacceptable.\n'If other ranchers had had to go through all the testing, they would\nbe mad at the state and mad at the feds and mad at the Morgans,' he\nsaid.

Since the Morgan herd was tested on 16 May 2007, the state has tested\nmore than 2700 head of cattle, mainly in the Bridger and Emigrant\nareas. Starting at 7 am Monday [16 Jul 2007], the calves were\nweighed, and the numbered tag on each cow and bull was marked off on\nthe official federal list to make sure no animal was missing. Then the entire state of Montana would lose\nits brucellosis-free status and producers would have to spend\nmillions to vaccinate and test cattle before shipping. Rankin said the calves needed to go to another facility because\nthey weigh less and need different equipment at the packing plant than\nadult cattle. Early Monday, Jim and Sandy Morgan, who had 7 cows from their ranch\nsouth of Bridger test positive for brucellosis in May 2007, picked\nthe bad choice. If one more cow tests\npositive in the next 2 years, the state will lose its brucellosis-free\nstatus. The awful choice would have been for the Morgans to refuse the USD\n423 000 federal livestock officials offered for their nearly 600\ncows, bulls and calves. The 284 calves from the herd will be shipped today [17 Jul 2007]\nfrom the ranch to Modesto, California, where they will be made into\nveal.

Other species, _B. abortus_ and _B. suis_ have, on\noccasion, been known to infect canines.\nReproductive failure is the most prevalent clinical sign. Females may\nhave embryonic death and resorption about 20 days post mating or may\nhave abortions about 45-55 days of gestation. Consequently, the\ncomplaint is most often a failure to conceive. The male may share in\nthe cause of this apparent failure as well.\nMales may have epididymitis in one or both testes and/or infertility.\nTesticular atrophy and a moist scrotal dermatitis may be present. The\nsemen of infected males has a large number of abnormal sperm, or no\nsperm at all.\nLoss of libido, lethargy, and generalized lymph node enlargement may\nbe noticed in both genders. Premature aging has been noted in both\ngenders when infected.\nDiagnosis can be difficult. Culture from the blood, lymph nodes,\nmarrow, urine, milk, vaginal discharges or semen is the only\ndefinitive diagnosis.\nExperimentally, the organism was seen in 100 percent of the dogs at 2\nmonths post infection, and the bacteremia [bacteria in the\nbloodstream] lasted 6-12 months. The organism was recovered in 100\npercent of the males and 30 percent of the females in tissues (lymph\nnode, spleen) when they were abacteremic.\nSummary of diagnosis: Use the RSAT, 2ME-RSAT [see original reference\nbelow for explanations] to screen and identify all negative animals.\nUse the AGID cell wall antigen test to confirm the disease. Culture is\nthe only definitive diagnosis and is the best diagnostic test in the\n1st 2 months of the disease; however, dogs become abacteremic after\n27-64 months.

While brucellosis\nposes only a minute risk to human health, the economic costs could\nseverely curtail Montana's premiere beef cattle industry. In\naddition, under federal rules, once brucellosis is detected, an\nexhaustive investigation that confirms no other cases of diseased\nlivestock must be completed within 60 days for the state to retain\nits disease-free status, which was hard won in 1985.\nBrucellosis usually causes late-term abortions in cattle, bison and\nelk. Rarely will an infected cow carry a calf past 5 to 7 months, but\nsometimes a live, but weak calf is born. The bacteria, _Brucella\nabortus_, thrives in un-pasteurized milk, afterbirth and other\nreproductive tract discharges, including aborted fetuses. The\ninfection also spreads through reproductive discharges of fluids and\nmaterials.\nResearch documents the spread of brucellosis from wildlife to\ndomestic cattle when 2 or more species share rangelands, especially\nduring the spring birthing season.\n_Brucella abortus_ can lead to undulant fever in humans, an incurable\nand severely debilitating condition. Once a serious problem (and\nstill a problem in epidemic proportions around the world), this risk\nin the U.S. has been virtually eliminated. It is the reason behind\nthe nation's eradication effort, which began in the 1930s. Today,\npasteurized milk and properly-cooked meat are risk-free.\nMontana Department of Public Health and Human Services statistics\nindicate that between 1960 and 1985, when Montana acquired its\nbrucellosis-free status, there were 28 cases of human undulant fever\ndiagnosed in Montana. In the past 20 years since becoming Brucellosis\nclass-free, only 4 Montanans have contracted the disease.\nOver the past several weeks, the Montana Department of Livestock and\nthe Veterinary Services Division of the USDA Animal and Plant Health\nInspection Service (USDA:APHIS:VS) worked in close cooperation to\ntest the Bridger herd, where brucellosis was discovered.\nOur state Diagnostic Laboratory in Bozeman has done extraordinary\nwork, at times generating accurate test results in as short a\nturn-around as several hours. To confirm brucellosis, a veterinarian\nmust draw a blood sample and send it to the Diagnostic Laboratory in\nBozeman. Usually, results are available within a week.\nNow we are engaged in an effort to trace all breeding stock that has\ncome in contact with the Bridger herd through sales, purchases or\ncommingled grazing over the past 2 years. We are determined to\ncomplete this process within 60 days counting from the day the 1st\npositive test result arrived (18 May 2007), and we are hoping to find\nno more sign of the disease.\nMeanwhile, all cattle from the Bridger herd are quarantined and will\nsoon be slaughtered and the owners compensated through a livestock\nappraisal process paid for by USDA:APHS:VS. Individual cows, heifers\nand bulls from a 2nd herd owned by the extended family have been\ntested, and all results revealed no disease. This herd will be\nretested in 30 days and again in 120 days to complete the\ninvestigation from the birth herd of the original index cow. Montana\nmust remain clean from brucellosis for 2 years after discovering the\n1st positive herd for the state to retain our brucellosis-free\nstatus. If testing confirms brucellosis in a 2nd herd of Montana\ncattle, the state will drop from brucellosis-free status to Class A\nstatus.\nBefore they can be exported, 18-month and older heifers, cows and\nbulls from a Class A state must demonstrate negative results (no\nbrucellosis) from blood tests within the 30-day period before\nshipping. Already, North Dakota has restricted imports of Montana\nbreeding stock, requiring a health certificate, individual\nidentification and a negative brucellosis test within 30 days of\nimportation. This testing requirement does not apply to steers or\nspayed heifers. Cattle grazing bordering counties will be evaluated\non a case-by-case basis.\nMontana's 1.4 million beef cattle comprise the 7th largest herd in\nthe nation. Montana leads the U.S. in quality seedstock, the breeding\nheifers, cows and bulls that are shipped nationwide and overseas.\nWhile comparatively small, Montana's domestic bison (19 000 in 2002)\nand dairy cattle (28 000 cows and heifers) enterprises also\ncontribute significantly to our state's largest economic driver. If\nMontana were to lose its brucellosis-free status, all 18-month-old\nand older reproductive cattle shipped out of state would be tested\nfor brucellosis within 30 days of transport, costing Montana\nproducers an estimated USD 5 million to USD 15 million annually. All\nMontana cattle exports would need to test negative for the disease\nover the course of the investigation. That investigation could last\nfrom one to several years before the state regains its\nbrucellosis-free status.\nCattle producers can vaccinate against brucellosis when livestock are\n4 to 10 months old.\nMany, if not most, Montana producers voluntarily protect their stock\nfrom this economically devastating disease, but the vaccine is only\n60 percent to 85 percent effective. That is better than no\nprotection, but not a guarantee.\nThe urgency of our ongoing investigation is a great inconvenience for\nlivestock owners and their animals.\nThe process requires a lot of extra work from everyone involved. We\nare grateful for all the cooperation and help we're receiving from\nproducers in this trying time. One way or another, science will\ndetermine the outcome of this process.\n[Byline: Dr. Jeanne Rankin, Montana's Acting State Veterinarian]\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Brent Barrett\n[The state of Montana has approximately 5 more weeks to finish\ntrace-ins (animals being brought into the herd) and trace-outs\n(animals leaving the herd) and its epidemiology report to the USDA,\nAPHIS.

If testing confirms brucellosis in a 2nd herd of Montana\ncattle, the state will drop from brucellosis-free status to Class A\nstatus. \nBrucellosis was detected in Montana cattle on 18 May 2007,\nthreatening our state's brucellosis-free status. That investigation could last\nfrom one to several years before the state regains its\nbrucellosis-free status. Clearly from this letter, in 1st person, the acting state\nveterinarian is cautiously concerned about the state's coveted 'free'\nstatus. While comparatively small, Montana's domestic bison (19 000 in 2002)\nand dairy cattle (28 000 cows and heifers) enterprises also\ncontribute significantly to our state's largest economic driver. This herd will be\nretested in 30 days and again in 120 days to complete the\ninvestigation from the birth herd of the original index cow. In the past 20 years since becoming Brucellosis\nclass-free, only 4 Montanans have contracted the disease.\n While brucellosis\nposes only a minute risk to human health, the economic costs could\nseverely curtail Montana's premiere beef cattle industry.", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "brucellosis"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["1985-03-24 00:00:00", "2007-05-18 00:00:00", "2002-03-24 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Bozeman", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "U.S.", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Montana", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "North Dakota", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "10517", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Brucellosis, ovine - Russia (Sverdlovsk region)", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=10517", "date": "2007-05-22 18:00:02", "main_text": "BRUCELLOSIS, OVINE - RUSSIA (SVERDLOVSK REGION)\n***********************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\n<http://www.promedmail.org>\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\n<http://www.isid.org>\nDate: Tue 22 May 2007\nSource: IA: Novy region-2, [translated by Mod.NP, edited]\n<http://www.nr2.ru/ekb/119317.html>\n\nA large number of cases of brucellosis among\nanimals has been registered in the\nBogdanovicheskiy district [Sverdlovsk region]:\nA significant outbreak of brucellosis among\nanimals has been registered in the\nBogdanovicheskiy district of Sverdlovsk region.\n[An entire] herd of sheep became ill with\nbrucellosis on a dairy commodity farm in the\nvillage of Prishchanovo.

Dogs are the definitive\nhost of this organism, and natural infections in other animals are rare.\nInfection has caused a reduction of 75 per cent in the number of pups\nweaned in some breeding kennels. The disease disseminates rapidly among\nclosely confined dogs, especially at time of breeding or when abortions\noccur. Transmission occurs via ingestion of contaminated materials or\nvenereal routes. Both sexes appear to be equally susceptible. Transmission\nof brucellosis from dogs to humans occurs but appears to be very rare.\nPrimary signs are abortion during the last trimester of pregnancy without\npremonitory signs, stillbirths, and conception failures. Prolonged vaginal\ndischarge usually follows abortion. Abortions may occur during subsequent\npregnancies. Infected dogs may develop generalized lymphadenitis and\nfrequently epididymitis, periorchitis, and prostatitis. Spondylitis and\nuveitis are occasional complications. Bacteremia is frequent and persists\nfor about 18 months after exposure. Fever is not characteristic.\nDiagnosis is based on isolation and identification of the causative agent\nor by serology. The organisms can usually be readily isolated from vaginal\nexudate, aborted pups, blood, milk, or semen of infected dogs. The most\nwidely used serologic test is an agglutination test by a tube or slide\nmethod. Nonspecific agglutination reactions occur in some dogs from which\nbrucella has not been isolated. To eliminate nonspecific antibodies, the\nserum is treated with 2-mercaptoethanol and retested. An agar gel\nimmunodiffusion test performed in some laboratories is quite specific.\nAttempts at immunization have not been successful. Control is based on\nelimination or isolation of infected dogs identified by positive cultural\nor serologic tests. Incidence of infection is much lower in kennels where\ndogs are caged individually. Longterm therapy, eg, with a combination of\nstreptomycin or gentamicin and tetracycline, has been successful in many\ncases.

Some conservation\ngroups blamed the jump on the supplemental\nfeeding, which biologists say congregates\nanimals, increasing the spread of the disease.\nIn this year's [2007] study, wildlife officials\ntested 39 samples for the _Brucella_ bacteria,\nfinding it in 2 animals. Researchers also\nattached Global Positioning System and VHF radio\ncollars, and vaginal implant transmitters to 41\nfemale elk. The transmitters are designed to\ndetect when and where a pregnant female elk\naborts her fetus. Blood from 2 of the 41 elk\nfroze in the syringe, making it unusable for\nbrucellosis testing.\nStudies of brucellosis rates in Buffalo Valley\nfrom 1987 to 2005 showed disease in 2.7 percent\nof the animals. After emergency feeding last\nyear, brucellosis rates jumped to about 20\npercent.\nOfficials say the jump likely is not caused by\nthe emergency feeding but rather resulted from\ndifferences in testing methods. The 1987 to 2005\ndata is derived from hunter samples submitted\nduring the fall, while the Wyoming Game and Fish\nDepartment used helicopters to capture elk in the\nwinter during the past 2 years [2005, 2006].\nIn a statement, Game and Fish wildlife\nveterinarian Dr. Terry Kreeger said it was\n'highly unlikely'\ufffd last year's [2006] 20 percent\ndisease rate was caused by any management action.\n'Successive years of data must be collected and\nstudies repeated before accurate conclusions can\nbe made,' he said.\nHank Edwards, a wildlife disease specialist with\nGame and Fish, said biologists aren't sure why\nthe rate was 20 percent last year [2006] only to\nfall again this year [2007].\n'I wish we had a good explanation for it, but we\ndon't have a good handle on that herd unit,' he\nsaid. 'Are we sampling the same elk? What\ndifference does snow play?'\n'This disease is one of those things, just when\nyou think you've got a good handle on it, it\nthrows it back in your face. This is not a closed\nsystem. There's elk moving in and out ... unlike\na research project where we can bleed everybody.'\nEdwards said he wasn't sure if the data from the\nmost recent survey are statistically significant.\n[Byline: Cory Hatch]\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[Brucellosis is caused by the bacteria _Brucella\nabortus_ in elk. The disease is best known for it\nability to induce abortions, although stillborn\nand weak calves are other possible effects. It\nis difficult to find in these wild animals\nbecause the herds are so dynamic that disease\nstatistics are not static.

The 1987 to 2005\ndata is derived from hunter samples submitted\nduring the fall, while the Wyoming Game and Fish\nDepartment used helicopters to capture elk in the\nwinter during the past 2 years [2005, 2006]. Hank Edwards, a wildlife disease specialist with\nGame and Fish, said biologists aren't sure why\nthe rate was 20 percent last year [2006] only to\nfall again this year [2007]. In a statement, Game and Fish wildlife\nveterinarian Dr. Terry Kreeger said it was\n'highly unlikely'\ufffd last year's [2006] 20 percent\ndisease rate was caused by any management action. Department officials announced an almost 17\npercent jump in brucellosis rates in the Buffalo\nValley area after elk were fed on an emergency\nbasis last February [2006]. This article\nsuggests there are factors other than emergency\nfeeding and the method of sampling that may\ninfluence the disease in these elk herds. Some conservation\ngroups blamed the jump on the supplemental\nfeeding, which biologists say congregates\nanimals, increasing the spread of the disease.

Brian Schweitzer said he expects the 2nd set of test results as\nearly as Tuesday [22 May 2007]. 'There is a process you go through --\nrounding up cattle, drawing blood, testing it., and then it's either\n'Whew!' or 'Oh, my God,' ' Schweitzer said.\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture's (DOA) Animal and Plant Health\nInspection Service (APHIS) is in charge of controlling the disease.\nAPHIS rules say that a state loses its brucellosis-free status when\nat least 2 cows from 2 herds test positive within 12 months.\nOn 1 May 2007, 51 Angus cows bound for Iowa were tested for\nbrucellosis in Baker. Because Montana is a brucellosis-free state,\nthe cows wouldn't normally be tested, but because the cows were going\nto be surrogate mothers, the tests were conducted. On 4 May 2007, the\nMontana State Lab in Bozeman found that one cow had tested positive\nfor brucellosis. That cow was euthanized and tissue cultures were\nre-tested at the National Veterinary Services lab in Ames, Iowa,\nwhich conducts the testing for APHIS. The infected cow was traced\nback to a herd of 301 cows in Bridger, and that herd was quarantined\nafter 6 more cows tested positive for brucellosis. The cattle came\nfrom a ranch near Emigrant, Schweitzer said. A 2nd herd in the\nParadise Valley is being tested now.\nTo prevent the spread of [the disease] from bison to area cattle,\nofficials from the Montana Department of Livestock have hazed\nwandering Yellowstone National Park bison back into the park. Last\nyear [2006], more than 1000 bison that ranged onto private lands in\nMontana were captured, and most were sent to slaughter. However, the\ngovernor said information he has received indicates that bison aren't\nto blame. 'It seems almost impossible this was a direct transmission\nfrom Yellowstone bison to cattle. It could have been it came from\nelk,' Schweitzer said. 'Or it could have been someone shipping cattle\ninto Montana from some infected herd in Texas or Mexico.' Jeremy\nSeidlitz, executive director of the Montana Cattlemen's Association,\nexpressed concern but said he feels helpless for now. 'I really don't\nthink there is anything we can do but watch and hope,' Seidlitz said.\n'Losing the brucellosis-free status is very expensive in terms of\nmoney and time.'\n[Brucellosis is a contagious disease in ruminant animals that can\ncause fetuses to abort. It is considered one of the most serious\nlivestock diseases, primarily affecting cattle, swine, bison, and\nelk.] Ranchers, veterinarians, and workers in slaughterhouses are\nmost at risk for the human strain, called undulant fever.\nMontana has been brucellosis-free since June 1985. Wyoming found\nbrucellosis in its cattle in 2004, and regained its brucellosis-free\nstatus last September, [2006]. Currently, Idaho and Texas are the\nonly states without a brucellosis-free rating.\nTesting costs from USD 5 to USD 10 per animal, depending on whether\nthe tests are conducted at the ranch or elsewhere, said Ray Randall,\nwho owns Bridger Veterinary Service. 'It's a significant problem,' he\nsaid. 'The last time I remember having a brucellosis-positive herd\nwas in the '70s.' Randall said he hasn't taken any blood tests for\nbrucellosis yet.\nEven if the 2nd herd tests free of the disease, the 301 cows\nquarantined near Bridger must be slaughtered, according to APHIS\nrules. There is no immediate financial help for the owner. Indemnity\nfunds exist for ranchers who lose livestock to wolves, but not this\ndisease, Seidlitz said, adding that he has never heard of brucellosis\ninsurance.\nSchweitzer said the bad news is reason to adopt his plan to test all\ncattle within a ring around Yellowstone National Park. He has\nproposed to APHIS that Montana be allowed to mark off an area of 60\nto 70 miles (approx. 97-113 km) around Yellowstone National Park and\nrequire that all the cattle moving in and out of the zone be tested.\nIf the disease shows up, only that zone would lose its\nbrucellosis-free status, not the whole state. 'We would have caught\nit at its source,' the governor said. 'Now we're in a position where\npeople long removed from Yellowstone Basin are being painted with the\nsame brush.'\nMeanwhile, APHIS spokeswoman, Teresa Howes, in Fort Collins,\nColorado, said tracing back and testing cattle is a long process, one\nthat's just starting in Montana. 'The good news is that this was\nfound and it didn't go on to infect the national herd,' she said.\n'Now we're doing the investigation to make sure no other herds are infected.'\n[Byline: Jan Falstad]\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Joseph P.

Generally, when the\nanimal requires assistance during the birthing process, the person\nproviding the assistance is most at risk of exposure to the causative\nbacterium _Brucella abortus_. This agent can be passed to humans\nthrough unpasteurized or raw milk as well.\nBrucellosis is commonly transmitted to susceptible animals by direct\ncontact with infected animals or with an environment that has been\ncontaminated with discharges from infected animals. Aborted fetuses,\nplacental membranes or fluids, and other vaginal discharges present\nafter an infected animal has aborted or calved are all highly\ncontaminated with infectious brucella organisms.\nCattle, bison, and cervids are susceptible to _B. abortus_; other\n_Brucella_ species affect other animals. The animals experience a\nloss of production (including abortion of the fetus), a drop in milk\nproduction, weight loss, infertility, and lameness. Although the\nanimal may abort the 1st fetus, the animal may successfully carry a\nfetus to term during the next pregnancy. Offspring may be born weak\nor dead, without actual abortion.\nThe brucellosis eradication program in place for about 50 years has\nalmost eliminated the disease. Currently, only Texas and Idaho are\nclassified as Class A states, meaning they have a herd infection rate\nof less than 0.1 percent.

' The animals experience a\nloss of production (including abortion of the fetus), a drop in milk\nproduction, weight loss, infertility, and lameness. However, the\ngovernor said information he has received indicates that bison aren't\nto blame.

One has to\nre-emphasize that positive serological titers is either indicative of\na smooth _Brucella spp._ infection (one cannot make any inference as\nto whether _B. abortus_, _B. melitensis_ or _B. suis_ is involved\nunless the most likely source of infection is identified) or/and _Y.\nenterocolitica_ O:9 infection.\nClinical symptoms help in classifying the case as probable or\nconfirmed brucellosis, according to the CDC case definition. In this\nparticular case, given the patient was in Turkey (where _B.\nmelitensis_ is enzootic in sheep) and given the fact that sheep\ncheese has been consumed, one can reasonably assume that _B.\nmelitensis_ is involved, not _B. abortus_. _B. abortus_ is seldom\nreported to infect sheep, but _B. melitensis_ is reported to\nregularly infect cattle in the Mediterranean basin (1).\nOne can argue that _B. abortus_ infects cattle in Turkey. Human\nbrucellosis cases reported in that country have predominantly been\nattributed to _B. melitensis_\n2) _Y. enterocolitica_ O:9 serology\n----------------------------------\nSerological cross-reactivity after Smooth _Brucella spp_ (not just\n_B. abortus_) and _Y. enterocolitica_ O:9 infection both in animals\nand humans has been well documented. This is why the antibody test\nfor _Y. enterocolitica_ O:9 is likely to be a cross-reaction, unless\nthe diagnosis of the extraintestinal form of yersiniosis can be\nfurther substantiated.\n3) In the veterinary field\n-------------------------\nBrucellosis control or eradication programs are implemented\nworldwide, mainly for cattle, sheep, goats, and pigs. In this\ncontext, the objective is not primarily to diagnose _Y.\nenterocolitica_ O:9 infections, but to exclude brucellosis. In other\nwords, the _Y. enterocolitica_ O:9 status will not tell anything\nabout the brucellosis status. In this context, serology seems so far\nunable to differentiate beyond certain smooth _Brucella spp_\ninfection and _Y. enterocolitica_ O:9 infection. This is why\nmeasurement of the cell-mediated immunity via the brucellosis skin\ntest is the only means by which one can beyond any reasonable doubt\ndifferentiate smooth _Brucella spp_ infection and _Y. enterocolitica_\nO:9 infection (2).\nMay I take this opportunity to thank for you for the invaluable\nsource of information ProMED is, particularly for those living and\nworking somewhere 'at the end of the world.'\n1.

Yes, _B. melitensis_ is responsible for the majority of human infections\nand is primarily food borne. Primary hosts for _B. melitensis_ are sheep\nand goats. _B. abortus_ infection is generally sporadic and occurs in\npeople who work with cattle or pigs, respectively. It is also valid that\nthe general public generally acquires the infection including _B. abortus_\nthrough the ingestion of unpasteurized milk and milk products. Our traveler\nconsumed milk and sheep milk cheese on the streets in Istanbul. I agree\nwith the professor that the cheese as the source of disease is unlikely,\nbut unpasteurized milk and brucellosis exist in Turkey, both _melitensis_\nand _abortus_.\n2. Clinical symptoms are generally not specific for brucellosis. The\npossibility of brucellosis should be considered in any fever of unknown\norigin in patients who recently traveled in endemic areas. Turkey is an\nendemic area, and our traveler visited there. The patient developed the\nflu-like symptoms of headache, myalgias, arthralgias, anorexia, malaise,\nfatigue, fever and weight loss. The fever showed diurnal variation and came\nand went over time.\n3. In the laboratory, we found positive inflammatory indexes. In the blood,\nleucopenia with lymphocytosis were found, and liver function tests were\nabnormal. Hepatosplenomegaly was found by ultrasound. Lymphadenopathy was\nfound as well. No other infectious or non-infectious etiology of hepatitis\nwas found.\n4. Serologically, high titers for brucellosis were found, and antibodies\nagainst _Y. enterocolitica_ were lower. It is debatable whether infection\nwith _Y. enterocolitica_ was present, but brucellosis was definite. When we\nhave diagnosed extraintestinal yersiniosis in patients in previous years,\nbrucellosis titers have always been non-reactive.\nSources:\n1.

Whether the tourist had a co-infection with\nyersiniosis, however, is unclear.\nThe serodiagnosis of acute or recent infections with _Brucella abortus_ and\n_Yersinia enterocolitica_ O:9 together is problematic because many of the\ncommonly used serological tests demonstrate cross-reactivity (1, 2), both\nin animals and humans.

The infection is also\nknown as undulant fever, related to the occurrence of 1-3 week febrile\nperiods separated by 1-3 days of afebrility. This occurs more likely with\n_B. melitensis_ (acquired from goats) as compared to _B. abortus_ (cattle)\nand _B. suis_ (swine).\nThe infection can be subclinical. Acute symptomatic brucellosis is\ngenerally manifest with nonspecific symptoms such as fever, chills, night\nsweats, anorexia, and an increased sense of ill health. The disease can be\ndiagnosed serologically and/or by blood culture. The organism may grow\nquite slowly on primary isolation, and the clinician should make the\nmicrobiology laboratory aware of this potential diagnosis. Localized\ninfection may occur. Sites for localization include the skeletal system\n(1), heart valves (2) and urinary tract (3). GU brucellosis may present\nidentically to GU tuberculosis. Psychiatric manifestations such as\ndepression and anxiety are possible as late symptoms of brucellosis (4,5),\nso-called chronic neurobrucellosis. It remains unclear whether active\nbrucella infection is present at that time. Overt CNS infection can,\nhowever, include meningitis and encephalitis (6,7).\n1.

Samples from\nreactors are undergoing cultural examination.\nVeterinary advice was that 4 of the reactors should be culled.\nSlaughter of the 4, with compensation, has now been carried out and\nfurther testing will be done on lymph nodes to check for _Brucella_.\nSampling of the remaining reactors, who are in isolation, has taken\nplace and the blood and milk samples are under investigation.\nDefra is also tracing any movements off the farm in recent months.\nHowever, it is understood that the farm has been relatively\nself-contained with few movements off the farm apart from to\nslaughter. Testing has been undertaken on 2 premises under the same\nmanagement. There have been no abortions reported from the farm and\nno other clinical evidence that Brucellosis has been identified.\n_Brucella_ cultures are relatively slow-growing, and results may not\nbe available for at least 2 weeks. There is a possibility that the\ninitial test results could be due to a cross-reaction to the test\nrather than infection.\nNotes for editors\n----------------\n1. Brucellosis of cattle is caused by infection with the bacterium\n_Brucella abortus_, which can also cause a disease of humans known as\nundulant fever. In cattle, it causes abortion or premature calving of\nrecently infected animals; the foetus, placenta and uterine fluid\ncontain large quantities of _Brucella abortus_ bacteria, which can\naffect other cattle coming into contact with an infected animal\naround the time of calving. The organism continues to be excreted in\nthe milk; in the past humans were frequently infected through\ndrinking unpasteurised milk.\n2. The last case of Brucellosis was in 2004 in Cornwall. Details of\nthe last press release dated 20 Jul 2004 can be found at:\n<http://www.defra.gov.uk/news/2004/040720d.htm>.\n3. If slaughter is required, animals will be slaughtered under the\nBrucellosis (England) Order 2000. Compensation is payable for\nslaughter of reactors under the Brucellosis and Tuberculosis (England\nand Wales) Compensation (Amendment) Order 1998 [NB the parent Order\nis the Brucellosis and Tuberculosis (England and Wales - Compensation\nOrder 1978]. The maximum payable is calculated monthly based on the\naverage market price and for Mar 2005 is GBP 591 [USD 1105].\n4.

'The situation is stark.'\nBrucellosis is an infectious disease caused by bacteria of the genus\n_Brucella_. These bacteria are spread primarily among animals, including\nsheep, goats, cattle, deer, pigs and dogs. Humans become infected by coming\nin contact with animals, or animal products, that are contaminated with\nthese bacteria.\nIn humans, brucellosis can cause a range of symptoms similar to influenza\nand may include fever, headache, back pain, and physical weakness. Severe\ninfections of the central nervous systems or lining of the heart may occur.\nBrucellosis can also cause long-lasting or chronic symptoms that include\nrecurrent fever, joint pain, and fatigue.\nThe Ministry of Health noted that it has issued a notice, together with the\nMinistry of Agriculture, ordering local health and agricultural departments\nto take rigorous quarantine and disinfecting measures, and, to conduct\nstrict animal culls on sick livestock to halt the spread of the disease.\nThe 2 ministries asked local agencies to improve health education to raise\npeople's awareness of the disease, the Ministry of Health said. Meanwhile,\nthe Ministry of Health said the 2 ministries also asked local agencies to\nenforce efforts in disease monitoring.\n'The Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Agriculture will readjust and\nincrease the key national monitoring posts according to the development of\nthe epidemic,' the Ministry of Health said.\nLocal health institutions were asked to cooperate with agricultural\ndepartments closely, and to report disease information immediately, the\nHealth Ministry said.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[No information is given regarding the manifestations of brucellosis in the\ncases or how the diagnosis was made, by culture, by serology, or just\nempirically.\nBrucellosis is considered to be a Category B bioterrorism agent which is,\nin nature, acquired as a zoonotic infection by humans.

They say that feedgrounds help spread the disease from\nelk to livestock.\nA 19-member task force, appointed by Gov. Dave Freudenthal, is studying the\nfeedground issue, and, could recommend changes later in 2004.\nElk have been known to overrun cattle pasture near feedgrounds. It happened\nduring the winter of 1995-96, when deep snow forced elk to lower\nelevations, including the state's Bench Corral feedground near Boulder.\nAbout 900 elk gathered at the feedground a couple of miles from Ken Fear's\nranch. But, the feedground, which provided the animals with hay and\nalfalfa, was designed for just 300 elk. The elk began spilling over into\nneighboring pastures, damaging fences and consuming haystacks and crops.\nFear said it got so bad that on some mornings, elk outnumbered cattle 3 to\n1. 'It was a mess,' he said.\nBrucellosis was discovered in cattle in the Boulder area in November\n[2003]. The disease then turned up in cattle at a Worland sale barn,\nprompting the federal government to revoke Wyoming's brucellosis-free\nstatus. Brucellosis was then discovered in Teton County a few weeks ago.\n'What's different now than 10 years ago is that we have many more houses on\nthe landscape, more fences, more people in 5-acre ranchettes. The energy\npush is taking up much more habitat. There's the drought that's occurring,\nand now, we have a brucellosis outbreak,' said Cathy Purves, acting\ndirector of the Wyoming Wildlife Federation. 'Looking at the feedground\nissue is more critical now than ever, because you've got this combination\nof boiling events that has just brought this to the forefront,' she said.\nBut, supporters of feedgrounds say closing them would lead to more, not\nfewer, elk intermingling with cattle.\nBrucellosis can cause cattle, elk and bison to abort. Biologists say\ninfection rates for elk can be as much as 5 times higher for elk on\nfeedgrounds than elk elsewhere.\n--\nPablo Nart\n<p.nart@ntlworld.com>", "summary": "A ProMED-mail post\n<http://www.promedmail.org>\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\n<http://www.isid.org>\n Biologists say\ninfection rates for elk can be as much as 5 times higher for elk on\nfeedgrounds than elk elsewhere.\n Some conservationists want some of western Wyoming's state elk feedgrounds\nclosed, after the discovery of brucellosis in cattle in Sublette, Washakie,\nand Teton counties.

Now, the samples have been\ntested and it's time to find out who stays, who dies, and who gets a shot\nof vaccine.\nRick Wallen, a Yellowstone wildlife biologist, emerged from a trailer with\na clipboard and climbed onto the grated walkways overlooking the holding\npens and chutes. As 2 bison moved into the chute below, a crew member\ncalled out the 4-digit number on the sticker affixed to the bison's hides.\nWallen checked his clipboard and found both tested positive for exposure to\nbrucellosis. 'Ship,' he said.\nThe news was relayed by hand signals -- an unmistakable thumbs down -- and\nthe bison were herded toward a pen where they would be sent to slaughter\nthe next morning.\nNext up was a yearling bison skittering wide-eyed through the chute.\n'Keep,' Wallen announced after checking his notes.\nThe bison, soon clamped into a narrow passageway, was the first that day to\nget a syringe full of RB51, a vaccine designed to protect animals from\nbrucellosis.\nThroughout the afternoon, bison were sorted, some were vaccinated, and\nabout half that tested negative were slated for slaughter. At times the\ncapture facility, where several of the animals had red gouges from tussles\nwith their pen-mates, seemed more like a domestic cattle operation than a\nplace for Yellowstone's iconic wild bison.\nThe Stephens Creek bison pen, tucked behind a locked gate and down a gravel\nroad, has been a busy place the last 2 months. So far in 2004, 464 of\nYellowstone's estimated 4200 bison have been captured. Of those, 264 have\nbeen taken to slaughter, and 198 are being held until food conditions\nimprove in Yellowstone.\nThe activity -- hazing and capturing bison that might leave Yellowstone --\nis nothing new. What's new is a push to vaccinate some of the bison that\nare captured. [Some readers may not be familiar with this type of 'hazing,'\nwhich means driving the animals from horseback. - CopyEd.PG]\nState and federal officials believe that the vaccinations can reduce the\nrisk of transmitting brucellosis from the park's bison to cattle outside\nthe boundaries.\nAt the beginning of 2004, Yellowstone officials began giving shots to bison\ncalves and yearlings that had already tested negative for exposure to\nbrucellosis. About 111 have received the vaccine so far.\nThe vaccination program is expected to continue into 2005 at the north end\nof the park. Also, Montana Department of Livestock officials are preparing\nto conduct a study about whether a similar program should be started for\nbison that leave Yellowstone's western boundary.\nThe effectiveness of the vaccination on bison, though, is unclear. In one\ncontrolled test, RB51 was able to help 60 percent of vaccinated calves fend\noff _Brucella_ bacteria. Elsewhere, though, the success rate isn't as good.\n'So far there is no consensus on efficacy. Some indications of protection\nhave been found in some studies; others have failed to find any\nprotection,' said a 2002 paper on RB51 bison vaccine written by 2\nscientists from the U.S. Geological Survey and the U.S. Department of\nAgriculture.\nYellowstone officials in the mid-1960s tried a version of the capture,\ntest, slaughter and/or vaccinate program but soon scrapped it.\n'These efforts were reviewed by park management and determined to be\nineffective and 'never-ending,' ' according to background information in\nthe current Interagency Bison Management Plan.\nWallen said RB51 is a better option than a predecessor, known as Strain 19,\nbut uncertainties about RB51 remain.\nPark officials put ear tags on the vaccinated bison this year and will test\ntheir exposure to brucellosis if the bison are captured again. That's the\nbest plan so far, Wallen said, but technological advances could improve the\nprogram.\n'There are a lot of different things happening in the world of vaccines,\nsome very promising studies using DNA,' Wallen said.\nThe Department of Livestock also wants to study how a vaccination program\nmight work on the west side of Yellowstone, where bison often wander out\nduring the winter.\n'The goal is to increase overall herd immunity and try to prevent infection\nwithin the herd,' said Karen Cooper, a Department of Livestock spokeswoman,\nadding that the state and federal plan is aimed at protecting cattle from\nbrucellosis while maintaining a wild bison herd.\nBut Ted Fellman with the Buffalo Field Campaign, a group fighting against\nthe bison hazing and capturing program, said the vaccination program is a\nshort-sighted way to deal with a 'problem that doesn't exist.'\n'By vaccinating them and holding them in captivity and ear-tagging them --\nit's turning the wildlife of Yellowstone into livestock,' Fellman said.\n'It's appalling that the Park Service would treat them that way.'\nIt probably was cattle that first spread brucellosis to Yellowstone's bison.\nCows came to the park with people who lived and worked at Yellowstone. At\nBuffalo Ranch in the Lamar Valley, bison probably came in contact with\ninfectious aborted material left behind by cattle, according to Mary\nMeagher, a former Park Service scientist who researched the origins of the\ndisease in Yellowstone.\nBrucellosis was first diagnosed in the Yellowstone bison in 1917.\n'It pretty well comes back to the Buffalo Ranch,' said Meagher, who retired\nin 1997.\nOver the years, the bison population fluctuated, but concerns over\nbrucellosis remained. Nearby ranchers were especially worried that the\ncontagious disease, which can cause abortions and other problems, would\ninfect cattle herds outside Yellowstone.\nIn Montana, livestock officials remain concerned that the bison could cause\nthe loss of the state's brucellosis-free status, which would mean increased\nmeasures and costs for shipping cattle across state lines.\nA plan approved in 2000 by Montana and federal agencies, including the Park\nService, allows bison that leave the park -- or, on the north end, appear\nto be headed for the border -- to be hazed, captured, tested, and sometimes\nsent to slaughter.\nLast year, 231 were killed after being captured on Yellowstone's northern\nend. More than 1000 were sent to slaughter in the winter of 1996-97.\nEarlier in the winter of 2003-2004, park officials estimated there were a\nrecord 4200 bison in Yellowstone. But in mid-February 2004, the fluffy snow\non the park's northern range became packed and hard. That makes it more\ndifficult for bison to get to the food below, so they migrate north in\nsearch of lower elevations and more to eat.\nOver the course of several weeks, hundreds of bison were taken to the\nStephens Creek facility. About half tested negative for exposure to\nbrucellosis and will be held in a pasture until later this spring.\nWhile much of the focus is on the bison captured on the northern end,\nWallen said it's easy to forget about the other thousands of bison in\nYellowstone's interior.\n'Even though we handled some 460 animals, there are still over 3500 that we\nhaven't touched on the landscape. That's twice what was there 20 years\nago,' Wallen said.\nEventually, the vaccination program could lead to a more hands-off approach\nto bison, or at least an expansion of their range, Wallen said.\n'We're trying to develop a program so that the (Montana) state veterinarian\nhas a greater confidence that there'll be no exposure risk to livestock\nhe's charged to protect,' Wallen said.\nFor now, though, the vaccinated animals aren't given a free pass to wander\noutside Yellowstone and the prospect of claiming that there's no risk of\nbison transmitting the disease to cattle is slim.\n'It's not zero right now,' Wallen said. 'It may never be zero.'\nBy the numbers:\nThe winter of 2003-04 has been a busy one for crews trying to keep bison\nfrom leaving the northern end of Yellowstone National Park.

Eventually, the vaccination program could lead to a more hands-off approach\nto bison, or at least an expansion of their range, Wallen said. Blood samples were taken earlier from several dozen restless bison herded\ninto a capture pen on the north end of the park. Earlier in the winter of 2003-2004, park officials estimated there were a\nrecord 4200 bison in Yellowstone.

The\n35-cow herd, near Liskeard, has been under restriction since\nunexplained abortions were reported in the herd earlier in March 2004.\nFurther serological results are expected from the Veterinary\nLaboratories Agency, Weybridge, very shortly. The 5 reactors will be\nculled and if the laboratory culture results are positive, the whole\nherd will be slaughtered.\nState Veterinary Service vets are currently undertaking forward\ntracings of animals that have left the suckler unit, although\nevidence so far suggests that the overwhelming majority of animals\nhave gone to slaughter.\nFarmers are reminded of their statutory requirement to notify\nabortions in cattle immediately to Defra.\nThe neighbouring herds have been placed under movement restrictions\nwhile blood tests take place. Milk tests from neighbouring dairy\nfarms show no evidence that the disease is currently present.\nWildlife can spread disease by moving infected afterbirth to\nneighbouring farms, but it is normally spread by cattle-to-cattle\ncontact. While the disease is economically serious, it does not carry\nthe same implications as Foot and Mouth Disease. The Food Standards\nAgency advise that whilst it is possible to catch the disease by\ndrinking infected unpasteurised milk or dairy products, this rarely\nhappens in the UK and the risk is very small. The risk from meat\nproducts is even smaller.\nChief Veterinary Officer Jim Scudamore said that Great Britain has\nofficial brucella-free status. There were 2 cases during 2003 in\nScotland which were linked with imported consignments from the\nRepublic of Ireland.\nMr Scudamore said it was vital for all livestock farmers,\nparticularly in Cornwall, to report all abortions in cattle to their\nlocal Animal Health Divisional Office. Further investigations into\nthe source of the outbreak are continuing.\nNotes for editors\n1. Brucellosis of cattle is caused by infection with the bacterium\n_Brucella abortus_, which can also cause a disease of humans known as\nundulant fever. This used to be a major problem for farmers and vets.\nA full question-and-answer brief is available from the Health\nProtection Agency\n(<http://www.hpa.org.uk/infections/topics_az/zoonoses/brucellosis/menu.htm>).\nIn cattle, it causes abortion or premature calving of recently\ninfected animals; the foetus, placenta and uterine fluid contain\nlarge quantities of _Brucella abortus_ bacteria, which can affect\nother cattle coming into contact with an infected animal around the\ntime of calving. The organism continues to be excreted in the milk;\nin the past humans were frequently infected through drinking\nunpasteurised milk.\n2. Great Britain gained formal recognition as a region of the\nEuropean Union with Official Brucellosis-Free Status in 1991.

Breeders in\nthis area have expressed their concern because the daily requirement for\nsupplying the local markets is at least 100 000 liters of milk.\nOsuna stated that several months ago it was made public that approximately\n1000 head of cattle were contaminated, but that due to the lack of\nresources and support, little had been done to combat the problem,\nresulting in the propagation of the disease and the increasing desperation\nof the breeders.\nOsuna added that because of the region's humid climate, it is common for\nbovine tuberculosis to increase during the rainy season.

Brucellosis has been spreading in\nthe western province since early September 2003. The bacteria are usually\npassed among animals such as goats and cattle. Humans can be infected\nthrough contact with the animals or by consuming their contaminated products.\nLocal veterinarian Manaschai Watanakul said infected animals would suffer\nmiscarriages, while infected humans would suffer flu symptoms such as high\ntemperature, headache, pain in the joints, and loss of weight.\nHe said livestock officials found 256 infected goats on 10 farms in Suan\nPhung district. The animals were killed and buried on Monday and their\nowners compensated. Thousands of goats are raised in Ratchaburi, mostly in\nSuan Phung and Muang districts, and Ban Kha sub-district.\nDr Jaruthas Narischart, Ratchaburi public health chief, said the infection\nwas confirmed in 2 patients while 40 others were under observation. The\ndisease can be fatal if complications are not adequately treated.\nBlood samples from over 3000 goats in Ratchaburi had been sent to\nlaboratories in Bangkok for tests, he said.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[Caprine brucellosis is usually _B. melitensis_, which is a significant\nhuman zoonotic disease and can carry case fatality rates of around 30\npercent. One of its more unpleasant aspects is its capacity to induce\nflorid psychotic periods in humans during convalescence. It was a major\nsource of illness among the Allies during the World War II fighting in\nItaly. This is not a disease to regard lightly.\nChecking the OIE statistics, Thailand has not reported this B-class disease\nin its goats. However, they have reported sporadic _B. abortus_ outbreaks\nin cattle in 2001, 1997, and 1996. Various caprine vaccines are available,\nand a new 'RB' vaccine for melitensis is in development and has been\nundergoing field trials in Argentina. When it will be available elsewhere I\nam unsure, but it looks to be as successful as the RB51 vaccine. - Mod.MHJ]\n[Brucellosis is another zoonotic infection that can be spread not only by\ndirect contact with the animal carrier but also by the ingestion of\nunpasteurized dairy products such as milk and cheese. The infection is\nalso known as undulant fever, related to the occurrence of 1-3 week febrile\nperiods separated by 1-3 days of afebrility. This occurs more likely with\n_B. melitensis_ (acquired from goats) as compared to _B. abortus_ (cattle)\nand _B. suis_ (swine).\nThe infection can be subclinical. Acute symptomatic brucellosis is\ngenerally manifest with nonspecific symptoms such as fever, chills, night\nsweats, anorexia, and an increased sense of ill health. The disease can be\ndiagnosed serologically and/or by blood culture. The organism may grow\nquite slowly on primary isolation, and the clinician should make the\nmicrobiology laboratory aware of this potential diagnosis. Localized\ninfection may occur. Sites for localization include the skeletal system\n(1), heart valves (2) and urinary tract (3). GU brucellosis may present\nidentically to GU tuberculosis.\nAs noted by Moderator MHJ, psychiatric manifestations such as depression\nand anxiety are possible as late symptoms of brucellosis (4,5), so-called\nchronic neurobrucellosis. It remains unclear whether active brucella\ninfection is present at that time. Overt CNS infection can, however,\ninclude meningitis and encephalitis (6,7).\n1.

If unchecked, the infection can cut a herd's\nproductivity, causing heifers to abort and trigger undulant fever, a\nchronic debilitating disease in humans.\nThe British mainland was believed to have eradicated the disease, with the\nlast case in Scotland reported in the 1970s.\nThe disease at Forfar was identified following the abortion of a cattle\nfoetus. The animals had been under restriction since 11 Feb 2003, and\nsurveillance and testing will continue to ensure that the outbreak has been\neradicated.\nThe farm at the centre of the scare is a mixed beef and sheep enterprise\nwhich does not sell milk. Any risk to humans is through direct contact with\nthe aborted animal.\nFarmers were advised to exercise great care in planning the purchase of\nlivestock when re-stocking herds and were reminded by the Scottish\nExecutive that by law, they must report all bovine abortions and premature\ncalvings to the local Animal Health Office.\nA statement said: 'Contact with infected discharges provides the route of\ninfection through beef cattle. The only humans at possible risk are those\nin direct contact with livestock who are well aware of the known\noccupational hazards. Symptoms can include recurrent or chronic fever.\nThere is no risk from pasteurised milk, cooked meat, or contact with\npasteurised animal products. The local public health department has been\ninformed.'\nIn England, the Department for the Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs,\nsaid last night that 3 other animals at a farm near Middlesbrough were to\nbe culled because they came from a Northern Irish herd which had been shown\nto have brucellosis.\nThe announcement by Jim Scudamore, the chief veterinary officer, will\nconcern farmers still struggling to recover from the outbreak of\nfoot-and-mouth disease and BSE.\n[Byline: Stephen Stewart]\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[Bovine brucellosis is usually caused by _Brucella abortus_, less\nfrequently by _B. melitensis_, and rarely by _B. suis_. It is manifested by\nabortion, with excretion of the organisms in uterine discharges and in\nmilk. Diagnosis depends on the isolation of Brucella from abortion\nmaterial, udder secretions, or tissues removed at post-mortem.\nAlternatively, specific cell-mediated or serological responses to Brucella\nantigens can be demonstrated. All Brucella species are pathogenic for humans.\nThe only organism involved in outbreaks of Bovine Brucellosis in Northern\nEurope is _B. abortus_; Southern European countries are affected by _B.\nmelitensis_ as well. The last outbreak of Bovine Brucellosis was recorded\nin the UK in 1993. In 1997, 13 cattle were compulsorily slaughtered as\nreactors to serological tests, and a further 3 animals as contacts -- but\nno infection with _Brucella sp._ was detected in laboratory investigations\nin any of these cattle.\nThe Republic of Ireland has a high incidence of bovine Brucellosis, though\nsome decrease has been observed in recent years.

If unchecked, the infection can cut a herd's\nproductivity, causing heifers to abort and trigger undulant fever, a\nchronic debilitating disease in humans. The current reported outbreak does not change UK's status as a\nBrucellosis-free country, hopefully to remain so thanks to the adopted\ncontrol and eradication steps. The animals had been under restriction since 11 Feb 2003, and\nsurveillance and testing will continue to ensure that the outbreak has been\neradicated. The only humans at possible risk are those\nin direct contact with livestock who are well aware of the known\noccupational hazards. It remains to note the exact origin of the animals imported to Scotland\nfrom Ireland and which -- if any -- certification accompanied them.\n During the 4 years\n1998-2001, the number of outbreaks there was 1081, 875, 659, and 553,\nrespectively.

This is the first\ntime we face this problem.\nThis is a community of 17 families (approximately 40 adults and 50\nchildren) that live in a condominium in northern Santiago, Chile. A month\nago, 2 dogs in one household became sick and [were] taken to the\nveterinarian. After a few lab tests and physical examination they\ndiagnosed brucellosis, as serological tests for _Brucella canis_ were\npositive. The veterinary recommendation, which actually was followed, was\nto sacrifice the dogs.\nFurther testing of 16 dogs living in the community showed 10 of them\npositive for _Brucella canis_. There have been no cases of adults or\nchildren presenting with symptoms that could suggest brucellosis; however\nthere is a big concern among families about children contracting the\ndisease considering the close contact they usually have with them.\nWe would appreciate input on how to manage this problem, estimation of risk\nfor humans, need of serological testing for humans contacts, advice on what\nto do (treatment, evaluation, follow up) with serologically positive but\nasymptomatic dogs and recommendations for further investigation of the\noutbreak.\n[It is very important to distinguish the genus and species causing human\nbrucellosis to evaluate the risk. Human infections due to _Brucella\nabortus_, _B. melitensis_ or _B. suis_ (originating with farm animals) can\nbe severe and require strict measures for control. Although I must admit I\nam not up to date on this subject, some time ago cases of _B. canis_ in\nhumans were rare, only 15 cases (8 of them originating in the laboratory)\nbetween discovery of the organism in 1966 and 1979, when LE Carmichael\nwrote his section in Jim Steele's CRC Handbook of the Zoonoses. More\nimportantly _B. canis_ caused a mild human disease which is easily\ntreatable with tetracycline. The disease was originally reported in kennel\ndogs and control consisted of removing infected animals from the kennel.\nInfected individuals can be identified with serological and bacteriological\ntests. More definitive comments from anyone who has substantial experience\nin such situations would be appreciated.\nIt appears that the condominium dog population may be large enough to\nsupport ongoing transmission. I wonder if the condominium housing pattern\nallowed a large enough population of dogs to live in close proximity and\ntherefore provide _B. canis_ with a new environment to exploit. - Mod.PC]\n--\nPablo Agustin Vial\nAssociate Professor\nUniversidad Catolica de Chile School of Medicine\nand Center for Medical Research.\n......................................pc/es\n*##########################################################*\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.
