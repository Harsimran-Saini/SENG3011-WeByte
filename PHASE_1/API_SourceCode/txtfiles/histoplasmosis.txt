The training took place between [16 and 19 May 2017], but only now did the symptoms begin to be felt by the group. The information was confirmed by the DF Health Department and the Fire Department.\n\nAccording to the Department, at least 18 people, including students and instructors, had headaches and a persistent fever. A total of 11 are being treated at the Hospital Maria Auxiliadora, a private institution in the Gama region, and a military man is hospitalized at the Regional Hospital of the North Wing (Hran). The other soldiers have been discharged. The briefing said 25 firefighters participated in the training. All the soldiers are in epidemiological investigation and will be monitored.\n\nIn G1, firefighters said that during the test preparation, the instructors of the corporation did not realize the amount of bats that were in the cave. In a statement, the Health Department said that a Health Surveillance team inspected the cave and that the area was isolated.

Infection causes histoplasmosis. Although the fungus that causes histoplasmosis can be found in temperate climates throughout the world, it is endemic to the Ohio, Missouri, and Mississippi River valleys in the United States. Internationally, the fungus is predominantly found in river valleys in North and Central America, eastern and southern Europe, and parts of Africa, eastern Asia, and Australia.\n\n\"The soil in areas endemic for histoplasmosis provides an acidic damp environment with high organic content that is good for mycelial growth. Highly infectious soil is found near areas inhabited by bats and birds. Birds cannot be infected by the fungus and do not transmit the disease; however, bird excretions contaminate the soil, thereby enriching the growth medium for the mycelium. In contrast, bats can become infected, and they transmit histoplasmosis through droppings. Contaminated soil can be potentially infectious for years. Outbreaks of histoplasmosis have been associated with construction and renovation activities that disrupt contaminated soil. In addition, travelers to endemic areas are at risk for histoplasmosis because airborne spores can travel hundreds of feet.\n\n\"Most individuals with histoplasmosis are asymptomatic. Those who develop clinical manifestations are usually immunocompromised or are exposed to a high quantity of inoculum. _Histoplasma_ species may remain latent in healed granulomas and recur, if there is impairment of cell-mediated immunity.\n\n\"Approximately 90 per cent of patients are asymptomatic. If symptoms develop, onset occurs 3-14 days after exposure. Fever, headache, malaise, myalgia, abdominal pain, and chills are common symptoms; usually, histoplasmosis is self-limited. Individuals exposed to a large inoculum may develop severe dyspnea resulting from diffuse pulmonary involvement. Joint pain and skin lesions occur in 5-6 per cent of patients, mostly in females. Enlarged hilar [the hilum is part of a gland or organ through which ducts, nerves, or blood vessels enter and leave] and mediastinal lymph nodes are present in 5-10 per cent of patients. Cough, hemoptysis, dyspnea, and/or chest pain may be present and are related to the degree of compression on the pulmonary airway and circulation.

Infection causes histoplasmosis. Although the fungus that causes histoplasmosis can be found in temperate climates throughout the world, it is endemic to the Ohio, Missouri, and Mississippi River valleys in the United States. Internationally, the fungus is predominantly found in river valleys in North and Central America, eastern and southern Europe, and parts of Africa, eastern Asia, and Australia.\n\n\"The soil in areas endemic for histoplasmosis provides an acidic damp environment with high organic content that is good for mycelial growth. Highly infectious soil is found near areas inhabited by bats and birds. Birds cannot be infected by the fungus and do not transmit the disease; however, bird excretions contaminate the soil, thereby enriching the growth medium for the mycelium. In contrast, bats can become infected, and they transmit histoplasmosis through droppings. Contaminated soil can be potentially infectious for years. Outbreaks of histoplasmosis have been associated with construction and renovation activities that disrupt contaminated soil. In addition, travelers to endemic areas are at risk for histoplasmosis because airborne spores can travel hundreds of feet.\n\n\"Most individuals with histoplasmosis are asymptomatic. Those who develop clinical manifestations are usually immunocompromised or are exposed to a high quantity of inoculum. _Histoplasma_ species may remain latent in healed granulomas and recur, if there is impairment of cell-mediated immunity.\n\n\"Approximately 90 per cent of patients are asymptomatic. If symptoms develop, onset occurs 3-14 days after exposure. Fever, headache, malaise, myalgia, abdominal pain, and chills are common symptoms; usually, histoplasmosis is self-limited. Individuals exposed to a large inoculum may develop severe dyspnea resulting from diffuse pulmonary involvement. Joint pain and skin lesions occur in 5-6 per cent of patients, mostly in females. Enlarged hilar [the hilum is part of a gland or organ through which ducts, nerves, or blood vessels enter and leave] and mediastinal lymph nodes are present in 5-10 per cent of patients. Cough, hemoptysis, dyspnea, and/or chest pain may be present and are related to the degree of compression on the pulmonary airway and circulation.

Infection causes histoplasmosis. Although the fungus that causes histoplasmosis can be found in temperate climates throughout the world, it is endemic to the Ohio, Missouri, and Mississippi River valleys in the United States. Internationally, the fungus is predominantly found in river valleys in North and Central America, eastern and southern Europe, and parts of Africa, eastern Asia, and Australia.\n\n\"The soil in areas endemic for histoplasmosis provides an acidic damp environment with high organic content that is good for mycelial growth. Highly infectious soil is found near areas inhabited by bats and birds. Birds cannot be infected by the fungus and do not transmit the disease; however, bird excretions contaminate the soil, thereby enriching the growth medium for the mycelium. In contrast, bats can become infected, and they transmit histoplasmosis through droppings. Contaminated soil can be potentially infectious for years. Outbreaks of histoplasmosis have been associated with construction and renovation activities that disrupt contaminated soil. In addition, travelers to endemic areas are at risk for histoplasmosis because airborne spores can travel hundreds of feet.\n\n\"Most individuals with histoplasmosis are asymptomatic.

Laboratory-confirmed histoplasmosis was diagnosed in one camp counselor. DCHD and the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services (NDHHS) investigated the extent and source of the outbreak to prevent further infections.\n\nHistoplasmosis is a common fungal infection in the United States (1) and is a cause of respiratory illness outbreaks in endemic areas, which include areas in the midwestern states, and particularly the Mississippi and Ohio River valleys (2). Illness usually is acquired from inhalation of soil contaminated with bird or bat droppings (2); human-to-human transmission does not occur. Symptoms include fever, headache, and respiratory symptoms, although infected persons can remain asymptomatic (2). Most patients will recover regardless of treatment, but severe disease can lead to respiratory failure and should be treated; immunocompromised patients are at high risk for developing histoplasmosis that spreads throughout the body (2).\n\nAll camp counselors and camp attendees' parents were informed of the outbreak. Counselors were requested to complete a questionnaire to report their demographic information, activities, campsite assignments, and symptoms. All camp attendees' parents were administered a separate Internet-based questionnaire regarding their child's week of attendance and symptoms. Campsite assignments were obtained from camp administrators.\n\nSerum and urine samples from all counselors were tested by enzyme immunoassay for _Histoplasma capsulatum_ antigen to detect active infection. Parents of all attendees were mailed a letter explaining the symptoms of histoplasmosis, treatment and testing indications, and that testing could be performed free of charge if they desired.\n\nA confirmed case of histoplasmosis was defined as a serum or urine test positive for _H. capsulatum_, regardless of the person's symptoms, at any time after that person's arrival at camp. A suspected case was defined as illness comprising self-reported fever and at least one additional symptom (headache, chest pain, shortness of breath, or cough) in a camp counselor or attendee beginning 3 days or more after camp arrival during 21 May-27 Jun 2012, regardless of that person's test results.\n\nAmong the 32 counselors, 19 (17 confirmed, 2 suspected) (59 percent) had illness meeting the case definition, 11 (34 percent) were symptomatic with fever and at least one additional symptom, and 10 (31 percent) sought medical care for their symptoms. No hospitalizations or deaths occurred. Median age of the counselors was 20 years (range: 18-23 years). No specific activities or campsite assignments were associated with illness when confirmed and suspected cases were combined; however, when suspected cases were excluded, digging fire pits was associated with increased risk for illness among persons with confirmed illness (risk ratio [RR] = 2.7; Fisher's exact test p-value = 0.01).\n\nCamp activities had occurred in a wooded park with 12 campsites, 9 of which were open, dirt-floor shelters with roofs supported by posts. During 21-25 May 2012, counselors participated in a precamp clean-up week. Activities included raking leaves, cleaning picnic tables, digging fire pits, and moving firewood; counselors did not wear personal protective equipment while cleaning. They reported observing bat guano on picnic tables and dirt floors in 2 of the shelters. Day camps began on 4 Jun 2012, each lasting from Monday through Friday. Campers were aged 6-14 years (median: 9 years); each was assigned to one campsite where activities included cooking on wood-fired grills and eating at picnic tables. Camp activities included nature walks, outdoor games, wilderness skill training, archery, and arts and crafts; all campers participated in these activities, but none participated in high-risk activities (e.g., digging in dirt, digging fire pits, raking leaves, or cleaning campsites).\n\nOf 797 children attending camps, questionnaires were completed on 142 (18 percent), and laboratory testing was performed on 21 (3 percent). Laboratory or questionnaire data were obtained for 153 (19 percent) children, of whom 17 (11.1 percent) had illness meeting the case definition for histoplasmosis (5 confirmed, 12 suspected). A multilevel logistic regression model with a random effect for campsite was used to compare illnesses among 18 children assigned to the 2 campsites where guano was identified, 32 children assigned to 2 campsites 20 yards or less from campsites with guano, and 92 children assigned to 8 campsites 21 yards or more from campsites with guano (referent group). Compared with the referent group, children assigned to campsites with guano had 2.4 times the odds of illness (95 percent confidence interval [CI] = 0.5-11.4), and children assigned to campsites 20 yards or less from campsites with guano had 2.2 times the odds of illness (95 percent CI = 0.5-8.2). A decreasing trend in illness occurred with increasing distance from campsites with guano (Cochran-Armitage test p-value = 0.04).\n\nDuring a visit by DCHD and NDHHS personnel on 26 Jun 2012, bat guano was noted on picnic tables and dirt floors at 2 campsites. At that time, DCHD and NDHHS recommended closing these campsites, and the areas were fenced off. Soil samples of all campsites and other areas of the park were obtained for _Histoplasma_ testing; results are pending.\n\nThe probable infection source in this outbreak was campsite contamination of soil and picnic tables by bat guano, which likely became aerosolized during camp activities or clean-up before camper arrival. No other potential sources of infection were identified. Subsequent to this investigation, the city parks and recreation division relocated the day camp to a different park. The health department provided recommendations to the city's parks and recreation division regarding prevention of bat roosting, procedures for inspecting and identifying potentially contaminated areas, and procedures to mitigate biohazardous sites contaminated with _Histoplasma_ (3). Persons living in endemic areas should be aware that exposure to aerosolized soil or guano in sites with bird or bat droppings can lead to histoplasmosis, should avoid such exposures, and should seek professional assistance for cleanup efforts.\n\nReferences:\n1.

The fungus lives in soil fertilized by bird or bat droppings. In the United States, the fungus is endemic in the Mississippi and Ohio River Valleys. Lung infection can occur after a person inhales aerosolized microscopic fungal spores, usually after disturbing, e.g., digging, contaminated soil.\n\nMost individuals with histoplasmosis are asymptomatic. The symptoms of histoplasmosis are non-specific and similar to pneumonia from any cause. However, the pulmonary infection can disseminate throughout the body, and immunocompromised individuals may develop a severe form of histoplasmosis called progressive disseminated disease. Histoplasmosis cannot be transmitted from person to person or from animals to people. Antifungal drugs are used to treat severe cases of acute histoplasmosis and all cases of chronic pulmonary or disseminated disease.

DCHD and the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services (NDHHS) investigated the extent and source of the outbreak to prevent further infections.\n\nHistoplasmosis is a common fungal infection in the United States (1) and is a cause of respiratory illness outbreaks in endemic areas, which include areas in the midwestern states, and particularly the Mississippi and Ohio River valleys (2). Illness usually is acquired from inhalation of soil contaminated with bird or bat droppings (2); human-to-human transmission does not occur. Symptoms include fever, headache, and respiratory symptoms, although infected persons can remain asymptomatic (2). Most patients will recover regardless of treatment, but severe disease can lead to respiratory failure and should be treated; immunocompromised patients are at high risk for developing histoplasmosis that spreads throughout the body (2).\n\nAll camp counselors and camp attendees' parents were informed of the outbreak. Counselors were requested to complete a questionnaire to report their demographic information, activities, campsite assignments, and symptoms. All camp attendees' parents were administered a separate Internet-based questionnaire regarding their child's week of attendance and symptoms. Campsite assignments were obtained from camp administrators.\n\nSerum and urine samples from all counselors were tested by enzyme immunoassay for _Histoplasma capsulatum_ antigen to detect active infection. Parents of all attendees were mailed a letter explaining the symptoms of histoplasmosis, treatment and testing indications, and that testing could be performed free of charge if they desired.\n\nA confirmed case of histoplasmosis was defined as a serum or urine test positive for _H. capsulatum_, regardless of the person's symptoms, at any time after that person's arrival at camp. A suspected case was defined as illness comprising self-reported fever and at least one additional symptom (headache, chest pain, shortness of breath, or cough) in a camp counselor or attendee beginning 3 days or more after camp arrival during 21 May-27 Jun 2012, regardless of that person's test results.\n\nAmong the 32 counselors, 19 (17 confirmed, 2 suspected) (59 percent) had illness meeting the case definition, 11 (34 percent) were symptomatic with fever and at least one additional symptom, and 10 (31 percent) sought medical care for their symptoms. No hospitalizations or deaths occurred. Median age of the counselors was 20 years (range: 18-23 years). No specific activities or campsite assignments were associated with illness when confirmed and suspected cases were combined; however, when suspected cases were excluded, digging fire pits was associated with increased risk for illness among persons with confirmed illness (risk ratio [RR] = 2.7; Fisher's exact test p-value = 0.01).\n\nCamp activities had occurred in a wooded park with 12 campsites, 9 of which were open, dirt-floor shelters with roofs supported by posts. During 21-25 May 2012, counselors participated in a precamp clean-up week. Activities included raking leaves, cleaning picnic tables, digging fire pits, and moving firewood; counselors did not wear personal protective equipment while cleaning. They reported observing bat guano on picnic tables and dirt floors in 2 of the shelters. Day camps began on 4 Jun 2012, each lasting from Monday through Friday. Campers were aged 6-14 years (median: 9 years); each was assigned to one campsite where activities included cooking on wood-fired grills and eating at picnic tables. Camp activities included nature walks, outdoor games, wilderness skill training, archery, and arts and crafts; all campers participated in these activities, but none participated in high-risk activities (e.g., digging in dirt, digging fire pits, raking leaves, or cleaning campsites).\n\nOf 797 children attending camps, questionnaires were completed on 142 (18 percent), and laboratory testing was performed on 21 (3 percent). Laboratory or questionnaire data were obtained for 153 (19 percent) children, of whom 17 (11.1 percent) had illness meeting the case definition for histoplasmosis (5 confirmed, 12 suspected). A multilevel logistic regression model with a random effect for campsite was used to compare illnesses among 18 children assigned to the 2 campsites where guano was identified, 32 children assigned to 2 campsites 20 yards or less from campsites with guano, and 92 children assigned to 8 campsites 21 yards or more from campsites with guano (referent group). Compared with the referent group, children assigned to campsites with guano had 2.4 times the odds of illness (95 percent confidence interval [CI] = 0.5-11.4), and children assigned to campsites 20 yards or less from campsites with guano had 2.2 times the odds of illness (95 percent CI = 0.5-8.2). A decreasing trend in illness occurred with increasing distance from campsites with guano (Cochran-Armitage test p-value = 0.04).\n\nDuring a visit by DCHD and NDHHS personnel on 26 Jun 2012, bat guano was noted on picnic tables and dirt floors at 2 campsites. At that time, DCHD and NDHHS recommended closing these campsites, and the areas were fenced off. Soil samples of all campsites and other areas of the park were obtained for _Histoplasma_ testing; results are pending.\n\nThe probable infection source in this outbreak was campsite contamination of soil and picnic tables by bat guano, which likely became aerosolized during camp activities or clean-up before camper arrival. No other potential sources of infection were identified. Subsequent to this investigation, the city parks and recreation division relocated the day camp to a different park. The health department provided recommendations to the city's parks and recreation division regarding prevention of bat roosting, procedures for inspecting and identifying potentially contaminated areas, and procedures to mitigate biohazardous sites contaminated with _Histoplasma_ (3). Persons living in endemic areas should be aware that exposure to aerosolized soil or guano in sites with bird or bat droppings can lead to histoplasmosis, should avoid such exposures, and should seek professional assistance for cleanup efforts.\n\nReferences:\n1.

Lung infection can occur after a person inhales aerosolized microscopic fungal spores, usually after disturbing, e.g., digging, contaminated soil.\n\nMost individuals with histoplasmosis are asymptomatic. The symptoms of histoplasmosis are non-specific and similar to pneumonia from any cause. However, the pulmonary infection can disseminate throughout the body, and immunocompromised individuals may develop a severe form of histoplasmosis called progressive disseminated disease.

Campers were aged 6-14 years (median: 9 years); each was assigned to one campsite where activities included cooking on wood-fired grills and eating at picnic tables. Camp activities included nature walks, outdoor games, wilderness skill training, archery, and arts and crafts; all campers participated in these activities, but none participated in high-risk activities (e.g., digging in dirt, digging fire pits, raking leaves, or cleaning campsites).\n\nOf 797 children attending camps, questionnaires were completed on 142 (18 percent), and laboratory testing was performed on 21 (3 percent). Laboratory or questionnaire data were obtained for 153 (19 percent) children, of whom 17 (11.1 percent) had illness meeting the case definition for histoplasmosis (5 confirmed, 12 suspected). A multilevel logistic regression model with a random effect for campsite was used to compare illnesses among 18 children assigned to the 2 campsites where guano was identified, 32 children assigned to 2 campsites 20 yards or less from campsites with guano, and 92 children assigned to 8 campsites 21 yards or more from campsites with guano (referent group). Compared with the referent group, children assigned to campsites with guano had 2.4 times the odds of illness (95 percent confidence interval [CI] = 0.5-11.4), and children assigned to campsites 20 yards or less from campsites with guano had 2.2 times the odds of illness (95 percent CI = 0.5-8.2). A decreasing trend in illness occurred with increasing distance from campsites with guano (Cochran-Armitage test p-value = 0.04).\n\nDuring a visit by DCHD and NDHHS personnel on 26 Jun 2012, bat guano was noted on picnic tables and dirt floors at 2 campsites. At that time, DCHD and NDHHS recommended closing these campsites, and the areas were fenced off. Soil samples of all campsites and other areas of the park were obtained for _Histoplasma_ testing; results are pending.\n\nThe probable infection source in this outbreak was campsite contamination of soil and picnic tables by bat guano, which likely became aerosolized during camp activities or clean-up before camper arrival. No other potential sources of infection were identified. Subsequent to this investigation, the city parks and recreation division relocated the day camp to a different park. The health department provided recommendations to the city's parks and recreation division regarding prevention of bat roosting, procedures for inspecting and identifying potentially contaminated areas, and procedures to mitigate biohazardous sites contaminated with _Histoplasma_ (3). Persons living in endemic areas should be aware that exposure to aerosolized soil or guano in sites with bird or bat droppings can lead to histoplasmosis, should avoid such exposures, and should seek professional assistance for cleanup efforts.\n\nReferences:\n1.

Laboratory-confirmed histoplasmosis was diagnosed in one camp counselor. DCHD and the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services (NDHHS) investigated the extent and source of the outbreak to prevent further infections.\n\nHistoplasmosis is a common fungal infection in the United States (1) and is a cause of respiratory illness outbreaks in endemic areas, which include areas in the midwestern states, and particularly the Mississippi and Ohio River valleys (2). Illness usually is acquired from inhalation of soil contaminated with bird or bat droppings (2); human-to-human transmission does not occur. Symptoms include fever, headache, and respiratory symptoms, although infected persons can remain asymptomatic (2). Most patients will recover regardless of treatment, but severe disease can lead to respiratory failure and should be treated; immunocompromised patients are at high risk for developing histoplasmosis that spreads throughout the body (2).\n\nAll camp counselors and camp attendees' parents were informed of the outbreak. Counselors were requested to complete a questionnaire to report their demographic information, activities, campsite assignments, and symptoms. All camp attendees' parents were administered a separate Internet-based questionnaire regarding their child's week of attendance and symptoms. Campsite assignments were obtained from camp administrators.\n\nSerum and urine samples from all counselors were tested by enzyme immunoassay for _Histoplasma capsulatum_ antigen to detect active infection. Parents of all attendees were mailed a letter explaining the symptoms of histoplasmosis, treatment and testing indications, and that testing could be performed free of charge if they desired.\n\nA confirmed case of histoplasmosis was defined as a serum or urine test positive for _H. capsulatum_, regardless of the person's symptoms, at any time after that person's arrival at camp. A suspected case was defined as illness comprising self-reported fever and at least one additional symptom (headache, chest pain, shortness of breath, or cough) in a camp counselor or attendee beginning 3 days or more after camp arrival during 21 May-27 Jun 2012, regardless of that person's test results.\n\nAmong the 32 counselors, 19 (17 confirmed, 2 suspected) (59 percent) had illness meeting the case definition, 11 (34 percent) were symptomatic with fever and at least one additional symptom, and 10 (31 percent) sought medical care for their symptoms. No hospitalizations or deaths occurred. Median age of the counselors was 20 years (range: 18-23 years). No specific activities or campsite assignments were associated with illness when confirmed and suspected cases were combined; however, when suspected cases were excluded, digging fire pits was associated with increased risk for illness among persons with confirmed illness (risk ratio [RR] = 2.7; Fisher's exact test p-value = 0.01).\n\nCamp activities had occurred in a wooded park with 12 campsites, 9 of which were open, dirt-floor shelters with roofs supported by posts. During 21-25 May 2012, counselors participated in a precamp clean-up week. Activities included raking leaves, cleaning picnic tables, digging fire pits, and moving firewood; counselors did not wear personal protective equipment while cleaning. They reported observing bat guano on picnic tables and dirt floors in 2 of the shelters. Day camps began on 4 Jun 2012, each lasting from Monday through Friday. Campers were aged 6-14 years (median: 9 years); each was assigned to one campsite where activities included cooking on wood-fired grills and eating at picnic tables. Camp activities included nature walks, outdoor games, wilderness skill training, archery, and arts and crafts; all campers participated in these activities, but none participated in high-risk activities (e.g., digging in dirt, digging fire pits, raking leaves, or cleaning campsites).\n\nOf 797 children attending camps, questionnaires were completed on 142 (18 percent), and laboratory testing was performed on 21 (3 percent). Laboratory or questionnaire data were obtained for 153 (19 percent) children, of whom 17 (11.1 percent) had illness meeting the case definition for histoplasmosis (5 confirmed, 12 suspected). A multilevel logistic regression model with a random effect for campsite was used to compare illnesses among 18 children assigned to the 2 campsites where guano was identified, 32 children assigned to 2 campsites 20 yards or less from campsites with guano, and 92 children assigned to 8 campsites 21 yards or more from campsites with guano (referent group).

A decreasing trend in illness occurred with increasing distance from campsites with guano (Cochran-Armitage test p-value = 0.04).\n\nDuring a visit by DCHD and NDHHS personnel on 26 Jun 2012, bat guano was noted on picnic tables and dirt floors at 2 campsites.

Laboratory-confirmed histoplasmosis was diagnosed in one camp counselor. DCHD and the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services (NDHHS) investigated the extent and source of the outbreak to prevent further infections.\n\nHistoplasmosis is a common fungal infection in the United States (1) and is a cause of respiratory illness outbreaks in endemic areas, which include areas in the midwestern states, and particularly the Mississippi and Ohio River valleys (2). Illness usually is acquired from inhalation of soil contaminated with bird or bat droppings (2); human-to-human transmission does not occur. Symptoms include fever, headache, and respiratory symptoms, although infected persons can remain asymptomatic (2). Most patients will recover regardless of treatment, but severe disease can lead to respiratory failure and should be treated; immunocompromised patients are at high risk for developing histoplasmosis that spreads throughout the body (2).\n\nAll camp counselors and camp attendees' parents were informed of the outbreak. Counselors were requested to complete a questionnaire to report their demographic information, activities, campsite assignments, and symptoms. All camp attendees' parents were administered a separate Internet-based questionnaire regarding their child's week of attendance and symptoms. Campsite assignments were obtained from camp administrators.\n\nSerum and urine samples from all counselors were tested by enzyme immunoassay for _Histoplasma capsulatum_ antigen to detect active infection. Parents of all attendees were mailed a letter explaining the symptoms of histoplasmosis, treatment and testing indications, and that testing could be performed free of charge if they desired.\n\nA confirmed case of histoplasmosis was defined as a serum or urine test positive for _H. capsulatum_, regardless of the person's symptoms, at any time after that person's arrival at camp. A suspected case was defined as illness comprising self-reported fever and at least one additional symptom (headache, chest pain, shortness of breath, or cough) in a camp counselor or attendee beginning 3 days or more after camp arrival during 21 May-27 Jun 2012, regardless of that person's test results.\n\nAmong the 32 counselors, 19 (17 confirmed, 2 suspected) (59 percent) had illness meeting the case definition, 11 (34 percent) were symptomatic with fever and at least one additional symptom, and 10 (31 percent) sought medical care for their symptoms. No hospitalizations or deaths occurred. Median age of the counselors was 20 years (range: 18-23 years). No specific activities or campsite assignments were associated with illness when confirmed and suspected cases were combined; however, when suspected cases were excluded, digging fire pits was associated with increased risk for illness among persons with confirmed illness (risk ratio [RR] = 2.7; Fisher's exact test p-value = 0.01).\n\nCamp activities had occurred in a wooded park with 12 campsites, 9 of which were open, dirt-floor shelters with roofs supported by posts. During 21-25 May 2012, counselors participated in a precamp clean-up week. Activities included raking leaves, cleaning picnic tables, digging fire pits, and moving firewood; counselors did not wear personal protective equipment while cleaning. They reported observing bat guano on picnic tables and dirt floors in 2 of the shelters. Day camps began on 4 Jun 2012, each lasting from Monday through Friday. Campers were aged 6-14 years (median: 9 years); each was assigned to one campsite where activities included cooking on wood-fired grills and eating at picnic tables. Camp activities included nature walks, outdoor games, wilderness skill training, archery, and arts and crafts; all campers participated in these activities, but none participated in high-risk activities (e.g., digging in dirt, digging fire pits, raking leaves, or cleaning campsites).\n\nOf 797 children attending camps, questionnaires were completed on 142 (18 percent), and laboratory testing was performed on 21 (3 percent). Laboratory or questionnaire data were obtained for 153 (19 percent) children, of whom 17 (11.1 percent) had illness meeting the case definition for histoplasmosis (5 confirmed, 12 suspected). A multilevel logistic regression model with a random effect for campsite was used to compare illnesses among 18 children assigned to the 2 campsites where guano was identified, 32 children assigned to 2 campsites 20 yards or less from campsites with guano, and 92 children assigned to 8 campsites 21 yards or more from campsites with guano (referent group). Compared with the referent group, children assigned to campsites with guano had 2.4 times the odds of illness (95 percent confidence interval [CI] = 0.5-11.4), and children assigned to campsites 20 yards or less from campsites with guano had 2.2 times the odds of illness (95 percent CI = 0.5-8.2). A decreasing trend in illness occurred with increasing distance from campsites with guano (Cochran-Armitage test p-value = 0.04).\n\nDuring a visit by DCHD and NDHHS personnel on 26 Jun 2012, bat guano was noted on picnic tables and dirt floors at 2 campsites. At that time, DCHD and NDHHS recommended closing these campsites, and the areas were fenced off. Soil samples of all campsites and other areas of the park were obtained for _Histoplasma_ testing; results are pending.\n\nThe probable infection source in this outbreak was campsite contamination of soil and picnic tables by bat guano, which likely became aerosolized during camp activities or clean-up before camper arrival. No other potential sources of infection were identified. Subsequent to this investigation, the city parks and recreation division relocated the day camp to a different park. The health department provided recommendations to the city's parks and recreation division regarding prevention of bat roosting, procedures for inspecting and identifying potentially contaminated areas, and procedures to mitigate biohazardous sites contaminated with _Histoplasma_ (3). Persons living in endemic areas should be aware that exposure to aerosolized soil or guano in sites with bird or bat droppings can lead to histoplasmosis, should avoid such exposures, and should seek professional assistance for cleanup efforts.\n\nReferences:\n1.

It has a horizontal development of 4,292 m and a 67 m\nslope. Inner temperature ranges between 22 degrees C and 26 degrees C. The\ncave is permanently inhabited by at least three species of bats, including\na common insect eating species (_Pterotnotus parnellii_), one omnivorous\nspecies (_Phylostomus hastatus_), and a vampire bat (_Desmodus rotundus_).\nA thick layer of bat guano covered the floor of the chambers visited by the\ngroup, and the ground was noted to be dry.\nThirty four students and a teacher entered the cave to make observations\nand collect samples of soil and rocks for a biology project. Twenty eight\nstudents (17 females, 11 males; age range 15-18, median age 17) were\navailable for clinical and immunological evaluation. They remained in the\ncave an average of 20 minutes. Twenty (71.4%) of the 28 students evaluated\nbecame either acutely ill (64.3% of them) within 10-28 days (median 14\ndays); or else developed characteristic x-ray and laboratory abnormalities\n(7.1%). The teacher, a 39-year old otherwise healthy male, also became ill\n14 days after the exposure.\nSign and symptoms among the 18 ill students included fever (77.7%),\nnon-productive cough (72.2%), headache (66.6%), nausea and vomiting (50%),\nrash (38.8%), abdominal pain (38.8%) asthenia (33.3%), chest pain (22.2%),\ndyspnea (16.6%), myalgias (16.6%), and in one case (5.5%) erythema nodosum\nor jaundice.
