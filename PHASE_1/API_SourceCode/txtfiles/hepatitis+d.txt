The hepatitis-D virus most often infects intravenous drug\nusers, Patel said. \"We have published 25 000 pamphlets, and we are\ncirculating them as part of our awareness campaign,\" he said.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Brent Barrett\n\n[In ProMED archive no. 20030712.1718, Mod.CP wrote the following\nabout Hepatitis D virus infections: Because hepatitis delta virus\n(HDV) is dependent on hepatitis B virus (HBV) for replication,\nHBV/HDV co-infection can be prevented with either pre- or\npost-exposure prophylaxis for HBV. HDV infection can be acquired\neither as a co-infection with HBV or as a superinfection of persons\nwith chronic HBV infection. Persons with HBV/HDV co-infection may\nhave more severe acute disease and a higher risk of fulminant\nhepatitis (2-20 percent) compared with those infected with HBV alone;\nhowever, chronic HBV infection appears to occur less frequently in\nindividuals with HBV/HDV co-infection. Chronic HBV carriers who\nacquire HDV superinfection usually develop chronic HDV infection. In\nlong-term studies of chronic HBV carriers with HDV superinfection,\n70-80 percent have developed evidence of chronic liver diseases with\ncirrhosis compared with 15-30 percent of patients with chronic HBV\ninfection alone. Thus, prevention of HDV superinfection depends\nprimarily on education to reduce risk behaviors. In some Latin\nAmerican countries in the Amazon River Basin, periodic epidemics of\nHDV infection have occurred among chronic HBV carriers in relatively\nisolated regions. Disease related to HDV infection in these outbreaks\nhas been very severe, with rapid progression to fulminant hepatitis\nand case-fatality rates of 10-20 percent. The cause of the atypical\ncourse of HDV infection in these populations is unknown.\n\nThe modes of HDV transmission are similar to those for HBV, with\npercutaneous exposures the most efficient. Sexual transmission of HDV\nis less efficient than for HBV. Perinatal HDV transmission is rare.\nThe serologic course of HDV infection varies depending on whether the\nvirus is acquired as a co-infection with HBV or as a superinfection\nof a person with chronic HBV infection. In most persons with HBV/HDV\nco-infection, both IgM antibody to HDV (anti-HDV) and IgG anti-HDV\nare detectable during the course of infection. However, in about 15\npercent of patients, the only evidence of HDV infection may be the\ndetection of either IgM anti-HDV alone during the early acute period\nof illness or IgG anti-HDV alone during convalescence. Anti-HDV\ngenerally declines to sub-detectable levels after the infection\nresolves, and there is no serologic marker that persists to indicate\nthat the patient was ever infected with HDV. Hepatitis Delta antigen\n(HDAg) can be detected in serum in only about 25 percent of patients\nwith HBV-HDV co-infection. When HDAg is detectable, it generally\ndisappears as HBsAg disappears, and most patients do not develop\nchronic infection. - Mod.CP]\n\n[The basis on which the HDV diagnosis was made in this Indian\noutbreak was not indicated in the above report.

A total of 4 deaths have been reported, 3 of them children\nbelonging to the same family. The other case was a 27-year-old man from\nMaine (Villa Rica).\nThe first case was an 8-year-old boy with abdominal pain and somnolence\nthat rapidly progressed to lethargy, severe pain, and icterus. He was\ntransferred to a hospital of Lima (the Peruvian capital) where he died 3\ndays later on 14 April 2003. The Instituto Nacional de Salud (National\nInstitute of Health, NIH) tested a serum sample finding total anti-HBc\n(+ve), IgM anti-HBc (-ve), HBsAg (+ve), total anti-D (+ve).\nThe second case was his sister, a 16-year-old girl, and the third case was\ntheir brother, a 13-year-old boy. All of them have similar symptoms,\nserology, and a diagnosis of acute liver failure. The fourth case died on\nSun 6 Jul 2003. He had no contact with these children before, but this\ncirrhotic patient was hospitalized due to gastrointestinal bleeding in\nApril in a bed near the 8-year-old boy.\nVilla Rica is a jungle-like area, endemic for viral hepatitis B, but there\nhas been no previous report of hepatitis delta virus. Yellow fever,\nmalaria, and listeriosis have been occasionally reported in this district.\nCurrently, there are no data about the transmission of hepatitis delta\nvirus to the first case. Nevertheless, [this boy and his brother may have\nhad contact with migrants] from endemic areas for hepatitis B, and probably\nhepatitis D. The Ministry of Health may declare an epidemiologic emergency\nfor Villa Rica this Monday [13 Jul 2003]. The plan is: education about\ntransmission, vaccination [against hepatitis B virus] for all the people\nliving in Cedropampa, and serologic surveillance.\n--\nJose Carlos Alva-Munoz, MD\nHospital General de Oxapampa\nDepartment of Epidemiology, Chief\nPasco - Peru\n<jcalva@postmaster.co.uk>\n[Because hepatitis delta virus (HDV) is dependent on hepatitis B virus\n(HBV) for replication, HBV/HDV co-infection can be prevented with either\npre- or post-exposure prophylaxis for HBV.
