A\ntotal of 227 contacts (having direct or suspected contact with the\nblood or other body fluids of a case) have been identified and are\nunder active follow up.\nOf the 27 cases, 16 were detected in Gabon and 11 in the neighbouring\nvillages of the Republic of the Congo. As of Wed 19 Dec 2001, 133\ncontacts are being followed up in Gabon and 94 in the Republic of the\nCongo. The international team is operational on both sides of the\nborder and is working closely in the field with the team from the\nCongolese Ministry of Health on outbreak control interventions.\n[A detailed map is available at the WHO web-site address given\nabove...\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[Since the last WHO update on 19 Dec 2001, there has been an\nescalation in the number of cases and confirmed contacts. These are\nlargely accounted for by the reports coming from neighboring villages\nin the Democratic Republic of Congo. These cases appear to represent\nspread from the outbreak in Gabon and are not related to the suspected\nviral hemorrhagic fever outbreak previously reported from the central\nprovince of Kasai Occidental [in the Democratic Republic of Congo,\nwhich is a different country altogether. - Mod.CP\n..........................cp/mpp/jw\n*##########################################################*\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.
