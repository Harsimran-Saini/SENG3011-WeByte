National Hepatitis Awareness month calls attention to the potentially deadly infection that can cause cirrhosis or liver cancer -- and how to avoid it.\n\n\"Cases of acute and chronic hepatitis C in Pierce County are on a dramatic rise, especially among young people,\" said Kim Desmarais, Tacoma-Pierce County Health Department viral hepatitis coordinator. \"Before 2013, we saw up to 5 cases a year. Now we see up to 5 cases a month.\" In response to the increase in cases, the health department works with medical providers and community partners to report, test, and manage patients with hepatitis C. The department also works to make sure these patients understand ways to stop the spread of the virus, and find treatment options for hepatitis and drug addiction. Injection drug use spreads hepatitis C.\n\nReports the Health Department receives of new hepatitis C cases are just the tip of the iceberg. Many with the infection may not know they have it. The Health Department estimates the new cases reported monthly in Pierce County represent fewer than 10 percent of the actual total. According to the CDC, as many as 3.9 million Americans have hepatitis C, but only half know they're infected. The number of people who have had hepatitis C for a long time but are just now finding out has increased because of a recommendation for doctors to routinely test people in the baby boomer generation.\n\nHeroin and other illegal injection drug use are factors in the nationwide increase of hepatitis C cases, according to the CDC. Shared drugs and syringes spread the infection. In a 2015 survey, the University of Washington Alcohol and Drug Abuse Institute asked 77 needle exchange participants in Pierce County (referenced in the Opioid Trends for Pierce County Report) which drugs they injected. The majority (74 percent) said heroin, 22 percent said methamphetamine. When the ADAI looked at survey results from 18 needle exchange programs in the state, including Pierce County, researchers found 69 percent injected heroin and 22 percent methamphetamine.\n\nHealthcare professionals can now treat and cure hepatitis C in as little as 8 weeks with very few side effects. In the past, medication was not as effective, took almost a year to work, and caused severe side effects. For these reasons, many patients decided not to take them. People with previously diagnosed hepatitis C should ask their doctor for a referral to a specialist who can evaluate them for the newer treatment.\n\nDuring May 2017, people can learn their exposure risk, the consequences if they don't get treatment and the importance of testing. May 19 is National Hepatitis Testing Day.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[2] Pennsylvania - interventions\nDate: Wed 17 May 2017\nSource: Governing Magazine/Tribune News Service, The Philadelphia Inquirer report [edited]\nhttp://www.governing.com/topics/health-human-services/Hepatitis-C-Patients-Will-Receive-Treatment-Through-Medicaid-in-Pa.html\n\n\nUnder pressure from advocacy organizations that had threatened a lawsuit, the Wolf administration said [Tue 16 May 2017], that it would expand Medicaid coverage for treatment of hepatitis C, a major change that many states have put off over fear of spiraling costs. \"Today's announcement means that thousands of vulnerable Pennsylvanians will soon have easier access to pharmaceuticals that can cure hepatitis C,\" Department of Human Services Secretary Ted Dallas said in a statement.\n\nUntil now, state policy had been to wait until patients showed signs of liver damage before approving treatment. Allowing earlier treatment was recommended 1 year ago by the department's Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee. As time passed without a decision, observers wondered whether the state was trying to determine how to pay for the highly effective but costly new drugs that have made hepatitis C a curable disease.\n\nNew hepatitis C infections tripled in 5 years, the CDC reported last week, driven largely by the opioid epidemic. The bloodborne hepatitis C virus is easily spread by sharing needles to inject heroin or crushed prescription pain pills. But the virus can grow undetected for decades before causing chronic and sometimes life-threatening liver problems. An estimated 3 million Americans are living with chronic hepatitis C, about half of them undiagnosed. The new website HepVu estimated last month that 142 000 Pennsylvania residents are living with hepatitis C antibodies and 629 died of the disease in 2014, the latest estimates available. It said 91 000 New Jersey residents had antibodies and 446 had died that year.\n\nNew drugs that can effectively cure hepatitis C with minimal side effects began coming on the market several years ago but, as they cost tens of thousands of dollars per patient, many states limited their use to those whose disease had shown up on liver tests, and added other restrictions -- barriers that exist for no other disease.\n\n\"Hopefully, what this means is I no longer have to tell patients that their liver isn't sick enough,\" said Stacey B. Trooskin, an infectious diseases physician and director of viral hepatitis programs for Philadelphia FIGHT, a nonprofit health and social services organization. Trooskin said she likely had dozens of patients who would now qualify for coverage. She said that policymakers' fears that many Medicaid recipients would get tested and seek treatment were overblown. \"In reality, it will be more like a trickle,\" she said.\n\nHepatitis C severity is categorized on a scale of F0 through F4, with F4 being the most severe. Previously, only patients with scores of F2 through F4 were eligible for treatment under Pennsylvania Medicaid unless they had other complications. Effective [1 Jul 2017], patients with scores of F1 will be covered, the state said in its announcement, and those with scores of F0 will be covered beginning [1 Jan 2018].\n\nAbout a dozen other states have loosened restrictions in the last few years, some under pressure from advocates. New Jersey eased its restrictions last year but only down to F2, which has not satisfied physicians or advocacy groups.\n\nIn his statement, Dallas thanked several organizations, including Harvard Law School's Center for Health Law and Policy Innovation, for their help \"on finding a path forward\". The center has sued or threatened to sue several states to force decisions. It reached a settlement with Delaware in 2016.\n\nKevin Costello, the center's litigation director, said that the \"overt threat of a lawsuit\" had kept the pressure on Harrisburg to approve the change. Costello said it was not likely to be nearly as costly as some have predicted. For that reason -- as well as the tendency to budget for the short term -- the possibility of future cuts to state Medicaid programs as Congress considers repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act probably was not a significant impediment to Pennsylvania's decision to drop restrictions on hepatitis C coverage, he said.\n\nThe oft-quoted prices -- USD 84 000 for a typical 12-week course of Gilead Sciences' Sovaldi, for example -- have dropped with additional competition, Costello said, and state Medicaid programs have improved their negotiating tactics and applied substantial discounts. Indeed, a Gilead spokesman said in an email late [Tue 16 May 2017] that \"the average Medicaid price per bottle is now less than USD 10 000\" -- a total of USD 30 000 for 12 weeks -- \"for states that provide open access to all patients.\"\n\nThe Obama administration sent pointed letters to state Medicaid programs about requirements to cover treatment, and challenged pharmaceutical makers to lower prices.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, about 3750 people infected with hepatitis C will likely be affected by the policy change, said Rachel Kostelac, a spokeswoman for the Department of Human Services. \"The state's annual contribution to the Medicaid program is approximately USD 12 billion. The fiscal impact of this policy change is well below one-half of 1 percent of the state's current costs,\" Kostelac said in an email response to questions.\n\n\"The real problem here,\" said Gene Bishop, a retired internist and member of the advisory committee that recommended the change on 17 May 2016, is the pharmaceutical companies, which are charging \"outrageous prices for life-saving treatment.\" Bishop made last the 2016 motion recommending that the state's Medicaid program cover treatment for all patients. It was supported by every practitioner on the committee and opposed by every member on the payer side, she recalled, adding that she had not expected the motion to prevail.\n\n[Byline: Don Sapatkin]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[3] Missouri\nDate: Wed 17 May 2017, 6:27 PM\nSource: KSHB [edited]\nhttp://www.kshb.com/news/local-news/hepatitis-c-rising-in-kansas-city-with-opioid-epidemic-rediscover-says\n\n\nThe opioid epidemic in the United States is bringing about another serious problem: Hepatitis C. New data from the CDC shows new Hep C infections almost tripled in 5 years. New infections rose from 850 in 2010 to 2436 in 2015. It's taking a toll in the Kansas City metro, where ReDiscover says 1 in 5 people who walk into its opioid treatment clinic will be diagnosed with Hep C.\n\nOne woman calls herself an old drug addict but is now using her story to help educate others. \"I remember the exact night I got Hep C,\" Duffel said. Her drug addiction was so powerful she picked up a heroin needle her infected husband had just used. \"The next minute I'm looking at the syringe thinking, I want that so bad, and I know if I use his needle, it was the only one, I would get Hep C,\" she said. \"I remember as I was pushing it in my arm I'm going, I'm sick. I'm going to be really sick. And I was.\" She is one of millions of Americans who have Hepatitis C, a disease that destroys the liver.\n\nThe face of this disease is getting younger and younger. Sarita Wise, a nurse at ReDiscover's drug treatment clinic, says the opioid epidemic is to blame. Since January 2017, out of 22 new clients at the clinic, 16 tested positive for Hep C. The CDC says the highest rates of Hep C are among young people who inject drugs, and the same group accounts for 75 percent of new Hep C cases a year.\n\nThe disease is highly contagious. \"Dried blood, equipment used for making drugs, whether it's snorting it or with straws, tourniquets, cotton balls. If they're not aware there are even small amounts of blood on it, they can infect themselves that way,\" Wise said.\n\nMany of the patients that go to drug treatment clinics may be low-income and don't go to a primary care physician regularly, so the disease goes undetected. Wise says that's when it does real damage. \"I think that's why we're starting to see the trend in the opioid treatment programs because we're doing that initial screening up-front. That's also to educate them about why they should continue to come to our programs, so they won't engage in risky behaviors,\" Wise said.\n\nReDiscover says while it is good news that young people are being diagnosed early on, many people, like this woman, can't afford the Hep C drug treatments. They can cost tens of thousands of dollars, but can also cure the disease. ReDiscover has to rely heavily on federal grants that can help people get access.\n\n[Byline: Sarah Plake]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Most cases of acute hepatitis C are not recognized or reported because they are asymptomatic or anicteric (without jaundice) so the case numbers are likely underreported.\n\nIn the absence of a vaccine for hepatitis C (as are available for hepatitis A and B), infection avoidance techniques such as needle exchange programs and the need for aggressive available programs in counseling, not criminalizing, substance addiction are vitally needed. There is no evidence that government sponsored needle exchange programs increase the amount of substance abuse. - Mod.LL\n\nAn additional (public health) benefit of treatment is that patients who are cured no longer transmit hepatitis C. Thus treatment is also a form of prevention. - Mod.LM\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/227.]\nSee Also\nHepatitis C - USA (06): injection drug use, state policies 20170513.5034250\nHepatitis C - USA (05): (MN) injection drug use 20170430.5004619\nHepatitis C - USA (04): (MA) injecting drug use 20170428.5002070\nHepatitis C - USA (03): (NH) injection drug use 20170405.4949994\nHepatitis B & C - global: WHO update 20170421.4985250\nHepatitis C - USA (02): (TX) reused saline flush syringes, 2015 20170309.4890696\nHepatitis C - USA: (IA) 20170223.4860273\n2016\n----\nHepatitis C - USA (13): (MA,KY) injection drug use 20161118.4638318\nHepatitis C - USA (12): (AK) injection drug use 20161021.4576120\nHepatitis C - USA (11): (AL) injection drug use 20161018.4568826\nHepatitis C - USA (10): (IN) injecting drug use 20161004.4535910\nHepatitis C - USA (09): (MA) injecting drug use 20160909.4477541\nHepatitis B - USA (07) :(ME) injection drug use 20160907.4469090\nHepatitis C - USA (08): (AK) injecting drug use 20160827.4445804\nHepatitis C - USA (07): (KY) injecting drug use, pregnant women 20160808.4400600\nHepatitis B & C - USA (02): (WV) cardiac tests, expanded numbers, RFI 20160619.4296498\nHepatitis B - USA (06): (ME) injection drug use 20160615.4289817\nHepatitis C - USA (06): (UT) nosocomial spread 20160405.4140235\nHepatitis C - USA (05): fatalities, chronic infection 20160404.4136310\nHepatitis B & C - USA: (WV) cardiac tests 20160329.4126017\nHepatitis B - USA (04): (NC) injection drug use, 2015 20160303.4063893\nHepatitis C - USA (04): (KY) injection drug use 20160202.3986782\nHepatitis C - USA (03): (IN) injection drug use 20160130.3980174\nHepatitis C - USA (02): (FL) injection drug use 20160110.3923357\nHepatitis C - USA (01): (UT) nosocomial spread, RFI 20160108.3921477\nHepatitis B - USA (02): injection drug use, comment 20160206.3999152\nHepatitis B - USA: (KY, WV, TN) injection drug use 20160130.3980173\n.................................................sb/ll/ao/lxl/lm", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "hepatitis a", "hepatitis b", "hepatitis c"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2021-03-07 00:00:00", "2017-05-17 00:00:00", "2013-03-16 00:00:00", "2015-03-16 00:00:00", "2017-05-16 00:00:00", "2021-05-19 00:00:00", "2017-05-17 00:00:00", "2017-05-16 00:00:00", "2014-03-16 00:00:00", "2018-01-01 00:00:00", "2016-03-16 00:00:00", "2017-05-16 00:00:00", "2016-05-17 00:00:00", "2016-03-16 00:00:00", "2017-05-17 18:27:00", "2015-03-16 00:00:00", "2017-01-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-06 00:00:00", "2021-03-05 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2015-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-13 00:00:00", "2021-03-12 00:00:00", "2021-03-11 00:00:00", "2021-03-10 00:00:00", "2021-03-09 00:00:00", "2021-03-07 00:00:00", "2021-03-08 00:00:00", "2021-03-07 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-06 00:00:00", "2021-03-06 00:00:00", "2021-03-05 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-01 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Pennsylvania", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "IA", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Pierce County", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "the United States", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Dallas", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Harrisburg", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Duffel", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Kansas City", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Delaware", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "NC", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "New Jersey", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Missouri", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Philadelphia", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "LL", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "5408254", "headline": "PRO/EDR> Hepatitis C - USA (11): (WI) perinatal transmission, 2011-2015", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=5408254", "date": "2017-05-23 16:01:55", "main_text": "HEPATITIS C - USA (07): INJECTION DRUG USE\n******************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n[1] Washington State\nDate: Wed 17 May 2017, 11:35 AM\nSource: The Courier Herald [edited]\nhttp://www.courierherald.com/news/hepatitis-c-infections-spike-from-opioid-epidemic-tacoma-pierce-county-health-department/\n\n\nViral hepatitis C may affect thousands of Pierce County residents.

Allowing earlier treatment was recommended 1 year ago by the department's Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee. As time passed without a decision, observers wondered whether the state was trying to determine how to pay for the highly effective but costly new drugs that have made hepatitis C a curable disease.\n\nNew hepatitis C infections tripled in 5 years, the CDC reported last week, driven largely by the opioid epidemic. The bloodborne hepatitis C virus is easily spread by sharing needles to inject heroin or crushed prescription pain pills. But the virus can grow undetected for decades before causing chronic and sometimes life-threatening liver problems. An estimated 3 million Americans are living with chronic hepatitis C, about half of them undiagnosed. The new website HepVu estimated last month that 142 000 Pennsylvania residents are living with hepatitis C antibodies and 629 died of the disease in 2014, the latest estimates available. It said 91 000 New Jersey residents had antibodies and 446 had died that year.\n\nNew drugs that can effectively cure hepatitis C with minimal side effects began coming on the market several years ago but, as they cost tens of thousands of dollars per patient, many states limited their use to those whose disease had shown up on liver tests, and added other restrictions -- barriers that exist for no other disease.\n\n\"Hopefully, what this means is I no longer have to tell patients that their liver isn't sick enough,\" said Stacey B. Trooskin, an infectious diseases physician and director of viral hepatitis programs for Philadelphia FIGHT, a nonprofit health and social services organization. Trooskin said she likely had dozens of patients who would now qualify for coverage. She said that policymakers' fears that many Medicaid recipients would get tested and seek treatment were overblown. \"In reality, it will be more like a trickle,\" she said.\n\nHepatitis C severity is categorized on a scale of F0 through F4, with F4 being the most severe. Previously, only patients with scores of F2 through F4 were eligible for treatment under Pennsylvania Medicaid unless they had other complications. Effective [1 Jul 2017], patients with scores of F1 will be covered, the state said in its announcement, and those with scores of F0 will be covered beginning [1 Jan 2018].\n\nAbout a dozen other states have loosened restrictions in the last few years, some under pressure from advocates. New Jersey eased its restrictions last year but only down to F2, which has not satisfied physicians or advocacy groups.\n\nIn his statement, Dallas thanked several organizations, including Harvard Law School's Center for Health Law and Policy Innovation, for their help \"on finding a path forward\". The center has sued or threatened to sue several states to force decisions. It reached a settlement with Delaware in 2016.\n\nKevin Costello, the center's litigation director, said that the \"overt threat of a lawsuit\" had kept the pressure on Harrisburg to approve the change. Costello said it was not likely to be nearly as costly as some have predicted. For that reason -- as well as the tendency to budget for the short term -- the possibility of future cuts to state Medicaid programs as Congress considers repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act probably was not a significant impediment to Pennsylvania's decision to drop restrictions on hepatitis C coverage, he said.\n\nThe oft-quoted prices -- USD 84 000 for a typical 12-week course of Gilead Sciences' Sovaldi, for example -- have dropped with additional competition, Costello said, and state Medicaid programs have improved their negotiating tactics and applied substantial discounts. Indeed, a Gilead spokesman said in an email late [Tue 16 May 2017] that \"the average Medicaid price per bottle is now less than USD 10 000\" -- a total of USD 30 000 for 12 weeks -- \"for states that provide open access to all patients.\"\n\nThe Obama administration sent pointed letters to state Medicaid programs about requirements to cover treatment, and challenged pharmaceutical makers to lower prices.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, about 3750 people infected with hepatitis C will likely be affected by the policy change, said Rachel Kostelac, a spokeswoman for the Department of Human Services. \"The state's annual contribution to the Medicaid program is approximately USD 12 billion. The fiscal impact of this policy change is well below one-half of 1 percent of the state's current costs,\" Kostelac said in an email response to questions.\n\n\"The real problem here,\" said Gene Bishop, a retired internist and member of the advisory committee that recommended the change on 17 May 2016, is the pharmaceutical companies, which are charging \"outrageous prices for life-saving treatment.\" Bishop made last the 2016 motion recommending that the state's Medicaid program cover treatment for all patients.

Wise says that's when it does real damage. \"I think that's why we're starting to see the trend in the opioid treatment programs because we're doing that initial screening up-front.

National Hepatitis Awareness month calls attention to the potentially deadly infection that can cause cirrhosis or liver cancer -- and how to avoid it.\n\n\"Cases of acute and chronic hepatitis C in Pierce County are on a dramatic rise, especially among young people,\" said Kim Desmarais, Tacoma-Pierce County Health Department viral hepatitis coordinator. \"Before 2013, we saw up to 5 cases a year. Now we see up to 5 cases a month.\" In response to the increase in cases, the health department works with medical providers and community partners to report, test, and manage patients with hepatitis C. The department also works to make sure these patients understand ways to stop the spread of the virus, and find treatment options for hepatitis and drug addiction. Injection drug use spreads hepatitis C.\n\nReports the Health Department receives of new hepatitis C cases are just the tip of the iceberg. Many with the infection may not know they have it. The Health Department estimates the new cases reported monthly in Pierce County represent fewer than 10 percent of the actual total. According to the CDC, as many as 3.9 million Americans have hepatitis C, but only half know they're infected. The number of people who have had hepatitis C for a long time but are just now finding out has increased because of a recommendation for doctors to routinely test people in the baby boomer generation.\n\nHeroin and other illegal injection drug use are factors in the nationwide increase of hepatitis C cases, according to the CDC. Shared drugs and syringes spread the infection. In a 2015 survey, the University of Washington Alcohol and Drug Abuse Institute asked 77 needle exchange participants in Pierce County (referenced in the Opioid Trends for Pierce County Report) which drugs they injected. The majority (74 percent) said heroin, 22 percent said methamphetamine. When the ADAI looked at survey results from 18 needle exchange programs in the state, including Pierce County, researchers found 69 percent injected heroin and 22 percent methamphetamine.\n\nHealthcare professionals can now treat and cure hepatitis C in as little as 8 weeks with very few side effects. In the past, medication was not as effective, took almost a year to work, and caused severe side effects. For these reasons, many patients decided not to take them. People with previously diagnosed hepatitis C should ask their doctor for a referral to a specialist who can evaluate them for the newer treatment.\n\nDuring May 2017, people can learn their exposure risk, the consequences if they don't get treatment and the importance of testing.

National Hepatitis Awareness month calls attention to the potentially deadly infection that can cause cirrhosis or liver cancer -- and how to avoid it.\n\n\"Cases of acute and chronic hepatitis C in Pierce County are on a dramatic rise, especially among young people,\" said Kim Desmarais, Tacoma-Pierce County Health Department viral hepatitis coordinator. \"Before 2013, we saw up to 5 cases a year. Now we see up to 5 cases a month.\" In response to the increase in cases, the health department works with medical providers and community partners to report, test, and manage patients with hepatitis C. The department also works to make sure these patients understand ways to stop the spread of the virus, and find treatment options for hepatitis and drug addiction. Injection drug use spreads hepatitis C.\n\nReports the Health Department receives of new hepatitis C cases are just the tip of the iceberg. Many with the infection may not know they have it. The Health Department estimates the new cases reported monthly in Pierce County represent fewer than 10 percent of the actual total. According to the CDC, as many as 3.9 million Americans have hepatitis C, but only half know they're infected. The number of people who have had hepatitis C for a long time but are just now finding out has increased because of a recommendation for doctors to routinely test people in the baby boomer generation.\n\nHeroin and other illegal injection drug use are factors in the nationwide increase of hepatitis C cases, according to the CDC. Shared drugs and syringes spread the infection. In a 2015 survey, the University of Washington Alcohol and Drug Abuse Institute asked 77 needle exchange participants in Pierce County (referenced in the Opioid Trends for Pierce County Report) which drugs they injected. The majority (74 percent) said heroin, 22 percent said methamphetamine. When the ADAI looked at survey results from 18 needle exchange programs in the state, including Pierce County, researchers found 69 percent injected heroin and 22 percent methamphetamine.\n\nHealthcare professionals can now treat and cure hepatitis C in as little as 8 weeks with very few side effects. In the past, medication was not as effective, took almost a year to work, and caused severe side effects. For these reasons, many patients decided not to take them. People with previously diagnosed hepatitis C should ask their doctor for a referral to a specialist who can evaluate them for the newer treatment.\n\nDuring May 2017, people can learn their exposure risk, the consequences if they don't get treatment and the importance of testing. May 19 is National Hepatitis Testing Day.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[2] Pennsylvania - interventions\nDate: Wed 17 May 2017\nSource: Governing Magazine/Tribune News Service, The Philadelphia Inquirer report [edited]\nhttp://www.governing.com/topics/health-human-services/Hepatitis-C-Patients-Will-Receive-Treatment-Through-Medicaid-in-Pa.html\n\n\nUnder pressure from advocacy organizations that had threatened a lawsuit, the Wolf administration said [Tue 16 May 2017], that it would expand Medicaid coverage for treatment of hepatitis C, a major change that many states have put off over fear of spiraling costs. \"Today's announcement means that thousands of vulnerable Pennsylvanians will soon have easier access to pharmaceuticals that can cure hepatitis C,\" Department of Human Services Secretary Ted Dallas said in a statement.\n\nUntil now, state policy had been to wait until patients showed signs of liver damage before approving treatment. Allowing earlier treatment was recommended 1 year ago by the department's Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee. As time passed without a decision, observers wondered whether the state was trying to determine how to pay for the highly effective but costly new drugs that have made hepatitis C a curable disease.\n\nNew hepatitis C infections tripled in 5 years, the CDC reported last week, driven largely by the opioid epidemic. The bloodborne hepatitis C virus is easily spread by sharing needles to inject heroin or crushed prescription pain pills. But the virus can grow undetected for decades before causing chronic and sometimes life-threatening liver problems. An estimated 3 million Americans are living with chronic hepatitis C, about half of them undiagnosed. The new website HepVu estimated last month that 142 000 Pennsylvania residents are living with hepatitis C antibodies and 629 died of the disease in 2014, the latest estimates available. It said 91 000 New Jersey residents had antibodies and 446 had died that year.\n\nNew drugs that can effectively cure hepatitis C with minimal side effects began coming on the market several years ago but, as they cost tens of thousands of dollars per patient, many states limited their use to those whose disease had shown up on liver tests, and added other restrictions -- barriers that exist for no other disease.\n\n\"Hopefully, what this means is I no longer have to tell patients that their liver isn't sick enough,\" said Stacey B. Trooskin, an infectious diseases physician and director of viral hepatitis programs for Philadelphia FIGHT, a nonprofit health and social services organization. Trooskin said she likely had dozens of patients who would now qualify for coverage. She said that policymakers' fears that many Medicaid recipients would get tested and seek treatment were overblown. \"In reality, it will be more like a trickle,\" she said.\n\nHepatitis C severity is categorized on a scale of F0 through F4, with F4 being the most severe. Previously, only patients with scores of F2 through F4 were eligible for treatment under Pennsylvania Medicaid unless they had other complications. Effective [1 Jul 2017], patients with scores of F1 will be covered, the state said in its announcement, and those with scores of F0 will be covered beginning [1 Jan 2018].\n\nAbout a dozen other states have loosened restrictions in the last few years, some under pressure from advocates. New Jersey eased its restrictions last year but only down to F2, which has not satisfied physicians or advocacy groups.\n\nIn his statement, Dallas thanked several organizations, including Harvard Law School's Center for Health Law and Policy Innovation, for their help \"on finding a path forward\". The center has sued or threatened to sue several states to force decisions. It reached a settlement with Delaware in 2016.\n\nKevin Costello, the center's litigation director, said that the \"overt threat of a lawsuit\" had kept the pressure on Harrisburg to approve the change. Costello said it was not likely to be nearly as costly as some have predicted. For that reason -- as well as the tendency to budget for the short term -- the possibility of future cuts to state Medicaid programs as Congress considers repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act probably was not a significant impediment to Pennsylvania's decision to drop restrictions on hepatitis C coverage, he said.\n\nThe oft-quoted prices -- USD 84 000 for a typical 12-week course of Gilead Sciences' Sovaldi, for example -- have dropped with additional competition, Costello said, and state Medicaid programs have improved their negotiating tactics and applied substantial discounts. Indeed, a Gilead spokesman said in an email late [Tue 16 May 2017] that \"the average Medicaid price per bottle is now less than USD 10 000\" -- a total of USD 30 000 for 12 weeks -- \"for states that provide open access to all patients.\"\n\nThe Obama administration sent pointed letters to state Medicaid programs about requirements to cover treatment, and challenged pharmaceutical makers to lower prices.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, about 3750 people infected with hepatitis C will likely be affected by the policy change, said Rachel Kostelac, a spokeswoman for the Department of Human Services. \"The state's annual contribution to the Medicaid program is approximately USD 12 billion. The fiscal impact of this policy change is well below one-half of 1 percent of the state's current costs,\" Kostelac said in an email response to questions.\n\n\"The real problem here,\" said Gene Bishop, a retired internist and member of the advisory committee that recommended the change on 17 May 2016, is the pharmaceutical companies, which are charging \"outrageous prices for life-saving treatment.\" Bishop made last the 2016 motion recommending that the state's Medicaid program cover treatment for all patients. It was supported by every practitioner on the committee and opposed by every member on the payer side, she recalled, adding that she had not expected the motion to prevail.\n\n[Byline: Don Sapatkin]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[3] Missouri\nDate: Wed 17 May 2017, 6:27 PM\nSource: KSHB [edited]\nhttp://www.kshb.com/news/local-news/hepatitis-c-rising-in-kansas-city-with-opioid-epidemic-rediscover-says\n\n\nThe opioid epidemic in the United States is bringing about another serious problem: Hepatitis C. New data from the CDC shows new Hep C infections almost tripled in 5 years. New infections rose from 850 in 2010 to 2436 in 2015. It's taking a toll in the Kansas City metro, where ReDiscover says 1 in 5 people who walk into its opioid treatment clinic will be diagnosed with Hep C.\n\nOne woman calls herself an old drug addict but is now using her story to help educate others. \"I remember the exact night I got Hep C,\" Duffel said. Her drug addiction was so powerful she picked up a heroin needle her infected husband had just used. \"The next minute I'm looking at the syringe thinking, I want that so bad, and I know if I use his needle, it was the only one, I would get Hep C,\" she said. \"I remember as I was pushing it in my arm I'm going, I'm sick. I'm going to be really sick. And I was.\" She is one of millions of Americans who have Hepatitis C, a disease that destroys the liver.\n\nThe face of this disease is getting younger and younger. Sarita Wise, a nurse at ReDiscover's drug treatment clinic, says the opioid epidemic is to blame. Since January 2017, out of 22 new clients at the clinic, 16 tested positive for Hep C. The CDC says the highest rates of Hep C are among young people who inject drugs, and the same group accounts for 75 percent of new Hep C cases a year.\n\nThe disease is highly contagious. \"Dried blood, equipment used for making drugs, whether it's snorting it or with straws, tourniquets, cotton balls. If they're not aware there are even small amounts of blood on it, they can infect themselves that way,\" Wise said.\n\nMany of the patients that go to drug treatment clinics may be low-income and don't go to a primary care physician regularly, so the disease goes undetected. Wise says that's when it does real damage. \"I think that's why we're starting to see the trend in the opioid treatment programs because we're doing that initial screening up-front. That's also to educate them about why they should continue to come to our programs, so they won't engage in risky behaviors,\" Wise said.\n\nReDiscover says while it is good news that young people are being diagnosed early on, many people, like this woman, can't afford the Hep C drug treatments. They can cost tens of thousands of dollars, but can also cure the disease. ReDiscover has to rely heavily on federal grants that can help people get access.\n\n[Byline: Sarah Plake]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Most cases of acute hepatitis C are not recognized or reported because they are asymptomatic or anicteric (without jaundice) so the case numbers are likely underreported.\n\nIn the absence of a vaccine for hepatitis C (as are available for hepatitis A and B), infection avoidance techniques such as needle exchange programs and the need for aggressive available programs in counseling, not criminalizing, substance addiction are vitally needed.

Allowing earlier treatment was recommended 1 year ago by the department's Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee. As time passed without a decision, observers wondered whether the state was trying to determine how to pay for the highly effective but costly new drugs that have made hepatitis C a curable disease.\n\nNew hepatitis C infections tripled in 5 years, the CDC reported last week, driven largely by the opioid epidemic. The bloodborne hepatitis C virus is easily spread by sharing needles to inject heroin or crushed prescription pain pills. But the virus can grow undetected for decades before causing chronic and sometimes life-threatening liver problems. An estimated 3 million Americans are living with chronic hepatitis C, about half of them undiagnosed. The new website HepVu estimated last month that 142 000 Pennsylvania residents are living with hepatitis C antibodies and 629 died of the disease in 2014, the latest estimates available. It said 91 000 New Jersey residents had antibodies and 446 had died that year.\n\nNew drugs that can effectively cure hepatitis C with minimal side effects began coming on the market several years ago but, as they cost tens of thousands of dollars per patient, many states limited their use to those whose disease had shown up on liver tests, and added other restrictions -- barriers that exist for no other disease.\n\n\"Hopefully, what this means is I no longer have to tell patients that their liver isn't sick enough,\" said Stacey B. Trooskin, an infectious diseases physician and director of viral hepatitis programs for Philadelphia FIGHT, a nonprofit health and social services organization. Trooskin said she likely had dozens of patients who would now qualify for coverage. She said that policymakers' fears that many Medicaid recipients would get tested and seek treatment were overblown. \"In reality, it will be more like a trickle,\" she said.\n\nHepatitis C severity is categorized on a scale of F0 through F4, with F4 being the most severe. Previously, only patients with scores of F2 through F4 were eligible for treatment under Pennsylvania Medicaid unless they had other complications. Effective [1 Jul 2017], patients with scores of F1 will be covered, the state said in its announcement, and those with scores of F0 will be covered beginning [1 Jan 2018].\n\nAbout a dozen other states have loosened restrictions in the last few years, some under pressure from advocates. New Jersey eased its restrictions last year but only down to F2, which has not satisfied physicians or advocacy groups.\n\nIn his statement, Dallas thanked several organizations, including Harvard Law School's Center for Health Law and Policy Innovation, for their help \"on finding a path forward\". The center has sued or threatened to sue several states to force decisions. It reached a settlement with Delaware in 2016.\n\nKevin Costello, the center's litigation director, said that the \"overt threat of a lawsuit\" had kept the pressure on Harrisburg to approve the change. Costello said it was not likely to be nearly as costly as some have predicted. For that reason -- as well as the tendency to budget for the short term -- the possibility of future cuts to state Medicaid programs as Congress considers repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act probably was not a significant impediment to Pennsylvania's decision to drop restrictions on hepatitis C coverage, he said.\n\nThe oft-quoted prices -- USD 84 000 for a typical 12-week course of Gilead Sciences' Sovaldi, for example -- have dropped with additional competition, Costello said, and state Medicaid programs have improved their negotiating tactics and applied substantial discounts. Indeed, a Gilead spokesman said in an email late [Tue 16 May 2017] that \"the average Medicaid price per bottle is now less than USD 10 000\" -- a total of USD 30 000 for 12 weeks -- \"for states that provide open access to all patients.\"\n\nThe Obama administration sent pointed letters to state Medicaid programs about requirements to cover treatment, and challenged pharmaceutical makers to lower prices.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, about 3750 people infected with hepatitis C will likely be affected by the policy change, said Rachel Kostelac, a spokeswoman for the Department of Human Services. \"The state's annual contribution to the Medicaid program is approximately USD 12 billion. The fiscal impact of this policy change is well below one-half of 1 percent of the state's current costs,\" Kostelac said in an email response to questions.\n\n\"The real problem here,\" said Gene Bishop, a retired internist and member of the advisory committee that recommended the change on 17 May 2016, is the pharmaceutical companies, which are charging \"outrageous prices for life-saving treatment.\" Bishop made last the 2016 motion recommending that the state's Medicaid program cover treatment for all patients.

National Hepatitis Awareness month calls attention to the potentially deadly infection that can cause cirrhosis or liver cancer -- and how to avoid it.\n\n\"Cases of acute and chronic hepatitis C in Pierce County are on a dramatic rise, especially among young people,\" said Kim Desmarais, Tacoma-Pierce County Health Department viral hepatitis coordinator. \"Before 2013, we saw up to 5 cases a year. Now we see up to 5 cases a month.\" In response to the increase in cases, the health department works with medical providers and community partners to report, test, and manage patients with hepatitis C. The department also works to make sure these patients understand ways to stop the spread of the virus, and find treatment options for hepatitis and drug addiction. Injection drug use spreads hepatitis C.\n\nReports the Health Department receives of new hepatitis C cases are just the tip of the iceberg. Many with the infection may not know they have it. The Health Department estimates the new cases reported monthly in Pierce County represent fewer than 10 percent of the actual total. According to the CDC, as many as 3.9 million Americans have hepatitis C, but only half know they're infected. The number of people who have had hepatitis C for a long time but are just now finding out has increased because of a recommendation for doctors to routinely test people in the baby boomer generation.\n\nHeroin and other illegal injection drug use are factors in the nationwide increase of hepatitis C cases, according to the CDC. Shared drugs and syringes spread the infection. In a 2015 survey, the University of Washington Alcohol and Drug Abuse Institute asked 77 needle exchange participants in Pierce County (referenced in the Opioid Trends for Pierce County Report) which drugs they injected. The majority (74 percent) said heroin, 22 percent said methamphetamine. When the ADAI looked at survey results from 18 needle exchange programs in the state, including Pierce County, researchers found 69 percent injected heroin and 22 percent methamphetamine.\n\nHealthcare professionals can now treat and cure hepatitis C in as little as 8 weeks with very few side effects.

National Hepatitis Awareness month calls attention to the potentially deadly infection that can cause cirrhosis or liver cancer -- and how to avoid it.\n\n\"Cases of acute and chronic hepatitis C in Pierce County are on a dramatic rise, especially among young people,\" said Kim Desmarais, Tacoma-Pierce County Health Department viral hepatitis coordinator. \"Before 2013, we saw up to 5 cases a year. Now we see up to 5 cases a month.\" In response to the increase in cases, the health department works with medical providers and community partners to report, test, and manage patients with hepatitis C. The department also works to make sure these patients understand ways to stop the spread of the virus, and find treatment options for hepatitis and drug addiction. Injection drug use spreads hepatitis C.\n\nReports the Health Department receives of new hepatitis C cases are just the tip of the iceberg. Many with the infection may not know they have it. The Health Department estimates the new cases reported monthly in Pierce County represent fewer than 10 percent of the actual total. According to the CDC, as many as 3.9 million Americans have hepatitis C, but only half know they're infected. The number of people who have had hepatitis C for a long time but are just now finding out has increased because of a recommendation for doctors to routinely test people in the baby boomer generation.\n\nHeroin and other illegal injection drug use are factors in the nationwide increase of hepatitis C cases, according to the CDC. Shared drugs and syringes spread the infection. In a 2015 survey, the University of Washington Alcohol and Drug Abuse Institute asked 77 needle exchange participants in Pierce County (referenced in the Opioid Trends for Pierce County Report) which drugs they injected. The majority (74 percent) said heroin, 22 percent said methamphetamine. When the ADAI looked at survey results from 18 needle exchange programs in the state, including Pierce County, researchers found 69 percent injected heroin and 22 percent methamphetamine.\n\nHealthcare professionals can now treat and cure hepatitis C in as little as 8 weeks with very few side effects. In the past, medication was not as effective, took almost a year to work, and caused severe side effects. For these reasons, many patients decided not to take them. People with previously diagnosed hepatitis C should ask their doctor for a referral to a specialist who can evaluate them for the newer treatment.\n\nDuring May 2017, people can learn their exposure risk, the consequences if they don't get treatment and the importance of testing. May 19 is National Hepatitis Testing Day.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[2] Pennsylvania - interventions\nDate: Wed 17 May 2017\nSource: Governing Magazine/Tribune News Service, The Philadelphia Inquirer report [edited]\nhttp://www.governing.com/topics/health-human-services/Hepatitis-C-Patients-Will-Receive-Treatment-Through-Medicaid-in-Pa.html\n\n\nUnder pressure from advocacy organizations that had threatened a lawsuit, the Wolf administration said [Tue 16 May 2017], that it would expand Medicaid coverage for treatment of hepatitis C, a major change that many states have put off over fear of spiraling costs. \"Today's announcement means that thousands of vulnerable Pennsylvanians will soon have easier access to pharmaceuticals that can cure hepatitis C,\" Department of Human Services Secretary Ted Dallas said in a statement.\n\nUntil now, state policy had been to wait until patients showed signs of liver damage before approving treatment. Allowing earlier treatment was recommended 1 year ago by the department's Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee. As time passed without a decision, observers wondered whether the state was trying to determine how to pay for the highly effective but costly new drugs that have made hepatitis C a curable disease.\n\nNew hepatitis C infections tripled in 5 years, the CDC reported last week, driven largely by the opioid epidemic. The bloodborne hepatitis C virus is easily spread by sharing needles to inject heroin or crushed prescription pain pills. But the virus can grow undetected for decades before causing chronic and sometimes life-threatening liver problems. An estimated 3 million Americans are living with chronic hepatitis C, about half of them undiagnosed. The new website HepVu estimated last month that 142 000 Pennsylvania residents are living with hepatitis C antibodies and 629 died of the disease in 2014, the latest estimates available. It said 91 000 New Jersey residents had antibodies and 446 had died that year.\n\nNew drugs that can effectively cure hepatitis C with minimal side effects began coming on the market several years ago but, as they cost tens of thousands of dollars per patient, many states limited their use to those whose disease had shown up on liver tests, and added other restrictions -- barriers that exist for no other disease.\n\n\"Hopefully, what this means is I no longer have to tell patients that their liver isn't sick enough,\" said Stacey B. Trooskin, an infectious diseases physician and director of viral hepatitis programs for Philadelphia FIGHT, a nonprofit health and social services organization. Trooskin said she likely had dozens of patients who would now qualify for coverage. She said that policymakers' fears that many Medicaid recipients would get tested and seek treatment were overblown. \"In reality, it will be more like a trickle,\" she said.\n\nHepatitis C severity is categorized on a scale of F0 through F4, with F4 being the most severe. Previously, only patients with scores of F2 through F4 were eligible for treatment under Pennsylvania Medicaid unless they had other complications. Effective [1 Jul 2017], patients with scores of F1 will be covered, the state said in its announcement, and those with scores of F0 will be covered beginning [1 Jan 2018].\n\nAbout a dozen other states have loosened restrictions in the last few years, some under pressure from advocates. New Jersey eased its restrictions last year but only down to F2, which has not satisfied physicians or advocacy groups.\n\nIn his statement, Dallas thanked several organizations, including Harvard Law School's Center for Health Law and Policy Innovation, for their help \"on finding a path forward\". The center has sued or threatened to sue several states to force decisions. It reached a settlement with Delaware in 2016.\n\nKevin Costello, the center's litigation director, said that the \"overt threat of a lawsuit\" had kept the pressure on Harrisburg to approve the change. Costello said it was not likely to be nearly as costly as some have predicted. For that reason -- as well as the tendency to budget for the short term -- the possibility of future cuts to state Medicaid programs as Congress considers repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act probably was not a significant impediment to Pennsylvania's decision to drop restrictions on hepatitis C coverage, he said.\n\nThe oft-quoted prices -- USD 84 000 for a typical 12-week course of Gilead Sciences' Sovaldi, for example -- have dropped with additional competition, Costello said, and state Medicaid programs have improved their negotiating tactics and applied substantial discounts. Indeed, a Gilead spokesman said in an email late [Tue 16 May 2017] that \"the average Medicaid price per bottle is now less than USD 10 000\" -- a total of USD 30 000 for 12 weeks -- \"for states that provide open access to all patients.\"\n\nThe Obama administration sent pointed letters to state Medicaid programs about requirements to cover treatment, and challenged pharmaceutical makers to lower prices.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, about 3750 people infected with hepatitis C will likely be affected by the policy change, said Rachel Kostelac, a spokeswoman for the Department of Human Services. \"The state's annual contribution to the Medicaid program is approximately USD 12 billion. The fiscal impact of this policy change is well below one-half of 1 percent of the state's current costs,\" Kostelac said in an email response to questions.\n\n\"The real problem here,\" said Gene Bishop, a retired internist and member of the advisory committee that recommended the change on 17 May 2016, is the pharmaceutical companies, which are charging \"outrageous prices for life-saving treatment.\" Bishop made last the 2016 motion recommending that the state's Medicaid program cover treatment for all patients. It was supported by every practitioner on the committee and opposed by every member on the payer side, she recalled, adding that she had not expected the motion to prevail.\n\n[Byline: Don Sapatkin]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[3] Missouri\nDate: Wed 17 May 2017, 6:27 PM\nSource: KSHB [edited]\nhttp://www.kshb.com/news/local-news/hepatitis-c-rising-in-kansas-city-with-opioid-epidemic-rediscover-says\n\n\nThe opioid epidemic in the United States is bringing about another serious problem: Hepatitis C. New data from the CDC shows new Hep C infections almost tripled in 5 years. New infections rose from 850 in 2010 to 2436 in 2015. It's taking a toll in the Kansas City metro, where ReDiscover says 1 in 5 people who walk into its opioid treatment clinic will be diagnosed with Hep C.\n\nOne woman calls herself an old drug addict but is now using her story to help educate others. \"I remember the exact night I got Hep C,\" Duffel said. Her drug addiction was so powerful she picked up a heroin needle her infected husband had just used. \"The next minute I'm looking at the syringe thinking, I want that so bad, and I know if I use his needle, it was the only one, I would get Hep C,\" she said. \"I remember as I was pushing it in my arm I'm going, I'm sick. I'm going to be really sick. And I was.\" She is one of millions of Americans who have Hepatitis C, a disease that destroys the liver.\n\nThe face of this disease is getting younger and younger. Sarita Wise, a nurse at ReDiscover's drug treatment clinic, says the opioid epidemic is to blame. Since January 2017, out of 22 new clients at the clinic, 16 tested positive for Hep C. The CDC says the highest rates of Hep C are among young people who inject drugs, and the same group accounts for 75 percent of new Hep C cases a year.\n\nThe disease is highly contagious. \"Dried blood, equipment used for making drugs, whether it's snorting it or with straws, tourniquets, cotton balls. If they're not aware there are even small amounts of blood on it, they can infect themselves that way,\" Wise said.\n\nMany of the patients that go to drug treatment clinics may be low-income and don't go to a primary care physician regularly, so the disease goes undetected. Wise says that's when it does real damage. \"I think that's why we're starting to see the trend in the opioid treatment programs because we're doing that initial screening up-front. That's also to educate them about why they should continue to come to our programs, so they won't engage in risky behaviors,\" Wise said.\n\nReDiscover says while it is good news that young people are being diagnosed early on, many people, like this woman, can't afford the Hep C drug treatments. They can cost tens of thousands of dollars, but can also cure the disease. ReDiscover has to rely heavily on federal grants that can help people get access.\n\n[Byline: Sarah Plake]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Most cases of acute hepatitis C are not recognized or reported because they are asymptomatic or anicteric (without jaundice) so the case numbers are likely underreported.\n\nIn the absence of a vaccine for hepatitis C (as are available for hepatitis A and B), infection avoidance techniques such as needle exchange programs and the need for aggressive available programs in counseling, not criminalizing, substance addiction are vitally needed.

When the ADAI looked at survey results from 18 needle exchange programs in the state, including Pierce County, researchers found 69 percent injected heroin and 22 percent methamphetamine.\n\nHealthcare professionals can now treat and cure hepatitis C in as little as 8 weeks with very few side effects. In the past, medication was not as effective, took almost a year to work, and caused severe side effects. For these reasons, many patients decided not to take them. People with previously diagnosed hepatitis C should ask their doctor for a referral to a specialist who can evaluate them for the newer treatment.\n\nDuring May 2017, people can learn their exposure risk, the consequences if they don't get treatment and the importance of testing. May 19 is National Hepatitis Testing Day.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[2] Pennsylvania - interventions\nDate: Wed 17 May 2017\nSource: Governing Magazine/Tribune News Service, The Philadelphia Inquirer report [edited]\nhttp://www.governing.com/topics/health-human-services/Hepatitis-C-Patients-Will-Receive-Treatment-Through-Medicaid-in-Pa.html\n\n\nUnder pressure from advocacy organizations that had threatened a lawsuit, the Wolf administration said [Tue 16 May 2017], that it would expand Medicaid coverage for treatment of hepatitis C, a major change that many states have put off over fear of spiraling costs. \"Today's announcement means that thousands of vulnerable Pennsylvanians will soon have easier access to pharmaceuticals that can cure hepatitis C,\" Department of Human Services Secretary Ted Dallas said in a statement.\n\nUntil now, state policy had been to wait until patients showed signs of liver damage before approving treatment. Allowing earlier treatment was recommended 1 year ago by the department's Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee. As time passed without a decision, observers wondered whether the state was trying to determine how to pay for the highly effective but costly new drugs that have made hepatitis C a curable disease.\n\nNew hepatitis C infections tripled in 5 years, the CDC reported last week, driven largely by the opioid epidemic. The bloodborne hepatitis C virus is easily spread by sharing needles to inject heroin or crushed prescription pain pills. But the virus can grow undetected for decades before causing chronic and sometimes life-threatening liver problems. An estimated 3 million Americans are living with chronic hepatitis C, about half of them undiagnosed. The new website HepVu estimated last month that 142 000 Pennsylvania residents are living with hepatitis C antibodies and 629 died of the disease in 2014, the latest estimates available. It said 91 000 New Jersey residents had antibodies and 446 had died that year.\n\nNew drugs that can effectively cure hepatitis C with minimal side effects began coming on the market several years ago but, as they cost tens of thousands of dollars per patient, many states limited their use to those whose disease had shown up on liver tests, and added other restrictions -- barriers that exist for no other disease.\n\n\"Hopefully, what this means is I no longer have to tell patients that their liver isn't sick enough,\" said Stacey B. Trooskin, an infectious diseases physician and director of viral hepatitis programs for Philadelphia FIGHT, a nonprofit health and social services organization. Trooskin said she likely had dozens of patients who would now qualify for coverage. She said that policymakers' fears that many Medicaid recipients would get tested and seek treatment were overblown. \"In reality, it will be more like a trickle,\" she said.\n\nHepatitis C severity is categorized on a scale of F0 through F4, with F4 being the most severe. Previously, only patients with scores of F2 through F4 were eligible for treatment under Pennsylvania Medicaid unless they had other complications. Effective [1 Jul 2017], patients with scores of F1 will be covered, the state said in its announcement, and those with scores of F0 will be covered beginning [1 Jan 2018].\n\nAbout a dozen other states have loosened restrictions in the last few years, some under pressure from advocates. New Jersey eased its restrictions last year but only down to F2, which has not satisfied physicians or advocacy groups.\n\nIn his statement, Dallas thanked several organizations, including Harvard Law School's Center for Health Law and Policy Innovation, for their help \"on finding a path forward\". The center has sued or threatened to sue several states to force decisions. It reached a settlement with Delaware in 2016.\n\nKevin Costello, the center's litigation director, said that the \"overt threat of a lawsuit\" had kept the pressure on Harrisburg to approve the change. Costello said it was not likely to be nearly as costly as some have predicted. For that reason -- as well as the tendency to budget for the short term -- the possibility of future cuts to state Medicaid programs as Congress considers repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act probably was not a significant impediment to Pennsylvania's decision to drop restrictions on hepatitis C coverage, he said.\n\nThe oft-quoted prices -- USD 84 000 for a typical 12-week course of Gilead Sciences' Sovaldi, for example -- have dropped with additional competition, Costello said, and state Medicaid programs have improved their negotiating tactics and applied substantial discounts. Indeed, a Gilead spokesman said in an email late [Tue 16 May 2017] that \"the average Medicaid price per bottle is now less than USD 10 000\" -- a total of USD 30 000 for 12 weeks -- \"for states that provide open access to all patients.\"\n\nThe Obama administration sent pointed letters to state Medicaid programs about requirements to cover treatment, and challenged pharmaceutical makers to lower prices.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, about 3750 people infected with hepatitis C will likely be affected by the policy change, said Rachel Kostelac, a spokeswoman for the Department of Human Services. \"The state's annual contribution to the Medicaid program is approximately USD 12 billion. The fiscal impact of this policy change is well below one-half of 1 percent of the state's current costs,\" Kostelac said in an email response to questions.\n\n\"The real problem here,\" said Gene Bishop, a retired internist and member of the advisory committee that recommended the change on 17 May 2016, is the pharmaceutical companies, which are charging \"outrageous prices for life-saving treatment.\" Bishop made last the 2016 motion recommending that the state's Medicaid program cover treatment for all patients. It was supported by every practitioner on the committee and opposed by every member on the payer side, she recalled, adding that she had not expected the motion to prevail.\n\n[Byline: Don Sapatkin]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[3] Missouri\nDate: Wed 17 May 2017, 6:27 PM\nSource: KSHB [edited]\nhttp://www.kshb.com/news/local-news/hepatitis-c-rising-in-kansas-city-with-opioid-epidemic-rediscover-says\n\n\nThe opioid epidemic in the United States is bringing about another serious problem: Hepatitis C. New data from the CDC shows new Hep C infections almost tripled in 5 years. New infections rose from 850 in 2010 to 2436 in 2015. It's taking a toll in the Kansas City metro, where ReDiscover says 1 in 5 people who walk into its opioid treatment clinic will be diagnosed with Hep C.\n\nOne woman calls herself an old drug addict but is now using her story to help educate others. \"I remember the exact night I got Hep C,\" Duffel said. Her drug addiction was so powerful she picked up a heroin needle her infected husband had just used. \"The next minute I'm looking at the syringe thinking, I want that so bad, and I know if I use his needle, it was the only one, I would get Hep C,\" she said. \"I remember as I was pushing it in my arm I'm going, I'm sick. I'm going to be really sick. And I was.\" She is one of millions of Americans who have Hepatitis C, a disease that destroys the liver.\n\nThe face of this disease is getting younger and younger. Sarita Wise, a nurse at ReDiscover's drug treatment clinic, says the opioid epidemic is to blame. Since January 2017, out of 22 new clients at the clinic, 16 tested positive for Hep C. The CDC says the highest rates of Hep C are among young people who inject drugs, and the same group accounts for 75 percent of new Hep C cases a year.\n\nThe disease is highly contagious. \"Dried blood, equipment used for making drugs, whether it's snorting it or with straws, tourniquets, cotton balls. If they're not aware there are even small amounts of blood on it, they can infect themselves that way,\" Wise said.\n\nMany of the patients that go to drug treatment clinics may be low-income and don't go to a primary care physician regularly, so the disease goes undetected. Wise says that's when it does real damage. \"I think that's why we're starting to see the trend in the opioid treatment programs because we're doing that initial screening up-front. That's also to educate them about why they should continue to come to our programs, so they won't engage in risky behaviors,\" Wise said.\n\nReDiscover says while it is good news that young people are being diagnosed early on, many people, like this woman, can't afford the Hep C drug treatments. They can cost tens of thousands of dollars, but can also cure the disease. ReDiscover has to rely heavily on federal grants that can help people get access.\n\n[Byline: Sarah Plake]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Most cases of acute hepatitis C are not recognized or reported because they are asymptomatic or anicteric (without jaundice) so the case numbers are likely underreported.\n\nIn the absence of a vaccine for hepatitis C (as are available for hepatitis A and B), infection avoidance techniques such as needle exchange programs and the need for aggressive available programs in counseling, not criminalizing, substance addiction are vitally needed. There is no evidence that government sponsored needle exchange programs increase the amount of substance abuse. - Mod.LL\n\nAn additional (public health) benefit of treatment is that patients who are cured no longer transmit hepatitis C.

The WHO Global hepatitis report, 2017 indicates that the large majority of these people lack access to life-saving testing and treatment. As a result, millions of people are at risk of a slow progression to chronic liver disease, cancer, and death.\n\n\"Viral hepatitis is now recognized as a major public health challenge that requires an urgent response,\" said Dr Margaret Chan, WHO Director-General. \"Vaccines and medicines to tackle hepatitis exist, and WHO is committed to helping ensure these tools reach all those who need them.\"\n\nIncreasing mortality, new infections\n-----------------------------------------------\nViral hepatitis caused 1.34 million deaths in 2015, a number comparable to deaths caused by tuberculosis and HIV. But while mortality from tuberculosis and HIV has been declining, deaths from hepatitis are on the increase.\n\nApproximately 1.75 million people were newly infected with HCV in 2015, bringing the global total of people living with hepatitis C to 71 million.\nAlthough overall deaths from hepatitis are increasing, new infections of HBV are falling, thanks to increased coverage of HBV vaccination among children. Globally, 84 percent of children born in 2015 received the 3 recommended doses of hepatitis B vaccine. Between the pre-vaccine era (which, according to the year of introduction can range from the 1980s to the early 2000s) and 2015, the proportion of children under 5 years of age with new infections fell from 4.7 percent to 1.3 percent. However, an estimated 257 million people, mostly adults born before the introduction of the HBV vaccine, were living with chronic hepatitis B infection in 2015.\n\nHepatitis B levels vary widely across WHO regions with the WHO African Region and WHO Western Pacific Region sharing the greatest burden.\n\n- WHO Western Pacific Region: 6.2 percent of population (115 million people)\n- WHO African Region: 6.1 percent of population (60 million people)\n- WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region: 3.3 percent of population (21 million people)\n- WHO South-East Asia Region: 2 percent of population (39 million people)\n- WHO European Region: 1.6 percent of population (15 million people)\n- WHO Region of the Americas: 0.7 percent of population (7 million people)\n\nToday, unsafe injections in health care settings and injecting drug use are considered to be the most common routes of HCV transmissions. HCV prevalence by WHO region is:\n- WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region: 2.3 percent of population (15 million people)\n- WHO European Region: 1.5 percent of population (14 million people)\n- WHO African Region: 1 percent of population (11 million people)\n- WHO Region of the Americas: 1 percent of population (7 million people)\n- WHO Western Pacific Region: 1 percent of population (14 million people)\n- WHO South-East Asia Region: 0.5 percent of population (10 million people)\n\nThere is currently no vaccine against HCV, and access to treatment for HBV and HCV is still low.\n\nWHO's Global Health Sector Strategy on viral hepatitis aims to test 90 percent and treat 80 percent of people with HBV and HCV by 2030. The report notes that just 9 percent of all HBV infections and 20 percent of all HCV infections were diagnosed in 2015. An even smaller fraction - 8 percent of those diagnosed with HBV infection (1.7 million people) were on treatment, and only 7 percent of those diagnosed with HCV infection (1.1 million people) had started curative treatment during that year [2015].\n\nHBV infection requires lifelong treatment, and WHO currently recommends the medicine tenofovir, already widely used in HIV treatment. Hepatitis C can be cured within a relatively short time using the highly effective direct-acting antivirals (DAAs).\n\n\"We are still at an early stage of the viral hepatitis response, but the way forward looks promising,\" said Dr Gottfried Hirnschall, Director of WHO's Department of HIV and the Global Hepatitis Programme. \"More countries are making hepatitis services available for people in need - a diagnostic test costs less than USD 1 and the cure for hepatitis C can be below USD 200. But the data clearly highlight the urgency with which we must address the remaining gaps in testing and treatment.\"\n\nWHO's Global hepatitis report, 2017 demonstrates that despite challenges, some countries are taking successful steps to scale-up hepatitis services. China achieved high coverage (96 percent) for the timely birth dose of HBV vaccines, and reached the hepatitis B control goal of less than 1 percent prevalence in children under the age of 5 in 2015. Mongolia improved uptake of hepatitis treatment by including HBV and HCV medicines in its National Health Insurance scheme, which covers 98 percent of its population. In Egypt, generic competition has reduced the price of a 3-month cure for hepatitis C, from USD 900 in 2015, to less than USD 200 in 2016. Today in Pakistan, the same course costs as little as USD 100.\n\nImproving access to hepatitis C cure received a boost at the end of March 2017, when WHO prequalified the generic active pharmaceutical ingredient of sofosbuvir. This step will enable more countries to produce affordable hepatitis medicines.\n\nWHO's Global hepatitis report, 2017 aims to provide a starting point for hepatitis elimination by indicating baseline statistics on HBV and HCV infections, including mortality, and coverage levels of key interventions. Hepatitis B and C - the 2 main types out of 5 different hepatitis infections - are responsible for 96 percent of overall hepatitis mortality.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The full report can be found at:\nhttp://www.who.int/hepatitis/publications/global-hepatitis-report2017/en/.\n\nBoth HBV and HCV remain significant cause of chronic liver disease manifest by cirrhosis of the liver and hepatocellular carcinoma. Preventing these relates to prevention of primary infection (the HBV vaccine and strong efforts by minimize transmission by safe sexual practices and prevention of injection-associated transmission) and treatment (which is most useful at this point in HCV). -

The WHO Global hepatitis report, 2017 indicates that the large majority of these people lack access to life-saving testing and treatment. As a result, millions of people are at risk of a slow progression to chronic liver disease, cancer, and death.\n\n\"Viral hepatitis is now recognized as a major public health challenge that requires an urgent response,\" said Dr Margaret Chan, WHO Director-General. \"Vaccines and medicines to tackle hepatitis exist, and WHO is committed to helping ensure these tools reach all those who need them.\"\n\nIncreasing mortality, new infections\n-----------------------------------------------\nViral hepatitis caused 1.34 million deaths in 2015, a number comparable to deaths caused by tuberculosis and HIV. But while mortality from tuberculosis and HIV has been declining, deaths from hepatitis are on the increase.\n\nApproximately 1.75 million people were newly infected with HCV in 2015, bringing the global total of people living with hepatitis C to 71 million.\nAlthough overall deaths from hepatitis are increasing, new infections of HBV are falling, thanks to increased coverage of HBV vaccination among children. Globally, 84 percent of children born in 2015 received the 3 recommended doses of hepatitis B vaccine. Between the pre-vaccine era (which, according to the year of introduction can range from the 1980s to the early 2000s) and 2015, the proportion of children under 5 years of age with new infections fell from 4.7 percent to 1.3 percent. However, an estimated 257 million people, mostly adults born before the introduction of the HBV vaccine, were living with chronic hepatitis B infection in 2015.\n\nHepatitis B levels vary widely across WHO regions with the WHO African Region and WHO Western Pacific Region sharing the greatest burden.\n\n- WHO Western Pacific Region: 6.2 percent of population (115 million people)\n- WHO African Region: 6.1 percent of population (60 million people)\n- WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region: 3.3 percent of population (21 million people)\n- WHO South-East Asia Region: 2 percent of population (39 million people)\n- WHO European Region: 1.6 percent of population (15 million people)\n- WHO Region of the Americas: 0.7 percent of population (7 million people)\n\nToday, unsafe injections in health care settings and injecting drug use are considered to be the most common routes of HCV transmissions. HCV prevalence by WHO region is:\n- WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region: 2.3 percent of population (15 million people)\n- WHO European Region: 1.5 percent of population (14 million people)\n- WHO African Region: 1 percent of population (11 million people)\n- WHO Region of the Americas: 1 percent of population (7 million people)\n- WHO Western Pacific Region: 1 percent of population (14 million people)\n- WHO South-East Asia Region: 0.5 percent of population (10 million people)\n\nThere is currently no vaccine against HCV, and access to treatment for HBV and HCV is still low.\n\nWHO's Global Health Sector Strategy on viral hepatitis aims to test 90 percent and treat 80 percent of people with HBV and HCV by 2030. The report notes that just 9 percent of all HBV infections and 20 percent of all HCV infections were diagnosed in 2015. An even smaller fraction - 8 percent of those diagnosed with HBV infection (1.7 million people) were on treatment, and only 7 percent of those diagnosed with HCV infection (1.1 million people) had started curative treatment during that year [2015].\n\nHBV infection requires lifelong treatment, and WHO currently recommends the medicine tenofovir, already widely used in HIV treatment. Hepatitis C can be cured within a relatively short time using the highly effective direct-acting antivirals (DAAs).\n\n\"We are still at an early stage of the viral hepatitis response, but the way forward looks promising,\" said Dr Gottfried Hirnschall, Director of WHO's Department of HIV and the Global Hepatitis Programme. \"More countries are making hepatitis services available for people in need - a diagnostic test costs less than USD 1 and the cure for hepatitis C can be below USD 200. But the data clearly highlight the urgency with which we must address the remaining gaps in testing and treatment.\"\n\nWHO's Global hepatitis report, 2017 demonstrates that despite challenges, some countries are taking successful steps to scale-up hepatitis services. China achieved high coverage (96 percent) for the timely birth dose of HBV vaccines, and reached the hepatitis B control goal of less than 1 percent prevalence in children under the age of 5 in 2015. Mongolia improved uptake of hepatitis treatment by including HBV and HCV medicines in its National Health Insurance scheme, which covers 98 percent of its population. In Egypt, generic competition has reduced the price of a 3-month cure for hepatitis C, from USD 900 in 2015, to less than USD 200 in 2016. Today in Pakistan, the same course costs as little as USD 100.\n\nImproving access to hepatitis C cure received a boost at the end of March 2017, when WHO prequalified the generic active pharmaceutical ingredient of sofosbuvir. This step will enable more countries to produce affordable hepatitis medicines.\n\nWHO's Global hepatitis report, 2017 aims to provide a starting point for hepatitis elimination by indicating baseline statistics on HBV and HCV infections, including mortality, and coverage levels of key interventions. Hepatitis B and C - the 2 main types out of 5 different hepatitis infections - are responsible for 96 percent of overall hepatitis mortality.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The full report can be found at:\nhttp://www.who.int/hepatitis/publications/global-hepatitis-report2017/en/.\n\nBoth HBV and HCV remain significant cause of chronic liver disease manifest by cirrhosis of the liver and hepatocellular carcinoma.

The WHO Global hepatitis report, 2017 indicates that the large majority of these people lack access to life-saving testing and treatment. As a result, millions of people are at risk of a slow progression to chronic liver disease, cancer, and death.\n\n\"Viral hepatitis is now recognized as a major public health challenge that requires an urgent response,\" said Dr Margaret Chan, WHO Director-General. \"Vaccines and medicines to tackle hepatitis exist, and WHO is committed to helping ensure these tools reach all those who need them.\"\n\nIncreasing mortality, new infections\n-----------------------------------------------\nViral hepatitis caused 1.34 million deaths in 2015, a number comparable to deaths caused by tuberculosis and HIV. But while mortality from tuberculosis and HIV has been declining, deaths from hepatitis are on the increase.\n\nApproximately 1.75 million people were newly infected with HCV in 2015, bringing the global total of people living with hepatitis C to 71 million.\nAlthough overall deaths from hepatitis are increasing, new infections of HBV are falling, thanks to increased coverage of HBV vaccination among children. Globally, 84 percent of children born in 2015 received the 3 recommended doses of hepatitis B vaccine. Between the pre-vaccine era (which, according to the year of introduction can range from the 1980s to the early 2000s) and 2015, the proportion of children under 5 years of age with new infections fell from 4.7 percent to 1.3 percent. However, an estimated 257 million people, mostly adults born before the introduction of the HBV vaccine, were living with chronic hepatitis B infection in 2015.\n\nHepatitis B levels vary widely across WHO regions with the WHO African Region and WHO Western Pacific Region sharing the greatest burden.\n\n- WHO Western Pacific Region: 6.2 percent of population (115 million people)\n- WHO African Region: 6.1 percent of population (60 million people)\n- WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region: 3.3 percent of population (21 million people)\n- WHO South-East Asia Region: 2 percent of population (39 million people)\n- WHO European Region: 1.6 percent of population (15 million people)\n- WHO Region of the Americas: 0.7 percent of population (7 million people)\n\nToday, unsafe injections in health care settings and injecting drug use are considered to be the most common routes of HCV transmissions. HCV prevalence by WHO region is:\n- WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region: 2.3 percent of population (15 million people)\n- WHO European Region: 1.5 percent of population (14 million people)\n- WHO African Region: 1 percent of population (11 million people)\n- WHO Region of the Americas: 1 percent of population (7 million people)\n- WHO Western Pacific Region: 1 percent of population (14 million people)\n- WHO South-East Asia Region: 0.5 percent of population (10 million people)\n\nThere is currently no vaccine against HCV, and access to treatment for HBV and HCV is still low.\n\nWHO's Global Health Sector Strategy on viral hepatitis aims to test 90 percent and treat 80 percent of people with HBV and HCV by 2030. The report notes that just 9 percent of all HBV infections and 20 percent of all HCV infections were diagnosed in 2015. An even smaller fraction - 8 percent of those diagnosed with HBV infection (1.7 million people) were on treatment, and only 7 percent of those diagnosed with HCV infection (1.1 million people) had started curative treatment during that year [2015].\n\nHBV infection requires lifelong treatment, and WHO currently recommends the medicine tenofovir, already widely used in HIV treatment. Hepatitis C can be cured within a relatively short time using the highly effective direct-acting antivirals (DAAs).\n\n\"We are still at an early stage of the viral hepatitis response, but the way forward looks promising,\" said Dr Gottfried Hirnschall, Director of WHO's Department of HIV and the Global Hepatitis Programme. \"More countries are making hepatitis services available for people in need - a diagnostic test costs less than USD 1 and the cure for hepatitis C can be below USD 200. But the data clearly highlight the urgency with which we must address the remaining gaps in testing and treatment.\"\n\nWHO's Global hepatitis report, 2017 demonstrates that despite challenges, some countries are taking successful steps to scale-up hepatitis services. China achieved high coverage (96 percent) for the timely birth dose of HBV vaccines, and reached the hepatitis B control goal of less than 1 percent prevalence in children under the age of 5 in 2015. Mongolia improved uptake of hepatitis treatment by including HBV and HCV medicines in its National Health Insurance scheme, which covers 98 percent of its population. In Egypt, generic competition has reduced the price of a 3-month cure for hepatitis C, from USD 900 in 2015, to less than USD 200 in 2016. Today in Pakistan, the same course costs as little as USD 100.\n\nImproving access to hepatitis C cure received a boost at the end of March 2017, when WHO prequalified the generic active pharmaceutical ingredient of sofosbuvir. This step will enable more countries to produce affordable hepatitis medicines.\n\nWHO's Global hepatitis report, 2017 aims to provide a starting point for hepatitis elimination by indicating baseline statistics on HBV and HCV infections, including mortality, and coverage levels of key interventions. Hepatitis B and C - the 2 main types out of 5 different hepatitis infections - are responsible for 96 percent of overall hepatitis mortality.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The full report can be found at:\nhttp://www.who.int/hepatitis/publications/global-hepatitis-report2017/en/.\n\nBoth HBV and HCV remain significant cause of chronic liver disease manifest by cirrhosis of the liver and hepatocellular carcinoma.

The WHO Global hepatitis report, 2017 indicates that the large majority of these people lack access to life-saving testing and treatment. As a result, millions of people are at risk of a slow progression to chronic liver disease, cancer, and death.\n\n\"Viral hepatitis is now recognized as a major public health challenge that requires an urgent response,\" said Dr Margaret Chan, WHO Director-General. \"Vaccines and medicines to tackle hepatitis exist, and WHO is committed to helping ensure these tools reach all those who need them.\"\n\nIncreasing mortality, new infections\n-----------------------------------------------\nViral hepatitis caused 1.34 million deaths in 2015, a number comparable to deaths caused by tuberculosis and HIV. But while mortality from tuberculosis and HIV has been declining, deaths from hepatitis are on the increase.\n\nApproximately 1.75 million people were newly infected with HCV in 2015, bringing the global total of people living with hepatitis C to 71 million.\nAlthough overall deaths from hepatitis are increasing, new infections of HBV are falling, thanks to increased coverage of HBV vaccination among children. Globally, 84 percent of children born in 2015 received the 3 recommended doses of hepatitis B vaccine. Between the pre-vaccine era (which, according to the year of introduction can range from the 1980s to the early 2000s) and 2015, the proportion of children under 5 years of age with new infections fell from 4.7 percent to 1.3 percent. However, an estimated 257 million people, mostly adults born before the introduction of the HBV vaccine, were living with chronic hepatitis B infection in 2015.\n\nHepatitis B levels vary widely across WHO regions with the WHO African Region and WHO Western Pacific Region sharing the greatest burden.\n\n- WHO Western Pacific Region: 6.2 percent of population (115 million people)\n- WHO African Region: 6.1 percent of population (60 million people)\n- WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region: 3.3 percent of population (21 million people)\n- WHO South-East Asia Region: 2 percent of population (39 million people)\n- WHO European Region: 1.6 percent of population (15 million people)\n- WHO Region of the Americas: 0.7 percent of population (7 million people)\n\nToday, unsafe injections in health care settings and injecting drug use are considered to be the most common routes of HCV transmissions. HCV prevalence by WHO region is:\n- WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region: 2.3 percent of population (15 million people)\n- WHO European Region: 1.5 percent of population (14 million people)\n- WHO African Region: 1 percent of population (11 million people)\n- WHO Region of the Americas: 1 percent of population (7 million people)\n- WHO Western Pacific Region: 1 percent of population (14 million people)\n- WHO South-East Asia Region: 0.5 percent of population (10 million people)\n\nThere is currently no vaccine against HCV, and access to treatment for HBV and HCV is still low.\n\nWHO's Global Health Sector Strategy on viral hepatitis aims to test 90 percent and treat 80 percent of people with HBV and HCV by 2030. The report notes that just 9 percent of all HBV infections and 20 percent of all HCV infections were diagnosed in 2015. An even smaller fraction - 8 percent of those diagnosed with HBV infection (1.7 million people) were on treatment, and only 7 percent of those diagnosed with HCV infection (1.1 million people) had started curative treatment during that year [2015].\n\nHBV infection requires lifelong treatment, and WHO currently recommends the medicine tenofovir, already widely used in HIV treatment. Hepatitis C can be cured within a relatively short time using the highly effective direct-acting antivirals (DAAs).\n\n\"We are still at an early stage of the viral hepatitis response, but the way forward looks promising,\" said Dr Gottfried Hirnschall, Director of WHO's Department of HIV and the Global Hepatitis Programme. \"More countries are making hepatitis services available for people in need - a diagnostic test costs less than USD 1 and the cure for hepatitis C can be below USD 200. But the data clearly highlight the urgency with which we must address the remaining gaps in testing and treatment.\"\n\nWHO's Global hepatitis report, 2017 demonstrates that despite challenges, some countries are taking successful steps to scale-up hepatitis services. China achieved high coverage (96 percent) for the timely birth dose of HBV vaccines, and reached the hepatitis B control goal of less than 1 percent prevalence in children under the age of 5 in 2015. Mongolia improved uptake of hepatitis treatment by including HBV and HCV medicines in its National Health Insurance scheme, which covers 98 percent of its population. In Egypt, generic competition has reduced the price of a 3-month cure for hepatitis C, from USD 900 in 2015, to less than USD 200 in 2016. Today in Pakistan, the same course costs as little as USD 100.\n\nImproving access to hepatitis C cure received a boost at the end of March 2017, when WHO prequalified the generic active pharmaceutical ingredient of sofosbuvir. This step will enable more countries to produce affordable hepatitis medicines.\n\nWHO's Global hepatitis report, 2017 aims to provide a starting point for hepatitis elimination by indicating baseline statistics on HBV and HCV infections, including mortality, and coverage levels of key interventions. Hepatitis B and C - the 2 main types out of 5 different hepatitis infections - are responsible for 96 percent of overall hepatitis mortality.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The full report can be found at:\nhttp://www.who.int/hepatitis/publications/global-hepatitis-report2017/en/.\n\nBoth HBV and HCV remain significant cause of chronic liver disease manifest by cirrhosis of the liver and hepatocellular carcinoma.

The WHO Global hepatitis report, 2017 indicates that the large majority of these people lack access to life-saving testing and treatment. As a result, millions of people are at risk of a slow progression to chronic liver disease, cancer, and death.\n\n\"Viral hepatitis is now recognized as a major public health challenge that requires an urgent response,\" said Dr Margaret Chan, WHO Director-General. \"Vaccines and medicines to tackle hepatitis exist, and WHO is committed to helping ensure these tools reach all those who need them.\"\n\nIncreasing mortality, new infections\n-----------------------------------------------\nViral hepatitis caused 1.34 million deaths in 2015, a number comparable to deaths caused by tuberculosis and HIV. But while mortality from tuberculosis and HIV has been declining, deaths from hepatitis are on the increase.\n\nApproximately 1.75 million people were newly infected with HCV in 2015, bringing the global total of people living with hepatitis C to 71 million.\nAlthough overall deaths from hepatitis are increasing, new infections of HBV are falling, thanks to increased coverage of HBV vaccination among children. Globally, 84 percent of children born in 2015 received the 3 recommended doses of hepatitis B vaccine. Between the pre-vaccine era (which, according to the year of introduction can range from the 1980s to the early 2000s) and 2015, the proportion of children under 5 years of age with new infections fell from 4.7 percent to 1.3 percent. However, an estimated 257 million people, mostly adults born before the introduction of the HBV vaccine, were living with chronic hepatitis B infection in 2015.\n\nHepatitis B levels vary widely across WHO regions with the WHO African Region and WHO Western Pacific Region sharing the greatest burden.\n\n- WHO Western Pacific Region: 6.2 percent of population (115 million people)\n- WHO African Region: 6.1 percent of population (60 million people)\n- WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region: 3.3 percent of population (21 million people)\n- WHO South-East Asia Region: 2 percent of population (39 million people)\n- WHO European Region: 1.6 percent of population (15 million people)\n- WHO Region of the Americas: 0.7 percent of population (7 million people)\n\nToday, unsafe injections in health care settings and injecting drug use are considered to be the most common routes of HCV transmissions. HCV prevalence by WHO region is:\n- WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region: 2.3 percent of population (15 million people)\n- WHO European Region: 1.5 percent of population (14 million people)\n- WHO African Region: 1 percent of population (11 million people)\n- WHO Region of the Americas: 1 percent of population (7 million people)\n- WHO Western Pacific Region: 1 percent of population (14 million people)\n- WHO South-East Asia Region: 0.5 percent of population (10 million people)\n\nThere is currently no vaccine against HCV, and access to treatment for HBV and HCV is still low.\n\nWHO's Global Health Sector Strategy on viral hepatitis aims to test 90 percent and treat 80 percent of people with HBV and HCV by 2030. The report notes that just 9 percent of all HBV infections and 20 percent of all HCV infections were diagnosed in 2015. An even smaller fraction - 8 percent of those diagnosed with HBV infection (1.7 million people) were on treatment, and only 7 percent of those diagnosed with HCV infection (1.1 million people) had started curative treatment during that year [2015].\n\nHBV infection requires lifelong treatment, and WHO currently recommends the medicine tenofovir, already widely used in HIV treatment. Hepatitis C can be cured within a relatively short time using the highly effective direct-acting antivirals (DAAs).\n\n\"We are still at an early stage of the viral hepatitis response, but the way forward looks promising,\" said Dr Gottfried Hirnschall, Director of WHO's Department of HIV and the Global Hepatitis Programme. \"More countries are making hepatitis services available for people in need - a diagnostic test costs less than USD 1 and the cure for hepatitis C can be below USD 200. But the data clearly highlight the urgency with which we must address the remaining gaps in testing and treatment.\"\n\nWHO's Global hepatitis report, 2017 demonstrates that despite challenges, some countries are taking successful steps to scale-up hepatitis services. China achieved high coverage (96 percent) for the timely birth dose of HBV vaccines, and reached the hepatitis B control goal of less than 1 percent prevalence in children under the age of 5 in 2015. Mongolia improved uptake of hepatitis treatment by including HBV and HCV medicines in its National Health Insurance scheme, which covers 98 percent of its population. In Egypt, generic competition has reduced the price of a 3-month cure for hepatitis C, from USD 900 in 2015, to less than USD 200 in 2016. Today in Pakistan, the same course costs as little as USD 100.\n\nImproving access to hepatitis C cure received a boost at the end of March 2017, when WHO prequalified the generic active pharmaceutical ingredient of sofosbuvir. This step will enable more countries to produce affordable hepatitis medicines.\n\nWHO's Global hepatitis report, 2017 aims to provide a starting point for hepatitis elimination by indicating baseline statistics on HBV and HCV infections, including mortality, and coverage levels of key interventions. Hepatitis B and C - the 2 main types out of 5 different hepatitis infections - are responsible for 96 percent of overall hepatitis mortality.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The full report can be found at:\nhttp://www.who.int/hepatitis/publications/global-hepatitis-report2017/en/.\n\nBoth HBV and HCV remain significant cause of chronic liver disease manifest by cirrhosis of the liver and hepatocellular carcinoma.

Emergency departments started screening patients 17 and older in 2015. Since that universal screening began, the ER at UAB (University of Alabama Birmingham) hospital started to see more cases among people who inject drugs.\n\n\"This is an alarming problem,\" said Dr. James Galbraith, an ER doctor at UAB. \"There is a direct correlation between the hepatitis C cases we're identifying in this younger population, and the emerging opioid injection drug use, largely heroin.\"\n\nER doctors did not start regularly testing for Hepatitis C until 2013 - once a cure became more readily available. Initially, testing was done on baby boomers, who account for 75 percent of hepatitis C cases in the USA.

These alarming new statistics come from a recent study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that reveals some of the ways shooting up heroin and painkillers endangers the next generation.\n\n\"Kentucky is experiencing the ravages of a hepatitis C epidemic that has been going on for years now,\" said Dr John Ward, director of CDC's Division of Viral Hepatitis and a senior author on the study. \"And the state is not alone in having a large epidemic of hepatitis C,\" an infectious, viral liver disease. \"We are concerned other states have this problem, too.\"\n\nResearchers analyzed commercial laboratory data from Quest Diagnostics, information from Kentucky state health officials and national birth certificate data for the years 2011-2014. They found hepatitis C detection among women of childbearing age rose 213 per cent in Kentucky, from 275 to 862 per 100 000; compared with 22 per cent nationally, or 139 to 169 per 100 000. During those same years, Kentucky's health department received reports of 777 pregnant women testing positive for antibodies against hepatitis C.\n\nMeanwhile, the proportion of babies born to women with hepatitis C in Kentucky rose 124 per cent, from 1 in 142 to 1 in 63, which Ward called \"very troubling and disturbing and alarming.\" The national increase was 68 per cent, from 1 in 536 to 1 in 308.\n\n\"The numbers speak for themselves,\" said Dr Ardis Hoven, an infectious disease consultant for the Kentucky Department for Public Health and former president of the American Medical Association. \"If you look at the risk factors, you see IV drug use is the main one,\" although tattoos and multiple sex partners also put people at risk. \"...The study shines a light on a significant issue.\"\n\nOther recent research also points to a growing problem with drug-fueled diseases in the region. One CDC report showed that 220 US counties are at high risk for a rapid spread of hepatitis C and HIV among drug users -- and 54 of them are in Kentucky. Another study found the rate of new hepatitis C cases among people 30 and younger more than tripled from 2006-2012 in Kentucky, Tennessee, Virginia, and West Virginia.\n\nIn the latest year for which statistics are available, Kentucky had the highest rate of acute hepatitis C infections in the nation -- 4 per 100 000 people in 2014, compared with a national average of 0.7 per 100 000 people.\n\nHepatitis C is also a growing problem in Southern Indiana, where that state's worst-ever HIV outbreak has stricken 203 people. Dr William Cooke, the lone physician in Austin, Indiana, said nearly 600 people were found to have hepatitis C during the outbreak, which was mostly tied to injecting the painkiller Opana (oxymorphone).\n\nRealizing the threat to children, Kentucky officials in 2015 began requiring doctors to report all hepatitis C infected pregnant women and children up to age 5, as well as babies born to infected women. Beginning in the fall of 2016, Kentucky plans to require reporting of all hepatitis C lab test results, positive or negative. Ward praised these efforts.\n\nAlthough hepatitis testing isn't mandatory in the state, Hoven said she strongly recommends all pregnant women be tested and everyone get educated about the disease. She also said Kentucky needs more needle exchanges, where addicts can trade dirty needles for clean ones, and more drug treatment to help people kick their addictions. \"Clearly, we need access to more providers of care,\" she said. \"We will continue to work on this.\"\n\nDoctors agreed the stakes are high. If girls and women 15 to 44 years old contract hepatitis C, the virus can fester inside them for decades. Up to 70 per cent of hepatitis C patients will go on to develop chronic liver disease, CDC says, with up to 20 per cent developing cirrhosis of the liver and up to 5 per cent dying of cirrhosis or liver cancer. Plus, nearly 6 per cent of babies born to women with hepatitis C contract the disease from their mothers. Some children \"clear it on their own\", Hoven said, but others remain infected and are at risk for severe liver disease. \"If we help people before they get pregnant,\" Cooke said, \"we can prevent this.\"\n\nNew, high-priced hepatitis C drugs can actually cure the disease -- although they can't be used in children and Cooke said many patients have a hard time getting their insurance to pay for them. But when infected young women get such medicines before getting pregnant, doctors said they and their future babies can benefit.\n\nCDC researchers said their findings underscore the importance of preventing hepatitis C, identifying people at risk and testing them so that they can get into treatment quickly if they're infected. Such measures are crucial, they said, as the scourge of painkiller and heroin abuse continues to grow. Federal statistics show that every day, 3900 Americans begin abusing prescription opioids, 580 start using heroin, and 78 die from an opioid overdose.\n\nWhile Kentucky may stand out in this study, Ward said, \"by no means is Kentucky the only state with this problem.\"\n\n[byline: Laura Ungar]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[In the absence of a vaccine, infection avoidance techniques such as needle exchange programs and the need for aggressive programs in counseling, not criminalizing, substance addiction are needed.

These alarming new statistics come from a recent study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that reveals some of the ways shooting up heroin and painkillers endangers the next generation.\n\n\"Kentucky is experiencing the ravages of a hepatitis C epidemic that has been going on for years now,\" said Dr John Ward, director of CDC's Division of Viral Hepatitis and a senior author on the study. \"And the state is not alone in having a large epidemic of hepatitis C,\" an infectious, viral liver disease. \"We are concerned other states have this problem, too.\"\n\nResearchers analyzed commercial laboratory data from Quest Diagnostics, information from Kentucky state health officials and national birth certificate data for the years 2011-2014. They found hepatitis C detection among women of childbearing age rose 213 per cent in Kentucky, from 275 to 862 per 100 000; compared with 22 per cent nationally, or 139 to 169 per 100 000. During those same years, Kentucky's health department received reports of 777 pregnant women testing positive for antibodies against hepatitis C.\n\nMeanwhile, the proportion of babies born to women with hepatitis C in Kentucky rose 124 per cent, from 1 in 142 to 1 in 63, which Ward called \"very troubling and disturbing and alarming.\" The national increase was 68 per cent, from 1 in 536 to 1 in 308.\n\n\"The numbers speak for themselves,\" said Dr Ardis Hoven, an infectious disease consultant for the Kentucky Department for Public Health and former president of the American Medical Association. \"If you look at the risk factors, you see IV drug use is the main one,\" although tattoos and multiple sex partners also put people at risk. \"...The study shines a light on a significant issue.\"\n\nOther recent research also points to a growing problem with drug-fueled diseases in the region. One CDC report showed that 220 US counties are at high risk for a rapid spread of hepatitis C and HIV among drug users -- and 54 of them are in Kentucky. Another study found the rate of new hepatitis C cases among people 30 and younger more than tripled from 2006-2012 in Kentucky, Tennessee, Virginia, and West Virginia.\n\nIn the latest year for which statistics are available, Kentucky had the highest rate of acute hepatitis C infections in the nation -- 4 per 100 000 people in 2014, compared with a national average of 0.7 per 100 000 people.\n\nHepatitis C is also a growing problem in Southern Indiana, where that state's worst-ever HIV outbreak has stricken 203 people. Dr William Cooke, the lone physician in Austin, Indiana, said nearly 600 people were found to have hepatitis C during the outbreak, which was mostly tied to injecting the painkiller Opana (oxymorphone).\n\nRealizing the threat to children, Kentucky officials in 2015 began requiring doctors to report all hepatitis C infected pregnant women and children up to age 5, as well as babies born to infected women. Beginning in the fall of 2016, Kentucky plans to require reporting of all hepatitis C lab test results, positive or negative. Ward praised these efforts.\n\nAlthough hepatitis testing isn't mandatory in the state, Hoven said she strongly recommends all pregnant women be tested and everyone get educated about the disease. She also said Kentucky needs more needle exchanges, where addicts can trade dirty needles for clean ones, and more drug treatment to help people kick their addictions. \"Clearly, we need access to more providers of care,\" she said. \"We will continue to work on this.\"\n\nDoctors agreed the stakes are high. If girls and women 15 to 44 years old contract hepatitis C, the virus can fester inside them for decades. Up to 70 per cent of hepatitis C patients will go on to develop chronic liver disease, CDC says, with up to 20 per cent developing cirrhosis of the liver and up to 5 per cent dying of cirrhosis or liver cancer. Plus, nearly 6 per cent of babies born to women with hepatitis C contract the disease from their mothers. Some children \"clear it on their own\", Hoven said, but others remain infected and are at risk for severe liver disease. \"If we help people before they get pregnant,\" Cooke said, \"we can prevent this.\"\n\nNew, high-priced hepatitis C drugs can actually cure the disease -- although they can't be used in children and Cooke said many patients have a hard time getting their insurance to pay for them. But when infected young women get such medicines before getting pregnant, doctors said they and their future babies can benefit.\n\nCDC researchers said their findings underscore the importance of preventing hepatitis C, identifying people at risk and testing them so that they can get into treatment quickly if they're infected. Such measures are crucial, they said, as the scourge of painkiller and heroin abuse continues to grow. Federal statistics show that every day, 3900 Americans begin abusing prescription opioids, 580 start using heroin, and 78 die from an opioid overdose.\n\nWhile Kentucky may stand out in this study, Ward said, \"by no means is Kentucky the only state with this problem.\"\n\n[byline: Laura Ungar]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[In the absence of a vaccine, infection avoidance techniques such as needle exchange programs and the need for aggressive programs in counseling, not criminalizing, substance addiction are needed.

Ward praised these efforts.\n\nAlthough hepatitis testing isn't mandatory in the state, Hoven said she strongly recommends all pregnant women be tested and everyone get educated about the disease. She also said Kentucky needs more needle exchanges, where addicts can trade dirty needles for clean ones, and more drug treatment to help people kick their addictions. \"Clearly, we need access to more providers of care,\" she said. \"We will continue to work on this.\"\n\nDoctors agreed the stakes are high. If girls and women 15 to 44 years old contract hepatitis C, the virus can fester inside them for decades. Up to 70 per cent of hepatitis C patients will go on to develop chronic liver disease, CDC says, with up to 20 per cent developing cirrhosis of the liver and up to 5 per cent dying of cirrhosis or liver cancer. Plus, nearly 6 per cent of babies born to women with hepatitis C contract the disease from their mothers. Some children \"clear it on their own\", Hoven said, but others remain infected and are at risk for severe liver disease. \"If we help people before they get pregnant,\" Cooke said, \"we can prevent this.\"\n\nNew, high-priced hepatitis C drugs can actually cure the disease -- although they can't be used in children and Cooke said many patients have a hard time getting their insurance to pay for them. But when infected young women get such medicines before getting pregnant, doctors said they and their future babies can benefit.\n\nCDC researchers said their findings underscore the importance of preventing hepatitis C, identifying people at risk and testing them so that they can get into treatment quickly if they're infected.

These alarming new statistics come from a recent study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that reveals some of the ways shooting up heroin and painkillers endangers the next generation.\n\n\"Kentucky is experiencing the ravages of a hepatitis C epidemic that has been going on for years now,\" said Dr John Ward, director of CDC's Division of Viral Hepatitis and a senior author on the study. \"And the state is not alone in having a large epidemic of hepatitis C,\" an infectious, viral liver disease. \"We are concerned other states have this problem, too.\"\n\nResearchers analyzed commercial laboratory data from Quest Diagnostics, information from Kentucky state health officials and national birth certificate data for the years 2011-2014. They found hepatitis C detection among women of childbearing age rose 213 per cent in Kentucky, from 275 to 862 per 100 000; compared with 22 per cent nationally, or 139 to 169 per 100 000. During those same years, Kentucky's health department received reports of 777 pregnant women testing positive for antibodies against hepatitis C.\n\nMeanwhile, the proportion of babies born to women with hepatitis C in Kentucky rose 124 per cent, from 1 in 142 to 1 in 63, which Ward called \"very troubling and disturbing and alarming.\" The national increase was 68 per cent, from 1 in 536 to 1 in 308.\n\n\"The numbers speak for themselves,\" said Dr Ardis Hoven, an infectious disease consultant for the Kentucky Department for Public Health and former president of the American Medical Association. \"If you look at the risk factors, you see IV drug use is the main one,\" although tattoos and multiple sex partners also put people at risk. \"...The study shines a light on a significant issue.\"\n\nOther recent research also points to a growing problem with drug-fueled diseases in the region. One CDC report showed that 220 US counties are at high risk for a rapid spread of hepatitis C and HIV among drug users -- and 54 of them are in Kentucky. Another study found the rate of new hepatitis C cases among people 30 and younger more than tripled from 2006-2012 in Kentucky, Tennessee, Virginia, and West Virginia.\n\nIn the latest year for which statistics are available, Kentucky had the highest rate of acute hepatitis C infections in the nation -- 4 per 100 000 people in 2014, compared with a national average of 0.7 per 100 000 people.\n\nHepatitis C is also a growing problem in Southern Indiana, where that state's worst-ever HIV outbreak has stricken 203 people. Dr William Cooke, the lone physician in Austin, Indiana, said nearly 600 people were found to have hepatitis C during the outbreak, which was mostly tied to injecting the painkiller Opana (oxymorphone).\n\nRealizing the threat to children, Kentucky officials in 2015 began requiring doctors to report all hepatitis C infected pregnant women and children up to age 5, as well as babies born to infected women.

But NHS Lanarkshire [Scotland] is now working with other health boards across the UK to notify people who may have had a surgical procedure carried out by the individual between 1982 and 2008. The employee worked in hospitals across Lanarkshire during the period, mainly in Wishaw General Hospital and the former Law Hospital as well as at the William Harvey Hospital in Kent [southeast England] for 3 months between January and April 2006.\n\nWhen the worker initially tested positive in 2008, the UK Advisory Panel (UKAP) said patients did not need to be warned as the risk was thought to be low, but 2 positive cases have now emerged.

The patients, most of who live in Utah but some out of state, could have been exposed to a rare strain of hepatitis C, genotype 2b.\n\nHepatitis C is a chronic condition and can lay dormant for up to 25 years and then may cause serious liver problems such as liver failure and eventually death. The possible window for exposure was from June 2013 to November 2014 at Ogden's McKay-Dee hospital.\n\nHepatitis C is a reportable disease, so when the Utah State Health Department received a hepatitis case report in 2014, they started researching its origins, The strain was a rare one that when tracked came up with a match. It led to a nurse who was fired from McKay-Dee hospital. The health department started looking at the Ogden hospital then after they'd ruled out every other possibility in a hepatitis C case they were tracking.\n\nDoctor Angela Dunn with the health department notes that the most common way of getting hepatitis C in the US is \"through IV drug use. And other less common ways are tattoos or piercings from unlicensed parlors or being born to a mother with hepatitis C.\" Anyone who received a blood transfusion prior to 1992 can also be at risk. None of these risk factors were present with the man who tested positive, and that's what led investigators to the ER at McKay-Dee hospital where the man had been admitted.\n\nThe time this patient was in the ER was the same time a nurse who has since been fired was working. The health department asked the hospital to test anyone they knew who had risk factors that could present with hepatitis C. The former nurse was tested and came back positive with hepatitis C- genotype 2b, the same as the initial reported case.\n\nDunn says they \"don't know exactly how it happened in this case but that a concern is that needles could be reused and spread infectious diseases.\"\n\nHepatitis C is transferred in blood-to-blood contact. The former nurse was let go for \"divergence,\" or using what are assumed to be hospital issued drugs or syringes without a prescription. It is possible that needles or syringes were used by the nurse and then re-used for patients, though it is tough to prove how the disease was spread.\n\nThe disease is serious and can spread to others even when symptoms are not present, and that's why it is so important that anyone who was treated in the time frame with certain medications be tested.\n\nAccording to Dunn, hepatitis C \"does not have symptoms usually at the beginning, so it is very important if you were exposed to get tested.\"\n\nNotifications, 4800 of them, were dropped in the mail on Fri 6 Nov 2015. Dunn said it is \"out of an abundance of caution we cast a very broad net.\" She and hospital officials encourage \"anyone who received a letter\" to \"definitely get tested.\" If a test comes back positive, treatments can be administered before a patient gets sick. Dunn says \"there is really good treatment for hepatitis C\" and calls it a \"curable disease.\"\n\n[Byline: Heidi Hatch]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[That the alleged healthcare worker and a patient both have genotype 2b does not definitively link them without analyzing each virus's RNA genome.\n\nBloodborne viruses such as hepatitis B and C and HIV can be transmitted by the contamination of multidose vials with a syringe containing blood harboring the virus. If the viruses are genetically identical, not just the same genotype, this suggests that the patient was injected by a syringe containing the medicine (likely a strong analgesic, such as an opiate, that had been previously contaminated by the healthcare worker's blood).\n\nRegarding the significance of genotypes of HCV, the following is derived from a USA Veterans Administration publication http://www.hepatitis.va.gov/provider/reviews/genotypes.asp#S1X [the comments about response to therapy also relate to the newer anti-HCV modes of therapy]:\n\nAn important variable for all patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) is the \"genotype\" of HCV with which they are infected. This is the strain of the virus to which they were exposed when they were infected, often many years prior to their evaluation, and it is determined by a simple blood test. Genotypes of HCV are genetically distinct groups of the virus that have arisen during its evolution (1). Approximately 75 percent of Americans with HCV have genotype 1 of the virus (subtypes 1a or 1b), and 20-25 percent have genotypes 2 or 3, with small numbers of patients infected with genotypes 4, 5, or 6 (2). Most patients with HCV are found to have only one principal genotype, rather than multiple genotypes (3-5). Genotype 4 is much more common in Africa than in many other parts of the world, genotype 6 is common in Southeast Asia, and each area of the world has its own distribution of genotypes (6).\n\nGenotype generally has not been found in epidemiological studies to play a large role in liver disease progression due to HCV. Rather, genotype is of clinical importance principally as a factor in response to HCV treatments. With all treatments tested to date, patients with genotypes 2 and 3 are more than twice as likely as patients with genotype 1 to achieve a sustained virological response to therapy (2-5, 7). In addition, when using combination therapy with interferon and ribavirin, patients with genotypes 2 or 3 generally are treated for only 24 weeks, whereas it is recommended that patients infected with genotype 1 receive treatment for 48 weeks.\n\n1.

The patients, most of who live in Utah but some out of state, could have been exposed to a rare strain of hepatitis C, genotype 2b.\n\nHepatitis C is a chronic condition and can lay dormant for up to 25 years and then may cause serious liver problems such as liver failure and eventually death. The possible window for exposure was from June 2013 to November 2014 at Ogden's McKay-Dee hospital.\n\nHepatitis C is a reportable disease, so when the Utah State Health Department received a hepatitis case report in 2014, they started researching its origins, The strain was a rare one that when tracked came up with a match. It led to a nurse who was fired from McKay-Dee hospital. The health department started looking at the Ogden hospital then after they'd ruled out every other possibility in a hepatitis C case they were tracking.\n\nDoctor Angela Dunn with the health department notes that the most common way of getting hepatitis C in the US is \"through IV drug use. And other less common ways are tattoos or piercings from unlicensed parlors or being born to a mother with hepatitis C.\" Anyone who received a blood transfusion prior to 1992 can also be at risk. None of these risk factors were present with the man who tested positive, and that's what led investigators to the ER at McKay-Dee hospital where the man had been admitted.\n\nThe time this patient was in the ER was the same time a nurse who has since been fired was working. The health department asked the hospital to test anyone they knew who had risk factors that could present with hepatitis C. The former nurse was tested and came back positive with hepatitis C- genotype 2b, the same as the initial reported case.\n\nDunn says they \"don't know exactly how it happened in this case but that a concern is that needles could be reused and spread infectious diseases.\"\n\nHepatitis C is transferred in blood-to-blood contact. The former nurse was let go for \"divergence,\" or using what are assumed to be hospital issued drugs or syringes without a prescription. It is possible that needles or syringes were used by the nurse and then re-used for patients, though it is tough to prove how the disease was spread.\n\nThe disease is serious and can spread to others even when symptoms are not present, and that's why it is so important that anyone who was treated in the time frame with certain medications be tested.\n\nAccording to Dunn, hepatitis C \"does not have symptoms usually at the beginning, so it is very important if you were exposed to get tested.\"\n\nNotifications, 4800 of them, were dropped in the mail on Fri 6 Nov 2015. Dunn said it is \"out of an abundance of caution we cast a very broad net.\" She and hospital officials encourage \"anyone who received a letter\" to \"definitely get tested.\" If a test comes back positive, treatments can be administered before a patient gets sick. Dunn says \"there is really good treatment for hepatitis C\" and calls it a \"curable disease.\"\n\n[Byline: Heidi Hatch]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[That the alleged healthcare worker and a patient both have genotype 2b does not definitively link them without analyzing each virus's RNA genome.\n\nBloodborne viruses such as hepatitis B and C and HIV can be transmitted by the contamination of multidose vials with a syringe containing blood harboring the virus. If the viruses are genetically identical, not just the same genotype, this suggests that the patient was injected by a syringe containing the medicine (likely a strong analgesic, such as an opiate, that had been previously contaminated by the healthcare worker's blood).\n\nRegarding the significance of genotypes of HCV, the following is derived from a USA Veterans Administration publication http://www.hepatitis.va.gov/provider/reviews/genotypes.asp#S1X [the comments about response to therapy also relate to the newer anti-HCV modes of therapy]:\n\nAn important variable for all patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) is the \"genotype\" of HCV with which they are infected. This is the strain of the virus to which they were exposed when they were infected, often many years prior to their evaluation, and it is determined by a simple blood test. Genotypes of HCV are genetically distinct groups of the virus that have arisen during its evolution (1). Approximately 75 percent of Americans with HCV have genotype 1 of the virus (subtypes 1a or 1b), and 20-25 percent have genotypes 2 or 3, with small numbers of patients infected with genotypes 4, 5, or 6 (2). Most patients with HCV are found to have only one principal genotype, rather than multiple genotypes (3-5). Genotype 4 is much more common in Africa than in many other parts of the world, genotype 6 is common in Southeast Asia, and each area of the world has its own distribution of genotypes (6).\n\nGenotype generally has not been found in epidemiological studies to play a large role in liver disease progression due to HCV. Rather, genotype is of clinical importance principally as a factor in response to HCV treatments. With all treatments tested to date, patients with genotypes 2 and 3 are more than twice as likely as patients with genotype 1 to achieve a sustained virological response to therapy (2-5, 7). In addition, when using combination therapy with interferon and ribavirin, patients with genotypes 2 or 3 generally are treated for only 24 weeks, whereas it is recommended that patients infected with genotype 1 receive treatment for 48 weeks.\n\n1.

The patients, most of who live in Utah but some out of state, could have been exposed to a rare strain of hepatitis C, genotype 2b.\n\nHepatitis C is a chronic condition and can lay dormant for up to 25 years and then may cause serious liver problems such as liver failure and eventually death. The possible window for exposure was from June 2013 to November 2014 at Ogden's McKay-Dee hospital.\n\nHepatitis C is a reportable disease, so when the Utah State Health Department received a hepatitis case report in 2014, they started researching its origins, The strain was a rare one that when tracked came up with a match. It led to a nurse who was fired from McKay-Dee hospital. The health department started looking at the Ogden hospital then after they'd ruled out every other possibility in a hepatitis C case they were tracking.\n\nDoctor Angela Dunn with the health department notes that the most common way of getting hepatitis C in the US is \"through IV drug use. And other less common ways are tattoos or piercings from unlicensed parlors or being born to a mother with hepatitis C.\" Anyone who received a blood transfusion prior to 1992 can also be at risk. None of these risk factors were present with the man who tested positive, and that's what led investigators to the ER at McKay-Dee hospital where the man had been admitted.\n\nThe time this patient was in the ER was the same time a nurse who has since been fired was working. The health department asked the hospital to test anyone they knew who had risk factors that could present with hepatitis C. The former nurse was tested and came back positive with hepatitis C- genotype 2b, the same as the initial reported case.\n\nDunn says they \"don't know exactly how it happened in this case but that a concern is that needles could be reused and spread infectious diseases.\"\n\nHepatitis C is transferred in blood-to-blood contact. The former nurse was let go for \"divergence,\" or using what are assumed to be hospital issued drugs or syringes without a prescription. It is possible that needles or syringes were used by the nurse and then re-used for patients, though it is tough to prove how the disease was spread.\n\nThe disease is serious and can spread to others even when symptoms are not present, and that's why it is so important that anyone who was treated in the time frame with certain medications be tested.\n\nAccording to Dunn, hepatitis C \"does not have symptoms usually at the beginning, so it is very important if you were exposed to get tested.\"\n\nNotifications, 4800 of them, were dropped in the mail on Fri 6 Nov 2015. Dunn said it is \"out of an abundance of caution we cast a very broad net.\" She and hospital officials encourage \"anyone who received a letter\" to \"definitely get tested.\" If a test comes back positive, treatments can be administered before a patient gets sick. Dunn says \"there is really good treatment for hepatitis C\" and calls it a \"curable disease.\"\n\n[Byline: Heidi Hatch]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[That the alleged healthcare worker and a patient both have genotype 2b does not definitively link them without analyzing each virus's RNA genome.\n\nBloodborne viruses such as hepatitis B and C and HIV can be transmitted by the contamination of multidose vials with a syringe containing blood harboring the virus. If the viruses are genetically identical, not just the same genotype, this suggests that the patient was injected by a syringe containing the medicine (likely a strong analgesic, such as an opiate, that had been previously contaminated by the healthcare worker's blood).\n\nRegarding the significance of genotypes of HCV, the following is derived from a USA Veterans Administration publication http://www.hepatitis.va.gov/provider/reviews/genotypes.asp#S1X [the comments about response to therapy also relate to the newer anti-HCV modes of therapy]:\n\nAn important variable for all patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) is the \"genotype\" of HCV with which they are infected. This is the strain of the virus to which they were exposed when they were infected, often many years prior to their evaluation, and it is determined by a simple blood test. Genotypes of HCV are genetically distinct groups of the virus that have arisen during its evolution (1). Approximately 75 percent of Americans with HCV have genotype 1 of the virus (subtypes 1a or 1b), and 20-25 percent have genotypes 2 or 3, with small numbers of patients infected with genotypes 4, 5, or 6 (2). Most patients with HCV are found to have only one principal genotype, rather than multiple genotypes (3-5). Genotype 4 is much more common in Africa than in many other parts of the world, genotype 6 is common in Southeast Asia, and each area of the world has its own distribution of genotypes (6).\n\nGenotype generally has not been found in epidemiological studies to play a large role in liver disease progression due to HCV. Rather, genotype is of clinical importance principally as a factor in response to HCV treatments. With all treatments tested to date, patients with genotypes 2 and 3 are more than twice as likely as patients with genotype 1 to achieve a sustained virological response to therapy (2-5, 7). In addition, when using combination therapy with interferon and ribavirin, patients with genotypes 2 or 3 generally are treated for only 24 weeks, whereas it is recommended that patients infected with genotype 1 receive treatment for 48 weeks.\n\n1.

The patients, most of who live in Utah but some out of state, could have been exposed to a rare strain of hepatitis C, genotype 2b.\n\nHepatitis C is a chronic condition and can lay dormant for up to 25 years and then may cause serious liver problems such as liver failure and eventually death. The possible window for exposure was from June 2013 to November 2014 at Ogden's McKay-Dee hospital.\n\nHepatitis C is a reportable disease, so when the Utah State Health Department received a hepatitis case report in 2014, they started researching its origins, The strain was a rare one that when tracked came up with a match. It led to a nurse who was fired from McKay-Dee hospital. The health department started looking at the Ogden hospital then after they'd ruled out every other possibility in a hepatitis C case they were tracking.\n\nDoctor Angela Dunn with the health department notes that the most common way of getting hepatitis C in the US is \"through IV drug use. And other less common ways are tattoos or piercings from unlicensed parlors or being born to a mother with hepatitis C.\" Anyone who received a blood transfusion prior to 1992 can also be at risk. None of these risk factors were present with the man who tested positive, and that's what led investigators to the ER at McKay-Dee hospital where the man had been admitted.\n\nThe time this patient was in the ER was the same time a nurse who has since been fired was working. The health department asked the hospital to test anyone they knew who had risk factors that could present with hepatitis C. The former nurse was tested and came back positive with hepatitis C- genotype 2b, the same as the initial reported case.\n\nDunn says they \"don't know exactly how it happened in this case but that a concern is that needles could be reused and spread infectious diseases.\"\n\nHepatitis C is transferred in blood-to-blood contact. The former nurse was let go for \"divergence,\" or using what are assumed to be hospital issued drugs or syringes without a prescription. It is possible that needles or syringes were used by the nurse and then re-used for patients, though it is tough to prove how the disease was spread.\n\nThe disease is serious and can spread to others even when symptoms are not present, and that's why it is so important that anyone who was treated in the time frame with certain medications be tested.\n\nAccording to Dunn, hepatitis C \"does not have symptoms usually at the beginning, so it is very important if you were exposed to get tested.\"\n\nNotifications, 4800 of them, were dropped in the mail on Fri 6 Nov 2015. Dunn said it is \"out of an abundance of caution we cast a very broad net.\" She and hospital officials encourage \"anyone who received a letter\" to \"definitely get tested.\" If a test comes back positive, treatments can be administered before a patient gets sick. Dunn says \"there is really good treatment for hepatitis C\" and calls it a \"curable disease.\"\n\n[Byline: Heidi Hatch]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[That the alleged healthcare worker and a patient both have genotype 2b does not definitively link them without analyzing each virus's RNA genome.\n\nBloodborne viruses such as hepatitis B and C and HIV can be transmitted by the contamination of multidose vials with a syringe containing blood harboring the virus. If the viruses are genetically identical, not just the same genotype, this suggests that the patient was injected by a syringe containing the medicine (likely a strong analgesic, such as an opiate, that had been previously contaminated by the healthcare worker's blood).\n\nRegarding the significance of genotypes of HCV, the following is derived from a USA Veterans Administration publication http://www.hepatitis.va.gov/provider/reviews/genotypes.asp#S1X [the comments about response to therapy also relate to the newer anti-HCV modes of therapy]:\n\nAn important variable for all patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) is the \"genotype\" of HCV with which they are infected. This is the strain of the virus to which they were exposed when they were infected, often many years prior to their evaluation, and it is determined by a simple blood test. Genotypes of HCV are genetically distinct groups of the virus that have arisen during its evolution (1). Approximately 75 percent of Americans with HCV have genotype 1 of the virus (subtypes 1a or 1b), and 20-25 percent have genotypes 2 or 3, with small numbers of patients infected with genotypes 4, 5, or 6 (2). Most patients with HCV are found to have only one principal genotype, rather than multiple genotypes (3-5). Genotype 4 is much more common in Africa than in many other parts of the world, genotype 6 is common in Southeast Asia, and each area of the world has its own distribution of genotypes (6).\n\nGenotype generally has not been found in epidemiological studies to play a large role in liver disease progression due to HCV. Rather, genotype is of clinical importance principally as a factor in response to HCV treatments. With all treatments tested to date, patients with genotypes 2 and 3 are more than twice as likely as patients with genotype 1 to achieve a sustained virological response to therapy (2-5, 7). In addition, when using combination therapy with interferon and ribavirin, patients with genotypes 2 or 3 generally are treated for only 24 weeks, whereas it is recommended that patients infected with genotype 1 receive treatment for 48 weeks.\n\n1.

The patients, most of who live in Utah but some out of state, could have been exposed to a rare strain of hepatitis C, genotype 2b.\n\nHepatitis C is a chronic condition and can lay dormant for up to 25 years and then may cause serious liver problems such as liver failure and eventually death. The possible window for exposure was from June 2013 to November 2014 at Ogden's McKay-Dee hospital.\n\nHepatitis C is a reportable disease, so when the Utah State Health Department received a hepatitis case report in 2014, they started researching its origins, The strain was a rare one that when tracked came up with a match. It led to a nurse who was fired from McKay-Dee hospital. The health department started looking at the Ogden hospital then after they'd ruled out every other possibility in a hepatitis C case they were tracking.\n\nDoctor Angela Dunn with the health department notes that the most common way of getting hepatitis C in the US is \"through IV drug use. And other less common ways are tattoos or piercings from unlicensed parlors or being born to a mother with hepatitis C.\" Anyone who received a blood transfusion prior to 1992 can also be at risk. None of these risk factors were present with the man who tested positive, and that's what led investigators to the ER at McKay-Dee hospital where the man had been admitted.\n\nThe time this patient was in the ER was the same time a nurse who has since been fired was working. The health department asked the hospital to test anyone they knew who had risk factors that could present with hepatitis C. The former nurse was tested and came back positive with hepatitis C- genotype 2b, the same as the initial reported case.\n\nDunn says they \"don't know exactly how it happened in this case but that a concern is that needles could be reused and spread infectious diseases.\"\n\nHepatitis C is transferred in blood-to-blood contact. The former nurse was let go for \"divergence,\" or using what are assumed to be hospital issued drugs or syringes without a prescription. It is possible that needles or syringes were used by the nurse and then re-used for patients, though it is tough to prove how the disease was spread.\n\nThe disease is serious and can spread to others even when symptoms are not present, and that's why it is so important that anyone who was treated in the time frame with certain medications be tested.\n\nAccording to Dunn, hepatitis C \"does not have symptoms usually at the beginning, so it is very important if you were exposed to get tested.\"\n\nNotifications, 4800 of them, were dropped in the mail on Fri 6 Nov 2015. Dunn said it is \"out of an abundance of caution we cast a very broad net.\" She and hospital officials encourage \"anyone who received a letter\" to \"definitely get tested.\" If a test comes back positive, treatments can be administered before a patient gets sick. Dunn says \"there is really good treatment for hepatitis C\" and calls it a \"curable disease.\"\n\n[Byline: Heidi Hatch]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[That the alleged healthcare worker and a patient both have genotype 2b does not definitively link them without analyzing each virus's RNA genome.\n\nBloodborne viruses such as hepatitis B and C and HIV can be transmitted by the contamination of multidose vials with a syringe containing blood harboring the virus. If the viruses are genetically identical, not just the same genotype, this suggests that the patient was injected by a syringe containing the medicine (likely a strong analgesic, such as an opiate, that had been previously contaminated by the healthcare worker's blood).\n\nRegarding the significance of genotypes of HCV, the following is derived from a USA Veterans Administration publication http://www.hepatitis.va.gov/provider/reviews/genotypes.asp#S1X [the comments about response to therapy also relate to the newer anti-HCV modes of therapy]:\n\nAn important variable for all patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) is the \"genotype\" of HCV with which they are infected. This is the strain of the virus to which they were exposed when they were infected, often many years prior to their evaluation, and it is determined by a simple blood test. Genotypes of HCV are genetically distinct groups of the virus that have arisen during its evolution (1). Approximately 75 percent of Americans with HCV have genotype 1 of the virus (subtypes 1a or 1b), and 20-25 percent have genotypes 2 or 3, with small numbers of patients infected with genotypes 4, 5, or 6 (2). Most patients with HCV are found to have only one principal genotype, rather than multiple genotypes (3-5). Genotype 4 is much more common in Africa than in many other parts of the world, genotype 6 is common in Southeast Asia, and each area of the world has its own distribution of genotypes (6).\n\nGenotype generally has not been found in epidemiological studies to play a large role in liver disease progression due to HCV. Rather, genotype is of clinical importance principally as a factor in response to HCV treatments. With all treatments tested to date, patients with genotypes 2 and 3 are more than twice as likely as patients with genotype 1 to achieve a sustained virological response to therapy (2-5, 7). In addition, when using combination therapy with interferon and ribavirin, patients with genotypes 2 or 3 generally are treated for only 24 weeks, whereas it is recommended that patients infected with genotype 1 receive treatment for 48 weeks.\n\n1.

Most of those drug users, they note, are people younger than 30 who probably used contaminated syringes.\n\nThe hepatitis C virus, which is the leading cause of liver cancer and was 1st able to be tested for in the 1980s, was mostly contracted by baby boomers from blood transfusions, medical procedures as well as through intravenous drug use. But with education, blood screenings and needle exchange programs, the number of new cases of hepatitis C declined significantly since then. Now, the numbers are climbing as a result of an intravenous drug crisis.\n\n\"Today, the most cases are occurring in people under the age of 30,\" said Kevin Cranston, director of the state Department of Public Health's Bureau of Infectious Diseases. \"The heroin epidemic is resulting in a hepatitis C epidemic in a new generation of injectors.\" Mr. Cranston said for the past few years, over 2000 new cases of hepatitis C have been identified annually in the under-30 age group in Massachusetts. About 200 of those cases are in Worcester County.\n\nJesse Pack, director of prevention and screening at AIDS Project Worcester, said the agency has worked with more than 700 injection drug users over the past 2 years, and half are younger than 30. 10 years ago, APW worked with about 200 IV drug users annually. Most of them were middle-aged. The agency, which provides prevention education, vouchers for new syringes for adults, treatment assistance and testing resources, returns at least 1 positive hepatitis C test result a week. Most positive results are for people younger than 30.\n\nDr. Erik J. Garcia, who treats some IV opioid drug users over age 15 through Community Healthlink, said young people typically start by secretly taking some of their parents' prescribed painkillers that go unnoticed. Some young people also become addicted by using pain medications prescribed to them after a sports injury. Once the prescription drugs are no longer accessible, they turn to heroin, which is cheaper and often more readily available than painkillers purchased on the street, he said.\n\n\"Now you have a situation where a person has transitioned from a gateway drug into an addiction, and to heroin. A progression that ultimately leads to hepatitis C,\" Dr. Garcia said.\n\nDr. Garcia said 90 percent of people who use intravenous drugs have been exposed to hepatitis C. Exposure usually happens within the 1st 12 months of use.\n\nMr. Pack at APW said his agency educates young drug-using clients about HIV and hepatitis C and how to remain uninfected even if they are still using drugs. Free confidential screenings are also offered so that people who are infected can get into treatment sooner, making it much less likely they will infect others. \"But young adults in general don't see these infections as something that could affect them personally,\" he said. Adding comprehensive, age-appropriate substance abuse education in public schools would help young people get a better idea of the risks and consequences, he suggested.\n\nMassachusetts health officials say needle exchange programs implemented here in the early 1990s are key to not seeing a major HIV outbreak like Indiana's.\n\nIn addition to that, they cite statutes enacted in 2006 that decriminalized the possession of syringes and allowed over-the-counter purchase of syringes at pharmacies. The state also began to require communities to have syringe disposal systems, where people can safely dispose of syringes.\n\nIn March, the state public health lab also began automatically testing every blood sample sent there for both HIV and hepatitis C.\n\nOnly 5 communities have needle exchange programs which have to be approved by local officials. Those programs are located in Boston, Cambridge, Provincetown, Northampton and Holyoke. Worcester City Council in the mid-1990s passed an ordinance barring needle exchange programs. Some thought such a program would attract drug users to the city and send the message that drug use was condoned.\n\n\"Unfortunately, what they missed is that's not the message that we'd be giving,\" said Dr. Garcia. \"The message would be: Obviously we care about your health. We care about your life. Just because you suffer from an addiction does not mean you should be exposed to HIV or hepatitis C.\"\n\nIn addition to establishing a needle exchange program in Worcester, Dr. Garcia suggested other means to addressing the heroin and opioid crisis. It can be better stopped at the onset by making the medical system more accountable for the opiates they prescribe. Medical providers, he said, are the source of many of the illegally used drugs, unbeknownst to them. Parents should also be educated about safe and responsible storage of medications so their children don't have access to them. Young people also should be educated about drug use. More programs for addicted youths separate from adults are also needed, he said.\n\nGiven the current crisis in opioid abuse and task forces set up to try to address the problem, the time may have come for Worcester to consider having a needle exchange program. Worcester City Manager Edward M.

Most of those drug users, they note, are people younger than 30 who probably used contaminated syringes.\n\nThe hepatitis C virus, which is the leading cause of liver cancer and was 1st able to be tested for in the 1980s, was mostly contracted by baby boomers from blood transfusions, medical procedures as well as through intravenous drug use. But with education, blood screenings and needle exchange programs, the number of new cases of hepatitis C declined significantly since then. Now, the numbers are climbing as a result of an intravenous drug crisis.\n\n\"Today, the most cases are occurring in people under the age of 30,\" said Kevin Cranston, director of the state Department of Public Health's Bureau of Infectious Diseases. \"The heroin epidemic is resulting in a hepatitis C epidemic in a new generation of injectors.\" Mr. Cranston said for the past few years, over 2000 new cases of hepatitis C have been identified annually in the under-30 age group in Massachusetts. About 200 of those cases are in Worcester County.\n\nJesse Pack, director of prevention and screening at AIDS Project Worcester, said the agency has worked with more than 700 injection drug users over the past 2 years, and half are younger than 30. 10 years ago, APW worked with about 200 IV drug users annually. Most of them were middle-aged. The agency, which provides prevention education, vouchers for new syringes for adults, treatment assistance and testing resources, returns at least 1 positive hepatitis C test result a week. Most positive results are for people younger than 30.\n\nDr. Erik J. Garcia, who treats some IV opioid drug users over age 15 through Community Healthlink, said young people typically start by secretly taking some of their parents' prescribed painkillers that go unnoticed. Some young people also become addicted by using pain medications prescribed to them after a sports injury. Once the prescription drugs are no longer accessible, they turn to heroin, which is cheaper and often more readily available than painkillers purchased on the street, he said.\n\n\"Now you have a situation where a person has transitioned from a gateway drug into an addiction, and to heroin. A progression that ultimately leads to hepatitis C,\" Dr. Garcia said.\n\nDr. Garcia said 90 percent of people who use intravenous drugs have been exposed to hepatitis C. Exposure usually happens within the 1st 12 months of use.\n\nMr. Pack at APW said his agency educates young drug-using clients about HIV and hepatitis C and how to remain uninfected even if they are still using drugs. Free confidential screenings are also offered so that people who are infected can get into treatment sooner, making it much less likely they will infect others. \"But young adults in general don't see these infections as something that could affect them personally,\" he said. Adding comprehensive, age-appropriate substance abuse education in public schools would help young people get a better idea of the risks and consequences, he suggested.\n\nMassachusetts health officials say needle exchange programs implemented here in the early 1990s are key to not seeing a major HIV outbreak like Indiana's.\n\nIn addition to that, they cite statutes enacted in 2006 that decriminalized the possession of syringes and allowed over-the-counter purchase of syringes at pharmacies. The state also began to require communities to have syringe disposal systems, where people can safely dispose of syringes.\n\nIn March, the state public health lab also began automatically testing every blood sample sent there for both HIV and hepatitis C.\n\nOnly 5 communities have needle exchange programs which have to be approved by local officials. Those programs are located in Boston, Cambridge, Provincetown, Northampton and Holyoke. Worcester City Council in the mid-1990s passed an ordinance barring needle exchange programs. Some thought such a program would attract drug users to the city and send the message that drug use was condoned.\n\n\"Unfortunately, what they missed is that's not the message that we'd be giving,\" said Dr. Garcia. \"The message would be: Obviously we care about your health. We care about your life. Just because you suffer from an addiction does not mean you should be exposed to HIV or hepatitis C.\"\n\nIn addition to establishing a needle exchange program in Worcester, Dr. Garcia suggested other means to addressing the heroin and opioid crisis. It can be better stopped at the onset by making the medical system more accountable for the opiates they prescribe. Medical providers, he said, are the source of many of the illegally used drugs, unbeknownst to them. Parents should also be educated about safe and responsible storage of medications so their children don't have access to them. Young people also should be educated about drug use. More programs for addicted youths separate from adults are also needed, he said.\n\nGiven the current crisis in opioid abuse and task forces set up to try to address the problem, the time may have come for Worcester to consider having a needle exchange program. Worcester City Manager Edward M. Augustus Jr., who serves on a task force, said all options are on the table. \"These are complicated issues that will require thoughtful public discussion, but I won't close the door to any potential solutions,\" he said in an email.\n\n[Byline: Elaine Thompson]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@pormedmail.org>\n\n[Most diagnoses of hepatitis C are not finding newly infected patients as almost all are already chronically infected.

Free confidential screenings are also offered so that people who are infected can get into treatment sooner, making it much less likely they will infect others. \"But young adults in general don't see these infections as something that could affect them personally,\" he said. Adding comprehensive, age-appropriate substance abuse education in public schools would help young people get a better idea of the risks and consequences, he suggested.\n\nMassachusetts health officials say needle exchange programs implemented here in the early 1990s are key to not seeing a major HIV outbreak like Indiana's.\n\nIn addition to that, they cite statutes enacted in 2006 that decriminalized the possession of syringes and allowed over-the-counter purchase of syringes at pharmacies. The state also began to require communities to have syringe disposal systems, where people can safely dispose of syringes.\n\nIn March, the state public health lab also began automatically testing every blood sample sent there for both HIV and hepatitis C.\n\nOnly 5 communities have needle exchange programs which have to be approved by local officials. Those programs are located in Boston, Cambridge, Provincetown, Northampton and Holyoke. Worcester City Council in the mid-1990s passed an ordinance barring needle exchange programs. Some thought such a program would attract drug users to the city and send the message that drug use was condoned.\n\n\"Unfortunately, what they missed is that's not the message that we'd be giving,\" said Dr. Garcia. \"The message would be: Obviously we care about your health. We care about your life. Just because you suffer from an addiction does not mean you should be exposed to HIV or hepatitis C.\"\n\nIn addition to establishing a needle exchange program in Worcester, Dr. Garcia suggested other means to addressing the heroin and opioid crisis. It can be better stopped at the onset by making the medical system more accountable for the opiates they prescribe. Medical providers, he said, are the source of many of the illegally used drugs, unbeknownst to them. Parents should also be educated about safe and responsible storage of medications so their children don't have access to them. Young people also should be educated about drug use. More programs for addicted youths separate from adults are also needed, he said.\n\nGiven the current crisis in opioid abuse and task forces set up to try to address the problem, the time may have come for Worcester to consider having a needle exchange program.

Most of those drug users, they note, are people younger than 30 who probably used contaminated syringes.\n\nThe hepatitis C virus, which is the leading cause of liver cancer and was 1st able to be tested for in the 1980s, was mostly contracted by baby boomers from blood transfusions, medical procedures as well as through intravenous drug use. But with education, blood screenings and needle exchange programs, the number of new cases of hepatitis C declined significantly since then. Now, the numbers are climbing as a result of an intravenous drug crisis.\n\n\"Today, the most cases are occurring in people under the age of 30,\" said Kevin Cranston, director of the state Department of Public Health's Bureau of Infectious Diseases. \"The heroin epidemic is resulting in a hepatitis C epidemic in a new generation of injectors.\" Mr. Cranston said for the past few years, over 2000 new cases of hepatitis C have been identified annually in the under-30 age group in Massachusetts. About 200 of those cases are in Worcester County.\n\nJesse Pack, director of prevention and screening at AIDS Project Worcester, said the agency has worked with more than 700 injection drug users over the past 2 years, and half are younger than 30. 10 years ago, APW worked with about 200 IV drug users annually. Most of them were middle-aged. The agency, which provides prevention education, vouchers for new syringes for adults, treatment assistance and testing resources, returns at least 1 positive hepatitis C test result a week. Most positive results are for people younger than 30.\n\nDr. Erik J. Garcia, who treats some IV opioid drug users over age 15 through Community Healthlink, said young people typically start by secretly taking some of their parents' prescribed painkillers that go unnoticed. Some young people also become addicted by using pain medications prescribed to them after a sports injury. Once the prescription drugs are no longer accessible, they turn to heroin, which is cheaper and often more readily available than painkillers purchased on the street, he said.\n\n\"Now you have a situation where a person has transitioned from a gateway drug into an addiction, and to heroin. A progression that ultimately leads to hepatitis C,\" Dr. Garcia said.\n\nDr. Garcia said 90 percent of people who use intravenous drugs have been exposed to hepatitis C. Exposure usually happens within the 1st 12 months of use.\n\nMr. Pack at APW said his agency educates young drug-using clients about HIV and hepatitis C and how to remain uninfected even if they are still using drugs.

Most of those drug users, they note, are people younger than 30 who probably used contaminated syringes.\n\nThe hepatitis C virus, which is the leading cause of liver cancer and was 1st able to be tested for in the 1980s, was mostly contracted by baby boomers from blood transfusions, medical procedures as well as through intravenous drug use. But with education, blood screenings and needle exchange programs, the number of new cases of hepatitis C declined significantly since then. Now, the numbers are climbing as a result of an intravenous drug crisis.\n\n\"Today, the most cases are occurring in people under the age of 30,\" said Kevin Cranston, director of the state Department of Public Health's Bureau of Infectious Diseases. \"The heroin epidemic is resulting in a hepatitis C epidemic in a new generation of injectors.\" Mr. Cranston said for the past few years, over 2000 new cases of hepatitis C have been identified annually in the under-30 age group in Massachusetts. About 200 of those cases are in Worcester County.\n\nJesse Pack, director of prevention and screening at AIDS Project Worcester, said the agency has worked with more than 700 injection drug users over the past 2 years, and half are younger than 30. 10 years ago, APW worked with about 200 IV drug users annually. Most of them were middle-aged. The agency, which provides prevention education, vouchers for new syringes for adults, treatment assistance and testing resources, returns at least 1 positive hepatitis C test result a week. Most positive results are for people younger than 30.\n\nDr. Erik J. Garcia, who treats some IV opioid drug users over age 15 through Community Healthlink, said young people typically start by secretly taking some of their parents' prescribed painkillers that go unnoticed. Some young people also become addicted by using pain medications prescribed to them after a sports injury. Once the prescription drugs are no longer accessible, they turn to heroin, which is cheaper and often more readily available than painkillers purchased on the street, he said.\n\n\"Now you have a situation where a person has transitioned from a gateway drug into an addiction, and to heroin. A progression that ultimately leads to hepatitis C,\" Dr. Garcia said.\n\nDr. Garcia said 90 percent of people who use intravenous drugs have been exposed to hepatitis C. Exposure usually happens within the 1st 12 months of use.\n\nMr. Pack at APW said his agency educates young drug-using clients about HIV and hepatitis C and how to remain uninfected even if they are still using drugs. Free confidential screenings are also offered so that people who are infected can get into treatment sooner, making it much less likely they will infect others. \"But young adults in general don't see these infections as something that could affect them personally,\" he said. Adding comprehensive, age-appropriate substance abuse education in public schools would help young people get a better idea of the risks and consequences, he suggested.\n\nMassachusetts health officials say needle exchange programs implemented here in the early 1990s are key to not seeing a major HIV outbreak like Indiana's.\n\nIn addition to that, they cite statutes enacted in 2006 that decriminalized the possession of syringes and allowed over-the-counter purchase of syringes at pharmacies. The state also began to require communities to have syringe disposal systems, where people can safely dispose of syringes.\n\nIn March, the state public health lab also began automatically testing every blood sample sent there for both HIV and hepatitis C.\n\nOnly 5 communities have needle exchange programs which have to be approved by local officials. Those programs are located in Boston, Cambridge, Provincetown, Northampton and Holyoke. Worcester City Council in the mid-1990s passed an ordinance barring needle exchange programs. Some thought such a program would attract drug users to the city and send the message that drug use was condoned.\n\n\"Unfortunately, what they missed is that's not the message that we'd be giving,\" said Dr. Garcia. \"The message would be: Obviously we care about your health. We care about your life. Just because you suffer from an addiction does not mean you should be exposed to HIV or hepatitis C.\"\n\nIn addition to establishing a needle exchange program in Worcester, Dr. Garcia suggested other means to addressing the heroin and opioid crisis. It can be better stopped at the onset by making the medical system more accountable for the opiates they prescribe. Medical providers, he said, are the source of many of the illegally used drugs, unbeknownst to them. Parents should also be educated about safe and responsible storage of medications so their children don't have access to them. Young people also should be educated about drug use. More programs for addicted youths separate from adults are also needed, he said.\n\nGiven the current crisis in opioid abuse and task forces set up to try to address the problem, the time may have come for Worcester to consider having a needle exchange program. Worcester City Manager Edward M. Augustus Jr., who serves on a task force, said all options are on the table. \"These are complicated issues that will require thoughtful public discussion, but I won't close the door to any potential solutions,\" he said in an email.\n\n[Byline: Elaine Thompson]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@pormedmail.org>\n\n[Most diagnoses of hepatitis C are not finding newly infected patients as almost all are already chronically infected.

Cape public health officials say they are doing a good job of tracking the disease, but they also tied rising infection rates to another epidemic, that of opiate addiction.\n\nAbout 15 to 20 Cape Cod Healthcare patients have been prescribed Sovaldi [generic name sofosbuvir, a drug used for hepatitis C infection, with a high cure rate. It inhibits the RNA polymerase that the hepatitis C virus uses to replicate its RNA. - Mod.LL], the new hepatitis C drug that comes with fewer side effects but a hefty price tag, said Valerie Al-Hachem, manager of the health care organization's infectious disease clinical services. She said Sovaldi costs USD 1000 a pill, USD 93 000 for a course of treatment.\n\n\"Part of it [the increase in HCV recognition] is better surveillance. We're becoming much more diligent in reporting new infections,\" said Max Sandusky, director of prevention and screening services for the AIDS Support Group of Cape Cod. \"But part of it is concentrated areas of infection. It's spreading. Once it gets into the population, it's spreading.\"\n\nIn 2012, the last year for which the state has figures, the hepatitis C rate for 15- to 25-year-olds in Barnstable County was 344.3 cases per 100 000 population -- far higher than the next highest county, Plymouth, which had 194.57 cases per 100 000 population. \"The hepatitis C epidemic is going to far exceed what we saw with HIV,\" Sandusky said. \"It is a public health time bomb.\"\n\nThe 2012 infection rate for 15- to 25-year-olds is the highest it has ever been in Barnstable County.

Cape public health officials say they are doing a good job of tracking the disease, but they also tied rising infection rates to another epidemic, that of opiate addiction.\n\nAbout 15 to 20 Cape Cod Healthcare patients have been prescribed Sovaldi [generic name sofosbuvir, a drug used for hepatitis C infection, with a high cure rate. It inhibits the RNA polymerase that the hepatitis C virus uses to replicate its RNA. - Mod.LL], the new hepatitis C drug that comes with fewer side effects but a hefty price tag, said Valerie Al-Hachem, manager of the health care organization's infectious disease clinical services. She said Sovaldi costs USD 1000 a pill, USD 93 000 for a course of treatment.\n\n\"Part of it [the increase in HCV recognition] is better surveillance. We're becoming much more diligent in reporting new infections,\" said Max Sandusky, director of prevention and screening services for the AIDS Support Group of Cape Cod. \"But part of it is concentrated areas of infection.

Cape public health officials say they are doing a good job of tracking the disease, but they also tied rising infection rates to another epidemic, that of opiate addiction.\n\nAbout 15 to 20 Cape Cod Healthcare patients have been prescribed Sovaldi [generic name sofosbuvir, a drug used for hepatitis C infection, with a high cure rate. It inhibits the RNA polymerase that the hepatitis C virus uses to replicate its RNA. - Mod.LL], the new hepatitis C drug that comes with fewer side effects but a hefty price tag, said Valerie Al-Hachem, manager of the health care organization's infectious disease clinical services. She said Sovaldi costs USD 1000 a pill, USD 93 000 for a course of treatment.\n\n\"Part of it [the increase in HCV recognition] is better surveillance. We're becoming much more diligent in reporting new infections,\" said Max Sandusky, director of prevention and screening services for the AIDS Support Group of Cape Cod. \"But part of it is concentrated areas of infection. It's spreading. Once it gets into the population, it's spreading.\"\n\nIn 2012, the last year for which the state has figures, the hepatitis C rate for 15- to 25-year-olds in Barnstable County was 344.3 cases per 100 000 population -- far higher than the next highest county, Plymouth, which had 194.57 cases per 100 000 population. \"The hepatitis C epidemic is going to far exceed what we saw with HIV,\" Sandusky said. \"It is a public health time bomb.\"\n\nThe 2012 infection rate for 15- to 25-year-olds is the highest it has ever been in Barnstable County. The incidence rate per 100 000 people in that population was 298.05 in 2011 and 154.16 in 2010, or 58 and 30 people. In 2012, reported confirmed cases among 15- to 25-year-olds in Barnstable County numbered 67.\n\nA 2013 report by the Center for Health Law and Policy Innovation of Harvard Law School and the Treatment Access Expansion Project shows particularly high rates of hepatitis C infection among teens and young adults in Falmouth, which Sandusky attributes in part to the Upper Cape presence of treatment centers and halfway houses. A lot of injection drug users stay in the community after they leave treatment, Sandusky said. \"It's a recovery destination,\" said Nate Robertson of Mashpee, who with Sam Tarplin of Falmouth is making a documentary about the opiate epidemic called \"What Happened Here: The Untold Story of Addiction on Cape Cod.\" Many people who are treated on the Upper Cape \"stay around,\" he said. \"Not everybody stays clean.\"\n\nAs recently as 2002 the spike in confirmed chronic hepatitis C rates was among middle-aged people. A state DPH report shows that year the age group with the most cases was people aged 45. By 2012, the age with the highest caseload -- about 700 -- was 25-year-olds.\n\nStatewide there were 5223 cases of confirmed chronic hepatitis C in 2012, a decrease from 5881 in 2011. On Cape Cod there were 245 cases in 2012 and 234 in 2011 among all age groups. The DPH has developed a \"point of care\" document to capture new cases of hepatitis C, Sandusky said. He said the form is completed by the diagnostic organization and includes demographic information on the person who contracted hepatitis C, along with medical history and the type of test used. The result is state officials are missing fewer cases, Sandusky said.\n\n\"Screening is better,\" said Valerie Al-Hachem, manager of infectious disease clinical services at Cape Cod Healthcare. \"But the injection practices are more prevalent here on the Cape.\"\n\nDespite awareness campaigns, \"there's still a lot of shared needles going on,\" said Robertson, who is a recovering heroin addict. He said people who are using drugs aren't thinking about taking care of their health. Drug users typically delay getting tested for the liver-damaging disease until they are in recovery or in jail, Robertson said.\n\nSandusky said his organization started a pilot project to do rapid testing of high-risk people in August [2013]. A finger prick test tells within 20 minutes whether a person has developed antibodies to hepatitis C, showing that they were infected at some point, Sandusky said.\n\nThe rapid testing is being done at the Barnstable County Correctional Facility and among high-risk people in the general population, Sandusky added.\n\nBetween 28 Aug 2013 and 31 Mar 2014, the AIDS Support Group of Cape Cod tested 102 people, 70 of whom identified themselves as injection drug users, he said. Of those getting the finger prick, 25 -- or 24 percent -- tested positive, Sandusky said. He said that is a very high infection rate. \"Most of the folks we have tested are under the age of 30,\" Sandusky said. \"We are definitely focusing on the younger population because we are seeing increases in substance abuse among youth.\"\n\n[Byline: Cynthia McCormick]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Without longitudinal studies of a cohort, it is not clear over what period of time the HCV infections were acquired as, in most individuals, chronic infection develops.

Once it gets into the population, it's spreading.\"\n\nIn 2012, the last year for which the state has figures, the hepatitis C rate for 15- to 25-year-olds in Barnstable County was 344.3 cases per 100 000 population -- far higher than the next highest county, Plymouth, which had 194.57 cases per 100 000 population. \"The hepatitis C epidemic is going to far exceed what we saw with HIV,\" Sandusky said. \"It is a public health time bomb.\"\n\nThe 2012 infection rate for 15- to 25-year-olds is the highest it has ever been in Barnstable County. The incidence rate per 100 000 people in that population was 298.05 in 2011 and 154.16 in 2010, or 58 and 30 people. In 2012, reported confirmed cases among 15- to 25-year-olds in Barnstable County numbered 67.\n\nA 2013 report by the Center for Health Law and Policy Innovation of Harvard Law School and the Treatment Access Expansion Project shows particularly high rates of hepatitis C infection among teens and young adults in Falmouth, which Sandusky attributes in part to the Upper Cape presence of treatment centers and halfway houses. A lot of injection drug users stay in the community after they leave treatment, Sandusky said. \"It's a recovery destination,\" said Nate Robertson of Mashpee, who with Sam Tarplin of Falmouth is making a documentary about the opiate epidemic called \"What Happened Here: The Untold Story of Addiction on Cape Cod.\" Many people who are treated on the Upper Cape \"stay around,\" he said. \"Not everybody stays clean.\"\n\nAs recently as 2002 the spike in confirmed chronic hepatitis C rates was among middle-aged people. A state DPH report shows that year the age group with the most cases was people aged 45. By 2012, the age with the highest caseload -- about 700 -- was 25-year-olds.\n\nStatewide there were 5223 cases of confirmed chronic hepatitis C in 2012, a decrease from 5881 in 2011. On Cape Cod there were 245 cases in 2012 and 234 in 2011 among all age groups. The DPH has developed a \"point of care\" document to capture new cases of hepatitis C, Sandusky said. He said the form is completed by the diagnostic organization and includes demographic information on the person who contracted hepatitis C, along with medical history and the type of test used. The result is state officials are missing fewer cases, Sandusky said.\n\n\"Screening is better,\" said Valerie Al-Hachem, manager of infectious disease clinical services at Cape Cod Healthcare. \"But the injection practices are more prevalent here on the Cape.\"\n\nDespite awareness campaigns, \"there's still a lot of shared needles going on,\" said Robertson, who is a recovering heroin addict. He said people who are using drugs aren't thinking about taking care of their health. Drug users typically delay getting tested for the liver-damaging disease until they are in recovery or in jail, Robertson said.\n\nSandusky said his organization started a pilot project to do rapid testing of high-risk people in August [2013]. A finger prick test tells within 20 minutes whether a person has developed antibodies to hepatitis C, showing that they were infected at some point, Sandusky said.\n\nThe rapid testing is being done at the Barnstable County Correctional Facility and among high-risk people in the general population, Sandusky added.\n\nBetween 28 Aug 2013 and 31 Mar 2014, the AIDS Support Group of Cape Cod tested 102 people, 70 of whom identified themselves as injection drug users, he said. Of those getting the finger prick, 25 -- or 24 percent -- tested positive, Sandusky said. He said that is a very high infection rate. \"Most of the folks we have tested are under the age of 30,\" Sandusky said. \"We are definitely focusing on the younger population because we are seeing increases in substance abuse among youth.\"\n\n[Byline: Cynthia McCormick]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Without longitudinal studies of a cohort, it is not clear over what period of time the HCV infections were acquired as, in most individuals, chronic infection develops.

The treatment regimens for HCV can also diminish transmission by clearing the viremia and we are about the enter a time with therapy without interferon and even ribavirin, both of which have therapy-limiting side effects and have disappointing results with certain genotypes of the virus. - Mod.LL\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/17741.]\nSee Also\nHepatitis B & C, HIV - USA: (NY) possible insulin syringe exposure 20140314.2330501\nHepatitis C - USA (02): (MN) 20140306.2317087\nHepatitis C - USA: (CO) nosocomial, 2011-2012, RFI 20140101.2146381\n2013\n----\nHepatitis C - USA (06): (WY) increasing incidence 20131126.2076471\nHepatitis C - USA (05): New York City, correction 20131118.2061773\nHepatitis C - USA (05): New York City, increasing incidence 20131113.2053830\nHepatitis C - USA (04): (ND), acute 20131020.2011334\nHepatitis B & C, HIV - USA (05): (OK) possible dental exposure 20130920.1958804\nHepatitis B & C, HIV - USA (04): (OK) possible dental exposure 20130607.1760955\nHepatitis C - USA (03): (NH) nosocomial 20130607.1760734\nHepatitis B & C, HIV - USA (03): (OK) possible dental exposure 20130504.1691297\nHepatitis B & C, HIV - USA (02): (OK) possible dental exposure 20130420.1660335\nHepatitis C - USA (02): (OH) increased incidence in Ross county 20130330.1611310\nHepatitis B & C, HIV - USA: (OK), possible dental exposure, alert 20130329.1609886\n.................................................sb/ll/mj/lm", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "hepatitis b", "hepatitis c"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2012-03-16 00:00:00", "2012-03-16 00:00:00", "2011-03-16 00:00:00", "2010-03-16 00:00:00", "2012-03-16 00:00:00", "2013-03-16 00:00:00", "2002-03-16 00:00:00", "2045-03-16 00:00:00", "2012-03-16 00:00:00", "5223-03-16 00:00:00", "2012-03-16 00:00:00", "5881-03-16 00:00:00", "2011-03-16 00:00:00", "2012-03-16 00:00:00", "2011-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-08-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-31 00:00:00", "2014-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-06 00:00:00", "2021-03-05 00:00:00", "2021-03-05 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2021-03-05 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "WY", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Ross county 20130330.1611310", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Cape Cod", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Massachusetts", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Plymouth", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "New York City", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Barnstable County", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "LL", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "2362793", "headline": "PRO/EDR> Hepatitis C - India (05): (JK) hemophiliacs, commentary", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=2362793", "date": "2014-01-01 14:13:45", "main_text": "HEPATITIS C - USA: (CO) NOSOCOMIAL, 2011-2012, REQUEST FOR INFORMATION\n***********************************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Mon 30 Dec 2013\nSource: Fox31 Denver [edited]\nhttp://kdvr.com/2013/12/30/210-fort-collins-patients-may-have-been-exposed-to-hepatitis-c/\n\n\nThough administrators stressed that the notifications were only precautionary, the Poudre Valley Hospital (PVH) confirmed that letters have been mailed to 210 adult patients who may have been exposed to hepatitis C.

They are based on data from 8434 Canadians aged 14 to 79. The study, published Wednesday [20 Nov 2013] by Statistics Canada, found 0.4 per cent of people surveyed were infected with hepatitis B and 0.5 per cent were infected with hepatitis C. Half of the people with hepatitis B said they were unaware of the infection; 70 per cent of the people with hepatitis C said they did not know they were infected.\n\nExperts have been warning that Canada is facing an unrecognized health care crisis with hepatitis C, because undetected and untreated infections in the baby boom generation will trigger a surge in cases of liver failure and liver cancer. The chairman of the board of the Canadian Liver Foundation suggests the new estimates are actually unhelpful, because they give a falsely reassuring sense of the scope of the problem. \"I think they're actually harmful, and counterproductive. Because I think it's minimizing the true state of affairs,\" said Dr Morris Sherman, a hepatologist (liver specialist) at Toronto General Hospital. The survey estimates 138 600 Canadians have hepatitis C. But Statistic Canada's own website reports that the number of diagnosed cases of hepatitis C in the country -- it is a reportable disease -- is nearly 300 000, Sherman notes. The Canadian Health Measures Survey is designed to test a representative sample of Canadians for a range of different conditions -- things like high blood pressure, diabetes and obesity. It does not include 1st nations people living on reserves, prison inmates, members of the Armed Forces or people living in some remote regions.\n\nTo get a good idea of the scale of the hepatitis B and C problems, the survey would need strong representation from certain population groups that typically don't agree to take part in this kind of a study, says Dr Mel Krajden, a hepatitis C expert with the British Columbia (BC) Centre for Disease Control. Those groups include injection drug users, the homeless, 1st nations people, prison inmates and immigrants from parts of the world where hepatitis B and C infections are more common than they are in Canada. Those include South Asia, China and Eastern Europe.\n\n\"The study wasn't designed to specifically understand the epidemiology of [hepatitis] B and C. Unless you sample these populations correctly, you may not accurately estimate what's going on,\" Krajden says. He notes it is typically extremely hard to accurately sample these groups. In particular, immigrants from some parts of the world where rates of these infections are high may be distrustful of this type of study and refuse to take part, he says. Krajden says British Columbia knows the hepatitis C status of about one quarter of its population, because a lot of testing has been done there. About 1.4 per cent of the province's total population is hepatitis C positive; among baby boomers, where the risk is greatest, the rate is 3 per cent, he says. Krajden says BC rates may be higher than other provinces, because there are higher rates of injection drug users there. While he called the new data \"a step in the right direction,\" he too believes the estimates in this new report are artificially low.\n\nIn related news Wednesday [20 Nov 2013], Janssen Inc. announced that Health Canada has approved its new hepatitis C drug Galexos (its generic name is simeprevir). Doctors who treat people with hepatitis C have been anxiously awaiting approval of this and another pending new drug as they are expected to be significantly easier for patients to take and should have a higher success rate. But the new drugs are expected to be very costly, and experts worry that may slow their adoption.\n\n[byline: Helen Branswell]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Hepatitis B is a potentially life-threatening liver infection caused by the hepatitis B virus. It is a major global health problem. It can cause chronic liver disease and chronic infection and puts people at high risk of death from cirrhosis of the liver and liver cancer. An effective vaccine against hepatitis B has been available since 1982. Hepatitis B vaccine is 95 per cent effective in preventing infection and its chronic consequences, and was the 1st vaccine against a major human cancer.\n\nHepatitis C is a contagious liver disease that results from infection with hepatitis C virus. It can range in severity from a mild illness lasting a few weeks to a serious, lifelong illness. Hepatitis C virus is usually spread when blood from an infected person enters the body of a susceptible person. It is among the commonest viruses that infect the liver. About 150 million people are chronically infected and at risk of developing liver cirrhosis and/or liver cancer, and the numbers are increasing. Hepatitis C is found worldwide with some countries having chronic infection rates as high as 5 per cent and above. The main mode of transmission in these countries is attributed to unsafe injections using contaminated equipment. No vaccines are available to provide protection, but effective (but expensive) treatments are becoming available (as reported in the above press report). There are at least 6 genotypes of hepatitis C virus, and they may respond differently to treatment.

They are based on data from 8434 Canadians aged 14 to 79. The study, published Wednesday [20 Nov 2013] by Statistics Canada, found 0.4 per cent of people surveyed were infected with hepatitis B and 0.5 per cent were infected with hepatitis C. Half of the people with hepatitis B said they were unaware of the infection; 70 per cent of the people with hepatitis C said they did not know they were infected.\n\nExperts have been warning that Canada is facing an unrecognized health care crisis with hepatitis C, because undetected and untreated infections in the baby boom generation will trigger a surge in cases of liver failure and liver cancer. The chairman of the board of the Canadian Liver Foundation suggests the new estimates are actually unhelpful, because they give a falsely reassuring sense of the scope of the problem. \"I think they're actually harmful, and counterproductive. Because I think it's minimizing the true state of affairs,\" said Dr Morris Sherman, a hepatologist (liver specialist) at Toronto General Hospital. The survey estimates 138 600 Canadians have hepatitis C. But Statistic Canada's own website reports that the number of diagnosed cases of hepatitis C in the country -- it is a reportable disease -- is nearly 300 000, Sherman notes. The Canadian Health Measures Survey is designed to test a representative sample of Canadians for a range of different conditions -- things like high blood pressure, diabetes and obesity. It does not include 1st nations people living on reserves, prison inmates, members of the Armed Forces or people living in some remote regions.\n\nTo get a good idea of the scale of the hepatitis B and C problems, the survey would need strong representation from certain population groups that typically don't agree to take part in this kind of a study, says Dr Mel Krajden, a hepatitis C expert with the British Columbia (BC) Centre for Disease Control. Those groups include injection drug users, the homeless, 1st nations people, prison inmates and immigrants from parts of the world where hepatitis B and C infections are more common than they are in Canada. Those include South Asia, China and Eastern Europe.\n\n\"The study wasn't designed to specifically understand the epidemiology of [hepatitis] B and C. Unless you sample these populations correctly, you may not accurately estimate what's going on,\" Krajden says. He notes it is typically extremely hard to accurately sample these groups. In particular, immigrants from some parts of the world where rates of these infections are high may be distrustful of this type of study and refuse to take part, he says. Krajden says British Columbia knows the hepatitis C status of about one quarter of its population, because a lot of testing has been done there. About 1.4 per cent of the province's total population is hepatitis C positive; among baby boomers, where the risk is greatest, the rate is 3 per cent, he says. Krajden says BC rates may be higher than other provinces, because there are higher rates of injection drug users there. While he called the new data \"a step in the right direction,\" he too believes the estimates in this new report are artificially low.\n\nIn related news Wednesday [20 Nov 2013], Janssen Inc. announced that Health Canada has approved its new hepatitis C drug Galexos (its generic name is simeprevir). Doctors who treat people with hepatitis C have been anxiously awaiting approval of this and another pending new drug as they are expected to be significantly easier for patients to take and should have a higher success rate. But the new drugs are expected to be very costly, and experts worry that may slow their adoption.\n\n[byline: Helen Branswell]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Hepatitis B is a potentially life-threatening liver infection caused by the hepatitis B virus. It is a major global health problem. It can cause chronic liver disease and chronic infection and puts people at high risk of death from cirrhosis of the liver and liver cancer. An effective vaccine against hepatitis B has been available since 1982. Hepatitis B vaccine is 95 per cent effective in preventing infection and its chronic consequences, and was the 1st vaccine against a major human cancer.\n\nHepatitis C is a contagious liver disease that results from infection with hepatitis C virus. It can range in severity from a mild illness lasting a few weeks to a serious, lifelong illness. Hepatitis C virus is usually spread when blood from an infected person enters the body of a susceptible person. It is among the commonest viruses that infect the liver. About 150 million people are chronically infected and at risk of developing liver cirrhosis and/or liver cancer, and the numbers are increasing. Hepatitis C is found worldwide with some countries having chronic infection rates as high as 5 per cent and above. The main mode of transmission in these countries is attributed to unsafe injections using contaminated equipment. No vaccines are available to provide protection, but effective (but expensive) treatments are becoming available (as reported in the above press report). There are at least 6 genotypes of hepatitis C virus, and they may respond differently to treatment. Careful screening is necessary before starting the treatment to determine the most appropriate approach for the patient. Previously, combination antiviral therapy with interferon and the drug ribavirin has been the basis of hepatitis C treatment.

But Statistic Canada's own website reports that the number of diagnosed cases of hepatitis C in the country -- it is a reportable disease -- is nearly 300 000, Sherman notes. The Canadian Health Measures Survey is designed to test a representative sample of Canadians for a range of different conditions -- things like high blood pressure, diabetes and obesity. It does not include 1st nations people living on reserves, prison inmates, members of the Armed Forces or people living in some remote regions.\n\nTo get a good idea of the scale of the hepatitis B and C problems, the survey would need strong representation from certain population groups that typically don't agree to take part in this kind of a study, says Dr Mel Krajden, a hepatitis C expert with the British Columbia (BC) Centre for Disease Control. Those groups include injection drug users, the homeless, 1st nations people, prison inmates and immigrants from parts of the world where hepatitis B and C infections are more common than they are in Canada. Those include South Asia, China and Eastern Europe.\n\n\"The study wasn't designed to specifically understand the epidemiology of [hepatitis] B and C. Unless you sample these populations correctly, you may not accurately estimate what's going on,\" Krajden says. He notes it is typically extremely hard to accurately sample these groups. In particular, immigrants from some parts of the world where rates of these infections are high may be distrustful of this type of study and refuse to take part, he says. Krajden says British Columbia knows the hepatitis C status of about one quarter of its population, because a lot of testing has been done there. About 1.4 per cent of the province's total population is hepatitis C positive; among baby boomers, where the risk is greatest, the rate is 3 per cent, he says. Krajden says BC rates may be higher than other provinces, because there are higher rates of injection drug users there. While he called the new data \"a step in the right direction,\" he too believes the estimates in this new report are artificially low.\n\nIn related news Wednesday [20 Nov 2013], Janssen Inc. announced that Health Canada has approved its new hepatitis C drug Galexos (its generic name is simeprevir). Doctors who treat people with hepatitis C have been anxiously awaiting approval of this and another pending new drug as they are expected to be significantly easier for patients to take and should have a higher success rate.

They are based on data from 8434 Canadians aged 14 to 79. The study, published Wednesday [20 Nov 2013] by Statistics Canada, found 0.4 per cent of people surveyed were infected with hepatitis B and 0.5 per cent were infected with hepatitis C. Half of the people with hepatitis B said they were unaware of the infection; 70 per cent of the people with hepatitis C said they did not know they were infected.\n\nExperts have been warning that Canada is facing an unrecognized health care crisis with hepatitis C, because undetected and untreated infections in the baby boom generation will trigger a surge in cases of liver failure and liver cancer. The chairman of the board of the Canadian Liver Foundation suggests the new estimates are actually unhelpful, because they give a falsely reassuring sense of the scope of the problem. \"I think they're actually harmful, and counterproductive. Because I think it's minimizing the true state of affairs,\" said Dr Morris Sherman, a hepatologist (liver specialist) at Toronto General Hospital. The survey estimates 138 600 Canadians have hepatitis C. But Statistic Canada's own website reports that the number of diagnosed cases of hepatitis C in the country -- it is a reportable disease -- is nearly 300 000, Sherman notes. The Canadian Health Measures Survey is designed to test a representative sample of Canadians for a range of different conditions -- things like high blood pressure, diabetes and obesity. It does not include 1st nations people living on reserves, prison inmates, members of the Armed Forces or people living in some remote regions.\n\nTo get a good idea of the scale of the hepatitis B and C problems, the survey would need strong representation from certain population groups that typically don't agree to take part in this kind of a study, says Dr Mel Krajden, a hepatitis C expert with the British Columbia (BC) Centre for Disease Control. Those groups include injection drug users, the homeless, 1st nations people, prison inmates and immigrants from parts of the world where hepatitis B and C infections are more common than they are in Canada. Those include South Asia, China and Eastern Europe.\n\n\"The study wasn't designed to specifically understand the epidemiology of [hepatitis] B and C. Unless you sample these populations correctly, you may not accurately estimate what's going on,\" Krajden says. He notes it is typically extremely hard to accurately sample these groups. In particular, immigrants from some parts of the world where rates of these infections are high may be distrustful of this type of study and refuse to take part, he says. Krajden says British Columbia knows the hepatitis C status of about one quarter of its population, because a lot of testing has been done there. About 1.4 per cent of the province's total population is hepatitis C positive; among baby boomers, where the risk is greatest, the rate is 3 per cent, he says. Krajden says BC rates may be higher than other provinces, because there are higher rates of injection drug users there. While he called the new data \"a step in the right direction,\" he too believes the estimates in this new report are artificially low.\n\nIn related news Wednesday [20 Nov 2013], Janssen Inc. announced that Health Canada has approved its new hepatitis C drug Galexos (its generic name is simeprevir). Doctors who treat people with hepatitis C have been anxiously awaiting approval of this and another pending new drug as they are expected to be significantly easier for patients to take and should have a higher success rate. But the new drugs are expected to be very costly, and experts worry that may slow their adoption.\n\n[byline: Helen Branswell]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Hepatitis B is a potentially life-threatening liver infection caused by the hepatitis B virus. It is a major global health problem. It can cause chronic liver disease and chronic infection and puts people at high risk of death from cirrhosis of the liver and liver cancer. An effective vaccine against hepatitis B has been available since 1982. Hepatitis B vaccine is 95 per cent effective in preventing infection and its chronic consequences, and was the 1st vaccine against a major human cancer.\n\nHepatitis C is a contagious liver disease that results from infection with hepatitis C virus. It can range in severity from a mild illness lasting a few weeks to a serious, lifelong illness. Hepatitis C virus is usually spread when blood from an infected person enters the body of a susceptible person. It is among the commonest viruses that infect the liver. About 150 million people are chronically infected and at risk of developing liver cirrhosis and/or liver cancer, and the numbers are increasing. Hepatitis C is found worldwide with some countries having chronic infection rates as high as 5 per cent and above. The main mode of transmission in these countries is attributed to unsafe injections using contaminated equipment. No vaccines are available to provide protection, but effective (but expensive) treatments are becoming available (as reported in the above press report).

Hepatitis C cases are rising among ACT [Australian Capital Territory] jail inmates as prison guards remain opposed to a new push to start a needle-exchange program at Alexander Maconochie Centre. It has been almost 10 months since Chief Minister Katy Gallagher announced an Australian-first needle exchange at the prison as part of a plan to curb blood-borne disease. The issue, discussed in various forms since the jail's inception, has faced strident opposition from guards, who say it is unworkable and would jeopardise their safety.\n\nThe model would see inmates swap dirty needles for clean needles using safety containers, in a one-for-one exchange overseen by prison medical staff. Guards and prison workers have 6 weeks to respond to the plan, with ongoing consultation and \"focus group\" sessions offered in the meantime. Government officials said they left the meeting with \"no doubt\" that further changes were needed to win the support of the guards.\n\nBut as the protracted negotiations continue, more inmates have tested positive to hepatitis C. 2 new inmates are known to have acquired the disease inside the jail since March last year [2012], although that number may be higher due to the difficulty in determining \"in-custody transmissions\". There are a further 18 cases where the disease may have been transmitted inside the jail, but where \"in-community transmission\" has not been ruled out.\n\nThe Health Directorate said that developing the needle exchange was a \"complex and sensitive process\", and that it needed time to work through the range of issues associated with putting the proposal into a practical form. Health Directorate deputy director-general Stephen Goggs said there was a strong turnout at the meeting, and \"frank and forthright participation\" by guards. \"It's fair to say that there is still a high level of concern from custodial officers. They're concerned obviously that any needles in the AMC pose a safety risk to them,\" Mr Goggs said. \"They're also concerned that almost no model reduces the opportunity for detainees to share needles, so that's something we still need to work through. \"I think we've still got quite a way to go, but they came up with very constructive and direct feedback.\"\n\nThe Community and Public Sector Union, which represents ACT prison guards, has maintained its opposition to the needle exchange plan since reacting angrily to the surprise announcement last year [2012]. Union regional director Vince McDevitt said initial reports from Monday's [3 Jun 2013] meeting suggested a number of \"problematic issues\" had not been addressed in the detailed model given to guards. \"We will be meeting with our members and consolidating our collective response to the revised proposal next month [June 2013],\" he said.\n\nMr McDevitt said the AMC was not the right place to trial a needle exchange, due to its layout, the difficulties in maintaining anonymity of heroin users, and the mixture of a broad range of prisoner types. The union took the issue to Fair Work Australia last August [2012], saying the government had breached a clause in the guards' enterprise agreement by failing to properly consult with them. That clause states \"no needle exchange program ... shall be implemented without prior consultation and agreement by the directorate and union[s]\".\n\nThe Health Directorate said it would be open to guards raising the issue of retaining that clause in the current enterprise agreement bargaining negotiations.\n\n[Byline: Christopher Knaus)\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Hepatitis C is a contagious liver disease that results from infection with hepatitis C virus. It can range in severity from a mild illness lasting a few weeks to a serious, lifelong illness. Hepatitis C virus is usually spread when blood from an infected person enters the body of a susceptible person. It is among the most common viruses that infect the liver. Hepatitis C virus is most commonly transmitted through exposure to infectious blood. This can occur through receipt of contaminated blood transfusions, blood products, and organ transplants; injections given with contaminated syringes and needle-stick injuries in health-care settings; injection drug use; being born to a hepatitis C-infected mother. Hepatitis C may be transmitted through sex with an infected person or sharing of personal items contaminated with infectious blood, but these are less common. Hepatitis C is not spread through breast milk, food, or water or by casual contact such as hugging, kissing, and sharing food or drinks with an infected person.\n\nHepatitis C does not always require treatment. There are 6 genotypes of hepatitis C and they may respond differently to treatment. Combination antiviral therapy with interferon and ribavirin has been the mainstay of hepatitis C treatment. Scientific advances have led to the development of new antiviral drugs for hepatitis C, which may be more effective and better tolerated than existing therapies. Recently 2 new therapeutic agents telaprevir and boceprevir have been licensed in some countries. Much needs to be done to ensure that these advances lead to greater access and treatment globally (see http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs164/en/index.html).\n\nIn view of the advancements in treatment of hepatitis C virus infection, it would seem more important to identify the prisoners with hepatitis C and offer specific treatment, rather than to introduce a needle-exchange programme that would be difficult to implement and might endanger the prison staff administering the scheme. One can easily understand the concern of the prison guards. It seems an ill-considered initiative. - Mod.CP\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/r/79z1.]\nSee Also\n2012\n----\nHepatitis B & C - Australia (02): liver cancer increase, vaccination 20120912.1291534\nHepatitis B & C - Australia: liver cancer increase 20120910.1288861\n.................................................sb/cp/mj/dk", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "hepatitis b", "hepatitis c"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2021-03-22 00:00:00", "2013-06-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00"], "locations": []}]}, {"archive_id": "1830676", "headline": "PRO> Hepatitis C - Australia (02): (AC) prison needle-exchange proposal, comment", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=1830676", "date": "2013-06-04 16:29:33", "main_text": "HEPATITIS C - AUSTRALIA: (AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY) PRISON NEEDLE-EXCHANGE PROPOSAL\n***************************************************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Tue 4 Jun 2013\nFrom: The Canberra Times, ACT News [edited]\nhttp://www.canberratimes.com.au/act-news/officers-dig-in-as-hepatitis-cases-rise-20130603-2nmhv.html\n\n\nNew cases of hepatitis C have been reported at Alexander Maconochie Centre [AMC].

It can range in severity from a mild illness lasting a few weeks to a serious, lifelong illness. Hepatitis C virus is usually spread when blood from an infected person enters the body of a susceptible person. It is among the most common viruses that infect the liver. Hepatitis C virus is most commonly transmitted through exposure to infectious blood. This can occur through receipt of contaminated blood transfusions, blood products, and organ transplants; injections given with contaminated syringes and needle-stick injuries in health-care settings; injection drug use; being born to a hepatitis C-infected mother. Hepatitis C may be transmitted through sex with an infected person or sharing of personal items contaminated with infectious blood, but these are less common. Hepatitis C is not spread through breast milk, food, or water or by casual contact such as hugging, kissing, and sharing food or drinks with an infected person.\n\nHepatitis C does not always require treatment. There are 6 genotypes of hepatitis C and they may respond differently to treatment. Combination antiviral therapy with interferon and ribavirin has been the mainstay of hepatitis C treatment. Scientific advances have led to the development of new antiviral drugs for hepatitis C, which may be more effective and better tolerated than existing therapies. Recently 2 new therapeutic agents telaprevir and boceprevir have been licensed in some countries. Much needs to be done to ensure that these advances lead to greater access and treatment globally (see http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs164/en/index.html).\n\nIn view of the advancements in treatment of hepatitis C virus infection, it would seem more important to identify the prisoners with hepatitis C and offer specific treatment, rather than to introduce a needle-exchange programme that would be difficult to implement and might endanger the prison staff administering the scheme.

Hepatitis C cases are rising among ACT [Australian Capital Territory] jail inmates as prison guards remain opposed to a new push to start a needle-exchange program at Alexander Maconochie Centre. It has been almost 10 months since Chief Minister Katy Gallagher announced an Australian-first needle exchange at the prison as part of a plan to curb blood-borne disease. The issue, discussed in various forms since the jail's inception, has faced strident opposition from guards, who say it is unworkable and would jeopardise their safety.\n\nThe model would see inmates swap dirty needles for clean needles using safety containers, in a one-for-one exchange overseen by prison medical staff. Guards and prison workers have 6 weeks to respond to the plan, with ongoing consultation and \"focus group\" sessions offered in the meantime. Government officials said they left the meeting with \"no doubt\" that further changes were needed to win the support of the guards.\n\nBut as the protracted negotiations continue, more inmates have tested positive to hepatitis C. 2 new inmates are known to have acquired the disease inside the jail since March last year [2012], although that number may be higher due to the difficulty in determining \"in-custody transmissions\". There are a further 18 cases where the disease may have been transmitted inside the jail, but where \"in-community transmission\" has not been ruled out.\n\nThe Health Directorate said that developing the needle exchange was a \"complex and sensitive process\", and that it needed time to work through the range of issues associated with putting the proposal into a practical form. Health Directorate deputy director-general Stephen Goggs said there was a strong turnout at the meeting, and \"frank and forthright participation\" by guards. \"It's fair to say that there is still a high level of concern from custodial officers. They're concerned obviously that any needles in the AMC pose a safety risk to them,\" Mr Goggs said. \"They're also concerned that almost no model reduces the opportunity for detainees to share needles, so that's something we still need to work through. \"I think we've still got quite a way to go, but they came up with very constructive and direct feedback.\"\n\nThe Community and Public Sector Union, which represents ACT prison guards, has maintained its opposition to the needle exchange plan since reacting angrily to the surprise announcement last year [2012]. Union regional director Vince McDevitt said initial reports from Monday's [3 Jun 2013] meeting suggested a number of \"problematic issues\" had not been addressed in the detailed model given to guards. \"We will be meeting with our members and consolidating our collective response to the revised proposal next month [June 2013],\" he said.\n\nMr McDevitt said the AMC was not the right place to trial a needle exchange, due to its layout, the difficulties in maintaining anonymity of heroin users, and the mixture of a broad range of prisoner types. The union took the issue to Fair Work Australia last August [2012], saying the government had breached a clause in the guards' enterprise agreement by failing to properly consult with them. That clause states \"no needle exchange program ... shall be implemented without prior consultation and agreement by the directorate and union[s]\".\n\nThe Health Directorate said it would be open to guards raising the issue of retaining that clause in the current enterprise agreement bargaining negotiations.\n\n[Byline: Christopher Knaus)\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Hepatitis C is a contagious liver disease that results from infection with hepatitis C virus. It can range in severity from a mild illness lasting a few weeks to a serious, lifelong illness. Hepatitis C virus is usually spread when blood from an infected person enters the body of a susceptible person. It is among the most common viruses that infect the liver. Hepatitis C virus is most commonly transmitted through exposure to infectious blood. This can occur through receipt of contaminated blood transfusions, blood products, and organ transplants; injections given with contaminated syringes and needle-stick injuries in health-care settings; injection drug use; being born to a hepatitis C-infected mother. Hepatitis C may be transmitted through sex with an infected person or sharing of personal items contaminated with infectious blood, but these are less common. Hepatitis C is not spread through breast milk, food, or water or by casual contact such as hugging, kissing, and sharing food or drinks with an infected person.\n\nHepatitis C does not always require treatment. There are 6 genotypes of hepatitis C and they may respond differently to treatment. Combination antiviral therapy with interferon and ribavirin has been the mainstay of hepatitis C treatment. Scientific advances have led to the development of new antiviral drugs for hepatitis C, which may be more effective and better tolerated than existing therapies. Recently 2 new therapeutic agents telaprevir and boceprevir have been licensed in some countries.

Only 10 percent to 20 percent of hepatitis cases are detected, said Rino Gani, head of the Indonesia Liver Research Association (PPHI). \"Not everyone knows about the status of their infection and not everyone has had themselves examined,\" Rino said at a news conference ahead of World Hepatitis Day on 28 Jul 2012. Hepatitis takes a long time to show symptoms, but the disease can cause liver cirrhosis and cancer, Rino said. \"The damage only becomes known when it is already too late and not much can be done,\" Rino said. One of the problems is money, Rino said. Tests and treatment are only affordable for a small segment of society. Another is stigma. People who know they are infected often do not seek out treatment because they do not want people to know about their condition. Since the disease does not cause them pain, they are able to ignore it.\n\nAccording to H.M. Subuh, a director at the Health Ministry, rapid detection tests cost between Rp 30 000 [USD 3.18] and Rp 50 000 [5.29], and more sophisticated tests cost Rp 100 000 to Rp 150 000. [One USD approximates to 9445 Indonesian Rupiah]. \"The problem is that after someone is declared hepatitis B or C positive, another series of tests have to be undergone and the costs is about Rp 2 million [USD 211.75] and has to be done repeatedly before being eligible for therapy\" which can cost tens or hundreds of millions of rupiah, he said. The government's Jamkesmas health insurance scheme covers treatment for poor people, he added. Rino said an alternative to expensive therapies was needed. He praised a partnership between the University of Indonesia and the University of Kobe in Japan to develop an herbal-based cure for hepatitis C.\n\nA 2007 Health Ministry study found that 9.4 percent of Indonesians, or about 30 million people, were positive for hepatitis B or C. Globally, 170 million people are infected, and the disease[s] causes 1.5 million deaths annually. Several groups are especially vulnerable to hepatitis, including health workers, intravenous drug users and children whose mothers are infected, Rino said. Soldiers also carry a high risk of infection because of bleeding during exercise or sharing razors. Unsterile tattooing can also spread hepatitis.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Hepatitis B is a potentially life-threatening liver infection caused by the hepatitis B virus. It is a major global health problem and the most serious type of viral hepatitis. It can cause chronic liver disease and puts people at high risk of death from cirrhosis of the liver and liver cancer. Worldwide, an estimated 2 billion people have been infected with the hepatitis B virus and more than 240 million have chronic (long-term) liver infections. About 600 000 people die every year due to the acute or chronic consequences of hepatitis. Hepatitis B virus is transmitted between people by direct blood-to-blood contact or semen and vaginal fluid of an infected person. Modes of transmission are the same as those for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), but the hepatitis B virus is 50 to 100 times more infectious. Unlike HIV, the hepatitis B virus can survive outside the body for at least 7 days. During this time, the virus can still cause infection if it enters the body of a person who is not protected by the vaccine. A vaccine against hepatitis B has been available since 1982. Hepatitis B vaccine is 95 percent effective in preventing infection and its chronic consequences, and is the 1st vaccine against a major human cancer. (For more detailed information, see http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs204/en/index.html).\n\nHepatitis C is a contagious liver disease that results from infection with the hepatitis C virus. It can range in severity from a mild illness lasting a few weeks to a serious, lifelong illness. Hepatitis C virus is usually spread when blood from an infected person enters the body of a susceptible person. It is among the most common viruses that infect the liver. Every year, 3-4 million people are infected with the hepatitis C virus. About 150 million people are chronically infected and at risk of developing liver cirrhosis and/or liver cancer. More than 350 000 people die from hepatitis C-related liver diseases every year. Hepatitis C may be transmitted through sex with an infected person or sharing of personal items contaminated with infectious blood, but these are less common. Hepatitis C is not spread through breast milk, food or water or by casual contact such as hugging, kissing and sharing food or drinks with an infected person. There is no generally available vaccine for prevention of hepatitis C virus infection. However antiviral drugs are becoming available which are effective in the treatment of hepatitis caused by some strains of hepatitis C virus. (For more detailed information, see: http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs164/en/index.html).\n\nThe World Health Organisation also organizes World Hepatitis Day on 28 July every year to increase awareness and understanding of viral hepatitis.\n\nThe interactive HealthMap of indonesia can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/r/01dp. - Mod.CP]\nSee Also\nHepatitis A - Indonesia: (WJ) 20111115.3370\n.................................................mpp/cp/mpp", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "hepatitis a", "hepatitis b", "hepatitis c", "hepatitis d"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2021-03-19 00:00:00", "2007-03-16 00:00:00", "1982-03-16 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Japan", "country": "Japan"}, {"location": "Indonesia", "country": "Indonesia"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "1226398", "headline": "PRO/EDR> Hepatitis C - USA (10): (NH) alert extended to GA", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=1226398", "date": "2012-07-21 20:35:19", "main_text": "HEPATITIS B AND C - INDONESIA: UNDERESTIMATED\n*********************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Sat 21 Jul 2012\nSource: The Jakarta Globe [edited]\nhttp://www.thejakartaglobe.com/news/hepatitis-cases-lurk-unchecked-in-indonesia/531776\n\n\nHepatitis Cases Lurk Unchecked in Indonesia\n----------------------\nHidden symptoms and a strong stigma are reasons many people with hepatitis B and C do not know they are infected, a medical researcher said on Friday [20 Jul 2012].

Worldwide, an estimated 2 billion people have been infected with the hepatitis B virus and more than 240 million have chronic (long-term) liver infections. About 600 000 people die every year due to the acute or chronic consequences of hepatitis. Hepatitis B virus is transmitted between people by direct blood-to-blood contact or semen and vaginal fluid of an infected person. Modes of transmission are the same as those for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), but the hepatitis B virus is 50 to 100 times more infectious. Unlike HIV, the hepatitis B virus can survive outside the body for at least 7 days. During this time, the virus can still cause infection if it enters the body of a person who is not protected by the vaccine. A vaccine against hepatitis B has been available since 1982. Hepatitis B vaccine is 95 percent effective in preventing infection and its chronic consequences, and is the 1st vaccine against a major human cancer. (For more detailed information, see http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs204/en/index.html).\n\nHepatitis C is a contagious liver disease that results from infection with the hepatitis C virus. It can range in severity from a mild illness lasting a few weeks to a serious, lifelong illness. Hepatitis C virus is usually spread when blood from an infected person enters the body of a susceptible person. It is among the most common viruses that infect the liver. Every year, 3-4 million people are infected with the hepatitis C virus. About 150 million people are chronically infected and at risk of developing liver cirrhosis and/or liver cancer. More than 350 000 people die from hepatitis C-related liver diseases every year. Hepatitis C may be transmitted through sex with an infected person or sharing of personal items contaminated with infectious blood, but these are less common. Hepatitis C is not spread through breast milk, food or water or by casual contact such as hugging, kissing and sharing food or drinks with an infected person. There is no generally available vaccine for prevention of hepatitis C virus infection. However antiviral drugs are becoming available which are effective in the treatment of hepatitis caused by some strains of hepatitis C virus.

Only 10 percent to 20 percent of hepatitis cases are detected, said Rino Gani, head of the Indonesia Liver Research Association (PPHI). \"Not everyone knows about the status of their infection and not everyone has had themselves examined,\" Rino said at a news conference ahead of World Hepatitis Day on 28 Jul 2012. Hepatitis takes a long time to show symptoms, but the disease can cause liver cirrhosis and cancer, Rino said. \"The damage only becomes known when it is already too late and not much can be done,\" Rino said. One of the problems is money, Rino said. Tests and treatment are only affordable for a small segment of society. Another is stigma. People who know they are infected often do not seek out treatment because they do not want people to know about their condition. Since the disease does not cause them pain, they are able to ignore it.\n\nAccording to H.M. Subuh, a director at the Health Ministry, rapid detection tests cost between Rp 30 000 [USD 3.18] and Rp 50 000 [5.29], and more sophisticated tests cost Rp 100 000 to Rp 150 000. [One USD approximates to 9445 Indonesian Rupiah]. \"The problem is that after someone is declared hepatitis B or C positive, another series of tests have to be undergone and the costs is about Rp 2 million [USD 211.75] and has to be done repeatedly before being eligible for therapy\" which can cost tens or hundreds of millions of rupiah, he said. The government's Jamkesmas health insurance scheme covers treatment for poor people, he added. Rino said an alternative to expensive therapies was needed. He praised a partnership between the University of Indonesia and the University of Kobe in Japan to develop an herbal-based cure for hepatitis C.\n\nA 2007 Health Ministry study found that 9.4 percent of Indonesians, or about 30 million people, were positive for hepatitis B or C. Globally, 170 million people are infected, and the disease[s] causes 1.5 million deaths annually. Several groups are especially vulnerable to hepatitis, including health workers, intravenous drug users and children whose mothers are infected, Rino said. Soldiers also carry a high risk of infection because of bleeding during exercise or sharing razors. Unsterile tattooing can also spread hepatitis.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Hepatitis B is a potentially life-threatening liver infection caused by the hepatitis B virus.

The government's Jamkesmas health insurance scheme covers treatment for poor people, he added. Rino said an alternative to expensive therapies was needed. He praised a partnership between the University of Indonesia and the University of Kobe in Japan to develop an herbal-based cure for hepatitis C.\n\nA 2007 Health Ministry study found that 9.4 percent of Indonesians, or about 30 million people, were positive for hepatitis B or C. Globally, 170 million people are infected, and the disease[s] causes 1.5 million deaths annually. Several groups are especially vulnerable to hepatitis, including health workers, intravenous drug users and children whose mothers are infected, Rino said. Soldiers also carry a high risk of infection because of bleeding during exercise or sharing razors. Unsterile tattooing can also spread hepatitis.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Hepatitis B is a potentially life-threatening liver infection caused by the hepatitis B virus. It is a major global health problem and the most serious type of viral hepatitis. It can cause chronic liver disease and puts people at high risk of death from cirrhosis of the liver and liver cancer. Worldwide, an estimated 2 billion people have been infected with the hepatitis B virus and more than 240 million have chronic (long-term) liver infections. About 600 000 people die every year due to the acute or chronic consequences of hepatitis. Hepatitis B virus is transmitted between people by direct blood-to-blood contact or semen and vaginal fluid of an infected person. Modes of transmission are the same as those for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), but the hepatitis B virus is 50 to 100 times more infectious. Unlike HIV, the hepatitis B virus can survive outside the body for at least 7 days. During this time, the virus can still cause infection if it enters the body of a person who is not protected by the vaccine. A vaccine against hepatitis B has been available since 1982. Hepatitis B vaccine is 95 percent effective in preventing infection and its chronic consequences, and is the 1st vaccine against a major human cancer. (For more detailed information, see http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs204/en/index.html).\n\nHepatitis C is a contagious liver disease that results from infection with the hepatitis C virus. It can range in severity from a mild illness lasting a few weeks to a serious, lifelong illness. Hepatitis C virus is usually spread when blood from an infected person enters the body of a susceptible person. It is among the most common viruses that infect the liver. Every year, 3-4 million people are infected with the hepatitis C virus. About 150 million people are chronically infected and at risk of developing liver cirrhosis and/or liver cancer. More than 350 000 people die from hepatitis C-related liver diseases every year. Hepatitis C may be transmitted through sex with an infected person or sharing of personal items contaminated with infectious blood, but these are less common. Hepatitis C is not spread through breast milk, food or water or by casual contact such as hugging, kissing and sharing food or drinks with an infected person. There is no generally available vaccine for prevention of hepatitis C virus infection. However antiviral drugs are becoming available which are effective in the treatment of hepatitis caused by some strains of hepatitis C virus.

Only 10 percent to 20 percent of hepatitis cases are detected, said Rino Gani, head of the Indonesia Liver Research Association (PPHI). \"Not everyone knows about the status of their infection and not everyone has had themselves examined,\" Rino said at a news conference ahead of World Hepatitis Day on 28 Jul 2012. Hepatitis takes a long time to show symptoms, but the disease can cause liver cirrhosis and cancer, Rino said. \"The damage only becomes known when it is already too late and not much can be done,\" Rino said. One of the problems is money, Rino said. Tests and treatment are only affordable for a small segment of society. Another is stigma. People who know they are infected often do not seek out treatment because they do not want people to know about their condition. Since the disease does not cause them pain, they are able to ignore it.\n\nAccording to H.M.

A random screening of 1297 people in 6\ndifferent locations of North Chennai by the Madras Medical College\nshowed 61 of them positive for hepatitis. While 44 had hepatitis B, 17\nwere positive for hepatitis C.\n\nMadras Medical College dean Dr S Kanakasabai, who released the results\non Wednesday [26 Jul 2011], said the College organised [an] awareness\nand screening programme (using blood samples) [for] the liver diseases\nat 6 locations: Harbour, Seven Wells Street, Wall tax Road, Broadway,\nSathya Nagar (War Memorial) and Bharathi Women's College to\ncommemorate World Hepatitis Day, which falls on Thursday [28 Jul\n2011]. The screening was done for people from the lower socio-economic\ngroups every day for the last one week.\n\n\"These patients were apparently healthy. They did not know they were\ncarriers of the disease,\" said Dr Kanakasabai. The results shocked not\nonly the patients but also many doctors in the college. \"We did not\nexpect that more than 4 percent of the people will be tested\npositive,\" he said. Those tested positive will be treated at the\nGovernment General Hospital, which is attached to the college. Their\nclose relatives will also be screened. The college is also planning to\nextend the study across the city.\n\nHepatitis is an inflammation of the liver, most commonly caused by a\nviral infection. There are 5 main hepatitis viruses, referred to as\ntypes A, B, C, D and E. Hepatitis can lead to illness and death. In\nparticular, types B and C lead to chronic disease in hundreds of\nmillions of people and together are the most common cause of liver\ncirrhosis and cancer.\n\nHepatitis A and E are typically caused by ingestion of contaminated\nfood or water. Hepatitis B, C and D -- like HIV -- usually occur as a\nresult of contact with infected body fluids. Acute infection may occur\nwith limited or no symptoms or may include symptoms such as jaundice\n(yellowing of the skin and eyes), dark urine, extreme fatigue, nausea,\nvomiting and abdominal pain.\n\nSurgical gasteroentrologist Dr R Surendran, who works with Stanley\nMedical College, says hospital medical records show that nearly 6\npercent of the population of north Chennai has hepatitis B and nearly\none percent have hepatitis C. \"But we thought our data was skewed\nbecause only people with problems came to our hospital,\" he said.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nHealthMap alerts via ProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[World Hepatitis Day 2011: The World Heath Organization (WHO) is today\n[Thu 28 Jul 2011] calling for attention to the global health problem\nposed by viral hepatitis.

Read the WHO fact sheet on hepatitis B at\nhttp://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs204/en/index.html.\nKey facts:\n- Hepatitis B is a viral infection that attacks the liver and can\ncause both acute and chronic disease.\n- The virus is transmitted through contact with the blood or other\nbody fluids of an infected person, not through casual contact.\n- About 2 billion people worldwide have been infected with the virus,\nand about 350 million live with chronic infection. An estimated 600\n000 persons die each year due to the acute or chronic consequences of\nhepatitis B.\n- About 25 percent of adults who become chronically infected during\nchildhood later die from liver cancer or cirrhosis (scarring of the\nliver) caused by the chronic infection.\n- The hepatitis B virus is 50 to 100 times more infectious than HIV.\n- Hepatitis B virus is an important occupational hazard for health\nworkers.\n- Hepatitis B is preventable with a safe and effective vaccine.\n\nHepatitis C: 130 million people at least are chronically infected with\nhepatitis C virus. Read the WHO fact sheet on hepatitis C at\nhttp://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs164/en/index.html.\nKey facts:\n- Hepatitis C is a liver disease caused by the hepatitis C virus\n(HCV).\n- HCV infection sometimes results in an acute symptomatic illness. It\ncan range in severity from a mild illness lasting a few weeks to a\nserious, lifelong chronic condition that can lead to cirrhosis of the\nliver and liver cancer.\n- HCV is transmitted through contact with the blood of an infected\nperson.\n- About 130-170 million people are chronically infected with hepatitis\nC virus, and more than 350 000 people die from hepatitis C-related\nliver diseases each year.\n- HCV infection is curable using increasingly effective antivirals.\n- Despite ongoing research, there is currently no vaccine to prevent\nhepatitis C virus infection.\n\nThe data from North Chennai provide a snap-shot of the reality of the\nsituation and justify the need for the World Hepatitis Day to\nhighlight the gravity of the situation.

The results shocked not\nonly the patients but also many doctors in the college. \"We did not\nexpect that more than 4 percent of the people will be tested\npositive,\" he said. Those tested positive will be treated at the\nGovernment General Hospital, which is attached to the college. Their\nclose relatives will also be screened.

There have\nbeen about 1000 new cases annually during the past 4 to 5 years\naccording to Dr Richard Lessard, director of the Montreal DSP\n[Direction de sante publique de Montreal; public health department].\nThis figure may represent only a fraction of the actual number of\ncases. \"We cannot know the percentage of infected people in the\ngeneral population.\" Dr Lessard stated further that: \"We only know the\nsituation for people who have undergone screening. However, we know\nthat the infection is prevalent in all districts of the city of\nMontreal. \"Initially, HCV was present mainly in the city centre and in\nthe south west district, but currently the problem is present in all\nareas of Montreal island.\"\n\nNearly 50 per cent of infected people are or have been users of\ninjected drugs. \"HCV is transmitted by blood. Needle re-use is the\nmain route of transmission,\" according to Dr Lessard. HCV infection is\n3 times commoner in men than in women. In 95 per cent of cases, people\nwho exchange syringes will become infected in the 1st 6 months after\nbecoming addicted. Dr Lessard advised that the establishment of\nsupervised injection facilities should be considered as an approach\ntoward curbing this scourge. \"We must improve our prevention\nstrategies to prevent the problem snowballing out of control.\"\n\nTo a lesser extent, use of other types of drug pose problems in\nrelation to HCV (and HIV) infection. Sandra Trifa, a nurse involved in\nHCV and HIV infection control stated that: \"Pipes used for smoking\ncrack [cocaine] also represent a risk [for transmission of virus]\nbecause they may cause burns and bleeding lips.\" Nurse Trifa also\nindicated that nasal inhalation is another route of infection, because\nthe occurrence of micro damage in the nasal passages contributes to\nthe spread of HCV, which is a more virulent [contagious?] virus than\nHIV. \"Whereas HIV is inactivated rapidly at ambient temperatures, HCV\ncan remain infectious for up to 16 hours under the same conditions,\nand can remain infectious for as long as 163 days in a contaminated\nsyringe,\" according to Nurse Trifa.\n\nIn 2009, 45 per cent of all HCV diagnoses in Quebec [province] were\nmade in Montreal.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nHealthMap Alerts via ProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[About 60-70 per cent of people newly infected with HCV typically are\nusually asymptomatic or have a mild clinical illness.

Chronic HCV infection develops in 70 per cent to 85 per cent\nof HCV-infected people and 60 per cent to 70 per cent of people with\nchronic infection have evidence of active liver disease. Most of those\ninfected might not be aware of their infection because they are not\nclinically ill, but they serve as a source of transmission to others\nand are at risk of chronic liver disease or other HCV-related chronic\ndiseases decades after infection.\n\nHCV is most efficiently transmitted through large or repeated\npercutaneous exposure to infected blood (such as, through transfusion\nof blood from unscreened donors or through use of injecting drugs).\nAlthough much less frequent, occupational, perinatal, and sexual\nexposures also can result in transmission of HCV.

Surveillance data\nalso indicate that 15 per cent to 20 per cent of people reported with\nacute HCV infection have a history of sexual exposure in the absence\nof other risk factors.\n\n15 per cent to 25 per cent of people clear the virus from their\nbodies without treatment and do not develop chronic infection, but HCV\ninfection becomes chronic in about 75 per cent to 85 per cent of\ncases.\n\nChronic liver disease in people with HCV infection is usually\ninsidious, progressing slowly without any signs or symptoms for\nseveral decades and often not recognized until asymptomatic people are\nidentified as HCV-positive or when elevated alanine aminotransferase\nlevels are detected during routine examinations.\n\nInformation on the prevalence of HCV infection in the United States\nand elsewhere can be obtained at\nhttp://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/HCV/index.htm.\n\nThe HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map of Canada at\nhttp://healthmap.org/r/0PCT can be used to locate the city of\nMontreal in Quebec province. - Mod.CP]\nSee Also\n2004\n---\nHepatitis C virus, blood supply - South Korea (02) 20040402.0900\nHepatitis C virus, blood supply - South Korea 20040330.0869\n2003\n---\nHepatitis C virus, hospital acquired - Israel (03) 20030816.2038\nHepatitis C virus, hospital acquired - Israel (02) 20030814.2025\nHepatitis C virus, hospital acquired - Israel 20030813.2016\n2002\n---\nHepatitis C virus, clinic-acquired cluster - USA (NE) 20021017.5579\n2001\n---\nHepatitis C virus, nosocomial transmission - UK 20010531.1072\nHepatitis C virus, vaccine research 20010522.0994\n2000\n---\nHepatitis C virus, perinatal transmission risk - UK 20000918.1605\nHepatitis C virus, risk assessment 20000726.1243\n.................................................sb/cp/mj/sh", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "hepatitis c"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2009-03-16 00:00:00", "2003-03-16 00:00:00", "2002-03-16 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Canada", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Quebec", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "NE", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Montreal", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "the United States", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "South Korea", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Israel", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "668057", "headline": "PRO> Hepatitis B & C, nosocomial - USA (04): (OH)", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=668057", "date": "2010-09-26 12:00:04", "main_text": "HEPATITIS C - USA (02): (FLORIDA) TRANSPLANT RELATED\n****************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\n<http://www.promedmail.org>\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\n<http://www.isid.org>\n\nDate: Thu 23 Sep 2010\nSource: Sun Sentinel [edited]\n<http://www.sun-sentinel.com/health/os-mayo-clinic-infection-20100923,0,7542514.story>\n\n\nMayo worker put patients at risk for hepatitis\n----------------------------------------------\nThe [registered] letter in her mailbox on Wednesday [22 Sep 2010]\nsurprised a Tavares woman, but not nearly as much as its contents.\nWhile she was a patient at the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, a rogue\nemployee in the radiology department was injecting himself with a\npotent painkiller intended for patients and refilling the syringes\nwith saline.

He had hepatitis C, a potentially deadly virus that\nattacks the liver. \"Apparently, he did this for many years before he\nwas caught,\" said the former patient, who asked not to be named\nbecause it might stigmatize her.\n\nShe is among 5000 former patients at the Florida branch of the\nrenowned Mayo Clinic to receive the warning letter, which has been\nmailed out in 2 waves this month [September 2010]. \"I have never felt\nmore safe than I was at the Mayo Clinic,\" said the Tavares woman, who\nunderwent heart and kidney operations at the Mayo Clinic in 2006 and\n2007. \"For this to happen, I think is horrible.\" On Thursday [23 Sep\n2010], the Mayo Clinic sent a team to her home to draw blood for\ntesting for hepatitis C, hepatitis B, and HIV infection. So far, 3\nformer patients have tested positive for hepatitis C [virus infection].\n\nIn August [2010], a 47-year-old former radiology technician, was\nfired after admitting he had used painkillers prescribed for\npatients. He was arrested last month [August 2010] on a minor felony\nrelated to stealing drugs. But law-enforcement officials say he could\nface more charges as the investigation continues. The radiology\ntechnician worked at the Mayo from 11 Oct 2004, up to 21 Aug 2010. He\nworked in Interventional Radiology at St Luke's Hospital from 2004 to\n11 Apr 2008, when Mayo Clinic owned St Luke's Hospital.\n\n\"We want to ensure that every patient who might be at risk is\ntested,\" said Dr William C Rupp, chief executive officer of Mayo\nClinic in Florida. \"We want to cast as wide a net as possible to make\nsure we've included any possible patient.\" That, Rupp said, has\nincluded tracking down every patient who had a procedure on the days\nthe technician was working and in the section of the hospital where\nhe was working. Most of the affected patients are from Florida, Rupp\nsaid, but letters also have been sent to several living in the\nSoutheast and a few who live abroad.\n\nThe former employee has tested negative for hepatitis B virus and\nHIV, Rupp said, but the US Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention, as well as the Florida Department of Health, urged that\nformer patients be tested for those viruses as well. So far, 3\npatients have been diagnosed with cases of hepatitis C that are\ngenetically similar to the type the technician has, Mayo officials\nsaid. One of those patients died from the virus [infection], another\ndied from an unrelated illness, and the 3rd remains alive. Hepatitis\nC virus attacks the liver but often doesn't cause symptoms for years.\nLeft untreated, it can cause severe problems, such as cirrhosis and\nliver cancer.\n\nThe American Hospital Association described the Mayo technician's\nactions as \"egregious and criminal,\" said spokesman Matt Fenwick. He\ncalled upon hospitals to work hard to \"ensure it doesn't happen\nagain.\" For their part, Mayo Clinic officials say they are taking\nsteps to improve security related to narcotics. Among the new\nsafeguards: Mayo nurses will now initial every syringe when it's\ndrawn so that it can't be switched without notice.\n\n[Byline: Linda Shrieves]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Brent Barrett\n\n[The initial report in ProMED-mail on 24 Aug 2010 of 3 cases of\nhepatitis C virus contracted from a radiology technician at the Mayo\nClinic in Jacksonville, Florida, did not explain the circumstances\nsurrounding this incident. It is now revealed that the affected\nindividuals were surgical or transplant patients, one of whom died\nsubsequently as a result of hepatitis C virus infection. These\npatients, and possibly others (up to 5000 are being contacted), were\ninfected by the actions a single technician in the radiology\ndepartment who was injecting himself with a potent narcotic intended\nfor patients and refilling the syringes with saline. Subsequent\nanalysis revealed that the employee was a hepatitis C virus carrier.\nIt remains to be established whether any other patients at risk have\nbeen infected. At the time of the incident the errant technician\ntested negative for both hepatitis B virus and HIV infection.\n\nThe HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map of Florida, showing the\nlocation of Jacksonville, can be accessed at\n<http://healthmap.org/r/03Bg>. - Mod.CP]\nSee Also\nHepatitis C - USA: (FL) transplant related, RFI 20100825.2995\n...................................cp/mj/mpp\n\n*##########################################################*\n************************************************************\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.

The South Korean branch of the international agency also put into\ncirculation 228 units of blood donated by 99 people who had been suspected\nof carrying human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), but who later tested\nnegative for the virus, the official said. 9 people were found to have been\ninfected with hepatitis [C virus?] during February 2004 after receiving\nblood transfusions from the Red Cross, the officials said.\n\nSouth Korean Red Cross spokesman Lee Jae-sung said the problems stemmed\nfrom a change in laws in Apr 2000 that banned donations from people who had\nbeen infected with hepatitis. The previous law had allowed donations from\npeople who were hepatitis-free at the time they gave blood. It was not\nimmediately clear whether there were also cases of hepatitis infections\nthrough blood donations made before Apr 2000 under the earlier rules. \"We\nchanged the rules for donation, but we only acquired a system to\ninvestigate donors' disease history in May 2003,\" Lee said by telephone.\n\"The 9 people infected with hepatitis [C?] virus received blood during the\nperiod between 1 Apr 2000 and May 2003,\" he said.\n\nOne of the 9 already had hepatitis before receiving the tainted\ntransfusion, he said. \"We take full responsibility for the other 8 people\nand plan compensation,\" Lee said, adding the suspect units of blood had\nbeen used up by the time 2003's audit had been done. New procedures for\nchecking donors' medical history had made it \"impossible for people who had\nbeen infected with viruses to donate their blood\", he said.\n\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Hopefully the screening procedures introduced as a result of this episode\nwill prevent any recurrence. - Mod.CP]\nSee Also\nCJD (new var.), blood supply - UK 20040318.0758\n2003\n----\nWest Nile virus update 2003 - USA (25) 20030918.2368\nHepatitis B virus, blood transfusion, 2003 - Japan 20030914.2326\nHepatitis B virus, blood transfusion, 2000 - Japan (03) 20030826.2149\nHIV, hepatitis, syphilis contamin. blood - Japan (02) 20030821.2098\nWest Nile virus update 2003 - USA (20) 20030815.2034\nCJD (new var.), blood transmission - UK: susp 20031217.3082\nCJD (new var.), blood transmission - UK: susp (02) 20031219.3095\n2002\n----\nWest Nile virus, transplant transmission - USA (03) 20020909.5269\n............................cp/sp/pg/dk\n\n*##########################################################*\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.

From June 1990 to July 1997, the\nteam examined 163 adults with chronic hepatitis B (HBV) and 432 patients\nwith chronic hepatitis C who were seronegative for HAV antibodies; tests\nwere conducted every four months for serum IgM and IgG antibodies to HAV.\nOver the course of the study, 10 patients with HBV infections and 17 with\nHCV infections acquired HAV superinfection. Of these patients, fulminant\nhepatic failure developed in seven of the HCV-infected individuals, six of\nwhom died. All but one of the HBV patients who developed HAV had\nuncomplicated courses. Since HAV infection rarely has a fulminant course\nand is usually non-fatal, the research team note that \"the high mortality\nrate among our patients with chronic hepatitis C and HAV superinfection (35\npercent) is thus surprising, as is the even higher percentage of such\npatients with fulminant hepatitis (41 percent).\" The authors suggest,\ntherefore, that individuals with chronic HCV infection be vaccinated\nagainst HAV.\n--\nProMED-mail\ne-mail: promed@usa.healthnet.org\n............................................................chc/es\n--\n*##########################################################*\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.
