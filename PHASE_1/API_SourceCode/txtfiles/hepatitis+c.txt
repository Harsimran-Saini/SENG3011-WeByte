'It's extremely important specifically for hepatitis C,' Reed said. 'You can have it, really, for like 10 years -- even sometimes longer, 20 years -- and not even know that you have it. All the while, it can be potentially doing damage to your body, and then when you do finally catch it, it may be too late.'\n\n'The good thing about hepatitis C is that there is a cure.

Darren Russell from the Cairns and Hinterland Hospital and Health Service said most of those cases were linked to the Lotus Glen Correctional Centre. 'What we are seeing is increasing amounts of injecting drug use [at the prison], and that is occurring particularly in a group of young Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander men who haven't injected before,' Professor Russell said.\n\nA spokesperson for the Department of Corrective Services said the average prison sentence for male prisoners in Queensland was about 8 months, meaning there was a significant turnover of prisoners. That, combined with the rise in hepatitis C infections, has raised concern about the disease being transmitted in Queensland's remote Indigenous communities when prisoners are released.\n\n'People that revolve through the system are reservoirs of infectious diseases that get back out to our communities,' said Apunipima Cape York Health Council's Mark Wenitong.\n\nSection 37 of Queensland's Human Rights Act, which came into effect on 1 Jan 2020, stated that every person had the right to health services without discrimination. Katelin Haynes, the chief executive of Hepatitis Queensland, said this section of the act meant people incarcerated in the state's prisons should be given access to NSPs just as people in wider society were.\n\n'People in prisons have a right to equality of health services, and that includes harm reduction measures, health promotion measures, and education, as well as more traditional medical approaches like testing and treatment of hepatitis C,' Dr Haynes said. 'Under the Queensland Human Rights Act, everyone has a right to health services, and we see NSPs as a health service.'\n\nThe Australian Injecting and Illicit Drug Users League (AIVL) has long campaigned for the introduction of NSPs in Australian prisons. AIVL chief executive Melanie Walker said more than a dozen countries had implemented NSPs in prisons 'without the sky falling in. There's not been a single incident of someone being attacked with a needle and catching any blood-borne viruses as a result of those programs overseas,' Ms Walker said. 'In fact, quite the opposite. What it has meant is that there's regulation of needle and syringe use in prisons, and what we know is that in any given country, injecting equipment is getting into prisons. Where there is a will, there is a way.'\n\nThe introduction of NSPs in custodial settings is recommended in the Australian Government's national strategies for blood-borne viruses and sexually transmitted infections. The Queensland Offender Health Services Review 2018 also recommended Queensland Corrective Services investigate its policy on needle exchange. Despite this, no Australian jurisdiction currently provides NSPs to prisoners.\n\nMs Walker said evidence from international experiences of NSPs was in, and policy decisions had been made, so it was now the practicalities of implementing NSPs in Australian custodial settings that were up for debate. 'Now that there are a number of countries that have moved forward with this, there are different models in different contexts, and we can look at those and see what combination of models, or what type of model, will work in any given circumstance in Australia,' she said. 'It's not about whether we should do it; it's about how we do it, and those are the challenges that governments face moving forward.'\n\nThe Together Union, which represents correctional officers in Queensland prisons, says NSPs in custodial settings present an unacceptable risk to staff. 'We're at the point in Queensland now that we're getting almost an assault a day in prisons,' said the union's director of industrial services Michael Thomas. 'And we're deciding to put a range of what are effectively dangerous weapons into prisons during that time. That's the concern of our members.'\n\nMr Thomas said more funding was needed to stem the flow of drugs and injecting equipment into prisons, rather than condoning illegal activity within them. 'Drug use is a health issue,' he said. 'But if you think of the amount of crime that comes from it, and we've got the opportunity in a controlled environment to try and end the drug habit and end the health problem, then we should be doing that, not just condoning the ongoing use of drugs.'\n\n[Byline: Mark Rigby]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Like hepatitis B and human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis C can be spread by sharing needles among injection drug users. - Mod.LL\n\nHealthMap/ProMED-mail map:\nQueensland, Australia: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/285]", "summary": "\n\n'People in prisons have a right to equality of health services, and that includes harm reduction measures, health promotion measures, and education, as well as more traditional medical approaches like testing and treatment of hepatitis C,' Dr Haynes said.

MMWR Recomm Rep 2020. 69(RR-2): 1-17. doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.rr6902a1.\n\nSummary:\n\nHepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a major source of morbidity and mortality in the United States. HCV is transmitted primarily through parenteral exposures to infectious blood or body fluids that contain blood, most commonly through injection drug use. No vaccine against hepatitis C exists, and no effective pre- or postexposure prophylaxis is available. More than half of persons who become infected with HCV will develop chronic infection. Direct-acting antiviral treatment can result in a virologic cure in most persons with 8-12 weeks of all-oral medication regimens. This report augments (i.e., updates and summarizes) previously published recommendations from CDC regarding testing for HCV infection in the United States (Smith BD, Morgan RL, Beckett GA, et al. Recommendations for the identification of chronic hepatitis C virus infection among persons born during 1945-1965. MMWR Recomm Rec 2012; 61(RR-4)). CDC is augmenting previous guidance with 2 new recommendations: (1) hepatitis C screening at least once in a lifetime for all adults aged greater than or equal to18 years, except in settings where the prevalence of HCV infection is less than 0.1%, and (2) hepatitis C screening for all pregnant women during each pregnancy, except in settings where the prevalence of HCV infection is less than 0.1%.

Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. 2019; 68(16): 374-376. doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm6816a3.\n\nDuring 22 Jan 2018 - 23 Mar 2018, a local health department in Washington was notified of 2 patients who received a diagnosis of acute hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Neither patient had behavioral risk factors associated with HCV acquisition; however, both had received injectable narcotic (opioid) drugs from the same nurse during separate visits to an emergency department (ED) at a local hospital on 6 and 16 Dec 2017. Investigation revealed that the nurse had accessed the automated drug dispensing system at a higher frequency than had other staff members, admitted diverting patients' injectable narcotic and antihistamine drugs for personal use, and tested positive for HCV antibodies (anti-HCV) on 19 Mar 2018, but did not have quantifiable HCV RNA. Specimens from both patients were sent to CDC for genetic testing, and HCV viral variants analysis found a significant level of genetically similar HCV variants in both patients, indicating a common source of infection. Further investigation was conducted to confirm the infection source, identify other potentially exposed patients, and treat any new patients who received an HCV diagnosis. Monitoring frequency of access to drug dispensing systems can help identify staff members with abnormal dispensing patterns, including diversion activities (1). US healthcare facilities are required to prevent, identify, and report any loss, diversion, or theft of controlled substances (2).\n\nInvestigation and Results\n----------------------\nThe 1st patient, a man in his 60s, was evaluated at the hospital ED for abdominal pain on 6 Dec 2017 and received injectable narcotic drugs from 2 nurses. The patient returned to the same ED on 12 Jan 2018, with history of jaundice and abdominal discomfort. During this visit, the patient had elevated liver enzymes and tested positive for both anti-HCV and HCV RNA. In December 2016, the patient had tested negative for anti-HCV during routine screening for persons born during 1945-1965 and did not have any behavioral risk factors associated with HCV infection acquisition. The 2 nurses who treated the patient with injectable narcotic drugs had each withdrawn injectable narcotic drugs from the automated drug dispensing system at a frequency that was greater than 3 standard deviations above the mean for all staff members during February 2018. On 19 Mar 2018, one of the nurses (nurse A) tested positive for anti-HCV using an immunoassay test and tested negative for HCV RNA using a real time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction test; a week later, she tested HCV RNA-positive at a level less than the lower limit of detection of 15 IU/mL, too low for viral sequencing. This nurse, who had tested anti-HCV-negative and HCV RNA-negative with a blood donation in 2013, admitted diverting injectable narcotic and antihistamine drugs from patients for personal use during current employment at the hospital ED, though she did not specify the mechanism. On 27 Mar 2018, the other nurse (nurse B) tested negative for anti-HCV using an immunoassay test. Both nurses tested negative for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections.\n\nOn 16 Dec 2017, in the same ED, a woman in her 50s received injectable narcotic drugs for neck pain from nurse A. This patient, who also did not have behavioral risk factors associated with HCV infection acquisition, returned to the same ED on 23 Mar 2018 with jaundice and tested positive for both anti-HCV and HCV RNA.\n\nCDC's Division of Viral Hepatitis performed HCV genetic sequencing and phylogenetic analysis on specimens from both ED patients; a high degree of similarity in nucleotide sequences (greater than 96%) between HCV viral variants sampled from 2 persons indicates a common source of transmission (3,4). Both patients had HCV genotype 1a that was greater than 96% similar; it was not possible to assess the similarity between the HCV nucleotides in the infected patients and nurse A because HCV RNA titers for nurse A were too low.\n\nNurse A worked at the ED during 4 Aug 2017 - 23 Mar 2018. During that period, the hospital identified 2985 patients who received injectable drugs (i.e., narcotic, sedative, or antihistamine drugs) at the ED while she was on duty, regardless of whether she had been assigned to provide their care. On 28 Apr 2018, the hospital mailed letters to the 2762 (93%) living patients who received the injectable drugs when nurse A was on duty, including 208 (7.5%) patients who were treated by nurse A. The letters described potential HCV exposure and offered free testing for HCV, HBV, and HIV infections.\n\nBy 1 Nov 2018, a total of 1863 (67%) of 2762 patients had been tested for HCV, HBV, and HIV infections, including 175 (84%) of the 208 patients treated by nurse A. Among those 175 patients, 20 (11%) tested positive for anti-HCV or HCV RNA, including 13 (65%) who had HCV genotype 1a with greater than 96% similarity between their intrahost nucleotide sequences, 3 (15%) who tested anti-HCV-positive but HCV RNA-negative, and 4 (20%) who tested HCV RNA-positive with titers below quantification level. Among the remaining 1688 patients with no record of treatment by nurse A, 65 (4%) tested positive for anti-HCV or HCV RNA, including 49 (75%) with positive anti-HCV and negative HCV RNA, 15 (25%) who had both positive anti-HCV and HCV RNA, which were not genetically related (10 genotype 1a, one genotype 1b, one genotype 2b, and 3 genotype 3a), and one (1%) with positive RNA titers below quantification level. No screened patients tested positive for HIV, and no new HBV infections were identified. No other healthcare providers at the ED were offered HCV testing, and no others had provided treatment to a majority of the 13 patients with genetically similar HCV infection.\n\nTwelve of 13 patients with genetically similar HCV RNA specimens had newly diagnosed HCV infection and had received injectable narcotic, sedative, or antihistamine drugs from nurse A during 22 Nov - 26 Dec 2017 (Figure [for Figure, see original URL - Mod.LL]). One patient was known to have chronic HCV infection and received injectable narcotic drugs from nurse A twice in the ED: 1st on 17 Aug 2017, and again on 8 Nov 2017. It is possible that nurse A acquired the virus from the patient with chronic HCV infection during the 8 Nov 2017 visit and was infectious during 22 Nov - 26 Dec 2017, during which time at least 12 patients that she treated became infected.\n\nPublic Health Action\n------------------\nAll screened patients with positive HCV RNA results were referred for care, including hepatitis C treatment for those who developed chronic infection. Because of the high risk for HCV infection among patients who received injections from nurse A, the local health department is conducting additional outreach to the remaining 33 (16%) patients who had not been tested for hepatitis C at the time of this analysis. The Washington State Nursing Commission conducted a separate investigation of nurse A's professional conduct and suspended her practicing license.\n\nDiscussion\n--------\nAn HCV outbreak occurred among patients treated in a Washington ED; transmission likely occurred as the result of unsafe injection practices during drug diversion by a healthcare provider. Drug diversion by healthcare providers can pose serious infection risks for patients (1). Transmission of HCV from infected healthcare providers who divert patient drugs has been previously reported, and in some cases those providers have reported unsafe practices, including injecting themselves with the patient's drug, refilling the syringe with water, and injecting water into the patient (5,6). Some investigations have confirmed transmission of HCV infection from healthcare providers to patients by identifying genetically similar HCV infections in both the healthcare providers and infected patients (3).\n\nSeveral epidemiologic findings in this investigation strongly indicate that nurse A was the likely source of infection for the 12 patients with acute HCV infection. 1st, she had accessed the automated drug dispensing system at a higher frequency than had other staff members and admitted to diverting patient injectable narcotic drugs for personal use. 2nd, she had seroconverted to anti-HCV-positive after a previous negative test and then tested positive for HCV RNA, indicating recent infection. Finally, having administered injectable narcotic, sedative, or antihistamine drugs to each patient, nurse A was the only common epidemiologic link to 13 patients with genetically similar HCV. The patients with HCV infection who were not cared for by nurse A were infected by strains that were genetically distant from each other and from the HCV 1a strains infecting the group of 13 patients.\n\nBecause repeat HCV infection after viral clearance might occur with re-exposure to the virus (7), it is possible that nurse A could have experienced more than one acute HCV infection between the last negative anti-HCV and HCV RNA tests in 2013 and 1st positive test in 2018. It is also possible that other patients infected by the nurse were missed by limiting the investigation to the period of this outbreak.\n\nHealthcare facilities need to develop security measures and to actively monitor drug dispensing systems to detect and prevent narcotic and other drug diversion (2,8). Protocols to respond to identified drug diversion should address testing of patients at risk for contracting illness and measures to prevent further transmission.\n\nReferences\n----------------\n1.

Years later, the 57-year-old from Greensboro, North Carolina, started feeling sick, fatigued, and foggy. When he went to the doctor in 2000, he was shocked to find out that he was infected with hepatitis C. His situation is not unique. An increasing number of North Carolinians live with hepatitis C, many of whom are unaware they are infected. In response to a dramatic statewide spike in hepatitis C infections fueled by the opioid crisis, North Carolina launched a multimillion dollar initiative on Thu 13 Jun 2019 to fight the virus.\n\nThe initiative seeks to increase access to hepatitis C screenings and treatment. It is funded by California-based biotech company Gilead Sciences and is partnering with local healthcare providers and the Harm Reduction Coalition, which advocates for health services for drug users.\n\nThe HepConnect launch in Raleigh followed launches in Kentucky, Tennessee, West Virginia and Indiana, which also saw increased infections, concentrated more in their younger drug-abusing populations, according to Jill Foster, a senior director for Gilead Sciences. 'We started doing routine healthcare screenings in these 5 states ... we started going to more Appalachian rural regions and started finding a lot of hepatitis C, much much more than we expected,' she said.\n\nThe state's health department estimates 110 000 people in North Carolina live with hepatitis C and that in 2017, there was a roughly 5-fold increase from a decade earlier. The virus can spread through sharing needles and can cause severe liver damage or death. In 2016, the most recent year that data are available, 511 people died in North Carolina due to hepatitis C-related causes.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Gale Adcock spoke at the event and later said the initiative is just one step in addressing problems caused by the opioid epidemic. She said the state has just 'scratched the surface' of what it can do to help. 'Our state still has half a million people who don't have health insurance and we need to address that,' she said, adding, 'you can't get screened and diagnosed if you don't have some way to pay for it usually; you certainly can't get treated for hepatitis C if you don't have the money for the medication.'\n\nShe also said she wants to break down stigmas around drug use, which can prevent people from seeking treatment. Adcock supports the idea of needle exchanges to help prevent diseases that spread through dirty needles. 'People who use drugs, they're our friends, they're our neighbors, they're us,' she said.\n\n[Byline: Amanda Morris]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[It is certainly true that we have quite effective, albeit quite expensive, therapy for hepatitis C.

Increased risk for mother-to-infant transmission of hepatitis C virus among medicaid recipients -- Wisconsin, 2011-2015\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nState surveillance during the last 10 years reveals a nationwide increase in hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection among young adults (1). The proportion of infants born to HCV-infected women is also increasing nationally (2). To estimate the proportion of infants born to HCV-infected women and the frequency of confirmed HCV infection in their infants, maternal name and date of birth from HCV reports in the Wisconsin Electronic Disease Surveillance System (WEDSS) were linked to Wisconsin Medicaid data for 2011-2015 births. During this period, in the Wisconsin Medicaid population, the proportion of women who had evidence of HCV infection during pregnancy increased 93 percent, from 1 in 368 pregnancies to 1 in 192. Among 183 infants born to women with evidence of HCV viremia during pregnancy, 34 percent received recommended HCV testing (3). Mother-to-infant (vertical) transmission was documented in 4 percent of infants. Improvements in HCV screening practices among pregnant women and infants could enhance identification of infants at risk for vertical transmission of HCV.\n\nFueled by the increase in injection drug use ensuing from the opioid epidemic, the proportion of infants born to HCV-infected women is increasing nationwide (1,2). Vertical transmission is the most common mechanism of HCV infection for children, reported to occur in approximately 6 percent of infants born to women with HCV infection and approximately twice as often in women who are coinfected with HCV and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (4,5). Another risk factor that might increase the likelihood of vertical HCV transmission is presence of maternal HCV viremia (HCV RNA positivity) (5). Unlike other blood borne infectious diseases that have a risk for vertical transmission, such as hepatitis B virus or HIV, for HCV there is no perinatal intervention available that has been shown to reduce vertical HCV transmission (4-6). Clinical signs of pediatric HCV infection often manifest slowly and can range in severity from being asymptomatic to fatal; liver transplantation is sometimes required (7,8).\n\nDuring 2011-2015, the reported rate of HCV among persons aged 15-44 years in Wisconsin increased 81 percent, from 45.7 to 82.6 per 100 000 population; 3,013 (43 percent) reported cases in this age group were in women (Wisconsin Division of Public Health, unpublished data, 2016). Increases in the number of women of childbearing age with HCV in Wisconsin predict an increase in the number of infants at risk for vertical transmission. The aim of this study was to estimate the proportion of women enrolled in Wisconsin Medicaid with HCV infection during pregnancy and estimate the frequency of HCV testing and infection in infants born to HCV-infected women.\n\nSince 2000, all HCV-positive laboratory tests in Wisconsin have been reportable to the Wisconsin Department of Health Services through WEDSS. To identify maternal HCV infection, Wisconsin Medicaid encounter data for pregnant women who delivered one or more infants during 2011-2015 were extracted and linked by maternal name and maternal date of birth to WEDSS. For women who matched to both data sources, WEDSS HCV surveillance data were reviewed for evidence of HCV infection (positive laboratory reports for anti-HCV antibody or RNA). The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the Minimal Risk (Health Sciences) Institutional Review Board at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.\n\nConsistent with a previous study (5), vertical transmission risk by pregnancy was classified based on presence of maternal HCV infection (anti-HCV antibody or HCV RNA). Women with HCV infection reported before their date of delivery were categorized into three risk groups: 1) high risk (evidence of viremia [RNA-positive] during pregnancy); 2) possible risk (evidence of viremia before pregnancy but no RNA results during pregnancy); and 3) unknown viremic risk (anti-HCV antibody-positive but no RNA results). Women in the cohort whose first reported HCV infection was after delivery were categorized separately, because HCV infection status during pregnancy was not known. The proportion of pregnancies at risk for vertical transmission was calculated as the number of pregnancies among Medicaid recipients who had evidence of HCV infection among all pregnancies in Medicaid recipients.\n\nAmong infants born to women at high risk, Medicaid encounter data were searched for evidence of HCV testing, indicated by a Current Procedural Terminology code or an International Classification of Diseases, 9th and 10th Revisions, Clinical Modification code for HCV infection from the date of birth through June 30, 2016 (last date with complete and available data). Medicaid encounter data for infants were linked by name and date of birth to WEDSS to identify evidence of HCV infection. Infants were classified as having been tested according to recommendations if the infant had an anti-HCV antibody test after age 18 months or two or more HCV RNA tests after age 2 months (3). HCV vertical transmission was determined through WEDSS data and was defined as a positive laboratory report of HCV infection in an infant tested for HCV per recommendations (3).\n\nAmong 146 267 Wisconsin Medicaid recipients who had a birth during 2011-2015, evidence of HCV infection before the delivery date was documented for 608 (0.4 percent) women. Among these women, 180 (30 percent) were classified as being at high risk, two of whom had HIV coinfection; 151 (25 percent) were classified as being at possible risk; and 277 (46 percent) were classified as having an unknown viremic risk. An additional 472 women had an HCV infection reported after their date of delivery (Figure 1 -- [figures and tables available at the source URL]). The proportion of women with an HCV infection before their date of delivery increased 93 percent from 2011 (2.7 per 1000) to 2015 (5.2 per 1000) (Figure 2); an increase from 1 in 368 pregnancies to 1 in 192.\n\nThe median age of women with evidence of HCV viremia during pregnancy was 26 years (range = 18-47 years) (Table). Among the 180 women who had evidence of HCV viremia during pregnancy, 142 (79 percent) were non-Hispanic white, compared with 52 percent of women who did not have any evidence of HCV infection during pregnancy (Table).\n\nAmong 183 infants born to women who had evidence of HCV viremia during pregnancy, 92 (50 percent) were continuously enrolled in Medicaid for \u226518 months (range = 18-66 months). Among these infants, 31 (34 percent) were tested for HCV according to recommendations, including 24 who had an anti-HCV antibody test at age older than 18 months, and 7 who had at least 2 RNA tests at age older than 2 months. Vertical transmission was documented in 7 (4 percent) of the 183 infants born to women with evidence of HCV viremia during pregnancy.\n\nDiscussion\n----------\nConsistent with national and other state studies (2,4), these findings demonstrate that among Wisconsin Medicaid recipients, the rate of HCV infection among pregnant women is increasing. A recent national study used birth certificates to document maternal HCV infection and found that 1 in 308 infants were born to HCV-infected women in 2014 (2). In Wisconsin, an estimated 30 percent of children born to women with HCV infection do not have HCV indicated on their birth certificate (Wisconsin Division of Public Health, unpublished data, 2017). The current study which used surveillance data mandated by state statute to identify maternal HCV infection and therefore might provide more complete HCV case ascertainment, found that the rate of births to Wisconsin Medicaid-recipients with HCV infection approximately doubled from 2011 to 2015, from 2.7 percent to 5.2 percent.\n\nThe age, race, and ethnicity of women with HCV infection during pregnancy in this study were similar to those in previously reported studies (1,2,4) and are consistent with trends among young adults with recent HCV infection in Wisconsin (Wisconsin Division of Public Health, unpublished data, 2016). Of interest is the young age of women who had evidence of HCV infection before delivery and after delivery (median age 27 and 24 years, respectively). Without appropriate treatment for HCV, infants subsequently born to HCV-infected women are at risk for mother-to-infant transmission.\n\nAmong a subset of infants born to women with evidence of HCV viremia during pregnancy, 4 percent had confirmed infection. Prior studies have indicated a lack of adequate HCV testing among children born to HCV-infected women (4,9). In the current study, only 34 percent of Wisconsin Medicaid-recipient infants born to women with evidence of HCV viremia during pregnancy were tested for HCV according to recommendations (3), revealing a substantial gap in monitoring infants at risk for HCV vertical transmission.\n\nThe findings in this report are subject to at least 4 limitations. 1st, statewide surveillance data were used to identify HCV infection status and vertical transmission risk category. These data rely on reports from risk-based HCV testing and laboratory reporting and are likely to underestimate the number of women and children with HCV infection. 2nd, HCV RNA-negative results were not reportable at the time of analysis. Therefore, the number of women with resolved HCV infection is unknown. However, because there are no approved treatment regimens for HCV during pregnancy, it is unlikely that women classified as at high risk had resolved infection before delivery. 3rd, only 50 percent of infants born to women at high risk were continuously enrolled in Medicaid, and therefore, HCV testing data for all infants were unavailable. Finally, this analysis of women and infants enrolled in Medicaid represents approximately 38 percent of the deliveries in Wisconsin during the study period.*\n\nEnhanced identification through HCV screening during pregnancy and public health follow-up to monitor infants at risk for vertical transmission are needed. The current recommendation for identifying HCV-infected pregnant women is through risk-based screening (3,10). Pregnancy and post-pregnancy care might provide an opportune time to test women and link HCV-infected women to HCV care or treatment, because this is a time when a woman might be likely to use health care services. To improve surveillance of HCV vertical transmission, support identification of cases, and evaluate health outcomes of infected infants, the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists\u2020 recently approved of and issued a position statement for reporting and national notification of perinatal HCV infection. Adoption of this position statement by state and local health departments, along with enhanced identification of HCV among women of childbearing age, can improve care for HCV-infected women and infants at risk for HCV vertical transmission\n\n* https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/wish/birth/form.htm\n\u2020 http://c.ymcdn.com/sites/www.cste.org/resource/resmgr/2017PS/2017PSFinal/17-ID-08.pdf\n\nReferences\n----------\n1.

According to the NC Department of Health and Human Services, new cases of hepatitis B were up by 56 percent between 2014 and 2016, and new cases of hepatitis C increased by 69 percent in the same period. Hepatitis C has been on the rise in the state since 2009. The spread is mostly resulting from exposure to infected blood when drug users share needles or other drug paraphernalia.\n\nThere is a strong correlation between the opioid epidemic and the surge in new cases of hepatitis B and C. Prescription pain pills are often liquefied with heat and then injected with a needle. State health officials are encouraging North Carolinians to help stop the spread of hepatitis B and hepatitis C by not sharing needles or other injection equipment and by talking to their physician or local health department about getting tested. Hepatitis B, and less often hepatitis C, can also be spread through sex with an infected partner.\n\nMost hepatitis cases in North Carolina have been in white males ages 21 to 40, with western border counties like Wilkes impacted the most. Adults born between 1945 and 1965 are also more likely to have hepatitis C. Preliminary data shows 172 new cases of hepatitis B and 186 new cases of hepatitis C were reported in North Carolina in 2016. In 2014, there were 110 new cases each of type B and type C reported. The CDC estimates the actual number of infections is likely 7 times higher than the number of reported cases of hepatitis B and 14 times higher for hepatitis C.\n\nAn estimated 110 000 to 150 000 North Carolinians have a chronic hepatitis C infection, and 25 000 to 66 000 have a chronic hepatitis B infection.

That issue leaves community leaders looking at new options to combat the consequences of the epidemic. There continues to be growing concerns that the drug abuse problem in southwest Virginia opens the region up to blood-borne pathogens, like hepatitis B and C, as well as HIV.\n\nAlice Asher is an epidemiologist for the CDC based in Atlanta. She said rural communities are beginning to report increased cases of hepatitis C, which is an infectious disease transmitted through contact with blood. 'We're just seeing communities that really didn't have hepatitis C are reporting large portions of their populations getting it. Again, it goes back to the opioid use epidemic,' Asher said.\n\nIt has been a continuing problem. In 2015, the Lenowisco Health District, consisting of Lee, Wise, and Scott Counties, a region that only makes up about 1.1 percent of Virginia's population had about 33 percent of the state's recorded hepatitis B cases. Today [Wed 28 Jun2017]; the region continues to record cases at a rate higher than the state average.\n\nIt is especially concerning to health officials because this area has a storage of doctors to treat infectious diseases. Dr Sue Cantrell said there are a few located in the Tri-Cities area or Roanoke Valley, but many people who need the services do not have the transportation to get there. Right now, they are using telemedicine services through the University of Virginia.\n\nCantrell serves as the district health director for Lenowisco and is the acting director for the Cumberland Plateau district. 'We really feel like there is a need for primary care doctors to become competent and confident that they can provide good care for people with hepatitis C,' she said.\n\nFor many of these reasons, health leaders are now trying to create an emergency response plan to be ready should the numbers increase rapidly. One consideration is to institute syringe service problems where those using IV drugs can exchange dirty needles for clean ones. A new law set to go into effect on [Sat 1 Jul 2017], makes the option legal in Virginia.\n\n'One of the really important components of a well-run syringe service program is offering ongoing screening for hepatitis B, hepatitis C and HIV are identified as having those infections can take steps to either get treated and reduce their risk of spreading those infections to other people,' Cantrell said.\n\nAll southwest Virginia counties are eligible for the program.\n\n[Byline: Olivia Bailey]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Hepatitis B can be prevented by a vaccine that has been available in the USA since 1982 and has been part of universal immunization in childhood for most of that time.

'By doing that, then it decreases the number of patients that are out on the street and those that are sharing needles,' said Conkle.\n\nHopewell and the Heroin Partnership Project are working together to find a solution to this hepatitis C increase.

The Roanoke Times reported [Sun 2 Jul 2017] that more people could be charged as the investigation continues. Police in Pulaski, Virginia, arrested 4 men in June 2017 for unlicensed tattooing, a misdemeanor offense.

In this large, multicenter, case-control study, we analyzed demographic and HCV risk factor exposure history data from 3871 patients, including 1930 with chronic HCV infection (HCV RNA-positive) and 1941 HCV-negative (HCV antibody-negative) controls. Crude and fully adjusted odds ratios (ORs) of tattoo exposure by multivariate logistic regression in HCV-infected versus controls were determined. As expected, IDU (65.9 percent versus 17.8 percent; P < 0.001), blood transfusion prior to 1992 (22.3 percent versus 11.1 percent; P < 0.001), and history of having one or more tattoos (OR, 3.81; 95 percent CI, 3.23-4.49; P < 0.001) were more common in HCV-infected patients than in control subjects. After excluding all patients with a history of ever injecting drugs and those who had a blood transfusion prior to 1992, a total of 1886 subjects remained for analysis (465 HCV-positive patients and 1421 controls). Among these individuals without traditional risk factors, HCV-positive patients remained significantly more likely to have a history of one or more tattoos after adjustment for age, sex, and race/ethnicity (OR, 5.17; 95 percent CI, 3.75-7.11; P < 0.001).

National Hepatitis Awareness month calls attention to the potentially deadly infection that can cause cirrhosis or liver cancer -- and how to avoid it.\n\n'Cases of acute and chronic hepatitis C in Pierce County are on a dramatic rise, especially among young people,' said Kim Desmarais, Tacoma-Pierce County Health Department viral hepatitis coordinator. 'Before 2013, we saw up to 5 cases a year. Now we see up to 5 cases a month.' In response to the increase in cases, the health department works with medical providers and community partners to report, test, and manage patients with hepatitis C. The department also works to make sure these patients understand ways to stop the spread of the virus, and find treatment options for hepatitis and drug addiction. Injection drug use spreads hepatitis C.\n\nReports the Health Department receives of new hepatitis C cases are just the tip of the iceberg. Many with the infection may not know they have it. The Health Department estimates the new cases reported monthly in Pierce County represent fewer than 10 percent of the actual total. According to the CDC, as many as 3.9 million Americans have hepatitis C, but only half know they're infected. The number of people who have had hepatitis C for a long time but are just now finding out has increased because of a recommendation for doctors to routinely test people in the baby boomer generation.\n\nHeroin and other illegal injection drug use are factors in the nationwide increase of hepatitis C cases, according to the CDC. Shared drugs and syringes spread the infection. In a 2015 survey, the University of Washington Alcohol and Drug Abuse Institute asked 77 needle exchange participants in Pierce County (referenced in the Opioid Trends for Pierce County Report) which drugs they injected. The majority (74 percent) said heroin, 22 percent said methamphetamine. When the ADAI looked at survey results from 18 needle exchange programs in the state, including Pierce County, researchers found 69 percent injected heroin and 22 percent methamphetamine.\n\nHealthcare professionals can now treat and cure hepatitis C in as little as 8 weeks with very few side effects. In the past, medication was not as effective, took almost a year to work, and caused severe side effects. For these reasons, many patients decided not to take them. People with previously diagnosed hepatitis C should ask their doctor for a referral to a specialist who can evaluate them for the newer treatment.\n\nDuring May 2017, people can learn their exposure risk, the consequences if they don't get treatment and the importance of testing. May 19 is National Hepatitis Testing Day.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[2] Pennsylvania - interventions\nDate: Wed 17 May 2017\nSource: Governing Magazine/Tribune News Service, The Philadelphia Inquirer report [edited]\nhttp://www.governing.com/topics/health-human-services/Hepatitis-C-Patients-Will-Receive-Treatment-Through-Medicaid-in-Pa.html\n\n\nUnder pressure from advocacy organizations that had threatened a lawsuit, the Wolf administration said [Tue 16 May 2017], that it would expand Medicaid coverage for treatment of hepatitis C, a major change that many states have put off over fear of spiraling costs. 'Today's announcement means that thousands of vulnerable Pennsylvanians will soon have easier access to pharmaceuticals that can cure hepatitis C,' Department of Human Services Secretary Ted Dallas said in a statement.\n\nUntil now, state policy had been to wait until patients showed signs of liver damage before approving treatment. Allowing earlier treatment was recommended 1 year ago by the department's Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee. As time passed without a decision, observers wondered whether the state was trying to determine how to pay for the highly effective but costly new drugs that have made hepatitis C a curable disease.\n\nNew hepatitis C infections tripled in 5 years, the CDC reported last week, driven largely by the opioid epidemic. The bloodborne hepatitis C virus is easily spread by sharing needles to inject heroin or crushed prescription pain pills. But the virus can grow undetected for decades before causing chronic and sometimes life-threatening liver problems. An estimated 3 million Americans are living with chronic hepatitis C, about half of them undiagnosed. The new website HepVu estimated last month that 142 000 Pennsylvania residents are living with hepatitis C antibodies and 629 died of the disease in 2014, the latest estimates available. It said 91 000 New Jersey residents had antibodies and 446 had died that year.\n\nNew drugs that can effectively cure hepatitis C with minimal side effects began coming on the market several years ago but, as they cost tens of thousands of dollars per patient, many states limited their use to those whose disease had shown up on liver tests, and added other restrictions -- barriers that exist for no other disease.\n\n'Hopefully, what this means is I no longer have to tell patients that their liver isn't sick enough,' said Stacey B. Trooskin, an infectious diseases physician and director of viral hepatitis programs for Philadelphia FIGHT, a nonprofit health and social services organization. Trooskin said she likely had dozens of patients who would now qualify for coverage. She said that policymakers' fears that many Medicaid recipients would get tested and seek treatment were overblown. 'In reality, it will be more like a trickle,' she said.\n\nHepatitis C severity is categorized on a scale of F0 through F4, with F4 being the most severe. Previously, only patients with scores of F2 through F4 were eligible for treatment under Pennsylvania Medicaid unless they had other complications. Effective [1 Jul 2017], patients with scores of F1 will be covered, the state said in its announcement, and those with scores of F0 will be covered beginning [1 Jan 2018].\n\nAbout a dozen other states have loosened restrictions in the last few years, some under pressure from advocates. New Jersey eased its restrictions last year but only down to F2, which has not satisfied physicians or advocacy groups.\n\nIn his statement, Dallas thanked several organizations, including Harvard Law School's Center for Health Law and Policy Innovation, for their help 'on finding a path forward'. The center has sued or threatened to sue several states to force decisions. It reached a settlement with Delaware in 2016.\n\nKevin Costello, the center's litigation director, said that the 'overt threat of a lawsuit' had kept the pressure on Harrisburg to approve the change. Costello said it was not likely to be nearly as costly as some have predicted. For that reason -- as well as the tendency to budget for the short term -- the possibility of future cuts to state Medicaid programs as Congress considers repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act probably was not a significant impediment to Pennsylvania's decision to drop restrictions on hepatitis C coverage, he said.\n\nThe oft-quoted prices -- USD 84 000 for a typical 12-week course of Gilead Sciences' Sovaldi, for example -- have dropped with additional competition, Costello said, and state Medicaid programs have improved their negotiating tactics and applied substantial discounts. Indeed, a Gilead spokesman said in an email late [Tue 16 May 2017] that 'the average Medicaid price per bottle is now less than USD 10 000' -- a total of USD 30 000 for 12 weeks -- 'for states that provide open access to all patients.'\n\nThe Obama administration sent pointed letters to state Medicaid programs about requirements to cover treatment, and challenged pharmaceutical makers to lower prices.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, about 3750 people infected with hepatitis C will likely be affected by the policy change, said Rachel Kostelac, a spokeswoman for the Department of Human Services. 'The state's annual contribution to the Medicaid program is approximately USD 12 billion. The fiscal impact of this policy change is well below one-half of 1 percent of the state's current costs,' Kostelac said in an email response to questions.\n\n'The real problem here,' said Gene Bishop, a retired internist and member of the advisory committee that recommended the change on 17 May 2016, is the pharmaceutical companies, which are charging 'outrageous prices for life-saving treatment.' Bishop made last the 2016 motion recommending that the state's Medicaid program cover treatment for all patients. It was supported by every practitioner on the committee and opposed by every member on the payer side, she recalled, adding that she had not expected the motion to prevail.\n\n[Byline: Don Sapatkin]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[3] Missouri\nDate: Wed 17 May 2017, 6:27 PM\nSource: KSHB [edited]\nhttp://www.kshb.com/news/local-news/hepatitis-c-rising-in-kansas-city-with-opioid-epidemic-rediscover-says\n\n\nThe opioid epidemic in the United States is bringing about another serious problem: Hepatitis C. New data from the CDC shows new Hep C infections almost tripled in 5 years. New infections rose from 850 in 2010 to 2436 in 2015. It's taking a toll in the Kansas City metro, where ReDiscover says 1 in 5 people who walk into its opioid treatment clinic will be diagnosed with Hep C.\n\nOne woman calls herself an old drug addict but is now using her story to help educate others. 'I remember the exact night I got Hep C,' Duffel said. Her drug addiction was so powerful she picked up a heroin needle her infected husband had just used. 'The next minute I'm looking at the syringe thinking, I want that so bad, and I know if I use his needle, it was the only one, I would get Hep C,' she said. 'I remember as I was pushing it in my arm I'm going, I'm sick. I'm going to be really sick. And I was.' She is one of millions of Americans who have Hepatitis C, a disease that destroys the liver.\n\nThe face of this disease is getting younger and younger. Sarita Wise, a nurse at ReDiscover's drug treatment clinic, says the opioid epidemic is to blame. Since January 2017, out of 22 new clients at the clinic, 16 tested positive for Hep C. The CDC says the highest rates of Hep C are among young people who inject drugs, and the same group accounts for 75 percent of new Hep C cases a year.\n\nThe disease is highly contagious. 'Dried blood, equipment used for making drugs, whether it's snorting it or with straws, tourniquets, cotton balls. If they're not aware there are even small amounts of blood on it, they can infect themselves that way,' Wise said.\n\nMany of the patients that go to drug treatment clinics may be low-income and don't go to a primary care physician regularly, so the disease goes undetected. Wise says that's when it does real damage. 'I think that's why we're starting to see the trend in the opioid treatment programs because we're doing that initial screening up-front. That's also to educate them about why they should continue to come to our programs, so they won't engage in risky behaviors,' Wise said.\n\nReDiscover says while it is good news that young people are being diagnosed early on, many people, like this woman, can't afford the Hep C drug treatments. They can cost tens of thousands of dollars, but can also cure the disease. ReDiscover has to rely heavily on federal grants that can help people get access.\n\n[Byline: Sarah Plake]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Most cases of acute hepatitis C are not recognized or reported because they are asymptomatic or anicteric (without jaundice) so the case numbers are likely underreported.\n\nIn the absence of a vaccine for hepatitis C (as are available for hepatitis A and B), infection avoidance techniques such as needle exchange programs and the need for aggressive available programs in counseling, not criminalizing, substance addiction are vitally needed.

That's the highest number of new infections identified in one year since at least 1998. 'That's a pretty high number for us,' said Kristin Sweet, supervisor of the department's hepatitis unit.\n\nHepatitis C is spread through contact with virus-contaminated blood, making the reuse of contaminated needles by users of heroin and other IV drugs a common means of transmission. While the infection can lie dormant for years, it can severely damage the liver over time and result in the need for a liver transplant.\n\nThe classic diagnosis used to be an older Minnesotan who had been symptom-free and whose infection traced back to drug use 30 or more years ago. Now doctors are finding the infection in people 40 and younger, meaning the virus is spreading anew. While the A and B forms of hepatitis are easier to spread, the former mostly through contaminated food and the latter mostly through sexual contact, Sweet said 'hepatitis C is the infection of most concern right now.'\n\nIn some ways, health officials are better positioned to confront an uptick in hepatitis C, because new drugs such as sofosbuvir effectively cure the infection. The Health Department listed 3502 'resolved' infections since 2012, leaving the state with 35 623 people in the state known with the virus.\n\nBut the new drugs are expensive. The state Department of Human Services is spending more than USD 9 million a year on them through its fee-for-service Medical Assistance program, up from less than USD 1 million not long ago. And that increase has come despite restrictions to ensure that recipients are no longer abusing IV drugs, which would make them risks to get reinfected after treatment. Curative drugs should pay off, because they are cheaper than liver transplants. But Sweet noted that prevention is still the cheapest strategy, either by abstaining from IV drugs or using clean needles.\n\nThe Health Department website lists pharmacies that collect used needles and sell clean ones without prescriptions. 'Certainly we recommend that people who are at risk get screened,' Sweet said, 'so they can make decisions with that knowledge in mind.'\n\n[Byline: Jeremy Olson]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Most cases of acute hepatitis C are not recognized or reported because they are asymptomatic or anicteric (without jaundice) so the case numbers are likely underreported.\n\nIn the absence of a vaccine for hepatitis C (as are available for hepatitis A and B), infection avoidance techniques such as needle exchange programs and the need for aggressive available programs in counseling, not criminalizing, substance addiction are vitally needed.

Recent surveillance data showed increased rates of HCV infection among adolescents and adults who are predominantly white, live in nonurban areas, and have a history of injection drug use. American birth certificate data were used to analyze trends and geographic variations in rates of HCV infection among women giving birth during 2009-2014. Birth certificates from Tennessee were used to examine individual characteristics and outcomes associated with HCV infection, using a multivariable model to calculate adjusted odds of HCV-related diagnosis in pregnancy among women with live births. During 2009-2014, HCV infection present at the time of delivery among pregnant women from states reporting HCV on the birth certificate increased 89 percent, from 1.8 to 3.4 per 1000 live births. The highest infection rate in 2014 (22.6 per 1000 live births) was in West Virginia; the rate in Tennessee was 10.1. In adjusted analyses of Tennessee births, the odds of HCV infection were approximately 3-fold higher among women residing in rural counties than among those in large urban counties, 4.5-fold higher among women who smoked cigarettes during pregnancy, and nearly 17-fold higher among women with concurrent hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection.\n\nHCV infection among pregnant women is an increasing and potentially modifiable threat to maternal and child health. Clinicians and public health officials should consider individual and population-level opportunities for prevention and risk mitigation.\n\nData from 2009-2014 were obtained from the National Vital Statistics System and Tennessee Department of Health vital records. The outcome of interest was HCV infection in pregnant women at the time of delivery (maternal HCV infection) as indicated on the infant's birth certificate. The maternal HCV infection rate per 1000 deliveries in Tennessee was compared with that from hospital billing data in the Tennessee Hospital Discharge Data System, an all-payer administrative database that includes data for all inpatient admissions in the state. National data were compared with nationally weighted estimates obtained from the National Inpatient Sample, the largest all payer database in the USA.\n\nThe 1st phase of the analysis examined rates of maternal HCV infection reported on infant birth certificates to approximate HCV infection among pregnant women in the USA. Because HCV infection is a revised 2003 birth certificate item, states gradually reported this item over time as they adopted the revised certificate; therefore, rates were calculated based on records from all states with available data at any time during 2009 and 2014. The 2nd phase of the analysis used data from Tennessee vital records to assess sociodemographic characteristics, gravidity, health behaviors, and other infections during pregnancy associated with HCV infection in pregnancy. Overall, <1 percent of data for variables included in the study were missing, with the exception of timing of prenatal care, which was missing for 6.2 percent of records. To account for missing data, multiple imputation using chained equations with 20 imputations was used. A multivariable logistic regression model was fit to the data to determine increased odds of HCV infection in pregnancy, simultaneously adjusting for maternal age, education, marital status, race/ethnicity, county of residence, number of previous pregnancies, late or no prenatal care, smoking during pregnancy, and other infections present at delivery, including chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis, herpes simplex virus, and HBV. The statistical significance level was set to p<0.05 for all tests. The study was approved by the Tennessee Department of Health's institutional review board.\n\nDuring 2009-2014, the prevalence of maternal HCV infection among reporting states increased 89 percent, from 1.8 to 3.4 per 1000 live births (p<0.001). There was substantial state-to-state variation in maternal HCV rates: in 2014, the highest rate (22.6 per 1000 live births) was in West Virginia, and the lowest (0.7) was in Hawaii (Figure 1 [for figures and table, see original URL - Mod.LL]). In Tennessee, the prevalence of maternal HCV infection increased 163 percent, from 3.8 per 1000 live births in 2009 to 10.0 in 2014 (p<0.001). Within Tennessee, there was substantial variation among 95 counties, with the highest rates in the 52 Appalachian counties in the eastern part of the state. For example, in 2014, Campbell County had the highest rate in Tennessee (78 per 1000 births); 19 other counties had rates of less or equal 1 per 1000 births, including 18 counties that reported no cases (Figure 2). Analysis of maternal HCV infection rates based on hospital discharge data resulted in similar findings.\n\nIn adjusted analyses of Tennessee births from 2009 to 2014, compared with women without HCV infection, women with diagnosed HCV at the time of live birth had higher odds of having a high school education or less, being unmarried, having late or no prenatal care, and smoking cigarettes. Compared with pregnant non-Hispanic white women, non-Hispanic black women had nearly 80 percent lower odds, and Hispanic women nearly 70 percent lower odds of having a diagnosis of HCV. Residing in a rural county was also associated with higher odds of maternal HCV infection. When compared with large central metro areas (counties with more than 1 000 000 population), the odds of HCV infection among pregnant women from rural areas (counties with less than 50 000 population) were 3-fold higher. Concurrent infections also were associated with higher odds of having an HCV diagnosis, with HBV infection resulting in nearly 17-fold increased odds of HCV (Table).\n\nDiscussion\n----------\nFrom 2009 to 2014, the prevalence of HCV infection among US women giving birth in reporting states nearly doubled. This increase in maternal HCV infection mirrors increases in HCV infection incidence among adults, particularly nonpregnant young adults in the USA. A recent study identified a similar increase in HCV prevalence among women with recent live births (2); this study builds upon those findings, identifying several patient-level characteristics associated with maternal HCV infection, including white race, rural county residence, cigarette smoking during pregnancy, having a high school education or less, and having a concurrent HBV infection. In the USA, CDC and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommend selective screening of pregnant women at high risk for HCV infection (i.e., history of injection drug use or long-term hemodialysis) (3). These data might inform expansion of the definition of women at risk, thereby improving clinical detection, particularly in areas of a state reporting increasing or high rates of incident HCV infection.\n\nThe recent increase in maternal HCV infection appears to have disproportionately affected rural and white populations; states and Tennessee counties with the highest prevalence of HCV infection among pregnant women in 2014 were in predominately Appalachian regions. A recent analysis of state surveillance data examining acute HCV infections in the general population found a near doubling of cases in the USA during 2006-2012, and also found that states in or near Appalachian regions had the highest numbers of cases (4), suggesting that primary prevention and testing and treatment strategies for HCV infection could be targeted to these populations and areas at high risk.\n\nThis increase in HCV infection is particularly concerning in light of recent research highlighting poor follow-up of HCV-exposed infants (5). The rate of vertical transmission from infected mothers to infants is estimated at 6 percent (11 percent if the mother is coinfected with human immunodeficiency virus [HIV]) (6); therefore, it is important that exposed infants be followed for evidence of seroconversion. Because passively acquired maternal antibodies can persist for up to 18 months, anti-HCV antibody tests cannot be completed until that time; however, testing for HCV RNA can be performed earlier (7). A recent study in Philadelphia found that only 16 percent of HCV-exposed infants were appropriately followed (5), suggesting that infected infants might go undetected.\n\nThe increase in maternal HCV infection coincides with the rising heroin and prescription opioid epidemics occurring in the USA that have also disproportionately affected rural and white populations (8, 9). There has also been a recent surge in opioid use among pregnant women (8). Whereas HCV infections have historically been associated with heroin use, a recent outbreak of HIV and HCV in rural Indiana demonstrates that these infections can also be transmitted through use of injectable forms of prescription opioids (10).\n\nThe findings in this report are subject to at least 3 limitations. First, vital records data rely on accurate coding of birth certificates; some variables such as HCV might be undercoded, and misclassification bias might occur. However, evaluation of hospital administrative data reporting of HCV infections suggests that this effect is small. Second, the proportion of live births from which data were collected on HCV status increased during the study period, as more states adopted the revised certificate each year. Because the original reporting states in 2009 were not held constant over time for this analysis, it is possible the trend could be subject to ascertainment bias; however, 2 additional confirmatory analyses were performed: 1) comparison with the National Inpatient Sample demonstrated similar rates of HCV infection during 2009-2013 (1.8 per 1000 to 3.1 per 1000), and 2) the same trend analysis was performed holding the original 28 reporting states in 2009 constant. Results were the same as when using all 47 states that incorporated reporting over time. Because women are not universally screened for HCV in pregnancy, these estimates and analyses do not represent the actual prevalence of HCV in pregnant women. However, the findings of increased disease prevalence among white and rural populations are similar to those of recent studies in nonpregnant populations (4). Instances of multiple births might have resulted in a slight overestimation of rates of maternal HCV infection. Finally, it is important to consider that HCV infections in a given state might represent not only the prevalence of a condition but also the public health efforts implemented to detect and treat the infection.\n\nThe prevalence of maternal HCV infection appears to have increased sharply in the USA, presenting concerns for maternal and child health. Ensuring that women of childbearing age have access to HCV testing and treatment and consideration of universal screening among women of reproductive age residing in areas with high HCV prevalence might mitigate risk and prevent transmission.\n\nReferences\n----------\n1.

We performed an extensive literature search of PubMed, MEDLINE, and EMBASE through [1 Dec 2015]. The odds ratios (ORs) of HCV infection and IUGR/LBW were calculated and reported with 95 percent confidence intervals (95 percent CIs). Statistical analysis was performed using RevMen 5.3 and Stata 10.0. Seven studies involving 4 185 414 participants and 5094 HCV infection cases were included. Significant associations between HCV infection and IUGR (OR\u200a=\u200a1.53, 95 percent CI: 1.40-1.68, fixed effect model) as well as LBW were observed (OR\u200a=\u200a1.97, 95 percent CI: 1.43-2.71, random effect model). The results still indicated consistencies after adjusting for multiple risk factors which could affect fetal growth, including maternal age, parity, maternal smoking, alcohol abuse, drugs abuse, coinfected with HBV/HIV and preeclampsia. Our findings suggested that maternal HCV infection was significantly associated with an increased risk of impaired intrauterine fetal growth. In clinical practice, a closer monitoring of intrauterine fetal growth by a series of ultrasound might be necessary for HCV-infected pregnant population.\n- Mod.LL\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/244.]", "summary": "[Authors: Patrick SW, Bauer AM, Warren MD, Jones TF and Wester C]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Hepatitis C infection during pregnancy can also be associated with intrauterine fetal growth restriction as reported in this paper:\nHuang QT, Hang LL, Zhong M, Gao YF, Luo ML and Yu YH: Maternal HCV infection is associated with intrauterine fetal growth disturbance: A meta-analysis of observational studies.

These data might inform expansion of the definition of women at risk, thereby improving clinical detection, particularly in areas of a state reporting increasing or high rates of incident HCV infection. From 2009 to 2014, the prevalence of HCV infection among US women giving birth in reporting states nearly doubled. Recent surveillance data showed increased rates of HCV infection among adolescents and adults who are predominantly white, live in nonurban areas, and have a history of injection drug use. This increase in maternal HCV infection mirrors increases in HCV infection incidence among adults, particularly nonpregnant young adults in the USA. \n\nHCV infection among pregnant women is an increasing and potentially modifiable threat to maternal and child health. For example, in 2014, Campbell County had the highest rate in Tennessee (78 per 1000 births); 19 other counties had rates of less or equal 1 per 1000 births, including 18 counties that reported no cases (Figure 2). The 2nd phase of the analysis used data from Tennessee vital records to assess sociodemographic characteristics, gravidity, health behaviors, and other infections during pregnancy associated with HCV infection in pregnancy. \n\nThe increase in maternal HCV infection coincides with the rising heroin and prescription opioid epidemics occurring in the USA that have also disproportionately affected rural and white populations (8, 9). In the USA, CDC and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommend selective screening of pregnant women at high risk for HCV infection (i.e., history of injection drug use or long-term hemodialysis) (3). Concurrent infections also were associated with higher odds of having an HCV diagnosis, with HBV infection resulting in nearly 17-fold increased odds of HCV (Table). Our findings suggested that maternal HCV infection was significantly associated with an increased risk of impaired intrauterine fetal growth. The prevalence of maternal HCV infection appears to have increased sharply in the USA, presenting concerns for maternal and child health. There was substantial state-to-state variation in maternal HCV rates: in 2014, the highest rate (22.6 per 1000 live births) was in West Virginia, and the lowest (0.7) was in Hawaii (Figure 1 [for figures and table, see original URL - Mod.LL]). Significant associations between HCV infection and IUGR (OR\u200a=\u200a1.53, 95 percent CI: 1.40-1.68, fixed effect model) as well as LBW were observed (OR\u200a=\u200a1.97, 95 percent CI: 1.43-2.71, random effect model). --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nHepatitis C virus (HCV) affects an estimated 3.5 million people in the USA (1), making it the most common bloodborne infection in the country. Analysis of maternal HCV infection rates based on hospital discharge data resulted in similar findings. Koneru A, Nelson N, Hariri S, et al: Increased hepatitis C virus (HCV) detection in women of childbearing age and potential risk for vertical transmission--United States and Kentucky, 2011-2014. The highest infection rate in 2014 (22.6 per 1000 live births) was in West Virginia; the rate in Tennessee was 10.1. Ensuring that women of childbearing age have access to HCV testing and treatment and consideration of universal screening among women of reproductive age residing in areas with high HCV prevalence might mitigate risk and prevent transmission. Zibbell JE, Iqbal K, Patel RC, et al: Increases in hepatitis C virus infection related to injection drug use among persons aged \u226430 years--Kentucky, Tennessee, Virginia, and West Virginia, 2006-2012. Residing in a rural county was also associated with higher odds of maternal HCV infection. The odds ratios (ORs) of HCV infection and IUGR/LBW were calculated and reported with 95 percent confidence intervals (95 percent CIs).", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "hepatitis b", "hepatitis c"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2021-03-29 00:00:00", "2021-03-08 00:00:00", "2012-03-25 00:00:00", "2009-03-25 00:00:00", "2015-03-25 00:00:00", "2014-03-25 00:00:00", "2003-03-25 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "USA", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "West Virginia", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "Kentucky", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "Virginia", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "Baltimore", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "Campbell County", "country": "New Zealand"}, {"location": "Indiana", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "Hariri S", "country": "Lebanon"}, {"location": "Philadelphia", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "LL", "country": "Micronesia"}, {"location": "Tennessee", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "Zibbell JE", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "US", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Hawaii", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "United States", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Holmberg", "country": "Canada"}, {"location": "the United States", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "5009439", "headline": "PRO/EDR> Hepatitis B & C - Pakistan: (Sindh)", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=5009439", "date": "2017-05-03 05:12:15", "main_text": "HEPATITIS B & C - PAKISTAN: (SINDH)\n***********************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Tue 2 May 2017\nSource: Daily Times [edited]\nhttp://dailytimes.com.pk/pakistan/02-May-17/hepatitis-cases-on-the-rise-in-larkana\n\n\nAs many as 30 hepatitis B & C patients were detected out of 300 who reached the Blood Screening Camp organized by the doctors and lab technicians of the Hepatitis Treatment & Prevention Center of Chandka Medical College Hospital (CMCH), Larkana, here on 1 May 2017 at Town Hall.

MassHealth saw the cost of hepatitis C drugs exceed USD 318 million from 2014 to 2016, and that number is only expected to grow as the state expands coverage for those patients. The program relaxed its requirements for coverage in August 2016.

The WHO Global hepatitis report, 2017 indicates that the large majority of these people lack access to life-saving testing and treatment. As a result, millions of people are at risk of a slow progression to chronic liver disease, cancer, and death.\n\n'Viral hepatitis is now recognized as a major public health challenge that requires an urgent response,' said Dr Margaret Chan, WHO Director-General. 'Vaccines and medicines to tackle hepatitis exist, and WHO is committed to helping ensure these tools reach all those who need them.'\n\nIncreasing mortality, new infections\n-----------------------------------------------\nViral hepatitis caused 1.34 million deaths in 2015, a number comparable to deaths caused by tuberculosis and HIV. But while mortality from tuberculosis and HIV has been declining, deaths from hepatitis are on the increase.\n\nApproximately 1.75 million people were newly infected with HCV in 2015, bringing the global total of people living with hepatitis C to 71 million.\nAlthough overall deaths from hepatitis are increasing, new infections of HBV are falling, thanks to increased coverage of HBV vaccination among children. Globally, 84 percent of children born in 2015 received the 3 recommended doses of hepatitis B vaccine. Between the pre-vaccine era (which, according to the year of introduction can range from the 1980s to the early 2000s) and 2015, the proportion of children under 5 years of age with new infections fell from 4.7 percent to 1.3 percent. However, an estimated 257 million people, mostly adults born before the introduction of the HBV vaccine, were living with chronic hepatitis B infection in 2015.\n\nHepatitis B levels vary widely across WHO regions with the WHO African Region and WHO Western Pacific Region sharing the greatest burden.\n\n- WHO Western Pacific Region: 6.2 percent of population (115 million people)\n- WHO African Region: 6.1 percent of population (60 million people)\n- WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region: 3.3 percent of population (21 million people)\n- WHO South-East Asia Region: 2 percent of population (39 million people)\n- WHO European Region: 1.6 percent of population (15 million people)\n- WHO Region of the Americas: 0.7 percent of population (7 million people)\n\nToday, unsafe injections in health care settings and injecting drug use are considered to be the most common routes of HCV transmissions. HCV prevalence by WHO region is:\n- WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region: 2.3 percent of population (15 million people)\n- WHO European Region: 1.5 percent of population (14 million people)\n- WHO African Region: 1 percent of population (11 million people)\n- WHO Region of the Americas: 1 percent of population (7 million people)\n- WHO Western Pacific Region: 1 percent of population (14 million people)\n- WHO South-East Asia Region: 0.5 percent of population (10 million people)\n\nThere is currently no vaccine against HCV, and access to treatment for HBV and HCV is still low.\n\nWHO's Global Health Sector Strategy on viral hepatitis aims to test 90 percent and treat 80 percent of people with HBV and HCV by 2030. The report notes that just 9 percent of all HBV infections and 20 percent of all HCV infections were diagnosed in 2015. An even smaller fraction - 8 percent of those diagnosed with HBV infection (1.7 million people) were on treatment, and only 7 percent of those diagnosed with HCV infection (1.1 million people) had started curative treatment during that year [2015].\n\nHBV infection requires lifelong treatment, and WHO currently recommends the medicine tenofovir, already widely used in HIV treatment. Hepatitis C can be cured within a relatively short time using the highly effective direct-acting antivirals (DAAs).\n\n'We are still at an early stage of the viral hepatitis response, but the way forward looks promising,' said Dr Gottfried Hirnschall, Director of WHO's Department of HIV and the Global Hepatitis Programme. 'More countries are making hepatitis services available for people in need - a diagnostic test costs less than USD 1 and the cure for hepatitis C can be below USD 200. But the data clearly highlight the urgency with which we must address the remaining gaps in testing and treatment.'\n\nWHO's Global hepatitis report, 2017 demonstrates that despite challenges, some countries are taking successful steps to scale-up hepatitis services. China achieved high coverage (96 percent) for the timely birth dose of HBV vaccines, and reached the hepatitis B control goal of less than 1 percent prevalence in children under the age of 5 in 2015. Mongolia improved uptake of hepatitis treatment by including HBV and HCV medicines in its National Health Insurance scheme, which covers 98 percent of its population. In Egypt, generic competition has reduced the price of a 3-month cure for hepatitis C, from USD 900 in 2015, to less than USD 200 in 2016. Today in Pakistan, the same course costs as little as USD 100.\n\nImproving access to hepatitis C cure received a boost at the end of March 2017, when WHO prequalified the generic active pharmaceutical ingredient of sofosbuvir. This step will enable more countries to produce affordable hepatitis medicines.\n\nWHO's Global hepatitis report, 2017 aims to provide a starting point for hepatitis elimination by indicating baseline statistics on HBV and HCV infections, including mortality, and coverage levels of key interventions. Hepatitis B and C - the 2 main types out of 5 different hepatitis infections - are responsible for 96 percent of overall hepatitis mortality.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The full report can be found at:\nhttp://www.who.int/hepatitis/publications/global-hepatitis-report2017/en/.\n\nBoth HBV and HCV remain significant cause of chronic liver disease manifest by cirrhosis of the liver and hepatocellular carcinoma.

As per health department sources hepatitis C virus is more active in rural area including Malerkotla in Sangrur district. Some villages of Dhuri region are also affected with the virus.\n\nTransmission of the virus include injecting drug use through sharing of syringes and needles and in health care settings due to the reuse or inadequate sterilisation of medical equipment, especially syringes and needles. HCV can also be transmitted by the transfusion of unscreened blood and blood products, sexually, and can be passed from an infected mother to her baby; however these modes of transmission are not common.

Notes from the field. Hepatitis C transmission from inappropriate reuse of saline flush syringes for multiple patients in an acute care general hospital - Texas, 2015. MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep 2017;66:258-260. DOI:http://dx.doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm6609a4.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn October 2015, the Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS) was notified that a hospital telemetry unit nurse had been reusing saline flush prefilled syringes in the intravenous (IV) lines of multiple patients, a risk factor for patient-to-patient transmission of bloodborne pathogens (1). This practice was discovered through an investigation undertaken by the hospital after the nurse was observed to frequently leave a partially filled syringe near a computer work station. State, regional, and local health departments, with consultation from CDC, collaborated with the hospital to investigate infection prevention lapses, assess risk to patients, perform patient notification, and provide bloodborne pathogen testing.\n\nUpon interview, the nurse reported reusing syringes during the previous 6 months, erroneously believing that this was a safe, cost-saving measure if no fluids were withdrawn into the syringe before injection of the saline flush (1,2). The nurse had been working in this unit for 18 months, had not worked at another health care facility before or during employment at the hospital, and reported that this practice was not taught by the hospital. The hospital voluntarily notified patients and offered bloodborne pathogen screening to patients who might have been cared for by the nurse during employment from April 2014 to October 2015, when the practice was recognized and corrected (3). Because all telemetry unit patients were required to have IV access, all patients cared for on the unit during shifts worked by the nurse were included in the notification.\n\nDuring October 2015, notification letters were sent to patients via both certified and registered mail to inform them of a possible bloodborne pathogen exposure and a need for laboratory testing for hepatitis B (HBV), hepatitis C (HCV), and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The notification included locations where testing would be offered, a laboratory order form, and a 24-hour hospital hotline number for questions and concerns. The hospital provided testing free of charge through a commercial laboratory that coordinated testing at many satellite locations. Recommended laboratory testing consisted of a baseline screening test and a follow-up test at 6 months after the last potential exposure; exposure was defined as the last time a patient was on the telemetry unit while the nurse was working.\n\nPatients who did not have bloodborne pathogen testing or whose letter had been returned as undeliverable, and who had valid contact telephone information were telephoned individually by hospital staff members to provide notification, encourage testing, and request a current mailing address. Notification materials were re-sent to contacted patients; for those who could not be reached, additional address investigation was performed by DSHS using a search of state databases. As of October 2016, among 392 potentially exposed living patients, 262 (67 per cent) had completed initial screening, and 182 (46 per cent) had completed all recommended testing.\n\nAmong the 262 patients tested at least once for HBV, HCV, and HIV, 4 patients with newly diagnosed bloodborne pathogen infections were identified: 2 with HBV and 2 with HCV. A patient with known pre-existing chronic HCV infection (patient A) had been hospitalized on the telemetry unit on the same day as patient B, 1 of the patients with newly diagnosed HCV. The 2nd patient with newly diagnosed HCV infection did not share overlapping hospital days with any patient with known HCV infection, and the 2 patients with newly diagnosed HBV infection did not share overlapping hospital days with each other or any patient with a known HBV infection. Thus, no further epidemiologic evidence was identified that linked these 3 patients with newly diagnosed infections to a potential source patient.\n\nSpecimens from patients A and B were sent to the laboratory in CDC's Division of Viral Hepatitis for genotyping and molecular sequencing. Both patients were infected with HCV genotype 4a, which represents approximately 1 per cent of all infections in the USA. Quasispecies (HCV intra-genotype variants) analysis was performed, and <0.38 per cent nucleotide variation among intrahost HCV sequences from these 2 patients was detected (figure [for figure, see original URL. - Mod.LL]). This result indicates transmission linkage between these 2 patients (4). Further epidemiologic investigation indicated that it was unlikely that these 2 patients had any contact outside the facility.\n\nTaken together, these findings indicate that at least 1 HCV infection was likely transmitted in the telemetry unit as a result of inappropriate reuse and sharing of saline flush syringes for multiple patients. This investigation illustrates a need for ongoing education and oversight of health care providers regarding safe injection practices. Hospitals and other settings where injections are prepared and administered should perform routine audits (1-3). Syringe reuse, if identified, should be immediately corrected and patient notification should be included as part of the institutional response (1-3).\n\nReferences\n----------\n1.

When her blood test came back positive, she was convinced her life was over. 'I was basically devastated,' she said. 'I thought I'd never be able to have children without giving it to my child. I never thought I'd be able to have a normal life with this crazy black cloud hanging over me.'\n\nIt was the 1st time after a span of drug use that started with prescription narcotics and led to intravenous [IV] heroin use that she had to get a blood test - she had previously avoided trips to the doctor, ashamed to show her track marks. She waited a week before she was able to meet with a counselor, who informed her that there was a cure for Hepatitis C. It took another year and a half to get clean and sober, after which she started the lengthy process of getting treated for Hepatitis C, covered by New Hampshire's Medicaid program. She had to prove to her primary care and gastrointestinal doctor that she was truly on the road to recovery and abstaining from drugs and alcohol in order to even start the expensive cure - a drug called Harvoni, which cost 90 000 USD.\n\nToday, she is still in recovery, holding down a steady job and working as a recovery coach on the Seacoast. She is also cured of hepatitis C. 'The state of New Hampshire paid for that for me, and I'm very grateful for that,' she said. She calls it one of the many 'little gifts that recovery has given me.'\n\nDrug overdose deaths are the most obvious signs of New Hampshire's opioid epidemic, but an additional public health crisis is looming. Doctors across the state say they are seeing more and more patients with serious infections such as hepatitis C, [HIV] and bacterial endocarditis, caused by intravenous drug use, most commonly through shared needles.\n\nIt's difficult to get a handle on the number of Hepatitis C cases in New Hampshire. Individual providers across the state started to report cases to the state's Department of Health and Human Services late in 2016, but there's not enough data to release yet, state officials said. Furthermore, because individual providers are tasked with reporting, most hospitals don't keep in-house numbers. At a recent state Senate hearing on a bill to set up a needle exchange program, one epidemiologist who studies infectious disease from IV drug use compared the Granite State's Hepatitis C problem with that of Tijuana, Mexico.\n\nAt a suboxone program at Franklin Regional Hospital, Dr. Paul Racicot estimates that about 50 percent of his patients are positive for Hepatitis C. 'What astonished us was the rate, period,' Racicot said. 'I didn't expect a Hep C rate over 50 percent.' Almost all of his patients contract the disease from sharing needles to inject drugs, he said.\n\nIf hepatitis C is left untreated, it's a serious disease that [can] eventually cause serious liver damage. The good news is there is a cure for the disease. The bad news is how expensive it is: treatment can run from about 65 000 to 100 000 USD.\n\nRacicot figures that if 100 of his patients have hepatitis C and need to be treated at a cost of 100 000 USD per patient, that's 10 million USD 'to treat a preventable disease.' 'It is a public policy problem because someone's going to have to pay,' Racicot said. 'That's just us. We're just one small little catchment area in New Hampshire.'\n\nOut of 12 New Hampshire hospitals the Monitor contacted, Catholic Medical Center in Manchester is the only 1 with a complete data set of hepatitis C cases over the past 3 years. The hospital tracks cases related to IV drug use, as well as the ones that are not. From 2014 to 2016, CMC saw the number of hepatitis C cases in patients who were drug users rise from 157 to 289. At the same time, the numbers of hepatitis C cases in patients who were not drug users fell from 1035 to 807.\n\nThe hospital's Chief Medical Officer Dr. William Goodman is quick to say the data aren't perfect but they show a distinct trend - among drug users, hepatitis C cases have nearly doubled. 'They're rising pretty substantially,' he said.\n\nPortsmouth Regional Hospital also provided the Monitor with numbers of hepatitis C cases it's seen over the past few years; however, the hospital does not separate out drug-related and non-drug-related cases. In 2014, the Portsmouth hospital had 53 cases, which went up to 65 in 2015 and 87 in 2016. A total of 15 more cases have been identified in the first 3 months of 2017.\n\nAt Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center's Perinatal Addiction program for pregnant and postpartum women in Lebanon, 29 percent of patients screened from 2014 to 2016 tested positive for the hepatitis C antibody; of those, 52 percent had active disease.\n\n'That's just an astounding number,' said Dr. Bryan Marsh, chief of infectious disease at Dartmouth-Hitchcock. 'Those who have a history of injection drug use have a very, very high prevalence of Hepatitis C. In some communities in the region, it's scarily high.'\n\nMany health professionals say the reason numbers are rising is the proliferation of dirty needles in New Hampshire. The state is the only one in New England without a needle exchange [program]; health and addiction experts recently testified at a Senate hearing that users are injecting with dirty needles because there are few clean ones available. A bill that would establish a needle exchange recently passed the state Senate and now will be voted on by members of the House.\n\n[Byline: Ella Nilsen]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[In the absence of a vaccine, infection avoidance techniques such as needle exchange programs and the need for aggressive available programs in counseling, not criminalizing, substance addiction are vitally needed.

The number of new infections nearly tripled in 5 years, to about 2400 in 2015. The virus is spread by sharing needles to inject drugs, and the increase coincided with a surge in heroin use. But officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention think the reported infections are only a fraction of the actual number. Most people don't get sick for many years, so they aren't tested and don't know they are infected. The CDC estimates that the number of infections in 2015 was 34 000, or twice as many as the estimate for 2010. The biggest jump in new infections is in people ages 20 to 29, the CDC said.\n\nThe hepatitis C virus spreads through the blood but does most of its damage by infecting the liver. It can lead to cirrhosis or liver cancer. In recent years, new hepatitis C drugs hit the market that can cure the infection in only a few months. But they are expensive -- a course of treatment can costs tens of thousands of dollars.\n\nThe CDC also released national hepatitis C death figures: nearly 20 000 deaths in 2015. The number hasn't changed much recently but that figure reflects a different group of infected people -- baby boomers. The apparent leveling off may be due to a push to test all baby boomers for the virus and the treatment improvements, said the CDC's Dr Jonathan Mermin. Of the 3.5 million Americans living with hepatitis, most were born between 1945 and 1965 and were infected decades ago, according to the CDC.\n\nBefore widespread screening of blood donations began in 1992, the virus was also spread through blood transfusions. New cases fell to under 900 nearly 15 years ago and stayed at that level until they rose sharply in 2011. That was around the time heroin use began increasing, as drug abusers caught up in the opioid crisis shifted from prescription painkillers to heroin.\n\n[Byline: Mike Stobbe]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[2]\nDate: Fri 12 May 2017\nSource: MMWR 66(18); 465-469 [edited]\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/66/wr/mm6618a2.htm?s_cid=mm6618a2_w\n\n\nHepatitis C is associated with more deaths in the USA than 60 other infectious diseases reported to CDC combined. Despite curative hepatitis C virus (HCV) therapies and known preventive measures to interrupt transmission, new HCV infections have increased in recent years (1,2). Injection drug use is the primary risk factor for new HCV infections (2). One potential strategy to decrease the prevalence of HCV is to create and strengthen public health laws and policies aimed specifically at reducing transmission risks among persons who inject drugs. To evaluate factors affecting access to HCV preventive and treatment services, CDC assessed state laws governing access to safe injection equipment and Medicaid policies related to sobriety requirements for approval of HCV treatment for persons who inject drugs. Acute HCV incidence rates were obtained from CDC's National Notifiable Disease Surveillance System (NNDSS). States were categorized based on analysis of laws related to access to clean needles and syringes and Medicaid HCV treatment policies associated with sobriety requirements. In 2015, HCV incidence remained high in the USA, with rates in 17 states exceeding the national average. A total of 3 states were determined to have state laws and Medicaid policies capable of comprehensively preventing and treating HCV among persons who inject drugs. Opportunities exist for states to adopt laws and policies that could help increase access to HCV preventive and treatment services reducing the number of persons at risk for HCV transmission and disease.\n\nHCV transmission primarily occurs through percutaneous exposure to blood; thus, injection drug use is an important risk factor (3). HCV incidence has increased 294 percent nationally from 2010 to 2015 (4). This increase in acute cases of HCV is largely attributed to injection drug use (2). Access to safe injection equipment for persons who inject drugs can prevent HCV infection (3), and HCV therapy can cure >90 percent of infected persons, thereby reducing the risk for HCV-associated mortality and transmission of HCV to others. State laws and policies can enhance or limit access to HCV prevention and treatment services, particularly for persons who inject drugs (5). For example, recent studies have shown that states policies can reduce deaths associated with drug overdose (6).\n\nIncidence of HCV per 100 000 population was calculated based on acute cases of HCV reported electronically by each state and the District of Columbia (hereafter referred to as states) to NNDSS in 2015 and U.S. Census data. Existing state laws in all states related to access to clean needles and syringes by persons who inject drugs were reviewed using the legal database WestlawNext. Once the relevant laws were identified, the legal findings were corroborated with findings from the Syringe Distribution Laws data set on LawAtlas.* The state laws were then provided to health departments in all states for review of accuracy of interpretation.\n\nThree types of laws related to access to clean needles and syringes were researched: 1) authorization of syringe exchange programs; 2) the scope of drug paraphernalia laws; and 3) retail sale of needles and syringes. Two independent analysts qualitatively assessed the laws based on the presence of 5 elements in each type of law, and the potential impact of these elements on access to clean needles and syringes, in a method similar to other legal analyses (7). The elements assessed included whether state laws explicitly 1) authorize syringe exchange statewide or in selected jurisdictions; 2) exempt needles or syringes from the definition of drug paraphernalia; 3) decriminalize the possession and distribution of syringes or needles for participants of a legally authorized syringe exchange program; 4) allow for a person to avoid criminal prosecution for possession of drug paraphernalia by disclosing to an arresting officer that they possess a needle or sharp object; and 5) allow for the retail sale of syringes without a prescription to persons who inject drugs. The analysts grouped the laws into five categories (most comprehensive, more comprehensive, moderately comprehensive, less comprehensive, and least comprehensive) based on the presence or absence of the five elements.\n\nData on Medicaid fee-for-service HCV treatment policies were collected from a report developed by the Center for Health Law and Policy Innovation of Harvard Law School and the National Viral Hepatitis Roundtable on Medicaid access to hepatitis C treatment (8). The Medicaid treatment policies were provided to the states for review of accuracy and updated, as needed. Based on the length of required sobriety from alcohol and/or drugs provided by the states, CDC characterized the state's Medicaid treatment policy as either restrictive or permissive depending on the presence or absence of a sobriety requirement. For this analysis, any required period of sobriety, including requirements that a person could not have any evidence of active injection drug use, was considered a barrier and, therefore, restrictive. Screening and counseling requirements were not considered barriers, and were therefore categorized as permissive, given that those services did not necessarily require a referral or postponement of treatment. A state policy that did not require any period of sobriety was also categorized as permissive.\n\nIn 2015, the national reported acute HCV incidence rate was 0.8 per 100 000 persons, representing 2436 new infections reported from 40 state health departments; with adjustment to account for under ascertainment and underreporting, the reported number of cases is estimated to represent 33 900 new HCV infections (4). Incidence in 17 states exceeded the national average, including 7 states with rates at least twice the national average (Figure 1 [for figures, see original URL - Mod.LL].\n\nEighteen states had laws that were categorized as least comprehensive related to the prevention of HCV transmission among persons who inject drugs. In particular, these 18 states had no laws authorizing a syringe exchange program, decriminalizing possession and distribution of syringes and needles, or allowing the retail sale of syringes without a prescription. Three states (Maine, Nevada, and Utah) had the most comprehensive laws related to prevention; each state had laws that authorized syringe exchange without jurisdictional limitations, removed barriers to possessing and distributing syringes and needles through drug paraphernalia laws, and explicitly allowed for the retail sale of syringes to persons who inject drugs (Figure 2).\n\nUp to 24 states had restrictive Medicaid treatment policies that required some period of sobriety to receive HCV treatment through Medicaid, including 11 of the states with the least comprehensive set of laws related to prevention. A total of 16 states had permissive Medicaid HCV treatment policies that did not require a period of sobriety or only required screening and counseling to receive HCV treatment through Medicaid (Figure 3). Among the 17 states with high HCV incidence, 5 (Massachusetts, New Mexico, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Washington) had permissive Medicaid treatment policies.\n\nOnly 3 states (Massachusetts, New Mexico, and Washington) had both a most comprehensive or more comprehensive set of laws and a permissive Medicaid treatment policy that might affect access to both HCV preventive and treatment services for persons who inject drugs.\n\nDiscussion\nThe creation and implementation of law can be used to achieve public health objectives, including infectious disease prevention and control, and legislation can be an effective tool to address public health threats faced by a state's residents (9). To promote HCV prevention, state laws can facilitate access to clean injection equipment, and other services for persons who inject drugs and, thereby be an effective tool to reduce the risk for transmission and stop the increasing incidence of HCV infection in communities, particularly those most affected by the nation's current opioid epidemic.\n\nThe laws governing access to comprehensive HCV prevention services varied in the 17 states with high HCV incidence in 2015. For example among the 3 states with the highest HCV incidence rates (Kentucky, Massachusetts, and West Virginia), West Virginia had less comprehensive laws, and Kentucky and Massachusetts had more comprehensive laws. However, some of these laws did not take effect until 2015, suggesting that some laws might have been enacted in response to the increased HCV prevalence in these states.\n\nIn addition to legal strategies aimed at primary prevention, state Medicaid policies can either facilitate or hinder access to HCV treatment services for persons who inject drugs (4). Medicaid treatment policies with strict sobriety requirements can delay or even prevent access to effective and curative treatment (5), although access to HCV treatment cures infection, reducing viral transmission and ultimately, incidence, among persons who inject drugs (10). Although the costs of HCV therapies have raised budgetary issues for state Medicaid programs in the past, the costs of HCV treatment have declined in recent years, increasing the cost-effectiveness of treatment, particularly among persons who inject drugs and who might serve as an ongoing source of transmission to others (10).\n\nThe findings in this analysis are subject to at least 5 limitations. First, the HCV incidence data provided are based on reports of acute HCV cases, representing persons who were recently tested for and received a diagnosis of HCV and were reported to public health authorities. Because most HCV infections are asymptomatic, NNDSS data largely underestimate the prevalence of disease. Furthermore, because HCV reporting requirements and practices differ by state, the degree of underreporting also likely differs by state and should be interpreted with caution. Second, the analysis was conducted at a state level. Local jurisdictions might have implemented different legal or policy interventions that were not captured in this assessment. In addition, this analysis did not consider the enforcement of laws. Third, this cross-sectional, descriptive analysis was based on the most recent surveillance data and the most recent legal data; it is not possible to associate the legal findings with particular incidence rates within states. Additional analysis is needed to understand the impetus behind the laws and to determine their direct impact on HCV incidence, including the impact of case reporting by syringe exchange programs. Fourth, only Medicaid policy data for fee-for-service programs were considered; restrictions in Medicaid managed care programs might differ, other Medicaid barriers to treatment were not assessed, and the direct association between Medicaid sobriety requirements and the number of persons being treated in each state was not assessed. Finally, legal analyses of this nature are largely qualitative, and categorizing states' policy environments might be subject to reviewer interpretation. However, two separate analysts independently assessed the state laws and Medicaid policies, and their analyses were further validated by state personnel familiar with HCV prevention and treatment activities.\n\nLegal and policy interventions can be tailored to a state's unique needs to serve as part of a comprehensive strategy for reducing HCV transmission through increased access to preventive services, including safe injection equipment and HCV treatment. The findings from this assessment of state laws and one component of Medicaid treatment policies can inform jurisdictions when building their capacity to prevent the spread of HCV in their communities. Whereas any one policy can have a positive impact on public health, many factors contribute to the prevalence of disease, and it is important for policy makers and public health officials to work together to understand the various needs of particular populations to prevent HCV transmission and disease.\n\nReferences\n1.

Hepatitis C is the leading cause of liver cancer and liver transplants in the USA. A comparison of data from 2000 to 2015 shows the number of Iowans diagnosed with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection increased nearly 3-fold, from 754 cases in 2000 to 2235 cases in 2015. The number of HCV diagnoses among those between the ages of 18 and 30 has more than quadrupled since 2009, with 303 diagnoses in 2015. According to the (CDC) [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention], most people with HCV infection don't have any symptoms and therefore are not tested or diagnosed. Because of this, the number of Americans and Iowans who are infected with hepatitis C is likely much higher than the report indicates.\n\nAccording to Randy Mayer, Chief of the IDPH Bureau of HIV, STD, and Hepatitis, the increase in diagnoses is expected and is a positive sign. 'These data indicate that Iowans are getting tested and referred to treatment by their medical providers. Everyone born between 1945 and 1965 and anyone who has ever injected non-prescription drugs, even once, should be tested for hepatitis C.'\n\nThe majority (63 percent) of Iowans reported with HCV were between the ages of 45 and 64. This mirrors national data, and has prompted the CDC to recommend anyone born between 1945 and 1965 talk to their doctor about being tested for Hepatitis C. CDC also recommends testing for HCV if:\n\n- You ever injected non-prescription drugs, even if you injected only one time or many years ago.\n- You were treated for a blood clotting problem before 1987.\n- You received a blood transfusion or organ transplant before July 1992.\n- You are on long-term hemodialysis treatment.\n- You have abnormal liver tests or liver disease.\n- You work in health care or public safety and were exposed to blood through a needle stick or other sharp object injury.\n- You are infected with HIV.\n\nOver 55 percent of Iowans between the ages 18 and 64 who have HCV live in one of 6 counties: Polk, Linn, Scott, Woodbury, Pottawattamie, and Black Hawk.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[It is likely to be an oversimplification to attribute the tripling of newly reported cases of hepatitis C solely to increased screening as the state of Iowa is likely to be afflicted by the same epidemic of injection drug use found in much of the USA.

A status of SVR means that the hepatitis C virus is no longer detected in the bloodstream during treatment and is also not detectable at 12 weeks or more after completing treatment, although patients will retain the hepatitis C antibody for life. With achievement of SVR, liver damage ceases, liver function improves, and there is a much lower risk of liver-related complications and death, although SVR status does not guarantee that any existing scarring will heal.\n\nGiven the positive prognosis that comes with SVR, it is surprising that SVR patients in a Scottish study still faced mortality rates 1.9 times more frequent than the general population. The researchers who conducted the study noted that about 2/3 of the 'excess deaths' could be attributed to either liver cancer or 'modifiable characteristics' such as heavy alcohol and drug use, suggesting that hepatitis C patients who have been 'cured' of the infection could benefit from continued monitoring from health professionals and a direct address of the lifestyle risk factors that may have led to the infection in the 1st place.\n\nTo analyze mortality rates in SVR patients, the research team followed 1824 patients who had attained SVR between 1996 and 2011. All patients began and then terminated a course of interferon (IFN)-based antiviral therapy between January 1996 and December 2010, and all showed compensated liver disease at the time of completion of the treatment. This meant that their livers may have been damaged but they were still functional. Patients also showed no HIV or hepatitis B co-infections, and the study began 9 months after the antiviral treatment stopped in order to fully verify SVR status.\n\nIn the 5.2 years of the study, the predominantly male (67 percent) population experienced 78 deaths, a relatively high number given the median age of 40.7 years. 'The number of deaths that would have been expected in our SVR cohort given general population mortality rates was 42,' said the team, noting that 'significant elevations [in mortality] were observed for death due to primary liver cancer and death due to drug-related causes.'\n\nThe team pinpointed a total of 7 distinct causes of death: primary liver cancer, other liver disease, external causes such as accidents, homicide, and suicide, non-liver cancers, diseases of the circulatory system, and 'other' causes. Of the 78 deaths, 18 were due to drug-related causes while 9 were caused by primary liver cancer. In younger patients (those under 50), more than half of the deaths were due to drug-related issues, while older patients (those over 50) were more likely to die from liver cancer.\n\nInterestingly, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) report that men die from liver cancer at more than twice the rate of women and that as of 2013, cases of liver cancer and related deaths are on the rise.\n\nAlthough the researchers emphasized that several factors were missing from the study that would provide a complete picture of the issue, they said that they were able to conclude that 'health risk behaviors emerged [in the study] as the major modifiable risk factor for mortality in the [SVR] population.' The group recommended a multidisciplinary approach to hepatitis C treatment that not only offers medical treatment, but also addresses lifestyle risk factors. 'The SVR time-point may be a particularly opportune moment to assess what other services and support the patient may be in need of,' they said, adding that the high incidence of liver-cancer-related deaths indicates that regular screenings for liver cancer could also improve mortality rates. 'It will be important to repeat this analysis five years hence,' they said, noting that new trends in treatment regimens that include 'intensive coaching from clinicians and nursing staff' could positively affect patients' resolve to make healthier lifestyle decisions after achieving SVR. They added that hepatitis C tends to disproportionately affect populations of lower socioeconomic status, a state that is also associated with higher mortality rates.\n\nA spokesperson for the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) agreed with the team's conclusions about using SVR as a point at which to identify and modify risky behaviors, noting, 'Once cured, it is still important for patients to protect themselves against any activity that puts them at risk of being re-infected.'

So far, the prognosis of this group relative to the general population is unclear.\n\nMethods: Individuals attaining SVR in Scotland in 1996-2011 were identified using a national database. Through record-linkage, we obtained cause-specific mortality data complete to Dec 2013. We calculated standardised mortality ratios (SMRs) to compare the frequency of mortality in SVR patients to the general population. In a parallel analysis, we used Cox regression to identify modifiable patient characteristics associated with post-SVR mortality.\n\nResults: We identified 1824 patients, followed on average for 5.2 years after SVR. In total, 78 deaths were observed. Overall, all-cause mortality was 1.9 times more frequent for SVR patients than the general population (SMR: 1.86; 95 percent confidence interval (CI): 1.49-2.32). Significant cause-specific elevations were seen for death due to primary liver cancer (SMR: 23.50; 95 percent CI: 12.23-45.16), and death due to drug-related causes (SMR: 6.58, 95 percent CI: 4.15-10.45). Together these 2 causes accounted for 66 percent of the total excess death observed. All of the modifiable characteristics associated with increased mortality were markers either of heavy alcohol use or injecting drug use. Individuals without these behavioural markers (32.8 percent of cohort) experienced equivalent survival to the general population (SMR: 0.70; 95 percent CI: 0.41-1.18)\n\nConclusions: Mortality in Scottish SVR patients is higher overall than the general population. The excess was driven by death from drug-related causes and liver cancer. Health risk behaviours emerged as important modifiable determinants of mortality in this population.\n\nLay summary: Patients cured of hepatitis C through treatment had a higher mortality rate overall than the general population. Most of the surplus mortality was due to drug-related causes and death from liver cancer.

The researchers who conducted the study noted that about 2/3 of the 'excess deaths' could be attributed to either liver cancer or 'modifiable characteristics' such as heavy alcohol and drug use, suggesting that hepatitis C patients who have been 'cured' of the infection could benefit from continued monitoring from health professionals and a direct address of the lifestyle risk factors that may have led to the infection in the 1st place. \n\nThe team pinpointed a total of 7 distinct causes of death: primary liver cancer, other liver disease, external causes such as accidents, homicide, and suicide, non-liver cancers, diseases of the circulatory system, and 'other' causes. Individuals without these behavioural markers (32.8 percent of cohort) experienced equivalent survival to the general population (SMR: 0.70; 95 percent CI: 0.41-1.18)\n\nConclusions: Mortality in Scottish SVR patients is higher overall than the general population. The SVR time-point may be a particularly opportune moment to assess what other services and support the patient may be in need of,' they said, adding that the high incidence of liver-cancer-related deaths indicates that regular screenings for liver cancer could also improve mortality rates. ' Significant cause-specific elevations were seen for death due to primary liver cancer (SMR: 23.50; 95 percent CI: 12.23-45.16), and death due to drug-related causes (SMR: 6.58, 95 percent CI: 4.15-10.45). \n\nInterestingly, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) report that men die from liver cancer at more than twice the rate of women and that as of 2013, cases of liver cancer and related deaths are on the rise. \n\nLay summary: Patients cured of hepatitis C through treatment had a higher mortality rate overall than the general population. In younger patients (those under 50), more than half of the deaths were due to drug-related issues, while older patients (those over 50) were more likely to die from liver cancer. With achievement of SVR, liver damage ceases, liver function improves, and there is a much lower risk of liver-related complications and death, although SVR status does not guarantee that any existing scarring will heal. Communicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[This work makes a number of important points including that avoidance of injected illicit substance use and ethanolism are important to eliminate in this cohort and even after cure, screening for primary hepatocellular carcinoma should continue. Despite the fact that an increasingly large portion of the hepatitis C-infected population successfully achieves a cure of the infection, called sustained viral response (SVR), this population still deals with increased mortality rates. Although the researchers emphasized that several factors were missing from the study that would provide a complete picture of the issue, they said that they were able to conclude that 'health risk behaviors emerged [in the study] as the major modifiable risk factor for mortality in the [SVR] population.' A ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n Most of the surplus mortality was due to drug-related causes and death from liver cancer. Overall, all-cause mortality was 1.9 times more frequent for SVR patients than the general population (SMR: 1.86; 95 percent confidence interval (CI): 1.49-2.32). Given the positive prognosis that comes with SVR, it is surprising that SVR patients in a Scottish study still faced mortality rates 1.9 times more frequent than the general population. We calculated standardised mortality ratios (SMRs) to compare the frequency of mortality in SVR patients to the general population. Of the 78 deaths, 18 were due to drug-related causes while 9 were caused by primary liver cancer. Mortality in hepatitis C patients who achieve a sustained viral response compared to the general population. \n\nA spokesperson for the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) agreed with the team's conclusions about using SVR as a point at which to identify and modify risky behaviors, noting, 'Once cured, it is still important for patients to protect themselves against any activity that puts them at risk of being re-infected.' To analyze mortality rates in SVR patients, the research team followed 1824 patients who had attained SVR between 1996 and 2011. The excess was driven by death from drug-related causes and liver cancer. In the 5.2 years of the study, the predominantly male (67 percent) population experienced 78 deaths, a relatively high number given the median age of 40.7 years. ' Such activities, such as intravenous drug use, were pinpointed by the research team as leading to a large number of 'excess' deaths in the cured population. A status of SVR means that the hepatitis C virus is no longer detected in the bloodstream during treatment and is also not detectable at 12 weeks or more after completing treatment, although patients will retain the hepatitis C antibody for life. All of the modifiable characteristics associated with increased mortality were markers either of heavy alcohol use or injecting drug use. All patients began and then terminated a course of interferon (IFN)-based antiviral therapy between January 1996 and December 2010, and all showed compensated liver disease at the time of completion of the treatment. It will be important to repeat this analysis five years hence,' they said, noting that new trends in treatment regimens that include 'intensive coaching from clinicians and nursing staff' could positively affect patients' resolve to make healthier lifestyle decisions after achieving SVR. A history of heavy alcohol and injecting drug use were associated with a higher mortality risk.' Patients also showed no HIV or hepatitis B co-infections, and the study began 9 months after the antiviral treatment stopped in order to fully verify SVR status. Health risk behaviours emerged as important modifiable determinants of mortality in this population. They added that hepatitis C tends to disproportionately affect populations of lower socioeconomic status, a state that is also associated with higher mortality rates. --------\n'Background and aims: The number of people living with previous hepatitis C infection that have attained a sustained viral response (SVR) is expected to grow rapidly. The group recommended a multidisciplinary approach to hepatitis C treatment that not only offers medical treatment, but also addresses lifestyle risk factors.

In a few cases, HBV reactivation in patients treated with DAA medicines resulted in serious liver problems or death.\n\nAs a result, we are requiring a Boxed Warning, our most prominent warning, about the risk of HBV reactivation to be added to the drug labels of these DAAs directing health care professionals to screen and monitor for HBV in all patients receiving DAA treatment. This warning will also be included in the patient information leaflet or Medication Guides for these medicines.\n\nDirect-acting antiviral medicines are used to treat chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, an infection that can last a lifetime. These medicines reduce the amount of HCV in the body by preventing HCV from multiplying, and in most cases, they cure HCV. Without treatment, HCV can lead to serious liver problems including cirrhosis, liver cancer, and death (see List of Direct-Acting Antivirals).\n\nHealth care professionals should screen all patients for evidence of current or prior HBV infection before starting treatment with DAAs, and monitor patients using blood tests for HBV flare-ups or reactivation during treatment and post-treatment follow-up. It is currently unknown why the reactivation occurs.\n\nPatients should tell your health care professional if you have a history of hepatitis B infection or other liver problems before being treated for hepatitis C. Do not stop taking your DAA medicine without first talking to your health care professional. Stopping treatment early could result in your virus becoming less responsive to certain hepatitis C medicines. Read the patient information leaflet or Medication Guide that comes with each new prescription because the information may have changed. Contact your health care professional immediately if you develop fatigue, weakness, loss of appetite, nausea and vomiting, yellow eyes or skin, or light-colored stools, as these may be signs of serious liver problems.\n\nWe identified 24 cases of HBV reactivation reported to FDA and from the published literature in HCV/HBV co-infected patients treated with DAAs during the 31 months from 22 Nov 2013 to 18 Jul 2016. This number includes only cases submitted to FDA, so there are likely additional cases about which we are unaware. Of the cases reported, 2 patients died and 1 required a liver transplant. HBV reactivation was not reported as an adverse event in the clinical trials submitted for the DAA approvals because patients with HBV co-infection were excluded from the trials. The trials excluded these patients in order to specifically evaluate the safety of DAAs, including their effects on the liver, in patients infected with only HCV and without the presence of another virus which affects the liver (see Data Summary).\n\nWe urge health care professionals and patients to report side effects involving DAAs and other medicines to the FDA MedWatch program, using the information in the 'Contact FDA' box at the bottom of the page.\n\nList of Direct-Acting Antivirals (DAAs)*\nBrand name / Active ingredient(s) / Drug Manufacturer\n-----------------------------------------------------\nDaklinza / daclatasvir / Bristol-Myers Squibb\nEpclusa / sofosbuvir and velpatasvir / Gilead Sciences\nHarvoni / ledipasvir and sofosbuvir / Gilead Sciences\nOlysio / simeprevir / Janssen\nSovaldi / sofosbuvir / Gilead Sciences\nTechnivie / ombitasvir and paritaprevir and ritonavir / Abbvie\nViekira Pak / dasabuvir and ombitasvir and paritaprevir and ritonavir / Abbvie\nViekira Pak XR / dasabuvir and ombitasvir and paritaprevir and ritonavir / Abbvie\nZepatier / elbasvir and grazoprevir / Merck Sharp Dohme\n\n*DAA regimens not requiring use in combination with interferon.

These medicines are not known to cause immunosuppression, but HBV reactivation may result from a complex interplay of host immunologic responses in the setting of infection with 2 hepatitis viruses. HBV reactivation was not reported as an adverse event during the clinical trials supporting the applications for the DAA approvals because HBV co-infection was one of the exclusion criteria. Patients with HBV co-infection were excluded in the initial phase 3 trials to allow a characterization of drug safety, including potential liver adverse reactions, in the presence of one hepatitis virus before conducting a more complicated safety evaluation of the drugs in patients infected with 2 hepatitis viruses.\n\n12 of the 24 cases eventually received antiviral treatment active against HBV, either tenofovir or entecavir. 6 cases did not report whether the patients received HBV treatment. The remaining 6 patients did not receive HBV treatment, and the reports did not contain sufficient information to assess why HBV treatment was not initiated. Treatment for HBV was reported to have been delayed in at least 5 of the 12 cases, and 1 patient died. Possible delays in HBV treatment occurred in at least 3 other cases, and 1 of these patients required a hepatic transplantation. With HBV treatment, most patients had improvement in HBV DNA, and in other signs and symptoms such as elevated transaminases, and malaise or fatigue.\n\nIn 8 of the 24 cases, when transaminases started to rise, an adverse drug reaction caused by DAA hepatotoxicity was the initial diagnosis, and the medicines were discontinued. As the condition of patients deteriorated or failed to improve, HBV reactivation was considered among the likely diagnoses. Thus, a common sequence of events was initiation of DAA-based HCV treatment, rapid drop of HCV RNA to undetectable levels within 1-2 weeks after normalization of transaminase levels (if they were elevated), followed by a rise in HBV DNA with or without increase in transaminases between weeks 4-8.\n\nThe patients who developed HBV reactivation were heterogeneous in terms of HCV genotype. These patients were also heterogeneous in terms of baseline HBV disease, fitting into 3 general categories of patients: those with detectable HBV viral load (n=7), those with positive HBsAg and undetectable HBV viral load (n=4), and those with negative HBsAg and undetectable HBV viral load (n=3). For the remaining 10 patients, HBsAg status was either not known or baseline HBV could not be interpreted.'\n\nReferences:\n1.

As a result, we are requiring a Boxed Warning, our most prominent warning, about the risk of HBV reactivation to be added to the drug labels of these DAAs directing health care professionals to screen and monitor for HBV in all patients receiving DAA treatment. These patients were also heterogeneous in terms of baseline HBV disease, fitting into 3 general categories of patients: those with detectable HBV viral load (n=7), those with positive HBsAg and undetectable HBV viral load (n=4), and those with negative HBsAg and undetectable HBV viral load (n=3). HBV reactivation was not reported as an adverse event in the clinical trials submitted for the DAA approvals because patients with HBV co-infection were excluded from the trials. In a few cases, HBV reactivation in patients treated with DAA medicines resulted in serious liver problems or death. These medicines are not known to cause immunosuppression, but HBV reactivation may result from a complex interplay of host immunologic responses in the setting of infection with 2 hepatitis viruses. For the remaining 10 patients, HBsAg status was either not known or baseline HBV could not be interpreted.'\n\nReferences:\n \n\nWe urge health care professionals and patients to report side effects involving DAAs and other medicines to the FDA MedWatch program, using the information in the 'Contact FDA' box at the bottom of the page. Possible delays in HBV treatment occurred in at least 3 other cases, and 1 of these patients required a hepatic transplantation. The remaining 6 patients did not receive HBV treatment, and the reports did not contain sufficient information to assess why HBV treatment was not initiated. Stopping treatment early could result in your virus becoming less responsive to certain hepatitis C medicines. Of the cases reported, 2 patients died and 1 required a liver transplant.", "reports": [{"diseases": ["unknown", "other", "hepatitis b", "hepatitis c", "hepatitis d"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2021-03-08 00:00:00", "2016-03-25 00:00:00", "2021-01-07 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "HBsAg", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Courjon J ,", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "LL", "country": "Micronesia"}, {"location": "USA", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "4568826", "headline": "PRO/EDR> Hepatitis C - USA (11): (AL) injection drug use", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=4568826", "date": "2016-10-18 17:30:12", "main_text": "HEPATITIS C - USA (11): (ALABAMA) INJECTION DRUG USE\n****************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Mon 17 Oct 2016\nSource: ABC3340 [edited]\nhttp://abc3340.com/news/local/er-doctors-seeing-more-hepatitis-c-cases-among-injection-drug-users\n\n\nAn alarming trend in local emergency rooms: ER doctors are seeing more cases of hepatitis C among drug users sharing needles. Emergency departments started screening patients 17 and older in 2015. Since that universal screening began, the ER at UAB (University of Alabama Birmingham) hospital started to see more cases among people who inject drugs.\n\n'This is an alarming problem,' said Dr. James Galbraith, an ER doctor at UAB. 'There is a direct correlation between the hepatitis C cases we're identifying in this younger population, and the emerging opioid injection drug use, largely heroin.'\n\nER doctors did not start regularly testing for Hepatitis C until 2013 - once a cure became more readily available. Initially, testing was done on baby boomers, who account for 75 percent of hepatitis C cases in the USA. It was not until 2015 that all patients 17 and older are screened. 'We recognized we were missing a really important population, which was a growing population of people who inject drugs,' said Galbraith.\n\nSince 2015, Galbraith says 12 percent of white patients over that age test positive and 2 percent of African Americans test positive. 'That disparity between the 2 demographics is largely driven by injection drug use. Which we know is disproportionately impacting the white population,' Galbraith explains.\n\nGalbrieth believes these ER visits could end up saving more lives in the process. 'Therefore, we have the opportunity to counsel patients about their positive result in the emergency department and give them their follow up options,' he said. 'The big opportunity is an opportunity to share information about how this disease is transmitted, and maybe we can avert the spread to others.' Galbrieth adds, 'the concern now is that Alabama could also see the spread of HIV among injection drug users.'\n\n[Byline: Edward Burch]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[In the absence of a vaccine, infection avoidance techniques such as needle exchange programs and the need for aggressive available programs in counseling, not criminalizing, substance addiction are vitally needed.

The number of hepatitis C cases is skyrocketing and it is having a big impact on recovering addicts, their families, and the state.\n\nA recovering heroin addict, now battling hepatitis C, said that his new battle is a life changing consequence of the state's heroin crisis. 'Just because you get clean doesn't mean everything goes back to the way it is. It's not all rainbows and puppy dogs,' he told FOX25. This story of addiction is a familiar one. The father of 2 grew up in an upper middle class home in Newton and became hooked first on painkillers prescribed after he was injured while serving in the Army. The addiction to pain killers led to heroin.\n\n2 years ago, he got high with a woman who was upfront with him that she had hepatitis C. He used her needle anyway and did not care about the consequences. 'I didn't care. The heroin was more important to me at that time than anything,' he said.\n\nWhen drug addicts share needles they are also sharing bodily fluids, which is how hepatitis C is transmitted. It attacks the liver and can cause liver failure or liver cancer. Dr Ray Chung, Director of Hepatology at Massachusetts General Hospital, said hepatitis C can lead to even more deadly diagnoses. 'In fact liver cancer -- particularly related to hepatitis C -- but liver cancer as a whole, is the fastest rising cause of cancer death in this country,' he said. Chung and Massachusetts Public Health officials believe there is a direct correlation between the rise in heroin use and the rise in hepatitis C among young people.\n\nFOX25 found hepatitis C rates have been steadily increasing in Massachusetts over the past decade. More than 9000 confirmed and probable cases in 2015, compared to more than 7000 in 2005. In 2015 close to 5000 of the cases were 15- to 39-year-olds. The Department of Public Health told FOX25 they are working to stop the spread of hepatitis C. They said they perform about 30 000 tests a year to screen for. They also have 6 funded state programs that include need exchange services, education and outreach.\n\n[Byline: Heather Hegedus, Jesse Grossi]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map of Massachusetts can be accessed at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/224.]\n\n******\n[2] Kentucky\nDate: Mon 14 Nov 2016\nSource: Stat News [edited]\nhttps://www.statnews.com/2016/11/14/hepatitis-c-cure-kentucky/\n\n\nThe patients [in Hazard, Kentucky] ask about the treatment [for hepatitis C] by name. They have seen the crisp, alluring ads on TV and heard the soothing spots on the radio: Harvoni, they know, could cure their hepatitis C. But in this town, carved into the Appalachian Mountains, in a state beset by hepatitis C rates 7 times the national average, Harvoni and other new hepatitis C drugs remain largely out of reach. Over the past year, only 3 percent of the state's Medicaid beneficiaries with the disease received treatment.\n\n'It's very hard to see the patient and just tell them, I can't treat you,' said Dr Fares Khater, an infectious disease doctor in nearby Whitesburg. A major reason is cost, with list prices for some 12-week treatment courses approaching $100 000. But a series of other forces helps explain why Kentucky is struggling to respond to the hepatitis C crisis, including a growing opioid epidemic that is fueling new cases and a changing patient base that is demanding hard choices be made about who gets treatment first.\n\nWith opioid use seeding the spread of infectious disease across the country, this state could be a case study in how hepatitis C affects other areas, and what happens when demands for specialists, surveillance, and treatment outstrip the ability of health systems to respond. 'We do not have the capability to deal with this because we do not have the resources,' said Doug Thoroughman, Kentucky's acting state epidemiologist.\n\nHepatitis C is a viral disease that attacks the liver and, when the condition becomes chronic, causes liver cancer and scarring called fibrosis or, when it is severe, cirrhosis. The disease is the leading cause of liver transplants in the country, and an estimated 19 000 people die from hepatitis C-related complications each year. Most people with the disease experience symptoms only when their livers suffer damage, which can take years after they contract the virus. That leaves many of the 2.7 million to 3.9 million Americans with hepatitis C carrying it unknowingly. 3 years ago, the 1st of the innovative hepatitis C drugs marched onto the market, signaling a new era for patients who could be cured in a shorter time and with fewer side effects. But the reality is that many of the people who need the drugs are uninsured or depend on Medicaid, and many state Medicaid programs can't afford the medications for their thousands of infected beneficiaries.\n\nIn fiscal 2016, hepatitis C treatments -- given to fewer than 900 of the 29 000 hepatitis C patients covered by Kentucky's Medicaid program -- ate up 5 percent of the program's pharmacy budget. Access to the drugs could grow more limited. Kentucky has so many beneficiaries with hepatitis C because it expanded Medicaid coverage under the Affordable Care Act to more than 425 000 additional residents. But those residents stand to lose their coverage if President-elect Donald Trump and congressional Republicans repeal President Obama's health law without offering a replacement. Even if the Medicaid expansion remains in place, state proposals could impose new restrictions. Republican Governor Matt Bevin has asked the federal government to allow Kentucky to make many beneficiaries pay premiums, framing it as a way to sustain the expensive expansion.\n\nAdvocates for underserved populations are raising alarms, arguing even small fees would be too expensive for many to keep their insurance. 'Our population here are people that dig change to buy a gallon of gas, maybe to get to work, maybe to get to a doctor's appointment,' said Mary Meade-McKenzie, the executive director of Kentucky River Community Care, a mental health and substance abuse organization based in Hazard. 'For people who already have nothing, USD 2 is a huge deal. It may mean the difference between buying dinner, whether that is a loaf of bread or bologna or whatever.'\n\nWith the opioid epidemic steamrolling through Appalachia and New England, the new face of the disease is increasingly young, white, and rural. From 2006 to 2012, hepatitis C infections rose 364 percent among young adults in Kentucky, Tennessee, West Virginia, and Virginia, with rates in rural areas twice as high as those in urban areas, according to the CDC. Because state Medicaid programs are unable to cover all beneficiaries with hepatitis C, they have had to make choices. To qualify for treatment, some beneficiaries in Kentucky, for example, must have stage 3 or 4 liver fibrosis (on a 4-stage scale) and show they have not used alcohol or drugs for 6 months, in part to reduce the chances that someone treated gets reinfected. Liver specialists and infectious disease experts have endorsed treating the sickest patients first, although they recommend that everyone who isn't going to die of another cause within a year should be treated.\n\n'You need everybody to be cured,' said Dr Uday Shankar, a Hazard gastroenterologist who estimated that only 10 percent to 20 percent of his patients have been approved for treatment. 'If you do not cure them today, 1 person will transmit to 5 people. Especially youngsters -- they have a long way to go.' Shankar said he spends chunks of his days helping patients appeal denials for insurance coverage, scanning clinical trial listings, and asking companies what they offer patients who can't afford their medications. He and Khater are the only specialists who treat hepatitis C for at least 7 counties.\n\nHealth officials here [in Hazard] say they were woken up to the area's vulnerability by something that happened more than 200 miles [322 km] away: an HIV outbreak in Austin, Indiana. Not only did the outbreak show that diseases could vault through close networks of drug users in small towns, but by coincidence, the towns are closely linked. Decades ago, a crowd of people from Hazard moved to Austin for work but kept family ties in Kentucky. The fear was that someone from Austin infected with HIV would come to Hazard and pass the virus to someone here, igniting another viral conflagration in this tight-knit community of 5000 people. High hepatitis C rates can also portend an HIV outbreak, but eastern Kentucky has so far been spared from that. 'There was a direct connection,' said Sharon Dunaway, the nursing administrator for the Kentucky River District Health Department, which provides health services in 7 counties in this area. Since then, the department has joined with clinicians, mental health providers, and law enforcement to raise awareness about the diseases in the community. Officials have ramped up testing for both HIV and hepatitis C, including at drug courts. They have considered testing at county jails in the area, but there is concern that the counties would then be responsible for covering their inmates' treatments. Now officials are thinking of doing the tests as people are released. They are also working to establish the region's first needle exchange, possibly a mobile one so people do not have to travel far to reach it. Going from one end of a county to the other here can take some time, the roads weaving around the mountains and many people living in hollows, small pockets tucked into the hillsides.\n\nBut new headwinds are complicating efforts to control the spread of the disease. The decline of the coal industry, which residents say accelerated in the past 2 years, has hit the tax base and sent many people seeking work elsewhere. Some health workers said they feared that the only young adults who would stick around would be people who abuse drugs. Then there are the drugs that are driving the spread of disease. People here have primarily been injecting painkillers or, in some cases, non-opioids. But heroin, which emerged in Louisville, Lexington, and northern Kentucky 4 or 5 years ago, has started popping up recently in rural eastern Kentucky, posing new health problems.\n\nThe concentration of hepatitis C cases among young adults poses another problem: in roughly 6 percent of pregnancies, the virus is passed from mother to child. This summer [2016], state and federal health officials reported that the infection rate in Kentucky women of childbearing age increased more than 200 percent from 2011 to 2014 and that the proportion of infants born to infected mothers rose 124 percent. 'We have seen an outrageous number of babies who are exposed,' said Dr Claudia Espinosa, a pediatric infectious disease expert at the University of Louisville. She said she and colleagues track about 100 babies a year with potential exposure compared to a few dozen in prior years. At the University of Kentucky, doctors saw 13 babies born to mothers with hepatitis C in 2010, said Dr Sean McTigue, a pediatric infectious disease expert. In 2015, it was 65 babies, and through August 2016, they had already seen 61 babies. 'It doesn't really seem to be leveling off,' McTigue said.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map of Kentucky can be accessed at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/27866.\n\nIn the absence of a vaccine, infection avoidance techniques such as needle exchange programs and the need for aggressive available programs in counseling, not criminalizing, substance addiction are vitally needed.

However, the most significant rise in HCV infections are in young adults aged 18-29, with a 200 percent overall increase statewide.\n\nCertain regions of the state revealed much higher rates of infection in this age group than others. For example, the Southeast has seen a 490 percent increase in young adult HCV infections in the last 5 years.

State public health officials counted 311 cases of acute hepatitis C in Massachusetts in 2015, up from 273 the year before and just 174 in 2013 -- a 79 percent jump, according to state and federal data obtained by the Herald. The reported numbers, however, may be only a fraction of the actual problem, according to doctors, providing another devastating but often overlooked consequence of the opioid scourge that has ravaged the Bay State [Massachusetts].\n\n'In many ways, one of the greatest infectious disease public health threats, given the size of the epidemic, the liver disease it is responsible for, the liver cancer it is responsible for,' said Kevin Cranston, the director of the Department of Public Health [DPH]'s Bureau of Infectious Disease and Laboratory Sciences. 'The data are clear to us that the opioid epidemic is the major contributor. The rise is especially great among those younger than 30. While DPH is still reviewing final data, the number of chronic -- or long-term -- hepatitis cases among those between 15 and 29 years old is expected to top 2600 in 2015, or roughly 700 more than in 2007,' according to Cranston.\n\nBut as the state's heroin problem continues to take a deadly toll -- there were more than 1600 fatal overdoses in 2015 and nearly 1000 through June 2016 -- the connected spike in hepatitis has not grabbed nearly as much attention. Dr. Arthur Kim of Massachusetts General Hospital's Division of Infectious Diseases said that could be due in part to hepatitis's 'silent nature' as it could show little to no symptoms at 1st and when it is most contagious. How the feds have reported acute cases has also limited how many are actually counted to date. 'Even the reported cases represent a small proportion of the true number of cases,' Kim said. 'And most of the cases that we see are between ages 18 and 30.'\n\nScreening for the disease, while improved, also isn't as robust as it should be, said Dr. David Yassa, an infectious disease physician at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. 'The majority of people with hep C in this country are walking around without knowing that they have it,' he said. The disease's spread -- often through shared needles, syringes or even tools people use to heat heroin -- highlights the impact of needle exchange programs. The state currently funds 6, including in Boston, Provincetown and as far west as Northampton, while 3 more in North Adams, Gloucester and Greenfield have received local approval but have yet to launch, according to DPH.\n\nBut other places hit hard, such as the Merrimack Valley and other parts of Cape Cod, still lack them, said Dr. Alysse Wurcel, an infectious disease physician at Tufts Medical Center, who added that some communities have fought against a program landing in their backyard. 'There are places who have few to no needle exchanges but who desperately need them,' Wurcel said. 'But it's not as easy as saying it simply needs to happen.'\n\n[Byline: Matt Stout]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[There is not much more to say.

These alarming new statistics come from a recent study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that reveals some of the ways shooting up heroin and painkillers endangers the next generation.\n\n'Kentucky is experiencing the ravages of a hepatitis C epidemic that has been going on for years now,' said Dr John Ward, director of CDC's Division of Viral Hepatitis and a senior author on the study. 'And the state is not alone in having a large epidemic of hepatitis C,' an infectious, viral liver disease. 'We are concerned other states have this problem, too.'\n\nResearchers analyzed commercial laboratory data from Quest Diagnostics, information from Kentucky state health officials and national birth certificate data for the years 2011-2014. They found hepatitis C detection among women of childbearing age rose 213 per cent in Kentucky, from 275 to 862 per 100 000; compared with 22 per cent nationally, or 139 to 169 per 100 000. During those same years, Kentucky's health department received reports of 777 pregnant women testing positive for antibodies against hepatitis C.\n\nMeanwhile, the proportion of babies born to women with hepatitis C in Kentucky rose 124 per cent, from 1 in 142 to 1 in 63, which Ward called 'very troubling and disturbing and alarming.' The national increase was 68 per cent, from 1 in 536 to 1 in 308.\n\n'The numbers speak for themselves,' said Dr Ardis Hoven, an infectious disease consultant for the Kentucky Department for Public Health and former president of the American Medical Association. 'If you look at the risk factors, you see IV drug use is the main one,' although tattoos and multiple sex partners also put people at risk. '...The study shines a light on a significant issue.'\n\nOther recent research also points to a growing problem with drug-fueled diseases in the region. One CDC report showed that 220 US counties are at high risk for a rapid spread of hepatitis C and HIV among drug users -- and 54 of them are in Kentucky. Another study found the rate of new hepatitis C cases among people 30 and younger more than tripled from 2006-2012 in Kentucky, Tennessee, Virginia, and West Virginia.\n\nIn the latest year for which statistics are available, Kentucky had the highest rate of acute hepatitis C infections in the nation -- 4 per 100 000 people in 2014, compared with a national average of 0.7 per 100 000 people.\n\nHepatitis C is also a growing problem in Southern Indiana, where that state's worst-ever HIV outbreak has stricken 203 people. Dr William Cooke, the lone physician in Austin, Indiana, said nearly 600 people were found to have hepatitis C during the outbreak, which was mostly tied to injecting the painkiller Opana (oxymorphone).\n\nRealizing the threat to children, Kentucky officials in 2015 began requiring doctors to report all hepatitis C infected pregnant women and children up to age 5, as well as babies born to infected women. Beginning in the fall of 2016, Kentucky plans to require reporting of all hepatitis C lab test results, positive or negative. Ward praised these efforts.\n\nAlthough hepatitis testing isn't mandatory in the state, Hoven said she strongly recommends all pregnant women be tested and everyone get educated about the disease. She also said Kentucky needs more needle exchanges, where addicts can trade dirty needles for clean ones, and more drug treatment to help people kick their addictions. 'Clearly, we need access to more providers of care,' she said. 'We will continue to work on this.'\n\nDoctors agreed the stakes are high. If girls and women 15 to 44 years old contract hepatitis C, the virus can fester inside them for decades. Up to 70 per cent of hepatitis C patients will go on to develop chronic liver disease, CDC says, with up to 20 per cent developing cirrhosis of the liver and up to 5 per cent dying of cirrhosis or liver cancer. Plus, nearly 6 per cent of babies born to women with hepatitis C contract the disease from their mothers. Some children 'clear it on their own', Hoven said, but others remain infected and are at risk for severe liver disease. 'If we help people before they get pregnant,' Cooke said, 'we can prevent this.'\n\nNew, high-priced hepatitis C drugs can actually cure the disease -- although they can't be used in children and Cooke said many patients have a hard time getting their insurance to pay for them. But when infected young women get such medicines before getting pregnant, doctors said they and their future babies can benefit.\n\nCDC researchers said their findings underscore the importance of preventing hepatitis C, identifying people at risk and testing them so that they can get into treatment quickly if they're infected. Such measures are crucial, they said, as the scourge of painkiller and heroin abuse continues to grow. Federal statistics show that every day, 3900 Americans begin abusing prescription opioids, 580 start using heroin, and 78 die from an opioid overdose.\n\nWhile Kentucky may stand out in this study, Ward said, 'by no means is Kentucky the only state with this problem.'\n\n[byline: Laura Ungar]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[In the absence of a vaccine, infection avoidance techniques such as needle exchange programs and the need for aggressive programs in counseling, not criminalizing, substance addiction are needed.

The cases are all tied to a nurse, accused of stealing drugs from both Davis and McKay Dee Hospitals from 2011-2013. The 1st cases popped up a couple years ago and started this investigation that now has more than a dozen infected patients.\n\n'We now know, half the people who may have been exposed by this nurse have not come in for free hepatitis C testing' With 16 confirmed cases, there is still concern that nearly half of the 7217 people who may have been exposed have not come in for free testing.\n\nHepatitis C is treatable, but can cause death if left undiagnosed and untreated.\n\n'We do know in the USA, the most common way [to] transmit hepatitis C is through needles and the only way to transmit hepatitis C is blood to blood.' Dr. Angela Dunn, a CDC epidemiologist says the cases were transferred through blood in a hospital setting but 'unfortunately we do not know how it happened.' The assumption is that the nurse, who was working as an emergency room nurse, was sharing needles for IV [intravenous] drugs with patients.\n\nThe now 16 known victims were exposed to a rare form of hepatitis C between 2011-2013 at Davis and McKay Dee hospitals, where the 49-year-old nurse worked. The nurse's record of troubles started at Davis Hospital where she was let go for stealing Benadryl in 2013. She started nursing at McKay Dee hospital not long after, where her alleged drug diversion escalated to narcotic IV drugs that disappeared on a weekly basis.\n\n'Unfortunately I do not have a way of 100 percent knowing how the virus is transmitted and the directionality of the virus,' Dunn said, adding that the 49-year-old nurse could have contracted hepatitis C from a patient and then passed it to others, or could have been the original carrier passing it on a total of 7217 possible patients.\n\nHepatitis C 2b is it a pretty rare genotype. It is only 8 to 10 percent of all hepatitis C in Utah, therefore making it easy to pinpoint connected cases. So far 3731 people have been tested, but just as many still have not. The investigation found 53 hepatitis C cases, but only 16 are linked to the nurse so far. One is from Davis hospital the rest from patients of McKay Dee hospital in Weber County.\n\n'The good news' according to Dunn 'is there is treatment for most cases of hepatitis C and the hospitals are working closely with the patients to get that done.'\n\n[Byline: Heidi Hatch]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[ProMED awaits more definitive numbers related to patients thought to have been nosocomially infected.\n\nBloodborne viruses such as hepatitis B and C, and HIV can be transmitted by the contamination of multidose vials with a syringe containing blood harboring the virus. If the viruses are genetically identical, not just the same genotype, this suggests that the patient was injected by a syringe containing the medicine (likely a strong analgesic, such as an opiate, that had been previously contaminated by the healthcare worker's blood).\n\nRegarding the significance of genotypes of HCV, the following is derived from a USA Veterans Administration publication, http://www.hepatitis.va.gov/provider/reviews/genotypes.asp#S1X. [The comments about response to therapy also relate to the newer anti-HCV modes of therapy]:\n\nAn important variable for all patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) is the 'genotype' of HCV with which they are infected. This is the strain of the virus to which they were exposed when they were infected, often many years prior to their evaluation, and it is determined by a simple blood test. Genotypes of HCV are genetically distinct groups of the virus that have arisen during its evolution (1). Approximately 75 percent of Americans with HCV have genotype 1 of the virus (subtypes 1a or 1b), and 20-25 percent have genotypes 2 or 3, with small numbers of patients infected with genotypes 4, 5, or 6 (2). Most patients with HCV are found to have only 1 principal genotype, rather than multiple genotypes (3-5). Genotype 4 is much more common in Africa than in many other parts of the world, genotype 6 is common in Southeast Asia, and each area of the world has its own distribution of genotypes (6).\n\nGenotype generally has not been found in epidemiological studies to play a large role in liver disease progression due to HCV. Rather, genotype is of clinical importance principally as a factor in response to HCV treatments. With all treatments tested to date, patients with genotypes 2 and 3 are more than twice as likely as patients with genotype 1 to achieve a sustained virological response to therapy (2-5, 7). In addition, when using combination therapy with interferon and ribavirin, patients with genotypes 2 or 3 generally are treated for only 24 weeks, whereas it is recommended that patients infected with genotype 1 receive treatment for 48 weeks.\n\n1.

And baby boomers, or those ages 55 to 64, accounted for 51 percent of the deaths in 2013, according to the study, published online [17 Mar 2016] in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases. The hepatitis C virus infects the liver cells and can lead to serious liver problems, including cirrhosis (scarring of the liver) or liver cancer.\n\nThis rise in deaths from hepatitis C is 'alarming,' said Amy Nunn an associate professor of behavioral and social sciences at the Brown University School of Public Health in Providence, Rhode Island. Nunn is currently working on a study about hepatitis C screening and treatment in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania]; she was not involved in the new report from the CDC. 'This is an epidemic of enormous magnitude,' she said.\n\nIn the analysis, CDC researchers looked at data collected from death certificates in the USA between 2003 and 2013. The researchers compared the number of Americans who died each year from hepatitis C to the number of deaths from 60 other 'nationally notifiable' infectious conditions, meaning diseases that health officials in every state are required to report to the CDC. These include HIV, pneumococcal disease, tuberculosis, measles, mumps, rabies, and Lyme disease.\n\nDuring the study period, there was an average yearly increase in deaths from hepatitis C of more than 6 percent, the researchers found. During the same period, deaths from the 60 other infectious conditions included in the study decreased: they fell from 24 745 in 2003 to 17 915 in 2013, or an average yearly decrease of more than 3 percent, according to the findings. In 2012, the number of Americans who died from hepatitis C exceeded the total number of deaths from all 60 of those other notifiable infectious conditions, the researchers found.\n\nThe hepatitis C virus is one of 5 viruses that are known to cause hepatitis, or inflammation of the liver. Hepatitis C spreads primarily when people share needles, syringes, or other equipment used to inject drugs. But before 1992, when the US began screening the blood supply for the virus, hepatitis C was also commonly spread through blood transfusions and organ transplants. Less common ways of contracting the virus include accidental needle punctures among health care workers; sharing personal care items that may have come in contact with another person's blood, such as razors or toothbrushes; and sexual contact with a person infected with hepatitis C.\n\nMany people who are currently infected with hepatitis C are baby boomers who may have dabbled once or twice with an injectable drug when they were younger, Nunn told Live Science. Because people are not routinely screened for hepatitis C, about 85 percent of those infected with the virus don't know they have it, she said. There is a stigma and shame attached to hepatitis C because some of those infected are current or former injectable drug users, Nunn said.\n\nThe study findings also come as no surprise to Dr Raymond Chung, director of hepatology and the Liver Center at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, he said.\n\n'Hepatitis C may be a different beast from other infections' that affect the liver, that may be shorter in duration or have more symptoms, Chung said. Hepatitis C can be a silent illness, and people may have no symptoms for decades, allowing the disease to progress in the liver unnoticed, he explained.\n\nChung told Live Science 3 million to 4 million Americans may be chronically infected with hepatitis C and most of those people are in their baby boomer years. 'That's the group where the epidemic resides,' he said. Baby boomers were likely infected in the 1970s and '80s, and have had the disease for about 3 decades, Chung said. The illness may be diagnosed when these people seek treatment for their symptoms, but the individuals may already have more advanced liver disease and more complications from it, he said.\n\nChung said that some people die from hepatitis C after the virus leads to liver failure or liver cancer, which reflects the trend of people being diagnosed only later in the disease process. This increase in the number of deaths may continue for another 5 years or longer before it peaks, Chung said. Then, the baby boomers will get older, and may be more likely to die from other causes.\n\nThe challenge to health care providers is to identify people with hepatitis C earlier, through screening, and to get these individuals into care sooner, he said. There are now treatments that can cure the infection, or stop the development of the disease, Chung said.\n\nSome of the medications used in the past to treat the disease were poorly tolerated and had lots of side effects, Chung said. 'The cure had a reputation for being worse than the disease itself,' he noted. The new drugs are better, but another problem is that they are very expensive, and some people are having a hard time getting access to them in early stages of the disease, Nunn said.\n\n[Byline: Cari Nierenberg]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Since hepatitis C causes less overt acute viral hepatitis than the other causes and has a much higher risk of chronic infection that can lead to cirrhosis, liver failure, or liver cancer, it remains important to identify those infected to institute treatment or at least treat those with progressive liver disease prior to the development of complications.

But NHS Lanarkshire [Scotland] is now working with other health boards across the UK to notify people who may have had a surgical procedure carried out by the individual between 1982 and 2008. The employee worked in hospitals across Lanarkshire during the period, mainly in Wishaw General Hospital and the former Law Hospital as well as at the William Harvey Hospital in Kent [southeast England] for 3 months between January and April 2006.\n\nWhen the worker initially tested positive in 2008, the UK Advisory Panel (UKAP) said patients did not need to be warned as the risk was thought to be low, but 2 positive cases have now emerged. It was found a patient referred for treatment for hepatitis C in Lanarkshire in 2015 had previously had a surgical procedure carried out by the infected healthcare worker. Further investigations found it was 'probable' the patient was infected with the virus during a surgical procedure carried out by the individual and another similar case has now been found.\n\nThe health board said: 'After detailed investigations, including extensive testing of viruses, NHS Lanarkshire submitted a report to UKAP. UKAP endorsed NHS Lanarkshire's proposal to carry out a patient notification exercise. 'Patients are receiving a detailed question-and-answer sheet with their letter which includes information about hepatitis C and how to arrange to be tested.'\n\nIn total, 8383 patients across the UK are to receive letters informing them of the situation and urging them to arrange a blood test. The vast majority -- 7311 -- are in Lanarkshire, with more than 700 across the rest of Scotland, 336 in England, a further 11 in Wales, and 5 in Northern Ireland. Dr Iain Wallace, medical director at NHS Lanarkshire, said: 'We would like to reassure people that the likelihood of patients acquiring the virus from a surgical procedure carried out by the healthcare worker is low.'\n\nThe virus infects the liver and can cause serious and potentially life-threatening damage. Around 215 000 people in the UK have hepatitis C, according to the NHS.

The person, 28, was indicted on charges of tampering with a consumer product and obtaining a controlled substance by deceit, federal officials announced Tuesday, 16 Feb 2016.\n\nThe indictment accuses the former employee of Swedish Medical Center in Englewood, Colorado, of tampering with a syringe containing pain medication there and knowingly acquiring the medication 'by deception and subterfuge.' He did so, officials allege, 'with reckless disregard for the risk that another person will be placed in danger of bodily injury, and under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to such risk.'\n\nEarlier in February 2016, Swedish Medical Center said a former employee could have exposed patients to hepatitis and HIV, but did not name the employee or detail how the patients could have been put at risk. The employee, officials said, could have stolen narcotic pain medication intended for patients. The hospital said about 2900 patients should get tested for the viruses, adding that it had no evidence of any patient exposure but wanted to be cautious.\n\nAccording to state regulators, the former employee allegedly removed a syringe containing the pain medication fentanyl from an anesthesia cart and replaced it with another labeled syringe 'in the beginning stages of a surgical procedure' on 22 Jan 2016. Prosecutors say the replacement syringe contained another substance. The former employee's urine later tested positive for fentanyl, regulators said in an order suspending his license in January 2016.\n\nA lawyer says he is representing 14 people who are among the former surgery patients the hospital said should get tested. At least 2 have tested positive for hepatitis B, said the lawyer.\n\nHospital officials declined to comment. A spokesman for the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment told CNN affiliate KMGH that officials are not releasing details about whether patients have tested positive for the viruses at this time. 'CDPHE is not releasing information about lab results, either positive or negative, related to the Swedish Medical Center ... at least until completion of our investigation -- likely weeks to months from now,' spokesman Mark Salley said, according to KMGH.\n\nSince the Colorado hospital's announcement, 2 hospitals in Arizona where [the employee] once worked have also said they are offering free hepatitis B, hepatitis C and HIV testing to patients who had surgery while he worked there.

According to McMahan, Jeff Markley, executive director of the Positive Resource Center, said the surrounding counties have had similar increases in HIV in 2015.\n\n'We see the trend, I think the numbers speak for themselves. I want to be proactive. I don't want to wait. Addiction is hard enough to deal with, much less addiction with HIV or hepatitis C; I want to minimize the potential problems that our children will have to pay for,' McMahan said.\n\nMcMahan said that in February 2016 the Allen County Commissioners will meet and hear testimony as to why an intravenous-needle exchange program is needed now. They will then have 2 weeks to reflect on the issue before voting. If passed, it would move on to the state level, where the Indiana State Department of Health would need to declare it an emergency situation before the needle exchange program could start.\n\nA lot of good things can come out of the needle-exchange program, in addition to the screenings for hepatitis C and HIV. McMahan said Park Center will be there for addiction counseling and to help plug people into the services they may need.\n\nIV drug use increased by 9 percent in 2015 while statewide it is less then 1 percent, which is also cause for concern. The health department would like to increase the testing and include information for care providers to know what to look for.\n\nThe Positive Resource Center would be used as the site for the needle exchange program, and McMahan said they have applied for funding through grants for the materials they would hand out in the needle exchange packets. The cost is only about $3 an individual. That's very minimal when one considers the $80 000 individual treatment cost for hepatitis C, a cost that many insurance companies won't pay for.

Angela Dunn, a medical epidemiologist with the CDC stationed at the Utah Department of Health, confirmed that additional cases have been identified but said health officials would not be releasing the final numbers until the investigation is complete.\n\nHospital officials asked nearly 7200 patients at McKay-Dee Hospital in Ogden and Davis Hospital and Medical Center in Layton to get tested for hepatitis C in November 2015 after a former nurse and a patient both tested positive for the same rare strain of hepatitis C. Authorities are concerned that the 49-year-old former nurse, of Layton, may have exposed patients to the virus.\n\nChris Dallin, a spokesman for McKay-Dee Hospital, declined to confirm the existence of additional cases until the health department completes its report. That will likely be in February 2016, he said, after hospital officials finish processing the last of the free hepatitis C tests being offered to patients until 31 Jan 2016.\n\nHepatitis C, a virus that attacks the liver, is transmitted through contact with infected blood, typically by sharing needles. In recent years, several high-profile hepatitis C outbreaks have involved hospital workers exposing patients to the bloodborne pathogen after tampering with injection equipment to steal narcotics. In 2009, a Denver hospital technician infected at least 18 patients with hepatitis C after she stole syringes of pain medication and swapped them with used syringes containing saline.\n\nThe former McKay-Dee nurse now at the center of the investigation, lost her nursing license in December 2014 after admitting to stealing\nmedication from her employer, according to licensing division documents. Dallin said the former nurse in was fired from McKay-Dee in 2014 after the hospital found evidence she had stolen morphine and Dilaudid, both opioid pain medications.\n\nAuthorities expanded the investigation to include patients at Davis Hospital and Medical Center after they learned that the nurse was caught stealing IV Benadryl from the hospital while employed there in 2012 and 2013.\n\nHealth officials are still calling on patients who received letters about their possible exposure to come in for testing.\n\nChris Johnson, chief nursing officer at Davis Hospital and Medical Center, said in a prepared statement the hospital has had 'nearly 50 percent of all those exposed tested.' Dunn estimated the response rate was closer to 35 percent overall. That's still 'pretty low,' she said.\n\nShe warned that hepatitis C usually lies dormant for years, but it can lead to severe liver damage, liver cancer and liver failure if left untreated.\n\nDunn said the additional patients identified have the same strain of hepatitis C as the former nurse and the 1st patient, lending more\ncredibility to the possibility that the infections come from a common source. Genotype 2b is found in about 8 percent of people with hepatitis C, Dunn said.\n\n[Byline: Daphne Chen]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from Healthmap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[ProMED awaits definitive numbers related to patients thought to have been nosocomially infected.\n\nBloodborne viruses such as hepatitis B and C and HIV can be transmitted by the contamination of multidose vials with a syringe containing blood harboring the virus. If the viruses are genetically identical, not just the same genotype, this suggests that the patient was injected by a syringe containing the medicine (likely a strong analgesic, such as an opiate, that had been previously contaminated by the healthcare worker's blood).\n\nRegarding the significance of genotypes of HCV, the following is derived from a USA Veterans Administration publication http://www.hepatitis.va.gov/provider/reviews/genotypes.asp#S1X [the comments about response to therapy also relate to the newer anti-HCV modes of therapy]:\n\nAn important variable for all patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) is the 'genotype' of HCV with which they are infected. This is the strain of the virus to which they were exposed when they were infected, often many years prior to their evaluation, and it is determined by a simple blood test. Genotypes of HCV are genetically distinct groups of the virus that have arisen during its evolution (1). Approximately 75 percent of Americans with HCV have genotype 1 of the virus (subtypes 1a or 1b), and 20-25 percent have genotypes 2 or 3, with small numbers of patients infected with genotypes 4, 5, or 6 (2). Most patients with HCV are found to have only 1 principal genotype, rather than multiple genotypes (3-5). Genotype 4 is much more common in Africa than in many other parts of the world, genotype 6 is common in Southeast Asia, and each area of the world has its own distribution of genotypes (6).\n\nGenotype generally has not been found in epidemiological studies to play a large role in liver disease progression due to HCV. Rather, genotype is of clinical importance principally as a factor in response to HCV treatments. With all treatments tested to date, patients with genotypes 2 and 3 are more than twice as likely as patients with genotype 1 to achieve a sustained virological response to therapy (2-5, 7). In addition, when using combination therapy with interferon and ribavirin, patients with genotypes 2 or 3 generally are treated for only 24 weeks, whereas it is recommended that patients infected with genotype 1 receive treatment for 48 weeks.\n\n1.

The leading cause for the spread of the disease has been through dirty needles used by drug users, Boyd County Coroner Mark Hammond said.\n\nHe said the number of hepatitis C deaths stayed steady in the area until about 2011 or 2012 when 'it shot up dramatically.' But Hammond said it isn't just a local problem -- it's a statewide and national issue.\n\nHammond provided The Daily Independent with statistics from the CDC, which stated, 'The state of Kentucky is no. 1 in the nation with 4.1 hepatitis C cases per 100 000 residents.' The national average is 0.6 per 100 000 cases of hepatitis C. According to the Northern Kentucky Health Department, that region of the state has a much higher rate of cases:\u200813 per 100 000 residents.\n\nBolen said northern Kentucky has a needle-exchange program, as well as Lexington, Louisville, Jessamine County, and Carter and Elliott counties' Little Sandy Health Department. There is also a needle-exchange program in place in Huntington.\n\nHammond said heroin is the culprit in the rise of hepatitis C cases and although political leaders consistently campaign to fight the drug epidemic, little has changed. 'What I see is that no matter how much enforcement we have and no matter what we do as far as education, those numbers are climbing right back up,' Hammond said. 'We had 25 overdoses last year [2015] and most were heroin overdoses.' According to the CDC, 45 percent of Kentucky residents addicted to heroin were also addicted to opioid pain killers. Cases of hepatitis C in Kentucky increased more than 50 percent from 2007 to 2011.\n\nHammond said heroin has risen in popularity since the government cracked down on pill mills across the country. The reason, he said, is because heroin is so cheap. Hammond explained that users can typically buy a hit of heroin for USD 10 or USD 15, while pills are priced at nearly USD 30 per pill, or USD 1 per milligram. 'It (heroin) is here to stay, and it just keeps getting bigger and bigger,'\u2008Hammond said.\n\nThe coroner is also concerned about heroin users getting 'dirty' heroin, laced with other drugs that can easily cause an overdose.\n\nBolen said the needle-exchange program can be used as a tool to stymie the spread of hepatitis C, while also giving the health department an opportunity to educate addicts coming to pick up clean needles. 'We (the health department) look at it like prevention, not enabling,'\u2008Bolen said. 'Just like we hand out condoms to prevent the spread of STDs, it's a way to give them (drug users) something to prevent the spread of hepatitis C. 'Talk to former injection drug users and they'll tell you they'll use whatever they can find -- a dirty needle or a clean needle -- to feed the addiction.'\n\nThe Ashland-Boyd County Health Department is still seeking approval for the program from its board of health and local governments. Bolen said the department is also trying to choose a location for the program that would be most accessible to drug users. 'We're not really that close to rolling it out, but we're also aware there is a need in the community for this type of program,'\u2008Bolen said. 'We're trying to do our best to do all the hard stuff now so that everything will go much more smoothly when we're ready to approach the community.'\n\n[Byline: Lana Bellamy]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The numbers reported per 100 000 are those of incidence, that is, acute cases of the infection. Since most cases of acute hepatitis C are unrecognized, these are always underestimated. The increase in number of deaths from hepatitis C is not directly related to the number of new cases. The mortality is almost always related to the decades-later complications of the infection, cirrhosis and carcinoma of the liver. These complications are not inevitable and can be minimized by avoiding overuse of alcohol and by the use of one of the newer, but at this point quite expensive, HCV antiviral regimens.\n\nIn the absence of a vaccine, infection avoidance techniques such as needle exchange programs and the need for aggressive programs in counseling, not criminalizing, substance addiction are needed. - Mod.LL\n\nThe state of Kentucky can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/29048.\nA county map can be seen at http://geology.com/county-map/kentucky-county-map.gif. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ]", "summary": "Just like we hand out condoms to prevent the spread of STDs, it's a way to give them (drug users) something to prevent the spread of hepatitis C.

'In our study, it was just over 40 percent of those admitted for detoxification for heroin were positive for hepatitis C,' Nahass said. Hepatitis C is often transmitted by drug users who share their needles, since the virus is transmitted by blood and body fluids.\n\n'It's a huge problem, the numbers affected by hepatitis C that are under 35 are in the thousands, and the situation is getting worse,' Nahass said.

As president of the Hepatitis Education Awareness and Liver Support (HEALS) Group of the South, one of the problems I encounter is the increasing number of drug users contracting hepatitis C due to the sharing of needles.\n\nHepatitis C (HCV) is the most common chronic blood-borne disease, accounting for a large percentage of chronic liver disease. It's a leading cause of death in Florida. At least 60 percent of HCV cases are caused by injection drug use, the CDC says.\n\nIn Florida, the number of cases of HCV increased 133 percent between 2009 and 2013. There's no doubt this is linked to the increased rate of drug abuse. We need to increase awareness around the issue of needle sharing and implement more tools to fight against users injecting drugs in the 1st place. One preventative measure is making available opioids with abuse-deterrent properties (OADP), which are prescription painkillers that are nearly impossible to melt and inject. Because opiate use accounts for a large percentage of injection drug use, OADPs could help to limit the HCV cases and have been proven to curb abuse.\n\nI call upon Florida's lawmakers to adopt OADP in 2016 to fight drug abuse and the spread of HCV, which will save lives.\n\n[Pam Langford, President, HEALS of the South,Tallahassee, FL]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Nguyen V, Raffa RB, Taylor R, Pergolizzi JV Jr: The role of abuse-deterrent formulations in countering opioid misuse and abuse. J Clin Pharm Ther. 2015 Nov 23. doi: 10.1111/jcpt.12337. [Epub ahead of print]\n\nAbstract\n'WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVE: Pain is a prevalent and, due to the ageing population, increasing medical problem. Opioids are frequently prescribed to meet the unmet medical need. Unfortunately, with the increase in the legitimate use of opioids, there has been a corresponding increase in abuse. A practical way to retain the pain relief afforded by opioids while decreasing opportunities for abuse is to make it more difficult to extract the opioid from the product or to make it less desirable to do so by designing an abuse-deterrent formulation (ADF). We provide a brief overview of the strategies and early evidence related to opioid ADFs.\n\nMETHODS: Published and unpublished literature, websites, and other sources were searched for current opioid formulation options, including immediate-release and extended-release products. Each was summarized, reviewed and assessed.\n\nRESULTS: The strategies that have been used to design the current opioid ADFs involve one or more of 4 approaches: a physical barrier; incorporation of an opioid receptor antagonist (e.g. naloxone) that self-limits opioid action when taken in excess amount; inclusion of a noxious agent that is released during inappropriate use; or a pro-drug.\n\nWHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSIONS: Legitimate use of opioid analgesics carries with it certain risks, including the risk of abuse. The new ADFs utilize 4 major strategies and provide innovative additions to the armamentarium. They likely will become an important part of a comprehensive approach to limiting, although not eliminating, opioid misuse and abuse.'\n\nAlthough these various opioid APF approaches have potential, below is a 2012 letter to the editor which points out a potential flaw in one form of APF:\n\nCicero TJ, Ellis MS, Surratt HL: Effect of Abuse-Deterrent Formulation of OxyContin. N Engl J Med 2012; 367:187-189 http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmc1204141\n\nTo the Editor:\n'In August 2010, an abuse-deterrent formulation of the widely abused prescription opioid OxyContin was introduced. The intent was to make OxyContin more difficult to solubilize or crush, thus discouraging abuse through injection and inhalation. We examined the effect of the abuse-deterrent formulation on the abuse of OxyContin and other opioids.\n\nData were collected quarterly from 1 Jul 2009 through 31 Mar 2012 with the use of self-administered surveys that were completed anonymously by independent cohorts of 2566 patients with opioid dependence, as defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition, who were entering treatment programs around the United States and for whom a prescription opioid was the primary drug of abuse (i.e., heroin use was acceptable but could not be the patient's primary drug). Of these patients, 103 agreed to online or telephone interviews to gather qualitative information in order to amplify and interpret findings from the structured national survey.\n\nAs shown in Figure 1 [for figures, see original URL - Mod.LL], the selection of OxyContin as a primary drug of abuse decreased from 35.6 percent of respondents before the release of the abuse-deterrent formulation to just 12.8 percent 21 months later (P less than 0.001). Simultaneously, selection of hydrocodone and other oxycodone agents increased slightly, whereas for other opioids, including high-potency fentanyl and hydromorphone, selection rose markedly, from 20.1 percent to 32.3 percent (P=0.005). Of all opioids used to 'get high in the past 30 days at least once' (Figure 1B), OxyContin fell from 47.4 percent of respondents to 30.0 percent (P less than 0.001), whereas heroin use nearly doubled.\n\nInterviews with patients who abused both formulations of OxyContin indicated a unanimous preference for the older version. Although 24 percent found a way to defeat the tamper-resistant properties of the abuse-deterrent formulation, 66 percent indicated a switch to another opioid, with 'heroin' the most common response. These changes appear to be causally linked, as typified by one response: 'Most people that I know don't use OxyContin to get high anymore. They have moved on to heroin [because] it is easier to use, much cheaper, and easily available.' It is important to note that there was no evidence that OxyContin abusers ceased their drug abuse as a result of the abuse-deterrent formulation. Rather, it appears that they simply shifted their drug of choice.\n\nOur data show that an abuse-deterrent formulation successfully reduced abuse of a specific drug but also generated an unanticipated outcome: replacement of the abuse-deterrent formulation with alternative opioid medications and heroin, a drug that may pose a much greater overall risk to public health than OxyContin. Thus, abuse-deterrent formulations may not be the 'magic bullets' that many hoped they would be in solving the growing problem of opioid abuse.'\n\nClearly a multipronged approach to this extremely important problem is needed. - Mod.LL\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/212.]", "summary": "\n\nOur data show that an abuse-deterrent formulation successfully reduced abuse of a specific drug but also generated an unanticipated outcome: replacement of the abuse-deterrent formulation with alternative opioid medications and heroin, a drug that may pose a much greater overall risk to public health than OxyContin. \n\nData were collected quarterly from 1 Jul 2009 through 31 Mar 2012 with the use of self-administered surveys that were completed anonymously by independent cohorts of 2566 patients with opioid dependence, as defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition, who were entering treatment programs around the United States and for whom a prescription opioid was the primary drug of abuse (i.e., heroin use was acceptable but could not be the patient's primary drug).

The patients, most of who live in Utah but some out of state, could have been exposed to a rare strain of hepatitis C, genotype 2b.\n\nHepatitis C is a chronic condition and can lay dormant for up to 25 years and then may cause serious liver problems such as liver failure and eventually death. The possible window for exposure was from June 2013 to November 2014 at Ogden's McKay-Dee hospital.\n\nHepatitis C is a reportable disease, so when the Utah State Health Department received a hepatitis case report in 2014, they started researching its origins, The strain was a rare one that when tracked came up with a match. It led to a nurse who was fired from McKay-Dee hospital. The health department started looking at the Ogden hospital then after they'd ruled out every other possibility in a hepatitis C case they were tracking.\n\nDoctor Angela Dunn with the health department notes that the most common way of getting hepatitis C in the US is 'through IV drug use. And other less common ways are tattoos or piercings from unlicensed parlors or being born to a mother with hepatitis C.' Anyone who received a blood transfusion prior to 1992 can also be at risk. None of these risk factors were present with the man who tested positive, and that's what led investigators to the ER at McKay-Dee hospital where the man had been admitted.\n\nThe time this patient was in the ER was the same time a nurse who has since been fired was working. The health department asked the hospital to test anyone they knew who had risk factors that could present with hepatitis C. The former nurse was tested and came back positive with hepatitis C- genotype 2b, the same as the initial reported case.\n\nDunn says they 'don't know exactly how it happened in this case but that a concern is that needles could be reused and spread infectious diseases.'\n\nHepatitis C is transferred in blood-to-blood contact. The former nurse was let go for 'divergence,' or using what are assumed to be hospital issued drugs or syringes without a prescription. It is possible that needles or syringes were used by the nurse and then re-used for patients, though it is tough to prove how the disease was spread.\n\nThe disease is serious and can spread to others even when symptoms are not present, and that's why it is so important that anyone who was treated in the time frame with certain medications be tested.\n\nAccording to Dunn, hepatitis C 'does not have symptoms usually at the beginning, so it is very important if you were exposed to get tested.'\n\nNotifications, 4800 of them, were dropped in the mail on Fri 6 Nov 2015. Dunn said it is 'out of an abundance of caution we cast a very broad net.' She and hospital officials encourage 'anyone who received a letter' to 'definitely get tested.' If a test comes back positive, treatments can be administered before a patient gets sick. Dunn says 'there is really good treatment for hepatitis C' and calls it a 'curable disease.'\n\n[Byline: Heidi Hatch]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[That the alleged healthcare worker and a patient both have genotype 2b does not definitively link them without analyzing each virus's RNA genome.\n\nBloodborne viruses such as hepatitis B and C and HIV can be transmitted by the contamination of multidose vials with a syringe containing blood harboring the virus. If the viruses are genetically identical, not just the same genotype, this suggests that the patient was injected by a syringe containing the medicine (likely a strong analgesic, such as an opiate, that had been previously contaminated by the healthcare worker's blood).\n\nRegarding the significance of genotypes of HCV, the following is derived from a USA Veterans Administration publication http://www.hepatitis.va.gov/provider/reviews/genotypes.asp#S1X [the comments about response to therapy also relate to the newer anti-HCV modes of therapy]:\n\nAn important variable for all patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) is the 'genotype' of HCV with which they are infected. This is the strain of the virus to which they were exposed when they were infected, often many years prior to their evaluation, and it is determined by a simple blood test. Genotypes of HCV are genetically distinct groups of the virus that have arisen during its evolution (1). Approximately 75 percent of Americans with HCV have genotype 1 of the virus (subtypes 1a or 1b), and 20-25 percent have genotypes 2 or 3, with small numbers of patients infected with genotypes 4, 5, or 6 (2). Most patients with HCV are found to have only one principal genotype, rather than multiple genotypes (3-5). Genotype 4 is much more common in Africa than in many other parts of the world, genotype 6 is common in Southeast Asia, and each area of the world has its own distribution of genotypes (6).\n\nGenotype generally has not been found in epidemiological studies to play a large role in liver disease progression due to HCV. Rather, genotype is of clinical importance principally as a factor in response to HCV treatments. With all treatments tested to date, patients with genotypes 2 and 3 are more than twice as likely as patients with genotype 1 to achieve a sustained virological response to therapy (2-5, 7). In addition, when using combination therapy with interferon and ribavirin, patients with genotypes 2 or 3 generally are treated for only 24 weeks, whereas it is recommended that patients infected with genotype 1 receive treatment for 48 weeks.\n\n1.

Approximately 75 percent of Americans with HCV have genotype 1 of the virus (subtypes 1a or 1b), and 20-25 percent have genotypes 2 or 3, with small numbers of patients infected with genotypes 4, 5, or 6 (2). With all treatments tested to date, patients with genotypes 2 and 3 are more than twice as likely as patients with genotype 1 to achieve a sustained virological response to therapy (2-5, 7). \n\nHepatitis C is a reportable disease, so when the Utah State Health Department received a hepatitis case report in 2014, they started researching its origins, The strain was a rare one that when tracked came up with a match. \n\nDunn says they 'don't know exactly how it happened in this case but that a concern is that needles could be reused and spread infectious diseases.'\n\nHepatitis C is transferred in blood-to-blood contact.

Hadziyannis SJ, Sette H Jr, Morgan TR, et al: Peginterferon alpha-2a and ribavirin combination therapy in chronic hepatitis C: a randomized study of treatment duration and ribavirin dose. \n\nHepatitis C is a chronic condition and can lay dormant for up to 25 years and then may cause serious liver problems such as liver failure and eventually death. \n\nBloodborne viruses such as hepatitis B and C and HIV can be transmitted by the contamination of multidose vials with a syringe containing blood harboring the virus. that patients infected with genotype 1 receive treatment for 48 weeks.\n\n1. McHutchison JG, Gordon SC, Schiff ER, et al: Interferon alfa-2b alone or in combination with ribavirin as initial treatment for chronic hepatitis C. N Engl J Med 1998; 339:1485-1492. In addition, when using combination therapy with interferon and ribavirin, patients with genotypes 2 or 3 generally are treated for only 24 weeks, whereas it is recommended Genotype 4 is much more common in Africa than in many other parts of the world, genotype 6 is common in Southeast Asia, and each area of the world has its own distribution of genotypes (6). The former nurse was tested and came back positive with hepatitis C- genotype 2b, the same as the initial reported case. \n\n[Byline: Heidi Hatch]\n\n--\n promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[That the alleged healthcare worker and a patient both have genotype 2b does not definitively link them without analyzing each virus's RNA genome. Fried MW, Shiffman ML, Reddy R, et al; Peginterferon alfa-2a plus ribavirin for chronic hepatitis C virus infection. According to Dunn, hepatitis C 'does not have symptoms usually at the beginning, so it is very important if you were exposed to get tested.'\n\n The patients, most of who live in Utah but some out of state, could have been exposed to a rare strain of hepatitis C, genotype 2b. \n\nDoctor Angela Dunn with the health department notes that the most common way of getting hepatitis C in the US is 'through IV drug use. Zeuzem S. Heterogeneous virologic response rates to interferon-based therapy in patients with chronic hepatitis C: who responds less well? \n\nThe disease is serious and can spread to others even when symptoms are not present, and that's why it is so important that anyone who was treated in the time frame with certain medications be tested. \n\nGenotype generally has not been found in epidemiological studies to play a large role in liver disease progression due to HCV. And other less common ways are tattoos or piercings from unlicensed parlors or being born to a mother with hepatitis C.' Anyone who received a blood transfusion prior to 1992 can also be at risk. The health department asked the hospital to test anyone they knew who had risk factors that could present with hepatitis C. If the viruses are genetically identical, not just the same genotype, this suggests that the patient was injected by a syringe containing the medicine (likely a strong analgesic, such as an opiate, that had been previously contaminated by the healthcare worker's blood). Most patients with HCV are found to have only one principal genotype, rather than multiple genotypes (3-5). The health department started looking at the Ogden hospital then after they'd ruled out every other possibility in a hepatitis C case they were tracking.

Within the last year there's been an increase of testing for the virus at the health department. Director Dr. Martha Buchanan says her staff will be looking at that data and determining what can be done. 'The best protection you have is knowledge and knowing what behaviors and what things put you at risk,' said Buchanan.\n\nThe rate of acute hepatitis C cases in Tennessee has more than tripled in the last 7 years, and the steadily increasing number of cases may only represent 'the tip of the iceberg' of the state's hepatitis C epidemic, according to TDH Commissioner John Dreyzehner, MD, MPH.\n\n'Anyone who has injected drugs and shared needles needs to be tested. Anyone who lives in a household that knows they have hepatitis C and maybe shared toothbrushes or razors needs to be tested,' added Dr. Buchanan.\n\n'In addition to reported cases of acute hepatitis C it is estimated that more than 100 000 Tennesseans may be living with chronic hepatitis C and not know it,' Dreyzehner said. 'Many people have hepatitis C for years, not realizing it, while the viral infection slowly destroys their livers.'\n\nThere is no vaccine to prevent hepatitis C, so efforts to avoid exposure to infected blood are most important in preventing the spread of the disease. Most of the increase in transmission of hepatitis C in Tennessee is due to the sharing of contaminated needles and syringes among intravenous drug users who are abusing both legal and illegal pain medicines.\n\nOnce infected with hepatitis C, some people may recover fully, but most, 70 to 85 percent, will develop long-term infection. Early symptoms of hepatitis C infection can include fatigue, abdominal pain, itching and dark urine. Many people, however, are not aware they have the disease until the virus has already caused liver cancer or liver damage.\n\nKnowing these risk factors and what to look out for is important because there's no vaccine available to prevent it from spreading, just treatments. 'Knowing what to do to protect your family members and knowing what to keep yourself healthy is really what we want to get out there right now,' said Dr. Buchanan.\n\nIt's also suggested that if you were born between 1945 through 1965 to get tested once for hepatitis C, just in case.\n\nThe treatment for hepatitis C is currently expensive and a person can later become re-infected. A recent CDC report shows hepatitis C is the most common blood-borne infection in the USA, with approximately 3 million people living with the infection. That report, available online and includes information about a 364 percent increase in hepatitis C in four Appalachian states, including Tennessee, between 2006 and 2012.\n\n[Byline: Laura Halm]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Needle exchange programs and availability of rehabilitation programs are vital in the approach to injection drug use-associated infectious diseases including HIV and hepatitis B as well as hepatitis C. - Mod.LL]\n\n[While treatment is expensive, it is cost-effective compared with other healthcare expenses.

Left untreated, serious damage to the liver can result, which can be fatal.\n\nDiagnosis in ACT / 2012 / 2013\nHepatitis B / 106 / 111\nHepatitis C / 147 / 184\n\nJohn Didlick from Hepatitis ACT said there are an estimated 8000 people in the ACT living with viral hepatitis, including 4000 with hepatitis C.\n\n'We estimate that half are already in what we call the 'liver danger zone',' he said.

'A diagnosis of hepatitis C, or any other blood-borne virus, can lead to better management, and also the prevention of onward transmission.'But Mr Didlick said those at risk of hepatitis often do not seek treatment, due to the stigma surrounding the viruses in the community.\n\n'People living with hepatitis B or hepatitis C are often silenced both by themselves, and by external factors,' he said. 'We need governments and key public health officials to choose to address the invisibility of viral hepatitis. Not only will that shine a light on a neglected epidemic but it will also encourage affected communities to speak out and seek help.'\n\nHe said the most marginalised parts of the community were at the greatest risk of contracting the virus. 'The most at risk for hepatitis C are people who inject drugs, have a history of injecting drugs, also people in our prison system.'\n\nMr Didlick also called on the Federal Government to give patients better access to the latest treatments for the virus. 'There are advanced new hepatitis C medicines in use in other parts of the world right now that are not available here,' he said.

He has been newly diagnosed with hepatitis C and is in need of treatment to reduce the risk of developing liver cancer and cirrhosis. 'But the money for medication isn't available to normal people.'\n\nThis is the plight of many Russians diagnosed with chronic hepatitis C. More than 4 million people in the country have the virus, where without medication, the risk of scarring of the liver due to long-term damage is up to 30 percent within 20 years. While drugs have been available to cure hepatitis C for some time, patent barriers and sky-high prices of oral treatments have priced many out of treatment. The most vulnerable groups susceptible to the virus -- the poor and those injecting drugs -- are left to await their fate.\n\n'The incidence of acute hepatitis C virus [HCV] infection has been decreasing since 2000 and has stabilized since 2008 at the level of 1.5 per 100 000 population,' says Tsvetelina Parvanova, of the World Health Organization. 'However, the incidence of chronic HCV infection has appeared to increase over the last 10 years -- reaching 58.5 per 100 000 population.'\n\nHepatitis C is a liver disease caused by the hepatitis C virus, a blood-borne virus that is largely spread through sharing needles or other equipment to inject drugs. In Russia, where between 2 and 3 million are estimated to inject drugs, the crisis is accelerating. 'Currently, the majority of new hepatitis C infections occur among people who inject drugs,' Parvanova says. 'This group is also the most affected when it comes to the prevalence of chronic HCV infection, which range between 45 and 90 percent in different regions of the country.\n\n'Chronic hepatitis C infection in Russia has grown alongside the socioeconomic crisis that followed the collapse of the Soviet Union. As poverty levels rose, the healthcare system collapsed and the number of drug users soared -- allowing rates of infection with hepatitis C, HIV and tuberculosis to surge.\n\nRussia has high rates of hepatitis C and HIV fuelled by injection drug use. Both hepatitis C and HIV -- Russia's other epidemic -- are fuelled by the country's high number of injection drug users. While HIV rates have declined globally, they have increased in Russia: from 170 000 a decade ago to around 1.2 million today. Experts place much of the blame on the Kremlin, pointing to its long-standing ban on methadone used globally in heroin addiction treatment.\n\n'The risk factors are the same for hepatitis C and HIV because they are both blood-borne viruses, so viruses which can be contracted by blood-to-blood contact,' a spokesperson from the Hepatitis C Trust told IBTimes UK. 'So therefore the risk groups and risk factors are the same, such as injection drug users who share needles or drug users who share any sort of drug equipment. Hepatitis C and HIV can both be transmitted that way and there is a relatively large proportion of people who are co-infected with both viruses.'\n\nOne of the key issues driving the spread of chronic hepatitis C is a lack of harm reduction interventions aimed at drug users -- which have proved fundamental in bringing down rates of hepatitis and HIV globally. Methadone -- used in Opioid Replacement Therapy to wean users off heroin -- is banned in Russian clinics, despite it being included on the WHO's list of essential medicines. Under Russian federal law, those who use or distribute the heroin substitute face up to 20 years in prison. Clean needle exchange programs are rare. Such programs used to be financed by the Global Fund, an NGO tackling the transmission of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria, but stopped when the country withdrew from the fund in 2010. The move, viewed by critics as an entirely political attempt by the Kremlin to crack down on the operation of foreign NGOs in the country, has done nothing to help curb the spread of hepatitis C through drug equipment.\n\n[Byline: Lydia Smith]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Without an effective hepatitis C vaccine, controlling HCV in the illicit drug injecting population in Russia requires the same methodology mentioned in the post that is discussed in a number of recent posts about hepatitis C in the same cohort in the USA: providing counseling and rehabilitation and clean needle exchange programs. - Mod.LL\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/98.]", "summary": "However, the incidence of chronic HCV infection has appeared to increase over the last 10 years -- reaching 58.5 per 100 000 population.'\n\nHepatitis C is a liver disease caused by the hepatitis C virus, a blood-borne virus that is largely spread through sharing needles or other equipment to inject drugs.

Now, the Santa Barbara County Public Health Department is urging any patients who visited the medical office of Allen Thomashefsky to get tested for hepatitis B, hepatitis C and HIV.\n\nPublic health officials performed 2 inspections at the doctor's office in November 2014 after they received information that a patient with no known risk factors developed hepatitis C after a visit. The patient underwent multiple injections at his office. Inspectors examined the office and found unsafe practices that put patients at risk for bloodborne viruses as well as joint infections, according to the department. Public health officials say inspectors found that standard infection control procedures were not practiced. The multiple medical breaches led public health officials to order the doctor to close his office, which was done 19 Mar 2015.\n\nThe doctor performed regenerative injection therapy, or prolotherapy, to treat patients with chronic muscle or joint pain.\n\nThe Oregon Medical Board is also investigating the doctor and has limited his medical practice in the state. The doctor, who has an office in Ashland, Oregon, was ordered 14 Apr 2015 to stop performing injection procedures.\n\nFour of the 5 patients who tested positive for hepatitis C had undergone injection procedures at his medical office on the same day they became infected [see below - Mod.LL]. Three patients had no known risk factors for hepatitis C, an infection that attacks the liver and causes inflammation. Public health officials have performed 240 tests and no patients have tested positive for HIV. The department has been contacting the doctor's patients who received injections in the last 7 years.\n\nThe CDC is also performing molecular genetic testing to determine if the hepatitis C virus found in the infected patients originates from the same source.

Short for 'proliferation therapy,' Prolotherapy is also known as nonsurgical ligament and tendon reconstruction, or regenerative injection therapy. Prolotherapy works by stimulating the body's own natural healing mechanisms to repair injured musculoskeletal tissue. The treatment originated in the 1930's when Dr. Earl Gedney, an osteopathic surgeon successfully treated his own severe hand injury. Prolotherapy works by getting the body to use its own natural healing mechanisms to repair injured and painful joint areas. Types of Prolotherapy include Dextrose Prolotherapy, Platelet Rich Plasma Prolotherapy (referred to as 'PRP') or bone marrow and/or fat (adipose) tissue from an individual's own body which contain adult stem stromal cells (known as Biocellular Prolotherapy).'\n\nBelow are 2 selected reports about the technology:\nCoombes BK, Bisset L, Vicenzino B: Efficacy and safety of corticosteroid injections and other injections for management of tendinopathy: a systematic review of randomised controlled trials.

Despite its long history and widespread use as a form of complementary therapy, there still are disparities over its optimal indications and injection preparations. There are, however, numerous studies available regarding the use and efficacy of prolotherapy for various musculoskeletal conditions. The most frequently published indication is in the treatment of chronic low back pain, but there are recent studies that examined its use in the management of refractory tendinopathies as well as osteoarthritis. There is growing evidence to suggest that prolotherapy may be helpful in treating chronic low back pain when coupled with adjunctive therapies, such as spinal manipulation or corticosteroid injections. There is also evidence to suggest that prolotherapy is effective in treating refractory tendinopathies, particularly for lateral epicondylosis and Achilles tendinopathy. Additional larger, randomized controlled trials are needed to make specific recommendations regarding ideal protocols and indications. There is emerging evidence for the use of prolotherapy as a treatment option for osteoarthritis; however, further studies are needed to conclusively demonstrate its efficacy. Overall, prolotherapy remains a promising option for the treatment of painful musculoskeletal conditions, particularly when other standard treatments have proved ineffective.'\n\nWhether the therapy is effective or not is not the issue here, but rather that injections of substances have to be non-infectious. The inadequate infection control techniques used in the doctor's office are what caused the presumed transmission of hepatitis C virus (HCV). It is not clear what information the statement '4 of the 5 patients who tested positive for hepatitis C had undergone injection procedures at his medical office on the same day they became infected' is based on, as HCV viral load (the 1st HCV marker to become positive) is not likely to be detectable on the day of exposure.\n\nHepatitis C is a viral infection of the liver caused by the hepatitis C virus. Hepatitis C can lead to lifelong (chronic) infection and can cause serious liver damage (cirrhosis or liver cancer) and death. About 80 percent or more of people infected with HCV have mild or no signs or symptoms initially. Symptoms may include tiredness, loss of appetite, nausea, abdominal discomfort, vomiting, dark urine or jaundice (i.e., yellowing of skin or whites of eyes). Some people recover fully, but 85 percent or more of infected people carry the virus in their blood for a lifetime and develop chronic infection. New therapies for HCV have been developed with excellent cure rates, even in those co-infected with HIV and HCV, but the drug costs have limited use at this time. - Mod.LL\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/4750.]", "summary": "From abstract:\n----------------\n'By comparison with placebo, reductions in pain were reported after injections of sodium hyaluronate (short [3.91, 3.54-4.28, p less than 0.0001], intermediate [2.89, 2.58-3.20, p less than 0.0001], and long [3.91, 3.55-4.28, p less than 0.0001] terms), botulinum toxin (short term [1.23, 0.67-1.78, p less than 0.0001]), and prolotherapy (intermediate term [2.62, 1.36-3.88, p less than 0.0001]) for treatment of lateral epicondylalgia.

Most of those drug users, they note, are people younger than 30 who probably used contaminated syringes.\n\nThe hepatitis C virus, which is the leading cause of liver cancer and was 1st able to be tested for in the 1980s, was mostly contracted by baby boomers from blood transfusions, medical procedures as well as through intravenous drug use. But with education, blood screenings and needle exchange programs, the number of new cases of hepatitis C declined significantly since then. Now, the numbers are climbing as a result of an intravenous drug crisis.\n\n'Today, the most cases are occurring in people under the age of 30,' said Kevin Cranston, director of the state Department of Public Health's Bureau of Infectious Diseases. 'The heroin epidemic is resulting in a hepatitis C epidemic in a new generation of injectors.' Mr. Cranston said for the past few years, over 2000 new cases of hepatitis C have been identified annually in the under-30 age group in Massachusetts. About 200 of those cases are in Worcester County.\n\nJesse Pack, director of prevention and screening at AIDS Project Worcester, said the agency has worked with more than 700 injection drug users over the past 2 years, and half are younger than 30. 10 years ago, APW worked with about 200 IV drug users annually. Most of them were middle-aged. The agency, which provides prevention education, vouchers for new syringes for adults, treatment assistance and testing resources, returns at least 1 positive hepatitis C test result a week. Most positive results are for people younger than 30.\n\nDr. Erik J. Garcia, who treats some IV opioid drug users over age 15 through Community Healthlink, said young people typically start by secretly taking some of their parents' prescribed painkillers that go unnoticed. Some young people also become addicted by using pain medications prescribed to them after a sports injury. Once the prescription drugs are no longer accessible, they turn to heroin, which is cheaper and often more readily available than painkillers purchased on the street, he said.\n\n'Now you have a situation where a person has transitioned from a gateway drug into an addiction, and to heroin. A progression that ultimately leads to hepatitis C,' Dr. Garcia said.\n\nDr. Garcia said 90 percent of people who use intravenous drugs have been exposed to hepatitis C. Exposure usually happens within the 1st 12 months of use.\n\nMr. Pack at APW said his agency educates young drug-using clients about HIV and hepatitis C and how to remain uninfected even if they are still using drugs. Free confidential screenings are also offered so that people who are infected can get into treatment sooner, making it much less likely they will infect others. 'But young adults in general don't see these infections as something that could affect them personally,' he said. Adding comprehensive, age-appropriate substance abuse education in public schools would help young people get a better idea of the risks and consequences, he suggested.\n\nMassachusetts health officials say needle exchange programs implemented here in the early 1990s are key to not seeing a major HIV outbreak like Indiana's.\n\nIn addition to that, they cite statutes enacted in 2006 that decriminalized the possession of syringes and allowed over-the-counter purchase of syringes at pharmacies. The state also began to require communities to have syringe disposal systems, where people can safely dispose of syringes.\n\nIn March, the state public health lab also began automatically testing every blood sample sent there for both HIV and hepatitis C.\n\nOnly 5 communities have needle exchange programs which have to be approved by local officials. Those programs are located in Boston, Cambridge, Provincetown, Northampton and Holyoke. Worcester City Council in the mid-1990s passed an ordinance barring needle exchange programs. Some thought such a program would attract drug users to the city and send the message that drug use was condoned.\n\n'Unfortunately, what they missed is that's not the message that we'd be giving,' said Dr. Garcia. 'The message would be: Obviously we care about your health. We care about your life. Just because you suffer from an addiction does not mean you should be exposed to HIV or hepatitis C.'\n\nIn addition to establishing a needle exchange program in Worcester, Dr. Garcia suggested other means to addressing the heroin and opioid crisis. It can be better stopped at the onset by making the medical system more accountable for the opiates they prescribe. Medical providers, he said, are the source of many of the illegally used drugs, unbeknownst to them. Parents should also be educated about safe and responsible storage of medications so their children don't have access to them. Young people also should be educated about drug use. More programs for addicted youths separate from adults are also needed, he said.\n\nGiven the current crisis in opioid abuse and task forces set up to try to address the problem, the time may have come for Worcester to consider having a needle exchange program. Worcester City Manager Edward M. Augustus Jr., who serves on a task force, said all options are on the table. 'These are complicated issues that will require thoughtful public discussion, but I won't close the door to any potential solutions,' he said in an email.\n\n[Byline: Elaine Thompson]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@pormedmail.org>\n\n[Most diagnoses of hepatitis C are not finding newly infected patients as almost all are already chronically infected. Although in many areas it is a political 'hot potato,' needle exchange programs are effective in decreasing transmission of blood-borne viruses such as hepatitis B and C and HIV by avoiding sharing of needles.

A ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n \n\nJesse Pack, director of prevention and screening at AIDS Project Worcester, said the agency has worked with more than 700 injection drug users over the past 2 years, and half are younger than 30. \n\nThe hepatitis C virus, which is the leading cause of liver cancer and was 1st able to be tested for in the 1980s, was mostly contracted by baby boomers from blood transfusions, medical procedures as well as through intravenous drug use. \n\nMr. Pack at APW said his agency educates young drug-using clients about HIV and hepatitis C and how to remain uninfected even if they are still using drugs. Communicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@pormedmail.org>\n\n[Most diagnoses of hepatitis C are not finding newly infected patients as almost all are already chronically infected. \n\n'Today, the most cases are occurring in people under the age of 30,' said Kevin Cranston, director of the state Department of Public Health's Bureau of Infectious Diseases. ' \n\nMassachusetts health officials say needle exchange programs implemented here in the early 1990s are key to not seeing a major HIV outbreak like Indiana's. But with education, blood screenings and needle exchange programs, the number of new cases of hepatitis C declined significantly since then. Although in many areas it is a political 'hot potato,' needle exchange programs are effective in decreasing transmission of blood-borne viruses such as hepatitis B and C and HIV by avoiding sharing of needles. Mr. Cranston said for the past few years, over 2000 new cases of hepatitis C have been identified annually in the under-30 age group in Massachusetts. The agency, which provides prevention education, vouchers for new syringes for adults, treatment assistance and testing resources, returns at least 1 positive hepatitis C test result a week. Some thought such a program would attract drug users to the city and send the message that drug use was condoned. Most of those drug users, they note, are people younger than 30 who probably used contaminated syringes.

Percutaneous exposure to contaminated blood is the most efficient mode of transmission, and in the USA, injection drug use (IDU) is the primary risk factor for infection. State surveillance reports from the period 2006-2012 reveal a nationwide increase in reported cases of acute HCV infection, with the largest increases occurring east of the Mississippi River, particularly among states in central Appalachia (2). Demographic and behavioral data accompanying these reports show young persons (aged 30 years or less) from nonurban areas contributed to the majority of cases, with about 73 percent citing IDU as a principal risk factor. To better understand the increase in acute cases of HCV infection and its correlation to IDU, CDC examined surveillance data for acute case reports in conjunction with analyzing drug treatment admissions data from the Treatment Episode Data Set-Admissions (TEDS-A) among persons aged 30 years or less in 4 states (Kentucky, Tennessee, Virginia, and West Virginia) for the period 2006-2012. During this period, significant increases in cases of acute HCV infection were found among persons in both urban and nonurban areas, with a substantially higher incidence observed each year among persons residing in nonurban areas. (Note: From 2006 to 2012 acute hepatitis C was defined for surveillance as laboratory-confirmed infection with acute illness of discreet onset. Acute illness was considered as the presence of any sign or symptom of acute viral hepatitis plus either jaundice or elevated alanine aminotransferase greater than 400 IU/L. In 2012, the surveillance case definition was expanded to include cases with negative HCV antibody followed by positive antibody within 6 months).\n\nDuring the same period, the proportion of treatment admissions for opioid dependency increased 21.1 percent in the 4 states, with a significant increase in the proportion of persons admitted who identified injecting as their main route of drug administration (an increase of 12.6 percent). Taken together, these increases indicate a geographic intersection among opioid abuse, drug injecting, and HCV infection in central Appalachia and underscore the need for integrated health services in substance abuse treatment settings to prevent HCV infection and ensure that those who are infected receive medical care.\n\nConfirmed cases of acute HCV infection and associated demographic and risk characteristics were obtained from the National Notifiable Disease Surveillance System (NNDSS) for Kentucky, Tennessee, Virginia, and West Virginia for the period 2006-2012 for persons aged 30 years old or less. Surveillance case reports met the clinical and laboratory markers of confirmed cases of acute HCV infection as defined by CDC/CSTE. A case report was classified as 'urban' if the person lived in a metropolitan county with at least 50 000 population and as 'nonurban' if the person lived in a nonmetropolitan county with less than 50 000 population. The percentage of cases reported for the period 2006-2012 among persons aged 30 years or less in the 4 states were examined by demographic and risk characteristics (IDU versus non-IDU) and by urbanicity. In addition, using the number of cases reported through NNDSS as the numerator and the mid-year (July) population estimates for persons aged 30 years or less from the Census Bureau as the denominator, annual incidence rates for the period 2006-2012 were calculated and analyzed by urbanicity. Linear trends in annual incidence were determined by the Spearman correlation trend test and were considered statistically significant at p less than 0.05.\n\nTEDS-A contains data on admissions to substance abuse treatment facilities in the USA, by year and state, among patients aged at least 12 years. For each admission, up to 3 'substances of abuse' with a corresponding route of administration and demographic characteristics might be reported. TEDS-A classifies opioids into 3 categories: heroin, nonprescription methadone, and opiates and synthetics. For this report, 3 types of admissions were defined: heroin admission, prescription opioid admission (includes nonprescription methadone and opiates and synthetics), and any opioid admission (includes heroin and prescription opioids). In addition, 2 types of drug injection were defined: any opioid injection (includes injection of heroin and/or prescription opioids) and nonopioid injection (includes injection of any substance not classified as an opioid [e.g., cocaine]). The annual percentage of patient admissions among persons aged 12-29 years in Kentucky, Tennessee, Virginia, and West Virginia was calculated by type of admission and by drug injection for the period 2006-2012. Denominators for all percentages were the total number of reported treatment admissions for persons aged 12-29 years in that year in the 4 states. Further, the difference in the percentage of each admission type from 2006 to 2012 was calculated. Significance of a monotonic trend for any-opioid and nonopioid injection was determined by the Mann-Kendall test. Trends were considered statistically significant at p less than 0.05.\n\nDuring 2006-2012, a total of 1377 cases of acute HCV infection were reported to CDC from Kentucky, Tennessee, Virginia, and West Virginia. Of the 1374 cases with a recorded age and classified as either urban or nonurban, 616 (44.8 percent) were among persons aged 30 years or less. The median age of persons with acute infection was 25 years in both nonurban (range = 6-30 years) and urban (range = 6-30 years) counties (Table [for Table and Figures, see original URL - Mod. LL]). Of the number of cases in persons aged 30 years or less in nonurban counties, 247 (78.4 percent) were in non-Hispanic whites, and 156 (49.5 percent) in males; in urban counties, 249 (82.7 percent) cases were in non-Hispanic whites, and 155 (51.5 percent) were in males. Among the 265 (43.0 percent) cases in both urban and nonurban counties with identified risks for HCV infection, 196 (73.1 percent) were among persons who reported IDU, with similar percentages by urbanicity (urban = 99 [71.7 percent], nonurban 95 [74.8 percent]). During 2006-2012, a significant increase occurred in the incidence of acute HCV infection among young persons in both nonurban (p=0.007) and urban counties (p less than 0.001) in the four states (Figure 1). However, in each year, incidence was more than twice the rate among persons who resided in nonurban compared with urban areas.\n\nAmong all treatment admissions for persons aged 12-29 years in the 4 states, the change in the proportion of any-opioid admissions increased by 21.1percent from 2006 to 2012 (Figure 2). In addition, increases of 16.8 percent and 7.4 percent were observed in the proportion of prescription opioid admissions and heroin admissions, respectively. Further, from 2006 to 2012, the proportion of admissions related to any-opioid injection increased by 12.6 percent, and the proportion of admissions of a patient reporting nonopioid injection increased by 2.1 percent. Both trends (any-opioid and nonopioid injections) were significant (p less than 0.05) over the 7-year period (Figure 3).\n\nDiscussion\n-------------\nSurveillance data from four states (Kentucky, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia) showed a substantial increase (364 percent) in the number of cases of acute HCV infection from 2006 to 2012 among persons aged 30 years or less. Those affected were primarily non-Hispanic-white residents from both urban and nonurban areas, with more than double the rate of cases from nonurban areas. Urban and nonurban cases had the same distribution by sex. Among cases with identified risk information, IDU was most commonly reported (73 percent). Similar increases among persons with analogous demographic characteristics have been reported over the period (2006-2012) in Massachusetts (3), Wisconsin (4) and upstate New York (5).\n\nDuring this same period, these four states experienced an increase in the number of adolescents and young adults (aged 12-29 years) admitted to substance abuse treatment for opioid dependency (based on criteria of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition), with prescription opioid abuse accounting for about one third of all treatment admissions (compared with 8.3 percent of admissions for heroin). However, during 2011-2012, the proportion of heroin admissions increased (from 8.6 percent to 12.0 percent) at the same time as the proportion of prescription opioid admissions decreased. This regional increase in heroin use is consistent with national survey reports estimating an increase in first-time heroin use from 90 000 persons in 2006 to 156 000 persons in 2012, with 3 out of 4 persons who used heroin and prescription opioids in the past year reporting prescription opioid misuse before initiating heroin, and a doubling of the number of persons reporting heroin dependency from 214 000 in 2002 to 467 000 in 2012 (6). The concomitant increase in the proportion of treatment admissions for prescription opioid abuse, heroin abuse, and the number of admitted patients who report injecting suggests that the increase in acute HCV infections in central Appalachia is highly correlated with the region's epidemic of prescription opioid abuse (7) and facilitated by an upsurge in the number of persons who inject drugs in these four states. Increases in the incidence of HCV infection have the potential to thwart the nation's effort to control morbidity and mortality associated with HCV infection, in addition to undermining the USA Department of Health and Human Services' Action Plan for the Prevention, Care, and Treatment of Viral Hepatitis (8), which has set reducing HCV infections caused by drug use behaviors as a priority area.\n\nThe findings in this report are subject to at least 7 limitations. First, the inability to link identified HCV cases to individual treatment admissions makes this analysis ecologic; therefore, the concomitant increase of acute HCV cases and prescription opioid admissions among persons reporting IDU should not be considered causally related. Still, IDU is the primary risk factor for HCV infection in the USA, and 73 percent of acute case reports with identified risks for HCV infection specify IDU. Second, the current surveillance case definition for acute HCV infection captures only persons with signs and symptoms of illness, and because acute infections are often asymptomatic, the underreporting of cases is likely. Third, because acute hepatitis C incidence by state and county were calculated from passive and voluntary case reporting to NNDSS, these data should not be interpreted as definitive state and county incidence estimates. Fourth, acute hepatitis C cases are reported by sources of past or present medical care; consequently, some populations at risk for HCV infection (e.g., incarcerated, homeless, and uninsured persons) with limited or no access to care are likely to be underrepresented in surveillance reporting. Fifth, multiple treatment admissions by a single individual (i.e., readmissions) might have occurred within and across years and/or states and cannot be excluded from the analysis of the TEDS-A dataset. Sixth, it was not possible to analyze admission data from TEDS-A by the urbanization classification scheme because geographic identifiers represented a treatment facility's location and not a patient's residence. Finally, reporting requirements for substance abuse admissions to TEDS-A vary by state. This report likely does not capture all substance abuse treatment admissions within a state, but TEDS-A is estimated to include 67 percent of all substance abuse admissions and 83 percent among TEDS-A-eligible admissions in the USA.\n\nAlthough the prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection among young persons who inject drugs in central Appalachia is currently low, the regional increase in cases of acute HCV infection described in this report raises concerns about the potential for an increase in HIV infections because IDU is a risk factor for both HCV and HIV infection (9). Thus, integrated health care services are needed to treat substance abuse and prevent and treat blood-borne infections deriving from illicit drug use behaviors (10). Because persons who inject drugs underutilize health services, additional efforts are urgently needed to enlist them into substance abuse treatment, ensure they are tested for HCV, and link those with HCV infection into care to receive appropriate treatment. These efforts will require further collaboration among federal partners and state and local health departments, particularly in those regions most heavily impacted, to better address the syndemic of opioid abuse and HCV infection.\n\nReferences\n-------------\n1.

Fourth, acute hepatitis C cases are reported by sources of past or present medical care; consequently, some populations at risk for HCV infection (e.g., incarcerated, homeless, and uninsured persons) with limited or no access to care are likely to be underrepresented in surveillance reporting. Increases in the incidence of HCV infection have the potential to thwart the nation's effort to control morbidity and mortality associated with HCV infection, in addition to undermining the USA Department of Health and Human Services' Action Plan for the Prevention, Care, and Treatment of Viral Hepatitis (8), which has set reducing HCV infections caused by drug use behaviors as a priority area. In addition, 2 types of drug injection were defined: any opioid injection (includes injection of heroin and/or prescription opioids) and nonopioid injection (includes injection of any substance not classified as an opioid [e.g., cocaine]). For this report, 3 types of admissions were defined: heroin admission, prescription opioid admission (includes nonprescription methadone and opiates and synthetics), and any opioid admission (includes heroin and prescription opioids). Second, the current surveillance case definition for acute HCV infection captures only persons with signs and symptoms of illness, and because acute infections are often asymptomatic, the underreporting of cases is likely. In addition, increases of 16.8 percent and 7.4 percent were observed in the proportion of prescription opioid admissions and heroin admissions, respectively. Because persons who inject drugs underutilize health services, additional efforts are urgently needed to enlist them into substance abuse treatment, ensure they are tested for HCV, and link those with HCV infection into care to receive appropriate treatment. Denominators for all percentages were the total number of reported treatment admissions for persons aged 12-29 years in that year in the 4 states. Still, IDU is the primary risk factor for HCV infection in the USA, and 73 percent of acute case reports with identified risks for HCV infection specify IDU. Of the 1374 cases with a recorded age and classified as either urban or nonurban, 616 (44.8 percent) were among persons aged 30 years or less.

Since the investigation began last August 2013, the Health Department has tested at least 500 people for exposure to the virus. All of the confirmed cases have been current or former residents of Manor Care Health Services in Minot.\n\nState Epidemiologist Tracy Miller said it's important to note that the latest case was likely exposed to hepatitis C in 2011 or 2012. No newly infected cases have been found in people with exposures associated with the outbreak since October 2013, the department said in a news release. The Health Department is still conducting tests.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[According to the ND Department of Health website, the viruses are genetically related and epidemiologically linked to the nursing home. Little data are available related to the outbreak otherwise. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is transmitted generally by blood contact via transfusion or shared needle or sharps exposure. In a nosocomial setting, a number of outbreaks of hepatitis, either B or C, have been linked to a number of situations such as glucose point of care testing via inadvertent contamination of testing equipment and medication contamination by drug-abusing health care workers.\n\nUnlike hepatitis A and B, acute manifestations of HCV infection are quite uncommon and the infection is generally found serologically. Chronic infection may occur in 85-90 percent of cases but clearance seems to be higher when acute infection is overt and when acquired in childhood. As compared to hepatitis B, sexual transmission and perinatal transmission are much less common. No vaccine is yet available and gamma globulin preparations do not seem to prevent transmission when used post exposure. A certain percentage of infected individuals will slowly progress to cirrhosis and some will develop liver cancer but these complications are usually over decades. At least in a geriatric nursing home setting, HCV is not likely to be a significant issue in morbidity or mortality.\n\nThe therapeutic bandwidth for hepatitis C is expanding rapidly since the time when the interferon and ribavirin combination was the only choice. A number of highly effective medications have recently or will soon reach the marketplace and will change the playing field. Although cost of therapy can be an issue, the cost savings in preventing the medical costs of cirrhosis and liver cancer should be entered into the equation. Not all individuals with chronic HCV infection develop cirrhosis and/or liver cancer and most, when they die, will die with HCV and not from HCV.

The problem comes in tandem with rising intravenous use of heroin and prescription painkillers nationwide.\n\nIn Kentucky, Democratic Gov. Steve Beshear last week [25 Mar 2015] signed a bill into law aimed at combating the state's epidemic of heroin and painkiller abuse. One provision allows local health departments to set up needle exchanges after obtaining approval from city and county governments.\n\nAnd in Indiana, a surge in HIV cases linked to injecting the prescription painkiller Opana [oxymorphone] in a rural county prompted Republican Gov. Mike Pence to declare a public-health emergency last week [26 Mar 2015]. He issued an executive order authorizing the temporary dispensing of clean needles in Scott County, near the Kentucky border, despite his personal opposition to such programs and a state law barring them.\n\nExchanges allow drug users to anonymously obtain clean syringes and dispose of used ones. The aim is to help people avoid sharing needles that may be contaminated with viruses or other pathogens.\n\nPolitical opposition to such exchanges can run deep, especially in conservative areas. While backers contend the programs reduce the transmission of disease and potentially connect addicts with treatment programs, opponents say they sanction drug use and dissuade users from seeking help. Now, 'the opiate epidemic is changing the political calculus around syringe exchanges,' said Daniel Raymond, policy director at the Harm Reduction Coalition, an advocacy organization on health issues related to drug use.\n\nOther states and municipalities have helped pave the way for needle exchanges. In the past few years, Nevada passed a measure allowing them, while 2 cities in Ohio have set them up -- Cincinnati and Portsmouth, both on the Kentucky border. This year, Florida lawmakers are weighing a proposal to launch a pilot needle-exchange program in Miami-Dade County.\n\nThe US has about 200 syringe programs in 33 states and the District of Columbia, according to the North American Syringe Exchange Network, a nonprofit. The White House Office of National Drug Control Policy supports such exchanges. Federal funding for them is banned by law, but they can receive local, state and not-for-profit funding.\n\nWhile the HIV outbreak in Indiana alarms public-health experts, many worry more about hepatitis C. It spreads more easily among people who share needles and other injection equipment than HIV does, because it can live outside the body longer, said Kathie Kane-Willis, director of the Illinois Consortium on Drug Policy.

According to Dr Peter Beyer, Essential Medicines Advisor at WHO, the greatest challenges to fighting HCV in Africa are drug access and affordability. HCV is 4 times more contagious than HIV and, along with hepatitis B, poses substantial public health risk because chronic infection can lead to liver cirrhosis and liver cancer, the most common cause of liver-related deaths in Africa.\n\nHepatitis C is a bloodborne virus that is transmitted through exposure to previously contaminated blood. In remote hospitals and care stations, inadequately sterilized syringes and needles and the sharing of injection equipment lead often to HCV infections. Injected drug use outside hospital settings, contaminated body piercing and tattooing needles have also contributed to the epidemic. HCV can be transmitted sexually, though rarely, but not through breast milk, water, food, or by hugging and kissing. Once infected, the person can go up to 30 years without noticing symptoms, a fact which makes combating its spread difficult in remote areas. Most often, patients arrive at hospitals and care stations with acute symptoms when treatment options are most limited.\n\nAccording to a 2013 study, researchers found that Africa had the highest prevalence rate of HCV in the world. According to their estimates, 1 in 20 Africans is infected with HCV, nearly 32 million people. The highest prevalence of infection among African nations, and worldwide, is in Egypt where 5 million people carry the virus. By comparison, Europe has the lowest prevalence rate of 1.03 percent, followed by the Americas at 1.7 percent. It is estimated that close to 170 million people carry the hepatitis C virus worldwide, nearly 3 percent of the world's population.\n\nThe high HCV infection rate in Egypt has long been a concern for Egyptian health organizations. The high prevalence rate of HCV in Egypt is due to unsanitary treatment campaigns for epidemic levels of waterborne schistosomiasis that infected Egyptians in the 1960s and 70s. Vaccine treatments were carried out on millions of people and involved multiple injections, often using disposable syringes, which were not properly sanitized. As a result, deaths from liver disease are expected to rise significantly in the next 20 years in Egypt from chronic HCV infections.\n\nCentral African nations also suffer some of the highest HCV infection rates in Africa. The African nations of Cameroon and Burundi, with combined populations of over 30 million people, have infection rates of between 11 and 13 percent of the population. Combating infectious diseases in remote villages has proved difficult for international health organizations where screening and treatment options are limited. The WHO plans to help combat the spread of HCV by educating people on the disease, its risks and its prevention. In April 2014, the WHO updated its HCV treatment guidelines which it hopes to disseminate to rural areas in Africa and elsewhere.\n\nGilead Sciences and Janssen Therapeutics, whose HCV medications Sovaldi and Olysio were approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in December 2013, recently captured news headlines with the high cost of treatment. With the highest prevalence of HCV in the world, Egypt is expected to be hit hardest by its cost. Given the nature of the hepatitis C epidemic in Africa, international health organizations would welcome an HCV treatment with a 90 percent success rate, but its high cost is certain to limit its effectiveness.\n\n[Byline: Steve Killings]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[For more information on the Hepatitis C outbreak related to the mass treatment program against schistosomiasis, see the prior ProMED-mail posts referenced below. In a 2013 review of Hepatitic C (HCV), Karoney and Silka did a review of the current available literature on HCV in Africa -- and found a paucity of information. Their abstract states: '.....Africa has the highest WHO estimated regional HCV prevalence (5.3 percent). Egypt has the highest prevalence (17.5 percent) of HCV in the world. Genotypes commonly found in Africa are 1, 4 and 5. Genotype 3 is found in Egypt and parts of Central Africa. Blood transfusion is a major means of acquisition of HCV infection. While treatment with peginterferon and ribavirin is recommended for patients with chronic HCV, no data were found on their use in Africa. Neither were there any data on definitive management (liver transplantation) for those with end stage disease. Data on HCV infection in Africa are scarce. This suggests that hepatitis C is still a neglected disease in many countries. Limited data exist in literature on HCV in Africa.' (Karoney MJ, Siika AM. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in Africa: a review.\nThe Pan African Medical Journal. 2013;14:44, available at http://www.panafrican-med-journal.com/content/article/14/44/full/).\n\nFor those who are interested, an excellent review of the epidemiology of HCV in the Eastern Mediterranean region countries of WHO can be found in a 2009 Technical paper -- 'The growing threats of hepatitis B and C in the Eastern Mediterranean Region: a call for action' available at http://applications.emro.who.int/docs/EM_RC56_3_en.pdf?ua=1. The paper mentions the high prevalence in Egypt related to the schistosomiasis treatment campaigns that were conducted from the 1930s to the late 1970s, associated with the use of injectables with unsafe injection techniques. Further epidemiologic studies demonstrated a high prevalence of HCV in children born after the campaigns suggesting continued transmission through unsafe injection techniques. The data available in the region suggests that the majority of HCV transmission in the EMRO region does occur in the health care setting associated with unsafe injection techniques. A map showing the prevalence of HCV by country in the region can be found on page 6 of the position paper. - Mod.MPP]\n\n[The following are extracted from the summary of the April 2014 WHO recommendations regarding hepatitis C (http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs164/en/):\n\nTreatment\n---------\nHepatitis C does not always require treatment as the immune response in some people will clear the infection. When treatment is necessary, the goal of hepatitis C treatment is cure. The cure rate depends on several factors including the strain of the virus and the type of treatment given. Careful screening is necessary before starting the treatment to determine the most appropriate approach for the patient.\n\nThe current standard treatment for hepatitis C is combination antiviral therapy with interferon and ribavirin, which are effective against all the genotypes of hepatitis viruses (pan-genotypic). Unfortunately, interferon is not widely available globally and it is poorly tolerated in some patients. This means that management of the treatment is complex, and many patients do not finish their treatment. Despite these limitations, interferon and ribavirin treatment can be life-saving.\n\nScientific advances have led to the development of new antiviral drugs for hepatitis C, which are much more effective, safer, and better-tolerated than existing therapies. These therapies, known as oral directly acting antiviral agent (DAAs) therapies simplify hepatitis C treatment by significantly decreasing monitoring requirements and by increasing cure rates. Although the production cost of DAAs is low, the initial prices set by companies are very high and likely to make access to these drugs difficult even in high-income countries.\n\nMuch needs to be done to ensure that these advances lead to greater access to treatment globally.\n\nWHO response\n------------\nWHO is working in the following areas to prevent and control viral hepatitis:\n- raising awareness, promoting partnerships and mobilizing resources;\n- formulating evidence-based policy and data for action;\n- preventing transmission; and\n- executing screening, care, and treatment.\n\nWHO also organizes World Hepatitis Day on 28 July every year to increase awareness and understanding of viral hepatitis.\n\nPrevention\n----------\nPrimary prevention\n------------------\nThere is no vaccine for hepatitis C, therefore prevention of HCV infection depends upon reducing the risk of exposure to the virus in healthcare settings, in higher risk populations, for example, people who inject drugs, and through sexual contact.\n\nThe following list provides a limited example of primary prevention interventions recommended by WHO:\n- hand hygiene: including surgical hand preparation, hand washing, and use of gloves;\n- safe handling and disposal of sharps and waste;\n- safe cleaning of equipment;\n- testing of donated blood;\n- improved access to safe blood; and\n- training of health personnel.\n\nSecondary and tertiary prevention\n---------------------------------\nFor people infected with the hepatitis C virus, WHO recommends:\n- education and counselling on options for care and treatment;\n- immunization with the hepatitis A and B vaccines to prevent coinfection from these hepatitis viruses to protect their liver;\nearly and appropriate medical management including antiviral therapy if appropriate; and\n- regular monitoring for early diagnosis of chronic liver disease.\nScreening, care and treatment of persons with hepatitis C infection\n\nWHO is launching new guidelines for the screening, care, and treatment of persons with hepatitis C infection in April 2014.\n\nThese are the 1st guidelines dealing with hepatitis C treatment produced by WHO and complement existing guidance on the prevention of transmission of bloodborne viruses, including HCV.\n\nThey are intended for policy-makers, government officials, and others working in low- and middle-income countries who are developing programmes for the screening, care, and treatment of persons with HCV infection. These guidelines will help expand of treatment services to patients with HCV infection, as they provide key recommendations in these areas and discuss considerations for implementation.\n\nSummary of key recommendations\n------------------------------\nRecommendations on screening for HCV infection\n----------------------------------------------\n1. Screening to identify persons with HCV infection\nIt is recommended that HCV serology testing be offered to individuals who are part of a population with high HCV prevalence or who have a history of HCV risk exposure/behaviour (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence).\n\n2. When to confirm the diagnosis of chronic HCV infection\nIt is suggested that nucleic acid testing (NAT) for the detection of HCV ribonucleic acid (RNA) be performed directly following a positive HCV serological test to establish the diagnosis of chronic HCV infection, in addition to NAT for HCV RNA as part of the assessment for starting treatment for HCV infection (conditional recommendation, very low quality of evidence).\n\nRecommendations on care of people infected with HCV\n---------------------------------------------------\n3. Screening for alcohol use and counselling to reduce moderate and high levels of alcohol intake\nAn alcohol intake assessment is recommended for all persons with HCV infection followed by the offer of a behavioural alcohol reduction intervention for persons with moderate-to-high alcohol intake (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence).\n\n4. Assessing degree of liver fibrosis and cirrhosis\nIn resource-limited settings, it is suggested that the aminotransferase/platelet ratio index (APRI) or FIB4 tests be used for the assessment of hepatic fibrosis rather than other non-invasive tests that require more resources such as elastography or Fibrotest (conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence).\n\nRecommendations on treatment of HCV infection\n---------------------------------------------\n5. Assessing for HCV treatment\nAll adults and children with chronic HCV infection, including people who inject drugs, should be assessed for antiviral treatment (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence).\n\n6. Treatment with pegylated interferon and ribavirin\nPegylated interferon in combination with ribavirin is recommended for the treatment of chronic HCV infection rather than standard non-pegylated interferon with ribavirin. (Strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence).\n\n7. Treatment with telaprevir or boceprevir [Incivek and Victrelis, protease inhibitors]\nTreatment with the direct-acting antivirals telaprevir or boceprevir, given in combination with pegylated interferon and ribavirin, is suggested for genotype 1 chronic HCV infection rather than pegylated interferon and ribavirin alone (conditional recommendation, moderate quality of evidence).\n\n8. Treatment with sofosbuvir [Solvaldi, RNA polymerase inhibitor]\nSofosbuvir, given in combination with ribavirin with or without pegylated interferon (depending on the HCV genotype), is recommended in genotypes 1, 2, 3 and 4 HCV infection rather than pegylated interferon and ribavirin alone, or no treatment for persons who cannot tolerate interferon (strong recommendation, high quality of evidence).\n\n9. Treatment with simeprevir [Olysio, protease inhibitor]\nSimeprevir, given in combination with pegylated interferon and ribavirin, is recommended for persons with genotype 1b HCV infection and for persons with genotype 1a HCV infection without the Q80K polymorphism rather than pegylated interferon and ribavirin alone (strong recommendation, high quality of evidence).\n\nNote: Recommendations 8 and 9 were made without taking resource use into consideration, as pricing information was not available for any country other than the United States at the time this recommendation was formulated.\n- Mod.LL]", "summary": "\n\nThe following list provides a limited example of primary prevention interventions recommended by WHO:\n- hand hygiene: including surgical hand preparation, hand washing, and use of gloves;\n- safe handling and disposal of sharps and waste;\n- safe cleaning of equipment;\n- testing of donated blood;\n- improved access to safe blood; and\n- training of health personnel.

Cape public health officials say they are doing a good job of tracking the disease, but they also tied rising infection rates to another epidemic, that of opiate addiction.\n\nAbout 15 to 20 Cape Cod Healthcare patients have been prescribed Sovaldi [generic name sofosbuvir, a drug used for hepatitis C infection, with a high cure rate. It inhibits the RNA polymerase that the hepatitis C virus uses to replicate its RNA. - Mod.LL], the new hepatitis C drug that comes with fewer side effects but a hefty price tag, said Valerie Al-Hachem, manager of the health care organization's infectious disease clinical services. She said Sovaldi costs USD 1000 a pill, USD 93 000 for a course of treatment.\n\n'Part of it [the increase in HCV recognition] is better surveillance. We're becoming much more diligent in reporting new infections,' said Max Sandusky, director of prevention and screening services for the AIDS Support Group of Cape Cod. 'But part of it is concentrated areas of infection. It's spreading. Once it gets into the population, it's spreading.'\n\nIn 2012, the last year for which the state has figures, the hepatitis C rate for 15- to 25-year-olds in Barnstable County was 344.3 cases per 100 000 population -- far higher than the next highest county, Plymouth, which had 194.57 cases per 100 000 population. 'The hepatitis C epidemic is going to far exceed what we saw with HIV,' Sandusky said. 'It is a public health time bomb.'\n\nThe 2012 infection rate for 15- to 25-year-olds is the highest it has ever been in Barnstable County. The incidence rate per 100 000 people in that population was 298.05 in 2011 and 154.16 in 2010, or 58 and 30 people. In 2012, reported confirmed cases among 15- to 25-year-olds in Barnstable County numbered 67.\n\nA 2013 report by the Center for Health Law and Policy Innovation of Harvard Law School and the Treatment Access Expansion Project shows particularly high rates of hepatitis C infection among teens and young adults in Falmouth, which Sandusky attributes in part to the Upper Cape presence of treatment centers and halfway houses. A lot of injection drug users stay in the community after they leave treatment, Sandusky said. 'It's a recovery destination,' said Nate Robertson of Mashpee, who with Sam Tarplin of Falmouth is making a documentary about the opiate epidemic called 'What Happened Here: The Untold Story of Addiction on Cape Cod.' Many people who are treated on the Upper Cape 'stay around,' he said. 'Not everybody stays clean.'\n\nAs recently as 2002 the spike in confirmed chronic hepatitis C rates was among middle-aged people. A state DPH report shows that year the age group with the most cases was people aged 45. By 2012, the age with the highest caseload -- about 700 -- was 25-year-olds.\n\nStatewide there were 5223 cases of confirmed chronic hepatitis C in 2012, a decrease from 5881 in 2011. On Cape Cod there were 245 cases in 2012 and 234 in 2011 among all age groups. The DPH has developed a 'point of care' document to capture new cases of hepatitis C, Sandusky said. He said the form is completed by the diagnostic organization and includes demographic information on the person who contracted hepatitis C, along with medical history and the type of test used. The result is state officials are missing fewer cases, Sandusky said.\n\n'Screening is better,' said Valerie Al-Hachem, manager of infectious disease clinical services at Cape Cod Healthcare. 'But the injection practices are more prevalent here on the Cape.'\n\nDespite awareness campaigns, 'there's still a lot of shared needles going on,' said Robertson, who is a recovering heroin addict. He said people who are using drugs aren't thinking about taking care of their health. Drug users typically delay getting tested for the liver-damaging disease until they are in recovery or in jail, Robertson said.\n\nSandusky said his organization started a pilot project to do rapid testing of high-risk people in August [2013]. A finger prick test tells within 20 minutes whether a person has developed antibodies to hepatitis C, showing that they were infected at some point, Sandusky said.\n\nThe rapid testing is being done at the Barnstable County Correctional Facility and among high-risk people in the general population, Sandusky added.\n\nBetween 28 Aug 2013 and 31 Mar 2014, the AIDS Support Group of Cape Cod tested 102 people, 70 of whom identified themselves as injection drug users, he said. Of those getting the finger prick, 25 -- or 24 percent -- tested positive, Sandusky said. He said that is a very high infection rate. 'Most of the folks we have tested are under the age of 30,' Sandusky said. 'We are definitely focusing on the younger population because we are seeing increases in substance abuse among youth.'\n\n[Byline: Cynthia McCormick]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Without longitudinal studies of a cohort, it is not clear over what period of time the HCV infections were acquired as, in most individuals, chronic infection develops.

The treatment regimens for HCV can also diminish transmission by clearing the viremia and we are about the enter a time with therapy without interferon and even ribavirin, both of which have therapy-limiting side effects and have disappointing results with certain genotypes of the virus. - Mod.LL\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/17741.]", "summary": "In 2012, the last year for which the state has figures, the hepatitis C rate for 15- to 25-year-olds in Barnstable County was 344.3 cases per 100 000 population -- far higher than the next highest county, Plymouth, which had 194.57 cases per 100 000 population.

Normal treatment is transfusion of factor VIII concentrate, which is produced from pools of thousands of plasma donations, purified, and virus inactivated.\n\nOne liter of fresh frozen plasma raises factor VIII in the recipient by about 20 percentage points. Treatment is limited by the enormous volumes of plasma needed to prevent bleeding. This is why treatment should be, in these cases, by cryoprecipitate (single donor, much lower volume).\n\nDonor plasma (for fresh frozen plasma or cryoprecipitate) may be tested for antibodies against hepatitis C virus (anti-HCV). However, plasma concentration of HCV is highest in fresh infections when anti-HCV is still negative. Fresh infections are, for different reasons, much more frequent in commercial blood donors as opposed to voluntary non-remunerated donors. To my knowledge, the Indian blood transfusion system relies heavily on commercial donors. As a result, infection can even be transmitted when testing was correct.\n\nThe risk stemming from fresh HCV infection of the donor can be further reduced when donations are, in addition to HCV antibody testing, screened for HCV genomes by RT PCR. This is so expensive that even in Germany, donations are tested in pools, and probably unaffordable for most of India. Even then, infection cannot be completely prevented because the volume transfused is much greater than the volume tested by PCR and may still contain a few viruses not detected by the test.\n\nIn resource-poor countries, antibody-testing is frequently done in pools of, for example, 5 donations, but then the sensitivity of the test is reduced, or antibody testing is not done at all.\n\nIt would be interesting to know what the actual problem in Kashmir was.\n\n--\nDr. Gregor Caspari\nFacharzt fur Transfusionsmedizin\nBerlin, Germany\n<g.caspari@ladr.de>\n\n[ProMED thanks Dr. Caspari for his comments. - Mod.LL\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/142.]", "summary": "\n\n--\nDr. Gregor Caspari\nFacharzt fur Transfusionsmedizin\nBerlin, Germany\n<g.caspari@ladr.de>\n\n[ProMED thanks Dr. Caspari for his comments.

Manipur's Surachanpur and Bishnupur districts have the highest number of people carrying the hepatitis C virus (HCV), with prevalence rates among the districts' IDUs being nearly 90 percent and 78 percent respectively.\n\nIn Nagaland's Wokha and Phek districts, the prevalence rate, as per an Integrated Bio Behavioural Assessment Round 2 Testing, conducted in 2009 by the Indian Council of Medical Research and others, was 20.8 percent and 8.7 percent respectively. Prior studies showed that in Manipur, the prevalence rate of HCV is 55 to 80 percent among IDUs, as opposed to 22 to 33 percent HIV prevalence among them.\n\n'The main objective is to create awareness about viral hepatitis in the region. The epidemic is at our doorstep, with people getting infected, testing positive and some deaths being reported. However, NGOs and the government continue to ignore the spread of the disease,' said Ketho, general secretary of Hepatitis Coalition of Nagaland (HEPCON).\n\nWith much of the focus being restricted to HIV-AIDS and cancer awareness, HCV often escapes attention. With no proper cure or vaccine, course-related HCV treatment is also considered too expensive. People with HCV are prone to develop chronicity that can lead to liver damages. Research show that close to 75 to 85 percent HCV patients develop chronicity, as opposed to hepatitis B patients (HBV) [which is about 5 percent. - Mod.LL]\n\n'Intravenous drug users are the most vulnerable. HCV prevalence is much higher than that of HIV. This indicates that there is a bigger pool of HCV patients among IDUs,' said Gajendra Kumar Medhi, doctor and scientist with the Indian Council of Medical Research.\n\nAnother factor responsible for the high prevalence of HCV amongst IDUs is needle-sharing. Even with efforts to promote safe injecting practices, the prevalence of needle-sharing is quite high. Users may lessen sharing of syringes, but indirect sharing is widely practiced. Nearly 50 to 70 percent IDUs admitted to sharing accessories like common containers for drug preparation, filter cotton and rinse water.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[As yet, there is no available vaccine for the hepatitis C virus so prevention of transmission of the disease needs to be aimed at high risk groups such as intravenous drug users who share their 'works'.

In that report, the mode of virus transmission was unclear. The following comment offers an indication of the probable common means of transmission. Mod.TY]\n\nThe most frequent reason for hepatitis C virus transmission in resource-poor countries is indeed reuse of needles for injection. During my time in Dakar/Senegal in the 1980s, needles were cooked for 3 minutes before reuse, but colleagues from other countries told me injection needles were simply flushed with water before reuse. Another important source is blood transfusion, again with reuse of equipment and 'commercial' blood donors, where one infected donor may infect dozens of blood recipients.\n\nInterferon therapy is not suitable and not licensed for end-stage liver disease. A very important side effect is depression, which may lead to interruption of therapy or even suicide. It requires regular injections which in turn require sterile equipment and possibly a cold chain (freezer for transport and storage). Ribavirin treatment at least requires exclusion of pregnancy and regular control of hemoglobin concentration. Treatment with newer protease inhibitors is far more complex and requires more sophisticated laboratory control.\n\nThe most important step might be to identify asymptomatic patients. In these patients, treatment might make sense if resources for treatment are available. These patients should avoid all additional liver damage (above all, alcohol) and be vaccinated against all hepatotropic infections if not already having been infected in the past.\n\n--\nDr G Caspari\nPriv.-Doz.

Officials fear the spread of hepatitis C, a disease that can destroy one's liver, is being exacerbated by the sharing of needles.\n\n'Certainly, hepatitis C is transmitted through injection drug use, so people who inject drugs are at high risk of getting hepatitis C,' Minnesota Department of Health epidemiologist Kristin Sweet tells MPR. 'If we see increases in injection drug use, it makes sense that we'd see hepatitis C as well.' The CDC says the most common way that hepatitis C virus is spread is 'sharing needles or other equipment to inject drugs.'\n\nSweet tells MPR that 32 Minnesotans were diagnosed with hepatitis C in 2012; but the actual number of people who contract the disease is more because many people do not develop symptoms and as a result, don't get tested. In May 2013, the department estimated about 39 000 people were living with the disease statewide, [KSTP-TV] said.\n\nAdvocates tell MPR that needle exchange programs, which provide new syringes to users and destroy old ones are effective in stopping the spread of HIV and hepatitis C, but there's a stigma that it also encourages drug use. That stigma in turn makes it difficult to obtain funding for such programs.\n\nMPR says only 3 stand alone needle exchanges operate in the state.\n\nMeanwhile, counties in the metro area are trying to get a handle on the rising number of heroin-related deaths. In February 2014, Hennepin County Sheriff Rich Stanek said 54 people died of heroin overdose in the county in 2013, making it the deadliest year yet for such deaths in the county. Stanek said the number was 7 times higher than just 3 years prior, when 8 people died from heroin overdoses.\n\nIn addition, Anoka County officials held 3 community forums in January and February 2014 to address the escalating problem of heroin use. Anoka County law enforcement officials say the number of deaths due to heroin overdoses in the county has tripled in the last 2 years.\n\nAccording to KSTP, USA Senator Amy Klobuchar was at the 17 Feb 2014 forum to talk about her strategy to urge the Drug Enforcement Agency to focus on the jump in heroin use.\n\n[Byline: Tim Lammers]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Neither the statement that a needle exchange program (NEP) encourages increased drug use among program participants or the recruitment of 1st-time drug users, nor the parallel statement that the availability of the 'morning after' pill encourages increased sexual contact are at all true.\n\nThe following reference is presented in support of NEPs:\n'Vlahov D, Junge B: The role of needle exchange programs in HIV prevention. Public Health Rep. Jun 1998; 113(Suppl 1): 75-80; http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/4598276?uid=3737760&uid=2129&uid=2&uid=70&uid=4&sid=21103674531683\n\nAbstract\n--------\nInjecting drug users (IDUs) are at high risk for infection by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and other blood-borne pathogens. In the United States, IDUs account for nearly one-third of the cases of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), either directly or indirectly (heterosexual and perinatal cases of AIDS where the source of infection was an IDU). IDU also account for a substantial proportion of cases of hepatitis B (HBV) and hepatitis C (HCV) virus infections.\n\nThe primary mode of transmission of HIV among IDUs is parenteral, through direct needle sharing or multiperson use of syringes. Despite high levels of knowledge about risk, multiperson use of needles and syringes is due primarily to fear of arrest and incarceration for violation of drug paraphernalia laws and ordinances that prohibit manufacture, sale, distribution, or possession of equipment and materials intended to be used with narcotics.\n\nIt is estimated that in 1997 there were approximately 110 needle exchange programs (NEPs) in North America. In part, because of the ban on the use of Federal funds for the operation of needle exchange, it has been difficult to evaluate the efficacy of these programs.\n\nThis chapter presents data from the studies that have evaluated the role of NEPs in HIV prevention. Evidence for the efficacy of NEPs comes from three source: (1) studies originally focused on the effectiveness of NEPs in non-HIV blood-borne infections, (2) mathematical modeling of data on needle exchange on HIV seroincidence, and (3) studies that examine the positive and negative impact of NEPs on HIV and AIDS. Case-control studies have provided powerful data on the positive effect of NEPs on reduction of 2 blood-borne viral infections (HBV and HCV). For example, a case-control study in Tacoma, Washington, showed that a 6-fold increase in HBV and a 7-fold increase in HCV infections in IDUs were associated with nonuse of the NEP. The 1st federally funded study of needle exchange was an evaluation of the New Haven NEP, which is legally operated by the New Haven Health Department. Rather than relying on self-report of reduced risky injection drug use, this study utilized mathematical and statistical modeling, using data from a syringe tracking and testing system. Incidence of HIV infection among needle exchange participants was estimated to have decreased by 33 percent as a result of the NEP.\n\nA series of Government-commissioned reports have reviewed the data on positive and negative outcomes of NEPs. The major reports are from the National Commission on AIDS; the US General Accounting Office; the Centers for Disease Control/University of California; and the National Academy of Sciences. The latter 2 reports are used in this chapter. The aggregated results support the positive benefit of NEPs and do not support negative outcomes from NEPs. When legal restrictions on both purchase and possession of syringes are removed, IDUs will change their syringe-sharing behaviors in ways that can reduce HIV transmission. NEPs do not result in increased drug use among participants or the recruitment of first-time drug users.'\n\nThe increase in reported cases of hepatitis C in IVDU (intravenous drug users) more recently can also reflect increased screening of individuals for the infection due to increased awareness of physicians and more advertising by big pharma. Furthermore, increased overdose deaths can be in part caused by changes in the content of the injected substances. Despite these statements, the aggressive use of NEPs will decrease the spread of blood borne pathogens and, until the availability of an effective HCV vaccine, is the best approach to decrease HCV transmission. - Mod.LL\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/r/3eo9.]", "summary": "Communicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Neither the statement that a needle exchange program (NEP) encourages increased drug use among program participants or the recruitment of 1st-time drug users, nor the parallel statement that the availability of the 'morning after' pill encourages increased sexual contact are at all true. \n\nAdvocates tell MPR that needle exchange programs, which provide new syringes to users and destroy old ones are effective in stopping the spread of HIV and hepatitis C, but there's a stigma that it also encourages drug use. \n\n'Certainly, hepatitis C is transmitted through injection drug use, so people who inject drugs are at high risk of getting hepatitis C,' Minnesota Department of Health epidemiologist Kristin Sweet tells MPR.

Evidence for the efficacy of NEPs comes from three source: (1) studies originally focused on the effectiveness of NEPs in non-HIV blood-borne infections, (2) mathematical modeling of data on needle exchange on HIV seroincidence, and (3) studies that examine the positive and negative impact of NEPs on HIV and AIDS. \n\nThe following reference is presented in support of NEPs:\n'Vlahov D, Junge B: The role of needle exchange programs in HIV prevention. \n\nSweet tells MPR that 32 Minnesotans were diagnosed with hepatitis C in 2012; but the actual number of people who contract the disease is more because many people do not develop symptoms and as a result, don't get tested. Despite high levels of knowledge about risk, multiperson use of needles and syringes is due primarily to fear of arrest and incarceration for violation of drug paraphernalia laws and ordinances that prohibit manufacture, sale, distribution, or possession of equipment and materials intended to be used with narcotics. \n\nThe primary mode of transmission of HIV among IDUs is parenteral, through direct needle sharing or multiperson use of syringes. NEPs do not result in increased drug use among participants or the recruitment of first-time drug users.' Rather than relying on self-report of reduced risky injection drug use, this study utilized mathematical and statistical modeling, using data from a syringe tracking and testing system. \n\nIt is estimated that in 1997 there were approximately 110 needle exchange programs (NEPs) in North America. In February 2014, Hennepin County Sheriff Rich Stanek said 54 people died of heroin overdose in the county in 2013, making it the deadliest year yet for such deaths in the county.

The content of the ProMED-mail post entitled 'Hepatitis B & C - Australia: increasing incidence' archive number 20131110.2048183 was largely concerned with estimations of the number of people with viral hepatitis who remain undiagnosed and, perhaps, the rising incidence of deaths from primary liver cancer, to which viral hepatitis is a major contributor. As far as I can see, however, the HIV, viral hepatitis, and sexually transmissible infections in Australia Annual Surveillance Report 2013 does not really indicate increasing incidence of hepatitis B and C. The following are excerpted from the report summary (p. 7):\n\n- The per capita rate of diagnosis of hepatitis B infection in Australia in 2008 to 2012 was stable at around 31 per 100 000 population. The rate of diagnosis of newly acquired hepatitis B infection steadily declined in Australia from 1.2 in 2008 to 0.8 per 100 000 population in 2012.\n\n- The per capita rate of diagnosis of hepatitis C infection declined from 52.5 in 2008 to 44.2 per 100 000 population in 2012.\n\nOne increasing statistic related to the number of newly acquired hepatitis C notifications is this:\n\n- The reported annual number of diagnoses of newly acquired hepatitis C infection increased from 365 to 466 in 2008 to 2012 and accounted for 4.6 percent of new hepatitis C diagnoses in 2012.\n\nThis statistic may vary, however, according to the level of scrutiny applied to new notifications to identify newly acquired cases. And unlike HIV, we don't have the number of specimens tested for viral hepatitis, to give an indication of how testing rates might be affecting diagnosis rates. Then, to counter the interpretation that the increase in newly acquired cases identified indicates rising incidence of transmission:\n\nThe proportion of people seen at needle and syringe programs [NSPs] who reported having injected drugs for 5 years or less was stable in 2008 to 2012 at around 10 percent. Within this group, hepatitis C prevalence declined from 28 percent in 2008 to 17 percent in 2012.\n\nGiven the strong association of viral hepatitis transmission with injecting drug use, I would also draw attention to the attached article by Iversen et al. 2013 (Reduction in HCV incidence among injection drug users attending needle and syringe programs in Australia: a linkage study) published in the American Journal of Public Health [Am J Public Health. 2013 Aug; 103(8): 1436-44. doi: 10.2105/AJPH.2012.301206.

At least 10 patients have died in the past 2 months because of hepatitis C in these villages while few others are battling for life in various Kashmir hospitals, reports said.\n\nThe lives of hundreds of patients in Takia Magam, Sonabarie, and some adjacent villages [in Anantnag district] are at risk, with governments failing to provide them any medicine or monetary assistance.\n\nThe hepatitis C was detected in Takia Magam and Sonabarie villages and some adjacent areas in February last year [2013]. After the collection of samples, almost 60 per cent of the population from the twin villages was diagnosed with hepatitis C. Some isolated cases were detected in other villages of Kokernag as well.\n\nThe state government later sent a proposal to the Centre for providing costly medicine to the patients. The proposal, however, has not been approved even as health experts declared a large-scale epidemic in the area. They also warned of further spread of the infection in case precautionary measures were not taken.\n\nA man, 48, of Magam village -- who was diagnosed with hepatitis C last year [2013] -- died in November after he was admitted to SK Institute of Medical Sciences [SKIMS, in Nohata, Srinagar, Jammu and Kashmir]. 'The doctors at SKIMS told us that he was suffering from hepatitis C infection from many years,' said his family members. They said due to their poor financial condition, they could not afford to treat him outside.\n\nAnother man, 55, of the same village reportedly died last month [December 2013] after he was battling for his life at a hospital. 'He was complaining of severe abdominal pain for 8 months and after conducting investigations doctors found his liver completely damaged,' said his family members.\n\nReports said many other people from the same village, who were infected with hepatitis C, lost their lives this month [January 2014]. These include a man, 65; and another man, 50. Among the dead was also a 35 year old married woman. Another middle-aged man from adjacent Drawai village, according to reports, was taken to PGI [Post Graduate Institute] Chandigarh following his deteriorating health condition at SKIMS and his liver was found to be completely damaged.\n\nMany other patients from Takia Magam, Sonabarie, and some other villages, according to reports, are undergoing treatment at various hospitals in Kashmir and the condition of few of them is slated to be critical.\n\n'A woman is undergoing treatment at SMHS hospital [in Srinagar] for the past one week,' sources said. Her family members say doctors have termed her condition as 'critical'. Another woman, 45, is battling for her life in the hospital even as her husband and 3 children have also been diagnosed with hepatitis C.\n\n'There is grave fear in Magam and Sonabarie villages as a result of outbreak of the disease and the consequent deaths,' says a villager. He said hepatitis C patients are now directly referred to SKIMS or SMHS from district hospital Anantnag (Islamabad).\n\n'Last year [2013] when media reported the infection, ministers and health department officials made beelines to the affected areas and promised free treatment. But now patients have been left at the mercy of God. Nobody is coming forward to help them,' he rued.\n\nAnother resident said since many villagers are not financially sound, they are unable to get themselves treated or even examined. 'Few families have sold their land for treatment of their patients,' he said.\n\nNoted gastroenterologist Dr MS Khuroo had declared the infection as epidemic. He had warned that if the authorities did not wake up, the situation could worsen in years to come.\n\nHealth experts had also declared the infection as decades old transmitted by some specific source. 'The mode of transmission is same as HIV [unlike HIV, hepatitis C virus is rarely transmitted sexually. - Mod.TY] and as such, besides necessary treatment of the already infected, educating and creating awareness among the people is equally important to prevent the further spread of this silent disease,' said a medico, wishing anonymity.\n\nDirector of Health Services Kashmir, Dr Saleem-U-Rehman, said, 'Till now we have not received any assistance from the Union Health Ministry for the treatment of the hepatitis C patients.' However, official sources said the proposal of the state government was rejected by the centre. 'The central government does not have any specific program for the treatment of the disease which is prevalent in Punjab and Haryana too. Also, it will need crores [1 crore = 10 million] of rupees for treatment of the affected people. So the central government has been reluctant to approve the proposal,' said an official.\n\nDirector of SKIMS Dr Showkat Zargar also said they have not received any assistance from the Union Health Ministry for treatment of the affected villagers.\n\nHowever, about the reports of deaths, Dr Zargar said, 'Deaths can occur in advanced stage [of disease] only. The infection is decades old, may be even 30 years. So the infection might have lead to some deaths.' He, however, said attributing every death to the infection cannot be right as the infection is not fatal in initial stages, which may go even up to 20 years.\n\n[byline: Khalid Gul]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Hepatitis C virus infections are not uncommon in India. High incidence of hepatitis C was reported in Kalala village, Barnala district, Punjab state, in July 2013.\n\nMod.CP provided an excellent summary of hepatitis C and its virus (see ProMED-mail archive no 20130724.1843447): 'Hepatitis C is found worldwide, with some countries having chronic infection rates as high as 5 per cent and above. The main mode of transmission in these countries is attributed to unsafe injections using contaminated equipment. Hepatitis C is not a waterborne infection as believed by the Kalala villagers. Hepatitis C virus is most commonly transmitted through exposure to infectious blood. This can occur through receipt of contaminated blood transfusions, blood products, and organ transplants; injections given with contaminated syringes and needlestick injuries in health care settings; injection drug use; or by being born to a hepatitis C infected mother. Hepatitis C may be transmitted through sex with an infected person or sharing personal items contaminated with infectious blood, but these are less common. Hepatitis C is not spread through breast milk, food, or water, or by casual contact with an infected person.\n\nAbout 75-85 per cent of newly infected persons develop chronic infection and 60-70 per cent of chronically infected people develop chronic liver disease; 5-20 per cent develop cirrhosis and 1-5 per cent die from cirrhosis or liver cancer. In 25 per cent of liver cancer patients, the underlying cause is hepatitis C.\n\nCombination antiviral therapy with interferon and ribavirin has been the mainstay of hepatitis C treatment. Unfortunately, interferon is not widely available globally, it is not always well tolerated, some virus genotypes respond better to interferon than others, and many people who take interferon do not finish their treatment. This means that while hepatitis C is generally considered to be a curable disease, for many people this is not a reality.\n\nScientific advances have led to the development of new antiviral drugs for hepatitis C, which may be more effective and better tolerated than existing therapies (involving combined use of interferon and ribavirin).

It was then that he discovered he had been infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV), which can cause liver disease and eventually hepatocellular carcinoma -- better known as liver cancer.\n\nThe bank consequently withdrew its offer, and the man fell victim to the social stigma associated with hepatitis C and other chronic diseases. In fact, Egypt has the highest prevalence of HCV in the world, with 10-14 per cent (8 to 10 million people) infected with HCV, and about 1.5 million in need of treatment. Gamal Esmat, professor of liver disease at Cairo [University], notes that the vast majority of these are in the Nile Delta region. HCV's high prevalence in Egypt is in part due to a mass state campaign in the 1960s and 1970s to treat schistosomiasis using improperly sterilized glass syringes and needles.\n\nBut a new treatment for HCV could radically change the situation. In collaboration with the Ministry of Health and other global organizations, the National Hepatology and Tropical Medicine Research Institute (NHTMRI) plans to introduce a new HCV treatment in 2014. Unlike previous treatments -- antiviral drugs that treat HCV by boosting the immune system -- the new treatment cures the virus within 12 weeks at a 97 per cent effectiveness rate and with no side effects. Known as 'direct acting antiviral agents', the new HCV treatment combats the disease by targeting the infected liver cells and destroying the virus' replication machinery.\n\nAbou el-Resh Pediatric University Hospital, Cairo (Ashashyou), Raymond Schinazi, an American research scientist of Italian-Egyptian descent at Atlanta's Emory University, was the founder of Pharmasset Inc, the company that originally developed the drug. Schinazi's team of researchers worked for over 6 years, finding what they consider to be the cure: the PSI-7977 molecule, now named 'sofosbuvir', which the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved on 8 Dec [2013].\n\nThe 'silent epidemic'\n---------------------\nBorn and raised in Alexandria, Schinazi and his family left Egypt during the large-scale Jewish exodus that took place in the 1950s and 1960s. Schinazi says he still has a close relationship with Egypt and hopes his collaborative research will eventually help cure those infected in his country of birth. 'When I 1st heard of HCV, I thought to myself: This is my next target,' he says. 'My dream was to one day find a cure for it and help my mother country,' says Schinazi, who sold his company and the drug patent to US company Gilead Sciences for USD 11.4 billion.\n\nThere are currently over 6 drug companies competing for the production of an HCV cure. But unlike the other drugs in the market, sofosbuvir is also pan-genotypic, which means that it can be used to treat infected people with all [known HCV] genotypes worldwide -- including genotype 4, which is most common in Egypt.\n\nDubbed the 'silent epidemic', hepatitis C has infected about 170 million people worldwide and has caused about 350 000 deaths per year from HCV-related diseases. 'Our aim is to provide a treatment for HCV which is safe, effective and with minimal side effects,' says Manal al-Sayed, professor of pediatrics at Ain Shams University and a member of the National Committee for the Control of Viral Hepatitis. 'Our challenge will be to have it at affordable prices for all,' she adds. With prospects of the cure costing as much as USD 100 000 in the US, many are concerned it would be unaffordable for most Egyptians. Egyptian authorities, doctors, Ministry of Health members and others are currently negotiating with major pharmaceutical companies producing this and other treatments to reduce costs. Nevertheless, Egyptian authorities and doctors remain hopeful of bringing HCV treatment to Egypt at 5 per cent of the global price, with the rest subsidised by government authorities.\n\n[byline: Leyla Doss]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Hepatitis C is bloodborne, and symptoms are often not visible until 20 years after infection. It can range in severity from a mild illness lasting for a few weeks to a serious, lifelong condition that can lead to cirrhosis of the liver or liver cancer -- despite treatment and the likelihood of a total cure looking promising in the near future. Therefore more attention must be focused on preventing the infection process of hepatitis C virus infection.\n\nAccording to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), almost 20 per cent of the Health Ministry's budget has been allocated to care and treatment and just a 1 per cent expenditure on infection control. In Egypt, there are approximately 165 000 new cases of infection each year, and 70 per cent of them are related to inefficiencies of the health care system. For example, equipment is often not sterilized according to acceptable standards, and infection is very often transmitted through improperly screened blood transfusions of infected patients. Other modes of infection include the sharing of unsterilized needles and unsterilized tools for pedicures, manicures and tattoos. However over the past 6 years, there have also been extensive campaigns to raise awareness about hepatitis C virus infection.

[1,2].\n\nIncidence and prevalence\n------------------------\nHepatitis C is the commonest cause of chronic liver disease in Egypt. The nationwide carriage rate in 1997 was estimated at 6 to 8 million, or 18.1 per cent of the population -- the highest rate in the world. A study published in 2010 estimated the yearly rate at 500 000 new cases (0.7 per cent of the population); while a study published in 2013 estimated the yearly rate at fewer than 150 000 cases. An analysis published in 2009 predicted that 127 821 deaths from chronic liver disease and 117 556 deaths from hepatocellular carcinoma would occur in Egypt over the next 20 years.\n\nThe high rate of hepatitis C infection in Egypt is largely attributed to previous mass-injection (antimony tartrate) treatment campaigns for schistosomiasis, which involved repeated use [of] non-sterilized needles. 84 per cent of patients who had received intravenous schistosomiasis therapy during the 1980s were found to be HCV-positive; and anti-_Schistosoma_ antibodies were found in 29 per cent of patients with chronic hepatitis C infection (2013 publication). There is also evidence for ongoing transmission of hepatitis C from parents to children co-infection by other hepatotropic viruses is common. 72.0 per cent of children with hepatitis C are seropositive toward hepatitis E virus. (2008 publication); and occult hepatitis B is present in 3.9 per cent of patients with hepatitis C (2010 publication).\n\nPrevalence surveys\n------------------\n- 29.8 per cent of viral hepatitis cases (2001)\n- 3.6 per cent of acute hepatitis patients hospitalized in Cairo (2002)\n- 8 per cent of acute hepatitis among military recruits (2012 publication)\n- 2.02 per cent of asymptomatic children ages 1 to 9 years (2007 publication)\n- 21 per cent of acute hepatitis in children (2013 publication)\n- 78.5 per cent of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (2008 publication)\n- 89.2 per cent of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and 49.3 per cent of those with other forms of cancer (2012 publication)\n- 18 per cent of dental instruments tested in Alexandria (HCV RNA, 2012 publication)\n\nSeroprevalence surveys\n----------------------\n- 14.7 per cent of persons ages 15 to 59 years, nationwide (2008)\n- 5 per cent to 15 per cent of pregnant women, 5 per cent to 25 per cent of blood donors and 0 per cent to 40 per cent of other groups (meta-analysis, 2013 publication)\n- 24.8 per cent of blood donors, nationwide -- highest rates in the central and north-eastern Nile River delta, and the Nile River valley south of Cairo (1993)\n- 4.3 per cent of blood donors (2006 to 2012)\n- 8 per cent of blood donors (2006 publication)\n- 16.8 per cent of blood donors (2011 publication)\n- 11.95 per cent of volunteer blood donors (2009 publication)\n- 9.02 per cent of blood donors in Minya Governorate (2000 to 2008)\n- 3.5 per cent of blood donors in Alexandria (2007 to 2008)\n- 13.9 per cent of healthy persons and 78.5 per cent of hepatocellular carcinoma patients (literature review, 2009 publication)\n- 5.8 per cent of healthy children ages 6 to 15 (Alexandria, 2011 publication)\n- 65 per cent of children ages 1 to 9 years in Cairo (2011 publication)\n- 9.7 per cent of university students\n- 22.1 per cent of army recruits\n- 13.6 per cent to 19 per cent (Cairo) to 20.8 per cent (Alexandria, 1992 to 1994) of blood donors\n- 10.9 per cent of persons in El-ghar village, Zagazig (2006 to 2007)\n- 2.7 per cent of voluntary student blood donors in Mansoura (2006 publication)\n- 19 per cent of pregnant women in Alexandria (2000 publication)\n- 15.8 per cent of pregnant women in the Nile Delta (2006 publication)\n- 7.4 per cent of pregnant women in Assiut (2010 publication)\n- 8.6 per cent of pregnant women (2010 publication)\n- 12.1 per cent of rural school children\n- 51 per cent of adults above age 40 (Nile Delta)\n- 75.8 per cent to 83 per cent of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (2001 publication)\n- 2 per cent of Bedouins in Al Arish (Northern Sinai) and 5 per cent in Nuweiba (Southern Sinai) (2001)\n- 23.4 per cent (urban) to 27.4 per cent (rural) of the population of Sharkia Governorate (2004 publication)\n- 14.3 per cent of tourism workers in South Sinai governorate (1996 publication)\n- 72.9 per cent of persons with elevated serum hepatic enzymes in Ismailia (2009 publication)\n- 8.5 per cent of patients with chronic fascioliasis (1998 publication)\n- 51.7 per cent of multitransfused thalassemic children (2011 publication)\n- 19.5 per cent of multitransfused thalassemic patients (2009 to 2010)\n- 34.4 per cent of multitransfused thalassemic patients and 19.2 per cent of their family members (2013 publication)\n- 82 per cent of multitransfused patients with beta thalassemia (2013 publication)\n- 76 per cent of children with beta thalassemia (Mid-Delta, 2010 to 2011)\n- 35 per cent of hemodialysis patients in Al Gharbiyah Governorate (2011)\n- 40 per cent of hemophiliac children (2012 publication)\n- 18.5 per cent of patients admitted to a rheumatology department (Cairo, 2011 publication)\n- 16.6 per cent of health care workers at the National Liver Institute (Nile Delta, 2008 to 2010)\n- 63 per cent of IDU, vs. 27.5 per cent of controls (1995 publication)\n- 15.8 per cent of prisoners (2013 publication)\n- 8.5 per cent of STD patients (1993 to 1995)\n- 12.3 per cent of barbers and 12.7 per cent of their clients in Gharbia (2010 publication)\n- 84 per cent of patients who had received intravenous schistosomiasis therapy during the 1980s (2011 publication)\n- 2.4 per cent of first-generation Egyptian migrants living in the Netherlands (Amsterdam, 2009 to 2010).\n\nReferences\n----------\n1.

The spike in the disease, which is transmitted by blood, involved people [aged] from 20 to 34. It's possible some of the new reports involved people who have moved into Park County for substance-abuse treatment, but officials say they don't know how much that has contributed.\n\nGrajczyk said the county's rate has been rising since 2008. Park County Public Health Nurse Manager Bill Crampton and Grajczyk spoke at a recent meeting of the Park County Health Coalition in Powell. They were looking for ideas on how to stop the spread of the disease and how to help those already infected. 'We're talking about hepatitis C here, but in reality, it is at-risk kids, 15 to 30, who are doing all kinds of things that maybe we don't want to acknowledge or that we know about but don't know what to do about,' Crampton said.\n\nThe Department of Health and Public Health spearheaded a campaign in May 2013 to raise awareness of the problem. It hung posters around the county warning people that if they're injecting drugs, they may be at risk for communicable diseases and hepatitis.\n\n'Hepatitis C is for life. You can put it into remission. You can live with it. You can live a full and healthy life,' Crampton said at the meeting. 'But you may need treatment for some of these folks that will bear hepatitis C badly, and how do we assist them?'\n\nIn the initial stages, infected people are unlikely to display symptoms. But once the infection progresses over several years, a person may have elevated liver enzymes and feel joint pain, fatigue, and chronic abdominal pain. Liver damage or cancer can result from the disease. Some people can die from an infection, Grajczyk said.\n\nTreatment of hepatitis C is expensive, and Grajczyk said many of the people infected lack adequate insurance.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Park County is located in the state of Wyoming. The population was 28 205 at the 2010 census. The county contains the majority (more than 53 percent) of Yellowstone National Park's total land area. A map of the counties of Wyoming showing the location of Park county can be accessed at: http://www.ezilon.com/maps/united-states/wyoming-counties-and-road-maps.html.\n\nNo doubt, the location of Park County attracts foot-loose young people, including a higher proportion of intravenous drug-abusers than in the general population. There is no protective vaccine, but effective treatments are becoming available. The Park authorities are to be commended in trying to raise awareness of the situation among young people attracted to this part of Wyoming. The treatments are expensive and are virus genotype dependent.\n\nHepatitis C is a contagious liver disease that results from infection with the hepatitis C virus. It can range in severity from a mild illness lasting a few weeks to a serious, lifelong illness. Hepatitis C virus is usually spread when blood from an infected person enters the body of a susceptible person. It is among the most common viruses that infect the liver. The delayed onset of the disease masks the seriousness of the potential outcome of hepatitis C virus infection.\n\nThe incubation period for hepatitis C is 2 weeks to 6 months. Following initial infection, approximately 80 percent of people do not exhibit any symptoms. Those who are acutely symptomatic may exhibit fever, fatigue, decreased appetite, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, dark urine, grey-coloured faeces, joint pain, and jaundice (yellowing of skin and the whites of the eyes).\n\nAbout 75-85 percent of newly infected persons develop chronic infection, and 60-70 percent of chronically infected people eventually develop chronic liver disease; 5-20 percent develop cirrhosis and 1-5 percent die from cirrhosis or liver cancer. In 25 percent of liver cancer patients, the underlying cause is hepatitis C virus infection.\n\nDiagnosis of chronic infection is made when hepatitis C virus RNA is identified by nucleic acid testing in a person with antibodies against hepatitis C virus. Specialized tests are often needed subsequently to evaluate patients for liver disease, including cirrhosis and liver cancer.\n\nCombination antiviral therapy with interferon and ribavirin has been the mainstay of hepatitis C treatment. Unfortunately, interferon is not always well tolerated, and some virus genotypes respond better to interferon than others. Treatment with newer, specific antivirals can be successful but are currently very expensive. - Mod.CP\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/r/3aGm.]", "summary": "\n\nAbout 75-85 percent of newly infected persons develop chronic infection, and 60-70 percent of chronically infected people eventually develop chronic liver disease; 5-20 percent develop cirrhosis and 1-5 percent die from cirrhosis or liver cancer. \n\nHepatitis C is a contagious liver disease that results from infection with the hepatitis C virus.

Of 198 such PWID, 147 (74.2 per cent), 45 (22.7 per cent), and 6 (3.0 per cent) carried genotype 1, 3, or 4, respectively, and 31 (72.1 per cent) of the 43 genotype 1 sequences were of subtype 1a. Genotype 3 was significantly more prevalent in provincial towns than in the capital, Budapest. Injecting for a longer period and an older age both correlated with a higher prevalence of genotype 3, suggesting possible future changes in genotype distribution. The distributions of hepatitis C virus genotypes/subtypes differed significantly between the tested PWID and the general population. The identification of genotype 3 reflected its worldwide occurrence among PWID. Our results underline the importance of genotyping before treatment, especially among people who have ever injected drugs in Hungary.\n\nIntroduction\n------------\nHepatitis C virus (HCV) may rarely cause symptomatic acute hepatitis. The infection becomes persistent in about 85 per cent of these cases, and its persistence may be responsible for liver cirrhosis, end-stage liver disease, and hepatocellular carcinoma. HCV has been suggested to have 6 genotypes, which differ from each other by 31-33 per cent at the nucleotide level and are further classified into several subtypes. These genotypes have different susceptibility to treatment. Each genotype and subtype exhibits a certain geographical distribution, for example, genotypes 1, 2, and 3 occur virtually worldwide. On the American continent subtype 1a is the most prevalent, in Europe it is subtype 1b. Genotype 4 is mainly present in North and Central Africa and in the Middle East. Genotype 3 originates from Asia, but subtype 3a is widely distributed among people who inject drugs (PWID) around the world. In Hungary, subtype 1b has been reported in 85 per cent, subtype 1a in 4.5 per cent, and genotype 3 in 0.5 per cent of chronic HCV carriers among the general population, with mixed infections in the remainder. A similar genotype distribution, but without mixed infections, has been observed in southern Hungary.\n\nSince the screening of blood products for HCV was introduced in Europe in the 1990s, HCV transmission has become closely associated with the sharing of injection equipment among PWID. In Hungary, 126 acute HCV cases were reported to the National Center for Epidemiology (NCE) from 2006 to 2010. In 72 cases, the epidemiological investigations revealed potential risk factors, and injection drug use was reported in 20 of these patients. The seroprevalence of HCV among PWID is high (22.6 per cent in 2008) relative to similar age groups in the general population (less than 1 per cent).\n\nNo data are available on HCV genotypes in Hungarian PWID. The aims of the present study were therefore to determine the genotype and subtype distributions in this group, to predict possible changes in such distributions, and to examine the phylogenetic relatedness of the HCV sequences.\n\n[Interested readers are referred to the original document via the source URL above to view the methodology, data, and results]. - Mod.CP]\n\nDiscussion\n----------\nThe genotype and subtype distributions of HCV were found to differ between PWID and the general population. The abundance of genotype 3 and subtype 1a among PWID was in accordance with data on PWID in industrialised nations worldwide. Since genotype 3 and subtype 1a are rare in the general Hungarian population, we assume that Hungary is involved in the worldwide epidemic of these genotypes among PWID, and that genotype 3 and subtype 1a may possibly have entered the Hungarian population of PWID from abroad. Genotype 3 proved to be significantly more frequent among PWID who entered the study in the provincial towns than in Budapest. This observation suggests that PWID communities with different genotype frequencies exist in Hungary.\n\nOf the 4 HCV genotype 4-infected PWID outside Budapest, 3 were residents of the same town, Veszprem (ca. 64 000 inhabitants). Only 4 PWID in Veszprem were found to be positive for HCV: 3 of them carried genotype 4 and one genotype 3. Although few viruses were genotyped, our data suggested a possible epidemic of HCV genotype 4 among PWID in Veszprem. In contrast, all 5 HCV RNA-positive individuals detected in the general population of Veszprem carried genotype 1. HCV genotype 4 is often associated with drug injection use in Europe.\n\nA shorter duration of drug injection use was found to correlate with a higher prevalence of genotype 1 and a lower prevalence of genotype 3. The prevalence of genotype 1 was significantly higher in the youngest age group (younger than 25 years old). Younger PWID are most likely to present with a more recently acquired infection. These data suggest that the prevalence of HCV genotypes may drift towards genotype 1 in the future among Hungarian PWID. In contrast, the genotype recently emerging among PWID in the Czech Republic is genotype 3. No other publication was found about changes in genotype distributions in other neighbouring countries.\n\nThe correlation between the HCV genotype and the type of drug injected was not confirmed after adjusting the data to the duration of injection drug use and geographical distribution. Consequently, the correlation between opiate use and infection with genotype 3 was probably due to an association of opiate use with the users' older age and the duration of drug use.\n\nThe prevalence of different genotypes observed in the general population in Hungary was similar to our results. Importantly, none of the individuals in our study was infected with more than one genotype or subtype, either in the general population or among the PWID, whereas others have identify mixed infections. This difference might be due to the use of different versions of the LIPA kit for subtyping.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis of the NS5B nucleotide sequences of the genotype 3 viruses confirmed previous findings that genotype 3 HCVs from PWID in different geographical areas do not form well-defined clades. However, some clear sub-clusters with strong bootstrap values were apparent in the Hungarian sequences, suggesting that the individuals in the sub-clusters were infected by each other, probably through unsafe practices of drug injection. We did not sequence the whole genomes, thus recombinant viruses may not have been recognised if they were present, and may have been misclassified.\n\nThe determination of HCV genotypes in PWID is of more than epidemiological significance. More than 95 per cent of the HCV carriers in the Hungarian general population are infected with HCV genotype 1. The current National Treatment Protocol specifies that genotyping is not compulsory before treatment and is strongly recommended only for foreign nationals living in Hungary. Our findings lead us to propose that the Treatment Protocol should be modified to include Hungarian PWID in addition to foreigners. Since genotype 3 is relatively susceptible to treatment and is common among PWID, it is possible that the shorter treatment time (24 versus 48 weeks) and the higher cure rate (greater than 75 per cent versus about 45 per cent) can help convince people who have ever injected drugs to accept and complete a course of treatment, and would also reduce costs. We assume that genotyping and subtyping will remain or become a more important tool for individualised therapy in the future in view of upcoming treatments with direct acting agents.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Determination of the genotypes of hepatitis C virus is more than an academic exercise because the genotypes and subtypes respond differently to the increasing number of antivirals now becoming available and to treatment protocols.

They are based on data from 8434 Canadians aged 14 to 79. The study, published Wednesday [20 Nov 2013] by Statistics Canada, found 0.4 per cent of people surveyed were infected with hepatitis B and 0.5 per cent were infected with hepatitis C. Half of the people with hepatitis B said they were unaware of the infection; 70 per cent of the people with hepatitis C said they did not know they were infected.\n\nExperts have been warning that Canada is facing an unrecognized health care crisis with hepatitis C, because undetected and untreated infections in the baby boom generation will trigger a surge in cases of liver failure and liver cancer. The chairman of the board of the Canadian Liver Foundation suggests the new estimates are actually unhelpful, because they give a falsely reassuring sense of the scope of the problem. 'I think they're actually harmful, and counterproductive. Because I think it's minimizing the true state of affairs,' said Dr Morris Sherman, a hepatologist (liver specialist) at Toronto General Hospital. The survey estimates 138 600 Canadians have hepatitis C. But Statistic Canada's own website reports that the number of diagnosed cases of hepatitis C in the country -- it is a reportable disease -- is nearly 300 000, Sherman notes. The Canadian Health Measures Survey is designed to test a representative sample of Canadians for a range of different conditions -- things like high blood pressure, diabetes and obesity. It does not include 1st nations people living on reserves, prison inmates, members of the Armed Forces or people living in some remote regions.\n\nTo get a good idea of the scale of the hepatitis B and C problems, the survey would need strong representation from certain population groups that typically don't agree to take part in this kind of a study, says Dr Mel Krajden, a hepatitis C expert with the British Columbia (BC) Centre for Disease Control. Those groups include injection drug users, the homeless, 1st nations people, prison inmates and immigrants from parts of the world where hepatitis B and C infections are more common than they are in Canada. Those include South Asia, China and Eastern Europe.\n\n'The study wasn't designed to specifically understand the epidemiology of [hepatitis] B and C. Unless you sample these populations correctly, you may not accurately estimate what's going on,' Krajden says. He notes it is typically extremely hard to accurately sample these groups. In particular, immigrants from some parts of the world where rates of these infections are high may be distrustful of this type of study and refuse to take part, he says. Krajden says British Columbia knows the hepatitis C status of about one quarter of its population, because a lot of testing has been done there. About 1.4 per cent of the province's total population is hepatitis C positive; among baby boomers, where the risk is greatest, the rate is 3 per cent, he says. Krajden says BC rates may be higher than other provinces, because there are higher rates of injection drug users there. While he called the new data 'a step in the right direction,' he too believes the estimates in this new report are artificially low.\n\nIn related news Wednesday [20 Nov 2013], Janssen Inc. announced that Health Canada has approved its new hepatitis C drug Galexos (its generic name is simeprevir). Doctors who treat people with hepatitis C have been anxiously awaiting approval of this and another pending new drug as they are expected to be significantly easier for patients to take and should have a higher success rate. But the new drugs are expected to be very costly, and experts worry that may slow their adoption.\n\n[byline: Helen Branswell]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Hepatitis B is a potentially life-threatening liver infection caused by the hepatitis B virus. It is a major global health problem. It can cause chronic liver disease and chronic infection and puts people at high risk of death from cirrhosis of the liver and liver cancer. An effective vaccine against hepatitis B has been available since 1982. Hepatitis B vaccine is 95 per cent effective in preventing infection and its chronic consequences, and was the 1st vaccine against a major human cancer.\n\nHepatitis C is a contagious liver disease that results from infection with hepatitis C virus. It can range in severity from a mild illness lasting a few weeks to a serious, lifelong illness. Hepatitis C virus is usually spread when blood from an infected person enters the body of a susceptible person. It is among the commonest viruses that infect the liver. About 150 million people are chronically infected and at risk of developing liver cirrhosis and/or liver cancer, and the numbers are increasing. Hepatitis C is found worldwide with some countries having chronic infection rates as high as 5 per cent and above. The main mode of transmission in these countries is attributed to unsafe injections using contaminated equipment. No vaccines are available to provide protection, but effective (but expensive) treatments are becoming available (as reported in the above press report). There are at least 6 genotypes of hepatitis C virus, and they may respond differently to treatment. Careful screening is necessary before starting the treatment to determine the most appropriate approach for the patient. Previously, combination antiviral therapy with interferon and the drug ribavirin has been the basis of hepatitis C treatment.

The statistics were revealed in the Kirby Institute's Annual Surveillance Report 2013 released at the Australasian HIV & AIDS Conference in Darwin this week.\n\nThe report found that almost 400 deaths in 2012 were related to hepatitis B-related liver disease despite the rate of diagnosis of newly acquired hepatitis B infection declining among those aged 30 years or older as well as reducing substantially among people aged 15-29 since 2003. In 2012, NSW had the highest number of diagnoses of hepatitis B infection, with 34.7 percent of the national total.\n\nHepatitis NSW CEO Stuart Loveday said that if not diagnosed and managed properly, hepatitis B infection can lead to cirrhosis, liver cancer or liver failure. 'Deaths from primary liver cancer are climbing faster than any other cause of cancer death in Australia, and untreated chronic hepatitis B is a major contributor,' Loveday said. 'An estimated 383 deaths in 2012 were attributable to hepatitis B-related liver disease. 'It is important to remember that many people with hepatitis B don't experience any symptoms at all, so getting tested is critical.'\n\nProfessor of Gastroenterology and Hepatology at Australian National University Narci Teoh said treatments currently available for hepatitis B were highly effective, well tolerated, and very simple to administer. 'We can tailor and individualise those treatments to people,' Professor Teoh said. 'It is critical for people with hepatitis B to be informed and start a conversation with their doctor in order to understand what this virus does and how to look after themselves and their liver.'\n\nLoveday said vaccination was the simplest way to prevent contracting hepatitis B. 'While most children born in Australia have been vaccinated, if you think you might be at risk of contracting hepatitis B, consult your doctor about getting vaccinated,' he said.\n\nThe Annual Surveillance Report also found that an estimated 310 000 people living in Australia in 2012 had been exposed to hepatitis C, with it thought that 173 500 had chronic hepatitis C infection and early liver disease, 51 500 had chronic hepatitis C infection and moderate liver disease, and 6500 were living with hepatitis C related cirrhosis. The other 80 000 people believed to have to have been exposed have cleared their infection.\n\nThe Kirby Institute estimates that almost 80 percent of all infections for hepatitis C occur among people who inject drugs, with only one percent of those people currently receiving treatment. Unlike other types of hepatitis, there is currently no vaccine to prevent hepatitis C, and medication is the only way to manage the disease.\n\nIn February 2013, the previous Labor federal government announced it will provide more than AUD 220 million [one Australia dollar is equivalent to 0.93 US dollars at the current date] over 5 years to subsidise [treatment with] hepatitis C medications boceprevir (Victrelis) and telaprevir (Incivo) through the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS).\n\nIt is believed that 10-15 percent of all people living with HIV in Australia may also have hepatitis C and that co-infection remains a serious issue.\n\n[Byline: Serkan Ozturk]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Hepatitis B virus infection can be prevented by vaccination.

Since 2007, the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene reports, hepatitis C virus (HCV) deaths in the nation have been increasing yearly and have surpassed those from HIV/AIDS. Nationwide, of an estimated 4 million infected with HCV, around 85 percent are chronic carriers of the virus. Because 80 percent of infections don't show signs for decades, treatment for HCV [infection] is often delayed, allowing the virus to replicate and undermine liver function.\n\nIn New York, at least half of those with HCV don't know they are infected. In the nation, the figure is estimated to be closer to 75 percent. There are an estimated 146 000 infected people in the city. But limited surveillance may have obscured the true picture of viral incidence citywide; it could be significantly higher. The city's health department, or DOHMH, is mounting its 1st ever campaign to reduce illness and death from HCV. But due to a lack of financial commitment -- particularly from the federal government -- the city and healthcare workers find themselves limited in what they can do.\n\nWhile viral hepatitis comes in many forms, acute or chronic, all types inflame the liver. Hepatitis A (virus), for instance, is transmitted by eating contaminated food or drinking tainted water. It tends to be acute, meaning people get over it after a short illness. Hepatitis B is spread via blood, semen and saliva and is often chronic, through there is a vaccine. In 80 percent of infections, HCV is chronic. It can spread, like hepatitis B, via a range of body fluids but primarily is blood-borne. There is no vaccine, though rapid improvements in drug treatment means the disease is curable in up to 75 percent of infections.\n\nIn New York City as around the country, HCV disproportionately affects people of color. Blacks are much more likely than their white counterparts to be admitted into hospital with complications from the virus (infection). Because HCV is carried by blood, people who inject drugs represent the single biggest risk factor for infection. Among IV-drug users, HCV is more easily transmitted than HIV. Worldwide, 10 million intravenous drug users carry the virus. An estimated 70 to 80 percent of the 35 000 new HCV infections occurring in the United States each year are among people who inject drugs, according to the National Institute for the Study of Drug Abuse. Drug users who also drink a lot of alcohol, which is common, are at special risk for liver cancer from HCV.\n\nHCV has a heavier viral load than HIV, giving it staying power on surfaces and making paraphernalia a key source of transmission. 'Cookers,' (the metallic spoon on which heroin is heated so that it liquefies and can be injected) are of particular concern, as is shared cotton. A straw used for sniffing cocaine is also a risk factor due to contaminated mucus. Due largely to drug abuse and tattooing, hepatitis C infection is the leading blood-borne virus in American prisons, and high incidence is reported among the estimated 90 000 inmates at Riker's Island correctional facility: 10 percent of Rikers' detainees had preexisting HCV infection, though an additional 10 to 15 percent of inmates are likely to carry the infection but don't know it.\n\nWhile needle-exchange programs have helped reduce HCV transmission in the city, experts say education programs are still urgently needed. Patient outreach for this population that links them with care is also seriously understaffed and under-funded. Of the city's more than 100 000 heroin users, HCV prevalence is estimated by the Health Department to be 50 percent. The Bronx had the largest number of new infections in recent years. According to the Health Department, in the South Bronx and East and Central Harlem, only 40 percent of New Yorkers with HCV have been evaluated by a doctor for possible treatment. As many in doctors' offices around the city have been learning, something a patient did decades ago but has forgotten, like sharing a dirty needle or a soda straw, can eventually come back to haunt them in the form of HCV. While most infections today and from the 70s stem from IV drug use, blood transfusions before 1992 are also a major risk in transmission.\n\nA professor of medicine at Columbia University, Dr. Robert Brown isn't seeing an epidemic of new cases of HCV, but 'an epidemic in new cases of liver disease' in people who've had the virus for some time and are now feeling its worst effects. In one week this fall [2013], he saw 2 patients who will die in 6 months from the liver complications caused by the virus. While the epidemic hurts the poor disproportionately, he sees patients from all walks of life infected with the virus, often 'with a spouse, a family, and a good job,' he says. He says the likelihood of thousands dying in coming years from infection is a 'conservative' estimate.\n\nThere are drug therapies that cure HCV [infection], but they stand a far better chance of working if started before a patient develops serious complications. Testing for HCV is a 2-step process. A preliminary antibody test determines whether a patient has, at some point in their life, been exposed to the virus; a rapid version of this test is available that gives results in 20 minutes. A 2nd test is required, however, to confirm the infection before the patient is linked to treatment, much less likely to happen if you are poor and an IV drug abuser. Because of a lack of health insurance coverage, the 2nd test is not always available.\n\nA recent report from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) spelled out this danger. It found that of close to 220 000 newly documented cases in the country from 2005 to 2011, only half received follow-up testing, presumably due to a lack of health insurance coverage. And the percentage of deaths among persons who received only the HCV antibody positive was significantly higher than those who received the follow-up test.\n\nHCV-related deaths jumped by nearly 50 percent from 1999 to 2011, when there were 16 000 deaths. HCV is the leading cause of complications from chronic liver disease, according to the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPTF), and its impact is not expected to peak for several years. The virus is also a leading cause of liver transplants in the United States. Nationally, close to 75 percent of total HCV infections are among baby boomers; one in 33 of them is estimated to carry the virus. Only recently, the CDC changed its guidelines to include one-time HCV testing for all persons born between 1945 and 1965 regardless of other risk factors. Recently Gov. Cuomo made New York State the 1st in the nation to mandate testing for baby boomers. In a 2013 article in (the journal) Hepatology, Dr. Brian Edlin, Associate Professor of Public Health and Medicine at the Weill Medical College of Cornell University, says that mandatory testing -- if imposed nationally -- may detect more than a million new cases in the country and save at least 100 000 lives. But even among those diagnosed, according to a recent report by the DOHMH, too few are offered treatment. With a lack of funding for patient outreach, the infected IV user in the city -- who may suffer from other risk factors like alcoholism, homelessness or mental illness -- may never get linked to care.\n\nA response to the epidemic, DOHMH'S Action Plan, is 'the 1st ever aimed at reducing illness and death from the epidemic.' According to the plan, the city is facing an 'anticipated wave of HCV-related illness, leading to billions of dollars in health care costs and lost productivity.' But the plan can blunt all that, says a hopeful Health Commissioner Dr. Thomas Farley.\n\nDOHMH's action plan identifies 7 public health objectives to address the HCV epidemic in New York City, including enhancing public awareness and health provider awareness about screening, diagnosis and referral. It also aims to 'enhance linkage to care for persons with current HCV infection' and '[build] clinical capacity to manage and treat HCV.' Because insurance plans can present even more barriers to care, the federal Affordable Care Act promises to extend care for many more and improve treatment and survival rates. 'Game-changing' drugs should also substantially change the whole landscape, says Sean Barry of Vocal-New York. But without more funding, some are skeptical that those changes will have much effect.\n\nWhile admiring the Action Plan as a way forward, Brown says much more money is needed for comprehensive testing and treatment. An optimist, he agrees with Farley that new medication, which is easier to tolerate, will improve treatment and is just around the corner. But with inadequate funding for testing and treatment, 'What good are the new drugs if you can't find the people?' he asks.\n\nDaniel Raymond, policy director at the Harm Reduction Coalition, agrees. Without the money to support it, Farley's plan is 'aspirational,' he says. On top of federal dollars, the city needs to make a serious cash injection as well. According to the health department, nearly USD 3 million from the government and private sector has been spent by DOHMH in the last 3 years to fight viral hepatitis, including HCV. For many researchers and analysts, a lack of political will explains the 'anemic' response to the disease citywide and across the nation, Raymond says the high prevalence of the disease among intravenous drug abusers explains in large part why politicians have given the epidemic little attention.\n\n[Byline: Gerard Flynn]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The above is a rather pessimistic assessment of hepatitis C virus infection as an emerging disease in the United States and New York City in particular.\n\nHepatitis C is a contagious liver disease that results from infection with hepatitis C virus. It can range in severity from a mild illness lasting a few weeks to a serious, lifelong illness. Hepatitis C virus is usually spread when blood from an infected person enters the body of a susceptible person. It is among the most common viruses that infect the liver.\n\nGlobally, 3 to 4 million people are infected with the hepatitis C virus. About 150 million people are chronically infected and at risk of developing liver cirrhosis and/or liver cancer, and the numbers are increasing. More than 350 000 people die from hepatitis C-related liver diseases every year according to a recent survey by the WHO. Hepatitis C is found worldwide with some countries having chronic infection rates as high as 5 percent and above. The main mode of transmission in these countries is attributed to unsafe injections using contaminated equipment.\n\nHepatitis C virus is most commonly transmitted through exposure to infectious blood. Hepatitis C may be transmitted through sex with an infected person or sharing personal items contaminated with infectious blood, but these are less common routes. Hepatitis C is not spread through breast milk, food or water or by casual contact such as hugging, kissing and sharing food or drinks with an infected person. The incubation period for hepatitis C is 2 weeks to 6 months. Following initial infection, approximately 80 percent of people do not exhibit any symptoms. Those who are acutely symptomatic may exhibit fever, fatigue, decreased appetite, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, dark urine, grey-coloured faeces, joint pain and jaundice. About 75-85 percent of newly infected persons develop chronic infection and 60-70 percent of chronically infected people develop chronic liver disease; 5-20 percent develop cirrhosis and 1-5 percent die from cirrhosis or liver cancer. In 25 percent of liver cancer patients, the underlying cause is hepatitis C.\n\nNo vaccines are available to provide protection, but effective treatments are becoming available. There are 6 genotypes of hepatitis C virus, and they may respond differently to treatment. Careful screening is necessary before starting the treatment to determine the most appropriate approach for the patient. Previously, combination antiviral therapy with interferon and the drug ribavirin has been the basis of hepatitis C treatment (For more information, see: http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs164/en/index.html. - Mod.CP\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/r/26hb.]", "summary": "About 75-85 percent of newly infected persons develop chronic infection and 60-70 percent of chronically infected people develop chronic liver disease; 5-20 percent develop cirrhosis and 1-5 percent die from cirrhosis or liver cancer.

Although the hepatitis C epidemic receives less than 3 percent of the federal funding given to the fight against HIV/AIDS, it is the most common chronic blood-borne infection in the United States today, and the deadliest.

In 25 percent of liver cancer patients, the underlying cause is hepatitis C.\n\nNo vaccines are available to provide protection, but effective treatments are becoming available.

As of Fri 6 Sep 2013, there are 7 cases identified in 3 women and 4 men, all older than 60.\n\nMost of the hepatitis C cases reported to the Department of Health are categorized as chronic cases, meaning the patients may have been infected years ago and may or may not have ever experienced symptoms of the disease. A case categorized as acute means the person was recently infected. At the start of this investigation, 3 acute cases were diagnosed within a few months and within the same geographic area. This cluster of acute cases is unusual to appear in North Dakota, and thus an investigation was initiated to determine whether there is a possible connection between these cases.\n\nTesting has indicated that the virus from the 1st 3 cases is genetically linked; additional cases identified through our investigation are genetically linked as well. Cases that are genetically linked could indicate a possible common source. However, at this time, no source has been identified. Health officials are currently working to identify how these individuals were exposed and whether there is a common source. Moving forward, any possible associations between these cases will be evaluated. Additional people who may have events or activities in common with these cases may also be tested for hepatitis C. Those who are considered at risk will be contacted by phone or mail and given guidance about testing procedures. If you are not contacted regarding testing, there is no recommended action to take.\n\nIt's important to note that hepatitis C is not spread easily from person to person and is not spread through the air when people cough or sneeze. Hepatitis C is spread primarily through direct exposure to blood or blood products from an infected person. Anyone can get hepatitis C, but those at greater risk include:\n- Current or past injection drug users.\n- Recipients of blood and/or solid organs before 1992.\n- Recipients of clotting factors (products given to help blood clot) made before 1987.\n- Hemodialysis patients.\n- Infants born to infected mothers.\n\nHepatitis C is a viral infection of the liver caused by the hepatitis C virus. Hepatitis C can lead to lifelong (chronic) infection and can cause serious liver damage (cirrhosis or liver cancer) and death. About 80 percent of people infected with HCV have mild or no signs or symptoms initially. Symptoms may include tiredness, loss of appetite, nausea, abdominal discomfort, vomiting, dark urine or jaundice (i.e., yellowing of skin or whites of eyes). Some people recover fully, but 55 percent to 85 percent of infected people carry the virus in their blood for a lifetime and develop chronic infection.\n\nHealth officials will continue to investigate these cases and conduct testing of individuals as necessary. Additional testing will help to determine whether there is a connection between the confirmed cases and whether there are other people in the community who have been infected. As the investigation continues, updates will be released on this website and through media outlets.\n\nPeople who have hepatitis C should remain aware that their blood and possibly other body fluids are potentially infective. Care should be taken to avoid blood exposure to others by not sharing toothbrushes, razors, needles, or any other objects that may have become contaminated with blood. In addition, infected people must not donate blood and should inform their health-care providers so that proper health care can be provided.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[2]\nDate: Thu 17 Oct 2013\nSource: North Dakota Dept. of Health, News Release [edited]\nhttp://www.ndhealth.gov/disease/Hepatitis/\n\n\nOn Thu 17 Oct 2013, the North Dakota Department of Health received confirmation from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) that testing had been completed on blood samples from additional individuals in the hepatitis C outbreak investigation in Ward County. The CDC has confirmed that 21 additional cases are related to the 7 cases that had previously been identified, bringing the total number of related cases to 28. In addition, as the investigation progresses, more people will likely be tested.\n\nAccording to Tracy Miller, State Epidemiologist with the North Dakota Department of Health, the state is receiving assistance in this investigation from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. CDC personnel are in Minot to assist state investigators. As this investigation proceeds, the Department of Health will continue to provide updates to the public as to the course of the investigation.\n\nFor members of the public who may have additional questions about either this outbreak or hepatitis C in general, the Department of Health has activated their public health hotline. The hotline will be open from 8 am to 5 pm weekdays. The hotline can be contacted by calling toll-free 1-866-207-2880 during business hours.\n\nInformation will also be available on the Department of Health's Facebook page and on Twitter, with the hashtag '#ndhepc.'

Dr Helen Harris, a hepatitis expert at Public Health England, said: 'While there has been an increase in confirmed cases of hepatitis C infection, partly as a result of increased testing and partly because of improved laboratory reporting, sadly, many people chronically infected with hepatitis C remain unaware of their infection.'\n\nFor many, it can be several years or even decades before they develop symptoms. Antiviral therapies exist that will clear the virus in most cases, yet only around 3 percent of the chronically infected population in England access them each year. If the number of people being treated is doubled over the next 10 years, around 6000 new cases of hepatitis C-related end stage liver disease could be averted over the next 30 years.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[2]\nDate: Fri 26 Jul 2013\nSource: Health Protection Agency (HPA), Health Protection Report 2013; 7(30) [edited]\nhttp://www.hpa.org.uk/hpr/archives/2013/news3013.htm\n\n\nHepatitis C in the UK annual report\n-----------------------------------\nLaboratory-confirmed new diagnoses of hepatitis C infection (HCV) reported in England rose to 10 873 cases in 2012, up by more than one 3rd from the 7882 cases reported in 2010 -- when statutory notification by diagnostic laboratories was 1st introduced. London accounted for 26 per cent of all cases reported in England in 2012, almost treble -- at 2844 cases -- the 954 reported in London in 2010. These are among the conclusions of the annual hepatitis C report published by Public Health England (PHE) ahead of World Hepatitis Day on Sunday 28 Jul 2013 [1,2].\n\nThe report is the 8th for England, and the 5th also to present consolidated data for the UK as a whole. The main chapters describe: the scale of the UK problem; prevention; diagnosis, testing and awareness of infection; and treatment and care in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, respectively. Data are also presented on testing and diagnosis in respect of particular groups (people who inject drugs, prison populations, black and minority ethnic populations and blood donors).\n\nAcross the UK more than 215 000 individuals are thought to be chronically infected with hepatitis C. In England, around 160 000 people are living with chronic infection, the report confirms, many of whom are unaware of their infection. Over the past 15 years, hospital admissions for hepatitis C-related end stage liver disease and liver cancer in England have increased from 574 in 1998 to 2266 in 2012, while deaths have risen from 115 in 1998 to 326 in 2012.\n\nAntiviral therapies exist that will clear the virus in most cases, yet only around 3 per cent of the chronically infected population in England access them each year. Preliminary results from statistical models presented in the report suggest that cases of hepatitis C-related, end-stage liver disease, and the number of liver cancer patients, could be substantially reduced by increasing access to treatment.\n\nThe greatest risk of hepatitis C infection is associated with sharing equipment for injecting drugs. Data from the Unlinked Anonymous Monitoring (UAM) survey of people who inject drugs suggest that levels of infection in this group remained high in 2012, with around half of those surveyed in England being infected [3].\n\nPHE is encouraging local authorities and NHS colleagues to absorb the recommendations in this report and take local action to drive improvements in the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of hepatitis C infection.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Hepatitis C is found worldwide, with some countries having chronic infection rates as high as 5 per cent and above. Hepatitis C virus is most commonly transmitted through exposure to infectious blood. This can occur through: receipt of contaminated blood transfusions, blood products and organ transplants; injections given with contaminated syringes and needlestick injuries in health care settings; injecting drug use; or being born to a hepatitis C infected mother. Hepatitis C may be transmitted through sex with an infected person or sharing personal items contaminated with infectious blood, but these are less common. Hepatitis C is not spread through breast milk, food or water, or by casual contact such as hugging, kissing and sharing food or drinks with an infected person.\n\nAccording to the HPA report above, the number of cases of hepatitis C has increased by more than a 3rd in 2 years in England. There were 7882 cases confirmed in England in 2010, rising to 10 873 in 2012. The HPA estimates that around 160 000 people are living with chronic infection in England, many of whom are unaware of their infection. London accounted for 26 per cent of all cases reported in England in 2012, almost treble -- at 2844 cases -- the 954 reported in London in 2010. It is likely that there has been a corresponding increase in the prevalence of hepatitis C virus infection throughout the UK.\n\nThe greatest risk of hepatitis C infection is associated with sharing equipment for injecting drugs.

The village has a population of 2358 living in 428 houses. The health department has taken 41 samples, 28 of which have been found positive.\n\nIn December 2012, in a medical camp, 370 people out of 870 were found to be hepatitis C positive. Going by that ratio, the actual number of infected people might be in the range of 800 to 1000. HCV has taken the lives of 25 people of the village. The village has no clinical laboratory or government dispensary. Health facilities are virtually non-existent in the village. Most of the newly elected panchayat [village council] members are victims of the dreaded disease.\n\nRecently a blood donation camp was organised in the village by Dayanand Medical College and Hospital, Ludhiana; 90 units were donated by villagers. Of these, 28 units were found to be HCV positive. A 24 year old villager said he had lost his grandfather, father, and uncle to HCV. Now he, his sister, and cousin are infected. The treatment cost is over INR 200 000 (about USD 3400), so few can afford treatment.\n\nHCV was identified in 1989. The World Health Organization (WHO) compares HCV to a 'viral time bomb'. HCV is responsible for 50-76 per cent of all liver cancer cases worldwide. In 2010, 98 hepatitis C cases were reported from Kalala, Chananwal, Chinniwal, and Sehjra villages. Recently, 13 cases have been reported from Kube village. These villages are in close proximity. The villagers still say unhygienic water is responsible for the epidemic. Health authorities have not made villagers aware not to use contaminated and unsterilised needles, the main source of HCV.\n\nCivil surgeon Dr Renu passed the buck on to unregistered RMPs [rural medical practioners?], holding them responsible for re-using syringes, making people vulnerable to infections. However, she failed to answer why her department had not taken action against such RMPs so far. Such outbreaks are required to be notified to the Integrated Disease Surveillance Project immediately by the health department. The civil surgeon said she was not aware of the previous outbreaks since she joined only 4 months ago. 'We are instructing the civil surgeon to take effective steps and refer patients to Government Medical College, Patiala, and the PGI [Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research] in Chandigarh. The civil surgeon is also being asked to take action against unregistered RMPs,' said deputy commissioner Indu Malhotra.\n\n[byline: BB Goyal]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The extent of hepatitis C virus infection in Kalala village is exceptional. According to WHO (http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs164/en/index.html), hepatitis C is found worldwide, with some countries having chronic infection rates as high as 5 per cent and above. The main mode of transmission in these countries is attributed to unsafe injections using contaminated equipment. Hepatitis C is not a waterborne infection as believed by the Kalala villagers. Hepatitis C virus is most commonly transmitted through exposure to infectious blood. This can occur through receipt of contaminated blood transfusions, blood products and organ transplants; injections given with contaminated syringes and needlestick injuries in health care settings; injection drug use; or by being born to a hepatitis C infected mother. Hepatitis C may be transmitted through sex with an infected person or sharing personal items contaminated with infectious blood, but these are less common. Hepatitis C is not spread through breast milk, food, or water, or by casual contact with an infected person.\n\nAbout 75-85 per cent of newly infected persons develop chronic infection and 60-70 per cent of chronically infected people develop chronic liver disease; 5-20 per cent develop cirrhosis and 1-5 per cent die from cirrhosis or liver cancer. In 25 per cent of liver cancer patients, the underlying cause is hepatitis C.\n\nCombination antiviral therapy with interferon and ribavirin has been the mainstay of hepatitis C treatment. Unfortunately, interferon is not widely available globally, it is not always well tolerated, some virus genotypes respond better to interferon than others, and many people who take interferon do not finish their treatment. This means that while hepatitis C is generally considered to be a curable disease, for many people this is not a reality.\n\nScientific advances have led to the development of new antiviral drugs for hepatitis C, which may be more effective and better tolerated than existing therapies (involving combined use of interferon and ribavirin).

Spanish information on PSE was translated for this review.\n\nWe identified 14 papers specifically on PSE programmes in Switzerland (6 papers), Germany (4) and Spain (4). The 1st PSE programme started in 1992 in Switzerland. As of December 2000, 7 PSEs were operating in Switzerland, 7 in Germany and 5 in Spain. There have been 6 evaluations of prison syringe exchange programmes and all have been favourable. Reports of drug use decreased or remained stable over time. Reports of syringe sharing declined dramatically. No new cases of HIV, hepatitis B or hepatitis C transmission were reported. The evaluations found no reports of serious unintended negative events, such as initiation of injection or of the use of needles as weapons. Staff attitudes were generally positive but response rates to these surveys varied. Overall, this review indicated that prison syringe exchange programmes are feasible and do provide benefit in the reduction of risk behaviour and the transmission of blood-borne infection without any unintended negative consequences.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nJ.

'At least one million Italians are chronic carriers of the infection,' said Massimo Colombo, director of special treatments and organ transplants at Milan's Maggiore hospital. '1/3rd of these people have developed or are developing serious liver infections.'\n\nThe majority of patients contracted the virus in the 1970s and 80s, Colombo said, through infected blood transfusions or from health instruments such as hypodermic needles that were not sterilized. 'But another 200 000 -- 300 000 contracted the disease due to risky behaviour such as unprotected sex, piercings and tattoos. 'In addition, we should include a substantial number of migrants who come from areas with high levels of hepatitis C.'\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Hepatitis C is a contagious liver disease that results from infection with hepatitis C virus. It can range in severity from a mild illness lasting a few weeks to a serious, lifelong illness. Hepatitis C virus is usually spread when blood from an infected person enters the body of a susceptible person. It is among the commonest viruses that infect the liver.\n\nHepatitis C is found worldwide. Countries with high rates of chronic infection are Egypt (15 per cent), Pakistan (4.8 per cent), and China (3.2 per cent). Thus, Italy ranks high in the global scale.\n\nThe incubation period for hepatitis C is 2 weeks to 6 months. Following initial infection, about 80 per cent of people do not exhibit any symptoms. Those people who are acutely symptomatic may exhibit fever, fatigue, decreased appetite, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, dark urine, grey-coloured faeces, joint pain, and jaundice (yellowing of skin and the whites of the eyes). About 75-85 per cent of newly infected people develop chronic disease, and 60-70 per cent of chronically infected people develop chronic liver disease; 5-20 per cent develop cirrhosis, and 1-5 per cent die from cirrhosis or liver cancer. In 25 per cent of liver cancer patients, the underlying cause is hepatitis C. (See: WHO Fact Sheet: http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs164/en/index.html).\n\nHepatitis C does not always require treatment. There are 6 genotypes of hepatitis C virus, and they may respond differently to treatment. Careful screening is necessary before starting the treatment to determine the most appropriate approach. Of the various genotypes of hepatitis C virus, genotype 1 is one of the least responsive to the standard interferon and ribavirin-based therapy and thus most in need of novel treatments. However, new drugs are becoming available that can control genotype 1 infections. Boceprevir (Victrelis) is an inhibitor of the hepatitis C virus non-structural protein NS3-4A serine protease and is used in combination with pegylated interferon (peginterferon)-alpha and ribavirin in the treatment of adults with chronic hepatitis C genotype 1 infection and has proven to be an effective and generally well tolerated treatment for treatment-naive or previously treated adult patients with chronic hepatitis C virus genotype 1 infection. The drug is associated with higher sustained virological response rates in these patients, in whom treatment with interferon and ribavirin alone may not be successful. Thus, Boceprevir in combination with peginterferon-alpha and ribavirin is a valuable new treatment option for use in patients with chronic hepatitis C genotype 1 infection (From: Garnock-Jones KP.

Hepatitis C cases are rising among ACT [Australian Capital Territory] jail inmates as prison guards remain opposed to a new push to start a needle-exchange program at Alexander Maconochie Centre. It has been almost 10 months since Chief Minister Katy Gallagher announced an Australian-first needle exchange at the prison as part of a plan to curb blood-borne disease. The issue, discussed in various forms since the jail's inception, has faced strident opposition from guards, who say it is unworkable and would jeopardise their safety.\n\nThe model would see inmates swap dirty needles for clean needles using safety containers, in a one-for-one exchange overseen by prison medical staff. Guards and prison workers have 6 weeks to respond to the plan, with ongoing consultation and 'focus group' sessions offered in the meantime. Government officials said they left the meeting with 'no doubt' that further changes were needed to win the support of the guards.\n\nBut as the protracted negotiations continue, more inmates have tested positive to hepatitis C. 2 new inmates are known to have acquired the disease inside the jail since March last year [2012], although that number may be higher due to the difficulty in determining 'in-custody transmissions'. There are a further 18 cases where the disease may have been transmitted inside the jail, but where 'in-community transmission' has not been ruled out.\n\nThe Health Directorate said that developing the needle exchange was a 'complex and sensitive process', and that it needed time to work through the range of issues associated with putting the proposal into a practical form. Health Directorate deputy director-general Stephen Goggs said there was a strong turnout at the meeting, and 'frank and forthright participation' by guards. 'It's fair to say that there is still a high level of concern from custodial officers. They're concerned obviously that any needles in the AMC pose a safety risk to them,' Mr Goggs said. 'They're also concerned that almost no model reduces the opportunity for detainees to share needles, so that's something we still need to work through. 'I think we've still got quite a way to go, but they came up with very constructive and direct feedback.'\n\nThe Community and Public Sector Union, which represents ACT prison guards, has maintained its opposition to the needle exchange plan since reacting angrily to the surprise announcement last year [2012]. Union regional director Vince McDevitt said initial reports from Monday's [3 Jun 2013] meeting suggested a number of 'problematic issues' had not been addressed in the detailed model given to guards. 'We will be meeting with our members and consolidating our collective response to the revised proposal next month [June 2013],' he said.\n\nMr McDevitt said the AMC was not the right place to trial a needle exchange, due to its layout, the difficulties in maintaining anonymity of heroin users, and the mixture of a broad range of prisoner types. The union took the issue to Fair Work Australia last August [2012], saying the government had breached a clause in the guards' enterprise agreement by failing to properly consult with them. That clause states 'no needle exchange program ... shall be implemented without prior consultation and agreement by the directorate and union[s]'.\n\nThe Health Directorate said it would be open to guards raising the issue of retaining that clause in the current enterprise agreement bargaining negotiations.\n\n[Byline: Christopher Knaus)\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Hepatitis C is a contagious liver disease that results from infection with hepatitis C virus. It can range in severity from a mild illness lasting a few weeks to a serious, lifelong illness. Hepatitis C virus is usually spread when blood from an infected person enters the body of a susceptible person. It is among the most common viruses that infect the liver. Hepatitis C virus is most commonly transmitted through exposure to infectious blood. This can occur through receipt of contaminated blood transfusions, blood products, and organ transplants; injections given with contaminated syringes and needle-stick injuries in health-care settings; injection drug use; being born to a hepatitis C-infected mother. Hepatitis C may be transmitted through sex with an infected person or sharing of personal items contaminated with infectious blood, but these are less common. Hepatitis C is not spread through breast milk, food, or water or by casual contact such as hugging, kissing, and sharing food or drinks with an infected person.\n\nHepatitis C does not always require treatment. There are 6 genotypes of hepatitis C and they may respond differently to treatment. Combination antiviral therapy with interferon and ribavirin has been the mainstay of hepatitis C treatment. Scientific advances have led to the development of new antiviral drugs for hepatitis C, which may be more effective and better tolerated than existing therapies. Recently 2 new therapeutic agents telaprevir and boceprevir have been licensed in some countries. Much needs to be done to ensure that these advances lead to greater access and treatment globally (see http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs164/en/index.html).\n\nIn view of the advancements in treatment of hepatitis C virus infection, it would seem more important to identify the prisoners with hepatitis C and offer specific treatment, rather than to introduce a needle-exchange programme that would be difficult to implement and might endanger the prison staff administering the scheme. One can easily understand the concern of the prison guards.

Scott Harrington's dental surgical practice.\n\nCompleted laboratory tests on 3122 people who were treated at W. Scott Harrington's dental surgical practice have identified 57 individuals who tested positive for hepatitis C and 3 individuals who tested positive for hepatitis B, the Oklahoma State Department of Health and the Tulsa Health Department announced on 18 Apr 2013. 'Positive results have been reported for HIV, but OSDH Data Security Policy regarding HIV disclosure prohibits public reporting of numbers less than 3,' the 2 agencies stated in a statement posted that day.\n\nThis confirmation came after the 1st round of results from the testing. On 28 Mar 2013, public health officials announced they were notifying current and former patients of the practice that they may have been exposed to bloodborne viruses at Harrington's Tulsa and Owasso offices and urged them to be tested.\n\nThe Oklahoma State Department of Health's Public Health Laboratory completed the testing for 3122 people; 3235 people as of 18 Apr 2013 had visited county health departments to have blood drawn for testing, and an unknown number of others have sought testing through private health care providers, the statement says. It says that based on current Oklahoma disease prevalence data for hepatitis B and C and HIV, health officials know some of the positives probably resulted from infection exposure not related to the Harrington practice. The most recent data available indicates an estimated 4944 people are living with HIV/AIDS in Oklahoma and as many as 68 000 Oklahomans may be infected with hepatitis C.\n\n'We understand these 1st reported test results may be of concern,' said THD Director Dr. Bruce Dart. 'Thorough investigations are routinely conducted upon notification of a positive report for these infections. This response will be handled in the same manner, as disease investigation is a core public health service, and staff are well trained to conduct this type of response.'\n\nThe departments are notifying people who participated in the screening of their test results; those with positive tests are being personally contacted and counseled and will be directed to resources for appropriate care and follow-up. If warranted, testing will be recommended for a spouse or partner.\n\n'This is a complex investigation,' State Epidemiologist Dr. Kristy Bradley said. 'The next phase will include more in-depth interviews of persons who test positive to determine the likelihood that their exposure is associated with their dental surgical procedure at the Harrington practice.

Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 2013; Epub ahead of print]\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nAbstract\n--------\nSeronegative hepatitis -- non-A, non-B, non-C, non-D, non-E hepatitis -- is poorly characterized but strongly associated with serious complications. We collected 92 sera specimens from patients with non-A-E hepatitis in Chongqing, China between 1999 and 2007. 10 sera pools were screened by Solexa deep sequencing. We discovered a 3780-bp contig present in all 10 pools that yielded BLASTx E [basic local alignment search tool] scores of 7e-05-0.008 against parvoviruses. The complete sequence of the in silico-assembled 3780-bp contig was confirmed by gene amplification of overlapping regions over almost the entire genome, and the virus was provisionally designated NIH-CQV. Further analysis revealed that the contig was composed of 2 major ORFs [open reading frames]. By protein BLAST, ORF1 and ORF2 were most homologous to the replication-associated protein of bat circovirus and the capsid protein of porcine parvovirus, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that NIH-CQV is located at the interface of _Parvoviridae_ and _Circoviridae_. Prevalence of NIH-CQV in patients was determined by quantitative PCR. 63 of 90 patient samples (70 per cent) were positive, but all those from 45 healthy controls were negative. Average virus titer in the patient specimens was 1.05 e4 copies/microL. Specific antibodies against NIH-CQV were sought by immunoblotting. 84 per cent of patients were positive for IgG, and 31 per cent were positive for IgM; in contrast, 78 per cent of healthy controls were positive for IgG, but all were negative for IgM. Although more work is needed to determine the etiologic role of NIH-CQV in human disease, our data indicate that a parvovirus-like virus is highly prevalent in a cohort of patients with non-A-E hepatitis.\n\nMost viral hepatitis are secondary to infection by known hepatotropic viruses: hepatitis A virus (HAV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), hepatitis delta virus (HDV), and hepatitis E virus (HEV). Other hepatitis-associated viruses, including CMV [cytomegalovirus], Epstein-Barr virus, herpes simplex virus 1 and 2, varicella-zoster virus, human herpesvirus 6, human parvovirus B19V (B19V), and adenoviruses, may cause liver injury, ranging from mild and transient elevation of aminotransferases to acute hepatitis and occasionally acute liver failure. Despite the number of hepatitis viruses and hepatitis-associated viruses, etiology cannot be determined in 10-20 per cent of the cases of acute hepatitis, in 30 per cent of cases of cryptogenic chronic liver diseases, in hepatitis-associated aplastic anemia, and in a large proportion of cases of acute liver failure. Patients with acute seronegative hepatitis have fewer parenteral risk factors, more severe bilirubin and transaminase elevations, and worse hepatocellular synthetic function than patients with hepatitis C. Moreover, seronegative hepatitis is more strongly associated with serious complications, especially bone marrow failure and childhood fulminant hepatitis.\n\nNext-generation sequencing (NGS) technology has had an increasing impact on biological research and clinical diagnosis, because it provides high-resolution genome-scale data rapidly and reliably. The 1st application of NGS for pathogen discovery in a patient who died of a febrile illness after solid-organ transplantation led to the identification of an arenavirus. NGS based platforms, such as 454 and Solexa deep sequencing, have been applied successfully to the investigation of emerging human pathogens, resulting in major discoveries of new human viruses.\n\nIn the present study, we established an experimental and analytic procedure for identifying virus identification in human specimens based on Solexa deep sequencing. We applied the method to screen for potential viral infection in human sera specimens and discovered a human virus in Chinese patients who had seronegative hepatitis. From its genome organization and phylogeny, the virus is unusual, because it is evolutionarily at the interface of the parvovirus and circovirus families, perhaps having emerged from interfamilial recombination. The virus was highly prevalent in a patient population, and active infection in seronegative hepatitis cases was suggested by the presence of viral DNA in the blood and serology. However, more work is needed to establish a firm disease association.\n\n[Interested readers should access the original text at the source URL above to view the data, figures, and references.

Phylogenetically NIH-CQV appears to lie at the interface of parvoviruses and circoviruses. The genome of NIH-CQV has no homology to any known viruses in GenBank.\n\nAlthough comparative analysis revealed that the Rep and CP proteins of NIH-CQV have limited homologies with circoviruses and parvoviruses, respectively, the overall genome organization of NIH-CQV has the basic characteristics of viruses in _Parvoviridae_.\n\nNIH-CQV has a small, compact linear DNA genome with 2 tandemly arranged major ORFs encoding Rep and CP proteins, respectively, and a pair of ITRs [inverted terminal repeats] at the left and right ends of the genome. In silico promoter prediction suggested that transcription of the rep and cp was regulated by a single promoter upstream of the rep, because there was no apparent promoter sequence immediately upstream of cp. A pre-mRNA encoded by a single promoter that is processed by alternative splicing and alternative polyadenylation to generate multiple mRNAs had been reported for other parvoviruses, such as B19V and Aleutian mink disease virus. By amino acid sequence analysis, CP protein of NIH-CQV is minimally homologous to porcine and goose parvovirus VP1. The homologous region is mainly in the N terminus of CP and contains the conserved PLA2-like motif, which is present in the N-terminal extension of the VP1 unique region of members of _Parvoviridae_. The phylogenetic tree constructed using amino acid sequences of CP of NIH-CQV and VP1 of other representative viruses in _Parvoviridae_ showed that NIH-CQV represents a deeply rooted lineage between 2 groups: (i) human and animal parvoviruses and (ii) insect parvoviruses. Thus, NIH-CQV appears to be a parvovirus-like virus.\n\nHowever, NIH-CQV also has features shared by members of the _Circoviridae_ family. First, a BLASTp search revealed that the Rep of NIH-CQV is more related to circoviral Rep than to those of other viruses. Second, NIH-CQV appears to have an ambisense genome because there are bidirectional putative promoters in the intergenic region between the rep and 15-kDa protein and because rep and 15-kDa protein arranged head-to-head flank the intergenic region, which is a feature of circoviruses. Finally, sequencing and alignment of the inverse PCR products indicated the existence of the circular genome of NIH-CQV in the clinical samples. The circular form of NIH-CQV genome might represent a subviral DNA or an intermediate structure of viral replication, as reported for other parvoviruses.\n\nTherefore, NIH-CQV appears to be a 'hybrid' virus, perhaps formed by interfamilial recombination between a parvovirus and a circovirus. This idea was supported further by whole-proteome phylogenetic analysis, which showed NIH-CQV located between _Parvoviridae_ and _Circoviridae_.\n\nBoth recombination and a high mutation rate are often cited as key in evolutionary innovation. For many viruses, recombination allows single-step acquisition of multiple genetic changes, and a high mutation rate enhances adaptation to new hosts. These processes are critical driving forces in viral evolution and lead to viral emergence, host-switching, and adaptation, which often result in disease outbreaks. Recent studies had demonstrated that small eukaryotic ssDNA [single stranded DNA] viruses have high rates of nucleotide substitutions and genetic recombination, which may surpass rates seen in RNA viruses. These observations may explain the extensive diversity seen in ssDNA viruses. Parvoviruses (family _Parvoviridae_) and circoviruses (family _Circoviridae_) are both ssDNA viruses that infect a wide variety of animal species, including mammals, birds, and insects. Although horizontal gene transfer and high mutation rates have been documented in these viruses, cross-species viral transfers resulting from interfamilial recombination and leading to a infection in the new host species are not common.\n\nA high rate of viral evolution has been reported for emerging parvoviruses. Canine parvovirus (CPV) is one well-characterized example. CPV emerged from feline panleukopenia parvovirus or a closely related virus, differing at several amino acid residues. Sequences of the viruses collected at time points before and after host-switching suggest that the emergence of CPV was dependent on a high mutation rate and positive selection of the major capsid gene. Our deep-sequencing data showed that NIH-CQV has a high substitution mutation rate throughout its genome. However, the impact of selective pressures, as measured by the Ka/Ks ratio, appeared to vary depending on location. The cp gene contained three regions in which the Ka/Ks ratio exceeded 1, suggesting positive selection. These substitutions would be presumed to enhance fitness. In contrast, selective pressure on the rep of NIH-CQV appeared to be dominated by purifying selection, because the average Ka/Ks ratio for the rep from 14 patients was only 0.42. The Ka/Ks ratios for the regions encoding the PLA2 motif in the CP protein or P-loop nucleoside triphosphatase (NTPase) in the Rep proteins were lower than in other regions, as is consistent with strong purifying selection and functional importance of this region in viral replication.\n\nNIH-CQV exhibited remarkable genetic heterogeneity within patients, indicating the presence of closely related variants or quasispecies in NIH-CQV-infected individuals. The Ka/Ks ratios of both viral cp and rep were greater in patients classified as having chronic hepatitis than in those with acute hepatitis, suggesting greater variation or more diversity of quasispecies of NIH-CQV over time. For hepatitis viruses C and E, diversification of quasispecies during infection is driven by the interaction between the viruses and host immune response and may be associated with different clinical outcomes. With a limited number of serial samples from a single individual, we were unable to conclude whether quasispecies dynamics of NIH-CQV in patients correlated with disease.\n\nDespite technological advances in molecular biology, an etiology cannot be determined in as many as 20 per cent of hepatitis cases. As of yet, no causative agent may be defined in a significant proportion of patients with chronic liver disease and cirrhosis, whose disease therefore is characterized as 'cryptogenic'. Additional hepatitis agents have been suspected. Over several decades, several human viruses, such as GB virus C, Torque teno virus, and SEN virus, have been putatively claimed to be hepatitis viruses, but subsequent investigation revealed no conclusive association between these viruses and liver disease. Therefore, the etiology of non-A-E hepatitis remains unresolved. In this study, we applied NGS methodology to virus discovery and identified a parvovirus-like virus in the sera samples collected from a cohort of patients with non-A-E hepatitis. Our results showed that 28 per cent of patients were positive for both NIH-CQV-specific IgM and viral DNA, suggesting recent infection in patients. Most patients and healthy controls were positive for virus-specific IgG, suggesting that exposure was common in the population studied. The patients who yielded positive specimens suffered from symptoms of hepatitis with a wide range of liver dysfunction, including acute and chronic hepatitis. There was no difference between patients diagnosed with acute versus or chronic hepatitis with respect to detection of NIH-CQV DNA, but viral DNA was not detected in healthy controls.\n\nAlthough these findings are suggestive of an etiologic relationship, our study has limitations. By electron microscopy, we observed virus-like particles in NIH-CQV qPCR [quantitative PCR]-positive sera which cosedimented with viral DNA, but we were unable to confirm their identity by immunogold labeling with our antisera. In addition, because of the limited availability of samples, we had insufficient material for viral propagation and isolation in cell culture, and efforts are in progress to detect viral proteins in a few liver biopsy tissue blocks. Additionally, with the limited number of samples available, we cannot exclude the possibility of reactivation of a latent virus in the course of liver inflammation.\n\nIn general, parvoviruses cause systemic infection, but clinical manifestations of the infection are varied and may depend on specific tissue tropisms as well as on host immunologic competency. For 2 human pathogenic parvoviruses, B19V and HBoV, clinical symptoms range from none to acute systemic manifestations involving skin and joints to subtle persistence of infection; in immunocompromised populations, B19V chronic infection causes pure red cell aplasia. In addition, coinfection of parvoviruses with other viruses, especially related DNA viruses, can lead to synergy and more severe clinical symptoms in the affected host. Because of the complexity of disease associations, more comprehensive epidemiology and in vitro studies are needed to establish a pathogenic role of NIH-CQV in hepatitis.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail rapporteur Kunihiko Iizuka\n\n[The authors report the identification of a virus, designated NIH-CQV, in patients with non-A/B/C/D/E hepatitis.

In 2002, there were just 23 cases of hepatitis C reported to the Ross County Health District. Fast-forward to 2012, and that has increased to 172. Hepatitis C is a Class A reportable disease in Ohio. A virus that affects the liver, hepatitis C most often is spread through the blood of an infected person. Before 1992, the virus could be spread by way of blood transfusions or organ transplants. New screenings were implemented that year, and today, most hepatitis C cases are a result of dirty needles and drug use.\n\n'It's a sad, sad, sign of the times in our community,' said Kathy Wakefield, Director of Public Health Nursing at the health district. 'Hepatitis C can be fatal, but even when it's not, it requires a lifetime of medical care.' The health district's 2012 Annual Report also showed high levels of the sexually transmitted disease chlamydia were reported, with 199 cases. That's an increase of 18 from 2011.\n\nGonorrhea, with 38 reported cases, also was up from the previous few years. Hepatitis B was up by 9 cases from 23 in 2012; pertussis, or whooping cough, was down to just 3 cases last year; chicken pox was up to 19 cases compared to 11 in 2011; and there were 3 infections of E. coli reported. 'Besides the hep C numbers, there was nothing that really stood out,' Wakefield said. 'But the nearly constant increase in hep C cases is certainly a concern.'\n\nSanitarians also performed 34 inspections of tattoo and body piercing establishments, licensing 21. 'Of course needles are used in that line of work, so we need to ensure that the people doing that work are trained and educated in health and sanitization matters,' Avery said. 'After all, we know that hepatitis C is out there and we need to do our part to keep those numbers down.\n\nFurther extracts from the The Ross County Health District's 2012 Annual Report are available at\nhttp://www.rosscounty health.com.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Hepatitis C is a contagious liver disease that results from infection with hepatitis C virus. It can range in severity from a mild illness lasting a few weeks to a serious, lifelong illness. Hepatitis C virus is usually spread when blood from an infected person enters the body of a susceptible person. It is among the most common viruses that infect the liver. Hepatitis C may be transmitted through sex with an infected person or sharing of personal items contaminated with infectious blood, but these are less common. Hepatitis C is not spread through breast milk, food or water or by casual contact an infected person.\n\nAbout 75-85 percent of newly infected persons develop chronic disease and 60-70 percent of chronically infected people develop chronic liver disease; 5-20 percent develop cirrhosis and 1-5 percent die from cirrhosis or liver cancer. In 25 percent of liver cancer patients, the underlying cause is hepatitis C. There is currently no vaccine for hepatitis C; however, hepatitis C virus infection is becoming susceptible to treatment with a range of antiviral compounds.\n\nIt is unclear from this report whether this increased prevalence of hepatitis C virus infection in Ross County is directly related to tattooing and body piercing.

'There could be many reasons for the spread of the disease, including the use of [contaminated] needles and sexual intercourse, but as far as the number of people having been infected so far is concerned, we cannot conclude that these could be the only reasons. We, too, are surprised over the spread of the virus at such an alarming pace,' the CMO said. He further said 30 percent of the cases having acquired the virus have never been administered injection. 'We talked to most of the people suffering from the disease, but most of them said that they have never been injected in their lives. So, we too are surprised as to what actually led to it,' the CMO added.\n\nHe said that he along with a team of experts today [29 Jan 2013] rushed to the village to educate the people about the do's and don'ts. 'Keeping the alarming situation in consideration, we have started a campaign in the whole area to make the people aware about the precautions to be taken,' the CMO said.\n\nThough the chemists operating in the area are being blamed for the spread of the epidemic by some locals, the officials say that they have not found any evidence against the chemists which could suggest their involvement.\n\n'After the detection of several cases of hepatitis C in the village earlier this month [January 2013], a team of drug officials headed by assistant drug controller Anantnag rushed there and suspended the licenses of all the 3 medicates of the village for 10 days.

'Some cases had been detected in the area 3 years back, and the health authorities were in slumber during all these years. Now, when the epidemic has engulfed the whole village, the authorities, in order to save their necks, started putting blame on the pharmacists. If any of the pharmacists are found involved in some kind of mischief, the association will not leave it to the government but will itself burn down his shop. I can tell you with confidence that it is only an attempt to victimise the pharmacists of the village,' said president of the Pharmacist Association, Majid Majeed.\n\nVillagers have accused the authorities of leaving the entire populace of the village at the mercy of the chemists. 'The village [comprises] at least a population of 7000, but so far, the authorities have not bothered to establish even a small dispensary in the area. Last time, when their shops were closed by the authorities, we had to approach the administration for unlocking their shops as there is no other option for the patients of the area.

It is situated mostly in the Himalayan mountains. Jammu and Kashmir shares a border with the states of Himachal Pradesh and Punjab to the south and internationally with the People's Republic of China to the north and east, and the Pakistan-administered territories of Azad Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan to the west and northwest, respectively. Formerly a part of the erstwhile Princely State of Kashmir and Jammu, which governed the larger historic region of Kashmir, this territory is disputed among China, India and Pakistan. Pakistan, which claims the territory as disputed [1] refers to it alternatively as Indian-occupied Kashmir or Indian-held Kashmir, while some international agencies such as the United Nations [2] call it Indian-administered Kashmir.

The investigation revealed practices that could have exposed patients to infectious material.\n\nAccording to the OSD, the investigation of the practice of W. Scott Harrington, D.M.D. so far has found numerous violations of health and safety laws and major violations of the State Dental Act. Dental Board investigators have been assisted by agents from the Oklahoma Bureau of Narcotics and the United States Drug Enforcement Administration concerning the maintenance, control and use of drugs on the premises. The dentist and dental office voluntarily discontinued practicing upon the beginning of the investigation. The dentist is cooperating with investigators through his attorney. The State Board of Dentistry has been working very closely with the State Health Department on this investigation. The investigation is multifaceted and ongoing.\n\nPatients who had procedures at Dr. W. Scott Harrington's dental practice, located at 2111 S. Atlanta Place in Tulsa or at 12806 E. 86th Place N. in Owasso, Oklahoma, will begin to receive letters in the mail. The notification includes patients who have visited Dr. Harrington since 2007 and recommends they be tested for hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and HIV are serious medical conditions, and infected patients may not have outward symptoms of these diseases for many years. As a precaution, and in order to take appropriate steps to protect their health, it is important for these patients to get tested. It should be noted that transmission in this type of occupational setting is rare.\n\nAll testing will be done free of charge at the Tulsa Health Department's North Regional Health and Wellness Center located at 5635 N. Martin Luther King Jr. Blvd. Services will be provided on a walk-in basis starting on Sat 30 Mar 2013 from 10:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. and will resume on Mon 1 Apr 2013 from 8:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. In addition, the health department has set up a hotline at (918) 595-4500 for people with questions about this notification or hepatitis B, hepatitis C, or HIV. Patient information was only available from the past 7 years; therefore, patients who were seen by Dr. Harrington prior to 2007 may not receive a letter.

Dr. Wayne Harrington, an oral surgeon with a practice in Tulsa, Oklahoma, is being investigated by the state dental board, the state bureau of narcotics and the federal Drug Enforcement Agency because one of his patients recently tested positive for hepatitis C and HIV without known risk factors other than receiving dental treatment.\n\nUpon hearing of the infected patient, the Oklahoma Board of Dentistry conducted a surprise inspection of Harrington's practice on 18 Mar 2013, allegedly finding numerous problems, including regular use of a rusty set of instruments on patients with known infections, and the practice of pouring bleach on wounds until they 'turned white.'\n\nCalls to Harrington's office were directed to an operator, who told ABC News the clinic no longer took voice-mails. The operator said patients were being referred to another clinic but did not disclose the clinic's name.\n\nSusan Rogers, executive director of Oklahoma's Board of Dentistry, called the incident a 'perfect storm.' On top of his many violations in sanitary practice, the dentist was a Medicaid provider, which means he had a high proportion of patients with HIV or hepatitis, she said. Harrington and his staff told investigators that he treated a 'high population of known infectious disease carrier patients,' according to a complaint filed by the Oklahoma Board of Dentistry. He allegedly allowed unlicensed dental assistants to administer medication, according to the complaint. These assistants were left to decide which medications to administer and how much was appropriate. Drug cabinets were unlocked and unsupervised during the day, and Harrington did not keep an inventory log of drugs, some of which were controlled substances. One drug vial had expired in 1993.\n\n'During the inspections, Dr. Harrington referred to his staff regarding all sterilization and drug procedures in his office,' the complaint read. 'He advised, 'They take care of that. I don't.''\n\nHarrington allegedly re-used needles, contaminating drugs with potentially harmful bacteria and trace amounts of other drugs, according to the complaint. Although patient-specific drug records indicated that they were using morphine in 2012, no morphine had been ordered since 2009. The instruments for infected patients were given an extra dip in bleach in addition to normal cleaning methods, but they had red-brown rust spots, indicating that they were 'porous and cannot be properly sterilized,' according to the complaint.\n\nThe Tulsa Health Department said Harrington's patients will receive letters by mail notifying them of the risk and steps to obtain free-of-charge testing. While 7000 patients may have been exposed, Joseph Perz, an epidemiologist with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said it's 'extremely rare' to see dental transmission of HIV and hepatitis B or C. In July 2012, 8000 persons in Colorado were notified that their dentist had reused needles, potentially exposing them to the blood-borne viruses. But not a single case was identified, according to the CDC. Dental transmission is not impossible, however. Perz cited a dental fair 3 years ago in which hepatitis B was transmitted between patients. In July 2012, more than 1800 veterans who received dental care at a St. Louis VA Medical Center were warned that improper cleaning of dental tools may have exposed them to HIV and hepatitis.\n\nThe Tulsa Health Department has set up a hotline at (918) 595-4500 for people with questions.\n\n[Byline: Sydney Lupkin]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Some 7000 patients who since 2007 received treatment at a dental practice in Tulsa, Oklahoma will begin to receive letters recommending that they be tested for the presence of the blood-borne pathogens hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).

Hepatitis C virus attacks the liver, and chronic cases can result in liver damage, liver failure, liver cancer or death.\n\nThe Northern Kentucky health department is fighting back by providing testing and information about the blood-borne disease, with the state and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] keeping an eye on the region. Northern Kentucky's rate of hepatitis C was 3 times the state's in 2011 and about 10 times above that of the United States when compared to the CDC's 2010 rates. National data are not yet available for 2011.\n\nThe Independent Health Department District is taking part in a pilot program, offering free testing for anyone concerned and targeting high-risk groups. Those who test positive for the disease are provided with counseling, education and direction in how best to get care. Health officials hope they will gain a better understanding of the extent of the problem in Northern Kentucky through the testing, said Emily Gresham Wherle, spokeswoman for the NKY health department. Their findings might translate into more CDC funding for the tests and help the state get certified to do regular testing for hepatitis C for local health departments, Gresham Wherle said.\n\nA total of 23 cases of acute hepatitis C were reported in Northern Kentucky in 2010, but the number increased to 42 in 2011, according to health department records. The 1st round of free testing began in May of 2012. In September, the CDC extended the program, and by the year's end, the health department had tallied 44 cases of acute hepatitis C, officials said. Counties included in the NKY health district are Boone, Campbell, Kenton and Grant. Testing will continue at least until March [2013], when the CDC will evaluate results, said Jennifer Hunter, the health department's director of clinical services. 'Almost 88 percent (of those tested) had a history of IV drug use,' Hunter said. The program could be extended again if the CDC sees fit, she said.\n\nHepatitis C is most commonly transferred by sharing needles, syringes or other equipment used to inject drugs. Health officials believe that the heroin problem in Northern Kentucky is fueling the hepatitis C problem because users often share needles. The current high rate of new hepatitis C cases can be partially attributed to the health department's effort to identify and test high-risk people, said Dr. Lynne Saddler, district director of health. Many of those tested have been in the age group of 20-29, Hunter said, and many have come from transitional housing or treatment centers. Additionally, baby boomers have been targeted because public health departments advise that they get tested. Hepatitis C can be contracted also through needles used for tattooing, but Saddler said the licensed tattoo shops in Northern Kentucky are not a threat.\n\nThere is no vaccine for the disease, but health officials encourage testing to ensure those afflicted are treated by a physician and to prevent new cases. 'Obviously, these folks need to know what their status is and take appropriate actions in their own lives,' Saddler said. 'We all need to be sure we are reducing our risks.'\n\nThe acute hepatitis C virus infection is a short-term illness that occurs within the 1st 6 months after someone is exposed to the virus, according to the CDC.

Hepatitis C virus is transmitted through contact with the blood of an infected person. Hepatitis C is found worldwide. Hepatitis C virus is most commonly transmitted through exposure to infectious blood. This can occur through: receipt of contaminated blood transfusions, blood products and organ transplants; injections given with contaminated syringes and needle-stick injuries in health-care settings; injection drug use; being born to a hepatitis C-infected mother. Hepatitis C may be transmitted also through sex with an infected person or sharing of personal items contaminated with infectious blood, but these are less common. Hepatitis C is not spread through breast milk, food or water or by casual contact and sharing food or drinks with an infected person.\n\nThere is no vaccine but but treatments are becoming available which enhances the desirability of early diagnosis of infection. There are 6 genotypes of hepatitis C virus and they may respond differently to treatment. Careful screening is necessary before starting treatment to determine the most appropriate approach for the patient.\n\nCombination antiviral therapy with interferon and ribavirin has been the mainstay of hepatitis C treatment. Unfortunately, interferon is not widely available globally, it is not always well tolerated, some virus genotypes respond better to interferon than others, and many people who take interferon do not finish their treatment. This means that while hepatitis C is generally considered to be a curable disease, for many people this is not a reality. Two new therapeutic agents, telaprevir and boceprevir, have recently been licensed in some countries. There are 6 genotypes of hepatitis C virus which respond differently to treatment. Therefore careful screening is necessary before initiating treatment. Avoiding infection remains the best option.\n\nThe interactive ProMED-mail/HealthMap of Kentucky can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/r/37gm. - Mod.CP]", "summary": "There are potential long-term consequences associated with ongoing hepatitis C infection, so the goal is to eliminate the active virus as soon as possible.'\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Hepatitis C disease can range in severity from a mild illness lasting a few weeks to a serious, lifelong condition that can lead to cirrhosis of the liver or liver cancer.

In September, the CDC extended the program, and by the year's end, the health department had tallied 44 cases of acute hepatitis C, officials said. \n\nA total of 23 cases of acute hepatitis C were reported in Northern Kentucky in 2010, but the number increased to 42 in 2011, according to health department records. \n\nThe acute hepatitis C virus infection is a short-term illness that occurs within the 1st 6 months after someone is exposed to the virus, according to the CDC. Health officials hope they will gain a better understanding of the extent of the problem in Northern Kentucky through the testing, said Emily Gresham Wherle, spokeswoman for the NKY health department. ----------------------------\nHepatitis C is plaguing Northern Kentucky (NKY), where the rate of people infected is far higher than the state or national rate, and the region's heroin epidemic is cited as the likely cause. Their findings might translate into more CDC funding for the tests and help the state get certified to do regular testing for hepatitis C for local health departments, Gresham Wherle said. \n\nThere is no vaccine for the disease, but health officials encourage testing to ensure those afflicted are treated by a physician and to prevent new cases. ' Those who suffer from hepatitis C can be asymptomatic, but they need to get a physician's care, health officials said. ' The Northern Kentucky health department is fighting back by providing testing and information about the blood-borne disease, with the state and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] keeping an eye on the region.

All of these new patients were believed to have come in contact with the suspect while being treated at Johns Hopkins Hospital.\n\nFormer traveling medical technician David Kwiatkowski is accused of infecting dozens of patients in several states with the deadly hepatitis C virus. Federal prosecutors say Kwiatkowski, who has the disease, used syringes to inject himself and then later used those syringes on patients.\n\n'I have my ups and downs. Some of it is mentally, thinking about why this guy would have done this to me or anyone else,' said a patient [LN] who crossed paths with Kwiatkowski in 2008, while at the VA Hospital in Baltimore. 'How does a contract worker come in and not be tested? They could have very well gone out on the street corner and asked someone to give me a needle that was tainted,' [LN] said.\n\nNow the Maryland Department of Health says 4 more people have turned up positive, this time from Johns Hopkins Hospital, where Kwaitkowski worked as a temporary employee from July 2009 until January 2010.

David Kwiatkowski, whom prosecutors have called a 'serial infector', is charged with stealing painkillers from New Hampshire's Exeter Hospital and replacing them with saline-filled syringes tainted with his own blood. He pleaded not guilty earlier this month [December 2012] to 14 federal drug charges and has been in jail since his arrest in July [2012].\n\nA total of 32 New Hampshire patients have tested positive for the same strain of the liver-destroying disease [hepatitis C] that Kwiatkowski carries, and a dozen other cases have emerged in some of the 18 hospitals in 7 states where he previously worked.\n\nMaryland health officials announced 4 new cases on Friday [21 Dec 2012], all involving patients at The Johns Hopkins Hospital, where Kwiatkowski worked from July 2009 to January 2010 [see item [1] above}. The previously reported cases include one from the Baltimore VA Medical Center and 6 from Hays Medical Center in Kansas. Another case has been confirmed at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center [UPMC] in Pennsylvania, a hospital spokeswoman told The Associated Press this week.\n\nOver the years, Kwiatkowski was fired twice over allegations of drug use and theft, including from UPMC, where he was just a few weeks into his temporary stint when a co-worker accused him of swiping a fentanyl syringe from an operating room and sticking it down his pants. Citing a lack of evidence, hospital authorities didn't call police, and neither the hospital nor the medical staffing agency that placed him in the job informed the national accreditation organization for radiological technicians.\n\nIn Maryland, the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene said on Friday [21 Dec 2012] that no drug diversion allegations involving Kwiatkowski were reported to the agency during his time there, but the 5 linked cases adds to the concern that such activity took place.

A physician with the Victorian Infectious Diseases Service, Benjamin Cowie, said liver cancer cases were expected to double to about 2500 a year if more was not done to tackle the underlying causes. Hepatitis B and C virus infections were the primary causes of liver cancer, with hepatitis B the most significant single cause of cancer worldwide, after tobacco, Dr Cowie said.\n\nHepatitis B affected about 200 000 Australians, most of them Aboriginal or born overseas in countries where there was an epidemic. Hepatitis C affected about\n230 000 Australians and was most commonly caused by drug users sharing needles. Dr Cowie is among a group of experts to use a viral hepatitis conference in New Zealand today [10 Sep 2012] to urge governments and health professionals to set new targets for the number of people receiving treatment.\n\n'A substantial scaling up of resources and efforts is needed to stop these epidemics in their tracks,' the experts said. 'Otherwise liver cancer will continue to be among the fastest increasing causes of cancer death in Australia and New Zealand.' Targets include ensuring that at least 80 per cent of people with hepatitis B or C are diagnosed and that 5 per cent of people with hepatitis C and 10 per cent of those with hepatitis B receive antiviral treatment every year. It is estimated that one in 3 people with hepatitis B and one in 4 with hepatitis C are undiagnosed. They may not have symptoms of the disease, but without treatment, their condition can progress to liver cancer or liver failure.\n\nOnly 2 per cent of Australians who have hepatitis C and 3 per cent with hepatitis B receive medical treatment. Dr Cowie said part of the problem was long waiting lists. 'If you are living with hepatitis B and have undiagnosed cirrhosis and wait for a year to be seen, you have a 2 to 3 per cent chance of getting liver cancer. From a human rights perspective, I think that is unacceptable in rich societies like Australia and New Zealand.'\n\nExperts said new drugs to treat hepatitis C offered improved efficacy and had less toxicity. 'We need to be exploring not just sending people to hospital and waiting for liver clinics but getting these treatments into the community, and that means supporting general practitioners and nurses to take a greater role,' Dr Cowie said before today's [10 Sep 2012] 8th Australasian Viral Hepatitis Conference 2012. More than 10 000 Australians and New Zealanders are diagnosed with hepatitis C each year and 7000 with hepatitis B. The 'Auckland statement' calls for new hepatitis C infections to be halved by 2016, including by introducing needle and syringe programs in prisons, where the transmission rate for infection is of concern.\n\n[Byline: Kate Hagan]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Hepatitis B is a potentially life-threatening liver infection caused by hepatitis B virus. It is a major global health problem and the most serious type of viral hepatitis. It can cause chronic liver disease and puts people at high risk of death from cirrhosis of the liver and liver cancer. Hepatitis B virus is transmitted between people by direct blood-to-blood contact or semen and vaginal fluid of an infected person. Modes of transmission are the same as those for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), but the hepatitis B virus is 50 to 100 times more infectious. Unlike HIV, the hepatitis B virus can survive outside the body for at least 7 days. During this time, the virus can still cause infection if it enters the body of a person who is not protected by the vaccine. A vaccine against hepatitis B has been available since 1982. Hepatitis B vaccine is 95 percent effective in preventing infection and its chronic consequences and is the 1st vaccine against a major human cancer.\n\nStrangely, immunisation is not mentioned in the above report as one of the measures that might be deployed in the fight against liver cancer.\n\nHepatitis C is a contagious liver disease that results from infection with hepatitis C virus. It can range in severity from a mild illness lasting a few weeks to a serious, lifelong illness. Hepatitis C virus is usually spread when blood from an infected person enters the body of a susceptible person. It is among the most common viruses that infect the liver. Hepatitis C may be transmitted through sex with an infected person or sharing of personal items contaminated with infectious blood, but these are less common. Hepatitis C is not spread through breast milk, food or water. Diagnosis of acute infection is often missed because a majority of infected people have no symptoms. Specialized tests are needed to evaluate patients for liver disease, including cirrhosis and liver cancer. Hepatitis C does not always require treatment. There are 6 genotypes of hepatitis C, and they respond differently to treatment. However, combination therapy with interferon and several new drugs are proving successful with some types of hepatitis C. There is no vaccine available at present. - Mod.CP\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/r/1z_*.]", "summary": "Targets include ensuring that at least 80 per cent of people with hepatitis B or C are diagnosed and that 5 per cent of people with hepatitis C and 10 per cent of those with hepatitis B receive antiviral treatment every year.

Hepatitis C virus infections in the Swiss HIV Cohort Study: a rapidly evolving epidemic. Clin Infect Dis, online edition, 2012]. Half of all infections in gay men occurred between 2008 and 2011. In contrast, incidence of hepatitis C fell in HIV-positive injecting drug users and remained stable in HIV-positive heterosexuals.\n\n'We found that the yearly incidence rate had decreased in IDU [injecting drug users], remained stable in HET [heterosexuals] and dramatically increased in MSM [men who have sex with men],' write the authors. 'In MSM, a history of inconsistent condom use and a past episode of syphilis were significantly associated with HCV [hepatitis C virus] seroconversion.'\n\nLiver disease caused by hepatitis C is now a major cause of serious illness and death in people with HIV. For many years, hepatitis C co-infection almost exclusively occurred in injecting drug users and recipients of blood products. However, over the past decade, there have been outbreaks of sexually transmitted hepatitis C in HIV-positive gay men. These infections have been linked to unprotected sex, traumatic mucosal activities such as fisting, and have also occurred within sexual networks. Such an outbreak has been observed among HIV-positive gay men in Zurich.\n\nInvestigators from the Swiss HIV Cohort Study wished to establish a better understanding of the wider dynamics of hepatitis C epidemiology in the HIV-positive people in their care. They, therefore, examined incidence of the infection in 3 risk groups: gay men, injecting drug users and heterosexuals. Incidence rates were monitored over a 13-year period, between 1998 and 2011. The investigators also examined whether any risk factors for incident hepatitis C infections in gay men could be identified.\n\nA total of 12 000 people were included in the study. Prevalence of hepatitis C co-infection at baseline was 3 percent for gay men, 92 percent for injecting drug users and 11 percent for heterosexuals. A total of 3333 gay men were then included in the prospective analysis, as were 123 injecting drug users and 3078 heterosexuals. During follow-up, 3 percent of gay men became infected with hepatitis C, as did 1/3rd of injecting drug users and one percent of heterosexuals. The dynamics of the hepatitis C epidemic differed between risk groups. In gay men, incidence increased from 0.23 per 100 person years in 1998 to 4.09 per 100 person years in 2011. In all, 51 of the 101 infections observed over the entire study period occurred between 2008 and 2011. 'Clinicians and patients should be aware of the risk of acute HCV infections in MSM,' write the researchers. 'Intensified prevention and counselling should be performed.'\n\nIn contrast, incidence among injecting drug users declined from 13.89 per 100 person years in 1998 to 2.24 per 100 person years in 2011. Only 3 infections in this group were recorded between 2008 and 2011.\n\n'Switzerland's long-term heroin prescription programme likely contributed to the decreasing incidence of HCV seroconversion in this population,' comment the investigators. Incidence in heterosexuals was low at approximately 0.5 per 100 person years across the study period. The investigators speculate that many of these infections may in fact be due to either undisclosed injecting drug use or due to sex between men.

They, therefore, examined incidence of the infection in 3 risk groups: gay men, injecting drug users and heterosexuals. In contrast, incidence of hepatitis C fell in HIV-positive injecting drug users and remained stable in HIV-positive heterosexuals. In gay men, incidence increased from 0.23 per 100 person years in 1998 to 4.09 per 100 person years in 2011. A total of 3333 gay men were then included in the prospective analysis, as were 123 injecting drug users and 3078 heterosexuals.

The unexpectedly high incidence of HCV in HIV-infected MSM patients, compared to its decline in injecting drug users, is striking and difficult to explain. However, over the past decade, there have been outbreaks of sexually transmitted hepatitis C in HIV-positive gay men. It is crucial that HIV-infected MSM are counseled with regard to the risk of sexual activities that involve traumatic mucosal sex, and that condoms are consistently used in sexual risk situations,' conclude the investigators. ' A similar European report described substantial increases, particularly during 2002-2007, in the incidence of HCV infection among HIV-infected MSM, demonstrating just how serious the epidemic had become among these men. Half of all infections in gay men occurred between 2008 and 2011. Incidence in heterosexuals was low at approximately 0.5 per 100 person years across the study period. Hepatitis C virus infections in the Swiss HIV Cohort Study: a rapidly evolving epidemic. It is interesting that in the Swiss study, injecting drug users are ranked as more responsible citizens than MSM practitioners. In MSM, a history of inconsistent condom use and a past episode of syphilis were significantly associated with HCV [hepatitis C virus] seroconversion.' \n\n'Switzerland's long-term heroin prescription programme likely contributed to the decreasing incidence of HCV seroconversion in this population,' comment the investigators. Incident hepatitis C infection was also associated with a previous syphilis diagnosis (aHR = 2.01; 95 percent CI, 1.39-3.20).

It can range in severity from a mild illness lasting a few weeks to a serious, lifelong illness. Hepatitis C virus is usually spread when blood from an infected person enters the body of a susceptible person. It is among the most common viruses that infect the liver. Hepatitis C is found worldwide. Countries with high rates of chronic infection are Egypt, Pakistan and and China.\n\nHepatitis C virus is most commonly transmitted through exposure to infectious blood. This can occur through receipt of contaminated blood transfusions, blood products and organ transplants; injections given with contaminated syringes and needle-stick injuries in health-care settings; and being born to a hepatitis C-infected mother. Hepatitis C may be transmitted through sex with an infected person or sharing of personal items contaminated with infectious blood. Hepatitis C is not spread through breast milk, food or water or by casual contact.\n\nIt is unclear why the incidence of hepatitis C appears to be high in the Indian state of Punjab. Treatments for hepatitis C virus infection are becoming available, but remain beyond the resources of most countries with large populations.

Former and current injecting drugs users and people who received a blood transfusion before September 1991 are most at risk. Petra Wright, Scottish Officer for the UK charity, told The Courier: 'The introduction of dried blood testing by NHS Tayside in 2009 means that access to testing has never been easier. NHS Tayside now delivers testing for all bloodborne viruses in 12 centres across Tayside. This initiative has seen the number of new diagnoses increase by 77 percent -- from 245 in 2007-2009 to 435 in 2009-2011 -- bringing the total for the area to 2432. This represents around half of those believed to be infected in Tayside and it is vital that those who may have been at risk in the past come forward to be tested before drug therapy is no longer an option.'\n\nIt's thought that up to 5000 people in Tayside are infected with the virus. Ms Wright added: 'In the last year, new drug treatment therapies have been introduced which will significantly increase the number of patients being cured. If you don't know that you have it, you can't take steps to be cured or put in place simple lifestyle changes, such as reducing alcohol intake, cutting down on smoking and improving your diet, all of which can make a significant difference to the health of someone with Hepatitis C.'\n\nHepatitis C is a bloodborne virus that predominantly infects the cells of the liver. If left untreated, the virus can cause cirrhosis, liver cancer and death. There is no vaccine, but early treatment can successfully clear the virus in the majority of patients, and ongoing infection can be managed.\n\nThe Hepatitis C Trust's outreach and testing van is to tour a number of locations across Scotland in a bid to reach people who may not have access to the service otherwise. Organised with the support of the Scottish government and in collaboration with local health services and community groups, the aim is to offer information and testing to people who might not realise they are at risk. On Monday [10 Sep 2012], the van will visit Morrisons [supermarket] in Arbroath to provide education and testing specifically designed for Central and Eastern European immigrant populations living in the area.\n\n[Byline: Graeme Strachan]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap alerts\n<promed@promedmil.org>\n\n[Hepatitis C is a contagious liver disease that results from infection with hepatitis C virus.

Kansas officials notified more than 400 people last month [July 2012] that they may have been exposed to hepatitis C [virus infection] by a technician who worked at the Hays Medical Center's cardiac catheterization lab from 24 May to 22 Sep 2010.\n\nThe technician, David Kwiatkowski, is accused of causing an outbreak of the disease at Exeter Hospital [New Hampshire]. Authorities believe he stole anaesthetic drugs from a hospital lab, injected himself and contaminated syringes that were later used on patients. To date, Kwiatkowski and 32 former Exeter Hospital patients have been linked with the outbreak. New Hampshire health officials are in the process of testing an additional 3300 patients who were treated in areas where Kwiatkowski was granted limited access. Kwiatkowski's arrest touched off a widespread investigation into his employment history, which includes stints in at least 19 hospitals in 8 states. He was fired from at least 2 of those hospitals.\n\nThe Kansas Department of Health and Environment (KDHE) said Tue 28 Aug 2012 that 375 former Hays Medical patients had submitted blood for testing as of 27 Aug 2012. Of that number, 353 were negative for hepatitis C. Tests on the others are pending. Another 58 patients could not be tested because they are already deceased.

According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), 12 million Pakistanis are infected with hepatitis, the major causes for the spread of which include frequent use of\ntherapeutic injections, re-use of syringes, inappropriate sterilisation practices and poor hospital waste management.\n\nIn Pakistan, many patients have lost their lives at the hands of quacks, who are known for mismanagement of hepatitis. 'Pakistan needs to institute strictest possible laws to end quackery so that unwary patients don't end up losing their lives. Mismanagement of hepatitis B and C can lead to liver cancer. It is, therefore critical that only qualified specialists be consulted for treatment,' Dr. Tashfeen Adam, head of the department of gastroenterology at the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (PIMS) stated on the eve of World Hepatitis Day here on Friday [27 Jul 2012]. He said, there has been a 25% increase in the number of hepatitis patients reporting this year, as compared to last year, and attributed the same to rising public awareness.\n\nSharing relevant data, PIMS spokesman Dr. Waseem Khwaja disclosed that between 350 to 400 patients suffering from various digestive diseases are treated in the Out-Patient Department of Gastroenterology at PIMS every day. Sixty percent of these patients are diagnosed with hepatitis, and 2% new cases are diagnosed while screening of surgical cases. Moreover, 2300patients have been admitted and treated for complications of hepatitis like bleeding, drowsiness, infections and coma, since January 1, 2012, and five percent of the hospital's emergency is occupied by patients suffering from complications of hepatitis.\n\nDr. Waseem said, 3500 patients of hepatitis C are receiving free interferon therapy from Zakat and Pakistan Baitul-Mal funds at PIMS. Two types of free interferon injections are being provided to hepatitis C patients. The executive director of PIMS Dr. Mehmood Jamal also stressed the need for patients to consult qualified doctors for treatment of hepatitis.\n\nResearch by WHO shows that hepatitis can be acute or chronic, and may result in serious complications or even death. Viral hepatitis affects 1 in every 12 people worldwide. It affects those close to them too. Around 500 million people worldwide are chronically infected with two types of blood-borne hepatitis: hepatitis B and C. Approximately 1 million people die each year from related complications, most commonly from liver diseases including liver cancer.\n\nIn the Eastern Mediterranean Region, 17 million people are living today with hepatitis C infection, and approximately 4.3 million people are infected with hepatitis B infection every year.\n\nThe key message of World Hepatitis Day is that hepatitis is preventable. Everyone can get this disease, yet it rarely affects those who consciously guard against it. Hepatitis is caused by a group of viruses that infect the liver through either consumption of contaminated food and water or exposure to unsafe blood and infected body fluids.\n\nEveryone has a role to confront hepatitis. At the community and individual level, certain behavioral practices increase the risk of these infections substantially, for example reuse of razor blades and injection syringes, by traditional healers and tattooists and harmful behaviors such as sharing needles and drug abuse. Provision of safe food and water would greatly prevent hepatitis A and E. Within health facilities, screening of blood and blood products, safe injection practices and clean dental work can significantly reduce the risk of infection from hepatitis B and C.\n\nOn the occasion of World Hepatitis Day, WHO's Regional Director for the Eastern Mediterranean Dr. Ala Alwan has urged policy-makers, civil society, and health professionals to combine efforts to confront this silent epidemic. In a message, Dr. Alwan has drawn attention to the fact that the chronic nature of hepatitis B and C infection calls for strong focus on screening, care and treatment. 'With early detection and appropriate management, it is possible to change the quality of life of millions of people who are living with this disease,' he has stressed.\n\n(By Shahina Maqbool)\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from Health Map alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n\n[Viral hepatitis is the leading cause of liver cancer and cirrhosis worldwide.

Any former dental or oral surgery patients of Dr. Stephen Stein's who have not been tested and who remember receiving intravenous medications, including sedation, at one of his offices, are encouraged to get tested.\n\nThe Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment [CDPHE], which has urged more than 8000 former patients of Dr. Stephen Stein to seek testing for the three diseases, said that in order to protect patient confidentiality, it would not disclose which of the specific infections the patients have. Stein, who had a practice at 8671 S. Quebec St. in Highlands Ranch from September 1999 until June 2011, also saw patients at New Image Dental in Cherry Creek between August 2010 and June 2011.\n\nStein made an agreement with the Colorado State Board of Dental Examiners to cease practicing in June 2011 after the health department concluded its investigation. Because he is no longer practicing, the state does not see Stein as a current threat and has stated that it will not conduct its own testing of him in an effort to match genetic material [of the contaminating viruses] of the infected patients with his. Hollynd Hoskins, a Denver attorney who is representing some of Stein's\nformer patients, called it a public health issue and said that Stein's patients have 'an absolute right to know if Dr. Stein himself was infected with any of these diseases.'\n\nReferring to the Rose Medical Center case where operating room technician Kristen Parker infected at least 18 patients with hepatitis C in 2008-09, Hoskins said that ruling out whether Stein is carrying any of these diseases should be the first step. 'Dr. Stein should be asked to comply with voluntary testing by the CDPHE as well as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDCP],' she said. 'I would also hope that law enforcement agencies such as the Denver Police Department or U.S. Attorney's Office would ask for that voluntary testing for the public health issue of all of these patients. If that is not successful, I would hope one of the agencies would seek a court order.'\n\nHoskins said she assumed that the CDCP and CDPHE are already conducting an investigation similar to what they did with the Rose hepatitis C outbreak, in order to reach an opinion about whether there is a causal link between the patients who have tested positive for infectious diseases, and about the likelihood that the infection occurred during their treatment at Stein's office. 'It's a pretty high probability that they contracted these diseases from Dr. Stein's office, merely from what we know now from his unsafe injection practices,' she said, adding that if they were not infected from Stein directly, it is likely that diseases were contacted via patient-patient transmission.\n\nAccording to a statement from the CDPHE, it cannot be determined that the positive results are necessarily linked to Stein's practice, due to 'the time frame and potential for infections from other source.'\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail correspondent Susan Baekeland\n\n[This report is posted as a public service to help reach more of Dr Stephen Stein's former 8000 patients.

David Kwiatkowski is being held on federal drug charges in New Hampshire, and authorities are trying to determine whether he spread the virus elsewhere. The 33-year-old is accused of stealing anesthetic drugs from the cardiac catheterization lab and contaminating syringes used on patients at Exeter Hospital [New Hampshire].\n\nHouston Medical Center in Warner Robins says Kwiatkowski worked there between 26 Oct 2010 to 17 Mar 2011.

The new annual report is the 4th for the UK as a whole (the 7th for England). The main chapters describe, in turn, the scale of the UK problem; prevention; diagnosis, testing and awareness of infection; and treatment and care in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, respectively. Consolidated data for the UK as a whole are also presented as well as testing and diagnosis data related to particular groups (people who inject drugs, prison populations, black and minority ethnic populations and blood donors).\n\nData are presented to show how action plans and work programmes have driven improvements in the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of hepatitis C across the UK. However, they also show that morbidity and mortality from hepatitis C-related liver disease are still increasing. In particular, hospital admissions for HCV-related end stage liver disease and liver cancer, transplants and deaths continue to rise. By 2020, the report estimates that approximately 16 000 people will be living with either HCV-related cirrhosis or liver cancer in England if they are left untreated.\n\nAs in previous HPA reports on HCV, the high prevalence of infection in particular groups is shown to be a key characteristic of the disease in the UK: injecting drug users (IDUs) are at greatest risk of acquiring infection and some minority ethnic populations also have higher rates of infection than the white, UK-born population.\n\nReferences\n----------\n1.

'Injecting drugs with unsterile injecting equipment, particularly needles and syringes, can put people at risk of infection, even if they injected only once or twice in the past. Others at risk of hepatitis C include those who have received blood transfusions before September 1991 or blood products before 1986 in the UK. People who originate from countries where hepatitis C is endemic, such as South Asia, are also at risk -- often following medical or dental treatment with unsterile equipment.'\n\n'New drugs are now available that can help clear the most difficult to treat strain of the virus in most people.

More syringes were found in his pockets and locker. A drug test showed he had fentanyl and other opiates in his system. In what may be the scariest part of all, authorities say that when he swiped the fentanyl syringe, he left another one in its place, filled with a dummy fluid, ready to be used on a patient.\n\nBut Kwiatkowski did not go to jail. No one in Pittsburgh even called the police. Neither the hospital nor the medical staffing agency that placed him in the job informed the national accreditation organization for radiological technicians. So just days after being fired, he was able to start a new job at a Baltimore hospital. And from there, he went from one hospital to another -- 10 hospitals altogether in the 4 years after he was fired in Pittsburgh. All of them told The Associated Press they had no knowledge of his disciplinary history when they hired him for temporary jobs. The potentially grave cost of those loopholes became clear only after Kwiatkowski's arrest last month [July 2012] in New Hampshire, where he stands accused of infecting at least 31 Exeter Hospital patients with hepatitis C by stealing fentanyl syringes and replacing them with dirty ones tainted with his blood.\n\nNow, thousands of hospital patients who may have crossed paths with the technician in 8 states -- Arizona, Georgia, Kansas, Maryland, Michigan, New Hampshire, New York, and Pennsylvania -- are being tested to see if they, too, are infected with hepatitis C, a sometimes life-threatening virus that can destroy the liver and cause cancer.\n\nAs the Kwiatkowski case demonstrates, medical technicians aren't as closely regulated as doctors or nurses, and there is no nationwide database of misconduct or disciplinary actions against them, the way there is for physicians. 'It seems that what happens in Pittsburgh stays in Pittsburgh,' said Barbara Yeninas, a spokeswoman for Springboard Healthcare Staffing and Search, one of at least 7 medical staffing agencies that lined up jobs for [the technician]. 'They get hired and they get fired and they can move on to wherever else they want.'\n\nAs Kwiatkowski made his way from one institution to another, the Pittsburgh incident was not even the only time he was accused of stealing drugs and fired. People involved in a 2010 incident at Arizona Heart Hospital tell a different story. Kwiatkowski was 10 days into a job assignment when a co-worker found him passed out in a bathroom stall. A stolen syringe, bearing a label for fentanyl, floated in the toilet. In the emergency room, he tested positive for both cocaine and marijuana. This time police were summoned, but the officers decided not to file charges or even write up a report after being told that Kwiatkowski had flushed the syringe. 'We had no evidence. We had nothing except what they told us,' said Phoenix officer James Holmes, a police spokesman. Hospital officials alerted Springboard, which had gotten Kwiatkowski the assignment in Arizona, and also informed the Arizona Medical Radiologic Board of Examiners, which took steps to revoke his license. Springboard also sent a report to the American Registry of Radiologic Technologists [ARRT], the organization that 37 states rely on to verify that technicians have proper credentials. But after learning police hadn't filed charges, the national accreditation group dropped its inquiry without ever speaking to anyone at the hospital or the state licensing board, said a spokesman, Christopher Cook.\n\nJust days after Kwiatkowski's firing, he landed a new job filling in for striking technicians at Temple University Hospital in Philadelphia. He faxed a handwritten note to Arizona licensing officials from a Philadelphia airport hotel saying he would surrender his license rather than fight the accusations. If Kwiatkowski had been a doctor, that loss of his Arizona license would have jeopardized his ability to work anywhere in the US. But in this case, he had nothing to worry about. Like many other states, Pennsylvania doesn't require most radiological technicians to be registered and doesn't maintain records of disciplinary actions against them. He soon moved on to other hospitals, including Hays Medical Center in Hays, Kansas, where he worked in the heart catheterization lab and was involved in the care of 460 patients who are now undergoing testing for hepatitis C.\n\nHospitals and the staffing agencies that routinely help them fill jobs are supposed to share responsibility for verifying that workers have proper licensing and good reputations. But 4 of the states where DK worked over the full course of his career -- New Hampshire, Georgia, Pennsylvania, and Michigan -- don't even license radiology workers. The institutions that allowed Kwiatkowski to keep working offered a variety of excuses and explanations as to how he slipped by various background checks and managed to get licensed in other states. University of Pittsburgh Medical Center spokeswoman Gloria Kreps said that when he was accused of stealing fentanyl, officials did not contact police because they did not believe they had enough evidence. 'We noticed unusual behavior, caught him with a syringe, but did not witness him in the act of committing a crime,' she said. They didn't alert the national credentialing organization, she said, because they felt that was the responsibility of Maxim Staffing Solutions, the agency that had placed him. Officials at the staffing agency's parent company did not return calls for comment.\n\nMatt Price, chief executive of Advantage RN, the staffing agency that got Kwiatkowski the position in Philadelphia, said his stint in Phoenix was so short that it was easy for him to hide that he ever worked there. And because of the need to find strike-replacement workers fast, Temple asked the company to verify only the last 2 jobs held by each applicant. So even though Kwiatkowski listed his Pittsburgh job on his resume, no one called the hospital for a reference.\n\nIn Kansas, which in 2010 became the last state to license him, the Board of Healing Arts verified his education, national certification, and other state licenses, but not his work history, said the agency's lawyer, Kelli Stevens. In the section of his application detailing previous jobs, he left out 9 hospitals, including the 2 that fired him for suspected drug abuse. He answered 'no' to a long list of questions about misconduct, saying he had never been disciplined or used illegal drugs. He also asked the state to waive its requirement that he send a photocopy of his American Registry of Radiologic Technologists identification card. He claimed that his wallet had recently been stolen and complained in a rambling email about having trouble getting a school he attended to send proof of his degree.\n\nCook, the spokesman for the American Registry of Radiologic Technologists, said Kwiatkowski's case underscores the need for a national database of disciplinary actions. The agency has about 315 000 technicians registered with it. It handles about 3000 complaints per year. Last year [2011], it issued 222 public sanctions for misconduct that ranged from criminal convictions to failure to follow professional standards. 'If ARRT had more access to information held by state agencies, employers, and others, we believe this number would be higher,' Cook said.\n\nThings finally began to unravel for Kwiatkowski in New Hampshire, where a temporary stint at Exeter Hospital starting in April 2011 turned into a permanent job in a cardiac catheterization lab. A co-worker complained that she saw Kwiatkowski acting strangely and sweating, with bloodshot eyes. He was sent home after saying his aunt had died. Another co-worker said he once saw him with white foam around his mouth. Others told of him shaking, sweating through his scrubs, and frequently running off sick to the bathroom, sometimes in the middle of a procedure. A patient's relative discovered a fentanyl syringe in a public bathroom. In April [2012], Kwiatkowski was charged with leaving the scene of an accident after he backed into a car and drove away.\n\nIn May [2012], 3 doctors simultaneously reported that patients recently treated in the catheterization lab had tested positive for hepatitis C. Within days, Kwiatkowski was also identified as having hepatitis C, and he was suspended as the state began investigating. In July [2012], police in Massachusetts said they found him intoxicated in a hotel room with a suicide note. He was arrested soon after.\n\nLaboratory testing found that 31 patients had a strain of the hepatitis C virus matching the one Kwiatkowski carried, health authorities said. It isn't clear when he contracted hepatitis C. Prosecutors said in court papers that they have evidence he tested positive at least as far back as 2010. Michigan officials said he tested negative in 2006. His license in New York is still listed on a state website as active and in good standing.\n\n[byline: David B Caruso, Holly Ramer]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[A sad and tragic affair now brought to a conclusion.

The federal probe also involves the FBI. Officials at the U.S. attorney's office said the case is still under investigation but didn't provide any further comment.

Only 10 percent to 20 percent of hepatitis cases are detected, said Rino Gani, head of the Indonesia Liver Research Association (PPHI). 'Not everyone knows about the status of their infection and not everyone has had themselves examined,' Rino said at a news conference ahead of World Hepatitis Day on 28 Jul 2012. Hepatitis takes a long time to show symptoms, but the disease can cause liver cirrhosis and cancer, Rino said. 'The damage only becomes known when it is already too late and not much can be done,' Rino said. One of the problems is money, Rino said. Tests and treatment are only affordable for a small segment of society. Another is stigma. People who know they are infected often do not seek out treatment because they do not want people to know about their condition. Since the disease does not cause them pain, they are able to ignore it.\n\nAccording to H.M. Subuh, a director at the Health Ministry, rapid detection tests cost between Rp 30 000 [USD 3.18] and Rp 50 000 [5.29], and more sophisticated tests cost Rp 100 000 to Rp 150 000. [One USD approximates to 9445 Indonesian Rupiah]. 'The problem is that after someone is declared hepatitis B or C positive, another series of tests have to be undergone and the costs is about Rp 2 million [USD 211.75] and has to be done repeatedly before being eligible for therapy' which can cost tens or hundreds of millions of rupiah, he said. The government's Jamkesmas health insurance scheme covers treatment for poor people, he added. Rino said an alternative to expensive therapies was needed. He praised a partnership between the University of Indonesia and the University of Kobe in Japan to develop an herbal-based cure for hepatitis C.\n\nA 2007 Health Ministry study found that 9.4 percent of Indonesians, or about 30 million people, were positive for hepatitis B or C. Globally, 170 million people are infected, and the disease[s] causes 1.5 million deaths annually. Several groups are especially vulnerable to hepatitis, including health workers, intravenous drug users and children whose mothers are infected, Rino said. Soldiers also carry a high risk of infection because of bleeding during exercise or sharing razors. Unsterile tattooing can also spread hepatitis.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Hepatitis B is a potentially life-threatening liver infection caused by the hepatitis B virus. It is a major global health problem and the most serious type of viral hepatitis. It can cause chronic liver disease and puts people at high risk of death from cirrhosis of the liver and liver cancer. Worldwide, an estimated 2 billion people have been infected with the hepatitis B virus and more than 240 million have chronic (long-term) liver infections. About 600 000 people die every year due to the acute or chronic consequences of hepatitis. Hepatitis B virus is transmitted between people by direct blood-to-blood contact or semen and vaginal fluid of an infected person. Modes of transmission are the same as those for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), but the hepatitis B virus is 50 to 100 times more infectious. Unlike HIV, the hepatitis B virus can survive outside the body for at least 7 days. During this time, the virus can still cause infection if it enters the body of a person who is not protected by the vaccine. A vaccine against hepatitis B has been available since 1982. Hepatitis B vaccine is 95 percent effective in preventing infection and its chronic consequences, and is the 1st vaccine against a major human cancer. (For more detailed information, see http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs204/en/index.html).\n\nHepatitis C is a contagious liver disease that results from infection with the hepatitis C virus. It can range in severity from a mild illness lasting a few weeks to a serious, lifelong illness. Hepatitis C virus is usually spread when blood from an infected person enters the body of a susceptible person. It is among the most common viruses that infect the liver. Every year, 3-4 million people are infected with the hepatitis C virus. About 150 million people are chronically infected and at risk of developing liver cirrhosis and/or liver cancer. More than 350 000 people die from hepatitis C-related liver diseases every year. Hepatitis C may be transmitted through sex with an infected person or sharing of personal items contaminated with infectious blood, but these are less common. Hepatitis C is not spread through breast milk, food or water or by casual contact such as hugging, kissing and sharing food or drinks with an infected person. There is no generally available vaccine for prevention of hepatitis C virus infection. However antiviral drugs are becoming available which are effective in the treatment of hepatitis caused by some strains of hepatitis C virus. (For more detailed information, see: http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs164/en/index.html).\n\nThe World Health Organisation also organizes World Hepatitis Day on 28 July every year to increase awareness and understanding of viral hepatitis.\n\nThe interactive HealthMap of indonesia can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/r/01dp. - Mod.CP]", "summary": "He praised a partnership between the University of Indonesia and the University of Kobe in Japan to develop an herbal-based cure for hepatitis C.\n\nA 2007 Health Ministry study found that 9.4 percent of Indonesians, or about 30 million people, were positive for hepatitis B or C.

The NH Public Health Labs (PHL) have identified an additional 6 patients who match the strain of hepatitis C recently diagnosed in 4 people already associated with the CCL, bringing the total number of related cases to 10.\n\nThe initial 1st 4 cases identified last week [week of 28 May 2012] include 4 patients, one of whom is an Exeter Hospital employee. All these 10 individuals have been notified.\n\nThe investigation thus far has indicated the common link among the cases to be Exeter Hospital's Cardiac Catheterization Lab and its recovery room.

Further information is awaited.\n\nHepatitis C is caused by hepatitis C virus (HCV). HCV infection sometimes results in an acute symptomatic illness. It can range in severity from a mild illness lasting a few weeks to a serious, lifelong chronic condition that can lead to cirrhosis of the liver and liver cancer. HCV is most commonly transmitted through exposure to infectious blood such as through: receipt of contaminated blood transfusions, blood products, and organ transplants; injections given with contaminated syringes, needle-stick injuries in health care settings; injection drug use; being born to an HCV infected mother. It is less commonly transmitted through sex with an infected person and sharing of personal items contaminated with infectious blood. HCV is not spread through breast milk, food or water, or by casual contact such as hugging, kissing, and sharing food or drinks with an infected person.\n\nDiagnosis of acute infection is often missed because the infected person has no symptoms. Common methods of antibody detection cannot differentiate between acute and chronic infection. The presence of antibodies against HCV (anti-HCV) indicates that a person is or has been infected. HCV recombinant immunoblot assay (RIBA) and HCV RNA testing are used to confirm the diagnosis of HCV infection. Diagnosis of chronic infection is made when anti-HCV is present for more than 6 months. Similar to acute infections, diagnosis should be confirmed with an additional test. Specialized tests are often used to evaluate patients for liver disease including cirrhosis and liver cancer.\n\nFollowing initial infection, about 80 per cent of people do not exhibit any symptoms. Those people who are acutely symptomatic may exhibit fever, fatigue, decreased appetite, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, dark urine, grey-coloured faeces, joint pain, and jaundice (yellowing of skin and the whites of the eyes). When a chronically-infected person develops symptoms, it may indicate advanced liver disease. Statistically, 60-70 per cent of chronically-infected people develop chronic liver disease, 5-20 per cent develop cirrhosis, and 1-5 per cent die from cirrhosis or liver cancer.\n\nPrecise laboratory diagnosis is becoming increasingly important because different strains of HCV respond differently to currently available therapies. Interferon and ribavirin-based therapy has been the mainstay of HCV treatment. Unfortunately, interferon is not widely available globally, is not always well tolerated, some genotypes respond better than others, and many people who take it do not finish their treatment. While HCV is generally considered to be a curable disease, for many persons this is not a reality. Fortunately, scientific advances and intense research and development have led to the development of many new oral antiviral drugs for HCV infection. The future seems to hold great promise for HCV specific oral drugs that will be more effective and better tolerated. Much still needs to be done to ensure that these advances lead to greater access and treatment globally.\n\nExeter can be located in the HealthMap/ProMED-Mail interactive map of New Hampshire at http://healthmap.org/r/2y7g. - Mod.CP]", "summary": "Statistically, 60-70 per cent of chronically-infected people develop chronic liver disease, 5-20 per cent develop cirrhosis, and 1-5 per cent die from cirrhosis or liver cancer. \n\nBecause of these new results, DPHS is expanding its initial recommendations to test patients for hepatitis C, who received care at the Cath Lab and its recovery room on or after 1 Apr 2011, instead of 1 Aug 2011 through 25 May 2012.

US Attorney John Kacavas called [this technician] a 'serial infector' who worked in at least 6 other states, including one in which he is a suspect in a similar incident involving a hospital operating room. Kacavas declined to name any of the other states but said they are not clustered in one part of the country. 'We are closer to the beginning of our investigation than the end,' Kacavas said.\n\n[The technician], originally from Michigan, worked at Exeter's cardiac catheterisation lab from April 2011 through this past May [2012], when he was fired. He told investigators that he learned he had hepatitis C in May, but Kacavas said there is evidence that he had the liver-destroying disease since at least June 2010.\n\n'This serial infecter has been contained and the menace he posed to public health and safety has been removed,' Kacavas said. Authorities didn't say in what hospital [the technician] was being treated so he couldn't be contacted for comment.\n\nInvestigators believe [the technician, a 33 year old male], stole syringes containing fentanyl, a powerful aesthetic more potent than morphine, and injected himself with them. They said he then put another liquid, such as saline, into the syringes, which were later used for patients. They said a search of his vehicle found an empty fentanyl syringe and several needles. According to an affidavit, [he] sometimes left the lab sweating profusely and attended procedures on his off days. One witness said he appeared to be 'on something.' At least once, he was sent home for the day after a colleague told a supervisor that he was unfit to perform medical care, Kacavas said.\n\n[This technician] was what is known as a 'traveller,' a technician hired by hospitals for temporary stints around the country. In a statement, Exeter Hospital said he underwent drug testing and a criminal background check when he was hired. 'It is deeply disturbing that the alleged callous acts of one individual can have such an impact on so many innocent lives. As a result of his alleged actions, people in our community, who in many cases are the friends and neighbours of the 2300 people who work here, now face the challenge of a potentially chronic disease,' hospital president Kevin Callahan said.

The woman lives with her niece, who also got tested for hepatitis C because she was exposed to the woman's blood while helping her after she suffered a deep cut on her leg in April [2012]. The niece's test was negative, but she will get tested again in 6 months. The niece, who asked not to be publicly identified because of the stigma associated with the disease and because she wants to protect her aunt from the media, said she hopes the criminal charges will deter others from similar schemes. She said she was happy to hear that [the technician] had been arrested.\n\nState and local health departments aren't required to report such outbreaks to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), but in a report released in June [2012], the agency said it was notified of 13 outbreaks nationwide between 2008 and 2011. Of those, 7 occurred in outpatient facilities; most were traced to unsafe injection practices. At least 2 have resulted in criminal charges, including a Colorado woman who was convicted of stealing syringes filled with painkillers from 2 hospitals where she worked and replacing them with used syringes. The syringes were later used on surgical patients, and up to 3 dozen patients were found to have hepatitis C after being exposed.\n\nKacavas said New Hampshire is working with the CDC, law enforcement, and departments of public health in other states where [this technician] worked.

Federal prosecutors in New Hampshire announced Thursday that David Kwiatkowski was charged with obtaining controlled substances by fraud and tampering with a consumer product. Kwiatkowski allegedly infected patients with hepatitis C while working at a New Hampshire hospital.\n\nKDHE said Friday [20 Jul 2012] in a release that Kwiatkowski also worked in the cardiac catheterization laboratory at Hays Medical Center, HaysMed, from 24 May 2010 through 22 Sep 2010. KDHE and the Hays hospital have begun notifying about 460 patients the lab treated during that time, advising them on how to get free testing for the disease, which is a blood-borne viral infection that can cause liver damage and chronic health problems.\n\n'As medical professionals and members of the Hays community, we are deeply concerned by the alleged criminal conduct of this individual in New Hampshire,' Dr. John Jeter, president and CEO of HaysMed said in a prepared statement. Kwiatkowski, who grew up in Michigan, worked as a 'traveler' sent by staffing agencies to hospitals around the country, usually for temporary jobs. In announcing the federal drug charges in New Hampshire, U.S. Attorney John Kacavas called him a 'serial infector' who has worked in at least 6 states since 2007. Authorities have not publicly identified all the other states [but see below].\n\nKwiatkowski is accused of stealing anesthetic drugs from the lab, injecting himself and contaminating syringes that were later used on patients, 30 of whom have been diagnosed with the same strain of hepatitis C that Kwiatkowski carries. Though he told investigators he was diagnosed in May [2012], authorities said there is evidence that he has had the disease since at least June 2010. According to court documents, Kwiatkowski told investigators he did not steal drugs, is 'not a shooter,' and is scared of needles. He also said he was allergic to fentanyl, the powerful anesthetic he's accused of stealing, though medical records indicate he was given the drug during a medical procedure in 2011.\n\nKDHE said only patients who underwent cardiac catheterization procedures while Kwiatkowski worked there were potentially put at risk. 'We understand patients and their loved ones may be very concerned about this situation,' KDHE Secretary and State Health Officer Robert Moser said in a statement. 'I would like to reassure the public that we have no reason to be concerned about additional risks to the public.'\n\nKDHE said Hays patients who were possibly exposed are being contacted by mail with information on how to receive free hepatitis C testing for through KDHE. They're also being told who to contact with questions and concerns.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n*****\n[2] USA (Maryland)\nDate: Fri 21 Jul 2012\nSource: delmmarveanow.com [edited]\nhttp://www.delmarvanow.com/article/20120721/NEWS01/120721003/MD-CRIME-Man-accused-causing-HepC-outbreak-worked-hospitals\n\n\nMan accused of causing hepC outbreak worked in several hospitals\n----------------------------------------------------------------\nMaryland public health officials say a man accused of causing hepatitis C outbreak in New Hampshire worked at 4 hospitals in the state.

Montero would not comment on the specific employee suspected of causing the outbreak or say whether law enforcement is involved, but he said drug diversion generally involves someone using a syringe to inject themselves with medication meant for patients and then re-using the syringe on patients.\n\n'This is really disturbing. We as a department want to make sure health care quality is maintained across the board,' he said. 'Certainly, this is a really unfortunate situation. Nobody goes to a health care facility expecting to get sick.' Hepatitis C is a viral infection transmitted by blood. It causes inflammation of the liver that can lead to chronic health issues.\n\nThe Exeter investigation began in mid-May 2012 when 4 patients were diagnosed with an identical strain of the virus, and the only link officials could find was that all had been treated at the [same] lab. Officials initially asked anyone treated at the lab since August 2011 to get tested; on Wednesday [13 Jun 2012], Montero said that request has been expanded to include all of the lab's patients since October 2010. The lab was closed for a week in late May 2012 but was allowed to re-open after the authorities determined there was no evidence that disposable equipment was being misused, that no permanent equipment was contaminated, and that there was no further risk of transmission via lab employees, Montero said.\n\nState and local health departments aren't required to report such outbreaks to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, but the agency was notified of 13 outbreaks nationwide between 2008 and 2011. Of those, 7 occurred in outpatient facilities, and most were traced to unsafe injection practices. At least 2 have resulted in criminal charges, including a Colorado woman who was convicted of stealing syringes filled with painkillers from 2 hospitals where she worked and replacing them with used syringes. The syringes were later used on surgical patients, and up to 3 dozen were found to have hepatitis C after being exposed.\n\nIn New Hampshire, Montero said about 730 people have been tested so far, and several hundred more are expected.

A total of 333 people were diagnosed with the condition last year [2011] -- more than twice as many as a decade ago. Cases have risen from 276 in 2010, and 202 in 2009. Health experts welcomed the news, however, and said it proved that efforts to increase awareness and testing for the illness were paying off.\n\nThe spread of hepatitis C has been called the Silent Epidemic, because sufferers can in some cases have virtually no symptoms for up to a decade. Early symptoms, which include depression, fatigue, skin problems, insomnia, pain and digestive disorders, are also often misattributed to other causes. 20 per cent of sufferers clear the virus from the body within 6 months of infection, but the rest develop a long-term condition which can lead to cirrhosis of the liver, liver cancer or end-stage liver disease.\n\nIn February [2012], patients in the Lothians were among the 1st to be offered the option of 2 new drugs which it is hoped will help cure more people. A scheme last summer also put up posters in pub and club toilets across the Capital [Edinburgh] warning of the dangers of hepatitis C, explaining how the disease can be caught, and advertising support groups.\n\nThere are more than 3700 people living in the Lothians who are known to have hepatitis C but the Scottish officer for the Hepatitis C Trust, Petra Wright, said the true figure for infections was probably double the official figures. She said the rise in reported cases was partly down to the introduction of testing at drug outreach projects in 2009, and the introduction last year of the Scottish Government's Sexual Health and Blood Borne Viruses Framework. 'We welcome the increase, because it shows that the action plan is working,' she said. 'We can also see that they're diagnosing a lot of people in the younger age groups of 40 and under, and that shows the targeted testing is working, but more needs to be done to get the Baby Boomers, born between 1945 and 1965, who've been at risk in the past, tested.'\n\nThe best-known risk factor for hepatitis C infection is intravenous drug use, but steroid users and those who have had tattoos done abroad or at unlicensed events are also at risk. Hepatitis C, along with HIV, is the subject of the public inquiry being carried out by Lord Penrose into patients who were infected by NHS blood products.\n\nDr Ewan Stewart, lead clinician for NHS Lothian-led Viral Hepatitis Managed Care Network (MCN), said: 'These figures reflect the hard work going on across the Lothian to raise awareness of hepatitis C as well as making it easier for people to get tested. The Lothian Viral Hepatitis MCN works closely with GPs and other key health care workers to identify those at risk of the infection, promotes testing in community and prison settings and provides easy access testing clinics. We know that hepatitis C can have serious consequences if it is not diagnosed and treated. It is important to speak with a health care professional if you are worried about hepatitis C.'\n\nNumber of people diagnosed in Lothian each year (rate per 100 000 of population) are as follows:\n2001: 150 (19.3)\n2009: 202 (24.7)\n2010: 276 (33)\n2011: 333 (39.8)\nScotland 2011: 2147 (41.1)\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The WHO Factsheet on hepatitis C can be accessed at: http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs164/en/index.html.\n\nIncreased awareness of hepatitis C has become increasingly relevant with the development of new treatment options. The determination of the specific genotype of the hepatitis C virus responsible for a patient's illness is also becoming more important for the prediction of response to antiviral treatment: e.g., genotype 1 is generally associated with a poor response to interferon alone, whereas genotypes 2 and 3 are associated with more favourable responses. The current gold standard of therapy -- pegylated interferon in combination with ribavirin -- significantly improves response for all genotypes.\n\nThe combination of pegylated interferon (peginterferon) and ribavirin has been the standard recommended treatment for hepatitis C. The protease inhibitors telaprevir and boceprevir were approved by the US FDA in May 2011 for the treatment of hepatitis C genotype 1 in combination with peginterferon and ribavirin. 3 phase-3 trials are available for telaprevir, which provided data that were the basis for FDA approval. Boceprevir demonstrated efficacy and safety in 2 pivotal phase-3 trials. Both agents demonstrated statistically significantly higher rates of virological response compared with the standard of care involving peginterferons and ribavirin. Telaprevir and boceprevir also demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of patients who had previously failed dual therapy for hepatitis C. Safety concerns for both agents include anemia, drug interactions, skin rashes, and gastrointestinal adverse events.\n\nDecision makers have many factors to consider in developing a strategy around hepatitis C.

The number of baby boomers dying from a 'silent epidemic' of hepatitis C infections is increasing so rapidly that federal officials are planning a new nationwide push for widespread testing. Three in 4 of the estimated 3.2 million people who have chronic hepatitis C -- and a similar proportion of those who die from the disease -- are baby boomers. Deaths from the virus nearly doubled between 1999 and 2007 to more than 15 000, according to a recent Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study.\n\nHepatitis C is the leading infectious cause of cirrhosis and liver cancer and is the most common reason for liver transplants in the United States, according to the CDC. In 2007, deaths from the disease surpassed those linked to HIV, and the numbers of fatalities are expected to continue increasing, researchers reported. 'We have sort of a perfect storm of an age wave of people who are moving through time who are progressively becoming sicker from an infection that was acquired several decades ago,' said John Ward, director of the Division of Viral Hepatitis at the CDC. 'We think we are at a very critical juncture.'\n\nMany boomers unknowingly contracted the virus in younger years from using drugs or having blood transfusions before screening was improved during the AIDS crisis. Unaware of the risk and without symptoms, most have never been tested for hepatitis C and don't know they have it. The disease -- primarily contracted through blood -- often remains hidden for decades while it slowly destroys liver cells. There is no vaccine. [There are, however, now effective therapies, depending on the virus genotype. - Mod.CP]\n\n'Hepatitis C is really a stealth virus,' said Elizabeth Bancroft, medical epidemiologist with the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health. 'It can live in you for many, many, many years.'\n\nThere are at least 530 000 people living with hepatitis C in California, including an estimated 134 000 in Los Angeles County, according to health officials. Concerned about the disease among baby boomers, the CDC plans to issue a recommendation this year [2012] that everyone born between 1945 and 1965 be tested. Up until now, the federal agency only urged screening for those believed to be at risk. That strategy hasn't worked, in part because of the stigma; doctors don't ask about previous drug use, and patients don't offer up the information.\n\nThe CDC recommendation is coming in an era when safer, faster and more effective drug treatments are becoming available, and more are being tested. The new medications still have side effects but increase the odds of suppressing the virus and its complications, according to research. Health officials say the new medications, although they aren't cheap, are far less costly than liver transplants and liver cancer treatment, which can climb into the hundreds of thousands of dollars.\n\nThe disease is 'a significant and very costly problem' in California, said Gil Chavez, deputy director of the center for infectious diseases for the state public health department. In California, officials said hospitalization charges for liver disease, cancer and transplants totaled more than USD 2 billion in 2010. The state adopted a plan in 2009 to improve education about the disease and to increase access to testing and care, but Chavez said much more needs to be done. The expected federal recommendation for screening baby boomers will help providers and patients understand the dangers, he said.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The WHO Factsheet on hepatitis C can be accessed at: http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs164/en/index.html. - Mod.CP\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/r/1hcv, http://healthmap.org/r/1hiS.]", "summary": "A ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n \n\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention urges people born between 1945 and 1965 to be tested, noting that roughly 75 percent of people with the disease are baby boomers.

Health officials say the new medications, although they aren't cheap, are far less costly than liver transplants and liver cancer treatment, which can climb into the hundreds of thousands of dollars. Concerned about the disease among baby boomers, the CDC plans to issue a recommendation this year [2012] that everyone born between 1945 and 1965 be tested. \n\nMany boomers unknowingly contracted the virus in younger years from using drugs or having blood transfusions before screening was improved during the AIDS crisis. In California, officials said hospitalization charges for liver disease, cancer and transplants totaled more than USD 2 billion in 2010. The disease -- primarily contracted through blood -- often remains hidden for decades while it slowly destroys liver cells. The expected federal recommendation for screening baby boomers will help providers and patients understand the dangers, he said.", "reports": [{"diseases": ["hepatitis a", "hepatitis c"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2010-03-25 00:00:00", "2007-03-25 00:00:00", "2009-03-25 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Los Angeles County", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "California", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "CALIFORNIA", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "the United States", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "997611", "headline": "PRO/EDR> Hepatitis C - Pakistan: (PB) susp., RFI", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=997611", "date": "2012-01-02 18:36:46", "main_text": "HEPATITIS C - PAKISTAN: (PUNJAB) SUSPECTED, REQUEST FOR INFORMATION\n*******************************************************************\n\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Mon 2 Jan 2012\nSource: The Express Tribune [edited]\nhttp://tribune.com.pk/story/315192/hepatitis-c-outbreak-15-dead-over-500-believed-infected-in-rajanpur-village/\n\n\nAt least 15 people have died of [suspected] hepatitis C in a Rajanpur\nvillage over the past month while around 500 more are suffering from\nthe disease, the residents say.

Before transplantation, the donor had tested negative\nfor HCV antibody by the organ procurement organization. Tissue also\nwas procured from the donor for possible transplantation. The tissue\nbank performed an HCV antibody test on the donor's serum specimen that\nwas negative and nucleic acid testing (NAT) that was positive, but\nmisread as negative. Retesting of the donor specimen during the\ninvestigation confirmed the NAT results as positive. Donated tissue\nincluded 43 musculoskeletal grafts and one cardiopulmonary patch,\nwhich were distributed to health-care facilities in several states. An\ninvestigation was initiated to 1) identify potential sources of the\ndonor's infection, 2) document the mode of transmission to the organ\nrecipients, and 3) ensure timely notification of the implanting\nsurgeons and testing of tissue recipients. Implantation of infected\nHCV tissue occurred after recognition of new HCV infection in the\norgan transplant recipients, highlighting the need for rapid\ncommunication between transplant centers, organ procurement\norganizations, tissue banks, and public health authorities regarding\nsuspected transplantation transmission events.\n\nDonor investigation\n-------------------\nThe donor, a middle-aged man in Kentucky, sustained a traumatic brain\ninjury in March 2011 in an all-terrain vehicular incident and died 2\ndays later. His medical history was significant for schizophrenia,\nsubstance abuse, and a 5-month incarceration approximately 10 years\nbefore his death. The donor had no known history of intravenous drug\nuse or other hepatitis risk factors, according to his father at the\ntime of organ procurement; however, further investigation revealed\nthat the donor's father had limited contact with his son during the\nyear before his death and was unfamiliar with recent personal habits\nor behaviors.\n\nPolicies of the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN),\nthe oversight entity for solid organs in the United States, require\ntesting for HCV by antibody only, whereas the Food and Drug\nAdministration (FDA), which regulates human cells, tissues, and\ncellular and tissue-based products, requires screening of donated\ntissue for HCV by both antibody and NAT (1). The donor's HCV antibody\ntested negative on both organ and tissue donor screening, but\nmisreading of the reaction wells on testing led to an incorrectly\nreported negative HCV NAT result. Once this error was identified,\nrepeat NAT was performed at the tissue bank and confirmed that the\ndonor was HCV-positive at the time of donation. During the donor's\nfinal hospital stay in March [2011], he received 6 units of blood\nproducts. Pretransfusion serum from the donor was not available for\nanalysis. Testing of posttransfusion stored serum at CDC on 28 Oct\n2011 confirmed by NAT that the donor was HCV-positive with genotype 1a\nand a viral load of more than 69 000 000 IU/mL. Blood traceback\ninvestigation of the 6 associated blood donors to the infected donor\nis ongoing, and all remaining units from these donations have been\nquarantined.\n\n[The section dealing with 'Organ Transplant Investigation' and donor\nand recipient details are omitted. For information refer to the\noriginal document at the source URL above. - Mod.CP]\n\nTissue transplant investigation\n-------------------------------\nOn 29 Sep 2011, the organ procurement organization notified the tissue\nbank of the apparent HCV transmission to the kidney and liver\nrecipients. The tissue bank informed health-care facilities, and a\nvoluntary recall was begun on 30 Sep 2011. The tissue bank had\ndistributed 43 musculoskeletal grafts and one cardiopulmonary patch to\nhealth-care facilities, but names and contact information for surgeons\nwho implanted these tissues were not uniformly available at the time\nof recall. CDC telephone notification of all surgeons and requests for\ntesting of all patients was completed on 27 Oct 2011.\n\nThe cardiopulmonary patch, the only nonmusculoskeletal tissue\ndistributed, had been treated with antibiotics by the tissue bank\naccording to protocol and was implanted by a health-care facility in\nMassachusetts on 26 Sep 2011. After the health-care facility was\nnotified, the recipient underwent testing. Hepatitis C antibody was\nnegative, but NAT was positive at 82 000 IU/mL; the recipient's ALT\n[alanine aminotransaminase] was normal (12 U/L).\n\nThe 43 distributed musculoskeletal grafts were treated chemically and\nby irradiation at the tissue bank, according to protocol. 15 of the\nmusculoskeletal tissues were implanted; the remaining 28 were returned\nto the tissue bank. The 15 recipients of musculoskeletal tissues were\nrecommended to receive HCV serologic testing and NAT immediately and\nagain 6 months from the time of tissue implantation. As of 16 Dec\n2011, initial test results from 14 of the musculoskeletal tissue\nrecipients were known, and all were negative based on HCV NAT.\n\nMolecular characterization of HCV strains\n-----------------------------------------\nTo determine the genetic relatedness among the HCV strains obtained\nfrom the donor, the 2 kidney recipients, the liver recipient, and the\ncardiopulmonary patch recipient, maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees\nwere created (2). These analyses showed that 2 specimens from the\ndonor and the 3 specimens from the kidney recipients and\ncardiopulmonary patch recipient shared identical NS5b sequences; the\nliver recipient did not share these sequences, indicating previous\ninfection. Quasispecies analysis was performed on the specimens that\nshared identical NS5b sequences (3). The E1-HVR1 quasispecies\nsequences from the donor, the 2 kidney recipients, and the\ncardiopulmonary patch recipient clustered in a single group,\nindicating their close genetic relatedness consistent with a common\nsource of HCV transmission. The donor and the 2 kidney recipients and\none cardiopulmonary patch recipient had from 2 to 10 distinct E1-HVR1\nsequences that shared from 99.7 percent to 100 percent similarity with\neach other.\n\nMMWR editorial note\n-------------------\nThe transmission of HCV associated with transplanted organs and\nminimally processed tissue has been described previously, but this is\nthe 1st recognized HCV transmission via a cardiopulmonary patch (4).\nAlthough correct reading of tissue donor NAT screening results would\nhave prevented transmission through the tissue patch, the organ\nrecipients still would have become infected because current OPTN\npolicies for organ donor screening only require HCV serologic testing\n(1). Furthermore, positive organ donor NAT screening likely would have\nresulted in quarantine of potentially infected tissue. Use of NAT, in\naddition to anti-HCV serologic testing, has been proposed to decrease\nthe risk for transmitting undetected HCV infection. However, no one\ntest can uniformly detect all infections, either because of\nfalse-negative tests resulting from the window period, or\nassay-related issues, or, as described in this report, because of\nhuman error.\n\nWithout information regarding a donor's behavioral risk factors, the\nassay selection and sensitivity of pretransplantation testing is\ncritical. The incidence of HCV infection not detected by serologic\nscreening for anti-HCV antibody varies from 1 in 5000 for normal-risk\npatients to 1 in 1000 for patients at high risk (5). The window period\n(that is, the time from exposure to detectable HCV antibody) has a\nmean of 65-70 days; this period is shortened to 3-5 days with use of\nNAT (6). A transplant facility's decision to use an organ is based on\nthe organ procurement organization's assessment of the donor's risk\nstatus and on test results (5). Multiple factors, including the urgent\nneed for a potentially life-saving transplant and informed consent of\nthe transplant candidate must be considered when determining whether\nbenefits of transplantation outweigh the risk for transmitting HCV.\nThe US Public Health Service recently drafted guidelines recommending\ntesting of all organ donors with NAT for HCV regardless of risk status\n(7). Even if test results are not available at the time of\ntransplantation, results still can be used afterward to guide\nrecipient evaluation and treatment.\n\nThe diagnosis of HCV infection in 2 recipients of kidneys from the\nsame donor should raise immediate suspicion of donor-derived infection\nand reporting to OPTN and to local and state health departments as\nrequired by policy. Reporting to local and state health departments\nalso should occur because acute HCV infection is a nationally\nnotifiable disease. Reporting of suspected new diagnoses in organ\nrecipients, including to tissue banks, should occur without delay,\nbecause such diagnoses might have implications for tissues that have\nnot yet been transplanted.\n\nThe events in this report demonstrate the importance of timely\ncommunication once a transplant transmission is suspected and the\ndifficulty of tracking tissue to the patient or provider level should\na potential transmission be recognized after tissue has been\ndistributed. Although FDA requires that the tissue bank track the\ndistribution of tissues down to the institutional level, no government\nregulations require tracking tissue to the patient level; hospitals\nare asked voluntarily to return a record, often a postcard, to the\ntissue bank to notify them of implantation of the tissue. Many\nhealth-care facilities have a mechanism to track tissue to the\npatient, although approaches are not standardized (8). Systems that\nfacilitate real-time notification of possible disease transmission to\ntissue banks, organ procurement organizations, and other transplant\ncenters do not exist, and development is hindered by the lack of\nstandardized tissue nomenclature and identification standards (9,10).\n\nThis investigation reveals several areas in which current detection\nand notification might be improved to prevent similar future\ntransplant transmission events, including: 1) consideration of the use\nof HCV NAT for organ donors; 2) use of algorithms or other procedures\nto ensure accurate reading of test results and reduce human error; and\n3) timely feedback of possible disease transmission in organ or tissue\nrecipients to organ procurement organizations, tissue banks, public\nhealth authorities, and regulators.\n\n[For references readers should consult the original document at the\nsource URL above. - Mod.CP]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[A donor transmitted HCV to 2 kidney recipients and one tissue\nrecipient because of a negative antibody test and an incorrectly read\nHCV nucleic testing result.

The disease [initial infection] often has no\nsymptoms and, if untreated, can lead to chronic infection that can\nscar the liver, cause liver failure or cancer and potentially\n[require] liver transplantation.\n\nHepatitis C virus (HCV) is the commonest chronic bloodborne infection\nin the United States, with 35 000 to 185 000 new cases diagnosed per\nyear. Worldwide, 180 million people are chronically infected with\nhepatitis C [virus], with an estimated 3-4 million new cases reported\neach year. The disease particularly affects minorities [in the USA]:\nHispanics, Asian-Americans, and African-Americans.\n\n'This disease has grown to epidemic proportions, with 350 000 people\naround the world dying from hepatitis C related liver disease,' said\nMilan Kinkhabwala, MD, chief of the Division of Transplantation at the\nMontefiore Einstein Center for Transplantation. 'But it is called the\n'silent killer' because many people don't even know they have it. This\ncondition can be asymptomatic for decades and then present itself when\nit has already severely damaged the liver.'\n\nIndividuals at risk can get a simple blood test to detect the virus\nbefore chronic infection leads to permanent liver damage.\n\n'This is a revolutionary time in the treatment of the disease, and\nthere is more hope than ever before,' said Dr Kinkhabwala. 'The blood\ntest is essential to detecting hepatitis C, because now there are ways\nto treat the condition and even reverse damage to the liver.'\n\nTwo new anti-viral oral medications, boceprevir and teleprevir,\nreceived approval from the Food and Drug Administration in May 2011.\nBoth drugs work by blocking an enzyme that helps the virus reproduce.\nThe drugs are intended to improve on standard treatments using the\ninjected drug pegylated interferon alpha and the (oral) ribavavrin\n[ribavirin, I think. - Mod.SH].\n\n'So far, the new drugs have shown promise in clearing the virus from\nthe body and almost doubling the cure rate of the disease,' said Allan\nWolkoff, MD, professor of medicine and of anatomy and structural\nbiology at Albert Einstein College of Medicine of Yeshiva University\nand chief of the Division of Gastroenterology and Liver Diseases at\nMontefiore and Einstein. 'Another key benefit is that they cut\ntreatment time in half, thus reducing the time the patient has to\nendure the severe side effects, which include anemia, depression and\nflu-like symptoms like fatigue, fever and headache.'\n\nWhen symptoms do occur after the disease has progressed, they're\ngenerally mild and flu-like and may include fatigue, fever, nausea or\npoor appetite, muscle and joint pain, bruising, abdominal pain,\njaundice and itching. At that point, chronic infection can lead to\nscarring of the liver (fibrosis) and then advanced scarring\n(cirrhosis). Scarring of the liver makes it difficult for the liver to\nfunction properly and can be devastating to the rest of the body,\noften causing liver failure or liver cancer.\n\nIf the liver disease progresses too far and the medications are not\neffective, then transplantation is the last resort. However, more than\n16 000 people in the United States are currently waiting for a liver\ndonor, and in New York State, there are 1700 patients on the waiting\nlist.\n\nFactors that have been reported to accelerate the rate of HCV disease\nprogression include age, gender (males have more rapid disease\nprogression than females), alcohol consumption, HIV coinfection (in\nabout 35 per cent of patients) and fatty liver (the presence of fat in\nliver cells caused by obesity).\n\nUnlike hepatitis B, there is no vaccine to prevent this disease. While\nthe symptoms are similar, distinct differences exist between the 2\nviruses. Hepatitis B is primarily transmitted through sexual\nintercourse and is less severe.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is classified into 11 major genotypes\n(designated 1-11), many subtypes (designated a, b, c, etc), and about\n100 different strains (numbered 1, 2, 3, etc) based on the genomic\nsequence heterogeneity. The genes coding for the envelope E1 and E2\nglycoproteins are the most variable. Amino acid changes may alter the\nantigenic properties of the proteins, thus allowing the virus to\nescape neutralizing antibodies.\n\nGenotypes 1-3 have a worldwide distribution. Types 1a and 1b are the\ncommonest, accounting for about 60 per cent of global infections. They\npredominate in Northern Europe and North America, and in Southern and\nEastern Europe and Japan, respectively. Type 2 is less frequently\nrepresented than type 1. Type 3 is endemic in South East Asia and is\nvariably distributed in different countries. Genotype 4 is principally\nfound in the Middle East, Egypt, and central Africa. Type 5 is almost\nexclusively found in South Africa, and genotypes 6-11 are distributed\nin Asia.\n\nThe influence of viral genotype in the pathogenesis of liver disease\nis still controversial. Environmental, genetic, and immunological\nfactors may contribute to the differences in disease progression, so\ncharacteristic of HCV infection, observed among patients.\n\nThe determination of the infecting genotype is, however, important for\nthe prediction of response to antiviral treatment: genotype 1 is\ngenerally associated with a poor response to interferon alone, whereas\ngenotypes 2 and 3 are associated with more favourable responses. The\ncurrent gold standard of therapy -- pegylated interferon-a in\ncombination with ribavirin -- significantly improves response for all\ngenotypes.\n\nThe combination of pegylated interferon (peginterferon) and ribavirin\nhas been the standard recommended treatment for HCV. The protease\ninhibitors telaprevir and boceprevir were approved by the USFDA in May\n2011 for the treatment of hepatitis C genotype 1 in combination with\npeginterferon and ribavirin.\n\nThree phase 3 trials are available for telaprevir, which provided data\nthat were the basis for FDA approval. Boceprevir demonstrated efficacy\nand safety in 2 pivotal phase 3 trials. Both agents demonstrated\nstatistically significantly higher rates of virological response\ncompared with the standard of care involving peginterferons and\nribavirin. Telaprevir and boceprevir also demonstrated efficacy in the\ntreatment of patients who had previously failed dual therapy for\nhepatitis C. Safety concerns for both agents include anemia, drug\ninteractions, skin rashes, and gastrointestinal adverse events.\n\nDecision makers have many factors to consider in developing a strategy\naround hepatitis C. Increased drug costs, patient management,\nadherence, comparative safety and efficacy, and appropriate\nutilization management controls are important issues.

Authorities are looking into the possibility that the\nsource is a family-run clinic in Maqiao township, Yongcheng city,\nHenan province.\n\nOf those proven infected, 63 were from Maqiao township and the rest\nfrom Dancheng township, Guoyang county in Anhui province, said Deng\nHaihua, a Ministry of Health spokesman at a regular news conference on\nTuesday [13 Dec 2011]. 'None of them were showing any symptoms, but\nthey have received proper treatment. Further investigation, mainly by\nhealth authorities in the 2 provinces, are ongoing, and the final\nresults will be made public when they are ready,' he said.\n\nJia Jidong, who leads the Beijing Friendship Hospital's liver-research\ncenter, told China Daily that the actual number of cases might be\nlarger than the reported ones because 30 to 50 percent of those\ninfected could clear their systems of the virus within 6 months and\nwould test positive only for HCV antibodies. According to Jia, those\nwhose RNA test results come back negative could still test positive\nfor the antibody after clearing their systems of the virus.\n\nWhen the scandal 1st broke out, many, including Anhui health\nauthorities, suspected that the family-run clinic in Maqiao township,\nabout 8 km from the border between the 2 provinces involved, may have\nbeen reusing infected needles. But an initial probe in Maqiao found no\ncontaminated needles at the clinic, said a statement issued online by\nthe local government on Sunday [11 Dec 2011]. However, Wu Zunyou,\ndirector of the National Centre for AIDS and Sexually Transmitted\nDiseases Control and Prevention, has indicated that the needles might\nhave been discarded or sterilized [correctly] before the\ninvestigation. The statement said the investigation at the clinic\ncontinues, and the local health authority would increase supervision\nof hygiene and disinfection, particularly at grassroots village\nclinics. 'Subsequent analysis conducted among confirmed hepatitis C\npatients would help identify similarities, such as clinics they may\nhave all frequented before contracting the virus, and that would be\nsignificant for the investigation,' Wu said.\n\nThe probe at Maqiao found that most of those confirmed to have been\ninfected were aged 45 and older, said a statement issued by the city\nof Yongcheng. 'For them, it is also possible that they were infected\nin the botched plasma-selling scheme in the mid 1990s,' Wu said. But\nthe HCV incidence rate at Maqiao township, the probe found, stands at\n1.22 percent, far higher than the national average of 0.43 percent. At\nthe village of Shenlou in the township, the incidence rate reached 4.6\npercent. 'Based on the surprisingly high incidence rate, we can tell\nthat something must be going wrong there,' Wu noted.\n\nLi Jian, deputy director of the health bureau of Guoyang county, Anhui\nprovince, however, was cautious in discussing the latest findings of\ntheir probe. Unlike Yongcheng in Henan, Li's bureau had not released\ndetailed investigation results by Tuesday [13 Dec 2011]. 'We are still\nworking on it, and, so far, it's too early to say the clinic in Maqiao\nis the culprit,' he told China Daily on Tuesday. But he disclosed that\nmost of the 23 people confirmed infected in Dancheng were children,\nand local people had no contact with the plasma-selling scheme in the\nmid 1990s. 'Moreover, we've found that many of the infected children\noften went to the Maqiao clinic for treatment,' he said.\n\nHCV infections related to medical procedures are not rare on the\nmainland. In late August [2011], 6 officials in central Henan province\nwere removed from their posts after a medical incident in which 8\npeople contracted HCV. Eight uremia patients got infected during blood\ndialysis at the Xin'an County People's Hospital in Henan province.\n\nLei Zhenglong, deputy director of the ministry's disease prevention\nand control bureau, said hepatitis C transmission through medical\npractices like blood transfusions, dialysis, and organ transplants are\na concern, and the Ministry would regularly conduct field inspections\nat health institutions across the country. But he also conceded that\nclinics in rural areas are hard to manage and can hold a greater risk\nof infecting patients.\n\nCurrently, of the estimated 6 million hepatitis C patients on the\nmainland, 'a majority acquired their infections before health\nauthorities required mandatory hepatitis C virus screenings in blood\ntransfusions in 1993,' said Jia Jidong. 'Most of the patients I\nreceived at my hospital got infected in the early 1990s, and we've not\nseen a lot of new infections in recent years,' he said. But\nsusceptible groups, including AIDS patients and intravenous drug\nusers, are hit harder, he added.\n\n60-90 percent of China's reported AIDS patients are also infected with\nhepatitis C virus.\n\n[Byline: Shan Juan]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The origin of the hepatitis C outbreak in the border region of Anhui\nand Henan provinces remains unresolved, with suspicion shifting back\nto the village clinic in Maqiao township, Yongcheng city, Henan\nprovince, but without conclusive evidence of medical malpractice.

There are 5 main hepatitis viruses, referred to as\ntypes A, B, C, D and E. Hepatitis can lead to illness and death.

An\nestimated 39 000 people in Scotland [population about 5 million -\nMod.CP] have hepatitis C.\n\nTreatment services need improving and people need to be encouraged to\nbe tested, said Dr Robertson, a GP based in Edinburgh. He said:\n'Hepatitis C is a hugely important epidemic [disease] and it's almost\nentirely due to [illicit drug use]. Most of the epidemic in Scotland\nhas been amongst injecting drug users.\n\n'We've always expected that this is going to be an increasing number\nof cases over many years. Some people who get the virus can clear it\nfrom their system and it's no longer a problem. Others go on having\nthe disease but don't get ill for many, many years.' He said people\nwho used drugs and shared needles in the 1980s are starting to become\nunwell from this virus [disease]. 'Eventually the incubation period\nelapses and people begin to manifest cirrhosis and advanced liver\nfailure and the death rate will undoubtedly increase over the next few\nyears,' he added. Estimates indicate that the annual death toll from\nhepatitis C-related causes in Scotland could be between 100 to 200 by\n2015. 'And that will continue, probably indefinitely, for the next\ngoodness-knows-how-many years,' he added.\n\nDr Robertson, whose group helps to advise the Scottish Government,\ncalled for investment in treatment services. He continued: 'We treat\nprobably about 1000 cases per year in Scotland, which clearly isn't\nenough, and we need much more in terms of treatment services provision\nto reduce the size of the overall pool. For treatment services, now is\nthe time.'\n\nDr Robertson said more treatment would cure more people, who could go\non to develop liver damage, and may slow the rate of the epidemic.\n'Liver specialists are going to be overwhelmed. Also, I think,\ntreatment services are not terribly sympathetic and not terribly\nsupportive in some areas. And I think we could do a lot more to\nprovide better treatment services for a very difficult group of\npatients.'\n\nDr Saket Priyadarshi, lead clinician in addiction services for NHS\n[National Health Service] Greater Glasgow and Clyde and vice-chair of\nthe National Forum on Drug-Related Deaths, said treating hepatitis C\nnow would save millions of pounds in health care in the future.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nHealthMap Alerts via ProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Hepatitis C virus infection sometimes results in an acute symptomatic\nillness. It can range in severity from a mild illness lasting a few\nweeks to a serious, lifelong chronic condition that can lead to\ncirrhosis of the liver and liver cancer. A chronic hepatitis C\ninfection is when the infection lasts for longer than 6 months. The\ncourse of the chronic infection varies considerably between people and\nis unpredictable.\n\nHepatitis C virus is transmitted through contact with the blood of an\ninfected person. About 130-170 million people are chronically infected\nwith hepatitis C virus, and more than 350 000 people die from\nhepatitis C-related liver diseases each year. Hepatitis C virus\ninfection is found worldwide. Countries with high rates of chronic\ninfection are Egypt (22 per cent), Pakistan (4.8 per cent), and China\n(3.2 per cent). The main mode of transmission in these countries is\nattributed to unsafe injections using contaminated equipment.\n\nFollowing initial infection, about 80 per cent of people do not\nexhibit any symptoms. Those people who are acutely symptomatic may\nexhibit fever, fatigue, decreased appetite, nausea, vomiting,\nabdominal pain, dark urine, grey-coloured faeces, joint pain, and\njaundice. When a chronically-infected person develops symptoms, it may\nindicate advanced liver disease. Statistically, 60-70 per cent of\nthose with chronic infection develop chronic liver disease, 5-20 per\ncent develop cirrhosis, and 1-5 per cent die from cirrhosis or liver\ncancer. (WHO Fact sheet 164:\nhttp://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs164/en/index.html).\n\nThere are 6 genotypes of hepatitis C virus, which is an enveloped,\npositive-sense single-stranded RNA virus of the family _Flaviviridae_.\nAlmost all people in the UK who have hepatitis C have genotype 1,\ngenotype 2, or genotype 3 virus. The different genotypes respond\ndifferently to treatment, and it is possible to be infected with more\nthan one type of hepatitis C at the same time.\n\nAs the damage caused by the hepatitis C is usually very gradual, the\ntime at which people with hepatitis C start treatment may vary between\ncases. The usual treatment involves administration of pegylated\ninterferon and/or ribavirin. The treatment clears the virus in almost\nhalf of those infected with genotype 1, and about 80 per cent of those\ninfected with genotype 2 or 3. A course of treatment lasts 6-12\nmonths, depending upon the hepatitis C virus genotype. It takes about\n12 weeks to determine if this treatment is working. Side-effects from\nthese treatments can occur which may include tiredness, nausea,\nheadaches, and depression. New treatments are becoming available which\nmay improve outcomes.\n\nThe HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map of Scotland can be accessed\nat http://healthmap.org/r/00a8. - Mod.CP]", "summary": "HEPATITIS C - UK (03): (SCOTLAND)\n*********************************\n\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n Statistically, 60-70 per cent of\nthose with chronic infection develop chronic liver disease, 5-20 per\ncent develop cirrhosis, and 1-5 per cent die from cirrhosis or liver\ncancer.

This is a concern, in particular because many of\nthese individuals remain undiagnosed.\n\nIn England, an estimated 161 000 -- 0.4 per cent of the adult\npopulation -- are chronically infected, according to the report. The\nestimated numbers chronically infected in Scotland, Wales, and\nNorthern Ireland are 39 000, 12 000, and 4000 respectively.\n\nThe main chapters of the new report describe, in turn, diagnosis,\nprevention, treatment, and awareness-raising activities in England,\nScotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. A final section presents\nconsolidated data for the UK as a whole -- including an assessment of\nthe burden that HCV infection presents on the UK health service: a\nnumber of sources of national data are used to demonstrate that\nHCV-related hospital admissions, transplants, and deaths continue to\nrise. By 2020, for example, the report estimates that over 15 000\npeople will be living with either HCV-related cirrhosis or liver\ncancer caused by hepatitis C in England [3].\n\nAs in previous HPA reports on HCV, the high prevalence of infection in\nparticular groups is shown to be a key characteristic of the disease\nin the UK: injecting drug users (IDUs) are at greatest risk of\nacquiring infection and some minority ethnic populations also have\nhigher rates of infection than the white, UK-born population.\n\nPrevention and awareness-raising\n--------------------------------\nIn England, following continuous investment in community drug\ntreatment, the number of people in contact with such services exceeded\n206 000 in 2009/10. In all UK countries, data suggest declining rates\nof risky injecting practices, the report notes. However, despite these\ninitiatives, data from the Unlinked Anonymous Monitoring Survey of\nInjecting Drug Users in Contact with Specialist Services (UAM) in 2010\n[4] suggest that 49 per cent and 57 per cent of IDUs in England and\nScotland, respectively, are positive for HCV antibody (levels are\nlower in Northern Ireland and Wales), underlining the importance of\nongoing efforts to target this highest-risk group of the population.\n\nBecause hepatitis C is usually asymptomatic in the early years of\ninfection, and consequently many individuals remain undiagnosed, a\nvariety of initiatives to increase public awareness of hepatitis C are\nongoing. These include campaigns directly addressed to the high-risk\ngroups themselves -- such as The Hepatitis C Trust's well-established\nGet Tested! campaign -- and education programmes for health care\nprofessionals. These include: an e-learning package in Northern\nIreland; a Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) Certificate\nin the Detection and Diagnosis of Hepatitis C in Primary Care in\nEngland; and a Train the Trainer course on bloodborne viruses (BBVs)\nin Wales aimed at individuals from across a range of social, health,\nand other contexts working with individuals at risk of BBV infection.\n\nDiagnosis and testing\n---------------------\nThere was a significant increase in new, laboratory-confirmed HCV\ndiagnoses in Scotland in 2010, the report notes, whereas in the rest\nof the UK, laboratory reports -- albeit known to underestimate the\ntrue levels of diagnosis -- suggest a fall in the numbers diagnosed\nover the past year. Although diagnosis by general practitioners (GPs)\nin Scotland declined in 2010, despite the launch of professional and\npublic awareness campaigns earlier that year, this was more than\noffset by the increase in diagnosis in drug treatment/harm reduction\nsettings. When data from enhanced surveillance systems are taken\ntogether, testing patterns and self-reports both suggest that HCV\ntesting among IDUs in England is increasing, as is testing via primary\ncare and among individuals of South Asian origin, suggesting increased\nawareness of HCV across all these groups and settings.\n\nEven though integrated drug treatment has been further rolled out\nacross the English prison population, the HPA data do not support an\nincrease in testing in English prisons over the past year.\n\nRoll out of the recently available technique of dried blood spot (DBS)\ntesting -- which has contributed to increased levels of testing in\nIDUs in England, Scotland, and Wales -- has been pilot-tested in\nNorthern Ireland and is being rolled out across the prison population\nin Wales.\n\nBurden of HCV-related disease on health services\n------------------------------------------------\nAlthough HCV is a chronic infection, antiviral treatments are\navailable that will successfully clear the virus in the majority of\npatients. However, unless a significant increase in those receiving\neffective treatment occurs, the future burden of HCV-related disease\nwill be substantial, the HPA report concludes. All national data\nsources (hospital admissions for HCV-related end-stage liver disease,\nliver transplants, and deaths) show that HCV-related liver disease is\ncontinuing to rise and it is predicted that in 2020, 15 840\nindividuals will be living with HCV-related cirrhosis or\nhepatocellular carcinoma in England alone.

Those at-risk are being\nurged to get tested after it emerged the north west has the highest\nnumber of cases in England. 6 pharmacies in the county now offer free\nblood tests for both hepatitis B and C -- which affect the liver. They\nare 100 times more infectious than HIV.\n\nLatest figures, released to coincide with World Hepatitis Day, show\nthat more than 29 500 people in the region are now living with\nhepatitis C [virus infection] -- but only one in 6 are aware. In\nCumbria there are 2052 people, among the biggest in the [north west]\nregion. The north west has had the highest number of diagnosed cases\nacross England since 1999. There has, however, been a decrease in the\nnumber of young people, aged 15 to 24, being diagnosed.\n\nThose who may be at risk are therefore being urged to get tested at\nparticipating chemists [pharmacies] in Carlisle, Workington,\nWhitehaven, Penrith, Ulverston or Barrow, who also offer special\ncounselling both before and after the test. People deemed to be 'at\nrisk' include those with a family member, partner or ex-partner who\nhas the infection, people who have had a blood transfusion or organ\ntransplant prior to 1992, tattooists, people who have had medical\ntreatment abroad, people who have shared needles, injecting drug users\nand health staff.\n\nHepatitis B is an infection of the liver caused by a virus, killing\none million people across the globe each year. It is usually passed\nfrom person to person through unprotected sex, sharing of needles or\nby infected mothers during childbirth. Often people may not know they\nare infected as the symptoms are similar to flu, such as headaches,\naches and pains, vomiting, weight loss, diarrhoea and jaundice.\n\nHepatitis C, on the other hand, is [caused by] a virus in the blood\nwhich causes an infection of the liver, swelling and scarring. If left\nuntreated it can develop into more serious conditions such as liver\ncancer. Again it is usually transmitted by sharing needles or\nunprotected sex [probably only rarely - Mod.CP]. Although 13 000 new\ncases of hepatitis C are discovered each year in the UK, around 100\n000 people are thought to be undiagnosed. Often people experience no\nsymptoms in the first 6 months, but in the later stages can suffer\nfrom digestive problems, extreme tiredness, nausea and vomiting,\nfever, itching and headaches. However, there is good news as treatment\nnow available is effective against the virus in many cases.\n\nThe pharmacy scheme, in each local authority area, is a partnership\nbetween NHS Cumbria and the Hepatitis C Trust. Those involved already\nwork with people who could be at risk, offering services such as\nneedle exchange and methadone pick-up. The test is a finger prick, dry\nblood spot test. Samples are sent away for testing. Gareth Jones, one\nof the pharmacists involved, said: 'I'd encourage anyone who is\nconcerned to go along to one of the pharmacies offering this testing,\nhave a chat and take the test.' Chemists involved are Joseph Cowper in\nPenrith, Mirehouse Pharmacy in Whitehaven, and Boots branches in both\nCarlisle and Workington.\n\n[Byline: Pamela McGowan]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nHealthMap alerts via ProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Cumbria is a non-metropolitan county in North West England.

HCV transmission occurs\nprimarily through percutaneous exposure to blood, and persons who\ninject drugs are at greatest risk for infection. The role of sexual\ntransmission of HCV has not been well defined. However, reports over\nthe past decade, mainly from Europe, have implicated sexual\ntransmission of HCV among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected\nmen who have sex with men (MSM). In late 2005, 2 HIV-infected MSM,\neach with acute HCV infection that was suspected to have been acquired\nsexually, were evaluated at Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York\nCity, prompting Mount Sinai to request referrals of similar patients\n(2). During 2005--2010, a total of 74 HIV-infected MSM with recently\nacquired HCV infection and no reported history of injection-drug use\nwere evaluated. To examine the role of sexual transmission, a matched\ncase-control study and viral analysis were conducted. Results from the\ncase-control study showed that high-risk sexual behavior was the most\nlikely mode of transmission among these men. Phylogenetic analyses\nrevealed 5 clusters of closely related HCV variants, suggesting\nnetworks of transmission among these men. The findings underscore the\nimportance of screening HIV-infected MSM for HCV, particularly those\nengaged in high-risk sexual behavior.\n\n[Readers are referred to the full text of this report at the source\nURL for a detailed account of the characteristics of the case-\npatients, details of the case-control study, description of the\nphylogenetic analyses, and the list of references cited}.\n\nMMWR Editorial Note:\n--------------------\nThis report suggests high-risk sexual behavior as a cause of HCV\ntransmission among HIV-infected MSM in New York City. Unprotected\nreceptive anal intercourse with ejaculation and sex while high on\nmethamphetamine were the most important predictors of HCV infection.\nResults from phylogenetic analyses suggest networks of HCV\ntransmission among these men. The findings of high-risk sex,\nconcurrent noninjection-drug use, and phylogenetic clustering are\nsimilar to those observed among cohorts of HIV-infected MSM with HCV\ninfection in Northern Europe and Australia (4). A notable finding from\nthis study and those in other countries is the association of\nnoninjection, recreational drug use (e.g., methamphetamine use) with\nthe acquisition of HCV infection.\n\nSexual transmission of HCV is considered to be an inefficient and\nrare mode of transmission (6). However, concurrent HIV infection\nresults in increased HCV RNA levels (viral load) (7), which are\nthought to increase infectiousness of HCV acquired through sexual\ncontact. Of further concern among persons who are coinfected is that\nHIV accelerates HCV disease progression, even in its early stages (2).\nEnd-stage liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma, both usually\nresulting from chronic HCV infection, are now leading causes of death\nnot attributable to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) among\nHIV-infected persons in the United States (8).\n\nThe findings in this report are subject to at least 3 limitations.\n1st, recall of events such as ejaculation by sex partner up to 12\nmonths before HCV diagnosis can be imperfect. For example, the\nfindings should not be interpreted to definitively exclude acquisition\nof HCV by some men through unprotected receptive anal intercourse\nwithout ejaculation, even though this variable did not exert a\nsignificant independent effect on HCV infection in the multivariable\nanalysis. 2nd, refusal to acknowledge injection-drug use is not\nuncommon, and other types of stigmatizing risk behavior also might be\nunderreported. Such social desirability bias was addressed by using a\nself-administered questionnaire and assuring each patient that his\nresponses would not be shared with his primary-care provider. Finally,\nstudy investigators relied on patient referrals from HIV-care\nproviders outside Mount Sinai, and referral bias might have occurred;\nhowever, the number of referring providers was fairly sizable (n =\n35).\n\nSexual transmission of HCV among HIV-infected MSM is more widespread\nthan this one study demonstrates. A recent U.S. report described\nHCV-antibody seroconversions among HIV-infected MSM without a history\nof injection-drug use (9). A recent European report that examined a\ngroup of studies, primarily from Europe, found substantial increases,\nparticularly during 2002--2007, in the incidence of HCV infection\namong HIV-infected MSM, demonstrating just how serious the epidemic\nhas become among these men (10). Hepatitis C should be added to the\nlist of infections spread among HIV-infected MSM who have sex with\nHCV- infected partners HIV-infected patients should be counseled and\nreminded that unprotected sex between HIV-infected partners can\ntransmit other infections, including HCV. In addition to HCV screening\nfor MSM newly diagnosed with HIV, routine HCV screening using both ALT\nand antibody testing should be considered for HIV-infected MSM,\nparticularly those with high-risk sexual behaviors or concomitant\nulcerative sexually transmitted diseases (e.g., syphilis and herpes\nsimplex virus).

In those who do\ndevelop symptoms, the average time period from exposure to symptom\nonset is 4\u00ad to 12 weeks (range: 2 to \u00ad24 weeks).

From 2004 through 2008, the\n6-county area had a combined average of 12.2 cases a year. In 2009 and\n2010, they averaged 27 cases annually.\n\nHepatitis C, a viral disease, causes inflammation of the liver, which\ncan lead to various health problems, including liver cancer and death,\nKuennen said. Unlike with hepatitis A and B, there is no preventive\nvaccine.\n\nHealth officials are in the middle of an investigation into the\nproblem, said Melanie Behr, nursing supervisor for Portage County\nCommunity Health. Although it's listed as one of the 6 counties,\nPortage County hasn't seen the same increase as the other 5 counties,\nshe said. However, Behr wants to wait for the results of the\ninvestigation before making any assumptions about the situation.\n\nThe state and federal agencies gave the counties a survey to use when\ntalking with people to determine a commonality for what people were\ndoing when they were infected with hepatitis C, Kuennen said.\n\nThe 6 counties aren't alone in the problem, Kuennen said. 'It's\nhappening nationwide; it's not just Wisconsin, or the northern\nregion,' she said. One of the potential causes for the trend is an\nincrease in intravenous drug use, Kuennen said. Illegal drugs, such as\nheroin, can be purchased for less money than some of the prescription\ndrugs that get abused, such as oxycodone.\n\nThe one new case of hepatitis C seen in Portage County in 2010\ninvolved intravenous drug use, Behr said. Heroin use is becoming more\nsocially accepted, Wood County investigator-sgt. Scott Saeger said.\nNationally, health department officials think 35 to 70 per cent of\ndrug users who inject are infected with hepatitis C, Saeger said.\n\nTo avoid contracting the disease, people should make sure they use\nclean needles every time and never share a needle, Kuennen said.\nPeople can become part of a clean needle exchange program by\ncontacting their local health department. Kuennen also recommends\npeople who are getting tattoos or piercings check to make sure the\nprovider is state certified and inspected.\n\nTattoo artists need to check their sanitizing equipment monthly and\nprovide the records to county officials during inspections, said Kate\nCarlson, Wood County environmental health specialist. This protects\nthe health of clients. Kuennen recommends that anyone who has ever\nshared a needle get tested for hepatitis C. One of the problems with\nthe disease is that it usually doesn't have any visible symptoms until\nthe person who has it becomes very sick.\n\n[byline: Kate Madden]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nHealthMap alerts via ProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[A map of the counties of the state of Wisconsin, showing the\nlocations of the adjacent counties of Wood, Portage, Marathon,\nLanglade, Lincoln and Oneida can be accessed at\nhttp://www.digital-topo-maps.com/county-map/wisconsin.shtml.\n\nHepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is the commonest chronic bloodborne\ninfection and it appears to be increasing in parts of the United\nStates and elsewhere [for instance see the recent ProMED-mil archived\nreports: Hepatitis C - Canada: (QC) 20110510.1438, and Hepatitis C -\nS.

The\nidentification and characterization of this virus gives scientists new\ninsights into how hepatitis C in humans may have evolved and provides\nscientists renewed hope to develop a model system to study how it\ncauses disease.\n\nThe research was conducted at the Center for Infection and Immunity\n(CII) at Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health, the\nUniversity of Edinburgh, the Center for the Study of Hepatitis C, and\nPfizer Veterinary Medicine.\n\nHuman hepatitis C virus (HCV) affects approximately 200 million\npeople worldwide. According to the Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention (CDC), 3.2 million people in the United States are\nchronically infected. The majority of these patients do not know they\nare carrying the virus, thus serving as a source of infection for\nothers. HCV, which can cause liver disease and liver cancer, is most\noften transmitted following large or repeated exposure to infected\nblood. Persons who use injection drugs; are HIV-positive; or are\nchildren of infected mothers have the highest risk of infection.\n\nThe discovery of canine hepatitis C virus (CHV) suggests that the\nvirus may have been introduced into human populations through contact\nwith dogs or some other related species more than 500 years ago, long\nafter the domestication of dogs.\n\nCHV belongs to a group of viruses known as hepaciviruses, which also\nincludes GBV-B, a virus that causes hepatitis in tamarins, small\nmonkeys from Central and South America. Among these viruses, HCV is\nmost closely related to its canine counterpart, a finding that\nsurprised first author Dr Amit Kapoor, an investigator in the Center\nfor Infection and Immunity (CII) and assistant professor of\npathology.\n\n'Considering the origin of HIV,' Dr Kapoor explains, 'we expected to\nfind the closest homologs, or genetic relatives, of HCV in non-human\nprimates. However, while we were analyzing samples from dogs involved\nin outbreaks of respiratory disease, we came upon a virus that was\nmore similar to HCV than other viruses of the same family. So far, we\nhave only detected CHV in sick animals, a few of which had died of\nunknown causes. Because of its close genetic similarity to HCV, we\nsuggested the name of canine hepacivirus.'\n\nAccording to Dr Charles Rice, scientific and executive director of\nthe Center for the Study of Hepatitis C at The Rockefeller University\nand one of the collaborators involved in the study, 'the origins of\nHCV remain a mystery. These findings underscore the need to look\nbeyond primates for clues to the origins of HCV.'\n\nViral zoonoses, infections that are transmitted from animals to\nhumans, account for about 70 percent of human emerging infectious\ndiseases. Although transmission between species is uncommon, sustained\ncontact over time can increase the likelihood that a virus adapted to\ninfect humans will evolve. Since their domestication about 10 000\nyears ago, dogs have been close human companions. Whether humans and\ndogs were independently infected with an ancestral virus by another\nspecies or whether dogs infected humans (or vice versa) cannot be\ndetermined from this study.

The discovery of canine hepatitis C virus (CHV) suggests that the\nvirus may have been introduced into human populations through contact\nwith dogs or some other related species more than 500 years ago, long\nafter the domestication of dogs. She commented further that this study is the\nfirst to document this virus outside humans and non-human primates and\nsuggests that hepatitis C may have been introduced into human\npopulations through contact with dogs after they were domesticated. Whether humans and\ndogs were independently infected with an ancestral virus by another\nspecies or whether dogs infected humans (or vice versa) cannot be\ndetermined from this study. It\nis important to note that there is no current risk that dogs can\ninfect humans with either the canine or the human version of the\nvirus.

There have\nbeen about 1000 new cases annually during the past 4 to 5 years\naccording to Dr Richard Lessard, director of the Montreal DSP\n[Direction de sante publique de Montreal; public health department].\nThis figure may represent only a fraction of the actual number of\ncases. 'We cannot know the percentage of infected people in the\ngeneral population.' Dr Lessard stated further that: 'We only know the\nsituation for people who have undergone screening. However, we know\nthat the infection is prevalent in all districts of the city of\nMontreal. 'Initially, HCV was present mainly in the city centre and in\nthe south west district, but currently the problem is present in all\nareas of Montreal island.'\n\nNearly 50 per cent of infected people are or have been users of\ninjected drugs. 'HCV is transmitted by blood. Needle re-use is the\nmain route of transmission,' according to Dr Lessard. HCV infection is\n3 times commoner in men than in women. In 95 per cent of cases, people\nwho exchange syringes will become infected in the 1st 6 months after\nbecoming addicted. Dr Lessard advised that the establishment of\nsupervised injection facilities should be considered as an approach\ntoward curbing this scourge. 'We must improve our prevention\nstrategies to prevent the problem snowballing out of control.'\n\nTo a lesser extent, use of other types of drug pose problems in\nrelation to HCV (and HIV) infection. Sandra Trifa, a nurse involved in\nHCV and HIV infection control stated that: 'Pipes used for smoking\ncrack [cocaine] also represent a risk [for transmission of virus]\nbecause they may cause burns and bleeding lips.' Nurse Trifa also\nindicated that nasal inhalation is another route of infection, because\nthe occurrence of micro damage in the nasal passages contributes to\nthe spread of HCV, which is a more virulent [contagious?] virus than\nHIV. 'Whereas HIV is inactivated rapidly at ambient temperatures, HCV\ncan remain infectious for up to 16 hours under the same conditions,\nand can remain infectious for as long as 163 days in a contaminated\nsyringe,' according to Nurse Trifa.\n\nIn 2009, 45 per cent of all HCV diagnoses in Quebec [province] were\nmade in Montreal.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nHealthMap Alerts via ProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[About 60-70 per cent of people newly infected with HCV typically are\nusually asymptomatic or have a mild clinical illness. Although HCV RNA\ncan be detected in blood within 1-3 weeks after exposure, the average\ntime from exposure to seroconversion is 8-9 weeks, and anti-HCV can be\ndetected in greater than 97 per cent of people by 6 months after\nexposure. Chronic HCV infection develops in 70 per cent to 85 per cent\nof HCV-infected people and 60 per cent to 70 per cent of people with\nchronic infection have evidence of active liver disease. Most of those\ninfected might not be aware of their infection because they are not\nclinically ill, but they serve as a source of transmission to others\nand are at risk of chronic liver disease or other HCV-related chronic\ndiseases decades after infection.\n\nHCV is most efficiently transmitted through large or repeated\npercutaneous exposure to infected blood (such as, through transfusion\nof blood from unscreened donors or through use of injecting drugs).\nAlthough much less frequent, occupational, perinatal, and sexual\nexposures also can result in transmission of HCV.

Much of the problem behind the soaring infectious rates is poor\nhealth care oversight and erratic medical hygiene.\n\n'Nearly 7 out of every 1000 Egyptians acquire HCV infections every year.\nThis is the highest level of HCV transmission ever recorded at a national\nlevel for a disease transmitted by use of non-sterile medical instruments,'\nsays Dr F DeWolfe Miller, lead author of the study.\n\nPrevalence of hepatitis C in Egypt dates back to the 1970s. It was then\nthat health authorities in the Nile Delta and Upper Egypt were injecting\npatients with tartar emetic to stop the spread of the waterborne disease\nknown as bilharzia. But many of the needles were unsterilized, causing HCV\nto spread to thousands of Egyptians.\n\nNowadays, many blame the government for not halting the virus'\nproliferation throughout the country of about 80 million people. The\nEgyptian National Committee on Viral Hepatitis states that 9.8 per cent of\nEgyptians are HCV infected, whereas doctors and researchers claim that the\nreal figure is between 15 and 20 per cent.\n\n'Most HCV patients come from Egypt's most rural and poorest areas and they\nrely on the medical insurance programs,' said Dr Lotfi Wanees, an expert on\nhepatitis. 'Medication cost for every hepatitis C patient stands at an\naverage of 70 000 Pounds [USD 12 250] and the government has failed to\nprovide this sum for most of the patients.'\n\nHe added: 'There are also the deals signed between the Ministry of Health\nand medicine companies. Many virus C medicines produced by Egyptian\npharmaceutical firms are not verified in the West and proved to be\ninefficient. But they are still being prescribed to patients and the\ngovernment pays millions of pounds to purchase them.'\n\nAccording to Wanees, the 'community acquired' virus has also been\naccompanied by culture and literacy problems, as many of the poor,\nuninsured patients resort to superstitious and primitive medical\nsubstitutes, which worsen their cases.\n\nComplications of hepatitis C lead to liver cirrhosis or liver failure. Many\npeople infected with the virus have no symptoms and are only diagnosed when\nliver damage appears many years later.\n\n[byline: Amro Hassan]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nHealthMap Alerts via ProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Hepatitis C is a contagious liver disease that results from infection with\nhepatitis C virus.

He had hepatitis C, a potentially deadly virus that\nattacks the liver. 'Apparently, he did this for many years before he\nwas caught,' said the former patient, who asked not to be named\nbecause it might stigmatize her.\n\nShe is among 5000 former patients at the Florida branch of the\nrenowned Mayo Clinic to receive the warning letter, which has been\nmailed out in 2 waves this month [September 2010]. 'I have never felt\nmore safe than I was at the Mayo Clinic,' said the Tavares woman, who\nunderwent heart and kidney operations at the Mayo Clinic in 2006 and\n2007. 'For this to happen, I think is horrible.' On Thursday [23 Sep\n2010], the Mayo Clinic sent a team to her home to draw blood for\ntesting for hepatitis C, hepatitis B, and HIV infection. So far, 3\nformer patients have tested positive for hepatitis C [virus infection].\n\nIn August [2010], a 47-year-old former radiology technician, was\nfired after admitting he had used painkillers prescribed for\npatients. He was arrested last month [August 2010] on a minor felony\nrelated to stealing drugs. But law-enforcement officials say he could\nface more charges as the investigation continues. The radiology\ntechnician worked at the Mayo from 11 Oct 2004, up to 21 Aug 2010. He\nworked in Interventional Radiology at St Luke's Hospital from 2004 to\n11 Apr 2008, when Mayo Clinic owned St Luke's Hospital.\n\n'We want to ensure that every patient who might be at risk is\ntested,' said Dr William C Rupp, chief executive officer of Mayo\nClinic in Florida. 'We want to cast as wide a net as possible to make\nsure we've included any possible patient.' That, Rupp said, has\nincluded tracking down every patient who had a procedure on the days\nthe technician was working and in the section of the hospital where\nhe was working. Most of the affected patients are from Florida, Rupp\nsaid, but letters also have been sent to several living in the\nSoutheast and a few who live abroad.\n\nThe former employee has tested negative for hepatitis B virus and\nHIV, Rupp said, but the US Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention, as well as the Florida Department of Health, urged that\nformer patients be tested for those viruses as well. So far, 3\npatients have been diagnosed with cases of hepatitis C that are\ngenetically similar to the type the technician has, Mayo officials\nsaid. One of those patients died from the virus [infection], another\ndied from an unrelated illness, and the 3rd remains alive. Hepatitis\nC virus attacks the liver but often doesn't cause symptoms for years.\nLeft untreated, it can cause severe problems, such as cirrhosis and\nliver cancer.\n\nThe American Hospital Association described the Mayo technician's\nactions as 'egregious and criminal,' said spokesman Matt Fenwick. He\ncalled upon hospitals to work hard to 'ensure it doesn't happen\nagain.' For their part, Mayo Clinic officials say they are taking\nsteps to improve security related to narcotics. Among the new\nsafeguards: Mayo nurses will now initial every syringe when it's\ndrawn so that it can't be switched without notice.\n\n[Byline: Linda Shrieves]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Brent Barrett\n\n[The initial report in ProMED-mail on 24 Aug 2010 of 3 cases of\nhepatitis C virus contracted from a radiology technician at the Mayo\nClinic in Jacksonville, Florida, did not explain the circumstances\nsurrounding this incident.

While vaccines are\navailable for hepatitis A and B, this is not the case for hepatitis C,\nwhich affects as much as 2 percent of the population in the US.\nScientists today are reporting discovery of a virus related to\nhepatitis C in Asian bats, which may provide insights into the origins\nof the hepatitis C virus and into the mechanisms by which infectious\ndiseases move from other species to humans. The full study findings\nare published online in the publication PLoS Pathogens [The Abstract\nand Authors' Summary are reproduced below. - Mod.CP]\n\nTransmitted by blood transfusion or sexual intercourse, hepatitis C\n[virus] is a common cause of liver failure. Viruses related to\nhepatitis C, known as GB-viruses, have previously been found only in\nprimates. Now, using cutting-edge molecular techniques, an\ninternational team of investigators has identified a GB-virus in\n_Pteropus giganteus_ bats in Bangladesh. The work was completed at the\nCenter for Infection and Immunity (CII) at Columbia University's\nMailman School of Public Health, led by W Ian Lipkin, MD; the\nInternational Centre for Diarrheal Disease Research in Bangladesh; 454\nLife Sciences, a Connecticut-based division of Roche Corporation; and\nthe Wildlife Trust in New York City.

In an effort to survey for the presence of other\ninfectious agents, known and unknown, we screened sera from 16\n_Pteropus giganteus_ bats from Faridpur, Bangladesh, using\nhigh-throughput pyrosequencing. Sequence analyses indicated the\npresence of a previously undescribed virus that has approximately 50\npercent identity at the amino acid level to GB-virus A and C (GBV-A\nand -C). Viral nucleic acid was present in 5 of 98 sera (5 percent)\nfrom a single colony of free-ranging bats. Infection was not\nassociated with evidence of hepatitis or hepatic dysfunction.\nPhylogenetic analysis indicates that this 1st GBV-like flavivirus\nreported in bats constitutes a distinct species within the\n_Flaviviridae_ family and is ancestral to the GBV-A and -C virus\nclades.'\n\nThe Authors' Summary reads:\n'Bats are important reservoirs for emerging zoonotic viruses with\nsignificant impact on human health including lyssaviruses,\nfiloviruses, henipahviruses and coronaviruses.

Whereas\nprevious studies of bats have employed assays that test for known\npathogens, we present the 1st application of an unbiased molecular\napproach to pathogen discovery in this reservoir for emerging zoonotic\ndisease. Unbiased pyrosequencing of serum from _Pteropus giganteus_\nbats enabled identification of a novel flavivirus related to hepatitis\nC and GB-viruses.

Sequence\nidentification of 2 strains of the virus, tentatively named GBV-D,\nsuggests _P. giganteus_ as a natural reservoir. Detection of viral\nnucleic acid in saliva provides a plausible route for zoonotic\ntransmission. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that GBV-D is ancestral\nto GBV-A and -C, and separate from the recently classified genus\n_Hepacivirus_.

The Medical Practitioners Board of\nVictoria is expected to announce today [9 Apr 2010] that the doctor\nwas suspended as soon as health authorities realised some of his\nfemale patients had been infected with the same strain of the virus\nhe was carrying.\n\nThe Age [newspaper] believes that the Department of Health discovered\nthe link through testing of the patients' blood. A spokeswoman for\nthe board said she could not comment on how the doctor allegedly\ninfected the women, but the most common way people get hepatitis C in\nAustralia is by sharing drug-injecting equipment such as needles.\n\nIt can also be spread by needlestick injuries in healthcare settings.\nPeople who receive blood transfusions in Australia have a low risk of\ngetting hepatitis C because since February 1990, donations have been\ntested for the presence of hepatitis C virus, but people have been\nknown to contract it from unsterile procedures overseas.\n\nSexual transmission rates of hepatitis C virus are low, but the risk\nis increased with certain sexual practices or where there is the\npossibility of blood-to-blood contact.\n\nThe Victorian Department of Health recently reported a substantial\nincrease in hepatitis C infections. Its latest figures show 662 new\ncases were reported by doctors during the 2nd quarter of 2009 -- 25\nper cent more than in the same period in 2008. About 70 per cent of\npeople infected with hepatitis C [virus] may develop a chronic form\nof the [disease]. Of these people, about 1/5th will develop\ncirrhosis, which is scarring of the liver that can lead to liver cancer.\n\n[Byline: Julia Medew]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Such events are, unfortunately, not uncommon. In the present\ninstance, the mode of transmission and the condition of the patients\nhave not been revealed. Further information is awaited.\n\nHepatitis C is a strictly human disease. It cannot be contracted from\nor given to any other animal. Hepatitis C virus is spread by\nblood-to-blood contact.

The 26-year-old technician [surgical scrub nurse] is\naccused of injecting herself with painkillers meant for patients, then\nfilling the used syringes with saline solution. She was arrested\nFriday [3 Jul 2009] and appeared in court Monday to be advised of the\ncharges.\n\nThousands of patients at 2 hospitals where Parker worked were exposed,\nand 9 have tested positive for hepatitis C, according to state medical\nofficials and an investigator's affidavit. It was not known how many\nhad yet to be tested. U.S. attorney's office spokesman Jeff Dorschner\nsaid he could not comment on the case because the investigation is\nongoing.\n\nThe former technician started working at Rose Medical Center on 21 Oct\n[2008]. She was suspended on 13 Apr 2009 after authorities began\ninvestigating her, and was fired 22 Apr 2009 after testing positive\nfor the painkiller Fentyl [Fentanyl?], the affidavit said. She then\nwent to work for the Audubon Ambulatory Surgery Center in Colorado\nSprings. She was there from 4 May 2009 until Monday [6 Jul 2009].\nLeslie Teegarden, a Rose Medical Center spokeswoman, said the hospital\nis being abundantly cautious and has notified every patient who had\nsurgery while the technician worked there. Those patients are being\nasked to come in for a free blood test.\n\nAmy Triandiflou, a spokeswoman for the Audubon hospital, said they\nhired Parker before she was fired from Rose. Triandiflou said state\nhealth officials informed the Audubon hospital of the investigation\nagainst the technician on 1 Jul 2009. Rose Medical Center officials\nsaid the technician took a blood test before starting her job in\nOctober [2008], and tested positive for hepatitis C. But her attorney,\nGregory Graf, said she did not find out she had the disease until\npolice contacted her, which was sometime in April [2009]. 'If Rose\n(hospital) is indicating that she knew, then the question is, why did\nthey allow her to continue work as a surgical scrub nurse,' Graf said.\nTeegarden said people with hepatitis C are not prohibited from working\nat a hospital.\n\nThe technician, who remains in custody, will be in court again\nThursday [9 Jul 2009] for a preliminary hearing on charges of\ntampering with a consumer product, creating a counterfeit controlled\nsubstance, and obtaining a controlled substance by deception or\nsubterfuge.

He said 33 constables of the\npolice headquarters, Naushahro Feroze, were found suffering from\nhepatitis B and C after 178 samples of police constables [18.5\npercent] were scanned. About 1800 police constables remain to be\nscanned, he said.

There is a dire need that the Health Ministry\ntake immediate notice of the situation and send medical teams to\ncombat this scourge. A large quantity of medicine [for treatment] of\nhepatitis B and C is also required immediately.\n\nIt has been learned that PKR 1.5 lakh [about USD 1900] are required\nfor one patient's treatment, which poor patients cannot afford and so\nare worried about their dark future. When this correspondent visited\nthe affected villages of the district, the villagers complained that\nthey had not received even one tablet from the Civil Hospital and\nthat the tests were also not being conducted free of cost. The tests\nare expensive and beyond the reach of poor villagers.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Brent Barrett\n\n[The hepatitis B and C disease situation in the Naushahro Feroze\nDistrict of Sindh province of Pakistan is remarkably similar to that\nin Badin District of Sindh province (see: Hepatitis B & C - Pakistan:\n(SD) 20081201.3773). It is evident that hepatitis B and C disease is\nat least a provincial problem, and possibly a national problem.\n\nHepatitis B is a potentially life-threatening liver infection caused\nby hepatitis B virus. It is a major global health problem and the\nmost serious type of viral hepatitis. It can cause chronic liver\ndisease and puts people at high risk of death from cirrhosis of the\nliver and liver cancer. Hepatitis B virus is transmitted between\npeople by contact with the blood or other body fluids (i.e. semen and\nvaginal fluid) of an infected person. In developing countries, common\nmodes of transmission include: perinatal (from mother to baby at\nbirth), early childhood infections (non-apparent infection through\nclose interpersonal contact with infected household contacts), unsafe\ninjections practices, blood transfusions, and sexual contact. A\nvaccine against hepatitis B has been available since 1982. Hepatitis\nB vaccine is 95 percent effective in preventing HBV infection and its\nchronic consequences. A more detailed description is available at:\n<http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs204/en/index.html>.\n\nHepatitis C virus is a major cause of acute hepatitis and chronic\nliver disease, including cirrhosis and liver cancer. Hepatitis C\nvirus is spread primarily by direct contact with human blood. The\nmajor causes of hepatitis C virus infection worldwide are use of\nunscreened blood transfusions and re-use of needles and syringes that\nhave not been adequately sterilized. No vaccine is currently\navailable to prevent hepatitis C, and treatment for chronic hepatitis\nC is too costly for most persons in developing countries to afford.\nThus, from a global perspective, the greatest impact on hepatitis C\ndisease burden will likely be achieved by focusing efforts on\nreducing the risk of hepatitis C virus transmission from nosocomial\nexposures (e.g. blood transfusions, unsafe injection practices) and\nhigh-risk behaviors (e.g. injection drug use).

Genetic\ntesting on 4 of the cases contracting infection on the same day has\nidentified that they likely came from a common source. The patient\nthat had a procedure on a different day did not share a common source\nas did the other 4. This indicated that the problem that allowed\ndisease transmission to occur was not a one-time event but had\nrecurred over an extended period. Investigation of the clinic\npractices identified common practices that would allow disease to be\ntransmitted in this manner.\n\nSince that report, it transpires that more than 90 cases of hepatitis\nC virus infection have been identified, and more than 50 000 patients\nare being recalled for testing. Thus, this outbreak may become the\nlargest outbreak of hepatitis C virus infection in the USA. Up to the\npresent, the largest hepatitis C outbreak was a consequence of\nmalpractice at a clinic in Nebraska.

The finding\nsurprised tribal and state health officials, who responded by\ncreating an educational brochure that targets young American Indians.\n\nThe 2005-06 study, authored by IHS epidemiologist Christine Dubray,\nrevealed a 6 percent hepatitis C infection rate among women who went\nto the clinics for prenatal care. Only about one percent of people in\nthe US population has hepatitis C, Dubray said. 'We have an\nunexpected number of young women with hepatitis C infection,' she\nsaid. 'In the general American population, the prevalence of\nhepatitis C is much lower in young women.'\n\nHepatitis C is a virus that can lead to serious liver damage and\ndeath. It is spread through contact with infected blood and cannot be\ncured. 'There is a treatment for hepatitis C,' said Dubray, who is\nbased in Albuquerque, New Mexico. 'It doesn't work for everyone, but\nthere is a treatment. It's not hopeless.'\n\nDuring the 13-month period of Dubray's study, 205 women were screened\nfor the virus, and 13 tested positive. It is thought that the women,\nwho were probably exposed to the virus as teenagers or very young\nadults, contracted it through intravenous drug use. The study did not\nexamine what kind of drugs might have been used.\n\nAlthough the study examined only American Indian women, it is likely\nthat other groups of young Montanans would also have higher than\nexpected hepatitis C infection rates because of drug use, said Laura\nBaus, hepatitis C coordinator for the state Department of Public\nHealth and Human Services. 'Whether American Indian or Caucasian,\nthere's no division there,' Baus said of hepatitis C infection among\nthe state's youth. 'We're seeing it in both populations.'\n\nNationwide, the average age at a hepatitis C diagnosis ranges from 40\nto 59, Baus said. 'What we're seeing in Montana is we're averaging 15\nto 24,' she said. 'We're seeing them younger.'\n\nAbout 9000 Montanans are known to have hepatitis C, which the state\ntracks as a reportable disease. Officials think another 5000 people\nare infected but don't know it, Baus said. Symptoms often do not\ndevelop until years, and sometimes decades, after infection occurs.\n\nBetween 75 percent and 85 percent of people who are exposed to the\nvirus become what is called chronically infected, according to the\nCenters for Disease Control and Infection (CDC). The rest 'clear' the\nvirus. About 3.2 million Americans are chronically infected with\nhepatitis C. Intravenous drug use is the most common infection source.\n\nTribal and state health officials used Dubray's study for the basis\nof an educational brochure that will be distributed via Montana IHS\nclinics and other outlets on the state's reservations. 'After\nChristine's work, it was obvious we needed to do a public-health\ninitiative,' said Jennifer Giroux, an epidemiologist with the Rocky\nMountain Tribal Epidemiology Center in Billings. 'If we don't get the\ninformation out there to the public, what good is having looked?'\nGiroux asked. The brochure, an educational medium favored by CDC, was\ndesigned specifically for American Indian consumers, Baus said. 'One\nsize doesn't fit all,' she said. 'You have to gear it toward your audience.'\n\n[Byline: Diane Cochran]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Brent Barrett\n\n[Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection can cause liver inflammation\n(hepatitis) that is often asymptomatic, but ensuing chronic hepatitis\ncan result later in cirrhosis (fibrotic scarring of the liver) and\nliver cancer. Transmission of hepatitis C occurs when blood from an\ninfected person enters the body of a person who is not infected.\nHepatitis C virus is spread predominantly through sharing needles\nwhen injecting drugs, through needlestick injuries, or through\naccidental occupational injuries, or from an infected mother to her\nbaby during birth. There is no preventative vaccine, but current\nguidelines recommend that hepatitis C patients be vaccinated for\nhepatitis A and B if they have not yet been exposed to these viruses,\nas this would radically worsen their liver disease.\n\nRecent estimates indicate that hepatitis C virus infects affect 170\nmillion people worldwide and 4 million in the United States. There\nare about 35 000 to 185 000 new cases a year in the United States.\nCo-infection with HIV is common and rates among HIV positive\npopulations are higher. 10 000-20 000 deaths a year in the United\nStates are from HCV; expectations are that this mortality rate will\nincrease, as those who were infected by transfusion before HCV\ntesting become apparent.\n\nInterferon and ribavirin are 2 drugs licensed for the treatment of\npersons with chronic hepatitis C virus infection. There are 6\ngenotypes of hepatitis C virus (and sub-strains) with distinct\nprognoses and responses to treatment. Combination therapy, using\npegylated interferon and ribavirin, is currently the treatment of\nchoice. Combination therapy can get rid of the virus in about 5 out\nof 10 persons for genotype 1 and in up to 8 out of 10 persons for\ngenotypes 2 and 3.

The health district is recommending that\npatients who had procedures requiring injected anesthesia at the\nclinic between March 2004 and 11 Jan 2008 contact their primary care\nphysicians or health care providers to get tested for hepatitis C as\nwell as hepatitis B and HIV.\n\nThe health district received notification of 3 acute cases of\nhepatitis C in January 2008 and has identified a total of 6 cases to\ndate; 5 of the cases had procedures requiring injected anesthesia\non the same day. Following a joint investigation with the Nevada\nState Bureau of Licensure and Certification (BLC) and with\nconsultation from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the\nhealth district determined that unsafe injection practices related to\nthe administration of anesthesia medication might have exposed\npatients to the blood of other patients. The exposures did not result\nfrom the [other] medical procedures performed.\n\nThe cluster of illnesses came to the attention of the health district\nin January 2008. These cases were reported to the health district by\narea physicians. Nevada law requires that medical providers notify\npublic health officials when they identify a number of different\ndiseases, including hepatitis C. The common link between cases was\nidentified through the routine investigation of the cases reported by\nmedical providers, which includes an interview of the patient. Most\npeople infected with hepatitis C virus do not develop symptoms and do\nnot know that they have been infected. As a result, these infections\nwould not have been reported to the health district. An infection\nwith hepatitis C that results in the patient developing symptoms\n(acute disease) is rare, so it is an unusual occurrence that brought\nthis problem to the attention of the health district. On average, 2\ncases of acute hepatitis C are reported each year in Clark County;\n6 cases have been identified in relation to this investigation.\n\nA syringe (not a needle) that was used to administer medication to a\npatient was reused on the same patient to draw up additional\nmedication. The process of redrawing medication using the same\nsyringe could have contaminated the vial from which the medicine was\ndrawn with the blood of the patient. The vial, which was not labeled\nfor use on multiple patients, was then used for a 2nd patient (with a\nclean needle and syringe). If that vial was contaminated with the\nblood of the 1st patient, any subsequent patients given medication\nfrom that vial could have been exposed to bloodborne pathogens. [At\nthis point in the original text, the process of contamination is\nillustrated by downloadable diagram. - Mod.CP]\n\nOf the 6 known cases, 5 had procedures on the same day. Genetic\ntesting on 4 of the cases from that day has identified they likely\ncame from a common source. The patient that had a procedure on a\ndifferent day does not share a common source as the other 4. This\nindicates that the problem that allowed disease transmission to occur\nwas not a one-time event but had recurred over an extended period.\nInvestigation of the clinic practices identified common practices\nthat would allow disease to be transmitted in this manner.\n\nThe unsafe injection practices associated with these cases were\nidentified during the investigation conducted in mid-January 2008.\nThe injection practices that led to the exposure have been\ncorrected, so no new patient exposures should be occurring. As it can\ntake several months for the symptoms of hepatitis C to appear,\nadditional cases might be identified despite no ongoing transmission\nof disease. The investigation revealed practices that could have\nexposed patients to the blood of another patient.\n\nAlthough hepatitis C was the focus of the investigation, hepatitis B\nand HIV can be transmitted in the same manner. It is unknown how many\npeople were infected at the clinic. Hepatitis C, B and HIV are\nroutinely found in the population. A significant number of people\nmight have been infected prior to their procedure. Although testing\ncan determine whether a person is infected, it cannot determine the\nsource of the infection.\n\nHepatitis C, B or HIV can result in a range of disease severity and\ncan eventually result in death. It is important that patients speak\nwith a physician or health care provider if they have one of these\ndiseases. A physician will be able to address specific risks for\nserious illness and develop a plan to monitor patients' health.\n\nOn average, 2 cases of acute hepatitis C are identified each year in\nClark County. Most people who become infected with hepatitis C\ninitially have mild or no symptoms and do not know that they have\nbeen infected unless they are tested by a doctor. Only a small\npercentage of people infected with hepatitis C develop acute disease\nand have any outward signs of infection.\n\nThe Southern Nevada Health District is responsible for investigating\nreports of illness in our community in order to take steps to protect\nthe health and well-being of the public. Once notified of a\nreportable disease, the health district begins an investigation and\nworks with the appropriate agencies to address any issues identified\nand make recommendations to help prevent this type of situation from\noccurring again.\n\nWhen proper injection practices are followed, medical procedures,\nincluding colonoscopies or similar procedures, are generally safe.\nAll health care professionals and medical facilities should follow\nsafe injection practices and infection control procedures.

The children were receiving treatment in the hemodialysis\nunit. A failure in the hygiene protocol, which was not noticed by the\nnurse, resulted in contact with contaminated material. The medical\ndirector of the public hospital, Pilar Solans, said yesterday [6 Dec\n2007] that in spite of all investigations conducted thus far 'we have\nnot been able to establish the exact cause' leading to the chain of infection.\n\n'Obviously, at some point in the process, there was a problem,' added\nSolans, who refused to talk about medical malpractice and defended\nthe 'professionalism' of nurses. Even so, the hospital has decided to\n'review and strengthen' some 'key points' of the protocol in order to\navoid a new setback. The incident occurred in March [2007], and\ninvestigation has not yet been completed. The center has cited 18\nother children who were on dialysis during the same dates. Of these\n18 children, 14 have been tested and are free of the virus. The\nreview of the other 4 children will end today [7 Dec 2007]. Solans\nruled out infection because their contact with the unit was indirect.\n\nThe main hypothesis of the investigation is directed at the practice\nof sharing an ampoule of antibiotic that was administered to the 1st\nchild affected, according to yesterday's [6 Dec 2007] report in El\nPeriodico de Catalunya. Hospital officials mentioned at a press\nconference that there are a multitude of possible causes. 'Everything\nin contact with blood carries a risk,' said Magda Campins, head of\nPreventive Medicine. Moreover, about 16 percent of patients who\nundergo hemodialysis end up being carriers of hepatitis C virus,\n'either by infection [prior to hemodialysis], infection [as a result\nof hemodialysis] or any other reason,' argued hospital sources.\n\nAlthough the hospital has not had any cases in 15 years, Solans\nadmitted that 'zero risk does not exist' and that, by signing the\ninformed consent, the parents acknowledge the possibility of\ninfection [presumably, information provided at the time of informed\nconsent - Mod.MPP]. Thus, it is unlikely the parents will file a\ncomplaint against the hospital for alleged malpractice.\n\nChildren who receive dialysis in Vall d'Hebron belong to the kidney\ntransplant program: their blood is filtered -- since their kidneys\nare non-functional -- while they are waiting for a matching donor\nkidney for transplantation. The 3 children infected with hepatitis C\nhave already received the desired kidney transplant.\n\nThe hemodialysis unit is equipped with 5 machines and 5 beds, which\nare served by 2 nurses and one assistant. The directors of the\nhospital denied yesterday [6 Dec 2007] that the hygienic protocol\nfailure [use of single vial antibiotics for multiple patients] was\nrelated to an excessive workload endured by professionals. Solans\nsaid that the hospital exceeds the established requirements, since\nthe usual ratio is one nurse for every 4 machines. In general, the\nmachines are not operating simultaneously. The hospital performs\nabout a thousand hemodialysis sessions each year.\n\nHepatitis C virus was discovered in 1988. Prior to its\nidentification, the disease caused by infection with hepatitis C\nvirus was known as non A non B-hepatitis. Shortly thereafter, the\nneed to analyze the blood to be used in transfusions and the cleaning\nof medical equipment to prevent transmission were identified.\nHepatitis C virus is transmitted through blood, similar to HIV (which\ncauses AIDS), but it is much more easily transmitted.\n\nAccording to many sentences handed down in recent years, those who\nsuffer infection transmitted in the hospital setting [nosocomial\ninfections - Mod.MPP] are entitled to be compensated, according to\nOriol Guell.

At total\nof 3 people treated by the doctor in August 2006 were diagnosed with\nhepatitis C in recent months, the health department said. Laboratory\ntests and other evidence suggest they were infected while getting\nintravenous anesthesia drugs during outpatient medical procedures,\naccording to the agency.\nAuthorities have not identified the anesthesiologist. A state Health\nDepartment spokeswoman, Claudia Hutton, said the agency had not\nestablished 'that the doctor is guilty of doing anything wrong.' The\ndoctor has had a medical license since 1977 and 'does not have a\nhistory of spreading infection,' Hutton said.\nCity authorities said they were contacting everyone treated by the\nsame anesthesiologist while he or she practiced at 10 different\nmedical offices in New York City, from 1 Dec 2003 to 1 May 2007. The\ndoctor has stopped practicing during the investigation, the city\nhealth department said.\n'Transmission of hepatitis in a medical setting is rare, but as a\nprecaution we are reaching out to anyone who could have potentially\nbeen exposed,' Dr. Marci Layton, the agency's assistant commissioner\nfor communicable disease, said in a statement.

It added that action must be taken now\nto combat rising mortality.\n'The annual infection rate is more than 70 000 new cases, of which at\nleast 35 000 would have chronic hepatitis C,' said Dr. Manal\nel-Sayed, Professor of Pediatrics at Cairo's Ain Shams University and\nmember of the National Hepatitis Committee, which is currently\nformulating an action plan to fight the disease.\nHepatitis C virus is a lethal virus which can cause liver cirrhosis\nand cancer. Egypt has one of the highest prevalence rates of the\nvirus in the world, say specialists. An estimated 10-15 percent of\nthe population, some 8-10 million people, are carrying hepatitis C\nvirus antibodies, meaning that they either have or at one time had\nthe virus. Five million of those are actively infected, according to\ngovernment figures. No vaccine is available for HCV although it can\nbe treated with a combination of drugs if detected early enough.\nEgypt's very high prevalence of HCV is largely the legacy of\ngovernment campaigns prior to 1980 to treat rural populations for\nschistosomiasis (or bilharzia), a water-borne disease which at one\ntime was endemic in Egypt. The treatment campaigns, which involved\nrepeated injections, did not follow rigorous hygiene standards and as\nsuch spread blood-borne HCV throughout the population.\nAs it may take up to 30 years for a patient to display symptoms of\nHCV infection or for the disease to become active, the full extent of\nthe problem has only recently become known. 'The main risk factor,\naccording to all the studies done in Egypt, is treatment in the past\nfor schistosomiasis,' said Dr. Amr Kandeel, Director of the\nCommunicable Disease Department at the Egyptian Ministry of Health\nand Population. 'At that time, the Ministry treated people in the\nvillages without using disposable syringes,' he added.\nIn addition to cases among the older population, new infections are\nstill being recorded, due to poor medical practices and behavioral\nfactors. Deaths from liver disease are, therefore, expected to\nincrease in Egypt within the next 20 years. 'If we consider that by\nthe year 2020 we are going to have so many patients who are having\nliver failure and liver cancer, treating them now is more effective\nthan leaving them to that outcome,' said el-Sayed.\nEgypt's hepatitis committee is now making plans to prevent and treat\nhepatitis C. Treatment of HCV is usually done with a drug called\nInterferon [interferon-alpha?]. However, the most typical type of HCV\nin Egypt has about a 40 percent resistance to the drug. Although\nresearch is ongoing, no more effective treatment is yet available.\nNevertheless, the committee has succeeded in brokering a deal with\nthe manufacturers of Interferon to supply the drug to Ministry of\nHealth hospitals for 1/3rd of the usual price, and treatment under\nthe committee's program has begun in selected centers.\nEven with the cost of Interferon reduced, the financial burden of\nEgypt's HCV problem is huge. The committee estimates that of the 5\nmillion people actively infected with the virus, around one million\ncurrently need treatment. A year's treatment for a person with signs\nof liver damage from HCV costs around LE 25 000 (about USD 4500), a\nsum few can afford.\nIn January this year [2007], the committee began fundraising\nactivities with the help of NGOs [non-governmental organizations] and\ninternational organizations including USAID [United States Agency for\nInternational Development], the World Health Organization and UNICEF.\nThe committee hopes to be able to provide free treatment to those most in need.\n'We would also like to appeal to the international community to help\nwith this campaign by whatever means possible,' said el-Sayed. Due to\nthe cost and difficulty of treating chronic HCV patients, promoting\nawareness to prevent the disease, and detecting those infected before\nthey develop liver damage are critical factors. 'We are going to\npromote screening for high-risk populations, including healthcare\nprofessionals who are at risk from needle injuries, and those who are\nundergoing repeated blood transfusion treatment,' said el-Sayed. The\nhepatitis committee has stressed the need for good infection control\nprograms in hospitals and among healthcare professionals to stem the\ntransmission of the virus. The Egyptian Ministry of Health is\ncooperating through its National Infection Control Program, which\nbegan in 2003.\nThose at risk of new HCV infections in Egypt are not just those in\nmedical contact with existing patients, however. The children and\nrelatives of individuals affected during the schistosomiasis campaign\nare also a high-risk group, as widespread behavioral practices --\nsuch as the re-use of syringes, sharing of toothbrushes and even\ncircumcision -- all increase the risk of contracting blood-borne\nviruses such as HIV and Hepatitis C. And although the circumcision of\ngirls is officially banned in Egypt, the practice still continues,\nplacing girls who are being circumcised at a very high risk of\ncontracting HCV. 'Sometimes there is a sort of celebration for mass\ncircumcision in certain communities. Girls are at a higher risk,\nbecause it is a very bloody procedure. However, female circumcision\nhas dramatically decreased, with more awareness and a ban by law,'\nsaid el-Sayed.\nAs part of its Unite for Children, Unite Against Aids campaign,\nUNICEF Egypt has also been trying to raise awareness of the more\ncommon dangers of contracting HCV. Changing people's behavior and\nattitudes toward blood safety is key, according to Wessam el-Beih,\nUNICEF's Unite Against Aids Egypt coordinator.\n(This IRIN report does not necessarily reflect the views of the United Nations)\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[It remains to be seen whether interferon treatment alone will have a\nsignificant effect on chronic hepatitis C virus infection in Egyptian\npatients.

The rare warning, which is upsetting many immigrant\nfamilies already dealing with severe health problems, follows the discovery\nof a strange, small cluster of hepatitis-positive dialysis patients\nidentified this month [May 2006].\n'There are 8 patients we are investigating with new infections,' said Dr\nMichael Finkelstein, an associate medical officer with Toronto Public\nHealth. 'Certainly, I would classify that as a significant number. In other\nhemodialysis units, you can see, occasionally, a patient becoming positive,\nbut even then they are not that common.' It's not clear how dialysis\npatients who use the facilities run by Scarborough Hospital would have\nbecome infected with the hepatitis B or C [virus infection] that's showed\nup in recent routine tests. 'We don't know how this happened,' said Sherian\nMondesir, a spokeswoman for Scarborough Hospital. She added that 'we can't\nsay it's necessarily linked to our practices.'\nLike other dialysis centers, Scarborough Hospital uses clean, modern\nequipment. No source of possible contamination has been identified, but\nofficials are now taking many precautions, such as testing staff members\nand testing and retesting all of the dialysis patients. While hepatitis\noften lies dormant or is treatable, it can also lead to disabling liver\nfailure, and even death. That's why the public health department has\ncirculated letters in English, Chinese, Tamil and Tagalog (or Filipino)\nwarning patients they should guard against any further spread of hepatitis,\nwhich may have been disseminated during dialysis treatments.\nExperts say it's unlikely that the cluster will grow far beyond the 8\ncases, but the news has caused panic in some families. Infection is a\nconstant worry for all hemodialysis patients, who spend up to 5 hours a\nday, 3 times a week, having their blood pumped through plastic tubes and\ncleaning machines, in rooms full of other people with kidney disease\ngetting the same treatment.\nThe hepatitis virus [hepatitis B and C viruses] is carried in the blood,\nbut can survive outside the body for days. It can pass between hosts\nthrough sex, intravenous needles, and contaminated hospitals. That's why\ngreat care is taken to make sure all facilities and equipment are kept free\nof even small traces of blood. Yet traces can always remain, and it's\ndifficult to pinpoint causes of infection. Ms Mondesir said the hospital\ncontinues 'to follow our infection control and safety measures,' but staff\nare now being more vigilant. She said she is confident that Scarborough\nHospital's dialysis equipment is clean, and this view is supported by Dr\nFinkelstein. 'There is no evidence that the equipment itself is an issue,'\nhe said, but he added there could be any number of possible other sources\nof infection. 'There is blood in the environment,' he said, adding that\nsmall amounts of blood can linger on machines, people's hands, medical\ninstruments, tubing, and clamps.\nBecause it is uncommon to see this cluster of new infections, Dr\nFinkelstein drafted the letter that was circulated to dialysis patients\nthis week. He said the initial case came to the attention of public health\nauthorities on 'the very last working day of April [2006],' and that\nauthorities worked as quickly as possible to investigate further and warn\naffected patients.\nAfter officials determined the 1st individual was a dialysis patient at\nScarborough Hospital, they probed more deeply. The hospital had just\ngathered its annual blood samples, so public health authorities were poised\nto take a closer look, and when they did, they discovered the cluster. No\none yet knows when or how the infections occurred, or when new infections\nmight show up. 'It can take up to 6 months for some of these infections to\nbe detectable in a lab sample,' Dr Finkelstein said.\n[byline: Colin Freeze]\n******\n[2]\nDate: Sun 21 May 2006\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: AM640 Toronto Radio, Sat 20 May 2006 [edited]\n<http://www.640toronto.com/news/metro.cfm?cat=7428218912&rem=38425>\n\nHepatitis outbreak in Scarborough Hospital\n------------------------------------------\nEight confirmed cases of hepatitis B and C in a Scarborough hospital have\nofficials trying to piece together how the virus was spread.

The letter continues to say\nthat the hospital detected the infections and that they 'occurred in the\npast year.'\nAccording to Dr Gordon Nagai, who works in the Scarborough Regional\nDialysis Program, the results are startling. 'I think it's important to\nknow this is the 1st time we've ever found anything in 10 years,' Nagai\nsaid. 'But clearly, it's a very unusual circumstance, so we're quite\nconcerned why something has changed.' Nagai told CTV's Monica Matys that\nthey are searching for the source of the infection. A staff member could be\nthe source, and the entire staff is being tested. However, the infection\ncould be coming from another place. 'It's definitely not a problem with the\nmachines; that's been identified,' Nagai said. Every dialysis patient is\nbeing tested for both hepatitis B and C. As a further precaution, they are\nalso testing for HIV during regular dialysis sessions.\n'All the measures seem to indicate that we're looking after the problem\nquite adequately,' Nagai said. 'This has been reviewed by internal people\nand been reviewed by public health. So at the moment, we're quite confident\nthat everything is being done to contain the problem.'

Dr.\nCastilla said that the most feasible explanation was that the 7 patients\ninfected were part of a group, comprising 18 cancer patients, who were\ntogether in the same Hospital Department.

Concerning the 228\nunits of blood from 99 people suspected of being infected with human\nimmunodeficiency virus (HIV), it is likely that the screening EIA was\nrepeat reactive, and the immunoblot was negative. These people are\nextremely likely not to be infected with HIV and are counseled accordingly!\nNevertheless, all countries I am aware of forbid transfusion of blood units\nwhich are not unequivocally negative. Blood units are not unequivocally\nnegative if the screening EIA is repeat reactive. The theoretical risk is\nthat [though] the EIA is supposed to be somewhat more sensitive, there\nmight be a very short time period during which a recently infected person\nmay have a reactive EIA which cannot yet be confirmed by immunoblot.\nTransfusing the EIA reactive units would mean breaking the rules, but it is\nunlikely that the transfusion recipients were exposed to a significant risk.\nIf indeed 76 677 units of blood from hepatitis C virus-infected donors had\nbeen distributed for transfusion, then it is difficult to believe that only\n8 recipients were infected. Reference to the donors' disease history could\npossibly mean that the donors for these 8 infected recipients had hepatitis\nC virus infection in the past, and that they lost their antibodies but were\nstill infectious in subsequent donations. It could mean that disease\nhistory of hepatitis (which is different from hepatitis virus infection)\nwas ignored.\nIn Germany, any donor with unexplained hepatitis in the past is excluded\nfrom blood donation on a permanent basis. It is unlikely that this applies\nfor the cases described, because hepatitis due to hepatitis C virus\ninfection should be positive in the infectious disease tests most of the\ntime. Donors might have been in the serologic window phase of early\ninfection, which is only recognizable with nucleic acid amplification\ntests. If these were not done, the presence of a small percentage of\ninfectious donors in the serologic window phase would have been\nunavoidable, and hence, there would be no failure.\nScreening could have been performed improperly, but then the comment on\ndonors'\u0099 history would make no sense.

But what happened over the next 2 months wasn't\nso routine: The 79-year-old retired ironworker developed a hepatitis\nC infection that ultimately took his life on Christmas Day [25 Dec\n2004]. The patient's death -- one of just 6 hepatitis C-related\nfatalities officially recorded in Maryland since 1999 -- is drawing\nnew attention to an unusual medical mystery under investigation by\nthe Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene.\nOfficials have traced the patient's infection to a single vial of\ntechnetium-99m, a radioactive isotope injected into the bloodstream\nduring stress tests and other routine diagnostic procedures.\nInvestigators won't say how many people have been infected, or where\nthey live. However, the company whose Timonium pharmacy prepared the\nsuspect isotope said the state has identified at least 12 people in\nthe Baltimore area. The 79-year old patient, who lived in Brooklyn\nPark, is the only fatality.\nThe case has baffled physicians and nuclear medicine experts, who say\nthey can recall no other instance in which a common radioactive\nisotope has become contaminated with [a] hepatitis [virus]. 'It's\nvery unusual and not expected at all,' says Fadia Shaya of the\nUniversity of Maryland School of Pharmacy, who chairs the state's\nadvisory council on hepatitis C. 'This kind of thing should not\nhappen.'\nHepatitis C, a liver disease caused by a virus of the same name, is\ntypically transmitted through infected blood or semen. The disease\nkills as many as 10 000 people in the U.S. each year. The majority of\nnew infections are contracted through illicit drug use. The vial of\ntechnetium-99m that officials suspect as the cause of the infection\nhere was prepared at a so-called nuclear pharmacy in Timonium.\nOperated by Cardinal Health of Dublin, Ohio, the pharmacy specializes\nin preparing radioactive 'tracers' for a variety of diagnostic tests.\nThe company has temporarily closed the business until investigators\nhave pinpointed the source of the virus.\nJohn Hammond, a spokesman for the Department of Health and Mental\nHygiene, said the hepatitis C outbreak does not pose a public health\nrisk and was confined to the small number of people injected with\nserum from the tainted vial. Maryland, he said, recorded 26 cases of\nhepatitis C in 2004, including those in the recent outbreak. The\nstate reported 9 cases the previous year and 14 cases in 2002.\nOne of the central mysteries is how the radioactive isotope could\nhave become contaminated, especially since the preparation of\ntechnetium-99m is considered to be a straightforward process. 'How in\nthe world did this happen?' says Nicki Hilliard, a nuclear pharmacist\nat the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences. 'It's bizarre.'\nHilliard said that the isotope is typically produced in a\npinkie-sized container known as a radionucleotide generator. To\ncreate a dose, technicians pass standard saline solution through the\ngenerator, a process known as 'milking.' As a result, the generators\nthemselves are sometimes known as 'cows.' Technicians capture the\nsaline in a small vial and stir in a powdered chemical tracer. The\ntracer binds to the isotope and ferries it through the patient's\nbloodstream to the specific organ or tissue that needs to be examined.\nThe victim's widow said her husband received the isotope during a\ncardiac stress test at Arundel Heart Associates in Glen Burnie.\nBefore the test, she said, he was in good health, and the procedure\nwas considered routine. As part of the test, doctors typically inject\nthe isotope into the patient's bloodstream and ask the patient to\nwalk on a treadmill for a short period to increase the pulse rate.\nThen they examine the patient's heart using a radiation-sensitive\ncamera to track blood flow and spot potential blockages.\nDr. Paul Young-Hyman, a cardiologist at the Glen Burnie clinic, said\nthe suspect isotope arrived at the clinic in October 2004 in 8\nindividually prepared syringes, each in a lead-lined container. All 8\npatients who received the isotope on 15 Oct 2004 have since tested\npositive for hepatitis C, he said. Young-Hyman said that when word\nstarted filtering back that several patients who had stress tests\nthat day had been diagnosed with hepatitis, the clinic notified\ncounty health officials, who ultimately contacted the state.\nThe cardiologist said all the clinic's employees have tested negative\nfor the virus, and health officials have examined the clinic's\nlaboratory and found it contamination free. As a precautionary\nmeasure, however, stress tests at the clinic are now being performed\nwith a different radioactive tracer. 'I'm just hoping that people who\nneed the study don't hold back on getting it,' says Young-Hyman.\n'This case really does fall into the category of bizarre.'\nHepatitis C has an average incubation period of 6 to 8 weeks, and the\nvictim was fine until mid-November 2004, when he lost his appetite\nand started to feel nauseous, family members said. His wife initially\nchalked it up to stomach flu, from which she was just recovering. But\nwhen he didn't improve, he went to see the doctor. A few days later,\ntests came back positive for hepatitis C. Around this time, state\nhealth officials began notifying hospitals and physicians to watch\nfor signs of the disease, including fatigue, jaundice, abdominal pain\nand nausea. As his condition deteriorated in the following weeks, he\nwas admitted to North Arundel Hospital twice before finally being\ntaken to Harbor Hospital on 23 Dec 2004, and he died on Christmas Day\n[25 Dec 2004].\n[Byline: Michael Stroh]\n--\nJonathan Nash\n<jnash@qis.net>\n[Hepatitis C virus is classified as the type species of the genus\n_Hepacivirus_ in the family _Flaviviridae_.

Officials have traced the patient's infection to a single vial of\ntechnetium-99m, a radioactive isotope injected into the bloodstream\nduring stress tests and other routine diagnostic procedures. All 8\npatients who received the isotope on 15 Oct 2004 have since tested\npositive for hepatitis C, he said. The cardiologist said all the clinic's employees have tested negative\nfor the virus, and health officials have examined the clinic's\nlaboratory and found it contamination free. As thousands of other patients do every year, a patient walked into a\nGlen Burnie cardiology clinic last October [2004] for a routine\ncardiac stress test. However, the company whose Timonium pharmacy prepared the\nsuspect isotope said the state has identified at least 12 people in\nthe Baltimore area. The case has baffled physicians and nuclear medicine experts, who say\nthey can recall no other instance in which a common radioactive\nisotope has become contaminated with [a] hepatitis [virus]. ' As part of the test, doctors typically inject\nthe isotope into the patient's bloodstream and ask the patient to\nwalk on a treadmill for a short period to increase the pulse rate. One of the central mysteries is how the radioactive isotope could\nhave become contaminated, especially since the preparation of\ntechnetium-99m is considered to be a straightforward process. ' But what happened over the next 2 months wasn't\nso routine: The 79-year-old retired ironworker developed a hepatitis\nC infection that ultimately took his life on Christmas Day The\ntracer binds to the isotope and ferries it through the patient's\nbloodstream to the specific organ or tissue that needs to be examined. The vial of\ntechnetium-99m that officials suspect as the cause of the infection\nhere was prepared at a so-called nuclear pharmacy in Timonium.", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "hepatitis c"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2005-01-04 00:00:00", "2004-12-25 00:00:00", "1999-03-25 00:00:00", "2004-10-25 00:00:00", "2004-03-25 00:00:00", "2004-12-23 00:00:00", "2002-03-25 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Maryland", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Brooklyn", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Timonium", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Ohio", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Baltimore", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "U.S.", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "2204373", "headline": "PRO> Hepatitis C virus, hospital acquired - Israel (03)", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=2204373", "date": "2003-08-16 23:50:00", "main_text": "HEPATITIS C VIRUS, HOSPITAL ACQUIRED - ISRAEL (03)\n**************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\n<http://www.promedmail.org>\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\n<http://www.isid.org>\n[The following additional comments have been received in response to the\nmoderator's query appended to the posting 'Hepatitis C virus, hospital\nacquired - Israel 20030813.2016']\n[1]\nDate: Thu 14 Aug 2003\nFrom: 'Williams, Ian' <iaw3@cdc.gov\n\nA recent review\n---------------\nReported instances of transmission from hepatitis C virus infected health\ncare workers were recently reviewed in 'Alter MJ.

Letters were sent to 612 people from the\nFremont area who received treatment at [this physician's] clinic between 1\nMar 2000 and 31 Dec 2001. 'We're recommending that persons within that\nwindow period who sought care in [this doctor's] practice come back and\nhave a screening test performed,' said Dr. Tom Safranek, the state\nepidemiologist with the Nebraska Department of Health.\nPatients who received letters are asked to call (402) 941-7020 to set up an\nappointment to be tested. A special clinic has been set up to handle the\ntests. Those receiving letters also can call that number to ask questions.\n'It's a voluntary thing,' Safranek said. 'We're recommending it. We're also\nrecommending that it be done through this clinic just because it's a\ncentral point where everybody is getting a standard test. And we're making\nsome counseling and question answers available for persons who have\nquestions and want to discuss this.'\nState officials first learned of a possible cluster of an uncommon strain\nof hepatitis C virus about 3 weeks ago. Hepatitis C virus causes an\ninfection of the liver. In most patients, this infection causes no\nsymptoms. Some patients experience symptoms such as fatigue, loss of\nappetite, and a yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes. The virus can\ncause the liver to fail, but that usually takes 20 years or more, Safranek\nsaid. 'We had a cluster of people with no identifiable risk factors who had\ncontracted hepatitis C virus genotype 3A,' Safranek said. 'The one thing\nthey had in common was they had been cared for in the same medical practice.'\nSafranek said 10 individuals have been identified with 'clinic acquired'\nhepatitis C virus infection. Though 5-10 more people might have acquired\nhepatitis C virus in that fashion, a review of the records has not been\ncompleted. 'We have identified an individual who was cared for at the\nhematology oncology clinic, who was hepatitis C virus-positive prior to\ncoming to the clinic, and a person who had known risk factors for hepatitis\nC. And it looks to us like that might be the way it got introduced into the\nclinic,' Safranek said. Officials are trying to pinpoint how the disease\nwas passed from one person to the next. Safranek said the investigation\nwill look for anything the infected patients had in common such as types of\nchemotherapy and other procedures.\n'Those who test positive will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis; it is a\ndisease that is very slowly progressive,' Safranek said. 'Many, many people\nwho have this infection might not be aware they are infected. It's what I\nwould call a silent infection. Many people will live a perfectly normal\nlife without ever being aware they have a Hepatitis C infection.'\n[Byline: Tracy Buffington]\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[Further information on this incident would be welcomed.

The patients, who were\nsuffering from cancer or blood disorders, were treated at the clinic in\n2000 and 2001. Just before it shut down last month, the clinic advised 612\npatients to get tested and nearly 500 did.\nIt is possible that a clinic worker used a syringe to administer medicine\nto a patient who had hepatitis C, then drew more medicine from the same\nvial for the patient with the same syringe, Safranek said. Doing that would\ncontaminate the rest of the medicine in the vial, and infect other patients\ngiven the drug, he said. Medical charts are being examined, and current and\npast employees of the clinic are being questioned by state health\nofficials. Javed left the United States in July and returned to his native\nPakistan to attend to his ailing mother, Safranek said.\nState health officials were notified of the problem in September by an\nOmaha doctor who had two patients with hepatitis C who also were patients\nat Javed's clinic. In all, 485 people sought tests after receiving letters\nfrom the clinic. Of the others, some chose not to be tested, others may\nhave been tested by their own doctors, and others died.\nThe state said it was not aware of any deaths among the patients with\nhepatitis C. Doctors said they do not know what effect the virus would have\non the clinic's already ailing patients. Hepatitis C is a viral infection\nof the liver and the most common bloodborne infection in the United States.\nPeople who have been infected may experience fatigue, loss of appetite and\nyellowing of the skin. The virus can eventually lead to cirrhosis or cancer\nof the liver.\nHealth officials are confident no other patients have to be contacted\nbecause of changes made at the clinic in 2001, Safranek said, declining to\nelaborate.

Of the 612 patients of Dr. Tahir Javed's\noncology clinic who received letters advising them to be tested, 485 chose\nto be tested for the virus, and of these, 81 tested positive. The letters\nwere issued as part of an investigation which began when several cases of\nhepatitis C were reported from the Fremont area. Health officials found the\nmost likely link to be care given at Dr. Javed's clinic, said Dr. Tom\nSafranek, state epidemiologist with HHSS. The clinic is no longer in\noperation. The letters were sent in mid-October to patients who were\ntreated at the clinic between 1 Mar 2000 and 31 Dec 2001. HHSS offered a\ntesting clinic in Fremont 17 October 2002 through 1 November 2002.\nHepatitis C is a viral infection of the liver and the most common\nbloodborne infection in the country. The virus causes no symptoms in most\ncases and the majority of carriers do not know they are infected. Infected\nindividuals may experience fatigue, loss of appetite and yellowing of the\nskin. The virus affects the liver and can eventually lead to cirrhosis or\ncancer of the liver.\nPossible routes of transmission are being investigated, Safranek said. The\nillness is spread through blood and bodily fluids. It can be transmitted\nthrough intravenous lines or injections if proper infection control\npractices are not followed. The virus is not transmitted by casual contact.\nHepatitis C can be treated with a drug called interferon, alone or in\ncombination with the drug ribavirin. Genotype 3A of hepatitis C, which is\nwhat these patients have, shows a favorable response to treatment,\naccording to Safranek. Patients of the clinic who haven't yet been tested\nshould contact their physician or call the Health and Human Services System\nat (402) 471-9252.

The discovery\nof the hepatitis C virus (HCV) in 1989 ended a period of intensive\ninternational research efforts aimed at the elusive 'non-A, non-B'\nvirus, which was well known as a cause of post-transfusion hepatitis.\nAlthough HCV is not as infectious as hepatitis B or HIV, as many as 80%\nof affected people can become chronically infected and risk serious\nlong-term clinical sequelae, including cirrhosis and hepatocellular\ncarcinoma. This places HCV among pathogens of primary concern to human\nhealth and among the known infectious causes of cancer.\nAs with any newly identified disease, there is considerable uncertainty\nwithin the scientific community regarding prevalence, incidence, natural\ncourse, pathobiological implications, socioeconomic burden and\nmanagement of acute and chronic forms. Transmission through transfusions\nwith unscreened blood, through the use of inadequately or unsterilized\nequipment, or through needle-sharing among drug-users, is well\ndocumented. Sexual and perinatal transmission may also occur, although\nless frequently, and other modes such as those linked to social,\ncultural and behavioural practices using percutaneous procedures (e.g.\near and body piercing, circumcision, tattooing) may be important.\nThe incidence of HCV on a global scale is not well known, because acute\ninfection is asymptomatic in most cases. In areas of high endemicity for\nviral hepatitis, acute HCV infection appears to be the cause of a\nsignificant proportion of acute liver disease. Although the\nsocio-economic impact of chronic hepatitis C has only been partly\nstudied, the costs are likely to be high, as was found in studies\ndealing with chronic hepatitis B. Treatment and (when it becomes\navailable) immunization should be evaluated for cost-effectiveness.\nTreatment with interferon is effective in about 20% of patients. For the\nremaining 80%, international research efforts should focus on combined\nantiviral therapy. It must, however, be noted that 90% of patients who\nare in need of treatment today cannot afford it.\nA review of published data was undertaken in order to provide a first\nestimate of the global prevalence of hepatitis C, using as a basis the\nstudy which was considered most representative of the general population\nin each country......\nConclusion:\nHepatitis C prevalence rates from 0% to 70% have been published.\nAlthough the validity of published data is sometimes doubtful in view of\ntechnical and sampling biases, nevertheless based on the data and expert\nepidemiological judgement, WHO estimates today that a proportion in the\norder of 3% of the world population has been infected with HCV, and that\nthere are more than 170 million chronic carriers who are at risk of\ndeveloping liver cirrhosis and/or liver cancer. In view of the large\npopulation of chronic carriers, more work is needed to evaluate the\npublic health impact of HCV infection.\nHepatitis C, therefore, is a major global problem. Treatment is costly\nand at present not highly effective. A vaccine is not available.\nPrevention is therefore paramount. Measures to prevent HCV infections\ninclude:\n- Screening of blood and blood products worldwide\n- Effective use of universal precautions and barrier techniques\n- Destruction of disposable needles and adequate sterilization of\nreusable material such as syringes\n- Promotion of public education about the risks of using\nunsterilized material.\nThis preliminary review is intended to encourage the collection of more\nprecise data at the global level in order to ensure a better\nunderstanding of the hepatitis C epidemiology.
