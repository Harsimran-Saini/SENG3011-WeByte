Since the 1st case in the Omaheke region was reported in December 2017, about 137 other cases have been confirmed between March and November 2019. Out of the notified cases, one death has been recorded.\n\nMost of the reported cases in the region are from Gobabis, mainly from the Kanaan C informal settlement, where 123 cases were reported. This is as a result of a lack of clean drinking water, lack of sanitation facilities, and open-air defecation in the settlement. Responding to questions emailed to him by Nampa [Namibia Press Agency], Omaheke health director Jeremiah Shikulo said regional and district health emergency committees have been activated and are in full operation, leading and coordinating the outbreak response process with other line ministries.\n\n\"The Ministry of Agriculture, Water and Forestry has provided 4 water tanks to the community of Kanaan, which the Gobabis municipality are refilling on a regular basis. Water purification tablets are also being distributed to households on a daily basis by community health workers,\" he added. The municipality has likewise given Kanaan C informal residents permission to build their own affordable temporary toilets.\n\nAmong other attempts to combat hepatitis E in the region, campaigns on how to properly clean water containers, screening pregnant women for the virus, and health education through community health workers have been conducted at Kanaan C. Five clean-up campaigns have also been held at the informal settlement, with another one set for tomorrow [6 Dec 2019].\n\nHepatitis E is a liver disease caused by the hepatitis E virus, usually as a result of poor sanitation. The disease was declared an outbreak on [14 Dec 2017] by the health ministry.\n\n[Byline: Elvi Haihambo]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Hepatitis E is found worldwide, and different genotypes of the hepatitis E virus determine differences in epidemiology.

According to sources in the area, at least 3 people died in the last week since 17 Jun 2018, while over 300 people have been affected in the last 3 months.\n\nIt is suspected that there might have been leakage in Chittagong Water Supply and Sewage Authority (CWASA) pipeline. \"We have heard that the CWASA pipeline and sewerage line have mingled during the road development works in the area,\" said a family member of an affected person, adding, \"The authorities should check it well.\"\n\nDr Selim Akter Chowdhury, chief medical officer of Chittagong City Corporation (CCC), confirmed to The Daily Star that 3 people in Halishahar area died due to acute hepatitis in the last week [week of 18 Jun 2018]. According to Chittagong Civil Surgeon (CCS) office sources, over 300 people infected by HEV were given treatment in Bangladesh Institute of Tropical and Infectious Disease in Fauzderhat area of Chittagong since April 2018.\n\nUnder this circumstance, a team from Institute of Infectious Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) visited Halishahar area and collected blood samples from 25 affected people on May 3, said CCS, adding that they also collected the sample of drinking water.\n\nContacted, Dr SM Ali Haider, assistant professor of Gastroenterology of Chittagong Medical College Hospital, said people are infected by hepatitis E virus through water and food. \"In most cases, supporting treatment as well as complete rest and taking pure water can cure a patient, but sometimes it may turn fatal,\" he said. A patient out of 100 may die in HEV infection,\" he added.\n\nAgrabad and Halishahar areas regularly go under water during high tide, and so the underground water tanks of the houses may be contaminated with tidal water, said Dr Azizur Rahaman Siddique, Chittagong Civil Surgeon. Tidal water is contaminated in many ways including industrial effluents and human waste, he said.\n\nContacted, AKM Fazlullah, managing director of Chittagong Water Supply and Sewerage Authority (CWASA) also held the tidal water responsible for the outbreak of jaundice in Agrabad and Halishahar areas. He denied the allegation of presence of HEV in water supplied by CWASA. \"If CWASA water was contaminated by HEV, people residing in 80 percent areas of the city would have been affected,\" he said\n\nFazlullah, however, said they regularly check the pipeline of CWASA for leakage, but \"no such incident\" was traced so far in the areas.\n\nCCC chief medical officer Selim Akter Chowdhury, however, said he asked his officials to find out the reason of the death of people in the areas. \"I have heard that they were suffering from jaundice. We are looking into it,\" he said.\n\n[Byline: Arun Bikash Dey]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Hepatitis E is found worldwide, and different genotypes of the hepatitis E virus determine differences in epidemiology.

According to sources in the area, at least 3 people died in the last week since 17 Jun 2018, while over 300 people have been affected in the last 3 months.\n\nIt is suspected that there might have been leakage in Chittagong Water Supply and Sewage Authority (CWASA) pipeline. \"We have heard that the CWASA pipeline and sewerage line have mingled during the road development works in the area,\" said a family member of an affected person, adding, \"The authorities should check it well.\"\n\nDr Selim Akter Chowdhury, chief medical officer of Chittagong City Corporation (CCC), confirmed to The Daily Star that 3 people in Halishahar area died due to acute hepatitis in the last week [week of 18 Jun 2018]. According to Chittagong Civil Surgeon (CCS) office sources, over 300 people infected by HEV were given treatment in Bangladesh Institute of Tropical and Infectious Disease in Fauzderhat area of Chittagong since April 2018.\n\nUnder this circumstance, a team from Institute of Infectious Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) visited Halishahar area and collected blood samples from 25 affected people on May 3, said CCS, adding that they also collected the sample of drinking water.\n\nContacted, Dr SM Ali Haider, assistant professor of Gastroenterology of Chittagong Medical College Hospital, said people are infected by hepatitis E virus through water and food. \"In most cases, supporting treatment as well as complete rest and taking pure water can cure a patient, but sometimes it may turn fatal,\" he said. A patient out of 100 may die in HEV infection,\" he added.\n\nAgrabad and Halishahar areas regularly go under water during high tide, and so the underground water tanks of the houses may be contaminated with tidal water, said Dr Azizur Rahaman Siddique, Chittagong Civil Surgeon. Tidal water is contaminated in many ways including industrial effluents and human waste, he said.\n\nContacted, AKM Fazlullah, managing director of Chittagong Water Supply and Sewerage Authority (CWASA) also held the tidal water responsible for the outbreak of jaundice in Agrabad and Halishahar areas. He denied the allegation of presence of HEV in water supplied by CWASA. \"If CWASA water was contaminated by HEV, people residing in 80 percent areas of the city would have been affected,\" he said\n\nFazlullah, however, said they regularly check the pipeline of CWASA for leakage, but \"no such incident\" was traced so far in the areas.\n\nCCC chief medical officer Selim Akter Chowdhury, however, said he asked his officials to find out the reason of the death of people in the areas. \"I have heard that they were suffering from jaundice. We are looking into it,\" he said.\n\n[Byline: Arun Bikash Dey]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Hepatitis E is found worldwide, and different genotypes of the hepatitis E virus determine differences in epidemiology. For example, genotype 1 is usually seen in developing countries and causes community-level outbreaks, while genotype 3 is usually seen in the developed countries is zoonotic and does not generally cause outbreaks. Globally, 57 000 deaths and 3.4 million cases of acute hepatitis E are attributable to infection with hepatitis E virus genotypes 1 and 2.\n\nThe highest seroprevalence rates (number of persons in a population who test positive for the disease) are observed in regions where low standards of sanitation increase the risk for transmission of the virus. Over 60 percent of all hepatitis E infections and 65 percent of all hepatitis E deaths occur in East and South Asia, where seroprevalence rates of 25 percent are common in some age groups. - Mod.LL\n\nHealthMap/ProMED-mail map of Chittagong, Chittagong, Bangladesh: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/3449]\nSee Also\nHepatitis E - Namibia (08): (OS) more cases 20180613.5854954\nHepatitis E - Namibia (07): (OS) fatal 20180530.5828842\nHepatitis E - Namibia (06): (KH) fatal 20180418.5756055\nHepatitis E - Germany 20180417.5751275\nHepatitis E - Namibia (05): (KH) fatal 20180228.5656294\nHepatitis E - Japan: transfusion, fatal 20180227.5653008\nHepatitis E - Namibia (04): (KH) fatal 20180213.5626670\nHepatitis E - Namibia (03): (KH) fatal 20180127.5585264\nHepatitis E - Namibia (02): (KH) fatal 20180117.5566623\nHepatitis E - Namibia: (KH) fatal 20180106.5542173\n2017\n----\nHepatitis E - Namibia: (Windhoek) 20171225.5522167\nHepatitis E - Nigeria (04): (BO) 20171120.5455477\nHepatitis E - Niger (07): (DF) 20171020.5393925\nHepatitis E - UK (03): gt 3, European sausage 20170821.5264392\nHepatitis E - Bangladesh: bloodborne risk 20170819.5261528\nHepatitis E - Nigeria (03): (BO) IDP camp 20170814.5244528\nHepatitis E - Africa: (Lake Chad Basin) 20170810.5241448\nHepatitis E - Nigeria (02): (BO) WHO 20170712.5168641\nHepatitis E - Europe (02): 2005-2015 20170629.5140079\nHepatitis E - Nigeria (BO) 20170628.5136977\nHepatitis E - Nepal: (DO, KT) 20170624.5128824\nHepatitis E - Niger (06): (DF) fatal, pregnant women 20170620.5118509\nHepatitis E - Niger (05): (DF) fatal, pregnant women 20170613.5102098\nHepatitis E - India: (JK) contaminated water 20170612.5099614\nHepatitis E - Niger (04): (DF) fatal, pregnant women 20170529.5069047\nHepatitis E - UK (02): EU pork products, commentary 20170523.5057366\nHepatitis E - UK: EU pork products 20170522.5055004\nHepatitis E - France (03): rabbit source 20170517.5042542\nHepatitis E - Niger (03): (DF) fatal, pregnant women 20170506.5017895\nHepatitis E - Australia: 1st postransfusion case, zoonotic 20170426.4996999\nHepatitis E - Niger (02): (DF) fatalities, IDP 20170426.4996912\nHepatitis E - Niger: fatalities 20170423.4989073\nHepatitis E - Europe: blood donation screening 20170423.4983952\nHepatitis E - Chad (03): (SA) 20170226.4866244\nHepatitis E - Chad (02): (SA) WHO 20170125.4791758\nHepatitis E - France (02): comment 20170116.4769936\nHepatitis E - France: platelet transfusion-related 20170115.4763642\nHepatitis E - Chad: (SA) effect in pregnancy 20170105.4742073\n2016\n----\nHepatitis E - India (08): (MH) hospital employees 20160306.4072026\nHepatitis E - India (07): (JK) 20160304.4067694\nHepatitis E - India (06): (JK) 20160301.4060023\nHepatitis E - India (05): (HP) 20160229.4057669\nHepatitis E - India (04): (HP) fatal 20160224.4041873\nHepatitis E - India (03): (HP) fatal 20160221.4039250\nHepatitis E - India (02): (HP) fatalities 20160212.4016257\nHepatitis E - Bangladesh: pregnancy, increased mortality, risk factors 20160115.3938772\n.................................................sb/ll/mj/dk", "reports": [{"diseases": ["hepatitis e"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2018-06-26 00:00:00", "2018-06-17 00:00:00", "2018-06-18 00:00:00", "2018-04-16 00:00:00", "2021-05-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-08 00:00:00", "2021-03-07 00:00:00", "2021-03-06 00:00:00", "2021-03-05 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2017-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2021-03-07 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-06 00:00:00", "2021-03-05 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-08 00:00:00", "2021-03-07 00:00:00", "2021-03-06 00:00:00", "2021-03-05 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Halishahar", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "LL", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Chittagong city 's", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Chittagong", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "6119131", "headline": "PRO/EDR> Hepatitis E - Namibia (11)", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=6119131", "date": "2018-06-27 12:51:44", "main_text": "HEPATITIS E - BANGLADESH: (CHITTAGONG) CONTAMINATED WATER SUSPECTED\n*******************************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Tue 26 Jun 2018\nSource: The Daily Star [edited]\nhttps://www.thedailystar.net/city/hepatitis-e-outbreak-hits-port-city-1595317\n\n\nAn outbreak of hepatitis E virus [HEV] in Chittagong city's Halishahar and Agrabad areas for the last 3 months has put the lives of the residents at high risk.

Over 60 percent of all hepatitis E infections and 65 percent of all hepatitis E deaths occur in East and South Asia, where seroprevalence rates of 25 percent are common in some age groups. - Mod.LL\n\nHealthMap/ProMED-mail map of Chittagong, Chittagong, Bangladesh: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/3449]\nSee Also\nHepatitis E - Namibia (08): (OS) more cases 20180613.5854954\nHepatitis E - Namibia (07): (OS) fatal 20180530.5828842\nHepatitis E - Namibia (06): (KH) fatal 20180418.5756055\nHepatitis E - Germany 20180417.5751275\nHepatitis E - Namibia (05): (KH) fatal 20180228.5656294\nHepatitis E - Japan: transfusion, fatal 20180227.5653008\nHepatitis E - Namibia (04): (KH) fatal 20180213.5626670\nHepatitis E - Namibia (03): (KH) fatal 20180127.5585264\nHepatitis E - Namibia (02): (KH) fatal 20180117.5566623\nHepatitis E - Namibia: (KH) fatal 20180106.5542173\n2017\n----\nHepatitis E - Namibia: (Windhoek) 20171225.5522167\nHepatitis E - Nigeria (04): (BO) 20171120.5455477\nHepatitis E - Niger (07): (DF) 20171020.5393925\nHepatitis E - UK (03): gt 3, European sausage 20170821.5264392\nHepatitis E - Bangladesh: bloodborne risk 20170819.5261528\nHepatitis E - Nigeria (03): (BO) IDP camp 20170814.5244528\nHepatitis E - Africa: (Lake Chad Basin) 20170810.5241448\nHepatitis E - Nigeria (02): (BO) WHO 20170712.5168641\nHepatitis E - Europe (02): 2005-2015 20170629.5140079\nHepatitis E - Nigeria (BO) 20170628.5136977\nHepatitis E - Nepal: (DO, KT) 20170624.5128824\nHepatitis E - Niger (06): (DF) fatal, pregnant women 20170620.5118509\nHepatitis E - Niger (05): (DF) fatal, pregnant women 20170613.5102098\nHepatitis E - India: (JK) contaminated water 20170612.5099614\nHepatitis E - Niger (04): (DF) fatal, pregnant women 20170529.5069047\nHepatitis E - UK (02): EU pork products, commentary 20170523.5057366\nHepatitis E - UK: EU pork products 20170522.5055004\nHepatitis E - France (03): rabbit source 20170517.5042542\nHepatitis E - Niger (03): (DF) fatal, pregnant women 20170506.5017895\nHepatitis E - Australia: 1st postransfusion case, zoonotic 20170426.4996999\nHepatitis E - Niger (02): (DF) fatalities, IDP 20170426.4996912\nHepatitis E - Niger: fatalities 20170423.4989073\nHepatitis E - Europe: blood donation screening 20170423.4983952\nHepatitis E - Chad (03): (SA) 20170226.4866244\nHepatitis E - Chad (02): (SA) WHO 20170125.4791758\nHepatitis E - France (02): comment 20170116.4769936\nHepatitis E - France: platelet transfusion-related 20170115.4763642\nHepatitis E - Chad: (SA) effect in pregnancy 20170105.4742073\n2016\n----\nHepatitis E - India (08): (MH) hospital employees 20160306.4072026\nHepatitis E - India (07): (JK) 20160304.4067694\nHepatitis E - India (06): (JK) 20160301.4060023\nHepatitis E - India (05): (HP) 20160229.4057669\nHepatitis E - India (04): (HP) fatal 20160224.4041873\nHepatitis E - India (03): (HP) fatal 20160221.4039250\nHepatitis E - India (02): (HP) fatalities 20160212.4016257\nHepatitis E - Bangladesh: pregnancy, increased mortality, risk factors 20160115.3938772\n.................................................sb/ll/mj/dk", "reports": [{"diseases": ["hepatitis e"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2018-06-26 00:00:00", "2018-06-17 00:00:00", "2018-06-18 00:00:00", "2018-04-16 00:00:00", "2021-05-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-08 00:00:00", "2021-03-07 00:00:00", "2021-03-06 00:00:00", "2021-03-05 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2017-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2021-03-07 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-06 00:00:00", "2021-03-05 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-08 00:00:00", "2021-03-07 00:00:00", "2021-03-06 00:00:00", "2021-03-05 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Halishahar", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "LL", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Chittagong city 's", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Chittagong", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "6057342", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Hepatitis E - China: (HK) human, rat virus, 1st rep", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=6057342", "date": "2018-06-27 12:51:44", "main_text": "HEPATITIS E - BANGLADESH: (CHITTAGONG) CONTAMINATED WATER SUSPECTED\n*******************************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Tue 26 Jun 2018\nSource: The Daily Star [edited]\nhttps://www.thedailystar.net/city/hepatitis-e-outbreak-hits-port-city-1595317\n\n\nAn outbreak of hepatitis E virus [HEV] in Chittagong city's Halishahar and Agrabad areas for the last 3 months has put the lives of the residents at high risk. According to sources in the area, at least 3 people died in the last week since 17 Jun 2018, while over 300 people have been affected in the last 3 months.\n\nIt is suspected that there might have been leakage in Chittagong Water Supply and Sewage Authority (CWASA) pipeline. \"We have heard that the CWASA pipeline and sewerage line have mingled during the road development works in the area,\" said a family member of an affected person, adding, \"The authorities should check it well.\"\n\nDr Selim Akter Chowdhury, chief medical officer of Chittagong City Corporation (CCC), confirmed to The Daily Star that 3 people in Halishahar area died due to acute hepatitis in the last week [week of 18 Jun 2018]. According to Chittagong Civil Surgeon (CCS) office sources, over 300 people infected by HEV were given treatment in Bangladesh Institute of Tropical and Infectious Disease in Fauzderhat area of Chittagong since April 2018.\n\nUnder this circumstance, a team from Institute of Infectious Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) visited Halishahar area and collected blood samples from 25 affected people on May 3, said CCS, adding that they also collected the sample of drinking water.\n\nContacted, Dr SM Ali Haider, assistant professor of Gastroenterology of Chittagong Medical College Hospital, said people are infected by hepatitis E virus through water and food. \"In most cases, supporting treatment as well as complete rest and taking pure water can cure a patient, but sometimes it may turn fatal,\" he said. A patient out of 100 may die in HEV infection,\" he added.\n\nAgrabad and Halishahar areas regularly go under water during high tide, and so the underground water tanks of the houses may be contaminated with tidal water, said Dr Azizur Rahaman Siddique, Chittagong Civil Surgeon. Tidal water is contaminated in many ways including industrial effluents and human waste, he said.\n\nContacted, AKM Fazlullah, managing director of Chittagong Water Supply and Sewerage Authority (CWASA) also held the tidal water responsible for the outbreak of jaundice in Agrabad and Halishahar areas. He denied the allegation of presence of HEV in water supplied by CWASA. \"If CWASA water was contaminated by HEV, people residing in 80 percent areas of the city would have been affected,\" he said\n\nFazlullah, however, said they regularly check the pipeline of CWASA for leakage, but \"no such incident\" was traced so far in the areas.\n\nCCC chief medical officer Selim Akter Chowdhury, however, said he asked his officials to find out the reason of the death of people in the areas. \"I have heard that they were suffering from jaundice.

Over 60 percent of all hepatitis E infections and 65 percent of all hepatitis E deaths occur in East and South Asia, where seroprevalence rates of 25 percent are common in some age groups. - Mod.LL\n\nHealthMap/ProMED-mail map of Chittagong, Chittagong, Bangladesh: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/3449]\nSee Also\nHepatitis E - Namibia (08): (OS) more cases 20180613.5854954\nHepatitis E - Namibia (07): (OS) fatal 20180530.5828842\nHepatitis E - Namibia (06): (KH) fatal 20180418.5756055\nHepatitis E - Germany 20180417.5751275\nHepatitis E - Namibia (05): (KH) fatal 20180228.5656294\nHepatitis E - Japan: transfusion, fatal 20180227.5653008\nHepatitis E - Namibia (04): (KH) fatal 20180213.5626670\nHepatitis E - Namibia (03): (KH) fatal 20180127.5585264\nHepatitis E - Namibia (02): (KH) fatal 20180117.5566623\nHepatitis E - Namibia: (KH) fatal 20180106.5542173\n2017\n----\nHepatitis E - Namibia: (Windhoek) 20171225.5522167\nHepatitis E - Nigeria (04): (BO) 20171120.5455477\nHepatitis E - Niger (07): (DF) 20171020.5393925\nHepatitis E - UK (03): gt 3, European sausage 20170821.5264392\nHepatitis E - Bangladesh: bloodborne risk 20170819.5261528\nHepatitis E - Nigeria (03): (BO) IDP camp 20170814.5244528\nHepatitis E - Africa: (Lake Chad Basin) 20170810.5241448\nHepatitis E - Nigeria (02): (BO) WHO 20170712.5168641\nHepatitis E - Europe (02): 2005-2015 20170629.5140079\nHepatitis E - Nigeria (BO) 20170628.5136977\nHepatitis E - Nepal: (DO, KT) 20170624.5128824\nHepatitis E - Niger (06): (DF) fatal, pregnant women 20170620.5118509\nHepatitis E - Niger (05): (DF) fatal, pregnant women 20170613.5102098\nHepatitis E - India: (JK) contaminated water 20170612.5099614\nHepatitis E - Niger (04): (DF) fatal, pregnant women 20170529.5069047\nHepatitis E - UK (02): EU pork products, commentary 20170523.5057366\nHepatitis E - UK: EU pork products 20170522.5055004\nHepatitis E - France (03): rabbit source 20170517.5042542\nHepatitis E - Niger (03): (DF) fatal, pregnant women 20170506.5017895\nHepatitis E - Australia: 1st postransfusion case, zoonotic 20170426.4996999\nHepatitis E - Niger (02): (DF) fatalities, IDP 20170426.4996912\nHepatitis E - Niger: fatalities 20170423.4989073\nHepatitis E - Europe: blood donation screening 20170423.4983952\nHepatitis E - Chad (03): (SA) 20170226.4866244\nHepatitis E - Chad (02): (SA) WHO 20170125.4791758\nHepatitis E - France (02): comment 20170116.4769936\nHepatitis E - France: platelet transfusion-related 20170115.4763642\nHepatitis E - Chad: (SA) effect in pregnancy 20170105.4742073\n2016\n----\nHepatitis E - India (08): (MH) hospital employees 20160306.4072026\nHepatitis E - India (07): (JK) 20160304.4067694\nHepatitis E - India (06): (JK) 20160301.4060023\nHepatitis E - India (05): (HP) 20160229.4057669\nHepatitis E - India (04): (HP) fatal 20160224.4041873\nHepatitis E - India (03): (HP) fatal 20160221.4039250\nHepatitis E - India (02): (HP) fatalities 20160212.4016257\nHepatitis E - Bangladesh: pregnancy, increased mortality, risk factors 20160115.3938772\n.................................................sb/ll/mj/dk", "reports": [{"diseases": ["hepatitis e"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2018-06-26 00:00:00", "2018-06-17 00:00:00", "2018-06-18 00:00:00", "2018-04-16 00:00:00", "2021-05-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-08 00:00:00", "2021-03-07 00:00:00", "2021-03-06 00:00:00", "2021-03-05 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2017-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2021-03-07 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-06 00:00:00", "2021-03-05 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-08 00:00:00", "2021-03-07 00:00:00", "2021-03-06 00:00:00", "2021-03-05 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Halishahar", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "LL", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Chittagong city 's", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Chittagong", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "5890600", "headline": "PRO/EDR> Hepatitis E - Namibia (09): (ER) more cases", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=5890600", "date": "2018-06-27 12:51:44", "main_text": "HEPATITIS E - BANGLADESH: (CHITTAGONG) CONTAMINATED WATER SUSPECTED\n*******************************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Tue 26 Jun 2018\nSource: The Daily Star [edited]\nhttps://www.thedailystar.net/city/hepatitis-e-outbreak-hits-port-city-1595317\n\n\nAn outbreak of hepatitis E virus [HEV] in Chittagong city's Halishahar and Agrabad areas for the last 3 months has put the lives of the residents at high risk. According to sources in the area, at least 3 people died in the last week since 17 Jun 2018, while over 300 people have been affected in the last 3 months.\n\nIt is suspected that there might have been leakage in Chittagong Water Supply and Sewage Authority (CWASA) pipeline. \"We have heard that the CWASA pipeline and sewerage line have mingled during the road development works in the area,\" said a family member of an affected person, adding, \"The authorities should check it well.\"\n\nDr Selim Akter Chowdhury, chief medical officer of Chittagong City Corporation (CCC), confirmed to The Daily Star that 3 people in Halishahar area died due to acute hepatitis in the last week [week of 18 Jun 2018]. According to Chittagong Civil Surgeon (CCS) office sources, over 300 people infected by HEV were given treatment in Bangladesh Institute of Tropical and Infectious Disease in Fauzderhat area of Chittagong since April 2018.\n\nUnder this circumstance, a team from Institute of Infectious Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) visited Halishahar area and collected blood samples from 25 affected people on May 3, said CCS, adding that they also collected the sample of drinking water.\n\nContacted, Dr SM Ali Haider, assistant professor of Gastroenterology of Chittagong Medical College Hospital, said people are infected by hepatitis E virus through water and food. \"In most cases, supporting treatment as well as complete rest and taking pure water can cure a patient, but sometimes it may turn fatal,\" he said. A patient out of 100 may die in HEV infection,\" he added.\n\nAgrabad and Halishahar areas regularly go under water during high tide, and so the underground water tanks of the houses may be contaminated with tidal water, said Dr Azizur Rahaman Siddique, Chittagong Civil Surgeon. Tidal water is contaminated in many ways including industrial effluents and human waste, he said.\n\nContacted, AKM Fazlullah, managing director of Chittagong Water Supply and Sewerage Authority (CWASA) also held the tidal water responsible for the outbreak of jaundice in Agrabad and Halishahar areas. He denied the allegation of presence of HEV in water supplied by CWASA. \"If CWASA water was contaminated by HEV, people residing in 80 percent areas of the city would have been affected,\" he said\n\nFazlullah, however, said they regularly check the pipeline of CWASA for leakage, but \"no such incident\" was traced so far in the areas.\n\nCCC chief medical officer Selim Akter Chowdhury, however, said he asked his officials to find out the reason of the death of people in the areas. \"I have heard that they were suffering from jaundice.

Over 60 percent of all hepatitis E infections and 65 percent of all hepatitis E deaths occur in East and South Asia, where seroprevalence rates of 25 percent are common in some age groups. - Mod.LL\n\nHealthMap/ProMED-mail map of Chittagong, Chittagong, Bangladesh: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/3449]\nSee Also\nHepatitis E - Namibia (08): (OS) more cases 20180613.5854954\nHepatitis E - Namibia (07): (OS) fatal 20180530.5828842\nHepatitis E - Namibia (06): (KH) fatal 20180418.5756055\nHepatitis E - Germany 20180417.5751275\nHepatitis E - Namibia (05): (KH) fatal 20180228.5656294\nHepatitis E - Japan: transfusion, fatal 20180227.5653008\nHepatitis E - Namibia (04): (KH) fatal 20180213.5626670\nHepatitis E - Namibia (03): (KH) fatal 20180127.5585264\nHepatitis E - Namibia (02): (KH) fatal 20180117.5566623\nHepatitis E - Namibia: (KH) fatal 20180106.5542173\n2017\n----\nHepatitis E - Namibia: (Windhoek) 20171225.5522167\nHepatitis E - Nigeria (04): (BO) 20171120.5455477\nHepatitis E - Niger (07): (DF) 20171020.5393925\nHepatitis E - UK (03): gt 3, European sausage 20170821.5264392\nHepatitis E - Bangladesh: bloodborne risk 20170819.5261528\nHepatitis E - Nigeria (03): (BO) IDP camp 20170814.5244528\nHepatitis E - Africa: (Lake Chad Basin) 20170810.5241448\nHepatitis E - Nigeria (02): (BO) WHO 20170712.5168641\nHepatitis E - Europe (02): 2005-2015 20170629.5140079\nHepatitis E - Nigeria (BO) 20170628.5136977\nHepatitis E - Nepal: (DO, KT) 20170624.5128824\nHepatitis E - Niger (06): (DF) fatal, pregnant women 20170620.5118509\nHepatitis E - Niger (05): (DF) fatal, pregnant women 20170613.5102098\nHepatitis E - India: (JK) contaminated water 20170612.5099614\nHepatitis E - Niger (04): (DF) fatal, pregnant women 20170529.5069047\nHepatitis E - UK (02): EU pork products, commentary 20170523.5057366\nHepatitis E - UK: EU pork products 20170522.5055004\nHepatitis E - France (03): rabbit source 20170517.5042542\nHepatitis E - Niger (03): (DF) fatal, pregnant women 20170506.5017895\nHepatitis E - Australia: 1st postransfusion case, zoonotic 20170426.4996999\nHepatitis E - Niger (02): (DF) fatalities, IDP 20170426.4996912\nHepatitis E - Niger: fatalities 20170423.4989073\nHepatitis E - Europe: blood donation screening 20170423.4983952\nHepatitis E - Chad (03): (SA) 20170226.4866244\nHepatitis E - Chad (02): (SA) WHO 20170125.4791758\nHepatitis E - France (02): comment 20170116.4769936\nHepatitis E - France: platelet transfusion-related 20170115.4763642\nHepatitis E - Chad: (SA) effect in pregnancy 20170105.4742073\n2016\n----\nHepatitis E - India (08): (MH) hospital employees 20160306.4072026\nHepatitis E - India (07): (JK) 20160304.4067694\nHepatitis E - India (06): (JK) 20160301.4060023\nHepatitis E - India (05): (HP) 20160229.4057669\nHepatitis E - India (04): (HP) fatal 20160224.4041873\nHepatitis E - India (03): (HP) fatal 20160221.4039250\nHepatitis E - India (02): (HP) fatalities 20160212.4016257\nHepatitis E - Bangladesh: pregnancy, increased mortality, risk factors 20160115.3938772\n.................................................sb/ll/mj/dk", "reports": [{"diseases": ["hepatitis e"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2018-06-26 00:00:00", "2018-06-17 00:00:00", "2018-06-18 00:00:00", "2018-04-16 00:00:00", "2021-05-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-08 00:00:00", "2021-03-07 00:00:00", "2021-03-06 00:00:00", "2021-03-05 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2017-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2021-03-07 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-06 00:00:00", "2021-03-05 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-08 00:00:00", "2021-03-07 00:00:00", "2021-03-06 00:00:00", "2021-03-05 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Halishahar", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "LL", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Chittagong city 's", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Chittagong", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "5854954", "headline": "PRO/EDR> Hepatitis E - Namibia (08): (OS) more cases", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=5854954", "date": "2018-01-27 11:40:33", "main_text": "HEPATITIS E - NAMIBIA (03): (KHOMAS) FATAL\n******************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Thu 25 Jan 2017 21:52:10\nSource: Xin Hua Net [edited]\nhttp://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2018-01/25/c_136924873.htm\n\n\nHepatitis E case in Windhoek's informal sector have risen to 490, Namibia's health ministry said [Thu 25 Jan 2018], while blaming poor sanitation for fueling the spread of diseases.

Health Minister Bernard Haufiku told a media conference that to date the outbreak has caused 2 maternal deaths, with majority of the cases coming from Havana and Goreangab settlements. \"The outbreak control and disease prevention activities are still ongoing, such as coordination, surveillance, case detection and management, wash and environmental health and social mobilization,\" he said.\n\nDirector of Health Information and Research Directorate Puumue Katjiunjo told Xinhua that currently health centers in the city get cases of suspected hepatitis E on a daily basis. \"Currently we cannot say it has been contained but efforts to reduce and contain the disease are being employed by the health ministry with the assistance of NGO agencies,\" he said.\n\nThe ministry encouraged the community in affected areas to continue with preventative measures including purifying drinking water and practicing healthy sanitary exercises. Poor sanitation has been blamed for fueling disease outbreaks in Namibia, with the health ministry saying 68 percent households in the country's informal settlements still practise open defecation. It also stated that 92 percent of households in the informal sector collect water from communal taps and 2 percent from unsafe water sources, compared with 6 percent that have household taps.\n\nKatjiunjo said that 55 percent of water samples collected at point of use tested positive for total coliforms, an indication of fecal contamination. A representative from Windhoek's City Authorities told Xinhua that currently the city is rehabilitating old toilets and cleaning up communities to assist in the prevention of further disease outbreaks.\n\nNamibia experienced its 1st hepatitis E outbreak in 1983 in Rundu, where 9 cases were confirmed, and the last outbreak was experienced in 1995-1996 also in Rundu. United Nations Resident Coordinator to Namibia Kiki Gbeho on [Thu 25 Jan 2017] said the UN is ready to assist the Namibian government's response to the Hepatitis E outbreak.\n\n[Byline: Yurou]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n[Hepatitis E is found worldwide, and different genotypes of the hepatitis E virus determine differences in epidemiology.

Bellio said the highly contagious disease, which infiltrated the camp from Niger, spread through Ngala camp due to a combination of poor living conditions and flooding.\n\nAccording to Bellio, the camp shelters some 45 000 people who have fled violence stemming from the conflict between Boko Haram and the military.\n\nBellio said that given the poor living conditions in the camp, it was a surprise that the number of cases had not escalated, or even led to an outbreak of cholera. \"The situation in Ngala is very worrying. The onset of the rainy season has caused repeated flooding in the camp, and water gushes across pathways, latrine holes and into people's shelters,\" Bellio said. \"When it rains, the whole camp gets covered in mud and dirty water. This is a recipe for spreading bacteria and disease, particularly as people don't always use the latrines that have been installed in the camp, so wastewater washes out everywhere. There have been more than 400 cases of hepatitis E in the past 2 months, and we have treated 170 patients at our hospital, so it's no surprise that an outbreak of hepatitis E has been declared.\"\n\nBellio also spoke of the dangers of the disease to pregnant women and instructed people on how to avoid the disease.\n\n\"Generally, people recover from hepatitis E if they receive treatment, but the disease can be very dangerous for pregnant women and their unborn babies,\" he said. \"Hepatitis E leads to high rates of spontaneous abortions and stillbirths, as well as babies being born prematurely. It can also cause severe haemorrhages in mothers, both during childbirth and after giving birth.\"\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Hepatitis E virus (HEV) genotypes 1 and 2 are the major waterborne forms of HEV, and they tend to occur in the developing world, especially Africa and Asia.

He said 8 people were found to have jaundice and their blood samples were taken for testing to Integrated Disease Surveillance Program (IDSP) laboratory in Barzulla Srinagar. \"Out of 8, 5 have so far tested positive for [hepatitis E] infection while the reports of other suspected cases is awaited,\" said Dr Zahoor. He said that the medical teams have been stationed in the allopathic dispensary in the village and they were monitoring the situation.\n\nDoctors attribute the consumption of highly contaminated water by the villagers as the reason for the outbreak. \"We also took 3 water samples for testing and the reports of samples is awaited,\" said BMO. He said that the people need not to panic but only consume boiled water and maintain proper hygiene.\n\n[Byline: Sameer Ahmad]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Hepatitis E is found worldwide, and different genotypes of the hepatitis E virus determine differences in epidemiology. For example, genotype 1 is usually seen in developing countries and causes community-level outbreaks, while genotype 3 is usually seen in the developed countries is zoonotic and does not generally cause outbreaks. Globally, 57 000 deaths and 3.4 million cases of acute hepatitis E are attributable to infection with hepatitis E virus genotypes 1 and 2.\n\nThe highest seroprevalence rates (number of persons in a population who test positive for the disease) are observed in regions where low standards of sanitation increase the risk for transmission of the virus.

All except one seroconversion occurred between the 3rd TM and 3 months PP. The cases and 40 matched non-seroconverters (controls) underwent analysis of a panel of 10 cytokines, 12 vitamins and minerals, and 2 markers of inflammation. Throughout pregnancy, seroconverting cases displayed higher concentrations of both pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines compared with the non-seroconverting controls, even prior to infection. In the 1st TM, seroconverters had lower circulating zinc concentrations (P = 0.03), an increased prevalence of vitamin D deficiency (25-hydroxy vitamin D [25(OH)2D] less than 50 nmol/L, P = 0.08), and anemia (hemoglobin less than 110 g/L, P = 0.05) compared with controls. There were no differences in C-reactive protein or alpha-1-acid glycoprotein.

In Bangladesh, plasma samples from 1100 women during the 1st trimester (TM) and 3rd TM of pregnancy and 3 months postpartum (PP) were tested for anti-HEV IgG. During this time, 40 women developed antibody responses to HEV. These seroconverters are classified as the cases (incidence = 46 infections per 1000 person-years). All except one seroconversion occurred between the 3rd TM and 3 months PP. The cases and 40 matched non-seroconverters (controls) underwent analysis of a panel of 10 cytokines, 12 vitamins and minerals, and 2 markers of inflammation. Throughout pregnancy, seroconverting cases displayed higher concentrations of both pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines compared with the non-seroconverting controls, even prior to infection. In the 1st TM, seroconverters had lower circulating zinc concentrations (P = 0.03), an increased prevalence of vitamin D deficiency (25-hydroxy vitamin D [25(OH)2D] less than 50 nmol/L, P = 0.08), and anemia (hemoglobin less than 110 g/L, P = 0.05) compared with controls. There were no differences in C-reactive protein or alpha-1-acid glycoprotein. Antecedent micronutrient deficiencies may lead to dysregulated cytokine expression and immunologic compromise, increasing the risk of HEV infection, especially during pregnancy.

Contributing factors here may be infection in already debilitated individuals who may be chronically infected with hepatitis B or C or infection occurring in women in the 2nd or 3rd trimester of pregnancy.\n\nThis article provides some important potential insight into why there is a substantially increased maternal mortality rate related to hepatitis E virus:\n\nKmush BL, Labrique A, Li W, et al: The association of cytokines and micronutrients with hepatitis E virus infection during pregnancy and the postpartum period in rural Bangladesh.

In Bangladesh, plasma samples from 1100 women during the 1st trimester (TM) and 3rd TM of pregnancy and 3 months postpartum (PP) were tested for anti-HEV IgG. During this time, 40 women developed antibody responses to HEV. These seroconverters are classified as the cases (incidence = 46 infections per 1000 person-years). All except one seroconversion occurred between the 3rd TM and 3 months PP. The cases and 40 matched non-seroconverters (controls) underwent analysis of a panel of 10 cytokines, 12 vitamins and minerals, and 2 markers of inflammation. Throughout pregnancy, seroconverting cases displayed higher concentrations of both pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines compared with the non-seroconverting controls, even prior to infection. In the 1st TM, seroconverters had lower circulating zinc concentrations (P = 0.03), an increased prevalence of vitamin D deficiency (25-hydroxy vitamin D [25(OH)2D] less than 50 nmol/L, P = 0.08), and anemia (hemoglobin less than 110 g/L, P = 0.05) compared with controls. There were no differences in C-reactive protein or alpha-1-acid glycoprotein. Antecedent micronutrient deficiencies may lead to dysregulated cytokine expression and immunologic compromise, increasing the risk of HEV infection, especially during pregnancy. This exploratory analysis reveals potential novel associations that deserve further study.\"\n\nOf the 4 genotypes of HEV, it seems that GT 1 and 2 are the ones that are associated with this increased mortality during gestation.\n\nDiffa is an administrative region in the southeast of Niger.

To save the 58-year-old retired plumber from northern Germany, doctors replaced his blood plasma with donated plasma lacking the antibodies that targeted the donor organ. It worked, but 3 years later, it's clear that he received something else in the bargain: the hepatitis E virus (HEV).\n\nIt's a pathogen that most people get rid of easily without even getting sick. But the man was taking drugs that dampen his immune system to prevent another rejection of his heart. As a result, he can't clear the virus; it has been quietly replicating in his liver ever since. \"If that is not resolved, it leads to liver fibrosis, then liver cirrhosis, then death,\" Sven Pischke, his doctor at the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, says matter-of-factly. \"That was a shock, of course,\" the patient says.\n\nPatients like him are a new challenge for European physicians. Until a few years ago, no one even knew they existed. Hepatitis E was seen as an exotic disease that travelers from India or Africa sometimes brought home. Now, it's clear that there's a silent epidemic of the virus at home, with an estimated 300 000 people infected annually in Germany alone. Most appear to catch it from eating pork, with blood and plasma transfusions playing a smaller role. The virus occurs in other developed countries as well -- including the USA, Japan, and Australia -- though infections appear to be much rarer there.\n\nScientists are still scrambling to understand the epidemiology of hepatitis E, but they know that in Europe, infection rates rival those for other major hepatitis pathogens (A, B, and C). Two questions are looming large: Should blood donations be screened for the virus? And what can be done to eliminate it from swine herds?\n\nResearchers suspected a new form of hepatitis in 1978, when hundreds of people in Jammu and Kashmir, in northern India, got sick -- and 4 men and 6 pregnant women died -- from what appeared to be a waterborne hepatitis virus. Similar but larger outbreaks followed in India, Pakistan, and China, killing thousands of people, many of them pregnant women. It wasn't until 1983 that Russian scientist Mikhail Balayan isolated the virus from his own stool after a gutsy self-experiment: He drank a cocktail of yogurt and stool samples from Soviet soldiers infected in Afghanistan. Hepatitis E became known as an important waterborne pathogen in Asia and Africa; 2 strains, named genotype 1 and 2, together kill an estimated 58 000 people per year.\n\nBut in 1997, scientists discovered that pigs in the American Midwest carried a new strain of the virus, which they named genotype 3. It was soon identified in European pigs as well, and surveys showed that many Europeans had antibodies to it, a sign they had been infected at some point in their lives. Genotype 3 was very different from its relatives: Pork, not dirty water, appeared to be its main transmission route, and it seemed not to cause any symptoms. \"Hepatitis E does not exist,\" says Hans Zaaijer, who heads the department of bloodborne infections at Sanquin, a nonprofit blood transfusion service in Amsterdam. \"These are 2 completely distinct diseases.\" (It's not clear whether genotype 3 might also spread in developing countries, hiding in the shadow of its more obvious relatives.)\n\nAlas, the new strain wasn't as innocuous as it seemed. In 2008, French researchers reported that in a group of 300 recent transplant patients, 14 had an acute hepatitis E infection. Six got rid of the virus quickly, but 8 couldn't seem to shake it. At Hannover Medical School in Germany, hepatitis specialist Heiner Wedemeyer couldn't believe it at first. \"We are one of the largest transplantation centers in Europe,\" he remembers thinking. \"We would have seen that.\" But when he started screening patients he soon found some that were chronically infected with hepatitis E, as did other clinics all over Europe. Patients had one thing in common: a weakened immune system.\n\nThere's not much doctors can do to help them. For transplant patients, one option is lowering the doses of immunosuppressive drugs to allow the immune system to regenerate, but this increases the risk of organ rejection. Doctors also use ribavirin, a drug approved for hepatitis C and several other viral infections. But there hasn't been a controlled trial yet, and ribavirin has serious side effects.\n\nThese patients are the visible part of a much wider epidemic. Surveys have shown that 17% of adults in Germany have antibodies against the virus, meaning they became infected at some point; so do 14% in Austria, 4% in southern Italy, and 27% in the Netherlands. One Dutch study found that antibody levels in people aged 18 to 21 dropped from almost 20% in 1995 to less than 5% in 2000, then rose again to 13% in 2011, which suggests the infection is re-emerging, says Zaaijer, a co-author on the study.\n\nBlood and blood products account for at least some of the new infections. One study suggested that 1200 blood components containing the virus are transfused each year in the United Kingdom, and roughly one in 1000 blood donors in the Netherlands carries the virus. (By contrast, a recent U.S. study found the virus's genetic material in just one donor per 9500.)\n\nA much bigger risk factor is the consumption of sausages and other pork products. Hepatitis E has been shown to be ubiquitous in swine herds in many European countries. Most animals become infected without getting sick between 3 and 6 months after birth, when antibodies inherited from their mothers start to wane. And there's strong evidence that the virus is passed on to humans through pork. In one study, Wim van der Poel, a veterinary virologist at Wageningen University and Research Centre in the Netherlands, analyzed hepatitis E sequences found in Dutch blood donors between 2010 and 2015. \"When we looked for the closest sequence ever found, [it] was always a swine sequence from the same region,\" he says.\n\nWhat's unclear is which pork products carry the highest risk. In one region in the south of France, infections have been linked to consumption of figatellu, a pig liver sausage that's often eaten raw. Scientists are still trying to pinpoint which other products contain the virus. It's difficult to culture the virus from meat products, and looking directly for viral RNA is technically complicated; moreover, finding RNA does not mean the food contains intact virus that can infect a consumer. Meanwhile, some studies have also shown a risk from eating shellfish or fruit.\n\nIn the United States, in contrast, hepatitis E \"is very rare even in transplant patients and the immunosuppressed,\" says Jay Hoofnagle of the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases in Bethesda, Maryland. One theory is that U.S. residents eat less raw or undercooked pork. Another theory: Pigs in Europe may suffer from immune deficiencies because of some other infection. \"An HIV-like agent may cause pigs or wild boar to develop chronic HEV infection,\" Hoofnagle says.\n\nWith so many unknowns, controlling this silent epidemic is a challenge. Ireland already screens blood products for hepatitis E, and other countries are debating doing so. Like everything else involving the blood supply, \"it's a touchy subject,\" Pischke says. Screening is costly and may not make sense for the general population, which has little to fear from HEV, says Rainer Seitz, head of transfusion medicine at the Paul Ehrlich Institute in Langen, Germany, a federal institute responsible for blood safety. But he supports screening blood products before use in immunocompromised patients. The virus's apparent ubiquity in pork products and elsewhere in the environment also makes general blood screening questionable, Zaaijer says. \"It's like screening donors for flu in times of flu. The blood is safe, but the air isn't,\" he says. It's far more important to make food and water free of hepatitis E, he adds.\n\nOne way to do that would be to vaccinate pigs. A human vaccine has already been approved in China, and scientists think a swine vaccine is feasible as well. But getting pig farmers to adopt it would be difficult, Van der Poel predicts, because their animals don't get sick. And you'd have to be careful to vaccinate every last animal in a herd, Zaaijer adds; otherwise, the virus might just spread slowly, meaning that animals would get infected later in life, closer to slaughter, which might increase the risk in meat.\n\nReimar Johne, who studies hepatitis E at the Federal Institute for Risk Assessment in Berlin, is trying to find out how the virus can be inactivated in food. 20 minutes at 70 C [158 F] destroys it, but what about drying, smoking, or curing meat? To find out, Johne has started to make sausages in the lab himself. After adding a strain of hepatitis E, he can process the meat any way he wants and check whether viable virus survives. \"It's a bit artificial,\" he says. \"But for the moment, it's all we have.\"\n\n[Byline: Kai Kupferschmidt]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[This is an excellent posting on the zoonotic genotype 3 strain of HEV. - Mod.LL]\nSee Also\n2015\n----\nHepatitis E - France: 2013, raw pork stuffing 20151021.3733016\nHepatitis E - UK: undercooked imported pork sausage, 2014 20150908.3631747\n2014\n----\nHepatitis E - UK: undercooked pork sausage 20141111.2946919\nHepatitis E - France: (VR) raw pork liver sausage 20141010.2850748\nHepatitis E - Australia: (NSW), undercooked pork liver 20140914.2773538\nHepatitis E - Germany: genotype 3, transfusion related 20140529.2506353\n2013\n----\nHepatitis E - UK: pork sausages, alert 20130915.1946331\n.................................................ll/msp/lm", "reports": [{"diseases": ["unknown", "other", "hepatitis c", "hepatitis e"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2016-03-16 00:00:00", "1978-03-16 00:00:00", "1983-03-16 00:00:00", "1997-03-16 00:00:00", "2008-03-16 00:00:00", "1995-03-16 00:00:00", "2000-03-16 00:00:00", "2011-03-16 00:00:00", "2013-03-16 00:00:00", "2014-03-16 00:00:00", "2014-03-16 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Jammu", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Ireland", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Maryland", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "India", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "China", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Bethesda", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "France", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "U.S.", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "the United States", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Austria", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "USA", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Berlin", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Afghanistan", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Australia", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Germany", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Amsterdam", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "the United Kingdom", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Langen", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Italy", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Pakistan", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Netherlands", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Japan", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "4866244", "headline": "PRO/EDR> Hepatitis E - Chad (03): (SA)", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=4866244", "date": "2016-08-28 19:03:33", "main_text": "HEPATITIS E - EUROPE: ZOONOTIC\n******************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Fri 26 Aug 2016\nSource: Science Vol. 353, Issue 6302, pp. 862-863 [edited]\nhttp://science.sciencemag.org/content/353/6302/862.full\n\n\nAlmost immediately after a man received a new heart, his body began to reject it.

To save the 58-year-old retired plumber from northern Germany, doctors replaced his blood plasma with donated plasma lacking the antibodies that targeted the donor organ. It worked, but 3 years later, it's clear that he received something else in the bargain: the hepatitis E virus (HEV).\n\nIt's a pathogen that most people get rid of easily without even getting sick. But the man was taking drugs that dampen his immune system to prevent another rejection of his heart. As a result, he can't clear the virus; it has been quietly replicating in his liver ever since. \"If that is not resolved, it leads to liver fibrosis, then liver cirrhosis, then death,\" Sven Pischke, his doctor at the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, says matter-of-factly. \"That was a shock, of course,\" the patient says.\n\nPatients like him are a new challenge for European physicians. Until a few years ago, no one even knew they existed. Hepatitis E was seen as an exotic disease that travelers from India or Africa sometimes brought home. Now, it's clear that there's a silent epidemic of the virus at home, with an estimated 300 000 people infected annually in Germany alone. Most appear to catch it from eating pork, with blood and plasma transfusions playing a smaller role. The virus occurs in other developed countries as well -- including the USA, Japan, and Australia -- though infections appear to be much rarer there.\n\nScientists are still scrambling to understand the epidemiology of hepatitis E, but they know that in Europe, infection rates rival those for other major hepatitis pathogens (A, B, and C). Two questions are looming large: Should blood donations be screened for the virus? And what can be done to eliminate it from swine herds?\n\nResearchers suspected a new form of hepatitis in 1978, when hundreds of people in Jammu and Kashmir, in northern India, got sick -- and 4 men and 6 pregnant women died -- from what appeared to be a waterborne hepatitis virus. Similar but larger outbreaks followed in India, Pakistan, and China, killing thousands of people, many of them pregnant women. It wasn't until 1983 that Russian scientist Mikhail Balayan isolated the virus from his own stool after a gutsy self-experiment: He drank a cocktail of yogurt and stool samples from Soviet soldiers infected in Afghanistan. Hepatitis E became known as an important waterborne pathogen in Asia and Africa; 2 strains, named genotype 1 and 2, together kill an estimated 58 000 people per year.\n\nBut in 1997, scientists discovered that pigs in the American Midwest carried a new strain of the virus, which they named genotype 3. It was soon identified in European pigs as well, and surveys showed that many Europeans had antibodies to it, a sign they had been infected at some point in their lives. Genotype 3 was very different from its relatives: Pork, not dirty water, appeared to be its main transmission route, and it seemed not to cause any symptoms. \"Hepatitis E does not exist,\" says Hans Zaaijer, who heads the department of bloodborne infections at Sanquin, a nonprofit blood transfusion service in Amsterdam. \"These are 2 completely distinct diseases.\" (It's not clear whether genotype 3 might also spread in developing countries, hiding in the shadow of its more obvious relatives.)\n\nAlas, the new strain wasn't as innocuous as it seemed. In 2008, French researchers reported that in a group of 300 recent transplant patients, 14 had an acute hepatitis E infection. Six got rid of the virus quickly, but 8 couldn't seem to shake it. At Hannover Medical School in Germany, hepatitis specialist Heiner Wedemeyer couldn't believe it at first. \"We are one of the largest transplantation centers in Europe,\" he remembers thinking. \"We would have seen that.\" But when he started screening patients he soon found some that were chronically infected with hepatitis E, as did other clinics all over Europe. Patients had one thing in common: a weakened immune system.\n\nThere's not much doctors can do to help them. For transplant patients, one option is lowering the doses of immunosuppressive drugs to allow the immune system to regenerate, but this increases the risk of organ rejection. Doctors also use ribavirin, a drug approved for hepatitis C and several other viral infections. But there hasn't been a controlled trial yet, and ribavirin has serious side effects.\n\nThese patients are the visible part of a much wider epidemic. Surveys have shown that 17% of adults in Germany have antibodies against the virus, meaning they became infected at some point; so do 14% in Austria, 4% in southern Italy, and 27% in the Netherlands. One Dutch study found that antibody levels in people aged 18 to 21 dropped from almost 20% in 1995 to less than 5% in 2000, then rose again to 13% in 2011, which suggests the infection is re-emerging, says Zaaijer, a co-author on the study.\n\nBlood and blood products account for at least some of the new infections. One study suggested that 1200 blood components containing the virus are transfused each year in the United Kingdom, and roughly one in 1000 blood donors in the Netherlands carries the virus. (By contrast, a recent U.S. study found the virus's genetic material in just one donor per 9500.)\n\nA much bigger risk factor is the consumption of sausages and other pork products. Hepatitis E has been shown to be ubiquitous in swine herds in many European countries. Most animals become infected without getting sick between 3 and 6 months after birth, when antibodies inherited from their mothers start to wane. And there's strong evidence that the virus is passed on to humans through pork. In one study, Wim van der Poel, a veterinary virologist at Wageningen University and Research Centre in the Netherlands, analyzed hepatitis E sequences found in Dutch blood donors between 2010 and 2015. \"When we looked for the closest sequence ever found, [it] was always a swine sequence from the same region,\" he says.\n\nWhat's unclear is which pork products carry the highest risk. In one region in the south of France, infections have been linked to consumption of figatellu, a pig liver sausage that's often eaten raw. Scientists are still trying to pinpoint which other products contain the virus. It's difficult to culture the virus from meat products, and looking directly for viral RNA is technically complicated; moreover, finding RNA does not mean the food contains intact virus that can infect a consumer. Meanwhile, some studies have also shown a risk from eating shellfish or fruit.\n\nIn the United States, in contrast, hepatitis E \"is very rare even in transplant patients and the immunosuppressed,\" says Jay Hoofnagle of the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases in Bethesda, Maryland. One theory is that U.S. residents eat less raw or undercooked pork. Another theory: Pigs in Europe may suffer from immune deficiencies because of some other infection. \"An HIV-like agent may cause pigs or wild boar to develop chronic HEV infection,\" Hoofnagle says.\n\nWith so many unknowns, controlling this silent epidemic is a challenge. Ireland already screens blood products for hepatitis E, and other countries are debating doing so. Like everything else involving the blood supply, \"it's a touchy subject,\" Pischke says. Screening is costly and may not make sense for the general population, which has little to fear from HEV, says Rainer Seitz, head of transfusion medicine at the Paul Ehrlich Institute in Langen, Germany, a federal institute responsible for blood safety. But he supports screening blood products before use in immunocompromised patients. The virus's apparent ubiquity in pork products and elsewhere in the environment also makes general blood screening questionable, Zaaijer says. \"It's like screening donors for flu in times of flu. The blood is safe, but the air isn't,\" he says. It's far more important to make food and water free of hepatitis E, he adds.\n\nOne way to do that would be to vaccinate pigs. A human vaccine has already been approved in China, and scientists think a swine vaccine is feasible as well. But getting pig farmers to adopt it would be difficult, Van der Poel predicts, because their animals don't get sick. And you'd have to be careful to vaccinate every last animal in a herd, Zaaijer adds; otherwise, the virus might just spread slowly, meaning that animals would get infected later in life, closer to slaughter, which might increase the risk in meat.\n\nReimar Johne, who studies hepatitis E at the Federal Institute for Risk Assessment in Berlin, is trying to find out how the virus can be inactivated in food. 20 minutes at 70 C [158 F] destroys it, but what about drying, smoking, or curing meat?

After adding a strain of hepatitis E, he can process the meat any way he wants and check whether viable virus survives. \"It's a bit artificial,\" he says. \"But for the moment, it's all we have.\"\n\n[Byline: Kai Kupferschmidt]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[This is an excellent posting on the zoonotic genotype 3 strain of HEV. - Mod.LL]\nSee Also\n2015\n----\nHepatitis E - France: 2013, raw pork stuffing 20151021.3733016\nHepatitis E - UK: undercooked imported pork sausage, 2014 20150908.3631747\n2014\n----\nHepatitis E - UK: undercooked pork sausage 20141111.2946919\nHepatitis E - France: (VR) raw pork liver sausage 20141010.2850748\nHepatitis E - Australia: (NSW), undercooked pork liver 20140914.2773538\nHepatitis E - Germany: genotype 3, transfusion related 20140529.2506353\n2013\n----\nHepatitis E - UK: pork sausages, alert 20130915.1946331\n.................................................ll/msp/lm", "reports": [{"diseases": ["unknown", "other", "hepatitis c", "hepatitis e"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2016-03-16 00:00:00", "1978-03-16 00:00:00", "1983-03-16 00:00:00", "1997-03-16 00:00:00", "2008-03-16 00:00:00", "1995-03-16 00:00:00", "2000-03-16 00:00:00", "2011-03-16 00:00:00", "2013-03-16 00:00:00", "2014-03-16 00:00:00", "2014-03-16 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Jammu", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Ireland", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Maryland", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "India", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "China", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Bethesda", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "France", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "U.S.", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "the United States", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Austria", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "USA", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Berlin", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Afghanistan", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Australia", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Germany", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Amsterdam", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "the United Kingdom", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Langen", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Italy", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Pakistan", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Netherlands", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Japan", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "4769936", "headline": "PRO> Hepatitis E - France (02): comment", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=4769936", "date": "2016-08-28 19:03:33", "main_text": "HEPATITIS E - EUROPE: ZOONOTIC\n******************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Fri 26 Aug 2016\nSource: Science Vol. 353, Issue 6302, pp. 862-863 [edited]\nhttp://science.sciencemag.org/content/353/6302/862.full\n\n\nAlmost immediately after a man received a new heart, his body began to reject it.

The virus occurs in other developed countries as well -- including the USA, Japan, and Australia -- though infections appear to be much rarer there.\n\nScientists are still scrambling to understand the epidemiology of hepatitis E, but they know that in Europe, infection rates rival those for other major hepatitis pathogens (A, B, and C). Two questions are looming large: Should blood donations be screened for the virus? And what can be done to eliminate it from swine herds?\n\nResearchers suspected a new form of hepatitis in 1978, when hundreds of people in Jammu and Kashmir, in northern India, got sick -- and 4 men and 6 pregnant women died -- from what appeared to be a waterborne hepatitis virus. Similar but larger outbreaks followed in India, Pakistan, and China, killing thousands of people, many of them pregnant women. It wasn't until 1983 that Russian scientist Mikhail Balayan isolated the virus from his own stool after a gutsy self-experiment: He drank a cocktail of yogurt and stool samples from Soviet soldiers infected in Afghanistan. Hepatitis E became known as an important waterborne pathogen in Asia and Africa; 2 strains, named genotype 1 and 2, together kill an estimated 58 000 people per year.\n\nBut in 1997, scientists discovered that pigs in the American Midwest carried a new strain of the virus, which they named genotype 3. It was soon identified in European pigs as well, and surveys showed that many Europeans had antibodies to it, a sign they had been infected at some point in their lives. Genotype 3 was very different from its relatives: Pork, not dirty water, appeared to be its main transmission route, and it seemed not to cause any symptoms. \"Hepatitis E does not exist,\" says Hans Zaaijer, who heads the department of bloodborne infections at Sanquin, a nonprofit blood transfusion service in Amsterdam. \"These are 2 completely distinct diseases.\" (It's not clear whether genotype 3 might also spread in developing countries, hiding in the shadow of its more obvious relatives.)\n\nAlas, the new strain wasn't as innocuous as it seemed. In 2008, French researchers reported that in a group of 300 recent transplant patients, 14 had an acute hepatitis E infection. Six got rid of the virus quickly, but 8 couldn't seem to shake it. At Hannover Medical School in Germany, hepatitis specialist Heiner Wedemeyer couldn't believe it at first. \"We are one of the largest transplantation centers in Europe,\" he remembers thinking. \"We would have seen that.\" But when he started screening patients he soon found some that were chronically infected with hepatitis E, as did other clinics all over Europe. Patients had one thing in common: a weakened immune system.\n\nThere's not much doctors can do to help them. For transplant patients, one option is lowering the doses of immunosuppressive drugs to allow the immune system to regenerate, but this increases the risk of organ rejection. Doctors also use ribavirin, a drug approved for hepatitis C and several other viral infections. But there hasn't been a controlled trial yet, and ribavirin has serious side effects.\n\nThese patients are the visible part of a much wider epidemic. Surveys have shown that 17% of adults in Germany have antibodies against the virus, meaning they became infected at some point; so do 14% in Austria, 4% in southern Italy, and 27% in the Netherlands. One Dutch study found that antibody levels in people aged 18 to 21 dropped from almost 20% in 1995 to less than 5% in 2000, then rose again to 13% in 2011, which suggests the infection is re-emerging, says Zaaijer, a co-author on the study.\n\nBlood and blood products account for at least some of the new infections. One study suggested that 1200 blood components containing the virus are transfused each year in the United Kingdom, and roughly one in 1000 blood donors in the Netherlands carries the virus. (By contrast, a recent U.S. study found the virus's genetic material in just one donor per 9500.)\n\nA much bigger risk factor is the consumption of sausages and other pork products. Hepatitis E has been shown to be ubiquitous in swine herds in many European countries. Most animals become infected without getting sick between 3 and 6 months after birth, when antibodies inherited from their mothers start to wane. And there's strong evidence that the virus is passed on to humans through pork. In one study, Wim van der Poel, a veterinary virologist at Wageningen University and Research Centre in the Netherlands, analyzed hepatitis E sequences found in Dutch blood donors between 2010 and 2015. \"When we looked for the closest sequence ever found, [it] was always a swine sequence from the same region,\" he says.\n\nWhat's unclear is which pork products carry the highest risk. In one region in the south of France, infections have been linked to consumption of figatellu, a pig liver sausage that's often eaten raw. Scientists are still trying to pinpoint which other products contain the virus. It's difficult to culture the virus from meat products, and looking directly for viral RNA is technically complicated; moreover, finding RNA does not mean the food contains intact virus that can infect a consumer. Meanwhile, some studies have also shown a risk from eating shellfish or fruit.\n\nIn the United States, in contrast, hepatitis E \"is very rare even in transplant patients and the immunosuppressed,\" says Jay Hoofnagle of the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases in Bethesda, Maryland. One theory is that U.S. residents eat less raw or undercooked pork. Another theory: Pigs in Europe may suffer from immune deficiencies because of some other infection. \"An HIV-like agent may cause pigs or wild boar to develop chronic HEV infection,\" Hoofnagle says.\n\nWith so many unknowns, controlling this silent epidemic is a challenge. Ireland already screens blood products for hepatitis E, and other countries are debating doing so. Like everything else involving the blood supply, \"it's a touchy subject,\" Pischke says. Screening is costly and may not make sense for the general population, which has little to fear from HEV, says Rainer Seitz, head of transfusion medicine at the Paul Ehrlich Institute in Langen, Germany, a federal institute responsible for blood safety. But he supports screening blood products before use in immunocompromised patients. The virus's apparent ubiquity in pork products and elsewhere in the environment also makes general blood screening questionable, Zaaijer says. \"It's like screening donors for flu in times of flu. The blood is safe, but the air isn't,\" he says. It's far more important to make food and water free of hepatitis E, he adds.\n\nOne way to do that would be to vaccinate pigs. A human vaccine has already been approved in China, and scientists think a swine vaccine is feasible as well. But getting pig farmers to adopt it would be difficult, Van der Poel predicts, because their animals don't get sick. And you'd have to be careful to vaccinate every last animal in a herd, Zaaijer adds; otherwise, the virus might just spread slowly, meaning that animals would get infected later in life, closer to slaughter, which might increase the risk in meat.\n\nReimar Johne, who studies hepatitis E at the Federal Institute for Risk Assessment in Berlin, is trying to find out how the virus can be inactivated in food. 20 minutes at 70 C [158 F] destroys it, but what about drying, smoking, or curing meat? To find out, Johne has started to make sausages in the lab himself. After adding a strain of hepatitis E, he can process the meat any way he wants and check whether viable virus survives. \"It's a bit artificial,\" he says. \"But for the moment, it's all we have.\"\n\n[Byline: Kai Kupferschmidt]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[This is an excellent posting on the zoonotic genotype 3 strain of HEV. - Mod.LL]\nSee Also\n2015\n----\nHepatitis E - France: 2013, raw pork stuffing 20151021.3733016\nHepatitis E - UK: undercooked imported pork sausage, 2014 20150908.3631747\n2014\n----\nHepatitis E - UK: undercooked pork sausage 20141111.2946919\nHepatitis E - France: (VR) raw pork liver sausage 20141010.2850748\nHepatitis E - Australia: (NSW), undercooked pork liver 20140914.2773538\nHepatitis E - Germany: genotype 3, transfusion related 20140529.2506353\n2013\n----\nHepatitis E - UK: pork sausages, alert 20130915.1946331\n.................................................ll/msp/lm", "reports": [{"diseases": ["unknown", "other", "hepatitis c", "hepatitis e"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2016-03-16 00:00:00", "1978-03-16 00:00:00", "1983-03-16 00:00:00", "1997-03-16 00:00:00", "2008-03-16 00:00:00", "1995-03-16 00:00:00", "2000-03-16 00:00:00", "2011-03-16 00:00:00", "2013-03-16 00:00:00", "2014-03-16 00:00:00", "2014-03-16 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Jammu", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Ireland", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Maryland", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "India", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "China", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Bethesda", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "France", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "U.S.", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "the United States", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Austria", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "USA", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Berlin", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Afghanistan", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Australia", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Germany", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Amsterdam", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "the United Kingdom", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Langen", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Italy", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Pakistan", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Netherlands", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Japan", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "4742073", "headline": "PRO/EDR> Hepatitis E - Chad: (SA) effect in pregnancy", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=4742073", "date": "2016-08-28 19:03:33", "main_text": "HEPATITIS E - EUROPE: ZOONOTIC\n******************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Fri 26 Aug 2016\nSource: Science Vol. 353, Issue 6302, pp. 862-863 [edited]\nhttp://science.sciencemag.org/content/353/6302/862.full\n\n\nAlmost immediately after a man received a new heart, his body began to reject it. To save the 58-year-old retired plumber from northern Germany, doctors replaced his blood plasma with donated plasma lacking the antibodies that targeted the donor organ. It worked, but 3 years later, it's clear that he received something else in the bargain: the hepatitis E virus (HEV).\n\nIt's a pathogen that most people get rid of easily without even getting sick. But the man was taking drugs that dampen his immune system to prevent another rejection of his heart. As a result, he can't clear the virus; it has been quietly replicating in his liver ever since. \"If that is not resolved, it leads to liver fibrosis, then liver cirrhosis, then death,\" Sven Pischke, his doctor at the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, says matter-of-factly. \"That was a shock, of course,\" the patient says.\n\nPatients like him are a new challenge for European physicians. Until a few years ago, no one even knew they existed. Hepatitis E was seen as an exotic disease that travelers from India or Africa sometimes brought home. Now, it's clear that there's a silent epidemic of the virus at home, with an estimated 300 000 people infected annually in Germany alone. Most appear to catch it from eating pork, with blood and plasma transfusions playing a smaller role.

And you'd have to be careful to vaccinate every last animal in a herd, Zaaijer adds; otherwise, the virus might just spread slowly, meaning that animals would get infected later in life, closer to slaughter, which might increase the risk in meat.\n\nReimar Johne, who studies hepatitis E at the Federal Institute for Risk Assessment in Berlin, is trying to find out how the virus can be inactivated in food. 20 minutes at 70 C [158 F] destroys it, but what about drying, smoking, or curing meat? To find out, Johne has started to make sausages in the lab himself. After adding a strain of hepatitis E, he can process the meat any way he wants and check whether viable virus survives. \"It's a bit artificial,\" he says. \"But for the moment, it's all we have.\"\n\n[Byline: Kai Kupferschmidt]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[This is an excellent posting on the zoonotic genotype 3 strain of HEV. - Mod.LL]\nSee Also\n2015\n----\nHepatitis E - France: 2013, raw pork stuffing 20151021.3733016\nHepatitis E - UK: undercooked imported pork sausage, 2014 20150908.3631747\n2014\n----\nHepatitis E - UK: undercooked pork sausage 20141111.2946919\nHepatitis E - France: (VR) raw pork liver sausage 20141010.2850748\nHepatitis E - Australia: (NSW), undercooked pork liver 20140914.2773538\nHepatitis E - Germany: genotype 3, transfusion related 20140529.2506353\n2013\n----\nHepatitis E - UK: pork sausages, alert 20130915.1946331\n.................................................ll/msp/lm", "reports": [{"diseases": ["unknown", "other", "hepatitis c", "hepatitis e"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2016-03-16 00:00:00", "1978-03-16 00:00:00", "1983-03-16 00:00:00", "1997-03-16 00:00:00", "2008-03-16 00:00:00", "1995-03-16 00:00:00", "2000-03-16 00:00:00", "2011-03-16 00:00:00", "2013-03-16 00:00:00", "2014-03-16 00:00:00", "2014-03-16 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Jammu", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Ireland", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Maryland", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "India", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "China", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Bethesda", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "France", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "U.S.", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "the United States", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Austria", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "USA", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Berlin", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Afghanistan", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Australia", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Germany", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Amsterdam", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "the United Kingdom", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Langen", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Italy", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Pakistan", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Netherlands", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Japan", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "4445881", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Hepatitis E - Europe: zoonotic", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=4445881", "date": "2016-08-28 19:03:33", "main_text": "HEPATITIS E - EUROPE: ZOONOTIC\n******************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Fri 26 Aug 2016\nSource: Science Vol. 353, Issue 6302, pp. 862-863 [edited]\nhttp://science.sciencemag.org/content/353/6302/862.full\n\n\nAlmost immediately after a man received a new heart, his body began to reject it. To save the 58-year-old retired plumber from northern Germany, doctors replaced his blood plasma with donated plasma lacking the antibodies that targeted the donor organ. It worked, but 3 years later, it's clear that he received something else in the bargain: the hepatitis E virus (HEV).\n\nIt's a pathogen that most people get rid of easily without even getting sick. But the man was taking drugs that dampen his immune system to prevent another rejection of his heart. As a result, he can't clear the virus; it has been quietly replicating in his liver ever since. \"If that is not resolved, it leads to liver fibrosis, then liver cirrhosis, then death,\" Sven Pischke, his doctor at the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, says matter-of-factly. \"That was a shock, of course,\" the patient says.\n\nPatients like him are a new challenge for European physicians. Until a few years ago, no one even knew they existed. Hepatitis E was seen as an exotic disease that travelers from India or Africa sometimes brought home. Now, it's clear that there's a silent epidemic of the virus at home, with an estimated 300 000 people infected annually in Germany alone. Most appear to catch it from eating pork, with blood and plasma transfusions playing a smaller role. The virus occurs in other developed countries as well -- including the USA, Japan, and Australia -- though infections appear to be much rarer there.\n\nScientists are still scrambling to understand the epidemiology of hepatitis E, but they know that in Europe, infection rates rival those for other major hepatitis pathogens (A, B, and C). Two questions are looming large: Should blood donations be screened for the virus? And what can be done to eliminate it from swine herds?\n\nResearchers suspected a new form of hepatitis in 1978, when hundreds of people in Jammu and Kashmir, in northern India, got sick -- and 4 men and 6 pregnant women died -- from what appeared to be a waterborne hepatitis virus. Similar but larger outbreaks followed in India, Pakistan, and China, killing thousands of people, many of them pregnant women. It wasn't until 1983 that Russian scientist Mikhail Balayan isolated the virus from his own stool after a gutsy self-experiment: He drank a cocktail of yogurt and stool samples from Soviet soldiers infected in Afghanistan. Hepatitis E became known as an important waterborne pathogen in Asia and Africa; 2 strains, named genotype 1 and 2, together kill an estimated 58 000 people per year.\n\nBut in 1997, scientists discovered that pigs in the American Midwest carried a new strain of the virus, which they named genotype 3. It was soon identified in European pigs as well, and surveys showed that many Europeans had antibodies to it, a sign they had been infected at some point in their lives. Genotype 3 was very different from its relatives: Pork, not dirty water, appeared to be its main transmission route, and it seemed not to cause any symptoms. \"Hepatitis E does not exist,\" says Hans Zaaijer, who heads the department of bloodborne infections at Sanquin, a nonprofit blood transfusion service in Amsterdam. \"These are 2 completely distinct diseases.\" (It's not clear whether genotype 3 might also spread in developing countries, hiding in the shadow of its more obvious relatives.)\n\nAlas, the new strain wasn't as innocuous as it seemed. In 2008, French researchers reported that in a group of 300 recent transplant patients, 14 had an acute hepatitis E infection. Six got rid of the virus quickly, but 8 couldn't seem to shake it. At Hannover Medical School in Germany, hepatitis specialist Heiner Wedemeyer couldn't believe it at first. \"We are one of the largest transplantation centers in Europe,\" he remembers thinking. \"We would have seen that.\" But when he started screening patients he soon found some that were chronically infected with hepatitis E, as did other clinics all over Europe. Patients had one thing in common: a weakened immune system.\n\nThere's not much doctors can do to help them. For transplant patients, one option is lowering the doses of immunosuppressive drugs to allow the immune system to regenerate, but this increases the risk of organ rejection. Doctors also use ribavirin, a drug approved for hepatitis C and several other viral infections. But there hasn't been a controlled trial yet, and ribavirin has serious side effects.\n\nThese patients are the visible part of a much wider epidemic. Surveys have shown that 17% of adults in Germany have antibodies against the virus, meaning they became infected at some point; so do 14% in Austria, 4% in southern Italy, and 27% in the Netherlands. One Dutch study found that antibody levels in people aged 18 to 21 dropped from almost 20% in 1995 to less than 5% in 2000, then rose again to 13% in 2011, which suggests the infection is re-emerging, says Zaaijer, a co-author on the study.\n\nBlood and blood products account for at least some of the new infections. One study suggested that 1200 blood components containing the virus are transfused each year in the United Kingdom, and roughly one in 1000 blood donors in the Netherlands carries the virus. (By contrast, a recent U.S. study found the virus's genetic material in just one donor per 9500.)\n\nA much bigger risk factor is the consumption of sausages and other pork products. Hepatitis E has been shown to be ubiquitous in swine herds in many European countries. Most animals become infected without getting sick between 3 and 6 months after birth, when antibodies inherited from their mothers start to wane. And there's strong evidence that the virus is passed on to humans through pork. In one study, Wim van der Poel, a veterinary virologist at Wageningen University and Research Centre in the Netherlands, analyzed hepatitis E sequences found in Dutch blood donors between 2010 and 2015. \"When we looked for the closest sequence ever found, [it] was always a swine sequence from the same region,\" he says.\n\nWhat's unclear is which pork products carry the highest risk. In one region in the south of France, infections have been linked to consumption of figatellu, a pig liver sausage that's often eaten raw. Scientists are still trying to pinpoint which other products contain the virus. It's difficult to culture the virus from meat products, and looking directly for viral RNA is technically complicated; moreover, finding RNA does not mean the food contains intact virus that can infect a consumer. Meanwhile, some studies have also shown a risk from eating shellfish or fruit.\n\nIn the United States, in contrast, hepatitis E \"is very rare even in transplant patients and the immunosuppressed,\" says Jay Hoofnagle of the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases in Bethesda, Maryland. One theory is that U.S. residents eat less raw or undercooked pork. Another theory: Pigs in Europe may suffer from immune deficiencies because of some other infection. \"An HIV-like agent may cause pigs or wild boar to develop chronic HEV infection,\" Hoofnagle says.\n\nWith so many unknowns, controlling this silent epidemic is a challenge. Ireland already screens blood products for hepatitis E, and other countries are debating doing so. Like everything else involving the blood supply, \"it's a touchy subject,\" Pischke says. Screening is costly and may not make sense for the general population, which has little to fear from HEV, says Rainer Seitz, head of transfusion medicine at the Paul Ehrlich Institute in Langen, Germany, a federal institute responsible for blood safety. But he supports screening blood products before use in immunocompromised patients. The virus's apparent ubiquity in pork products and elsewhere in the environment also makes general blood screening questionable, Zaaijer says. \"It's like screening donors for flu in times of flu. The blood is safe, but the air isn't,\" he says. It's far more important to make food and water free of hepatitis E, he adds.\n\nOne way to do that would be to vaccinate pigs. A human vaccine has already been approved in China, and scientists think a swine vaccine is feasible as well. But getting pig farmers to adopt it would be difficult, Van der Poel predicts, because their animals don't get sick. And you'd have to be careful to vaccinate every last animal in a herd, Zaaijer adds; otherwise, the virus might just spread slowly, meaning that animals would get infected later in life, closer to slaughter, which might increase the risk in meat.\n\nReimar Johne, who studies hepatitis E at the Federal Institute for Risk Assessment in Berlin, is trying to find out how the virus can be inactivated in food. 20 minutes at 70 C [158 F] destroys it, but what about drying, smoking, or curing meat? To find out, Johne has started to make sausages in the lab himself. After adding a strain of hepatitis E, he can process the meat any way he wants and check whether viable virus survives. \"It's a bit artificial,\" he says. \"But for the moment, it's all we have.\"\n\n[Byline: Kai Kupferschmidt]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[This is an excellent posting on the zoonotic genotype 3 strain of HEV. - Mod.LL]\nSee Also\n2015\n----\nHepatitis E - France: 2013, raw pork stuffing 20151021.3733016\nHepatitis E - UK: undercooked imported pork sausage, 2014 20150908.3631747\n2014\n----\nHepatitis E - UK: undercooked pork sausage 20141111.2946919\nHepatitis E - France: (VR) raw pork liver sausage 20141010.2850748\nHepatitis E - Australia: (NSW), undercooked pork liver 20140914.2773538\nHepatitis E - Germany: genotype 3, transfusion related 20140529.2506353\n2013\n----\nHepatitis E - UK: pork sausages, alert 20130915.1946331\n.................................................ll/msp/lm", "reports": [{"diseases": ["unknown", "other", "hepatitis c", "hepatitis e"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2016-03-16 00:00:00", "1978-03-16 00:00:00", "1983-03-16 00:00:00", "1997-03-16 00:00:00", "2008-03-16 00:00:00", "1995-03-16 00:00:00", "2000-03-16 00:00:00", "2011-03-16 00:00:00", "2013-03-16 00:00:00", "2014-03-16 00:00:00", "2014-03-16 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Jammu", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Ireland", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Maryland", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "India", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "China", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Bethesda", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "France", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "U.S.", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "the United States", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Austria", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "USA", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Berlin", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Afghanistan", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Australia", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Germany", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Amsterdam", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "the United Kingdom", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Langen", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Italy", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Pakistan", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Netherlands", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Japan", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "4405317", "headline": "PRO/EDR> Hepatitis E - Sudan: (ND) IDP camp", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=4405317", "date": "2016-02-21 17:27:14", "main_text": "HEPATITIS E - INDIA (03): (HIMACHAL PRADESH) FATAL\n**************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Fri 19 Feb 2016\nSource: Indian Express [edited]\nhttp://goo.gl/N5P3AN\n\n\nIn perhaps the worst tragedy related to jaundice deaths in the town, a young lawyer lost his 25 year old wife 4 days after the birth of a baby girl, born at the state's Kamla Nehru hospital on 13 Feb 2016.

In Bangladesh, plasma samples from 1100 women during the 1st trimester (TM) and 3rd TM of pregnancy and 3 months postpartum (PP) were tested for anti-HEV IgG. During this time, 40 women developed antibody responses to HEV. These seroconverters are classified as the cases (incidence = 46 infections per 1000 person-years). All except 1 seroconversion occurred between the 3rd TM and 3 months PP. The cases and 40 matched non-seroconverters (controls) underwent analysis of a panel of 10 cytokines, 12 vitamins and minerals, and 2 markers of inflammation. Throughout pregnancy, seroconverting cases displayed higher concentrations of both pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines compared with the non-seroconverting controls, even prior to infection. In the 1st TM, seroconverters had lower circulating zinc concentrations (P = 0.03), an increased prevalence of vitamin D deficiency (25-hydroxy vitamin D [25(OH)2D] less than 50 nmol/L, P = 0.08), and anemia (hemoglobin less than 110 g/L, P = 0.05) compared with controls. There were no differences in C-reactive protein or alpha-1-acid glycoprotein. Antecedent micronutrient deficiencies may lead to dysregulated cytokine expression and immunologic compromise, increasing the risk of HEV infection, especially during pregnancy. This exploratory analysis reveals potential novel associations that deserve further study.\"\n\nA recombinant, 3-dose series HEV vaccine has been produced but has not yet been pre-qualified by WHO. The vaccine has been shown to prevent symptomatic HEV infection and proven to be safe and effective in people aged 16-64 years. Limited vaccine safety data in 37 pregnant women receiving 57 doses have been reported; however, further research is needed, and safety for children is unknown. The vaccine is expected to be protective against HEV genotype 1, the strain associated with most waterborne outbreaks in Africa and Asia.\n\nHimachal Pradesh (literally \"snow-laden region\") is a state in North India, forming part of the larger Punjab region, and can be found on a map at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Himachal_Pradesh#/media/File:India_Himachal_Pradesh_locator_map.svg. - Mod.LL\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/304.]\nSee Also\nHepatitis E - India (02): (HP) fatalities 20160212.4016257\nHepatitis E - Bangladesh: pregnancy, increased mortality, risk factors 20160115.3938772\nHepatitis E - India: (HP) waterborne, susp 20160108.3921128\n2015\n---\nHepatitis E - France: 2013, raw pork stuffing 20151021.3733016\nHepatitis E - UK: undercooked imported pork sausage, 2014 20150908.3631747\nHepatitis E - South Sudan: (WH) IDP camp 20150803.3555590\nHepatitis E, pet rabbit - Italy 20150517.3367922\nHepatitis E - Nepal (02): ex India, commentary 20150412.3292842\nHepatitis E - Nepal: ex India 20150409.3287964\nHepatitis E - Spain: HIV infected individuals 20150314.3230174\nHepatitis E - Philippines: (TR) human, swine 20150209.3152769\n2014\n---\nHepatitis - India (03): (HP) hepatitis E susp 20141224.3051859\nHepatitis E - UK: undercooked pork sausage 20141111.2946919\nHepatitis - India: (OR) hepatitis E, susp. 20141101.2921487\nHepatitis E - France: (VR) raw pork liver sausage 20141010.2850748\nHepatitis E - Sudan (02): displaced persons 20140926.2808725\nHepatitis E - Australia: (NSW), undercooked pork liver 20140914.2773538\nHepatitis E - South Sudan: (LK) displaced persons camp 20140908.2757656\nHepatitis E - Sudan: (DS) displaced people camp 20140906.2753846\nHepatitis E - Ethiopia: (GA) refugees 20140810.2676571\nHepatitis E - Germany: genotype 3, transfusion related 20140529.2506353\nHepatitis E - Nepal (02): (MO) 20140515.247\n.................................................sb/ll/msp/sh", "reports": [{"diseases": ["unknown", "hepatitis e"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2016-02-13 00:00:00", "1100-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2013-03-16 00:00:00", "2014-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2014-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Bangladesh", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "LL", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Shimla", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "India", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "4126018", "headline": "PRO/EDR> Hepatitis A - Kenya: (MM) waterborne, hepatitis E susp, RFI", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=4126018", "date": "2016-02-21 17:27:14", "main_text": "HEPATITIS E - INDIA (03): (HIMACHAL PRADESH) FATAL\n**************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Fri 19 Feb 2016\nSource: Indian Express [edited]\nhttp://goo.gl/N5P3AN\n\n\nIn perhaps the worst tragedy related to jaundice deaths in the town, a young lawyer lost his 25 year old wife 4 days after the birth of a baby girl, born at the state's Kamla Nehru hospital on 13 Feb 2016.

In Bangladesh, plasma samples from 1100 women during the 1st trimester (TM) and 3rd TM of pregnancy and 3 months postpartum (PP) were tested for anti-HEV IgG. During this time, 40 women developed antibody responses to HEV. These seroconverters are classified as the cases (incidence = 46 infections per 1000 person-years). All except 1 seroconversion occurred between the 3rd TM and 3 months PP. The cases and 40 matched non-seroconverters (controls) underwent analysis of a panel of 10 cytokines, 12 vitamins and minerals, and 2 markers of inflammation. Throughout pregnancy, seroconverting cases displayed higher concentrations of both pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines compared with the non-seroconverting controls, even prior to infection. In the 1st TM, seroconverters had lower circulating zinc concentrations (P = 0.03), an increased prevalence of vitamin D deficiency (25-hydroxy vitamin D [25(OH)2D] less than 50 nmol/L, P = 0.08), and anemia (hemoglobin less than 110 g/L, P = 0.05) compared with controls. There were no differences in C-reactive protein or alpha-1-acid glycoprotein. Antecedent micronutrient deficiencies may lead to dysregulated cytokine expression and immunologic compromise, increasing the risk of HEV infection, especially during pregnancy. This exploratory analysis reveals potential novel associations that deserve further study.\"\n\nA recombinant, 3-dose series HEV vaccine has been produced but has not yet been pre-qualified by WHO.

In Bangladesh, plasma samples from 1100 women during the 1st trimester (TM) and 3rd TM of pregnancy and 3 months postpartum (PP) were tested for anti-HEV IgG. During this time, 40 women developed antibody responses to HEV. These seroconverters are classified as the cases (incidence = 46 infections per 1000 person-years). All except 1 seroconversion occurred between the 3rd TM and 3 months PP. The cases and 40 matched non-seroconverters (controls) underwent analysis of a panel of 10 cytokines, 12 vitamins and minerals, and 2 markers of inflammation. Throughout pregnancy, seroconverting cases displayed higher concentrations of both pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines compared with the non-seroconverting controls, even prior to infection. In the 1st TM, seroconverters had lower circulating zinc concentrations (P = 0.03), an increased prevalence of vitamin D deficiency (25-hydroxy vitamin D [25(OH)2D] less than 50 nmol/L, P = 0.08), and anemia (hemoglobin less than 110 g/L, P = 0.05) compared with controls. There were no differences in C-reactive protein or alpha-1-acid glycoprotein. Antecedent micronutrient deficiencies may lead to dysregulated cytokine expression and immunologic compromise, increasing the risk of HEV infection, especially during pregnancy.

Although risk for foodborne transmission from pork is now recognized, we report here direct HEV transmission through ingestion of raw pig liver sausages (figatellu [plural: figatelli]) in southeastern France.\n\nThe index case-patient was a 45-year-old woman from Hyeres ([a commune in the Var department in the Provence-Alpes-C\u00f4te d'Azur regionin] southeastern France) who had no underlying medical condition. She visited her general practitioner on 17 Dec 2013, reporting 3 days of weakness. Acute hepatitis was diagnosed 2 days later on the basis of elevated liver enzymes (alanine aminotransferase 1265 IU/L [reference less than 35 IU/L]) and bilirubin (65 micromol/L [reference less than 17 micromol/L]). Serum markers for acute hepatitis A, B, and C; cytomegalovirus; and Epstein-Barr virus were negative. Jaundice appeared on 19 Dec 2013 and the patient was referred to the Medical Unit of Hyeres for additional investigations. A serum sample collected on 20 Dec 2013 tested positive for HEV RNA; viral load was 3.3 log10 IU/mL (Ceeram, La Chapelle sur Erdre, France), and IgM and IgG against HEV were found (Wantai, Beijing, China), which led to the diagnosis of acute hepatitis E. The HEV genotype was 3f, as determined from the phylogenetic analysis of a portion of the open reading frame (ORF) 2 (2). The index case-patient recovered by the end of January 2014. HEV viremia was undetectable on 17 Jan 2014.\n\nThe index case-patient and her family regularly ate figatelli (raw pork liver sausages) made in Corsica. The patient had most recently eaten figatelli at a lunch with 8 family members on 28 Oct 2013, 7 weeks before illness onset. After receiving informed consent, we conducted laboratory investigations of samples from the other family members; tests included HEV serology and HEV RNA detection in serum and fecal samples. Samples were obtained from family members during January 8-21 Jan 2014 (41-54 days after the lunch). Positive HEV IgM and detectable HEV RNA were found in the serum of the index case-patient's daughter, who was asymptomatic. Because the sample was tested 10 weeks after the family lunch, the daughter's HEV viral load was too low to enable sequence characterization and clustering of HEV strains. 3 other family members were IgG positive for HEV, indicating previous HEV infection. Leftover sausages had been kept frozen and were available for HEV testing.\n\nHEV RNA was detectable from the leftover sausages, and HEV sequences were amplified in 2 different genomic regions (ORF1: RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and ORF2), as described previously (2). Comparison with the index case-patient's sequences showed 100 percent identity for both regions (Figure - for figure, see source URL above - Mod.LL). Samples of food and samples from the index case-patient were analyzed in 2 independent laboratories to avoid any cross-contamination. The level of contamination of the figatellu was 48 000 copies of HEV RNA/g of sausage (3).\n\nFigatellu, a dried sausage, contains 30 percent pork liver and no heating step occurs during its manufacture. Usually deep cooking is recommended on the package, but consumers might not follow the cooking recommendation; also, figatelli can be sold in small local shops with no label. In the instance reported here, the figatellu was sold without any warning label and was eaten raw.\n\nThat HEV was transmitted through ingestion of contaminated food is supported by the following evidence:\n- 3 case reports have provided direct evidence of HEV transmission through ingestion of contaminated animal food products with identical or near identical sequences between the patients and the contaminated food they ate. 2 cases occurred in the early 2000s in Japan through consumption of grilled wild boar (4) or sashimi of Sika deer (5); the 3rd, reported recently in Spain, was transmitted through ingestion of pig meat (6).\n- HEV widely infects domestic pigs and wild boar (7).\n- Swine and human HEV strains have genetic similarities and, in some cases, are indistinguishable (1).\n- In Marseille, France, a case-control study identified ingestion of figatellu as a risk factor for HEV infection. Genetic similarities were found between sequences isolated from patients with autochthonous hepatitis E and nonrelated figatelli purchased in the same region (8). Finally, infectious virus, replicating in a 3-dimensional culture system, was identified in a HEV RNA-positive figatellu (9).\n\nIn the present study, the homology between sequences recovered from the index case-patient and those recovered from leftovers of figatellu provides additional proof of HEV foodborne transmission in a Western country. In France, information about the risk for HEV transmission through the ingestion of such delicatessen was published by French authorities in 2010 (10), but the present case demonstrates that public education and warning, or larger and more explicit labels on the package, must be improved to reduce the risk for HEV exposure.\n\nReferences\n----------\n1.

These cases involve hepatitis E virus (HEV) genotypes 3 and 4, which are zoonotic. Although risk for foodborne transmission from pork is now recognized, we report here direct HEV transmission through ingestion of raw pig liver sausages (figatellu [plural: figatelli]) in southeastern France.\n\nThe index case-patient was a 45-year-old woman from Hyeres ([a commune in the Var department in the Provence-Alpes-C\u00f4te d'Azur regionin] southeastern France) who had no underlying medical condition. She visited her general practitioner on 17 Dec 2013, reporting 3 days of weakness. Acute hepatitis was diagnosed 2 days later on the basis of elevated liver enzymes (alanine aminotransferase 1265 IU/L [reference less than 35 IU/L]) and bilirubin (65 micromol/L [reference less than 17 micromol/L]). Serum markers for acute hepatitis A, B, and C; cytomegalovirus; and Epstein-Barr virus were negative. Jaundice appeared on 19 Dec 2013 and the patient was referred to the Medical Unit of Hyeres for additional investigations. A serum sample collected on 20 Dec 2013 tested positive for HEV RNA; viral load was 3.3 log10 IU/mL (Ceeram, La Chapelle sur Erdre, France), and IgM and IgG against HEV were found (Wantai, Beijing, China), which led to the diagnosis of acute hepatitis E. The HEV genotype was 3f, as determined from the phylogenetic analysis of a portion of the open reading frame (ORF) 2 (2). The index case-patient recovered by the end of January 2014. HEV viremia was undetectable on 17 Jan 2014.\n\nThe index case-patient and her family regularly ate figatelli (raw pork liver sausages) made in Corsica. The patient had most recently eaten figatelli at a lunch with 8 family members on 28 Oct 2013, 7 weeks before illness onset. After receiving informed consent, we conducted laboratory investigations of samples from the other family members; tests included HEV serology and HEV RNA detection in serum and fecal samples. Samples were obtained from family members during January 8-21 Jan 2014 (41-54 days after the lunch). Positive HEV IgM and detectable HEV RNA were found in the serum of the index case-patient's daughter, who was asymptomatic. Because the sample was tested 10 weeks after the family lunch, the daughter's HEV viral load was too low to enable sequence characterization and clustering of HEV strains. 3 other family members were IgG positive for HEV, indicating previous HEV infection. Leftover sausages had been kept frozen and were available for HEV testing.\n\nHEV RNA was detectable from the leftover sausages, and HEV sequences were amplified in 2 different genomic regions (ORF1: RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and ORF2), as described previously (2). Comparison with the index case-patient's sequences showed 100 percent identity for both regions (Figure - for figure, see source URL above - Mod.LL). Samples of food and samples from the index case-patient were analyzed in 2 independent laboratories to avoid any cross-contamination. The level of contamination of the figatellu was 48 000 copies of HEV RNA/g of sausage (3).\n\nFigatellu, a dried sausage, contains 30 percent pork liver and no heating step occurs during its manufacture. Usually deep cooking is recommended on the package, but consumers might not follow the cooking recommendation; also, figatelli can be sold in small local shops with no label. In the instance reported here, the figatellu was sold without any warning label and was eaten raw.\n\nThat HEV was transmitted through ingestion of contaminated food is supported by the following evidence:\n- 3 case reports have provided direct evidence of HEV transmission through ingestion of contaminated animal food products with identical or near identical sequences between the patients and the contaminated food they ate. 2 cases occurred in the early 2000s in Japan through consumption of grilled wild boar (4) or sashimi of Sika deer (5); the 3rd, reported recently in Spain, was transmitted through ingestion of pig meat (6).\n- HEV widely infects domestic pigs and wild boar (7).\n- Swine and human HEV strains have genetic similarities and, in some cases, are indistinguishable (1).\n- In Marseille, France, a case-control study identified ingestion of figatellu as a risk factor for HEV infection. Genetic similarities were found between sequences isolated from patients with autochthonous hepatitis E and nonrelated figatelli purchased in the same region (8). Finally, infectious virus, replicating in a 3-dimensional culture system, was identified in a HEV RNA-positive figatellu (9).\n\nIn the present study, the homology between sequences recovered from the index case-patient and those recovered from leftovers of figatellu provides additional proof of HEV foodborne transmission in a Western country. In France, information about the risk for HEV transmission through the ingestion of such delicatessen was published by French authorities in 2010 (10), but the present case demonstrates that public education and warning, or larger and more explicit labels on the package, must be improved to reduce the risk for HEV exposure.\n\nReferences\n----------\n1.

Emerg Infect Dis 2014; 20(11) [date cited]\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe number of sporadic autochthonous cases of acute hepatitis E is increasing in many industrialized countries (1). These cases involve hepatitis E virus (HEV) genotypes 3 and 4, which are zoonotic. Although risk for foodborne transmission from pork is now recognized, we report here direct HEV transmission through ingestion of raw pig liver sausages (figatellu [plural: figatelli]) in southeastern France.\n\nThe index case-patient was a 45-year-old woman from Hyeres ([a commune in the Var department in the Provence-Alpes-C\u00f4te d'Azur regionin] southeastern France) who had no underlying medical condition. She visited her general practitioner on 17 Dec 2013, reporting 3 days of weakness. Acute hepatitis was diagnosed 2 days later on the basis of elevated liver enzymes (alanine aminotransferase 1265 IU/L [reference less than 35 IU/L]) and bilirubin (65 micromol/L [reference less than 17 micromol/L]). Serum markers for acute hepatitis A, B, and C; cytomegalovirus; and Epstein-Barr virus were negative. Jaundice appeared on 19 Dec 2013 and the patient was referred to the Medical Unit of Hyeres for additional investigations. A serum sample collected on 20 Dec 2013 tested positive for HEV RNA; viral load was 3.3 log10 IU/mL (Ceeram, La Chapelle sur Erdre, France), and IgM and IgG against HEV were found (Wantai, Beijing, China), which led to the diagnosis of acute hepatitis E. The HEV genotype was 3f, as determined from the phylogenetic analysis of a portion of the open reading frame (ORF) 2 (2). The index case-patient recovered by the end of January 2014. HEV viremia was undetectable on 17 Jan 2014.\n\nThe index case-patient and her family regularly ate figatelli (raw pork liver sausages) made in Corsica. The patient had most recently eaten figatelli at a lunch with 8 family members on 28 Oct 2013, 7 weeks before illness onset. After receiving informed consent, we conducted laboratory investigations of samples from the other family members; tests included HEV serology and HEV RNA detection in serum and fecal samples. Samples were obtained from family members during January 8-21 Jan 2014 (41-54 days after the lunch). Positive HEV IgM and detectable HEV RNA were found in the serum of the index case-patient's daughter, who was asymptomatic. Because the sample was tested 10 weeks after the family lunch, the daughter's HEV viral load was too low to enable sequence characterization and clustering of HEV strains. 3 other family members were IgG positive for HEV, indicating previous HEV infection. Leftover sausages had been kept frozen and were available for HEV testing.\n\nHEV RNA was detectable from the leftover sausages, and HEV sequences were amplified in 2 different genomic regions (ORF1: RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and ORF2), as described previously (2).

Emerg Infect Dis 2014; 20(11) [date cited]\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe number of sporadic autochthonous cases of acute hepatitis E is increasing in many industrialized countries (1). These cases involve hepatitis E virus (HEV) genotypes 3 and 4, which are zoonotic. Although risk for foodborne transmission from pork is now recognized, we report here direct HEV transmission through ingestion of raw pig liver sausages (figatellu [plural: figatelli]) in southeastern France.\n\nThe index case-patient was a 45-year-old woman from Hyeres ([a commune in the Var department in the Provence-Alpes-C\u00f4te d'Azur regionin] southeastern France) who had no underlying medical condition. She visited her general practitioner on 17 Dec 2013, reporting 3 days of weakness. Acute hepatitis was diagnosed 2 days later on the basis of elevated liver enzymes (alanine aminotransferase 1265 IU/L [reference less than 35 IU/L]) and bilirubin (65 micromol/L [reference less than 17 micromol/L]). Serum markers for acute hepatitis A, B, and C; cytomegalovirus; and Epstein-Barr virus were negative. Jaundice appeared on 19 Dec 2013 and the patient was referred to the Medical Unit of Hyeres for additional investigations. A serum sample collected on 20 Dec 2013 tested positive for HEV RNA; viral load was 3.3 log10 IU/mL (Ceeram, La Chapelle sur Erdre, France), and IgM and IgG against HEV were found (Wantai, Beijing, China), which led to the diagnosis of acute hepatitis E. The HEV genotype was 3f, as determined from the phylogenetic analysis of a portion of the open reading frame (ORF) 2 (2). The index case-patient recovered by the end of January 2014. HEV viremia was undetectable on 17 Jan 2014.\n\nThe index case-patient and her family regularly ate figatelli (raw pork liver sausages) made in Corsica. The patient had most recently eaten figatelli at a lunch with 8 family members on 28 Oct 2013, 7 weeks before illness onset. After receiving informed consent, we conducted laboratory investigations of samples from the other family members; tests included HEV serology and HEV RNA detection in serum and fecal samples. Samples were obtained from family members during January 8-21 Jan 2014 (41-54 days after the lunch). Positive HEV IgM and detectable HEV RNA were found in the serum of the index case-patient's daughter, who was asymptomatic. Because the sample was tested 10 weeks after the family lunch, the daughter's HEV viral load was too low to enable sequence characterization and clustering of HEV strains. 3 other family members were IgG positive for HEV, indicating previous HEV infection. Leftover sausages had been kept frozen and were available for HEV testing.\n\nHEV RNA was detectable from the leftover sausages, and HEV sequences were amplified in 2 different genomic regions (ORF1: RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and ORF2), as described previously (2). Comparison with the index case-patient's sequences showed 100 percent identity for both regions (Figure - for figure, see source URL above - Mod.LL). Samples of food and samples from the index case-patient were analyzed in 2 independent laboratories to avoid any cross-contamination. The level of contamination of the figatellu was 48 000 copies of HEV RNA/g of sausage (3).\n\nFigatellu, a dried sausage, contains 30 percent pork liver and no heating step occurs during its manufacture. Usually deep cooking is recommended on the package, but consumers might not follow the cooking recommendation; also, figatelli can be sold in small local shops with no label. In the instance reported here, the figatellu was sold without any warning label and was eaten raw.\n\nThat HEV was transmitted through ingestion of contaminated food is supported by the following evidence:\n- 3 case reports have provided direct evidence of HEV transmission through ingestion of contaminated animal food products with identical or near identical sequences between the patients and the contaminated food they ate. 2 cases occurred in the early 2000s in Japan through consumption of grilled wild boar (4) or sashimi of Sika deer (5); the 3rd, reported recently in Spain, was transmitted through ingestion of pig meat (6).\n- HEV widely infects domestic pigs and wild boar (7).\n- Swine and human HEV strains have genetic similarities and, in some cases, are indistinguishable (1).\n- In Marseille, France, a case-control study identified ingestion of figatellu as a risk factor for HEV infection. Genetic similarities were found between sequences isolated from patients with autochthonous hepatitis E and nonrelated figatelli purchased in the same region (8). Finally, infectious virus, replicating in a 3-dimensional culture system, was identified in a HEV RNA-positive figatellu (9).\n\nIn the present study, the homology between sequences recovered from the index case-patient and those recovered from leftovers of figatellu provides additional proof of HEV foodborne transmission in a Western country. In France, information about the risk for HEV transmission through the ingestion of such delicatessen was published by French authorities in 2010 (10), but the present case demonstrates that public education and warning, or larger and more explicit labels on the package, must be improved to reduce the risk for HEV exposure.\n\nReferences\n----------\n1.

Emerg Infect Dis 2014; 20(11) [date cited]\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe number of sporadic autochthonous cases of acute hepatitis E is increasing in many industrialized countries (1). These cases involve hepatitis E virus (HEV) genotypes 3 and 4, which are zoonotic. Although risk for foodborne transmission from pork is now recognized, we report here direct HEV transmission through ingestion of raw pig liver sausages (figatellu [plural: figatelli]) in southeastern France.\n\nThe index case-patient was a 45-year-old woman from Hyeres ([a commune in the Var department in the Provence-Alpes-C\u00f4te d'Azur regionin] southeastern France) who had no underlying medical condition. She visited her general practitioner on 17 Dec 2013, reporting 3 days of weakness. Acute hepatitis was diagnosed 2 days later on the basis of elevated liver enzymes (alanine aminotransferase 1265 IU/L [reference less than 35 IU/L]) and bilirubin (65 micromol/L [reference less than 17 micromol/L]). Serum markers for acute hepatitis A, B, and C; cytomegalovirus; and Epstein-Barr virus were negative. Jaundice appeared on 19 Dec 2013 and the patient was referred to the Medical Unit of Hyeres for additional investigations. A serum sample collected on 20 Dec 2013 tested positive for HEV RNA; viral load was 3.3 log10 IU/mL (Ceeram, La Chapelle sur Erdre, France), and IgM and IgG against HEV were found (Wantai, Beijing, China), which led to the diagnosis of acute hepatitis E. The HEV genotype was 3f, as determined from the phylogenetic analysis of a portion of the open reading frame (ORF) 2 (2). The index case-patient recovered by the end of January 2014. HEV viremia was undetectable on 17 Jan 2014.\n\nThe index case-patient and her family regularly ate figatelli (raw pork liver sausages) made in Corsica. The patient had most recently eaten figatelli at a lunch with 8 family members on 28 Oct 2013, 7 weeks before illness onset. After receiving informed consent, we conducted laboratory investigations of samples from the other family members; tests included HEV serology and HEV RNA detection in serum and fecal samples. Samples were obtained from family members during January 8-21 Jan 2014 (41-54 days after the lunch). Positive HEV IgM and detectable HEV RNA were found in the serum of the index case-patient's daughter, who was asymptomatic. Because the sample was tested 10 weeks after the family lunch, the daughter's HEV viral load was too low to enable sequence characterization and clustering of HEV strains. 3 other family members were IgG positive for HEV, indicating previous HEV infection. Leftover sausages had been kept frozen and were available for HEV testing.\n\nHEV RNA was detectable from the leftover sausages, and HEV sequences were amplified in 2 different genomic regions (ORF1: RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and ORF2), as described previously (2). Comparison with the index case-patient's sequences showed 100 percent identity for both regions (Figure - for figure, see source URL above - Mod.LL). Samples of food and samples from the index case-patient were analyzed in 2 independent laboratories to avoid any cross-contamination. The level of contamination of the figatellu was 48 000 copies of HEV RNA/g of sausage (3).\n\nFigatellu, a dried sausage, contains 30 percent pork liver and no heating step occurs during its manufacture. Usually deep cooking is recommended on the package, but consumers might not follow the cooking recommendation; also, figatelli can be sold in small local shops with no label. In the instance reported here, the figatellu was sold without any warning label and was eaten raw.\n\nThat HEV was transmitted through ingestion of contaminated food is supported by the following evidence:\n- 3 case reports have provided direct evidence of HEV transmission through ingestion of contaminated animal food products with identical or near identical sequences between the patients and the contaminated food they ate. 2 cases occurred in the early 2000s in Japan through consumption of grilled wild boar (4) or sashimi of Sika deer (5); the 3rd, reported recently in Spain, was transmitted through ingestion of pig meat (6).\n- HEV widely infects domestic pigs and wild boar (7).\n- Swine and human HEV strains have genetic similarities and, in some cases, are indistinguishable (1).\n- In Marseille, France, a case-control study identified ingestion of figatellu as a risk factor for HEV infection. Genetic similarities were found between sequences isolated from patients with autochthonous hepatitis E and nonrelated figatelli purchased in the same region (8). Finally, infectious virus, replicating in a 3-dimensional culture system, was identified in a HEV RNA-positive figatellu (9).\n\nIn the present study, the homology between sequences recovered from the index case-patient and those recovered from leftovers of figatellu provides additional proof of HEV foodborne transmission in a Western country. In France, information about the risk for HEV transmission through the ingestion of such delicatessen was published by French authorities in 2010 (10), but the present case demonstrates that public education and warning, or larger and more explicit labels on the package, must be improved to reduce the risk for HEV exposure.\n\nReferences\n----------\n1.

We studied the presence of silent HEV infection among Dutch blood donors. Using donations collected throughout the Netherlands in 2011 and 2012, 40 176 donations were tested for HEV RNA in 459 pools of 48 or 480 donations. Deconstruction of the reactive pools identified 13 viraemic donors. In addition, 5239 donors were tested for presence of anti-HEV IgG and IgM and for HEV RNA when IgM-positive. Of the 5239 donations, 1401 (27 percent) tested repeat-positive for HEV IgG, of which 49 (3.5 percent) also tested positive for anti-HEV IgM; 4 of the HEV IgM-positive donors tested positive for HEV RNA. HEV IgG seroprevalence ranged from 13 percent among donors younger than 30 years to 43 percent in donors older than 60 years. The finding of 17 HEV RNA-positive donations among 45 415 donations corresponds to one HEV-positive blood donation per day in the Netherlands. For 16 of the 17 HEV RNA-positive donors, genotyping succeeded, revealing HEV genotype 3, which is circulating among Dutch pigs. Apparently, silent HEV infection is common in the Netherlands, which possibly applies to larger parts of Europe.\n\nIntroduction\n------------\nHepatitis E virus (HEV) is a non-enveloped RNA virus, classified into 4 genotypes. HEV genotypes 1 and 2 have been found only in humans, whereas genotypes 3 and 4 have also been found in animals. The clinical features of hepatitis E are similar to those of viral hepatitis caused by other hepatotropic [having a special affinity for the liver] viruses. In Europe and North America, hepatitis E is known as an acute disease in travellers returning from tropical countries, but an endemic source of hepatitis E has always been suspected. Recently it became clear that genotype 3 of hepatitis E virus (HEV gt-3) is widely spread among pigs in Europe, North America and Japan. Surprisingly, infection of humans by HEV gt-3 seems to cause disease mainly in immunosuppressed persons, such as patients who have received organ transplants, who may develop chronic hepatitis E. Blood donors can be silently infected with HEV, as indicated by plasma pools testing positive for HEV RNA and by a high prevalence of antibodies to HEV among blood donors in the south west of France]. Cases of transfusion-transmitted hepatitis E have been reported. The dynamics of HEV gt-3 infection and its implications for public health and the safety of blood are largely unknown. Which part of the population has signs of resolved or active infection? To estimate the infection pressure of HEV in the Netherlands, we determined the presence of HEV RNA and HEV antibodies in a large number of recent blood donations, collected throughout the country.\n\n[Interested readers should consult the original text via the source URL to view the methodology, results, graphical presentation of the data obtained by the authors, and the references cited. - Mod.CP]\n\nDiscussion\n----------\nThe detection of HEV viraemia in 17 of 45 415 recent Dutch blood donations demonstrates a high incidence of HEV infection in the Netherlands. Our serological screening suggested that roughly one quarter of the Dutch adult population has experienced HEV infection. This proportion compares with the 16 percent of 500 donors in the south-west of Britain, and the 53 percent of 512 donors in the south-west of France, who recently tested positive for IgG anti-HEV, using the same antibody assay as employed in this study. Unfortunately, there is no gold standard for HEV antibody testing. A recent study reports an HEV IgG seroprevalence of only 2.6 percent in 7072 Dutch samples, collected in 2006 and 2007, employing another brand of HEV antibody assay (MP/Genelabs). The Wantai assay used in the present study may suffer from a high level of non-specific reactivity. However, studies comparing the performance of the Wantai and the MP/Genelabs assay demonstrate a higher sensitivity and detection of more sera from PCR-proven cases by the Wantai assay. Classical anti-HEV serology probably lacks sensitivity and seems unsuitable to confirm Wantai EIA test results. In addition, the frequent finding of HEV RNA-positive donors, a striking age-related increase of HEV IgG seroprevalence, and the fact that already in 2005, HEV was found to circulate on 53 of 97 Dutch pig farms, suggest that the high seroprevalence as detected by the Wantai assay may be correct.\n\nUnfortunately, seroprevalence data for persons under the age of 18 are not available. The striking age-related seroprevalence (Figure 2) is difficult to interpret. The age-dependent seroprevalence may simply reflect a long-standing, stable situation, in which people are evenly exposed to HEV in the course of their life. In that scenario, the current high number of viraemic and seroconverting donors may reflect a temporary elevation of HEV infection pressure. If endemic HEV infection were a recent phenomenon, the age-dependent seroprevalence could only be explained by age-dependent exposure or age-dependent susceptibility, which is difficult to imagine for a food-borne pathogen. Alternatively, the seroprevalence curve could reflect an age-cohort effect, caused by transient exposure of older generations in the past. Such a cohort effect has been described in England. The HEV incidence found in this study of 1 percent per year, as well as the high number of HEV RNA-positive blood donors, seem to contradict transient exposure to HEV in the past; but endemic HEV may have returned after a long period of absence.\n\nHEV transmission by blood transfusion has been reported in Saudi Arabia, Japan, France and the United Kingdom. Our results suggest roughly one HEV viraemic donation per day in the Netherlands. This may be an underestimation, considering that the serological screening of 5239 donors only detected antibody-positive donors in a later stage of infection, while the screening for HEV RNA of 40 176 pooled (diluted) donations detected donors in an early stage of infection, with high levels of HEV RNA and low or absent HEV antibodies. HEV RNA-positive blood may pose a threat to immunosuppressed blood recipients, such as recipients of organ transplants and patients with haematological malignancies; and possibly to pregnant women. Because blood transfusion is only a minor source of HEV infection, the routine screening of blood donations for the presence of HEV does not yet seem warranted. Each immunosuppressed patient with unexplained elevated liver enzymes should be tested for the presence of HEV RNA, irrespective of exposure to blood products. Fortunately, it appears that chronic HEV infection in immunosuppressed patients can be cured by a temporary reduction of immunosuppression, or by antiviral treatment using ribavirin.\n\nThe source and transmission routes of HEV gt-3 infection have not yet been uncovered. In contrast to the Midi-Pyrenees region of France, where an association of HEV seropositivity with rural residence was found, the level of urbanisation and the vicinity of pig farms do not play a role in the Netherlands. Until recently, little was known of HEV transmission dynamics in European pig populations. Berto et al. describe the presence of HEV in 8 to 73 percent of stool samples collected from pig farms between 2007 and 2011 throughout Europe, and the presence of HEV in fattening pigs. It is unclear whether pigs are the source of the current HEV infections. Intensive pig farming may have become the major amplifier of the virus, considering that millions of pigs are being reared in the Netherlands each year, of which each year again a large part probably acquires and sheds HEV. Subsequently, HEV may be spread via contaminated meat or via faecally contaminated water used for irrigation. Studies are needed to identify the transmission routes of HEV gt-3 to humans, so that appropriate measures can be taken. It seems likely that at this moment other Western countries also experience extensive, silent HEV infection.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Hepatitis E is a liver disease caused by hepatitis E virus (HEV): a non-enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus. HEV is transmitted mainly through contaminated drinking water. It is usually a self-limiting infection and resolves within 4-6 weeks. Occasionally, a fulminant form of hepatitis develops, which can lead to death. Hepatitis E is found worldwide and different genotypes of HEV determine differences in epidemiology. Genotype 1 is usually seen in developing countries and causes community-level outbreaks, while genotype 3 is usually seen in the developed countries and does not cause outbreaks. Although humans are considered the natural host for HEV, antibodies to HEV and closely related viruses have been detected in primates and several other animal species.\n\nIn Europe, the dynamics of endemic hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection remain enigmatic. The authors have studied the presence of silent HEV infection among Dutch blood donors. Genotyping of 16 of the 17 HEV RNA-positive donors revealed the presence of HEV genotype 3, which is circulating among Dutch pigs. (HEV genotypes 1 and 2 have been found only in humans, whereas genotypes 3 and 4 have also been found in animals). The authors estimate that the finding of 17 HEV RNA-positive donations among 45 415 donations corresponds to one HEV-positive blood donation per day in the Netherlands. The authors further conclude that silent HEV infection is common in the Netherlands, a situation which may apply to larger parts of Europe. - Mod.CP\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/r/1r1l.]\nSee Also\n2012\n----\nHepatitis E virus, ferret - Netherlands (02): biosecurity 20120810.1237757\nHepatitis E virus, ferret - Netherlands 20120807.1231416\n2011\n----\nHepatitis E - France: (SE), autochthonous & food-borne 20110412.1157\n2009\n----\nHepatitis E - France (02): background 20090918.3274\nHepatitis E - France: (Marseille) pig liver sausage 20090917.3267\n.................................................cp/je/dk", "reports": [{"diseases": ["unknown", "other", "hepatitis c", "hepatitis d", "hepatitis e"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2011-03-16 00:00:00", "2011-03-16 00:00:00", "2012-03-16 00:00:00", "1401-03-16 00:00:00", "7072-03-16 00:00:00", "2006-03-16 00:00:00", "2007-03-16 00:00:00", "2005-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2011-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "the United Kingdom", "country": "United Kingdom"}, {"location": "France", "country": "France"}, {"location": "Saudi Arabia", "country": "Saudi Arabia"}, {"location": "Netherlands", "country": "Netherlands"}, {"location": "Britain", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "Japan", "country": "Japan"}, {"location": "England", "country": "United States"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "2283871", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Hepatitis E - Sudan: (ND, SF)", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=2283871", "date": "2013-08-01 21:09:19", "main_text": "HEPATITIS E - NETHERLANDS: BLOOD DONORS\n***************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Thu 1 Aug 2013\nSource: Eurosurveillance Edition 2013, 18(31) [summ., edited]\nhttp://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=20550\n\n\nSilent hepatitis E virus infection in Dutch blood donors, 2011 to 2012\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n(By: Slot E, Hogema BM, Riezebos-Brilman A, Kok TM, Molier M, Zaaijer HL.)\n\nSummary\n-------\nIn Europe, the dynamics of endemic hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection remain enigmatic.

We studied the presence of silent HEV infection among Dutch blood donors. Using donations collected throughout the Netherlands in 2011 and 2012, 40 176 donations were tested for HEV RNA in 459 pools of 48 or 480 donations. Deconstruction of the reactive pools identified 13 viraemic donors. In addition, 5239 donors were tested for presence of anti-HEV IgG and IgM and for HEV RNA when IgM-positive. Of the 5239 donations, 1401 (27 percent) tested repeat-positive for HEV IgG, of which 49 (3.5 percent) also tested positive for anti-HEV IgM; 4 of the HEV IgM-positive donors tested positive for HEV RNA. HEV IgG seroprevalence ranged from 13 percent among donors younger than 30 years to 43 percent in donors older than 60 years. The finding of 17 HEV RNA-positive donations among 45 415 donations corresponds to one HEV-positive blood donation per day in the Netherlands. For 16 of the 17 HEV RNA-positive donors, genotyping succeeded, revealing HEV genotype 3, which is circulating among Dutch pigs. Apparently, silent HEV infection is common in the Netherlands, which possibly applies to larger parts of Europe.\n\nIntroduction\n------------\nHepatitis E virus (HEV) is a non-enveloped RNA virus, classified into 4 genotypes. HEV genotypes 1 and 2 have been found only in humans, whereas genotypes 3 and 4 have also been found in animals. The clinical features of hepatitis E are similar to those of viral hepatitis caused by other hepatotropic [having a special affinity for the liver] viruses. In Europe and North America, hepatitis E is known as an acute disease in travellers returning from tropical countries, but an endemic source of hepatitis E has always been suspected. Recently it became clear that genotype 3 of hepatitis E virus (HEV gt-3) is widely spread among pigs in Europe, North America and Japan. Surprisingly, infection of humans by HEV gt-3 seems to cause disease mainly in immunosuppressed persons, such as patients who have received organ transplants, who may develop chronic hepatitis E. Blood donors can be silently infected with HEV, as indicated by plasma pools testing positive for HEV RNA and by a high prevalence of antibodies to HEV among blood donors in the south west of France]. Cases of transfusion-transmitted hepatitis E have been reported. The dynamics of HEV gt-3 infection and its implications for public health and the safety of blood are largely unknown. Which part of the population has signs of resolved or active infection? To estimate the infection pressure of HEV in the Netherlands, we determined the presence of HEV RNA and HEV antibodies in a large number of recent blood donations, collected throughout the country.\n\n[Interested readers should consult the original text via the source URL to view the methodology, results, graphical presentation of the data obtained by the authors, and the references cited. - Mod.CP]\n\nDiscussion\n----------\nThe detection of HEV viraemia in 17 of 45 415 recent Dutch blood donations demonstrates a high incidence of HEV infection in the Netherlands. Our serological screening suggested that roughly one quarter of the Dutch adult population has experienced HEV infection. This proportion compares with the 16 percent of 500 donors in the south-west of Britain, and the 53 percent of 512 donors in the south-west of France, who recently tested positive for IgG anti-HEV, using the same antibody assay as employed in this study. Unfortunately, there is no gold standard for HEV antibody testing. A recent study reports an HEV IgG seroprevalence of only 2.6 percent in 7072 Dutch samples, collected in 2006 and 2007, employing another brand of HEV antibody assay (MP/Genelabs). The Wantai assay used in the present study may suffer from a high level of non-specific reactivity. However, studies comparing the performance of the Wantai and the MP/Genelabs assay demonstrate a higher sensitivity and detection of more sera from PCR-proven cases by the Wantai assay. Classical anti-HEV serology probably lacks sensitivity and seems unsuitable to confirm Wantai EIA test results. In addition, the frequent finding of HEV RNA-positive donors, a striking age-related increase of HEV IgG seroprevalence, and the fact that already in 2005, HEV was found to circulate on 53 of 97 Dutch pig farms, suggest that the high seroprevalence as detected by the Wantai assay may be correct.\n\nUnfortunately, seroprevalence data for persons under the age of 18 are not available. The striking age-related seroprevalence (Figure 2) is difficult to interpret. The age-dependent seroprevalence may simply reflect a long-standing, stable situation, in which people are evenly exposed to HEV in the course of their life. In that scenario, the current high number of viraemic and seroconverting donors may reflect a temporary elevation of HEV infection pressure. If endemic HEV infection were a recent phenomenon, the age-dependent seroprevalence could only be explained by age-dependent exposure or age-dependent susceptibility, which is difficult to imagine for a food-borne pathogen. Alternatively, the seroprevalence curve could reflect an age-cohort effect, caused by transient exposure of older generations in the past. Such a cohort effect has been described in England. The HEV incidence found in this study of 1 percent per year, as well as the high number of HEV RNA-positive blood donors, seem to contradict transient exposure to HEV in the past; but endemic HEV may have returned after a long period of absence.\n\nHEV transmission by blood transfusion has been reported in Saudi Arabia, Japan, France and the United Kingdom. Our results suggest roughly one HEV viraemic donation per day in the Netherlands. This may be an underestimation, considering that the serological screening of 5239 donors only detected antibody-positive donors in a later stage of infection, while the screening for HEV RNA of 40 176 pooled (diluted) donations detected donors in an early stage of infection, with high levels of HEV RNA and low or absent HEV antibodies. HEV RNA-positive blood may pose a threat to immunosuppressed blood recipients, such as recipients of organ transplants and patients with haematological malignancies; and possibly to pregnant women. Because blood transfusion is only a minor source of HEV infection, the routine screening of blood donations for the presence of HEV does not yet seem warranted. Each immunosuppressed patient with unexplained elevated liver enzymes should be tested for the presence of HEV RNA, irrespective of exposure to blood products. Fortunately, it appears that chronic HEV infection in immunosuppressed patients can be cured by a temporary reduction of immunosuppression, or by antiviral treatment using ribavirin.\n\nThe source and transmission routes of HEV gt-3 infection have not yet been uncovered. In contrast to the Midi-Pyrenees region of France, where an association of HEV seropositivity with rural residence was found, the level of urbanisation and the vicinity of pig farms do not play a role in the Netherlands.

For 16 of the 17 HEV RNA-positive donors, genotyping succeeded, revealing HEV genotype 3, which is circulating among Dutch pigs. Apparently, silent HEV infection is common in the Netherlands, which possibly applies to larger parts of Europe.\n\nIntroduction\n------------\nHepatitis E virus (HEV) is a non-enveloped RNA virus, classified into 4 genotypes. HEV genotypes 1 and 2 have been found only in humans, whereas genotypes 3 and 4 have also been found in animals. The clinical features of hepatitis E are similar to those of viral hepatitis caused by other hepatotropic [having a special affinity for the liver] viruses. In Europe and North America, hepatitis E is known as an acute disease in travellers returning from tropical countries, but an endemic source of hepatitis E has always been suspected. Recently it became clear that genotype 3 of hepatitis E virus (HEV gt-3) is widely spread among pigs in Europe, North America and Japan. Surprisingly, infection of humans by HEV gt-3 seems to cause disease mainly in immunosuppressed persons, such as patients who have received organ transplants, who may develop chronic hepatitis E. Blood donors can be silently infected with HEV, as indicated by plasma pools testing positive for HEV RNA and by a high prevalence of antibodies to HEV among blood donors in the south west of France]. Cases of transfusion-transmitted hepatitis E have been reported. The dynamics of HEV gt-3 infection and its implications for public health and the safety of blood are largely unknown. Which part of the population has signs of resolved or active infection? To estimate the infection pressure of HEV in the Netherlands, we determined the presence of HEV RNA and HEV antibodies in a large number of recent blood donations, collected throughout the country.\n\n[Interested readers should consult the original text via the source URL to view the methodology, results, graphical presentation of the data obtained by the authors, and the references cited. - Mod.CP]\n\nDiscussion\n----------\nThe detection of HEV viraemia in 17 of 45 415 recent Dutch blood donations demonstrates a high incidence of HEV infection in the Netherlands. Our serological screening suggested that roughly one quarter of the Dutch adult population has experienced HEV infection. This proportion compares with the 16 percent of 500 donors in the south-west of Britain, and the 53 percent of 512 donors in the south-west of France, who recently tested positive for IgG anti-HEV, using the same antibody assay as employed in this study. Unfortunately, there is no gold standard for HEV antibody testing. A recent study reports an HEV IgG seroprevalence of only 2.6 percent in 7072 Dutch samples, collected in 2006 and 2007, employing another brand of HEV antibody assay (MP/Genelabs). The Wantai assay used in the present study may suffer from a high level of non-specific reactivity. However, studies comparing the performance of the Wantai and the MP/Genelabs assay demonstrate a higher sensitivity and detection of more sera from PCR-proven cases by the Wantai assay. Classical anti-HEV serology probably lacks sensitivity and seems unsuitable to confirm Wantai EIA test results. In addition, the frequent finding of HEV RNA-positive donors, a striking age-related increase of HEV IgG seroprevalence, and the fact that already in 2005, HEV was found to circulate on 53 of 97 Dutch pig farms, suggest that the high seroprevalence as detected by the Wantai assay may be correct.\n\nUnfortunately, seroprevalence data for persons under the age of 18 are not available. The striking age-related seroprevalence (Figure 2) is difficult to interpret. The age-dependent seroprevalence may simply reflect a long-standing, stable situation, in which people are evenly exposed to HEV in the course of their life. In that scenario, the current high number of viraemic and seroconverting donors may reflect a temporary elevation of HEV infection pressure. If endemic HEV infection were a recent phenomenon, the age-dependent seroprevalence could only be explained by age-dependent exposure or age-dependent susceptibility, which is difficult to imagine for a food-borne pathogen. Alternatively, the seroprevalence curve could reflect an age-cohort effect, caused by transient exposure of older generations in the past. Such a cohort effect has been described in England. The HEV incidence found in this study of 1 percent per year, as well as the high number of HEV RNA-positive blood donors, seem to contradict transient exposure to HEV in the past; but endemic HEV may have returned after a long period of absence.\n\nHEV transmission by blood transfusion has been reported in Saudi Arabia, Japan, France and the United Kingdom. Our results suggest roughly one HEV viraemic donation per day in the Netherlands. This may be an underestimation, considering that the serological screening of 5239 donors only detected antibody-positive donors in a later stage of infection, while the screening for HEV RNA of 40 176 pooled (diluted) donations detected donors in an early stage of infection, with high levels of HEV RNA and low or absent HEV antibodies. HEV RNA-positive blood may pose a threat to immunosuppressed blood recipients, such as recipients of organ transplants and patients with haematological malignancies; and possibly to pregnant women. Because blood transfusion is only a minor source of HEV infection, the routine screening of blood donations for the presence of HEV does not yet seem warranted. Each immunosuppressed patient with unexplained elevated liver enzymes should be tested for the presence of HEV RNA, irrespective of exposure to blood products. Fortunately, it appears that chronic HEV infection in immunosuppressed patients can be cured by a temporary reduction of immunosuppression, or by antiviral treatment using ribavirin.\n\nThe source and transmission routes of HEV gt-3 infection have not yet been uncovered. In contrast to the Midi-Pyrenees region of France, where an association of HEV seropositivity with rural residence was found, the level of urbanisation and the vicinity of pig farms do not play a role in the Netherlands. Until recently, little was known of HEV transmission dynamics in European pig populations. Berto et al. describe the presence of HEV in 8 to 73 percent of stool samples collected from pig farms between 2007 and 2011 throughout Europe, and the presence of HEV in fattening pigs. It is unclear whether pigs are the source of the current HEV infections. Intensive pig farming may have become the major amplifier of the virus, considering that millions of pigs are being reared in the Netherlands each year, of which each year again a large part probably acquires and sheds HEV. Subsequently, HEV may be spread via contaminated meat or via faecally contaminated water used for irrigation. Studies are needed to identify the transmission routes of HEV gt-3 to humans, so that appropriate measures can be taken.

We studied the presence of silent HEV infection among Dutch blood donors. Using donations collected throughout the Netherlands in 2011 and 2012, 40 176 donations were tested for HEV RNA in 459 pools of 48 or 480 donations. Deconstruction of the reactive pools identified 13 viraemic donors. In addition, 5239 donors were tested for presence of anti-HEV IgG and IgM and for HEV RNA when IgM-positive. Of the 5239 donations, 1401 (27 percent) tested repeat-positive for HEV IgG, of which 49 (3.5 percent) also tested positive for anti-HEV IgM; 4 of the HEV IgM-positive donors tested positive for HEV RNA.

We studied the presence of silent HEV infection among Dutch blood donors. Using donations collected throughout the Netherlands in 2011 and 2012, 40 176 donations were tested for HEV RNA in 459 pools of 48 or 480 donations. Deconstruction of the reactive pools identified 13 viraemic donors. In addition, 5239 donors were tested for presence of anti-HEV IgG and IgM and for HEV RNA when IgM-positive. Of the 5239 donations, 1401 (27 percent) tested repeat-positive for HEV IgG, of which 49 (3.5 percent) also tested positive for anti-HEV IgM; 4 of the HEV IgM-positive donors tested positive for HEV RNA. HEV IgG seroprevalence ranged from 13 percent among donors younger than 30 years to 43 percent in donors older than 60 years. The finding of 17 HEV RNA-positive donations among 45 415 donations corresponds to one HEV-positive blood donation per day in the Netherlands. For 16 of the 17 HEV RNA-positive donors, genotyping succeeded, revealing HEV genotype 3, which is circulating among Dutch pigs. Apparently, silent HEV infection is common in the Netherlands, which possibly applies to larger parts of Europe.\n\nIntroduction\n------------\nHepatitis E virus (HEV) is a non-enveloped RNA virus, classified into 4 genotypes. HEV genotypes 1 and 2 have been found only in humans, whereas genotypes 3 and 4 have also been found in animals. The clinical features of hepatitis E are similar to those of viral hepatitis caused by other hepatotropic [having a special affinity for the liver] viruses. In Europe and North America, hepatitis E is known as an acute disease in travellers returning from tropical countries, but an endemic source of hepatitis E has always been suspected. Recently it became clear that genotype 3 of hepatitis E virus (HEV gt-3) is widely spread among pigs in Europe, North America and Japan. Surprisingly, infection of humans by HEV gt-3 seems to cause disease mainly in immunosuppressed persons, such as patients who have received organ transplants, who may develop chronic hepatitis E. Blood donors can be silently infected with HEV, as indicated by plasma pools testing positive for HEV RNA and by a high prevalence of antibodies to HEV among blood donors in the south west of France]. Cases of transfusion-transmitted hepatitis E have been reported. The dynamics of HEV gt-3 infection and its implications for public health and the safety of blood are largely unknown. Which part of the population has signs of resolved or active infection? To estimate the infection pressure of HEV in the Netherlands, we determined the presence of HEV RNA and HEV antibodies in a large number of recent blood donations, collected throughout the country.\n\n[Interested readers should consult the original text via the source URL to view the methodology, results, graphical presentation of the data obtained by the authors, and the references cited. - Mod.CP]\n\nDiscussion\n----------\nThe detection of HEV viraemia in 17 of 45 415 recent Dutch blood donations demonstrates a high incidence of HEV infection in the Netherlands. Our serological screening suggested that roughly one quarter of the Dutch adult population has experienced HEV infection. This proportion compares with the 16 percent of 500 donors in the south-west of Britain, and the 53 percent of 512 donors in the south-west of France, who recently tested positive for IgG anti-HEV, using the same antibody assay as employed in this study. Unfortunately, there is no gold standard for HEV antibody testing. A recent study reports an HEV IgG seroprevalence of only 2.6 percent in 7072 Dutch samples, collected in 2006 and 2007, employing another brand of HEV antibody assay (MP/Genelabs). The Wantai assay used in the present study may suffer from a high level of non-specific reactivity. However, studies comparing the performance of the Wantai and the MP/Genelabs assay demonstrate a higher sensitivity and detection of more sera from PCR-proven cases by the Wantai assay. Classical anti-HEV serology probably lacks sensitivity and seems unsuitable to confirm Wantai EIA test results. In addition, the frequent finding of HEV RNA-positive donors, a striking age-related increase of HEV IgG seroprevalence, and the fact that already in 2005, HEV was found to circulate on 53 of 97 Dutch pig farms, suggest that the high seroprevalence as detected by the Wantai assay may be correct.\n\nUnfortunately, seroprevalence data for persons under the age of 18 are not available. The striking age-related seroprevalence (Figure 2) is difficult to interpret. The age-dependent seroprevalence may simply reflect a long-standing, stable situation, in which people are evenly exposed to HEV in the course of their life. In that scenario, the current high number of viraemic and seroconverting donors may reflect a temporary elevation of HEV infection pressure. If endemic HEV infection were a recent phenomenon, the age-dependent seroprevalence could only be explained by age-dependent exposure or age-dependent susceptibility, which is difficult to imagine for a food-borne pathogen. Alternatively, the seroprevalence curve could reflect an age-cohort effect, caused by transient exposure of older generations in the past. Such a cohort effect has been described in England. The HEV incidence found in this study of 1 percent per year, as well as the high number of HEV RNA-positive blood donors, seem to contradict transient exposure to HEV in the past; but endemic HEV may have returned after a long period of absence.\n\nHEV transmission by blood transfusion has been reported in Saudi Arabia, Japan, France and the United Kingdom. Our results suggest roughly one HEV viraemic donation per day in the Netherlands. This may be an underestimation, considering that the serological screening of 5239 donors only detected antibody-positive donors in a later stage of infection, while the screening for HEV RNA of 40 176 pooled (diluted) donations detected donors in an early stage of infection, with high levels of HEV RNA and low or absent HEV antibodies. HEV RNA-positive blood may pose a threat to immunosuppressed blood recipients, such as recipients of organ transplants and patients with haematological malignancies; and possibly to pregnant women. Because blood transfusion is only a minor source of HEV infection, the routine screening of blood donations for the presence of HEV does not yet seem warranted. Each immunosuppressed patient with unexplained elevated liver enzymes should be tested for the presence of HEV RNA, irrespective of exposure to blood products. Fortunately, it appears that chronic HEV infection in immunosuppressed patients can be cured by a temporary reduction of immunosuppression, or by antiviral treatment using ribavirin.\n\nThe source and transmission routes of HEV gt-3 infection have not yet been uncovered. In contrast to the Midi-Pyrenees region of France, where an association of HEV seropositivity with rural residence was found, the level of urbanisation and the vicinity of pig farms do not play a role in the Netherlands. Until recently, little was known of HEV transmission dynamics in European pig populations. Berto et al. describe the presence of HEV in 8 to 73 percent of stool samples collected from pig farms between 2007 and 2011 throughout Europe, and the presence of HEV in fattening pigs. It is unclear whether pigs are the source of the current HEV infections. Intensive pig farming may have become the major amplifier of the virus, considering that millions of pigs are being reared in the Netherlands each year, of which each year again a large part probably acquires and sheds HEV. Subsequently, HEV may be spread via contaminated meat or via faecally contaminated water used for irrigation. Studies are needed to identify the transmission routes of HEV gt-3 to humans, so that appropriate measures can be taken. It seems likely that at this moment other Western countries also experience extensive, silent HEV infection.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Hepatitis E is a liver disease caused by hepatitis E virus (HEV): a non-enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus. HEV is transmitted mainly through contaminated drinking water. It is usually a self-limiting infection and resolves within 4-6 weeks. Occasionally, a fulminant form of hepatitis develops, which can lead to death. Hepatitis E is found worldwide and different genotypes of HEV determine differences in epidemiology. Genotype 1 is usually seen in developing countries and causes community-level outbreaks, while genotype 3 is usually seen in the developed countries and does not cause outbreaks. Although humans are considered the natural host for HEV, antibodies to HEV and closely related viruses have been detected in primates and several other animal species.\n\nIn Europe, the dynamics of endemic hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection remain enigmatic. The authors have studied the presence of silent HEV infection among Dutch blood donors. Genotyping of 16 of the 17 HEV RNA-positive donors revealed the presence of HEV genotype 3, which is circulating among Dutch pigs.

In environments such as the refugee camps in South Sudan, the outcomes are much more serious, especially for pregnant women.\n\nAn interactive HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/r/3q1_. - Mod.CP]\nSee Also\n2012\n----\nHepatitis E - South Sudan (03) 20121110.1403808\nHepatitis E - South Sudan (02): chronic 20120917.1296607\nHepatitis E - South Sudan: refugee camps 20120915.1295615\n.................................................sb/cp/msp/ml", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "cholera", "hepatitis e"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2012-06-16 00:00:00", "2021-11-16 00:00:00", "2021-01-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "South Sudan", "country": "South Sudan"}, {"location": "Batil", "country": "Saudi Arabia"}, {"location": "Maban county 's", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Gendrassa", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Egypt", "country": "Egypt"}, {"location": "South Sudan 's", "country": "South Sudan"}, {"location": "Maban County", "country": "South Sudan"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "1403808", "headline": "PRO/EDR> Hepatitis E - South Sudan (03)", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=1403808", "date": "2011-12-24 14:24:26", "main_text": "HEPATITIS E - INDIA (2): (GUJARAT), WATER-BORNE\n***********************************************\n\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Thu 22 2011\nSource: Times of India, Rajkot [edited]\n\nHepatitis E cases on rise in Mehsana town\n-----------------------------------\nThere has been an increase in the number of patients suffering from\nhepatitis E and jaundice in Mehsana town since September [2011].\nKasba, Hydri Chowk, Babi Vado, Faiza No Vado and Siddhapuri Bazaar\nlocalities in old Mehsana town have recorded over 400 cases so far.\nHowever, the health department has put the number at 68.\n\nA resident of Babi Vado said there are as many as 400 people affected\nby stomach ailments and seven are from his family alone.

He said: \"Not only had the patients not\ntravelled abroad but they didn't fit the normal age range for the\nvirus. \"In other parts of the world it usually affects the young.\nHowever in the cases being seen in the UK, it is the middle aged and\nelderly, particularly men.\" He believes that the main cause is\ncontact with raw pork and is now researching the link.\n\nPatients with liver problems admitted to hospital will be checked to\nsee if the problems had been caused by hepatitis E [virus infection].\nHowever a spokesman for the Health Protection Agency (HPA) said: \"The\nSouth West Peninsula HPA previously worked with Dr Harry Dalton,\nRoyal Cornwall Hospital Trust to investigate a number of hepatitis E\ncases from Dec 2009 to March 2010 in the Cornwall area. The team\nconcluded that there was no epidemiological link between the cases or\nan associated link with eating or handling pork. Although we are\naware of a number of hepatitis E cases in the UK the majority are\nacquired outside the UK or related to travel to endemic countries.\"\nIt is acknowledged that pigs and pork can harbour [hepatitis E virus]\nand that this may be the cause of the disease in cases where there\nhas not been any foreign travel, according to the HPA website.\n\nDr Dalton said those with existing liver conditions are most at risk\nand advised people to take care when preparing pork. He added: \"The\nmessage is not to not eat pork, but to simply make sure it is cooked\nproperly and that hands are washed thoroughly after handling it raw.\"\nDr Dalton believes hepatitis E could be affecting as many as 1200\npeople in the UK every year. He said: \"Victims become jaundiced and\nthis has resulted in patients being misdiagnosed as suffering [from]\nalcohol abuse.\n\nDr Dalton said there have been 3 deaths related to hepatitis E\ninfection over the last 7 years and around 60 cases of hepatitis E in\nCornwall and Devon between 1999-2010, the vast majority of whom have\nbeen seen since 2005. One victim of the disease, a 59-year-old man,\ncontracted hepatitis E and died in July 2006. His 63-year-old wife,\nfrom Newquay in Cornwall, said he started feeling ill while he was\nworking at a factory next door to a pig farm. Medics have told the\nfamily it is unclear whether he caught the virus because of exposure\nto the pig farm or through consuming infected pork.\n\nThe HPA website said there were 178 cases of hepatitis E in Britain\nin 2008 and 179 in 2009. Most people clear the infection without\ntreatment, however people with weakened immune systems or liver\ndisease may need closer observation, it said. There is no vaccine\nagainst hepatitis E [virus infection]. In 2008, 4 people in Britain\nfell ill with the virus after a world cruise. Infected shellfish were\nfound to be the cause.\n\n--\nCommunicated by a correspondent\nwho has requested anonymity\n\n[Hepatitis E was not recognized as a distinct human disease until\n1980. Hepatitis E is caused by infection with hepatitis E virus\n(HEV), a non-enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus.\nAlthough man is considered the natural host for HEV, antibodies to\nHEV or closely related viruses have been detected in primates and\nseveral other animal species.\n\nHEV is transmitted via the faecal-oral route. Hepatitis E is a mostly\na waterborne disease, and contaminated water or food supplies have\nbeen implicated in major outbreaks. Consumption of faecally\ncontaminated drinking water has given rise to epidemics, and the\ningestion of raw or uncooked shellfish has been the source of\nsporadic cases in endemic areas. There is a possibility of zoonotic\nspread of the virus, since several non-human primates, pigs, cows,\nsheep, goats and rodents are susceptible to infection.\nPerson-to-person transmission is uncommon. There is no evidence for\nsexual transmission or for transmission by transfusion. The highest\nrates of infection occur in regions where low standards of\nsanitation. However, sporadic cases of hepatitis E have also been\nreported elsewhere.\n\nIn general, hepatitis E is a self-limiting viral infection followed\nby recovery. Prolonged viraemia or faecal shedding are unusual and\nchronic infection does not occur. Occasionally, a fulminant form of\nhepatitis develops, with overall patient population mortality rates\nranging between 0.5 - 4.0 percent. The incubation period following\nexposure to HEV ranges from 3 to 8 weeks, with a mean of 40 days. The\nperiod of communicability is unknown. There are no chronic infections\nreported. Typical signs and symptoms of hepatitis include jaundice\n(yellow discoloration of the skin and sclera of the eyes, dark urine\nand pale stools), anorexia (loss of appetite), an enlarged, tender\nliver (hepatomegaly), abdominal pain and tenderness, nausea and\nvomiting, and fever, although the disease may range in severity from\nsubclinical to fulminant.\n\nIt has recently been shown that HEV is present in both domestic pigs\nand wild boar in various parts of Europe and the high genetic\nsimilarity between HEV isolates from pigs and humans confirm previous\ninferences of possible zoonotic transmission of HEV.\n\nSee also: \"Detection and characterization of infectious Hepatitis E\nvirus from commercial pig livers sold in local grocery stores in the\nUSA\".

He said: \"Not only had the patients not\ntravelled abroad but they didn't fit the normal age range for the\nvirus. \"In other parts of the world it usually affects the young.\nHowever in the cases being seen in the UK, it is the middle aged and\nelderly, particularly men.\" He believes that the main cause is\ncontact with raw pork and is now researching the link.\n\nPatients with liver problems admitted to hospital will be checked to\nsee if the problems had been caused by hepatitis E [virus infection].\nHowever a spokesman for the Health Protection Agency (HPA) said: \"The\nSouth West Peninsula HPA previously worked with Dr Harry Dalton,\nRoyal Cornwall Hospital Trust to investigate a number of hepatitis E\ncases from Dec 2009 to March 2010 in the Cornwall area. The team\nconcluded that there was no epidemiological link between the cases or\nan associated link with eating or handling pork. Although we are\naware of a number of hepatitis E cases in the UK the majority are\nacquired outside the UK or related to travel to endemic countries.\"\nIt is acknowledged that pigs and pork can harbour [hepatitis E virus]\nand that this may be the cause of the disease in cases where there\nhas not been any foreign travel, according to the HPA website.\n\nDr Dalton said those with existing liver conditions are most at risk\nand advised people to take care when preparing pork. He added: \"The\nmessage is not to not eat pork, but to simply make sure it is cooked\nproperly and that hands are washed thoroughly after handling it raw.\"\nDr Dalton believes hepatitis E could be affecting as many as 1200\npeople in the UK every year. He said: \"Victims become jaundiced and\nthis has resulted in patients being misdiagnosed as suffering [from]\nalcohol abuse.\n\nDr Dalton said there have been 3 deaths related to hepatitis E\ninfection over the last 7 years and around 60 cases of hepatitis E in\nCornwall and Devon between 1999-2010, the vast majority of whom have\nbeen seen since 2005. One victim of the disease, a 59-year-old man,\ncontracted hepatitis E and died in July 2006. His 63-year-old wife,\nfrom Newquay in Cornwall, said he started feeling ill while he was\nworking at a factory next door to a pig farm. Medics have told the\nfamily it is unclear whether he caught the virus because of exposure\nto the pig farm or through consuming infected pork.\n\nThe HPA website said there were 178 cases of hepatitis E in Britain\nin 2008 and 179 in 2009. Most people clear the infection without\ntreatment, however people with weakened immune systems or liver\ndisease may need closer observation, it said. There is no vaccine\nagainst hepatitis E [virus infection]. In 2008, 4 people in Britain\nfell ill with the virus after a world cruise. Infected shellfish were\nfound to be the cause.\n\n--\nCommunicated by a correspondent\nwho has requested anonymity\n\n[Hepatitis E was not recognized as a distinct human disease until\n1980. Hepatitis E is caused by infection with hepatitis E virus\n(HEV), a non-enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus.\nAlthough man is considered the natural host for HEV, antibodies to\nHEV or closely related viruses have been detected in primates and\nseveral other animal species.\n\nHEV is transmitted via the faecal-oral route. Hepatitis E is a mostly\na waterborne disease, and contaminated water or food supplies have\nbeen implicated in major outbreaks. Consumption of faecally\ncontaminated drinking water has given rise to epidemics, and the\ningestion of raw or uncooked shellfish has been the source of\nsporadic cases in endemic areas. There is a possibility of zoonotic\nspread of the virus, since several non-human primates, pigs, cows,\nsheep, goats and rodents are susceptible to infection.\nPerson-to-person transmission is uncommon. There is no evidence for\nsexual transmission or for transmission by transfusion. The highest\nrates of infection occur in regions where low standards of\nsanitation. However, sporadic cases of hepatitis E have also been\nreported elsewhere.\n\nIn general, hepatitis E is a self-limiting viral infection followed\nby recovery. Prolonged viraemia or faecal shedding are unusual and\nchronic infection does not occur. Occasionally, a fulminant form of\nhepatitis develops, with overall patient population mortality rates\nranging between 0.5 - 4.0 percent. The incubation period following\nexposure to HEV ranges from 3 to 8 weeks, with a mean of 40 days. The\nperiod of communicability is unknown. There are no chronic infections\nreported. Typical signs and symptoms of hepatitis include jaundice\n(yellow discoloration of the skin and sclera of the eyes, dark urine\nand pale stools), anorexia (loss of appetite), an enlarged, tender\nliver (hepatomegaly), abdominal pain and tenderness, nausea and\nvomiting, and fever, although the disease may range in severity from\nsubclinical to fulminant.\n\nIt has recently been shown that HEV is present in both domestic pigs\nand wild boar in various parts of Europe and the high genetic\nsimilarity between HEV isolates from pigs and humans confirm previous\ninferences of possible zoonotic transmission of HEV.\n\nSee also: \"Detection and characterization of infectious Hepatitis E\nvirus from commercial pig livers sold in local grocery stores in the\nUSA\".

He said: \"Not only had the patients not\ntravelled abroad but they didn't fit the normal age range for the\nvirus. \"In other parts of the world it usually affects the young.\nHowever in the cases being seen in the UK, it is the middle aged and\nelderly, particularly men.\" He believes that the main cause is\ncontact with raw pork and is now researching the link.\n\nPatients with liver problems admitted to hospital will be checked to\nsee if the problems had been caused by hepatitis E [virus infection].\nHowever a spokesman for the Health Protection Agency (HPA) said: \"The\nSouth West Peninsula HPA previously worked with Dr Harry Dalton,\nRoyal Cornwall Hospital Trust to investigate a number of hepatitis E\ncases from Dec 2009 to March 2010 in the Cornwall area. The team\nconcluded that there was no epidemiological link between the cases or\nan associated link with eating or handling pork. Although we are\naware of a number of hepatitis E cases in the UK the majority are\nacquired outside the UK or related to travel to endemic countries.\"\nIt is acknowledged that pigs and pork can harbour [hepatitis E virus]\nand that this may be the cause of the disease in cases where there\nhas not been any foreign travel, according to the HPA website.\n\nDr Dalton said those with existing liver conditions are most at risk\nand advised people to take care when preparing pork. He added: \"The\nmessage is not to not eat pork, but to simply make sure it is cooked\nproperly and that hands are washed thoroughly after handling it raw.\"\nDr Dalton believes hepatitis E could be affecting as many as 1200\npeople in the UK every year. He said: \"Victims become jaundiced and\nthis has resulted in patients being misdiagnosed as suffering [from]\nalcohol abuse.\n\nDr Dalton said there have been 3 deaths related to hepatitis E\ninfection over the last 7 years and around 60 cases of hepatitis E in\nCornwall and Devon between 1999-2010, the vast majority of whom have\nbeen seen since 2005. One victim of the disease, a 59-year-old man,\ncontracted hepatitis E and died in July 2006. His 63-year-old wife,\nfrom Newquay in Cornwall, said he started feeling ill while he was\nworking at a factory next door to a pig farm. Medics have told the\nfamily it is unclear whether he caught the virus because of exposure\nto the pig farm or through consuming infected pork.\n\nThe HPA website said there were 178 cases of hepatitis E in Britain\nin 2008 and 179 in 2009. Most people clear the infection without\ntreatment, however people with weakened immune systems or liver\ndisease may need closer observation, it said. There is no vaccine\nagainst hepatitis E [virus infection]. In 2008, 4 people in Britain\nfell ill with the virus after a world cruise. Infected shellfish were\nfound to be the cause.\n\n--\nCommunicated by a correspondent\nwho has requested anonymity\n\n[Hepatitis E was not recognized as a distinct human disease until\n1980. Hepatitis E is caused by infection with hepatitis E virus\n(HEV), a non-enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus.\nAlthough man is considered the natural host for HEV, antibodies to\nHEV or closely related viruses have been detected in primates and\nseveral other animal species.\n\nHEV is transmitted via the faecal-oral route. Hepatitis E is a mostly\na waterborne disease, and contaminated water or food supplies have\nbeen implicated in major outbreaks. Consumption of faecally\ncontaminated drinking water has given rise to epidemics, and the\ningestion of raw or uncooked shellfish has been the source of\nsporadic cases in endemic areas. There is a possibility of zoonotic\nspread of the virus, since several non-human primates, pigs, cows,\nsheep, goats and rodents are susceptible to infection.\nPerson-to-person transmission is uncommon. There is no evidence for\nsexual transmission or for transmission by transfusion. The highest\nrates of infection occur in regions where low standards of\nsanitation. However, sporadic cases of hepatitis E have also been\nreported elsewhere.\n\nIn general, hepatitis E is a self-limiting viral infection followed\nby recovery. Prolonged viraemia or faecal shedding are unusual and\nchronic infection does not occur. Occasionally, a fulminant form of\nhepatitis develops, with overall patient population mortality rates\nranging between 0.5 - 4.0 percent. The incubation period following\nexposure to HEV ranges from 3 to 8 weeks, with a mean of 40 days. The\nperiod of communicability is unknown. There are no chronic infections\nreported. Typical signs and symptoms of hepatitis include jaundice\n(yellow discoloration of the skin and sclera of the eyes, dark urine\nand pale stools), anorexia (loss of appetite), an enlarged, tender\nliver (hepatomegaly), abdominal pain and tenderness, nausea and\nvomiting, and fever, although the disease may range in severity from\nsubclinical to fulminant.\n\nIt has recently been shown that HEV is present in both domestic pigs\nand wild boar in various parts of Europe and the high genetic\nsimilarity between HEV isolates from pigs and humans confirm previous\ninferences of possible zoonotic transmission of HEV.\n\nSee also: \"Detection and characterization of infectious Hepatitis E\nvirus from commercial pig livers sold in local grocery stores in the\nUSA\".

He said: \"Not only had the patients not\ntravelled abroad but they didn't fit the normal age range for the\nvirus. \"In other parts of the world it usually affects the young.\nHowever in the cases being seen in the UK, it is the middle aged and\nelderly, particularly men.\" He believes that the main cause is\ncontact with raw pork and is now researching the link.\n\nPatients with liver problems admitted to hospital will be checked to\nsee if the problems had been caused by hepatitis E [virus infection].\nHowever a spokesman for the Health Protection Agency (HPA) said: \"The\nSouth West Peninsula HPA previously worked with Dr Harry Dalton,\nRoyal Cornwall Hospital Trust to investigate a number of hepatitis E\ncases from Dec 2009 to March 2010 in the Cornwall area. The team\nconcluded that there was no epidemiological link between the cases or\nan associated link with eating or handling pork. Although we are\naware of a number of hepatitis E cases in the UK the majority are\nacquired outside the UK or related to travel to endemic countries.\"\nIt is acknowledged that pigs and pork can harbour [hepatitis E virus]\nand that this may be the cause of the disease in cases where there\nhas not been any foreign travel, according to the HPA website.\n\nDr Dalton said those with existing liver conditions are most at risk\nand advised people to take care when preparing pork. He added: \"The\nmessage is not to not eat pork, but to simply make sure it is cooked\nproperly and that hands are washed thoroughly after handling it raw.\"\nDr Dalton believes hepatitis E could be affecting as many as 1200\npeople in the UK every year. He said: \"Victims become jaundiced and\nthis has resulted in patients being misdiagnosed as suffering [from]\nalcohol abuse.\n\nDr Dalton said there have been 3 deaths related to hepatitis E\ninfection over the last 7 years and around 60 cases of hepatitis E in\nCornwall and Devon between 1999-2010, the vast majority of whom have\nbeen seen since 2005. One victim of the disease, a 59-year-old man,\ncontracted hepatitis E and died in July 2006. His 63-year-old wife,\nfrom Newquay in Cornwall, said he started feeling ill while he was\nworking at a factory next door to a pig farm. Medics have told the\nfamily it is unclear whether he caught the virus because of exposure\nto the pig farm or through consuming infected pork.\n\nThe HPA website said there were 178 cases of hepatitis E in Britain\nin 2008 and 179 in 2009. Most people clear the infection without\ntreatment, however people with weakened immune systems or liver\ndisease may need closer observation, it said. There is no vaccine\nagainst hepatitis E [virus infection]. In 2008, 4 people in Britain\nfell ill with the virus after a world cruise. Infected shellfish were\nfound to be the cause.\n\n--\nCommunicated by a correspondent\nwho has requested anonymity\n\n[Hepatitis E was not recognized as a distinct human disease until\n1980. Hepatitis E is caused by infection with hepatitis E virus\n(HEV), a non-enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus.\nAlthough man is considered the natural host for HEV, antibodies to\nHEV or closely related viruses have been detected in primates and\nseveral other animal species.\n\nHEV is transmitted via the faecal-oral route. Hepatitis E is a mostly\na waterborne disease, and contaminated water or food supplies have\nbeen implicated in major outbreaks. Consumption of faecally\ncontaminated drinking water has given rise to epidemics, and the\ningestion of raw or uncooked shellfish has been the source of\nsporadic cases in endemic areas. There is a possibility of zoonotic\nspread of the virus, since several non-human primates, pigs, cows,\nsheep, goats and rodents are susceptible to infection.\nPerson-to-person transmission is uncommon. There is no evidence for\nsexual transmission or for transmission by transfusion. The highest\nrates of infection occur in regions where low standards of\nsanitation. However, sporadic cases of hepatitis E have also been\nreported elsewhere.\n\nIn general, hepatitis E is a self-limiting viral infection followed\nby recovery. Prolonged viraemia or faecal shedding are unusual and\nchronic infection does not occur. Occasionally, a fulminant form of\nhepatitis develops, with overall patient population mortality rates\nranging between 0.5 - 4.0 percent. The incubation period following\nexposure to HEV ranges from 3 to 8 weeks, with a mean of 40 days. The\nperiod of communicability is unknown. There are no chronic infections\nreported. Typical signs and symptoms of hepatitis include jaundice\n(yellow discoloration of the skin and sclera of the eyes, dark urine\nand pale stools), anorexia (loss of appetite), an enlarged, tender\nliver (hepatomegaly), abdominal pain and tenderness, nausea and\nvomiting, and fever, although the disease may range in severity from\nsubclinical to fulminant.\n\nIt has recently been shown that HEV is present in both domestic pigs\nand wild boar in various parts of Europe and the high genetic\nsimilarity between HEV isolates from pigs and humans confirm previous\ninferences of possible zoonotic transmission of HEV.\n\nSee also: \"Detection and characterization of infectious Hepatitis E\nvirus from commercial pig livers sold in local grocery stores in the\nUSA\".

This, however, is a reduction in the\ninfections from 90 cases reported the previous week. According to the\nMinistry of Health, the disease is receding. The ministry said the\ncumulative number of hepatitis [E] infections now stands at 8617.\n\nOnly one new death was reported in Lokung sub-county in the week,\nwhich brings the cumulative deaths to 127 in 41 weeks. \"On the whole,\nthe trend of the hepatitis E outbreak continues to recede in all the\nsub-counties of Kitgum district,\" a statement from the ministry\nstated. Layamo sub-county had 15 of the new cases, while Agoro and\nPadibe reported 10 each. Kitgum Town Council had 6, Mucwini had 5,\nwhile Lagoro and Paloga reported 4 each. Madi Opei, Kitgum Matidi,\nand Namukora reported 2 cases each, while Lokung, Akwang, Omiya\nAnyima, and Amida reported one case each. The statement said Layamo,\nAgoro, Padibe, and Kitgum town council had registered the highest\nnumber of cases.\n\nThe disease, which is spread through consumption of food and fluids\ncontaminated with infected faecal matter, broke out in October last\nyear [2007]. The most affected were people living in camps for the\ninternally displaced and those returning to their villages after the\nLRA [Lord's Resistance Army] insurgency.\n\nThe disease's long incubation period had been responsible for its\nspread, according to the Minister of Health, Dr Stephen Mallinga. He\nsaid recently that the heavy rains in Kitgum had increased\ntransmission of the disease because people returning from camps had\nlimited safe drinking water. The problem was compounded by lack of\npit latrines, with people easing themselves in bushes from where the\nvirus found its way into the water sources. According to Mallinga,\nthere was need for the water ministry to sink more boreholes. He said\nthe Min Health was working with UNICEF (UN Children's Fund) and the\nWorld Health Organisation (WHO) to provide better services in the region.\n\n[Byline: Anne Mugisa)\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Brent Barrett\n\n[Although the outbreak of hepatitis E infection in the Kitgum\ndistrict of Uganda may be beginning to decline, the number of new\ncases is substantial, bringing the overall total in the Kitgum\ndistrict to 8617.

The problem was compounded by lack of\npit latrines, with people easing themselves in bushes from where the\nvirus found its way into the water sources.

It spread to Agoro, Mucwini, Paloga,\nPotika, Padibe, and Lukung sub-counties and is now threatening Kitgum\ntown council,\" the deputy resident district commissioner, Sylvester\nOpira, said on Tuesday [27 May 2008]. \"We are urging people to visit\nhealth centres if they feel feverish. We are also advising couples to\ndelay conception.\"\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Brent Barrett\n\n[The number of cases of hepatitis E reported in the initial account\nof the outbreak in the region of Uganda bordering Sudan (see\nreference below) has increased now from 314 cases and 11 deaths to\nthe current 1797 cases and 35 deaths.\n\nHepatitis E is a liver disease caused by hepatitis E virus (HEV),\nwhich is transmitted in much the same way as other enteric viruses.\nHEV is found in the faeces of people and animals with hepatitis E.\nHEV is spread by eating or drinking contaminated food or water.\nTransmission from person to person may occur.\n\nHepatitis E outbreaks have occurred worldwide in recent years and may\nbe increasing in frequency. The signs and symptoms of HEV infection\nare loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, discoloured urine, jaundice,\nand abdominal pain. There is, however, no chronic (long term)\ninfection. Hepatitis E is more severe among pregnant women,\nespecially in the 3rd trimester.\n\nA map of Uganda showing the location of Kitgum in the north of the\ncountry can be accessed at\n<http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/africa/uganda_pol_2005.jpg>. - Mod.CP]\nSee Also\nHepatitis E virus - Uganda (02): (West Nile) 20080512.1612\nHepatitis E virus - Uganda 20080304.0894\n...................................cp/mj/lm\n\n*##########################################################*\n************************************************************\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.

The near\nuniversal prevalence of antibodies to hepatitis A virus (HAV) by the age of\n5-10 in endemic areas (1) argues strongly against HAV as the cause of large\nepidemics of hepatitis amongst adults in these regions.\nIn 1980, it was shown that HAV was not the cause of a large outbreak of\nwater-born hepatitis in Kashmir (2,3) resulting in 52 000 hepatitis cases\nand 1560 deaths.\nIn 1993, Arankalle and colleagues (4) reported the results of a\nretrospective seroepidemiologic study of 17 epidemics of water-born\nhepatitis, none of which were caused by HAV.\nIn 16 (94 per cent) of these epidemics, evidence of recent hepatitis E\nvirus (HEV) infection was found in 60-100 per cent of patients studied,\nincluding in the large epidemic in Delhi in 1955 involving 29 000 patients\nwith hepatitis, in which all of the 28 archived serum samples were positive\nfor anti-HEV IgM.\nThus, it is indeed likely that many outbreaks of epidemic hepatitis\npreviously ascribed to HAV were in fact caused by HEV (1). With respect to\nthe post preceding Dr McNair Scott's question, we have previously looked at\nHEV infection in Victoria, Australia (5,6). Although autochthonous HEV\ninfection is increasingly recognised in \"non-endemic\" countries, most\ninfections are imported, although referral bias is likely to apply\n(clinicians are less likely to refer for HEV testing in the absence of a\ntravel history).\nI would support the call for increased testing to better explore the\nepidemiology of HEV in non-endemic areas, not least because trends in such\ndiagnoses may even provide early warning of evolving epidemics in endemic,\nless resource-rich areas with less access to routine testing.\nWe have previously compared trends in our laboratory diagnoses of HEV\nagainst reports of HEV outbreaks on ProMED-mail, with a notable association\nbetween reports of epidemics in India and significant increases in\nhighly-reactive anti-HEV serology results at our laboratory (6). A similar\nassociation was not observed for epidemics in other countries, reflecting\nthe close ties and relative frequency of travel between India and Australia.\nReferences\n----------\n1.

The near\nuniversal prevalence of antibodies to hepatitis A virus (HAV) by the age of\n5-10 in endemic areas (1) argues strongly against HAV as the cause of large\nepidemics of hepatitis amongst adults in these regions.\nIn 1980, it was shown that HAV was not the cause of a large outbreak of\nwater-born hepatitis in Kashmir (2,3) resulting in 52 000 hepatitis cases\nand 1560 deaths.\nIn 1993, Arankalle and colleagues (4) reported the results of a\nretrospective seroepidemiologic study of 17 epidemics of water-born\nhepatitis, none of which were caused by HAV.\nIn 16 (94 per cent) of these epidemics, evidence of recent hepatitis E\nvirus (HEV) infection was found in 60-100 per cent of patients studied,\nincluding in the large epidemic in Delhi in 1955 involving 29 000 patients\nwith hepatitis, in which all of the 28 archived serum samples were positive\nfor anti-HEV IgM.\nThus, it is indeed likely that many outbreaks of epidemic hepatitis\npreviously ascribed to HAV were in fact caused by HEV (1). With respect to\nthe post preceding Dr McNair Scott's question, we have previously looked at\nHEV infection in Victoria, Australia (5,6). Although autochthonous HEV\ninfection is increasingly recognised in \"non-endemic\" countries, most\ninfections are imported, although referral bias is likely to apply\n(clinicians are less likely to refer for HEV testing in the absence of a\ntravel history).\nI would support the call for increased testing to better explore the\nepidemiology of HEV in non-endemic areas, not least because trends in such\ndiagnoses may even provide early warning of evolving epidemics in endemic,\nless resource-rich areas with less access to routine testing.\nWe have previously compared trends in our laboratory diagnoses of HEV\nagainst reports of HEV outbreaks on ProMED-mail, with a notable association\nbetween reports of epidemics in India and significant increases in\nhighly-reactive anti-HEV serology results at our laboratory (6). A similar\nassociation was not observed for epidemics in other countries, reflecting\nthe close ties and relative frequency of travel between India and Australia.\nReferences\n----------\n1.

The near\nuniversal prevalence of antibodies to hepatitis A virus (HAV) by the age of\n5-10 in endemic areas (1) argues strongly against HAV as the cause of large\nepidemics of hepatitis amongst adults in these regions.\nIn 1980, it was shown that HAV was not the cause of a large outbreak of\nwater-born hepatitis in Kashmir (2,3) resulting in 52 000 hepatitis cases\nand 1560 deaths.\nIn 1993, Arankalle and colleagues (4) reported the results of a\nretrospective seroepidemiologic study of 17 epidemics of water-born\nhepatitis, none of which were caused by HAV.\nIn 16 (94 per cent) of these epidemics, evidence of recent hepatitis E\nvirus (HEV) infection was found in 60-100 per cent of patients studied,\nincluding in the large epidemic in Delhi in 1955 involving 29 000 patients\nwith hepatitis, in which all of the 28 archived serum samples were positive\nfor anti-HEV IgM.\nThus, it is indeed likely that many outbreaks of epidemic hepatitis\npreviously ascribed to HAV were in fact caused by HEV (1). With respect to\nthe post preceding Dr McNair Scott's question, we have previously looked at\nHEV infection in Victoria, Australia (5,6). Although autochthonous HEV\ninfection is increasingly recognised in \"non-endemic\" countries, most\ninfections are imported, although referral bias is likely to apply\n(clinicians are less likely to refer for HEV testing in the absence of a\ntravel history).\nI would support the call for increased testing to better explore the\nepidemiology of HEV in non-endemic areas, not least because trends in such\ndiagnoses may even provide early warning of evolving epidemics in endemic,\nless resource-rich areas with less access to routine testing.\nWe have previously compared trends in our laboratory diagnoses of HEV\nagainst reports of HEV outbreaks on ProMED-mail, with a notable association\nbetween reports of epidemics in India and significant increases in\nhighly-reactive anti-HEV serology results at our laboratory (6). A similar\nassociation was not observed for epidemics in other countries, reflecting\nthe close ties and relative frequency of travel between India and Australia.\nReferences\n----------\n1.

A WHO\nepidemiologist, Dr Jean Robert Likofata, said on Tuesday [17 Oct 2006] in\nthe capital, Kinshasa, that 4 health zones around the town of Gemena in\nEquateur were threatened by the disease, which has an incubation period of\nbetween 3 and 8 weeks. He said the whole province was threatened by this\nepidemic because Gemena was an \"epicentre\", as it is a market town,\nfacilitating contact with almost the whole population in the area.\nMoreover, Likofata said cases of hepatitis E had been recorded up to 65 km\nsouthwest in the health zone of Bwamanda; 105 km west in the Tandaba zone\nand at least 44 km northwest in the health zones of Bogose and Nubea. \"This\ndisease is transmitted through contaminated water, especially when hygiene\nis not good when it comes to the washing of hands,\" Likofata said. \"And at\nthis market, which dominates Gemena town, you have businessmen coming from\nall around the province.\"\nLikofata led a medical team to Gemena when the first cases were reported in\nJuly 2006, to inspect samples that were later sent to a laboratory in\nKinshasa. Initially, Likofata said, the outbreak was suspected to be yellow\nfever until the laboratory results confirmed it was hepatitis E. He said\nthose affected initially exhibit flu-like symptoms, with high fever, nausea\nand loss of appetite, which could last a week. The next phase is yellowing\neyes, pale faeces and dark urine consistent with liver disease. There is no\neffective treatment aside from bed-rest and fluid replacement, so\nprevention is key.\nBesides sharing information about the disease's symptoms with staff in the\nmain health centres in Equateur, the medical team also conducted awareness\ncampaigns to inform the public about the importance of hygiene in the\nprevention of hepatitis E.\n--\nBrent Barrett\n<salbrent@sbcglobal.net>\n[Hepatitis E virus, has caused large epidemics of enterically transmitted\nself-limiting acute viral hepatitis throughout the Indian subcontinent,\nsoutheast and central Asia, the Middle East, parts of Africa, and Mexico.\nSeroprevalence surveys indicate that the virus is prevalent elsewhere\nsuggesting the existence of strains of differing virulence.\nHepatitis E is a cause of considerable morbidity and mortality and poses a\nmajor health problem in endemic regions. Hepatitis E epidemics are\nwaterborne outbreaks. During these outbreaks, overall attack rates range\nfrom 1 to 15 percent, being higher among adults (3 to 30 percent) than\namong children (0.2 to 10 percent). The outbreaks are characterized by a\nparticularly high attack rate and mortality among pregnant women. In\nnon-endemic regions, hepatitis E accounts for less than 1 percent of\nreported cases of acute viral hepatitis.\nThe clinical disease in humans is typical of viral hepatitis. The liver\nappears to be the only target organ of infection, and its extrahepatic\nmanifestations have been rare. The incubation period ranges from 15 to 50\ndays. The preicteric phase lasts for 1-10 (average 3-4) days, and\ngastrointestinal symptoms, such as epigastric pain, nausea and vomiting,\nare frequently reported. The icteric phase begins abruptly, with the\nappearance of jaundice, dark urine and clay-coloured stools. In\nuncomplicated cases these symptoms last 12-15 days, and complete recovery\nusually takes place within 1 month. About half the patients develop fever\nand 2/3 complain of arthralgia.\nClinical studies have shown that elevation of serum alanine\naminotransferase levels occur as a single peak preceding or coinciding with\nthe onset of jaundice, which is similar to most other forms of viral\nhepatitis. In disease-endemic regions, this infection constitutes an\nimportant cause of fulminant hepatic damage.

A WHO\nepidemiologist, Dr Jean Robert Likofata, said on Tuesday [17 Oct 2006] in\nthe capital, Kinshasa, that 4 health zones around the town of Gemena in\nEquateur were threatened by the disease, which has an incubation period of\nbetween 3 and 8 weeks. He said the whole province was threatened by this\nepidemic because Gemena was an \"epicentre\", as it is a market town,\nfacilitating contact with almost the whole population in the area.\nMoreover, Likofata said cases of hepatitis E had been recorded up to 65 km\nsouthwest in the health zone of Bwamanda; 105 km west in the Tandaba zone\nand at least 44 km northwest in the health zones of Bogose and Nubea. \"This\ndisease is transmitted through contaminated water, especially when hygiene\nis not good when it comes to the washing of hands,\" Likofata said. \"And at\nthis market, which dominates Gemena town, you have businessmen coming from\nall around the province.\"\nLikofata led a medical team to Gemena when the first cases were reported in\nJuly 2006, to inspect samples that were later sent to a laboratory in\nKinshasa. Initially, Likofata said, the outbreak was suspected to be yellow\nfever until the laboratory results confirmed it was hepatitis E. He said\nthose affected initially exhibit flu-like symptoms, with high fever, nausea\nand loss of appetite, which could last a week. The next phase is yellowing\neyes, pale faeces and dark urine consistent with liver disease. There is no\neffective treatment aside from bed-rest and fluid replacement, so\nprevention is key.\nBesides sharing information about the disease's symptoms with staff in the\nmain health centres in Equateur, the medical team also conducted awareness\ncampaigns to inform the public about the importance of hygiene in the\nprevention of hepatitis E.\n--\nBrent Barrett\n<salbrent@sbcglobal.net>\n[Hepatitis E virus, has caused large epidemics of enterically transmitted\nself-limiting acute viral hepatitis throughout the Indian subcontinent,\nsoutheast and central Asia, the Middle East, parts of Africa, and Mexico.\nSeroprevalence surveys indicate that the virus is prevalent elsewhere\nsuggesting the existence of strains of differing virulence.\nHepatitis E is a cause of considerable morbidity and mortality and poses a\nmajor health problem in endemic regions. Hepatitis E epidemics are\nwaterborne outbreaks. During these outbreaks, overall attack rates range\nfrom 1 to 15 percent, being higher among adults (3 to 30 percent) than\namong children (0.2 to 10 percent). The outbreaks are characterized by a\nparticularly high attack rate and mortality among pregnant women. In\nnon-endemic regions, hepatitis E accounts for less than 1 percent of\nreported cases of acute viral hepatitis.\nThe clinical disease in humans is typical of viral hepatitis. The liver\nappears to be the only target organ of infection, and its extrahepatic\nmanifestations have been rare. The incubation period ranges from 15 to 50\ndays. The preicteric phase lasts for 1-10 (average 3-4) days, and\ngastrointestinal symptoms, such as epigastric pain, nausea and vomiting,\nare frequently reported. The icteric phase begins abruptly, with the\nappearance of jaundice, dark urine and clay-coloured stools. In\nuncomplicated cases these symptoms last 12-15 days, and complete recovery\nusually takes place within 1 month. About half the patients develop fever\nand 2/3 complain of arthralgia.\nClinical studies have shown that elevation of serum alanine\naminotransferase levels occur as a single peak preceding or coinciding with\nthe onset of jaundice, which is similar to most other forms of viral\nhepatitis. In disease-endemic regions, this infection constitutes an\nimportant cause of fulminant hepatic damage.

A WHO\nepidemiologist, Dr Jean Robert Likofata, said on Tuesday [17 Oct 2006] in\nthe capital, Kinshasa, that 4 health zones around the town of Gemena in\nEquateur were threatened by the disease, which has an incubation period of\nbetween 3 and 8 weeks. He said the whole province was threatened by this\nepidemic because Gemena was an \"epicentre\", as it is a market town,\nfacilitating contact with almost the whole population in the area.\nMoreover, Likofata said cases of hepatitis E had been recorded up to 65 km\nsouthwest in the health zone of Bwamanda; 105 km west in the Tandaba zone\nand at least 44 km northwest in the health zones of Bogose and Nubea. \"This\ndisease is transmitted through contaminated water, especially when hygiene\nis not good when it comes to the washing of hands,\" Likofata said. \"And at\nthis market, which dominates Gemena town, you have businessmen coming from\nall around the province.\"\nLikofata led a medical team to Gemena when the first cases were reported in\nJuly 2006, to inspect samples that were later sent to a laboratory in\nKinshasa. Initially, Likofata said, the outbreak was suspected to be yellow\nfever until the laboratory results confirmed it was hepatitis E. He said\nthose affected initially exhibit flu-like symptoms, with high fever, nausea\nand loss of appetite, which could last a week. The next phase is yellowing\neyes, pale faeces and dark urine consistent with liver disease. There is no\neffective treatment aside from bed-rest and fluid replacement, so\nprevention is key.\nBesides sharing information about the disease's symptoms with staff in the\nmain health centres in Equateur, the medical team also conducted awareness\ncampaigns to inform the public about the importance of hygiene in the\nprevention of hepatitis E.\n--\nBrent Barrett\n<salbrent@sbcglobal.net>\n[Hepatitis E virus, has caused large epidemics of enterically transmitted\nself-limiting acute viral hepatitis throughout the Indian subcontinent,\nsoutheast and central Asia, the Middle East, parts of Africa, and Mexico.\nSeroprevalence surveys indicate that the virus is prevalent elsewhere\nsuggesting the existence of strains of differing virulence.\nHepatitis E is a cause of considerable morbidity and mortality and poses a\nmajor health problem in endemic regions. Hepatitis E epidemics are\nwaterborne outbreaks. During these outbreaks, overall attack rates range\nfrom 1 to 15 percent, being higher among adults (3 to 30 percent) than\namong children (0.2 to 10 percent). The outbreaks are characterized by a\nparticularly high attack rate and mortality among pregnant women. In\nnon-endemic regions, hepatitis E accounts for less than 1 percent of\nreported cases of acute viral hepatitis.\nThe clinical disease in humans is typical of viral hepatitis. The liver\nappears to be the only target organ of infection, and its extrahepatic\nmanifestations have been rare. The incubation period ranges from 15 to 50\ndays. The preicteric phase lasts for 1-10 (average 3-4) days, and\ngastrointestinal symptoms, such as epigastric pain, nausea and vomiting,\nare frequently reported. The icteric phase begins abruptly, with the\nappearance of jaundice, dark urine and clay-coloured stools. In\nuncomplicated cases these symptoms last 12-15 days, and complete recovery\nusually takes place within 1 month. About half the patients develop fever\nand 2/3 complain of arthralgia.\nClinical studies have shown that elevation of serum alanine\naminotransferase levels occur as a single peak preceding or coinciding with\nthe onset of jaundice, which is similar to most other forms of viral\nhepatitis. In disease-endemic regions, this infection constitutes an\nimportant cause of fulminant hepatic damage. Pregnant women, particularly\nthose in the 2nd and 3rd trimesters, are more frequently affected during\nhepatitis E outbreaks and have a worse outcome.

A WHO\nepidemiologist, Dr Jean Robert Likofata, said on Tuesday [17 Oct 2006] in\nthe capital, Kinshasa, that 4 health zones around the town of Gemena in\nEquateur were threatened by the disease, which has an incubation period of\nbetween 3 and 8 weeks. He said the whole province was threatened by this\nepidemic because Gemena was an \"epicentre\", as it is a market town,\nfacilitating contact with almost the whole population in the area.\nMoreover, Likofata said cases of hepatitis E had been recorded up to 65 km\nsouthwest in the health zone of Bwamanda; 105 km west in the Tandaba zone\nand at least 44 km northwest in the health zones of Bogose and Nubea. \"This\ndisease is transmitted through contaminated water, especially when hygiene\nis not good when it comes to the washing of hands,\" Likofata said. \"And at\nthis market, which dominates Gemena town, you have businessmen coming from\nall around the province.\"\nLikofata led a medical team to Gemena when the first cases were reported in\nJuly 2006, to inspect samples that were later sent to a laboratory in\nKinshasa. Initially, Likofata said, the outbreak was suspected to be yellow\nfever until the laboratory results confirmed it was hepatitis E. He said\nthose affected initially exhibit flu-like symptoms, with high fever, nausea\nand loss of appetite, which could last a week. The next phase is yellowing\neyes, pale faeces and dark urine consistent with liver disease. There is no\neffective treatment aside from bed-rest and fluid replacement, so\nprevention is key.\nBesides sharing information about the disease's symptoms with staff in the\nmain health centres in Equateur, the medical team also conducted awareness\ncampaigns to inform the public about the importance of hygiene in the\nprevention of hepatitis E.\n--\nBrent Barrett\n<salbrent@sbcglobal.net>\n[Hepatitis E virus, has caused large epidemics of enterically transmitted\nself-limiting acute viral hepatitis throughout the Indian subcontinent,\nsoutheast and central Asia, the Middle East, parts of Africa, and Mexico.\nSeroprevalence surveys indicate that the virus is prevalent elsewhere\nsuggesting the existence of strains of differing virulence.\nHepatitis E is a cause of considerable morbidity and mortality and poses a\nmajor health problem in endemic regions. Hepatitis E epidemics are\nwaterborne outbreaks. During these outbreaks, overall attack rates range\nfrom 1 to 15 percent, being higher among adults (3 to 30 percent) than\namong children (0.2 to 10 percent). The outbreaks are characterized by a\nparticularly high attack rate and mortality among pregnant women. In\nnon-endemic regions, hepatitis E accounts for less than 1 percent of\nreported cases of acute viral hepatitis.\nThe clinical disease in humans is typical of viral hepatitis. The liver\nappears to be the only target organ of infection, and its extrahepatic\nmanifestations have been rare. The incubation period ranges from 15 to 50\ndays. The preicteric phase lasts for 1-10 (average 3-4) days, and\ngastrointestinal symptoms, such as epigastric pain, nausea and vomiting,\nare frequently reported. The icteric phase begins abruptly, with the\nappearance of jaundice, dark urine and clay-coloured stools. In\nuncomplicated cases these symptoms last 12-15 days, and complete recovery\nusually takes place within 1 month. About half the patients develop fever\nand 2/3 complain of arthralgia.\nClinical studies have shown that elevation of serum alanine\naminotransferase levels occur as a single peak preceding or coinciding with\nthe onset of jaundice, which is similar to most other forms of viral\nhepatitis. In disease-endemic regions, this infection constitutes an\nimportant cause of fulminant hepatic damage. Pregnant women, particularly\nthose in the 2nd and 3rd trimesters, are more frequently affected during\nhepatitis E outbreaks and have a worse outcome. Mortality rates among\npregnant women, especially those infected in the 3rd trimester, range\nbetween 5 and 25 percent. Frequency of abortions, stillbirths and neonatal\ndeaths is also increased among hepatitis E virus-infected pregnant women.\nControl of hepatitis E outbreaks consists predominantly of measures to\ninterrupt water-borne transmission of disease and appropriate education of\nthe population at risk.\nA map of the Democratic Republic of Congo showing the location of Gemena in\nthe north of Equateur Provincec an be accessed via\n<http://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/english/htmain.htm>. - Mod.CP]\nSee Also\n2005\n----\nHepatitis E - Chad (Eastern)20050822.2477\nHepatitis A & E - India (Hyderabad) 20050328.0894\nHepatitis E - India (Mumbai) 20050107.0044\n2004\n----\nHepatitis E, waterborne - Iraq 20040602.1505\nHepatitis E, waterborne - Iraq (02) 20040924.2642\nHepatitis E - Chad (Goz Amer) 20040819.2299\nHepatitis E - Chad (Goz Amer) (02) 20040831.2424\nHepatitis E - Chad (Goz Amer)(03) 20040906.2490\nHepatitis E - Chad (Goz Amer)(04) 20040915.2570\nHepatitis E - Chad (Goz Amer)(05) 20040927.2667\nHepatitis E - Sudan (Darfur) 20040810.2209\nHepatitis E - Sudan (Darfur) (02) 20040827.2398\nHepatitis E - Sudan (Darfur) (03): background 20040827.2399\nHepatitis E - Sudan (Darfur) (04) 20040830.2419\nHepatitis E - Sudan (Darfur) (05) 20040908.2506\nHepatitis E - Sudan (Darfur)(06) 20040929.2689\nHepatitis E virus, fatal - Japan (Hokkaido) 20041128.3183\nHepatitis E virus, wildlife to humans - Japan (02) 20041127.3172\nHepatitis E virus, wildlife to humans - Japan (Nag... 20040513.1295\nHepatitis E virus - Central African Republic (Bangui) 20040619.1633\nHepatitis E virus - India (West Bengal) 20040423.1129\n...........................cp/pg/dk\n\n*##########################################################*\n************************************************************\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.

The affected areas\nare Chasipara, Lalgarh, Moyrapara, Azadgarh, Burmanpara, Sethbagan,\nChasirmat, Goalabagan, Basakbagan, and Swamiji colony of the Municipal\nareas of South Dum Dum. The outbreak appears to be due to contamination of\nthe water supply in the affected areas. The main manifestation was\njaundice. Although at least 15 relapse cases were reported in Moyrapara,\nAzadgarh, and Goalabagan areas, there was no report of any death from the\ndisease. It has been observed that about 30 percent of the cases have\nalready been cured.\nVirologists attached to the School of Tropical Medicine, Kolkata have\nexamined 20 blood samples from the affected persons, out of which 15\nsamples were positive for hepatitis E virus IgM antibody. At present,\ndrinking water is being supplied by 12 large tankers, halogen tablets are\nbeing distributed, and health workers have already visited at least 280\nhouses. Municipality engineers are now planning for the replacement of 1000\nmeters of asbestos water supply pipeline -- where contamination was\nsuspected -- with iron pipes.\n--\nDr. Satadal Das, M.D., D.C.P.\nConsultant Microbiologist & Infection Control Officer,\nPeerless Hospital & B. K. Roy Research Centre,\nKolkata-700 094, India.\n<sdas201@hotmail.com>\n[Like many enteric viruses, hepatitis E virus possesses a single-stranded\npositive-sense RNA genome within an icosahedral particle. However, it is\nnot closely related, phylogenetically, to other enteric viruses but is\nclassified as a unique virus genus. Hepatitis E virus displays a strong\ntropism for hepatocytes, and it is transmitted via the fecal-oral route. It\nis responsible for an acute self-limited infection characterized as acute\nhepatic inflammation. It has been claimed, however, that in endemic areas\nin India, hepatitis E virus may be a common cause of acute liver failure.\nThe earliest documented cases of hepatitis E virus infection occurred in\nIndia (Dehli) in 1955 after heavy flooding. Subsequently sporadic outbreaks\nhave been recorded throughout Asia, Africa, and Central America, usually in\nassociation with contaminated drinking water. Pigs, rats, deer, and some\nother animals may act as alternate hosts.

The affected areas\nare Chasipara, Lalgarh, Moyrapara, Azadgarh, Burmanpara, Sethbagan,\nChasirmat, Goalabagan, Basakbagan, and Swamiji colony of the Municipal\nareas of South Dum Dum. The outbreak appears to be due to contamination of\nthe water supply in the affected areas. The main manifestation was\njaundice. Although at least 15 relapse cases were reported in Moyrapara,\nAzadgarh, and Goalabagan areas, there was no report of any death from the\ndisease. It has been observed that about 30 percent of the cases have\nalready been cured.\nVirologists attached to the School of Tropical Medicine, Kolkata have\nexamined 20 blood samples from the affected persons, out of which 15\nsamples were positive for hepatitis E virus IgM antibody. At present,\ndrinking water is being supplied by 12 large tankers, halogen tablets are\nbeing distributed, and health workers have already visited at least 280\nhouses. Municipality engineers are now planning for the replacement of 1000\nmeters of asbestos water supply pipeline -- where contamination was\nsuspected -- with iron pipes.\n--\nDr. Satadal Das, M.D., D.C.P.\nConsultant Microbiologist & Infection Control Officer,\nPeerless Hospital & B.
