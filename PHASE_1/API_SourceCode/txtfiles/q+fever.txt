WNSWLHD Manager of Communicable Diseases and Immunisation, Ms. Susan Turcato, is strongly urging farmers and people who work with livestock to get vaccinated against Q fever to guard against being unable to work due to prolonged illness.\n\n'Q fever is a bacterial infection carried by animals - such as cows, sheep and goats - and can lead to chronic lethargy that may last for several months,' says Ms. Turcato.\n\nThere have been 51 confirmed cases of Q Fever reported in the WNSWLHD so far in 2020.\n\nA single dose vaccine is recommended for people who work in high-risk occupations, as well as for people aged 15 years and over who could be exposed to Q fever. 'The risk of ongoing health issues, such as chronic fatigue, can really hit individuals and families hard and affect their ability to work. With all the pressure on farmers and livestock handlers with the recent drought and the COVID-19 pandemic, the last thing we want is for them to be needlessly drained of energy for months on end after being struck down by Q fever,' says Ms. Turcato.\n\nPeople become infected when they breathe in dust particles contaminated by infected animal secretions, which can lead to high fevers and chills, sweating, severe headaches, muscle and joint pains and extreme fatigue. Ms. Turcato urged anyone who might be at risk to consult a GP who can screen for Q fever and vaccinate them, if needed. 'We want people to proactively talk to their doctor about Q fever.'\n\nMs. Turcato said many of the behaviours adopted during COVID-19 can help keep people safe. 'Vigilant hand washing, protective masks, protective clothing and removing clothes worn for chores outside before entering the family home are behaviours to be reinforced because they can protect those who cannot be vaccinated.'\n\nThe NSW Government is investing around AUD1 million between 2018 and 2022 to help protect farmers and other people in rural areas who work with animals from Q fever.

It is highly resistant to drying and heat, which enables the bacteria to survive for long periods in the environment. Its survival is attributed to a small cell variant of the organism that is part of its biphasic developmental cycle. Q fever is a zoonosis. Domestic ungulates such as sheep, cattle, and goats serve as the reservoir of infection for humans. The organism is shed in urine, feces, milk, and especially birthing products; intermittent high-level shedding occurs at the time of parturition, with millions of bacteria being released per gram of placenta.\n\nHumans usually become infected by inhaling aerosolized organisms. Acute symptoms of a flu-like illness usually develop within 2-3 weeks of exposure, although as many as half of humans infected with _C. burnetii_ do not show symptoms (http://www.cdc.gov/qfever/symptoms/index.html). Although most persons with acute Q fever infection recover, others may develop chronic infection, including endocarditis (especially in patients with previous cardiac valvulopathy), chronic hepatitis, chronic vascular infections (especially in patients with vascular grafts or arterial aneurysms), osteomyelitis, osteoarthritis, and chronic pulmonary infections. Chronic Q fever is rare, occurring in less than 5% of persons with acute infection, occurring within a few months to decades after the initial symptomatic or asymptomatic infection. Pregnant women who are infected may be at risk for pre-term delivery or miscarriage and chronic infection. Post-Q fever fatigue syndrome has been reported in up to 20% of patients with acute Q fever.\n\nIn Australia, people most at risk include workers from the meat and livestock industries, shearers, veterinarians, laboratory personnel performing _C. burnetii_ cultures, as well as the general population in close proximity to infected animals in stockyards, feedlots, processing plants or farms. Sporadic cases occur in people living in urban areas that are downwind from farms or abattoirs where the organisms have become aerosolized. Occasional cases follow contact with farm animals or after contact with infected pets such as dogs and cats.\n\nIn Australia, immunization is recommended for high-risk occupational groups. However, there is a risk of severe local reactions to the vaccine in those people previously exposed to Q fever or Q fever vaccine. To assess prior exposure, prevaccination serologic screening is necessary. Any positive result on screening precludes Q fever vaccination (https://www2.health.vic.gov.au/public-health/infectious-diseases/disease-information-advice/q-fever).\n\nAcute Q fever is treated with doxycycline in non-pregnant people for 2-3 weeks. Because early doxycycline treatment (within the 1st 3 days of symptoms) is most effective, treatment of a symptomatic patient suspected of having Q fever should be based on clinical findings and should not be delayed while awaiting laboratory confirmation (https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr6203a1.htm). People who have chronic Q fever usually must take a combination of doxycycline plus hydroxychloroquine for endocarditis or vascular infection for at least 18 months.\n\nWestern New South Wales Local Health District covers around 250 000 square km, with a population of 270 775 residents (2011), 11.1% of which identify as being of Aboriginal or Torres Islander descent (https://www.health.nsw.gov.au/lhd/pages/wnswlhd.aspx).

Q fever is an illness caused by the bacteria _Coxiella burnetii_, carried by animals such as cattle, sheep, goats, and kangaroos.\n\nSymptoms of the disease include fever and chills; severe sweats; severe headache, especially behind the eyes; muscle pain; weakness and tiredness; and weight loss. People become infected with the bacteria by breathing in droplets or dust contaminated by birth fluids, faeces, or urine from infected animals. The spread of infection from person-to-person is rare, and the disease can be treated with antibiotics.\n\nCairns Tropical Public Health Services Public Health Medical Officer Dr Annie Preston-Thomas said there had been more cases than usual, possibly associated with greater numbers of wildlife close to residential areas. 'The bacteria that cause Q fever can exist in a variety of domestic and wild animal species such as kangaroos and wallabies,' she said. 'It can also persist in the general environment in dust and soil, which can lead to infection and disease. If there are obvious animal droppings, please use a P2 mask -- available from hardware stores -- to undertake jobs outdoors such as mowing the lawn. Wash your hands after coming into contact with all animals or their faeces, especially before eating and drinking.'\n\nDr Preston-Thomas said people whose work exposed them to animals, animal products, and animal waste were particularly at risk of developing Q fever. This includes abattoir and meat workers, farmers, veterinarians, animal hunters, wildlife/zoo workers, dog/cat breeders, and other people who work in animal industries. 'There is an effective vaccine available to protect people against Q fever,' Dr Preston-Thomas said. 'Vaccination is recommended for all people who are working in, or intend to work in, a high-risk occupation. High-risk workplaces should have a vaccination program to protect their workforce. Most people make a full recovery from Q fever; however, in about 10-20% of people, chronic fatigue is still present after 12 months, affecting a person's ability to work at full capacity. People may also develop chronic infections that affect the heart, bones, or joints.'\n\nAnyone experiencing symptoms of Q fever is urged to contact their local GP, or phone 13 HEALTH (13 43 25 84).\n\nPeople must be screened and tested before they are vaccinated against Q fever.

Post-Q fever fatigue syndrome has been reported in up to 20% of patients with acute Q fever.\n\nQ fever is distributed worldwide with the exception of New Zealand (https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/9/1/01-0305_article). Q fever is primarily an occupational hazard for farmers, veterinarians, and abattoir workers in contact with domestic animals such as cattle, sheep, and goats and for laboratory personnel performing _C. burnetii_ cultures and working with _C. burnetii_-infected animals (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC88923/).

Any positive result on screening precludes Q fever vaccination (https://www2.health.vic.gov.au/public-health/infectious-diseases/disease-information-advice/q-fever).\n\nSerum antibodies to _C. burnetii_ remain detectable for years, or even for life. In the US, 3.1% of the general adult US population has been found to have detectable antibodies to _C. burnetii_ (https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr6203a1.htm), and the seroprevalence in Queensland, Australia, has been found to be about 5% in rural, as well as metropolitan (Brisbane), settings (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21499708). Because of persistence of a positive serology, a confirmed diagnosis of acute Q fever requires a demonstration of a 4-fold rise in phase II IgG by indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) between serum samples from the acute and convalescent phases taken 3-6 weeks apart (https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr6203a1.htm). A single positive convalescent serum sample (IgG phase II greater than or equal to 1:128) in a patient who has been ill greater than one week indicates a probable acute infection. Serum PCR for Q fever is positive for _C. burnetii_ in almost all patients with early acute Q fever, i.e., during the 1st 2 weeks of symptoms, before the antibody response. Chronic Q fever (i.e., endocarditis) is diagnosed by a phase I IgG antibody titer greater than 1:800 (https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr6203a1.htm#Tab2).\n\nAcute Q fever is treated with doxycycline in non-pregnant people for 2-3 weeks.

See ProMED-mail posting 20200521.7362087.\n\n'Q fever is a zoonotic disease caused by the intracellular bacterium _Coxiella burnetii_. Although it has a wide and diverse host range, in animals this organism is primarily known as a cause of reproductive losses in domesticated ruminants. Clinical cases seem to be most significant in sheep and goats, with sporadic losses and occasional outbreaks that may affect up to 50-90% of the herd. _C. burnetii_ has also been implicated in abortions and stillbirths in some other mammals, though much of this research is still preliminary. Infected animals can be difficult to recognize: nonpregnant animals do not seem to have any obvious clinical signs, and seropositivity is not always correlated with shedding of the bacteria.\n\nHumans infected with _C. burnetii_ often seroconvert without clinical signs or develop a mild, self-limited, flu-like illness. However, this organism can cause more serious syndromes, including pneumonia and reproductive losses. A few people, generally those with pre-existing abnormalities of heart valves or blood vessels, develop life-threatening sequelae. Humans commonly acquire _C. burnetii_ from parturient animals, especially ruminants, which can shed large numbers of bacteria in birth products.

It has been confirmed there have been reports of 4 cases in Nyngan alone.\n\nDr. Kennedy said the bacteria virus [obligate intracellular bacterial pathogen, not a virus] can be carried by cattle, goats, sheep and other domesticated and wild animals, infecting people through contact of birthing fluids or the inhalation of dust containing dried animal secretions, which can be spread by winds. Symptoms often appear like a very severe flu, and include high fevers and chills, severe sweats, severe headaches, muscle and joint pains and extreme fatigue.\n\nDr. Kennedy believes current dry conditions have increased people's exposure levels to livestock, which could be the cause for the recent spike in cases. 'People are out feeding and around animals so much more so I wouldn't imagine prevalence of disease in the livestock in the region is getting higher ... I would say that people's exposure levels have increased,' she said.\n\nDr. Kennedy said anyone in rural areas should be mindful when handling livestock, particularly birthing fluids, encouraging anyone who has contact with animals to get themselves tested then vaccinated. 'If you're a producer out here or have anything to do with livestock you should really go and get tested and vaccinated if you haven't before,' she said.\n\nOne of the key complications of the virus [obligate intracellular bacterial pathogen] is chronic fatigue, which Dr. Kennedy said reinforces why producers in the region need to get tested and vaccinated. 'The cost of chronic fatigue to a producer far outweighs the cost of vaccination. I think this just highlights that producers need to focus and look after themselves so they can then continue to be productive.'\n\nDr. Vicky Sheppeard Director Communicable Diseases NSW Health said a single dose vaccine is recommended for people who work in high-risk occupations and anyone over 15 years who has the potential to be exposed to Q fever. 'Q fever vaccine is not recommended for those aged under 15 at this stage, so it is very important parents make their children wear protective clothing and equipment. For those over 15, skin and blood tests are required before vaccination to make sure there is no previous exposure to Q fever bacteria.'\n\nWhile the vaccination costs hundreds of dollars, the Bogan Shire Council are working to put the vaccine on the Pharmaceutical Benefits scheme to help reduce the costs.\n\n[Byline: Zaarkacha Marlan]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Q fever is due to _ Coxiella burnetii_, an obligate intracellular rickettsia-like bacterial pathogen. It is highly resistant to drying and heat, which enables the bacteria to survive for long periods in the environment. Its survival is attributed to a small cell variant of the organism that is part of its biphasic developmental cycle. Q fever is a zoonosis. Domestic ungulates such as sheep, cattle, and goats serve as the reservoir of infection for humans. The organism is shed in urine, feces, milk, and especially birthing products; intermittent high-level shedding occurs at the time of parturition, with millions of bacteria being released per gram of placenta.\n\nHumans usually become infected by inhaling aerosolized organisms. Acute symptoms of a flu-like illness usually develop within 2-3 weeks of exposure, although as many as half of humans infected with _C. burnetii_ do not show symptoms (http://www.cdc.gov/qfever/symptoms/index.html). Although most persons with acute Q fever infection recover, others may experience serious illness with complications that may include pneumonia, granulomatous hepatitis, endocarditis (especially in patients with previous cardiac valvulopathy), myocarditis, and central nervous system involvement. Pregnant women who are infected may be at risk for pre-term delivery or miscarriage.\n\nIn Australia, people most at risk include workers from the meat and livestock industries, shearers, veterinarians, laboratory personnel performing _C. burnetii_ cultures, as well as the general population in close proximity to infected animals in stockyards, feedlots, processing plants or farms.\n\nIn Australia, immunization is recommended for high-risk occupational groups. However, there is a risk of severe local reactions to the vaccine in those people previously exposed to Q fever or Q fever vaccine. To assess prior exposure, prevaccination serologic screening is necessary. Any positive result on screening precludes Q fever vaccination (https://www2.health.vic.gov.au/public-health/infectious-diseases/disease-information-advice/q-fever).\n\nNyngan, with a population of 2073 people, is a town in the center of the Australian state of New South Wales, in Bogan Shire local government area within the Orana Region, 583 km (362 mi) northwest of Sydney (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyngan).

During his tour, his lawyers said [the private] was in contact with goats and sheep and 'was often required to take cover and jump through ditches and crawl along the ground -- coming into contact with animal products and excrement.' The soldier was medically discharged from the Army in 2014 because of his Q fever and chronic fatigue symptoms.\n\nHumans can catch Q fever by breathing in dust from the secretions of infected farm animals such as sheep, cattle, and goats.\n\nBailey, who specializes in infectious diseases and tropical medicine, and a national expert in Q fever said he has 90 military and 10 civilian cases in his care after they were referred to him. He confirmed the 90 had served in Helmand and said the number of military cases 'built up from 2008', Forces Network reported. Bailey told the court: 'We have seen no new cases since 2014 from Afghanistan. Occasionally we get other military cases from other locations.

This was announced at the briefing on coronavirus [COVID-19] by the national health inspector Prof. Todor Kantardzhiev. More than 20 people in the area tested positive for Q fever and were initially tested for coronavirus.\n\nThe cases are in the villages of Kramolin, Lovni dol, and Sabotkovtsi; only yesterday [18 May 2020] 14 cases with PCR test were registered there. The patients are veterinarians and staff of 2 cow farms and one sheep farm. 'The doctors first looked for coronavirus because of their temperature, but not only the coronavirus causes high fever,' Kanatrdzhiev said.\n\nHe assured that the necessary measures will be taken to limit the infection. Q fever is a disease that is mainly transmitted through domestic animals (cattle, sheep, and goats), and the disease is present in all their bodily products (milk, feces, etc.). In about 50% of sick people, the disease has a clinical manifestation. It is a fever lasting 1-2 weeks, headache, muscle aches, vomiting, diarrhea, and more. Deaths in humans are rare -- less than 2% -- and after illness the body builds long-term immunity.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Q fever is due to _Coxiella burnetii_, an obligate intracellular rickettsia-like bacterial pathogen. It is highly resistant to drying and heat, which enables the bacteria to survive for long periods in the environment. Its survival is attributed to a small cell variant of the organism that is part of its biphasic developmental cycle.\n\nQ fever is a zoonosis. Although it has a wide and diverse host range, in animals this organism is primarily known as a cause of reproductive losses in domesticated ruminants. Clinical cases seem to be most significant in sheep and goats, with sporadic losses and occasional outbreaks that may affect up to 50-90% of the herd. Infected animals can be difficult to recognize: nonpregnant animals do not seem to have any obvious clinical signs, and seropositivity is not always correlated with shedding of the bacteria. The organism is shed in urine, feces, milk, and especially birthing products; intermittent high-level shedding occurs at the time of parturition, with millions of bacteria being released per gram of placenta.\n\nHumans usually become infected by inhaling aerosolized organisms, often when they are exposed to an animal that had aborted but also if birth was at term and seemed normal. Acute symptoms of a flu-like illness usually develop within 2-3 weeks of exposure, although as many as half of humans infected with _C. burnetii_ do not show symptoms (http://www.cdc.gov/qfever/symptoms/index.html). Although most persons with acute Q fever infection recover, others may experience serious illness with complications that may include pneumonia, granulomatous hepatitis, endocarditis (especially in patients with previous cardiac valvulopathy), myocarditis, and central nervous system involvement. Pregnant women who are infected may be at risk for pre-term delivery or miscarriage.\n\nQ fever is frequently an occupationally acquired illness; people most at risk include workers from the meat and livestock industries, shearers, veterinarians, laboratory personnel performing _C. burnetii_ cultures, as well as the general population in close proximity to infected animals in stockyards, feedlots, processing plants, or farms. - Mod.LL\n\nQ fever is an OIE-listed zoonotic disease of animals and is a notifiable animal disease in Bulgaria according to the national legislation. The last outbreak reported to the OIE from Bulgaria dates back to December 2014; it affected cattle in the province Veliko Tarnovo. The Bulgarian State Veterinary Services maintains serosurveillance for Q fever in cattle; the planned surveillance for the period 2016-2018, with earlier data, is presented in Ref 1 (in Bulgarian).

Acute symptoms of a flu-like illness usually develop within 2-3 weeks of exposure, although as many as half of humans infected with _C. burnetii_ do not show symptoms (http://www.cdc.gov/qfever/symptoms/index.html). Additional information on the disease in Bulgaria's human population (2011-2017) is included in Ref 2.\n\n The Bulgarian State Veterinary Services maintains serosurveillance for Q fever in cattle; the planned surveillance for the period 2016-2018, with earlier data, is presented in Ref 1 (in Bulgarian).

AS\n\nHealthMap/ProMED-mail map of Gabrovo, Bulgaria:\nhttp://healthmap.org/promed/p/9062] It is a fever lasting 1-2 weeks, headache, muscle aches, vomiting, diarrhea, and more. Infected animals can be difficult to recognize: nonpregnant animals do not seem to have any obvious clinical signs, and seropositivity is not always correlated with shedding of the bacteria. The organism is shed in urine, feces, milk, and especially birthing products; intermittent high-level shedding occurs at the time of parturition, with millions of bacteria being released per gram of placenta.

The outbreak seems to be centered on Osorno, part of the Los Lagos region. It would be interesting to know geographically where the cases were acquired in the 3 regions as the infectious form can be transmitted through the air over prolonged distances (that is likely why some non-livestock workers are involved). It is likely that more than one livestock farms are involved and that should be able to be obtained from a history of the affected workers.\n\nQ fever, often acquired by close exposure to animals, is infectious with a very low inoculum and may be aerosolized over a significant distance. _Coxiella burnetii_, the causative agent, was discovered in 1937. This infectious form of the organism is an agent that can be resistant to heat and desiccation and is highly infectious by the aerosol route. A single inhaled organism may produce clinical illness. Indeed, in [non-human] primates, the dose to kill 50 percent of primates was found to be 1.7 organisms (1).\n\nCattle, sheep, and goats are the primary reservoirs of _C. burnetii_. Infection has been noted in a wide variety of other animals, including other species of livestock and in domesticated pets. _C. burnetii_ does not usually cause clinical disease in these animals, although abortion in goats and sheep has been linked to _C. burnetii_ infection. Organisms are excreted in milk, urine, and feces of infected animals. Most importantly, during birthing, the organisms are shed in high numbers within the amniotic fluids and the placenta. Contact with contaminated wool is known to be a mode of transmission (2).\n\nThe organisms can be resistant to heat, drying, and many common disinfectants. These features enable the bacteria to survive for long periods in the environment. This very stable form of _C. burnetii_ is associated with compact small cell variants of the organism that are produced during standard replication along with the less resistant large cell form, metabolically dormant and spore-like (3).\n\nInfection of humans usually occurs by inhalation of these organisms from air that contains airborne barnyard dust contaminated by dried placental material, birth fluids, and excreta of infected herd animals. Humans are often very susceptible to the disease, and very few organisms may be required to cause infection.\n\nIngestion of contaminated milk, followed by regurgitation and inspiration of the contaminated food, is a less common mode of transmission. Other modes of transmission to humans, including tick bites and human-to-human transmission are rare.\n\nReferences\n----------\n1.

The patients would have acquired the disease after a visit to La Rioja, where they would have been infected by having contact with infected animals. They spent a weekend in La Rioja, and all of them, during a rural stay, maintained direct contact with newborn goats.\n\nThe spread of Q fever does not occur from person to person but only occurs through direct contact with sick animals. Therefore, the disease, caused by the bacterium _Coxiella burnetii_, has implications for animal health, especially for livestock, and infections can also be caused by the inhalation of bacterial spores that can be transported long distances by dust and wind.\n\nAcute cases of Q fever are often mild, with symptoms similar to those of the flu, and can be treated with antimicrobials. However, chronic cases can cause dangerous infections in the heart and blood vessels and have a poor prognosis.\n\nRecently, the Valencian Ministry of Health reported the existence of another outbreak of Q fever in Villajoyosa (Alicante), with 6 cases declared, all of them now in good health.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\nfrom\nProMED-ESP\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Q fever is due to _Coxiella burnetii_, an obligate intracellular rickettsia-like bacterial pathogen.

Its survival is attributed to a small cell variant of the organism that is part of its biphasic developmental cycle.\n\nQ fever is a zoonosis. Although it has a wide and diverse host range, in animals this organism is primarily known as a cause of reproductive losses in domesticated ruminants. Clinical cases seem to be most significant in sheep and goats, with sporadic losses and occasional outbreaks that may affect up to 50-90% of the herd.

According to DEIA, the 2 people did not work at the plant 7 years ago when the 1st case occurred. The alarm sounded before Holy Week [26 Mar-1 Apr 2018], when several workers began to present the usual symptoms of Q fever. It was at that time that the pit and the tunnels had to be emptied. At that time the Basque Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (Osalan) started the protocol for these cases.\n\nAt the moment only the triage booth has been cleaned and next [Tue 10 Apr 2018] experts from Osalan plan to take samples of different [sites at] the company.

Those affected have been infected with Q fever. The situation is, however, under the control of the health authorities.\n\nQ fever is transmitted by a bacterium found in goats. The Ticino health authorities have therefore ordered the vaccination of exposed animals. In addition, the transport of the animals from one farm to another was prohibited.\n\nInfection with goat milk is considered very unlikely. Even from person to person, the disease is not transmitted. Q fever manifests itself with flu-like illnesses, but without a cold or sore throat. In 1-2 percent of cases there are complications.\n\nQ fever is a notifiable disease in Switzerland. Since the beginning of the year [2019] around 50 cases have been reported, 20 of them from Ticino, said Daniel Koch of the Federal Office of Public Health (FOPH).\n\nTherefore, there will be an increase this year [2019] compared to the approximately 40 cases that have occurred on average per year since 2012. In 2012, the disease was again declared as notifiable after 17 cases of illness occurred in the canton of Vaud.\n\nAccording to Koch, the situation is under control, despite the increased occurrence of illnesses in Ticino. The established monitoring system proved its effectiveness. The last time a major epidemic of Q fever occurred in 1983. At that time, more than 400 people fell ill in Valais.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[HealthMap/ProMED-mail map of Switzerland: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/5893.\nThe Italian-speaking canton of Ticino, with a population of 353 709 residents in 2017, is the southernmost canton of Switzerland, which borders Italy's regions of Piedmont and Lombardy to the south; its largest city is Lugano (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canton_of_Ticino). A map showing the location of Ticino can be found at https://goo.gl/maps/BPDnWTfqa2bi1Wxg9.\n\nQ fever is due to _Coxiella burnetii_, an obligate intracellular rickettsia-like bacterial pathogen. It is highly resistant to drying and heat, which enables the bacteria to survive for long periods in the environment. Its survival is attributed to a small cell variant of the organism that is part of its biphasic developmental cycle. Q fever is a zoonosis. Although it has a wide and diverse host range, in animals this organism is primarily known as a cause of reproductive losses in domesticated ruminants. Clinical cases seem to be most significant in sheep and goats, with sporadic losses and occasional outbreaks that may affect up to 50-90% of the herd. Infected animals can be difficult to recognize: nonpregnant animals do not seem to have any obvious clinical signs, and seropositivity is not always correlated with shedding of the bacteria. The organism is shed in urine, feces, milk, and especially birthing products; intermittent high-level shedding occurs at the time of parturition, with millions of bacteria being released per gram of placenta.\n\nHumans usually become infected by inhaling aerosolized organisms, often when they are exposed to an animal that had aborted but also if birth was at term and seemed normal. Acute symptoms of a flu-like illness usually develop within 2-3 weeks of exposure, although as many as half of humans infected with _C. burnetii_ do not show symptoms (http://www.cdc.gov/qfever/symptoms/index.html). Although most persons with acute Q fever infection recover, others may experience serious illness with complications that may include pneumonia, granulomatous hepatitis, endocarditis (especially in patients with previous cardiac valvulopathy), myocarditis, and central nervous system involvement. Pregnant women who are infected may be at risk for pre-term delivery or miscarriage.\n\nQ fever is frequently an occupationally acquired illness; people most at risk include workers from the meat and livestock industries, shearers, veterinarians, laboratory personnel performing _C. burnetii_ cultures, as well as the general population in close proximity to infected animals in stockyards, feedlots, processing plants, or farms.\n\nThe media report above mentions milk as an unlikely source of human infection, probably relating to pasteurised milk. In fact, _Coxiella_ organisms may be acquired by humans orally from unpasteurized milk or other contaminated material. The importance of tick-borne infections in humans is unclear, although intradermal inoculation was reported to be an efficient route of transmission in human volunteers. See the above and additional information at http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/q_fever.pdf (Updated Nov 2017).\n\nIn Australia, immunization is recommended for high-risk occupational groups. However, there is a risk of severe local reactions to the vaccine in those people previously exposed to Q fever or Q fever vaccine. To assess prior exposure, prevaccination serologic screening is necessary. Any positive result on screening precludes Q fever vaccination (https://www2.health.vic.gov.au/public-health/infectious-diseases/disease-information-advice/q-fever).\n\nIn the EU, Q fever is a reportable disease: for 2016, 29 countries reported 1102 cases, 1058 (96%) of which were classified as confirmed, and Spain, Germany and France accounted for most of the confirmed cases reported in the 5 years, 2012-2016, with 1130, 873, and 638 confirmed cases, respectively (https://ecdc.europa.eu/sites/portal/files/documents/q-fever-annual-epidemiological-report-2016.pdf).\n\nSwitzerland\n-----------\nThe low incidence of Q fever is about 0.15 cases per 100 000 inhabitants, corresponding to around 10-12 infections per year (http://www.bag.admin.ch/dokumentation/publikationen), prompted public health authorities to stop mandatory reporting in 1999, but mandatory reporting of Q fever was resumed in 2012 after a cluster of human cases was detected (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4184577/).\n\nThe Federal Food Safety and Veterinary Office (https://www.blv.admin.ch/blv/de/home/tiere/tierseuchen/uebersicht-seuchen/alle-tierseuchen/coxiellose-beim-tier-und-q-fieber-beim-mensch.html) mandates:\n- Livestock keepers must report any abortion of cattle, sheep, or goats to their vet. When an animal holding experiences more than one abortion within 4 months, abortion-related tissues should also be examined for _C. burnetii_.\n- If coxiellosis occurs in a herd of cattle, sheep, or goats, the aborting and the animals in high pregnancy should be separated from the rest of the herd into separate boxes as a precautionary measure. All aborted foeti and afterbirths should be examined, and stables cleaned and disinfected.\n- The Swiss veterinary legislation further prescribes the elimination of infected and contaminated animals as conditional to the rehabilitation of the herd. Sheep should be sheared and the wool disposed of. Ruminants in petting zoos are to be regularly tested for _C. burnetii_ and if necessary, removed.\n- Exposed occupational groups, which often have close contact with ruminants and their products, should pay attention to the general hygiene measures.\n\nVaccination of ruminants against coxiellosis is not authorized in Switzerland. However, as reported above, in certain conditions this ban may undergo temporary alleviations.

To date there are already 59 suspect cases and 3 confirmed cases in Osorno, of which 82 percent are livestock workers. Symptoms of the disease include fever, headache, and gastrointestinal and respiratory discomfort. While there have been no reports of deaths, 18 patients have required hospitalization for pneumonia and 3 of them were connected to mechanical ventilation.\n\nIn the zone, authorities and productive unions assure that they have increased the preventive measures. 'The contact with the bacterium occurs mainly in the management of the partuition of a cow or a sheep. Shelter measures are always taken, such as the use of gloves, but now with the aim of reducing or avoiding the maximum possible contact, additional measures are being taken,' explained Eduardo Schwerter, president of Agrollanquihue, association of agricultural entrepreneurs.\n\nOne of these measures is the frequent disinfection of the bibs and the elements used during these processes. This is in addition to other safeguards that the sanitary authority had dictated, such as the restriction of the movement of animals from farms with an active outbreak, the recommendation of not consuming unpasteurized milk and the restriction of blood donations. According to Schwerter, the disease has existed for years in the country, however, until now it did not affect people. 'It is a situation that is in a stage of low incidence, but we are interested in being studied to the maximum, to transmit peace of mind to workers and consumers,' he said, adding that they are in coordination with the Ministries of Health and Agriculture and the Mutual de Seguridad .\n\nFor its part, the head of Prevention of the Hospital, Laura Moratilla, recalled that take 'routine samples' of the ICU and operating rooms, as well as isolation rooms and other areas to rule out dangers.\n\n[Byline: C. Mardones y L. Leiva]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[La Araucania is the 3rd region of Chile to be reported to be involved in the outbreak. These 3 regions are adjacent to one another and can be seen on a map at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regions_of_Chile. The outbreak seems to be centered on Osorno, part of the Los Lagos region, the southernmost of the 3 regions involved. It would be interesting to know geographically where the cases were acquired in the 3 regions as the infectious form can be transmitted through the air over prolonged distances (that is likely why some non-livestock workers are involved). It is likely that more than one livestock farms are involved and that should be able to be obtained from a history of the affected workers.\n\nQ fever, often acquired by close exposure to animals, is infectious with a very low inoculum and may be aerosolized over a significant distance. _Coxiella burnetii_, the causative agent, was discovered in 1937. This infectious form of the organism is an agent that can be resistant to heat and desiccation and is highly infectious by the aerosol route. A single inhaled organism may produce clinical illness. Indeed, in [non-human] primates, the dose to kill 50 percent of primates was found to be 1.7 organisms (1).\n\nCattle, sheep, and goats are the primary reservoirs of _C. burnetii_. Infection has been noted in a wide variety of other animals, including other species of livestock and in domesticated pets. _C. burnetii_ does not usually cause clinical disease in these animals, although abortion in goats and sheep has been linked to _C. burnetii_ infection. Organisms are excreted in milk, urine, and feces of infected animals. Most importantly, during birthing, the organisms are shed in high numbers within the amniotic fluids and the placenta. Contact with contaminated wool is known to be a mode of transmission (2).\n\nThe organisms can be resistant to heat, drying, and many common disinfectants. These features enable the bacteria to survive for long periods in the environment. This very stable form of _C. burnetii_ is associated with compact small cell variants of the organism that are produced during standard replication along with the less resistant large cell form, metabolically dormant and spore-like (3).\n\nInfection of humans usually occurs by inhalation of these organisms from air that contains airborne barnyard dust contaminated by dried placental material, birth fluids, and excreta of infected herd animals. Humans are often very susceptible to the disease, and very few organisms may be required to cause infection.\n\nIngestion of contaminated milk, followed by regurgitation and inspiration of the contaminated food, is a less common mode of transmission. Other modes of transmission to humans, including tick bites and human-to-human transmission are rare.\n\nReferences\n----------\n1.

The current observation may indicate the need for more attention to the potential role of pets, particularly cats; the stray cat population in Israel is estimated to exceed 6-figure numbers, with high densities observed in urban areas.

Humans usually become infected by inhaling aerosolized organisms that are shed in urine, feces, milk, and especially birthing products of infected animals; intermittent high-level shedding occurs at the time of parturition, with millions of bacteria being released per gram of placenta.\n\nQ fever spreads in air currents for a considerable distance in agricultural regions via airborne particles containing the _C. burnetii_ to involve people living downwind from infected livestock. Widespread transmission of Q fever was recently documented in the Netherlands downwind from the index farm, a single dairy-goat farm, even beyond a 5 km (3 mi) high-risk zone (http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/55/12/1591.long#T2). _C. burnetii_ is highly resistant to drying, heat, and many common disinfectants, which is attributed to a small cell variant of the organism that is part of a biphasic developmental cycle. These features enable the bacteria to survive for long periods in the environment.\n\nAlthough often asymptomatic, the infection can present acutely 2-3 weeks after exposure as atypical pneumonia or hepatitis or as a chronic disease (mainly endocarditis) (Maurin M, Raoult D. Q fever. Clin Microbiol Rev. 1999; 12(4): 518-53; available at http://cmr.asm.org/content/12/4/518.short.) Unusual complications include glomerulonephritis and rhabdomyolysis (http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/08860220701460178).\n\nDiagnosis of Q fever can usually be confirmed by serology (https://emergency.cdc.gov/agent/qfever/clinicians/diagnosis.asp). In acute Q fever, phase II antibodies are usually much higher than phase I antibodies and are detectable by indirect immunofluorescence 2 to 3 weeks after onset of illness. In chronic Q fever, phase I antibody titers are much greater than phase II titers. Phase I antibody titers of 1:800 or higher are considered diagnostic in endocarditis patients for chronic Q fever.\n\nThe tetracyclines are considered the antibiotics of choice for treatment of acute Q fever.

Cases in humans and in farm animals (cattle, sheep and goats) are recorded every year; in the latter, the infection is manifested by abortions, causing considerable economic losses. \n\nDiagnosis of Q fever can usually be confirmed by serology (https://emergency.cdc.gov/agent/qfever/clinicians/diagnosis.asp).", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "q fever"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["1999-03-25 00:00:00", "2016-03-25 00:00:00", "2005-03-25 00:00:00", "1984-03-25 00:00:00", "2017-03-25 00:00:00", "1988-03-25 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Netherlands", "country": "Netherlands"}, {"location": "Australia", "country": "Australia"}, {"location": "the United States", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Israel", "country": "Israel"}, {"location": "Canada", "country": "Canada"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "4437074", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Q fever - Australia (02): (VI) meat processing workers", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=4437074", "date": "2016-08-24 10:41:59", "main_text": "Q FEVER - AUSTRALIA (02): (VICTORIA) MEAT PROCESSING WORKERS\n************************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Tue 23 Aug 2016 11:44 PM (GMT+10)\nSource: The Age, Victoria [edited]\nhttp://www.theage.com.au/victoria/health-officials-investigate-q-fever-outbreak-in-melbournes-west-20160822-gqyryy.html\n\n\nHealth officials are investigating an outbreak of a rare and potentially serious infectious disease among meat workers in Melbourne's western suburbs. People working in and around Vic Wide Meat Brokers and WJ Drever in Laverton North are being tested for Q fever after 6 employees of the 2 meat [processing] businesses fell ill with it.\n\nOther staff working at the site and at similar businesses nearby are now being contacted to ensure they are vaccinated against the disease, which usually produces flu-like symptoms and can cause pneumonia and liver inflammation. While only half of all people infected with it get symptoms, it is fatal for 1 to 2 percent of those people.\n\nThe Victorian department of health is now writing to contractors who may have visited the site since late last year [2015] to provide them with advice about signs and symptoms. The businesses are located at 9 Holcourt Road in Laverton North.\n\nThis year [2016], 5 meat workers have tested positive for Q fever in Melbourne.\n\n'Both the Department and WorkSafe officials have visited and inspected the premises to check on the vaccination status of other staff, and arrange testing and vaccinations, as required,' said Victoria's Chief Health Officer Professor Charles Guest. 'At this stage there is no broader public health issue as our investigation shows all exposures have been confined to the site and have occurred in the workplace.'\n\nProfessor Guest said Q fever is the name given to human infections caused by the bacterium, _Coxiella burnetii_. 'It is transmitted by contact with cattle, sheep, and goats and other animals and is a risk for people who work with these animals or their products, such as abattoir workers and farmers,' he said. 'The signs and symptoms of Q fever are fever, usually with severe headache, weakness, muscle aches, and sweats lasting 2 or 3 weeks -- similar to severe influenza. A small percentage of people with Q fever infection report on-going fatigue and weakness that may persist for months. In some cases the illness is asymptomatic, with past exposure only becoming evident on skin and blood testing. Q fever is not spread person to person.'\n\nBarry Hall, CEO of WJ Drever, an offal supplier adjoining Vic Wide Meat Brokers, said his business appeared to be the source of the infections. He said the workers who fell ill with it probably inhaled steam coming from his plant that had the bacteria in it. Mr Hall said he had rectified this problem and that all meat was being cooked at high heat to ensure the bacteria were eliminated. 'We've been in business for 90 years and this is the 1st time it has happened,' he said. 'With the help of the health department... we've contained it pretty well... we're under control.'\n\nA spokesman for the department of health said there was no risk to people eating meat supplied by the businesses. According to the South Australian department of health, the bacterium _Coxiella burnetii_ is passed into milk, urine and faeces of infected animals and during birthing, large numbers of organisms are shed in the birth products. People usually inhale it in air carrying dust contaminated by the bacteria. Contaminated clothing, wool, hides, or straw may also be a source of infection.\n\n[Byline: Julia Medew]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[For a discussion of Q fever, see my comments in ProMED-mail post Q fever - Australia: (NS) 20150717.3516801.\n\nMaps of Australia can be seen at http://maps.unomaha.edu/peterson/funda/MapLinks/Australia/Australia_files/image001.gif and http://healthmap.org/promed/p/55056. - Mod.ML]", "summary": "A ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n Communicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[For a discussion of Q fever, see my comments in ProMED-mail post Q fever - Australia: (NS) 20150717.3516801.

The infection is almost always related to direct or indirect contact with animals such as cattle, sheep or goats, although a wide range of animals including cats, dogs and kangaroos may carry the infection. Infection in animals is probably common, but animals usually do not appear to be ill.\n\nThe bacteria pass into milk, urine and faeces of infected animals and during birthing, large numbers of organisms are shed in the birth products. Q fever organisms are resistant to heat, drying, and many common disinfectants, allowing them to survive for long periods in the environment.\n\nInfection of humans usually occurs by inhalation of the bacteria in air carrying dust contaminated by dried placental material, birth fluids, urine or faeces of infected herd animals. Contaminated clothing, wool, hides or straw may also be a source of infection. Person-to-person spread is extremely unlikely. Usually, Q fever is an occupational disease of meat workers, farmers and veterinarians (vets). People living within 1 kilometre [about 0.6 miles] downwind of an abattoir are also at increased risk of infection.\n\nOnly about half of all people infected with _Coxiella burnetii_ show signs of clinical illness, but onset of symptoms is usually sudden, with one or more of the following:\n- fever, which may last for up to 4 weeks\n- severe headache\n- sweats and chills\n- fatigue -- and a prolonged fatigue (post Q fever fatigue syndrome) may follow infection\n- muscle aches\n- confusion\n- sore throat\n- dry cough\n- chest pain on breathing\n- nausea, vomiting\n- diarrhoea\n- abdominal pain.\n\nUp to half of symptomatic cases will develop pneumonia (lung infection or inflammation) and many people will have inflammation of the liver (hepatitis). However, most people will recover within several months without any treatment and only 1 to 2 percent of people with acute Q fever die of the disease.\n\nSome people may develop chronic Q fever after exposure. Infection persists for more than 6 months and may not be apparent until many years after the initial infection. It is rare, but can have serious complications such as endocarditis (infection of the heart valves).\n\nPeople at most risk of developing chronic Q fever include:\n- those with underlying heart abnormalities\n- transplant recipients\n- cancer patients\n- those with chronic kidney disease.\n\nIncubation time is approximately 2-3 weeks but can range from 4 days to 6 weeks.\n\nDiagnosis is made by a series of blood tests.\n\nEffective antibiotic therapy is available. With early diagnosis, treatment is simple and a good outcome can be expected.\n\nIt is extremely rare for the disease to pass between people. So keeping someone home from work/school/social events is not necessary. What is necessary to prevent the spread is to refrain from drinking unpasteurized milk.\n\nA Q fever vaccine is available in Australia and is 83 to 100 percent effective in preventing the disease. However, the vaccine can only be given to individuals 15 years of age and over.\n\nPrior to immunisation, a blood and a skin test is recommended to see if the individual has previously been exposed to Q fever -- either naturally or by previous vaccination. Vaccinating those already exposed to Q fever can result in severe reactions.\n\nVaccination will not prevent disease in someone who has already been infected but is in the incubation period of the disease.\n\nQ fever vaccination is recommended for:\n- abattoir workers and contract workers in cattle, sheep dairy and goat abattoirs (but not pig abattoirs)\n- farmers, stockyard workers and livestock transporters\n- agricultural college staff and students and wildlife and zoo workers exposed to high risk animals\n- shearers and wool sorters\n- veterinarians, veterinary nurses and students\n- professional dog and cat breeders, tanning and hide workers and laboratory personnel handling veterinary products or working with the organism\n- others exposed to cattle, camels, sheep, goats and kangaroos or their products.\n\nPeople considering immunisation against Q fever should contact their doctor or an approved Q fever vaccination provider in South Australia. The Q fever vaccination register contains the location and contact details of approved Q fever vaccination providers in South Australia.\n\nThe information provided by the SA Health website is applicable to other countries as well, albeit not all countries have kangaroos or they are only in zoos and therefore zoo workers may need to be alerted to this situation.\n\nPortions of this comment were extracted from: http://www.sahealth.sa.gov.au/wps/wcm/connect/Public+Content/SA+Health+Internet/Health+topics/Health+conditions+prevention+and+treatment/Infectious+diseases/Q+fever/Q+fever+-+including+symptoms+treatment+and+prevention - Mod.TG\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/286.]", "summary": "\n\nOnly about half of all people infected with _Coxiella burnetii_ show signs of clinical illness, but onset of symptoms is usually sudden, with one or more of the following:\n- fever, which may last for up to 4 weeks\n- severe headache\n- sweats and chills\n- fatigue -- and a prolonged fatigue (post Q fever fatigue syndrome) may follow infection\n- muscle aches\n- confusion\n- sore throat\n- dry cough\n- chest pain on breathing\n- nausea, vomiting\n- diarrhoea\n- abdominal pain. \n\nQ fever vaccination is recommended for:\n- abattoir workers and contract workers in cattle, sheep dairy and goat abattoirs (but not pig abattoirs)\n- farmers, stockyard workers and livestock transporters\n- agricultural college staff and students and wildlife and zoo workers exposed to high risk animals\n- shearers and wool sorters\n- veterinarians, veterinary nurses and students\n- professional dog and cat breeders, tanning and hide workers and laboratory personnel handling veterinary products or working with the organism\n- others exposed to cattle, camels, sheep, goats and kangaroos or their products. \n\nPeople at most risk of developing chronic Q fever include:\n- those with underlying heart abnormalities\n- transplant recipients\n- cancer patients\n- those with chronic kidney disease.

The situation has worsened and infections have risen to 56, according to the Assistant Sub-Secretary of Public Health, Cristian Herrera.\n\nAs a result of this scenario and according to sources of Radio Bio Bio, the Ministry of Health would decree sanitary alert in 2 regions of the country, Los Lagos and Los Rios, to face the outbreak of this disease. In fact, the Undersecretariat sent the decree to the Comptroller's Office on [Mon 6 Nov 2017] and is awaiting approval.\n\nThe disease is difficult to detect in Chile, since the transfer to humans is unusual and there is no easy way to confirm it. Because of this, international assistance is requested, which is what the Ministry of Health did a few weeks ago, by contacting the World Health Organization (WHO), Canada and the University of Queensland.\n\nThe past president of the Chilean Society of Infectology, Jeanette Dabanch, said that it is a new disease in Chile because although it is common in animals, without causing any symptoms, human infection is uncommon. Dabanch added that it is difficult to establish - for now - the true magnitude of the outbreak in humans and to quantify the proportion of cases, which could increase.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Q fever, often acquired by close exposure to animals, is infectious with a very low inoculum and may be aerosolized over a significant distance. _Coxiella burnetii_, the causative agent, was discovered in 1937. This organism is an agent that can be resistant to heat and desiccation and is highly infectious by the aerosol route. A single inhaled organism may produce clinical illness. Indeed, in [non-human] primates, the dose to kill 50 percent of primates was found to be 1.7 organisms (1).\n\nCattle, sheep, and goats are the primary reservoirs of _C. burnetii_. Infection has been noted in a wide variety of other animals, including other species of livestock and in domesticated pets. _C. burnetii_ does not usually cause clinical disease in these animals, although abortion in goats and sheep has been linked to _C. burnetii_ infection. Organisms are excreted in milk, urine, and feces of infected animals. Most importantly, during birthing, the organisms are shed in high numbers within the amniotic fluids and the placenta. Contact with contaminated wool is known to be a mode of transmission (2).\n\nThe organisms can be resistant to heat, drying, and many common disinfectants. These features enable the bacteria to survive for long periods in the environment. This very stable form of _C. burnetii_ is associated with compact small cell variants of the organism that are produced during standard replication along with the less resistant large cell form, metabolically dormant and spore-like (3).\n\nInfection of humans usually occurs by inhalation of these organisms from air that contains airborne barnyard dust contaminated by dried placental material, birth fluids, and excreta of infected herd animals. Humans are often very susceptible to the disease, and very few organisms may be required to cause infection.\n\nIngestion of contaminated milk, followed by regurgitation and inspiration of the contaminated food, is a less common mode of transmission. Other modes of transmission to humans, including tick bites and human-to-human transmission are rare.\n\nReferences\n----------\n1.

But people living on small acreages in the Townsville and Mackay regions are now the group most at risk of contracting the disease in Queensland.\n\nTownsville Hospital director of microbiology Robert Norton began investigating the issue a few years ago when he noticed most patients being treated for Q fever tended to live on lifestyle blocks. It is suspected the disease is being transmitted by native animals.\n\n'Wallabies in particular will come down to feed on the new grass. They'll leave their droppings, and when the area is mowed, these droppings are aerosolized, and the person doing the mowing breathes them in,' Professor Norton said. 'We've done some surveys of a variety of animals, and we found that between 30 and 40 per cent of the wallabies surveyed tested positive for Q fever, and this compares with about 15 to 20 per cent of cattle.' Bandicoots and possums were also found to be carriers, along with suburban dogs.\n\nThe Q fever rate among humans in Australia is between 1 and 2 people for every 100 000, and in Queensland, it affects 3 per 100 000. However, Professor Norton said statistics from hospital records showed that in the Townsville region, the Q fever rate was 6 in every 100 000 people, and in specific suburbs, it affected 30 per 100 000. In one Mackay area, the rate is 50 in 100 000 people.\n\n'These are people who have been ill enough to need hospital admission or a hospital review,' Professor Norton said. 'About 20 to 30 per cent of people who are infected will require hospital admission, and in less than 5 per cent of people, it can be quite severe and has led to death.'\n\nPregnant women, or women planning to become pregnant, are particularly in danger. 'Pregnant women are at risk of having a stillbirth or a miscarriage if they get Q fever, and this has occurred in the regions mentioned,' Professor Norton said.\n\nRural Doctors Association Queensland president Konrad Kangru, who is also a GP in Proserpine, one of the affected areas, said people living on small acreages in dry areas of north Queensland should be alert but not alarmed. 'Just like with cyclones and irukandji [a highly venomous box jellyfish - CopyEd.MSP] and everything else, living up in these areas does have its risks, and certainly, the _Coxiella burnetii_ bacteria in the soil are one that we have to watch out for,' he said.\n\nPeople who are involved in soil work are urged to talk to their GP about being vaccinated. 'What we're seeing is you've got a lot of land which has previously been grazing properties or cane farms that are now being resumed for residential development,' Dr Kangru said. 'Anybody who is involved in earthworks, anybody who's involved in setting up those new developments and construction, they need to be thinking about what sort of inhalational soil exposure they might have.'\n\nDr Kangru said patients often did not realise they had had the disease, because of its influenza-like symptoms. 'Very often, we'll actually do a blood test for Q fever, and it'll show that somebody's had a previous exposure to the illness even though they haven't been acutely unwell with it,' he said.\n\nPeople who have been exposed in the past have to be tested for any adverse reactions before having a Qvax inoculation, because it can cause extreme side effects in those who have already had the disease. For this reason, Anthony Gregory, a post-doctoral research fellow at Texas A&M University, is working on developing an alternative vaccine through funding from the US military. 'In a recent study in 2012, of 1000 US troops who were deployed to Iraq, 10 per cent of them were seropositive to Q fever,' he said. 'Because of the reactogenicity associated with Qvax in hyper-sensitised individuals, it meant that 10 per cent of this population were not eligible for the vaccine.'\n\nThe United States also wants a new vaccine to prepare for _Coxiella burnetii_ possibly being used as a bio-threat. 'It's categorized as a CDC tier 2 select agent as a bio-weapon,' Dr Gregory said. 'It has previously been developed, I believe by the Soviets during World War II.' Initial trials of the alternative vaccine on mice and guinea pigs have shown promise, but human trials are not expected for several years.\n\n[Byline: Ren\u00e9e Cluff]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Q fever, often acquired by close exposure to animals, is infectious with a very low inoculum and may be aerosolized over a significant distance. _Coxiella burnetii_, the causative agent, was discovered in 1937.

It should be noted that most of the cases are workers in the dairy industry.\n\nQ fever, which is transmitted to humans through contact with animals, has symptoms such as fever, as well as gastrointestinal and respiratory complaints. Because it is the 1st time that an outbreak of this magnitude has occurred in Chile, the Ministry of Health requested assistance from Australian experts to investigate the cases.\n\nBurrows said that 'it is working to control the outbreak' and detailed that patients are receiving antimicrobial treatment.

The zoonotic disease is transmitted from animals to humans and can cause fever, chills, headaches and muscle pain, and in rare cases long-term liver and heart problems.\n\nThe Australian Services Union has hit out at the council, claiming about 50 workers had tested positive to Q fever and that workers were not being vaccinated for the disease. 'We had no idea it was this bad,' Australian Services Union Victorian Branch secretary Richard Duffy said. 'Over 80 percent of people who have been tested have tested positive, and they've tested over 60 people now.\n\n'There are a variety of symptoms, some people are off work, but they're continuing to test people. The more we look into it the worse it gets.' Mr Duffy said the union was concerned by workers' claims they had not been immunised against Q fever, despite the use of vaccines being considered best practice for those working with animals. 'It turns out that nobody has been immunised against it or vaccinated against it,' he said. 'We are seeking an urgent meeting with council to find out why.'\n\nThe bacterium that causes the Q fever can remain in the environment for a long time, is airborne and can survive disinfectants and harsh conditions. Acting city services director Peter Godfrey said the council had been testing and vaccinating staff employed at the saleyards for 'a number of years', and played down the positive tests. 'It is possible for a person to test positive to Q fever antibodies without ever having shown symptoms of the infection, and many years after exposure to the bacteria,' Mr Godfrey said. 'All City employees have been informed of the risks associated with exposure to Q fever at staff meetings and through an organisation-wide safety alert.\n\n'A safety sign at the Geelong Saleyards, installed during works prior to reopening of the site in February 2017, states that Q fever vaccination is recommended for all persons attending the site.' However the Geelong Advertiser could not find the sign when it visited the saleyards yesterday [Tue 18 Jul 2017] and was later informed that the sign, which was inside the saleyards, was not 'Q fever specific'. There is no mention of Q fever or recommended vaccinations on the council's Saleyards web page, which includes advice, frequently asked questions and an Occupational Health and Safety report. A sheep and poultry sale at the Geelong Saleyards is still scheduled to go ahead on [Mon 24 Jul 2017].\n\nA report into the local livestock industry by analyst Mercado, commissioned by CoGG this year [2017], found issues raised by stakeholders including 'concern for cross-contamination of airborne diseases'. Geelong Saleyards Users Group head Ian Kelly said the results weren't surprising, and that the workers could have been exposed to the disease previously.\n\nThe bacterium that causes the Q fever can remain in the environment for a long time, is airborne and can survive disinfectants and harsh conditions.\n\nFarmers, abattoir workers and shearers are at the highest risk of developing the disease.\n\nQ fever is caused by a microorganism that is mainly carried by goats, sheep and cattle. It can also be carried by kangaroos, wallabies, camels, rodents, cats, dogs and birds. The bacteria can survive many disinfectants and harsh conditions. It can remain in the environment for long periods of time, which means dust, hay and other small particles may carry the bacteria. It is airborne so can be contracted by breathing in dust from infected premises and properties. Contact with the urine or faeces of infected animals and/or contaminated wool or hides can also transmit the disease. The highest risk of transmission is through contact with the birth products of infected animals.\n\nFlu-like symptoms including fever, headaches, chills and muscle pains. Only 50 percent of people who contract Q fever develop symptoms. In rare cases, long-term heart and liver problems can result. Acute cases usually require antibiotics.

For a map showing the location of Geelong in relation to Melbourne, see https://www.google.com/maps/place/Geelong+Saleyards,+North+Geelong+VIC+3215,+Australia.\n\nThe Geelong Saleyards, established in 1869 by the Geelong Town Corporation, is a venue for farmers from across the region to buy and sell sheep, cattle and poultry (https://www.geelongaustralia.com.au/saleyards/default.aspx). A truck wash also operates at the Saleyards, to clean out trucks between loads, reducing the possible spread of disease.\n\nThe Saleyards was subject to a study in 2016 because of location, safety and financial concerns (http://www.geelongaustralia.com.au/common/public/documents/8d3e8703357bd3e-Geelong%20Saleyards%20Feasibility%20Study%20-%20Final%20Report%20for%20Consultation%20(3).pdf). Although once located in an outlying area without neighboring urban uses, the Saleyards are now completely surrounded by urban development and is within close proximity to the Geelong city center.\n\nSerum antibodies to _Coxiella burnetii_, the cause of Q fever, remain detectable for years, or even for life. In the U.S., 3.1 percent of the general adult U.S. population has been found to have detectable antibodies to _C. burnetii_ (https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr6203a1.htm) and the seroprevalence in Queensland, Australia has been found to be about 5 percent in rural, as well as metropolitan (Brisbane) settings (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21499708). Because of persistence of a positive serology, a confirmed diagnosis of acute Q fever requires a demonstration of a 4-fold rise in phase II IgG by indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) between serum samples from the acute and convalescent phases taken 3-6 weeks apart (https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr6203a1.htm). A single positive convalescent serum sample (IgG phase II greater than or equal to 1:128) in a patient who has been ill greater than 1 week indicates a probable acute infection. Serum PCR for Q fever is positive for _C. burnetii_ in almost all patients with early acute Q fever, i.e., during the 1st 2 weeks of symptoms, before the antibody response. Chronic Q Fever (i.e., endocarditis) is diagnosed by a phase I IgG antibody titer greater than 1:800).\n\nBecause early doxycycline treatment (within the 1st 3 days of symptoms) is most effective, treatment of a symptomatic patient suspected of having Q fever should be based on clinical findings and should not be delayed while awaiting laboratory confirmation (https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr6203a1.htm). Treatment is not indicated for people with only positive serologic titers (although it might be considered in persons at high risk for development of chronic Q fever - see https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr6203a1.htm).\n\nIn Australia, the organism is found in livestock, including goats, cattle, sheep, other farm and domestic animals, companion animals (dogs and cats) and in some wild animals (including kangaroos and bandicoots). People most at risk include workers from the meat and livestock industries and shearers, as well as the general population in close proximity to infected animals in stockyards, feedlots, processing plants or farms.\n\nIn Australia, immunization is recommended for high-risk occupational groups.

Mr Gregory said while case numbers were relatively low in the region, there had been some community concern over perceived hotspots. 'We have seen numbers group around certain areas in the Shoalhaven like Sanctuary Point, although there have been some cases in the southern Illawarra,' he said.\n\n'We have done environmental sampling at different locations -- of kangaroo and bandicoot droppings -- but no positive results have been found.' Humans usually get infected by inhaling bacteria-carrying dust contaminated by animal urine, faeces or birth products. 'Those at higher risk of infection include abattoir and meat workers; farmers and shearers; stockyard workers and animal transporters; veterinarians and agriculture college staff and students,' Mr Gregory said. 'Horticulturists or gardeners may also be concerned if there's a lot of wildlife in the area, as activities like lawn mowing may put them at risk.'\n\nSymptoms of Q fever appear 2 to 3 weeks after exposure, and include high fever, chills, sweats, headaches, muscle and joint pain, and fatigue. 'In rarer incidences the people develop more serious complications -- it can affect the heart or other organs like the liver,' Mr Gregory said.\n\nAntibiotics effectively treat the disease, however there is a vaccine available for high-risk groups. 'It's a one-off vaccine which gives life-long immunity -- however testing needs to be done first to ensure the person hasn't already been exposed,' Mr Gregory said.\n\n'I rang an ambulance because I thought I was going to die'. This patient will be giving the kangaroos at his workplace a wide berth. The 43-year-old groundskeeper from St Georges Basin contracted Q fever from infected kangaroos, after breathing in airborne particles from their droppings. After 2 misdiagnoses this year [2016], the patient's health began deteriorating. 'The local doctor originally diagnosed me with a chest infection and then it got worse so I took myself to hospital but they sent me home with crampeze [a homeopathic medication for muscle cramps],' he said. 'The doctor says it can take up to 2 years to recover and sometimes you don't properly recover at all. It got so bad after that I rang an ambulance because I thought I was going to die. I couldn't stop shivering, I had jaundice in my eyes, I was really bloated and they took me to Shoalhaven Hospital and then straight to the Wollongong Emergency Care Unit, where I stayed for 3 weeks.'\n\n[The patient's] liver had begun shutting down and he'd gone from 82 kg [about 181 lb] to 59 kg [about 130 lb]. 'My liver ate every bit of muscle off my body,' he said. 'The specialist said to me I must have some people upstairs watching over me because I shouldn't be here.' Antibiotics have cured the infection but the long-term effects are significant. 'The doctor says it can take up to 2 years to recover and sometimes you don't properly recover at all,' he said. 'I'm slowly putting weight back on but some of the side effects are I've got the same skin as a 90-year-old man, I've got no muscle tissue left on my body and I'm really weak and frail. I'm just a mere shadow of myself.'\n\n[The patient] said he wasn't aware of the dangers of Q fever or how it was contracted and urged others working near animals to get vaccinated. 'You can get vaccinated for it but I didn't know that, no-one mentioned it, and I'm sure there's a lot of other people who don't realise that too,' he said. 'If you're a groundsman or working near animals, get vaccinated. It's really important, especially if you're mowing over kangaroo droppings because that spreads the particles.'\n\n[Byline: Lisa Wachsmuth]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Q fever is caused by an obligate intracellular Gram-negative bacterium, _Coxiella burnetii_.

Q fever is mainly usually spread from animals to humans via inhalation of aerosolized particles of dried excreta and especially birthing products (such as placental material, birth fluids) of infected animals -- because the organism is reactivated in pregnant animals. Humans are very susceptible to the disease; very few organisms are required to initiate infection. Q fever can also be transmitted by ingestion of raw milk or dairy products.

Typically, human patients show signs and symptoms, such as fever, severe headache, nausea, pneumonia, or hepatitis, 2-3 weeks after injection. Chronic Q fever develops in 1 per cent to 5 per cent of patients (1).\n\nOn 5 Aug 2014, a local health department in the Federal State of the Rhineland Palatinate in southern Germany alerted the Federal State Agency for Consumer and Health Protection (FSACHP) (Landau, Germany) after detecting a cluster of 8 patients with pneumonia in a rural community during a 6-week period. The local health department and FSACHP started a joint outbreak investigation to identify cases, find the source of the outbreak, and stop disease transmission. On 12 Aug 2014, 5 of 8 patients tested by ELISA and immunofluorescence test (IFT) by the local health department had results consistent with acute _C. burnetii_ infection. The local health department issued a public health warning in the local media and advised anyone in the affected community with influenza-like symptoms or pneumonia in the past 4 months to be tested for Q fever by their general practitioner. In addition, the department offered free testing to pregnant women and persons with cardiovascular risk factors (for example, heart valve defects), irrespective of symptoms (2).\n\nCase-patients were defined as persons who had phase II IgM or IgG titers for Q fever by ELISA or IFT in 2014. Data for these case-patients were entered into the German Electronic Surveillance System for Infectious Disease Outbreaks (3). 13 residential case-patients (6 men, 7 women) who lived in the affected county (Bad Duerkheim) were identified; 11 reported symptoms compatible with Q fever, of whom 6 were hospitalized (figure [for figure, see original URL. - Mod.LL]). Median age for residential case-patients was 50 (range 32-59) years for women and 44 (range 26-56) years for men.\n\nBecause all residential case-patients lived within 1.5 km of a flock of 1000 sheep, the FSACHP tested random samples from these sheep. Of 61 sheep tested, 25 were positive for _C. burnetii_ by ELISA of serum samples and 2 by PCR of vaginal swab specimens. During the investigation, the local health department discovered that young rams and pregnant ewes in the flock had been used as donor animals for live cell therapy (LCT) at 2 medical facilities in a district 10 km from the farm. LCT is injection of fetal cells or cell extracts from sheep into humans. The flock was banned for LCT production, and veterinary control measures (e.g., indoor housing and immunization of sheep) were initiated to stop transmission.\n\nStaff members of LCT facilities were offered serologic testing by ELISA or IFT. 16 persons with occupational cases (3 men, 13 women) were reported; 10 showed onset of disease, and 2 were hospitalized (figure). Median age for occupational case-patients was 48 (range 28-62) years for women and 45 (range 35-50) years for men.\n\nLCT is an alternative treatment (without medical evidence of effectiveness) that is marketed worldwide online. It consists of intramuscular injections of cell suspensions from fetal sheep to human recipients for rejuvenation (anti-aging) and other ailments. Apart from national recipients, medical tourists from North America and Asia travel to Germany to receive injections. In August, the FSACHP was notified of a patient from Canada who received LCT injections on 28 May 2014, and became ill in June 2014, before _C. burnetii_ was detected in the asymptomatic donor sheep herd (4,5).\n\nNewspaper coverage in October 2014 of the Q fever outbreak and the potential link to the LCT recipient from Canada alerted an LCT recipient in Germany who had recovered from a previously unidentified illness after receiving LCT in Rhineland Palatinate (4,6). The patient became ill (fever, severe diarrhea, and fatigue) 1 day after receiving LCT injections on 14 Jul 2014, lost 9 kg, and was hospitalized for 10 days. She was positive for Q fever by IFT in October 2014 and had a phase II IgG titer (1:65 536) that was higher than her phase I IgG titer (1:4096), which indicated a recent infection. She had no other contact with sheep or sheep products during her stay at the LCT facility or thereafter.\n\nA pharmacovigilance report by the Paul Ehrlich Institut (Langen, Germany) indicated that LCT treatment was the probable cause of the Q fever (7). The county ordered both LCT facilities to advise all 830 LCT recipients treated since January 2014 to consult their general practitioner about their possible risk for Q fever. This advice prompted 5 US citizens who received injections on 28 May 2014 in one of the clinics to be tested for Q fever. An investigation by the US CDC (Atlanta, GA, USA) identified recent Q fever in all 5 patients (phase II IgG titers <1:65 536 at 2-6 months postinjection) (5).\n\nSeveral facilities offer LCT in Germany, although the federal ministry of health recently released an assessment stating that the use of LCT is unsafe (8). Therefore, practitioners worldwide should be informed that working at an LCT clinic or receiving LCT injections should be considered potential risk factors for Q fever.\n\nReferences\n----------\n1.

Cell therapy is promoted as an alternative form of cancer treatment.\n\n'Overview: available scientific evidence does not support claims that cell therapy is effective in treating cancer or any other disease. Serious side effects can result from cell therapy. It may in fact be lethal; several deaths have been reported. It is important to distinguish between this alternative method involving animal cells and mainstream cancer treatments that use human cells, such as bone marrow transplantation.\n\n'How is it promoted for use? In cell therapy, live or freeze-dried cells or pieces of cells from the healthy organs, fetuses, or embryos of animals such as sheep or cows are injected into patients. This is supposed to repair cellular damage and heal sick or failing organs. Cell therapy is promoted as an alternative therapy for cancer, arthritis, heart disease, Down syndrome, and Parkinson disease.\n\n'Cell therapy is also marketed to counter the effects of aging, reverse degenerative diseases, improve general health, increase vitality and stamina, and enhance sexual function. Some practitioners have proposed using cell therapy to treat AIDS patients.\n\n'The theory behind cell therapy is that the healthy animal cells injected into the body can find their way to weak or damaged organs of the same type and stimulate the body's own healing process. The choice of the type of cells to use depends on which organ is having the problem. For instance, a patient with a diseased liver may receive injections of animal liver cells. Most cell therapists today use cells taken from taken from the tissue of animal embryos.\n\n'Supporters assert that after the cells are injected into the body, they are transported directly to where they are most needed. They claim that embryonic and fetal animal tissue contains therapeutic agents that can repair damage and stimulate the immune system, thereby helping cells in the body heal.\n\n'The alternative treatment cell therapy is very different from some forms of proven therapy that use live human cells. Bone marrow transplants infuse blood stem cells -- from the patient or a carefully matched donor -- after the patient's own bone marrow cells have been destroyed. Studies have shown that bone marrow transplants are effective in helping to treat several types of cancer. In another accepted procedure, damaged knee cartilage can be repaired by taking cartilage cells from the patient's knee, carefully growing them in the laboratory, and then injecting them back into the joint. Approaches involving transplants of other types of human stem cells are being studied as a possible way to replace damaged nerve or heart muscle cells, but these approaches are still experimental.\n\n'What does it involve? 1st, healthy live cells are harvested from the organs of juvenile or adult live animals, animal embryos, or animal fetuses. These cells may be taken from the brain, pituitary gland, thyroid gland, thymus gland, liver, kidney, pancreas, spleen, heart, ovaries, testicles, or even from whole embryos. Patients might receive one or several types of animal cells. Some cell therapists inject fresh cells into their patients. Others freeze them first, which kills the cells, and they may filter out some of the cell components. Frozen cell extracts have a longer 'shelf life' and can be screened for disease. Fresh cells cannot be screened. A course of cell therapy to address a specific disease might require several injections over a short period of time, whereas cell therapy designed to treat the effects of aging and 'increase vitality' may involve injections received over many months.\n\n'Animal cell extracts are also sold in pill form as dietary supplements, usually called glandular supplements. These, too, allegedly travel to organs of the same kind in the body to promote healing.\n\n'What is the history behind it? The Swiss physician Paul Niehans, MD, invented cell therapy in 1931. During a medical emergency, Dr Niehans injected a solution containing ground-up parathyroid cells from a calf into a patient who had damaged parathyroid glands. The patient recovered, and Dr Niehans attributed the improvement to the injection. He went on to apply the idea of animal-human cellular transfer to other diseases.\n\n'Dr Niehans claimed that he treated more than 30 000 patients with cell therapy. He also claimed that the death rate from cancer among his patients who received cell therapy was 5 times less than that of the average population. He believed that injections of cells from animals resistant to cancer would increase cancer resistance in humans. A 2nd physician announced similar findings 30 years later. Neither claim has ever been supported by research studies published in medical journals.\n\n'Cell therapy may be harmful and is not legally available in the United States. Because of safety concerns and lack of proof of its effectiveness, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has banned the import of cell therapy products into the country. The treatment is provided in clinics and spas in Europe, Mexico, and the Bahamas.\n\n'What is the evidence? None of the therapeutic success claimed by cell therapists has been documented through scientific testing and published in peer-reviewed medical journals. Claims of the therapy's success take the form of individual cases, testimonials, and publicity issued by practitioners of the therapy. Even supporters of cell therapy admit they do not know how cell therapy works in the body. No reliable evidence has been published in medical journals to support the claims of cell therapy.\n\n'Are there any possible problems or complications? These substances may have not been thoroughly tested to find out how they interact with medicines, foods, or dietary supplements. Even though some reports of interactions and harmful effects may be published, full studies of interactions and effects are not often available. Because of these limitations, any information on ill effects and interactions below should be considered incomplete.\n\n'Cell therapy may be dangerous, and several patient deaths linked to the therapy have been reported in the medical literature. Patients can contract bacterial and viral infections carried by the animal cells, and some have had life-threatening and even fatal allergic reactions. Other reports list complications such as brain swelling or the immune system attacking blood vessels or nerves following cellular treatment. Serious immune system reactions resulting in death have also been reported. Women who are pregnant or breast-feeding should not use this method, as its possible effects on a fetus are unknown.'\n\nA good recent review on Q fever can be found at:\nMelgar TA, Bauler TJ, Lutwick LI.

In an observational cohort study, baseline characteristics and clinical characteristics, as well as mortality, of patients with proven, probable, or possible chronic Q fever in the Netherlands, were analyzed. In total, 284 chronic Q fever patients were identified, of which 151 (53.7 percent) had proven, 64 (22.5 percent) probable, and 69 (24.3 percent) possible, chronic Q fever. Among proven and probable chronic Q fever patients, vascular infection focus (56.7 percent) was more prevalent than endocarditis (34.9 percent). An acute Q fever episode was recalled by 27 percent of the patients. The all-cause mortality rate was 19.1 percent, while the chronic Q fever-related mortality rate was 13 percent, with mortality rates of 9.3 percent among endocarditis patients and 18 percent among patients with a vascular focus of infection. Increasing age (P equal 0.004 and 0.010), proven chronic Q fever (P equal 0.020 and 0.002), vascular chronic Q fever (P equal 0.024 and 0.005), acute presentation with chronic Q fever (P equal 0.002 and P < 0.001), and surgical treatment of chronic Q fever (P = 0.025 and P less than 0.001) were significantly associated with all-cause mortality and chronic Q fever-related mortality, respectively.'\n\nOne genotype of _Coxiella burnetti_ was predominantly present in the Dutch dairy goat population; and it was suggested that this genotype probably played a key role in the epidemic. It was found that strains with the same genotype showed differences in virulence.\n\nThe draft genome sequence of the human isolate has been published in 2015 (Ref 2).\n\nOn 21 Apr 2016, the complete genome sequence of _C.burnetii_ goat outbreak strain NL3262 and that of an epidemiologically linked chronic human strain, both having the outbreak-related CbNL01 multilocus variable-number tandem-repeat analysis (MLVA) genotype, was published (Ref 3).\n\nReferences\n----------\n1.

The statistic was revealed on last week's [week of 6 Jul 2015] episode of the ABC program Landline [http://www.abc.net.au/landline/content/2015/s4271952.htm]. Federal Health Minister Sussan Ley has promised to keep a 'watching brief' on the incidence of Q fever -- an infectious disease passed from animals to humans -- as dry conditions provide an ideal environment for the airborne organism to spread.\n\nQ fever can be passed on from almost any animal, but is mostly spread by goats, sheep, and cattle. The early symptoms resemble the flu and include high temperature, sweating, and body aches and pains. If caught early, it can be treated with antibiotics. But it has become increasingly clear that 20 to 25 per cent of cases do not fully recover, with sufferers going on to develop long-term chronic fatigue.\n\nApproximately 2 per cent of people who contract the disease end up with a life-threatening failure of their heart valves, and a small percentage die from the disease.\n\nQ fever -- the Q standing for Query -- is an international disease, identified in almost every country except New Zealand, but Australia is the only place that has an effective vaccine. Classed as a notifiable disease, just under 500 Australian cases are registered each year, almost half of them in Queensland.\n\nThe Q-vax vaccine was introduced to abattoir workers in the early 1990s and resulted in a halving of the number of Q fever cases nationally. A federally funded vaccination campaign targeting sheep, cattle, and dairy farmers was rolled out from 2001-2005, again with a dramatic drop in notifications.\n\nWith case numbers edging up slightly in the past 2 years, and a lack of awareness of the disease even in rural areas where it is most prevalent, there have been calls for another subsidised vaccination campaign. But Ms Ley said she would not agree to another vaccination campaign 'at this stage'.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Maps of Australia can be seen at http://maps.unomaha.edu/peterson/funda/MapLinks/Australia/Australia_files/image001.gif and http://healthmap.org/promed/p/47001. Guyra, a town with a population of almost 2000 people in 2011, the seat of Guyra Shire, with a population of 4397 people in 2011, is located at an elevation of 1330 m (4364 ft) above sea level on the Northern Tablelands in the New England region of New South Wales, Australia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guyra,_New_South_Wales). The New England region is about 60 km (37 mi) inland from the Pacific Coast. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people make up 10 per cent of the population of Guyra Shire.\n\n_Coxiella burnetii_, an obligate intracellular rickettsia-like bacterial pathogen causes Q fever. Q fever is primarily an occupational hazard for farmers, veterinarians, and abattoir workers in contact with infected domestic animals such as cattle, sheep, and goats, which serve as the reservoir of infection for humans. Humans usually become infected by inhaling aerosolized organisms that are shed in urine, feces, milk, and especially birthing products of infected animals; intermittent high-level shedding occurs at the time of parturition, with millions of bacteria being released per gram of placenta.\n\nQ fever spreads easily in agricultural regions via airborne particles containing the _C. burnetii_ for a considerable distances to involve people living downwind from infected livestock. Widespread transmission of Q fever was recently documented in the Netherlands downwind from the index farm from a single dairy-goat farm, even beyond a 5 km (3 mi) high-risk zone (http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/55/12/1591.long#T2). _C. burnetii_ is highly resistant to drying, heat, and many common disinfectants, which is attributed to a small cell variant of the organism that is part of a biphasic developmental cycle. These features enable the bacteria to survive for long periods in the environment.\n\nGuyra was home to a large regional abattoir that employed up to 350 staff until it closed in 1995; the abattoir building now houses an angora rabbit breeding establishment (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guyra,_New_South_Wales). The principal industries include wool, lambs, and beef cattle, which may explain why Guyra is a 'hot-spot' for Q fever.\n\nIn Australia, Q fever vaccination is recommended for those working in 'at-risk' occupations such as abattoir workers, farmers, stockyard workers, shearers, animal transporters, and others exposed to cattle, camels, sheep, goats, and kangaroos or their products (including products of conception), veterinarians, veterinary nurses, veterinary students, professional dog and cat breeders, agricultural college staff and students, wildlife and zoo workers (working with high-risk animals), and laboratory personnel handling veterinary specimens or working with the organism; workers at pig abattoirs do not require Q fever vaccination (http://www.immunise.health.gov.au/internet/immunise/publishing.nsf/Content/Handbook10-home~handbook10part4~handbook10-4-15).\n\nIf the person has a positive history of previous infection with Q fever, vaccination is contraindicated; in others, serum antibody determination and skin tests must be done before vaccination to exclude those likely to have severe local or systemic hypersensitivity reactions to the vaccine resulting from previous unrecognized exposure to the organism (http://www.immunise.health.gov.au/internet/immunise/publishing.nsf/Content/Handbook10-home~handbook10part4~handbook10-4-15). Q fever vaccine is not routinely recommended for children aged less than 15 years of age and pregnant or breastfeeding women because safety of the vaccine in these situations has not been established.

The disease is considered rare, and these would be among the 1st cases in Brazil.\n\nThe diagnosis was reported to Municipal Health of Barbosa yesterday morning [15 Mar 2015] during a visit to the municipality of the director of the Center for Strategic Information for Health Surveillance of Sao Paulo, Gizelda Katz. She was accompanied by representatives of Cerest (The Workers' Health Reference Center), the Epidemiological Surveillance group, and defense counsels Agricultural Aracatuba.\n\nThe Health Secretary of Barbosa explained that Q fever is caused by the bacterium _Coxiella burnetii_, transmitted to humans by inhalation and contact with animals. 'In view of the facts, health professionals in the city were instructed to carry out the monitoring of these patients, since these Barbosa cases are among the 1st cases of an outbreak of this bacterium in Brazil,' he says.\n\nTests found that the staff, 16 in total, had been infected with the bacterium, however, Katz said that you cannot tell when there was transmission. 'The symptoms appeared in the acute phase, and the patients were treated with antimicrobials that fortunately kill this type of bacteria. Therefore, the disease will hardly [ever] develop [to be] chronic.'\n\nTo report on such care, employees and representatives of the refrigerator group participated in a meeting at City Hall in the early afternoon yesterday [15 Mar 2015]. 'They were told about the disease, the need for personal protective equipment, which is essential in control, and questions were answered on the subject to all present.'\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-PORT\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[A previous ProMED post (Q fever - Brazil: (MG) 20130617.1777459) stated that the 1st description of Q fever in Brazilian territory was in 1953, identified by serology in Sao Paulo. Bahia, Rio de Janeiro, and Tocantins have diagnosed cases in the past.\n\nQ fever, often acquired by close exposure to animals, is infectious with a very low inoculum and may be aerosolized over a significant distance. _Coxiella burnetii_, the causative agent, was discovered in 1937. This organism is an agent that can be resistant to heat and desiccation and is highly infectious by the aerosol route. A single inhaled organism may produce clinical illness. Indeed, in [non-human] primates, the dose to kill 50 percent of primates was found to be 1.7 organisms (1).\n\nCattle, sheep, and goats are the primary reservoirs of _C. burnetii_. Infection has been noted in a wide variety of other animals, including other species of livestock and in domesticated pets. _C. burnetii_ does not usually cause clinical disease in these animals, although abortion in goats and sheep has been linked to _C. burnetii_ infection. Organisms are excreted in milk, urine, and feces of infected animals. Most importantly, during birthing, the organisms are shed in high numbers within the amniotic fluids and the placenta. Contact with contaminated wool is known to be a mode of transmission (2).\n\nThe organisms can be resistant to heat, drying, and many common disinfectants. These features enable the bacteria to survive for long periods in the environment. This very stable form of _C. burnetii_ is associated with compact small cell variants of the organism that are produced during standard replication along with the less resistant large cell form, metabolically dormant and spore-like (3).\n\nInfection of humans usually occurs by inhalation of these organisms from air that contains airborne barnyard dust contaminated by dried placental material, birth fluids, and excreta of infected herd animals. Humans are often very susceptible to the disease, and very few organisms may be required to cause infection.\n\nIngestion of contaminated milk, followed by regurgitation and inspiration of the contaminated food, is a less common mode of transmission. Other modes of transmission to humans, including tick bites and human-to-human transmission, are rare.\n\nReferences\n----------\n1.

You might remember our investigative report back in July 2015 on the disease, which is passed from animals to humans and is under-reported. Landline can now reveal at least 24 people have contracted Q fever during an ongoing outbreak on a Victorian goat dairy farm. While the farm owners and health authorities seem to have stemmed the flow of people falling ill, they have not been able to stop the spread of the disease among the animals. Prue Adams reports.\n\nPRUE ADAMS, REPORTER: There's a picture-perfect quality to this farmland near Ballarat. Lambs at foot, bluestone buildings and at this time of year, golden canola. It's a region that also boasts one of the biggest dairy goat farms in the country. The only clue to an underlying problem here are the warnings on the front gate.\n\nSANDY CAMERON, GOAT FARM OWNER: The 1st thing is we've had to restrict access to the property, signs up saying 'Don't Enter'. Of course, being in the country, people are fairly used to ignoring signs, so then we - you've actually got to try and enforce that.\n\nPRUE ADAMS: Sandy Cameron is the 3rd generation on this land. In 1992, he and his wife Julie decided to branch out into milking sheep.\n\n(Landline, 1992): The Camerons' milking flock is the United Nations of sheep. The best milkers from a range of breeds and crosses make up the group.\n\n(Present) When Landline caught up with the Camerons in 1997, they were only producing sheep milk and cheese. Later that year, they got into goats. And now, in addition to milking thousands of sheep, they also milk 5000 goats twice daily. This is a big enterprise with 3 dairies and employing 100 staff. 4 years ago, some of those employees started getting sick.\n\nSANDY CAMERON: In 2011, we had a few people get Q fever, including our daughter, but we didn't know it was Q fever. Even though they went to doctors, we didn't know what was going on. It was late 2012 before 1 of the staff had it diagnosed as Q fever. In hindsight we realized it was during 2012 was the main incidence of staff being infected.\n\nSIMON FIRESTONE, UNIVERSITY OF MELBOURNE: It was sounding very significant from the start. So historically in Victoria, the Health Department receives notifications of about 30 cases of Q fever a year, and in 1 week, they'd 5 notified associated with the 1 farm property. So, yeah, that was an outbreak. That was clearly an outbreak smacking us in the face.\n\nPRUE ADAMS: In 2013, Dr Simon Firestone, a senior veterinary lecturer at Melbourne University, was among several authorities notified.\n\nSIMON FIRESTONE: It's the largest farm-associated outbreak in Australia's history. So we've had large abattoir-associated outbreaks and a large single outbreak where there were 25 cases previously at a saleyard in South Australia in 2004. But, yeah, at 24 cases, this is the largest by far of any of the single farm-associated outbreaks and then, as with all of these, there would be cases that have gone undiagnosed.\n\nPRUE ADAMS: Q fever is a zoonotic disease, spread from animals to humans. Shearers, people who work with beef cattle and other livestock, have traditionally been seen as at risk, although it's now believed all animals can be carriers. The _Coxiella burnetii_ bacterium that causes Q fever is held in the placenta, so the greatest risk is at birthing. But the organism can also sit in the soil for years and on dry dusty days become airborne. Some people who inhale it aren't even aware they've contracted Q fever. For others, like Mick Hudson, it's serious. The sheep meat producer came down with a crippling headache and chills after rounding up wild goats in Outback New South Wales.\n\nQ FEVER PATIENT #1: Went in to the doctor and he took 1 look at me, I told him that I was sweating and he just said, 'Mate, you've got goat fever. Straight up to the hospital with you.' I would've been happy to die when I had it and I was laying in hospital, like, I was that sick, I couldn't have cared if I'd died.\n\nPRUE ADAMS: Between 15 and 20 percent of sufferers have long-term complaints, including head and muscle aches and chronic tiredness.\n\nQ FEVER PATIENT #1: But certainly the - Q fever certainly affected me. Yeah, like - and those energy levels were pretty low for a long time after I come out of hospital, you know. I was back shearing, but I was hurting, yeah. Just driving meself to work, you know? Yeah.\n\nQ FEVER PATIENT #2: How long was I sick? Um, a very long time. Because after the initial disease process, I then developed the chronic fatigue Q fever syndrome.\n\nPRUE ADAMS: Renowned horsewoman Barbara Willoughby became critically ill after delivering a stillborn calf. She's never fully recovered and after featuring in the Landline story in July, has set up a Facebook page for other Q fever victims. Along with industry body Livestock SA, some sufferers are pushing for another federally funded vaccination campaign like that rolled out in 2002.\n\nQ FEVER PATIENT #2: It's a long time since the program has stopped and there's a whole generation of children, of young people now going out into the workforce that are exposed to the virus.\n\nPRUE ADAMS: While Q fever is found across the world, Australia has the only human vaccine. It's a 2-part process that involves taking a blood sample and doing a scratch test to make sure there are no antibodies present. If those results come back negative, a week later, the vaccine can be administered. Vaccinations were rolled out on the affected Victorian goat farm from 2013, costing the business around AUD 20 000 [USD 14 518] a year.\n\nSANDY CAMERON: Anyone who even comes for a job trial, we vaccinate. All external contractors, all staff obviously, partners of staff, we offer it to neighbours. We have an HR manager. I'd say about half her time for the last couple of years would've been dominated by enforcing that, which is not easy.\n\nPRUE ADAMS: Sandy Cameron says 1 of the issues in tackling Q fever is that it's only notifiable as a human health issue. The disease in infected animals is rarely addressed. So what were the 1st signs of Q fever in the goats?\n\nSANDY CAMERON: The main sign we see is abortion, late-term abortion in the goats and now that we know what it is and we recognise that we do have substantially more abortions in goats than what we used to, so around 5-10 per cent of 1st-lactation goats abort.\n\nPRUE ADAMS: And other than abortions, are there any other telltale signs of Q fever in stock?\n\nSANDY CAMERON: Well, we suspect that they're depressed at the time, which you would imagine they would be, but goats are pretty stoic animals. They either look healthy or they're very sick, so we don't really know.\n\nPRUE ADAMS: And do you know where the initial cases of Q fever in the animals came from?\n\nSANDY CAMERON: It's certainly endemic in the district. We actually tested staff in 2009, including myself and my father. We'd had old infections, my brother had an old infection. Lots of shearers, etc. in the district have been infected over the years. So it's obviously endemic in the district and I imagine we built up quite a large pool of goats that had never seen it. It got in there, whether from kangaroos - there's lots of kangaroos here - or from the sheep and that would have exploded, hitting a big population of susceptible animals.\n\nSIMON FIRESTONE: It's fairly endemic on that farm now. We've seen rates of infection, sort of 30, 40 per cent amongst goats within - after a couple of years of life. So it's not something you're gonna get rid of very quickly.\n\nPRUE ADAMS: While the infection among the goats is ongoing, there have been no new human cases in at least a year. That's been put down to the vaccination campaign and a range of other preventative measures. Potentially contaminated bedding and birthing straw is later dug into the ground and work clothes have to be left on site. An employee's spouse was thought to have contracted Q fever from washing her husband's infected clothing. The saving grace for this farm is its isolated location, at least 10 kilometres from the closest town and it's a small town at that. We only have to look across the globe at an eerily similar dairy goat outbreak to see what can happen in more densely populated areas. In the Netherlands from 2007 until 2010, Q fever got a foothold on a series of farms.\n\nWIM VAN DER HOEK, PUBLIC HEALTH INSTITUTE, NETHERLANDS: It took the Netherlands by surprise and it was also a shock, yeah. No doubt about it.\n\nPRUE ADAMS: With as many as 50 000 people getting sick, the Dutch Government ordered the destruction of tens of thousands of pregnant goats.\n\nWIM VAN DER HOEK: So it was definitely a very difficult period, of course, for those farmers. They were compensated for the animals that were culled, but of course that could not compensate the entire losses that they faced.\n\nPRUE ADAMS: Difficult question: in the Netherlands they culled a lot of the animals. Was it ever considered that these goats should be culled?\n\nSIMON FIRESTONE: Yeah, look, it's most definitely been considered and it's been proposed by some people that have been involved with the outbreak. But it would absolutely be the last resort in this case. Yeah, we've been trying to do everything we could to avoid that as an option.\n\nSANDY CAMERON: We're grateful to especially the Victorian Health Department that they haven't taken that easy option which is available to them to demand we slaughter all our goats.\n\nPRUE ADAMS: What would that do to the business?\n\nSANDY CAMERON: Obviously I'd be looking for a job, along with everyone else.\n\nPRUE ADAMS: Dutch farmers had a tool that Australian farmers don't: access to an animal vaccine produced by the French company Ceva. It meant goats there could be immunised, which eventually stopped the Q fever spread. Why not import the French-made animal vaccine?\n\nSIMON FIRESTONE: Yeah, we tried that. That was 1 of our 1st angles of attack. Unfortunately, that importation process was rejected by Canberra. We went through the appropriate channels, but they saw a biosecurity risk with that product. So that perplexed the Europeans a little bit because they've used it with no obvious issues throughout large parts of Europe.\n\nSANDY CAMERON: Frustrated in a sense, but Australia's got a big agricultural industry. I can understand if it's not safe, then it shouldn't come in. Ceva is a multinational company. They were frustrated. They said, 'This is nonsense.'\n\nPRUE ADAMS: When doctors take blood from patients to check for Q fever, most of those samples end up here at the Rickettsial Reference Laboratory in Geelong. This small unit tests at least 20 suspected cases a day. Headed up by Dr John Stenos, the laboratory is in the process of making a vaccine that can be used to inoculate the local infected goat herd.\n\nJOHN STENOS, AUST. RICKETTSIAL REFERENCE LAB.: The way the vaccine's produced is we've gone out onto the farm and got contaminated material which we've then been able to isolate the _Coxiella burnetii_ from. Now this is then amplified in these eggs and then returned to the same farm for the immunisation process or the vaccination process. Now, to broaden that just requires the regulator to agree to its use.\n\nPRUE ADAMS: Trials start in the Camerons' kids in the next few weeks, but there are substantial regulatory hurdles to jump before the vaccine will be available for widespread use on the farm, let alone further afield. And, amazingly, Sandy Cameron is funding, to the tune of around AUD 1 million [USD 725 900], the development and eventual production of the animal vaccine.\n\nSANDY CAMERON: We've travelled a bit with the business and I can't think of another country in the world where it would be left to an individual farm to develop a vaccine aimed at protecting a human population.\n\nPRUE ADAMS: So have you not had any help from, say, the Federal Government authorities in terms ... ?\n\nSANDY CAMERON: No.\n\nPRUE ADAMS: No, none at all ...\n\nSANDY CAMERON: None at all.\n\nPRUE ADAMS: ... in terms of getting that vaccine across the line?\n\nSANDY CAMERON: No.\n\nPRUE ADAMS: So they've basically said to you, 'No, you can't bring it in from Europe, but you're on your own'?\n\nSANDY CAMERON: That's right, yes.\n\nPRUE ADAMS: We've opted not to name the dairy in question out of concern for their business. They produce around 13 000 litres of sheep and goat milk a day and make yoghurt and cheese. Their milk is pasteurised and authorities insist you can't catch Q fever from pasteurised products. I've checked with the Dutch authorities too, and despite them enduring the world's worst outbreak of Q fever, no one contracted the disease from properly treated milk or cheese. Still, Sandy and Julie Cameron are understandably concerned about speaking out.\n\nSANDY CAMERON: I'm a big believer in openness. I'm a vet, and as I say, a bit of a scientist. I think the more people know about things, the better. But there's always that just little nagging thing that we borrowed a lot of money to get this business on the ground and I'd hate some sort of fear campaign based not on fact to damage our market. So, yes, there's always nervousness.\n\nPRUE ADAMS: Dr Simon Firestone is nervous too because he sees the Victorian outbreak as a warning sign.\n\nSIMON FIRESTONE: The farm at the centre of this outbreak really follows a European style of farming, so very intense animal densities, very high output and very high inputs, but - which is not typical of this sort of Australian pasture-based extensive farming system. But there is a very strong drive towards more farming ventures that follow that style of farming and some of that drive is coming from the international market in goat dairy products and we're seeing new ventures that are popping up. As the industry emerges, so do the risks and we need to keep up with that.\n\nSANDY CAMERON: The warning's there. If there is a big problem with Q fever, now no one can say they didn't know about it - partly from our experience, your recent reports on it, etc. The awareness is there, but there's no action.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[_Coxiella burnetii_, the causative agent, was discovered in 1937.

Organisms are excreted in milk, urine, and feces of infected animals. Most importantly, during birthing the organisms are shed in high numbers within the amniotic fluids and the placenta. Contact with contaminated wool is known to be a mode of transmission (2).\n\nThe organisms can be resistant to heat, drying, and many common disinfectants. These features enable the bacteria to survive for long periods in the environment. This very stable form of _C. burnetii_ is associated with compact small-cell variants of the organism that are produced during standard replication along with the less resistant large-cell form, metabolically dormant, and spore-like (3).\n\nInfection of humans usually occurs by inhalation of these organisms from air that contains airborne barnyard dust contaminated by dried placental material, birth fluids, and excreta of infected herd animals. Humans are often very susceptible to the disease, and very few organisms may be required to cause infection.\n\nIngestion of contaminated milk, followed by regurgitation and inspiration of the contaminated food, is a less common mode of transmission. Other modes of transmission to humans, including tick bites and human-to-human transmission, are rare.\n\nReferences\n------\n1.

These 13 alpacas from Chile were diagnosed with Q fever after taking blood in a routine examination during isolation.\n\nThere have been some reports about a booming business of alpaca purchased overseas. The CIQ has stressed that all imported alpacas should be isolated for 30 to 45 days and quarantined at the port-of-entry.\n\nAccording to medical information, Q fever is a disease caused by infection with _Coxiella burnetii_, a bacterium that infects humans and other animals. Zhang Shaoping, an official at CIQ, said humans as well as cattle, sheep, goats and other domestic mammals, including cats and dogs, are generally susceptible to Q fever.

The woman had received intramuscular injections in May 2014 containing material from sheep fetuses and sheep placenta (so-called 'fresh cells'). The woman became ill nine days later with fever, buttock pain, increased liver enzyme values and pleural effusion. In Jul 2014 the diagnosis Q fever was confirmed. The treatment in the form of so-called fresh cell injections took place in a treatment facility in the Federal state of Rhineland-Palatinate (RP). More information on the case from Canada is still pending.\n\nBy investigations of responsible public health authorities in the aforementioned Federal state at the beginning of August 2014, a Q fever outbreak was discovered. 12 cases (5 male, 7 female, median age 49 years [range: 28-59]) from RP with a laboratory diagnosis were announced, with 10 of the 12 people ill, and 6 hospitalized. A further epidemiologically linked case from the Munich urban area was announced.\n\nAll laboratory-confirmed cases lived or worked in close proximity to sheep enterprises.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nSabine Zentis\nCastleview English Longhorns\nGut Laach\nD-52385 Nideggen\nGermany\nhttp://www.cvlonghorns.de\n\n[It appears that the Canadian woman was infected from cells from sheep fetuses in the midst of an outbreak of German cases linked geographically to infected ovine farms, an unusual form of transmission.\n\n_Coxiella burnetii_, an obligate intracellular rickettsia-like bacterial pathogen, causes Q fever. _C. burnetii_ is highly resistant to drying and heat, which is attributed to a small cell variant of the organism that is part of a biphasic developmental cycle. Domestic ungulates such as sheep, cattle, and goats serve as the reservoir of infection for humans.\n\nHumans usually become infected by inhaling aerosolized organisms that are shed in urine, feces, milk, and especially birthing products of infected animals; intermittent high-level shedding occurs at the time of parturition, with millions of bacteria being released per gram of placenta. Acute symptoms of a flu-like illness with hepatitis or pneumonia usually develop within 2-3 weeks after exposure, although as many as half of humans infected with _C. burnetii_ do not show symptoms (http://www.cdc.gov/qfever/symptoms/index.html). Although most persons with acute Q fever recover, others may experience serious chronic illness within a few months or several years after acute infection, with complications that include endocarditis (especially in patients with previous cardiac valvulopathy), infected aneurysms or vascular prostheses, and chronic hepatitis.\n\nUsually, Q fever is primarily an occupational hazard for farmers, veterinarians, and abattoir workers in contact with infected domestic animals such as cattle, sheep, and goats and for laboratory personnel performing _C. burnetii_ cultures and working with _C. burnetii_-infected animals (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC88923/). Sporadic cases can also occur in people living in urban areas that are downstream from farms or abattoirs where the organisms have become aerosolized. Other modes of transmission to humans, including tick bites and ingestion of unpasteurized milk or dairy products (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr6203a1.htm). Q fever has rarely followed blood transfusion, bone marrow transplantation, and suspected sexual transmission via infected sperm (http://www.gezondheidsraad.nl/sites/default/files/201115EQfever.pdf).\n\nQ fever spreads easily in agricultural regions via airborne particles containing the _C. burnetii_ for a considerable distances to involve people living downwind from infected livestock. Widespread transmission of Q fever was recently documented in the Netherlands downwind from the index farm from a single dairy-goat farm, even beyond a 5 km [3 mile] high-risk zone (http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/55/12/1591.long#T2).\n\nThe acute and chronic stages of infection correspond to 2 distinct antigenic phases of antibody response. During an acute infection, an antibody response to _C. burnetii_ phase II antigen is predominant and is higher than the response to the phase I antigen, whereas chronic infection is associated with a rising phase I immunoglobulin G (IgG) titer.\n\nCDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) has recently issued recommendations for the recognition, clinical and laboratory diagnosis, treatment, and management of Q fever (CDC. Diagnosis and Management of Q Fever -- United States, 2013: Recommendations from CDC and the Q Fever Working Group. Morb Mortal Wkly Rep (MMWR). Recommendations and Reports. 29 Mar 2013/62(RR03); 1-23. Available at http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr6203a1.htm).\n\nCell therapy (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_therapy), also called cellular therapy or cytotherapy, is therapy in which cellular material is injected into a patient; this generally means intact, living cells. For example, T cells capable of fighting cancer cells via cell-mediated immunity may be injected in the course of immunotherapy.\n\nCell therapy originated in the 19th century when scientists experimented by injecting animal material in an attempt to prevent and treat illness; such attempts produced no positive benefit. In some forms of alternative medicine, the practice of injecting animal materials in an attempt to cure disease is perpetuated. The practice, according to the American Cancer Society, is not backed by any medical evidence of effectiveness, and can have deadly consequences. - Mod.LL]\n\n[ProMED reported a similar case in a Canadian injected with sheep cells in Germany in 1997 -- see: Q fever, suspected - Canada ex Germany: RFI Archive No. 19971210.2462. - Mod.JW]\n\n[Q fever, a zoonotic bacterial disease, is endemic in Germany where it is included in the lists of notifiable human and animal diseases. The common transmission route is inhalation of infected aerosolized particles carried over distances of up to 2-5 km (1.2-3.1 mi) or by direct contact with birth products of infected ruminants (cattle, sheep, goats).\n\nReportedly, between 80 and 400 human cases per year are reported in Germany, with 40-80 percent of these related to outbreaks (clusters of human cases). The incidence of human disease is usually lower in winter, half the number of human cases found in summer (ref 1). However, a recent outbreak started during the winter, namely in January 2014, continuing to mid April 2014. This outbreak, in the community of Sulzfeld, Bavaria (south Germany) was reported and described in posting 20140511.2464862, citing a media report of 9 May 2014. A later report of 16 May 2014 indicated that 14 people had been infected in Sulzfeld since January 2014, 6 of which had to be hospitalised, 24 others suspected. As source of infection, the public health authorities mentioned a sheep and a goat (see, in German, at http://www.br.de/nachrichten/unterfranken/q-fieber-welle-sulzfeld-100.html).\n\nAccording to the 2013 annual report of Germany's RKI (Robert Koch Institut), the number of human cases officially reported during 2013 was 115, 58 percent lower than in 2012 and the lowest number since 2007. A graph showing weekly figures for the years 2008-2013 is available in fig 6.41.1 (page 168) of the report (ref 2). According to OIE's most recent available data from Germany (January-June 2013), during these 6 months, 106 Q-fever outbreaks were reported in animals, of which 102 in cattle, 3 in sheep, and 1 in a goat. The data for (entire) previous years are: 2009: 106, 2010: 121, 2011: 171, 2012: 246 outbreaks. This may be indicative of a continuous increased incidence. Information on the number of outbreaks in animals during the 2nd semester of 2013, and about their respective species, will be appreciated.\n\nThe animal population of Germany (2013 figures) is: cattle 12.7 million, sheep 1.57 million, goat 150 000. According to OIE data, no vaccination of animals against Q fever is applied in Germany.\n\nReferences\n----------\n1.

The Canadian health authorities are convinced that a woman from Canada became infected when having fresh cell therapy in the Vorderpfalz region. No similar case has ever been scientifically proven so this might well add new fuel to the long lasting, bitter discussion about fresh cell therapy.\n\nIn September 2014, Canadian health authorities notified the RKI (Robert-Koch-Institut) of a case of Q fever in Canada. They assume that the patient became infected by an injection of sheep fetal cells and sheep placenta (so called 'fresh-cells') and could not find other ways of infection. The treatment took place in May 2014 in the Suedliche Weinstrasse district [Rhineland-Palatinate]. After her return to Canada nine days later, the woman fell sick and had fever. In July 2014, after extensive laboratory tests, the Canadians confirmed Q fever infection, which must have been acquired in Germany.\n\nThe RKI confirmed the information from Canada. According to an RKI spokesperson 'the method of infection is conceivable.' The RKI is under the jurisdiction of the Federal Ministry of Health and is, among other things, responsible for handling human disease outbreaks.\n\nQ-fever is a disease of livestock which can be transmitted to humans by various routes.\n\nIn July 2014, when the diagnosis in Canada was made, no one in Germany was aware that there was an outbreak of Q fever in Lachen-Speyerdorf. During August 2014, some human cases of severe pneumonia were detected and later the competent health authorities found 3 flocks of sheep in the district infected with Q fever.\n\nAccording to the health authorities one of these sheep farms provides the animals for fresh cell therapies. Obviously, the controls which are the responsibility of the fresh cell therapist and which are in place to prevent the transmission of dangerous diseases, had failed. 'Testing of random samples from the flocks in question during April, May, and June [2014] gave no indication of Q fever infection,' the spokesperson for the district administration said.\n\nFresh cell therapy is a highly controversial treatment in alternative medicine. Patients are injected with cells, usually derived from fetal lambs or calves. The advocates of fresh cell therapy promise a cure for all kinds of chronic diseases, cancer, and conditions of old age.\n\nOrthodox medical practitioners are highly critical saying that there is no proof of their effectiveness but a high risk of allergic reactions as well as transmission of diseases. According to experts the administration of fresh cells in Germany is in decline. According to the competent authorities there are only 2 providers of fresh cell therapy in Rhineland-Palatinate -- a specialized clinic and a practitioner in the region of Suedliche Weinstrasse.\n\nIn the late 1990s the then Minister of Health Seehofer tried to implement legislation to ban the production and sale of fresh cells in Germany. His legislation fell through when put before the Federal Constitutional Court because of a technicality, as the cells are prepared by clinics and injected straight after production and are not 'put into circulation' so the Federal authorities had no responsibility.\n\nSince then the authorities seem to have a problem with fresh cells: In a statement the RKI said the controls are the responsibility of the local authorities. Dieter Starke, spokesperson for the LSjV (Rhineland-Palatinate Health authorities) and responsible for surveillance of drugs/medicines, said that a list of criteria for the safety of fresh cell products is being worked on. The common goal is to raise the safety standards to the levels of medical products.\n\nThe LSjV ordered the suspension of the production of fresh cells in Lachen-Speyerdorf. One of the therapists affected is the medical doctor Robert Janson-Mueller who has his practice in Edenkoben. He says there is the 'theoretical possibility that the patient from Canada acquired the infection in his practice but it is not proven.' Incidentally, an additional case of human Q fever infection was notified in Munich which, according to experts, is connected to the outbreak in Lachen-Speyerdorf. According to reports, a medical doctor who produces fresh cells became infected with Q fever.\n\n[Byline: Arno Becker]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nSabine Zentis\nCastleview English Longhorns\nGut Laach\nD-52385 Nideggen\nGermany\nhttp://www.cvlonghorns.de\n\n[ProMED thanks Sabine Zentis for submitting and translating this report.\n\nThe Canadian case appears to be the 'bellwether' to the discovery of _Coxiella burnetii_ in a flock of sheep used for the 'therapy' and the report of Q fever in a doctor preparing the cells. The circumstantial evidence for this route of infection seems quite strong.\n\nThe following is a warning regarding this non-traditional therapy from the American Cancer Society (http://www.cancer.org/treatment/treatmentsandsideeffects/complementaryandalternativemedicine/pharmacologicalandbiologicaltreatment/cell-therapy):\n\n'Cell therapy\nOther common name(s): cellular therapy, fresh cell therapy, live cell therapy, glandular therapy, xenotransplant therapy\n\nDescription: in cell therapy, processed tissue from the organs, embryos, or fetuses of animals such as sheep or cows is injected into patients. Cell therapy is promoted as an alternative form of cancer treatment.\n\nOverview: available scientific evidence does not support claims that cell therapy is effective in treating cancer or any other disease. Serious side effects can result from cell therapy. It may in fact be lethal -- several deaths have been reported. It is important to distinguish between this alternative method involving animal cells and mainstream cancer treatments that use human cells, such as bone marrow transplantation.\n\nHow is it promoted for use? In cell therapy, live or freeze-dried cells or pieces of cells from the healthy organs, fetuses, or embryos of animals such as sheep or cows are injected into patients. This is supposed to repair cellular damage and heal sick or failing organs. Cell therapy is promoted as an alternative therapy for cancer, arthritis, heart disease, Down syndrome, and Parkinson disease.\n\nCell therapy is also marketed to counter the effects of aging, reverse degenerative diseases, improve general health, increase vitality and stamina, and enhance sexual function. Some practitioners have proposed using cell therapy to treat AIDS patients.\n\nThe theory behind cell therapy is that the healthy animal cells injected into the body can find their way to weak or damaged organs of the same type and stimulate the body's own healing process. The choice of the type of cells to use depends on which organ is having the problem. For instance, a patient with a diseased liver may receive injections of animal liver cells. Most cell therapists today use cells taken from taken from the tissue of animal embryos.\n\nSupporters assert that after the cells are injected into the body, they are transported directly to where they are most needed. They claim that embryonic and fetal animal tissue contains therapeutic agents that can repair damage and stimulate the immune system, thereby helping cells in the body heal.\n\nThe alternative treatment cell therapy is very different from some forms of proven therapy that use live human cells. Bone marrow transplants infuse blood stem cells -- from the patient or a carefully matched donor -- after the patient's own bone marrow cells have been destroyed. Studies have shown that bone marrow transplants are effective in helping to treat several types of cancer. In another accepted procedure, damaged knee cartilage can be repaired by taking cartilage cells from the patient's knee, carefully growing them in the laboratory, and then injecting them back into the joint. Approaches involving transplants of other types of human stem cells are being studied as a possible way to replace damaged nerve or heart muscle cells, but these approaches are still experimental.\n\nWhat does it involve? First, healthy live cells are harvested from the organs of juvenile or adult live animals, animal embryos, or animal fetuses. These cells may be taken from the brain, pituitary gland, thyroid gland, thymus gland, liver, kidney, pancreas, spleen, heart, ovaries, testicles, or even from whole embryos. Patients might receive one or several types of animal cells. Some cell therapists inject fresh cells into their patients. Others freeze them first, which kills the cells, and they may filter out some of the cell components. Frozen cell extracts have a longer 'shelf life' and can be screened for disease. Fresh cells cannot be screened. A course of cell therapy to address a specific disease might require several injections over a short period of time, whereas cell therapy designed to treat the effects of aging and 'increase vitality' may involve injections received over many months.\n\nAnimal cell extracts are also sold in pill form as dietary supplements, usually called glandular supplements. These, too, allegedly travel to organs of the same kind in the body to promote healing.\n\nWhat is the history behind it? The Swiss physician Paul Niehans, MD, invented cell therapy in 1931. During a medical emergency, Dr Niehans injected a solution containing ground-up parathyroid cells from a calf into a patient who had damaged parathyroid glands. The patient recovered, and Dr Niehans attributed the improvement to the injection. He went on to apply the idea of animal-human cellular transfer to other diseases.\n\nDr Niehans claimed that he treated more than 30 000 patients with cell therapy. He also claimed that the death rate from cancer among his patients who received cell therapy was 5 times less than that of the average population. He believed that injections of cells from animals resistant to cancer would increase cancer resistance in humans. A 2nd physician announced similar findings 30 years later. Neither claim has ever been supported by research studies published in medical journals.\n\nCell therapy may be harmful and is not legally available in the United States. Because of safety concerns and lack of proof of its effectiveness, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has banned the import of cell therapy products into the country. The treatment is provided in clinics and spas in Europe, Mexico, and the Bahamas.\n\nWhat is the evidence? None of the therapeutic success claimed by cell therapists has been documented through scientific testing and published in peer-reviewed medical journals. Claims of the therapy's success take the form of individual cases, testimonials, and publicity issued by practitioners of the therapy. Even supporters of cell therapy admit they do not know how cell therapy works in the body. No reliable evidence has been published in medical journals to support the claims of cell therapy.\n\nAre there any possible problems or complications? These substances may have not been thoroughly tested to find out how they interact with medicines, foods, or dietary supplements. Even though some reports of interactions and harmful effects may be published, full studies of interactions and effects are not often available. Because of these limitations, any information on ill effects and interactions below should be considered incomplete.\n\nCell therapy may be dangerous, and several patient deaths linked to the therapy have been reported in the medical literature. Patients can contract bacterial and viral infections carried by the animal cells, and some have had life-threatening and even fatal allergic reactions. Other reports list complications such as brain swelling or the immune system attacking blood vessels or nerves following cellular treatment. Serious immune system reactions resulting in death have also been reported. Women who are pregnant or breast-feeding should not use this method, as its possible effects on a fetus are unknown.' - Mod.LL\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/41934.]", "summary": "Other common name(s): cellular therapy, fresh cell therapy, live cell therapy, glandular therapy, xenotransplant therapy\n\nDescription: in cell therapy, processed tissue from the organs, embryos, or fetuses of animals such as sheep or cows is injected into patients. \n\nThe alternative treatment cell therapy is very different from some forms of proven therapy that use live human cells. \n\nThe following is a warning regarding this non-traditional therapy from the American Cancer Society (http://www.cancer.org/treatment/treatmentsandsideeffects/complementaryandalternativemedicine/pharmacologicalandbiologicaltreatment/cell-therapy):\n\n'Cell therapy\n \n\nThe theory behind cell therapy is that the healthy animal cells injected into the body can find their way to weak or damaged organs of the same type and stimulate the body's own healing process.

All 5 patients had symptoms compatible with Q fever (such as fever, fatigue, chills, and headache) and a history of travel to Germany to receive a medical treatment called 'live cell therapy' (sometimes called 'fresh cell therapy') in May 2014. Live cell therapy is the practice of injecting processed cells from organs or fetuses of nonhuman animals (for example, sheep) into human recipients (1). It is advertised to treat a variety of health conditions. This practice is unavailable in the USA, however, people can travel to foreign locations to receive injections.\n\nLocal health departments interviewed the patients, and NYSDOH notified the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and posted a report on CDC's Epidemic Information Exchange to solicit additional cases. Clinical and exposure information for each patient was reported to the Robert Koch Institute in Germany, which forwarded the information to local health authorities. A Canada resident who also received live cell therapy in May 2014 was diagnosed with Q fever in July 2014. Clinicians should be aware of health risks, such as Q fever and other zoonotic diseases, among patients with a history of receiving treatment with live cell therapy products.\n\nThe 5 New York patients had traveled in a group of 10-15 people to the state of Rhineland-Palatinate in Germany to receive intramuscular injections of fetal sheep cells from a German physician on 30 May 2014. A Canada resident, who received intramuscular injections of fetal sheep cells from the same German physician on 28 May 2014, sought medical care in June 2014 for fever, pain, and erythema at the site of the injection. She received a diagnosis of Q fever in July 2014, and public health authorities were notified. Under International Health Regulations, the Public Health Agency of Canada notified German authorities in September 2014. At the time of notification, the ministry of health of the federal state of Rhineland-Palatinate was investigating an outbreak of human Q fever associated with inhalation exposure to a sheep flock that was used for production of fetal sheep cell injections by the German physician.\n\nIn September 2014, the German physician notified patients treated during January-July 2014 of their potential Q fever exposure. This prompted Q fever testing of the 5 patients in New York, 3 of whom had already sought medical care for symptoms. The other 2 patients had experienced symptoms but had not sought medical care until notification of their potential Q fever exposure. The test results, with positive Q fever titers, were reported to NYSDOH and prompted investigation by local health departments. No additional USA or Canada residents with positive Q fever titers and history of intramuscular injections of fetal sheep cells in Germany have been identified. The identities and nationalities of the other people in the travel group are unknown to USA and Canadian public health authorities. It is not known whether the other people did not get tested for Q fever, tested negative, or did not report an exposure to fetal sheep cell injections.\n\nAn outbreak-associated case of Q fever was defined as an illness consisting of clinical signs and symptoms compatible with Q fever, and a single IgG titer equal to or greater than 1:128 to _C. burnetii_ phase II antigen by immunofluorescence assay in a person who received live cell therapy in Germany during May 2014 (2). Among the 6 identified cases, the median patient age was 62 years (range = 59-83 years). 4 of the 6 patients were female. None of the patients reported other potential exposures to Q fever, with the exception of 1 patient who reported contact with sheep horn or bone. 3 patients reported preexisting medical conditions: one patient with atrial fibrillation and kidney stones, one patient with Parkinson disease and osteoarthritis, and one patient with multiple sclerosis.\n\nSigns and symptoms of Q fever began within about 1 week of receipt of the intramuscular injections of fetal sheep cells. The majority of symptoms were reported as lasting 10-90 days; however, 9-10 months after exposure, 3 patients continued to report symptoms of fatigue, chills, sweats, and difficulty sleeping (Table 1 [for table, see source URL - Mod.LL]). One patient had initially reported no symptoms during an interview with the local health department after his positive titers were reported in November 2014; however, in February 2015, he informed his physician that symptoms had been occurring since the injections in May 2014.\n\nThe patients were tested for Q fever phase I and phase II antibodies at 2-6 months after exposure, using indirect immunofluorescence assay. _C. burnetii_ undergoes antigenic phase variation, between a virulent phase I form and an avirulent phase II form. During acute infection, phase II antibodies appear 1st and are higher than phase I antibodies. All patients' phase I IgG titers were elevated (1:512-1:2048), but were lower than phase II IgG titers (1:4096-1:65 536), suggesting acute disease. Phase I IgM titers were elevated in 4 patients (1:128-1:8192) and phase II IgM titers were elevated in all patients (1:64-1:32 768). All patients were treated with doxycycline after receiving a diagnosis of Q fever.\n\nAll 6 patients were initially interviewed by their local health departments; only 2 of the 5 New York patients agreed to a follow-up interview by NYSDOH. The 2 patients reported that a group had traveled to Germany for injections twice each year for the past 5 years. They chose to receive injections of fetal sheep cells to improve their general health and vitality, and had not previously experienced signs or symptoms of illness after injections. They reported that they were not informed of a risk for Q fever infection before injection.\n\nDiscussion\n----------\nThe treatment known as live cell therapy was developed in Switzerland during the 1930s by Paul Niehans. Practitioners have used organs, glands, and fetuses of multiple species, including sheep, cows, and sharks (1). No published clinical evidence supporting therapeutic claims of the treatment known as live cell therapy is available. It is advertised as having anti-aging effects and as a treatment for multiple conditions and diseases (for example, erectile dysfunction, depression, and joint, neurologic, heart, kidney, lung, endocrine, and liver disease). Serious adverse events have been reported, including anaphylaxis, vasculitis, encephalitis, polyradiculitis, clostridial infections, paresis, and death (3-5).\n\nThe treatment known as live cell therapy is a type of xenotransplantation when it involves administration of live cells from a nonhuman animal source into a human recipient (6). Xenotransplantation carries a public health risk for transmission of known and unknown infectious agents from the donor organism to the human recipient and possible recombination or reassortment to form new pathogens (6). There is a theoretic potential for dissemination of disease from the original recipient to others. For this reason, discussions on safety requirements for xenotransplantation by international and domestic public health agencies continue to occur (7).\n\nRegulation of xenotransplantation varies among countries. In the USA, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates xenotransplantation products as Biologic Drugs under section 351 of the Public Health Service Act and the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. FDA approval of a Biologics License Application (BLA) is required to introduce, or deliver for introduction, a biologic product into interstate commerce. FDA has not approved a BLA for a xenotransplantation product known as live cell therapy. If a xenotransplantation product is proposed for use in a clinical investigation in the USA, an Investigational New Drug Application would be required. In Canada, xenotransplantation cell therapy products are regulated as drugs under the Food and Drugs Act and the Food and Drug Regulations. Authorities in Canada have not authorized for sale any xenotransplantation products, nor have any clinical trials that involve xenotransplantation been authorized. In Germany, xenotransplantation products are regulated under the Medicinal Products Act; however, an attempt to ban fresh cell therapy in 1997 was later determined to be null and void because the federal law does not cover drugs manufactured by doctors only for use in their own patients (8). According to an assessment supported by WHO and its partners, during January 1994-September 2009, xenotransplantation procedures were identified in 12 different countries, of which 9 had no clear national regulations on xenotransplantation (9).\n\nThis outbreak highlights one of the public health issues associated with xenotourism, the travel outside a country of residence for the purpose of participating in xenotransplantation programs. FDA recommends that xenotransplantation product recipients enrolled in research studies remain under lifelong surveillance with periodic clinical and laboratory monitoring and that both they and their intimate contacts refrain from blood and tissue donation (6). However, other than self-reporting, no method to identify returned xenotourists is available. Clinicians should be aware of xenotourism and consider the potential for zoonotic disease in a patient with a history of xenotransplantation.\n\nReferences\n----------\n1.

Most cell therapists today use cells taken from taken from the tissue of animal embryos.\n\n'Supporters assert that after the cells are injected into the body, they are transported directly to where they are most needed. They claim that embryonic and fetal animal tissue contains therapeutic agents that can repair damage and stimulate the immune system, thereby helping cells in the body heal.\n\n'The alternative treatment cell therapy is very different from some forms of proven therapy that use live human cells. Bone marrow transplants infuse blood stem cells -- from the patient or a carefully matched donor -- after the patient's own bone marrow cells have been destroyed. Studies have shown that bone marrow transplants are effective in helping to treat several types of cancer. In another accepted procedure, damaged knee cartilage can be repaired by taking cartilage cells from the patient's knee, carefully growing them in the laboratory, and then injecting them back into the joint. Approaches involving transplants of other types of human stem cells are being studied as a possible way to replace damaged nerve or heart muscle cells, but these approaches are still experimental.\n\n'What does it involve? First, healthy live cells are harvested from the organs of juvenile or adult live animals, animal embryos, or animal fetuses. These cells may be taken from the brain, pituitary gland, thyroid gland, thymus gland, liver, kidney, pancreas, spleen, heart, ovaries, testicles, or even from whole embryos. Patients might receive one or several types of animal cells. Some cell therapists inject fresh cells into their patients. Others freeze them first, which kills the cells, and they may filter out some of the cell components. Frozen cell extracts have a longer 'shelf life' and can be screened for disease. Fresh cells cannot be screened. A course of cell therapy to address a specific disease might require several injections over a short period of time, whereas cell therapy designed to treat the effects of aging and 'increase vitality' may involve injections received over many months.\n\n'Animal cell extracts are also sold in pill form as dietary supplements, usually called glandular supplements. These, too, allegedly travel to organs of the same kind in the body to promote healing.\n\n'What is the history behind it? The Swiss physician Paul Niehans, MD, invented cell therapy in 1931. During a medical emergency, Dr Niehans injected a solution containing ground-up parathyroid cells from a calf into a patient who had damaged parathyroid glands. The patient recovered, and Dr Niehans attributed the improvement to the injection. He went on to apply the idea of animal-human cellular transfer to other diseases.\n\n'Dr Niehans claimed that he treated more than 30 000 patients with cell therapy. He also claimed that the death rate from cancer among his patients who received cell therapy was 5 times less than that of the average population. He believed that injections of cells from animals resistant to cancer would increase cancer resistance in humans. A 2nd physician announced similar findings 30 years later. Neither claim has ever been supported by research studies published in medical journals.\n\n'Cell therapy may be harmful and is not legally available in the United States. Because of safety concerns and lack of proof of its effectiveness, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has banned the import of cell therapy products into the country. The treatment is provided in clinics and spas in Europe, Mexico, and the Bahamas.\n\n'What is the evidence? None of the therapeutic success claimed by cell therapists has been documented through scientific testing and published in peer-reviewed medical journals. Claims of the therapy's success take the form of individual cases, testimonials, and publicity issued by practitioners of the therapy. Even supporters of cell therapy admit they do not know how cell therapy works in the body. No reliable evidence has been published in medical journals to support the claims of cell therapy.\n\n'Are there any possible problems or complications? These substances may have not been thoroughly tested to find out how they interact with medicines, foods, or dietary supplements. Even though some reports of interactions and harmful effects may be published, full studies of interactions and effects are not often available. Because of these limitations, any information on ill effects and interactions below should be considered incomplete.\n\n'Cell therapy may be dangerous, and several patient deaths linked to the therapy have been reported in the medical literature. Patients can contract bacterial and viral infections carried by the animal cells, and some have had life-threatening and even fatal allergic reactions. Other reports list complications such as brain swelling or the immune system attacking blood vessels or nerves following cellular treatment. Serious immune system reactions resulting in death have also been reported. Women who are pregnant or breast-feeding should not use this method, as its possible effects on a fetus are unknown.' - Mod.LL\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/9631.]", "summary": "Other common name(s): cellular therapy, fresh cell therapy, live cell therapy, glandular therapy, xenotransplant therapy\n\n'Description: in cell therapy, processed tissue from the organs, embryos, or fetuses of animals such as sheep or cows is injected into patients.

Live cell therapy is the practice of injecting processed cells from organs or fetuses of nonhuman animals (for example, sheep) into human recipients (1). http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6438a3.htm?s_cid=mm6438a3_w\n\n\nQ fever outbreak among travelers to Germany who received live cell therapy -- United States and Canada, 2014\n Even supporters of cell therapy admit they do not know how cell therapy works in the body. \n\nThe 5 New York patients had traveled in a group of 10-15 people to the state of Rhineland-Palatinate in Germany to receive intramuscular injections of fetal sheep cells from a German physician on 30 May 2014. Cell therapy is promoted as an alternative therapy for cancer, arthritis, heart disease, Down syndrome, and Parkinson disease. In Germany, xenotransplantation products are regulated under the Medicinal Products Act; however, an attempt to ban fresh cell therapy in 1997 was later determined to be null and void because the federal law does not cover drugs manufactured by doctors only for use in their own patients (8). At the time of notification, the ministry of health of the federal state of Rhineland-Palatinate was investigating an outbreak of human Q fever associated with inhalation exposure to a sheep flock that was used for production of fetal sheep cell injections by the German physician. \n\n'Cell therapy is also marketed to counter the effects of aging, reverse degenerative diseases, improve general health, increase vitality and stamina, and enhance sexual function. promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The Canadian case appeared to be the 'bellwether' to the discovery of _Coxiella burnetii_ in a flock of sheep used for the 'therapy' and the report of Q fever in a doctor preparing the cells.

He also claimed that the death rate from cancer among his patients who received cell therapy was 5 times less than that of the average population. No published clinical evidence supporting therapeutic claims of the treatment known as live cell therapy is available. \n\nAll 6 patients were initially interviewed by their local health departments; only 2 of the 5 New York patients agreed to a follow-up interview by NYSDOH. Bone marrow transplants infuse blood stem cells -- from the patient or a carefully matched donor -- after the patient's own bone marrow cells have been destroyed. FDA has not approved a BLA for a xenotransplantation product known as live cell therapy. It is not known whether the other people did not get tested for Q fever, tested negative, or did not report an exposure to fetal sheep cell injections. \n\n'Cell therapy may be harmful and is not legally available in the United States. They chose to receive injections of fetal sheep cells to improve their general health and vitality, and had not previously experienced signs or symptoms of illness after injections. It is important to distinguish between this alternative method involving animal cells and mainstream cancer treatments that use human cells, such as bone marrow transplantation. Dr Niehans claimed that he treated more than 30 000 patients with cell therapy. None of the patients reported other potential exposures to Q fever, with the exception of 1 patient who reported contact with sheep horn or bone. Some practitioners have proposed using cell therapy to treat AIDS patients. 3 patients reported preexisting medical conditions: one patient with atrial fibrillation and kidney stones, one patient with Parkinson disease and osteoarthritis, and one patient with multiple sclerosis. The treatment known as live cell therapy was developed in Switzerland during the 1930s by Paul Niehans. Cell therapy is promoted as an alternative form of cancer treatment. In Canada, xenotransplantation cell therapy products are regulated as drugs under the Food and Drugs Act and the Food and Drug Regulations. No reliable evidence has been published in medical journals to support the claims of cell therapy. Claims of the therapy's success take the form of individual cases, testimonials, and publicity issued by practitioners of the therapy.

Because of safety concerns and lack of proof of its effectiveness, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has banned the import of cell therapy products into the country. In September 2014, the German physician notified patients treated during January-July 2014 of their potential Q fever exposure.

Goebel HH, Walther G, Meuth M: Fresh cell therapy followed by fatal coma. Serious side effects can result from cell therapy. The Swiss physician Paul Niehans, MD, invented cell therapy in 1931. The other 2 patients had experienced symptoms but had not sought medical care until notification of their potential Q fever exposure. \n\nThis outbreak highlights one of the public health issues associated with xenotourism, the travel outside a country of residence for the purpose of participating in xenotransplantation programs. Complications following cell therapy. This prompted Q fever testing of the 5 patients in New York, 3 of whom had already sought medical care for symptoms. Cell therapy suspended. For instance, a patient with a diseased liver may receive injections of animal liver cells.

Domestic ungulates such as sheep, cattle, and goats serve as the reservoir of infection for humans.\n\nHumans usually become infected by inhaling aerosolized organisms that are shed in urine, feces, milk, and especially birthing products; intermittent high-level shedding occurs at the time of parturition, with millions of bacteria being released per gram of placenta. Acute symptoms of a flu-like illness with hepatitis or pneumonia usually develop within 2-3 weeks after exposure, although as many as half of humans infected with _C. burnetii_ do not show symptoms (http://www.cdc.gov/qfever/symptoms/index.html).

Sporadic cases can also occur in people living in urban areas that are downstream from farms or abattoirs where the organisms have become aerosolized.\n\nThe acute and chronic stages of infection correspond to 2 distinct antigenic phases of antibody response.

This organism is an agent that can be resistant to heat and desiccation, and is highly infectious by the aerosol route. A single inhaled organism may produce clinical illness. Indeed, in [non-human] primates, the dose to kill 50 per cent of the primates was found to be 1.7 organisms (1).\n\nCattle, sheep, and goats are the primary reservoirs of _C. burnetii_. Infection has been noted in a wide variety of other animals, including other species of livestock and in domesticated pets. _C. burnetii_ does not usually cause clinical disease in these animals, although abortion in goats and sheep has been linked to _C. burnetii_ infection. Organisms are excreted in milk, urine, and feces of infected animals. Most importantly, during birthing the organisms are shed in high numbers within the amniotic fluids and the placenta. Contact with contaminated wool is known to be a mode of transmission (2).\n\nThe organisms can be resistant to heat, drying, and many common disinfectants. These features enable the bacteria to survive for long periods in the environment. This very stable form of _C. burnetii_ is associated with compact small cell variants of the organism that are produced during standard replication along with the less resistant large cell form, metabolically dormant, and spore-like (3).\n\nInfection of humans usually occurs by inhalation of these organisms from air that contains airborne barnyard dust contaminated by dried placental material, birth fluids, and excreta of infected herd animals. Humans are often very susceptible to the disease, and very few organisms may be required to cause infection.\n\nIngestion of contaminated milk, followed by regurgitation and inspiration of the contaminated food, is a less common mode of transmission.

Sabine Zentis, edited]\nhttp://www.br.de/nachrichten/unterfranken/q-fieber-welle-sulzfeld-100.html\n\n\nIn Sulzfeld (Rhoen-Grabfeld district), since January [2014], 12 people have been confirmed with Q-fever. According to the competent health authority, 25 more people are suspected to be suffering from Q-fever. Most cases are located in the centre of Sulzfeld.\n\nHorst Rusche, head of the health department of the district of Rhoen-Grabfeld, told the 'Bayerischer Rundfunk' that some of those affected are suffering from lung infections or pneumonia. Six patients had to be hospitalized. According to Rusche, the pathogen is believed to have been transmitted from sheep through dust in the air. In 5 sheep, the pathogen was confirmed. These sheep were disinfected [comment] and are now housed in a stable. The last case was registered on 28 Apr 2014. 'Additional cases can not be ruled out,' said Rusche.\n\nAccording to the health department, the incubation in humans is usually 2 to 3 weeks. Those affected mostly suffer from fever, chills, muscle pain and severe headache. Rusche warned that Q fever infection of pregnant women in the 1st 3 months of pregnancy may lead, in many cases, to loss of the child. For people with heart valve disease, or a heart valve prosthesis, there is a risk that the Q fever infection will become chronic.\n\nPeople can be infected by dust-borne Q fever pathogens from infected herds over a distance of up to 2 km. Direct transmission of Q-fever from person to person is, according to Rusche, a rare event.\n\nThe health department invites the people in Sulzfeld to an information meeting planned for 15 May 2014. The citizens will be offered a blood test.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nSabine Zentis\nCastleview English Longhorns\nGut Laach\nD-52385 Nideggen\n<cvlonghorns@aol.com>\n\n[The report said that the 5 sheep in which the pathogen was confirmed 'were disinfected and are now housed in a stable.' However, no disinfection of live sheep is feasible.\n\nAccording to compiled data on Q fever in Germany (see 20110225.0620), numerous incidents in humans and animals have been recorded throughout the years, including 2 of significance during the previous decade:\n- 2003 - an outbreak (299 human cases) was associated with a contaminated ewe in a farmer's market in Soest (North Rhine-Westphalia).\n- 2005 - an outbreak (331 human cases, 188 laboratory-confirmed) in Jenna was related to proximity to sheep.\n\nSubscribers may be reminded of the major epidemic of Q fever in Germany's neighbour, the Netherlands, between 2007 and 2010. More than 4000 notified human cases were recorded during the event, which had a seasonal pattern synchronic with the kidding and lambing seasons of goats and sheep, respectively. From its start, experts identified dairy goat farms with Q-fever-induced abortion waves as the primary source. By the end of 2012, Dutch authorities declared the Q-fever outbreak over, after about 50 000 pregnant goats had been culled and the remaining dairy goats had been given mandatory vaccination.\n\nA useful summary and analysis of the Dutch event is available in a recent paper (Ref. below; thanks to Sabine Zentis for drawing our attention to the paper). The authors conclude:\n\n'Our findings deliver evidence that, apart from Q-fever positive farms, land-applied contaminated manure may be a significant source of human Q-fever:\n1. The temporal sequence of events, where lambing is followed by field application of manure, and manure application is followed by illness onset in human cases, is compatible with, and suggestive of, a contributing role of manure, given the average incubation period of human Q-fever;\n2. A higher percentage of human cases were temporo-spatially linked with contaminated land parcels than with Q-fever positive farms (QFPFs);\n3. Incidence of human Q-fever cases was significantly higher around contaminated land parcels than non-contaminated land parcels.\n4. Incidence of human Q-fever cases around contaminated land parcels decreased with distance, suggesting an exposure-response relationship, while incidence around non-contaminated land parcels did not;\n5. A higher percentage of human cases were temporo-spatially linked with QFPFs with land than QFPFs without land.'\n\nIt will be interesting to note whether conditions in Bavaria, including land application of manure from sheep or goat farms, are comparable to the ones observed in the Netherlands.\n\nReference:\nHermans T, Jeurissen L, Hackert V, Hoebe C (2014) Land-Applied Goat Manure as a Source of Human Q-Fever in the Netherlands, 2006-2010.

Cattle, sheep, and goats are the primary reservoirs, although a variety of species may be infected. Organisms are excreted in milk, urine, and feces of infected animals. During birthing, the organisms are shed in high numbers within the amniotic fluids and the placenta. The organism is extremely hardy and resistant to heat, drying, and many common disinfectants, which enables the bacteria to survive for long periods in the environment.\n\nInfection of humans usually occurs by inhalation of these organisms from air that contains airborne barnyard dust contaminated by dried placental material, birth fluids, and excreta of infected animals. Other modes of transmission to humans, including tick bites, ingestion of unpasteurized milk or dairy products, and human to human transmission, are rare. Humans are often very susceptible to the disease, and very few organisms may be required to cause infection.'\n\nQ fever is an important zoonosis, with veterinarians, laboratory workers, farmers and abattoir workers at risk. Surveys have shown that significant numbers of livestock handlers have antibodies, indicating exposure to the organism.\n\nLess than half of people infected become ill, and most infections are mild. But affected persons can develop a high fever with headache, muscle pains, sore throat, nausea and vomiting, chest and stomach pains. The fever can last for one or 2 weeks and lead to pneumonia or affect the liver. Treatment involves long term antibiotic therapy.\n\nIn a small percentage of cases, a chronic, severe debilitating disease occurs. People with suppressed immune systems and those with pre-existing heart valve problems are at risk of this complication, which is often fatal. There is also a post Q fever syndrome of chronic fatigue.\n\nQ fever is the 2nd most commonly reported laboratory infection, with several recorded outbreaks involving 15 or more persons http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Media_Center/docs/pdf/Disease_cards/Q-FEVER-EN.pdf.\n\nThe following information was obtained from a publication titled 'Epidemiological characteristics of serologically confirmed Q Fever cases in South Korea, 2006-2011.' In the discussion it was noted that: 'This is the 1st official report on the characteristics of Q fever patients in Korea. The annual incidence of Q fever in Korea is much lower than that in France, Australia and Taiwan (0.02 vs. 2.5, 0.1, and 0.38 per 100 000 population, respectively). As the disease has a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations, from nonspecific febrile illness to neurological disorder, and there are no known outbreaks in Korea, it is difficult for physicians to diagnose Q fever without an increased awareness. Serological diagnostic testing is limited, because it is available at only one national laboratory. Therefore, Q fever is likely to be under-diagnosed and under-reported in Korea.'\n\n'According to national surveys of_ C. burnetti _ seroprevalence in the Korean population, the seropositivity rate of high-risk occupation groups, such as dairy farmers, slaughterhouse workers, and veterinarians, was 3.7-10.2 percent (data not shown). Q fever is not currently considered to be a significant threat to public health in Korea. Only sporadic cases have been reported to date, but there is a possibility of an epidemic. Therefore, increased awareness among physicians for better detection and treatment of Q fever, expansion of the diagnostic system, and further investigations for undiscovered risk factors, are persistently required.'\n\nReference:\nKwak, Wooseok et al (2013) Epidemiological Characteristics of Serologically Confirmed Q Fever Cases in South Korea, 2006-2011.

In Linn County, the infection appears to be in the Harrisburg area. In each county, one case is confirmed and the other is presumptive, Moore said. 'They are 45 miles [72.4 km] apart, so they aren't related,' Moore said. 'We have to emphasize that the general public is not at risk, but people should be diligent about washing their hands, just like we advise during flu season.'\n\nMoore said that usually there are only 3 to 5 cases statewide in a year. 'Therefore, these cases represent an unusually high number in a short period of time for this geographic area,' he said. 'We are requesting the public's help identifying and reporting additional cases.' Moore said Q fever is found in cattle, sheep, and goats and it is spread through milk, urine, and feces. The number of organisms is unusually high during birthing in the amniotic fluids and placentas of animals, especially sheep. Especially at risk are farmers, ranchers, livestock shearers, stockyard workers, animal transporters, and laboratory workers as well as veterinary staffers.\n\nInfection of humans usually occurs due to inhalation of organisms attached to barnyard dust or dried fluids. The incubation period is from 14 to 22 days. Symptoms include: high fever; severe headache; general malaise, myalgia, chills or sweats, non-productive cough; nausea, vomiting, diarrhea; abdominal pain, chest pain. According to the Centers for Disease Control, if untreated, the fever can last from 9 to 14 days and from 30 to 50 per cent of patients develop pneumonia. Although most people recover from acute Q fever, there have been instances in which the condition has led to inflammation of the heart tissue or hepatitis. It can cause pre-term delivery or miscarriages in pregnant women.\n\nHealth officials encourage anyone who works with livestock to appropriately dispose of animal placentas, birth products, fetal membranes, especially of sheep and goats. They should restrict access to barns and laboratories used in housing potentially infected animals. The public should use only pasteurized milk and milk products. Take extra caution when washing laboratory clothing. Quarantine imported animals. Ensure that holding facilities for sheep be located away from populated areas.\n\nMoore said that in Oregon, Q fever is a condition that should be reported to local health departments.

Domestic ungulates such as sheep, cattle, and goats serve as the reservoir of infection for humans.\n\nHumans usually become infected by inhaling aerosolized organisms that are shed in urine, feces, milk, and especially birthing products of infected animals; intermittent high-level shedding occurs at the time of parturition, with millions of bacteria being released per gram of placenta. Acute symptoms of a flu-like illness with hepatitis or pneumonia usually develop within 2-3 weeks after exposure, although as many as half of humans infected with _C. burnetii_ do not show symptoms (http://www.cdc.gov/qfever/symptoms/index.html). Although most persons with acute Q fever recover, others may experience serious chronic illness within a few months or several years after acute infection, with complications that include endocarditis (especially in patients with previous cardiac valvulopathy), infected aneurysms or vascular prostheses, and chronic hepatitis.\n\nQ fever is primarily an occupational hazard for farmers, veterinarians, and abattoir workers in contact with infected domestic animals such as cattle, sheep, and goats and for laboratory personnel performing _C. burnetii_ cultures and working with _C. burnetii_-infected animals (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC88923/). Sporadic cases can also occur in people living in urban areas that are downstream from farms or abattoirs where the organisms have become aerosolized. Other modes of transmission to humans, including tick bites and ingestion of unpasteurized milk or dairy products (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr6203a1.htm). Q fever has rarely followed blood transfusion, bone marrow transplantation, and suspected sexual transmission via infected sperm (http://www.gezondheidsraad.nl/sites/default/files/201115EQfever.pdf).\n\nQ fever spreads easily in agricultural regions via airborne particles containing the _C. burnetii_ for a considerable distances to involve people living downwind from infected livestock. Widespread transmission of Q fever was recently documented in the Netherlands downwind from the index farm from a single dairy-goat farm, even beyond a 5 km [3 mi] high-risk zone (http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/55/12/1591.long#T2).\n\nThe acute and chronic stages of infection correspond to 2 distinct antigenic phases of antibody response. During an acute infection, an antibody response to _C. burnetii_ phase II antigen is predominant and is higher than the response to the phase I antigen, whereas chronic infection is associated with a rising phase I immunoglobulin G (IgG) titer.\n\nCDC [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] has recently issued recommendations for the recognition, clinical and laboratory diagnosis, treatment, and management of Q fever (CDC.

Widespread transmission of Q fever was recently documented in the Netherlands downwind from the index farm from a single dairy-goat farm, even beyond a 5 km [3 mi] high-risk zone (http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/55/12/1591.long#T2). Moore said Q fever is found in cattle, sheep, and goats and it is spread through milk, urine, and feces. Symptoms include: high fever; severe headache; general malaise, myalgia, chills or sweats, non-productive cough; nausea, vomiting, diarrhea; abdominal pain, chest pain. \n\nThe acute and chronic stages of infection correspond to 2 distinct antigenic phases of antibody response. \n\nMoore said that in Oregon, Q fever is a condition that should be reported to local health departments. \n\nInfection of humans usually occurs due to inhalation of organisms attached to barnyard dust or dried fluids. Although most people recover from acute Q fever, there have been instances in which the condition has led to inflammation of the heart tissue or hepatitis. \n\nMoore said that usually there are only 3 to 5 cases statewide in a year.

Emerg Infect Dis. 2013 Jul; 19(7): 1102-4. doi: 10.3201/eid1907.130044]\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nQ fever, which is caused by the bacterium _Coxiella burnetii_, has rapidly emerged in French Guiana since 1996 (1). The incidence of acute Q fever in the capital, Cayenne, is one of the highest in the world. The annual incidence of Q fever was estimated at 37 cases/100 000 persons in 1996 (2) and increased to 150 cases/100 000 persons in 2005 (3). The most common clinical feature of Q fever in Cayenne is pneumonia, and _C. burnetii_ is the causative agent of 24 percent of all community-acquired pneumonias (4). These forms of acute Q fever are particularly severe (4). Subsequently, we have hypothesized the existence of a specific source of _C. burnetii_ responsible for human infections, which is unidentified to date, and the existence of a different strain of _C. burnetii_ that circulates in Cayenne.\n\nQ fever is diagnosed by serologic analysis in Cayenne. _C. burnetii_ is rarely identified by PCR and has yet to be cultured in Cayenne. In this study, we isolated 5 _C. burnetii_ strains from biologic samples of patients from Cayenne. We compared the strains from Cayenne with other strains and showed that a unique genotype is circulating in Cayenne. This unique genotype might be related to the clinical and epidemiologic features of severe fever in Cayenne.\n\nAs a national reference center for Q fever, our center receives samples from France and other regions for serologic, molecular, histologic, and immunohistochemical analyses as described (5-7). In 2012, we received a cardiac valve sample from a patient in Cayenne with Q fever endocarditis who had undergone surgery in Martinique. In the same year, we collected 4 heparinized blood samples from patients with acute Q fever from Cayenne that were collected before initiation of antimicrobial drug treatment.\n\nThe patient in Cayenne who had endocarditis was a 60-year-old man. Serologic titers of IgG1 increased to 51 200 in this patient, and results of quantitative PCR (qPCR) and immunohistochemical analyses of the valvular sample were positive for _C. burnetii_. The other 4 patients (2 men and 2 women) had fever and acute pneumonia, and 2 of them also had increased transaminase levels. All 4 patients had serologic titers compatible with acute Q fever. The heparinized blood samples were tested by using a specific qPCR; samples from only 1 patient were positive for _C. burnetii_.\n\nAll samples were cultured as described (8). We successfully cultured _C. burnetii_ from the valvular sample after incubation for 16 days and from 3 blood samples after incubation for 25, 32, and 32 days. Paradoxically, the only blood sample that was positive by qPCR was negative by culture. Genotyping was performed by using multispacer sequence typing for intergenic regions (9). We identified the isolate from the cardiac valve as genotype 17. Spacers Cox 51 and Cox 20 were the most discriminating spacers in identifying this genotype, and the 3 isolates from the blood cultures were also identified by these 2 spacers as genotype 17. This genotype had been identified in our laboratory only once, in 2000 in an aortic valve of a 40-year-old French man who had undergone surgery in France, had Q fever endocarditis, and was co-infected with _Streptococcus oralis_. Retrospectively, we found that patient had lived in Cayenne for years before his diagnosis with Q fever endocarditis. Therefore, all genotype 17 isolates were obtained from who lived or had lived in Cayenne, making it unique to this area. We determined the antimicrobial drug susceptibilities of these isolates, and the MIC [minimum inhibitory concentration] of doxycycline was 0.25 microg/mL for all isolates (10).\n\nFor the past 10 years, routine cell culture for _C. burnetii_ has been performed in our laboratory. We found that the proportion of isolates obtained from blood samples of patients with acute Q fever was higher for patients from Cayenne than for patients from metropolitan France. We obtained 3 isolates from 5 blood samples from untreated patients in Cayenne and 3 isolates from 65 samples from patients in metropolitan France (p = 0.003, by Fisher exact test). However, we did not find any difference with respect to the culture delay between patients from the 2 locations.\n\nOur work shows that genotype 17, a unique genotype, is circulating in Cayenne. This genotype is related to genotypes that harbor the QpH1 plasmid, which causes the most severe clinical forms of acute Q fever in experimental animal models (11,12). Only bacteria from this group and bacteria containing the QpDV plasmid have been found in cases of human acute Q fever (9,13). We believe that severity of Q fever infection is related to the strain of _C. burnetii_ circulating in Cayenne. Because the population in French Guiana is a large diversity of Creole, Amerindian, Maroon, Caucasian, and Asian persons (14), we excluded the hypothesis that genetic susceptibility of patients from Cayenne to _C. burnetii_ infection might be related to severity of the disease.\n\nWe observed a higher rate of strain isolation from the blood of patients from Cayenne than from the blood of patients from metropolitan France. This difference may be related to a higher bacterial load in blood or a greater ability of the bacteria to grow on cell cultures. This second hypothesis seems more likely because even if the observed delay for the first culture was the same for genotype 17 and other genotypes, the strain from Cayenne was isolated more frequently in the cell line that we used (HEL cells) than other strains from France. In addition, we did not find a higher number of DNA copies in the blood of patients from Cayenne, and qPCR results were not correlated with culture results.\n\n_C. burnetii_ isolates from Cayenne were susceptible to antimicrobial drugs, particularly doxycycline. These isolates cause acute pneumonia and endocarditis. Among the 34 genotypes identified in our study by multispacer sequence typing, 28 (82 percent) were associated with disease in humans. A larger biodiversity of strains has been observed in samples from patients in metropolitan France (9), where 21 genotypes circulate. In contrast, during the recent Q fever outbreak in the Netherlands, it appears that a single strain (genotype 33) was responsible for the epidemic (15). We believe that there has been an epidemic developing in Cayenne since 1996 that is caused primarily, if not solely, by a single strain that has circulated since at least 2000, whose reservoir is unknown (1,2).\n\nIn conclusion, _C. burnetii_ genotype 17 is circulating in French Guiana and causing acute infections and endocarditis. This strain is epidemic and most likely causes more acute infections with exacerbated immune responses than other known genotypes of _C. burnetii_. Genotype 17 might be the most virulent genotype of _C. burnetii_ described to date.\n\nReferences\n----------\n1. Pfaff F, Francois A, Hommel D, et al: Q fever in French Guiana: new trends.

Q fever is a [zoonosis] transmitted to humans through the air, never from person to person, by inhalation of these organisms from air contaminated mostly by excreta [of infected animals].\n\nThe disease, with an incubation period of 10 to 40 days, produces high fevers and headaches, can affect organs such as the liver and, in severe cases, lead to pneumonia, but it has a low mortality and can be treated with antibiotics.\n\nIn Villaverde, the rumors that resulted from lack of information have it that more than 100 people are affected; however, the health department gives assurances that only 17 have been affected by the disease, and the clinical evolution of all of them has been favorable. Moreover, the Junta [government] says that the incubation phase has passed, and currently there are no confirmed cases. The origin of the fever was located in a cabin of goats, which was isolated.\n\nHowever, other sources indicate that at least 3 people with very similar symptoms have been admitted in the Virgen Macarena Hospital, but the diagnosis of Q fever is not as yet confirmed. Among them is a 44 year old man, a barber by trade, who as of yesterday [29 Apr 2013] remained in the ICU.\n\nMagdalena Martin, PP [Popular Party] spokesperson in the Municipality of Villaverde, asked that the local authorities and the Junta release the necessary information to reassure the residents.\n\n[byline: MD Alvarado]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Q fever is due to _Coxiella burnetii_, an obligate intracellular rickettsia-like bacterial pathogen. It is highly resistant to drying and heat, attributed to a small cell variant of the organism that is part of a biphasic developmental cycle. Q fever is a zoonosis. Domestic ungulates such as sheep, cattle, and goats serve as the reservoir of infection for humans. The organism is shed in urine, feces, milk, and especially birthing products; intermittent high-level shedding occurs at the time of parturition, with millions of bacteria being released per gram of placenta.\n\nHumans usually become infected by inhaling aerosolized organisms. Acute symptoms of a flu-like illness usually develop within 2-3 weeks of exposure, although as many as half of humans infected with _C. burnetii_ do not show symptoms (http://www.cdc.gov/qfever/symptoms/index.html). Although most persons with acute Q fever infection recover, others may experience serious illness with complications that may include pneumonia, granulomatous hepatitis, endocarditis (especially in patients with previous cardiac valvulopathy), myocarditis, and central nervous system involvement. Pregnant women who are infected may be at risk for pre-term delivery or miscarriage.\n\nQ fever is distributed worldwide with the exception of New Zealand. Q fever is primarily an occupational hazard for farmers, veterinarians, and abattoir workers in contact with domestic animals such as cattle, sheep and goats and for laboratory personnel performing _C. burnetii_ cultures and working with _C. burnetii_-infected animals (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC88923/). Sporadic cases occur in people living in urban areas that are downstream from farms or abattoirs where the organisms have become aerosolized. Occasional cases follow contact with farm animals or after contact with infected pets such as dogs and cats.\n\nQ fever is diagnosed predominantly in Northern Spain, especially in the Basque and Navarra provinces, supposedly because of the greater cattle-raising activities in these areas (Maurin M, Raoult D. Q Fever Clin Microbiol Rev. 1999;12(4): 518-553. Available at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC88923/). A large number of cases have been also diagnosed in the Madrid area. Q fever most often presents as pneumonia in the Basque region in northern Spain, where Q fever is said to be the 2nd commonest cause of community-acquired pneumonia, whereas hepatitis is predominant in Andalusia in southern Spain. Most cases occur between March and July, corresponding to the peak in the lambing season.\n\nVillaverde del Rio, with a population of 7614 in 2012, is a small city located in the province of Seville, the most populous province in Andalusia (http://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&bav=on.2,or.r_qf.&biw=1280&bih=598&q=villaverde+del+rio+seville).

He is still recovering.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The causative bacterium, _Coxiella burnetii_, is fairly ubiquitous. Most animals, including humans are susceptible to the effects of the bacterium. Cattle, sheep, and goats can harbor the bacterium. Caretakers of the animals are most often exposed during the birthing process. People are exposed to the bacterium via dust particles.\n\n_C. burnetii_ is increasingly recognized as an important cause of caprine abortion, especially in the western USA. Occasional outbreaks also occur in sheep. Late-term abortions, stillbirths, and weak lambs are the common presentations. Up to 50 percent of the flock may be involved. The placenta is covered by gray-brown exudate and the intercotyledonary areas are thickened. Microscopically, there is a necrotizing vasculitis in the placenta, and many chorionic epithelial cells are distended by small, coccobacillary organisms less than 1 mm in diameter. Infection involves only the placenta; without it, the diagnosis usually cannot be made. Diagnosis is by identification of _C. burnetii_ by immunologic staining methods or by isolation. _Coxiella_ is zoonotic, causing Q fever in humans.\n\nPeople most at risk may be veterinarians, producers, milkers, and those in the slaughter facilities as the bacteria may be aerosolized at various times in the course of each individual's work. Animals may be infected, but with mild signs that may be missed by the caretakers -- or there may not be any clinical signs.\n\nRespiratory protection for these individuals as well as strict code of hygiene is important in preventing the disease.\n\nIn humans, the acute symptoms caused by infection with _C. burnetii_ usually develop within 2-3 weeks of exposure, although as many as half the humans infected with _C. burnetii_ do not show symptoms (http://www.cdc.gov/qfever/symptoms/index.html).\n\nThe following is a list of symptoms commonly seen with acute Q fever. However, it is important to note that the combination of symptoms varies greatly from person to person:\n- high fevers (up to 104-105 degrees F)\n- severe headache\n- general malaise\n- myalgia\n- chills and/or sweats\n- non-productive cough\n- nausea\n- vomiting\n- diarrhea\n- abdominal pain\n- chest pain\n\nAlthough most persons with acute Q fever infection recover, others may experience serious illness with complications that may include pneumonia, granulomatous hepatitis (inflammation of the liver), myocarditis (inflammation of the heart tissue), and central nervous system complications. Pregnant women who are infected may be at risk for pre-term delivery or miscarriage. The estimated case fatality rate (that is, the proportion of persons who die as a result of their infection) is low, at less than 2 percent of hospitalized patients. Treatment with the correct antibiotic may shorten the course of illness for acute Q fever.\n\nPortions of this comment were extracted from http://www.merckvetmanual.com/mvm/index.jsp?cfile=htm/bc/110306.htm&word=q%2cfever.\n\nIdaho may be found on HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at http://healthmap.org/r/1CnG. - Mod.TG]", "summary": "However, it is important to note that the combination of symptoms varies greatly from person to person:\n- high fevers (up to 104-105 degrees F)\n- severe headache\n- general malaise\n- myalgia\n- chills and/or sweats\n- non-productive cough\n- nausea\n- vomiting\n- diarrhea\n- abdominal pain\n- chest pain\n\n A ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n Source: KTVB [edited]\nhttp://www.ktvb.com/news/local/159310085.html\n\n\nQ fever confirmed in Idaho livestock\n Communicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap alerts\n< \n\nThe ISDA encourages all livestock owners and handlers to be aware of the signs of illness and contact their veterinarian if animals display signs of Q fever.

It was also found in flying squirrels in the Peterborough area, indicating that the bacterium may be widespread among these animal populations in Ontario.'\n\nThe bacterium is a cause of Query fever, also known as Q-Fever, in humans.\n\nAccording to the Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs (OMAFRA) website: 'Human Q fever is primarily an occupational disease of farmers, abattoir workers, veterinarians, and laboratory workers.'\n\nThe disease is a flu-like illness that often remains undiagnosed. In a minority of cases, it can cause a clinical atypical pneumonia or hepatitis. If the disease becomes chronic, endocarditis and chronic hepatitis can develop. Chronic Q fever can be fatal, and is more likely to develop in immuno-compromised individuals and pregnant women.\n\nThe OMAFRA website states: 'In Ontario, Q-fever has occasionally been diagnosed as a cause of abortion in sheep and goats. Reported human cases have been associated with exposure to abortions in sheep and goats, and drinking unpasteurised goat's milk.'\n\n'It can be transmitted reasonably easily among wildlife,' Schulte-Hostedde said. 'The suggestion is that people can get it from, like the hantavirus, inhaling feces. Let's say you have a cottage or a camp and sweep the corners. Any fecal material will dry and aerosolize, it goes up in the air and you inhale some of it.'\n\nIn 2007, an outbreak in the Netherlands resulted in the infection of more than 2000 people. Thousands of goats were culled.\n\n'There is a lot of interest in Europe now on how this pathogen is transmitted in the natural environment,' said Schulte-Hostedde. He says there is a hypothesis that ticks may be a cause of the spread of this pathogen.\n\nSchulte-Hostedde says he has spoken intensively to an Algonquin Park biologist who has indicated that there have been no reports of people becoming ill with Q-Fever.\n\n'In terms of mortality, I don't think it's going to kill anybody. There are no huge numbers of people reporting being ill,' he said. 'We put the press release out not to alarm people but so that the public health authorities know that this bug is out there.' He says this might be quite a large spread, and there are different strains of the pathogen, some that may be more dangerous than others. 'We don't know anything about the strain that we found versus what might be found on farms,' he said. He says after discussions with Public Health Ontario and the Public Health Agency of Canada that they are aware that it is out there, and it is reportable at some levels.\n\n'They are aware that it happens on farms, but there is no real work that is being done on _Coxiella burnetii_ in the natural environment,' he said. 'My point with the whole thing ... it is just providing awareness that there is a microbrobe that can make you sick, so you should take some precautions.'\n\nSchulte-Hostedde says he is in the process of returning to his initial studies, and a zoonotics expert at the University of Guelph is hoping to attain OMAFRA funding to study this bacterium in a natural environment because there are still many questions to be answered, including whether it is being transferred from farm to the natural environment or vice versa, and whether the strains are the same.\n\n'It has an interesting history, because it has been the subject of weaponization research in the United States,' he said. 'That's part of the sexy thing about this thing. It actually can infect people relatively easily, which is part of the history of human relationships with this bacteria.'\n\nHe says in order to get the real story beyond the initial findings and the hundreds of animals tested, there is much more work to be done.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The initial description of Q fever as an illness was among abattoir workers in Australia.

It is transmitted primarily by aerosol route or by ingestion of fomites from infected animals, mostly from domestic ruminants. Although over 40 tick species can be infected with _C. burnetii_, direct transmission of this agent to humans from infected ticks has never been properly documented. However, ticks may play a critical role in the transmission of _C. burnetii_ among wild vertebrates. Only a few studies, mostly related to human clinical cases or sero-epidemiologic evaluation of healthy animals, have reported _C. burnetii_ in South America. However, to our knowledge, _C. burnetii_ has never been reported in ticks in the continent.\n\nDuring ecologic studies on _Amblyomma parvum_ and _A. tigrinum_ ticks in Cordoba Province, Argentina, engorged nymphs were collected from the common yellow toothed cavy (the rodent _Galea musteloides_) (92 _A. tigrinum_, 13 _A. parvum_). In the laboratory, engorged nymphs molted to adults, which were individually submitted to the hemolymph test with Gimenez staining for detection of rickettsiae-like organisms. By the hemolymph test, one _A. tigrinum_ female, and 2 _A. parvum_ male ticks were found to contain red-stained rickettsiae-like structures. These 3 ticks were processed individually by the shell vial technique, with the purpose of isolating intracellular bacteria in Vero cell culture. DNA from the infected cells of each of the 3 isolates was extracted and processed by PCR protocols selective for portions of 3 genes of the genus _Coxiella_. We sequenced the PCR products, finding that they were 99.9 percent (99.6 percent (556/558 nt) and 99.6 percent identical to the corresponding GenBank sequences of the North American _C. burnetii_ genes 16S rRNA, cap, and pyrG, respectively.\n\nTicks negative for rickettsiae-like organisms by hemolymph testing were subjected individually to DNA extraction, and 40 _A. tigrinum_ ticks yielded amplicons of the expected size for the pyrG gene.

Mod.AS, edited]\nhttp://tinyurl.com/d3uzw7j\n\n\nA new case of Q fever has been identified in Elim (municipality Hoogeveen, Drenthe province). This has been reported by the Ministry of Agriculture.\n\nThe infection came to light through the bulk milk testing that is done every 4 weeks. It is the 1st case of Q fever since December 2011, when the bacterium reappeared on a farm in Vinkel [province North Brabant], which had already been infected. It is a farm with 440 goats. The animals showed no clinical signs; the lambing period has just ended. The VWA [Netherlands Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority] reports that the farm is known to have met the vaccination requirements. The VWA is examining the possible cause [sic] of infection.\n\nThe last [previous] case of Q fever infection on a farm which had not been infected earlier took place in April 2011. The total number of Q fever infected goat/sheep farms [in the Netherlands] is 99. [Of these farms], 58 have by now been declared free of the disease.\n\nInfected farms are required to undertake extra hygiene measures. No animal should be transported to slaughter. There is a prohibition upon the use of such farm's manure for 150 days. Visits to the farm are allowed only to professionals due to their specified responsibilities. Other visits are not allowed for 90 days after infection.\n\nSince the large outbreak of Q fever, all dairy goats and dairy sheep in the Netherlands are compulsorily vaccinated against _Coxiella burnetii_. This year's [2012] vaccination campaign started in early April 2012. All animals must be vaccinated before 1 Aug 2012. In addition, farms with a public function [which are not dairy farms], such as petting zoos, must be similarly vaccinated.\n\nQ fever is transmissible to humans.

Q fever was laboratory confirmed in 37 notified cases. Although, the outbreak is considered over, the outbreak investigation is still ongoing in order to identify aetiologic factors relevant for this outbreak.\n\nOn 27 Jan 2012 after 10 patients were hospitalised with atypical pneumonia, an outbreak of Q fever was discovered in Srem county, Vojvodina province, Serbia. Laboratory testing of some of the 1st patients for pathogens such as _Coxiella burnetii_, _Chlamydia pneumoniae_, _Mycoplasma pneumoniae_, influenza A and B, parainfluenza, and respiratory syncytial virus had all resulted negative, except for _C. burnetii_.\n\nBetween 27 Jan 2012 and 10 Feb 2012, 43 cases of Q fever were reported. The majority of patients (n=41) were residents of Nocaj, a village with 2120 inhabitants located in the vicinity of the city of Sremska Mitovica (Srem county) near the border between Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. The attack rate in this period was 2 percent.\n\nHereby we describe the preliminary results of the ongoing outbreak investigations started on 30 Jan 2012, by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention of the Institute of Public Health, Sremska Mitrovica. The investigation was assisted by the World Health Organization (WHO), Regional Office for Europe.\n\nEpidemiological investigation\n-----------------------------\nSpecific notification criteria and case definitions adapted to the current situation were applied. A probable case of Q fever, according to the European Union criteria, which are used in Serbia [1], was not relevant in this investigation because the source of the current outbreak was not yet identified, and no epidemiological link could be established.\n\nA 'clinical case' was defined as having acute fever and one or more of the following: rigors, severe retrobulbar headache, acute hepatitis, pneumonia, or elevated liver enzymes' levels with onset of illness between 20 Jan 2012 and 10 Feb 2012, and no other likely cause for illness in a patient who either lived or visited Nocaj in the period from 1 to 20 Jan 2012. The risk period for exposure was estimated considering an average incubation period of 20 days [2] and time distribution of cases.\n\nA 'clinical case' who had not been serologically tested was defined as a possible case of Q fever.\n\nA laboratory-confirmed case of acute Q fever was defined as a 'clinical case' with serologic evidence of a positive IgM and/or IgG antibody result to phase II antigen _C. burnetii_, by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The results were interpreted in line with the manufacturer's guidance as follows: <9, negative; 9-11, equivocal; >11, positive (ELISA, NovaLisa). Paired sera samples tested at least 2 weeks apart were taken for 4 patients for whom the result of the first sera tests were equivocal or negative (2 sera samples were positive after the 2nd test).\n\nAll sera samples were tested in the Reference Laboratory for Q fever, Institute of Public Health, Zrenjanin, Serbia. Of 43 notified cases, 37 were laboratory confirmed and the rest were classified as possible cases. All laboratory-confirmed cases were classified as acute Q fever cases. All cases of acute Q fever with known preconditions for chronic disease were referred for laboratory follow-up in periods of 3, 6 and 12 months after onset of illness, in order to detect the development of chronic Q fever [3]. The majority of cases (n=41) reported illness onset between 20 Jan 2012 and 1 Feb 2012 (Figure).\n\nData about the age and sex of cases rates are shown in Table 1.\n\nThe clinical features of Q fever in this outbreak are presented in Table 2.\n\nDuring the epidemiological investigation in the village households, all present family members were interviewed about symptoms of Q fever and possible preconditions for chronic Q fever. Efforts were made to conduct laboratory testing, in order to detect recent Q fever infection in asymptomatic people, with known preconditions for chronic Q fever or at risk for complications, like pregnant women (n=10) and newborns (n=2), people with heart valvular diseases (n=1) or immunosupression (n=2). Also exposed health care workers (n=9) were tested. The testing was done by ELISA in order to detect a _C. burnetii_ specific antibody response (IgG or IgM phase II), as previously described. By 26 Mar 2012, 8 additional cases of asymptomatic Q fever were discovered including 3 pregnant women, 4 exposed health care workers and one child with undefined symptoms. They were all referred to infectious disease specialists for review.\n\nIn exploratory interviews taken between 30 Jan 2012 and 16 Feb 2012, 28 of 43 patients denied direct contact with livestock, although most of them own livestock in their households. In Serbia, reporting on aborted pregnancy in domestic animals is mandatory and requires a standard number of tests including tests for _C. burnetii_. However in the previous few months, local farmers and veterinary services in Nocaj had not observed such cases.\n\nOnly 2 patients in the current outbreak were not residents of Nocaj. They visited their relatives in Nocaj for a few hours each on different days (8 and 16 Jan 2012). The time of the visits to Nocaj is compatible with the incubation period and onset of disease in these particular patients. Overall 30 of 43 patients mentioned that they had visited a football tournament in the village school sport hall, from 4 to 7 Jan 2012.\n\nEnvironmental investigation and results\n---------------------------------------\nAs the large number of cases in a small area was suggestive of a point source, smear samples were taken from heating ventilators, seats and the floor of the sport hall. DNA extraction from swabs was performed using QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Germany) in the Veterinary Specialized Institute Kraljevo, Serbia. 2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) protocols were used for molecular detection of _C. burnetii_: The Real-Time PCR protocol published by Klee et al. [4] and the PCR protocol published by Berri et al. [5] The PCR assays for _C. burnetii_ were all negative.\n\nThe Veterinary Scientific Institute, Novi Sad, conducted an epizootiologic investigation in the households of patients and their neighbours by order of the Republic Veterinary Inspectorate. Of 207 tested sheep, goats and cattle, only one seropositive sheep in the village was found. Although seropositive, the vaginal swab sample of this seropositive sheep analysed by PCR was negative. Interestingly, this seropositive sheep was detected in a particular household in which 2 of 7 human cases were registered during an outbreak of Q fever in Nocaj in 2009.\n\nEpidemiological situation in Serbia\n-----------------------------------\nQ fever, a zoonosis distributed worldwide, was recognised as a specific disease in 1937 [6], and is caused by _C. burnetii_. A wide range of animals serves as a natural reservoir for the pathogen [7]. Inhaling aerosols that are contaminated by _C. burnetii_ is the most frequent route of transmission in large human outbreaks [8,9]. Q fever outbreaks are regularly reported throughout Europe as well as in other parts of the world [10].\n\nIn Serbia, Q fever is a notifiable disease since 1966. Notification of Q fever is made on the basis of clinical diagnosis, epidemiological link and laboratory confirmation. During the last 14 years notification is based on European Union case-definition criteria in the absence of criteria adopted at the national level [1].\n\nThe Autonomous Province of Vojvodina, (Northern Province of Serbia) including Srem county is considered as an endemic region for Q fever. The latest seroepidemiological investigation of Q fever, which was conducted in 1985 and included 5599 persons (representing 0.5 percent of the adult population of Vojvodina aged between 19 and 59 years), revealed a seroprevalence of _C. burnetii_ antibodies of 9.3 percent [11]. In the period from 2002 to 2011, the incidence rate of Q fever in Vojvodina varied between 0.1-2.3 per 100 000 population. The incidence rate in Srem county varied between 0 and 2.1 per 100 000 population, with 2 outbreaks reported in 2009 [12] and 2011 (unpublished data). In the 2009 outbreak, 7 human cases were notified in the village of Nocaj. Considering the high rate of mild cases and non-specific symptoms of Q fever [10], it is estimated that the actual incidences might be higher than presented above.\n\nOutbreak control measures\n-------------------------\nThe Center for Disease Control and Prevention of the Institute of Public Health Sremska Mitrovica proposed to the management of the Nocaj elementary school to improve hygiene and proceed to a desinfection of the sport hall, and these measures were applied by order of the Provincial Sanitary Inspectorate.\n\nGeneral practitioners in the area and the nearest health care centre in Bosnia and Herzegovina were informed about the outbreak in order to make sure that any new arising cases of Q fever would be notified. All authorised institutions were informed, including the WHO, Regional Office for Europe following obligations included in the International Health Regulations (IHR) [13].\n\nEfficient data sharing with the veterinary services was ensured in order to identify potential source(s) of the outbreak and to conduct veterinary control measures. Livestock trading, slaughter and use of unpasteurised milk and products from unpasteurised milk were temporarily prohibited in the investigated households until the serology results of tested animals were obtained.\n\nExclusion of blood donors (rather than screening) from the affected region was done. Health promotion campaigns to educate citizens on how to prevent possible Q fever infection took place in the village in the form of interviews, lectures and the delivering of information leaflets. Appropriate hygiene practices when dealing with livestock by-products of birth and manure and safe procedures for clothing and footwear were the key messages in the health education campaign for farmers. People at high risk for severe Q fever infection or complications were advised not to visit or stay in the livestock holding areas or barns.\n\nIn order to investigate potential factors for airborne spread of the bacteria, official meteorological data were analysed. Epidemiological reports were updated and published on the website of the Institute of Public Health of Sremska Mitrovica providing authoritative and accurate information regarding the outbreak and reducing fear and panic in the village and area.\n\nIn order to prevent hospital-acquired _C. burnetii_ infections among health care workers and patients, the commission for the prevention of hospital infections in the general hospital Sremska Mitrovica proposed implementation of enhanced standard precautionary measures, such as monitoring compliance with hand hygiene, the use of gloves for contact with blood or body fluids, excretions and secretions, as well as anticipating the need for use of personal protective equipment (gowns, masks) according to the patient condition and type of procedure.\n\nDiscussion and conclusions\n--------------------------\nConsidering the unusual high rate of hospitalisations and atypical pneumonia in this outbreak, we can assume that the number of cases is far higher than reported. The predominance of male sex among patients is not surprising, because the infection may be asymptomatic in 60 percent of Q fever infections, especially among women and children aged 15 years and younger [14-16].\n\nAlthough a single animal source can cause many human Q fever cases [17], compared to 2009, the larger geographic area in which cases occurred in 2012 may indicate a multiple sources or possible airborne spread of _C. burnetii_. The low annual number of cases of Q fever in Nocaj registered during past few decades was due to direct contact with animal placenta and/or birth products. The sudden and unusual acute presentation of the large outbreak in the current situation, required the consideration of other routes of Q fever infection. Although many cases in the village of Nocaj had attended the same football tournament in a school sport hall, the environmental investigation yielded negative results. Moreover, there were no registered cases of Q fever among residents of other villages who attended the tournament, nor among school children/staff where the tournament took place, which argues against the school sport hall as being the source of the outbreak. Until now, no common exposure has been identified among patients who did not attend the football tournament.\n\nThe data obtained from the epidemiological investigation were not indicative of a food-borne route of infection. The presumable route of infection in this outbreak is airborne by inhalation of contaminated dust and aerosol in the period around the orthodox Christmas. During January the weather in Nocaj was unusually dry and windy so the conditions to transmit _C. burnetii_ were present. The heavy snowfall during February possibly reduced the further spread of this outbreak and limited its duration. We cannot rule out other possible causes via direct contact with livestock or by other possible exposures. Epidemiological investigation of infection sources and routes of transmission is ongoing. With this report, we would like to inform of this outbreak and raise awareness in neighbouring countries.\n\n[For Tables, Figure, and References, see the URL for this article above.]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Q fever is due to _Coxiella burnetii_, an obligate intracellular rickettsia-like bacterial pathogen. It is highly resistant to drying and heat, attributed to a small cell variant of the organism that is part of a biphasic developmental cycle. Q fever is a zoonosis. Domestic ungulates such as sheep, cattle, and goats serve as the reservoir of infection for humans. The organism is shed in urine, feces, milk, and especially in birth products.\n\nHumans usually become infected by inhaling aerosolized organisms. Acute symptoms of a 'flu-like illness usually develop within 2-3 weeks of exposure, although as many as half of humans infected with _C. burnetii_ do not show symptoms (http://www.cdc.gov/qfever/symptoms/index.html). Although most persons with acute Q fever infection recover, others may experience serious illness with complications that may include pneumonia, granulomatous hepatitis, endocarditis, myocarditis, and central nervous system involvement. Pregnant women who are infected may be at risk for pre-term delivery or miscarriage.\n\nNocaj is a village in northern Serbia, with a population of 2120 people in 2002.

Moreover, there were no registered cases of Q fever among residents of other villages who attended the tournament, nor among school children/staff where the tournament took place, which argues against the school sport hall as being the source of the outbreak. During the epidemiological investigation in the village households, all present family members were interviewed about symptoms of Q fever and possible preconditions for chronic Q fever. By 26 Mar 2012, 8 additional cases of asymptomatic Q fever were discovered including 3 pregnant women, 4 exposed health care workers and one child with undefined symptoms. Interestingly, this seropositive sheep was detected in a particular household in which 2 of 7 human cases were registered during an outbreak of Q fever in Nocaj in 2009. In order to prevent hospital-acquired _C. burnetii_ infections among health care workers and patients, the commission for the prevention of hospital infections in the general hospital Sremska Mitrovica proposed implementation of enhanced standard precautionary measures, such as monitoring compliance with hand hygiene, the use of gloves for contact with blood or body fluids, excretions and secretions, as well as anticipating the need for use of personal protective equipment (gowns, masks) according to the patient condition and type of procedure.

The latest seroepidemiological investigation of Q fever, which was conducted in 1985 and included 5599 persons (representing 0.5 percent of the adult population of Vojvodina aged between 19 and 59 years), revealed a seroprevalence of _C. burnetii_ antibodies of 9.3 percent [11]. \n\nAll sera samples were tested in the Reference Laboratory for Q fever, Institute of Public Health, Zrenjanin, Serbia.

This organism is an agent that can be resistant to heat and\ndesiccation and highly infectious by the aerosol route. A single\ninhaled organism may produce clinical illness. Indeed, in [non-human]\nprimates, the dose to kill 50 percent of the primates was found to be\n1.7 organisms (1).\n\nCattle, sheep, and goats are the primary reservoirs of _C. burnetii_.\nInfection has been noted in a wide variety of other animals, including\nother species of livestock and domesticated pets. _C. burnetii_ does\nnot usually cause clinical disease in these animals, although abortion\nin goats and sheep has been linked to _C. burnetii_ infection.\nOrganisms are excreted in milk, urine, and feces of infected animals.\nMost importantly, during birthing, the organisms are shed in high\nnumbers within the amniotic fluids and the placenta. Contact with\ncontaminated wool is known to be a mode of transmission (2).\n\nThe organisms can be resistant to heat, drying, and many common\ndisinfectants. These features enable the bacteria to survive for long\nperiods in the environment. This very stable form of _C. burnetii_ is\nassociated with compact small-cell variants of the organism that are\nproduced during standard replication (along with the less resistant\nlarge-cell form) and are metabolically dormant and spore-like (3).\n\nThe Q fever organism is a category B bioterrorism agent and, in fact,\nalthough not thought to be related to bioterrorism, was spread by mail\nin a post office in the UK in 1987 (4).\n\nInfection of humans usually occurs by inhalation of these organisms\nfrom air that contains airborne barnyard dust contaminated by dried\nplacental material, birth fluids, and excreta of infected herd\nanimals. Humans are often very susceptible to the disease, and very\nfew organisms may be required to cause infection.\n\nIngestion of contaminated milk, followed by regurgitation and\ninspiration of the contaminated food, is a less common mode of\ntransmission. Instances of other modes of transmission to humans,\nincluding tick bites and human to human transmission, are rare.\n\nAn earlier outbreak of infection in 51 persons in Scotland, UK was\ntied to a meat processing plant and appeared to spread via aerosol for\nat least 0.5 mi (0.8 km).\n\nReferences\n----------\n1.

On\n10 June 2011, the Washington State Department of Health and Montana\nDepartment of Public Health and Human Services requested CDC\nassistance to characterize the extent of the outbreak, distribute Q\nfever information, and identify others at risk for infection.\n\nGoats sold after June 2010 by the Washington farm where _C. burnetii_\ninitially was detected were traced to 21 farms in Washington (10\ncounties), Montana (3 counties), and Oregon (1 county). 17 farms\nparticipated in the outbreak investigation. _C. burneti_i infection\nwas detected in 16 of 17 goat herds, including polymerase chain\nreaction confirmation of bacterial shedding in feces, vaginal mucous,\nor milk in 161 of 667 (24 percent) goats tested and an overall\nseroprevalence of 21 percent (131 of 615) by enzyme-linked\nimmunosorbent assay.

The states have received no additional\nreports of Q fever since July 2011.\n\nQ fever (a category B bioterrorism agent) is a nationally notifiable\ndisease in humans and is endemic throughout the USA with a national\nseroprevalence of 3 percent (2). Washington and Montana typically\nreport about 3 cases of Q fever annually. Acute Q fever is\ncharacterized by a self-limited febrile illness or, less often, by\npneumonia or hepatitis. Less common still is chronic Q fever, which\naffects less than 5 percent of infected persons and presents as\nendocarditis in patients with preexisting valvular disease. Pregnant\nwomen, immunosuppressed persons, and patients with a preexisting\nheart-valve defect are at greatest risk for chronic Q fever.\nDoxycycline is recommended for treatment of acute Q fever. _C.\nburnetii_ is highly infectious, persists in the environment, and can\ntravel for miles once windborne (3). Transmission can occur via\ninhalation of contaminated aerosols or dust; human-to-human\ntransmission is rare. Cattle, sheep, and goats are the primary Q fever\nreservoirs. Continued community awareness is essential for disease\nprevention and control. Additional information is available at\nhttp://www.cdc.gov/qfever.\n\nReferences\n--------\n1.

Can the\nbacteria cause seals and other marine mammals to get sick? Were\nvillagers ever exposed to it, and if so, did they become ill?\n\nThe infection, known as Q Fever, can cause a varying mix of flu-like\nsymptoms, including a high fever, according to the Centers for Disease\nControl.\n\nAlaska has documented only one case of the bacteria making an Alaskan\nsick, and that person picked it up overseas, according a bulletin\nissued 7 Sep [2011] by the Alaska Department of Epidemiology in\nresponse to findings by Colorado State University researchers. But\nthat doesn't mean there haven't been other cases, since Alaska didn't\nbegin to collect data on human _Coxiella_ infections until 2007.\n\n_Coxiella burnetti_ is more generally known to occur in land animals\nand birds. In Alaska, caribou, muskoxen, mountain goats, Dall sheep,\nwolves, and grizzly bears have been tested for the bacteria, with\ncaribou discovered as the largest carrier. Although the bacteria are\npresent among this wildlife, there is no evidence the bacteria has\nmade any of the wildlife sick, according to the bulletin. The CSU\nstudy, combined with recent occurrences of human illness in places\nlike the state of Washington, Greenland and the Netherlands, has the\nscience community taking a new look at the disease.\n\nThere is a long list of known facts about Q Fever. It's been around a\nlong time. It's found just about everywhere, including places you\nmight expect, like near animals, and those that might surprise you,\nlike schools, retail stores and banks. It's hard to kill. It travels\neasily on dust particles and is found in animal placentas, milk and\nfeces, and because it could feasibly be used in an aerosol to spray\nover a wide area, it's considered a potential bioterrorism agent, one\nthat won't kill people but which could debilitate large numbers of\nthem by making them sick.\n\nLouis Castrodale, an epidemiologist with the state of Alaska who\nhelped author the Q Fever bulletin, describes the bacteria as a\n'ubiquitous organism' that's found not just in animals but also in\noceans, sediments, and other places in the environment. Of interest is\nthat while it is present in a wide variety of places, the numbers of\npeople who get sick from it aren't huge, she said.\n\nData from the CDC illustrates how unusual the illness is in people in\nthe United States. The CDC has never received more than 200 reports of\nit in a given year. Yet common flu can strike between 5 to 20 percent\nof the U.S. population each year, anywhere from 15 to 62 million\npeople.\n\nHistorically, people have not routinely looked for _Coxiella burnetti_\nin marine mammals, which makes the current findings difficult to place\ninto context. Has the bacteria always been around in marine mammal\npopulations but just hasn't been noticed? Or, is it just starting to\naffect species that had previously been unexposed or unaffected? And,\ndoes it have the potential to make sea life or the humans that come\ninto contact with it sick? The answers aren't known.\n\nTo learn more, CSU has returned to the Pribilof Islands to study the\nbacteria's effect on fur seals in more depth. Scientists also want to\nfind out whether _Coxiella_ is present in Stellar sea lions, ice\nseals, walrus and other animals and birds from the area.\n\nPrevious blood samples collected from villagers of St. Paul and St.\nGeorge Islands in the 1980s and 1990s will also be tested for\n_Coxiella burnetti_ antibodies.\n\nUltimately, scientists want to know how widespread _Coxiella_ is among\nAlaska's marine life, how long it's been around, whether it's made\npeople sick in the past, and how to prevent it in the future.\n\n[Byline: Jill Burke <jill@alaskadispatch.com>]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[This is a fascinating observation.

Indeed, in\n[non-human] primates, the dose to kill 50 percent of the primates was\nfound to be 1.7 organisms (1).\n\nCattle, sheep, and goats are the primary reservoirs of _C. burnetii_.\nInfection has been noted in a wide variety of other animals, including\nother species of livestock and domesticated pets. _C. burnetii_ does\nnot usually cause clinical disease in these animals, although abortion\nin goats and sheep has been linked to _C. burnetii_ infection.\nOrganisms are excreted in milk, urine, and feces of infected animals.\nMost importantly, during birthing the organisms are shed in high\nnumbers within the amniotic fluids and the placenta. Contact with\ncontaminated wool is known to be a mode of transmission (2).\n\nThe organisms can be resistant to heat, drying, and many common\ndisinfectants. These features enable the bacteria to survive for long\nperiods in the environment. This very stable form of _C. burnetii_ is\nassociated with compact small-cell variants of the organism that are\nproduced during standard replication (along with the less resistant\nlarge-cell form) and are metabolically dormant and spore-like (3).\n\nThe Q fever organism is a category B bioterrorism agent and, in fact,\nalthough not thought to be related to bioterrorism, was spread by mail\nin a post office in the UK in 1987 (4).\n\nInfection of humans usually occurs by inhalation of these organisms\nfrom air that contains airborne barnyard dust contaminated by dried\nplacental material, birth fluids, and excreta of infected herd\nanimals.

To date, a total of around 40 people have been\ninfected, of which about half live in Arnsberg (HSK) and in the\ndistrict Waldeck-Frankenberg.\n\nThe results of previous studies indicate that the infection\noriginates from sheep flocks, where the causative agent of Q fever was\nconfirmed. The pathogen has been confirmed in several flocks of sheep\nfrom both 'Lander' (Hesse and North Rhine-Westphalia) and is\ntransmitted to humans via direct contact or contaminated dust.\n\nImmediately after the Arnsberg and the Waldeck-Frankenberg\nauthorities detected an increase of Q-fever infection in humans, the\ncompetent national authorities became involved. The municipalities and\nthe districts of North Rhine-Westphalia and Hesse, Hochsauerland and\nWaldeck-Frankenberg are working closely together. The veterinary\nauthorities have put restrictions upon the flocks of sheep shown to be\ninfected, have notified the owners and have imposed further protective\nmeasures. The sheep will be vaccinated to reduce the shedding of the\npathogen. This requires that the vaccine, which is not currently\nlicensed in Germany, is temporarily approved by the competent local\nauthorities.\n\nQ fever occurs worldwide and is a common bacterial infection mainly\ntransmitted by sheep, goats and cattle. Transmission takes place by\ninfectious dust or direct contact with the animals. Human-to-human\ntransmission is very unlikely.\n\nThe disease results in flu-like symptoms.

Current situation: the public health aspects\nSo far this year (as of 21 Jun 2010), 421 reports of Q-fever [Qf]\ncases in humans have been registered (compared to 1796 in 2009). We\nknow that 316 of them underwent the 1st day of illness during 2010.\nThe Clb registered 5 people who reportedly died due to Qf during 2010.\nQf deaths are not notifiable in the Netherlands, however reporting of\nchronic Qf infections and deaths at the LCI is necessary to get a good\noverview of any connection with Qf. A report form for this purpose can\nbe downloaded at the RIVM web-site.\n\n2. Current situation: the veterinary aspects\n91 farms have been reported as Qf contaminated (detected by the bulk\nmilk test) from December 2009 till 15 Jul 2010. In the 2 farms which\nhave been found positive during the current (July 2010) month, no\nanimals have been killed because none of the animals were pregnant\n[due to the breeding ban applied since Dec 2009]. Since all dairy goat\nand sheep farms in the Netherlands with more than 50 animals have been\nvaccinated, various veterinary requirements/measures could be\ndiscontinued.\n\n[The maintained but adjusted measures are described on the Min of\nAgriculture web-site. Since the application of bulk milk testing is\ncontinuing , contaminated farms are expected to be found but they are\nnot to be culled. Since all farms have been vaccinated, the discovery\nof a positive farm will not be followed by warning letters being sent\nto neighbouring households.

As of 2 Feb 2011, there were 8 more confirmed cases so\nfar in 2011.\n\nSince 2007, there have been more than 4000 cases and several deaths,\nincluding 11 deaths in 2010.\n\nThough the cases have been seen throughout the country, the US\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) notes that most of\nthese cases have been in Noord (North) Brabant, Gelderland, Limburg,\nand Utrecht Provinces in the southern part of the country. The CDC\noffers the following prevention recommendations for US travelers to\nthe Netherlands:\n- Avoid farms in the affected areas.\n- If you cannot avoid visiting farms, avoid going near areas where\nanimals are kept, such as barns and pens, and avoid direct contact\nwith animals.\n- Breathing in soil and dust contaminated by animals can make you\nsick.\n- Eat only milk and dairy products that have been pasteurized. Do not\ndrink raw milk or eat raw milk products.\n- Wash your hands often with soap and water, especially if you have\nbeen near animals. If soap and water are not available, use an\nalcohol-based hand gel with at least 60 percent alcohol.\n- Pay attention to your health after your trip. People can become\nsick with Q fever 2-5 weeks after being exposed to the disease. If you\nfeel sick, go to the doctor and tell him or her that you have traveled\nto The Netherlands.\n\nQ fever is caused by the obligate intracellular pathogen, _Coxiella\nburnetii_. The disease is usually transmitted to people through either\ninfected milk or through aerosols. This disease is found on most\ncontinents with the reported incidence probably much lower than the\nactual because so many cases are so mild. Animal reservoirs of _C.\nburnetii_ include sheep, cattle, goats, dogs and cats. In areas where\nthese animals are present, Q fever affects veterinarians, meatpacking\nworkers and farmers. Q fever is also considered a potential agent of\nbioterrorism.\n\nThe symptoms of Q fever according to the CDC are an unexplained\nfebrile illness, sometimes accompanied by pneumonia and/or hepatitis,\nthe most common clinical presentation. Illness onset typically occurs\nwithin 2-5 weeks after exposure. The mortality rate for acute Q fever\nis low (1-2 percent), and the majority of persons with mild illness\nrecover spontaneously within a few weeks, although antibiotic\ntreatment will shorten the duration of illness and lessen the risk of\ncomplications. Chronic Q fever is uncommon (less than one percent of\nacutely infected patients) but may cause life-threatening heart valve\ndisease (endocarditis).\n\n[Byline: Robert Herriman]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[2]\nDate: Sun 6 Feb 2011\nSource: IMED 2011, Vienna, Austria, 4-7 Feb 2011. Session 17 'Q Fever\nin the Netherlands,' abstract 17.001 [edited]\n\n\nQ fever in the Netherlands: The animal health aspects. By Christianne\nBruschke, CVO, Ministry of Economic Affairs, Agriculture and\nInnovation, The Hague, Netherlands\n\nUp to 2007, some 20 people became infected yearly with Q fever, a\nzoonotic disease. Suddenly in 2007, 170 people fell ill, and in 2008\nthere were 1000 cases. In 2009, there were more than 2300 known cases\nof people becoming infected. Experts believed that there was a\nrelationship between Q fever abortions on milking goat and milking\nsheep farms and the sharp increase in the numbers of human\ninfections.\n\nIn the Netherlands, several measures were taken between June 2008 and\nDecember 2009 to control Q-fever in animals. Measures were directed in\nparticular at the dairy goat and sheep sector, but measures were also\ntaken for small ruminants that come into close contact with the\ngeneral public. Q fever in sheep and goats was made notifiable in June\n2008. Hygiene measures, transport restrictions and restrictions for\nvisitors were implemented. Vaccination with a non-licensed vaccine was\nperformed in a restricted area in 2008 (voluntary) and 2009\n(compulsory).\n\nIn October 2009, monitoring based on bulk milk PCR was started to\ndetect infected farms. Knowing that the vaccine was not fully\nefficacious in infected or pregnant animals, and having the\npossibility to detect infected farms at the end of 2009, the\nresponsible ministers took the following decisions:\n1. cull all pregnant animals on infected farms\n2. a nationwide breeding ban for dairy sheep and goats\n3. a compulsory vaccination program for the whole country in 2010.\n\nWith these very drastic measures, further contamination of the\nenvironment during the lambing season would be prevented. Breeding\nwould be only allowed thereafter with animals coming from non-infected\nvaccinated farms.\n\nIn 2010, the number of human patients with Q-fever was 382. As of\nnow, the focus of the measures is to prevent another outbreak, with\nyearly vaccination of the dairy goat and sheep population.\n\n[Byline: C.

Oomen.\n\nBackground: From 2007 through 2009, The Netherlands faced a series of\nmultiple Q fever outbreaks in the southern part of the country. Q\nfever was specifically seen in the vicinity of dairy goat farms where\nabortion waves due to _Coxiella burnetii_ occurred.\n\nMethods and Materials: Seroprevalence of antibodies against _Coxiella\nburnetii_ was tested in 2006 in a random sample of the population\n(ELISA phase I and II). Hospital discharge data were used in\nretrospect to find previously undetected clusters in time and space.\nIncidence of acute Q fever was calculated using notification data.\nSmoothing incidence lines were calculated using 6 digit area codes. A\ncase control study was performed in 2007. A sample of blood donors\noriginating from the areas with highest incidence was tested twice in\n2009 with IFA. A sample of sera from the pregnancy screening (e.g.\nHBsAg, lues) was tested for antibodies against _Coxiella burnetii_.\n\nResults: In 2006, the seroprevalence of antibodies against _Coxiella\nburnetii_ in The Netherlands was low (less than 2.7 percent). Before\n2007, small clusters of lower respiratory tract infections went\nundetected. Incidence of Q fever increased from 192 in 2007, to 1000\nin 2008 and over 2300 in 2009. Risk for acute Q fever was increased\nfor males in age group 45-55 yrs and living in proximity of infected\ngoat farms, not living near infected sheep farms. In areas where blood\ndonor infection rate could be ascertained, only an estimated 12\npercent of infections are leading to microbiologically confirmed\ndisease. Preliminary data show no serious adverse events of infection\nduring pregnancy on pregnancy outcome.\n\nConclusion: The total number of reported acute Q fever cases\napproaches 4000. Living near infected dairy goat farms was the major\nrisk factor. The number of chronic infections with serious\ncomplications remains unknown.\n\n[Byline: J. Van Steenbergen, W. V. D. Hoek, D.

Session 17 'Q\nFever in the Netherlands,' abstract 17.003 [edited]\n\n\nQ fever in the Netherlands: _Coxiella burnetii_, laboratory aspects.\nBy: H.-J. Roest, Central Veterinary Institute of Wageningen, Lelystad,\nNetherlands\n\nBackground: _Coxiella burnetii_ is a Gram-negative intracellular\nbacterium, which belongs to the family of the Coxiellaceae and the\norder of the Legionellales. Two phases of the bacterium can be\ndistinguished: phase I, associated with full length lipopolysaccharide\n(LPS) and phase II, associated with truncated LPS. In the life cycle\nof _C. burnetii_, 2 stages can be distinguished. The Large Cell\nVariant (LCV), which is able to multiply, and the Small Cell Variant\n(SCV), the spore-like form in which _C. burnetii_ is resistant to\noutside influences.\n\nMethods and Materials: Genotyping was performed by MLVA [Multiple\nLoci Variable Number of Tandem Repeats Analysis].\n\nResults: The link between dairy goats as the source of human Q fever\ncases in the Netherlands has been made on the basis of epidemiological\nevidence. Genotyping of _C. burnetii_ is a tool to further investigate\nthe connection between source and host. Using MLVA, the connection\nbetween sheep and humans in a small Q fever outbreak in the\nNetherlands could be made. MLVA was also used to type a considerable\nnumber of goat samples from goats that were considered to be the\nsource of the Q fever outbreak in the Netherlands. Results show that\none MLVA type is predominantly present on all dairy goat farms in the\nepidemic area in the south of the Netherlands.\n\n_C. burnetii_ contaminated goat manure is considered to be a major\nfactor in the transmission to humans. Little is known about the\ntemperature build-up in goat manure piles and the influence of the\ncomposting process on _C. burnetii_. In a joint effort of national\nresearch institutes, temperatures and numbers of _C. burnetii_ in goat\nmanure and the decimal reduction time of _C. burnetii_ under these\nconditions were assessed. Results of this study [have been\npresented].\n\nConclusion: Results on genotyping show that one MLVA type is\npredominantly present on all dairy goat farms in the epidemic area in\nthe south of the Netherlands.

Experts believed that there was a\nrelationship between Q fever abortions on milking goat and milking\nsheep farms and the sharp increase in the numbers of human\ninfections. [Byline: C. Bruschke]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n In a joint effort of national\nresearch institutes, temperatures and numbers of _C. burnetii_ in goat\nmanure and the decimal reduction time of _C. burnetii_ under these\nconditions were assessed. Measures were directed in\nparticular at the dairy goat and sheep sector, but measures were also\ntaken for small ruminants that come into close contact with the\ngeneral public. By: H.-J. Roest, Central Veterinary Institute of Wageningen, Lelystad,\nNetherlands\n\nBackground: _Coxiella burnetii_ is a Gram-negative intracellular\nbacterium, which belongs to the family of the Coxiellaceae and the\norder of the Legionellales. In areas where blood\ndonor infection rate could be ascertained, only an estimated 12\npercent of infections are leading to microbiologically confirmed\ndisease. The CDC\noffers the following prevention recommendations for US travelers to\nthe Netherlands:\n- Avoid farms in the affected areas. \n- Breathing in soil and dust contaminated by animals can make you\nsick.\n Risk for acute Q fever was increased\nfor males in age group 45-55 yrs and living in proximity of infected\ngoat farms, not living near infected sheep farms. \n\nResults: The link between dairy goats as the source of human Q fever\ncases in the Netherlands has been made on the basis of epidemiological\nevidence. Bruschke, CVO, Ministry of Economic Affairs, Agriculture and\nInnovation, The Hague, Netherlands\n\nUp to 2007, some 20 people became infected yearly with Q fever, a\nzoonotic disease. \n\nConclusion: Results on genotyping show that one MLVA type is\npredominantly present on all dairy goat farms in the epidemic area in\nthe south of the Netherlands. Q\nfever was specifically seen in the vicinity of dairy goat farms where\nabortion waves due to _Coxiella burnetii_ occurred. \n\nMethods and Materials: Seroprevalence of antibodies against _Coxiella\nburnetii_ was tested in 2006 in a random sample of the population\n(ELISA phase I and II). MLVA was also used to type a considerable\nnumber of goat samples from goats that were considered to be the\nsource of the Q fever outbreak in the Netherlands. Chronic Q fever is uncommon (less than one percent of\nacutely infected patients) but may cause life-threatening heart valve\ndisease (endocarditis). If you cannot avoid visiting farms, avoid going near areas where\nanimals are kept, such as barns and pens, and avoid direct contact\nwith animals. Results show that\none MLVA type is predominantly present on all dairy goat farms in the\nepidemic area in the south of the Netherlands. As of\nnow, the focus of the measures is to prevent another outbreak, with\nyearly vaccination of the dairy goat and sheep population. In areas where\nthese animals are present, Q fever affects veterinarians, meatpacking\nworkers and farmers. Using MLVA, the connection\nbetween sheep and humans in a small Q fever outbreak in the\nNetherlands could be made. Breeding\nwould be only allowed thereafter with animals coming from non-infected\nvaccinated farms. Little is known about the\ntemperature build-up in goat manure piles and the influence of the\ncomposting process on _C. burnetii_. The symptoms of Q fever according to the CDC are an unexplained\nfebrile illness, sometimes accompanied by pneumonia and/or hepatitis,\nthe most common clinical presentation. [Byline: J. Van Steenbergen, W. V. D. Hoek, D. Notermans, C. Wijkmans\n& T. Oomen]\n\n--\n Though the cases have been seen throughout the country, the US\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) notes that most of\nthese cases have been in Noord (North) Vaccination with a non-licensed vaccine was\nperformed in a restricted area in 2008 (voluntary) and 2009\n This disease is found on most\ncontinents with the reported incidence probably much lower than the\nactual because so many cases are so mild. A sample of blood donors\noriginating from the areas with highest incidence was tested twice in\n2009 with IFA. Before\n2007, small clusters of lower respiratory tract infections went\nundetected. \n- Wash your hands often with soap and water, especially if you have\nbeen near animals. Two phases of the bacterium can be\ndistinguished: phase I, associated with full length lipopolysaccharide\n(LPS) and phase II, associated with truncated LPS. If you\nfeel sick, go to the doctor and tell him or her that you have traveled\nto The Netherlands.

The department says 2 Q\nfever cases were in Washtenaw County and one was in Monroe County.\n\nPeople can become ill with the bacteria if they inhale barnyard dust\nparticles contaminated by infected animals or consume raw milk. They\nsuffer flu like symptoms, including high fever, headaches, malaise,\nabdominal pain, chills, vomiting, and diarrhea. Left untreated,\nserious cases of Q fever can lead to chronic illness that may affect a\nperson's heart, liver, brain, and lungs and may be fatal.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[A detailed discussion on the transmission of _Coxiella burnetii_ is\nposted below.\n\nAfter an incubation period of several weeks, the infection (which can\nbe asymptomatic) generally presented with fever, a dry cough, and\njoint pains. Not uncommonly, the patient, diagnosed as having\npneumonia, is also found to have notable abnormalities in liver\nfunction. It is that combination that should make the astute clinician\nconcerned about the diagnosis especially in the setting of exposure to\nlivestock or living near farms where the livestock are raised. It is\nnot stated what symptoms were manifest in these cases or if the\nexposure to raw milk was ascertained before or after the diagnosis of\nQ fever was made.\n\nClassical zoonotic organisms such as _Brucella abortus_, _Brucella\nmelitensis_, _Mycobacterium bovis_, _Salmonella_ species, _Listeria\nmonocytogenes_, _Campylobacter_ species, _Yersinia_ species, _Coxiella\nburnetii_, and _E. coli_ O157:H7 are associated with raw milk\ningestion.\n\nNon-zoonotic organisms such as _Streptococcus pyogenes_, _Salmonella_\nTyphi, _Corynebacterium diphtheriae_, _Shigella_ species, _Salmonella_\nParatyphi A, _Salmonella_ Paratyphi B, enterotoxins from\n_Staphylococcus aureus_, and hepatitis A virus have also been\nassociated with raw milk ingestion.\n\nOther diseases that can be related to unpasteurized milk are\nhighlighted in these paragraphs extracted from Leedom JM: Milk and\ninfectious diseases in humans. Clin Infect Dis 2006; 43(5): 610-5\n(http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/507035) with the\ncitations renumbered to be consecutive starting from 1:\n\nIn 1996 and 1998, there were 2 episodes involving rabid cows that\noccurred in Massachusetts (1). Milk from rabid cows can contain rabies\nvirus, and transmission via unpasteurized milk is theoretically\npossible. Temperatures reached during pasteurization kill the virus.\n80 persons consumed unpasteurized milk that was collected from the 2\ncows, and 9 more had contact with saliva from the cows. All 89 persons\nreceived postexposure rabies prophylaxis, and no human cases of rabies\neventuated. A similar report in Oklahoma of possible rabies exposure\nassociated with the consumption of raw milk or cream from a rabid cow\nwas circulated in 2006 (2).\n\nTickborne encephalitis, a zoonotic arbovirus infection usually\ntransmitted to humans by the bite of an _Ixodes persulcatus_ or\n_Ixodes ricinus_ tick, is endemic to Central Europe, Eastern Europe,\nand Russia (3). However, the virus can be found in the milk of cows\nand goats with tickborne encephalitis and was reported to be\ntransmissible to humans by the consumption of unpasteurized milk (4).\nA case-control study failed to confirm oral transmission (5).\n\nA diarrhea syndrome (later named Brainerd diarrhea) occurred among\n122 residents of Brainerd, Minnesota, during the period December\n1983-July 1984 (6). It was characterized by acute onset, marked\nurgency, lack of systemic symptoms, failure to respond to conventional\nantimicrobial agents, and a long median duration of illness (median\nduration, 16.5 months). The syndrome was linked to consumption of raw\nmilk from a single dairy (6). No etiologic agent was ever isolated.\nThe outbreak of Brainerd diarrhea stopped when all of the dairy's\noutput was diverted and pasteurized (6, MT Osterholm, personal\ncommunication).\n\nSubsequent outbreaks in Illinois and Texas were not directly\nassociated with milk, although cattle had been in the vicinity of an\nIllinois well that had its water implicated as a vehicle of\ntransmission (7). Another outbreak of Brainerd-like diarrhea, although\nnot associated with raw milk, affected 58 (15 per cent) of 394\npassengers aboard a cruise ship visiting the Galapagos Islands in\nEcuador (8).\n\nReferences\n----------\n1.

It was called 'Query\nfever' because the causative agent was initially unknown. _Coxiella\nburnetii_, the causative agent, was discovered in 1937. This organism\nis an agent that can be resistant to heat and desiccation and highly\ninfectious by the aerosol route. A single inhaled organism may produce\nclinical illness. Indeed, in [non-human] primates, the dose to kill 50\nper cent of the primates was found to be 1.7 organisms (1).\n\nCattle, sheep, and goats are the primary reservoirs of _C. burnetii_.\nInfection has been noted in a wide variety of other animals, including\nother species of livestock and domesticated pets. _C. burnetii_ does\nnot usually cause clinical disease in these animals, although abortion\nin goats and sheep has been linked to _C. burnetii_ infection.\nOrganisms are excreted in milk, urine, and feces of infected animals.\nMost importantly, during birthing the organisms are shed in high\nnumbers within the amniotic fluids and the placenta. Contact with\ncontaminated wool is known to be a mode of transmission (2).\n\nThe organisms can be resistant to heat, drying, and many common\ndisinfectants. These features enable the bacteria to survive for long\nperiods in the environment. This very stable form of _C. burnetii_ is\nassociated with compact small-cell variants of the organism that are\nproduced during standard replication (along with the less resistant\nlarge-cell form) and are metabolically dormant and spore-like (3).\n\nThe Q fever organism is a category B bioterrorism agent and, in fact,\nalthough not thought to be related to bioterrorism, was spread by mail\nin a post office in the UK in 1987 (4).\n\nInfection of humans usually occurs by inhalation of these organisms\nfrom air that contains airborne barnyard dust contaminated by dried\nplacental material, birth fluids, and excreta of infected herd\nanimals. Humans are often very susceptible to the disease, and very\nfew organisms may be required to cause infection.\n\nIngestion of contaminated milk, followed by regurgitation and\ninspiration of the contaminated food, is a less common mode of\ntransmission. Instances of other modes of transmission to humans,\nincluding tick bites and human to human transmission, are rare.\n\nAn earlier outbreak of infection in 51 people in Scotland, UK, was\ntied to a meat processing plant and appeared to spread via aerosol for\nat least 0.5 mi (0.8 km).\n\nReferences\n----------\n1.

Milk from rabid cows can contain rabies\nvirus, and transmission via unpasteurized milk is theoretically\npossible. \n\nIngestion of contaminated milk, followed by regurgitation and\ninspiration of the contaminated food, is a less common mode of\ntransmission. \n\nGoats from the farms have been traced to 9 other Washington counties\nand to Cascade and Teton counties in Montana, where 6 more people have\nbeen stricken with suspected Q fever, the newspaper said. A similar report in Oklahoma of possible rabies exposure\nassociated with the consumption of raw milk or cream from a rabid cow\nwas circulated in 2006 (2). \n\nAn earlier outbreak of infection in 51 people in Scotland, UK, was\ntied to a meat processing plant and appeared to spread via aerosol for\nat least 0.5 mi (0.8 km). \n\nSubsequent outbreaks in Illinois and Texas were not directly\nassociated with milk, although cattle had been in the vicinity of an\n An outbreak of a\nnewly recognized chronic diarrhea syndrome associated with raw milk\nproduction. \n80 persons consumed unpasteurized milk that was collected from the 2\ncows, and 9 more had contact with saliva from the cows.

ECDC\ndeveloped this risk assessment at the request of the European\nCommission, which was initiated due to the high number of Q fever\ncases observed in the Netherlands over the last couple of years. The\naim of the risk assessment is to clarify the implications for public\nhealth.\n\nQ fever, caused by the bacterium _Coxiella burnetii_, often develops\nas outbreaks, mainly in the vicinity of sheep or goat farming\nactivities. The bacteria is transmitted from animals to humans by\nairborne transmission and can cause an acute form of flu-like\ndisease, which is usually self-limited.\n\nIf the acute disease is not treated, Q fever occasionally evolves\ninto a more serious chronic disease, especially among people with\nunderlying health conditions, such as heart valve disease, vessel\ngrafts, cancer, or compromised immune system, and it can be fatal\nwithout treatment.\n\nJohan Giesecke, Chief Scientist at ECDC says; 'The main conclusion of\nthe report is that chronic Q fever can be a serious disease. Since\nthe acute infection can be mild and unspecific, it is easily\noverlooked, both by the patient and by the physician, and the\nevidence suggests that chronic Q fever is often under diagnosed and\nunderreported.'\n\nThe management of Q-fever is the responsibility of national\nauthorities, and the report aims to provide an additional assessment\nof the best available evidence and suggests possible interventions to\nprevent and control Q fever. ECDC Chief Scientist, Johan Giesecke\nadds: 'Early detection and correct treatment for both acute and\nchronic infection is essential, and health authorities must work\ntogether with veterinary authorities at a national and a local level\nto be able to take necessary actions to stop an outbreak.'\n\nThe report states that preventing and controlling the acute form of Q\nfever can be addressed by various strategies such as public awareness\ncampaigns to make patients and doctors more observant of mild or\nunspecific symptoms, measures to limit Q fever bacteria in the\nenvironment and to limit contact with possibly infected animals.\n\nThe present outbreak seems largely limited to the southern parts of\nthe Netherlands, but since the bacteria can spread over considerable\ndistances, the risk in neighbouring countries cannot be neglected.\n\nThe ECDC risk assessment has been developed in close collaboration\nwith the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to provide\ndecision-makers with integrated European-level advice on Q fever\ncovering both human and animal health, as well as the transmission of\nthe disease from animals to humans.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nSabine Zentis\nGut Laach\n52385 Nideggen, Germany\n<CVLonghorns@aol.com>\n\n[The full report (46 pages) is available at\n<http://ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications/Publications/1005_TER_Risk_Assessment_Qfever.pdf>.\nThe following is a segment from the Executive summary:\n\n'Chronic Q fever is a serious complication of an acute Q fever\ninfection that develops in some 2 percent of acute symptomatic cases,\nand the fatality rate may vary from 5 percent to 50 percent. Chronic\nQ fever causes endocarditis in risk groups like people with previous\nheart valve disease, a prosthetic valve or vascular graft. Patients\nwith cancer or those who are immunosuppressed are also at a higher\nrisk. Chronic Q fever must be treated for at least one year, in some\ncases for the lifetime with more than one antibiotic. Surgical\nreplacement of damaged heart valves might be needed.\n\nEffective detection of, and treatment for, acute Q fever is the best\nstrategy for avoiding chronic cases. Three possible strategies are\ndescribed: (1) awareness raising among healthcare staff and the\npublic to address the risk groups; (2) active follow-up with serology\nfor known risk groups to detect and treat an acute Q fever infection\nearly; or (3) refer all known acute Q fever patients to\nechocardiography for active case finding and follow-up.\n\nThere is a need to initiate good prospective cohort studies and\ncontrolled trials (when ethically feasible) to obtain more robust\nevidence on how to prevent and inhibit outbreaks of Q fever in the\npublic health field, and on how to diagnose and treat acute and\nchronic disease at the clinical level.\n\nEvidence on Q fever in pregnancy is very limited and comes mainly\nfrom observations and research in domestic and experimental animals,\nseroprevalence studies, case reports, and one case series including\n53 pregnant women over a 15-year period. The risk for pregnant women\nof severe Q fever outcomes compared with the risk for the general\n(female) population cannot be quantified based on currently available\nevidence. Several cases of _Coxiella burnetii_ infection during\npregnancy resulting in adverse pregnancy outcomes have been reported.\nIn some of the cases _C. burnetii_ was found in the placenta and in\nfetal tissue. _Coxiella_ has also been identified in human breast\nmilk, but no case of transmission to the breastfed child has been\nvalidated.\n\nThere is some indication that long-term antibiotic therapy with\ncotrimoxazole has the potential to prevent severe pregnancy outcomes,\nbut the evidence is based on a case series without randomisation and\nwithout controlling for potential biases. As long as no further\nevidence from high quality treatment studies is available, pregnant\nwomen with diagnosed Q fever infection should be treated with\nantibiotics throughout the remaining pregnancy. However, the\nscientific basis for this recommendation is weak, and ECDC would\nstrongly recommend that randomised controlled trials are performed to\nobtain more reliable evidence.\n\nPregnant women should be advised not to visit farms in affected\nareas. ECDC does not recommend against breastfeeding except in cases\nof chronic disease that need long-term treatment of the mother.\n\nA formaline-inactivated whole-cell Q fever vaccine is produced and\nlicensed in Australia. The vaccine is effective, but pre-vaccination\ntesting is necessary due to high reactogenicity in persons who have\nearlier been infected with _C. burnetii_, making the vaccine more\nsuitable for defined risk groups than for general vaccination.\nAvailable evidence suggests an effective range of airborne spread of\n_C. burnetii_ of less than 5 km. The risk of airborne spread from the\nNetherlands is therefore limited to neighbouring countries (i.e.\nGermany, Belgium), and to areas close to outbreak sources. Active\nsurveillance or case finding for acute Q fever in possible risk\ngroups (i.e. pregnant women, patients with heart valve or vascular\ndiseases) on a local level and for a defined period of time is\nreported feasible and an efficient method for detecting acute\ninfections. In areas adjacent to epidemic settings (0.5 km from the\nsource), awareness campaigns among healthcare providers should be\ninitiated. If the area also affects other Member States, the\nresponsible public health authorities need to inform their\ncross-border counterparts. Sharing of information between public\nhealth and veterinary authorities would facilitate an early\nrecognition of an outbreak. Further, the health and veterinary\nauthorities at national and local levels should take the necessary\naction to stop an outbreak.' - Mod.AS]", "summary": "Three possible strategies are\ndescribed: (1) awareness raising among healthcare staff and the\npublic to address the risk groups; (2) active follow-up with serology\nfor known risk groups to detect and treat an acute Q fever infection\nearly; or (3) refer all known acute Q fever patients to\nechocardiography for active case finding and follow-up.

The ECDC risk assessment has been developed in close collaboration\nwith the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to provide\ndecision-makers with integrated European-level advice on Q fever\ncovering both human and animal health, as well as the transmission of\nthe disease from animals to humans.

The opinion addresses the significance of Q fever in\nanimals and humans, different risk factors involved in the occurrence\nand spread of the disease, and the effectiveness of possible control\nmeasures at the EU level.\n\nEFSA's advice states that infection with _Coxiella burnetii_, the\nbacterium which causes Q fever, is widespread in cattle, sheep, and\ngoats in the EU. Several factors can affect the spread of the\ninfection between these animals, but the overall impact on their\nhealth is limited as they rarely develop the disease itself. When it\noccurs, notably in sheep and goats, it may cause reproductive\ndisorders, including abortion. The opinion suggests that a combination\nof measures could be used to control Q fever in the long-term and\nshort-term, with preventive vaccination of animals considered to be\nthe most effective long-term option.\n\nThe available information indicates that Q fever also has a limited\nimpact on public health, although it can be significant for some risk\ngroups. Humans generally become infected through air-borne\ntransmission of the bacterium. There is no evidence that people can\nbecome ill by consuming contaminated milk or meat.\n\nThe Chair of EFSA's expert Panel on Animal Health and Welfare,\nPhilippe Vannier, said: 'Cooperation across animal and public health\ndisciplines is key in addressing the risks and challenges posed by a\ndisease such as Q fever. EFSA has therefore worked in close\ncollaboration with the European Centre for Disease Prevention and\nControl to provide decision-makers with integrated European-level\nadvice on Q fever covering both human and animal health, as well as\nthe transmission of the disease from animals to humans.\n\n'We need early exchange of information between veterinarians and human\nhealth practitioners to better identify the origin of outbreaks in\nhumans and to implement preventive measures when possible.\nImportantly, we need to all speak the same language and record data in\nthe same way. Harmonisation of data collection is critical in order to\ndefine a more accurate picture of the situation in Europe and how it\nis evolving over time.'\n\nInfection with _C. burnetii_ can be present in a wide range of\ndifferent farming systems. A number of factors -- including proximity\nto sheep and goats (especially when giving birth) and dry, windy\nweather -- can affect the risk of human infection. However, there is\nconsiderable uncertainty about the relative importance of these risk\nfactors, and it is likely that there is often more than one factor\ninvolved. No clear link was demonstrated between the spillover of\ninfection from farms to humans and either the size of the farms\ninvolved or the virulence of different strains of infection.\n\nThe opinion identified a number of measures which could be used to\ncontrol _C. burnetii_ infection in sheep and goats, but stressed that\na combination of measures may be needed to deal with both farm-based\nand environmental routes of infection. Some options, including the\nculling of pregnant animals, were not considered suitable for\nlong-term control but may have a role in the face of an outbreak.\nAntibiotic treatment of infected animals was not recommended.\n\nThe EFSA opinion included a number of recommendations, including the\nharmonisation of data collection on Q fever in animals so as to enable\ncomparisons over time and between countries. It also stressed the\nimportance of the rapid identification and reporting of Q fever cases\nin animals, as well as the early exchange of information between\nveterinarians and public health practitioners.\n\nEFSA has also published today [12 May 2010] a separate report which\nincludes proposals for the development of a harmonised monitoring and\nreporting scheme for Q fever in animals in the EU Member States and\nwhich was referred to extensively in the EFSA opinion.

Extent of the problem\n------------------------\nThe Netherlands is facing a Q fever problem that is still increasing\nin size since the last report in this journal [Eurosurveillance,\nVolume 14, Issue 19, 14 May 2009\n<http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=19210>].\n\nIn 2009, a total of 2357 new Q fever patients were registered in the\nnational infectious disease notification database. These patients\nfulfilled the case notification criteria of fever, pneumonia, or\nhepatitis, combined with a positive laboratory result. Q fever\ninfection is asymptomatic in 60 percent of cases and if symptomatic\noften presents as influenza-like illness. Increasing awareness among\npatients and doctors will likely result in detection of more\nrelatively mild cases.\n\nHowever, the proportion of notified patients that had to be admitted\nto a hospital seems to have stabilised around 20 percent, after a\ndecline from 2007 to 2008 (For the table, go to the full text at the\nabove URL). The high percentage of 50 percent in 2007 was largely\ninfluenced by active case finding in a retrospective survey among\nhospitalised cases. The 19.7 percent of 2009 are still much higher\nthan the 2-5 percent hospitalisation that are reported in the\nliterature.\n\nIn the 1st 10 weeks of 2010 a considerable number of cases has\nalready been notified, which, based on experiences of preceding years\nand taking into account the drastic measures taken, was not expected\nat this time of year (figure 1 at the above URL). The intensified\nmedia attention in late 2009 and early 2010 might have caused an\nincrease in the number of consultations. Improved laboratory capacity\nwill also have influenced the number of notified cases and quality of\nthe notified data. As can be seen in the epidemiological curve of\n2007 there is a more or less scattered pattern due to delayed\nnotifications. From 2009 onwards, routine PCR is included in the\ndiagnostic workup of acute Q fever, which can accelerate diagnosis.\nHowever, PCR is only positive in early Q fever.\n\nThe high background of notified cases in the winter of 2009-10 may be\na reflection of high seroprevalence among the affected population,\ndue to persisting antibodies, both IgG and IgM phase II, used to\ndiagnose acute Q-fever. This, combined with non-specific clinical\nsymptoms of Q fever, makes it difficult to differentiate between\nacute and past Q fever infections, and thus makes notifications less\naccurate.\n\nIn 2009, 6 deaths were reported, all in patients with other\nunderlying medical conditions. The median age of the patients was 49\n(interquartile range (IQR):38-59), and 61 percent were male. In 2008,\nthe median age was 50 years (IQR: 41-59), with 64 percent male cases.\n\nGeographically, the epidemic affected an area that was larger than in\nthe preceding years. A large new cluster was observed in Limburg, the\nsouthernmost province of the Netherlands, near a Q fever-affected\ndairy goat farm. There is consensus among public health and\nveterinary professionals that most of the human Q fever cases are\nlinked to abortion waves on large dairy goat farms, and to a much\nlesser extent on dairy sheep farms. Consequently, interventions have\nfocused on these types of farms. However, there are indications that\ndirect contact with non-dairy sheep has also caused a limited number\nof human cases: at least 28 among patients and staff of a mental\nhealth institution and possibly up to 46 among 12 000 people who\nvisited a sheep farm during the lambing season in February and March\n2009.\n\n2. Control measures\n-------------------\nIn February 2009, a nationwide hygiene protocol became mandatory for\nprofessional dairy goat and dairy sheep farms. Between April and\nNovember 2009, approximately 250 000 small ruminants were mandatorily\nvaccinated, including those on farms in the high incidence area in\nthe south of the country (Figure 2 at the above URL), farms with a\nrecent history of Q fever, and farms offering recreational\nactivities. Veterinarians, physicians and the public were informed\nthrough targeted mailings, publications and the media. On 1 Oct 2009,\nbulk milk monitoring became mandatory on farms with more than 50\ndairy goats or dairy sheep, and PCR positive bulk milk has since been\nused as an additional criterion for veterinary notification of Q\nfever.\n\nThe initial frequency of testing each farm every other month has been\nincreased to once every 2 weeks as of 14 Dec 2009. By 18 Feb 2010, 74\ndairy goat farms and 2 dairy sheep farms, out of the total of 360\ndairy goat farms and 40 dairy sheep farms with more than 50 animals\nin the Netherlands, had been declared Q fever-infected based on\nPCR-positive bulk milk testing. The number of positive farms is\nexpected to increase further towards the peak of the lambing season\n(March-April). [As of 18 Apr 2010, the total number of positive farms\nhas increased by 7, becoming 83, of which 81 dairy goats (22.5\npercent of 360) and 2 dairy sheep (5 percent). - Mod.AS]\n\nIn retrospect, a large human cluster in an urban area in 2008 could\nclearly be linked to a dairy goat farm (with over 400 animals) with a\nQ fever related abortion wave a few weeks before the first human\ncases presented. People living within 2 km of the farm had a much\nhigher risk for Q fever than those living more than 5 km away\n(relative risk 31.1; 95 percent confidence interval (CI): 16.4-59.1).\nBased on this study, a public information campaign has been targeted\nto zones of increased risk around affected farms. When a dairy goat\nor dairy sheep farm tests positive for _Coxiella burnetii_ in a bulk\nmilk sample for the 1st time, all inhabitants living within a radius\nof 5 km of the farm receive a letter informing them on the presence\nof a Q fever-positive farm in their proximity.\n\nThe letter gives no specific advice, but allows people with known\nrisk factors to avoid the farm. [See commentary below]. The list of\npositive farms is updated daily and is available to the public on the\nwebsite of the Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority [Go to the\nweb-site\n<http://www.vwa.nl/onderwerpen/dierziekten/dossier/4833780/q-koorts_kaart-met-overzicht-van-besmette-bedrijven>;\nfor the map, click on 'Kaart overzicht besmettingen Q-koorts'; for\nthe listed positive farms, on 'Adres locaties besmette bedrijven\nQ-koorts'].\n\nIn 2009, 59 percent of the notified human Q fever cases lived within\na radius of 5 km of an infected dairy goat or dairy sheep farm, while\nonly 12 percent of the Dutch population live within these zones. The\nincidence of Q fever in 2009 was 69 per 100 000 population within,\nand 6 per 100 000 outside the 5 km-areas.\n\nScreening of pregnant women\n---------------------------\nInternational literature suggests that a Q fever infection during\npregnancy may lead to adverse pregnancy outcome in a large percentage\nof cases. However, in a recently completed retrospective study in the\nhigh incidence area in the Netherlands, the presence of antibodies\nagainst _C. burnetii_ in early pregnancy was not significantly\nassociated with preterm delivery, low birth weight, or perinatal\nmortality (van der Hoek et al., unpublished data). A large-scale\nprospective screening and treatment study coordinated by the\nUniversity Medical Centre Groningen, was started in March 2010, aimed\nat providing more conclusive data on the need to screen pregnant\nwomen in high incidence areas.\n\nScreening of blood donors\n-------------------------\nThere is a theoretical risk for transmission of _C. burnetii_ through\nblood transfusion. Preliminary results indicate that in 2009, _C.\nburnetii_ DNA was detected in a small minority of blood donations in\nthe affected area. The risk of infection is probably negligible, but\nas a precautionary measure, Sanquin Blood Supply Foundation, the\norganisation responsible for all blood products in the Netherlands,\nstarted screening donated blood for _C. burnetii_ in the\nhigh-incidence area of the country on 15 March 2010.\n\nExpectations for 2010\n---------------------\nThe veterinary interventions, especially vaccination, animal movement\nrestrictions, culling and hygiene measures, are expected to have an\nimpact in 2010 and 2011. However, the resilience of _C. burnetii_ in\nthe environment and the possible role of animal species other than\nsmall ruminants make a prediction difficult but could potentially\nlead to incidence levels not much lower or even higher than those\nobserved in 2009. If spores persist in stables even after removing\nall animals or if environmental contamination and different animal\nreservoirs turn out to become relatively more important for\ntransmission to humans, the striking seasonal pattern of the years\n2007-2009 may be altered, possibly resulting in a more erratic\ntransmission pattern over time. So far, there are no signs that the Q\nfever problem is spreading to neighbouring countries. It could be\nthat factors such as lower population density, lower animal density,\nand different animal production methods in Belgium and G!\nermany, compared to the Netherlands, play a role.\n\nResearch agenda\n---------------\nTo fill the many knowledge gaps regarding Q fever, there is a large\ninterdisciplinary research agenda in the Netherlands focusing on\nhuman and veterinary public health and individual patient care.\nFurther elucidating the source and transmission routes will to a\nlarge extent depend on advances in molecular biology.\n\nConclusive matching of the bacteria that are found in animals with\nhuman and environmental samples has not yet been successful.\nObtaining _C. burnetii_ DNA is difficult, except from placenta\nmaterial of infected goats and sheep. Typing by multiple-locus\nvariable number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA) has been used on a\nlimited scale in human and veterinary samples and indicated\nsimilarity in strains isolated from a small sheep herd with strains\nfrom the human cluster in the mental health institution in May 2008.\n\nHowever, while various different MLVA types were identified, research\nby the Central Veterinary Institute in Lelystad shows that one MLVA\ntype prevails on many dairy goat farms in the high risk area in the\nsouthern part of the Netherlands, possibly indicating clonal spread\nin this area. This hampers tracing the source of human Q fever in the\nhigh-risk area to a specific farm. In a newly started project, whole\ngenome sequencing will be used to be able to distinguish between\nCoxiella bacteria from different sources.\n\nDiscussion\n----------\nQ fever is now considered a major public health problem in the\nNetherlands and has recently led to drastic measures, including the\nlarge-scale culling of pregnant goats and sheep. Despite the\nstrictest veterinary measures possible, Q fever is expected to remain\na significant problem over the coming years. The control measures are\naimed at stabilising the number of human cases in 2010, while the\nsustained compulsory vaccination campaign in small ruminants which is\nimplemented in 2010 nationwide for target farms, is expected to\neventually cause a drop in human cases in 2011 and subsequent years.\n\n[Byline: W van der Hoek , F Dijkstra, B Schimmer, P M Schneeberger, P\nVellema, C Wijkmans4, R ter Schegget, V Hackert, Y van Duynhoven]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[2]\nDate: 18 Apr 2010\nSource: Web-site of Dutch Ministry of Agriculture (trans. by sender,\nabridged and edited]\n<http://www.minlnv.nl/portal/page?_pageid=116,1640336&_dad=portal&_schema=PORTAL&p_subject=&p_month=0&p_year=0&p_submit=&p_page=3>\n\nOn Wed, 7 Apr 2010, the Minister of Agriculture answered a list of\nquestions from Members of Parliament (MPs). Selected items and\nadditional information, derived from the web-site of the Ministry of\nAgriculture, are included in the following report.\n\n1. The 'van Dijk Q fever Evaluation Commission' report, addressing\nthe Dutch Q-fever epidemic and its handling, will be presented in\nSeptember 2010. Initially, the report was due before summer 2010; see\n20100112.0144.\n\n2. Female goats/sheep, not culled in positive holdings since they\nwere not pregnant, are liable to life-long breeding ban. The minister\nhas appealed to non-contaminated farms to increase their available\ncrop of female animals for breeding, needed for the re-population of\naffected farms.\n\n3. There are indications that vegetation, moist soil conditions and\nfarm management contribute to increased infection rate of humans and\nanimals. Research is still ongoing.\n\n4. There is no clarity as yet if specific _C. burnetii_ strains are\nresponsible for the Dutch Q fever epidemic. So far, 14 different\nbacterium types have been identified.\n\n5. Farms that have been negative for a year are no direct risk to\npublic health. However, the risk for public health around a farm that\nwas contaminated and then (after a year) declared disease-free, is\nnot totally absent since the bacterium may still persist in the\nenvironment. There is not yet a risk profile for the environment\naround a previously contaminated farm.\n\n6. About 80 percent of the goat-holders and their family members have\nbeen found infected. The infection rate with the general Dutch\npopulation is 2.4 percent. These are the preliminary results of 2\nstudies. These data are not surprising; the disease is known to be\npresent in the Netherlands since the late 1950's, though on a\nlow-endemic level in the general public.\n\n7. There are no data of how many animals that were vaccinated in 2008\nand 2009 are still on the farms; therefore, it is not known yet how\nmany animals will need the booster vaccination this year.\n\n8. As of now [7 Apr 2010], 225 000 vaccine doses have been delivered\nto veterinary practices for application this year.\n\n9. The expert advisory group will reconvene end May to decide upon\npossible mitigation of the breeding ban and the introduction of\nbreeding animals to flocks.\n\n10. Advice on the possible use of a human Q fever vaccine, for groups\nat risk, is expected before summer 2010 from the Public Health\nCouncil. The Australian vaccine is the only existing vaccine and used\nonly for workers in the industry. Therefore there is no experience\nwith vaccinating people with specific health risks.\n\n11. The veterinary vaccine is being tested for efficiency at the EMA\n[the European Medicines Agency, formerly known as EMEA]. Furthermore,\nthe GD [Animal Health Service] has tested the vaccine and concluded\nthat the chance of infection has been reduced in view of most animals\nbeen vaccinated, abortions almost completely eliminated and excretion\nof the bacterium considerably reduced. More information will be\navailable in due course.\n\n12. Based on these data, the experts believe that in the absence of\nresearch findings indicative of possible new deleterious\ndevelopments, there are sufficient indications to stop the breeding\nand supplying ban, to stop culling and to reduce the frequency of\nbulk milk testing.\n\n13. There is a difference in Q-fever control measures required for\ndairy farms in comparison to mutton farms. The reason is that there\nare no indications that non-dairy farms have caused human infections.\nThe physiological reasons have not been sufficiently investigated but\ncould be related to differences in hormone and energy factors.\n\n14. With 3 studies into the effect of antibiotics on Q-fever, there\nare no indications that their application will reduce abortion or\nagent's excretion. There is however the risk of developed resistance\nagainst the antibiotic, as studies have shown.\n\n15. There has been some commotion around vaccination these past days.\nFarmers have become reluctant to vaccinate, related to rumors that\nthe vaccine could cause positive bulk milk tests with subsequent\ncullings. Based on a limited test (by the Jeroen Bosch Hospital on 6\nanimals) it appears that after vaccination some DNA from _C.\nburnetii_ shows in milk samples during the first 9 post-vaccination\ndays. There was no indication that farms have been erroneously\nculled. However, this was a limited test and therefore the CVI and\nRIVM have been asked by the ministers to further investigate this\nissue on a larger scale. We hope that this research by the CVI and\nRIVM will either give more clarity.\n\nIn addition: before a farm is declared positive, 3 samples must all\nhave a positive result:\n1- testing by the GD (Animal Health service)\n2- confirmation of the same sample by the CVI (Central Veterinarian Institute)\n3- the sampling by the VWA (Food Safety Authority)\n\nThe time lapse between the 3 tests (in particular Nos 1 and 3) has\nalways been more than 9 days (excluding tests of animals vaccinated 2\nmonths before sampling).\n\n16. A study on cows in France showed that they became Q-fever free\nafter 4 years of vaccinations. It is too early to state the same\neffectivity for the Netherlands, because the different circumstances.\nThe minister expects a much sooner (than 4 years) effect of\nvaccination in Dutch small ruminants, because of the strict measures\ntaken in the Netherlands.\n\n17. The regulations for storing and dispersing manure from Q-fever\ncontaminated farms have been adjusted. Contaminated farms are obliged\nto keep the manure, covered, at the farm and until at least 1 Jun\n2010. The regulations for not-contaminated farms have not been\nchanged: they may disperse the manure, when stored under coverage for\n90 days on the farm.\n\n18. Ministers Verburg (LNV/Agriculture) en Klink (VWS/Public health)\nhave decided to adjust the manure regulations for contaminated farms\nin order to limit the risk of spreading the Q-fever bacterium,\npotentially affecting public health.\n\n19. To eliminate the Q-fever bacterium in manure, dairy goat and\nsheep farmers with more than 50 animals must store and cover the\nmanure, facilitating the composting process. Due to this process the\ntemperature inside the covered heap rises, and the bacterium\neliminated. In contaminated premises, the period of manure storage\nhas been prolonged to 150 days.\n\n20. Other regulations have changed as well. One of them addressed the\ndiscontinued obligation to isolate parturient sheep or goats in dairy\ngoat and sheep farms, with more than 50 animals and with a public\nfunction. This is decided because these farms have to participate in\nthe fortnightly bulk milk testing procedure. However, these farms may\nallow visitors only after timely and full vaccination.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nChristine Bijl\nEuropean Livestock Association (ELA) Secretary\n<Christinebijl@gmail.com>\n<christinebijl@planet.nl>\n\n[The number of Dutch citizens, living within a radius of 5 km of\npositive farms, to whom a letter informing on the presence of a Q\nfever-positive farm in their proximity has been sent, as updated by\nthe Ministers on 7 Apr 2010, is one million (the total population of\nthe Netherlands is 16.5 million).\n\nThe ministers have provided also some financial data related to the Q\nfever event.

There is consensus among public health and\nveterinary professionals that most of the human Q fever cases are\nlinked to abortion waves on large dairy goat farms, and to a much\nlesser extent on dairy sheep farms. AS]\n\nIn retrospect, a large human cluster in an urban area in 2008 could\nclearly be linked to a dairy goat farm (with over 400 animals) with a\nQ fever related abortion wave a few weeks before the first human\ncases presented.

The high background of notified cases in the winter of 2009-10 may be\na reflection of high seroprevalence among the affected population,\ndue to persisting antibodies, both IgG and IgM phase II, used to\ndiagnose acute Q-fever. The minister\nhas appealed to non-contaminated farms to increase their available\ncrop of female animals for breeding, needed for the re-population of\naffected farms. This, combined with non-specific clinical\nsymptoms of Q fever, makes it difficult to differentiate between\nacute and past Q fever infections, and thus makes notifications less\naccurate. In the 1st 10 weeks of 2010 a considerable number of cases has\nalready been notified, which, based on experiences of preceding years\nand taking into account the drastic measures taken, was not expected\nat this time of year (figure 1 at the above URL).

The 'van Dijk Q fever Evaluation Commission' report, addressing\nthe Dutch Q-fever epidemic and its handling, will be presented in\nSeptember 2010. There are no data of how many animals that were vaccinated in 2008\nand 2009 are still on the farms; therefore, it is not known yet how\nmany animals will need the booster vaccination this year. To fill the many knowledge gaps regarding Q fever, there is a large\ninterdisciplinary research agenda in the Netherlands focusing on\nhuman and veterinary public health and individual patient care. The\nincidence of Q fever in 2009 was 69 per 100 000 population within,\nand 6 per 100 000 outside the 5 km-areas. Contaminated farms are obliged\nto keep the manure, covered, at the farm and until at least 1 Jun\n2010.

Despite the\nstrictest veterinary measures possible, Q fever is expected to remain\na significant problem over the coming years. Q fever\ninfection is asymptomatic in 60 percent of cases and if symptomatic\noften presents as influenza-like illness. The regulations for not-contaminated farms have not been\nchanged: they may disperse the manure, when stored under coverage for\n90 days on the farm. Increasing awareness among\npatients and doctors will likely result in detection of more\nrelatively mild cases.\n\n These patients\nfulfilled the case notification criteria of fever, pneumonia, or\nhepatitis, combined with a positive laboratory result.

Also, the 1st results have been presented of\nthe research into the temperature course of [collected] manure.\n\nFrom the scientific literature we know that during abortion of an\ninfected small ruminant billions of bacteria are shed in the\nenvironment; during normal partus of an infected small ruminant the\nshedding is considerably less, in the range of millions of bacteria.\nFrom the limited data of the field study done by GD and CVI and from\nthe literature study done by the CVI the preliminary conclusion is\nthat vaccination reduces the chance of an abortion considerably, and\nwill probably prevent it almost all together. At the same time there\nare indications that a considerable reduction in shedding of _C.\nburnetii_ is achieved by fully and timely vaccination of the animals.\nThe vaccine used in the Netherlands is not (yet) registered in the\nEU, but has meanwhile temporary admittance in France.\n\nI would like to stress again that much is still unclear as to how the\ngradation in quantitative shedding of _C. burnetii_ bacteria by farms\nwith small ruminants is related to the gradation of the number of\nhuman cases. The experts expect that vaccination (as a means to\nreduce the shedding of _C. burnetii_) will significantly reduce the\nrisk of airborne spread of the bacteria from positive farms, thus\ndecreasing the risk for human cases. It is, however, difficult to\ntell if and how many people will get sick in 2010 and later due to\nthe presence of viable bacteria in the environment, shed during\nprevious years.\n\nYour questions (letter of 3 Mar 2010) have been discussed with the\nexperts, and here are the responses:\n\n1. How effective is the vaccine in preventing infection of animals?\n\nThere are indications that the vaccine reduces the infection rate by\n_C. burnetii_ in the majority of the vaccinated animals. An exact\nestimation of the efficacy is not possible yet.\n\n2. How effective is the vaccine in preventing abortions in animals?\n\nThe experts believe that there are sufficient indications that the\nvaccine will prevent abortions considerably, or almost entirely, in\ntimely and fully vaccinated small ruminants.\n\n3. How effective is the vaccine in preventing the shedding of _C.\nburnetii_ during abortion/partus?\n\nThere is some possibility that, despite timely and full vaccination,\nabortions may yet occur in small ruminants as a result of other\ncauses. There are sufficient indications that in such situations a\nconsiderable reduction in the shedding of _C. burnetii_ is seen,\ncompared to its shedding by aborting, Q-fever infected, unvaccinated\nanimals. An exact estimate of the reduction is at this moment not yet\navailable.\n\n4. Will substantial risks for public health remain after vaccination?\nIf affirmative, which will they be?\n\nAs already indicated in the introduction, vaccination will reduce the\nshedding of _C.burnetii_ and subsequently reduce also the risk of\nairborne bacteria spread from positive farms. It is also expected\nthat as outcome of the said reduction, risk of human cases related to\nthis shedding will decrease.\n\nThe experts have established that the presence of infectious Q-fever\nbacteria in the environment has increased due to their large-scale\nspread from positive farms during the recent years. The effect of\nthis upon the human epidemic in 2010 and years to follow is\nunpredictable. Thus, the experts cannot eliminate the possibility\nthat in 2010 and coming years new human cases will occur as a result\nof the already contaminated environment, as well as of other\n(smaller) sources and via other (as yet unknown) transmission routes.\nAt the same time, direct contact of humans with infected animals on\nthe farms will remain a potential source of infection for employees\nand visitors. Employees could be at extra risk of infection if they\nwork in the contaminated environment without proper protection.\n\nThe experts therefore agree that substantial risks for public health\ncould be maintained after vaccination. Their exact estimation is not\nyet possible.\n\n5. What would be the weight of the above risks for a possible\nphasing-out of the measures contained in the 'Continuation Strategy\nfor Q-fever control'? Could you indicate this for each measure?\n\nIn the measures overview you attached, the measures have been\nclassified into 3 groups. I will use the same classification for my\nreplies.\n\nNot all experts [in the team] have the knowledge to be able to\naddress the detailed, elaborate veterinary measures as described by\nyou. Therefore, the assessment of these measures has been formulated\nprimarily by the veterinary experts.\n\nI. Source control and preventing the expansion of the [infection] source:\n\n-For the measures that you mention in group I, the advice is to\nmaintain the fortnightly bulk milk testing of dairy goat and sheep\nfarms with more than 50 animals, until 1 Jun 2010. After 1 Jun 2010,\nthe testing could return to the original bimonthly frequency,\nproviding that the animals have been fully vaccinated before that\ndate.\n\n-All experts advise you to grant the 'negative' [non-infected] status\nonly one year has elapsed with negative periodic milk test results.\nThis, since at least one lambing season [without positive result] is\nrequired to justify this status, in view of the known increase [in\nC._burnetii_] shedding during the lambing season and its known\ngradual decrease in the months afterwards.\n\n-Both the prescribed obligatory notification of Q fever suspicion,\nand the compulsory vaccination, must be maintained.\n\n-According to the veterinary experts, the breeding ban should be\nmaintained, until 1 Jun 2010, only for the female non-pregnant\nanimals that were now spared on the farms [where culling has been\napplied].\n\n-The ban upon introduction of animals from other farms can be lifted\nas from 1 Jun 2010, provided they have been fully and timely\nvaccinated and derived from negative farms.\n\n-Vaccinating animals is supposed to reduce the shedding of _C.\nburnetii_ from positive farms. This, provided no changes have taken\nplace regarding the management and size of the farms in question.\n\n-In view of the many uncertainties, the experts advise to maintain,\nfor the time being, the bans upon the expansion of farms and upon\nadded buildings; this ban to be anew reconsidered over one year.\n\n-As to additional measures on the premises declared infected, the\nculling of pregnant animals can be nullified provided the intended\nvaccination strategy has been implemented before 1 Jun 2010.\n\n-We regard the culling steps as a one-time emergency measure applied\nfor the lambing season of 2009 - 2010.\n\n-The he-goats and rams are no source for human cases related to\nairborne spread, and therefore are not regarded a considerable public\nhealth risk. The experts believe therefore that it can be left to the\nfarming sector to decide about the conditions under which these\nanimals can be involved in the breeding process.\n\n-The animal transport ban and the rodents and birds control measures\nmust remain in force.\n\n-The measures for other goat and sheep farms, among which farms with\na public function [e.g., children's petting farms, educational\ninstitutions, nursing homes] must remain in force. The only measure\nwhich may be lifted is the breeding ban, after 1 Jun 2010 and\nprovided the animals are vaccinated. Obviously, the 1 Jun 2010\n[vaccination deadline] does not apply to recently born offspring.\n\nII. Transmission from animal to human:\n\nThe experts see no reason to revise the present general\nguidelines/information to the public.\n\nFrom preliminary results of research into the manure issue, and based\nupon studies in dairy [farms], there are indications that three\nquarters of the covered manure heaps contain no infectious _C.\nburnetii_ within a month [since collection]. Remarkably, the outer\nlayer probably contains no live _C.burnetii_ within several days, due\nto the high composting temperatures in the outer layer of the manure\nheap. In waiting for the final test results, the veterinary experts\nadvise to maintain the currently prevailing manure measures and the\nhygiene directives for dairy goat and sheep farms. They also advise\nto maintain the measures required from farms declared infected,\nsimilarly to all other measures, described in your review, in\nrelation to other goat and sheep farms.\n\nIII. In the human sector, to limit the effects of infection:\n\nThe measures for the human sector remain unchanged, with areas where\nno positive bulk milk tests have been detected deserving special\nattention.\n\nEmployers are obliged to comply to the health and safety legislation\nto prevent the risk of employees' exposure as well as possible\ndeleterious effect upon their health. It is important that permanent\nemployees and temporary workers are informed in advance about the\npossibly contaminated environment in which they will be working and\nwill know how to work safely and soundly.\n\nFormulating national Q-fever guidelines by health and safety experts\nfor secure working in a contaminated environment is essential.\n\n6. Can the dot and/or the 5-km zone be removed from the VWA Q fever\nmap for farms where the contamination status has been lifted?

The experts believe that the\npublic health risk around such a farm has not disappeared when such a\nfarm has been declared Q-fever free (repeated negative bulk milk\ntests, or culled and disinfected). The farm can however be removed\nfrom the list and the dot from the geographical map; however, for the\ntime being the 5-km zones ['stains'] shall be maintained on the map\nafter lifting the contamination status. [The reason for maintaining\nthe 5-km areas on the map] is the need for incidental employees,\ntemporary workers and other services providers in and around farms\nwhich had undergone a recent Q-fever history, to be informed in\nadvance about this and be able to work safely and soundly, even!\nif the farm has become free in the meantime.\n\nDepending on the further course of the human epidemic and on better\nknowledge of transmission, we hope to provide further advice on this\nissue at a later stage.\n\nFinally I would like to emphasise that in order to phase out the\nmeasures, as clarified above, it will be essential to carry out the\nvaccination campaign for all groups of relevant animals, timely\n(namely before pregnancy) and fully (namely 2 primary vaccinations,\nor a revaccination after a primary series), before 1 Jun 2010. New\ndata from research or from epidemiology could require reconsideration\nof the phasing-out of the measures. Involved parties will closely\nfollow the course of the epidemic in humans and in animals and the\nobtained results of research activities.\n\nDepending on new findings, I intend to reconvene with the experts at\nthe end of May [2010], at the latest.\n\n[Byline: Prof.dr.

The most affected area is the highly\nagricultural southern province of Noord Brabant, but cases have also been\nreported from neighbouring provinces. The disease has now been confirmed on\na total of 73 dairy goat farms [now 74; see commentary] and 2 sheep farms.\nThe specific epidemiology of Q fever in the Netherlands is most likely\nrelated to intensive goat farming in the proximity of densely populated areas.\n\nControl measures in the Netherlands\n-----------------------------------\nDutch authorities have introduced a number of measures to try to control\nthe spread of the outbreak. These include mandatory vaccination of small\nruminants (initially in the affected regions but extended throughout the\ncountry in 2010 to include holdings of more than 50 sheep or dairy goats,\nand premises such as petting farms and zoos), a general ban on breeding,\nand fortnightly Q fever bulk milk testing on all farms with 50 or more\ndairy goats or dairy sheep. In December 2009 a cull commenced of all\npregnant dairy goats, whether vaccinated or unvaccinated, on infected\nfarms. Non-pregnant females were spared but are banned from use for\nbreeding purposes during their lifetime.\n\nECDC threat assessment\n----------------------\nIn December 2009 the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control\n(ECDC) undertook a threat assessment concluding that 'to date, there is no\nevidence for a significant increase in the number of human cases of Q-fever\nsince 2007 in other European countries. In Belgium and Germany, goat\npopulation density is much less than in the Netherlands and 'intensive'\nfarming is not practised in the same way. Therefore, sporadic occupational\ncases and localised outbreaks could be expected in other countries,\nincluding neighbouring Germany and Belgium, if infected animals reach the\nfarms. However, the spread to the general population is unlikely to reach\nthe extent it has in the Netherlands, as farms are not so often in the\nproximity of densely populated areas and goats are not kept in the same way.'\n\nImplications for the UK\n-----------------------\nThe Human Animal Infections Risk Surveillance (HAIRS) group is a\nmulti-agency and cross-disciplinary horizon scanning group with members\nfrom the HPA, DEFRA, Veterinary Laboratories Agency, Department of Health,\nFood Standards Agency, Animal Health, and the Devolved Administrations. The\nHAIRS group met in January 2010 to discuss the implications of the Dutch\nsituation for the UK, considering evidence from the Dutch outbreak and the\nECDC threat assessment, together with UK Q fever surveillance data and\ninformation on UK farming practices.\n\nCurrent surveillance of Q fever in humans and animals does not indicate any\nrecent increase in numbers of cases in the UK. There are between 50-100\ncases per year in humans in the UK, with no apparent increase seen in 2009.\nFewer than 10 cases in animals were identified in Great Britain annually\nbetween 2006 and 2008, and none were diagnosed in 2009 to the end of\nSeptember. Further information on the background level of Q fever infection\nin sheep and goats will be available from a Q fever seroprevalence study,\ncommissioned by DEFRA, that involves screening blood samples (from about\n6000 sheep and 500 goats) collected during the 2008 routine Brucella\nscreening programme. Preliminary results are expected in early 2010.\n\nThere are significant differences in the pattern of husbandry and density\nof stocking of goats between the UK and the Netherlands. The goat industry\nin the UK is not intensive and there are very few large dairy goat farms,\nmost goat farming being small-scale and not concentrated in any one area.\n\nThe HAIRS group concluded that, due to these differences, it is highly\nunlikely that the events in the Netherlands could be repeated in the UK. In\naddition, current scientific evidence does not support the suggestion that\na hypervirulent strain may be contributing to the extent of the outbreak in\nthe Netherlands. HAIRS will continue to monitor the situation closely.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[2]\nDate: Mon 22 Feb 2010\nSource: Agrarisch Dagblad [trans.

Plants applying direct milk\nmarketing are obliged to introduce bulk tank milk Q sampling for Q fever\ntesting. The direct marketing will be resumed once it is demonstrated that\nthe plant is not infected.\n\nThough there is, so far, no evidence of Q fever in Cleves, the German\nauthorities are worried about the risk that the bacterium will cross the\nborder from the nneighboring Dutch teritory, where the disease is raging.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nSabine Zentis\nGut Laach 52385 Nideggen, Germany\n<cvlonghorns@aol.com>\n\n******\n[3]\nDate: Sat 27 Feb 2010 [accessed]\nSource: Letter to the Editor, Vaccine 2009; 27: 3801 [edited]\n\n\nQ fever vaccination \u0097 unfinished business in Australia\n------------------------------------------------------\nWe celebrate with Gidding et al [1] the achievements of the short-lived\nnational Q fever vaccination program in Australia. The data presented\nsuggest a significant impact on Q fever in certain at-risk populations at\nthe time of the program, particularly abattoir workers. Similar benefits\nmay accrue in other countries with a Q fever burden, if a national program\nwas conducted.\n\nHowever, Australia's Q fever immunisation challenge is not yet completed.\nMore than 400 cases of Q fever were reported in Australia for 2006 and in\nNew South Wales, Australia's most populous state, during 2007 the crude\nrate of notification was 3.15 per 100 000 population (n=215). These cases\noccurred despite an effective vaccine being available. The national Q fever\nvaccination program in Australia was a short-term intervention and public\nhealth history clearly demonstrates that intensive time-limited\ninterventions that are not accompanied by system change are unlikely to be\nsustainable.\n\nThere has been a shift in the epidemiology of Q fever notifications in NSW.\nRecent data suggest that the ongoing burden is being borne by rural people\nwho live and work in close contact with farm animals. Human infection\ncommonly occurs through inhaling contaminated aerosols or dust, such as\nwhen people work and live around livestock.\n\nIt is clear that while advocating international application of Q fever\nvaccination in at-risk populations, there is a need for a sustainable\nsystematic program in Australia that ensures that non-abattoir workers who\nremain at risk from this serious disease can access the protection offered\nby the available vaccine.\n\nReference\n---------\n1.

Further information on the background level of Q fever infection\nin sheep and goats will be available from a Q fever seroprevalence study,\ncommissioned by DEFRA, that involves screening blood samples (from about\n6000 sheep and 500 goats) collected during the 2008 routine Brucella\nscreening programme. \n\nIt is clear that while advocating international application of Q fever\nvaccination in at-risk populations, there is a need for a sustainable\nsystematic program in Australia that ensures that non-abattoir workers who\nremain at risk from this serious disease can access the protection offered\nby the available vaccine.

Hunter New England\nHealth, Population Health]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n< In December 2009 the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control\n(ECDC) undertook a threat assessment concluding that 'to date, there is no\nevidence for a significant increase in the number of human cases of Q-fever\nsince 2007 in other European countries. The Human Animal Infections Risk Surveillance (HAIRS) group is a\nmulti-agency and cross-disciplinary horizon scanning group with members\nfrom the HPA, DEFRA, Veterinary Laboratories Agency, Department of Health,\nFood Standards Agency, Animal Health, and the Devolved Administrations. \n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n< Therefore, sporadic occupational\ncases and localised outbreaks could be expected in other countries,\nincluding neighbouring Germany and Belgium, if infected animals reach the\nfarms. \n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nSabine Zentis\n In\naddition, current scientific evidence does not support the suggestion that\na hypervirulent strain may be contributing to the extent of the outbreak in\nthe Netherlands. Notifications of Q fever in the Netherlands \u00ad- that in earlier years\naveraged 17 human cases annually [1] \u00ad- increased to 168 cases in 2007,\n1000 in 2008, and over 2000 in 2009. Ongoing outbreak of Q fever in the Netherlands: HAIRS group considers risk\nfor UK\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n More than 400 cases of Q fever were reported in Australia for 2006 and in\nNew South Wales, Australia's most populous state, during 2007 the crude\nrate of notification was 3.15 per 100 000 population (n=215). During 25-26 Feb 2010, an international conference, entitled 'One Health in\nrelation to Q fever, in humans and animals', was held in Breda, south\nNetherlands. The data presented\nsuggest a significant impact on Q fever in certain at-risk populations at\nthe time of the program, particularly abattoir workers. The farm, with 1251 dairy goats, has\nbeen added to the Dutch Q fever distribution map, available at\n<http://www.vwa.nl/portal/page?_pageid=119,1639827&_dad=portal&_schema=PORTAL&p_file_id=46922>. The goat industry\nin the UK is not intensive and there are very few large dairy goat farms,\nmost goat farming being small-scale and not concentrated in any one area. Plants applying direct milk\nmarketing are obliged to introduce bulk tank milk Q sampling for Q fever\ntesting. Though there is, so far, no evidence of Q fever in Cleves, the German\nauthorities are worried about the risk that the bacterium will cross the\nborder from the nneighboring Dutch teritory, where the disease is raging. The veterinary services of the German county Cleves [Kleve, northwest of\nDusseldorf, less than 8 km (5 miles) south of the Dutch border] have\nannounced measures to prevent Q fever. Similar benefits\nmay accrue in other countries with a Q fever burden, if a national program\nwas conducted. In December 2009 a cull commenced of all\npregnant dairy goats, whether vaccinated or unvaccinated, on infected\nfarms.", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "q fever"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2010-03-25 00:00:00", "2000-03-25 00:00:00", "2010-01-25 00:00:00", "2007-03-25 00:00:00", "2021-03-17 00:00:00", "2009-03-25 00:00:00", "2009-12-25 00:00:00", "2010-02-26 00:00:00", "1974-03-25 00:00:00", "1251-03-25 00:00:00", "2025-02-26 20:10:00", "2008-03-25 00:00:00", "2006-03-25 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Utrecht", "country": "Netherlands"}, {"location": "France", "country": "France"}, {"location": "Belgium", "country": "Belgium"}, {"location": "Great Britain", "country": "United Kingdom"}, {"location": "Canada", "country": "Canada"}, {"location": "Netherlands", "country": "Netherlands"}, {"location": "Australia", "country": "Australia"}, {"location": "Zegveld", "country": "Netherlands"}, {"location": "Germany", "country": "Germany"}, {"location": "UK", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Breda", "country": "Netherlands"}, {"location": "EU", "country": "France"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "388661", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Q fever - Netherlands (16): human, animal", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=388661", "date": "2010-02-26 23:50:00", "main_text": "Q FEVER - NETHERLANDS (16): HUMAN, ANIMAL\n*****************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\n<http://www.promedmail.org>\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\n<http://www.isid.org>\n\n******\n[1]\nDate: Thu 25 Feb 2010\nSource: De Telegraaf via AgriHolland [trans.

These recordings have been abridged and edited;\ndiscussions omitted. - Mod. AS]\n\nThe conference was attended and the report made by Christine Bijl, as\nELA representative.\n\nThe conference, organised by the Ministry of Agriculture in\ncollaboration with Wageningen UR and the Animal Health Service,\nstarted early on Thu 25 Feb 2010.\n\n1st day: 25 Feb 2010\n\nThe 1st day was chaired by Jaap Wagenaar (Veterinary Faculty Utrecht)\nwith the opening words of welcome by Elske Smith (Ministry\nLNV/Agriculture). Wagenaar emphasised that the conference had an\ninformative character.\n\n1. Christianne Bruschke (Ministry-CVO) - Actual veterinary situation\nand developments in the Netherlands Christianne sketched the\ndevelopment of the Dutch situation from the veterinary point of view.\nThe human side of the problems would be outlined in the next\npresentation by Yvonne. No one in the Netherlands had ever expected\nthat after the 1st human cases (2007) this epidemic would grow to\nsuch proportions. Nowhere in the world has such a development been\ndocumented before. At this moment, 70 percent of all dairy goat farms\nare still Q-fever free. Some contaminations were caused by\ntransporting animals from one farm to the other. Investigations into\nan industrial way of killing the bacterium in manure are in process.\nMuch is still to be learned about the Dutch problem.\n\n2. Yvonne van Duynhoven (RIVM) - The story of human Q-fever in the Netherlands\n\nThere have been retrospective investigations into previous clusters\nof Q-fever patients in hospitals: 2 in 2005, 1 in 2006 and 4 in 2007.\nIn Herpen (1st village in Brabant reporting human Q-fever), 24\npercent of the people became infected. In Helmond, 30 percent of\nabortions in a goat farm resulted in the 1st human cases 3 weeks\nlater, most of them in the 2-km-zone and decreasingly in the\n5-km-zone. Research into the risks of an infection for pregnant women\nshowed no complications for partus or neonatals. The Public Health\nCouncil has been requested to advise on the possible use of a human\nvaccine, answer expected in June 2010. Diagnostic delay has\ndecreased: more awareness made patients visit the doctors sooner, and\nthe doctors did not wait long before checking for Q-fever. Why is it\nthat in all Q-fever literature, just 5 percent serious illness is\nmentioned, when in the Netherlands 20 percent have been hospitalised?\nAn artefact? The hospitalisation rate has gone down from 20 to 16.8\npercent. Occurring complications: hepatitis 3.5, and endocarditis 0.3 percent.\n\n3. Francisco Reviriego Gordejo (DGSANCO) - Q-fever: the EU public and\nanimal health legislative context\n\nRiviriego sketched Q-fever as an apparently underestimated and\nunder-listed disease not included in EU legislation for animal\ndiseases, in contrast to brucellosis and RVF, and as a zoonosis not\nexplicitly listed in zoonoses- monitoring, in contrast to brucellosis\nand salmonella. Q-fever is progressively covered by EU surveillance\nfor public health monitoring. In the basic OIE standards, Q-fever is\nlisted but not for international trade. Apparently, the EU wheels are\nturning slowly; however, moves are being made now to include Q-fever\nin future as a notifiable disease.\n\n3. Pia Makela (EFSA) - Current reporting and monitoring of Q-fever in\nanimals in EU\n\nEFSA collects yearly data on monitoring of zoonoses. MSs have to\nsubmit these data on 8 zoonoses, among which Q-fever is not listed.\nHowever, based on the epidemiological situation of the MSs, other\nzoonoses may be included. Currently, data of 7 other zoonoses,\nincluding Q-fever, are reported. EFSA collaborates closely with ECDC\n(European Centre for Disease prevention and Control) to analyse and\npublish the yearly reports. Reporting list B diseases (like Q-fever)\nor not is an MS decision.\n\nEncouraged by EFSA, Q-fever reporting started in 2005. Since then,\nmore and more MSs are sending in their data. The reported data are\nnot harmonised: most reports are from clinical investigations\n(abortions), some from monitoring, some from surveillance and some\nfrom surveys. Data do not show whether they are herd based or from\nindividual sampling, nor what diagnostic methods were used. So data\nbetween MSs are not comparable. EFSA has given a grant to a\nconsortium of MSs institutes (AFSSA/France, CVI/Netherlands,\nFLI/Germany and NVRI/Poland) led by AFSSA to produce a harmonised\nmonitoring and reporting scheme for Q-fever in animals. (See Richard\nThiery's presentation on 26 Feb 2010). Up till today, Q-fever was\npresent in all 18 reporting MSs. Without harmonisation, it is\nimpossible to interpret the data.\n\n4. Denis Coulombier (ECDC) - Implications for public health in the EU\n\nECDC is involved in an advisory role re Q-fever since 2007/08. With\nthe rise of cases in the Netherlands, there seems to be a new\ndimension in the Q-fever situation. The EU Commission has requested\nECDC to assess the risks. The Bavarian problems in Germany appear not\nto be related to the Dutch situation. His conclusion: Confirmed\ncirculation of _C. burnetii_ should start early warning for public health.\n\n5. Jeannette van de Ven (ZLTO) - The meaning and consequences of\nQ-fever for farmers in general and especially the situation of goat farming\n\nJeanette and her husband started the family farm in 1995 with 200\nkids and have expanded that number to 2000 goats today. In 2008,\ntheir farm is situated in the compulsory vaccination zone, and\ntherefore all animals were vaccinated twice (boost after 6 weeks); in\n2009, the old animals were vaccinated once and the kids twice. Then\nin December 2009, the farm was declared contaminated based on bulk\nmilk monitoring. Out of 2000 animals, 524 pregnant animals were\nkilled in the 1st round and 101 in the 2nd. Not only did she tell her\nown sad story, she also told us about a farm outside the compulsory\nvaccination zone where all animals had been vaccinated voluntarily\nand yet this farm too was declared contaminated. Again the pregnant\nanimals were culled based on bulk milk testing results. Bulk milk\ntests give no information about the number of infected animals at a\ncontaminated farm. It could be that the majority of culled animals\nwere healthy. At the moment, there is continuing uncertainty for the\nfarmers: the breeding ban is set till July 2010, but what is going to\nhappen afterwards? The culling policy undermined the vaccination\npolicy. The vaccination policy should have avoided unnecessary\nkilling as control policy. Farmers are eager to do everything to\nprevent people from getting sick (therefore, they did agree to the\ndrastic measures this time), but eradication of the bacterium is\nimpossible. There must be a risk-based balance in future and not a\npolicy based on sentiment and media impact.\n\n6. Annie Rodolakis (France) - Q-fever in France - An elaborate\ndescription of the Q-fever situation in France where most human cases\nwere due to infection in sheep herds.\n\nTo compare virulence of strains, a mouse model was developed. Sheep\nstrains appeared to be less virulent for mice than the ones from\nbovines and goats. So possibly other factors could be responsible for\nthe route to humans. Sheep mostly shed in faeces and vaginal mucus.\nBovines hardly do. Studies into the efficacy of the available\nvaccines showed that the CEVA vaccine Coxevac is very efficient, not\nonly reduces the number of abortions in a herd, but also the amount\nof shedding. Whereas the Merial vaccine Chlamyvax (combination\nvaccination against Chlamydophila and Q-fever) did neither. The\nFrench have developed a skin test for infected herds to determine\nwhich ones are to be vaccinated. Then, one can suffice with\nvaccinating the non-reacting animals. Hygienic measures are in place\nas well, like carefully destroying afterbirth material (so it will\nnot be taken-up by domestic or wild animals), birthing in confined\nlocations, disinfection of these locations afterwards and treating\nthe manure with lime or calcium cyanamide and refraining from its\nspreading/dissemination in windy conditions. Still more research is\ndone regarding the best way to handle manure and the other hygienic measures.\n\n7. Stephen Graves (Australia) - Epidemiology and the role of human vaccination\n\nAfter giving us the history of _C. burnetii_, Graves told us that\nQ-fever is widely spread in Australia, with concentrations in\nQueensland and anywhere around localities with livestock and\nabattoirs etc. Australia is a scarcely-populated country with widely\nscattered farms (lots of space for all the Dutch goats). The Coxiella\nbacterium is found in all ruminants, kangaroos and the kangaroo tick,\nnot so much in domestic animals. Most human cases are due to aerosol\nspread from dried animal waste. The Australians developed a vaccine\nfor humans, licensed in 1989. It is still the only approved human\nvaccine in the world. However, before vaccinating a person, one MUST\n(obligatory) perform a skin test to prevent post-vaccination\nreactions. Anyone with previous Q-fever history will test positive\nand therefore be excluded from vaccination, unless the risk of\ninfection is higher than a possibly harmful reaction to the vaccine.\nImmunity is supposed to last 10 years. Q-fever (for humans) is a\nnotifiable disease. It is often not diagnosed, therefore\nunder-diagnosed. The incidence is higher in dry years. Vaccination is\nnot government funded; however, meat-industry companies take\nresponsibility by offering their workers vaccination. The use of\nvaccination in rural communities is common. His suggestions for the\nNetherlands: 'Buy our vaccine, try its efficacy for your local\nstrains and then develop your own vaccine. Good luck!'\n\n8. Martin Ganter (Germany) - Q-fever in Germany\n\nIn Germany, there have been over the years (notifiable since 1947)\nsome outbreaks of human Q-fever, mainly in the south (Bavaria). But\nthere have been 2 outbreaks in Jena/Thuringia (2005) and in North\nRhine-Westphalia where in 2003 some 300 people became ill with\nQ-fever after they had visited a country fair, where a single\naborting sheep had shed _C. burnetii_. In the Jena valley, the source\nof infection was found to be a small flock of lambing sheep. There\nare no specific regulations for Q-fever; it is handled when necessary\nusually by the veterinary officer, who can instate a transport ban,\nhygienic measures regarding birthing and disposal of material, and\nantibiotic treatments (tetracyclines) and vaccination. But all this\ndepends on the available knowledge of Q-fever of the involved\npersons. Due to some large outbreaks, a research network of\npublic-health and veterinary groups is working on diagnostics and\nepidemiology of Q-fever. Ganter has performed his own trial (ongoing)\nto investigate and evaluate the vaccination of a pregnant flock of\nsheep. It looks like there is a decrease (in 2009) of _C. burnetii_\nin the flock, but too soon for conclusions.\n\n9. Paula Menzies (Canada) - Q-fever & Coxiellosis in Canada\n\nCanada is a scarcely-populated country. However, in Ontario there are\nhigh animal concentrations (sheep and goats). Reported human Q-fever\ncases are low. Coxiellosis is not reportable for humans, but annually\nnotifiable. No actions are taken after diagnosis, no routine\nsurveillance. Outbreaks are always related to visiting barn shows and\nfairs. No human cases have been reported as due to cattle source;\nthere are links with cats and trapped hares (wildlife). After the cod\nfishery collapsed, Newfoundland imported goats to start dairy goat\nfarming. In the virgin area, Coxiella found a receptive, susceptible\nhost. There have been several outbreaks on 6 of the 8 farms, a\nsituation of concern [Will this turn out to be the Dutch scenario?].\nHowever, Coxiellosis is unlikely to become reportable in Canada and\nis under-diagnosed in general. Better communication to the public is\nneeded. More awareness with the authorities is needed. And Menzies is\nlooking for evidence in the Netherlands to support her efforts\ntowards the Canadian government. In May this year [2010], a study\nstarts on prevalence in Ontario.\n\n2nd day: 26 Feb 2010\n\nChairman: Frits Pluimers (former Ministry CVO)\n\n10. Benaouda Kadra (CEVA) - Q-fever: Vaccine production and control\n\nAs producer of the vaccine Coxevac, Kadra gave an overview of its\nbenefits and of the production process (purification of the bacterium\nis a difficult technique). Coxevac is registered in France since 2004\nand is used on a voluntary basis. The Netherlands have a temporary\nregistration since 2008. The Dutch have bought every possible\navailable dose for 2010. Because of the difficult production process,\nnot a single extra dose will be available this year [2010].\n\n11. Hendrik-Jan Roest (CVI) - Diagnosis, genotyping, virulence and\nculture of _C. burnetii_ in the Netherlands\n\nIn the Netherlands, bulk milk testing is used since October 2009;\nbeforehand, the abortion rate of more than 5 percent was the\nindicator for notification. A lot of discussion has been going on\nabout the efficiency and credibility of bulk milk testing as a\ncriterion for culling. However, according to Roest, the detection of\n_C. burnetii_ in a milk sample provides an absolute positive result,\neven if another test should be negative. And the fact that at culled\nfarms the last test results were negative after positive initial\nresults does not mean there is no infection on the farm, just that\nthe shedding went below the detection threshold. 30 percent of the\nanimals will not be detected. In genotying, 13 types were found in\nthe Netherlands using Multi Locus variable number tandem repeat\nAnalysis (MLVA). MLVA-type 11 is predominant on all Brabant farms and\non all dairy goat farms. Harmonising of the typing methods is\nessential for interpretation (see EFSA-grant). Whether the\npredominant type 11 is more virulent than the others is still a\nquestion not answered. However in cooperation with France, several\nDutch and French strains will be compared to find the answer,\nexpectedly this year [2010]. It may be assumed that the Dutch goats\nand people are relatively more susceptible ('virgin') regarding\nQ-fever, this possibly leading to more severe effect.\n\n12. Richard Thiery (AFSSA) - Results of EFSA's grant on improving\nharmonised Q-fever monitoring in the EU\n\nAs we heard from Pia Makela (EFSA), the reports from MSs are not\nharmonised and therefore cannot be properly interpreted or compared.\nThe EFSA-grant to AFSSA (in collaboration with CVI, FLI and NVRI)\naims to create a harmonising-system. So harmonisation is the key\nword. In 14 of 18 reporting MSs, the disease is notifiable for\nanimals. Some MSs are reporting at level of animals (individual)\nothers at herd level. There are no definitions or specificity of\nclinical signs. Harmonisation will start with central reporting of\nclinically affected herds (of domestic ruminants only) after serial\nabortions and presence of the bacterium is confirmed by PCR, and\npositive serology by ELISA. RT-PCR is most effective when performed\nwithin 8 days after abortion, and ELISA is very effective in\nvaccinated herds. For active surveillance, bulk milk testing is very\neffective. The final report is expected this spring [2010].\n\n13. Dimitrios Frangoulidis (Germany) - _Coxiella burnetii_ -\nstability in the environment and molecular typing\n\nThere are 55 strains and 17 genotypes. Despite the fact that _C.\nburnetii_ is spread all over the world and is found in many species,\nit is rarely reported. _C. burnetii_ is known as large cell variants\n(LCV) and small cell variants (SCV). The small variant is more stable\nand can survive in soil or dust for many years, in various\ncircumstances like in acid environments and high temperatures\n(resistance up to 70 C for 15 minutes). Diagnostic capabilities have\nimproved over the years, but there is still a lot to be learned about\nthe epidemiology of the disease.\n\n14. Piet Vellema (Animal Health Service Deventer) - Research in\nrelation to the approach of Q-fever\n\nBulk milk testing was initially (October 2009) aiming at accrediting\nrepeatedly test negative dairy farms. However in December 2009, this\ntesting was used to identify positive farms and consequently kill all\npregnant animals at such farms. Efficacy of vaccination was tested on\n15 dairy farms. There was some elevation of temperature, some skin\neffects, and a few cases of a drop in milk production. However, the\nshedding of bacteria was considerable after some time. At the request\nof the audience, Vellema elaborated on research into the relation\nbetween temperature in the manure heap and survival of the bacterium.\nIt became apparent that the temperature in manure rose to over 70 C\nwithin 2 days, but only in the upper layer. The core never rose above\n40 C. The more oxygen could be induced (like in the top layer), the\nhigher the temperature rose. As up-turning a contaminated heap\nproduces the risk of freeing bacteria, one believes that airing the\nheap with pipes would be the best way to raise the temperature in the core.\n\nIt was a very interesting and well organised conference with a wide\nrange of speakers and enough time for questions and discussion. In\nthe afternoon, the speakers and invited experts and stakeholders\nremained to discuss several angles in smaller groups. This session\nwas open only to selected people.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nChristine Bijl\nEuropean Livestock Association (ELA) Secretary\nKootwijkerbroek, The Netherlands\n<http://www.ela-europe.org/>\n<Christinebijl@gmail.com>\n\n[Should the presentations or official abstracts become available, we\nshall be happy to include them in future posting(s). - Mod.AS]", "summary": "Francisco Reviriego Gordejo (DGSANCO) - Q-fever: the EU public and\nanimal health legislative context\n\nRiviriego sketched Q-fever as an apparently underestimated and\nunder-listed disease not included in EU legislation for animal\ndiseases, in contrast to brucellosis and RVF, and as a zoonosis not\nexplicitly listed in zoonoses- monitoring, in contrast to brucellosis\nand salmonella. A ProMED-mail post\n<http://www.promedmail.org>\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\n<http://www.isid.org>\n\nDate: Wed, 3 Feb 2010\n Hygienic measures are in place\nas well, like carefully destroying afterbirth material (so it will\nnot be taken-up by domestic or wild animals), birthing in confined\nlocations, disinfection of these locations afterwards and treating\nthe manure with lime or calcium cyanamide and refraining from its\nspreading/dissemination in windy conditions. But\nthere have been 2 outbreaks in Jena/Thuringia (2005) and in North\nRhine-Westphalia where in 2003 some 300 people became ill with\nQ-fever after they had visited a country fair, where a single\naborting sheep had shed _C. burnetii_. There\nare no specific regulations for Q-fever; it is handled when necessary\nusually by the veterinary officer, who can instate a transport ban,\nhygienic measures regarding birthing and disposal of material, and\nantibiotic treatments (tetracyclines) and vaccination. Stephen Graves (Australia) - Epidemiology and the role of human vaccination\n\nAfter giving us the history of _C. burnetii_, Graves told us that\nQ-fever is widely spread in Australia, with concentrations in\nQueensland and anywhere around localities with livestock and\nabattoirs etc. Hendrik-Jan Roest (CVI) - Diagnosis, genotyping, virulence and\nculture of _C. burnetii_ in the Netherlands\n\nIn the Netherlands, bulk milk testing is used since October 2009;\nbeforehand, the abortion rate of more than 5 percent was the\nindicator for notification. In 2008,\ntheir farm is situated in the compulsory vaccination zone, and\ntherefore all animals were vaccinated twice (boost after 6 weeks); in\n2009, the old animals were vaccinated once and the kids twice. EFSA has given a grant to a\nconsortium of MSs institutes (AFSSA/France, CVI/Netherlands,\nFLI/Germany and NVRI/Poland) led by AFSSA to produce a harmonised\nmonitoring and reporting scheme for Q-fever in animals. In Helmond, 30 percent of\nabortions in a goat farm resulted in the 1st human cases 3 weeks\nlater, most of them in the 2-km-zone and decreasingly in the\n5-km-zone. Not only did she tell her\nown sad story, she also told us about a farm outside the compulsory\nvaccination zone where all animals had been vaccinated voluntarily\nand yet this farm too was declared contaminated. Why is it\nthat in all Q-fever literature, just 5 percent serious illness is\nmentioned, when in the Netherlands 20 percent have been hospitalised?\n And the fact that at culled\nfarms the last test results were negative after positive initial\nresults does not mean there is no infection on the farm, just that\nthe shedding went below the detection threshold. Harmonisation will start with central reporting of\nclinically affected herds (of domestic ruminants only) after serial\nabortions and presence of the bacterium is confirmed by PCR, and\npositive serology by ELISA. ELA) Secretary\nKootwijkerbroek, The Netherlands\n<http://www.ela-europe.org/>\n<Christinebijl@gmail.com>\n\n The reported data are\nnot harmonised: most reports are from clinical investigations\n(abortions), some from monitoring, some from surveillance and some\nfrom surveys. Studies into the efficacy of the available\nvaccines showed that the CEVA vaccine Coxevac is very efficient, not\nonly reduces the number of abortions in a herd, but also the amount\nof shedding. The small variant is more stable\nand can survive in soil or dust for many years, in various\ncircumstances like in acid environments and high temperatures\n(resistance up to 70 C for 15 minutes). Farmers are eager to do everything to\nprevent people from getting sick (therefore, they did agree to the\ndrastic measures this time), but eradication of the bacterium is\nimpossible. Piet Vellema (Animal Health Service Deventer) - Research in\nrelation to the approach of Q-fever\n\nBulk milk testing was initially (October 2009) aiming at accrediting\nrepeatedly test negative dairy farms. The meaning and consequences of\nQ-fever for farmers in general and especially the situation of goat farming\n\nJeanette and her husband started the family farm in 1995 with 200\nkids and have expanded that number to 2000 goats today. Benaouda Kadra (CEVA) - Q-fever: Vaccine production and control\n\nAs producer of the vaccine Coxevac, Kadra gave an overview of its\nbenefits and of the production process (purification of the bacterium\nis a difficult technique). Annie Rodolakis (France) - Q-fever in France - An elaborate\ndescription of the Q-fever situation in France where most human cases\nwere due to infection in sheep herds. Richard Thiery (AFSSA) - Results of EFSA's grant on improving\nharmonised Q-fever monitoring in the EU\n\nAs we heard from Pia Makela (EFSA), the reports from MSs are not\nharmonised and therefore cannot be properly interpreted or compared. Anyone with previous Q-fever history will test positive\nand therefore be excluded from vaccination, unless the risk of\ninfection is higher than a possibly harmful reaction to the vaccine. Due to some large outbreaks, a research network of\npublic-health and veterinary groups is working on diagnostics and\nepidemiology of Q-fever. However in December 2009, this\ntesting was used to identify positive farms and consequently kill all\npregnant animals at such farms. It may be assumed that the Dutch goats\nand people are relatively more susceptible ('virgin') regarding\nQ-fever, this possibly leading to more severe effect. Apparently, the EU wheels are\nturning slowly; however, moves are being made now to include Q-fever\nin future as a notifiable disease. The Public Health\nCouncil has been requested to advise on the possible use of a human\nvaccine, answer expected in June 2010. Diagnostic delay has\ndecreased: more awareness made patients visit the doctors sooner, and\nthe doctors did not wait long before checking for Q-fever. Bulk milk\ntests give no information about the number of infected animals at a\ncontaminated farm. But all this\ndepends on the available knowledge of Q-fever of the involved\npersons. Then\nin December 2009, the farm was declared contaminated based on bulk\nmilk monitoring. Q FEVER - NETHERLANDS (18): UPDATE AND REVIEW\n*********************************************\n However, according to Roest, the detection of\n_C. burnetii_ in a milk sample provides an absolute positive result,\neven if another test should be negative. The Coxiella\nbacterium is found in all ruminants, kangaroos and the kangaroo tick,\nnot so much in domestic animals. The conference, organised by the Ministry of Agriculture in\ncollaboration with Wageningen UR and the Animal Health Service,\nstarted early on Thu 25 Feb 2010. As up-turning a contaminated heap\nproduces the risk of freeing bacteria, one believes that airing the\nheap with pipes would be the best way to raise the temperature in the core. No one in the Netherlands had ever expected\nthat after the 1st human cases (2007) this epidemic would grow to\nsuch proportions. Vaccination is\nnot government funded; however, meat-industry companies take\nresponsibility by offering their workers vaccination. However, before vaccinating a person, one MUST\n(obligatory) perform a skin test to prevent post-vaccination\nreactions. Ganter has performed his own trial (ongoing)\nto investigate and evaluate the vaccination of a pregnant flock of\nsheep. There have been several outbreaks on 6 of the 8 farms, a\nsituation of concern [Will this turn out to be the Dutch scenario?].\n A lot of discussion has been going on\nabout the efficiency and credibility of bulk milk testing as a\ncriterion for culling. Christianne Bruschke (Ministry-CVO) - Actual veterinary situation\nand developments in the Netherlands Christianne sketched the\ndevelopment of the Dutch situation from the veterinary point of view. His suggestions for the\nNetherlands: 'Buy our vaccine, try its efficacy for your local\nstrains and then develop your own vaccine. Despite the fact that _C.\nburnetii_ is spread all over the world and is found in many species,\nit is rarely reported. At the request\nof the audience, Vellema elaborated on research into the relation\nbetween temperature in the manure heap and survival of the bacterium. The\nFrench have developed a skin test for infected herds to determine\nwhich ones are to be vaccinated. However in cooperation with France, several\nDutch and French strains will be compared to find the answer,\nexpectedly this year [2010]. At the moment, there is continuing uncertainty for the\nfarmers: the breeding ban is set till July 2010, but what is going to\nhappen afterwards? After the cod\nfishery collapsed, Newfoundland imported goats to start dairy goat\nfarming. RT-PCR is most effective when performed\nwithin 8 days after abortion, and ELISA is very effective in\nvaccinated herds. Sheep\nstrains appeared to be less virulent for mice than the ones from\nbovines and goats. Diagnostic capabilities have\nimproved over the years, but there is still a lot to be learned about\nthe epidemiology of the disease.

This aspect has been\nelaborately described: there could be times when the animals shed\nmore, less or no bacteria. Repeatedly testing samples from farms with\ncontinuously negative results will increase the reliability of the\ndecision to define the status of a farm as not contaminated. For this\nreason, bulk milk testing is now performed with an interval of 2 weeks.\n\nRecently, there have also been doubts about the reliability of\npositive test results, also because of the different outcome of the\nresults from the 'same' sample tested at various laboratories.\nDoubting a positive result, however, is not justified. I will try to\nclarify the apparent discrepancies of the results at the various\nlaboratories or within one and the same laboratory.\n\nThere are various PCR tests available to demonstrate the DNA of the\nbacterium _Coxiella burnettii_ in a sample. The sensitivity of such a\ntest depends, among other things, upon the chosen 'target DNA.' For\n_C. burnettii_, some unique DNA particles are described. Some of these\nparticles occur only once in a bacterium. Others occur more than once\nin one bacterium. The number of times that such a DNA particle shows\nin _C. burnettii_ can vary per strain. Our CVI test used to detect\npositive farms aims to detect the so called IS1111 gene, several\ncopies of which are known to be present in _C. burnettii_; their\nnumber varies in different strains.\n\nAs described in the validation report, this PCR test is 100-fold more\nsensitive than a PCR test based on a DNA particle that appears only\nonce in one bacterium. This means that differences between results\nfrom various laboratories could occur: One laboratory can test more\nsensitively than the other depending on the choice of the target DNA\nparticle.\n\nEven if the various laboratories use the same target DNA sample,\ndifferent results can be generated by small differences of test\nprocedures. Even within the same laboratory, various random tests from\none sample could give different results. This can happen when the\namount of bacteria in the sample is close to the detection level of\nthe test. A positive result incontrovertibly demonstrates the presence\nof _C. burnettii_ DNA and, therefore, the presence of the bacterium. A\npositive result is, therefore, absolutely reliable.\n\nA negative result gives 2 possibilities: either there is no DNA in the\nsample and, therefore, _C. burnettii_ is absent; or, there is a chance\nthat the DNA is insufficient in the sample and, therefore, does not\nshow.\n\nTo illustrate the above: suppose I have received a sample of one liter\nof milk. As you know, but this might not be clear to laymen, only part\nof the submitted sample is used for the final test (in other words, a\nsingle test of a sample is only a single random test from the sample).\nSuppose I use one ml in my test with a detection limit of one\nbacterium per ml. If, for instance, there were one million bacteria in\nthat one liter of milk, thus 1000 bacteria per ml, any laboratory will\ntest this sample to be positive, and various random tests within the\nsame laboratory will all give a positive test result. On the other\nhand, if the amount of bacteria in that liter of milk is lower, e.g.\n1000, meaning one bacterium per ml, this will be on the detection\nlimit of my test, and it could, therefore, lead to a one-time negative\nrandom test. That applies even more in case of an even lower amount of\nbacteria (e.g. with 10 random tests from one sample: 7 random tests\nwith negative results and 3 with a positive result). Despite the 7\nnegative scores, the final outcome of the said test is a positive milk\nsample.\n\nApparently, there is some confusion as well about the specificity of\nthe test using the data from the CVI-validity report.\n\nTo clarify this: the test has an analytical specificity of 100\npercent: if the test is positive, DNA of the _Coxiella burnettii_\nbacterium will show in all cases. There are no false-positive results.\n\nApparently, some expert has indicated that based on data from our\nreport, the predictive value of a positive test is 84 percent; on\naccount of a comparison of our results in the validation report made\nbetween the PCR-test and an ELISA for detection of antibodies. We are\nasked for such data to accredit the tests. In technical terms, it has\nto do with a comparison of 2 different tests when no 'golden standard'\nis available and relative diagnostic sensitivities are bilaterally\ncalculated. Such data, however, are irrelevant for the predictive\nvalue of the PCR test in order to show bacterial DNA and, therefore,\ncannot be used to estimate the reliability of a positive PCR result,\nas apparently has been done.\n\nF.G. van Zijderveld\nHead of Bacteriology and TSEs Division\nActing Director CVI of Wageningen UR\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nChristine Bijl\nKootwijkerbroek, Netherlands\nSecretary European Livestock association (ELA)\n\n[The above explanatory note is timely and rather convincing. One point\ndeserves to be stressed and is valid for PCR tests in general: in view\nof the high sensitivity of PCR tests, with the potential to detect the\ntarget DNA and thus produce a positive result even when the number of\nbacteria is indeed minimal, the samples should be collected,\ntransported and handled throughout with maximal biosecurity and\ncaution, avoiding any chance of their incidental cross-contamination.\n- Mod.AS]", "summary": "One point\ndeserves to be stressed and is valid for PCR tests in general: in view\nof the high sensitivity of PCR tests, with the potential to detect the\ntarget DNA and thus produce a positive result even when the number of\nbacteria is indeed minimal, the samples should be collected,\ntransported and handled throughout with maximal biosecurity and\ncaution, avoiding any chance of their incidental cross-contamination.

Mod.AS, summarised and edited].\n<http://www.minlnv.nl/pls/portal/url/page/minlnv/actueel/voorlooppagina?p_file_id=51083>\n\n\n[The letter included, inter alia, replies to queries from MP's\n(members of Parliament). The following 6 replies have been selected\ndue to their significant additions to available information. - Mod.AS]\n\n1. Information requested on the possible relationship between clusters\nof sick people and non-dairy farms (including mutton-type sheep).\n\nThe information on possible role of mutton-sheep in human infection\nwill be forwarded to the House as soon as scientific advice is obtained.\n\n2. Requested information concerning the updated policy of animal vaccination.\n\nAccording to the published regulations, all goats and sheep present on\nfarms which are to be vaccinated compulsorily, should be vaccinated\nbefore 1 Jan 2011. To make sure that such vaccination is performed\nprior to gestation in milk-producing and breeding farms, the final\ndate in this category of farms has been modified, becoming 1 Jun 2010.\n\n3. What is the Q fever situation in other [EU] Member States?\n\nWe refer you to the recent publication of the European Food Safety\nAuthority (EFSA), named 'THE COMMUNITY SUMMARY REPORT ON TRENDS AND\nSOURCES OF ZOONOSES AND ZOONOTIC AGENTS AND FOOD-BORNE OUTBREAKS IN\nTHE EUROPEAN UNION IN 2008', which was published on 28 Jan 2010. The\nreport paid specific attention to Q fever and to the occurrence of the\nbacterium in various member states\n(<http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/scdocs/scdoc/1496.htm>). In addition,\nthe European Commission (EC) has requested EFSA to provide, in the\nnear future, scientific advice concerning Q fever. This advice will\ncover the incidence of the disease in man and animal in Europe, a well\nas the risk factors and the potential ways to control the disease.\n\n4. In reply to a query on research and investigation during the\nculling procedures:\n\nStudies concerning the vaccine have shown that it reduces the\ninfection rate, abortion incidence and dissemination of the pathogen\nby infected animals. At present, information is gathered by sampling\nvarious tissues and organs, such as amniotic fluids and placentas from\nthe culled animals, which may come from vaccinated as well as from\nunvaccinated farms. These samples will be tested for the presence of\nthe Q fever bacterium. This may provide knowledge concerning the\nefficiency of the vaccine within the Dutch circumstances.\n\n5. Regarding notified human cases of Q fever during 2010:\n\nRIVM-Clb (The National Institute for Public Health and the Environment\n-- Centre for Infectious Disease Control) has received since 1 Jan\n2010, from 17 Municipal Health Services (GGD's), reports on 136 cases\nof which the disease onset was between 2007 and early 2010. Doctors\nand laboratories are officially obliged to notify each Q fever case.\nIn each case the GGD performs an investigation which includes contact\nwith the doctor or the patient, to clarify where and when the\ninfection had taken place. Of the 136 mentioned cases, it is known\nthat 11 became initially sick in 2010; 48 are known to have fallen ill\nwith the disease during 2009, 3 had their onset during 2008 and one\npatient in 2007. No information on the date of onset is known\nconcerning the remaining 73 notifications.\n\nIn 2009, 6 patients were notified during the 1st 5 weeks, one of which\nwith onset in 2007, one in May 2008, 2 in November 2008, one in\nDecember 2008 and one in January 2009. Since both physicians and\npatients are currently more aware of the disease, RIVM-Clb expects an\nincrease in the number of notifications. If observed, it will be\ninvestigated if such an increase reflects a higher disease incidence\nor rather an enhanced notification rate. It is too early to make such\na judgement at the present point in time.\n\n6. Concerning research on public health aspects of Q fever:\n\nCurrent research is directed at risk factors for humans (in the\ngeneral population as well as in specific risk groups), at the impact\nof infection upon pregnancy, at the development of better diagnostic\nmethods, at the identification of the most effective medical treatment\nand at the impact of the disease on patients and upon society at large.\n\nA case is notified by the GGD only if the diagnosis was confirmed by\nlaboratory test. Positive serological tests of persons who have not\n(or had no) complaints, are not included in the notifications.\n\nMost notified cases reside near infected dairy goat or dairy sheep\nfarms (less than 5 km). Other possible factors, such as profession or\nrecreation -- outdoor activities -- are under ongoing investigation.\nBased upon currently available information fom the international\nscientific literature, there is no evidence for a man-to-man infection\nof significance. This aspect is not being investigated.\n\nVarious therapeutic treatments are being investigated by the medical\ninstitutions and a hospital. A research project into the comparative\nefficiency of the 2 main antibiotics currently in use, proposed by 2\nhospitals, is under consideration.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>", "summary": "A ProMED-mail post\n<http://www.promedmail.org>\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\n<http://www.isid.org>\n\n******\n Concerning research on public health aspects of Q fever:\n\nCurrent research is directed at risk factors for humans (in the\ngeneral population as well as in specific risk groups), at the impact\nof infection upon pregnancy, at the development of better diagnostic\nmethods, at the identification of the most effective medical treatment\nand at the impact of the disease on patients and upon society at large.

Farms which plan a new\nstart must guarantee the absence of infected animals.\n\nVerburg promised to make an effort to safeguard the supply, in 2010,\nof larger quantities of vaccines against Q fever than the already\nordered 1.5 million doses.

Today, the Netherlands suffers\nfrom an outbreak of Q-fever among goats; 3 years ago it was hit by an\noutbreak of bluetongue (catarrhal fever); in 2003 bird flu (avian\ninfluenza) was an issue; foot-and-mouth struck in 2001, and classical\nswine fever ruled in 1997. In the meantime, mad cow disease lingered\nfor years. Last year [2009] was the 1st since 1997 that no new cases\nof the illness were reported.\n\nThe assumption is that industrialisation of agriculture goes hand in\nhand with larger, more frequent, and deadlier veterinary diseases.\nBut does it really?\n\nFred van Zijderveld, the deputy director of the Central Veterinary\nInstitute, thinks not. 'What has changed is our perception of events\nbecause of the large scale media attention. At the same time, people\naccept less when it comes to the suffering of animals. There was an\noutbreak of classical swine fever in 1952 in which 3000 farms were\ncontaminated, and the same happened to 1700 businesses in 1962.'\n\nThe shift in perception and tolerance manifested itself during the\n1997 epidemic of classical swine fever. Throughout the 1990s, a\nstrong non-vaccination policy was implemented in the Netherlands\nbecause some countries importing pigs did not want them vaccinated.\nThe vaccine leaves traces in the animal that resembled those of the\nactual disease, making it impossible to tell if an animal was ill or\nhad been vaccinated. That is why animals were not protected through\nvaccination after an epidemic was discovered in 1997. When it spun\nout of control, as many as 9.6 million pigs had to be culled.\n\n'Non-vaccination is very risky with all the long distance transport\nwe have today,' according to Van Zijderveld. 'Exporting countries\nmust guarantee their animals are healthy, but an infected animal will\noccasionally slip through, and viruses can spread rapidly. I think\nthe Netherlands today would choose to immediately vaccinate healthy\nanimals in the vicinity of an outbreak,' he said. 'Definitely in the\ncase of classical swine fever, because we now have a so-called marker\nvaccine that helps distinguish between vaccinated and contaminated animals.'\n\nOver the last few years, farmers have argued in favour of\ninoculating. 'Both society at large and the farmers involved want to\nstop the killing of healthy animals,' a farmers' lobby organisation\nwrote in a press release 4 years ago. In spite of this plea, the\ngovernment failed to vaccinate goats en masse even after bacteria\nthey carried had infected 2300 and killed at least 6 people. In the\npast weeks, 38 000 goats and sheep were culled to prevent more humans\nbeing infected.\n\nProfessor Roel Coutinho, the director of the Centre for Infectious\nDisease Control, believes the size of the goat industry and their\nproximity to humans caused the unprecedented outbreak. 'We used to\nsay: things like this happen in China, where many people and animals\nlive very close to each other. But the Netherlands is the China of\nEurope.' With a livestock population of 119 million animals and over\n16 million people, the country is prone to quick transmission of\ndiseases. Yet Coutinho was astonished by the impact of Q-fever. 'I\nwas surprised by the sudden appearance of intensive goat farming,' he\nsaid. Goats had become a very popular type of cattle, largely because\nother animals had proven so prone to infectious disease.\n\nIt is difficult to pass a black-and-white judgment on the relation\nbetween modern, large scale farming and animal diseases, Van\nZijderveld said. 'The scale has led to improved hygiene and the\ndisappearance of worm infections that originate in livestock. If\norganic farming grows, tapeworm infections in humans may reappear.'\n\nPartly due to specialisation of businesses, said Van Zijderveld, a\nnumber of diseases, like tuberculosis and brucellosis, have\ndisappeared completely. 'In the fifties, many people got TB from\ninfected cattle. That was the main reason for pasteurising milk,\nregular animal testing and the removal of infected animals from the\npopulation. Since 1990, we are officially a tuberculosis-free\ncountry,' Van Zijderveld said.\n\nProfessor Coutinho was involved in round table discussions at the\nministry of agriculture in 2007. 'I am amazed that people believe\nrisks can be eradicated,' he said at the time. 'I believe there is a\nlot we can't predict. All it takes is one incident, and the\nconsequences are huge. The image of the industry in society can turn\ncompletely.' One of the other speakers replied: 'That is what we do\nin agriculture, we only change after incidents and the reactions they evoke.'\n\n[Byline: Hans van der Lugt]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>", "summary": "A ProMED-mail post\n<http://www.promedmail.org>\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\n<http://www.isid.org>\n\n[1]\n Today, the Netherlands suffers\nfrom an outbreak of Q-fever among goats; 3 years ago it was hit by an\noutbreak of bluetongue (catarrhal fever); in 2003 bird flu (avian\ninfluenza) was an issue; foot-and-mouth struck in 2001, and classical\nswine fever ruled in 1997. \n\nChildren's petting farms and all other holdings with a public\nfunction [e.g. nursing homes etc.] will be obliged to secure that\nbirthings of pregnant goats and sheep will take place in enclosed\nspaces fully separated from the public.

The situation on\nsheep farms (both dairy and mutton flocks) is to be discussed on\nWednesday [27 Jan 2010] in an emergency debate in the House with\nMinisters Verburg (Agriculture) and Klink (Public Health).\n\nEarlier this week, it was suggested by MD Ronald Schegget of the\nPublic Health Service in Southeast Brabant that there is a linkage\nbetween 46 human cases of Q fever in Nuenen and the 12 000 visitors\nto the lamb-viewing days at a (mutton-type) sheep farm in Nuenen.\n\nAhead of the parliamentary debate, the ministers will clarify their\npolicy concerning measures against Q fever on sheep farms in a letter\naddressed to the House. So far, bulk-milk tests were the mode upon\nwhich actions on [dairy] sheep farms were determined. Mutton-sheep\nhave not been addressed so far [in relation to the current Q fever epidemic].\n\nIn the due emergency debate, the VVD party (Dutch liberal party) will\nargue for a parliamentary investigation into the control of Q-fever.\nAccording to the VVD, the inquiry set up [see 20100112.0144] has no\naccess to the cabinet's files. Various research reports and other\ndocuments have shown that the Q fever bacteria were found already in\n2005 on goat farms in the south of the country, but their locations\nhave remained secret.\n\nIn 2007, the disease was found for the 1st time in humans. Only at\nthe end of 2009, the government decided to adopt drastic control\nmeasures. According to the Ministry of Public Health and The National\nInstitute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM), 6 out of the\nalmost 3600 Q fever patients have died.\n\nThe physician-microbiologist Peter Wever (Jeroen Bosch Hospital) has,\nfollowing his survey covering 12 hospitals, counted at least 11\nfatalities. 'Our reported 6 fatalities might be an underestimate. We\ndepend upon notifications from the Public Health Service, which\nreport all disease cases but not all fatalities,' acknowledges the\nspokesperson of RIVM.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The nomination of the investigation committee of the Q fever (Qf)\nepidemic by ministers Verborg (Agriculture) and Klink (Public health)\nwas completed on 20 Jan 2010.

This press release covers the\nmain points included in that letter, as well as information on\nmodifications for bulk milk monitoring and other current issues\npresented hereunder.\n\n1. Update on the cullings\n-------------------------\nAt the moment, 61 farms have been declared contaminated, based on\nbulk milk testing results. We expect to have the results of the\ncurrent [biweekly] bulk milk tests next week. At 24 contaminated\nfarms, animals have been examined for pregnancy to distinguish the\npregnant and not-pregnant. Subsequently, all pregnant animals on\nthese farms have been valued. So far, a total of 8724 animals on 21\nfarms have been culled.\n\n2. Small-scale farms and children's/petting farms\n-----------------------------------------\nMinister Klink has asked the experts' group [see comment] to advise\nhim about the health risks of Q-fever at children's farms, farms with\nless than 50 animals and farms with a public function [e.g. nursing\nhomes etc.]. According to the experts, no extra measures need to be\ntaken regarding this cluster of farms.\n\nThe experts believe that direct contact with sheep and goats is not a\nrisk factor. Recent research data also show that Q-fever bacteria are\nhardly ever found at children's farms. There are no indications that\nchildren's farms and other small-scale farms have a higher health\nrisk to the public.\n\nThe experts advised, however, to pay special attention to hygiene\nmeasures. Therefore, a hygiene protocol will be made for the\nsmall-scale sheep and goat farms. As soon as this protocol is\navailable, it will be published on the website page 'Hobbydierhouders\nen dierhouders met een publieke functie' (Hobby animal holders and\nanimal keepers with a public function).\n\nNotification to the VWA (Food Safety Authority) in case of an\nabnormal number of abortions, has long been obligatory for hobby\nanimal holders and animal keepers with a public function (like\nchildren's farms). After notification, the VWA used to investigate\nthe farm as a standard procedure; until recently, such holdings were\ntested for _Brucella melitensis_ bacteria (causing Brucellosis).\nCurrently, such notifications will be followed also by testing for\nthe Q-fever bacteria (_Coxiella burnetii_).\n\n3. Mutton sheep farms\n---------------------\nThe experts' group led by the RIVM (National Institute for Public\nHealth and Environment) has already advised on 24 Jul 2009 that\nmutton-type sheep farms pose no risk within the Q-fever epidemic.\nHowever, large numbers of ewes are soon to start lambing in the huge\nstraw-bedding stables at the large-scale mutton-type sheep farms.\nTherefore, it has been decided that for these large-scale farms, the\nsame precautionary policy will be applied as for small-scale farms\nwith less than 50 ruminants. Hence, the advice addressing the hygiene\nprotocol for small-scale farms and children's farms will be also\napplied in the mutton producing farms.\n\n4. Judicial verdict\n-------------------\nOn 4 Jan 2010, the judge of the Board of Appeal for Commerce and\nIndustry has issued a sentence on account of the request from a goat\nkeeper to spare from culling the animals which were kept in a\ndifferent location than the holding found infected, although both\ngroups of animals were registered under the same company number as\nthe infected farm. The request from this goat keeper has been denied.\nAccording to the judge, both locations are connected units of one\ncompany, as goats have been taken from one location to the other. At\nthe location which, according to the goat keeper, was Q-fever free,\noffspring of goats from the infected holding are kept. The latter was\nfound infected by means of the bulk milk tests. Besides, the goats on\nthe Q-fever 'free' location have not all been vaccinated on time. The\nfull text of the judge's sentence (verdict No BK8183 is available at\n<http://www.rechtspraak.nl/Gerechten/CBb/Actualiteiten/Doden+van+drachtige+en+mannelijke+geiten+op+beide+locat!\n\nies+toegestaan.htm>.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nChristine Bijl\nEuropean Livestock Association (ELA) Secretary\n<Christinebijl@gmail.com>\n\n[Thanks to Christine Bijl, as well as to Mary Marshall and Sabine\nZentis for their share in obtaining the above information.\n\nThe letter VDC 09.2949/CPM of the Agriculture Minister to the Dutch\nParliament, dated 6 Jan 2010, is accompanied by 2 letters (23 Dec\n2009, 5 Jan 2010), addressed to both ministries by Prof Roel\nCoutinho, Director of the Centre for Infectious Disease Control of\nthe RIVM [National Dutch Institute for Public Health and the\nEnvironment].

The main potential hazard to humans and animals is due to\nshedding of bacteria that can then persist in the environment and be\naerosolized. The purpose of this study was to evaluate shedding after\nan outbreak of Q fever abortion in goat herds and to assess the\nrelationship with the occurrence of abortions and antibody responses.\nAborting and nonaborting goats were monitored by PCR for _C.\nburnetii_ shedding 15 and 30 days after the abortion episodes. PCR\nanalysis of all samples showed that 70 percent (n 50) of the aborting\nand 53 percent (n 70) of the non-aborting goats were positive. _C.\nburnetii_ was shed into vaginal mucus, feces, and milk of 44, 21, and\n38 percent, respectively, of goats that aborted and 27, 20, and 31\npercent, respectively, of goats that delivered normally. Statistical\ncomparison of these shedding results did not reveal any difference\nbetween these 2 groups. PCR results obtained for the vaginal and\nfecal routes were concordant in 81 percent of cases, whereas those\nfor milk correlated with only 49 percent of cases with either vaginal\nor fecal shedding status. Serological analysis, using enzyme-linked\nimmunosorbent assay (ELISA), indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA),\nand complement fixation tests showed that at least 24 percent of the\nseronegative goats shed bacteria. Positive vaginal and fecal\nshedding, unlike positive milk shedding, was observed more often in\nanimals that were weakly positive or negative by ELISA or IFA. Two\nopposite shedding trends were thus apparent for the milk and\nvaginal-fecal routes. Moreover, this study showed that a\nnon-negligible proportion of seronegative animals that delivered\nnormally could excrete _C. burnetii_.\n\n[Byline: Elodie Rousset, Mustapha Berri, Benoit Durand, Philippe\nDufour, Myriam Prigent, Thibault Delcroix, Anne Touratier, and Annie Rodolakis]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>", "summary": "On 4 Jan 2010, the judge of the Board of Appeal for Commerce and\nIndustry has issued a sentence on account of the request from a goat\nkeeper to spare from culling the animals which were kept in a\ndifferent location than the holding found infected, although both\ngroups of animals were registered under the same company number as\nthe infected farm.

The Animal Health Service (GD) examines bulk tank milk samples\nfor the presence of _Coxiella burnetii_ (Q fever). In most sheep and\ngoat farms, these samples are collected by the GD. Some farmers,\nhowever, send their samples to the GD independently. Following the\nmodification in the regulations, the DG will collect samples from\nthese farms directly, similarly to all other farms. By this\narrangement, the quality of the samples and the reliability of the\nresearch results will improve. This regulation addresses about 50 out\nof the 411 sheep and goat farms. The changes take effect on 30 Dec\n2009, at 4.00 pm.\n\nCompulsory periodic bulk tank milk monitoring has been introduced in\nthe Netherlands as of 1 Oct 2009. Its purpose is to detect, by\nfrequent testing, newly infected farms. The monitoring frequency is,\nas of 14 Dec 2009, increased to once every 2 weeks. [The initial\nrequired sampling frequency was once in 2 months; the revision is\nexplained by the fact that excretion of the bacterium may be\nintermittent. - Mod.AS]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The given number of monitored farms, 411, most probably does not\ninclude the 61 farms already declared infected, in which all pregnant\nanimals are to be culled (a measure already under application). The\nmonitoring system addresses farms with more than 50 lactating\nanimals. These make only part of the Dutch goat and sheep industries,\nwith a total of 350 000 goats and at least 1.2 million sheep (2008\nfigures; reportedly, there are also several hundred-thousand sheep\nkept in non-commercial holdings as 'hobby animals'). While most goats\nare milk producers, most sheep are kept for mutton production. The\ncurrent monitoring addresses only dairy sheep, the number of which\nbeing rather low (how many farms?). However, sheep are regarded, in\nmany countries, as the major Q fever reservoir, excreting the\npathogen mainly during the lambing season. Data on serosurveillance\nin Dutch sheep, and the number of dairy goat farms with less than 50\nanimals, will be of epidemiological interest.\n\nMore than 75 years following its initial discovery (in Hamilton,\nMontana, USA and in Melbourne, Queensland, Australia) there are still\nmany 'queries' regarding Q or query fever. These relate, mainly, to\nthe epidemiology of the disease in animals and man and to the\ncharacteristics of the microorganism.

Why are all pregnant animals on infected large dairy\nfarms culled, while those in small holdings and children's farms are\nnot? Is this not a double standard? The answer is: It seems so, but\nthere are good reasons for the distinction.\n\nAll control measures are considered from a public health point of\nview. During 2009, 2300 people became ill in the Netherlands from the\nQ fever bacterium. Therefore, everything is now focused on the aim to\nreduce this number as far as possible over the coming years.\n\nCulling in infected, large-scale holdings\n-----------------------------------\nThe greatest risk to public health is posed by large groups of\npregnant dairy goats and sheep, which excrete very large quantities of\nthe Q fever bacteria during normal birthing or abortions. This was\nindicated in the advice received from the expert group led by Roel\nCoutinho of RIVM (the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and\nEnvironment). If an infected goat gives birth to a live lamb, millions\nof Q-fever bacteria are released; in case of an abortion, their\nnumbers go into the billions.\n\nIn large farms, most matings are managed to take place within a short\nperiod, or mating is synchronised, leading to the birth of many\nanimals taking place during comparatively short periods, many on the\nsame days. Similarly, abortions, if occurring, may involve many\nanimals, sometimes taking the form of abortion 'storms.' In case those\nanimals are infected by Q fever, this means the excretion of very\nlarge quantities of bacteria by many animals simultaneously: This is\nthe greatest threat to public health. Consequently, the presence of\ninfected pregnant animals on the farm should be prevented ahead of the\nlambing season (which usually starts in January). Since individual\ntesting of animals in the short term is not possible, all pregnant\nanimals on infected farms should be culled.

Therefore, these holdings pose a lower risk to human\nhealth, and the pregnant animals on these farms are not culled.\n\nResearch shows that, so far, the Q fever bacterium has hardly ever\nbeen found in children's farms. Yet, visitors to petting farms where Q\nfever-infected sheep or goats are kept may always be exposed to some\nrisk of getting infected.\n\nThe RIVM-led expert group was asked to provide advice pertaining to\nthe said risk on petting farms or other small-scale holdings with less\nthan 50 animals. According to experts, it is generally not necessary\nto take additional measures concerning such holdings.\n\nHowever, it was recommended to pay special attention to hygiene on\nchildren's farms. In addition, children's ('petting') farms and\noccupational therapeutic farms are advised to let the birthing take\nplace in separate pens without pubic access. This will prevent contact\nbetween infected birthing or aborting animals and visitors, and the\nexcretion of bacteria close to visitors, and further diminish the risk\nof infection.\n\nFurthermore, it has been decided that petting and therapeutic farms\nwill be vaccinated with priority. Fortunately, there is vaccine enough\navailable for all such establishments.\n\nAdults and children visiting petting farms are advised to pay\nattention to hygiene.

Science 2010 Jan; 327(5963): 266-7]\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nIn the United States, Q fever is classified as a 'Category B'\nbioterrorism agent because it would be relatively easy to use and\nbecause, although not as deadly as anthrax or plague, attacks could\nstill create widespread disease and panic. The US Army exposed human\nvolunteers to it as part of its biowarfare program in the 1950s; the\nSoviet Union experimented with it as well, as did the Japanese cult\nAum Shinrikyo, known for its 1995 sarin attack. Bioterror worries\nbrought more attention to it in the 1990s and prompted the United\nStates to make it reportable in 1999. This increased awareness --\nalong with better diagnostic tests -- may explain the rising number of\nreported outbreaks of Q fever over the past 10 years worldwide, says\nepidemiologist Didier Raoult of the Universite de la Mediterranee in\nMarseille, France, the foremost expert in human Q fever. 'Once you\nstart looking for Q fever, you'll find more and more of it,' he says.\n\nBut what is going on in the Netherlands now is not just better\ndetection but something new and different, says epidemiologist Roel\nCoutinho, head of the Centre for Infectious Disease Control in\nBilthoven. When 182 human cases were detected in and around a town\ncalled Herpen in the summer of 2007, it seemed like a one-off\noutbreak. But in 2008, a new wave erupted, quickly filling up\nintensive-care units in the province of Noord-Brabant. A thousand\ncases were reported that year. In 2009, the number of new cases jumped\nto almost 2200, and the disease was found across the country. It is\nstill unclear what is behind the massive spread. Part of the reason\nhas to be the recent expansion of high-intensity goat farming in the\ndensely populated country, says Coutinho. The number of goats has\nquadrupled in Holland to more then 350 000 since 1995, and the number\nof them per farm has tripled; the country is now home to some of the\nbiggest goat farms in the world. (In a sad twist of fate, some farmers\nswitched to goats after a devastating swine flu outbreak ruined the\nDutch pig industry in the 1990s.) Farms are often close together, and\nanimals are frequently transported between them, presumably\nfacilitating spread, says Coutinho. Bacteria released during abortions\nend up in manure, which is often spread onto farm fields; the wind may\nhave carried them to the many surrounding towns and cities.\n\nBut Hendrik-Jan Roest, a scientist at the Central Veterinary Institute\nof Wageningen UR in Lelystad, says the sudden increase could be linked\nto a more virulent subtype of the microbe that started spreading in\nabout 2005. Genetic typing by Corne Klaassen at Canisius Wilhelmina\nHospital in Nijmegen has shown that all Dutch farms and patients are\ninfected by a single subtype of _C. burnetii_. That suggests that the\nstrain is somehow better at propagating itself than others, Roest\nsays. He plans to compare strains in a collaborative study with Annie\nRodolakis of the French National Institute for Agricultural Research\nin Tours, who has developed a mouse model of Q fever.\n\nA more urgent question is how to bring the outbreak under control. In\n2008, veterinary and public health authorities hoped that hygienic\nmeasures, such as a ban on distributing manure on farm fields, would\nhelp reduce human exposure. Now, the hope is that an animal vaccine\nproduced by CEVA, a French company, can help bring the microbe under\ncontrol. In short supply in 2008 and 2009, the vaccine will be\nplentiful this year [2010], says Christianne Bruschke, chief\nveterinary officer at the agriculture ministry. The vaccine does not\nprevent all infections, but it does prevent most abortions, which\nshould help curtail the spread of the disease. The vaccine does not\nwork in infected animals, however, which is why an expert panel\nrecommended in early December [2009] the emergency slaughter of all\npregnant goats at affected farms. (There is no reliable way to quickly\ndistinguish infected goats from healthy goats.) Bruschke says the cull\nis a one-time measure to prevent another massive release of microbes\nin the spring of 2010, when the goats would normally give birth. Then\nfrom 2011 on, the effects of the vaccine should start kicking in.\n\nThe impact on some farmers could be devastating, says Van Lokven. The\nDutch government reimburses farmers for the current value of the goats\nbut doesn't do so for the loss of income while they rebuild their\nflocks. How well the measure will work is unclear as well. The huge\nnumbers of _C. burnetii_ already in the environment may persist for\nmonths or years; there is no good way to measure their numbers or to\nassess the threat they pose, says Roest. And there are many other\nquestions. Although there is little doubt that goat farms are key\namplifiers in the current outbreak, the role of cattle farms is unclear.\n\nFor now, most experts say another surge of human cases this spring\n[2010] is inevitable -- they just hope it will be smaller than that of\n2009.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[2]\nDate: Fri 15 Jan 2010\nSource: Science Magazine [edited]\n<http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/summary/327/5963/266-b>\n(abstract; the full article requires a subscription)\n\n\n[Ref: Enserink M: Humans, animals -- It's One Health. Or is it?\nScience 2010 Jan; 327(5963): 266-7]\n---------------------------------------------\nA 'holistic approach' and 'synergism' working for the health of all\nspecies. Those are the buzzwords of the One Health movement, which\naims to bring veterinary and human health closer together. Because\npeople and animals form such a close-knit ecosystem -- and most new or\nre-emerging diseases come from animals -- the classic divide between\nveterinarians and doctors is hampering disease control, 3 scientists\nargued when they began promoting the concept 3 years ago (Science, 15\nJun 2007, p. 1553).\n\nBut the Dutch Q-fever outbreak provides a vivid example of how those 2\nworlds often don't get along, especially when the stakes are different\nfor each. Public health officials have complained that the veterinary\ncommunity didn't properly inform them and that the outbreak spiraled\nout of control in part because economic interests trumped human\nhealth. 'Sure, One Health, it's a nice concept, but we clearly have a\nlong way to go,' says Roel Coutinho, head of the Centre for Infectious\nDisease Control.\n\nWhat makes Q fever tricky is that the vast majority of animals are\nhealthy and asymptomatic, says French epidemiologist Didier Raoult of\nthe Universite de la Mediterranee in Marseille, France. The disease\ndoes trigger some abortion and premature birth, but the economic\ndamage is limited, so there's little incentive to do anything about an\noutbreak. 'The vets don't care about it,' says Raoult -- and human\nhealth suffers as a result.\n\nAnimal health authorities were slow to investigate suspected farms\neven as human cases started pouring into hospitals in 2008, says Jos\nvan de Sande, a doctor at a regional health service in Noord-Brabant,\nthe hardest-hit province. To protect farmers from stigmatization, van\nde Sande and his colleagues weren't told the exact location of\ncontaminated holdings, only the general area. 'You can't fight an\nepidemic like that,' he says. Coutinho adds: 'We just weren't able to\nget across how serious the human problem was getting.'\n\nChristianne Bruschke, the country's chief veterinary officer,\ndismisses those claims. From the onset, policy was set by a working\ngroup with members from both the agriculture and the health ministries\n-- and it included Coutinho and other scientists. 'They should have\nspoken up before if they disagreed,' says Bruschke. She says the\ngovernment had to strike a balance between farmers\u0092 interests and\npublic health in the face of insufficient data about how Q fever\nspread: 'You can't impose draconian measures on farmers if you have no\nidea whether they will have an effect.'\n\nThe Dutch government plans to investigate how the epidemic was\nhandled. Coutinho says one lesson is already clear: Veterinarians\nshould notify their colleagues in public health anytime a zoonotic\ndisease starts spreading in animals -- as Q fever did in 2005, 2 years\nbefore the human explosion began.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n\n[For the Dutch criteria for an outbreak, see further down in the cited\nEurosurveillance paper.\n\nReportedly, Q fever was diagnosed in 2005 as a cause of abortion at 2\ndairy goat farms. The numbers of outbreaks since 2005, reported to\nEU's Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health (SCFCAH)\non 12 Jan 2010, is as follows (for URL, see further):\n\nSection / 2005 / 2006 / 2007 / 2008 / 2009 / total\nDairy sheep / - / 1 / - / 1 / - / 2\nDairy goats / 2 / 6 / 7 / 7 / 4 / 26\n\nThe following description of the Q fever situation in Dutch goat and\nsheep, as of May 2009, is derived from the Eurosurveillance review,\nwritten jointly by public and animal health experts, covering both\naspects (Ref 1). The article was included in ProMED-mail's posting\n20090814.2889.\n\n'Veterinary situation\n---------------------\nThe total number of registered small ruminant farms in the Netherlands\nis 52 000, of which 350 are professional dairy goat farms with more\nthan 200 adult goats, and 40 are professional dairy sheep farms. In\n2005, Q fever was diagnosed for the 1st time as a cause of abortion at\na dairy goat farm, using immunohistochemistry on sections of placenta.\nA 2nd case was diagnosed later in 2005. In 2006, 2007 and 2008, 6, 7,\nand 7 new cases at dairy goat farms were confirmed, respectively,\nmainly in the same area where human cases occurred. In the same\nperiod, 2 cases of abortion caused by _C. burnetii_ were confirmed at\ndairy sheep farms, one in the southern and one in the northern part of\nthe country, but these 2 cases do not seem to be related to human\ncases. Analyses of abortion outbreaks showed that the average number\nof goats per farm was 900, of which 20 percent aborted, ranging from\n10-60 per cent. The average number of sheep on both infected sheep\nfarms was 400, and the abortion rate was 5 per cent.\n\nAbortion outbreaks before June 2008 were reported on a voluntary basis\nto the Animal Health Service and also confirmed by\nimmunohistochemistry. Since June 2008, notification of Q fever in\ngoats and sheep is mandatory in the Netherlands. There is a legal\nrequirement for farmers and their private veterinary surgeons to\nnotify the occurrence of abortion in small ruminants held in deep\nlitter houses. For large farms (greater than 100 animals), the\nnotification criterion is an abortion wave defined as an abortion\npercentage higher than 5 per cent among pregnant animals. For smaller\nholdings, a criterion of 3 or more abortions in a 30 day period is\nused. From January to April 2009, this new regulation has led to\nnotification of 3 dairy goat farms with clinical cases of Q fever. One\nfarm is located in the province of Overijssel (notified in February\n2009), one in the south of the province of Limburg (notified in March\n2009), and one in the province of Noord-Brabant (notified in April\n2009). This veterinary notification can potentially facilitate the\ndetection of related human cases or clusters. Veterinarians,\nphysicians, and the public are informed through targeted mailings,\npublications, and the media. The exact location of animal farms with\nclinical Q fever is now reported to the municipal health service. In\nFebruary 2009, a nationwide stringent hygiene protocol became\nmandatory for all professional dairy goat and sheep farms, independent\nof Q fever status.'\n\nThe evolution of the Q fever situation in the Netherlands since 2005\nis unprecedented in its public health implications. _C. burnetii_ has\nreportedly been spreading by air, affecting thousands of humans,\nincluding city dwellers who had not got closer than 1000 meters (0.6\nmi) or even more to the animals which are suspected to be the\nreservoir and amplifiers of the agent. In hindsight, investigators may\nnow suppose that active surveillance covering all goats, sheep (why\nexclude cattle?!) farms in North Brabant and Gelderland should have\nstarted in 2007, when the 1st human cases were reported. To the best\nof this moderator's knowledge, no such measure has been undertaken\nglobally elsewhere, in situations such as the one seen in 2007 in the\nsouth of the Netherlands; there are several descriptions of such\nscenarios. Q fever is known to cause abortions in small and large\nruminants globally (New Zealand is the known exception); human\ninfections with _C. Burnetii_ , allegedly of animal origin, have been\nrecorded in the past in various countries, but did not lead to\nwide-scale, compulsory, meticulous, active surveillance encompassing\nwhole regions or countries. In the unfortunate absence of\nclairvoyance, no such surveillance was undertaken before the epidemic\ntook its eventual dimensions. This, in difference with another,\n'classical' zoonosis, namely brucellosis, where 'test and slaughter'\npolicy, or 'modified stamping out', sometimes combined with or\nreplaced by vaccination, were the prescribed modus operandi. The\nbackground to this difference, and lessons to be learned, may be\nincluded in the shortly expected investigation of this exceptional\nevent.\n\nShould active surveillance be contemplated (selectively?) whenever\nanimals are suspected to harbour or spread a disease agent with\nzoonotic potential? An interesting question, with a broad spectrum of\ntheoretical and practical ramifications and far-reaching economical\nimplications.

But Hendrik-Jan Roest, a scientist at the Central Veterinary Institute\nof Wageningen UR in Lelystad, says the sudden increase could be linked\nto a more virulent subtype of the microbe that started spreading in\nabout 2005. The huge\nnumbers of _C. burnetii_ already in the environment may persist for\nmonths or years; there is no good way to measure their numbers or to\nassess the threat they pose, says Roest. But what is going on in the Netherlands now is not just better\ndetection but something new and different, says epidemiologist Roel\nCoutinho, head of the Centre for Infectious Disease Control in\nBilthoven. In the United States, Q fever is classified as a 'Category B'\nbioterrorism agent because it would be relatively easy to use and\nbecause, although not as deadly as anthrax or plague, attacks could\nstill create widespread disease and panic. There is a legal\nrequirement for farmers and their private veterinary surgeons to\nnotify the occurrence of abortion in small ruminants held in deep\nlitter houses. The disease\ndoes trigger some abortion and premature birth, but the economic\ndamage is limited, so there's little incentive to do anything about an\noutbreak. ' The\nDutch government reimburses farmers for the current value of the goats\nbut doesn't do so for the loss of income while they rebuild their\nflocks. The US Army exposed human\nvolunteers to it as part of its biowarfare program in the 1950s; the\nSoviet Union experimented with it as well, as did the Japanese cult\n This, in difference with another,\n'classical' zoonosis, namely brucellosis, where 'test and slaughter'\npolicy, or 'modified stamping out', sometimes combined with or\nreplaced by vaccination, were the prescribed modus operandi. The\nbackground to this difference, and lessons to be learned, may be\nincluded in the shortly expected investigation of this exceptional\nevent. The total number of registered small ruminant farms in the Netherlands\nis 52 000, of which 350 are professional dairy goat farms with more\nthan 200 adult goats, and 40 are professional dairy sheep farms. In 2006, 2007 and 2008, 6, 7,\nand 7 new cases at dairy goat farms were confirmed, respectively,\nmainly in the same area where human cases occurred. Q Fever in the EU - Update on Public Health context after the\nrecent reports of clusters of Q Fever human cases in The Netherlands\n3. \n\nWhat makes Q fever tricky is that the vast majority of animals are\nhealthy and asymptomatic, says French epidemiologist Didier Raoult of\nthe Universite de la Mediterranee in Marseille, France. For large farms (greater than 100 animals), the\nnotification criterion is an abortion wave defined as an abortion\npercentage higher than 5 per cent among pregnant animals. In short supply in 2008 and 2009, the vaccine will be\nplentiful this year [2010], says Christianne Bruschke, chief\nveterinary officer at the agriculture ministry. Farms are often close together, and\nanimals are frequently transported between them, presumably\nfacilitating spread, says Coutinho. Bruschke says the cull\nis a one-time measure to prevent another massive release of microbes\nin the spring of 2010, when the goats would normally give birth. Abortion outbreaks before June 2008 were reported on a voluntary basis\nto the Animal Health Service and also confirmed by\nimmunohistochemistry. Sure, One Health, it's a nice concept, but we clearly have a\nlong way to go,' says Roel Coutinho, head of the Centre for Infectious\nDisease Control. When 182 human cases were detected in and around a town\ncalled Herpen in the summer of 2007, it seemed like a one-off\noutbreak. Analyses of abortion outbreaks showed that the average number\nof goats per farm was 900, of which 20 percent aborted, ranging from\n10-60 per cent. But the Dutch Q-fever outbreak provides a vivid example of how those 2\nworlds often don't get along, especially when the stakes are different\nfor each.", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "brucellosis", "plague", "q fever"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["1995-03-25 00:00:00", "2007-03-25 00:00:00", "2008-06-25 00:00:00", "2021-03-06 00:00:00", "1553-03-25 00:00:00", "1999-03-25 00:00:00", "2011-03-25 00:00:00", "2021-03-07 00:00:00", "2009-05-25 00:00:00", "2009-04-25 00:00:00", "2008-03-25 00:00:00", "2010-01-25 00:00:00", "2010-01-12 00:00:00", "2010-01-15 00:00:00", "2009-02-25 00:00:00", "2009-03-25 00:00:00", "2005-03-25 00:00:00", "2021-05-14 00:00:00", "2006-03-25 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "France", "country": "France"}, {"location": "Marseille", "country": "France"}, {"location": "New Zealand", "country": "New Zealand"}, {"location": "the \n Netherlands", "country": "Netherlands"}, {"location": "Netherlands", "country": "Netherlands"}, {"location": "Lelystad", "country": "Netherlands"}, {"location": "Nijmegen", "country": "Netherlands"}, {"location": "Soviet Union", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "the United \n States", "country": "United States"}, {"location": "Holland", "country": "Netherlands"}, {"location": "Tours", "country": "France"}, {"location": "Brussels", "country": "Belgium"}, {"location": "the United States", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "eurosurveillance", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Limburg", "country": "Netherlands"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "358010", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Q fever - Netherlands (20): goats, OIE", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=358010", "date": "2009-12-30 14:00:05", "main_text": "Q FEVER - NETHERLANDS (20): GOATS, OIE\n**************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\n<http://www.promedmail.org>\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\n<http://www.isid.org>\n\nDate: 29 Dec 2009\nSource: OIE WAHID Disease Information 2009; 22(53) [edited]\n<http://www.oie.int/wahid-prod/public.php?page=weekly_report_index&admin=0>\n\n\nQ fever, Netherlands\n\nInformation received on 29 Dec 2009 from Mr Peter W. de Leeuw, Chief\nVeterinary Officer, Food Quality and Animal Health, Ministry of\nAgriculture, Nature and Food Quality, LA HAYE, Netherlands\n\nSummary\nReport type: Immediate notification\nStart date 1 Oct 2009\nDate of 1st confirmation of the event 12 Nov 2009\nReport date 29 Dec 2009\nDate submitted to OIE 29 Dec 2009\nReason for notification: New strain of a listed disease\nManifestation of disease: Clinical disease\nCausal agent: Unknown\nNature of diagnosis: Clinical, Laboratory (basic), Laboratory (advanced)\nThis event pertains to the whole country\n\nNew outbreaks\nOutbreak 1 Waspik, NOORD-BRABANT\nDate of start of the outbreak 1 Oct 2009\nOutbreak status: Continuing (or date resolved not provided)\nEpidemiological unit: Farm\n\nSpecies Goats\nSusceptible 567\nCases 314\nDeaths 0\nDestroyed 314\nSlaughtered 0\n\nSummary of outbreaks: Total outbreaks: 1\nOutbreak statistics\nSpecies Goats\nApparent morbidity rate 55.38 percent\nApparent mortality rate 0.00 percent\nApparent case fatality rate 0.00 percent\nProportion susceptible animals lost* 55.38 percent *Removed from the\nsusceptible population through death, destruction and/or slaughter\n\nEpidemiology: Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection.\nUnknown or inconclusive\n\nEpidemiological comments There are 61 outbreaks of Q fever at this\nmoment in the Netherlands.

(1997). Chapter 26 In:\nMedical Aspects of Chemical and Biological Warfare (Sidell FR,\nTakafugi ET, Franz DR, eds). Washington, DC:TMM Publications,\n1997;523-537. This is a concise history; a comprehensive one is to be\nfound in the 1990 CRC book mentioned above.\n\nHistory\n-------\nQ fever was 1st described in 1937 by Edward Derrick,(17) while he was\nthe Director of Microbiology and Pathology for the Queensland\n(Australia) Health Department at Brisbane. In 1935, he was contacted\nabout a febrile illness that had been occurring among abattoir\nworkers in Brisbane. When routine blood cultures and serologic\ntesting did not reveal a diagnosis, Derrick suspected that he was\ndealing with a new illness. He thoroughly described the clinical\ncharacteristics and designated the disease Q (for query) fever.\nDerricks laboratory investigation demonstrated that it was possible\nto transmit the disease to animals by inoculating guinea pigs and\nmice with the blood of humans suffering from acute Q fever. Although\nDerrick had initially concluded that the infectious agent was a\nvirus, studies of a guinea pig liver emulsion sent to MacFarlane\nBurnet in Melbourne subsequently indicated that the causative\norganism was a rickettsia,(18) according to the terminology used at that time.\n\nInterestingly, Derrick may not have been the 1st to transfer the\ndisease to laboratory animals. Hideyo Noguchi, working at the\nRockefeller Institute in New York City in 1925, may have passed _C\nburnetii_ to guinea pigs from ticks that had been collected at Saw\nTooth Canyon by Ralph Parker at the Rocky Mountain Laboratory in\nHamilton, Montana.(19) This agent, however, was ultimately lost in\nanimal passage.\n\nAbout the same time that the investigations were being done in\nAustralia, Gordon Davis was studying Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever at\nthe Rocky Mountain Laboratory. He observed that a febrile illness\nresulted when ticks collected from the area around the nearby Nine\nMile Creek were allowed to feed on guinea pigs.(20) The disease\nproduced in guinea pigs did not, however, resemble Rocky Mountain\nSpotted Fever. Herald Cox was subsequently able to characterize the\norganism (then called the Nine Mile Agent) as similar to rickettsia\nand to cultivate this organism in the yolk sac membrane of\nembryonated hen eggs. (21) The relation of Q fever to the Nine Mile\nAgent was established by Rolla Dyer, director of the National\nInstitutes of Health at the time, after the spleens of infected mice\nwere sent to him by Burnet. In an event that presaged the problems of\ntransmission of Q fever in laboratory workers, Dyer himself acquired\nacute Q fever during a visit to Hamilton in 1938.(22)\n\nThe work of Ralph Parker, also at the Rocky Mountain Laboratory,\nindicated that ticks are the reservoir of the Nine Mile Agent.\nDerrick had also suspected tick transmission from a primary\nreservoir, and from a secondary reservoir of domestic animals. The\nsignificance of exposure to parturient animals was not, however,\nrecognized until 1950.\n\nThe causative agent of Q fever was ultimately designated _Coxiella\nburnetii_ to recognize the outstanding contributions of both Cox and\nBurnet to the isolation and characterization of this new pathogen.(23)\n\nReferences\n----------\n17.

Hideyo Noguchi, working at the\nRockefeller Institute in New York City in 1925, may have passed _C\nburnetii_ to guinea pigs from ticks that had been collected at Saw\nTooth Canyon by Ralph Parker at the Rocky Mountain Laboratory in\nHamilton, Montana.(19) The causative agent of Q fever was ultimately designated _Coxiella\nburnetii_ to recognize the outstanding contributions of both Cox and\nBurnet to the isolation and characterization of this new pathogen.(23)\n\nReferences\n This was proposed by the\nVaarkamp-Ohl committee, the welfare committee which has been\nappointed to watch over the measures against Q fever and their\nanimal-welfare-wise responsible application. Burnet\nwas able to passage Derrick's isolates in mice in 1935 in Melbourne,\nVictoria, and demonstrated rickettsial-like inclusions in spleens and\nfound it to be a filter-passing 'virus' (also reported in MJA 1937). The relation of Q fever to the Nine Mile\nAgent was established by Rolla Dyer, director of the National\nInstitutes of Health at the time, after the spleens of infected mice\nwere sent to him by Burnet. Herald Cox was subsequently able to characterize the\norganism (then called the Nine Mile Agent) as similar to rickettsia\nand to cultivate this organism in the yolk sac membrane of\nembryonated hen eggs. The combination: 1st anesthesia, then euthanasia by an experienced\nteam of workers of the Food and Goods Authority in collaboration with\nthe private farm's veterinarian, seems the preferable mode for\nculling of goats from a welfare perspective. Although\nDerrick had initially concluded that the infectious agent was a\nvirus, studies of a guinea pig liver emulsion sent to MacFarlane\n -------\nQ fever was 1st described in 1937 by Edward Derrick,(17) while he was\nthe Director of Microbiology and Pathology for the Queensland\n(Australia) Health Department at Brisbane.

The SCH would like to inform the public\nthat the disease is currently restricted to the Netherlands.\nTherefore it is not a disease that causes any concern right now,'\nsaid the statement.\n\nQ-Fever is not a new disease and it was reported before in all\ncontinents. In 2009 around 2300 people around the world were infected\nwith Q-Fever with 6 fatalities, added the statement.\n\nThe disease usually infects veterinarians, meat workers, dairy\nworkers and farmers. The disease is caused by a species of bacteria\nknown as _Coxiella burnetii_ which comes out of cattle, sheep, goats\ncats, dogs and some wild animals.\n\nDirect transfer of the disease from a human being to another is rare;\nhowever clothes of an infected person may transmit the disease.\nSymptoms are shown in high fever, severe headache, malaise, myalgia,\nconfusion, sore throat, chills, sweat, non-productive cough, nausea,\nvomiting and stomach and chest pain.\n\nAntibiotic treatment is quite effective, namely doxycyclin. This\ntreatment is most effective during the 1st 3 days of the illness.\nAfter full recovery the person may gain permanent immunity against\nthe disease in the future.\n\nQ-Fever outbreaks occur mainly due to occupational exposure involving\nveterinarians, meat processing plant workers, sheep and dairy\nworkers, livestock farmers and researchers at facilities housing\nsheep.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The culling of pregnant goats in the infected goat holdings in the\nNetherlands is continuing in a pace of 3 holdings per day; as of Mon\n28 Dec 2009 the operation was completed in 12 of the 61 infected\nholdings.\n\nAuthorities in neighbouring Belgium, where, so far, 7 goat or sheep\nholdings have been found Q-fever infected, have intensified their\npreparedness, and are keeping an open eye for developments.

Later during the\nmorning the Queen spoke, in the town of Gemert-Bakel, with Q-fever\npatients, a physician and a representative of the Regional Public\nHealth Service. Because most of the genotypes differ only by a single\nrepeat difference, they might represent microvariants of a\nhypervirulent strain that has been introduced in the Dutch animal\npopulation.' promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The culling of pregnant goats in the infected goat holdings in the\nNetherlands is continuing in a pace of 3 holdings per day; as of Mon\n28 where, so far, 7 goat or sheep\nholdings have been found Q-fever infected, have intensified their\npreparedness, and are keeping an open eye for developments. The disease is caused by a species of bacteria\nknown as _Coxiella burnetii_ which comes out of cattle, sheep, goats\ncats, dogs and some wild animals. Symptoms are shown in high fever, severe headache, malaise, myalgia,\nconfusion, sore throat, chills, sweat, non-productive cough, nausea,\nvomiting and stomach and chest pain. On Tue 29 Dec 2009 the Dutch Veterinary Services submitted to the OIE\ntheir 1st ('initial' and 'immediate') notification on the Q fever\noutbreak. The Belgian Food Safety agency also took measures to safeguard the\nadequate pasteurisation of sheep and goat milk before entering the\ndairy plants.

How many goats are there in the Netherlands?\nDuring 2008, there were about 350 000 goats [on commercial farms. -\nMod.AS]. These animals are not kept exclusively on goat farms; many cattle\nfarms keep goats as well, as a side-line business. In addition, several\nhundred thousand goats are kept as 'hobby animals'.\n2. How many dairy goats are there in the Netherlands?\nAbout 250 000\n3. How many sheep are there in the Netherlands?\nDuring 2008 there were about 1 200 000 sheep in the Netherlands. These\nanimals are not kept exclusively on sheep farms; many cattle farms keep\nsheep as well, as a side-line business. In addition, several hundred\nthousand sheep are kept as 'hobby animals.'\n4. How many dairy sheep are there in the Netherlands?\nThere are few dairy sheep farms in the Netherlands, including a total of\nseveral thousand animals. Besides, no dairy sheep farms are infected by Q\nfever [it would help if this last statement were officially confirmed. -\nMod.AS].\n5. How many farms are infected?\nBased upon the results of the bulk milk tests, it has been established that\nthe Q fever bacterium is present on 55 dairy goat farms. 43 of them\nvaccinated during 2009 against Q fever; 1 farm is situated outside the\nvaccination area. [for updated data, see item 1 above. - Mod.AS].\n6. When is a farm declared as infected?\nA farm is declared infected when repeated bulk milk tests, performed by\nboth the VWA (Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority) and CVI (Central\nVeterinary Institute), are found positive.\n7. How can I, as a citizen, know if a farm is infected?\nInfected farms are banned for visitors. The farms themselves must make this\nknown. Only persons who are required to visit the farms due to their\nprofessional obligations, are allowed to enter infected premises. The state\nauthorities publish the areas within which infected farms are present. Once\nin 2 months, geographic maps are published on the websites of the VWA and\nRIVM (Institute for Public Health and the Environment).\n8. Is Q fever an occupational disease?\nQ fever is a disease which appears more often in animal holders,\nveterinarians and slaughterhouse personnel. But Q fever appears also in\npeople who have no connection to animals. Anyone can get infected by\ninhaling air which includes the bacterium.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[According to a press release of the Dutch Ministry of Agriculture, dated\n16 Dec 2009, the total number of animals in the 55 infected farms is around\n64 000 dairy goats, of which over 34 000 are pregnant animals and over 1200\nare bucks. The 5 farms found now infected and added to the 55 list, are\npart of 16 hitherto 'suspected' farms with 17 500 animals (including 10 000\npregnant animals and 350 bucks), of which results were expected this week.\nIt would be interesting to know if the remaining 11 'suspected' farms have\nbeen found to be uninfected or otherwise. According to the press release,\nthe expectation is that during the coming few months, bulk-milk testing\nwill discover new infected farms.\n\nIt would be helpful to know the total number of dairy goat and dairy sheep\nfarms which have been already tested, at least once, by the bulk milk (PCR)\ntests. If, as the Q&A item tells, dairy goats are also kept on mixed farms\n(with cattle), and if the non-commercial goat sector includes a total\nnumber of animals which seems to be of approximate size as the commercial\nsector ('hundred thousand'), the Dutch veterinary authorities have a huge\ntask on their hands.\n\nIn a previous posting on Q fever in the Netherlands, we referred\nsubscribers to a Dutch SCFCAH presentation on the issue, dated May 2009.

Following a recommendation by the National\nInstitute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM), they decided\nto order all pregnant goats slaughtered on contaminated farms.\n\nQ-fever first appeared in the Netherlands in 2007. It is caused by\ninfection with the _Coxiella burnetti_ bacterium, which can be found\nin cattle, sheep, goats or domestic animals. It is easily released\nwhen a pregnant infected animal miscarries because of the disease.\n\nIn humans, Q-fever can cause permanent heart problems.

The disease has spread across a third of the\nNetherlands. Q fever in humans causes flu-like symptoms and can lead\nto pneumonia. In some cases it leads to death. This year [2009] alone\n2200 people have contracted it, most of them in the southern rural\nprovince of Brabant, and at least 6 people have died.\n\nTo prevent further spread of the disease, goats are to be vaccinated.\nAgriculture minister Gerda Verburg says, 'This is not a voluntary\nmeasure. All measures are geared towards human health. An aborted goat\nis a pity for a farmer, but it is starting to affect humans.' The\nresults of this measure will not be visible until next year [2010].\nThe cabinet also wants to prevent farms where animals have Q fever\nfrom expanding.

This was reported by the Animal Health Service in Deventer.\nConfirmation of tests will take another 2 weeks. Measures will not be\napplied until 4 weeks from now.\n\nSo far this year 4 goat farms in the Netherlands were officially declared\ncontaminated, based on a former detection method. A farm was considered\ninfected only if the percentage of abortions was larger than 5 per cent.\nHowever, it appears that the agriculture ministry knew that another 41\nfarms had infected goats, based on milk sample tests. No measures were\napplied to these farms. In sheep farms Q fever is rare. From 40 farms, only\none proved infected.\n\nQ fever is a serious zoonosis, that causes not that severe problems in\ngoats, but has high morbidity in people with serious symptoms: fatigue,\nhigh fever, serious headaches, severe pneumonia, sometimes resulting in\nhospitalization and even death. The causal agent is _Coxiella burnetii_,\nwhich spreads through air. The bacteria is particularly dangerous in case\nof pregnancy or heart valve abnormalities.\n\nIn the Netherlands, the outbreak started in 2007 in Herpen, a village in\nthe south of the country, and since then the disease has spread every year.\n6 people died. This year 2100 people were infected. It is the largest\noutbreak of Q fever ever reported in the world.\n\nControlling the disease is difficult, because the bacteria does not\ndisappear from the soil. Until now, measures consisted of prohibition of\nspreading out manure and moving animals from infected farms.\n\nResults of vaccination are still being investigated by the Animal Health\nService. The vaccine seems to prevent abortion and animals produce\nsufficient antibodies, but it is not clear yet whether excretion of\nbacteria is prevented.

Cases,\nthough not numerous, are now being recorded also from other parts of the\nNetherlands, including northern provinces. This can be seen in the map\nshowing the spread of the 2193 human Q fever cases recorded this year (1\nJan-30 Sep 2009) available at\n<http://www.rivm.nl/cib/binaries/Qkoorts_per_gemeente_tcm92-60500.pdf#%20class=>.\nThe total number of human patients since the start of the outbreak in\nsummer 2007, as of 30 Sep 2009, exceeds 3350. This has become the largest Q\nfever epidemic ever reported globally.\n\nBrowsing through recent Dutch animal and public health publications\nunravels some expressions of discontent, in particular related to the steps\nundertaken to contain infection in animals. The situation has been\naddressed, among others, in several recent publications of the Royal Dutch\nVeterinary Society (KNMvD).\n\nA main obstacle in the handling of the disease in animals is the fact that,\nwhile exposing humans, the disease has -- so far -- not caused serious\ndirect losses to the farming industry. Animal vaccination has, therefore,\nbeen more a matter of public health than animal health concern. A KNMvD\nnewsletter, dedicated to the recently published new measures (as detailed\nin posting 20090927.3380) includes the following statement: 'Ministers\nKlink [public health] and Verburg [agriculture] intend to reduce the number\nof human cases by these measures, but they warn against excessive optimism\nin the short term: a reduction in the number of Q-fever patients is not\nexpected in 2010, at most, stabilization is expected. This is related to\nthe fact that the animal vaccine, while in state to prevent mass abortions\non the animal holdings, thus eliminating a significant source of infection,\nis not capable of suppressing the disease altogether. Another point of\nsignificance is the fact that the Q fever bacterium will survive in the\nenvironment among dust particles.' The Society encouraged practitioners to\nstimulate their client-farmers to report even sporadic abortions in sheep\nand goats. Obviously, such stimulation is not sufficient if farmers fear\nresulting repercussions.\n\nSubscribers may consider viewing the presentation 'Q-fever in the\nNetherlands - Vaccination strategy, 2009' of the Dutch Veterinary Services,\npresented by Christianne Bruschke during the 5-6 May 2009 monthly meeting\nof EU's Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health (SCFCAH),\n(ANIMAL HEALTH & ANIMAL WELFARE).

Since 2007 human cases of the disease have risen\nsharply in the Netherlands to more than 2000 in 2009, according to\nthe National Institute for Public Health on its website.

The new approach is aimed at\nmaintaining the freedom from Q fever of those dairy goats and sheep\nfarms throughout the Netherlands not yet infected, and the\nrehabilitation of the Q fever-infected farms.\n\nWe assume that by addressing the main sources of infection in sheep\nand goats, the Q-fever epidemic in humans is to be controlled.\n\nBulk tank milk monitoring\n------------------------\nStarting 1 Oct 2009, holders of more than 50 dairy goats or sheep\nwill be obliged to participate in the Q-fever monitoring. For this\npurpose, each farm will be sampled once in 2 months for Q-fever\ntesting. Suspected/positive samples will be forwarded for\nconfirmatory testing to the Central Veterinary Institute (CVI). If\nconfirmed, those farms will be declared infected.\n\nMeasures applied in infected farms\n----------------------------------\nHygienic measures:\n\nPending the outcome of the ongoing investigation into improved manure\nhandling procedures, the current, published measures are to be\nmaintained. This means that throughout the lambing season and up to\n30 days after its termination, no manure is permitted to be mucked\nout. The spread of manure in the fields will be allowed only after\nadditional 90 days of storage under cover.\n\n- Exit of animals:\nAnimals are not allowed exit to other farms for milk production or breeding.\nThe transportation of animals to slaughterhouses is permitted.\nAnimals under the age of 4 weeks are allowed transportation to fattening units.\n\n- Introduction of animals:\nInfected farms are allowed to introduce only vaccinated animals from\nQ fever-free farms.\n\n- Visits ban:\nNo visitors are allowed on infected premises.\n\n- Vaccination:\nInfected farms must vaccinate all their animals.\n\nMeasures applied in free holdings:\n------------------------------------\n- There are no restrictions upon the handling/use of manure, or upon\nexit of animals from free holdings.\n\n- Introduction of animals is allowed only from Q fever-free holdings.\n\n- Vaccination: Free holdings should be vaccinated.\n\nPolicy regarding the fate of infected farms:\n-------------------------------------------\nInfected Dairy goats and sheep farms may regain their free status\nafter a year of negative bi-monthly bulk tank milk test results. This\nperiod is relatively long due to uncertainties concerning the pattern\nof excretion of the Q-fever pathogen and the role thereupon of the\nlambing season.\n\nPilot studies, aiming at the identification of additional measures to\nobtain early eradication of the disease on infected farms, have been\nundertaken by the CVI and the Animal Health Service (GD).\n\nManure treatment:\n----------------\nAs stated in the letter of 28 Aug 2009, industrial composting of\nmanure was to be experimentally investigated as an alternative to its\nincineration.

The difference\nis the way we keep our goats with herds of 5000 in open stables, concrete\nfloor, where the farmer adds a little straw every day and removes\neverything (including previously deposited placentas) 2 or 3 times a year.\nThe open stables assist the wind in blowing _Coxiella_ into the outside\nenvironment. In a herd of 5000 you can easily miss a few abortions. The\ntypical abortion storm is regularly seen (10-20 per cent of pregnancies\nending in abortion), and reported. But we miss hundreds of abortions that\noccur in less than 5 per cent of pregnancies (reportable if abortion rate\nis over 5 per cent). In a herd of 5000 no obligation to report 1 to 259\nabortions.\n\nThe vaccination started in 2008 with, at that time, all available vaccine\n(40 000 doses). In 2009, there is still a shortage but now over 190 000\ndoses have been bought and are being administered now by the public health\nvets. This is still not enough for the 350 000 goats in the country.\nAmazingly enough, the 1.1 million sheep are not (as yet) suffering any\nabortions (and no problems at all are seen in cattle).\n\nThe area is covered by a thin layer of _Coxiella_ built up in 3 years,\nwhich will undoubtedly infect humans again next year [2009] under certain\nweather conditions. We'll see large numbers of human cases next year, even\nif the abortion rate were lowered substantially.\n\n--\nJim van Steenbergen\nCoordinator, Communicable Disease Control\nNetherlands National Institute for Public Health and the Environment\nDutch: Rijksinstituut voor Volksgezondheid en Milieu (RIVM)\nBilthoven, Netherlands\n<Jim.van.Steenbergen@rivm.nl>", "summary": "A ProMED-mail post\n<http://www.promedmail.org>\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\n<http://www.isid.org>\n\nDate: Sat 27 Jun 2009\n Jim van Steenbergen\nCoordinator, Communicable Disease Control\nNetherlands National Institute for Public Health and the Environment\nDutch: Rijksinstituut voor Volksgezondheid en Milieu (RIVM)\n The difference\nis the way we keep our goats with herds of 5000 in open stables, concrete\nfloor, where the farmer adds a little straw every day and removes\neverything (including previously deposited placentas) 2 or 3 times a year.

The following Eurosurveillance Rapid Communication was\nwritten jointly by public and animal health experts, covering both aspects.\n- Mod.AS]\n\nSince 1978, when Q fever in humans became a notifiable disease in the\nNetherlands, until 2006, the number of notifications had ranged between one\nand 32 cases annually, with an average of 17 cases per year. However, in\n2007, Q fever emerged as an important human and veterinary public health\nchallenge, with large epidemics in the southern part of the Netherlands. In\n2007, 168 human cases were notified, and in 2008 exactly 1000 human cases\nwere registered. Notification criteria for acute Q fever are a clinical\npresentation with at least fever, or pneumonia, or hepatitis and\nconfirmation of the diagnosis in the laboratory. Currently, the laboratory\ncriteria are a 4-fold rise in IgG antibody titre against _C. burnetii_ in\npaired sera or the presence of IgM-antibodies against phase II antigen.\nIdentification of _C. burnetii_ in patient material with a PCR test will\nsoon be added to the notification criteria. Notification of probable cases,\ndefined as clinical signs with a single high antibody titre is voluntary.\n\nCurrent situation\n-----------------\nFrom April 2009, a sharp increase in Q fever was observed again, and a\ntotal of 345 cases (including 13 probable) were notified between 1 Jan and\n11 May 2009. For 11 cases, the date of illness onset was in 2008, and one\ncase fell ill in 2007, resulting in a total of 333 cases with confirmed or\npresumed illness onset in 2009. The overall male-to-female ratio for these\n333 cases was 1.7:1 with a median age of 49 years (IQR 38-61 years). The\nepidemic curve for 2009 shows an even steeper increase in case numbers in\nApril-May than in the previous 2 years, suggesting that an epidemic of at\nleast the same magnitude as the one in 2008 is imminent. While most cases\nreside in the same region in the province of Noord-Brabant as the cases\nreported in 2007 and 2008, the geographic area seems to be expanding [map\nfor 2007-2008 at\n<http://www.eurosurveillance.org/images/dynamic/EE/V13N31/Qfever_Netherlands_Figure3.jpg>;\nmap for 2009 (May) at\n<http://www.eurosurveillance.org/images/dynamic/EE/V14N19/Q_Fever_Fig2.jpg>.\n- Mod.AS].\n\nSeparate clusters with multiple sources\n---------------------------------------\nIt is becoming increasingly clear that the overall outbreak consists of at\nleast 10 separate clusters with multiple sources, mainly in the province of\nNoord Brabant. For some clusters, a clear epidemiological link could be\nestablished to small ruminant farms with clinical Q fever cases in animals\npresented as abortion waves. For other clusters, such a link was less\nobvious. An example of the latter is a medium sized city (87 000\ninhabitants) that experienced a 2nd Q fever outbreak in 2009 similar to the\none in 2008. In 2008, a dairy goat farm with abortions due to Q fever was\nsuspected as the source, but in 2009 there were no veterinary notifications\nfrom the area. The 73 notified human cases residing in the city were\nclustered in the same part of the city as the cases that were notified in\n2008. It remains unclear whether the same source is involved, whether the\nbacteria have persisted and survived in the local environment, whether the\nprimary source in 2008 has resulted in secondary sources in 2009, or\nwhether there is increased awareness among health professionals in this\npart of the city based on the 2008 experience.\n\nIn March 2009, the Animal Health Service reported a Q fever positive farm\nin the province of Limburg with more than 1000 goats. The place also serves\nas a care farm for young people with mental disabilities who work there as\npart-time farmhands. Prompted by this notification, the municipal health\nservice (MHS) South Limburg performed active laboratory screening by ELISA\nof the individuals affiliated to this goat farm. The screening, which\ninvolved a total of 96 people, has resulted in 28 notified symptomatic\ncases to date.\n\nVeterinary situation\n--------------------\nThe total number of registered small ruminant farms in the Netherlands is\n52 000, of which 350 are professional dairy goat farms with more than 200\nadult goats, and 40 are professional dairy sheep farms. In 2005, Q fever\nwas diagnosed for the 1st time as a cause of abortion at a dairy goat farm,\nusing immunohistochemistry on sections of placenta. A 2nd case was\ndiagnosed later in 2005. In 2006, 2007 and 2008, 6, 7 and 7 new cases at\ndairy goat farms were confirmed, respectively, mainly in the same area\nwhere human cases occurred. In the same period, 2 cases of abortion caused\nby _C. burnetii_ were confirmed at dairy sheep farms, one in the southern\nand one in the northern part of the country, but these 2 cases do not seem\nto be related to human cases. Analyses of abortion outbreaks showed that\nthe average number of goats per farm was 900, of which 20 percent aborted,\nranging from 10-60 per cent. The average number of sheep on both infected\nsheep farms was 400, and the abortion rate was 5 per cent.\n\nAbortion outbreaks before June 2008 were reported on a voluntary basis to\nthe Animal Health Service and also confirmed by immunohistochemistry. Since\nJune 2008, notification of Q fever in goats and sheep is mandatory in the\nNetherlands. There is a legal requirement for farmers and their private\nveterinary surgeons to notify the occurrence of abortion in small ruminants\nheld in deep litter houses. For large farms (greater than 100 animals), the\nnotification criterion is an abortion wave defined as an abortion\npercentage higher than 5 per cent among pregnant animals. For smaller\nholdings, a criterion of 3 or more abortions in a 30 day period is used.\nFrom January to April 2009, this new regulation has led to notification of\n3 dairy goat farms with clinical cases of Q fever. One farm is located in\nthe province of Overijssel (notified in February 2009), one in the south of\nthe province of Limburg (notified in March 2009), and one in the province\nof Noord-Brabant (notified in April 2009). This veterinary notification can\npotentially facilitate the detection of related human cases or clusters.\nVeterinarians, physicians and the public are informed through targeted\nmailings, publications and the media. The exact location of animal farms\nwith clinical Q fever is now reported to the municipal health service. In\nFebruary 2009, a nationwide stringent hygiene protocol became mandatory for\nall professional dairy goat and sheep farms, independent of Q fever status.\n\nVaccination campaigns\n---------------------\nIn the fall of 2008, a voluntary vaccination campaign was implemented in\nthe province of Noord Brabant. In total, about 36 000 small ruminants were\nvaccinated in an area with a radius of 45 km around Uden, a small town in\nthe centre of the high-risk area. Another mandatory vaccination campaign\nled by the Animal Health Service (GD) started on 21 Apr 2009. From April to\nOctober 2009, 200 000 small ruminants will be vaccinated in an area which\nincludes the province of Noord-Brabant and parts of the provinces of\nGelderland, Utrecht and Limburg.\n\nConclusion\n----------\nFor the 3rd consecutive year, the Netherlands is facing a large outbreak of\nQ fever. The new upsurge in Q fever cases in 2009 is alarming. The\nmandatory vaccination campaign among small ruminants that was started in\nApril 2009, if effective, is expected to reduce the occurrence of abortion\nwaves and excretion of _Coxiella_ in the lambing season of 2010. There is a\nlarge portfolio of ongoing multidisciplinary research, but it will take\nsome time before results become available that eventually will lead to the\nimplementation of extended and improved control measures.\n\n[byline: B Schimmer, F Dijkstra, P Vellema, P M Schneeberger, V Hackert, R\nter Schegget, C Wijkmans, Y van Duynhoven, W van der Hoek.

Q fever, an\ninfectious disease, which is transmitted to humans [usually] via\ncontact with sheep and goats, is caused by the _Coxiella burnetii_\nbacterium. It can cause fever and even pneumonia.\n\nUsually, only between 5 and 20 cases are reported a year, but in 2007\na major outbreak occurred in a village near the town of Oss, where\naround 170 fell ill.\n\nThis year [2008], the number has risen to 497 from all across the province.\n\nThe health authorities say they have no explanation for the sudden\nincrease in the number of infections, adding that they doubt whether\nthe outbreak has been brought under control.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[2]\nDate: Fri 25 Jul 2008\nSource: Netherlands Info Services (NIS) News Bulletin [edited]\n<http://www.nisnews.nl/public/250708_2.htm>\n\n\nThe outbreak of Q fever in the Netherlands is unique in the world.\nThis is the conclusion of scientists following an international\nconference held by the National Institute for Healthcare ad the\nEnvironment (RIVM) in partnership with the Health Council.\n\n'Experts from Canada, France, Germany, Denmark, Sweden, and the\nNetherlands participated in the meeting. Via the exchange of\nexperiences it came to light that the situation in the Netherlands is\nunique in the world,' according to the RIVM. 'There have also been\noutbreaks of Q fever in other countries, but not in such an extended\nand densely populated area as at present in the province of\nNoord-Brabant.'\n\nQ fever occurred sporadically in the Netherlands before 2007. But in\n2007, the number of cases climbed to 497, of which 369 were in\nNoord-Brabant, many around the town of Oss.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[ProMED-mail previously posted regarding the earlier part of this\noutbreak in 2007 (Q fever - Netherlands (Noord-Brabant, Gelderland)\n20070809.2592). As discussed below, the organism, often acquired by\nclose exposure to animals, is infectious with a very low inoculum and\nmay be aerosolized over a distance. It is not clear what contact the\ninfected people had with animals or how close they were to farms.\n\n_Coxiella burnetii_, the causative agent, was discovered in 1937.\nThis organism is an agent that can be resistant to heat and\ndesiccation, and is highly infectious by the aerosol route. A single\ninhaled organism may produce clinical illness. Indeed, in [non-human]\nprimates, the dose to kill 50 percent of the primates was found to be\n1.7 organisms (1).\n\nCattle, sheep, and goats are the primary reservoirs of _C. burnetii_.\nInfection has been noted in a wide variety of other animals,\nincluding other species of livestock and in domesticated pets. _C.\nburnetii_ does not usually cause clinical disease in these animals,\nalthough abortion in goats and sheep has been linked to _C. burnetii_\ninfection. Organisms are excreted in milk, urine, and feces of\ninfected animals. Most importantly, during birthing the organisms are\nshed in high numbers within the amniotic fluids and the placenta.\nContact with contaminated wool is known to be a mode of transmission\n(2).\n\nThe organisms can be resistant to heat, drying, and many common\ndisinfectants. These features enable the bacteria to survive for long\nperiods in the environment. This very stable form of _C. burnetii_ is\nassociated with compact small cell variants of the organism that are\nproduced during standard replication along with the less resistant\nlarge cell form, metabolically dormant, and spore-like (3).\n\nInfection of humans usually occurs by inhalation of these organisms\nfrom air that contains airborne barnyard dust contaminated by dried\nplacental material, birth fluids, and excreta of infected herd\nanimals. Humans are often very susceptible to the disease, and very\nfew organisms may be required to cause infection.\n\nIngestion of contaminated milk, followed by regurgitation and\ninspiration of the contaminated food, is a less common mode of\ntransmission. Other modes of transmission to humans, including tick\nbites and human-to-human transmission, are rare.\n\nReferences\n----------\n1.

Cattle\nand small ruminants, in particular sheep and\ngoats, have been associated with large human\noutbreaks. Humans become infected primarily by\ninhaling aerosols that are contaminated by _C.\nburnetii_. Most infections remain asymptomatic\nbut in about 40 percent lead to a febrile\ndisease, pneumonia and/or hepatitis. Chronic\ninfections, mainly endocarditis, are observed in\n3 to 5 percent of cases, with an increased risk\nfor pregnant women and persons with heart valve\ndisorders or impaired immunity. Q fever in\npregnancy, whether symptomatic or asymptomatic,\nmay also result in adverse pregnancy outcomes\n(1). Q fever in humans is a notifiable disease in\nThe Netherlands. The notification criteria for a\nconfirmed case is a positive serology defined by\nimmunofluoresence assay (IFA) test or a _C.\nburnetii_ complement fixation test (2). Also\nclinical patients diagnosed by PCR are considered\nas confirmed cases. Between 1997 and 2006, Q\nfever was notified rarely with an average of 11\n(range 5-16) cases annually [3). In 2007, we\nreported in this journal the 1st community\noutbreak of Q fever in the south of The\nNetherlands (4).\n\nCurrent situation\n-----------------\nWe report a 2nd large outbreak of Q fever that\nstarted in the 1st half of 2008. Since the spring\nof 2008, a marked increase in notified Q fever\ncases has been observed with a total of 677 cases\nnotified up to 24 Jul 2008 in OSIRIS, an\ninternet-based reporting system for notifiable\ninfectious diseases in The Netherlands. Of these\ncases, 17 had illness onset in 2007, 546 in 2008,\nwhile for the remaining 114 recently notified\ncases the date of illness onset is still unknown.\nThe majority of cases reported illness onset\nbetween week 18 and 24, similar to the outbreak\nin 2007 (Figure 1 [for figures see original URL -\nMod. LL]). The overall female to male ratio is\n1:1.7. The age distribution in 2008 ranges\nbetween 7 to 87 years (IQR 41-60 years, median 51\nyears) and is similar to the age distribution in\n2007 (Figure 2). The preliminary hospitalization\nrate of cases in 2008 was 22 percent compared\nto 43 percent during the same period (week 1-28)\nin 2007.\n\nOf the cases with illness onset in 2008 for whom\ninformation on symptoms was available (n=300), 94\npercent reported fever, followed by fatigue (89\npercent), night sweating (78 percent), headache\n(71 percent) and general malaise (63 percent). 65\npercent of the cases with known symptoms had\npneumonia. So far, no pregnancy has been reported\namong notified cases.\n\nAlthough the 2008 epidemic is located in the same\npart of the country as the outbreak in 2007, it\nis more widespread in the province of\nNoord-Brabant and expanded to the adjacent\nprovince of Gelderland (Figure 3). This area is\nknown for its large density of dairy goats. 75\npercent of the cases notified in 2008 reside in\none municipal health service region. Within this\nregion, several distinct clusters of Q fever have\nbeen observed in rural municipalities with\ncumulative incidences as high as 14 acute _C.\nburnetii_ infections per 1000 inhabitants (Figure\n3). The outbreak is ongoing but the numbers seem\nto decrease in the entire Q fever affected area.\n\nControl measures and new legislation\n------------------------------------\nSince 2007, Q fever has become an important\npublic health problem in The Netherlands,\nwarranting a continuous enhanced surveillance.\nEfficient data sharing between public health\ninstitutions and veterinary health partners on\nregional and national level is a prerequisite for\ntimely and thorough source tracing and\nidentification. Following the 2007 outbreak, an\ninformal agreement was made that the veterinary\nand the public health sectors would exchange\ninformation on farms with newly diagnosed animal\ncases of Q fever to allow for an adequate\nresponse and control. On 3 Jun 2008, an outbreak\nmanagement team was convened and recommended a\nmandatory notification of Q fever in ruminants.\nIn the same month this recommendation was\nimplemented by the Dutch Ministry of Agriculture\nand the Ministry of Health; farmers and\nveterinarians have to report symptoms compatible\nwith Q fever, usually abortion waves, in small\nruminants held in deep litter houses. In\naddition, a ban to spread manure during the 3\nmonths following the detection of Q fever at the\nfarm and a restriction for visitors at the and\nfarm were imposed (5,6).\n\nThe current situation has also led to public\nhealth questions about the need for screening of\npregnant women for Q fever and exclusion of blood\ndonations from individuals in affected regions.\nOn 22 Jul 2008, an international expert meeting\nwas organized by the National Institute for\nPublic Health and the Environment (RIVM) and the\nHealth Council of The Netherlands, with\nparticipation of the European Centre for Disease\nPrevention and Control (ECDC), to address these\nimportant issues. The outcome of this meeting\nwill be reported separately.\n\nDiscussion\n----------\nThis is by far the largest community outbreak of\nQ fever ever reported in the literature. Other\nEuropean countries such as Denmark and Germany\nhave also reported a changing epidemiology of Q\nfever and an increase in cases in 2008 but not to\nthe same extent as in The Netherlands (7,8). The\nsharp increase in cases in the spring and the\nwidespread pattern of this community outbreak\nwith more than 600 cases reported in 2008 is\nalarming. This high number of notified cases is\npartly explained by an increased awareness of Q\nfever among general practitioners (GP),\nspecialists and medical microbiological\nlaboratories, especially in the region where the\n2007 outbreak occurred. We hypothesize that this\nhas also led to a different diagnostic approach\nand earlier diagnosis of suspected cases, leading\nto less hospital admissions in the notified\ncases. Signals from rural GP practices indicate,\nhowever, that there is an unprecedented marked\nand striking increase in pneumonia and signs and\nsymptoms associated with Q fever in their patient\npopulation [personal communication].\n\nTo date there has been no conclusive evidence as\nfor the source(s) of the epidemic. Although a\nsingle animal source can cause many human Q fever\ncases (9), the larger geographic area in which\ncases occur in 2008, compared to 2007, points at\nmultiple sources. Several studies to assess the\nrisk factors for Q fever in the general\npopulation, high-risk groups, and in ruminants\nare ongoing or starting in the near future\nincluding source investigations focusing mainly\nat small ruminant farms and pet farms.\n\nWe hope through this paper to raise awareness of\nthis problem and inspire colleagues from other\nEuropean countries to report whether they have\nobserved similar increase in Q fever case numbers\nand share their experience.\n\nReferences\n----------\n1.

'These preliminary\nresults have been expected,' says veterinarian\nPiet Vellema of the GD. The final results are\nexpected early next year [2009].\n\nVellema calls it remarkable that only in the\nsouth of the country there are [heavily] infected\nfarms, and that human infections are limited to\nthat area. 'It is not clear how the\ncontamination on holdings took place. Possibly,\nan animal carrier had been present in the flock\nfor extended period before wider spread occurred'\n[This is indeed a possible mechanism of Q fever's\ndynamics, when wider infection follows a\nparturition or abortion of a single or few\ninfected silent carrier(s). - Mod.AS]\n\nThere are also holdings that have not suffered\nabortions in spite of the presence of animals\ninfected with _Coxiella burnetii_. 'The\npossibility exists that other species play a role\nin the dissemination of the bacterium, since it\nis not species-specific.

The age distribution in 2008 ranges\nbetween 7 to 87 years (IQR 41-60 years, median 51\nyears) and is similar to the age distribution in\n2007 [This is indeed a possible mechanism of Q fever's\ndynamics, when wider infection follows a\nparturition or abortion of a single or few\ninfected silent carrier(s). The Ministry of Agriculture will investigate,\nin a short term, whether the vaccination of goats\nagainst Q fever is useful and possible.\n Q fever in\npregnancy, whether symptomatic or asymptomatic,\nmay also result in adverse pregnancy outcomes\n Vellema calls it remarkable that only in the\nsouth of the country there are [heavily] infected\nfarms, and that human infections are limited to\nthat area. ' The notification criteria for a\nconfirmed case is a positive serology defined by\nimmunofluoresence assay (IFA) test or a _C.\nburnetii_ complement fixation test (2). However, the percentage of animals with\nantibodies [outside the infected provinces, in\nthe South] has been low, as demonstrated by the\nresults of blood tests. ' Possibly,\nan animal carrier had been present in the flock\nfor extended period before wider spread occurred'\n For the longer term, it was decided that RIVM\nwill make proposals for further studies into the\nroutes of transmission to man from the\nenvironment and from animals. The\npossibility exists that other species play a role\nin the dissemination of the bacterium, since it\nis not species-specific.

An investigation\nwas launched to describe the outbreak, find the source and route of\ntransmission, identify symptomatic and asymptomatic pregnant patients who\nare more likely to contract chronic Q fever (1) in the most affected area,\nand investigate possible links to animal reservoirs in the region in order\nto decide on appropriate control measures.\nAs Q fever is a rarely reported disease in the Netherlands, a broad case\ndefinition was used:\n- a confirmed case of Q fever was defined as any inhabitant of the\nNetherlands presenting to a GP with clinical symptoms consistent with Q\nfever since 1 Jan 2007 and who had laboratory confirmed positive serology\ndefined as a seroconversion or 4-fold increase of antibody titre using a\n_C. burnetii_ CFT (home-made complement fixation test using phase 1 and 2\nantigens) in samples taken at least 14 days apart, or showing positive for\nphase 2 IgM antibodies in the _C. burnetii_ IFA (Focus diagnostics) with a\n1:64 or greater dilution.\n- a probable case definition was also introduced only for an area in the\neast of the Noord Brabant region, where more cases were clustered, to\nbetter describe the outbreak there. Probable cases had clinical symptoms\nconsistent with Q fever and either a less than 4-fold increase in phase 2\nIgM within 14 days, or a single serum sample positive for phase 2 IgM\nantibodies in a dilution of 1:20 or greater.\n- in all cases, infection with _Legionella_ spp. was excluded.\nQ fever is caused by _Coxiella burnetii_, an intracellular bacterium. It is\nan almost worldwide appearing zoonosis whereby goats, sheep, and cattle\nhave been described as the most common animal reservoir for human\ninfections. Many Q fever outbreaks worldwide are temporally linked to the\nlambing season, as birth products from infected animals can be an important\nsource of environmental contamination and transmission to humans via the\naerosol route (2). At least 3 outbreaks of Q fever have been documented\nworldwide since January 2007: in the United Kingdom (3), Slovenia (4), and\nAustralia (5).\nIn the Netherlands, 5-20 cases of Q fever have been reported annually\nbetween 2000 and 2006 (6). From 1 Jan 2007 until 2 Aug 2007, 63 confirmed\nand probable cases with Q fever have been reported to the municipal health\nservices throughout the Netherlands; 59 of them were in the provinces of\nNoord Brabant and Gelderland, of which 36 were confirmed according to the\nused case definition. Among the 59 cases in these provinces, 27 were living\nin a well-defined area in the eastern part of Noord Brabant. It should be\nnoted that retrospective active case finding was initiated in the latter\narea for patients with a GP consultancy after 15 May 2007 to better\ndescribe the cluster of cases there. The overall male to female ratio is\n1.67 and the median age is 50 years. Date of symptoms onset is currently\navailable for 47 of all patients. The peak of case occurrence was in week\n21 [21-27 May] of 2007. According to the data available including week 30\n[23-29 Jul 2007], the last case had a symptoms onset in week 26 (figure,\nsee original URL. - Mod.LL)\nA trawling questionnaire was used to generate hypotheses about the possible\nsource of the outbreak in eastern Noord Brabant area. The municipal health\nservice undertook active case finding through the GP offices in this area,\nwhere about 11 500 inhabitants reside. The area is highly agricultural with\na large population of ruminants (cattle, sheep, and goats). The number of\ngoats has been reported to be increasing during the last decade in this\nregion, as has the degree of intensive goat farming (7); moreover, there\nhave been active reports of abortion waves due to _C. burnetii_ infection\namong the goat population in 2006 and 2007. Meteorological factors may also\nhave played a role in this outbreak setting, but this remains to be\ninvestigated. April [2007] was a very dry month; only 1.5 mm (0.06 in) of\nprecipitation fell in the nearby weather station of Eindhoven between 22\nMar 2007 and 6 May 2007, while the average precipitation value for April\nalone is 42 mm (1.7 in). Weather conditions, such as dry weather and wind,\nhave been documented to play an important role in other Q fever outbreaks\n(8,9).\nThis is the 1st documented outbreak of Q fever in the Netherlands, and it\nis currently under investigation. So far, only sporadic cases and family\nclusters related to direct animal contact had been observed here. It is\nalso an example of local GPs signalling an outbreak in the Netherlands,\nunderlining their role in early warning of outbreaks, before\nlaboratory-confirmed cases are reported to the health services.

This has\nled to unrest among local people. With this letter we will bring you\nup to date with additional precautionary measures that we will\nundertake to prevent the spread of Q-fever as much as possible.\n\nQ-fever\n-------\nQ fever is a disease caused by the bacterium _Coxiella burnetii_. It\nis a zoonotic disease, which means that spread from animals to humans\ncan take place. Q fever is traditionally present around the world and\nmay affect many species -- not only farm animals but also species\nsuch as birds, dogs, cats, rats and wild animals. Ticks can be a\nvector in the transmission of Q fever\nbetween animals.\n\nIn particular, small ruminants are regarded as a major source of\ninfection for humans. After excretion, the bacterium can survive a\nlong time in the air and sometimes spread over long distances. People\ncan be infected through various routes, including the inhalation of\ninfectious, airborne particles. Human infection is often manifested by\nmild symptoms but a more serious course may occur.\n\nThe main clinical sign of Q fever in ruminants is abortion in\npregnant animals, caused by the bacterium. During and after the\nabortion the animals excrete large quantities of the bacteria in\ntheir manure.\n\nSmall ruminants intended for milk production are held mainly in\nso-called pen barns. A pen barn is a shed where the manure is covered\non a regular basis with a new layer of straw. When the mixture of\nmanure and straw reaches a certain height, the shed is emptied.\nEspecially during the manure removal process, bacteria are shed into\nthe air with the consequent risk for both the public and animal\nhealth. Possibly, the spreading of manure on land is also a risk\nfactor, but this procedure seems to be of less significance than the\nremoval process of manure from the pen barns. This difference became\napparent since manure from Noord Brabant farms has been used as\nfertilizer in other provinces without harmful results in humans.\n\nInitiatives undertaken\n----------------------\nFollowing the 2007 Q-fever outbreak in Herpen, Noord-Brabant, some\nsteps were agreed between the Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport\n(VWS) and the Ministry of Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality (LNV)\nto obtain better insight regarding the Q-fever problem and to\nprevent, as far as possible, its spread to man. In this framework,\nadvisory information on the hygiene measures to be applied in\nsmall-ruminant farms has been prepared and published on the sites of\nthe Health, Welfare and Sports Ministry, the Agriculture Ministry,\nand the Animal Health Service (GD).\n\nResearch by the Health Services has been undertaken in both large and\nsmall ruminant sectors to obtain better understanding of the extent\nof the problem. This research is funded by both sectors and by the\ngovernment. There is also research under way into the risk factors for\nthe spread of Q-fever.\n\nThe relevant research institutes, namely the National Institute of\nHealth and Environment (RIVM), the Central Veterinary Research\nInstitute (CVI) and the Health Service (GD) are also in the process\nof development and validation of testing methods suitable for the\ndetection and identification of the bacterium.\n\nFinally, a research initiative is ongoing regarding intervention\nstrategies. Special attention is paid to a vaccine which is currently\nbeing tested in Denmark and France, considering its possible\nexperimental application in the Netherlands as well.\n\nDesignating Q fever as an infectious, reportable animal disease\n---------------------------------------------------------------\nIn order to be able to apply preventive and control measures on animal\nholdings, Q fever should be designated a reportable infectious animal\ndisease. Indeed, this has been carried out by the Minister of\nAgriculture, adding Q fever to the list of animal diseases (including\nzoonoses) for which compulsory prevention, control and monitoring are\nregulated. Holders of small ruminants kept in pen barns are required\nto report signs which may indicate Q fever. This requirement obliges\nthe veterinarians as well.\n\nMeasures regarding manure\n-------------------------\nExperts agree that manure probably plays an important role in the\ndissemination of the Q-fever agent in the province of Noord Brabant.\n\nAs a meaningful, provisional measure based on the precautionary\nprinciple, we plan to ban, for the duration of 3 months, the use of\nmanure from small ruminant holdings in pen barns where serious\ninfection has been established. A period of 3 months is regarded\nsufficient for a significant reduction of the infection load in the\nmanure. Since the removal of manure from the pen barns is unavoidable\nas soon as the installation runs full, a practical solution is to be\nsought and finalized soon.\n\nOther measures and consultations\n--------------------------------\nIn addition to the specific measures for the treatment of manure on\ninfected holdings, further sector-related advice will be given in\norder to prevent future spread of Q fever. One of the ideas is to\nprescribe an advanced timetable for an earlier-in-season spreading of\nmanure in the fields, preceding the lambing season. The aim is to\nprevent the utilization of the manure until at least 3 months after\nthe lambing season, allowing significant reduction of its infection load.\n\nHoldings with small ruminants are often frequented by recreation\nvisitors and others interested. Contacts of people with infected\npremises are also undesirable. Temporarily preventing visits to such\nholdings seems to us advisable.\n\nThere are also a certain number of sheep and goat farms which produce\ntheir own cheese. This is often made with raw milk. The consumption of\nraw products from infected farms is discouraged by the RIVM (National\nInstitute for Healthcare and the Environment). It seems therefore\nprimarily useful to prescribe pasteurization in certain cases. The\nMinister for Health, Welfare and Sport will take these measures in\nconsultation with RIVM.\n\nWith the above mentioned steps we try to limit, as far as possible,\nthe spread of Q fever. The measures are aimed at the earliest\npossible action to diminish the risk of further spread. The\ndevelopment of the policy is being continued.\n\n[Byline:\nG. Verburg, Minister of Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality, and\nDr. A. Klink, Minister of Health, Leisure and Sport]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The above ministerial letter, addressed to the Dutch parliament,\nprovides interesting and useful information on the epidemiology of the\ndisease in the Netherlands and the preventive and control measures\nundertaken. It is also useful for those engaged in any handling of\nemergency situations related to zoonotic diseases. Hopefully, action\nplans and contemplated research will be accomplished according to plan.\n\nIn our previous posting (see ProMED archive below), data on the\ndisease incidence from different media sources were inconsistent; we\nare grateful to Naomi Bryant, National Travel Health Network and\nCentre (NaTHNaC), for drawing our attention to that.

The 1st cases\nappeared during week 3, remaining under 10/week until the 15th week,\nwhen it began to rise, peaking during week 22 (72 cases). During the\nweeks 27-28, the number is again below 10; the outbreak seems to be\ndying out. The said data can be found (in Dutch) at\n<http://www.rivm.nl/cib/infectieziekten-A-Z/infectieziekten/Q_koorts/FAQ_Q-koorts.jsp#index_35>.\n\nAccording to the said website, prior to 2007 the mean annual number\nof human Q fever cases, on national level, was 15. Since the disease\nin animals was not reportable, there is no information on its\nincidence in animals during the said years.

Kasrioui\nacknowledges that it is difficult to make policies aimed at Q fever\nbecause much remains unclear about the disease. ' Especially during the manure removal process, bacteria are shed into\nthe air with the consequent risk for both the public and animal\nhealth. Since the disease\nin animals was not reportable, there is no information on its\nincidence in animals during the said years. A period of 3 months is regarded\nsufficient for a significant reduction of the infection load in the\nmanure. Since the removal of manure from the pen barns is unavoidable\nas soon as the installation runs full, a practical solution is to be\nsought and finalized soon. It\nis a zoonotic disease, which means that spread from animals to humans\ncan take place. One of the ideas is to\nprescribe an advanced timetable for an earlier-in-season spreading of\nmanure in the fields, preceding the lambing season. A letter from the Ministers of Agriculture and of Health to the Parliament\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIntroduction\n Ticks can be a\nvector in the transmission of Q fever\nbetween animals. During and after the\nabortion the animals excrete large quantities of the bacteria in\ntheir manure. This difference became\napparent since manure from Noord Brabant farms has been used as\nfertilizer in other provinces without harmful results in humans. The disease spread\nrapidly in Noord-Brabant and, to a lesser extent, in the Nijmegen\nregion. The source indicates that\nthe main animal species responsible for the current outbreak are\ngoats, followed by sheep. During the\nweeks 27-28, the number is again below 10; the outbreak seems to be\ndying out. People\ncan be infected through various routes, including the inhalation of\ninfectious, airborne particles. Special attention is paid to a vaccine which is currently\nbeing tested in Denmark and France, considering its possible\nexperimental application in the Netherlands as well. The consumption of\nraw products from infected farms is discouraged by the RIVM (National\nInstitute for Healthcare and the Environment). The\nMinister for Health, Welfare and Sport will take these measures in\nconsultation with RIVM.

He said\nthe 30 Jun 2007 order applies to every agent the lab works with. The\nlist of affected agents is not public information because of security\nconcerns, Roebuck said. In the letter, the CDC outlined the concerns\nit has about the lab, which include the adequacy of biosafety plans,\nsecurity of the facility from unauthorized visitors, occupational\nsafety protocols, authorization from the CDC to work with certain\nagents, and compliance with federal select agent regulations.\nRoebuck said CDC officials would visit the Texas laboratory again in\nthe next few weeks to gather more information about its procedures\nand protocols. 'Then the agency will move forward with any\nrecommendations to get them under compliance,' he said.\nIn a statement sent to Texas A&M faculty and staff on Fri 29 Jun\n2007, the school's interim president, Eddie J.

He said the University believed that the threshold for\nreporting worker exposure was a confirmed illness.\n'We are unequivocally committed to taking all appropriate steps to\nensure we are in full compliance with all CDC and any other relevant\npolicies and regulations,' he said.\n_Coxiella burnetii_ causes an influenza-like disease in humans that\nis rarely fatal, according to the CDC. However, it is highly\ninfectious when it becomes airborne and is inhaled by humans.

Euro Surveill 2007; 12(7): E070719.1]\nA group of 33 veterinary students and 2 teachers contracted a\nlaboratory-confirmed Q fever infection during a training course on a\nsheep farm in Slovenia in March 2007. The disease is caused by\n_Coxiella burnetii_, an intracellular bacterium found worldwide in\nvarious species of farm and domestic animals.\nOutbreak investigation\n----------------------\nOn 17 Apr 2007, the Communicable Disease Centre at the National\nPublic Health Institute was informed about a case of Q fever in an\n18-year-old student of a veterinary high school. The patient had\ndeveloped high fever and a severe headache on 30 Mar 2007. Chest\nx-ray showed pneumonia. The student reported that her classmates in\nthe same school year had been complaining about similar symptoms.\nWe suspected that the patient and her schoolmates might have been\nexposed to a common source of Q fever when attending a training\ncourse on a sheep farm (Farm A) located in the southwestern part of\nSlovenia in March 2007 (1). An epidemiological investigation was\nlaunched involving all 3rd grade students of the veterinary high\nschool.\nEpidemiological and clinical data\n---------------------------------\nThe patient's high school year has 66 students. As part of their\ntraining, 45 of the students spent several hours between 5 and 23 Mar\n2007 on Farm A, together with 3 teachers. They were trimming sheep's\nfeet, disinfecting wounds, and applying intramuscular vitamins and\nanti-helminthic injections as a preventive measure to healthy animals\nin a stable with approximately 500 sheep. Parturition time of the\nsheep on Farm A was from end of January to beginning of March this\nyear [2007].\nWe interviewed all individuals who had been at Farm A, and tested\nthem for Q fever. In addition, 20 students who had not participated\nin the training course in March 2007 were included as a control\ngroup. One student from the control group had spent a short time on\nFarm A in autumn 2006. All interviewed individuals (68 altogether)\nhad been in contact with different domestic animals at home and\nduring school training courses at several locations.\nAmong 48 exposed individuals, there were 34 (71 percent) with fever\n(38 deg C (100.4 deg F) (or more) with or without a headache; 4\nindividuals (8 percent) had serious headaches only, but were not sure\nabout fever, and 3 individuals (6 percent) reported symptoms of a\ncommon cold; 7 individuals (15 percent) were asymptomatic. The 1st\nperson to develop symptoms of fever and headache started to feel ill\non 20 Mar 2007.\nAmong the 20 control subjects (including the student who had spent a\nshort time on the sheep farm in autumn 2006), 3 students reported\nhaving a prolonged cough, and one had symptoms of a common cold; 16\n(80 percent) students were completely asymptomatic.\nLaboratory investigation\n------------------------\nSerum samples were collected from 63 individuals (93 percent of the\n68 interviewees) and sent to the Institute of Microbiology and\nImmunology, Medical Faculty in Ljubljana. They were tested by\nindirect immunofluorescence (FOCUS diagnostics) for the presence of\nIgG and IgM antibodies to _C. burnetii_ phase I and II antigens. A\nlaboratory-confirmed case of acute Q fever was defined as an\nindividual with IgM titers higher than 1:16 and/or IgG titers higher\nthan 1:256.\nOverall, the results confirmed acute Q fever in 36 individuals (57\npercent of the 63 tested). Serum samples from 26 individuals (41\npercent) were negative and the test result of a single sample was\ninconclusive.\nOf a total of 48 individuals who were exposed on Farm A in March\n2007, 44 were tested and 35 of those (80 percent) were seropositive.\nThey are shown in the Figure by date of onset of symptoms. [To see\nthe figure, go to the original URL. - Mod.LL]\nOf 44 individuals tested, 8 exposed individuals (18 percent) were not\ninfected, and one had an inconclusive result. In the control group,\nnone was seropositive, except for the student who visited the sheep\nfarm in autumn 2006. The serology results of exposed versus\nnon-exposed individuals are summarised in the Table [refer to\noriginal URL. - Mod.LL]\nAmong the 36 laboratory-confirmed cases (35 exposed in March 2007 and\none exposed in autumn 2006), 4 were asymptomatic, while the other 32\n(89 percent) suffered from high fever, headache, chills, muscle\naches, sweating, and nausea; 25 patients (69 percent) consulted a\nphysician, and 3 (8 percent) developed radiologically confirmed\npneumonia. Although 13 cases (36 percent) were given antibiotic\ntreatment, only 6 (16 percent) received adequate antibiotic therapy\nwith doxycycline, a fluoroquinolone or a macrolide drug. At the time\nthe treatment was initiated, the laboratory results indicating Q\nfever infection were not known.\nConclusion\n----------\nThe data analysis showed a significant statistical correlation\nbetween a positive serological test for _C. burnetii_ and attendance\nat the training course on the sheep farm in March 2007 (p value less\nthan 0.001). There was no significant statistical correlation between\na positive test and attendance at school training courses in other\nplaces or contact with domestic animals at the students' homes. We\nconcluded that the sheep farm was the source of the Q fever outbreak.\nOutbreak control measures\n-------------------------\nThe 1st Q fever outbreak among humans in Slovenia was mentioned in\n1954. In 1985, 2 outbreaks were described. The source of one was\ncontact with a sheep herd; the other occurred among workers at a\ntannery, who were probably exposed through contact with sheep hides\n(2). Further outbreaks due to contact with infected sheep were\nreported in 1991 and 1992 (3,4). Between 1996 and 2005, between 0 and\n5 Q fever cases were notified [annually] in Slovenia (5).\nThe Communicable Disease Centre at the National Public Health\nInstitute was collaborating with regional epidemiologists from\nLjubljana and Koper, and with the veterinary high school and faculty\nof Ljubljana on the outbreak investigation. Further collaboration\nwith the Department for Infectious Diseases and the Health\nInspectorate at the Ministry of Health, and the Veterinary Office at\nthe Ministry of Agriculture resulted in a cascade of public health\nand veterinary measures.\nPublic health measures:\n-suspension of all student training courses and visits to the sheep farm;\n-ban on selling dairy products from the sheep farm;\n-improvement of sanitary conditions on the sheep farm;\n-serological testing of farm employees;\n-workplace risk reassessment (farm employees, forestry workers in the\nvicinity), in process;\n-serological testing of students who had been trained on the sheep\nfarm in 2007, final results expected;\n-clinical and serological follow up of seropositive human cases, in process.\nVeterinary measures (6):\n-serological testing of animals at the sheep farm (to date 60 percent\nseropositive animals);\n-re-introduction of Q fever monitoring in small and large ruminants\nproposed by the Veterinary Chamber;\n-vaccination of animals considered, vaccine procurement in process.\nThe regions endemic for Q fever have never been determined in\nSlovenia. A joint research project is planned by public health and\nveterinary scientists to investigate the burden of disease in animals\nand humans, to determine endemic areas of Q fever in order to develop\na sufficient basis for workplace risk assessments, and to determine\nthe risk for the general population.\nReferences\n----------\n1.

Some 25 workers have been\ntaken ill at the Scotbeef factory in Bridge of Allan, 11 of whom have\nbeen diagnosed with the disease.\nWhile 4 men received treatment in hospital for the flu-like illness,\nmany more of the plant's 250 workers are awaiting the results of\nblood tests.\nQ fever can result in chronic infection if not treated swiftly with\nantibiotics. The disease is caused by the organism _Coxiella\nburnetii_, which lives in farm animals such as sheep, cattle and\ngoats as well as wild animals and ticks. Airborne infection is\npossible for those who work in close contact with farm animals.\nScotbeef now believes the 11 workers caught the disease from an area\nof the plant where lambs are held before they are slaughtered.\nThe meat plant remained open yesterday, 20 Jul 2006, but the lamb\narea was undergoing deep disinfection.\nAdam Muggoch, managing director of Scotbeef, said: 'The number of\ndiagnoses of Q fever may still go up. We are still waiting for the\nresults of blood tests on the remainder of the staff. However, we are\nseeing a steady decline in the number of absences through illness.'\nScotbeef, he said, has begun plans to redesign the layout of the lamb\nlayerage area. He added: 'We are very concerned for our staff and we\nwill do whatever we can to limit the risk of infection.'\nProfessor Hugh Pennington, an Aberdeen-based expert in microbiology,\nsaid: 'It is always a possibility that people have been infected who\nhave not shown symptoms. But it only takes a simple blood test to\ndetect the fever. I think the likelihood of a chronic infection is\nvery low, because the outbreak was quickly diagnosed.'\nA Forth Valley Health Board spokeswoman said the outbreak is of\nlittle risk to the wider public because Q fever is rarely transmitted\nfrom person to person.\nThere is only 'a small theoretical risk of contracting Q fever by\nairborne spread within a half-mile radius of the plant,' she said.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[ProMED thanks Pablo Nart for alerting us to this outbreak.\nTransmission of the organism to the workers is thought to have\noccurred from exposure to the live lambs through aerosolization of\ninfectious materials. Although the infectious form is relatively\nstable, infection spread over any distance is quite unlikely.\nAlthough meat could be contaminated, it is not thought to be a common\nvehicle for transmission to humans. As noted, person-to-person\nspread is quite rare but has been reported. A Russian outbreak\nrelated to contaminated wool was posted by ProMED in 2005.\nThis review of the epidemiology of Q fever has been extracted from an\nexcellent CDC source\n<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvrd/qfever/index.htm>:\n'Cattle, sheep, and goats are the primary reservoirs of _C.\nburnetii_. Infection has been noted in a wide variety of other\nanimals, including other species of livestock and in domesticated\npets. _Coxiella burnetii_ does not usually cause clinical disease in\nthese animals, although abortion in goats and sheep has been linked\nto _C. burnetii_ infection. Organisms are excreted in milk, urine,\nand feces of infected animals. Most importantly, during birthing the\norganisms are shed in high numbers within the amniotic fluids and the\nplacenta.\nThe organisms are resistant to heat, drying, and many common\ndisinfectants. These features enable the bacteria to survive for\nlong periods in the environment. Infection of humans usually occurs\nby inhalation of these organisms from air that contains airborne\nbarnyard dust contaminated by dried placental material, birth fluids,\nand excreta of infected herd animals. Humans are often very\nsusceptible to the disease, and very few organisms may be required to\ncause infection. Ingestion of contaminated milk, followed by\nregurgitation and inspiration of the contaminated food, is a less\ncommon mode of transmission. Other modes of transmission to humans,\nincluding tick bites and human-to-human transmission, are rare.\nThe incubation period for Q fever varies depending on the number of\norganisms that initially infect the patient.

All those with symptoms were screened\nfor a range of pathogens and results from blood samples tested at the West\nof Scotland Specialist Virology Centre confirmed the illness as Q fever.\nSince then an epidemiological investigation has been undertaken including\nscreening of all staff working at the plant. 9 patients had been admitted\nto hospital by 18 Jul 2006. By 4 Aug 2006, 51 cases for which the initial\nIgM result was greater or equal to 256 had been identified. The\ninvestigation continues.\nThere is a risk of contracting Q fever by airborne spread especially within\na half-mile radius of a source. The plant is not situated near to\nresidential buildings, but is close to a road with much vehicular traffic.\nEnhanced surveillance was begun to identify cases in the surrounding\ncommunities. All public health authorities in the country were alerted. So\nfar no cases have been identified in individuals who do not work at the\nplant. Control measures including shutting down of the putative source and\ncleaning and disinfection have been put in place.\nQ fever is an uncommon zoonotic infection caused by an organism called\n_Coxiella burnetii_. In the United Kingdom (UK), the organism is most\ncommonly found in infected farm animals, especially sheep, cattle and\ngoats, it may also be found in cats and wild animal species such as birds,\nrodents or bats; in some countries it is also carried by ticks.\nTransmission of _C. burnetii_ to humans occurs primarily through inhalation\nof aerosols or dust contaminated with feces or urine, or from direct\ncontact with infected animals or their products of conception, or at\nslaughter. It may also be acquired from drinking unpasteurized milk. It is\nextremely rare for the infection to be passed from person to person. The\ninfective dose can be as low as 1 organism, and so large outbreaks can be\ncaused by a small source. _C. burnetii_ can survive for many years as a\nspore-like form before being inhaled and causing infection.\nHuman infection is divided into acute and chronic Q fever, although several\ndistinct syndromes have been described. Usually symptoms occur 2 or 3 weeks\nafter exposure (range 9-40 days) and illness is typically self-limiting and\ninfluenza-like. Symptoms include fever, headache, muscle pains, fatigue,\ndry cough and pneumonia. Q fever is diagnosed by a blood test but a\npositive result is obtained [not until] 2 to 4 weeks after onset of the\nillness.\nFull recovery usually occurs, even without treatment, but in some cases\nsymptoms can be serious or prolonged, especially with pneumonia or\npre-existing valvular disease, and may require hospital admission. Acute Q\nfever is treatable with antibiotics. The chronic Q fever form, particularly\nendocarditis, is a more serious complication and occurs in about 10 percent\nof cases. It may not appear until several years after the primary episode.\nIn the UK, most Q fever cases are sporadic or associated with exposure to\nfarm animals or occur in areas (such as slaughterhouses) where animals are\nhandled. Retrospective serological studies have shown evidence of extensive\ninfection in high-risk populations, which suggests that many cases are\noften not identified at the time of illness (2). Q fever is not uncommon\nand seroprevalence studies indicate that approximately 27 percent of\nfarmers and 10 percent of the general population in the UK have been\nexposed to _C. burnetii_ at some time. Being present at calving and\nhandling cattle products of parturition may pose significant risks, as high\nconcentrations of the organism are found in the placenta and birth fluids.\nAnimal infection is most commonly reported in ruminants and studies in\nEngland and Wales have suggested that infection [rates] may be as high as\n20 percent (3). Although heavy infections in sheep have also been\nassociated with abortions, it is not generally considered to be pathogenic\nin animals. Q fever is rarely recorded as a cause of bovine abortion and\ndisease although 1.6-6.3 percent of ewes in England are seropositive, with\nover 30 percent of ewes positive in some flocks (4).\nOutbreaks are frequently reported worldwide, but sources of infection in\nsporadic cases are often difficult to elucidate. There were 2\nlaboratory-confirmed cases of Q fever reported in Scotland in 2005. This\narticle is adapted by the authors from reference 1.\n1. Q fever in Forth Valley meat processing plant.

The source is probably\ndiseased livestock such as sheep or goats, health officials said.\nThe state health department has confirmed 13 human cases in the state in 2005,\nincluding 6 in Weld County. In 2004, there were 3 confirmed cases throughout\nColorado, said John Pape, a state health department epidemiologist.\nQ fever, or 'query' fever, is caused by a bacterium called _Coxiella\nburnetii_. It builds up in [livestock] placental tissues, putting\nveterinarians and farmers at high risk, though it is treatable with\nantibiotics and is rarely fatal. Symptoms include a high fever and headache,\nand may include profuse sweating and hallucinations.\n'Most people, even untreated, get better in 2 to 3 weeks,' said Dr. Daniel\nMogyoros, an infectious disease specialist with Kaiser Permanente. 'Most\ndoctors go through their training and most of their career without ever seeing\nthis disease.'\nWeld County health officials have investigated 6 more possible cases but have\nnot yet confirmed them, said Jill Burch, a county public health nurse.\n--\nGeorge A. Robertson, PhD\nDOR Biopharma\nMiami, FL\ufffd\n<grobertson@dorbiopharma.com>\n[The following is adapted from the CDC site on Q fever (a Category B\nbioterrorism disease)\n<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvrd/qfever/index.htm#Significance%20for%\n20Bioterrorism>.\nQ fever is a zoonotic disease caused by _Coxiella burnetii_, a species of\nbacterium that is distributed globally. In 1999, Q fever became a notifiable\ndisease in the USA, but reporting is not required in many other countries.\nBecause the disease is underreported, scientists cannot reliably assess how\nmany cases of Q fever have actually occurred worldwide. Many human infections\nare inapparent.\nCattle, sheep, and goats are the primary reservoirs of _C. burnetii_.\nInfection has been noted in a wide variety of other animals, including other\nspecies of livestock and in domesticated pets. _C. burnetii_ does not usually\ncause clinical disease in these animals, although abortion in goats and sheep\nhas been linked to infection. Organisms are excreted in milk, urine, and\nfeces of infected animals. Most importantly, during birthing the organisms are\nshed in high numbers in the amniotic fluids and the placenta. The organisms\nare resistant to heat, drying, and many common disinfectants. These features\nenable the bacteria to survive for long periods in the environment. Infection\nof humans usually occurs by inhalation of these organisms from air that\ncontains airborne barnyard dust contaminated by dried placental material,\nbirth fluids, and excreta of infected herd animals. Humans are often very\nsusceptible to the disease, and only very few organisms may be required to\ncause infection.\nIngestion of contaminated milk, followed by regurgitation and inspiration of\nthe contaminated food, is a less common mode of transmission. Other modes of\ntransmission to humans, including tick bites and human-to-human transmission,\nare rare.\nOnly about one-half of all people infected with _C. burnetii_ show signs of\nclinical illness. Most acute cases of Q fever begin with sudden onset of one\nor more of the following: high fevers (up to 104-105 degrees F), severe\nheadache, general malaise, myalgia, confusion, sore throat, chills, sweats,\nnon-productive cough, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and chest\npain. Fever usually lasts for 1 to 2 weeks. Weight loss can occur and persist\nfor some time. 30 to 50 percent of patients with a symptomatic infection will\ndevelop pneumonia. Additionally, a majority of patients have abnormal results\non liver function tests and some will develop hepatitis. In general, most\npatients will recover to good health within several months without any\ntreatment. Only 1-2 percent of people with acute Q fever die of the disease.\nChronic Q fever, characterized by infection that persists for more than 6\nmonths, is uncommon but is a much more serious disease. Patients who have had\nacute Q fever may develop the chronic form as soon as 1 year or as long as 20\nyears after initial infection. A serious complication of chronic Q fever is\nendocarditis, generally involving the aortic heart valves, less commonly the\nmitral valve. Most patients who develop chronic Q fever have pre-existing\nvalvular heart disease or have a history of vascular graft. Transplant\nrecipients, patients with cancer, and those with chronic kidney disease are\nalso at risk of developing chronic Q fever. As many as 65 percent of persons\nwith chronic Q fever may die of the disease.\ufffd\nDoxycycline is the treatment of choice for acute Q fever. Antibiotic treatment\nis most effective when initiated within the first 3 days of illness. A dose of\n100 mg of doxycycline taken orally twice daily for 15-21 days is a frequently\nprescribed therapy. Quinolone antibiotics have demonstrated good in vitro\nactivity against _C. burnetii_ and may be considered by the physician. Therapy\nshould be started again if the disease relapses. Chronic Q fever endocarditis\nis much more difficult to treat effectively and often requires the use of\nmultiple drugs.\nSince _Coxiella burnetii_ is a highly infectious agent that is rather\nresistant to heat and drying, it is considered relevant in bioterrorism. It\ncan become airborne and inhaled by humans. A single _C. burnetii_ organism may\ncause disease in a susceptible person. This agent could be developed for use\nin biological warfare and is considered a potential terrorist threat. - Mod.LL]", "summary": "A ProMED-mail post\n<http://www.promedmail.org>\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\n<http://www.isid.org>\n \nGeorge A.

Up to 86\npeople are thought to have caught Q fever in an outbreak that is puzzling\npublic health officials, although it was restricted to one factory\nmanufacturing cardboard in Newport, south Wales.\n\nWorkers and subcontractors started falling ill in July 2002 and the\nillnesses peaked in August. Some needed brief hospital treatment.

Berger's remarks on the increase in Q fever cases in the\nSauerland region since 1990 [see end].\nWe have observed cases of Q fever in the Hochsauerland for more than 3\ndecades. This region is not only known for sheep raising but also for\ntourism. It is to be supposed that many cases of Q fever in tourists\nreturning from their holidays, and in the local population, remain\nundetected, when an etiologic diagnosis is neglected in cases of\ninfluenza-like respiratory disease.\nThe increase in number of Q fever cases, which was observed during the last\ndecade, seems to be linked to a significant increase in the number of sheep\nbeing kept. An increase in demand for sheep and lambs has apparently\noccurred during the nineties. It may be the result of an increase in the\nTurkish population [mutton eaters] but may be due even more to abstinence\nfrom beef due to the BSE crisis. Sheep raisers have brought in sheep from\nother regions, probably without previous contact with _Coxiella burnetii_.\nSeveral proposals were made to prevent human exposure to Coxiella infection.\nVaccination of sheep may be useful, but an approved vaccine is not available\nin Germany. Antibiotic treatment of sheep is probably not feasible for many\nreasons. But an improvement in the hygiene of animal husbandry would most\nprobably prevent transmission to humans in many cases. If the sheep were to\nbe kept in closed stables during lambing and the placentas burnt or treated\nwith disinfectants, instead of leaving them to birds, dogs and foxes, this\nwould most probably help a good deal against the spread of Coxiella\ninfections. The hygiene of sheep raising should be controlled very strictly.\nPersons who neglect the principles of prevention should be summoned or\nshould be forbidden to raise sheep.\nAnother problem is that cases of Q fever go undiagnosed or are diagnosed too\nlate, e.g. in the case of pregnant women. Therefore practitioners must be\nadvised to send specimens for the diagnosis of Q fever to the lab in all\ncases in which this diagnosis is suspected for clinical or epidemiological\nreasons.

[By 30 Aug 2002],\nthere were 79 [clinical] cases of Q fever in residents of or visitors to\nthe Chamonix Valley. 22 cases have been confirmed, most of whom live in the\nvillage of Chamonix.\nQ fever is an infectious disease caused by _Coxiella burnetii_; a bacterium\nthat generally infects ruminants (cattle, sheep, and goats). Humans are\nusually infected via inhalation of dust or aerosols containing the\nresponsible organism. The investigations conducted by sanitary authorities\nin collaboration with health professionals of the Valley [Chamonix]\ncoordinating with the agricultural services have not identified the source\nof this epidemic as yet. Q fever is not transmitted from person to person.\nIn the majority of cases, the infection is sub-clinical. When illness\npresents it is after an incubation period of an average of 2 weeks, and\npresents as a flu-like syndrome associated with a high fever, chills,\nheadaches, nausea, and aches. The illness usually resolves after 7 to 10\ndays, often without specific treatment.\nIn people with valvular heart disease or other serious disease associated\nwith impaired immunity Q fever can evolve into a chronic disorder. Such\npeople, when infected, require medical follow-up and prolonged antibiotic\ntreatment. Infection can lead to spontaneous abortion in pwomen in the\nearly months of pregnancy.\nPeople who live in or have visited the Chamonix Valley since June 2002 may\nhave been exposed to the risk of infection. People who belong to identified\nrisk groups (valvular heart disease, immunocompromise, pregnant) are\nrecommended to consult their physicians for testing to identify if\nantibiotic therapy is indicated.\nAdditional information can be found on the following websites (in French):\nMinist\u00e8re de la Sant\u00e9 ( www.sante.gouv.fr ), l'Institut de Veille Sanitaire\n( www.invs.sante.fr ), and the Centre National de R\u00e9f\u00e9rence (\nhttp://ifr48.free.fr ).\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n******\n[2]\nDate: Mon, 02 Sep 2002 15:26:18 -0400\nFrom: 'Patricia Doyle, PhD' <dr_p_doyle@hotmail.com>\nSource: Yahoo News Fri 30 Aug 2002 9:45 AM ET\n<http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&u=/ap/20020830/ap_wo_en_po/france_fever_outbreak_1>\n\nQ fever, human - France\n-----------------------\nPARIS: At least 22 people in the French Alps have been infected by Q fever,\na flu-like illness that usually affects livestock, French health officials\nsaid on Friday. Nearly 80 cases were suspected.\nThe outbreak was detected in the Chamonix valley, a popular ski area, the\nHealth Ministry said. Most of the confirmed cases are residents of the town\nof Chamonix.\nQ fever, which causes aches, nausea, and fever, can be treated and cured\nwith antibiotics. It primarily infects cattle, sheep, and goats. Humans\ncontract it by breathing in contaminated dust or eating contaminated animal\nproducts. It does not spread from person to person.\nThe Foreign Ministry has asked the region's pregnant women, people with\nheart valve problems, and those with weakened immune systems to consult\ntheir doctors for a blood test.

Cattle, sheep,\nand goats are the primary reservoirs of _C. burnetii_. Infection has been\nnoted in a wide variety of other animals, including other breeds of\nlivestock and domesticated pets. _Coxiella burnetii_ does not usually\ncause clinical disease in these animals, although abortion in goats and\nsheep has been linked to _C. burnetii_ infection. Organisms are excreted\nin milk, urine, and feces of infected animals. Most importantly, during\nbirthing the organisms are shed in large numbers within the amniotic fluid\nand the placenta. The organisms are resistant to heat, drying, and many\ncommon disinfectants. These features enable the bacteria to survive for\nlong periods in the environment. Infection of humans usually occurs by\ninhalation of these organisms from air that contains airborne barnyard dust\ncontaminated by dried placental material, birth fluids, and excreta of\ninfected herd animals. Humans are often very susceptible to the disease,\nand very few organisms may be required to cause infection\n<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvrd/qfever/index.htm>.\nGIDEON (<http://www.cyinfo.com/> offers the following background on the\nepidemiology of Q fever in France:\nMost cases occur in the south. Sixty-two per cent of cases present as\nhepatitis. Five to 8 per cent of endocarditis in this region are due to Q\nfever and 0.57 per cent of the population were seropositive in 1985.

An outbreak of 29 cases\nreported in Briancon (French Alps region) in 1996 was ascribed to ingestion\nof raw meat.\nOutbreaks of Q fever in France have also been associated with bird\ndroppings (1), sheep and wind (2), and ingestion of raw goat milk products (3).\nThe source of the current outbreak is unknown at present. It is interesting\nthat an outbreak in the French Alps in 1996 was related to ingestion of raw\nmeat. More information on this outbreak when available would be appreciated.\n1. Stein A, Raoult D.

Most of the patients had serum transaminases\n2-3 times above normal level. Most patients recovered spontaneously after\n5-10 days. Several patients were hospitalised.\nIn mid-August 2002 the diagnosis of Q fever was confirmed for 10 patients\nby the presence of Q fever phase II IgM antibodies >25 in serum.\nAn epidemiological investigation was carried out by the Cellule\nInterregionale d'Epidemiologie de Lyon (CIRE), the Centre National de\nReference des Rickettsies (CNR), the Institut de Veille Sanitaire (InVS),\nand the DDASS, to identify the mode of transmission and the source of the\noutbreak, and to implement appropriate control measures.\nCases were identified through the GPs of the Chamonix valley, the local\nhospital, the medical laboratory in the valley and the CNR.\nCase definitions used in the investigation:\nPossible Q fever: individual residing in, or visiting Chamonix valley since\nJune 2002 and having presented after 20 Jun 2002 with fever >39 degrees C,\naccompanied by at least 2 of the following symptoms: myalgia, nausea, chills.\nProbable Q fever: a possible case with an increase of transaminases AST and\nALT, above normal.\nConfirmed Q fever: a possible or probable case with positive serology for Q\nfever (phase II IgG >/= 100 and phase II IgM at >/=25).\nUp to 30 Aug 2002, 79 cases were identified: 25 possible, 32 probable and\n22 confirmed cases. All were adults between 17 and 92 years of age. The M:F\nratio was 1.8:1. Eleven individuals required hospital treatment.\nPlace of residence was known for 71 cases; 57 (80 percent) live in the\ncommune of Chamonix, 11 (15 percent) live in another town in the valley, or\nclose to the valley, and 3 are French tourists.\nAn exploratory study carried out on 19 confirmed cases suggested airborne\ncontamination from one or several excretory herds (sheep, goats, or\ncattle), possibly moving to summer pastures, or from manure-spreading\nareas. None of the cases has a high-risk profession for Q fever infection\n(for example, stock breeder, abattoir technician, etc.). During the\nexposure period, 4 individuals had close contact with ruminants, 4 had\neaten cheese made from unpasteurised milk, of which one only had eaten\nlocally produced cheese. None had drunk unpasteurised milk and 7 had\ndomestic animals. The cases questioned did not attend an event involving\nanimals. Neither is there an abattoir or knacker's yard [a knacker buys\nworn-out domestic animals or their carcasses, usually for animal feed or\nfertilizer] in the valley.\nThe epidemic curve, which is not complete for week 33 and after, due to the\ndelay in getting the onset dates, suggests a persistent source of\ncontamination. [see webpage at above URL for Figure: Cases (possible,\nprobable and confirmed) of Q fever by week of onset of symptoms, Q fever\noutbreak, Chamonix Valley, 2002.]\nA case control study is in progress to determine risk factors and\ntransmission methods (movement, consumption of unpasteurised milk, direct\nor indirect contact with manure or animal herds, participation in an event\ninvolving indirect or direct contact with animals, etc.).

In the outbreak that is still\nongoing, a 35-year-old has died, one person now has a chronic infection, and\nabout 40 people have been hospitalised with pneumonia, hepatitis, or\nendocarditis. As of today, a total of 72 cases have been registered.\nI am in urgent need of information about vaccination programmes for sheep,\nto reduce the risk of Q fever infection for humans in this endemic region.\nIn this region there is a large sheep population of about 50 000. All the\noutbreaks could be linked to infected sheep. There is a high percentage of\nsheep that have tested serologically positive (about 30 percent).\nThe normal measures alone [seem not to have reduced] the risk (we have\nordered in-house lambings, adequate disposal of the placenta and of other\ncontaminated materials, and controlled movement of sheep). We have an\nongoing study about ticks; it appears that in that region _Dermacentor\nmarginalis_ is not present.\nWe are currently considering the possibility of vaccinating the sheep.

Various hygiene\nprocedures are required to be carried out in abattoirs to reduce the level\nof contamination, including restricting the opening of gravid uteri to\nspecial rooms. Nevertheless, abattoir workers are at high occupational risk\nof contracting _C. burnetii infection_. The Queensland Workplace Health and\nSafety authorities have therefore established a policy which requires skin\ntesting and subsequent vaccination (where necessary) of new abattoir\nemployees; with a requirement that effective respirators (an approved face\nmask) be worn by such employees in risk areas until two weeks after they\nhave been vaccinated, or testing has shown vaccination to be unnecessary.\nVisitors are also required to wear respirators if going into risk areas of\nabattoirs.\n---\nBill Geering\nCanberra\n[and]\nDate: Thu, 27 Mar 1997 10:47:43 -0500\nFrom: Mike Poidinger <mikep@biosci.uq.edu.au>\nSubject: Re: New Queensland regulations\nThe following is lifted wholesale from\nhttp://hna.ffh.vic.gov.au/comm_dis/cdu/qfever.html\nI am currently trying to contact the responsible persons in both Queensland\nand Victoria for more uptodate information. ps I dont mind being quoted,\nand since this is an excerpt from a public Web page (date unknown), I am\nsure quoting it is OK as well.\nMore to follow as I can get it (given the 4-5 day Easter break upon us).\n---\nMike Poidinger\n--------------------------------\nQ fever - Update\nSheila Beaton\nQ Fever is an acute illness with fever, chills and muscle pains and\noccasional long term complications. The micro-organism responsible,\n_Coxiella burnetii_, is carried by cattle, sheep and goats and is\ntransmitted by contact with animal faeces, urine, etc or by inhaling dust\nfrom infected premises. It is and occupational hazard paticularly for\nabattoir workers and meat inspectors, but also for shearers, wool sorters and\nveterinarians. There is no endemic reservoir in Victoria, but the organism\nis commonly introduced in stock from interstate.\nFollowing a notification of illness in a female abattoir worker, the\nInfectious Diseases Unit investigated an outbreak of Q fever at an abattoir\nin northern Victoria. The abatoir has been operating for approximately two\nyears and a large number of staff are new to the industry. Prevaccination\nscreening showed approximately 80% of workers were non-immune to Q fever. At\nthe time of the outbreak, the abattoir was involved in an immunisation\nprogram for the workers, however, some were already incubating the disease\nat the time.\nTo date, there are 26 confirmed cases of Q Fever with a further 3 yet to be\nconfirmed from a workforce of approximately 100.\nThe Commonwealth Serum Laboratories have prepared a vaccine, Q-Vax, which\ngives a very high level of protection, except if given after a person has\nalready been infected. Q-Vax is different from other vaccines in that the\nrecipient must first be tested for immunity, since those persons already\nimmune may have severe reactions with the vaccine.\nThe details of the immunisation program are as follows:\nTwo visits to the workplace are required, one week apart. At the first visit\nall employees who consent to be involved are given a skin test for Q Fever\nby injecting a small dose of diluted vaccine into the skin. At the same time\n5-10 mls of blood are taken and tested for Q Fever antibodies. Each employee\nis given a short questionaire enquiring about their duration of employment,\npast history of Q Fever, allergies, etc. A previous history of infection\nwith Q Fever vaccine is a contraindication to vaccination.\nThe skin test is read 7 days later. Training is required in both the\nperformance and reading / interpretation of the skin test. If both skin test\nand blood test are negative and the person is not allergic to eggs, he/she\nis offered the vaccine which is given by injection under the skin.\nThe object of the immunisation campaign is to avoid the possibility of a\nmajor outbreak of Q Fever at any particular workplace. Preventing Q Fever\ncan lead to significant savings to the employer in avoiding Workcover costs.\n---\nDr Mike Poidinger\nMicrobiology, UQ\nAustralia\nmikep@biosci.uq.oz.au\n[and]\nDate: Thu, 27 Mar 1997 16:37:57 -0500\nFrom: Mike Poidinger <mikep@biosci.uq.edu.au>\nSubject: Re: New Queensland regulations-more info\nI just talked to Dr David Smith, the Principal Medical Officer for the\nQueensland government division of Workplace Health and Safety.

The recent\npolicy decision sent to you regarding respirators and vaccination is a\nresult of these ongoing figures, and not a response to a specific outbreak\nin Qld or indeed any other part of Australia.\nAs far as Dr Smith is aware, no other state has any similar regulations.\nThe vaccine costs $65/ampule, and given the tests required prior to\nvaccination, can cost $120-$150/person.\nQ fever currently costs the Qld meat industry about 1 million dollars/year\nin terms of man hours lost.\n---\nDr Mike Poidinger\nMicrobiology, UQ\nAustralia\nmikep@biosci.uq.oz.au\n\n[Although most cases of Q fever infection are mild, it can on occasion be\nnasty, even lethal.

There are a number of other\nfacilities in this country and Canada at which this vaccine is utilized, in\naccordance with an investigational protocol.\nBecause this vaccine has, in the past, caused severe local reactions in\nindividuals already immune to _Coxiella burnetii_, a screening intradermal\nskin test with Q fever antigen is required prior to vaccination. The purpose\nof the skin test is to identify those individuals at risk of developing\nsevere local reactions to the vaccine, and individuals with a positive skin\ntest should not be vaccinated. A similar problem exists with the Australian\nvaccine, and a screening skin test is also required prior to use of that\nproduct. In addition, it should be noted that individuals with positive skin\ntest reactions to this Q fever antigen do not need vaccination, because the\npositive skin test reflects pre-existing protective immunity to Q fever.\nAs an investigational product, IND 610 is subject to applicable FDA\nregulations and policies. It can be administered only according to an\napproved investigational protocol under the supervision of the principal or\nan associate investigator, but it is not being 'held in reserve'.
