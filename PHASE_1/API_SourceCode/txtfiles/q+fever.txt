According to a UK military news outlet, Forces Network, a consultant in infectious diseases and tropical medicine told to the Central London Country Court on [Tue 22 Jan 2019], that 90 confirmed cases of Q fever had been recorded among British soldiers who had served in Helmand.\n\nLieutenant Colonel Mark Bailey's testimony was heard in the case of a private with 2nd Battalion, the Mercian Regiment, who said his life has been ruined after he contracted the disease while in Helmand in 2011/2012. During his tour, his lawyers said [the private] was in contact with goats and sheep and \"was often required to take cover and jump through ditches and crawl along the ground -- coming into contact with animal products and excrement.\" The soldier was medically discharged from the Army in 2014 because of his Q fever and chronic fatigue symptoms.\n\nHumans can catch Q fever by breathing in dust from the secretions of infected farm animals such as sheep, cattle, and goats.\n\nBailey, who specializes in infectious diseases and tropical medicine, and a national expert in Q fever said he has 90 military and 10 civilian cases in his care after they were referred to him. He confirmed the 90 had served in Helmand and said the number of military cases \"built up from 2008\", Forces Network reported. Bailey told the court: \"We have seen no new cases since 2014 from Afghanistan. Occasionally we get other military cases from other locations. Cyprus most recently.\"\n\nBailey said he had seen \"one British soldier who very, very nearly died\" as a result of Q fever and subsequent complications, but there have been no UK deaths in his group.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Q fever is due to _Coxiella burnetii_, an obligate intracellular rickettsia-like bacterial pathogen. It is highly resistant to drying and heat, which enables the bacteria to survive for long periods in the environment. Its survival is attributed to a small cell variant of the organism that is part of its biphasic developmental cycle. Q fever is a zoonosis. Domestic ungulates such as sheep, cattle, and goats serve as the reservoir of infection for humans. The organism is shed in urine, feces, milk, and especially birthing products; intermittent high-level shedding occurs at the time of parturition, with millions of bacteria being released per gram of placenta.\n\nHumans usually become infected by inhaling aerosolized organisms. Acute symptoms of a flu-like illness usually develop within 2-3 weeks of exposure, although as many as half of humans infected with _C. burnetii_ do not show symptoms (http://www.cdc.gov/qfever/symptoms/index.html). Although most persons with acute Q fever infection recover, others may experience serious illness with complications that may include pneumonia, granulomatous hepatitis, endocarditis (especially in patients with previous cardiac valvulopathy), myocarditis, and central nervous system involvement. Pregnant women who are infected may be at risk for pre-term delivery or miscarriage.\n\nThe solider likely suffers from Q fever-associated chronic fatigue. The following related to post-Q fever fatigue syndrome is extracted from Melgar TA, Bauler TJ, Lutwick LI. Q fever in man: A one health paradigm disease. In, The Principles and Practice of Q Fever, Simoes JCC, Anastacio SF, da Silva GJ (eds), Nova Science Publishers, 2017, pp 1-24:\n\n\"Up to 20% of patients with acute Q fever report chronic fatigue more than a year later. Most of these cases meet the CDC criteria for chronic fatigue syndrome. Other symptoms include night sweats, nausea, headache, myalgia, enlarged lymph nodes, arthralgia, insomnia, depression, decreased concentration and short term memory impairment. The pathogenesis is not clear although there is evidence that genetic factors may play a role and _C. burnetii_ antigens and DNA can be found in patients' macrophages for up to 12 years and in one case 70 years after acute infection (1,2). Treatment is focused on chronic fatigue including exercise therapy and cognitive behavior therapy. There are no current recommendations for antimicrobial therapy for Q fever-associated chronic fatigue although case reports and one study demonstrated improvement with antimicrobials (3). A large placebo controlled randomized trial in the Netherlands (4,5) reported some non-sustained improvement was found with cognitive-behavioral therapy but not with long term doxycycline.\n\nReferences\n----------\n1.

According to a UK military news outlet, Forces Network, a consultant in infectious diseases and tropical medicine told to the Central London Country Court on [Tue 22 Jan 2019], that 90 confirmed cases of Q fever had been recorded among British soldiers who had served in Helmand.\n\nLieutenant Colonel Mark Bailey's testimony was heard in the case of a private with 2nd Battalion, the Mercian Regiment, who said his life has been ruined after he contracted the disease while in Helmand in 2011/2012. During his tour, his lawyers said [the private] was in contact with goats and sheep and \"was often required to take cover and jump through ditches and crawl along the ground -- coming into contact with animal products and excrement.\" The soldier was medically discharged from the Army in 2014 because of his Q fever and chronic fatigue symptoms.\n\nHumans can catch Q fever by breathing in dust from the secretions of infected farm animals such as sheep, cattle, and goats.\n\nBailey, who specializes in infectious diseases and tropical medicine, and a national expert in Q fever said he has 90 military and 10 civilian cases in his care after they were referred to him. He confirmed the 90 had served in Helmand and said the number of military cases \"built up from 2008\", Forces Network reported. Bailey told the court: \"We have seen no new cases since 2014 from Afghanistan. Occasionally we get other military cases from other locations. Cyprus most recently.\"\n\nBailey said he had seen \"one British soldier who very, very nearly died\" as a result of Q fever and subsequent complications, but there have been no UK deaths in his group.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Q fever is due to _Coxiella burnetii_, an obligate intracellular rickettsia-like bacterial pathogen. It is highly resistant to drying and heat, which enables the bacteria to survive for long periods in the environment. Its survival is attributed to a small cell variant of the organism that is part of its biphasic developmental cycle. Q fever is a zoonosis. Domestic ungulates such as sheep, cattle, and goats serve as the reservoir of infection for humans. The organism is shed in urine, feces, milk, and especially birthing products; intermittent high-level shedding occurs at the time of parturition, with millions of bacteria being released per gram of placenta.\n\nHumans usually become infected by inhaling aerosolized organisms. Acute symptoms of a flu-like illness usually develop within 2-3 weeks of exposure, although as many as half of humans infected with _C. burnetii_ do not show symptoms (http://www.cdc.gov/qfever/symptoms/index.html). Although most persons with acute Q fever infection recover, others may experience serious illness with complications that may include pneumonia, granulomatous hepatitis, endocarditis (especially in patients with previous cardiac valvulopathy), myocarditis, and central nervous system involvement. Pregnant women who are infected may be at risk for pre-term delivery or miscarriage.\n\nThe solider likely suffers from Q fever-associated chronic fatigue. The following related to post-Q fever fatigue syndrome is extracted from Melgar TA, Bauler TJ, Lutwick LI. Q fever in man: A one health paradigm disease. In, The Principles and Practice of Q Fever, Simoes JCC, Anastacio SF, da Silva GJ (eds), Nova Science Publishers, 2017, pp 1-24:\n\n\"Up to 20% of patients with acute Q fever report chronic fatigue more than a year later. Most of these cases meet the CDC criteria for chronic fatigue syndrome. Other symptoms include night sweats, nausea, headache, myalgia, enlarged lymph nodes, arthralgia, insomnia, depression, decreased concentration and short term memory impairment. The pathogenesis is not clear although there is evidence that genetic factors may play a role and _C. burnetii_ antigens and DNA can be found in patients' macrophages for up to 12 years and in one case 70 years after acute infection (1,2). Treatment is focused on chronic fatigue including exercise therapy and cognitive behavior therapy. There are no current recommendations for antimicrobial therapy for Q fever-associated chronic fatigue although case reports and one study demonstrated improvement with antimicrobials (3). A large placebo controlled randomized trial in the Netherlands (4,5) reported some non-sustained improvement was found with cognitive-behavioral therapy but not with long term doxycycline.\n\nReferences\n----------\n1.

According to a UK military news outlet, Forces Network, a consultant in infectious diseases and tropical medicine told to the Central London Country Court on [Tue 22 Jan 2019], that 90 confirmed cases of Q fever had been recorded among British soldiers who had served in Helmand.\n\nLieutenant Colonel Mark Bailey's testimony was heard in the case of a private with 2nd Battalion, the Mercian Regiment, who said his life has been ruined after he contracted the disease while in Helmand in 2011/2012. During his tour, his lawyers said [the private] was in contact with goats and sheep and \"was often required to take cover and jump through ditches and crawl along the ground -- coming into contact with animal products and excrement.\" The soldier was medically discharged from the Army in 2014 because of his Q fever and chronic fatigue symptoms.\n\nHumans can catch Q fever by breathing in dust from the secretions of infected farm animals such as sheep, cattle, and goats.\n\nBailey, who specializes in infectious diseases and tropical medicine, and a national expert in Q fever said he has 90 military and 10 civilian cases in his care after they were referred to him. He confirmed the 90 had served in Helmand and said the number of military cases \"built up from 2008\", Forces Network reported. Bailey told the court: \"We have seen no new cases since 2014 from Afghanistan. Occasionally we get other military cases from other locations. Cyprus most recently.\"\n\nBailey said he had seen \"one British soldier who very, very nearly died\" as a result of Q fever and subsequent complications, but there have been no UK deaths in his group.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Q fever is due to _Coxiella burnetii_, an obligate intracellular rickettsia-like bacterial pathogen. It is highly resistant to drying and heat, which enables the bacteria to survive for long periods in the environment.

Humans usually become infected by inhaling aerosolized organisms that are shed in urine, feces, milk, and especially birthing products of infected animals; intermittent high-level shedding occurs at the time of parturition, with millions of bacteria being released per gram of placenta.\n\nQ fever spreads in air currents for a considerable distance in agricultural regions via airborne particles containing the _C. burnetii_ to involve people living downwind from infected livestock. Widespread transmission of Q fever was recently documented in the Netherlands downwind from the index farm, a single dairy-goat farm, even beyond a 5 km (3 mi) high-risk zone (http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/55/12/1591.long#T2). _C. burnetii_ is highly resistant to drying, heat, and many common disinfectants, which is attributed to a small cell variant of the organism that is part of a biphasic developmental cycle. These features enable the bacteria to survive for long periods in the environment.\n\nAlthough often asymptomatic, the infection can present acutely 2-3 weeks after exposure as atypical pneumonia or hepatitis or as a chronic disease (mainly endocarditis) (Maurin M, Raoult D. Q fever. Clin Microbiol Rev. 1999; 12(4): 518-53; available at http://cmr.asm.org/content/12/4/518.short.) Unusual complications include glomerulonephritis and rhabdomyolysis (http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/08860220701460178).\n\nDiagnosis of Q fever can usually be confirmed by serology (https://emergency.cdc.gov/agent/qfever/clinicians/diagnosis.asp). In acute Q fever, phase II antibodies are usually much higher than phase I antibodies and are detectable by indirect immunofluorescence 2 to 3 weeks after onset of illness. In chronic Q fever, phase I antibody titers are much greater than phase II titers. Phase I antibody titers of 1:800 or higher are considered diagnostic in endocarditis patients for chronic Q fever.\n\nThe tetracyclines are considered the antibiotics of choice for treatment of acute Q fever.

Humans usually become infected by inhaling aerosolized organisms that are shed in urine, feces, milk, and especially birthing products of infected animals; intermittent high-level shedding occurs at the time of parturition, with millions of bacteria being released per gram of placenta.\n\nQ fever spreads in air currents for a considerable distance in agricultural regions via airborne particles containing the _C. burnetii_ to involve people living downwind from infected livestock. Widespread transmission of Q fever was recently documented in the Netherlands downwind from the index farm, a single dairy-goat farm, even beyond a 5 km (3 mi) high-risk zone (http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/55/12/1591.long#T2). _C. burnetii_ is highly resistant to drying, heat, and many common disinfectants, which is attributed to a small cell variant of the organism that is part of a biphasic developmental cycle. These features enable the bacteria to survive for long periods in the environment.\n\nAlthough often asymptomatic, the infection can present acutely 2-3 weeks after exposure as atypical pneumonia or hepatitis or as a chronic disease (mainly endocarditis) (Maurin M, Raoult D. Q fever. Clin Microbiol Rev. 1999; 12(4): 518-53; available at http://cmr.asm.org/content/12/4/518.short.) Unusual complications include glomerulonephritis and rhabdomyolysis (http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/08860220701460178).\n\nDiagnosis of Q fever can usually be confirmed by serology (https://emergency.cdc.gov/agent/qfever/clinicians/diagnosis.asp). In acute Q fever, phase II antibodies are usually much higher than phase I antibodies and are detectable by indirect immunofluorescence 2 to 3 weeks after onset of illness. In chronic Q fever, phase I antibody titers are much greater than phase II titers.

Humans usually become infected by inhaling aerosolized organisms that are shed in urine, feces, milk, and especially birthing products of infected animals; intermittent high-level shedding occurs at the time of parturition, with millions of bacteria being released per gram of placenta.\n\nQ fever spreads in air currents for a considerable distance in agricultural regions via airborne particles containing the _C. burnetii_ to involve people living downwind from infected livestock. Widespread transmission of Q fever was recently documented in the Netherlands downwind from the index farm, a single dairy-goat farm, even beyond a 5 km (3 mi) high-risk zone (http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/55/12/1591.long#T2). _C. burnetii_ is highly resistant to drying, heat, and many common disinfectants, which is attributed to a small cell variant of the organism that is part of a biphasic developmental cycle. These features enable the bacteria to survive for long periods in the environment.\n\nAlthough often asymptomatic, the infection can present acutely 2-3 weeks after exposure as atypical pneumonia or hepatitis or as a chronic disease (mainly endocarditis) (Maurin M, Raoult D. Q fever. Clin Microbiol Rev. 1999; 12(4): 518-53; available at http://cmr.asm.org/content/12/4/518.short.)

In acute Q fever, phase II antibodies are usually much higher than phase I antibodies and are detectable by indirect immunofluorescence 2 to 3 weeks after onset of illness. In chronic Q fever, phase I antibody titers are much greater than phase II titers.

The statistic was revealed on last week's [week of 6 Jul 2015] episode of the ABC program Landline [http://www.abc.net.au/landline/content/2015/s4271952.htm]. Federal Health Minister Sussan Ley has promised to keep a \"watching brief\" on the incidence of Q fever -- an infectious disease passed from animals to humans -- as dry conditions provide an ideal environment for the airborne organism to spread.\n\nQ fever can be passed on from almost any animal, but is mostly spread by goats, sheep, and cattle. The early symptoms resemble the flu and include high temperature, sweating, and body aches and pains. If caught early, it can be treated with antibiotics. But it has become increasingly clear that 20 to 25 per cent of cases do not fully recover, with sufferers going on to develop long-term chronic fatigue.\n\nApproximately 2 per cent of people who contract the disease end up with a life-threatening failure of their heart valves, and a small percentage die from the disease.\n\nQ fever -- the Q standing for Query -- is an international disease, identified in almost every country except New Zealand, but Australia is the only place that has an effective vaccine. Classed as a notifiable disease, just under 500 Australian cases are registered each year, almost half of them in Queensland.\n\nThe Q-vax vaccine was introduced to abattoir workers in the early 1990s and resulted in a halving of the number of Q fever cases nationally. A federally funded vaccination campaign targeting sheep, cattle, and dairy farmers was rolled out from 2001-2005, again with a dramatic drop in notifications.\n\nWith case numbers edging up slightly in the past 2 years, and a lack of awareness of the disease even in rural areas where it is most prevalent, there have been calls for another subsidised vaccination campaign. But Ms Ley said she would not agree to another vaccination campaign \"at this stage\".\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Maps of Australia can be seen at http://maps.unomaha.edu/peterson/funda/MapLinks/Australia/Australia_files/image001.gif and http://healthmap.org/promed/p/47001. Guyra, a town with a population of almost 2000 people in 2011, the seat of Guyra Shire, with a population of 4397 people in 2011, is located at an elevation of 1330 m (4364 ft) above sea level on the Northern Tablelands in the New England region of New South Wales, Australia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guyra,_New_South_Wales). The New England region is about 60 km (37 mi) inland from the Pacific Coast. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people make up 10 per cent of the population of Guyra Shire.\n\n_Coxiella burnetii_, an obligate intracellular rickettsia-like bacterial pathogen causes Q fever. Q fever is primarily an occupational hazard for farmers, veterinarians, and abattoir workers in contact with infected domestic animals such as cattle, sheep, and goats, which serve as the reservoir of infection for humans. Humans usually become infected by inhaling aerosolized organisms that are shed in urine, feces, milk, and especially birthing products of infected animals; intermittent high-level shedding occurs at the time of parturition, with millions of bacteria being released per gram of placenta.\n\nQ fever spreads easily in agricultural regions via airborne particles containing the _C. burnetii_ for a considerable distances to involve people living downwind from infected livestock. Widespread transmission of Q fever was recently documented in the Netherlands downwind from the index farm from a single dairy-goat farm, even beyond a 5 km (3 mi) high-risk zone (http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/55/12/1591.long#T2). _C. burnetii_ is highly resistant to drying, heat, and many common disinfectants, which is attributed to a small cell variant of the organism that is part of a biphasic developmental cycle. These features enable the bacteria to survive for long periods in the environment.\n\nGuyra was home to a large regional abattoir that employed up to 350 staff until it closed in 1995; the abattoir building now houses an angora rabbit breeding establishment (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guyra,_New_South_Wales). The principal industries include wool, lambs, and beef cattle, which may explain why Guyra is a \"hot-spot\" for Q fever.\n\nIn Australia, Q fever vaccination is recommended for those working in \"at-risk\" occupations such as abattoir workers, farmers, stockyard workers, shearers, animal transporters, and others exposed to cattle, camels, sheep, goats, and kangaroos or their products (including products of conception), veterinarians, veterinary nurses, veterinary students, professional dog and cat breeders, agricultural college staff and students, wildlife and zoo workers (working with high-risk animals), and laboratory personnel handling veterinary specimens or working with the organism; workers at pig abattoirs do not require Q fever vaccination (http://www.immunise.health.gov.au/internet/immunise/publishing.nsf/Content/Handbook10-home~handbook10part4~handbook10-4-15).\n\nIf the person has a positive history of previous infection with Q fever, vaccination is contraindicated; in others, serum antibody determination and skin tests must be done before vaccination to exclude those likely to have severe local or systemic hypersensitivity reactions to the vaccine resulting from previous unrecognized exposure to the organism (http://www.immunise.health.gov.au/internet/immunise/publishing.nsf/Content/Handbook10-home~handbook10part4~handbook10-4-15).

Federal Health Minister Sussan Ley has promised to keep a \"watching brief\" on the incidence of Q fever -- an infectious disease passed from animals to humans -- as dry conditions provide an ideal environment for the airborne organism to spread.\n\nQ fever can be passed on from almost any animal, but is mostly spread by goats, sheep, and cattle. The early symptoms resemble the flu and include high temperature, sweating, and body aches and pains. If caught early, it can be treated with antibiotics. But it has become increasingly clear that 20 to 25 per cent of cases do not fully recover, with sufferers going on to develop long-term chronic fatigue.\n\nApproximately 2 per cent of people who contract the disease end up with a life-threatening failure of their heart valves, and a small percentage die from the disease.\n\nQ fever -- the Q standing for Query -- is an international disease, identified in almost every country except New Zealand, but Australia is the only place that has an effective vaccine. Classed as a notifiable disease, just under 500 Australian cases are registered each year, almost half of them in Queensland.\n\nThe Q-vax vaccine was introduced to abattoir workers in the early 1990s and resulted in a halving of the number of Q fever cases nationally. A federally funded vaccination campaign targeting sheep, cattle, and dairy farmers was rolled out from 2001-2005, again with a dramatic drop in notifications.\n\nWith case numbers edging up slightly in the past 2 years, and a lack of awareness of the disease even in rural areas where it is most prevalent, there have been calls for another subsidised vaccination campaign.

Guyra, a town with a population of almost 2000 people in 2011, the seat of Guyra Shire, with a population of 4397 people in 2011, is located at an elevation of 1330 m (4364 ft) above sea level on the Northern Tablelands in the New England region of New South Wales, Australia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guyra,_New_South_Wales). The New England region is about 60 km (37 mi) inland from the Pacific Coast. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people make up 10 per cent of the population of Guyra Shire.\n\n_Coxiella burnetii_, an obligate intracellular rickettsia-like bacterial pathogen causes Q fever. Q fever is primarily an occupational hazard for farmers, veterinarians, and abattoir workers in contact with infected domestic animals such as cattle, sheep, and goats, which serve as the reservoir of infection for humans. Humans usually become infected by inhaling aerosolized organisms that are shed in urine, feces, milk, and especially birthing products of infected animals; intermittent high-level shedding occurs at the time of parturition, with millions of bacteria being released per gram of placenta.\n\nQ fever spreads easily in agricultural regions via airborne particles containing the _C. burnetii_ for a considerable distances to involve people living downwind from infected livestock. Widespread transmission of Q fever was recently documented in the Netherlands downwind from the index farm from a single dairy-goat farm, even beyond a 5 km (3 mi) high-risk zone (http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/55/12/1591.long#T2). _C. burnetii_ is highly resistant to drying, heat, and many common disinfectants, which is attributed to a small cell variant of the organism that is part of a biphasic developmental cycle. These features enable the bacteria to survive for long periods in the environment.\n\nGuyra was home to a large regional abattoir that employed up to 350 staff until it closed in 1995; the abattoir building now houses an angora rabbit breeding establishment (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guyra,_New_South_Wales). The principal industries include wool, lambs, and beef cattle, which may explain why Guyra is a \"hot-spot\" for Q fever.\n\nIn Australia, Q fever vaccination is recommended for those working in \"at-risk\" occupations such as abattoir workers, farmers, stockyard workers, shearers, animal transporters, and others exposed to cattle, camels, sheep, goats, and kangaroos or their products (including products of conception), veterinarians, veterinary nurses, veterinary students, professional dog and cat breeders, agricultural college staff and students, wildlife and zoo workers (working with high-risk animals), and laboratory personnel handling veterinary specimens or working with the organism; workers at pig abattoirs do not require Q fever vaccination (http://www.immunise.health.gov.au/internet/immunise/publishing.nsf/Content/Handbook10-home~handbook10part4~handbook10-4-15).\n\nIf the person has a positive history of previous infection with Q fever, vaccination is contraindicated; in others, serum antibody determination and skin tests must be done before vaccination to exclude those likely to have severe local or systemic hypersensitivity reactions to the vaccine resulting from previous unrecognized exposure to the organism (http://www.immunise.health.gov.au/internet/immunise/publishing.nsf/Content/Handbook10-home~handbook10part4~handbook10-4-15).

Federal Health Minister Sussan Ley has promised to keep a \"watching brief\" on the incidence of Q fever -- an infectious disease passed from animals to humans -- as dry conditions provide an ideal environment for the airborne organism to spread.\n\nQ fever can be passed on from almost any animal, but is mostly spread by goats, sheep, and cattle. The early symptoms resemble the flu and include high temperature, sweating, and body aches and pains. If caught early, it can be treated with antibiotics. But it has become increasingly clear that 20 to 25 per cent of cases do not fully recover, with sufferers going on to develop long-term chronic fatigue.\n\nApproximately 2 per cent of people who contract the disease end up with a life-threatening failure of their heart valves, and a small percentage die from the disease.\n\nQ fever -- the Q standing for Query -- is an international disease, identified in almost every country except New Zealand, but Australia is the only place that has an effective vaccine.

Guyra, a town with a population of almost 2000 people in 2011, the seat of Guyra Shire, with a population of 4397 people in 2011, is located at an elevation of 1330 m (4364 ft) above sea level on the Northern Tablelands in the New England region of New South Wales, Australia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guyra,_New_South_Wales). The New England region is about 60 km (37 mi) inland from the Pacific Coast. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people make up 10 per cent of the population of Guyra Shire.\n\n_Coxiella burnetii_, an obligate intracellular rickettsia-like bacterial pathogen causes Q fever. Q fever is primarily an occupational hazard for farmers, veterinarians, and abattoir workers in contact with infected domestic animals such as cattle, sheep, and goats, which serve as the reservoir of infection for humans. Humans usually become infected by inhaling aerosolized organisms that are shed in urine, feces, milk, and especially birthing products of infected animals; intermittent high-level shedding occurs at the time of parturition, with millions of bacteria being released per gram of placenta.\n\nQ fever spreads easily in agricultural regions via airborne particles containing the _C. burnetii_ for a considerable distances to involve people living downwind from infected livestock. Widespread transmission of Q fever was recently documented in the Netherlands downwind from the index farm from a single dairy-goat farm, even beyond a 5 km (3 mi) high-risk zone (http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/55/12/1591.long#T2). _C. burnetii_ is highly resistant to drying, heat, and many common disinfectants, which is attributed to a small cell variant of the organism that is part of a biphasic developmental cycle. These features enable the bacteria to survive for long periods in the environment.\n\nGuyra was home to a large regional abattoir that employed up to 350 staff until it closed in 1995; the abattoir building now houses an angora rabbit breeding establishment (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guyra,_New_South_Wales).

The statistic was revealed on last week's [week of 6 Jul 2015] episode of the ABC program Landline [http://www.abc.net.au/landline/content/2015/s4271952.htm]. Federal Health Minister Sussan Ley has promised to keep a \"watching brief\" on the incidence of Q fever -- an infectious disease passed from animals to humans -- as dry conditions provide an ideal environment for the airborne organism to spread.\n\nQ fever can be passed on from almost any animal, but is mostly spread by goats, sheep, and cattle. The early symptoms resemble the flu and include high temperature, sweating, and body aches and pains. If caught early, it can be treated with antibiotics. But it has become increasingly clear that 20 to 25 per cent of cases do not fully recover, with sufferers going on to develop long-term chronic fatigue.\n\nApproximately 2 per cent of people who contract the disease end up with a life-threatening failure of their heart valves, and a small percentage die from the disease.\n\nQ fever -- the Q standing for Query -- is an international disease, identified in almost every country except New Zealand, but Australia is the only place that has an effective vaccine. Classed as a notifiable disease, just under 500 Australian cases are registered each year, almost half of them in Queensland.\n\nThe Q-vax vaccine was introduced to abattoir workers in the early 1990s and resulted in a halving of the number of Q fever cases nationally. A federally funded vaccination campaign targeting sheep, cattle, and dairy farmers was rolled out from 2001-2005, again with a dramatic drop in notifications.\n\nWith case numbers edging up slightly in the past 2 years, and a lack of awareness of the disease even in rural areas where it is most prevalent, there have been calls for another subsidised vaccination campaign. But Ms Ley said she would not agree to another vaccination campaign \"at this stage\".\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Maps of Australia can be seen at http://maps.unomaha.edu/peterson/funda/MapLinks/Australia/Australia_files/image001.gif and http://healthmap.org/promed/p/47001. Guyra, a town with a population of almost 2000 people in 2011, the seat of Guyra Shire, with a population of 4397 people in 2011, is located at an elevation of 1330 m (4364 ft) above sea level on the Northern Tablelands in the New England region of New South Wales, Australia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guyra,_New_South_Wales). The New England region is about 60 km (37 mi) inland from the Pacific Coast. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people make up 10 per cent of the population of Guyra Shire.\n\n_Coxiella burnetii_, an obligate intracellular rickettsia-like bacterial pathogen causes Q fever. Q fever is primarily an occupational hazard for farmers, veterinarians, and abattoir workers in contact with infected domestic animals such as cattle, sheep, and goats, which serve as the reservoir of infection for humans. Humans usually become infected by inhaling aerosolized organisms that are shed in urine, feces, milk, and especially birthing products of infected animals; intermittent high-level shedding occurs at the time of parturition, with millions of bacteria being released per gram of placenta.\n\nQ fever spreads easily in agricultural regions via airborne particles containing the _C. burnetii_ for a considerable distances to involve people living downwind from infected livestock. Widespread transmission of Q fever was recently documented in the Netherlands downwind from the index farm from a single dairy-goat farm, even beyond a 5 km (3 mi) high-risk zone (http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/55/12/1591.long#T2). _C. burnetii_ is highly resistant to drying, heat, and many common disinfectants, which is attributed to a small cell variant of the organism that is part of a biphasic developmental cycle. These features enable the bacteria to survive for long periods in the environment.\n\nGuyra was home to a large regional abattoir that employed up to 350 staff until it closed in 1995; the abattoir building now houses an angora rabbit breeding establishment (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guyra,_New_South_Wales). The principal industries include wool, lambs, and beef cattle, which may explain why Guyra is a \"hot-spot\" for Q fever.\n\nIn Australia, Q fever vaccination is recommended for those working in \"at-risk\" occupations such as abattoir workers, farmers, stockyard workers, shearers, animal transporters, and others exposed to cattle, camels, sheep, goats, and kangaroos or their products (including products of conception), veterinarians, veterinary nurses, veterinary students, professional dog and cat breeders, agricultural college staff and students, wildlife and zoo workers (working with high-risk animals), and laboratory personnel handling veterinary specimens or working with the organism; workers at pig abattoirs do not require Q fever vaccination (http://www.immunise.health.gov.au/internet/immunise/publishing.nsf/Content/Handbook10-home~handbook10part4~handbook10-4-15).\n\nIf the person has a positive history of previous infection with Q fever, vaccination is contraindicated; in others, serum antibody determination and skin tests must be done before vaccination to exclude those likely to have severe local or systemic hypersensitivity reactions to the vaccine resulting from previous unrecognized exposure to the organism (http://www.immunise.health.gov.au/internet/immunise/publishing.nsf/Content/Handbook10-home~handbook10part4~handbook10-4-15).

Cattle, sheep, and goats are the primary reservoirs, although a variety of species may be infected. Organisms are excreted in milk, urine, and feces of infected animals. During birthing, the organisms are shed in high numbers within the amniotic fluids and the placenta. The organism is extremely hardy and resistant to heat, drying, and many common disinfectants, which enables the bacteria to survive for long periods in the environment.\n\nInfection of humans usually occurs by inhalation of these organisms from air that contains airborne barnyard dust contaminated by dried placental material, birth fluids, and excreta of infected animals. Other modes of transmission to humans, including tick bites, ingestion of unpasteurized milk or dairy products, and human to human transmission, are rare. Humans are often very susceptible to the disease, and very few organisms may be required to cause infection.\"\n\nQ fever is an important zoonosis, with veterinarians, laboratory workers, farmers and abattoir workers at risk. Surveys have shown that significant numbers of livestock handlers have antibodies, indicating exposure to the organism.\n\nLess than half of people infected become ill, and most infections are mild. But affected persons can develop a high fever with headache, muscle pains, sore throat, nausea and vomiting, chest and stomach pains. The fever can last for one or 2 weeks and lead to pneumonia or affect the liver. Treatment involves long term antibiotic therapy.\n\nIn a small percentage of cases, a chronic, severe debilitating disease occurs. People with suppressed immune systems and those with pre-existing heart valve problems are at risk of this complication, which is often fatal. There is also a post Q fever syndrome of chronic fatigue.\n\nQ fever is the 2nd most commonly reported laboratory infection, with several recorded outbreaks involving 15 or more persons http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Media_Center/docs/pdf/Disease_cards/Q-FEVER-EN.pdf.\n\nThe following information was obtained from a publication titled \"Epidemiological characteristics of serologically confirmed Q Fever cases in South Korea, 2006-2011.\" In the discussion it was noted that: \"This is the 1st official report on the characteristics of Q fever patients in Korea. The annual incidence of Q fever in Korea is much lower than that in France, Australia and Taiwan (0.02 vs. 2.5, 0.1, and 0.38 per 100 000 population, respectively). As the disease has a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations, from nonspecific febrile illness to neurological disorder, and there are no known outbreaks in Korea, it is difficult for physicians to diagnose Q fever without an increased awareness. Serological diagnostic testing is limited, because it is available at only one national laboratory. Therefore, Q fever is likely to be under-diagnosed and under-reported in Korea.\"\n\n\"According to national surveys of_ C. burnetti _ seroprevalence in the Korean population, the seropositivity rate of high-risk occupation groups, such as dairy farmers, slaughterhouse workers, and veterinarians, was 3.7-10.2 percent (data not shown). Q fever is not currently considered to be a significant threat to public health in Korea. Only sporadic cases have been reported to date, but there is a possibility of an epidemic. Therefore, increased awareness among physicians for better detection and treatment of Q fever, expansion of the diagnostic system, and further investigations for undiscovered risk factors, are persistently required.\"\n\nReference:\nKwak, Wooseok et al (2013) Epidemiological Characteristics of Serologically Confirmed Q Fever Cases in South Korea, 2006-2011.

Cattle, sheep, and goats are the primary reservoirs, although a variety of species may be infected. Organisms are excreted in milk, urine, and feces of infected animals. During birthing, the organisms are shed in high numbers within the amniotic fluids and the placenta. The organism is extremely hardy and resistant to heat, drying, and many common disinfectants, which enables the bacteria to survive for long periods in the environment.\n\nInfection of humans usually occurs by inhalation of these organisms from air that contains airborne barnyard dust contaminated by dried placental material, birth fluids, and excreta of infected animals. Other modes of transmission to humans, including tick bites, ingestion of unpasteurized milk or dairy products, and human to human transmission, are rare. Humans are often very susceptible to the disease, and very few organisms may be required to cause infection.\"\n\nQ fever is an important zoonosis, with veterinarians, laboratory workers, farmers and abattoir workers at risk. Surveys have shown that significant numbers of livestock handlers have antibodies, indicating exposure to the organism.\n\nLess than half of people infected become ill, and most infections are mild. But affected persons can develop a high fever with headache, muscle pains, sore throat, nausea and vomiting, chest and stomach pains. The fever can last for one or 2 weeks and lead to pneumonia or affect the liver. Treatment involves long term antibiotic therapy.\n\nIn a small percentage of cases, a chronic, severe debilitating disease occurs. People with suppressed immune systems and those with pre-existing heart valve problems are at risk of this complication, which is often fatal. There is also a post Q fever syndrome of chronic fatigue.\n\nQ fever is the 2nd most commonly reported laboratory infection, with several recorded outbreaks involving 15 or more persons http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Media_Center/docs/pdf/Disease_cards/Q-FEVER-EN.pdf.\n\nThe following information was obtained from a publication titled \"Epidemiological characteristics of serologically confirmed Q Fever cases in South Korea, 2006-2011.\" In the discussion it was noted that: \"This is the 1st official report on the characteristics of Q fever patients in Korea.

Cattle, sheep, and goats are the primary reservoirs, although a variety of species may be infected. Organisms are excreted in milk, urine, and feces of infected animals. During birthing, the organisms are shed in high numbers within the amniotic fluids and the placenta. The organism is extremely hardy and resistant to heat, drying, and many common disinfectants, which enables the bacteria to survive for long periods in the environment.\n\nInfection of humans usually occurs by inhalation of these organisms from air that contains airborne barnyard dust contaminated by dried placental material, birth fluids, and excreta of infected animals. Other modes of transmission to humans, including tick bites, ingestion of unpasteurized milk or dairy products, and human to human transmission, are rare. Humans are often very susceptible to the disease, and very few organisms may be required to cause infection.\"\n\nQ fever is an important zoonosis, with veterinarians, laboratory workers, farmers and abattoir workers at risk. Surveys have shown that significant numbers of livestock handlers have antibodies, indicating exposure to the organism.\n\nLess than half of people infected become ill, and most infections are mild. But affected persons can develop a high fever with headache, muscle pains, sore throat, nausea and vomiting, chest and stomach pains. The fever can last for one or 2 weeks and lead to pneumonia or affect the liver. Treatment involves long term antibiotic therapy.\n\nIn a small percentage of cases, a chronic, severe debilitating disease occurs. People with suppressed immune systems and those with pre-existing heart valve problems are at risk of this complication, which is often fatal. There is also a post Q fever syndrome of chronic fatigue.\n\nQ fever is the 2nd most commonly reported laboratory infection, with several recorded outbreaks involving 15 or more persons http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Media_Center/docs/pdf/Disease_cards/Q-FEVER-EN.pdf.\n\nThe following information was obtained from a publication titled \"Epidemiological characteristics of serologically confirmed Q Fever cases in South Korea, 2006-2011.\" In the discussion it was noted that: \"This is the 1st official report on the characteristics of Q fever patients in Korea.

There is also a post Q fever syndrome of chronic fatigue.\n\nQ fever is the 2nd most commonly reported laboratory infection, with several recorded outbreaks involving 15 or more persons http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Media_Center/docs/pdf/Disease_cards/Q-FEVER-EN.pdf.\n\nThe following information was obtained from a publication titled \"Epidemiological characteristics of serologically confirmed Q Fever cases in South Korea, 2006-2011.\" In the discussion it was noted that: \"This is the 1st official report on the characteristics of Q fever patients in Korea. The annual incidence of Q fever in Korea is much lower than that in France, Australia and Taiwan (0.02 vs. 2.5, 0.1, and 0.38 per 100 000 population, respectively). As the disease has a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations, from nonspecific febrile illness to neurological disorder, and there are no known outbreaks in Korea, it is difficult for physicians to diagnose Q fever without an increased awareness. Serological diagnostic testing is limited, because it is available at only one national laboratory. Therefore, Q fever is likely to be under-diagnosed and under-reported in Korea.\"\n\n\"According to national surveys of_ C. burnetti _ seroprevalence in the Korean population, the seropositivity rate of high-risk occupation groups, such as dairy farmers, slaughterhouse workers, and veterinarians, was 3.7-10.2 percent (data not shown). Q fever is not currently considered to be a significant threat to public health in Korea. Only sporadic cases have been reported to date, but there is a possibility of an epidemic. Therefore, increased awareness among physicians for better detection and treatment of Q fever, expansion of the diagnostic system, and further investigations for undiscovered risk factors, are persistently required.\"\n\nReference:\nKwak, Wooseok et al (2013) Epidemiological Characteristics of Serologically Confirmed Q Fever Cases in South Korea, 2006-2011. Osong Public Health and Research Perspectives, Volume 4 , Issue 1, 34-38 http://www.kcdc-phrp.org/article/S2210-9099(12)00102-6/fulltext or http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3747682/.\n\nThis immediate notification report does not mention what actions, if any, were taken to address the exposed human population. Such information may be of value in future follow-up reports, particularly given that the disease in humans is under-reported.\n\nAccording to information available in the OIE WAHID database, through June 2013, Q-fever was considered absent http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Countryinformation/Animalsituation. Therefore, any additional information on Q-fever in South Korea during the 2nd semester of 2013 would be of interest, especially with respect to the number and location of previous outbreaks, given that the last reported event occurred on 16 Jul 2013. - Mod.CRD\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/195.]\nSee Also\nQ fever - Germany: (BY) human, animal 20140511.2464862\nQ fever - Spain: (PV) 20140409.2393194\n2013\n----\nQ fever - French Guiana: (CY) virulent genotype, alert 20130625.1790517\nQ fever - Brazil (02) (MG) NOT 20130619.1782145\nQ fever - Brazil: (MG) 20130617.1777459\nQ fever - Hungary: (BA) RFI 20130607.1760537\nQ fever - Spain (02): (AN) background 20130504.1691296\nQ fever - Spain: (AN) 20130503.1689392\nQ fever - Argentina: (CB) ticks, 1st report 20130418.1655919\n.................................................crd/msp/jw", "reports": [{"diseases": ["unknown", "other", "q fever"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2014-03-16 00:00:00", "2014-06-25 00:00:00", "2014-05-16 00:00:00", "2014-05-16 00:00:00", "2014-03-16 00:00:00", "2014-05-16 00:00:00", "2013-03-16 00:00:00", "2013-06-16 00:00:00", "2013-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "South Korea", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Australia", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Brazil", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "France", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "WAHID", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Korea", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Spain", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Sejong - Si", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Taiwan", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "2464862", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Q fever - Germany: (BY) human, animal", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=2464862", "date": "2013-05-04 10:06:52", "main_text": "Q FEVER - SPAIN (02): (ANDALUSIA) BACKGROUND\n********************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Sat 4 May 2013\nSource: GIDEON (Global Infectious Disease Epidemiology Network) [edited]\nhttp://www.gideononline.com\n\n\nThe following background data on Q fever in Spain are abstracted from Gideon http://www.gideononline.com and the Gideon e-book series.

There\nare unconfirmed reports of up to 6 cases presenting at the Coffs\nHarbour Health Campus during the past 6 weeks.\n\nQ Fever is a disease contracted by infection from bacteria found\ntypically in the urine, feces, or milk from cattle and sheep. The\ndirector of public health for the North Coast, Paul Corben, said there\nwas a vaccine available for those working with animals, like vets and\nabattoir workers, but it was a 2-step process which involved a skin\ntest and blood sample before the doctor made a decision, because if\nthe person showed evidence of prior immunity, the vaccine caused \"a\nnasty local reaction.\"\n\nMr Corbin said while they had seen a couple of probable or confirmed\ncases of Q fever from south of Coffs Harbour to as far north as\nWoolgoolga, there was nothing that warranted extra follow-up or\nindicated a higher risk than normal. He said the North Coast averaged\nabout 40 confirmed cases of Q fever annually.\n\nA reader who contacted The Advocate said one man from Emerald Beach\nhad died and she had almost lost a friend this week [week of 28 Mar\n2011], who was now in the intensive care unit. She believed the cases\nwere focused on the northern beaches. \"It is not where you would\nnormally find Q fever,\" Mr Corben said. \"But it is a hardy bacterium\nand very persistent in the environment. We have done normal follow-up\nand there is nothing that links those people together. We are still\nwaiting for some lab reports. You traditionally think of Q fever as\nassociated with farm areas but there have been recent outbreaks in\nother areas.\n\nMr Corben said Q fever was particularly likely to be associated with\nanimal birthing times.\n\n[Byline: Belinda Scott]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nHealthMap Alerts via ProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The Coffs Coast area of New South Wales can be seen on the\nHealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at\nhttp://healthmap.org/r/0DPp. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ]\n\n[Q fever was first described in Australia where this posting\noriginates. It was called \"Query fever\" because the causative agent\nwas initially unknown. _Coxiella burnetii_, the causative agent, was\ndiscovered in 1937. This organism is an agent that can be resistant to\nheat and desiccation and highly infectious by the aerosol route. A\nsingle inhaled organism may produce clinical illness. Indeed, in\n[non-human] primates, the dose to kill 50 percent of the primates was\nfound to be 1.7 organisms (1).\n\nCattle, sheep, and goats are the primary reservoirs of _C. burnetii_.\nInfection has been noted in a wide variety of other animals, including\nother species of livestock and domesticated pets. _C. burnetii_ does\nnot usually cause clinical disease in these animals, although abortion\nin goats and sheep has been linked to _C. burnetii_ infection.\nOrganisms are excreted in milk, urine, and feces of infected animals.\nMost importantly, during birthing the organisms are shed in high\nnumbers within the amniotic fluids and the placenta. Contact with\ncontaminated wool is known to be a mode of transmission (2).\n\nThe organisms can be resistant to heat, drying, and many common\ndisinfectants. These features enable the bacteria to survive for long\nperiods in the environment. This very stable form of _C. burnetii_ is\nassociated with compact small-cell variants of the organism that are\nproduced during standard replication (along with the less resistant\nlarge-cell form) and are metabolically dormant and spore-like (3).\n\nThe Q fever organism is a category B bioterrorism agent and, in fact,\nalthough not thought to be related to bioterrorism, was spread by mail\nin a post office in the UK in 1987 (4).\n\nInfection of humans usually occurs by inhalation of these organisms\nfrom air that contains airborne barnyard dust contaminated by dried\nplacental material, birth fluids, and excreta of infected herd\nanimals. Humans are often very susceptible to the disease, and very\nfew organisms may be required to cause infection.\n\nIngestion of contaminated milk, followed by regurgitation and\ninspiration of the contaminated food, is a less common mode of\ntransmission. Instances of other modes of transmission to humans,\nincluding tick bites and human to human transmission, are rare.\n\nAn earlier outbreak of infection in 51 persons in Scotland, UK, was\ntied to a meat processing plant and appeared to spread via aerosol for\nat least 0.5 mi (0.8 km).\n\nReferences\n----------\n1.

The\ndirector of public health for the North Coast, Paul Corben, said there\nwas a vaccine available for those working with animals, like vets and\nabattoir workers, but it was a 2-step process which involved a skin\ntest and blood sample before the doctor made a decision, because if\nthe person showed evidence of prior immunity, the vaccine caused \"a\nnasty local reaction.\"\n\nMr Corbin said while they had seen a couple of probable or confirmed\ncases of Q fever from south of Coffs Harbour to as far north as\nWoolgoolga, there was nothing that warranted extra follow-up or\nindicated a higher risk than normal.

We have done normal follow-up\nand there is nothing that links those people together. We are still\nwaiting for some lab reports.

It was called \"Query fever\" because the causative agent\nwas initially unknown. _Coxiella burnetii_, the causative agent, was\ndiscovered in 1937. This organism is an agent that can be resistant to\nheat and desiccation and highly infectious by the aerosol route. A\nsingle inhaled organism may produce clinical illness. Indeed, in\n[non-human] primates, the dose to kill 50 percent of the primates was\nfound to be 1.7 organisms (1).\n\nCattle, sheep, and goats are the primary reservoirs of _C. burnetii_.\nInfection has been noted in a wide variety of other animals, including\nother species of livestock and domesticated pets. _C. burnetii_ does\nnot usually cause clinical disease in these animals, although abortion\nin goats and sheep has been linked to _C. burnetii_ infection.\nOrganisms are excreted in milk, urine, and feces of infected animals.\nMost importantly, during birthing the organisms are shed in high\nnumbers within the amniotic fluids and the placenta. Contact with\ncontaminated wool is known to be a mode of transmission (2).\n\nThe organisms can be resistant to heat, drying, and many common\ndisinfectants. These features enable the bacteria to survive for long\nperiods in the environment. This very stable form of _C. burnetii_ is\nassociated with compact small-cell variants of the organism that are\nproduced during standard replication (along with the less resistant\nlarge-cell form) and are metabolically dormant and spore-like (3).\n\nThe Q fever organism is a category B bioterrorism agent and, in fact,\nalthough not thought to be related to bioterrorism, was spread by mail\nin a post office in the UK in 1987 (4).\n\nInfection of humans usually occurs by inhalation of these organisms\nfrom air that contains airborne barnyard dust contaminated by dried\nplacental material, birth fluids, and excreta of infected herd\nanimals. Humans are often very susceptible to the disease, and very\nfew organisms may be required to cause infection.\n\nIngestion of contaminated milk, followed by regurgitation and\ninspiration of the contaminated food, is a less common mode of\ntransmission. Instances of other modes of transmission to humans,\nincluding tick bites and human to human transmission, are rare.\n\nAn earlier outbreak of infection in 51 persons in Scotland, UK, was\ntied to a meat processing plant and appeared to spread via aerosol for\nat least 0.5 mi (0.8 km).\n\nReferences\n----------\n1.

The\ndirector of public health for the North Coast, Paul Corben, said there\nwas a vaccine available for those working with animals, like vets and\nabattoir workers, but it was a 2-step process which involved a skin\ntest and blood sample before the doctor made a decision, because if\nthe person showed evidence of prior immunity, the vaccine caused \"a\nnasty local reaction.\"\n\nMr Corbin said while they had seen a couple of probable or confirmed\ncases of Q fever from south of Coffs Harbour to as far north as\nWoolgoolga, there was nothing that warranted extra follow-up or\nindicated a higher risk than normal.

We have done normal follow-up\nand there is nothing that links those people together. We are still\nwaiting for some lab reports.

It was called \"Query fever\" because the causative agent\nwas initially unknown. _Coxiella burnetii_, the causative agent, was\ndiscovered in 1937. This organism is an agent that can be resistant to\nheat and desiccation and highly infectious by the aerosol route. A\nsingle inhaled organism may produce clinical illness. Indeed, in\n[non-human] primates, the dose to kill 50 percent of the primates was\nfound to be 1.7 organisms (1).\n\nCattle, sheep, and goats are the primary reservoirs of _C. burnetii_.\nInfection has been noted in a wide variety of other animals, including\nother species of livestock and domesticated pets. _C. burnetii_ does\nnot usually cause clinical disease in these animals, although abortion\nin goats and sheep has been linked to _C. burnetii_ infection.\nOrganisms are excreted in milk, urine, and feces of infected animals.\nMost importantly, during birthing the organisms are shed in high\nnumbers within the amniotic fluids and the placenta. Contact with\ncontaminated wool is known to be a mode of transmission (2).\n\nThe organisms can be resistant to heat, drying, and many common\ndisinfectants. These features enable the bacteria to survive for long\nperiods in the environment. This very stable form of _C. burnetii_ is\nassociated with compact small-cell variants of the organism that are\nproduced during standard replication (along with the less resistant\nlarge-cell form) and are metabolically dormant and spore-like (3).\n\nThe Q fever organism is a category B bioterrorism agent and, in fact,\nalthough not thought to be related to bioterrorism, was spread by mail\nin a post office in the UK in 1987 (4).\n\nInfection of humans usually occurs by inhalation of these organisms\nfrom air that contains airborne barnyard dust contaminated by dried\nplacental material, birth fluids, and excreta of infected herd\nanimals. Humans are often very susceptible to the disease, and very\nfew organisms may be required to cause infection.\n\nIngestion of contaminated milk, followed by regurgitation and\ninspiration of the contaminated food, is a less common mode of\ntransmission. Instances of other modes of transmission to humans,\nincluding tick bites and human to human transmission, are rare.\n\nAn earlier outbreak of infection in 51 persons in Scotland, UK, was\ntied to a meat processing plant and appeared to spread via aerosol for\nat least 0.5 mi (0.8 km).\n\nReferences\n----------\n1.

There\nare unconfirmed reports of up to 6 cases presenting at the Coffs\nHarbour Health Campus during the past 6 weeks.\n\nQ Fever is a disease contracted by infection from bacteria found\ntypically in the urine, feces, or milk from cattle and sheep. The\ndirector of public health for the North Coast, Paul Corben, said there\nwas a vaccine available for those working with animals, like vets and\nabattoir workers, but it was a 2-step process which involved a skin\ntest and blood sample before the doctor made a decision, because if\nthe person showed evidence of prior immunity, the vaccine caused \"a\nnasty local reaction.\"\n\nMr Corbin said while they had seen a couple of probable or confirmed\ncases of Q fever from south of Coffs Harbour to as far north as\nWoolgoolga, there was nothing that warranted extra follow-up or\nindicated a higher risk than normal. He said the North Coast averaged\nabout 40 confirmed cases of Q fever annually.\n\nA reader who contacted The Advocate said one man from Emerald Beach\nhad died and she had almost lost a friend this week [week of 28 Mar\n2011], who was now in the intensive care unit. She believed the cases\nwere focused on the northern beaches. \"It is not where you would\nnormally find Q fever,\" Mr Corben said. \"But it is a hardy bacterium\nand very persistent in the environment. We have done normal follow-up\nand there is nothing that links those people together. We are still\nwaiting for some lab reports. You traditionally think of Q fever as\nassociated with farm areas but there have been recent outbreaks in\nother areas.\n\nMr Corben said Q fever was particularly likely to be associated with\nanimal birthing times.\n\n[Byline: Belinda Scott]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nHealthMap Alerts via ProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The Coffs Coast area of New South Wales can be seen on the\nHealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at\nhttp://healthmap.org/r/0DPp. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ]\n\n[Q fever was first described in Australia where this posting\noriginates. It was called \"Query fever\" because the causative agent\nwas initially unknown. _Coxiella burnetii_, the causative agent, was\ndiscovered in 1937. This organism is an agent that can be resistant to\nheat and desiccation and highly infectious by the aerosol route. A\nsingle inhaled organism may produce clinical illness. Indeed, in\n[non-human] primates, the dose to kill 50 percent of the primates was\nfound to be 1.7 organisms (1).\n\nCattle, sheep, and goats are the primary reservoirs of _C. burnetii_.\nInfection has been noted in a wide variety of other animals, including\nother species of livestock and domesticated pets. _C. burnetii_ does\nnot usually cause clinical disease in these animals, although abortion\nin goats and sheep has been linked to _C. burnetii_ infection.\nOrganisms are excreted in milk, urine, and feces of infected animals.\nMost importantly, during birthing the organisms are shed in high\nnumbers within the amniotic fluids and the placenta. Contact with\ncontaminated wool is known to be a mode of transmission (2).\n\nThe organisms can be resistant to heat, drying, and many common\ndisinfectants. These features enable the bacteria to survive for long\nperiods in the environment. This very stable form of _C. burnetii_ is\nassociated with compact small-cell variants of the organism that are\nproduced during standard replication (along with the less resistant\nlarge-cell form) and are metabolically dormant and spore-like (3).\n\nThe Q fever organism is a category B bioterrorism agent and, in fact,\nalthough not thought to be related to bioterrorism, was spread by mail\nin a post office in the UK in 1987 (4).\n\nInfection of humans usually occurs by inhalation of these organisms\nfrom air that contains airborne barnyard dust contaminated by dried\nplacental material, birth fluids, and excreta of infected herd\nanimals. Humans are often very susceptible to the disease, and very\nfew organisms may be required to cause infection.\n\nIngestion of contaminated milk, followed by regurgitation and\ninspiration of the contaminated food, is a less common mode of\ntransmission. Instances of other modes of transmission to humans,\nincluding tick bites and human to human transmission, are rare.\n\nAn earlier outbreak of infection in 51 persons in Scotland, UK, was\ntied to a meat processing plant and appeared to spread via aerosol for\nat least 0.5 mi (0.8 km).\n\nReferences\n----------\n1.

Dr Menzies is gratefully\nacknowledged. - Mod.AS]\n\nPaula Menzies (Canada): Q fever and coxiellosis in Canada\n---------------------------------------------------------\nAlthough small ruminant numbers are lower in Canada than in other\ncountries, in Ontario sheep and goats are often raised in confinement\nsituations with high stocking densities.\n\nReported human Q fever (notifiable) cases are low in Ontario.\nCoxiellosis (Q fever) is not reportable in animals, but annually\nnotifiable. No action is taken by the federal or provincial\ngovernments after diagnosis. No routine surveillance in animals is\ncurrently performed.\n\nOutbreaks of human Q fever are usually related to visiting farms and\nfairs and outbreaks of abortion in sheep and goats due to _Coxiella_\n-- but human disease has been associated with parturient cats with no\ncontact with livestock. No human cases have been linked to infection\nin cattle; but there are links with wildlife, such as, snaring hares.\nAfter the cod fishery collapsed, Newfoundland imported goats to start\na dairy goat industry. The outbreak of coxiellosis associated with\nmixing of these introduced animals resulted in 80 cases of human Q\nfever in the surrounding community.\n\nCoxiellosis -- the disease in animals -- is unlikely to become\nreportable in Canada. Q fever in humans is likely under-diagnosed in\ngeneral. Better communication of the risks of this infection to\nmedical health professionals and the public in general, is needed. A\nsero-prevalence study in sheep and goat flocks and their caregivers\nis commencing in May [2010] in Ontario. This will help to clarify the\nimportance of the infection in this province.\n\n--\nDr Paula I Menzies\nAssoc Professor Dip.ECSRHM\nSmall Ruminant Research Coordinator\nRuminant Health Management Group\nDepartment of Population Medicine\nOntario Veterinary College, University of Guelph\nGuelph, Ontario Canada N1G 2W1\n<pmenzies@uoguelph.ca>\n\n[The CFIA (Canadian Food Inspection Agency) website\n(<http://www.inspection.gc.ca/english/anima/disemala/guidee.shtml>)\nincludes 3 lists of animal diseases:\n\n1. A list of the (32) reportable animal diseases (as mentioned by Dr\nMenzies, Q fever not included).\nAnimal owners, veterinarians and laboratories are required to\nimmediately report the presence of an animal that is contaminated or\nsuspected of being contaminated with one of these diseases to a CFIA\ndistrict veterinarian. Control or eradication measures will be\napplied immediately.\n\n2. Immediately notifiable diseases (for laboratories only).\nIn general, immediately notifiable diseases are diseases exotic to\nCanada for which there are no control or eradication programs.\nThe CFIA can undertake control measures for such diseases when\nnotified of their presence in Canada. This category also includes\nsome rare indigenous diseases. A herd or flock of origin must be\ncertified as being free from these diseases in order to meet import\nrequirements of trading partners.\n\n3. Annually notifiable diseases (for laboratories only; Q fever included).\nAnnually notifiable diseases are diseases for which Canada must\nsubmit an annual report to the World Organisation for Animal Health\n(OIE) indicating their presence within Canada. In general, they are\ndiseases that are present in Canada, but are not classified as\nreportable or immediately notifiable.\n- Mod.AS]\nSee Also\nQ fever - Netherlands (19): Canadian policy clarified 20100306.0742\nQ fever - Netherlands (18): update & review 20100303.0703\n...................................arn/mj/lm\n\n*##########################################################*\n************************************************************\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.

Why are all pregnant animals on infected large dairy\nfarms culled, while those in small holdings and children's farms are\nnot? Is this not a double standard? The answer is: It seems so, but\nthere are good reasons for the distinction.\n\nAll control measures are considered from a public health point of\nview. During 2009, 2300 people became ill in the Netherlands from the\nQ fever bacterium. Therefore, everything is now focused on the aim to\nreduce this number as far as possible over the coming years.\n\nCulling in infected, large-scale holdings\n-----------------------------------\nThe greatest risk to public health is posed by large groups of\npregnant dairy goats and sheep, which excrete very large quantities of\nthe Q fever bacteria during normal birthing or abortions. This was\nindicated in the advice received from the expert group led by Roel\nCoutinho of RIVM (the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and\nEnvironment). If an infected goat gives birth to a live lamb, millions\nof Q-fever bacteria are released; in case of an abortion, their\nnumbers go into the billions.\n\nIn large farms, most matings are managed to take place within a short\nperiod, or mating is synchronised, leading to the birth of many\nanimals taking place during comparatively short periods, many on the\nsame days. Similarly, abortions, if occurring, may involve many\nanimals, sometimes taking the form of abortion \"storms.\" In case those\nanimals are infected by Q fever, this means the excretion of very\nlarge quantities of bacteria by many animals simultaneously: This is\nthe greatest threat to public health. Consequently, the presence of\ninfected pregnant animals on the farm should be prevented ahead of the\nlambing season (which usually starts in January). Since individual\ntesting of animals in the short term is not possible, all pregnant\nanimals on infected farms should be culled. [Subscribers are also\nreferred to the research paper cited in the commentary to posting\n20100107.0079. The authors indicated, among other things, that \"the\nstudy showed that a non-negligible [i.e. epidemiologically significant\n- Mod.JW] proportion of seronegative animals that delivered normally\ncould excrete _C. burnetii_.\" - Mod.AS]\n\nSaving animals on children's farms\n---------------------------------\nQ fever may infect sheep and goats also on petting farms, small\nholders' yards or occupational therapeutic farms (\"businesses with a\npublic function\".) The difference between these farms and large\nmilk-producing goat or sheep farms is the number of animals crowded\ntogether and birthing (or aborting) simultaneously. In small-scale\nfarms, there are fewer animals in a state of Q fever bacteria\nsecretion. Therefore, these holdings pose a lower risk to human\nhealth, and the pregnant animals on these farms are not culled.\n\nResearch shows that, so far, the Q fever bacterium has hardly ever\nbeen found in children's farms. Yet, visitors to petting farms where Q\nfever-infected sheep or goats are kept may always be exposed to some\nrisk of getting infected.\n\nThe RIVM-led expert group was asked to provide advice pertaining to\nthe said risk on petting farms or other small-scale holdings with less\nthan 50 animals. According to experts, it is generally not necessary\nto take additional measures concerning such holdings.\n\nHowever, it was recommended to pay special attention to hygiene on\nchildren's farms. In addition, children's (\"petting\") farms and\noccupational therapeutic farms are advised to let the birthing take\nplace in separate pens without pubic access. This will prevent contact\nbetween infected birthing or aborting animals and visitors, and the\nexcretion of bacteria close to visitors, and further diminish the risk\nof infection.\n\nFurthermore, it has been decided that petting and therapeutic farms\nwill be vaccinated with priority. Fortunately, there is vaccine enough\navailable for all such establishments.\n\nAdults and children visiting petting farms are advised to pay\nattention to hygiene. Appropriate advisory information is available on\nthe website of the VWA (Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority).\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Additional explanation on the significant weight of the large dairy\ngoat farms in the large-scale dissemination of _C. burnetii_ can be\nfound in the advisory letter to Ministers sent by Prof Coutinho on 17\nJul 2009. It provided several examples demonstrating the temporal and\nspatial association between large, infected dairy goat farms and human\ninfection. The 1st example (2007) came from Herpen village, where many\nhuman infections were recorded around a goat farm with an abortion\nstorm. A significant case was that of Helmond town in 2008: the\npercentage of infected humans increased in proportion to the proximity\nof their dwellings to a large dairy goat establishment. Similar\nfindings of measurable connections were recorded in South Limburg.\n\nA map showing all commercial dairy goat/sheep flocks regarded infected\nas of 8 Jan 2010, indicating the 5-km zone around each, is available\nat\n<http://www.rivm.nl/cib/binaries/gebiedskaart_100108_tcm92-65083.pdf>.\n\nA map showing municipalities with notified Q fever patients (per 100\n000), 1 Jan-22 Dec 2009, as well as the locations of infected\ncommercial dairy goat farms, is available at\n<http://www.rivm.nl/cib/binaries/Q-koorts%20incidentie_tcm92-60500.pdf>.\n\nA 62nd infected farm has been officially added to the list on 9 Jan\n2010, located in Een West in Drente province. The holding includes 450\ngoats, 249 of them pregnant; those are to be culled on 11 Jan 2010\n(today).\n\nThe Dutch delegation is expected to present an updating report on the\nQ fever situation during the next meeting of the EU's Standing\nCommittee on the Food Chain and Animal Health (SCFCAH), due in\nBrussels on Tue 12 Jan 2010.

Why are all pregnant animals on infected large dairy\nfarms culled, while those in small holdings and children's farms are\nnot? Is this not a double standard? The answer is: It seems so, but\nthere are good reasons for the distinction.\n\nAll control measures are considered from a public health point of\nview. During 2009, 2300 people became ill in the Netherlands from the\nQ fever bacterium. Therefore, everything is now focused on the aim to\nreduce this number as far as possible over the coming years.\n\nCulling in infected, large-scale holdings\n-----------------------------------\nThe greatest risk to public health is posed by large groups of\npregnant dairy goats and sheep, which excrete very large quantities of\nthe Q fever bacteria during normal birthing or abortions. This was\nindicated in the advice received from the expert group led by Roel\nCoutinho of RIVM (the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and\nEnvironment). If an infected goat gives birth to a live lamb, millions\nof Q-fever bacteria are released; in case of an abortion, their\nnumbers go into the billions.\n\nIn large farms, most matings are managed to take place within a short\nperiod, or mating is synchronised, leading to the birth of many\nanimals taking place during comparatively short periods, many on the\nsame days. Similarly, abortions, if occurring, may involve many\nanimals, sometimes taking the form of abortion \"storms.\" In case those\nanimals are infected by Q fever, this means the excretion of very\nlarge quantities of bacteria by many animals simultaneously: This is\nthe greatest threat to public health. Consequently, the presence of\ninfected pregnant animals on the farm should be prevented ahead of the\nlambing season (which usually starts in January). Since individual\ntesting of animals in the short term is not possible, all pregnant\nanimals on infected farms should be culled. [Subscribers are also\nreferred to the research paper cited in the commentary to posting\n20100107.0079. The authors indicated, among other things, that \"the\nstudy showed that a non-negligible [i.e. epidemiologically significant\n- Mod.JW] proportion of seronegative animals that delivered normally\ncould excrete _C. burnetii_.\" - Mod.AS]\n\nSaving animals on children's farms\n---------------------------------\nQ fever may infect sheep and goats also on petting farms, small\nholders' yards or occupational therapeutic farms (\"businesses with a\npublic function\".) The difference between these farms and large\nmilk-producing goat or sheep farms is the number of animals crowded\ntogether and birthing (or aborting) simultaneously. In small-scale\nfarms, there are fewer animals in a state of Q fever bacteria\nsecretion. Therefore, these holdings pose a lower risk to human\nhealth, and the pregnant animals on these farms are not culled.\n\nResearch shows that, so far, the Q fever bacterium has hardly ever\nbeen found in children's farms. Yet, visitors to petting farms where Q\nfever-infected sheep or goats are kept may always be exposed to some\nrisk of getting infected.\n\nThe RIVM-led expert group was asked to provide advice pertaining to\nthe said risk on petting farms or other small-scale holdings with less\nthan 50 animals. According to experts, it is generally not necessary\nto take additional measures concerning such holdings.\n\nHowever, it was recommended to pay special attention to hygiene on\nchildren's farms. In addition, children's (\"petting\") farms and\noccupational therapeutic farms are advised to let the birthing take\nplace in separate pens without pubic access. This will prevent contact\nbetween infected birthing or aborting animals and visitors, and the\nexcretion of bacteria close to visitors, and further diminish the risk\nof infection.\n\nFurthermore, it has been decided that petting and therapeutic farms\nwill be vaccinated with priority. Fortunately, there is vaccine enough\navailable for all such establishments.\n\nAdults and children visiting petting farms are advised to pay\nattention to hygiene. Appropriate advisory information is available on\nthe website of the VWA (Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority).\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Additional explanation on the significant weight of the large dairy\ngoat farms in the large-scale dissemination of _C. burnetii_ can be\nfound in the advisory letter to Ministers sent by Prof Coutinho on 17\nJul 2009. It provided several examples demonstrating the temporal and\nspatial association between large, infected dairy goat farms and human\ninfection. The 1st example (2007) came from Herpen village, where many\nhuman infections were recorded around a goat farm with an abortion\nstorm. A significant case was that of Helmond town in 2008: the\npercentage of infected humans increased in proportion to the proximity\nof their dwellings to a large dairy goat establishment.

Why are all pregnant animals on infected large dairy\nfarms culled, while those in small holdings and children's farms are\nnot? Is this not a double standard? The answer is: It seems so, but\nthere are good reasons for the distinction.\n\nAll control measures are considered from a public health point of\nview. During 2009, 2300 people became ill in the Netherlands from the\nQ fever bacterium. Therefore, everything is now focused on the aim to\nreduce this number as far as possible over the coming years.\n\nCulling in infected, large-scale holdings\n-----------------------------------\nThe greatest risk to public health is posed by large groups of\npregnant dairy goats and sheep, which excrete very large quantities of\nthe Q fever bacteria during normal birthing or abortions. This was\nindicated in the advice received from the expert group led by Roel\nCoutinho of RIVM (the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and\nEnvironment). If an infected goat gives birth to a live lamb, millions\nof Q-fever bacteria are released; in case of an abortion, their\nnumbers go into the billions.\n\nIn large farms, most matings are managed to take place within a short\nperiod, or mating is synchronised, leading to the birth of many\nanimals taking place during comparatively short periods, many on the\nsame days. Similarly, abortions, if occurring, may involve many\nanimals, sometimes taking the form of abortion \"storms.\" In case those\nanimals are infected by Q fever, this means the excretion of very\nlarge quantities of bacteria by many animals simultaneously: This is\nthe greatest threat to public health. Consequently, the presence of\ninfected pregnant animals on the farm should be prevented ahead of the\nlambing season (which usually starts in January). Since individual\ntesting of animals in the short term is not possible, all pregnant\nanimals on infected farms should be culled. [Subscribers are also\nreferred to the research paper cited in the commentary to posting\n20100107.0079. The authors indicated, among other things, that \"the\nstudy showed that a non-negligible [i.e. epidemiologically significant\n- Mod.JW] proportion of seronegative animals that delivered normally\ncould excrete _C. burnetii_.\" - Mod.AS]\n\nSaving animals on children's farms\n---------------------------------\nQ fever may infect sheep and goats also on petting farms, small\nholders' yards or occupational therapeutic farms (\"businesses with a\npublic function\".) The difference between these farms and large\nmilk-producing goat or sheep farms is the number of animals crowded\ntogether and birthing (or aborting) simultaneously. In small-scale\nfarms, there are fewer animals in a state of Q fever bacteria\nsecretion. Therefore, these holdings pose a lower risk to human\nhealth, and the pregnant animals on these farms are not culled.\n\nResearch shows that, so far, the Q fever bacterium has hardly ever\nbeen found in children's farms. Yet, visitors to petting farms where Q\nfever-infected sheep or goats are kept may always be exposed to some\nrisk of getting infected.\n\nThe RIVM-led expert group was asked to provide advice pertaining to\nthe said risk on petting farms or other small-scale holdings with less\nthan 50 animals. According to experts, it is generally not necessary\nto take additional measures concerning such holdings.\n\nHowever, it was recommended to pay special attention to hygiene on\nchildren's farms. In addition, children's (\"petting\") farms and\noccupational therapeutic farms are advised to let the birthing take\nplace in separate pens without pubic access. This will prevent contact\nbetween infected birthing or aborting animals and visitors, and the\nexcretion of bacteria close to visitors, and further diminish the risk\nof infection.\n\nFurthermore, it has been decided that petting and therapeutic farms\nwill be vaccinated with priority. Fortunately, there is vaccine enough\navailable for all such establishments.\n\nAdults and children visiting petting farms are advised to pay\nattention to hygiene. Appropriate advisory information is available on\nthe website of the VWA (Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority).\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Additional explanation on the significant weight of the large dairy\ngoat farms in the large-scale dissemination of _C. burnetii_ can be\nfound in the advisory letter to Ministers sent by Prof Coutinho on 17\nJul 2009. It provided several examples demonstrating the temporal and\nspatial association between large, infected dairy goat farms and human\ninfection. The 1st example (2007) came from Herpen village, where many\nhuman infections were recorded around a goat farm with an abortion\nstorm. A significant case was that of Helmond town in 2008: the\npercentage of infected humans increased in proportion to the proximity\nof their dwellings to a large dairy goat establishment.

Why are all pregnant animals on infected large dairy\nfarms culled, while those in small holdings and children's farms are\nnot? Is this not a double standard? The answer is: It seems so, but\nthere are good reasons for the distinction.\n\nAll control measures are considered from a public health point of\nview. During 2009, 2300 people became ill in the Netherlands from the\nQ fever bacterium. Therefore, everything is now focused on the aim to\nreduce this number as far as possible over the coming years.\n\nCulling in infected, large-scale holdings\n-----------------------------------\nThe greatest risk to public health is posed by large groups of\npregnant dairy goats and sheep, which excrete very large quantities of\nthe Q fever bacteria during normal birthing or abortions. This was\nindicated in the advice received from the expert group led by Roel\nCoutinho of RIVM (the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and\nEnvironment). If an infected goat gives birth to a live lamb, millions\nof Q-fever bacteria are released; in case of an abortion, their\nnumbers go into the billions.\n\nIn large farms, most matings are managed to take place within a short\nperiod, or mating is synchronised, leading to the birth of many\nanimals taking place during comparatively short periods, many on the\nsame days. Similarly, abortions, if occurring, may involve many\nanimals, sometimes taking the form of abortion \"storms.\" In case those\nanimals are infected by Q fever, this means the excretion of very\nlarge quantities of bacteria by many animals simultaneously: This is\nthe greatest threat to public health. Consequently, the presence of\ninfected pregnant animals on the farm should be prevented ahead of the\nlambing season (which usually starts in January). Since individual\ntesting of animals in the short term is not possible, all pregnant\nanimals on infected farms should be culled. [Subscribers are also\nreferred to the research paper cited in the commentary to posting\n20100107.0079. The authors indicated, among other things, that \"the\nstudy showed that a non-negligible [i.e. epidemiologically significant\n- Mod.JW] proportion of seronegative animals that delivered normally\ncould excrete _C. burnetii_.\" - Mod.AS]\n\nSaving animals on children's farms\n---------------------------------\nQ fever may infect sheep and goats also on petting farms, small\nholders' yards or occupational therapeutic farms (\"businesses with a\npublic function\".) The difference between these farms and large\nmilk-producing goat or sheep farms is the number of animals crowded\ntogether and birthing (or aborting) simultaneously. In small-scale\nfarms, there are fewer animals in a state of Q fever bacteria\nsecretion. Therefore, these holdings pose a lower risk to human\nhealth, and the pregnant animals on these farms are not culled.\n\nResearch shows that, so far, the Q fever bacterium has hardly ever\nbeen found in children's farms. Yet, visitors to petting farms where Q\nfever-infected sheep or goats are kept may always be exposed to some\nrisk of getting infected.\n\nThe RIVM-led expert group was asked to provide advice pertaining to\nthe said risk on petting farms or other small-scale holdings with less\nthan 50 animals. According to experts, it is generally not necessary\nto take additional measures concerning such holdings.\n\nHowever, it was recommended to pay special attention to hygiene on\nchildren's farms. In addition, children's (\"petting\") farms and\noccupational therapeutic farms are advised to let the birthing take\nplace in separate pens without pubic access. This will prevent contact\nbetween infected birthing or aborting animals and visitors, and the\nexcretion of bacteria close to visitors, and further diminish the risk\nof infection.\n\nFurthermore, it has been decided that petting and therapeutic farms\nwill be vaccinated with priority. Fortunately, there is vaccine enough\navailable for all such establishments.\n\nAdults and children visiting petting farms are advised to pay\nattention to hygiene. Appropriate advisory information is available on\nthe website of the VWA (Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority).\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Additional explanation on the significant weight of the large dairy\ngoat farms in the large-scale dissemination of _C. burnetii_ can be\nfound in the advisory letter to Ministers sent by Prof Coutinho on 17\nJul 2009. It provided several examples demonstrating the temporal and\nspatial association between large, infected dairy goat farms and human\ninfection. The 1st example (2007) came from Herpen village, where many\nhuman infections were recorded around a goat farm with an abortion\nstorm. A significant case was that of Helmond town in 2008: the\npercentage of infected humans increased in proportion to the proximity\nof their dwellings to a large dairy goat establishment.

Why are all pregnant animals on infected large dairy\nfarms culled, while those in small holdings and children's farms are\nnot? Is this not a double standard? The answer is: It seems so, but\nthere are good reasons for the distinction.\n\nAll control measures are considered from a public health point of\nview. During 2009, 2300 people became ill in the Netherlands from the\nQ fever bacterium. Therefore, everything is now focused on the aim to\nreduce this number as far as possible over the coming years.\n\nCulling in infected, large-scale holdings\n-----------------------------------\nThe greatest risk to public health is posed by large groups of\npregnant dairy goats and sheep, which excrete very large quantities of\nthe Q fever bacteria during normal birthing or abortions. This was\nindicated in the advice received from the expert group led by Roel\nCoutinho of RIVM (the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and\nEnvironment). If an infected goat gives birth to a live lamb, millions\nof Q-fever bacteria are released; in case of an abortion, their\nnumbers go into the billions.\n\nIn large farms, most matings are managed to take place within a short\nperiod, or mating is synchronised, leading to the birth of many\nanimals taking place during comparatively short periods, many on the\nsame days. Similarly, abortions, if occurring, may involve many\nanimals, sometimes taking the form of abortion \"storms.\" In case those\nanimals are infected by Q fever, this means the excretion of very\nlarge quantities of bacteria by many animals simultaneously: This is\nthe greatest threat to public health. Consequently, the presence of\ninfected pregnant animals on the farm should be prevented ahead of the\nlambing season (which usually starts in January). Since individual\ntesting of animals in the short term is not possible, all pregnant\nanimals on infected farms should be culled. [Subscribers are also\nreferred to the research paper cited in the commentary to posting\n20100107.0079. The authors indicated, among other things, that \"the\nstudy showed that a non-negligible [i.e. epidemiologically significant\n- Mod.JW] proportion of seronegative animals that delivered normally\ncould excrete _C. burnetii_.\" - Mod.AS]\n\nSaving animals on children's farms\n---------------------------------\nQ fever may infect sheep and goats also on petting farms, small\nholders' yards or occupational therapeutic farms (\"businesses with a\npublic function\".) The difference between these farms and large\nmilk-producing goat or sheep farms is the number of animals crowded\ntogether and birthing (or aborting) simultaneously. In small-scale\nfarms, there are fewer animals in a state of Q fever bacteria\nsecretion. Therefore, these holdings pose a lower risk to human\nhealth, and the pregnant animals on these farms are not culled.\n\nResearch shows that, so far, the Q fever bacterium has hardly ever\nbeen found in children's farms. Yet, visitors to petting farms where Q\nfever-infected sheep or goats are kept may always be exposed to some\nrisk of getting infected.\n\nThe RIVM-led expert group was asked to provide advice pertaining to\nthe said risk on petting farms or other small-scale holdings with less\nthan 50 animals. According to experts, it is generally not necessary\nto take additional measures concerning such holdings.\n\nHowever, it was recommended to pay special attention to hygiene on\nchildren's farms. In addition, children's (\"petting\") farms and\noccupational therapeutic farms are advised to let the birthing take\nplace in separate pens without pubic access. This will prevent contact\nbetween infected birthing or aborting animals and visitors, and the\nexcretion of bacteria close to visitors, and further diminish the risk\nof infection.\n\nFurthermore, it has been decided that petting and therapeutic farms\nwill be vaccinated with priority. Fortunately, there is vaccine enough\navailable for all such establishments.\n\nAdults and children visiting petting farms are advised to pay\nattention to hygiene. Appropriate advisory information is available on\nthe website of the VWA (Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority).\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Additional explanation on the significant weight of the large dairy\ngoat farms in the large-scale dissemination of _C. burnetii_ can be\nfound in the advisory letter to Ministers sent by Prof Coutinho on 17\nJul 2009. It provided several examples demonstrating the temporal and\nspatial association between large, infected dairy goat farms and human\ninfection. The 1st example (2007) came from Herpen village, where many\nhuman infections were recorded around a goat farm with an abortion\nstorm. A significant case was that of Helmond town in 2008: the\npercentage of infected humans increased in proportion to the proximity\nof their dwellings to a large dairy goat establishment. Similar\nfindings of measurable connections were recorded in South Limburg.\n\nA map showing all commercial dairy goat/sheep flocks regarded infected\nas of 8 Jan 2010, indicating the 5-km zone around each, is available\nat\n<http://www.rivm.nl/cib/binaries/gebiedskaart_100108_tcm92-65083.pdf>.\n\nA map showing municipalities with notified Q fever patients (per 100\n000), 1 Jan-22 Dec 2009, as well as the locations of infected\ncommercial dairy goat farms, is available at\n<http://www.rivm.nl/cib/binaries/Q-koorts%20incidentie_tcm92-60500.pdf>.\n\nA 62nd infected farm has been officially added to the list on 9 Jan\n2010, located in Een West in Drente province. The holding includes 450\ngoats, 249 of them pregnant; those are to be culled on 11 Jan 2010\n(today).\n\nThe Dutch delegation is expected to present an updating report on the\nQ fever situation during the next meeting of the EU's Standing\nCommittee on the Food Chain and Animal Health (SCFCAH), due in\nBrussels on Tue 12 Jan 2010. The last report on the issue (dated 6 Oct\n2009) was presented during the 3 Nov 2009 meeting (available at\n<http://ec.europa.eu/food/committees/regulatory/scfcah/animal_health/presentations/0304112009_q_fever_nl.pdf>).\n\nThose interested in additional information may refer to the paper \"Q\nfever outbreaks in small ruminants and people in the Netherlands\" by\nR.

This was reported by the Animal Health Service in Deventer.\nConfirmation of tests will take another 2 weeks. Measures will not be\napplied until 4 weeks from now.\n\nSo far this year 4 goat farms in the Netherlands were officially declared\ncontaminated, based on a former detection method. A farm was considered\ninfected only if the percentage of abortions was larger than 5 per cent.\nHowever, it appears that the agriculture ministry knew that another 41\nfarms had infected goats, based on milk sample tests. No measures were\napplied to these farms. In sheep farms Q fever is rare. From 40 farms, only\none proved infected.\n\nQ fever is a serious zoonosis, that causes not that severe problems in\ngoats, but has high morbidity in people with serious symptoms: fatigue,\nhigh fever, serious headaches, severe pneumonia, sometimes resulting in\nhospitalization and even death. The causal agent is _Coxiella burnetii_,\nwhich spreads through air. The bacteria is particularly dangerous in case\nof pregnancy or heart valve abnormalities.\n\nIn the Netherlands, the outbreak started in 2007 in Herpen, a village in\nthe south of the country, and since then the disease has spread every year.\n6 people died. This year 2100 people were infected. It is the largest\noutbreak of Q fever ever reported in the world.\n\nControlling the disease is difficult, because the bacteria does not\ndisappear from the soil. Until now, measures consisted of prohibition of\nspreading out manure and moving animals from infected farms.\n\nResults of vaccination are still being investigated by the Animal Health\nService. The vaccine seems to prevent abortion and animals produce\nsufficient antibodies, but it is not clear yet whether excretion of\nbacteria is prevented. Milk production may decrease by 8 to 10 percent in\nthe 1st weeks following vaccination.\n\nThe Dutch authorities commissioned the National Institute for Public Health\nand the Environment (RIVM) to develop scenarios to fight Q fever,\nconsidering also moving or closing down farms.\n\nSource: NOVA/Animal Health Service/Agrarisch dagblad\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[According to data from RIVM (the National Dutch Institute for Public\nHealth and the Environment), as of 29 Oct 2009, 2236 cases of Q fever have\nbeen suspected since 1 Jan 2009, 2126 of which have been\nlaboratory-confirmed and 110 regarded as \"probable\". 6 Q fever patients\ndied.

The paper says over 200\ncases have been reported in recent days, half of them in\nNoord-Brabant province.\n\nQ fever was rarely known among humans in the Netherlands until 2007,\nwhen 168 cases were reported. In 2008, there were more than 1000\ninfections in the Netherlands.\n\nThe infection is spread by livestock, which shed the bacteria in\nurine, feces, birth products, and milk. The bacteria can reach humans\nafter feces and dirty straw are used as fertilizer and blown about,\nthe Volkskrant says. The disease, which leads to spontaneous abortion\nin sheep and goats, causes flu-like symptoms in humans but can lead\nto lung infections.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The pathogenic organism of Q fever, often acquired by close exposure\nto animals, is infectious with a very low inoculum and may be\naerosolized over a distance. It is not clear what contact the\ninfected people had with animals or how close they were to farms.\n\n_Coxiella burnetii_, the causative agent, was discovered in 1937.\nThis organism is an agent that can be resistant to heat and\ndesiccation, and is highly infectious by the aerosol route. A single\ninhaled organism may produce clinical illness. Indeed, in [non-human]\nprimates, the dose to kill 50 percent of the primates was found to be\n1.7 organisms (1).\n\nCattle, sheep, and goats are the primary reservoirs of _C. burnetii_.\nInfection has been noted in a wide variety of other animals,\nincluding other species of livestock and in domesticated pets. _C.\nburnetii_ does not usually cause clinical disease in these animals,\nalthough abortion in goats and sheep has been linked to _C. burnetii_\ninfection. Organisms are excreted in milk, urine, and feces of\ninfected animals. Most importantly, during birthing the organisms are\nshed in high numbers within the amniotic fluids and the placenta.\nContact with contaminated wool is known to be a mode of transmission (2).\n\nThe organisms can be resistant to heat, drying, and many common\ndisinfectants. These features enable the bacteria to survive for long\nperiods in the environment. This very stable form of _C. burnetii_ is\nassociated with compact small cell variants of the organism that are\nproduced during standard replication along with the less resistant\nlarge cell form, metabolically dormant, and spore-like (3).\n\nInfection of humans usually occurs by inhalation of these organisms\nfrom air that contains airborne barnyard dust contaminated by dried\nplacental material, birth fluids, and excreta of infected herd\nanimals. Humans are often very susceptible to the disease, and very\nfew organisms may be required to cause infection.\n\nIngestion of contaminated milk, followed by regurgitation and\ninspiration of the contaminated food, is a less common mode of\ntransmission.

Some\npeople recover without treatment. The infection is often caught by close\ncontact with farm animals but it can be also be blown through the air. A\nteam led by the Health Protection Agency is looking at how residents may\nhave caught the infection.\nEpidemiologist Dr Deirdre Lewis said: \"Q fever is generally a mild\ninfection but we know that it can cause complications, so we've been keen\nto look into this as thoroughly as we can. We've not had any reported cases\nof Q fever in Gloucestershire residents since 2002, so seeing 28, mostly\nfrom the Cheltenham area, is unusual.\"\nThe evidence so far points to the period of risk being more than 3 months\nago. Most of the patients, who are aged between 40 and 70, are said to be\nrecovering well after falling ill earlier in the summer.\nQ, standing for Query, fever, was so called originally because for many\nyears its cause was unknown. It tends to be more common around the lambing\nseason, although it can occur at any time of year.\n\"I appreciate that news of this outbreak will surprise some local people,\"\nsaid Dr Lewis. \"They can be reassured that we're working hard to\ninvestigate it.\"\nAn outbreak of Q fever in Solihull in 1989 led to 147 human cases.\nResearchers have suggested that it was caused by a combination of outdoor\nlambing and calving and particular weather conditions leading to the\ninfective organism being blown several miles to populated areas.\n--\ncommunicated by:\nAndrea Jones\nH Jones and Sons\n<agency@hjones-sons.co.uk>\n[ProMED-mail previously posted regarding the early part of this outbreak [Q\nfever - UK (England): alert, RFI 20070723.2367].\n_Coxiella burnetii_, the causative agent, was discovered in 1937. This\norganism is an agent that can be resistant to heat and desiccation, and is\nhighly infectious by the aerosol route. A single inhaled organism may\nproduce clinical illness. Indeed, in [non-human] primates, the dose to kill\n50 per cent of the primates was found to be 1.7 organisms (1).\nCattle, sheep, and goats are the primary reservoirs of _C. burnetii_.\nInfection has been noted in a wide variety of other animals, including\nother species of livestock and in domesticated pets. _C. burnetii_ does not\nusually cause clinical disease in these animals, although abortion in goats\nand sheep has been linked to _C. burnetii_ infection. Organisms are\nexcreted in milk, urine, and feces of infected animals. Most importantly,\nduring birthing the organisms are shed in high numbers within the amniotic\nfluids and the placenta. Contact with contaminated wool is known to be a\nmode of transmission (2).\nThe organisms can be resistant to heat, drying, and many common\ndisinfectants. These features enable the bacteria to survive for long\nperiods in the environment. This very stable form of _C. burnetii_ is\nassociated with compact small cell variants of the organism that are\nproduced during standard replication along with the less resistant large\ncell form, metabolically dormant, and spore-like (3).\nInfection of humans usually occurs by inhalation of these organisms from\nair that contains airborne barnyard dust contaminated by dried placental\nmaterial, birth fluids, and excreta of infected herd animals. Humans are\noften very susceptible to the disease, and very few organisms may be\nrequired to cause infection.\nIngestion of contaminated milk, followed by regurgitation and inspiration\nof the contaminated food, is a less common mode of transmission. Other\nmodes of transmission to humans, including tick bites and human-to-human\ntransmission, are rare.\n1. Lille RD, Perrin TL, Armstrong C. An institutional outbreak of\npneumonitis. III.

This\norganism is an agent that can be resistant to heat and desiccation, and is\nhighly infectious by the aerosol route. A single inhaled organism may\nproduce clinical illness. Indeed, in [non-human] primates, the dose to kill\n50 per cent of the primates was found to be 1.7 organisms (1).\nCattle, sheep, and goats are the primary reservoirs of _C. burnetii_.\nInfection has been noted in a wide variety of other animals, including\nother species of livestock and in domesticated pets. _C. burnetii_ does not\nusually cause clinical disease in these animals, although abortion in goats\nand sheep has been linked to _C. burnetii_ infection. Organisms are\nexcreted in milk, urine, and feces of infected animals. Most importantly,\nduring birthing the organisms are shed in high numbers within the amniotic\nfluids and the placenta. Contact with contaminated wool is known to be a\nmode of transmission (2).\nThe organisms can be resistant to heat, drying, and many common\ndisinfectants. These features enable the bacteria to survive for long\nperiods in the environment. This very stable form of _C. burnetii_ is\nassociated with compact small cell variants of the organism that are\nproduced during standard replication along with the less resistant large\ncell form, metabolically dormant, and spore-like (3).\nInfection of humans usually occurs by inhalation of these organisms from\nair that contains airborne barnyard dust contaminated by dried placental\nmaterial, birth fluids, and excreta of infected herd animals. Humans are\noften very susceptible to the disease, and very few organisms may be\nrequired to cause infection.\nIngestion of contaminated milk, followed by regurgitation and inspiration\nof the contaminated food, is a less common mode of transmission.

This\norganism is an agent that can be resistant to heat and desiccation, and is\nhighly infectious by the aerosol route. A single inhaled organism may\nproduce clinical illness. Indeed, in [non-human] primates, the dose to kill\n50 per cent of the primates was found to be 1.7 organisms (1).\nCattle, sheep, and goats are the primary reservoirs of _C. burnetii_.\nInfection has been noted in a wide variety of other animals, including\nother species of livestock and in domesticated pets. _C. burnetii_ does not\nusually cause clinical disease in these animals, although abortion in goats\nand sheep has been linked to _C. burnetii_ infection. Organisms are\nexcreted in milk, urine, and feces of infected animals. Most importantly,\nduring birthing the organisms are shed in high numbers within the amniotic\nfluids and the placenta. Contact with contaminated wool is known to be a\nmode of transmission (2).\nThe organisms can be resistant to heat, drying, and many common\ndisinfectants. These features enable the bacteria to survive for long\nperiods in the environment. This very stable form of _C. burnetii_ is\nassociated with compact small cell variants of the organism that are\nproduced during standard replication along with the less resistant large\ncell form, metabolically dormant, and spore-like (3).\nInfection of humans usually occurs by inhalation of these organisms from\nair that contains airborne barnyard dust contaminated by dried placental\nmaterial, birth fluids, and excreta of infected herd animals. Humans are\noften very susceptible to the disease, and very few organisms may be\nrequired to cause infection.\nIngestion of contaminated milk, followed by regurgitation and inspiration\nof the contaminated food, is a less common mode of transmission.

Some\npeople recover without treatment. The infection is often caught by close\ncontact with farm animals but it can be also be blown through the air. A\nteam led by the Health Protection Agency is looking at how residents may\nhave caught the infection.\nEpidemiologist Dr Deirdre Lewis said: \"Q fever is generally a mild\ninfection but we know that it can cause complications, so we've been keen\nto look into this as thoroughly as we can. We've not had any reported cases\nof Q fever in Gloucestershire residents since 2002, so seeing 28, mostly\nfrom the Cheltenham area, is unusual.\"\nThe evidence so far points to the period of risk being more than 3 months\nago. Most of the patients, who are aged between 40 and 70, are said to be\nrecovering well after falling ill earlier in the summer.\nQ, standing for Query, fever, was so called originally because for many\nyears its cause was unknown. It tends to be more common around the lambing\nseason, although it can occur at any time of year.\n\"I appreciate that news of this outbreak will surprise some local people,\"\nsaid Dr Lewis. \"They can be reassured that we're working hard to\ninvestigate it.\"\nAn outbreak of Q fever in Solihull in 1989 led to 147 human cases.\nResearchers have suggested that it was caused by a combination of outdoor\nlambing and calving and particular weather conditions leading to the\ninfective organism being blown several miles to populated areas.\n--\ncommunicated by:\nAndrea Jones\nH Jones and Sons\n<agency@hjones-sons.co.uk>\n[ProMED-mail previously posted regarding the early part of this outbreak [Q\nfever - UK (England): alert, RFI 20070723.2367].\n_Coxiella burnetii_, the causative agent, was discovered in 1937. This\norganism is an agent that can be resistant to heat and desiccation, and is\nhighly infectious by the aerosol route. A single inhaled organism may\nproduce clinical illness. Indeed, in [non-human] primates, the dose to kill\n50 per cent of the primates was found to be 1.7 organisms (1).\nCattle, sheep, and goats are the primary reservoirs of _C. burnetii_.\nInfection has been noted in a wide variety of other animals, including\nother species of livestock and in domesticated pets. _C. burnetii_ does not\nusually cause clinical disease in these animals, although abortion in goats\nand sheep has been linked to _C. burnetii_ infection. Organisms are\nexcreted in milk, urine, and feces of infected animals. Most importantly,\nduring birthing the organisms are shed in high numbers within the amniotic\nfluids and the placenta. Contact with contaminated wool is known to be a\nmode of transmission (2).\nThe organisms can be resistant to heat, drying, and many common\ndisinfectants. These features enable the bacteria to survive for long\nperiods in the environment. This very stable form of _C. burnetii_ is\nassociated with compact small cell variants of the organism that are\nproduced during standard replication along with the less resistant large\ncell form, metabolically dormant, and spore-like (3).\nInfection of humans usually occurs by inhalation of these organisms from\nair that contains airborne barnyard dust contaminated by dried placental\nmaterial, birth fluids, and excreta of infected herd animals. Humans are\noften very susceptible to the disease, and very few organisms may be\nrequired to cause infection.\nIngestion of contaminated milk, followed by regurgitation and inspiration\nof the contaminated food, is a less common mode of transmission. Other\nmodes of transmission to humans, including tick bites and human-to-human\ntransmission, are rare.\n1. Lille RD, Perrin TL, Armstrong C. An institutional outbreak of\npneumonitis. III.

The South Australian\nHealth Department today, 21 Jun 2007, said a small cluster of people\nhad been diagnosed with Q fever in the Riverland town of Waikerie\nsince early April 2007.\nSA Communicable Diseases Control Branch director Ann Koehler said 3\npeople had been diagnosed with the fever with another probable case\nexpected. Ms. Koehler said 4 other people were being tested for the\nbacterial infection, which causes flu-like symptoms including fever,\nchills and sweats, and can be treated with antibiotics.\nPeople become infected by breathing in contaminated dust from\ndroppings of infected animals. Ms. Koehler said people should not be\nconcerned as the 12 cases of the fever diagnosed so far in 2007 was a\nlow number compared with other colds and influenza.\nShe said the Loxton Waikerie Council and the Environmental Protection\nAuthority were working with the abattoir to improve safety.\n--\nContributed by:\nProMED Rapporteur Joseph Dudley\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[Q fever was first described in Australia where this posting\noriginates. It was called \"Query fever\" because the causative agent\nwas initially unknown. _Coxiella burnetii_, the causative agent, was\ndiscovered in 1937. This organism is an agent that can be resistant to\nheat and desiccation and highly infectious by the aerosol route. A\nsingle inhaled organism may produce clinical illness. Indeed, in\n[non-human] primates, the dose to kill 50 percent of the primates was\nfound to be 1.7 organisms (1).\nCattle, sheep, and goats are the primary reservoirs of _C. burnetii_.\nInfection has been noted in a wide variety of other animals,\nincluding other species of livestock and domesticated pets. _C.\nburnetii_ does not usually cause clinical disease in these animals,\nalthough abortion in goats and sheep has been linked to _C. burnetii_\ninfection. Organisms are excreted in milk, urine, and feces of\ninfected animals. Most importantly, during birthing the organisms are\nshed in high numbers within the amniotic fluids and the placenta.\nContact with contaminated wool is known to be a mode of transmission (2).\nThe organisms can be resistant to heat, drying, and many common\ndisinfectants. These features enable the bacteria to survive for long\nperiods in the environment. This very stable form of _C. burnetii_ is\nassociated with compact small-cell variants of the organism that are\nproduced during standard replication (along with the less resistant\nlarge-cell form) and are metabolically dormant and spore-like (3).\nThe Q fever organism is a Category B bioterrorism agent and, in fact,\nalthough not thought to be related to bioterrorism, was spread by\nmail in a post office in the UK in 1987 (4).\nInfection of humans usually occurs by inhalation of these organisms\nfrom air that contains airborne barnyard dust contaminated by dried\nplacental material, birth fluids, and excreta of infected herd\nanimals. Humans are often very susceptible to the disease, and very\nfew organisms may be required to cause infection.\nIngestion of contaminated milk, followed by regurgitation and\ninspiration of the contaminated food, is a less common mode of\ntransmission. Instances of other modes of transmission to humans,\nincluding tick bites and human to human transmission, are rare.\nAn earlier outbreak of infection in 51 persons in Scotland, UK, was\ntied to a meat processing plant and appeared to spread via aerosol\nfor at least 1/2 mile.\n1.

The South Australian\nHealth Department today, 21 Jun 2007, said a small cluster of people\nhad been diagnosed with Q fever in the Riverland town of Waikerie\nsince early April 2007.\nSA Communicable Diseases Control Branch director Ann Koehler said 3\npeople had been diagnosed with the fever with another probable case\nexpected. Ms. Koehler said 4 other people were being tested for the\nbacterial infection, which causes flu-like symptoms including fever,\nchills and sweats, and can be treated with antibiotics.\nPeople become infected by breathing in contaminated dust from\ndroppings of infected animals. Ms. Koehler said people should not be\nconcerned as the 12 cases of the fever diagnosed so far in 2007 was a\nlow number compared with other colds and influenza.\nShe said the Loxton Waikerie Council and the Environmental Protection\nAuthority were working with the abattoir to improve safety.\n--\nContributed by:\nProMED Rapporteur Joseph Dudley\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[Q fever was first described in Australia where this posting\noriginates. It was called \"Query fever\" because the causative agent\nwas initially unknown. _Coxiella burnetii_, the causative agent, was\ndiscovered in 1937. This organism is an agent that can be resistant to\nheat and desiccation and highly infectious by the aerosol route. A\nsingle inhaled organism may produce clinical illness. Indeed, in\n[non-human] primates, the dose to kill 50 percent of the primates was\nfound to be 1.7 organisms (1).\nCattle, sheep, and goats are the primary reservoirs of _C. burnetii_.\nInfection has been noted in a wide variety of other animals,\nincluding other species of livestock and domesticated pets. _C.\nburnetii_ does not usually cause clinical disease in these animals,\nalthough abortion in goats and sheep has been linked to _C. burnetii_\ninfection. Organisms are excreted in milk, urine, and feces of\ninfected animals. Most importantly, during birthing the organisms are\nshed in high numbers within the amniotic fluids and the placenta.\nContact with contaminated wool is known to be a mode of transmission (2).\nThe organisms can be resistant to heat, drying, and many common\ndisinfectants. These features enable the bacteria to survive for long\nperiods in the environment. This very stable form of _C. burnetii_ is\nassociated with compact small-cell variants of the organism that are\nproduced during standard replication (along with the less resistant\nlarge-cell form) and are metabolically dormant and spore-like (3).\nThe Q fever organism is a Category B bioterrorism agent and, in fact,\nalthough not thought to be related to bioterrorism, was spread by\nmail in a post office in the UK in 1987 (4).\nInfection of humans usually occurs by inhalation of these organisms\nfrom air that contains airborne barnyard dust contaminated by dried\nplacental material, birth fluids, and excreta of infected herd\nanimals. Humans are often very susceptible to the disease, and very\nfew organisms may be required to cause infection.\nIngestion of contaminated milk, followed by regurgitation and\ninspiration of the contaminated food, is a less common mode of\ntransmission. Instances of other modes of transmission to humans,\nincluding tick bites and human to human transmission, are rare.\nAn earlier outbreak of infection in 51 persons in Scotland, UK, was\ntied to a meat processing plant and appeared to spread via aerosol\nfor at least 1/2 mile.\n1.

In 1999, Q fever became a notifiable\ndisease in the USA, but reporting is not required in many other countries.\nBecause the disease is underreported, scientists cannot reliably assess how\nmany cases of Q fever have actually occurred worldwide.

Other modes of\ntransmission to humans, including tick bites and human-to-human transmission,\nare rare.\nOnly about one-half of all people infected with _C. burnetii_ show signs of\nclinical illness. Most acute cases of Q fever begin with sudden onset of one\nor more of the following: high fevers (up to 104-105 degrees F), severe\nheadache, general malaise, myalgia, confusion, sore throat, chills, sweats,\nnon-productive cough, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and chest\npain. Fever usually lasts for 1 to 2 weeks. Weight loss can occur and persist\nfor some time. 30 to 50 percent of patients with a symptomatic infection will\ndevelop pneumonia. Additionally, a majority of patients have abnormal results\non liver function tests and some will develop hepatitis. In general, most\npatients will recover to good health within several months without any\ntreatment. Only 1-2 percent of people with acute Q fever die of the disease.\nChronic Q fever, characterized by infection that persists for more than 6\nmonths, is uncommon but is a much more serious disease. Patients who have had\nacute Q fever may develop the chronic form as soon as 1 year or as long as 20\nyears after initial infection. A serious complication of chronic Q fever is\nendocarditis, generally involving the aortic heart valves, less commonly the\nmitral valve. Most patients who develop chronic Q fever have pre-existing\nvalvular heart disease or have a history of vascular graft. Transplant\nrecipients, patients with cancer, and those with chronic kidney disease are\nalso at risk of developing chronic Q fever. As many as 65 percent of persons\nwith chronic Q fever may die of the disease.\ufffd\nDoxycycline is the treatment of choice for acute Q fever. Antibiotic treatment\nis most effective when initiated within the first 3 days of illness. A dose of\n100 mg of doxycycline taken orally twice daily for 15-21 days is a frequently\nprescribed therapy. Quinolone antibiotics have demonstrated good in vitro\nactivity against _C. burnetii_ and may be considered by the physician. Therapy\nshould be started again if the disease relapses. Chronic Q fever endocarditis\nis much more difficult to treat effectively and often requires the use of\nmultiple drugs.\nSince _Coxiella burnetii_ is a highly infectious agent that is rather\nresistant to heat and drying, it is considered relevant in bioterrorism. It\ncan become airborne and inhaled by humans. A single _C. burnetii_ organism may\ncause disease in a susceptible person. This agent could be developed for use\nin biological warfare and is considered a potential terrorist threat. - Mod.LL]\nSee Also\nQ fever, human - USA (TX) 20050701.1861\n2001\n----\nQ fever goat, suspected human - USA Wyoming (02) 20010205.0234\nQ fever goat, suspected human - USA (Wyoming) 20010201.0221\n1996\n----\nQ fever - San Mateo County (USA) (2) 19960922.1617\nQ Fever - San Mateo County (USA): RFI 19960920.1609\n........................ll/pg/jw\n*##########################################################*\n************************************************************\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.

In 1999, Q fever became a notifiable\ndisease in the USA, but reporting is not required in many other countries.\nBecause the disease is underreported, scientists cannot reliably assess how\nmany cases of Q fever have actually occurred worldwide. Many human infections\nare inapparent.\nCattle, sheep, and goats are the primary reservoirs of _C. burnetii_.\nInfection has been noted in a wide variety of other animals, including other\nspecies of livestock and in domesticated pets. _C. burnetii_ does not usually\ncause clinical disease in these animals, although abortion in goats and sheep\nhas been linked to infection. Organisms are excreted in milk, urine, and\nfeces of infected animals. Most importantly, during birthing the organisms are\nshed in high numbers in the amniotic fluids and the placenta. The organisms\nare resistant to heat, drying, and many common disinfectants. These features\nenable the bacteria to survive for long periods in the environment. Infection\nof humans usually occurs by inhalation of these organisms from air that\ncontains airborne barnyard dust contaminated by dried placental material,\nbirth fluids, and excreta of infected herd animals. Humans are often very\nsusceptible to the disease, and only very few organisms may be required to\ncause infection.\nIngestion of contaminated milk, followed by regurgitation and inspiration of\nthe contaminated food, is a less common mode of transmission. Other modes of\ntransmission to humans, including tick bites and human-to-human transmission,\nare rare.\nOnly about one-half of all people infected with _C. burnetii_ show signs of\nclinical illness. Most acute cases of Q fever begin with sudden onset of one\nor more of the following: high fevers (up to 104-105 degrees F), severe\nheadache, general malaise, myalgia, confusion, sore throat, chills, sweats,\nnon-productive cough, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and chest\npain. Fever usually lasts for 1 to 2 weeks. Weight loss can occur and persist\nfor some time. 30 to 50 percent of patients with a symptomatic infection will\ndevelop pneumonia. Additionally, a majority of patients have abnormal results\non liver function tests and some will develop hepatitis. In general, most\npatients will recover to good health within several months without any\ntreatment. Only 1-2 percent of people with acute Q fever die of the disease.\nChronic Q fever, characterized by infection that persists for more than 6\nmonths, is uncommon but is a much more serious disease. Patients who have had\nacute Q fever may develop the chronic form as soon as 1 year or as long as 20\nyears after initial infection. A serious complication of chronic Q fever is\nendocarditis, generally involving the aortic heart valves, less commonly the\nmitral valve. Most patients who develop chronic Q fever have pre-existing\nvalvular heart disease or have a history of vascular graft. Transplant\nrecipients, patients with cancer, and those with chronic kidney disease are\nalso at risk of developing chronic Q fever. As many as 65 percent of persons\nwith chronic Q fever may die of the disease.\ufffd\nDoxycycline is the treatment of choice for acute Q fever.

In 1999, Q fever became a notifiable\ndisease in the USA, but reporting is not required in many other countries.\nBecause the disease is underreported, scientists cannot reliably assess how\nmany cases of Q fever have actually occurred worldwide. Many human infections\nare inapparent.\nCattle, sheep, and goats are the primary reservoirs of _C. burnetii_.\nInfection has been noted in a wide variety of other animals, including other\nspecies of livestock and in domesticated pets. _C. burnetii_ does not usually\ncause clinical disease in these animals, although abortion in goats and sheep\nhas been linked to infection. Organisms are excreted in milk, urine, and\nfeces of infected animals. Most importantly, during birthing the organisms are\nshed in high numbers in the amniotic fluids and the placenta. The organisms\nare resistant to heat, drying, and many common disinfectants. These features\nenable the bacteria to survive for long periods in the environment. Infection\nof humans usually occurs by inhalation of these organisms from air that\ncontains airborne barnyard dust contaminated by dried placental material,\nbirth fluids, and excreta of infected herd animals. Humans are often very\nsusceptible to the disease, and only very few organisms may be required to\ncause infection.\nIngestion of contaminated milk, followed by regurgitation and inspiration of\nthe contaminated food, is a less common mode of transmission. Other modes of\ntransmission to humans, including tick bites and human-to-human transmission,\nare rare.\nOnly about one-half of all people infected with _C. burnetii_ show signs of\nclinical illness. Most acute cases of Q fever begin with sudden onset of one\nor more of the following: high fevers (up to 104-105 degrees F), severe\nheadache, general malaise, myalgia, confusion, sore throat, chills, sweats,\nnon-productive cough, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and chest\npain. Fever usually lasts for 1 to 2 weeks. Weight loss can occur and persist\nfor some time. 30 to 50 percent of patients with a symptomatic infection will\ndevelop pneumonia. Additionally, a majority of patients have abnormal results\non liver function tests and some will develop hepatitis. In general, most\npatients will recover to good health within several months without any\ntreatment. Only 1-2 percent of people with acute Q fever die of the disease.\nChronic Q fever, characterized by infection that persists for more than 6\nmonths, is uncommon but is a much more serious disease. Patients who have had\nacute Q fever may develop the chronic form as soon as 1 year or as long as 20\nyears after initial infection. A serious complication of chronic Q fever is\nendocarditis, generally involving the aortic heart valves, less commonly the\nmitral valve. Most patients who develop chronic Q fever have pre-existing\nvalvular heart disease or have a history of vascular graft. Transplant\nrecipients, patients with cancer, and those with chronic kidney disease are\nalso at risk of developing chronic Q fever. As many as 65 percent of persons\nwith chronic Q fever may die of the disease.\ufffd\nDoxycycline is the treatment of choice for acute Q fever. Antibiotic treatment\nis most effective when initiated within the first 3 days of illness. A dose of\n100 mg of doxycycline taken orally twice daily for 15-21 days is a frequently\nprescribed therapy.

Berger, M.D. <mberger@post.tau.ac.il>\nSource: GIDEON <http://www.GideonOnline.com>\n\nThe following background data on Q-fever in Germany and details of\nthe human vaccine [an additional option in high-risk situations] are\nextracted from GIDEON.\nQ-fever was first recognized in Germany in 1947. Reporting was\ninstituted in West Germany in 1962, and in East Germany in 1979. The\n2 systems were combined in 1991. Most cases are reported in Bavaria,\nBaden-Wurttemberg, Rhineland-Palatinate, Hesse, Northrhine-\nWestphalia, and Thuringia. Hesse has experienced the greatest increase\nin incidence since 1990.\nYear/Cases/Rate per 100 000\n1964 /437\n1965 /28/0.05\n1970 /29\n1975/54\n1976/27\n1977/69\n1978/100\n1979/39\n1980/41/0.1\n1983/181\n1984/54\n1985/62\n1986/23\n1987/23\n1988/40\n1989/56\n1990/71/0.1\n1998/150/0.183\n1999/276/0.336\n2000/206/0.251\n2001/294\n22 percent of blood donors (nationwide, 1983 to 1986) and 22 percent\nof military personnel (1985 to 1987) are seropositive.\n12 percent of cattle in the southern Bavarian foothills are seropositive.\nThe average number of reported herds infected with Q fever was 71\nper year during 1971 to 1979; 328 during 1980 to 1989; 303 during 1990\nto 1998.\nOutbreaks currently peak during spring to summer, and may be related\nto urbanization.\n40 outbreaks were reported during 1947 to 1999. Sheep were\nimplicated in 24 of the outbreaks, and cattle in 6.\n2 laboratory outbreaks (in 1947 and 1948) were reported during 1947 to\n1999.\nAn epidemic occurred in Berlin during 1992, involving 80 cases,\nmostly staff from a veterinary institute. An outbreak in Hessen during\n1993 involved 121 cases.\nIn 1996, 60 cases were confirmed in the Rollshausen area (Lohra,\nHessen) during an outbreak associated with infected sheep.\nA University outbreak in May 1997 (105 confirmed cases) was\nassociated with proximity to sheep.\nAn outbreak in Dortmund during 1999 (81 cases) was associated with\nproximity to sheep.\nAn outbreak (68 clinical cases) was reported during December 2000 to\nJune 2001 in Hochsauerland and Nordhessen.\nRegarding the [human] vaccine: Q-fever vaccine is produced from\ninactivated phase I whole _Coxiella burnetii_ under the proprietary\nname Q-vax. The typical adult dosage consists of 0.5 ml s.c. (deltoid\nregion) for high-risk populations (e.g., occupational exposure).\nCurrently use is limited to Australia, notably among abattoir workers.\nProtection persists for at least 5 years, and there are no clear guidelines\nconcerning boosters. Potential side effects include fever and headache;\nthe only contraindication is known allergy to the vaccine itself.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[We are very grateful to Dr Berger for the epidemiological data. Some\nof the statements -- e.g. the alleged linkage between urbanization and\nthe observed Q fever peaks during spring to summer -- might need\nclarification (rural vacations of city dwellers?). More information on\nanimal vaccines, as requested in the RFI, will be helpful. - Mod.AS]\nSee Also\nQ fever, human, sheep, vaccine - Germany: RFI 20020626.4607\n...............................as/pg/jw\n*##########################################################*\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.

There are a number of other\nfacilities in this country and Canada at which this vaccine is utilized, in\naccordance with an investigational protocol.\nBecause this vaccine has, in the past, caused severe local reactions in\nindividuals already immune to _Coxiella burnetii_, a screening intradermal\nskin test with Q fever antigen is required prior to vaccination. The purpose\nof the skin test is to identify those individuals at risk of developing\nsevere local reactions to the vaccine, and individuals with a positive skin\ntest should not be vaccinated. A similar problem exists with the Australian\nvaccine, and a screening skin test is also required prior to use of that\nproduct. In addition, it should be noted that individuals with positive skin\ntest reactions to this Q fever antigen do not need vaccination, because the\npositive skin test reflects pre-existing protective immunity to Q fever.\nAs an investigational product, IND 610 is subject to applicable FDA\nregulations and policies. It can be administered only according to an\napproved investigational protocol under the supervision of the principal or\nan associate investigator, but it is not being \"held in reserve\".
