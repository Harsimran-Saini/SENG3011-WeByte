Neil M. Ampel, MD reviewing Costantini VP et al. Clin Infect Dis 2016 Jan 1; http://www.jwatch.org/na40028/2016/01/05/prolonged-shedding-norovirus-after-infection [subscription to Journal Watch required]\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNoroviruses, the leading cause of severe gastroenteritis worldwide, have 6 genogroups and 38 genotypes; strain GII.4 is most frequently associated with outbreaks (NEJM JW Infect Dis Mar 2013 and MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep 2013; 62:55).\n\nHisto-blood group antigens (HBGAs) may act as attachment factors for norovirus: People with a functional FUT2 gene (secretors) express HBGAs on mucosal epithelium; nonsecretors, who have a FUT2 mutation of guanine-to-adenine at codon 428, are presumed to be protected from norovirus infection.\n\nThe Oregon Department of Public Health and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have analyzed 10 selected norovirus outbreaks (9 related to strain GII.4) from November 2009 through January 2013. They studied 62 cases, 34 exposed controls, and 18 nonexposed controls. Illness duration was significantly longer in people age 70 or older than in younger patients. Norovirus was detected in stool in 42 cases (68 percent). Shedding of norovirus in stool, which occurred for at least 21 days in 16 of 35 cases (47 percent), was significantly more likely if the initial stool sample had over 1010 copies of virus per gram than if it had fewer copies per gram. For GII.4 viruses, the researchers found no association between secretor status or blood type and symptomatic infection.\n\n[Byline: Doug Powell]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail and Healthmap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Noroviruses are highly contagious. A person with norovirus infection can shed billions of norovirus particles, but it only takes as few as 18 viral particles to infect another person.\n\nPrimarily, noroviruses are spread through\n- close personal contact with an infected person, or\n- the fecal-oral route when a person consumes contaminated food or water.\n\nThe virus can also spread through touching contaminated surfaces, objects, or substances.\n\nIt is possible for norovirus to spread through aerosolized vomit that lands on surfaces or enters a person's mouth, which then he or she swallows. There is no evidence showing that people can become infected by breathing in the virus (excerpted from http://www.cdc.gov/norovirus/hcp/clinical-overview.html).\n\nNoroviruses are responsible for more than 90 percent of viral gastroenteritis and about 50 percent of all-cause gastroenteral outbreaks worldwide. In the post above, illness duration was found to be significantly longer in people aged 70 or older, likely a consequence of diminishment of immune response in older individuals.\n\nIn another review of norovirus shedding (Milbrath MO, Spicknall IH, Zelner JL, et al. 2013. Heterogeneity in norovirus shedding duration affects community risk. Epid and Infec 141(8):1572-1584; http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=8953234&fileId=S0950268813000496), viral shedding was divided into regular shedding (mean 14-16 days) and long shedding (mean 105-136 days). The impact of the latter on the epidemiology of the virus was found to increase the outbreak potential (measured by the reproductive number) by 50-80 percent, the probability of an outbreak by 33 percent, the severity of transmission (measured by the attack rate) by 20 percent, and transmission duration by 100 percent. - Mod.LK]\nSee Also\n2015\n----\nNorovirus update (03): USA (MN, CA) new strain (MN), RFI 20151228.3896625\nNorovirus - middle & high income countries: elderly, retrospective studies 20151019.3724752\nNorovirus update (02): Italy, novel Kawasaki strain 20150904.3622339\nGastroenteritis - Macedonia: Dutch-holidaymakers, norovirus susp. 20150819.3589707\nGastroenteritis - USA (PA) Cowans Gap, norovirus 20150729.3545782\nNorovirus update (01) 20150724.3534291\nNorovirus - China: (GD) 20150409.3287755\n2012\n----\nNorovirus, oysters - USA (04): (LA) 20120512.1131262\nNorovirus, oysters - USA (03): (LA) RFI 20120511.1130121\nNorovirus, oysters - USA (02): (LA) RFI 20120510.1129127\n2010\n----\nNorovirus, oysters - USA (02): (LA) 20100416.1238\nNorovirus, oysters - USA: (LA) 20100407.1113\nNorovirus, oysters - Europe: (UK, Norway, France, Sweden, Denmark) 20100325.0954\n2009\n----\nNorovirus, raw oysters - USA: recall, alert 20091207.4169\n2008\n----\nNorovirus, oysters - New Zealand: (North Island) 20081013.3242\n2007\n----\nNorovirus, oysters - USA (TX): recall 20070304.0754\n2006\n----\nNorovirus, oysters - USA (OR) ex Korea 20061213.3503\nNorovirus, oysters - New Zealand ex Korea 20060714.1947\n.................................................sb/lk/msp/ml", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "norovirus infection"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2016-01-10 00:00:00", "2016-01-01 00:00:00", "2013-03-16 00:00:00", "2009-11-16 00:00:00", "2013-01-16 00:00:00", "1010-03-16 00:00:00", "2013-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2021-03-03 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2010-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "2009-03-16 00:00:00", "2007-03-16 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "New Zealand", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "LA", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Korea", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Sweden", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "MD", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Norway", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "UK", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Kawasaki", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Denmark", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "http://www.cdc.gov/norovirus/hcp/clinical-overview.html", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Italy", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "France", "country": "unknown"}]}]}]}
