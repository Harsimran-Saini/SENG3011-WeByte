He also said the ministry will urge women who want to get pregnant to undergo a rubella antibody test.\n\nIn a 2012-2013 rubella epidemic in Japan, which saw more than 16 000 rubella patients, 45 babies developed congenital rubella syndrome and 11 of them died.\n\nKayo Kani, a 64-year-old co-head of a group working to stop rubella infections, warned that the latest epidemic could also result in the birth of babies with the syndrome, although no cases have been reported so far this year [2018].\n\n17 years ago, Kani lost her daughter who was born with heart problems due to the syndrome. Having learned that women of her daughter's generation are now at risk of giving birth to children with similar problems, Kani said, \"I feel like my daughter is telling me to eliminate rubella infections.\"\n\nTo prevent serious health repercussions arising from the contagious disease, which is often transmitted through coughing and sneezing, vaccinating people around pregnant women is important, according to the institute.\n\nWomen who are already pregnant cannot be inoculated as the vaccine itself is feared to have an impact on the child. Notable rubella symptoms are fever, sore throat, and a rash. Its incubation period is 2-3 weeks.\n\nMany patients found this year [2018] have been men in their 30s to 50s, a group who has not been vaccinated sufficiently.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Kunihiko Iizuka\n\n[The cumulative incidence this year (2018) is highest in Chiba prefecture (37.6 cases per million population), followed by Tokyo (32 cases per million population), and Kanagawa prefecture (17.9 cases per million population).\n\nIn the past 6 weeks, 914 cases were reported, making up most of the 1289 cases recorded this year as of last Wed 18 Oct 2018.

Pregnant women who are not protected against rubella through either vaccination or previous rubella infection should not travel to Japan during this outbreak.\n\nWhat is the current situation?\nHealth officials in Japan have reported an outbreak of rubella. Most cases continue to be reported in the Kanto region (Tokyo, Kanagawa, Chiba, and Saitama).\n\nWhat can travelers do to protect themselves?\n- Make sure you are fully vaccinated or otherwise protected against rubella.*\n- People who cannot show that they were vaccinated or are otherwise protected against rubella should get vaccinated before leaving the United States:\n- Infants (6-11 months of age) should have 1 dose of MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella) vaccine. Children in the United States routinely receive MMR vaccination at age 12-15 months.\n- Adults and children 1 year of age or older should have 2 doses of MMR vaccine separated by at least 28 days.\n- Avoid contact with people who are sick.\n*Those who are otherwise protected include people who were born before 1957 and those who have been tested and have confirmed immunity. Talk to a doctor to see if you are protected against rubella.\n\nSpecial advice for pregnant women\nWhen rubella infection occurs during early pregnancy, serious consequences -- such as miscarriages, stillbirths, and severe birth defects in infants, congenital rubella syndrome, CRS [https://www.cdc.gov/rubella/pregnancy.html] -- can result. See more about pregnancy and rubella at https://www.cdc.gov/rubella/pregnancy.html.\n\nPregnant women should\n- talk with their healthcare providers before traveling to Japan to check whether they are protected against rubella and whether it is advisable to travel;\n- avoid traveling to Japan during this outbreak if not protected against rubella, through either vaccination or previous rubella infection. This is especially important during the 1st 20 weeks of pregnancy;\n- get MMR vaccine after they have given birth, if they are not already protected against rubella.\n\nLearn more about preventing rubella and what to do if you think you have it on the rubella page for travelers [https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/diseases/rubella.\n\nWhat can clinicians do?\n- Check that your patients 6 months of age or older who will be traveling internationally are protected against rubella.\n- Think Travel: keep rubella in mind when treating patients with fever and rash, especially if the patient has recently traveled internationally.\n\nTraveler information\n- Rubella webpage for travelers: https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/diseases/rubella\n- CDC rubella homepage: https://www.cdc.gov/rubella/index.html\n- MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine information statement: https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/vis/vis-statements/mmr.html\n- MMRV (measles, mumps, rubella, varicella) vaccine information statement: https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/vis/vis-statements/mmrv.html\n\nClinician information\n- Rubella in CDC's Yellow Book (Health Information for International Travel): https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2018/infectious-diseases-related-to-travel/rubella\n- Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) Recommendations for MMR vaccine (http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip-recs/vacc-specific/mmr.html) and MMRV vaccine (http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip-recs/vacc-specific/mmrv.html)\n- Rubella information for healthcare professionals\n- Think Travel homepage https://www.cdc.gov/thinktravel/\n\nWhat is rubella?\nRubella, also called German measles, is a disease spread by the coughs and sneezes of infected people.

Since the case had not recently traveled overseas, Taiwan CDC determined the case to be an indigenous case. The possible source of infection is still being investigated.\n\nTo prevent further transmission of the disease, the health authorities has implemented a number of prevention measures and identified 121 contacts, including his family members, colleagues, and healthcare personnel and patients that he came in contact with when he sought medical attention, to monitor and follow up until [18 Feb 2015]. Currently, besides the case's wife who developed cough, none of the other contacts has developed any suspected symptoms. In addition, rubella infection has been eliminated from the case's wife.\n\nIn 2014, Taiwan reported 7 rubella cases, 6 of which were imported. Rubella infection in people is typically mild. However, in pregnant women, rubella can cause death or birth defects such as cataracts, deafness, glaucoma, and heart, lung and brain abnormalities in an unborn baby (fetus) during the 1st few months of pregnancy. Rubella is a highly contagious disease.\n\nPeople who are infected with rubella are infectious from 1 week before to at least 4 days after the rash appears. It is transmitted through airborne droplets or close contact with the patient, but it is vaccine-preventable.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[\"Rubella is an acute, contagious viral infection. While the illness is generally mild in children, it has serious consequences in pregnant women, causing fetal death or congenital defects known as congenital rubella syndrome (CRS). The rubella virus is transmitted by airborne droplets when infected people sneeze or cough. Humans are the only known host. In children, the disease is usually mild, with symptoms including a rash, low fever (under 39 deg C [102.2 deg F]), nausea, and mild conjunctivitis. The rash, which occurs in 50-80 per cent of cases, usually starts on the face and neck before progressing down the body and lasts 1-3 days. Swollen lymph glands behind the ears and in the neck are the most characteristic clinical feature. Infected adults, more commonly women, may develop arthritis and painful joints that usually last from 3-10 days. Once a person is infected, the virus spreads throughout the body in about 5-7 days. Symptoms usually appear 2-3 weeks after exposure. The most infectious period is usually 1-5 days after the appearance of the rash.\n\n\"When a woman is infected with the rubella virus early in pregnancy, she has a 90 per cent chance of passing the virus on to her fetus. This can cause miscarriage, stillbirth or severe birth defects known as CRS. Infants with CRS may excrete the virus for a year or more. Children with CRS can suffer hearing impairments, eye, and heart defects and other lifelong disabilities, including autism, diabetes mellitus, and thyroid dysfunction, many of which require costly therapy, surgeries, and other expensive care.\n\n\"The rubella vaccine is a live [naturally] attenuated strain that has been in use for more than 40 years. A single dose gives more than 95 per cent long-lasting immunity, which is similar to that induced by natural infection.\" (http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs367/en/).\n\n[The] rubella vaccine is administered as part of the triple MMR [measles, mumps, and rubella] vaccine.

Currently, besides the case's wife who developed cough, none of the other contacts has developed any suspected symptoms. In addition, rubella infection has been eliminated from the case's wife.\n\nIn 2014, Taiwan reported 7 rubella cases, 6 of which were imported. Rubella infection in people is typically mild.

While the illness is generally mild in children, it has serious consequences in pregnant women, causing fetal death or congenital defects known as congenital rubella syndrome (CRS). The rubella virus is transmitted by airborne droplets when infected people sneeze or cough. Humans are the only known host. In children, the disease is usually mild, with symptoms including a rash, low fever (under 39 deg C [102.2 deg F]), nausea, and mild conjunctivitis. The rash, which occurs in 50-80 per cent of cases, usually starts on the face and neck before progressing down the body and lasts 1-3 days. Swollen lymph glands behind the ears and in the neck are the most characteristic clinical feature. Infected adults, more commonly women, may develop arthritis and painful joints that usually last from 3-10 days. Once a person is infected, the virus spreads throughout the body in about 5-7 days. Symptoms usually appear 2-3 weeks after exposure. The most infectious period is usually 1-5 days after the appearance of the rash.\n\n\"When a woman is infected with the rubella virus early in pregnancy, she has a 90 per cent chance of passing the virus on to her fetus.

Since the case had not recently traveled overseas, Taiwan CDC determined the case to be an indigenous case. The possible source of infection is still being investigated.\n\nTo prevent further transmission of the disease, the health authorities has implemented a number of prevention measures and identified 121 contacts, including his family members, colleagues, and healthcare personnel and patients that he came in contact with when he sought medical attention, to monitor and follow up until [18 Feb 2015]. Currently, besides the case's wife who developed cough, none of the other contacts has developed any suspected symptoms. In addition, rubella infection has been eliminated from the case's wife.\n\nIn 2014, Taiwan reported 7 rubella cases, 6 of which were imported. Rubella infection in people is typically mild. However, in pregnant women, rubella can cause death or birth defects such as cataracts, deafness, glaucoma, and heart, lung and brain abnormalities in an unborn baby (fetus) during the 1st few months of pregnancy. Rubella is a highly contagious disease.\n\nPeople who are infected with rubella are infectious from 1 week before to at least 4 days after the rash appears. It is transmitted through airborne droplets or close contact with the patient, but it is vaccine-preventable.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[\"Rubella is an acute, contagious viral infection. While the illness is generally mild in children, it has serious consequences in pregnant women, causing fetal death or congenital defects known as congenital rubella syndrome (CRS). The rubella virus is transmitted by airborne droplets when infected people sneeze or cough. Humans are the only known host. In children, the disease is usually mild, with symptoms including a rash, low fever (under 39 deg C [102.2 deg F]), nausea, and mild conjunctivitis. The rash, which occurs in 50-80 per cent of cases, usually starts on the face and neck before progressing down the body and lasts 1-3 days. Swollen lymph glands behind the ears and in the neck are the most characteristic clinical feature. Infected adults, more commonly women, may develop arthritis and painful joints that usually last from 3-10 days. Once a person is infected, the virus spreads throughout the body in about 5-7 days. Symptoms usually appear 2-3 weeks after exposure. The most infectious period is usually 1-5 days after the appearance of the rash.\n\n\"When a woman is infected with the rubella virus early in pregnancy, she has a 90 per cent chance of passing the virus on to her fetus. This can cause miscarriage, stillbirth or severe birth defects known as CRS. Infants with CRS may excrete the virus for a year or more. Children with CRS can suffer hearing impairments, eye, and heart defects and other lifelong disabilities, including autism, diabetes mellitus, and thyroid dysfunction, many of which require costly therapy, surgeries, and other expensive care.\n\n\"The rubella vaccine is a live [naturally] attenuated strain that has been in use for more than 40 years.

Symptoms are often mild, and up to 50 percent of infections may\nbe subclinical or unapparent. In children, rash is usually the 1st\nmanifestation, and a prodrome is rare. In older children and adults,\nthere is often a 1-5 day prodrome with low-grade fever, malaise,\nlymphadenopathy, and upper respiratory symptoms preceding the rash.\n\nThe rash of rubella is maculopapular and occurs 14 to 17 days after\nexposure. Arthralgia and arthritis occur frequently in adults and are\nconsidered to be an integral part of the illness rather than a\ncomplication. Other symptoms of rubella include conjunctivitis,\ntestalgia, or orchitis. Infection of the mother by rubella virus\nduring pregnancy can be serious. If the mother is infected within the\n1st 20 weeks of pregnancy, the child may be born with congenital\nrubella syndrome, which entails a range of serious incurable\nillnesses, and spontaneous abortion occurs in up to 20 percent of\ncases.\n\nRubella is spread from person to person via airborne transmission or\ndroplets shed from the respiratory secretions of infected persons.\nRubella may be transmitted by persons with subclinical or asymptomatic\ncases (up to 50 percent of all rubella virus infections).

This\noutbreak is specifically affecting some unvaccinated groups within the\nGereformeerde Gemeente in Nederland (Reformed Community in the Netherlands,\na Christian community).\nUp to Tue 17 May 2005, 214 laboratory confirmed cases of rubella have been\nreported in southwest Ontario. 5 of these cases have been in pregnant\nwomen. The Canadian Christian community where the cases occurred has\nhistorical and social links with the affected groups within the\nGereformeerde Gemeente in Nederland, and individuals frequently travel\nbetween the 2 communities. A definitive source for the Canadian patient\nwith the earliest date of onset reported (mid-February 2005) has not yet\nbeen identified. An isolate has been obtained from the outbreak in Canada\nand is currently being genotyped. Attempts are being made to isolate\nrubella virus in the Netherlands so as to genetically link the respective\noutbreaks. The World Health Organization has recently published a\nstandardised rubella virus genotyping protocol (2).\nIn the Netherlands, up to 17 May 2005, 309 laboratory confirmed cases have\nbeen reported (from 1 Sep 2004); 23 of these are known to be in pregnant\nwomen (9 in their 1st trimester). The geographical spread of the outbreak\nin the Netherlands is documented on the Rijksinstituut voor Volksgezondheid\nen Milieu website: <http://www.rivm.nl/vtv/object_class/atl_infparasit.html>.\nThe epidemiological curve, shown as a figure entitled: \" Reports of\nlaboratory confirmed cases of rubella by week of onset, the Netherlands\n(cases reported between 1 September 2004 - 17 May 2005. Source: Osiris.\")\nin the original document shows 3 separate peaks, each larger than the last.\nIt is uncertain whether these peaks reflect the true incidence or are the\nresult of a registration artefact.\nIn both the Netherlands and Canada, the outbreak occurred in a community\nwith low measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccination coverage and strong\nsocial adherence. The proportion of cases in a vaccinated individual is low\n(0.3 percent and 0.6 percent, respectively), indicating that the\neffectiveness of the rubella component of the MMR vaccine is very high.\nRubella infection acquired during early pregnancy can lead to miscarriage\nor severe birth defects known as congenital rubella syndrome (CRS). This\nsyndrome occurs in up to 90 percent of infants born to mothers who are\ninfected in the 1st trimester (3). It is important to differentiate primary\nrubella infection from re-infection because the risk of CRS for\nre-infection during the first trimester of pregnancy is less than 5 to 10\npercent (2). Rubella IgG avidity serology has been shown to be a very\nuseful laboratory test for differentiating primary rubella infections from\nre-infections/past infections in pregnant women where critical patient\nmanagement/counselling decisions are required (4). Rubella IgG avidity\nserology is being used for the investigation of rubella exposure or\nsuspected rubella in pregnant women in the Canadian outbreak.\nRubella and CRS are preventable by immunisation, and both the Netherlands\nand Canada have a routine 2-dose MMR vaccination schedule. During the\noutbreak, health authorities in Canada and the Netherlands have offered MMR\nfree of charge to unvaccinated individuals (in the Netherlands this has\nonly been offered to those under the age of 18). Public health laws in\nOntario allow authorities to exclude unvaccinated children from attending\nschool when there is an outbreak of a vaccine preventable disease. Local\npublic health officials in Ontario have issued indefinite exclusion orders\nfor students who are not immunised or cannot offer proof of immunity. Such\na law does not exist in the Netherlands. In addition, the provincial\nMinistry of Health for Ontario (Ontario Ministry of Health and Long Term\nCare) has given advice on isolation of cases, quarantining of contacts and\ntravel restrictions. This also differs from the Netherlands, where the\nemphasis of public health advice is on advising pregnant women to avoid\ncontact with rubella patients.\nThe effectiveness of both Canadian and Dutch public health advice in\npreventing spread of rubella and in preventing pregnant women from becoming\ninfected is probably limited. This is firstly because members of the\naffected communities often decline vaccination, since it contradicts their\nreligious beliefs. Comprehensive information on the uptake of MMR during\nthis outbreak is not yet available in Canada or the Netherlands. Secondly,\nrubella is most infectious prior to the onset of rash (usual range one week\nprior to 4 days post rash onset). Finally, only a minority of cases are\ndiagnosed, since rubella virus infection can be asymptomatic in up to 50\npercent of cases and, if symptomatic, usually has a mild course.\nFurther spread of the outbreak and risk of CRS depends on herd immunity\n(resulting from vaccination and natural infection) and level of contact\nwith the affected community. In the Netherlands, historical seroprevalence\nand vaccine uptake data suggest that the level of protection in the general\npopulation is high (5). Even in municipalities where a high proportion of\nthe population declines vaccination, seroprevalence studies suggest\nthat >97 percent of women of childbearing age are immune (probably through\ncirculation of rubella virus in the past) (5). In addition to the groups\nwithin the Gereformeerde Gemeente in Nederland, Dutch groups with a\nrelatively low seroprevalence may include some groups of immigrants and\nthose supporting the anti-vaccination movement (including followers of\nhomeopathy and anthroposophical teachings).\nIn Canada, populations with relatively low seroprevalence may include\nimmigrants as well as other groups who resist immunisation for religious\nand philosophical reasons.\nAlthough Reformed Christian communities exist outside the Netherlands and\nCanada, to our knowledge vaccine preventable diseases have only spread\ninternationally from the Netherlands Gereformeerde Gemeente in the\nNederlands to Canada (6,7,8). Canada's temperate climate, which has\nsynchronous seasons to those of the Netherlands, may be one explanation for\nthis. However, onward spread from Canada has been documented in the past:\nthe poliomyelitis outbreak in the Netherlands in 1978 spread to Canada and\nsubsequently into the United States (9).\nPublic health efforts in the Netherlands and Canada are now focusing on\nraising awareness amongst the affected community and health professionals,\ndocumenting (molecular) epidemiological links, and improving surveillance\nof CRS.\nReferences:\n-----------\n(1) Hahne S, Ward M, Abbink F, Binnendijk R van, Ruijs H, Steenbergen J\nvan, Timen A and Melker H de.

The burden of rubella was increasingly recognized\nin countries as their vaccination programs succeeded in controlling\nmeasles, whose symptoms can resemble rubella. In 1997, a Technical Advisory\nGroup for the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) recommended\nstrategies for rubella control and CRS prevention. In 2003, with the\nsuccess of accelerated rubella control, PAHO member countries voted to\nestablish a goal to eliminate rubella and CRS from the Western Hemisphere\nby 2010. As of 2004, a total of 43 of 44 countries and territories in the\nregion had included rubella vaccine in their routine immunization programs.\nFor countries reporting rubella cases to PAHO, the number of reported\nrubella cases dropped from 135 947 in 1998 to fewer than 1000 cases in 2003.\nWith elimination of endemic chains of rubella transmission in the United\nStates, future patterns of rubella will most likely reflect global disease\nepidemiology. Since 1998, most non-U.S.-born cases of rubella reported in\nthe United States have occurred among persons born in countries where\nrubella vaccination has not been or was only recently implemented.\nAccording to a survey of the member countries in the World Health\nOrganization, the number of countries that have incorporated\nrubella-containing vaccine into their routine national immunization\nprograms increased from 65 (33 percent) in 1996 to 110 (57 percent) in\n2003. However, rubella continues to be endemic in many parts of the world.\nThe United States should continue its vigilance against rubella and CRS by\n1) maintaining high vaccination rates among children; 2) ensuring\nvaccination among women of childbearing age, especially women born outside\nthe United States; 3) continuing surveillance of both rubella and CRS; and\n4) responding rapidly to any outbreak.\"\n- Mod.CP]\nSee Also\nRubella - Canada ex Netherlands (02): Dutch data 20050511.1294\nRubella - Canada ex Netherlands 20050510.1288\n......................cp/pg/mpp\n\n*##########################################################*\n************************************************************\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.

This\nsyndrome occurs in up to 90 percent of infants born to mothers who are\ninfected in the 1st trimester (3). It is important to differentiate primary\nrubella infection from re-infection because the risk of CRS for\nre-infection during the first trimester of pregnancy is less than 5 to 10\npercent (2). Rubella IgG avidity serology has been shown to be a very\nuseful laboratory test for differentiating primary rubella infections from\nre-infections/past infections in pregnant women where critical patient\nmanagement/counselling decisions are required (4). Rubella IgG avidity\nserology is being used for the investigation of rubella exposure or\nsuspected rubella in pregnant women in the Canadian outbreak.\nRubella and CRS are preventable by immunisation, and both the Netherlands\nand Canada have a routine 2-dose MMR vaccination schedule. During the\noutbreak, health authorities in Canada and the Netherlands have offered MMR\nfree of charge to unvaccinated individuals (in the Netherlands this has\nonly been offered to those under the age of 18). Public health laws in\nOntario allow authorities to exclude unvaccinated children from attending\nschool when there is an outbreak of a vaccine preventable disease. Local\npublic health officials in Ontario have issued indefinite exclusion orders\nfor students who are not immunised or cannot offer proof of immunity. Such\na law does not exist in the Netherlands. In addition, the provincial\nMinistry of Health for Ontario (Ontario Ministry of Health and Long Term\nCare) has given advice on isolation of cases, quarantining of contacts and\ntravel restrictions. This also differs from the Netherlands, where the\nemphasis of public health advice is on advising pregnant women to avoid\ncontact with rubella patients.\nThe effectiveness of both Canadian and Dutch public health advice in\npreventing spread of rubella and in preventing pregnant women from becoming\ninfected is probably limited. This is firstly because members of the\naffected communities often decline vaccination, since it contradicts their\nreligious beliefs. Comprehensive information on the uptake of MMR during\nthis outbreak is not yet available in Canada or the Netherlands. Secondly,\nrubella is most infectious prior to the onset of rash (usual range one week\nprior to 4 days post rash onset). Finally, only a minority of cases are\ndiagnosed, since rubella virus infection can be asymptomatic in up to 50\npercent of cases and, if symptomatic, usually has a mild course.\nFurther spread of the outbreak and risk of CRS depends on herd immunity\n(resulting from vaccination and natural infection) and level of contact\nwith the affected community. In the Netherlands, historical seroprevalence\nand vaccine uptake data suggest that the level of protection in the general\npopulation is high (5). Even in municipalities where a high proportion of\nthe population declines vaccination, seroprevalence studies suggest\nthat >97 percent of women of childbearing age are immune (probably through\ncirculation of rubella virus in the past) (5). In addition to the groups\nwithin the Gereformeerde Gemeente in Nederland, Dutch groups with a\nrelatively low seroprevalence may include some groups of immigrants and\nthose supporting the anti-vaccination movement (including followers of\nhomeopathy and anthroposophical teachings).\nIn Canada, populations with relatively low seroprevalence may include\nimmigrants as well as other groups who resist immunisation for religious\nand philosophical reasons.\nAlthough Reformed Christian communities exist outside the Netherlands and\nCanada, to our knowledge vaccine preventable diseases have only spread\ninternationally from the Netherlands Gereformeerde Gemeente in the\nNederlands to Canada (6,7,8). Canada's temperate climate, which has\nsynchronous seasons to those of the Netherlands, may be one explanation for\nthis. However, onward spread from Canada has been documented in the past:\nthe poliomyelitis outbreak in the Netherlands in 1978 spread to Canada and\nsubsequently into the United States (9).\nPublic health efforts in the Netherlands and Canada are now focusing on\nraising awareness amongst the affected community and health professionals,\ndocumenting (molecular) epidemiological links, and improving surveillance\nof CRS.\nReferences:\n-----------\n(1) Hahne S, Ward M, Abbink F, Binnendijk R van, Ruijs H, Steenbergen J\nvan, Timen A and Melker H de.

This\noutbreak is specifically affecting some unvaccinated groups within the\nGereformeerde Gemeente in Nederland (Reformed Community in the Netherlands,\na Christian community).\nUp to Tue 17 May 2005, 214 laboratory confirmed cases of rubella have been\nreported in southwest Ontario. 5 of these cases have been in pregnant\nwomen. The Canadian Christian community where the cases occurred has\nhistorical and social links with the affected groups within the\nGereformeerde Gemeente in Nederland, and individuals frequently travel\nbetween the 2 communities. A definitive source for the Canadian patient\nwith the earliest date of onset reported (mid-February 2005) has not yet\nbeen identified. An isolate has been obtained from the outbreak in Canada\nand is currently being genotyped. Attempts are being made to isolate\nrubella virus in the Netherlands so as to genetically link the respective\noutbreaks. The World Health Organization has recently published a\nstandardised rubella virus genotyping protocol (2).\nIn the Netherlands, up to 17 May 2005, 309 laboratory confirmed cases have\nbeen reported (from 1 Sep 2004); 23 of these are known to be in pregnant\nwomen (9 in their 1st trimester). The geographical spread of the outbreak\nin the Netherlands is documented on the Rijksinstituut voor Volksgezondheid\nen Milieu website: <http://www.rivm.nl/vtv/object_class/atl_infparasit.html>.\nThe epidemiological curve, shown as a figure entitled: \" Reports of\nlaboratory confirmed cases of rubella by week of onset, the Netherlands\n(cases reported between 1 September 2004 - 17 May 2005.

A definitive source for the Canadian patient\nwith the earliest date of onset reported (mid-February 2005) has not yet\nbeen identified. An isolate has been obtained from the outbreak in Canada\nand is currently being genotyped. Attempts are being made to isolate\nrubella virus in the Netherlands so as to genetically link the respective\noutbreaks. The World Health Organization has recently published a\nstandardised rubella virus genotyping protocol (2).\nIn the Netherlands, up to 17 May 2005, 309 laboratory confirmed cases have\nbeen reported (from 1 Sep 2004); 23 of these are known to be in pregnant\nwomen (9 in their 1st trimester). The geographical spread of the outbreak\nin the Netherlands is documented on the Rijksinstituut voor Volksgezondheid\nen Milieu website: <http://www.rivm.nl/vtv/object_class/atl_infparasit.html>.\nThe epidemiological curve, shown as a figure entitled: \" Reports of\nlaboratory confirmed cases of rubella by week of onset, the Netherlands\n(cases reported between 1 September 2004 - 17 May 2005. Source: Osiris.\")\nin the original document shows 3 separate peaks, each larger than the last.\nIt is uncertain whether these peaks reflect the true incidence or are the\nresult of a registration artefact.\nIn both the Netherlands and Canada, the outbreak occurred in a community\nwith low measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccination coverage and strong\nsocial adherence. The proportion of cases in a vaccinated individual is low\n(0.3 percent and 0.6 percent, respectively), indicating that the\neffectiveness of the rubella component of the MMR vaccine is very high.\nRubella infection acquired during early pregnancy can lead to miscarriage\nor severe birth defects known as congenital rubella syndrome (CRS). This\nsyndrome occurs in up to 90 percent of infants born to mothers who are\ninfected in the 1st trimester (3). It is important to differentiate primary\nrubella infection from re-infection because the risk of CRS for\nre-infection during the first trimester of pregnancy is less than 5 to 10\npercent (2). Rubella IgG avidity serology has been shown to be a very\nuseful laboratory test for differentiating primary rubella infections from\nre-infections/past infections in pregnant women where critical patient\nmanagement/counselling decisions are required (4). Rubella IgG avidity\nserology is being used for the investigation of rubella exposure or\nsuspected rubella in pregnant women in the Canadian outbreak.\nRubella and CRS are preventable by immunisation, and both the Netherlands\nand Canada have a routine 2-dose MMR vaccination schedule. During the\noutbreak, health authorities in Canada and the Netherlands have offered MMR\nfree of charge to unvaccinated individuals (in the Netherlands this has\nonly been offered to those under the age of 18). Public health laws in\nOntario allow authorities to exclude unvaccinated children from attending\nschool when there is an outbreak of a vaccine preventable disease. Local\npublic health officials in Ontario have issued indefinite exclusion orders\nfor students who are not immunised or cannot offer proof of immunity. Such\na law does not exist in the Netherlands. In addition, the provincial\nMinistry of Health for Ontario (Ontario Ministry of Health and Long Term\nCare) has given advice on isolation of cases, quarantining of contacts and\ntravel restrictions. This also differs from the Netherlands, where the\nemphasis of public health advice is on advising pregnant women to avoid\ncontact with rubella patients.\nThe effectiveness of both Canadian and Dutch public health advice in\npreventing spread of rubella and in preventing pregnant women from becoming\ninfected is probably limited. This is firstly because members of the\naffected communities often decline vaccination, since it contradicts their\nreligious beliefs. Comprehensive information on the uptake of MMR during\nthis outbreak is not yet available in Canada or the Netherlands. Secondly,\nrubella is most infectious prior to the onset of rash (usual range one week\nprior to 4 days post rash onset). Finally, only a minority of cases are\ndiagnosed, since rubella virus infection can be asymptomatic in up to 50\npercent of cases and, if symptomatic, usually has a mild course.\nFurther spread of the outbreak and risk of CRS depends on herd immunity\n(resulting from vaccination and natural infection) and level of contact\nwith the affected community. In the Netherlands, historical seroprevalence\nand vaccine uptake data suggest that the level of protection in the general\npopulation is high (5). Even in municipalities where a high proportion of\nthe population declines vaccination, seroprevalence studies suggest\nthat >97 percent of women of childbearing age are immune (probably through\ncirculation of rubella virus in the past) (5). In addition to the groups\nwithin the Gereformeerde Gemeente in Nederland, Dutch groups with a\nrelatively low seroprevalence may include some groups of immigrants and\nthose supporting the anti-vaccination movement (including followers of\nhomeopathy and anthroposophical teachings).\nIn Canada, populations with relatively low seroprevalence may include\nimmigrants as well as other groups who resist immunisation for religious\nand philosophical reasons.\nAlthough Reformed Christian communities exist outside the Netherlands and\nCanada, to our knowledge vaccine preventable diseases have only spread\ninternationally from the Netherlands Gereformeerde Gemeente in the\nNederlands to Canada (6,7,8). Canada's temperate climate, which has\nsynchronous seasons to those of the Netherlands, may be one explanation for\nthis. However, onward spread from Canada has been documented in the past:\nthe poliomyelitis outbreak in the Netherlands in 1978 spread to Canada and\nsubsequently into the United States (9).\nPublic health efforts in the Netherlands and Canada are now focusing on\nraising awareness amongst the affected community and health professionals,\ndocumenting (molecular) epidemiological links, and improving surveillance\nof CRS.\nReferences:\n-----------\n(1) Hahne S, Ward M, Abbink F, Binnendijk R van, Ruijs H, Steenbergen J\nvan, Timen A and Melker H de.

This\noutbreak is specifically affecting some unvaccinated groups within the\nGereformeerde Gemeente in Nederland (Reformed Community in the Netherlands,\na Christian community).\nUp to Tue 17 May 2005, 214 laboratory confirmed cases of rubella have been\nreported in southwest Ontario. 5 of these cases have been in pregnant\nwomen. The Canadian Christian community where the cases occurred has\nhistorical and social links with the affected groups within the\nGereformeerde Gemeente in Nederland, and individuals frequently travel\nbetween the 2 communities. A definitive source for the Canadian patient\nwith the earliest date of onset reported (mid-February 2005) has not yet\nbeen identified. An isolate has been obtained from the outbreak in Canada\nand is currently being genotyped. Attempts are being made to isolate\nrubella virus in the Netherlands so as to genetically link the respective\noutbreaks. The World Health Organization has recently published a\nstandardised rubella virus genotyping protocol (2).\nIn the Netherlands, up to 17 May 2005, 309 laboratory confirmed cases have\nbeen reported (from 1 Sep 2004); 23 of these are known to be in pregnant\nwomen (9 in their 1st trimester). The geographical spread of the outbreak\nin the Netherlands is documented on the Rijksinstituut voor Volksgezondheid\nen Milieu website: <http://www.rivm.nl/vtv/object_class/atl_infparasit.html>.\nThe epidemiological curve, shown as a figure entitled: \" Reports of\nlaboratory confirmed cases of rubella by week of onset, the Netherlands\n(cases reported between 1 September 2004 - 17 May 2005. Source: Osiris.\")\nin the original document shows 3 separate peaks, each larger than the last.\nIt is uncertain whether these peaks reflect the true incidence or are the\nresult of a registration artefact.\nIn both the Netherlands and Canada, the outbreak occurred in a community\nwith low measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccination coverage and strong\nsocial adherence. The proportion of cases in a vaccinated individual is low\n(0.3 percent and 0.6 percent, respectively), indicating that the\neffectiveness of the rubella component of the MMR vaccine is very high.\nRubella infection acquired during early pregnancy can lead to miscarriage\nor severe birth defects known as congenital rubella syndrome (CRS). This\nsyndrome occurs in up to 90 percent of infants born to mothers who are\ninfected in the 1st trimester (3). It is important to differentiate primary\nrubella infection from re-infection because the risk of CRS for\nre-infection during the first trimester of pregnancy is less than 5 to 10\npercent (2). Rubella IgG avidity serology has been shown to be a very\nuseful laboratory test for differentiating primary rubella infections from\nre-infections/past infections in pregnant women where critical patient\nmanagement/counselling decisions are required (4). Rubella IgG avidity\nserology is being used for the investigation of rubella exposure or\nsuspected rubella in pregnant women in the Canadian outbreak.\nRubella and CRS are preventable by immunisation, and both the Netherlands\nand Canada have a routine 2-dose MMR vaccination schedule. During the\noutbreak, health authorities in Canada and the Netherlands have offered MMR\nfree of charge to unvaccinated individuals (in the Netherlands this has\nonly been offered to those under the age of 18). Public health laws in\nOntario allow authorities to exclude unvaccinated children from attending\nschool when there is an outbreak of a vaccine preventable disease. Local\npublic health officials in Ontario have issued indefinite exclusion orders\nfor students who are not immunised or cannot offer proof of immunity. Such\na law does not exist in the Netherlands. In addition, the provincial\nMinistry of Health for Ontario (Ontario Ministry of Health and Long Term\nCare) has given advice on isolation of cases, quarantining of contacts and\ntravel restrictions. This also differs from the Netherlands, where the\nemphasis of public health advice is on advising pregnant women to avoid\ncontact with rubella patients.\nThe effectiveness of both Canadian and Dutch public health advice in\npreventing spread of rubella and in preventing pregnant women from becoming\ninfected is probably limited. This is firstly because members of the\naffected communities often decline vaccination, since it contradicts their\nreligious beliefs. Comprehensive information on the uptake of MMR during\nthis outbreak is not yet available in Canada or the Netherlands. Secondly,\nrubella is most infectious prior to the onset of rash (usual range one week\nprior to 4 days post rash onset). Finally, only a minority of cases are\ndiagnosed, since rubella virus infection can be asymptomatic in up to 50\npercent of cases and, if symptomatic, usually has a mild course.\nFurther spread of the outbreak and risk of CRS depends on herd immunity\n(resulting from vaccination and natural infection) and level of contact\nwith the affected community. In the Netherlands, historical seroprevalence\nand vaccine uptake data suggest that the level of protection in the general\npopulation is high (5). Even in municipalities where a high proportion of\nthe population declines vaccination, seroprevalence studies suggest\nthat >97 percent of women of childbearing age are immune (probably through\ncirculation of rubella virus in the past) (5). In addition to the groups\nwithin the Gereformeerde Gemeente in Nederland, Dutch groups with a\nrelatively low seroprevalence may include some groups of immigrants and\nthose supporting the anti-vaccination movement (including followers of\nhomeopathy and anthroposophical teachings).\nIn Canada, populations with relatively low seroprevalence may include\nimmigrants as well as other groups who resist immunisation for religious\nand philosophical reasons.\nAlthough Reformed Christian communities exist outside the Netherlands and\nCanada, to our knowledge vaccine preventable diseases have only spread\ninternationally from the Netherlands Gereformeerde Gemeente in the\nNederlands to Canada (6,7,8). Canada's temperate climate, which has\nsynchronous seasons to those of the Netherlands, may be one explanation for\nthis. However, onward spread from Canada has been documented in the past:\nthe poliomyelitis outbreak in the Netherlands in 1978 spread to Canada and\nsubsequently into the United States (9).\nPublic health efforts in the Netherlands and Canada are now focusing on\nraising awareness amongst the affected community and health professionals,\ndocumenting (molecular) epidemiological links, and improving surveillance\nof CRS.\nReferences:\n-----------\n(1) Hahne S, Ward M, Abbink F, Binnendijk R van, Ruijs H, Steenbergen J\nvan, Timen A and Melker H de.

The burden of rubella was increasingly recognized\nin countries as their vaccination programs succeeded in controlling\nmeasles, whose symptoms can resemble rubella. In 1997, a Technical Advisory\nGroup for the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) recommended\nstrategies for rubella control and CRS prevention. In 2003, with the\nsuccess of accelerated rubella control, PAHO member countries voted to\nestablish a goal to eliminate rubella and CRS from the Western Hemisphere\nby 2010. As of 2004, a total of 43 of 44 countries and territories in the\nregion had included rubella vaccine in their routine immunization programs.\nFor countries reporting rubella cases to PAHO, the number of reported\nrubella cases dropped from 135 947 in 1998 to fewer than 1000 cases in 2003.\nWith elimination of endemic chains of rubella transmission in the United\nStates, future patterns of rubella will most likely reflect global disease\nepidemiology. Since 1998, most non-U.S.-born cases of rubella reported in\nthe United States have occurred among persons born in countries where\nrubella vaccination has not been or was only recently implemented.\nAccording to a survey of the member countries in the World Health\nOrganization, the number of countries that have incorporated\nrubella-containing vaccine into their routine national immunization\nprograms increased from 65 (33 percent) in 1996 to 110 (57 percent) in\n2003. However, rubella continues to be endemic in many parts of the world.\nThe United States should continue its vigilance against rubella and CRS by\n1) maintaining high vaccination rates among children; 2) ensuring\nvaccination among women of childbearing age, especially women born outside\nthe United States; 3) continuing surveillance of both rubella and CRS; and\n4) responding rapidly to any outbreak.\"\n- Mod.CP]\nSee Also\nRubella - Canada ex Netherlands (02): Dutch data 20050511.1294\nRubella - Canada ex Netherlands 20050510.1288\n......................cp/pg/mpp\n\n*##########################################################*\n************************************************************\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.

This\noutbreak is specifically affecting some unvaccinated groups within the\nGereformeerde Gemeente in Nederland (Reformed Community in the Netherlands,\na Christian community).\nUp to Tue 17 May 2005, 214 laboratory confirmed cases of rubella have been\nreported in southwest Ontario. 5 of these cases have been in pregnant\nwomen. The Canadian Christian community where the cases occurred has\nhistorical and social links with the affected groups within the\nGereformeerde Gemeente in Nederland, and individuals frequently travel\nbetween the 2 communities. A definitive source for the Canadian patient\nwith the earliest date of onset reported (mid-February 2005) has not yet\nbeen identified. An isolate has been obtained from the outbreak in Canada\nand is currently being genotyped. Attempts are being made to isolate\nrubella virus in the Netherlands so as to genetically link the respective\noutbreaks. The World Health Organization has recently published a\nstandardised rubella virus genotyping protocol (2).\nIn the Netherlands, up to 17 May 2005, 309 laboratory confirmed cases have\nbeen reported (from 1 Sep 2004); 23 of these are known to be in pregnant\nwomen (9 in their 1st trimester). The geographical spread of the outbreak\nin the Netherlands is documented on the Rijksinstituut voor Volksgezondheid\nen Milieu website: <http://www.rivm.nl/vtv/object_class/atl_infparasit.html>.\nThe epidemiological curve, shown as a figure entitled: \" Reports of\nlaboratory confirmed cases of rubella by week of onset, the Netherlands\n(cases reported between 1 September 2004 - 17 May 2005. Source: Osiris.\")\nin the original document shows 3 separate peaks, each larger than the last.\nIt is uncertain whether these peaks reflect the true incidence or are the\nresult of a registration artefact.\nIn both the Netherlands and Canada, the outbreak occurred in a community\nwith low measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccination coverage and strong\nsocial adherence. The proportion of cases in a vaccinated individual is low\n(0.3 percent and 0.6 percent, respectively), indicating that the\neffectiveness of the rubella component of the MMR vaccine is very high.\nRubella infection acquired during early pregnancy can lead to miscarriage\nor severe birth defects known as congenital rubella syndrome (CRS). This\nsyndrome occurs in up to 90 percent of infants born to mothers who are\ninfected in the 1st trimester (3). It is important to differentiate primary\nrubella infection from re-infection because the risk of CRS for\nre-infection during the first trimester of pregnancy is less than 5 to 10\npercent (2). Rubella IgG avidity serology has been shown to be a very\nuseful laboratory test for differentiating primary rubella infections from\nre-infections/past infections in pregnant women where critical patient\nmanagement/counselling decisions are required (4). Rubella IgG avidity\nserology is being used for the investigation of rubella exposure or\nsuspected rubella in pregnant women in the Canadian outbreak.\nRubella and CRS are preventable by immunisation, and both the Netherlands\nand Canada have a routine 2-dose MMR vaccination schedule. During the\noutbreak, health authorities in Canada and the Netherlands have offered MMR\nfree of charge to unvaccinated individuals (in the Netherlands this has\nonly been offered to those under the age of 18). Public health laws in\nOntario allow authorities to exclude unvaccinated children from attending\nschool when there is an outbreak of a vaccine preventable disease. Local\npublic health officials in Ontario have issued indefinite exclusion orders\nfor students who are not immunised or cannot offer proof of immunity. Such\na law does not exist in the Netherlands. In addition, the provincial\nMinistry of Health for Ontario (Ontario Ministry of Health and Long Term\nCare) has given advice on isolation of cases, quarantining of contacts and\ntravel restrictions. This also differs from the Netherlands, where the\nemphasis of public health advice is on advising pregnant women to avoid\ncontact with rubella patients.\nThe effectiveness of both Canadian and Dutch public health advice in\npreventing spread of rubella and in preventing pregnant women from becoming\ninfected is probably limited. This is firstly because members of the\naffected communities often decline vaccination, since it contradicts their\nreligious beliefs. Comprehensive information on the uptake of MMR during\nthis outbreak is not yet available in Canada or the Netherlands. Secondly,\nrubella is most infectious prior to the onset of rash (usual range one week\nprior to 4 days post rash onset). Finally, only a minority of cases are\ndiagnosed, since rubella virus infection can be asymptomatic in up to 50\npercent of cases and, if symptomatic, usually has a mild course.\nFurther spread of the outbreak and risk of CRS depends on herd immunity\n(resulting from vaccination and natural infection) and level of contact\nwith the affected community. In the Netherlands, historical seroprevalence\nand vaccine uptake data suggest that the level of protection in the general\npopulation is high (5). Even in municipalities where a high proportion of\nthe population declines vaccination, seroprevalence studies suggest\nthat >97 percent of women of childbearing age are immune (probably through\ncirculation of rubella virus in the past) (5). In addition to the groups\nwithin the Gereformeerde Gemeente in Nederland, Dutch groups with a\nrelatively low seroprevalence may include some groups of immigrants and\nthose supporting the anti-vaccination movement (including followers of\nhomeopathy and anthroposophical teachings).\nIn Canada, populations with relatively low seroprevalence may include\nimmigrants as well as other groups who resist immunisation for religious\nand philosophical reasons.\nAlthough Reformed Christian communities exist outside the Netherlands and\nCanada, to our knowledge vaccine preventable diseases have only spread\ninternationally from the Netherlands Gereformeerde Gemeente in the\nNederlands to Canada (6,7,8). Canada's temperate climate, which has\nsynchronous seasons to those of the Netherlands, may be one explanation for\nthis. However, onward spread from Canada has been documented in the past:\nthe poliomyelitis outbreak in the Netherlands in 1978 spread to Canada and\nsubsequently into the United States (9).\nPublic health efforts in the Netherlands and Canada are now focusing on\nraising awareness amongst the affected community and health professionals,\ndocumenting (molecular) epidemiological links, and improving surveillance\nof CRS.\nReferences:\n-----------\n(1) Hahne S, Ward M, Abbink F, Binnendijk R van, Ruijs H, Steenbergen J\nvan, Timen A and Melker H de.
