The cases were reported in children and some adults. One death of a child was reported.\n\nThe Ain Issa camp, about 50 km [31 mi] north of Raqqa, includes about 3000 tents and is inhabited by more than 20 000 displaced people from Raqqa and Deir Al-Zour.\n\nRubella, or German measles, infection in people is typically mild. However, in pregnant women, rubella can cause death or birth defects such as cataracts, deafness, glaucoma, and heart, lung, and brain abnormalities in an unborn baby (fetus) during the 1st few months of pregnancy.\n\nRubella is a highly contagious disease. People who are infected with rubella are infectious from 1 week before to at least 4 days after the rash appears. It is transmitted through airborne droplet or close contact with the patient, but it is vaccine-preventable.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Rubella is generally a mild disease in children; the primary medical danger of rubella is the infection of pregnant women because it can cause congenital rubella syndrome in developing babies. Before a vaccine against rubella became available in 1969, rubella epidemics happened every 6-9 years, usually among children 5-9 years old, along with many cases of congenital rubella. Thanks to immunization, there are far fewer cases of rubella and congenital rubella.\n\nMost rubella infections today appear in young, non-immunized adults rather than in kids. In fact, experts estimate that 10 per cent of young adults are currently susceptible to rubella, which could pose a danger to any children they might have someday.\n\nCongenital rubella syndrome can have potentially devastating consequences for the developing fetus. Children who are infected with rubella before birth are at risk for growth problems, intellectual disability, defects of the heart and eyes, deafness; and liver, spleen, and bone marrow problems (excerpted and edited from http://kidshealth.org/en/parents/german-measles.html).\n\nAccording to the WHO European office, 2.6 million Syrians fled their homes for safer parts of the country last year (2017). That's about 7700 displacements per day \u200a-- \u200aone of the highest rates in the world. In total, after almost 7 years of conflict, more than 6.1 million people have been uprooted inside the country.\n\nWhile rubella cases are not common, displaced Syrians had little access to health care while dislocated, and consequently children were not vaccinated. In partnership with donors like the United Kingdom's Department for International Development (DFID) and the Government of Norway, WHO has been supporting NGOs to provide health assistance in 7 camps in Raqqa and Hassakah governorates. In the last 3 months of 2017, 13 partners provided more than 216 000 medical consultations in camps, informal settlements and host communities across north eastern Syria.\n\nSyria Immunization Group (SIG), a confederation of health organizations coordinated by WHO, has been working to make sure children in war-torn northern Syria don't miss out on vaccinations. Despite airstrikes, sniper fire, and destroyed roads, SIG teams have managed to vaccinate millions of children against polio, measles, and other diseases in the past 2 years. - Mod LK\n\nMaps of Syria: http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/middle_east_and_asia/syria_admin_2007.jpg and http://healthmap.org/promed/p/63814]", "summary": "It is transmitted through airborne droplet or close contact with the patient, but it is vaccine-preventable.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Rubella is generally a mild disease in children; the primary medical danger of rubella is the infection of pregnant women because it can cause congenital rubella syndrome in developing babies.

As of [4 Sep 2019], there have been 2156 Rubella cases reported by the NIID during 2019.\n\nThis is an increase of about 260 rubella cases in Japan since July 2019. On a local basis, the city of Tokyo has reported 37% of Japan's 2019 Rubella cases.\n\nSince Rubella is very dangerous for a pregnant woman and her developing baby, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said on [7 Aug 2019], 'pregnant women who are not protected against rubella through either vaccination or previous rubella infection, should not travel to Japan during this outbreak.'\n\nBut, pregnant women should not get a Rubella vaccination with the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) says the CDC. This is because the MMR vaccine is an attenuated 'live virus' vaccine.\n\nThe CDC says 'pregnant women who are not vaccinated should wait to get [the] MMR vaccine until after they have given birth. And, women of childbearing age should avoid getting pregnant for at least 4 weeks after receiving the MMR vaccine.'\n\nAdditionally, the CDC says 'if a pregnant woman contracts the rubella virus, her baby could have birth defects such as deafness, cataracts, heart defects, mental disabilities, and organ damage.'\n\nAnd, when a rubella infection occurs during early pregnancy, serious consequences, such as miscarriages, stillbirths, and severe birth defects in infants, which are known as Congenital Rubella Syndrome (CRS), [may result].\n\nThis new NIID report indicates there have been 3 CRS cases in Japan during 2019. As a comparison, during 2005-2015 in the USA, only 8 babies with CRS were reported.\n\nMoreover, [fewer] than 10 people in the USA are reported as having rubella each year. Since 2012, all rubella cases had evidence that they were infected when they were living or traveling outside the USA.\n\nTo alert international travelers, the CDC issued a Level 2 Travel Alert regarding Japan's ongoing Rubella virus outbreak in August 2019. This 'Practice Enhanced Precautions' Travel Alert says 'travelers to Japan should make sure they are vaccinated against rubella with the MMR vaccine before visiting Japan.' This CDC Travel Alert is important since approximately 4.5 million US citizens visit Japan annually.\n\nAdditionally, the Public Health Agency of Canada and the UK Foreign Travel Advice recommend 'pregnant women who are not protected against rubella avoid traveling to Japan.'\n\nIn the USA, there are 2 approved rubella vaccines: MMR II-Rubella and ProQuad. Both rubella vaccines are available at most pharmacies. Travelers to Japan can request a rubella vaccine counseling appointment with a local pharmacist.\n\nRubella vaccines, like any medicine, can produce side effects.

Having learned that women of her daughter's generation are now at risk of giving birth to children with similar problems, Kani said, 'I feel like my daughter is telling me to eliminate rubella infections.'\n\nTo prevent serious health repercussions arising from the contagious disease, which is often transmitted through coughing and sneezing, vaccinating people around pregnant women is important, according to the institute.\n\nWomen who are already pregnant cannot be inoculated as the vaccine itself is feared to have an impact on the child. Notable rubella symptoms are fever, sore throat, and a rash.

Most cases continue to be reported in the Kanto region (Tokyo, Kanagawa, Chiba, and Saitama).\n\nWhat can travelers do to protect themselves?\n- Make sure you are fully vaccinated or otherwise protected against rubella.*\n- People who cannot show that they were vaccinated or are otherwise protected against rubella should get vaccinated before leaving the United States:\n- Infants (6-11 months of age) should have 1 dose of MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella) vaccine. Children in the United States routinely receive MMR vaccination at age 12-15 months.\n- Adults and children 1 year of age or older should have 2 doses of MMR vaccine separated by at least 28 days.\n- Avoid contact with people who are sick.\n*Those who are otherwise protected include people who were born before 1957 and those who have been tested and have confirmed immunity. Talk to a doctor to see if you are protected against rubella.\n\nSpecial advice for pregnant women\nWhen rubella infection occurs during early pregnancy, serious consequences -- such as miscarriages, stillbirths, and severe birth defects in infants, congenital rubella syndrome, CRS [https://www.cdc.gov/rubella/pregnancy.html] -- can result. See more about pregnancy and rubella at https://www.cdc.gov/rubella/pregnancy.html.\n\nPregnant women should\n- talk with their healthcare providers before traveling to Japan to check whether they are protected against rubella and whether it is advisable to travel;\n- avoid traveling to Japan during this outbreak if not protected against rubella, through either vaccination or previous rubella infection. This is especially important during the 1st 20 weeks of pregnancy;\n- get MMR vaccine after they have given birth, if they are not already protected against rubella.\n\nLearn more about preventing rubella and what to do if you think you have it on the rubella page for travelers [https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/diseases/rubella.\n\nWhat can clinicians do?\n- Check that your patients 6 months of age or older who will be traveling internationally are protected against rubella.\n- Think Travel: keep rubella in mind when treating patients with fever and rash, especially if the patient has recently traveled internationally.\n\nTraveler information\n- Rubella webpage for travelers: https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/diseases/rubella\n- CDC rubella homepage: https://www.cdc.gov/rubella/index.html\n- MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine information statement: https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/vis/vis-statements/mmr.html\n- MMRV (measles, mumps, rubella, varicella) vaccine information statement: https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/vis/vis-statements/mmrv.html\n\nClinician information\n- Rubella in CDC's Yellow Book (Health Information for International Travel): https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2018/infectious-diseases-related-to-travel/rubella\n- Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) Recommendations for MMR vaccine (http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip-recs/vacc-specific/mmr.html) and MMRV vaccine (http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip-recs/vacc-specific/mmrv.html)\n- Rubella information for healthcare professionals\n- Think Travel homepage https://www.cdc.gov/thinktravel/\n\nWhat is rubella?\nRubella, also called German measles, is a disease spread by the coughs and sneezes of infected people.

The cumulative number of patients reported by 11 Nov this year [2018] is 2032, exceeding 2000 for the 1st time in 5 years since the epidemic in 2013, when more than 14 000 patients came out.\n\nGenerally, it takes about a year and a half to manufacture MR vaccines from scratch in Japan, and the vaccine expires one year after going to the market. According to the current Japanese system, it is difficult for vaccine manufacturers and distributors to keep stocks in large quantities, except for regular vaccinations for children, and there are hundreds of thousands of annually available stocks as voluntary inoculations and emergencies.\n\nSince October 2018, the country has asked manufacturers to add additional MR vaccines intensively to 5 prefectures in Tokyo, Chiba, Kanagawa, Saitama, and Aichi prefectures where rubella is prevalent.\n\nWomen who want to become pregnant and those cohabiting family of pregnant women are preferentially vaccinated in October.\n\nThe supply of MR vaccine and rubella alone vaccine is in short supply since the outbreak of measles in Okinawa Prefecture in March this year [2018].\n\nFor adults only, we recommend MMR vaccination.\n\nAlthough the government has set the goal of 'eliminating rubella in 20 years,' the disease can affect the Tokyo Olympic Games as well as preventing the attainment of the goal as it is. On 22 Oct 2018, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended that pregnant women who had no vaccination or past history of infection not travel to Japan because rubella was prevalent there.\n\nThe country has a responsibility to take specific measures to stop the outbreak of rubella, but the epidemic continues to expand, and it is also necessary for individuals to take action to prevent infection. People who live in endemic areas and who lack rubella antibodies should undergo antibody testing and vaccination.\n\nWhen a woman up to about 20 weeks gestation is infected with rubella virus, a baby born may develop a disease called 'congenital rubella syndrome,' with heart disease, deafness or cataracts. Because pregnant women cannot receive rubella vaccines, women who do not have antibodies need to be vaccinated twice before pregnancy. Because some people cannot be vaccinated due to immunodeficiency etc., it is necessary to prevent rubella outbreaks in society as a whole.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Kunihiko Iizuka\n\n[Rubella cases in Japan closely monitored (in Hong Kong): The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) [in Hong Kong] is closely monitoring an increase in the number of rubella (also known as 'German measles') cases in Japan and appealed to the travellers and members of the public for vigilance and reiterated that vaccination is the most effective way to prevent the disease.\n\nAccording to the information from the health authority of Japan, an ongoing outbreak of rubella is being observed in the country. A total of 1289 cases of rubella have been recorded in 2018 (as of 17 Oct 2018) with 914 cases reported in the past 6 weeks, as compared to 93, 126 and 163 cases recorded in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Among these 1289 cases in 2018, 1062 (82.4%) were affected males with 63% of them aged between 30-49 years. The cumulative incidence in 2018 was highest in Chiba (37.6 cases per million population), followed by Tokyo (32 cases per million population) and Kanagawa (17.9 cases per million population).\n\nImmunisation against rubella is the most effective way to prevent the disease. People who intend to travel to Japan are advised to review their vaccination history and past medical history. People who had received rubella-containing vaccine documented by vaccination record, past history of laboratory confirmed rubella infection, or positive blood test for rubella antibody are considered to be immune against rubella. Otherwise, they can be considered as non-immune to rubella.\n\n'As rubella-containing vaccine is contraindicated in pregnant women, all pregnant women and women preparing for pregnancy who are non-immune to rubella should not travel to Japan during the outbreak period,' a spokesman for the CHP said on 23 Oct 2018.\n\nFor those without rubella vaccination, with unknown vaccination history or unknown immunity against rubella, they are advised to consult their doctor for advice on vaccination, which is usually given together with mumps and rubella vaccines as the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) combined vaccine. As it takes about 2 weeks after vaccination for antibodies to develop and provide protection against rubella, non-immune travellers are advised to plan and get vaccinated ahead, except pregnant women and women preparing for pregnancy (Excerpted from https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/201810/23/P2018102300850.htm).\n\nJapan has not had a consistent vaccination policy against measles, mumps, rubella, and as a result, there are pockets of non-immune, susceptible individuals in the country.

By: Ian NjeruDickens OnyangoYusuf AjackElizabeth Kiptoo. BMC Infectious Diseases 2015, 15:245.\n---------------------\nIntroduction\n----------\nRubella infection has been identified as a leading cause of birth defects commonly known as congenital rubella syndrome (CRS). Kenya does not currently have a rubella immunization program or a CRS surveillance system. In 2014, a rubella outbreak was reported in a rural district in Kenya. We investigated the outbreak to determine its magnitude and describe the outbreak in time, place and person.\n\nMethods\n--------\nWe analyzed the laboratory-confirmed rubella cases from 2010 to 2014 to understand the burden of the disease in the country. The Rubella outbreak was detected using the case-based measles surveillance system. A suspected case was a person with generalized rash and fever, while a confirmed case was a person who tested positive for rubella IgM.\n\nAll laboratory-confirmed and epidemiologically linked cases were line listed. The measles case-based surveillance database was used to identify rubella cases from 2010 to 2014.\n\nResults\n------\nA total of 125 rubella cases were line listed. 54 percent of cases were female. Case age ranged from 3 months to 32 years with a median of 4 years.\n\n51 percent were aged less than 5 years, while 82 percent were aged less than 10 years. Six percent of the cases were women of reproductive age.\n\nAll cases were treated as outpatients, and there were no deaths. The number of confirmed rubella cases was 473 in 2010, 604 in 2011, 300 in 2012, 336 in 2013 and 646 in 2014.\n\nConclusions:\n----------\nAnalysis of Kenya rubella data shows that rubella is endemic throughout the country, and many outbreaks may be underestimated or undocumented. Six percent of all the cases in this outbreak were women of reproductive age, indicating that the threat of CRS is real. The country should consider initiating a CRS surveillance system to quantify the burden with the goal of introducing rubella vaccine in the future.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[This retrospective analysis of a rubella outbreak in a rural Kenyan District in 2014 clearly demonstrates the need for routine rubella immunization in rural Kenya - Mod.CP\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/174.]", "summary": "Communicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[This retrospective analysis of a rubella outbreak in a rural Kenyan District in 2014 clearly demonstrates the need for routine rubella immunization in rural Kenya - Mod.

Since the case had not recently traveled overseas, Taiwan CDC determined the case to be an indigenous case. The possible source of infection is still being investigated.\n\nTo prevent further transmission of the disease, the health authorities has implemented a number of prevention measures and identified 121 contacts, including his family members, colleagues, and healthcare personnel and patients that he came in contact with when he sought medical attention, to monitor and follow up until [18 Feb 2015]. Currently, besides the case's wife who developed cough, none of the other contacts has developed any suspected symptoms. In addition, rubella infection has been eliminated from the case's wife.\n\nIn 2014, Taiwan reported 7 rubella cases, 6 of which were imported. Rubella infection in people is typically mild. However, in pregnant women, rubella can cause death or birth defects such as cataracts, deafness, glaucoma, and heart, lung and brain abnormalities in an unborn baby (fetus) during the 1st few months of pregnancy. Rubella is a highly contagious disease.\n\nPeople who are infected with rubella are infectious from 1 week before to at least 4 days after the rash appears. It is transmitted through airborne droplets or close contact with the patient, but it is vaccine-preventable.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n['Rubella is an acute, contagious viral infection. While the illness is generally mild in children, it has serious consequences in pregnant women, causing fetal death or congenital defects known as congenital rubella syndrome (CRS). The rubella virus is transmitted by airborne droplets when infected people sneeze or cough. Humans are the only known host. In children, the disease is usually mild, with symptoms including a rash, low fever (under 39 deg C [102.2 deg F]), nausea, and mild conjunctivitis. The rash, which occurs in 50-80 per cent of cases, usually starts on the face and neck before progressing down the body and lasts 1-3 days. Swollen lymph glands behind the ears and in the neck are the most characteristic clinical feature. Infected adults, more commonly women, may develop arthritis and painful joints that usually last from 3-10 days. Once a person is infected, the virus spreads throughout the body in about 5-7 days. Symptoms usually appear 2-3 weeks after exposure. The most infectious period is usually 1-5 days after the appearance of the rash.\n\n'When a woman is infected with the rubella virus early in pregnancy, she has a 90 per cent chance of passing the virus on to her fetus. This can cause miscarriage, stillbirth or severe birth defects known as CRS. Infants with CRS may excrete the virus for a year or more. Children with CRS can suffer hearing impairments, eye, and heart defects and other lifelong disabilities, including autism, diabetes mellitus, and thyroid dysfunction, many of which require costly therapy, surgeries, and other expensive care.\n\n'The rubella vaccine is a live [naturally] attenuated strain that has been in use for more than 40 years.

'The elimination of rubella from the Americas is a historic achievement that reflects the collective will of our region's countries to work together to achieve ambitious public health milestones,' said PAHO/WHO Director Carissa F. Etienne. 'Ours was the 1st region to eradicate smallpox, the 1st to eliminate polio, and now the 1st to eliminate rubella. All 4 achievements prove the value of immunization and how important it is to make vaccines available even to the remotest corners of our hemisphere.'\n\n'Three years ago, governments agreed [on] a Global Vaccine Action Plan. One of the plan's targets is to eliminate rubella from 2 WHO regions by end-2015. I congratulate the Americas Region for being the 1st region to achieve this,' said Dr Margaret Chan, director general of the World Health Organization.\n\nRubella, also known as German measles, caused widespread outbreaks throughout the Americas before the introduction of the MMR vaccine. Although the virus usually causes mild or asymptomatic infections in children and adults, when contracted by women early in pregnancy, it can cause miscarriage or CRS, a constellation of birth defects that often includes blindness, deafness, and congenital heart defects. Before mass-scale rubella vaccination, an estimated 16 000 to more than 20 000 children were born with CRS each year in Latin America and the Caribbean, while more than 158 000 rubella cases were reported in 1997 alone. In the United States, 20 000 infants were born with CRS during the last major rubella outbreak (1964-65).\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[According to CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy) News: 'Carissa Etienne, MD, PAHO director, said in the release, 'The fight against rubella has taken more than 15 years, but it has paid off with what I believe will be one of the most important Pan American public health achievements of the 21st century,' she said.

The infection is usually mild with fever and rash. The average incubation period is 14 days (range, 12-23 days).\n\nRubella usually causes the following symptoms in children: a rash that starts on the face and spreads to the rest of the body and low fever (less than 101 F [38 C]). These symptoms last 2 or 3 days. Older children and adults may also have swollen glands and symptoms like a cold before the rash appears. Aching joints occur in many cases, especially among young women. About half of the people who get rubella do not have symptoms.\n\nComplications include birth defects if infection is acquired by a pregnant woman: deafness, cataracts, heart defects, mental retardation, and liver and spleen damage (at least a 20 percent chance of damage to the fetus if a woman is infected early in pregnancy).\n\nThe virus is spread person to person through coughing and sneezing through contact or droplets shed from the respiratory secretions of infected people. People may shed virus from 7 days before the onset of the rash to approximately 5-7 days after rash onset. Transmission from mother to fetus can also occur, with the highest risk of congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) if infection occurs in the 1st trimester. Infants with CRS can transmit virus for up to one year after birth.\n\nRubella vaccine (contained in MMR vaccine) can prevent this disease. Even though endemic rubella virus transmission has been interrupted in the Americas, rubella virus continues to circulate widely, especially in Africa, the Eastern Mediterranean, and Southeast Asian regions. In 2013, 2 large outbreaks were reported in Poland and Japan; cases were mostly among adolescent boys and adult men, but pregnant women were also affected, and their children subsequently developed CRS. In the United States, endemic rubella virus transmission has been eliminated since 2001, but cases continue to be imported. From 2004 to 2013, a median of 10 (range, 4-18) imported cases were reported annually in the United States, and 6 CRS cases were reported during the same period (excerpted from http://www.cdc.gov/rubella/about/index.html).\n\nGongshan Derung and Nu Autonomous County are in Yunnan province in the People's Republic of China.

That implies that the past 2 months have easily doubled the number of cases.\n\nThe latest week's cases were highest in Osaka and Tokyo Prefectures with 129 and 82 new cases, respectively. Mapping the spread of the virus may no longer be based on prefecture proximity, as both prefectures are separated by the Chubu Region, or central Japan. With about 800 cases every 7 days during the earlier weeks, the National Institute of Infectious Diseases should have reckoned its effect with such escalating cases. The epidemic has been more prevalent among men from 20 to 40 years old, amounting to 75 percent of the cases.\n\nAlso known as German measles or 3-day measles, rubella is considered a mild infection except for those who are pregnant. The virus, when caught by someone pregnant, may cause severe congenital complications like growth and mental retardation, deafness, and heart defects among others. Rubella may also cause stillbirths. The symptoms of rubella are not easily noticed and may be mistaken as those of flu, so pregnant women are always told to take precautions especially during the 1st trimester of pregnancy.\n\nA call for the government to fund anti-rubella vaccine has been raised. However, Norihisa Tamura of the Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare said that Japan's rubella cases, the 10 000 cases as of June 2013, are 'not overwhelmingly larger' compared to other infectious diseases. Adults, especially those with immunization, may be able to survive the virus but given that the symptoms of rubella are similar to those of other communicable diseases, pregnant women and small children are likely to be at risk.

On the following day [15 Mar 2015], she sought medical attention at a medical center. On [18 Mar 2015], rubella infection was confirmed. Prior to her disease onset, she had traveled to Viet Nam, Indonesia, and Hong Kong. As a result, the Taiwan CDC has determined her to be an imported case and the 2nd confirmed rubella case in Taiwan this year [2015].\n\nAccording to health officials, she worked on 6 different flights, including flights CI116 and CI117 that traveled to and from Taoyuan [municipality in northwestern Taiwan] and Fukuoka [prefecture on the northern shore Kyushu Island, Japan] on [8 Mar 2015], flights CI110 and CI111 that traveled to and from Taoyuan and Fukuoka on 10 and 11 Mar 2015, and flights CI753 and CI754 that traveled to and from Taoyuan and Singapore on 13 and 14 Mar 2015.\n\nContact tracing has identified 686 contacts, including her family members, her fellow crew members, passengers on the same flights, healthcare personnel, and patients that she came into contact with when she sought medical attention, to monitor and follow up until [11 Apr 2015].\n\nPassengers on the flights are urged to contact their local health officials and to be aware of rubella symptoms and monitoring their health for the next 21 days. Pregnant women who took the same flight are urged to seek medical attention to determine the need for treatment.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), rubella, sometimes called German measles or 3-day measles, is a contagious disease caused by a virus. The infection is usually mild with fever and rash. It is spread by contact with an infected person through coughing and sneezing.\n\nWhile symptoms of rubella are typically mild, a rash that starts on the face and spreads to the rest of the body with low fever and body aches, if a pregnant woman contracts rubella virus, her baby could have birth defects such as deafness, cataracts, heart defects, mental disabilities, and organ damage. The health problems due to the infection are called congenital rubella syndrome.\n\n[Byline: Robert Herriman]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-MBDS from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed-mbds@promedmail.org>\n\n[Rubella is a contagious, generally mild viral infection that occurs most often in children and young adults. In pregnant women, this disease may cause fetal death or congenital defects known as congenital rubella syndrome (CRS). Worldwide, an estimated 110 000 babies are born with CRS every year. While there is no specific treatment for rubella, the disease is preventable by vaccination.\n\nThe rubella virus is transmitted by airborne droplets when infected people sneeze or cough. Humans are the only known host.\n\nIn children, the disease is usually mild, with symptoms including a rash, low fever (less than 39 C / 102.2 F), nausea, and mild conjunctivitis. The rash, which occurs in 50-80 percent of cases, usually starts on the face and neck before progressing down the body, and lasts 1-3 days. Swollen lymph glands behind the ears and in the neck are the most characteristic clinical feature. Infected adults, more commonly women, may develop arthritis and painful joints that usually last from 3-10 days.\n\nOnce a person is infected, the virus spreads throughout the body in about 5-7 days. Symptoms usually appear 2 to 3 weeks after exposure. The most infectious period is usually 1-5 days after the appearance of the rash.\n\nWhen a woman is infected with the rubella virus early in pregnancy, she has a 90 percent chance of passing the virus on to her fetus. This can cause miscarriage, stillbirth, or severe birth defects known as CRS. Infants with CRS may excrete the virus for a year or more.\n\nChildren with CRS can suffer hearing impairments, eye and heart defects, and other lifelong disabilities, including autism, diabetes mellitus, and thyroid dysfunction, many of which require costly therapy, surgeries, and other expensive care.\n\nThe highest risk of CRS is in countries where women of childbearing age do not have immunity to the disease (either through vaccination or from having had rubella). Before the introduction of the vaccine, up to 4 babies in every 1000 live births were born with CRS.\n\nLarge-scale rubella vaccination during the past decade has practically eliminated rubella and CRS in many developed and in some developing countries. The WHO Region of the Americas has had no endemic (naturally-transmitted) cases of rubella infection since 2009. CRS rates are highest in the WHO African and Southeast Asian regions where vaccine coverage is lowest.\n\nThe rubella vaccine is a live attenuated strain that has been in use for more than 40 years. A single dose gives more than 95 percent long-lasting immunity, which is similar to that induced by natural infection.\n\nRubella vaccines are available either in monovalent formulation (vaccine directed at only one pathogen) or more commonly in combinations with other vaccines such as with vaccines against measles (MR), measles and mumps (MMR), or measles, mumps, and varicella (MMRV).\n\nAdverse reactions following vaccination are generally mild. They may include pain and redness at the injection site, low-grade fever, rash, and muscle aches. Mass immunization campaigns in the Region of the Americas involving more than 250 million adolescents and adults did not identify any serious adverse reactions associated with the vaccine (http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs367/en/).\n\nIt is understood that all the 686 contacts with the index cases are mostly those with no history of either prior natural disease occurrence or rubella immunization (95 percent protection). While pregnant women are at the highest and immediate risk, male contacts will disseminate the disease further to this former particular risk group.\n\nMaps of Taiwan can be seen at http://www.mapsofworld.com/taiwan/taiwan-political-map.htm and http://healthmap.org/promed/p/193. - Mod.ST]", "summary": "\n\nWhile symptoms of rubella are typically mild, a rash that starts on the face and spreads to the rest of the body with low fever and body aches, if a pregnant woman contracts rubella virus, her baby could have birth defects such as deafness, cataracts, heart defects, mental disabilities, and organ damage.

As of 2013, goals to eliminate rubella have been established in 2 World Health Organization regions (the Region of the Americas by 2010 and the European Region by 2015), and targets for accelerated rubella control and CRS prevention have been established by the Western Pacific Region (WPR). In 1976, Japan introduced single-antigen rubella vaccine in its national immunization program, targeting girls in junior high school. In 1989, a measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine was introduced, targeting children aged 12-72 months. However, adult males remain susceptible to rubella. From [1 Jan 2013] to [1 May 2013], a total of 5442 rubella cases were reported through the rubella surveillance system in Japan, with the majority (77 per cent) of cases occurring among adult males. A total of 10 infants with CRS were reported from October 2012 to [1 May 2013]. Countries and regions establishing a goal of accelerated control or elimination of rubella should review their previous and current immunization policies and strategies to identify and vaccinate susceptible persons and to ensure high population immunity in all cohorts, both male and female.\n\nFrom 1999 to 2007, rubella surveillance in Japan consisted of aggregate case reporting to the pediatric sentinel surveillance system. Cases were reported from a representative sample of about 3000 pediatric inpatient and outpatient medical facilities. In January 2008, the sentinel surveillance systems were replaced by nationwide case-based surveillance for rubella, and all physicians were required to report any clinically diagnosed or laboratory-confirmed rubella case to local health officials. In April 1999, nationwide, case-based surveillance for CRS had been established.\n\nUntil the early 2000s, rubella was endemic in Japan, with periodic epidemics approximately every 5 years and seasonal increases in the spring and summer. The number of reported rubella cases remained at record low levels until 2010, and in 2011, a few outbreaks were reported in the workplace among adult males. In 2012, the number of rubella cases sharply increased to 2392, with the rise in cases continuing into 2013. From [1 Jan 2013] to [1 May 2013], a total of 5442 rubella cases were reported. Of these cases, 3936 (72.3 per cent) were laboratory confirmed. Geographically, over 60 per cent of rubella cases were reported from the Kanto [region] in the eastern part of Japan, comprised of Tokyo and its surrounding prefectures. In recent weeks, the epidemic has expanded from Kanto to other parts of Japan, including Osaka, Hyogo, Aichi, Fukuoka, and Kagoshima. Of the 5442 cases, males accounted for 4213 cases (77.4 per cent), of which 3878 cases (92.0 per cent) were in persons over 20 years old. Of the 4834 cases in persons over 20 years old, 1727 (36 per cent) were in persons aged 30-39 years and 1535 (32 per cent) in persons aged 20-29 years. Among rubella cases, vaccination history was unknown in a majority of cases (3538 [65 per cent]). For the 1904 reported rubella cases with known vaccination status, 1566 (82 per cent) occurred in persons who had not received rubella vaccine. Virus genotypes were determined for 150 cases in 2012; of these, 123 (82.0 per cent) and 26 (17.0 per cent) were genotypes 2B and 1E, respectively.\n\nFrom 2008 to 2011, 3 cases of CRS were reported nationwide. Since October 2012, 10 CRS cases have been reported from Hyogo (2), Aichi (2), Osaka (2), Tokyo (1), Kagawa (1), Saitama (1), and Kanagawa (1). Of the mothers of infants with CRS, 6 had not received rubella vaccine, and 4 had unknown vaccination history.\n\nPopulation immunity is measured by administrative coverage and seroprevalence surveys. In 2011, administrative measles-rubella (MR) vaccine coverage was 95.3 per cent at age one year, 92.8 per cent at age 5-6 years, 88.1 per cent at age 12-13 years, and 81.4 per cent at age 17-18 years. Population immunity for 8 vaccine-preventable diseases is measured by the National Epidemiological Surveillance of Vaccine Preventable Diseases, an annual, national seroepidemiologic survey conducted among a representative sample of the Japanese population. In 2012, 14 prefectures in Japan joined this serologic survey by measuring rubella hemagglutination inhibition antibody levels in 5094 healthy persons. Among adults aged 30-50 years, seropositivity for rubella antibody (1:8) was 73-86 per cent among males and 97-98 per cent among females.\n\nIn response to the current outbreak, Japan's Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare provided guidance to health care authorities. The guidance is to provide information on rubella disease and CRS for pregnant women and their households and encouraged vaccination of the family members of pregnant women (because rubella vaccine is contraindicated in pregnant women) and vaccination for women who plan to get pregnant. The local governments in approximately 100 cities, including several districts in the Tokyo metropolitan area that had high numbers of reported rubella cases, have provided partial funding to help with the cost of MR vaccine or a single rubella vaccine for women planning pregnancy and for men who are living with a pregnant woman. In addition, mass media agencies in Japan have provided information about the rubella epidemic, including rubella disease and CRS, which has helped increase awareness about the importance of rubella vaccination.\n\nMMWR editorial note\n-------------------\nThe primary purpose of rubella vaccination is to prevent congenital rubella virus infection, including CRS. In WPR, the Immunization Technical Advisory Group endorsed a regional accelerated rubella control and CRS prevention goal to decrease rubella incidence to less than 10 cases per million population and CRS incidence to less than 10 cases per million live births each year by 2015. In 2012, Japan reported 18.7 rubella cases per million population, a rate higher than the WPR annual incidence target. As of May 2013 (4 months into the year), the number of reported rubella cases is already double the total number of cases in 2012.\n\nIn 1976, Japan established a goal to prevent CRS and introduced single-antigen rubella vaccine in its national immunization program, targeting girls in junior high school. In 1989, an MMR vaccine was introduced, targeting children aged 12-72 months, but this combination vaccine was withdrawn in 1993 after reports of aseptic meningitis related to the mumps component. In 1995, vaccination policy was changed to make all vaccines strongly recommended but not mandatory, and in 2006, the MR combined vaccine was introduced, with a 2-dose schedule administered at 1-2 years and 5-7 years. After a large measles outbreak in 2007 and 2008, a catch-up MR vaccination program was implemented, targeting 2 age cohorts (those aged 12 years and those aged 17 years) each year from 2008 to 2013 to ensure high population immunity among persons aged 12-22 years in 2013.\n\nIn the current outbreak, males aged 20-39 years, who were not included in the initial rubella vaccination program, accounted for 68 per cent of the reported cases. However, with the introduction of 2 doses of MR vaccine into the national vaccination schedule in 2006 for both boys and girls and the successful catch-up vaccination program, children who are currently under 15 years old account for only 5.6 per cent of the cases. In other countries (for example, Brazil, Chile, and Argentina), where only adolescent or adult females have been targeted through national immunization programs or as part of mass vaccination campaigns, similar large outbreaks have occurred among adolescent and adult males, with a concomitant increase in CRS cases. These types of outbreaks emphasize that national immunization programs should ensure high levels of immunity in all cohorts born since the introduction of rubella vaccine (both males and females) either through the routine program or high-quality mass campaigns that are sufficient to interrupt rubella virus transmission and prevent CRS cases. In addition, programs should implement high-quality, case-based rubella and CRS surveillance and respond promptly and rapidly to outbreaks.\n\nThe effects of this outbreak have been wide-ranging, both within Japan and internationally.

Several countries that initially vaccinated only adolescent or adult women, then later introduced rubella vaccine into their routine programs or conducted mass campaigns in adolescent and adult females, have experienced large rubella outbreaks among adolescent and young adult males, with a concomitant increase in infants with CRS. In 2012, the number of rubella cases in Japan sharply increased to 2392, with the rise in cases continuing into 2013 and resulting in a cumulative total of 5442 cases from 1 Jan 2013 to 1 May 2013. Of these cases, 23 per cent were in females. Since October 2012, 10 congenital rubella syndrome cases have been reported.

In cohorts born since the introduction of rubella vaccine, this immunity is achieved primarily through uniformly high vaccination coverage. - Mod.CP\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/r/62Cn.]", "summary": "From [1 Jan 2013] to [1 May 2013], a total of 5442 rubella cases were reported through the rubella surveillance system in Japan, with the majority (77 per cent) of cases occurring among adult males. These types of outbreaks emphasize that national immunization programs should ensure high levels of immunity in all cohorts born since the introduction of rubella vaccine (both males and females) either through the routine program or high-quality mass campaigns that are sufficient to interrupt rubella virus transmission and prevent CRS cases. In 2012, the number of rubella cases in Japan sharply increased to 2392, with the rise in cases continuing into 2013 and resulting in a cumulative total of 5442 cases from 1 Jan 2013 to 1 May 2013. In 2011, administrative measles-rubella (MR) vaccine coverage was 95.3 per cent at age one year, 92.8 per cent at age 5-6 years, 88.1 per cent at age 12-13 years, and 81.4 per cent at age 17-18 years. The international spread of rubella virus from Japan provides a reminder that countries in regions that have eliminated rubella need to maintain high levels of vaccination coverage and high-quality surveillance to limit the spread and detect imported rubella virus. The local governments in approximately 100 cities, including several districts in the Tokyo metropolitan area that had high numbers of reported rubella cases, have provided partial funding to help with the cost of MR vaccine or a single rubella vaccine for women planning pregnancy and for men who are living with a pregnant woman. Countries using rubella vaccine should aim to prevent rubella outbreaks by ensuring high rubella immunity across all age groups (both males and females). Several countries that initially vaccinated only adolescent or adult women, then later introduced rubella vaccine into their routine programs or conducted mass campaigns in adolescent and adult females, have experienced large rubella outbreaks among adolescent and young adult males, with a concomitant increase in infants with CRS. In WPR, the Immunization Technical Advisory Group endorsed a regional accelerated rubella control and CRS prevention goal to decrease rubella incidence to less than 10 cases per million population and CRS incidence to less than 10 cases per million live births each year by 2015. For the 1904 reported rubella cases with known vaccination status, 1566 (82 per cent) occurred in persons who had not received rubella vaccine. After a large measles outbreak in 2007 and 2008, a catch-up MR vaccination program was implemented, targeting 2 age cohorts (those aged 12 years and those aged 17 years) each year from 2008 to 2013 to ensure high population immunity among persons aged 12-22 years in 2013. The guidance is to provide information on rubella disease and CRS for pregnant women and their households and encouraged vaccination of the family members of pregnant women (because rubella vaccine is contraindicated in pregnant women) and vaccination for women who plan to get pregnant. In addition, mass media agencies in Japan have provided information about the rubella epidemic, including rubella disease and CRS, which has helped increase awareness about the importance of rubella vaccination. \n\nIn the current outbreak, males aged 20-39 years, who were not included in the initial rubella vaccination program, accounted for 68 per cent of the reported cases. Of the 5442 cases, males accounted for 4213 cases (77.4 per cent), of which 3878 cases (92.0 per cent) were in persons over 20 years old. As of May 2013 (4 months into the year), the number of reported rubella cases is already double the total number of cases in 2012. Of the 4834 cases in persons over 20 years old, 1727 (36 per cent) were in persons aged 30-39 years and 1535 (32 per cent) in persons aged 20-29 years. From [1 Jan 2013] to [1 May 2013], a total of 5442 rubella cases were reported. ------------------------------------------\nRubella usually is a mild, febrile rash illness in children and adults; however, infection early in pregnancy, particularly during the 1st 16 weeks, can result in miscarriage, stillbirth, or an infant born with birth defects (that is, congenital rubella syndrome [CRS]). As of 2013, goals to eliminate rubella have been established in 2 World Health Organization regions (the Region of the Americas by 2010 and the European Region by 2015), and targets for accelerated rubella control and CRS prevention have been established by the Western Pacific Region (WPR). In January 2008, the sentinel surveillance systems were replaced by nationwide case-based surveillance for rubella, and all physicians were required to report any clinically diagnosed or laboratory-confirmed rubella case to local health officials. Among rubella cases, vaccination history was unknown in a majority of cases (3538 [65 per cent]).", "reports": [{"diseases": ["unknown", "other", "measles", "mumps", "rubella"], "syndromes": ["meningitis"], "event_date": ["2015-03-25 00:00:00", "1976-03-25 00:00:00", "5094-03-25 00:00:00", "2392-03-25 00:00:00", "4834-03-25 00:00:00", "2008-01-25 00:00:00", "2010-03-25 00:00:00", "1904-03-25 00:00:00", "1999-04-25 00:00:00", "1989-03-25 00:00:00", "1566-03-25 00:00:00", "2013-01-01 00:00:00", "2012-03-25 00:00:00", "1535-03-25 00:00:00", "2013-05-01 00:00:00", "2006-03-25 00:00:00", "2007-03-25 00:00:00", "5442-03-25 00:00:00", "2013-03-25 00:00:00", "2021-03-09 00:00:00", "2013-05-25 00:00:00", "1727-03-25 00:00:00", "1995-03-25 00:00:00", "1993-03-25 00:00:00", "2012-10-25 00:00:00", "2011-03-25 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Fukuoka", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Japan", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "the United States", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Osaka", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Aichi", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Argentina", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "MR", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Chile", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Canada", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Saitama", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Tokyo", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Brazil", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "1757780", "headline": "PRO/EDR> Rubella - Japan (08): vaccination update", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=1757780", "date": "2013-06-06 14:15:14", "main_text": "RUBELLA - JAPAN (08): VACCINATION UPDATE\n****************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Thu 6 Jun 2013\nFrom: Tsuyoshi Ogata <t.ogata@pref.iba> [edited]\n\n\nRubella in Japan: comment on vaccination\n----------------------------------------\nAccording to the National Institute of Infectious Diseases in Japan, as of week 21 2013 [20-26 May 2013], 672 cases of clinically or laboratory-confirmed rubella were reported in Japan.

The epidemic was mainly in Tokyo, the capital of Japan, but now has spread to almost all over Japan. According to the National Institute of Infectious Diseases, as of week 21, 2013 [week ending 25 May 2013], Osaka area, on the west side of Japan, exceeded Tokyo in regards to the number of rubella cases. 204 cases of either clinically or laboratory-confirmed rubella cases were reported from Osaka that week, followed by Tokyo (112 cases), Hyogo (85 cases), and Kanagawa (61 cases). 672 cases of rubella were reported on week 21 from all over Japan. As of this week, 8507 cases of rubella were reported in total, which is far more than the total number of rubella cases reported in 2012 (2392). The majority of the patients are males in their 30's, who often missed rubella vaccination (vide infra).\n\nAs of [10 May 2013], 5 new cases of congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) have been reported in 2013. In the last decade, 25 cases of CRS were reported in Japan, including those reported this year [2013]. Some municipalities decided to subsidize vaccination fees for those who are at risk. However, Japan's Government has not moved forward to change the current status; it will not subsidize vaccination fees for anybody beyond children on the routine vaccination schedule, nor develop catch-up vaccination program for adolescents or adults at risk.\n\nGenerally, rubella is common in the spring to summer. Therefore, the number of patients may continue to rise. Urgent vaccinations against rubella need to be promoted for all of people who have never had rubella before and have not been immunized against it.\n\nThe original information sources for this report include:\n- National Institute of Infectious disease\nhttp://www0.nih.go.jp/niid/idsc/idwr/diseases/rubella/rubella2013/rube13-21.pdf (partly in Japanese),\nhttp://www.nih.go.jp/niid/en/iasren/2930-inx393-e.html\n- Tokyo Metropolitan Infectious Disease Surveillance Center\nhttp://idsc.tokyo-eiken.go.jp/assets/weekly/2013/10e.pdf\n\nRubella is an acute, viral infection spread via droplets. While the illness is generally mild in children, it has serious consequences in pregnant women, causing fetal death or congenital defects known as congenital rubella syndrome (CRS). When an adult woman is infected with rubella virus early in pregnancy, she has a 90 percent chance of passing the virus on to her fetus. This can cause miscarriage, stillbirth, or severe birth defects known as CRS. Infants with CRS may excrete the virus for a year or more. Children with CRS can suffer hearing impairments, eye and heart defects, and other lifelong disabilities, including autism, diabetes mellitus, and thyroid dysfunction, many of which require costly therapy, surgeries, and other expensive care.\n\nRubella vaccine is normally included as a component of the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) triple vaccine administered in early childhood. The rubella component of the MMR triple childhood vaccine is a live [naturally] attenuated strain that has been in use for more than 40 years. A single dose gives more than 95 percent long-lasting immunity, which is similar to that induced by natural infection. Because of the occurrence of aseptic meningitis after injection of MMR in 1980's to early 1990's, which was believed to be caused by the mumps component in MMR, the coverage rate of rubella immunization decreased significantly in Japan, particularly in the male population. The Ministry of Health (back then) was intimidated by scores of lawsuits, and was not willing to encourage vaccination programs since then. Japan still has occasional outbreaks of measles and sporadic cases of bacterial meningitis or Japanese encephalitis. These are believed to be partly due to defective vaccination policy and programs in Japan.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nKentaro Iwata, MD, MSc, FACP, FIDSA\nDivision of Infectious Diseases Therapeutics\nKobe University Graduate School of Medicine\nKusunoki-cho 7-5-2, Chuo-ku, Kobe, Hyogo 650-0017\nJapan\n\n[ProMED-mail thanks Kentaro Iwata for provision of this update.

The highest numbers of cases reported are in Tokyo followed by Kanagawa then Chiba.\n\nRubella is a moderately contagious disease of the respiratory tract caused by rubella virus. The symptoms of rubella include mild fever, rash, runny nose, sore throat, swollen lymph nodes, and aching joints. Although the symptoms of rubella are mild, infection is more severe in early pregnancy and may cause a variety of birth defects or may even lead to a miscarriage.\n\nIt would be advisable for persons traveling to Japan to make sure they have been vaccinated for rubella (given in combination with the measles and mumps vaccines) 2 weeks before departing.\n\nThe DPHSS encourages pregnant women to protect themselves and parents to protect their infants and young children by minimizing exposure (close contact) to persons who have a rash-like illness and cold symptoms. Parents should check their children's immunization (shot) records to ensure they received all age-appropriate vaccines.\n\nThe current recommendations from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are: children should receive 2 doses of measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine, with the 1st dose given at 1 year of age or older and a 2nd dose given between 4-6 years of age. All persons born during or after 1957 should have documentation of at least one dose of MMR vaccine given on or after the 1st birthday.\n\nFurthermore, all health care providers are urged to review and update the immunization status of all patients they see. If vaccination is contraindicated because of illness, a follow-up appointment should be scheduled to update vaccination as soon as the illness is over.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The reason for the increased incidence of rubella virus infection in Japan is a consequence of past immunisation policy whereby only female members of the population were administered rubella vaccine.

(By Paradowska-Stankiewicz I, Czarkowski MP, Derrough T, Stefanoff P.)\n\nBackground\n----------\nFrom January to April 2013, Poland reported 21 283 rubella cases (55.2 per 100 000 inhabitants), the highest number since 2007. Some 81 percent of cases were among 15-29 year-old males. This outbreak reflects the history of immunisation policies, selective vaccination of adolescent girls since 1989, then universal 2-dose measles-mumps-rubella vaccination since 2004. The extent of virus circulation among adults increases the risk of congenital rubella infections and jeopardises the World Health Organization Regional Office for Europe's 2015 elimination goal.\n\nOngoing rubella outbreak\n------------------------\nFrom January to April 2013, physicians in Poland notified 21 283 rubella cases (55.2 per 100 000 inhabitants) [1], a near 10-fold increase compared with the 2224 cases (5.8 per 100 000 inhabitants) reported during the corresponding period of 2012.\n\nPhysicians use the European Union (EU) case definitions for rubella and congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) [2]. They report each rubella case to the local health department, providing demographic information, International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10 code [3], case classification and vaccination status. Every 2 weeks, local health departments report the number of cases notified in their area to the provincial health departments that aggregate data, which they forward to the National Institute of Public Health - National Institute of Hygiene. Every month, local health departments prepare aggregated reports with more detailed data, including the number of cases by age group, sex, vaccination status and case classification.\n\nPhysicians report CRS cases to the local health departments. Local health departments investigate CRS cases and send individual reports to the National Institute of Public Health - National Institute of Hygiene. There is no routine active case finding search for CRS cases, nor has active CRS surveillance been implemented to date.\n\nWe describe here this country-wide rubella outbreak by person, place and time and propose implementation of preventive measures.\n\nWe calculated reported rates per 100 000 inhabitants, dividing the number of rubella reported cases by mid-year census estimates [4]. The reported rates of rubella varied substantially between provinces (median: 51.2 per 100 000 inhabitants; range: 7.4-151.1 per 100 000 inhabitants). The majority of cases were reported from 3 provinces in the southeast of the country (n=8.659; 41 percent), bordering Ukraine, Belarus and Slovakia, and 5 provinces in the northwest (n=7.997; 38 percent), 2 of which border Germany.\n\nThe male to female ratio was 10:1. The most affected groups were persons who were male aged 15-19 years (12 220 cases, reported rate: 1044.9 per 100 000 inhabitants; 57 percent of cases), 20-24 years (4000 cases, reported rate: 286.8 per 100000 inhabitants; 19 percent of cases) and 25-29 years (992 cases, reported rate: 61.1 per 100 000 inhabitants; 5 percent of cases). During 2003 to 2012 and the 1st 4 months of 2013, rubella reported rates suggested an increasing trend in 2006-2007 and then in 2012, and the 1st 1/3rd of 2013. The increases in 2006-2007 and from 2012 were both more pronounced among males 10 years of age and older, especially in the 1st 4 months of 2013.\n\nVaccination status was recorded for 15 237 (72 percent) reported cases. Of these, 1502 (10 percent) were vaccinated with one dose of rubella-containing vaccine, and 234 (2 percent) with 2 or more doses of rubella-containing vaccine. Of all reported cases, 29 (0.1 percent) were confirmed (based on a valid laboratory test); 57 (0.3 percent) were probable (based on an epidemiological link to a confirmed case), and 21 197 (99.6 percent) were possible (based on clinical symptoms).\n\nFrom January to April 2013, 2 cases of (CRS) were reported, as compared with 4 cases reported during 2003 to 2012.\n\nHistory of rubella immunisation in Poland\n-----------------------------------\nIn 1989, Poland started to administer monovalent rubella vaccine to 13-year-old girls. In 1992-2006, reported coverage ranged from 94 percent to 99 percent [5]. In 2004, measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine was administered to all children at the age of 13-15 months and 10 years [1]. In 2005-2012, 1st-dose coverage among 3-year-old children ranged from 91 percent to 98 percent [5].\n\nIn 2011, a mission of the World Health Organization (WHO) Regional Office for Europe reviewed the rubella situation in Poland, identified an immunity gap among adolescent males and young adults, and recommended supplementary immunisation of all adolescents and young adults, as the increased circulation of rubella among young adults increases the risk of congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) [6].\n\nDiscussion\n---------\nThe 2013 outbreak of rubella in Poland reinforces the need for public health efforts to meet the WHO Regional Office for Europe target for the elimination of measles and rubella and prevention of CRS by 2015 [7]. From April 2012 to March 2013, rubella cases in Poland comprised 74 percent of those in the EU/European Economic Area (EEA) countries [8]. Despite the visible impact of the childhood immunisation programme in decreasing rubella activity among the vaccinated age groups, Poland will not achieve rubella elimination without targeted supplementary immunisation activities.\n\nThe outbreak reflects the historical immunisation activities in Poland: a combination of selective and universal vaccination led to a shift in the age of rubella infections to cohorts of young adults. This situation increases the risk for CRS, due to high circulation of the rubella virus among adolescents and young adult populations. Despite long-term vaccination of adolescent girls, about 10 percent of women of childbearing age may still be susceptible to rubella, as documented in a 2004 study [9]. From January to April 2013, 2 cases of CRS have already been reported, as compared with 4 cases during 2003 to 2012. Further cases are, unfortunately, expected and unavoidable, as observed during outbreaks in other EU/EEA countries in recent years.\n\nThe country most recently affected was Romania. In 2011-2012, Romania reported 20 772 rubella cases, 22 confirmed CRS cases, and 11 cases of congenital rubella infection [10,11]. A similar situation was observed in Greece in the 1990s: a large rubella outbreak was described in 1993, with 25 cases of CRS, and another epidemic occurred in 1999, mainly in young adults, with 4 cases of CRS [12].\n\nThese observations in Greece, Romania and now Poland are a consequence of immunisation practices that had been followed, leading to the build-up of susceptible cohorts. Sadly, rubella outbreaks in young adults unavoidably lead to children being born with CRS. This situation is likely to be repeated if women of childbearing age are left unprotected and become infected with rubella virus. All possible efforts should be undertaken to prevent any cases of CRS in Europe in the future. The availability of rubella-containing vaccines with a long-standing history of good safety and effectiveness profiles, and provision to all those who need it, would ensure that the potentially dramatic consequences of rubella infection in pregnancy would become a thing of the past.\n\nOur report has one main limitation. The vast majority of cases were reported based on clinical symptoms and were not laboratory confirmed. Thus, the clinical cases could be potentially due to a concomitant outbreak of another illness causing a rash.\n\nThis outbreak empirically reflects the shift in the age of infections and the accumulation of susceptible cohorts 10 years after starting universal vaccination. The increased age of infected people leads to an increased risk of CRS. This situation requires immediate public health action to prevent further CRS cases.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Interested readers should consult the original text via the source URL to view the figures and references cited.\n\nThe eradication of rubella virus infection and elimination of the congenital syndrome are closely linked to vaccination policy as described above. Before the introduction of the MMR vaccine, some countries relied on comprehensive vaccination of female children with rubella vaccine, which achieved a reduction in the frequency of the congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) but could never achieve complete elimination. Recently in ProMED-mail, the consequences of a similar policy in Japan have been described in detail [see ProMED archives below].\n\nFinal eradication of congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) will require universal adoption of MR vaccination. Rubella is a contagious, generally mild viral infection that occurs most often in children and young adults. Rubella infection in pregnant women may cause fetal death or the congenital defects known as congenital rubella syndrome. According to the WHO, worldwide, an estimated 110 000 babies are born with CRS every year. When a woman is infected with rubella virus early in pregnancy, she has a 90 percent chance of passing the virus on to her fetus. This can cause miscarriage, stillbirth or the severe birth defects known as CRS. Children with CRS can suffer hearing impairments, eye and heart defects and other lifelong disabilities, including diabetes mellitus and thyroid dysfunction. Before the introduction of vaccine, up to 4 babies in every 1000 live births were born with CRS. - Mod.CP\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/r/1JDJ.]", "summary": "The most affected groups were persons who were male aged 15-19 years (12 220 cases, reported rate: 1044.9 per 100 000 inhabitants; 57 percent of cases), 20-24 years (4000 cases, reported rate: 286.8 per 100000 inhabitants; 19 percent of cases) and 25-29 years (992 cases, reported rate: 61.1 per 100 000 inhabitants; 5 percent of cases).

According to the National Institute of Infectious Diseases, 745 cases of rubella infection have been reported from 1st to 7th week [1 Jan-16 Feb] of 2013 in Japan, almost 20 times higher than a year ago. Of the 745 cases of rubella infection, 591 (79 percent) were male. Among the male patients, 88 percent were aged from 20s through 40s. In the background of this trend, there is the fact that boys had not been vaccinated against rubella by the national immunization program until 1995.\n\nLast year's [2012] rubella epidemic hit 2353 people in total, but just 19 in January. Although there were 5 cases of congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) last year, another case of CRS has already been reported in January 2013.\n\nOn 29 Jan 2013, the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare issued a nationwide alert about the potential for another epidemic and recommended that prefectures and other local governments start promoting vaccination. However, 133 cases of rubella infection were reported in the 8th week [17-23 Feb 2013] in Tokyo, according to the latest report from Infectious Disease Surveillance Center of Tokyo. The appropriate [preventive measures] including urgent vaccinations are recommended especially for women trying to get pregnant and their husbands.\n\nThe original Information sources for this report include:\n- Seroprevalence of rubella in japan\nhttp://idsc.nih.go.jp/yosoku/Rubella/Serum-R2009-e.html\n- The Japan Times\nhttp://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2013/02/08/national/rubella-outbreak-spreading-quickly/#.US-lQqXvOHs\n- Tokyo City Information\nhttp://psa.interfm.jp/Tokyomet/?p=409\n- National Institute of Infectious disease\n<http://www.nih.go.jp/niid/images/idsc/disease/rubella/2013pdf/rube13-07.pdf (partly in Japanese)\n- Tokyo eiken\nhttp://survey.tokyo-eiken.go.jp/epidinfo/weeklyzensu.do (in Japanese)\n\n--\nMugen Ujiie, MD, MTM\nNational Center for Global Health and Medicine\nDisease Control and Prevention Center\n1-21-1 Toyama, Shinjuku,\nTokyo, 162-8655,\nJapan\n<infinite_u@hotmail.com>\n\n[As a result of the circumstance that in Japan prior to 1995 male children were not administered rubella vaccine, there is currently a marked increase in rubella virus infection among males aged predominantly between 20 and 40 years of age.\n\nRubella is an acute, contagious viral infection. While the illness is generally mild in children, it has serious consequences in pregnant women, causing fetal death or congenital defects known as congenital rubella syndrome (CRS). Rubella virus is transmitted by airborne droplets when infected people sneeze or cough. Humans are the only known host. In children, the disease is usually mild, with symptoms including a rash, low fever (under 39 deg C/102.2 deg F), nausea and mild conjunctivitis. The rash, which occurs in 50-80 percent of cases, usually starts on the face and neck before progressing down the body and lasts 1-3 days. Swollen lymph glands behind the ears and in the neck are the most characteristic clinical feature. Infected adults, more commonly women, may develop arthritis and painful joints that usually last from 3-10 days.\n\nWhen an adult woman is infected with rubella virus early in pregnancy, she has a 90 percent chance of passing the virus on to her fetus. This can cause miscarriage, stillbirth, or severe birth defects known as CRS. Infants with CRS may excrete the virus for a year or more. Children with CRS can suffer hearing impairments, eye and heart defects, and other lifelong disabilities, including autism, diabetes mellitus, and thyroid dysfunction, many of which require costly therapy, surgeries, and other expensive care.\n\nRubella vaccine is normally included as a component of the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) triple vaccine administered in early childhood. The rubella component of the MMR triple childhood vaccine is a live [naturally] attenuated strain that has been in use for more than 40 years. A single dose gives more than 95 percent long-lasting immunity, which is similar to that induced by natural infection.

Rubella is known to potentially cause serious complications such as encephalitis. This is the second reported case of encephalitis due to rubella in Japan since last summer.\n\nMoreover, in the 10th week of 2013, a second case of congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) was reported from Aichi prefecture which is located around the middle of Japan. In total 7 cases of CRS has been reported since the beginning of this epidemic of rubella last year [2012].\n\nGenerally, rubella is [more common] in the spring to summer. So the number of patients in the future likely will continue to increase. The Tokyo Prefectural Government on 14 Mar 2013 decided to pay a part of the cost of rubella vaccination in adults aged over 19 years old as emergent preventive measures against this epidemic.

Parents are being asked to speak with their health visitors for advice about vaccinations and arrange for their child to get their jabs at their local surgery.\n\nDr Ruth Milton, director of public health in Hampshire, said: 'The uptake for MMR1 should be even better, but we are most concerned about the MMR2, the pre-school booster given after your child is 3. Every child requires 2 doses of the vaccine to protect them from all 3 diseases. When we reach the 95 per cent target, we have herd immunity, where enough of the population is immunised to protect those that aren't.

While the illness is generally mild in children, it has serious consequences in pregnant women, causing fetal death or congenital defects known as congenital rubella syndrome (CRS). The rubella virus is transmitted by airborne droplets when infected people sneeze or cough. Humans are the only known host. In children, the disease is usually mild, with symptoms including a rash, low fever (under 39 C), nausea and mild conjunctivitis. The rash, which occurs in 50-80 percent of cases, usually starts on the face and neck before progressing down the body and lasts 1-3 days. Swollen lymph glands behind the ears and in the neck are the most characteristic clinical feature. Infected adults, more commonly women, may develop arthritis and painful joints that usually last from 3-10 days. Once a person is infected, the virus spreads throughout the body in about 5-7 days. Symptoms usually appear 2-3 weeks after exposure. The most infectious period is usually 1-5 days after the appearance of the rash.\n\nWhen a woman is infected with the rubella virus early in pregnancy, she has a 90 percent chance of passing the virus on to her fetus.

So it is not true that male children were not administered rubella vaccine prior to 1995 in Japan.\n\nAlthough MMR vaccine was unfortunately discontinued in 1993, Japan had adopted the policy of vaccinating schoolgirls between 1977 and 1995, as several countries also did. As examples, United Kingdom (between 1970 and 1988), Australia (until 1983), Italy (until 1990), and The Netherlands (until 1987) had adopted a selective vaccination policy for girls.\n\nSince the beginning of 2013, a total of 1656 rubella cases have been reported predominantly among males aged between 20 and 40 years old in Japan.

A report mentioned that vaccination strategies that focused on women and children in Brazil were associated with a 5.5-fold greater incidence of rubella in men leading to new outbreaks and CRS [congenital rubella syndrome]. A combined vaccination strategy with a universal approach that included routine vaccination for boys, girls, women, and men should be globally promoted for preventing rubella outbreaks.\n\nThe original information sources for this comment include:\n- National Institute of Infectious Disease\nhttp://www.nih.go.jp/niid/images/idsc/disease/rubella/2013pdf/rube13-10.pdf (partly in Japanese)\n- J Child Psychol Psychiatry. 2005 Jun; 46(6): 572-9.\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15877763\n- Vaccine. 2013 Mar 4. pii: S0264-410X(13)00236-3.\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23470237\n- J R Coll Gen Pract. 1988 May; 38(310): 193-4.\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=3210177\n- Daily Mail\nhttp://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-17509/Why-Japan-banned-MMR-vaccine.html\n- Vaccines, 6th Edition, by Stanley A.

The health authorities have issued the warning after a 1st case was recorded on Tue 8 May 2012 and 5 more a day later.\n\nOfficials say due to the airborne nature of the virus, containment is no longer an option. The Undersecretary for Health Improvement, Dr Cedric Alependava, says a nationwide vaccination program is being organised to start next month [June 2012].\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Transmitted in airborne droplets when infected people sneeze or cough, rubella is an acute, usually mild viral disease traditionally affecting susceptible children and young adults worldwide. Rubella infection just before conception and in early pregnancy may result in miscarriage, foetal death or congenital defects known as congenital rubella syndrome (CRS). The highest risk of CRS is found in countries with high rates of susceptibility to rubella among women of childbearing age.\n\nIn 1996, there were close to 13 000 cases in the WHO Western Pacific Region prior to the introduction of vaccines. Very few countries in these regions had introduced rubella-containing vaccine. Large-scale rubella vaccination during the last decade has drastically reduced or practically eliminated rubella and CRS in many developed and in some developing countries. Indeed, the western hemisphere and several European countries have eliminated rubella and CRS.\n\nThe WHO Measles and Rubella Initiative is backing a new 2012-2020 Measles & Rubella Strategic Plan. The strategic plan presents a 5-pronged strategy to cut global measles deaths by at least 95 percent by 2015 compared with 2000 levels and to achieve measles and rubella elimination in at least 5 WHO regions by 2020.

At: National Institute of Public Health, National Centre for Communicable Diseases Surveillance and Control, Bucharest, Romania, European Programme for Intervention Epidemiology Training (EPIET), European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), Stockholm, Sweden, National Institute of Research and Development for Microbiology and Immunology, Cantacuzino Reference Laboratory for Measles and Rubella, Bucharest, Romania, and Ministry of Health, Bucharest, Romania\n\nIntroduction\n----------\nA rubella outbreak has been ongoing in Salaj, Romania since September 2011 involving 1840 probable and confirmed cases among mainly unvaccinated adolescents. The index case became ill on 6 Sep 2011. The highest number of cases was recorded among 10-14 year olds and 15-19 year olds. Complications were recorded for 11 cases and included meningitis and arthritis. Although the peak has passed, surveillance is being maintained in the region.\n\nAn outbreak of rubella with more than 1800 cases was identified in Salaj, north western Romania, a district with 241 014 inhabitants in 2010. The European Union (EU) case definition [1] was used in the outbreak investigation, and 69 of the 1873 possible cases (3.6 per cent) were classified as laboratory-confirmed and 1771 (94.6 per cent) as probable, defined according to clinical criteria and epidemiological links with a confirmed case; 33 (1.8 per cent) were discarded. Of the 69 laboratory-confirmed cases, 2 were pregnant women, but no case of congenital rubella infection (CRI) has been reported so far.\n\nBackground\n----------\nRubella has been a statutorily notifiable disease in Romania since 1978 [2]. Until 2010, data were reported in aggregated format by age group. In 2010, case-based reporting with mandatory laboratory confirmation was introduced. Since December 2002, as part of the measles surveillance system, clusters of febrile rash are investigated by the local public health authorities and, in order to confirm the clinical diagnosis, it is recommended to take samples from 5-10 cases in each cluster for serological testing for measles and, if the results are negative, for rubella. If rubella transmission is confirmed, pregnant women who are epidemiologically linked to a laboratory-confirmed case or who meet the clinical criteria are given priority for testing and are informed about the potential risks of congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) to the foetus. Although rubella is usually a mild febrile rash illness, infection during pregnancy can lead to miscarriage, stillbirth, and birth defects associated with CRS, such as heart disease, blindness, deafness, and mental retardation.\n\nA national surveillance system for CRS was initiated in Romania in 2000. Newborns of rubella positive mothers have a rubella-specific IgM blood test tested for CRI and are reported in the CRI/CRS surveillance system according to the methodology in place [3]. Rubella is a vaccine preventable disease targeted for elimination in the WHO European Region by 2015 along with measles. Countries in the region have also committed to the prevention of CRS by the same year [4].\n\nA rubella-containing vaccine was 1st available in Romania in 1998 (bivalent measles-rubella), and it was offered to girls aged between 15 and 18 years (birth cohorts 1980-1983) as part of a mass vaccination campaign following a nationwide measles outbreak [5]. After a large rubella outbreak in 2002 to 2003, a rubella-containing vaccine was offered to girls aged between 13 and 14 years until 2008 (birth cohort 1994). In 2004, the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine was introduced in the national immunisation schedule for children aged 12-15 months. Since 2004, MMR vaccination has also been offered to children aged 7 years.\n\nIn 2002 to 2003, a large rubella outbreak occurred in Romania, with more than 115 000 cases reported nationwide, and the highest incidence was reported in children of school age (2564 per 100 000 population aged 5-9 years and 2446 per 100 000 population aged 10-14 years) [6]. By 2010, rubella incidence dropped to 1.6 per 100 000 population (2009: 2.9/100 000; 2008: 8.1/100 000) [7,8].\n\nOutbreak description\n--------------------\nThe index case (laboratory-confirmed) was reported on 6 Sep 2011 to the Salaj Public Health Authority in an unvaccinated 16 year old student attending a local high school. Between 1 Sep 2011 and 23 Jan 2012, 1840 confirmed and probable rubella cases were reported by Salaj Public Health Authority.\n\nOf the 1840 cases 1069 were male, and 771 were female, showing a male:female ratio of 1.4:1. The highest number of cases was recorded in people aged between 10 and 19 years (n=1693). Of these, 1206 cases were registered among 15-19 year olds (58.6 per cent male and 41.4 per cent female) with a male:female ratio of 1.4:1. The rest of 487 cases were registered among 10-14 year olds (55.4 per cent male and 44.6 per cent female) with a male:female ratio of 1.2:1. Taking into account the fertile age, we registered 1341 cases in people aged between 15 and 44 years with a male:female ratio of 1.3:1. Among these 1341 cases, 59.1 per cent were male, and 40.9 per cent were female, giving a male:female ratio of 1.3:1. Of all outbreak cases, 23.3 per cent (428/1840) were registered among children born in 1996.\n\nThe incidence of rubella in Salaj was 763 per 100 000 population, with the highest incidence among high school teenagers aged between 15 and 19 years (9555 per 100 000 population for males and 7067 for females) followed by 10-14 year olds (3854 per 100 000 population for males, 3281 per 100 000 population for females). The 3rd most affected age group was the age group of 20-24 year olds with an incidence of 647 per 100 000 population among males and 154 per 100 000 population among females.\n\nComplications included meningitis (n=2 cases) and arthritis (n=9 cases). 35 cases required hospitalisation, and the median length of hospital stay was 4 days (minimum one, maximum 9). A total of 98 samples were tested for rubella IgM antibodies, and 69 of these were confirmed as positive. In clinical specimens from 2 cases, rubella virus genotype 2B was identified.\n\nVaccination coverage among the reported cases was low: 38 (2.1 per cent) of the total number of cases were vaccinated with one dose of rubella-containing vaccine. Taking into account the eligible birth cohorts for vaccination against rubella and the number of rubella cases reported during the outbreak, we calculated the proportion of rubella cases occurring in birth cohorts from 1989 to 2002. The highest proportion of cases was registered among people born from 1994 to 1997.\n\nWe looked at the rubella vaccination coverage for Romania and Salaj district in the eligible birth cohorts for MMR vaccination at 12-15 months (birth cohort 2004-2008), for MMR vaccination at 7 years (birth cohort 1998-2002), and the rubella dose administered only to girls in birth cohort 1989-2003. The rubella vaccination coverage of the 13 to 14 year old females in Salaj district during 2003 to 2008 is higher, with 3.8 per cent on average, than the coverage in the whole country for the same period. For 2005 to 2009, the MMR vaccination coverage in Salaj was below the country average, except for 7 year old children vaccinated with MMR in 2008 and 2010, when the district coverage was higher than the country average.\n\nControl measures\n----------------\nSince the identification of the outbreak, several control measures have been implemented by the local health authorities. The most important one was the initiation of a MMR vaccination campaign in the district of Salaj targeting all children and adolescents aged between 10 and 19 years, irrespective of their vaccination status. The MMR vaccine is supplied by the Ministry of Health and is offered free of charge through routine immunisation services (family physicians) and special outreach teams. As a result of this special campaign, 210 persons were vaccinated until 31 Dec 2011, but many parents still refused to have their children vaccinated. Local health care workers (doctors and nurses) were recommended to get vaccinated and to try to inform and increase awareness among their patients on the risk of this disease, especially among women of childbearing age.\n\nIn addition, the local public health authorities have initiated rubella screening among pregnant women epidemiologically linked to a probable or a confirmed case. While the general recommendations for MMR vaccination are maintained at national level, some districts bordering Salaj (Alba, Bihor, and Cluj) -- which were also affected by rubella, but to a lesser extent -- have issued vaccination recommendations among teenagers to avoid other potential outbreaks.\n\nDiscussion and conclusions\n--------------------------\nThe results of the investigation revealed that of the total number of rubella [cases] described above, 98 per cent had never been vaccinated against rubella infection. The index case was an unvaccinated teenager, and 1206 of the rubella cases (65.5 per cent) occurred among teenagers aged between 15 and 19 years (born between 1992 and 1996). Taking into account the historical MMR vaccination schedule in Romania, 770 children born between 1995 and 1996 (15-16 year olds in 2011) were not eligible for rubella vaccination and represent 41.8 per cent of all cases. In the birth cohort 1992-1994, only girls were eligible for rubella vaccine at the age of 14 years.\n\nMeasures such as catch up campaigns are important to close existing gaps in vaccination and prevent further spread of the outbreak. Educating the general public on modes of rubella transmission and stressing the need for rubella vaccination is the most important way to prevent further spread of the disease in other districts and to prevent congenital infection.\n\nAlthough the outbreak has passed its peak and is subsiding, surveillance for rubella will be maintained for a least 2 incubation periods (46 days) following onset of rash of the last case [9]. Moreover, active surveillance for infants with CRS will be carried out until the age of 9 months after the last reported rubella case [10].\n\n[Interested readers can view the references cited and the figures and tables by accessing the original text via the source URL. - Mod.CP]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[It is clear that rubella virus infection remains a problem worldwide despite the existence of a secure vaccine and its generally cost-free availability. This appears to be due in part to continuing ignorance of the consequences of rubella infection in women of child-bearing age, and prejudice against the currently offered MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) triple vaccine. It might be beneficial to offer the alternative of a single component rubella vaccine where there is irreconcilable resistance to the MMR vaccine.\n\nThe Romanian county of Salaj lies in the area between the Apuseni Mountains and the Eastern Carpathians known as the Somes River Platform.

Taking into account the eligible birth cohorts for vaccination against rubella and the number of rubella cases reported during the outbreak, we calculated the proportion of rubella cases occurring in birth cohorts from 1989 to 2002. \n\nA rubella-containing vaccine was 1st available in Romania in 1998 (bivalent measles-rubella), and it was offered to girls aged between 15 and 18 years (birth cohorts 1980-1983) as part of a mass vaccination campaign following a nationwide measles outbreak [5]. \n\nVaccination coverage among the reported cases was low: 38 (2.1 per cent) of the total number of cases were vaccinated with one dose of rubella-containing vaccine.

The European Union (EU) case definition [1] was used in the outbreak investigation, and 69 of the 1873 possible cases (3.6 per cent) were classified as laboratory-confirmed and 1771 (94.6 per cent) as probable, defined according to clinical criteria and epidemiological links with a confirmed case; 33 (1.8 per cent) were discarded. The index case was an unvaccinated teenager, and 1206 of the rubella cases (65.5 per cent) occurred among teenagers aged between 15 and 19 years (born between 1992 and 1996). The results of the investigation revealed that of the total number of rubella [cases] described above, 98 per cent had never been vaccinated against rubella infection. If rubella transmission is confirmed, pregnant women who are epidemiologically linked to a laboratory-confirmed case or who meet the clinical criteria are given priority for testing and are informed about the potential risks of congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) to the foetus. Since December 2002, as part of the measles surveillance system, clusters of febrile rash are investigated by the local public health authorities and, in order to confirm the clinical diagnosis, it is recommended to take samples from 5-10 cases in each cluster for serological testing for measles and, if the results are negative, for rubella. Of these, 1206 cases were registered among 15-19 year olds (58.6 per cent male and 41.4 per cent female) with a male:female ratio of 1.4:1. The rest of 487 cases were registered among 10-14 year olds (55.4 per cent male and 44.6 per cent female) with a male:female ratio of 1.2:1.

She confirmed there were a total of 28\nconfirmed cases of rubella, of which 26 were males from the greater\nSuva area, and added that the ages of these victims ranged between 18\nto 32 years.\n\nRubella is an infectious viral illness of humans whose infections in\nchildren and adults are mostly mild, but an infection in women during\nthe early stages of pregnancy can cause serious birth defects or\nmiscarriage.\n\nThe infection is spread by coming into close contact with people who\nhave rubella, particularly if they are coughing or sneezing, and\nsymptoms include a mild fever, rash, runny nose, sore throat and often\nswollen lymph nodes. Aching joints are also common says Dr Saketa.\n\n'If a pregnant woman has a rash and fever or thinks she may have\nrubella, she should inform her clinic doctor as soon as possible. It\nis important to let the staff at the clinic know immediately so they\ncan keep you away from other pregnant women.'\n\nIn Fiji, women born after 1964 were immunised against rubella at 11\nyears of age, but from 2004 onwards, all children were immunised\nagainst rubella when they were one-year old and again with a combined\nmeasles-rubella vaccine when they reached class one. Dr Saketa says\nthe primary goal of the immunisation program is to prevent congenital\nrubella syndrome, as rubella infection in pregnant women during the\n1st 3 months of pregnancy can result in the baby being born with birth\ndefects or congenital rubella syndrome. 'These birth defects include\nheart defects, deafness, brain damage, and eye problems including\ncataracts,' Dr Saketa added.\n\n[Byline: Samisoni Nabilivalu]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nHealthMap Alerts via ProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Since 2 Aug 2011, the number of confirmed cases of rubella (German\nmeasles) in Fiji has more than doubled from 11 to 28. Two of the\noriginal 11 cases were female, whereas all of the newly confirmed 17\ncases are male. The ages of the 2 female cases has not been revealed.\n\nRubella infection is a comparatively mild infection in children and\nadults and has been a vaccine-preventable disease for many years.

The case is a 40 year old man with no\nrecent travel history. On 18 Dec 2010, he developed symptoms such as fever,\nrash and headache. Taiwan CDC later confirmed German measles infection in\nthe case.\n\nDuring the investigation into the source of his infection, personnel from\nTaiwan CDC discovered that a 44 year old woman who resides in the same\ndistrict had developed similar symptoms in mid-November [2010]. When she\nsought medical attention, she was diagnosed with an upper respiratory tract\ninfection. Taiwan CDC also later confirmed rubella infection in her.\nAlthough she travelled to Japan during early November [2010], [the CDC] was\nnot able to determine where she became infected with rubella as she was\ntravelling back and forth between Taiwan and Japan when she developed her\ninfection.\n\nDue to the difference in their disease onset times, they are not directly\nrelated even though both cases reside in the same district. The local\nhealth bureau has already compiled a list of close contacts and is closely\nmonitoring the close contacts. As of now, no suspected case has been reported.\n\nGerman measles, also known as rubella, is caused by the rubella virus. It\nis transmitted through airborne droplet or close contact. The symptoms\ninclude fever, conjunctivitis, nasopharyngitis, swollen glands\n(suboccipital and posterior cervical lymphadenopathy), and rash. If a\npregnant woman becomes infected with German measles during the first 3\nmonths of her pregnancy, there is a 90 per cent chance she will pass the\ninfection to her unborn child and a 25 per cent chance that the child will\ndevelop congenital rubella syndrome, resulting in fetal death, miscarriage,\nor birth defects. Hence, countries around the world work hard to eliminate\nthe disease.\n\nAccording to the surveillance data compiled by Taiwan CDC over the recent\nyears, about 20 to 50 German measles cases are reported each year and\nseveral German measles outbreaks have occurred in factories and at schools\ndue to imported cases. Taiwan still faces the threat of rubella as there\nare ongoing outbreaks in neighboring countries such as China and those in\nSouth East Asia.\n\nThe best way to prevent German measles is vaccination. In Taiwan, the\nexisting routine childhood vaccination schedule recommends a dose of MMR\n(measles, mumps, and rubella) vaccine to children 12 months of age and\nanother dose to 1st graders in elementary schools. Taiwan CDC once again\nreminds the public the importance of timely vaccination for children. Women\nof child-bearing age who are tested negative for rubella antibody during\nthe pre-marital medical examination should receive the MMR vaccine. If\npregnancy occurs before vaccination, avoid crowded public places during\npregnancy to lower the chance of infection.\n\nAbout 25 to 50 per cent of German measles cases occur without symptoms.\nFurther, cases develop symptoms that are similar to those of other\ninfectious and non-infectious diseases. Taiwan CDC reminds all physicians\nto remain vigilant for suspected cases of German measles and report\nsuspected cases that are not vaccinated against German measles and have\ntravelled to endemic areas prior to disease onset to the local health\nbureau immediately for the health authorities to take prompt actions that\nprevent further transmission of the disease.\n\nEmployers who hire foreign workers and schools with foreign students are\nadvised to reinforce health promotion programs and messages. If workers or\nstudents develop suspected symptoms of German measles, employers or schools\nshould assist them in seeking medical attention and report the cases to the\nlocal health authority to prevent further spread of the disease.

Most of the patients are from Cu Chi District, and they work in\nindustrial parks in the city, the local newspaper Labor reported on\nFri 18 Mar 2005.\nTo deal with the situation, local health agencies are strengthening\nvaccination among residents, especially young women at universities\nand factories, and children aged 12-24 months. They are also urging\npeople to improve hygiene in their living and working environments.\nGerman measles, also known as rubella, or 3-day measles, is caused by\na virus that is spread through the air or by close contact. It can\nalso be transmitted to a fetus by a mother with an active infection,\ncausing severe disease in the fetus. In children and adults, rubella\nis usually mild and may even go unnoticed.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[Rubella is endemic world-wide. It is a vaccine-preventable disease,\nand vaccination is universal in most developed countries.\nConsequently, ProMED-mail rarely reports outbreaks of rubella. The\ncurrent outbreak in Ho Chi Minh City attracts attention because of\nits extent and the age groups affected, which suggest either a\nbreakdown in vaccine coverage or an inadequacy of the vaccine\nemployed. Unlike many other infectious disease problems afflicting\nViet Nam at the present time, no vector or alternate host is\ninvolved.

Up to 798 people, mostly female workers, in Viet Nam's southern Ho\nChi Minh City have suffered from rubella -- a contagious viral\ninfection with mild symptoms associated with a rash -- since November\n2004. \nGerman measles, also known as rubella, or 3-day measles, is caused by\na virus that is spread through the air or by close contact. To deal with the situation, local health agencies are strengthening\nvaccination among residents, especially young women at universities\nand factories, and children aged 12-24 months. It can\nalso be transmitted to a fetus by a mother with an active infection,\ncausing severe disease in the fetus. In children and adults, rubella\nis usually mild and may even go unnoticed.\n", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "measles", "rubella"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2004-11-25 00:00:00", "2005-03-25 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Ho Chi \n Minh City", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Ho Chi Minh City", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Ho", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Viet Nam 's", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "2205858", "headline": "PRO/EDR> Rubella - Russia (Kamchatka)", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=2205858", "date": "2004-06-02 23:50:00", "main_text": "RUBELLA - RUSSIA (KAMCHATKA)\n*******************************\nA ProMED-mail post\n<http://www.promedmail.org>\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\n<http://www.isid.org>\nDate: Wed 2 Jun 2004\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: Regions.ru, Regional News Agency, Wed 2 Jun 2004 [translated\nby Mod.NR, edited]\n<http://www.regions.ru/newsheadlines/index.html?section=news&topic=health>\n\nRussia: Rubella outbreak in Kamchatka\n-------------------------------------\nThe number of people who have contracted rubella has risen to 73 in\nthe village of Sobolevo in the Kamchatskiy region. 68 of them are\nchildren.

This\noutbreak is specifically affecting some unvaccinated groups within the\nGereformeerde Gemeente in Nederland (Reformed Community in the Netherlands,\na Christian community).\nUp to Tue 17 May 2005, 214 laboratory confirmed cases of rubella have been\nreported in southwest Ontario. 5 of these cases have been in pregnant\nwomen. The Canadian Christian community where the cases occurred has\nhistorical and social links with the affected groups within the\nGereformeerde Gemeente in Nederland, and individuals frequently travel\nbetween the 2 communities. A definitive source for the Canadian patient\nwith the earliest date of onset reported (mid-February 2005) has not yet\nbeen identified. An isolate has been obtained from the outbreak in Canada\nand is currently being genotyped. Attempts are being made to isolate\nrubella virus in the Netherlands so as to genetically link the respective\noutbreaks. The World Health Organization has recently published a\nstandardised rubella virus genotyping protocol (2).\nIn the Netherlands, up to 17 May 2005, 309 laboratory confirmed cases have\nbeen reported (from 1 Sep 2004); 23 of these are known to be in pregnant\nwomen (9 in their 1st trimester). The geographical spread of the outbreak\nin the Netherlands is documented on the Rijksinstituut voor Volksgezondheid\nen Milieu website: <http://www.rivm.nl/vtv/object_class/atl_infparasit.html>.\nThe epidemiological curve, shown as a figure entitled: ' Reports of\nlaboratory confirmed cases of rubella by week of onset, the Netherlands\n(cases reported between 1 September 2004 - 17 May 2005. Source: Osiris.')\nin the original document shows 3 separate peaks, each larger than the last.\nIt is uncertain whether these peaks reflect the true incidence or are the\nresult of a registration artefact.\nIn both the Netherlands and Canada, the outbreak occurred in a community\nwith low measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccination coverage and strong\nsocial adherence. The proportion of cases in a vaccinated individual is low\n(0.3 percent and 0.6 percent, respectively), indicating that the\neffectiveness of the rubella component of the MMR vaccine is very high.\nRubella infection acquired during early pregnancy can lead to miscarriage\nor severe birth defects known as congenital rubella syndrome (CRS). This\nsyndrome occurs in up to 90 percent of infants born to mothers who are\ninfected in the 1st trimester (3). It is important to differentiate primary\nrubella infection from re-infection because the risk of CRS for\nre-infection during the first trimester of pregnancy is less than 5 to 10\npercent (2). Rubella IgG avidity serology has been shown to be a very\nuseful laboratory test for differentiating primary rubella infections from\nre-infections/past infections in pregnant women where critical patient\nmanagement/counselling decisions are required (4). Rubella IgG avidity\nserology is being used for the investigation of rubella exposure or\nsuspected rubella in pregnant women in the Canadian outbreak.\nRubella and CRS are preventable by immunisation, and both the Netherlands\nand Canada have a routine 2-dose MMR vaccination schedule. During the\noutbreak, health authorities in Canada and the Netherlands have offered MMR\nfree of charge to unvaccinated individuals (in the Netherlands this has\nonly been offered to those under the age of 18). Public health laws in\nOntario allow authorities to exclude unvaccinated children from attending\nschool when there is an outbreak of a vaccine preventable disease. Local\npublic health officials in Ontario have issued indefinite exclusion orders\nfor students who are not immunised or cannot offer proof of immunity. Such\na law does not exist in the Netherlands. In addition, the provincial\nMinistry of Health for Ontario (Ontario Ministry of Health and Long Term\nCare) has given advice on isolation of cases, quarantining of contacts and\ntravel restrictions. This also differs from the Netherlands, where the\nemphasis of public health advice is on advising pregnant women to avoid\ncontact with rubella patients.\nThe effectiveness of both Canadian and Dutch public health advice in\npreventing spread of rubella and in preventing pregnant women from becoming\ninfected is probably limited. This is firstly because members of the\naffected communities often decline vaccination, since it contradicts their\nreligious beliefs. Comprehensive information on the uptake of MMR during\nthis outbreak is not yet available in Canada or the Netherlands. Secondly,\nrubella is most infectious prior to the onset of rash (usual range one week\nprior to 4 days post rash onset). Finally, only a minority of cases are\ndiagnosed, since rubella virus infection can be asymptomatic in up to 50\npercent of cases and, if symptomatic, usually has a mild course.\nFurther spread of the outbreak and risk of CRS depends on herd immunity\n(resulting from vaccination and natural infection) and level of contact\nwith the affected community. In the Netherlands, historical seroprevalence\nand vaccine uptake data suggest that the level of protection in the general\npopulation is high (5). Even in municipalities where a high proportion of\nthe population declines vaccination, seroprevalence studies suggest\nthat >97 percent of women of childbearing age are immune (probably through\ncirculation of rubella virus in the past) (5). In addition to the groups\nwithin the Gereformeerde Gemeente in Nederland, Dutch groups with a\nrelatively low seroprevalence may include some groups of immigrants and\nthose supporting the anti-vaccination movement (including followers of\nhomeopathy and anthroposophical teachings).\nIn Canada, populations with relatively low seroprevalence may include\nimmigrants as well as other groups who resist immunisation for religious\nand philosophical reasons.\nAlthough Reformed Christian communities exist outside the Netherlands and\nCanada, to our knowledge vaccine preventable diseases have only spread\ninternationally from the Netherlands Gereformeerde Gemeente in the\nNederlands to Canada (6,7,8). Canada's temperate climate, which has\nsynchronous seasons to those of the Netherlands, may be one explanation for\nthis. However, onward spread from Canada has been documented in the past:\nthe poliomyelitis outbreak in the Netherlands in 1978 spread to Canada and\nsubsequently into the United States (9).\nPublic health efforts in the Netherlands and Canada are now focusing on\nraising awareness amongst the affected community and health professionals,\ndocumenting (molecular) epidemiological links, and improving surveillance\nof CRS.\nReferences:\n-----------\n(1) Hahne S, Ward M, Abbink F, Binnendijk R van, Ruijs H, Steenbergen J\nvan, Timen A and Melker H de.

'We are\nspeculating that it was introduced from the Netherlands, given the\ncross-border traffic that exists between this community and a similar\ncommunity in the Netherlands,' Basrur said. 'They've had an outbreak going\non for 8 months now in what they call the Bible Belt.' Ontario's health\nminister predicted the outbreak could drag on for some weeks yet.\n'We're really still in the phase of the outbreak where our investigations\nwill lead to more people (with the virus),' George Smitherman said. 'We're\nnot at a point yet where we can declare the outbreak under control.' Basrur\nsaid to date there is no evidence that the virus has moved into other\nnearby religious groups that also shun vaccination. But health officials\nare investigating whether there are any links between the communities and\nwhether additional measures are needed to reduce the chance of it spreading.\nMeanwhile, Basrur said she'll be pressing members of all the religious\ngroups to have their children vaccinated if they are currently unprotected.\n'We have not yet seen spread to the Amish or Mennonite communities. (But)\nthey do live in adjacent geographic areas. And so for that reason, those\nhealth units in which they live will be redoubling their efforts to\nencourage them to seek vaccination,' she said.\nAs of Monday the case count in the outbreak was 121, including the 3\npregnant women. 7 other pregnant women who may have been exposed to the\nhighly contagious virus are under observation.\nRubella poses its greatest risk to fetuses in the first 11 weeks of\ngestation. Children born with congenital rubella syndrome can suffer\ncognitive disabilities or may be deaf or blind. Citing confidentiality\nrules, Basrur wouldn't say at what point in their pregnancy these women are.\nCuriously, the case count also includes a 32 year old man who was\nvaccinated against rubella in 1974. The man attends Westervelt community\ncollege in nearby London, Ontario. Public health authorities urged any\npregnant women at the college to contact their physicians immediately.\nBasrur said it's suspected that this case of vaccine failure was probably\ncaused by a break in what's called the cold chain -- the requirement to\nensure vaccines are stored at temperatures no higher than 8 degrees Celsius\nuntil they are administered.\nIt is believed the man became infected after coming in contact with fellow\nstudents who are older siblings of children attending the religious school\nthat has been at the heart of the outbreak -- Rehoboth Christian School in\nNorwich, about 40 kilometres east of London. The school draws its students\nfrom 4 closely aligned religious denominations: the Heritage Netherlands\nReformed Congregation, the Old Reformed Congregation, the Netherlands\nReformed Congregation of North America, and the Netherlands Reformed\nCongregation. The bulk of the school's 651 students come from this last\nchurch, which is officially neutral on the issue of vaccination. But many\nof its members choose not to immunize their children, and about 60 per cent\nof the students attending Rehoboth Christian School are unvaccinated.\nPublic health authorities have issued an indefinite school exclusion order\nfor unvaccinated children who have never had rubella, which is also known\nas German measles. Rubella is a viral illness spread through coughing or\nsneezing. Its symptoms include rash, fever, swollen glands, joint pain,\nmuscle pain and runny nose. Public health officials hope to eliminate the\nvirus in the Americas by 2010 but have recognized that while the virus\ncirculates elsewhere, eradication here is unlikely.\n[byline: Helen Branswell]\n******\n[2]\nDate: 10 May 2005\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: Canada.com [29 Apr 2005] [edited]\n<http://www.canada.com/health/story.html?id=28cc66e0-c833-4aaf-a22f-8e7472fafbca>\n\nOntario reports large rubella outbreak, warns could be tip of iceberg\n-----------------------\nPublic health officials in Ontario reported a large outbreak of rubella,\nsometimes known as German measles, on Friday [29 Apr 2005] and warned the\n50 cases that have currently been confirmed could be the tip of the iceberg.\nDr Sheela Basrur, the province's chief medical officer of health,\nconfirmed the cluster centres on a school in the Woodstock region in Oxford\nCounty, but has spilled into the neighbouring counties of Brant and\nNorfolk.

This ongoing outbreak revealed gaps in the immunisation programme\nduring the war in BiH (1992-1995) and highlights the need to revise\nlegislation to permit immunisation of children above 14 years of age with\nmeasles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine and to introduce supplemental\nimmunisation activities.\n\nIntroduction\nRubella is a notifiable disease in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH; estimated\npopulation 3.9 million) and is reported on the basis of clinical symptoms.\nRubella immunisation was introduced in the 1980s. In 1999-2000, a 2-dose\nschedule with the measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine was implemented,\nwith the 1st dose given at the age of 12 months (since 2008 at 11 months)\nand the 2nd dose at the age of 7 years and no later than 14 years.\n\nBetween 24 Mar and 31 Jul 2009, 342 clinically diagnosed cases of rubella\nwere notified in 5 municipalities in Republika Srpska (RS), which is one of\n2 governing entities in BiH. At the time of publication of this report, the\noutbreak is ongoing, with circa 4 cases per week. Epidemiological and\nlaboratory investigations were started in early May 2009. Preliminary\nresults are presented below.\n\nMaterials and methods\nSerum samples were collected from 20 suspected rubella cases (6 from\nDubica, 5 from Kotor Varos, 3 from Prijedor, 4 from East Sarajevo-Pale and\n2 from Trebinje). Throat swabs were obtained from the 3 patients from\nPrijedor and from 2 of the 5 patients from Kotor Varos. All sera were\ntested for IgM against measles and rubella and for rubella IgG (Dade\nBehring Enzygnost immunoassays) at the Regional Reference Laboratory (RRL)\nof the World Health Organization Regional Office for Europe (WHO/Europe) in\nLuxembourg, and 10 serum samples were also analysed for rubella IgM at the\nlaboratory of the Public Health Institute of Republika Srpska (PHI RS). The\nthroat swabs were used for PCR analysis as described previously [1] and for\nvirus isolation [2]. Phylogenetic analysis based on the rubella virus E1\nglycoprotein gene was done with MEGA [3], and sequences were compared to\npublished sequences by BLAST.\n\nResults\nOutbreak profile: On 28 May 2009, the PHI RS declared a rubella outbreak in\n3 municipalities in the Banja Luka Region: Prijedor, Dubica and Kotor\nVaros. Later, an outbreak occurred in the East Sarajevo region including\nthe municipalities Pale and Sokolac. In addition, 4 suspected cases were\nreported in Banja Luka and 8 in Doboj.\n\nIn Dubica, 44 rubella cases were reported between 24 Mar and 15 May 2009\n(illustrated graphically in the original text) on the basis of a clinical\ncase definition -- that is, acute onset of generalised maculopapular rash,\nbody temperature higher than 37.2 C and arthralgia/arthritis,\nlymphadenopathy, or conjunctivitis. The outbreak in this area appears to be\nover. The index case was not identified.\n\nIn Kotor Varos, Prijedor and East Sarajevo, where the outbreaks are still\nongoing, 117, 116 and 65 rubella cases, respectively, were reported until\nthe end of July 2009. The last case to date was reported on 15 Sep 2009 in\nSokolac, East Sarajevo.\n\n45 per cent of the cases were male. The age ranged from those born in 1971\nto those born in 2007. Most cases (82 per cent, n=282) were observed among\nteenagers born between 1990 and 1994 still attending high school: 66 per\ncent (29/44) in Dubica, 90 per cent (105/117) in Kotor Varos, all of them\nattending the same school, 87 per cent (101/116) in Prijedor and 72 per\ncent (47/65) in East Sarajevo.\n\nIn Prijedor only 5 of the notified rubella cases had received one dose of\nMMR, while all the other patients were not immunised. The vaccination\nstatus of the cases in Dubica, Kotor Varos and East Sarajevo is still under\ninvestigation.\n\nLaboratory findings\nEight samples were positive for rubella IgM, including 3 from Kotor Varos,\none from Prijedor and 4 from East Sarajevo-Pale, confirming that the\noutbreaks in these regions were caused by rubella. Four sera were\nequivocal, and 8 were IgM-negative for rubella. There was a 100 per cent\nconcordance between the test results obtained at PHI RS and the Luxembourg\nRRL for the 10 sera tested in both laboratories.\n\nThe rubella-positive samples were from 7 patients aged 15 to 17 years and\nfrom one aged 24 years. Five of them had received one dose of rubella\nvaccine, 2 were not vaccinated against rubella, and for one patient no\ninformation on the vaccination status was available. One rubella\nIgM-positive patient was negative for rubella IgG, while the other 7 showed\nrelatively low titres of rubella IgG (less than 77 IU/ml). In total, 14\npatients were positive for rubella IgG, and 6 were negative. All 20 serum\nsamples were negative for measles IgM.\n\nFour of the 5 throat swabs were positive in the diagnostic PCR, and for all\n4 positives, virus isolates were obtained. These samples were collected\nbetween one and 4 days after onset of rash from patients aged 16 or 17\nyears, only one of whom reported having been vaccinated against rubella\nmore than 9 years earlier. Of all 4 PCR-positive samples, nearly complete\nE1 gene sequence data were obtained. Three of the sequences were identical\nfrom Prijedor, and the 4th showed one mutation at position 303 of the E1\ngene and was from Kotor Varos. Phylogenetic analysis attributed the\nsequences to genotype 2B. According to a BLAST analysis, the most similar\npreviously published sequence was an isolate obtained in the United States\n9 years ago (RVi/WA.USA/16.00, GenBank accession number AY968220) with a\nKimura distance of more than 2 per cent.\n\nDiscussion\nThis preliminary report describes a fairly large laboratory-confirmed\noutbreak of rubella affecting mainly unvaccinated or partially vaccinated\nschoolchildren aged 16 to 17 years in 3 contiguous municipalities and one\ndistant region in RS. As the clinical diagnosis of rubella is unreliable,\nthe real number of cases may be somewhat overestimated, as for a few\nsuspected cases, there may have been different reasons for the symptoms\nobserved. This may also explain why some of the sera tested negative for\nrubella IgM. On the other hand, several cases may have remained undetected\ndue to a subclinical course of disease. No cases of rubella were diagnosed\nin BiH in 2008 nor in January and February 2009.\n\nDue to lack of laboratory confirmation, the outbreak was recognised in the\n1st community (Dubica) on 24 Mar 2009. The index case was not identified,\nand, therefore, it is not clear when and from where the virus was\nintroduced. As the most similar published sequence was found in the United\nStates in 2000 and the genetic distance to that isolate was more than 2 per\ncent, the origin of the virus remains obscure.\n\nIn early April 2009, the 1st cases were observed in 2 other municipalities,\nKotor Varos and Prijedor, and in June 2009 in another 2 located 250-400 km\naway. In all of these areas, the epidemic is ongoing. Local epidemiologists\nspeculate that the virus may have spread among teenagers during their stay\nin Mrakovica, Kozara mountain (56 km south from Dubica), which is a very\npopular place for regular school excursions in spring.\n\nTo date, there is no information on occurrence of rubella in pregnant women\nor abortion in connection with the current rubella outbreak. Due to the\nrisk of congenital rubella infection during the 1st trimester of pregnancy,\nwhich can lead to miscarriage, stillbirth, or infants with birth defects,\nrubella is of high public health importance.\n\nBefore the war in 1990, coverage with MMR vaccine was 93.6 per cent in BiH.\nVaccine procurement and implementation of the immunisation programme were\ndifficult during the war, and in the last 2 years of war, MMR vaccine\ncoverage was only 56.8 per cent. The age groups primarily affected in the\ncurrent outbreak were born during the war, and most of them were not even\nvaccinated with the 1st dose of MMR. Surveys done in RS in 1999 and in 2006\nshowed MMR vaccination coverage rates of only 54 per cent and 79 per cent,\nrespectively, among children aged 12 to 23 months [4]. Annual statistics\nfrom PHI RS show varying vaccination coverage rates in recent years (2006:\n1st dose 83 per cent, 2nd dose 83 per cent, 2007: 92 per cent and 93 per\ncent, 2008: 78 per cent and 52 per cent), indicating that other age groups\nmay also contain people at risk for infection.\n\nAs a result of the outbreaks, the Minister of Health and Social Welfare and\nthe PHI RS have initiated immediate actions to improve the coverage with\nthe 2nd dose of MMR vaccine in children under the age of 14 years and have\nalerted the Regional Public Health Institutes and primary health care\nproviders of the emerging outbreak. An action plan to initiate\nsupplementary immunisation of children and young adults with measles and\nrubella vaccine or rubella vaccine is presently being developed with\nsupport from WHO/Europe. The ongoing rubella outbreak also highlights the\nneed for a revised legislation that permits MMR vaccination in children\nolder than 14 years as well as the need to improve the surveillance of\ncongenital rubella syndrome.\n\nReferences\n1.

Most cases (82 per cent, n=282) were observed among\nteenagers born between 1990 and 1994 still attending high school: 66 per\ncent (29/44) in Dubica, 90 per cent (105/117) in Kotor Varos, all of them\nattending the same school, 87 per cent (101/116) in Prijedor and 72 per\ncent (47/65) in East Sarajevo. In Dubica, 44 rubella cases were reported between 24 Mar and 15 May 2009\n(illustrated graphically in the original text) on the basis of a clinical\ncase definition -- that is, acute onset of generalised maculopapular rash,\nbody temperature higher than 37.2 C and arthralgia/arthritis,\nlymphadenopathy, or conjunctivitis. As a result of the outbreaks, the Minister of Health and Social Welfare and\nthe PHI RS have initiated immediate actions to improve the coverage with\nthe 2nd dose of MMR vaccine in children under the age of 14 years and have\nalerted the Regional Public Health Institutes and primary health care\nproviders of the emerging outbreak. \n\nBetween 24 Mar and 31 Jul 2009, 342 clinically diagnosed cases of rubella\nwere notified in 5 municipalities in Republika Srpska (RS), which is one of\n2 governing entities in BiH. At the time of publication of this report, the\noutbreak is ongoing, with circa 4 cases per week. In 1999-2000, a 2-dose\nschedule with the measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine was implemented,\nwith the 1st dose given at the age of 12 months (since 2008 at 11 months)\nand the 2nd dose at the age of 7 years and no later than 14 years. The ongoing rubella outbreak also highlights the\nneed for a revised legislation that permits MMR vaccination in children\nolder than 14 years as well as the need to improve the surveillance of\ncongenital rubella syndrome. \n\nBefore the war in 1990, coverage with MMR vaccine was 93.6 per cent in BiH.\nVaccine procurement and implementation of the immunisation programme were\ndifficult during the war, and in the last 2 years of war, MMR vaccine\ncoverage was only 56.8 per cent. An action plan to initiate\nsupplementary immunisation of children and young adults with measles and\nrubella vaccine or rubella vaccine is presently being developed with\nsupport from WHO/Europe. These samples were collected\nbetween one and 4 days after onset of rash from patients aged 16 or 17\nyears, only one of whom reported having been vaccinated against rubella\nmore than 9 years earlier. This preliminary report describes a fairly large laboratory-confirmed\noutbreak of rubella affecting mainly unvaccinated or partially vaccinated\nschoolchildren aged 16 to 17 years in 3 contiguous municipalities and one\ndistant region in RS. Due to the\nrisk of congenital rubella infection during the 1st trimester of pregnancy,\nwhich can lead to miscarriage, stillbirth, or infants with birth defects,\nrubella is of high public health importance. As the clinical diagnosis of rubella is unreliable,\nthe real number of cases may be somewhat overestimated, as for a few\nsuspected cases, there may have been different reasons for the symptoms\nobserved. In Bosnia\nand Herzegovina, a breakdown in childhood immunisation during a period of\ncivil strife has resulted in a large ongoing outbreak of rubella virus\ninfection. According to a BLAST analysis, the most similar\npreviously published sequence was an isolate obtained in the United States\n9 years ago (RVi/WA.USA/16.00, GenBank accession number AY968220) with a\nKimura distance of more than 2 per cent. Local epidemiologists\nspeculate that the virus may have spread among teenagers during their stay\nin Mrakovica, Kozara mountain (56 km south from Dubica), which is a very\npopular place for regular school excursions in spring. 1st dose 83 per cent, 2nd dose 83 per cent, 2007: 92 per cent and 93 per\ncent, 2008: 78 per cent and 52 per cent), indicating that other age groups\nmay also contain people at risk for infection. One rubella\nIgM-positive patient was negative for rubella IgG, while the other 7 showed\nrelatively low titres of rubella IgG (less than 77 IU/ml). [This outbreak is unusual in that deficiencies in the coverage of measles,\nmumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccination are usually revealed by outbreaks of\nmeasles virus infection, or less commonly mumps virus infection. Five of them had received one dose of rubella\nvaccine, 2 were not vaccinated against rubella, and for one patient no\ninformation on the vaccination status was available. Eight samples were positive for rubella IgM, including 3 from Kotor Varos,\none from Prijedor and 4 from East Sarajevo-Pale, confirming that the\noutbreaks in these regions were caused by rubella. Serum samples were collected from 20 suspected rubella cases (6 from\nDubica, 5 from Kotor Varos, 3 from Prijedor, 4 from East Sarajevo-Pale and\n2 from Trebinje). Outbreak profile: On 28 May 2009, the PHI RS declared a rubella outbreak in\n3 municipalities in the Banja Luka Region: Prijedor, Dubica and Kotor\nVaros. All 20 serum\nsamples were negative for measles IgM.\n\nFour of the 5 throat swabs were positive in the diagnostic PCR, and for all\n4 positives, virus isolates were obtained. In Kotor Varos, Prijedor and East Sarajevo, where the outbreaks are still\nongoing, 117, 116 and 65 rubella cases, respectively, were reported until\nthe end of July 2009. In early April 2009, the 1st cases were observed in 2 other municipalities,\nKotor Varos and Prijedor, and in June 2009 in another 2 located 250-400 km\naway.

Elimination was\ndefined as the interruption of endemic rubella virus transmission in\nall countries of North America, Central America, South America, and\nthe Caribbean for more than 12 months and no occurrence of CRS cases\nattributed to endemic transmission (2). To accomplish this goal, PAHO\ndeveloped a rubella and CRS elimination strategy (3) to 1) introduce\nrubella-containing vaccine (RCV) into routine vaccination programs of\nall countries for children aged 12 months and reach greater than 95\npercent coverage in all municipalities, 2) conduct a one-time mass\ncampaign among adolescents and adults and periodic follow-up\ncampaigns among children aged less than 5 years (4), and 3) integrate\nrubella surveillance with measles surveillance and initiate CRS\nsurveillance. During 1998-2006, confirmed rubella cases decreased 98\npercent (from 135 947 to 2998) in the Americas. However, in 2007,\nrubella outbreaks with a total of 13 014 cases occurred in 3\ncountries (Argentina, Brazil, and Chile), primarily in males not\nincluded in previous vaccination campaigns. This report summarizes\noverall progress toward reaching the 2010 goal of eliminating rubella\nand CRS. With completion of campaigns in Argentina, Brazil, and\nHaiti, all countries will have implemented the recommended PAHO\nstrategy by the end of 2008, with the expectation of reaching the\n2010 rubella and CRS elimination goal.\n\nRoutine Vaccination\n--------------------\nAll 38 countries and territories in the Americas, with the exception\nof Haiti, have introduced measles-mumps-rubella vaccine (MMR) in\ntheir routine immunization schedules. Beginning in 2009, Haiti will\nintroduce measles-rubella (MR) vaccine in its routine immunization\nprogram, after completion of a one-time MR mass vaccination campaign.\n\nIn the Americas, routine MMR vaccination coverage is calculated by\ncountries in one of 3 ways: based on the number of doses administered\n(34 countries), nominal registries (Mexico and Uruguay), and coverage\nsurveys (Canada and the United States). Reported regional routine 1st\ndose MMR (MMR1) coverage at age 12 months was 93-94 percent during\n2003-2007. In 2007, MMR1 coverage of greater than 95 percent was\nreported in 19 (51 percent) countries, 90-94 percent in 7 (19\npercent) countries, 80-89 percent in 7 (19 percent) countries, and\nless than 80 percent in 4 (11 percent) countries. In 2007, of the 20\ncountries and territories reporting administration of a 2nd routine\nMMR dose (MMR2), reported coverage was greater than 95 percent in 3\n(15 percent) countries, 90-94 percent in 3 (15 percent) countries,\n80-89 percent in 8 (40 percent) countries, and less than 80 percent\nin 6 (30 percent) countries.\n\nSupplementary Immunization Activities\n-------------------------------------\nAs part of the PAHO rubella and CRS elimination strategy, 2 different\ntypes of supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) are\nrecommended: one-time SIAs targeting all adolescents and adults, and\nperiodic follow-up SIAs usually targeting children aged 1-4 years.\nOne-time SIAs targeting all adolescents and adults are intended to\nquickly interrupt rubella virus transmission and prevent future CRS\ncases (5). Periodic follow-up campaigns provide a 2nd opportunity to\nvaccinate children who were never vaccinated or who failed to develop\nan immune response.\n\nDuring 1998-2008, approximately 250 million adolescents and adults in\n32 countries and territories were vaccinated against rubella in SIAs.\nThree countries initially only vaccinated females during SIAs: Chile\nvaccinated females aged 10-29 years in 1999, Brazil vaccinated\nfemales aged 12-39 years during 2001-2002, and Argentina vaccinated\nfemales aged 18-39 years in 2006. After those SIAs, transmission and\noutbreaks of rubella mainly occurred among adolescent and adult males\nin the 3 countries. Subsequent SIAs were conducted during 2007 and\n2008 in Chile (1.3 million males aged 19-29 years in 2007), Brazil\n(70 million males and females aged 20-39 years and 12-39 years in 5\nselected states in 2008), and Argentina (6.5 million males aged 16-39\nyears in 2008). Aruba and Netherlands Antilles, Canada, the French\ndepartments (French Guiana, Guadeloupe, and Martinique), Panama, the\nUnited States, and Uruguay introduced RCV in the routine childhood\nschedule greater than 20 years ago, thus protecting large cohorts of\nthe adult population. As a result, these countries decided not to\nimplement adolescent and adult SIAs. All Latin American and Caribbean\ncountries that have introduced RCV since 1995 have implemented at\nleast one follow-up campaign.\n\nSurveillance Activities\n------------------------\nCase-based measles and rubella surveillance is carried out in all\ncountries of the Americas and reported weekly to the regional level.\nAll public and private health-care providers are required to report\nsuspected measles and rubella cases; however, reporting is\nincomplete, particularly in the private sector. Since 1996, serum\nspecimens from patients with suspected measles testing negative for\nmeasles immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibody have been tested for\nrubella-specific IgM antibody. In 1999, regional rubella surveillance\nwas integrated with existing case-based measles surveillance in the\nPAHO regional measles and rubella laboratory network of 21 national\nand 124 sub-national laboratories. Within the integrated measles and\nrubella surveillance system, measles or rubella cases are counted as\nsuspected when a health-care worker suspects that a patient has\nmeasles or rubella infection. Rubella cases are counted as confirmed\nwhen a patient has laboratory-confirmed rubella (IgM positive) or an\ninfection that meets the clinical case definition and is linked\nepidemiologically to a laboratory-confirmed case. A suspected CRS\ncase is defined in any infant whose mother had laboratory-confirmed\nrubella infection during pregnancy or in any infant who has\ncongenital anomalies compatible with CRS. A confirmed CRS case is\ndefined as infection in a child with compatible birth defects and\ndocumented laboratory evidence of rubella infection during the 1st\nyear of life (6).\n\nDuring 1998-2006, confirmed rubella cases decreased 98 percent, from\n135 947 to 2998 (data illustrated by a figure in the original text).\nA shift in distribution and increase in cases in 2007 resulted from\noutbreaks, particularly among males, in Argentina (96 cases), Brazil\n(8683 cases), and Chile (4235 cases), countries that initially\nvaccinated only females in rubella SIAs. During 1 Jan-20 Sep 2008, a\ntotal of 2039 confirmed rubella cases were reported in the PAHO\nregion, of which Argentina, Brazil, and Chile accounted for 98\npercent. In response to these outbreaks, countries intensified\nsurveillance activities and vaccination interventions by conducting\nSIAs among adolescents and adults. Countries that have completed SIAs\nfor all adolescents and adults have not reported any endemic rubella\ncases [These data are tabulated in the original text.].\n\nIn 2007, 975 suspected CRS cases were reported in the 34 countries\nwith CRS surveillance; 4 countries (Brazil, Chile, Colombia, and\nPeru) accounted for 947 (97 percent) of these cases. 19 cases were\nconfirmed by detection of rubella IgM antibody, 17 from Brazil and 2\nfrom Peru. During 1 Jan-20 Sep 2008, confirmed CRS cases were\nreported in Argentina (one), Brazil (3), and Chile (2).\n\nDuring 2003-2007, wild-type rubella viruses of genotypes 1C and 2B\nwere endemic in the Americas. Viruses of genotypes 1E, 1G, 1j, and 2B\nhave been linked to imported cases.\n\nPAHO recommends the use of performance indicators to measure measles\nand rubella surveillance quality. The current standardized\nsurveillance indicators and targets recommended in countries of the\nAmericas to monitor progress toward rubella elimination include: 1)\nweekly notification by 80 percent of reporting units (i.e., health\nclinics, usually at least one for each municipality), 2) greater than\n80 percent of suspected measles/rubella cases investigated\nadequately, 3) 2 or more suspected cases of measles or rubella per\n100 000 persons detected and reported (to monitor the sensitivity of\nthe surveillance) and 4) greater than 80 percent of suspected\nmeasles/rubella cases with serologic testing. In 2007, among 34\nreporting countries and territories in the region, these respective\ntargets were met by 88 percent, 72 percent, 71 percent, and 85\npercent of countries. Aruba and Netherlands Antilles, Canada, the\nFrench departments, and the United States do not report indicator\ndata regularly.\n\nBeginning in 2009, 2 additional indicators and targets will be\nmonitored by countries and PAHO: 1) greater than 80 percent of\nconfirmed cases are accompanied by follow-up of contacts for 30 days\n(to monitor occurrence of secondary cases); and 2) greater than 80\npercent of outbreaks have adequate specimens collected for virus\ndetection and isolation.\n\n[Reported by: C Castillo-Solorzano, MD, C Marsigli, MPH, P Bravo\nAlcantara, MPH, JK Andrus, MD, AMB Filippis, PhD, MC Danovaro-\nHolliday, MD, C Ruiz Matus, MD, Comprehensive Family Immunization\nProject, Pan American Health Organization, Washington, DC.

Countries have\ndemonstrated progress toward the rubella and CRS elimination goal;\nhowever, outbreaks have occurred, primarily among males, in countries\nthat only vaccinated females during mass campaigns. By implementing\nthe comprehensive strategy and including males in SIAs, countries are\nable to limit or prevent future outbreaks. By the end of 2008, all\ncountries and territories of the Americas will have implemented the\nPAHO-recommended vaccination strategies.\n\nIn 2005, the United States was the 1st country in the Americas to\ndeclare it had eliminated endemic rubella virus transmission (7). In\naccordance with the PAHO biennial work plan, 20 additional countries\nare expected to begin the process of verifying interruption of\nrubella virus transmission in 2009. To prepare for verification of\nelimination of rubella and CRS in the Americas, PAHO is developing a\nstrategic plan to guide countries on how to document elimination. In\naddition, in 2007, the 27th Pan American Sanitary Conference approved\na resolution that defined the final steps for reaching the rubella\nelimination goal by 2010, including formation of national commissions\nto compile and analyze data and an international committee to\ndocument progress toward interrupting transmission (8).\n\nAs the final stage of rubella elimination approaches, several\nchallenges remain, including the continued risk for rubella\nimportations and limited collection of specimens for virus detection\nand isolation. To confront the challenges, PAHO has been working with\ncountries to 1) maintain high population immunity through high\nroutine vaccination coverage and completion of high-quality SIAs; 2)\nmaintain high-quality integrated measles-rubella surveillance and CRS\nsurveillance, including distributing practical field guides,\nmonitoring confirmed CRS cases for virus excretion with at least 2\nconsecutive negative specimens, and improving the participation of\nclinicians in the private sector in surveillance activities; 3)\nstrengthen the WHO regional measles and rubella laboratory network in\nthe Americas, including emphasis on obtaining specimens for\ngenotyping; and 4) increase training opportunities for health workers\nand interdisciplinary teams of epidemiologists, virologists, and\nclinicians.\n\nReferences\n--------\n(1) Pan American Health Organization.

To accomplish this goal, PAHO\ndeveloped a rubella and CRS elimination strategy (3) to 1) introduce\nrubella-containing vaccine (RCV) into routine vaccination programs of\nall countries for children aged 12 months and reach greater than 95\npercent coverage in all municipalities, 2) conduct a one-time mass\ncampaign among adolescents and adults and periodic follow-up\ncampaigns among children aged less than 5 years (4), and 3) integrate\nrubella surveillance with measles surveillance and initiate CRS\nsurveillance. In 2007, of the 20\ncountries and territories reporting administration of a 2nd routine\nMMR dose (MMR2), reported coverage was greater than 95 percent in 3\n(15 percent) countries, 90-94 percent in 3 (15 percent) countries,\n80-89 percent in 8 (40 percent) countries, and less than 80 percent\nin 6 (30 percent) countries. Beginning in 2009, 2 additional indicators and targets will be\nmonitored by countries and PAHO: 1) greater than 80 percent of\nconfirmed cases are accompanied by follow-up of contacts for 30 days\n(to monitor occurrence of secondary cases); and 2) greater than 80\npercent of outbreaks have adequate specimens collected for virus\ndetection and isolation.\n\n In\naddition, in 2007, the 27th Pan American Sanitary Conference approved\na resolution that defined the final steps for reaching the rubella\nelimination goal by 2010, including formation of national commissions\nto compile and analyze data and an international committee to\ndocument progress toward interrupting transmission (8).\n\n A ProMED-mail post\n<http://www.promedmail.org>\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\n<http://www.isid.org>\n\nDate: Fri 31 Oct 2008\n The groups of territories\ninclude 3 French departments (French Guiana, Guadeloupe, and\nMartinique), the autonomous region of the Kingdom of the Netherlands\n(Aruba and Netherlands Antilles), and 6 United Kingdom overseas\nterritories (Anguilla, Bermuda, British Virgin Islands, Cayman\nIslands, Montserrat, and Turks and Caicos Islands). In 2007, MMR1 coverage of greater than 95 percent was\nreported in 19 (51 percent) countries, 90-94 percent in 7 (19\npercent) countries, 80-89 percent in 7 (19 percent) countries, and\nless than 80 percent in 4 (11 percent) countries. Subsequent SIAs were conducted during 2007 and\n2008 in Chile (1.3 million males aged 19-29 years in 2007), Brazil\n(70 million males and females aged 20-39 years and 12-39 years in 5\nselected states in 2008), and Argentina (6.5 million males aged 16-39\nyears in 2008). Elimination was\ndefined as the interruption of endemic rubella virus transmission in\nall countries of North America, Central America, South America, and\nthe Caribbean for more than 12 months and no occurrence of CRS cases\nattributed to endemic transmission (2). Within the integrated measles and\nrubella surveillance system, measles or rubella cases are counted as\nsuspected when a health-care worker suspects that a patient has\nmeasles or rubella infection. Aruba and Netherlands Antilles, Canada, the French\ndepartments (French Guiana, Guadeloupe, and Martinique), Panama, the\nUnited States, and Uruguay introduced RCV in the routine childhood\nschedule greater than 20 years ago, thus protecting large cohorts of\nthe adult population. A shift in distribution and increase in cases in 2007 resulted from\noutbreaks, particularly among males, in Argentina (96 cases), Brazil\n(8683 cases), and Chile (4235 cases), countries that initially\nvaccinated only females in rubella SIAs. In 2007, among 34\nreporting countries and territories in the region, these respective\ntargets were met by 88 percent, 72 percent, 71 percent, and 85\npercent of countries. In 1999, regional rubella surveillance\nwas integrated with existing case-based measles surveillance in the\nPAHO regional measles and rubella laboratory network of 21 national\nand 124 sub-national laboratories. Rubella cases are counted as confirmed\nwhen a patient has laboratory-confirmed rubella (IgM positive) or an\ninfection that meets the clinical case definition and is linked\nepidemiologically to a laboratory-confirmed case. Countries have\ndemonstrated progress toward the rubella and CRS elimination goal;\nhowever, outbreaks have occurred, primarily among males, in countries\nthat only vaccinated females during mass campaigns. However, in 2007,\nrubella outbreaks with a total of 13 014 cases occurred in 3\ncountries (Argentina, Brazil, and Chile), primarily in males not\nincluded in previous vaccination campaigns. Three countries initially only vaccinated females during SIAs: Chile\nvaccinated females aged 10-29 years in 1999, Brazil vaccinated\nfemales aged 12-39 years during 2001-2002, and Argentina vaccinated\nfemales aged 18-39 years in 2006. As part of the PAHO rubella and CRS elimination strategy, 2 different\ntypes of supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) are\nrecommended: one-time SIAs targeting all adolescents and adults, and\nperiodic follow-up SIAs usually targeting children aged 1-4 years. As the final stage of rubella elimination approaches, several\nchallenges remain, including the continued risk for rubella\nimportations and limited collection of specimens for virus detection\nand isolation.

With completion of campaigns in Argentina, Brazil, and\nHaiti, all countries will have implemented the recommended PAHO\nstrategy by the end of 2008, with the expectation of reaching the\n2010 rubella and CRS elimination goal. In\naccordance with the PAHO biennial work plan, 20 additional countries\nare expected to begin the process of verifying interruption of\nrubella virus transmission in 2009. In the Americas, routine MMR vaccination coverage is calculated by\ncountries in one of 3 ways: based on the number of doses administered\n(34 countries), nominal registries (Mexico and Uruguay), and coverage\nsurveys (Canada and the United States). Since 1996, serum\nspecimens from patients with suspected measles testing negative for\nmeasles immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibody have been tested for\nrubella-specific IgM antibody. A suspected CRS\ncase is defined in any infant whose mother had laboratory-confirmed\nrubella infection during pregnancy or in any infant who has\ncongenital anomalies compatible with CRS. A confirmed CRS case is\ndefined as infection in a child with compatible birth defects and\ndocumented laboratory evidence of rubella infection during the 1st\nyear of life (6).
