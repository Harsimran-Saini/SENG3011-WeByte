Secretary-General Kofi Annan said in the report. 'In\nshort, AIDS is an exceptional problem which demands an exceptional\nresponse.' More than 120 delegates are scheduled to address the all-day\nmeeting, many of them ministers or their deputies, to assess progress since\na 2001 special U.N. General Assembly session on HIV/AIDS.\nPrograms have succeeded in Brazil, which has the most successful AIDS\nprogram among developing nations. Cambodia and Thailand have shown\nsubstantial progress and several African nations as well as the Bahamas\nhave slowed the rate of infection, says the report Annan submitted to\ndelegates.\nBut only 12 percent of those who need treatment are receiving it. Effective\nprevention programs, counseling and testing services are the exception to\nthe rule and drugs still cost too much, the report said. And despite the\nmany programs and money spent, the epidemic has not been reversed. The 4.9\nmillion infections and 3.1 million AIDS deaths in 2004 were the highest to\ndate, Annan said. Some of the worst predictions have come to pass. Nearly\nhalf of the estimated 39.4 million people living with HIV, the virus that\ncauses AIDS, are women and girls, whether married or single, promiscuous or\nfaithful.\n'The trend is that more young women are being infected than young men,'\nThoraya Obeid, the head of the U.N. Population Fund, told a news conference\non Wed 1 Jun 2006. 'If they are married, they can't abstain. They are\nfaithful but the husband is not faithful,' Obeid said. Women, she said,\nneed information, including how to use a female condom to protect themselves.\nMen and women between 15 and 24 years old are the hardest hit by the\npandemic. Obeid released a survey done by young people in a dozen\ncountries, most of whom said they had no voice in their nation's AIDS\npolicies. Others said programs needed to be comprehensive -- abstinence and\nsex education, young people talking to other adolescents as well as to\nintravenous drug users.\nThe world's largest donor for fighting AIDS is the United States, which\nspent $2.4 billion last year. But it is being pressured by conservative\nreligious groups toward abstinence-only programs and away from vulnerable\ngroups like prostitutes, homosexuals and drug addicts. Included in the U.S.\ncontribution is some $450 million, or 1/3 of the budget of the Global Fund\nto Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria -- a powerful independent\norganization of governments, business and private groups, first proposed by\nAnnan 4 years ago. The new head of the group's policy and strategy\ncommittee is Randall Tobias, who runs the Bush administration's AIDS\nprogram. Some officials are worried that the fund will adopt U.S.\npositions, but others say such fears are groundless.\nWorldwide, the U.N. report says, some $8 billion will be available in 2005\nto implement programs in 135 low- and middle-income countries, a dramatic\n23 percent increase over the previous year.

The report, compiled by MRC's Burden of\nDisease Research Unit, shows that mortality rates and causes of death\ndiffer in the country's 9 provinces but that HIV/AIDS was the leading cause\nof death overall. HIV/AIDS was the leading cause of death in every province\nexcept the Western Cape.\nDebbie Bradshaw, co-author of the report and director of the disease unit,\nsaid the study employed several data-collection methods, including death\nnotification forms and census and household surveys.\nThe report says that the country is dealing with a 'quadruple burden of\ndisease,' with communicable diseases, non-communicable diseases, injuries\nand HIV/AIDS playing large roles in mortality, according to the Star newspaper.\nAccording to official statistics, South Africa has the highest number of\nHIV-positive residents of any country worldwide. UN AIDS figures released\nin July 2004 showed that about 5.3 million HIV-positive people live in\nSouth Africa, with a possible range of between 4.5 million and 6.2 million.\nRecommendations\n---------------\n'The high death rate due to HIV/AIDS highlights the urgency to accelerate\nthe implementation of a comprehensive plan for the treatment and prevention\nof HIV and AIDS,' the report says. The authors recommend that provinces\nimprove access to health care services; promote active, healthy lifestyles;\nand ensure 'basic needs' such as access to clean water and sanitation are\nmet, according to the Star. The report, which is the first to provide\nspecific causes of death for each province, also says the mortality\ninformation can help individual provinces respond to their particular\nhealth needs. Bradshaw said the report could serve as 'an important\nbenchmark' against which to monitor progress and encouraged local officials\nto identify issues that need to be addressed in their areas.\nReaction\n--------\nSouth Africa's National Association of People Living with HIV/AIDS said it\n'was not surprised at the high HIV/AIDS mortality rate,' according to the\nStar newspaper. HIV/AIDS is a 'multifaceted problem' that requires\nassistance from the government and business community to fight poverty and\nprovide antiretroviral drugs, according to NAPWA spokesperson Thanduxolo Doro.\nMark Heywood, a spokesperson for the South African HIV/AIDS treatment\nadvocacy group Treatment Action Campaign, said, 'These figures are just\ngoing to get worse and worse,' adding, 'The deaths in 2000 were at the\nbeginning of a period of rapid HIV infection. More people have been\ninfected since then, and more people are going to be dying.'\nHowever, Letitia Rispel, director of the health department in Gauteng\nprovince, said programs implemented since 2000 might have improved the\nsituation. 'These include the prevention of mother-to-child treatment,\nwellness programs and the antiretroviral rollout program,' she said,\nadding, 'Only once we have taken these into account will we get a clear\npicture.'

'HIV/AIDS remains one of the\nbiggest challenges in the mining industry,' said Mlambo-Ngcuka, adding that\nthere was a general commitment from the industry to deal with the pandemic.\nMines in South Africa employ more than 500 000 workers, or 4.3 percent of\nthe country's total workforce, and the sector accounts for about 1/3 of all\nexports.\nA new report by the Medical Research Council showed that AIDS was the\nnumber-one killer in South Africa, with one in 3 people dying from the\ndisease. On Thursday, Mlambo-Ngcuka said mining companies had made\ncommitments to introduce measures on preventing and monitoring HIV/AIDS as\nwell as treatment programmes.

President Thabo Mbeki's government\nbegan rolling out free antiretrovirals in November 2003, under pressure\nfrom AIDS activists who went to court to win an order against the\ngovernment. At least 42 000 South Africans are receiving free\nantiretrovirals under the government's rollout program, but the key AIDS\nlobby group, the Treatment Action Campaign, is urging the government to\nspeed up the ARV rollout to make them available to 200 000 people by 2006.\n******\n[4]\nDate: Sat 21 May 2005\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: Xinhua News Agency, Tue 17 May 2005 [edited]\n<http://www.rednova.com/news/health/150586/aids_becomes_leading_killer_in_south_africa/>\n\nAIDS Becomes Leading Killer in South Africa\n-------------------------------------------\nSouth Africa's biggest killer is HIV/AIDS, which causes 1 in 3 deaths, the\nMedical Research Council (MRC) said in a report on cause-specific death\nrates for each of the 9 provinces issued here on Tue 17 May 2005. Estimates\nof HIV/AIDS mortality in Gauteng province, the economic center in the\ncountry, accounted for 33 percent of all deaths in 2000 -- one in 3 --\ncompared with 30 percent of all deaths nationwide, according to the report.\nCompiled by the MRC's Burden of Disease Research Unit, the report shows\nthat overall mortality rates and causes of death differ in the provinces,\nbut that HIV/AIDS is the leading killer across the board. 'These figures\nare just going to get worse and worse,' Mark Heywood, spokesperson for the\nTreatment Action Campaign, said on Mon 16 May 2005.\nThe findings relating to HIV/AIDS deaths were consistent with other\navailable reports. The deaths in 2000 were at the beginning of a period of\nrapid HIV infection. More people have been infected since then and more\npeople are going to be dying.\nBut Dr. Letitia Rispel, head of department for the Gauteng Health\nDepartment, said it would be difficult to say what the situation would be\nnow without taking programs implemented since 2000 into account. 'These\ninclude the prevention of mother-to-child treatment [transmission?],\nwellness programs and the antiretroviral rollout program. Only once we have\ntaken these into account will we get a clear picture, ' he added.\nThe MRC report, which also looks at other causes of deaths in the various\nprovinces, shows that these varied from province to province. For women in\nGauteng, the main causes of death, excluding HIV/AIDS, are stroke, lower\nrespiratory tract infections, homicide, ischaemic heart disease, road\naccidents, TB, hypertensive heart disease, diarrhoeal diseases, septicemia\nand diabetes mellitus. For men, the 10 leading causes of death, excluding\nHIV/AIDS, are homicide and road traffic accidents, ischaemic heart disease,\nTB, lower respiratory infections, stroke, suicide, diarrhoeal diseases,\ndiabetes and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.\nThis differs from the 10 leading causes of death for Western Cape men. For\nthose, the 10 leading causes of death are homicide, HIV/AIDS, traffic\naccidents, TB, heart disease and stroke, cancer of the upper respiratory\ntract or lungs, suicide, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and lower\nrespiratory infections. For women in the Western Cape the main causes of\ndeath are HIV/ AIDS, TB, heart disease, stroke, traffic accidents,\nhomicide, diabetes, diarrhoeal diseases, breast cancer and lower\nrespiratory infections. And according to the report, Western Cape residents\nhave the highest life expectancy in the country, probably due to a\nrelatively low HIV infection rate.\n******\n[5]\nDate: Sat 21 May 2005\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: Statistics South Africa, 2002, Sat 21 May 2005 [edited]\n<http://www.mrc.ac.za/researchreports/statssa.htm>\n\n[The MRC Report discussed in the preceding reports is contained in the\ndocument referred to below.

A screening camp was initially established at Taluka's main hospital. Later, screening was expanded to other health facilities including selected Rural Health Centers (RHCs) and Basic Health Units (BHUs). HIV rapid test kits that were initially used were replaced with pre-qualified WHO test kits.\n\nFrom 25 Apr through 28 Jun 2019, a total of 30 192 people have been screened for HIV, of which 876 were found positive. 82% (719/876) of these were below the age of 15 years. During the screening, several risk factors were identified, including: unsafe intravenous injections during medical procedures; unsafe child delivery practices; unsafe practices at blood banks; poorly implemented infection control programs; and improper collection, storage, segregation, and disposal of hospital waste.\n\nThis is the 4th reported outbreak of HIV in Larkana district since 2003. The 1st outbreak in 2003, was among people who inject drugs (PWID), the 2nd was among 12 pediatric patients in a pediatric hospital in 2016, and the 3rd, also in 2016, was among 206 patients in a dialysis unit.\n\nPrior to this event, Larkana district had only one antiretroviral [ARV] therapy (ART) clinic, which was for adults exclusively (2568 registered cases by May 2019).\n\nPublic health response\n----------------------\nThe response to the event has been led by the provincial Department of Health (DOH) and the Sindh AIDS Control Program (SACP). The response has been supported by UN partners, the Pakistan Field Epidemiology & Laboratory Training Program (FELTP), Aga Khan University, and other partners.\n\nA new HIV/AIDS ART Treatment Center for children has been established at Shaikh Zaid Children Hospital. Unauthorized laboratories, blood banks, and clinics have been closed.\n\nA mission led by the Federal Ministry of Health (MOH) and WHO, supported by other UN partners and academia has been conducted through the first half of June. The objectives were to identify sources and chains of transmission of HIV, map the high-risk areas, and identify gaps in HIV diagnosis, care and treatment.\n\nWHO risk assessment\n-------------------\nPakistan is one of the countries in the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region where new HIV infections are increasing at an alarming level since 1987 [1]. The current HIV epidemic in Pakistan is defined as a concentrated epidemic. Although the overall prevalence is still less than 1% in the adult population, the latest estimate (2017) of people living with HIV (PLHIV) was 150 000 [2] . In 2018, 21 000 new PLHIV cases were recorded.\n\nRegarding this event, the overall risk of disease spread within Larkana district is high due to:\n- non-availability of sufficient information to determine the complete extent and magnitude of the event;\n- number of cases among children (mostly under 5 years age group);\n- date/period of exposure of HIV to the cases is unknown;\n- lack of information regarding all possible sources of exposure;\n- insufficient treatment options due to lack of appropriate ARV drugs;\n- history of repeated HIV outbreaks in the same geographical area;\n\nFurther epidemiological investigations will help determine the magnitude of the event, and whether this event is acute and isolated in nature, or a longer duration situation with these cases (accidentally diagnosed) representing the tip of the iceberg of a larger epidemic.\n\nThe risk at regional and global levels is considered very low because the mode of transmission of HIV is very specific and limited to mother to child transmission, contact with contaminated blood through contaminated syringes/other surgical instruments, blood transfusion, or sexual contact with PLHIV. The situation is being closely monitored, and the risk will be re-assessed according to the results of the preliminary investigation.\n\nWHO advice\n----------\nThis event highlights the importance of using high-impact interventions to reduce vulnerability and prevent transmission mainly in healthcare settings. It also takes into consideration the prevention of sexual transmission in high risk groups, transmission through injecting drug use, and mother-to-child transmission.\n\nWHO recommends that after 18 months of age, 3 different assays may be required to establish the diagnosis of HIV infection. However, infants less than 18 months of age who are born to HIV infected mother should be diagnosed through nucleic acid testing (NAT) [3].\n\nWHO stresses the importance of immediately linking all those diagnosed with HIV infection to antiretroviral treatment (ART), where the test should be repeated to rule out errors in diagnosis (in case 2nd test is negative [4]) and, thereafter, ART should be started without any delay.\n\n1.

WHO\n*************************************\n \n\nWHO risk assessment\n During the screening, several risk factors were identified, including: unsafe intravenous injections during medical procedures; unsafe child delivery practices; unsafe practices at blood banks; poorly implemented infection control programs; and improper collection, storage, segregation, and disposal of hospital waste. The risk at regional and global levels is considered very low because the mode of transmission of HIV is very specific and limited to mother to child transmission, contact with contaminated blood through contaminated syringes/other surgical instruments, blood transfusion, or sexual contact with PLHIV. \n\nPublic health response\n \n\nWHO advice\n It also takes into consideration the prevention of sexual transmission in high risk groups, transmission through injecting drug use, and mother-to-child transmission. \n\nWHO recommends that after 18 months of age, 3 different assays may be required to establish the diagnosis of HIV infection. The 1st outbreak in 2003, was among people who inject drugs (PWID), the 2nd was among 12 pediatric patients in a pediatric hospital in 2016, and the 3rd, also in 2016, was among 206 patients in a dialysis unit.

The team will work closely with the Ministry of Health and other partners.\n\nMoreover, the Field Epidemiology and Disease Surveillance Division (FEDSD) of NIH has issued an advisory regarding the prevention and control of HIV. The aim of the advisory is to alert public health authorities across Pakistan to take necessary steps for prevention and control of HIV and AIDS and other sexually transmitted infections propagated by unsafe equipment and syringes as well as blood transfusion.\n\nAccording to the advisory, more than 700 HIV cases have thus far been detected in Sindh, highlighting gross inadequacies in the healthcare system, especially with regard to infection control practices. 'The infection is disproportionately affecting children and while scientific investigations are currently underway to ascertain the causative factors, the involvement of young kids born to HIV-negative mothers points to a significant role being played by poor infection prevention and control practices, injection malpractices, and reuse of contaminated syringes,' the Executive Director of NIH Dr Aamer Ikram has flagged in his covering letter to the advisory.\n\nThe advisory states that HIV can be transmitted from person to person through unprotected sexual intercourse with an infected partner; from contaminated needles, syringes, and other sharp injecting instruments; from an infected mother to her infant during pregnancy, childbirth and through feeding; and from transfusion of HIV-infected blood and blood products. Once in the bloodstream, the retrovirus infects CD4 cells, resulting in progressive deterioration of the immune system and leading to HIV. A person is said to have AIDS when the infection progresses, dropping the CD4 count to below 200. On average, the time from HIV infection to clinical AIDS is 8 to 10 years though AIDS may manifest in less than two years or be delayed in onset beyond 10 years.\n\nThe comprehensive advisory provides definition of confirmed HIV-infected and AIDS cases, as well as ways for prompt diagnosis and effective management and prevention of HIV and AIDS. What protocols to follow for disease surveillance and notification, and risk communication and health education are also listed in the advisory.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[2] Risk of HIV spread\nDate: Sun 2 Jun 2019\nSource: The News International (Pakistan) [edited]\nhttps://www.thenews.com.pk/latest/479272-exclusive-the-global-fund-fears-possible-spread-of-hiv-into-general-population-in-pakistan\n\n\nThe Global Fund to fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria [Sat 1 Jun 2019] said that it is worried about a possible spread of HIV into general population in Pakistan as recent outbreak in Ratodero area of Larkana (and many outbreaks before) is just a symptom of a deeper crisis.\n\n'The spread of HIV in Pakistan is worrying. Long time thought to be contained in high risk groups, notably injecting drug users, it is now on the verge of spilling into the general population. Larkana (and the many outbreaks before in Pakistan) is just a symptom of a deeper crisis. There is no reason for panic, but also no justification for denial,' said Dr Werner Buehler, Senior Fund Portfolio Manager at the Global Fund in Geneva in response to written queries from The News International.\n\nResponding to queries from The News regarding HIV/AIDS situation in Pakistan and a possible procurement of antiretroviral medicines for HIV infected children in Ratodero area of Pakistan, the Global Fund official confirmed that the fund has started procurement of pediatric antiretroviral therapy (ART/ARVs) medicines for the children infected with HIV in Ratodero area of Larkana, Sindh 'through our Rapid Supply Mechanism, after consultation with WHO on the most appropriate regimens.'\n\n'We have indeed started procuring paediatric ARV, through our Rapid Supply Mechanism, after consultation with WHO on the most appropriate regimens,' Dr Werner Buehler said in his email to this scribe.\n\nOver 742 people including 605 children have so far been tested positive for HIV in Ratodero area of Larkana since [25 Apr 2019], officials of Sindh AIDS Control Program (SACP) said, adding that majority of the children (411) were of 2 to 5 years of age while 57 were of less than one year's age.\n\nFollowing reports of deaths of some children due to HIV/AIDS related co-infections in the Ratodero area of Larkana, World Health Organization (WHO) officials in Pakistan had said that they had requested the Global fund to provide pediatric ART medicines for around 500 children under the age of five years who could not take drug in tablet forms.\n\nSACP Program Manager Dr Sikandar Memon said at the moment, they already had 420 infected with HIV in Sindh who were registered with them and getting ART medicines regularly that were being provided by the Global Fund and added that also started giving ARTs to around 190 newly diagnosed children at Paediatric HIV treatment center in Larkana.\n\nThe Global Fund official maintained that they are providing treatment for roughly 15 000 people living with HIV in Pakistan, saying: 'We have seen massive increases of numbers of people on ART in the past 4-5 years, mostly due to revised treatment guidelines and expanded and decentralized testing in the drug user community. This is a good development, as individuals on ART can no longer spread the virus and can lead healthy and normal lives.'\n\n'But it has financial consequences,' said Dr Buehler. 'The Global Fund is still the only funding source for ART in Pakistan. There is an urgent need for the Government (of Pakistan) to plan and pay for domestic drug procurement. There is also a need to decentralize HIV service delivery (and testing) as much as possible. Only then can we overcome one of the biggest obstacles to treatment, that is, distance,' he added.\n\nDr Werner Buehler maintained that the Global Fund will continue to support Pakistan's fight against HIV for the foreseeable future. 'We try our best to prevent more human suffering, but we do realize that the roughly USD 12 million the Fund spends on HIV in Pakistan per year may not be enough at this stage. We hope that Government finds the resources to intensify the fight.'\n\nThe Global fund official said media and independent journalism have a major role to play in raising general awareness over the nature of HIV. That supposes that more and more journalists acquire technical knowledge about the epidemic, its causes, its treatment, its prevention, in order to comment critically on the situation and to repeat the right messages at every opportunity.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[3] Activities of WHO mission on HIV in Pakistan\nDate: Fri 31 May 2019\nSource: Dawn [edited]\nhttps://www.dawn.com/news/1485543\n\n\nThe team of World Health Organisation that arrived in the country on [Tue 28 May 2019] to probe reasons behind the spread of HIV and investigate from where the virus had travelled to the area, visited the children's treatment centre for HIV/AIDS in Chandka Medical College children's hospital on [Thu 30 May 2019] and inquired the staff about how they handled the patients.\n\nThe team asked project manager of Sindh AIDS Control Programme who accompanied them about the facilities and the protocol for treating AIDS patients.

The participants in the meeting exchanged views and discussed certain proposals as to how best to handle the situation. The delegation also handed over AIDS medicines to the minister.\n\nThe minister said that since the outbreak of the virus, the health department had set up blood screening camps in and around Ratodero to test the population and opened treatment centers in hospitals. She termed the situation a 'challenge' and expressed optimism about overcoming it in near future.\n\nThe minister accompanied by health officials later visited blood screening centre in Ratodero taluka hospital where she told reporters that the WHO delegates were working on different diseases and they would provide the Sindh government a detailed study report on HIV/AIDS.\n\nShe said that both Global Fund and Sindh government were financially contributing towards efforts to combat the virus and 'we are planning to systematically and scientifically spend the funds.' She claimed a 'drop' in the virus' intensity and said that people were very afraid of the virus.\n\nShe said that so far 712 persons had been diagnosed as HIV positive at the blood screening centre at Ratodero and announced that WHO and other stakeholders would help Sindh government in establishing good treatment centers.\n\nShe said that during their stay the foreign delegates would interact with different communities, visit blood screening camps and treatment centers and compile a report with the findings and reasons which led to the virus' spread.\n\nSecretary for health Dr Saeed Ahmed Magnejo, Larkana commissioner Saleem Raza Khuhro, project manager of Sindh AIDS Control Programme Dr Sikandar Memon, deputy commissioner, representatives of PPHI, Expanded Programme of Immunisation, and district health officer attended the meeting.\n\nA total of 15, 11 among them children, tested positive for HIV during ongoing blood screening test at Ratodero taluka hospital where 286 persons were screened on [Thu 30 May 2019].

It was expanded on 8 May 2019, with additional health workers being deployed. Testing is ongoing.\n\nSo far more than 600 HIV cases have been identified. The majority are among children and young people: more than half those affected are children under the age of 5. This poses a particular challenge. Prior to this outbreak, there were just over 1200 children diagnosed with HIV and receiving antiretroviral treatment in the whole of Pakistan.\n\nOn 16 May 2019 local authorities established a new antiretroviral treatment clinic for children in Larkana.\n\nKey tasks for the WHO-led team will include: ascertaining the source of the outbreak and controlling it; providing technical expertise, particularly in the areas of HIV testing, paediatric HIV treatment and family counselling; and ensuring adequate supplies of rapid diagnostic tests and antiretroviral medicines for both adults and children, as well as single-use needles and syringes.\n\nThe WHO mission will include experts in emergency response management, epidemiology, HIV clinical care, and infection prevention and control from WHO as well as the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN). The team will work closely with the Ministry and partners, including the Aga Khan University, Pakistan's Field Epidemiology & Laboratory Training Program (FELTP), UNAIDS, and UNICEF in Larkana.\n\nFor more information contact:\nMs Maryam Yunus\nCommunications Officer\nWHO Country Office, Pakistan\n<yunusm@who.int>\n\nDr Safdar Kamal Pasha\nNational Programme Officer, HIV/AIDS\nWHO Country Office, Pakistan\n<mpasha@who.int>\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[On 25 Apr 2019, the local administration in Larkana, Sindh province in Pakistan was alerted following diagnosis of 13 HIV positive cases among children in Ratodero taluka of Larkana. A screening camp was established at the taluka's (governing unit) main hospital. Initial HIV testing was done using HIV rapid test kits, which were not WHO pre-qualified. Later screening was expanded to other health facilities at the lower level of health care delivery, including selected Rural Health Centres (RHCs) and Basic Health Units (BHUs). As of 3 Jun 2019, 25 856 people were screened of which 742 (2.9 percent) were found to be HIV positive. Most of the diagnosed cases are children (607, 81 percent), mostly under 5-year-old with an overall very high proportion of children among people tested (https://www.nacp.gov.pk/).\n\nThis the 4th reported HIV outbreak in Larkana district since 2003. Risk factors identified were unsafe IV injections during medical practice, unsafe delivery practices, unhygienic control measures, unsafe practices at blood banks, poorly implemented harm reduction programmes, and improper hospital waste management.\n\nThe current HIV epidemic in Pakistan is defined as a concentrated epidemic (http://www.emro.who.int/pak/programmes/hiv-aids.html). the epidemic is expanding among injecting drug users, with an estimated prevalence of 20 percent, and their sexual contacts, including male and transgender hijra sex workers, with rates of 2 percent-3 percent and 4 percent, respectively.\n\nLike many developing countries, Pakistan faces elevated risk of HIV transmission as a result of poverty, low literacy, gender-related discrimination, ignorance about modes of transmission and the stigma that prohibits people with risk behaviours from seeking HIV testing or disclosing their HIV positive status. Although the overall prevalence is still less than 1 percent in the adult population, the latest estimates of people living with HIV (PLHIV) is 150 000. In 2018, 21 000 new infections were recorded. In Sindh Province where Larkana district belongs, the HIV/AIDS response is spearheaded by Sindh AIDS Control Program (SACP). The HIV service delivery is limited and mostly focused on key populations (injectable drug users, sex workers) in Karachi and Larkana districts.\n\nThe recommendations of the WHO expert mission and national experts on the ground will be helpful in determining the risk factors associated with this outbreak, confirmation of the outbreak (whether this is new or has been going on for some time and detected now) and planning the immediate, medium, and long term activities. - Mod.UBA\n\nMaps of Pakistan: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/707 and https://geology.com/world/pakistan-province-map.gif (provinces)]", "summary": "For more information contact:\nMs Maryam Yunus\nCommunications Officer\nWHO Country Office, Pakistan\n<yunusm@who.int>\n\nDr Safdar Kamal Pasha\n A ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n \n\nOver 742 people including 605 children have so far been tested positive for HIV in Ratodero area of Larkana since [25 Apr 2019], officials of Sindh AIDS Control Program (SACP) said, adding that majority of the children (411) were of 2 to 5 years of age while 57 were of less than one year's age.

Later screening was expanded to other health facilities at the lower level of health care delivery, including selected Rural Health Centres (RHCs) and Basic Health Units (BHUs).", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "hiv/aids", "malaria", "tuberculosis"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2018-03-25 00:00:00", "2019-05-25 00:00:00", "2019-06-03 00:00:00", "2019-05-08 00:00:00", "2019-05-30 00:00:00", "2003-03-25 00:00:00", "2019-05-16 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Sindh Province", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Sindh province", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Larkana", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Pakistan", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Geneva", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Paediatric", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Sindh", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Malaria", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Karachi", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "2206059", "headline": "PRO/EDR> HIV/AIDS, global epidemic escalates", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=2206059", "date": "2004-07-06 23:50:00", "main_text": "HIV/AIDS, GLOBAL EPIDEMIC ESCALATES\n************************************\n<http://www.promedmail.org>\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\n<http://www.isid.org>\nDate: Tue 6 Jul 2004\nFrom: 'George Robertson' <robertson@pda.org>\nSource: Washington Post Foreign Service, Wed 7 Jul 2004 [edited]\n\nAIDS epidemic grows at record rate\n----------------------------------\nThe AIDS epidemic is continuing to grow at a record rate with roughly 4.8\nmillion people becoming infected last year with the virus that causes AIDS,\naccording to a United Nations report released today\n<http://www.unaids.org/en/other/functionalities/ViewDocument.asp?href=http://gva-doc-owl/WEBcontent/Documents/pub/Media/Press-Releases02/PR_Globalreport2004_06Jul04_en.pdf>.\nThat is the largest increase in any year since the global outbreak began,\nthe report said.\nThirty-eight million people are living with HIV, as the epidemic continues\nto deepen in sub-Saharan Africa, by far the hardest hit region, and new\nepidemics seem to be swelling unchecked in Asia and Eastern Europe.\nLife-prolonging drugs are not getting to those who need them most,\naccording to the report. Some 400 000 people in the developing world have\naccess to the drugs out of 6 million who need them, UN experts here said.\nAccording to the report, the most global epidemic in history is also\nbecoming increasingly feminine. Now, nearly half of all people infected\nbetween the ages of 15 and 49 are women. In Africa, the proportion is\nalmost 60 per cent.\nThe report comes at a time when the world has significantly boosted its\ncommitment and resources to HIV/AIDS, but the need is still far greater,\naccording to the fourth global report by the Joint United Nations Program\non HIV/AIDS released in advance of Sunday's 15th International AIDS\nConference here. 'Over 20 years of AIDS provides us with compelling\nevidence that unless we act now we will be paying later -- a trenchant\nmessage for the countries of Asia and the Pacific,' said Peter Piot, the\nprogram's executive director, in the report.\nIn Asia, with 60 per cent of the world's population, 7.4 million people are\nliving with HIV. One of every 4 newly-infected people is Asian. The\nepidemic is fueled by drug use, sex work, and sex between men, but it is\nfast moving into the general population, UN experts said. China and India\nhave severe epidemics in a number of provinces, territories, and states. In\nIndonesia and Vietnam, infections among injecting drug users have soared.\n'There's a . . . window of opportunity to get prevention programs up to\nscale in Asia,' said Kathleen Cravero, the program's deputy executive\ndirector at a press conference here. 'If we miss it, we will see an\nepidemic the likes of which we never imagined despite what has happened in\nAfrica.'\nFar from leveling off, in many countries in sub-Saharan Africa infection\nrates are on the rise. In that region alone last year, 3 million people\nbecame sick with HIV. Seven countries in southern Africa report prevalence\nrates -- the percentage of people who have HIV -- of more than 15 per cent.\nThey are Botswana, Swaziland, Lesotho, Zimbabwe, South Africa, Namibia, and\nZambia. A prevalence rate higher than 1 per cent is considered to be a\ngeneralized epidemic.\n(byline: Ellen Nakashima)\n--\nGeorge A Robertson, PhD\nVice President Science & Technology\nPDA\nAn International Association for Pharmaceutical and Biopharmaceutical\nScience and Technology\n3 Bethesda Metro Center, Suite 1500\nBethesda, MD 20814 USA\n<robertson@pda.org>\n[ProMED-mail does not normally carry reports on HIV/AIDS, but the\nseriousness of the current situation and the magnitude of the developing\nglobal epidemic requires this rule to be over-ridden to post this UN\nreport. - Mod.CP]", "summary": "HIV/AIDS, GLOBAL EPIDEMIC ESCALATES\n************************************\n<http://www.promedmail.org>\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\n<http://www.isid.org>\n The report comes at a time when the world has significantly boosted its\ncommitment and resources to HIV/AIDS, but the need is still far greater,\naccording to the fourth global report by the Joint United Nations Program\non HIV/AIDS released in advance of Sunday's 15th International AIDS\nConference here.
