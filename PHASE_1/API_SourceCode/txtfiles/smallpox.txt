In the first stage of the\ncivilian program, active surveillance is being conducted for any\nadverse events after vaccination that require medical care.\nIn the military vaccination program, military personnel receive\nmedical care primarily in a network of linked clinics that report\nadverse events to medical headquarters and VAERS.\nCivilian Case Reports\n-------------------\nThe 3 new cases of cardiac adverse events among civilians during\n24-30 Mar 2003 include 2 cases of myopericarditis and one case of\nmyocardial infarction (Table 1):\n<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5213a4.htm>\nCase 1. A man aged 56 years with a history of mild hypertension\nand hypertriglyceridemia was revaccinated on 4 Mar 2003. On 16\nMar 2003, he had onset of influenza-like illness (ILI), chest\ndiscomfort while lying flat, and pleuritic pain during inspiration; a\nclinical examination revealed tachycardia. During the next 7 days,\nhe had chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, fever, chills, pallor, and left\nknee pain. All symptoms and signs had resolved 17 days after\nvaccination. On day 23 post vaccination, an electrocardiogram\n(ECG) indicated low R waves in the anterior leads and borderline\nfirst-degree AV block (PR interval: 0.21 msec). Echocardiogram\nrevealed widening of the pericardial space with minimal fluid\ncollection, a normal ejection fraction, and normal ventricular wall\nfunction. Chest radiograph demonstrated left basilar atelectasis. The\npatient had normal troponin I, creatine kinase myocardial band (CK-\nMB), C-reactive protein levels, and a normal erythrocyte\nsedimentation rate. These findings are consistent with mild\nmyopericarditis. The patient recovered; a follow-up exercise cardiac\nperfusion scan was normal.\nCase 2. A woman aged 32 years with no history of cardiac disease\nor major risk factors for coronary artery disease was vaccinated for\nthe first time on 31 Jan 2003. On 16 Feb 2003, she had fever,\ncrushing-type chest pain, and shortness of breath, which prompted\na visit to the emergency department (ED). An ECG indicated\nnonspecific ST-T wave changes; cardiac enzymes were normal. A\nrepeat ECG several days later was normal. After 5--6 days, her\nsymptoms resolved completely, and she was able to resume normal\nactivities. 6 weeks after vaccination, a nuclear stress test was\nnormal. Her clinical course and ECG findings were consistent with\nmyopericarditis.\nCase 3. An active man aged 64 years with a history of dyspnea on\nexertion and productive cough for 3 months and 8 previous smallpox\nvaccinations was revaccinated on 21 Mar 2003. On 23 Mar 2003, he\nsought medical care for chest \"fullness\" and dizziness. Blood tests\nindicated elevated troponin I and CK-MB levels. ECG demonstrated\ninferior ST segment depression and T wave inversion.\nEchocardiography indicated moderate inferior wall hypokenesis with\na normal ejection fraction. Coronary arteriography showed 3-vessel\natherosclerotic disease with development of some collateral\ncirculation. The patient underwent cardiac catheterization with\nballoon atherotomy, and 2 coronary artery stents were placed. The\nclinical course and laboratory findings are consistent with acute\nmyocardial infarction in a patient with chronic coronary artery\ndisease. He returned to work on 31 Mar 2003.\nUpdate on Previous Civilian Cardiac Adverse Events\n------------------------------------------------\nOn 23 Mar 2003, a woman aged 55 years with a history of\nhypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and smoking died 5 days after\nsmallpox vaccination (1). Autopsy showed extensive atherosclerotic\ndisease, with right coronary artery thrombosis and lateral wall\nsoftening. Preliminary testing, including real-time polymerase chain\nreaction (PCR) and immunohistochemistry, showed evidence of\nvaccinia virus only at the vaccination site; limited analyses of other\ntissues, including heart and other visceral tissue, were negative for\nvaccinia virus by real-time PCR and immunohistochemistry.\nOn 26 Mar 2003, a woman aged 57 years with a history of smoking,\nhypertension, transient ischemic attack, and carotid endarterectomy\ndied 22 days after smallpox vaccination (1). Autopsy showed\nextensive atherosclerosis of the coronary arteries and a large\nhealing infarct involving the posterior wall of the left ventricle and\nintraventricular septum. Histopathologic evaluation revealed no\nevidence of myocarditis or pericarditis. Preliminary analysis using\nreal-time PCR tests showed evidence of vaccinia virus DNA at the\nvaccination site but not in affected myocardium or other viscera.\nMilitary Case Reports\n-------------------\nDuring 25-31 Mar 2003, 4 cases of myocarditis and/or pericarditis\nwere identified, totaling 14 cases among approximately 250 000\npersonnel who received smallpox vaccination for the first time. No\ncases of myocarditis and/or pericarditis were identified among\napproximately 115 000 service members who were revaccinated.\nAmong the approximately 365 000 vaccinated military service\nmembers, one death has been reported.\nThe 14 patients with myocarditis and/or pericarditis ranged in age\nfrom 21 to 33 years. Severity ranged from mild (no ECG or\nechocardiogram changes) to severe (congestive heart failure), with\nonset 7 to 19 days after vaccination. All military patients were\nhospitalized, and all survived. As of 2 Apr 2003, the patient with\nthe most severe case has been hospitalized for 6 days. All other\nhospitalized patients have been discharged; they have either\nreturned to duty or are on short-term convalescent leave. Following\nare 2 cases that represent the spectrum of clinical presentations of\nmyopericarditis and a report of a fatal case of myocardial infarction.\nCase 1. On 18 Mar 2003, a man aged 22 years sought medical care\nat a military health clinic for chest pain 12 days after primary\nsmallpox vaccination. He was treated with nonsteroidal anti-\ninflammatory agents for presumed costochondritis. When laboratory\ntests revealed elevated cardiac enzymes levels, he was referred to a\nuniversity hospital emergency department (ED) for further\nevaluation. Cardiac enzymes levels remained elevated, but an ECG,\nechocardiogram, and cardiac stress test were normal.\nMyopericarditis was diagnosed, and he was released that day in\ngood condition.\nCase 2. A man aged 29 years had ILI symptoms during the same\nweek of primary smallpox vaccination. At the time of smallpox\nvaccination on 8 Mar 2003, he also received 5 other inactivated\nvaccines; 19 days after vaccination, he sought treatment at an ED\nfor dyspnea while lying flat. On 28 Mar 2003, he was hospitalized\nand had myopericarditis diagnosed based on ECG findings and\nelevated troponin I and CK-MB. The next day, he had pulmonary\nedema with a pulmonary artery wedge pressure of 38 mmHg that\nresponded well to several doses of intravenous diuretics. Serial\nechocardiograms showed ejection fractions as low as 25 percent\nthat subsequently improved to 45 percent (normal: >55 percent).\nEndomyocardial biopsy revealed active myocarditis with a mixed\ninfiltrate of lymphocytes and eosinophils and evidence of\neosinophilic degranulation in proximity to myocyte necrosis. PCR\ntesting of myocardial tissue was negative for vaccinia virus DNA,\nvaricella-zoster virus DNA, and herpes simplex virus DNA;\nreverse transcriptase PCR was negative for enterovirus RNA. As of\n2 Apr 2003, he remained hospitalized but was stable and improving.\nCase 3. On 25 Mar 2003, an Army National Guardsman aged 55\nyears with a history of smoking and treatment for hyperlipidemia\nwas found unresponsive in a vehicle 5 days after receiving smallpox\nvaccine and 2 other inactivated vaccines. He was resuscitated but\ndied the next day. Autopsy showed acute thrombosis of the right\nanterior descending coronary artery, 3-vessel coronary artery\ndisease with 75-80 percent occlusion, left ventricular hypertrophy,\nand cardiomegaly. Histopathology of left ventricular myocardium\nrevealed no evidence of myocarditis or pericarditis. Virologic testing\nof myocardium is pending. The cause of death was acute\nmyocardial infarction.\nUpdate on Adverse Events in the Civilian Vaccination Program\n-----------------------------------------\nAs of 30 Mar 2003, no cases of several potentially life-threatening\nadverse events associated historically with smallpox vaccination\n(i.e., progressive vaccinia, eczema vaccinatum, post-vaccinial\nencephalitis, or encephalomyelitis) have been reported among\ncivilians. In addition, no cases of vaccinia transmission from\ncivilians have been reported. This includes no transmission from 18\n344 members of health-care teams, 6655 of whom have been\nfollowed for longer than 1 month.\nDuring 11-30 Mar 2003, 6 cases of generalized vaccinia, 14 cases\nof inadvertent inoculation (nonocular), and 4 cases of\nmyopericarditis were reported (Table 2:\n<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5213a4.htm>).\nDuring the same period, 12 other serious adverse events were\nreported. Of these, 4 were myocardial infarctions, and 2 were cases\nof angina (Table 3:\n<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5213a4.htm>).\nThe remaining 6 other new serious adverse events had hospital\ndischarge diagnoses of pancreatic cancer, urinary tract infection,\nherpes zoster virus infection, headache, and facial paralysis with\nparesthesias (Table 3). Among the 192 vaccinees with reported\nother nonserious adverse events during 24 Jan 2003-30 Mar 2003\n(Table 3), the most common signs and symptoms were fever (n =\n42), rash (n = 39), headache (n = 34), and pruritus (n = 32). All of\nthese commonly reported events are consistent with mild expected\nreactions after receipt of smallpox vaccine. Some vaccinees\nreported multiple signs and symptoms. During 11-30 Mar 2003, no\nvaccinia immune globulin was released for civilian vaccinees (Table\n4: <http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5213a4.htm>).\nSurveillance for adverse events during the civilian and military\nsmallpox vaccination programs is ongoing; regular surveillance\nreports will be published in MMWR.\nMMWR Editorial Note:\n--------------------\nNew reports of myopericarditis following smallpox vaccination are\nconsistent with previous reports describing a potential causal\nassociation between vaccination and myopericarditis (1). One new\ncase of myocardial infarction among civilian vaccinees and one\ndeath from myocardial infarction among military vaccinees have\nbeen reported, but any association between smallpox vaccine and\nischemic heart disease remains unclear.\nMyopericarditis is often asymptomatic or mild, but can be severe.\nSymptomatic patients report chest pain, fatigue, fever, palpitations,\nand dyspnea on exertion. The patient with myopericarditis and\ncongestive heart failure reported by DoD illustrates the potential\nseverity of the condition, which can lead to severe cardiac\ndysfunction or dysrhythmia. In addition, rare fatal cases of\nmyocarditis after smallpox vaccination have been reported in Europe\nand Australia (2,3). Evaluation and follow-up guidelines are being\ndeveloped by CDC to assist health-care providers in managing\nvaccinees with cardiac adverse events.\nPreliminary autopsy findings for the 3 patients with myocardial\ninfarction who died showed no evidence of disseminated vaccinia\ninfection or myopericarditis. Although virologic testing of\nmyocardial tissue is pending for one patient and is limited for the\nother 2, these findings suggest the ischemic events in these patients\ndid not result from vaccinia-associated myocarditis. The number of\nreported deaths from cardiac disease among civilians and military\npersonnel is consistent with expected background rates (1).\nHowever, it is not known whether smallpox vaccination could\ncontribute to these events through another mechanism.\nOn the basis of the civilian and military cases, and guidance from\nthe Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (4) and an\nindependent group of cardiology consultants, CDC revised its\nrecommendations for screening and exclusion of potential smallpox\nvaccine recipients. Persons should be excluded from the pre-event\nsmallpox vaccination program if they have had heart disease or any\ntype of ischemic cardiovascular disease diagnosed, with or without\nsymptoms (e.g., previous myocardial infarction, angina, congestive\nheart failure, cardiomyopathy, stroke or transient ischemic attack,\nor other heart conditions under the care of a doctor). Persons also\nshould be excluded if they have 3 or more risk factors:\nhypertension, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, smoking, or an\nimmediate family member who had onset of a heart condition before\nage 50. To date, 5 of the 6 vaccinated civilians with cardiac adverse\nevents indicative of ischemic heart disease met these exclusion\ncriteria.\nReferences\n------------\n1. CDC.

While these deaths could have been\nunrelated to receipt of vaccine, the additional recommendations to\nscreen out those individuals with histories that would predispose to\nmyocardial infarction still appears prudent, as other factors may be\ncontributing to these events.\nThe document: Recommendations for Using Smallpox Vaccine in a\nPre-Event Vaccination Program: Supplemental Recommendations of\nthe Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) and the\nHealthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee\n(HICPAC) can be found in the 4 Apr 2003 MMWR 52(RR07) These\nrecommendations do not carry the revised recommendations to\nexclude potential cardiac high-risk patients as mentioned in the\nMMWR editorial note above.\n<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5207a1.htm>.\nWith respect to current observed adverse event rates, according to\nthe latest statistics there have been 20 serious adverse events\nrelated to receipt of smallpox vaccine out of 29 584 vaccinations\ngiven, representing a serious adverse event rate of 676 per 1 000\n000 doses administered.

Histopathologic evaluation revealed no\nevidence of myocarditis or pericarditis. Preliminary analysis using\nreal-time PCR tests showed evidence of vaccinia virus DNA at the\nvaccination site but not in affected myocardium or other viscera.\nMilitary Case Reports\n-------------------\nDuring 25-31 Mar 2003, 4 cases of myocarditis and/or pericarditis\nwere identified, totaling 14 cases among approximately 250 000\npersonnel who received smallpox vaccination for the first time. No\ncases of myocarditis and/or pericarditis were identified among\napproximately 115 000 service members who were revaccinated.\nAmong the approximately 365 000 vaccinated military service\nmembers, one death has been reported.\nThe 14 patients with myocarditis and/or pericarditis ranged in age\nfrom 21 to 33 years. Severity ranged from mild (no ECG or\nechocardiogram changes) to severe (congestive heart failure), with\nonset 7 to 19 days after vaccination. All military patients were\nhospitalized, and all survived. As of 2 Apr 2003, the patient with\nthe most severe case has been hospitalized for 6 days. All other\nhospitalized patients have been discharged; they have either\nreturned to duty or are on short-term convalescent leave. Following\nare 2 cases that represent the spectrum of clinical presentations of\nmyopericarditis and a report of a fatal case of myocardial infarction.\nCase 1. On 18 Mar 2003, a man aged 22 years sought medical care\nat a military health clinic for chest pain 12 days after primary\nsmallpox vaccination. He was treated with nonsteroidal anti-\ninflammatory agents for presumed costochondritis. When laboratory\ntests revealed elevated cardiac enzymes levels, he was referred to a\nuniversity hospital emergency department (ED) for further\nevaluation. Cardiac enzymes levels remained elevated, but an ECG,\nechocardiogram, and cardiac stress test were normal.\nMyopericarditis was diagnosed, and he was released that day in\ngood condition.\nCase 2. A man aged 29 years had ILI symptoms during the same\nweek of primary smallpox vaccination. At the time of smallpox\nvaccination on 8 Mar 2003, he also received 5 other inactivated\nvaccines; 19 days after vaccination, he sought treatment at an ED\nfor dyspnea while lying flat. On 28 Mar 2003, he was hospitalized\nand had myopericarditis diagnosed based on ECG findings and\nelevated troponin I and CK-MB. The next day, he had pulmonary\nedema with a pulmonary artery wedge pressure of 38 mmHg that\nresponded well to several doses of intravenous diuretics. Serial\nechocardiograms showed ejection fractions as low as 25 percent\nthat subsequently improved to 45 percent (normal: >55 percent).\nEndomyocardial biopsy revealed active myocarditis with a mixed\ninfiltrate of lymphocytes and eosinophils and evidence of\neosinophilic degranulation in proximity to myocyte necrosis. PCR\ntesting of myocardial tissue was negative for vaccinia virus DNA,\nvaricella-zoster virus DNA, and herpes simplex virus DNA;\nreverse transcriptase PCR was negative for enterovirus RNA. As of\n2 Apr 2003, he remained hospitalized but was stable and improving.\nCase 3. On 25 Mar 2003, an Army National Guardsman aged 55\nyears with a history of smoking and treatment for hyperlipidemia\nwas found unresponsive in a vehicle 5 days after receiving smallpox\nvaccine and 2 other inactivated vaccines. He was resuscitated but\ndied the next day. Autopsy showed acute thrombosis of the right\nanterior descending coronary artery, 3-vessel coronary artery\ndisease with 75-80 percent occlusion, left ventricular hypertrophy,\nand cardiomegaly. Histopathology of left ventricular myocardium\nrevealed no evidence of myocarditis or pericarditis. Virologic testing\nof myocardium is pending. The cause of death was acute\nmyocardial infarction.\nUpdate on Adverse Events in the Civilian Vaccination Program\n-----------------------------------------\nAs of 30 Mar 2003, no cases of several potentially life-threatening\nadverse events associated historically with smallpox vaccination\n(i.e., progressive vaccinia, eczema vaccinatum, post-vaccinial\nencephalitis, or encephalomyelitis) have been reported among\ncivilians. In addition, no cases of vaccinia transmission from\ncivilians have been reported. This includes no transmission from 18\n344 members of health-care teams, 6655 of whom have been\nfollowed for longer than 1 month.\nDuring 11-30 Mar 2003, 6 cases of generalized vaccinia, 14 cases\nof inadvertent inoculation (nonocular), and 4 cases of\nmyopericarditis were reported (Table 2:\n<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5213a4.htm>).\nDuring the same period, 12 other serious adverse events were\nreported. Of these, 4 were myocardial infarctions, and 2 were cases\nof angina (Table 3:\n<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5213a4.htm>).\nThe remaining 6 other new serious adverse events had hospital\ndischarge diagnoses of pancreatic cancer, urinary tract infection,\nherpes zoster virus infection, headache, and facial paralysis with\nparesthesias (Table 3). Among the 192 vaccinees with reported\nother nonserious adverse events during 24 Jan 2003-30 Mar 2003\n(Table 3), the most common signs and symptoms were fever (n =\n42), rash (n = 39), headache (n = 34), and pruritus (n = 32). All of\nthese commonly reported events are consistent with mild expected\nreactions after receipt of smallpox vaccine. Some vaccinees\nreported multiple signs and symptoms. During 11-30 Mar 2003, no\nvaccinia immune globulin was released for civilian vaccinees (Table\n4: <http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5213a4.htm>).\nSurveillance for adverse events during the civilian and military\nsmallpox vaccination programs is ongoing; regular surveillance\nreports will be published in MMWR.\nMMWR Editorial Note:\n--------------------\nNew reports of myopericarditis following smallpox vaccination are\nconsistent with previous reports describing a potential causal\nassociation between vaccination and myopericarditis (1). One new\ncase of myocardial infarction among civilian vaccinees and one\ndeath from myocardial infarction among military vaccinees have\nbeen reported, but any association between smallpox vaccine and\nischemic heart disease remains unclear.\nMyopericarditis is often asymptomatic or mild, but can be severe.\nSymptomatic patients report chest pain, fatigue, fever, palpitations,\nand dyspnea on exertion. The patient with myopericarditis and\ncongestive heart failure reported by DoD illustrates the potential\nseverity of the condition, which can lead to severe cardiac\ndysfunction or dysrhythmia. In addition, rare fatal cases of\nmyocarditis after smallpox vaccination have been reported in Europe\nand Australia (2,3). Evaluation and follow-up guidelines are being\ndeveloped by CDC to assist health-care providers in managing\nvaccinees with cardiac adverse events.\nPreliminary autopsy findings for the 3 patients with myocardial\ninfarction who died showed no evidence of disseminated vaccinia\ninfection or myopericarditis. Although virologic testing of\nmyocardial tissue is pending for one patient and is limited for the\nother 2, these findings suggest the ischemic events in these patients\ndid not result from vaccinia-associated myocarditis. The number of\nreported deaths from cardiac disease among civilians and military\npersonnel is consistent with expected background rates (1).\nHowever, it is not known whether smallpox vaccination could\ncontribute to these events through another mechanism.\nOn the basis of the civilian and military cases, and guidance from\nthe Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (4) and an\nindependent group of cardiology consultants, CDC revised its\nrecommendations for screening and exclusion of potential smallpox\nvaccine recipients. Persons should be excluded from the pre-event\nsmallpox vaccination program if they have had heart disease or any\ntype of ischemic cardiovascular disease diagnosed, with or without\nsymptoms (e.g., previous myocardial infarction, angina, congestive\nheart failure, cardiomyopathy, stroke or transient ischemic attack,\nor other heart conditions under the care of a doctor). Persons also\nshould be excluded if they have 3 or more risk factors:\nhypertension, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, smoking, or an\nimmediate family member who had onset of a heart condition before\nage 50. To date, 5 of the 6 vaccinated civilians with cardiac adverse\nevents indicative of ischemic heart disease met these exclusion\ncriteria.\nReferences\n------------\n1. CDC.

This report summarizes\ndata on 10 cases of cardiac adverse events reported among civilian\nvaccinees since the beginning of the smallpox vaccination program,\nincluding 3 new cardiac adverse events reported to CDC from the\nVaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) during 24-30\nMar 2003.\n14 cases of myocarditis and one fatal myocardial infarction have\nbeen reported among military personnel.\nThis report summarizes data on the 3 new cases of cardiac adverse\nevents, updates data on 7 previously reported cases among civilian\nvaccinees (Table 1 from reference 1 below), summarizes selected\ncases of cardiac adverse events among military vaccinees, and\nupdates information on all adverse events reported in the civilian\nvaccination program as of 30 Mar 2003.\n<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5213a4.htm>\nCDC, the Food and Drug Administration, and state health\ndepartments are conducting surveillance for vaccine-associated\nadverse events among civilian vaccinees; the Department of\nDefense (DoD) is conducting surveillance for vaccine-associated\nadverse events among military vaccinees. In the first stage of the\ncivilian program, active surveillance is being conducted for any\nadverse events after vaccination that require medical care.\nIn the military vaccination program, military personnel receive\nmedical care primarily in a network of linked clinics that report\nadverse events to medical headquarters and VAERS.\nCivilian Case Reports\n-------------------\nThe 3 new cases of cardiac adverse events among civilians during\n24-30 Mar 2003 include 2 cases of myopericarditis and one case of\nmyocardial infarction (Table 1):\n<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5213a4.htm>\nCase 1. A man aged 56 years with a history of mild hypertension\nand hypertriglyceridemia was revaccinated on 4 Mar 2003. On 16\nMar 2003, he had onset of influenza-like illness (ILI), chest\ndiscomfort while lying flat, and pleuritic pain during inspiration; a\nclinical examination revealed tachycardia. During the next 7 days,\nhe had chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, fever, chills, pallor, and left\nknee pain. All symptoms and signs had resolved 17 days after\nvaccination. On day 23 post vaccination, an electrocardiogram\n(ECG) indicated low R waves in the anterior leads and borderline\nfirst-degree AV block (PR interval: 0.21 msec). Echocardiogram\nrevealed widening of the pericardial space with minimal fluid\ncollection, a normal ejection fraction, and normal ventricular wall\nfunction. Chest radiograph demonstrated left basilar atelectasis. The\npatient had normal troponin I, creatine kinase myocardial band (CK-\nMB), C-reactive protein levels, and a normal erythrocyte\nsedimentation rate. These findings are consistent with mild\nmyopericarditis. The patient recovered; a follow-up exercise cardiac\nperfusion scan was normal.\nCase 2. A woman aged 32 years with no history of cardiac disease\nor major risk factors for coronary artery disease was vaccinated for\nthe first time on 31 Jan 2003. On 16 Feb 2003, she had fever,\ncrushing-type chest pain, and shortness of breath, which prompted\na visit to the emergency department (ED). An ECG indicated\nnonspecific ST-T wave changes; cardiac enzymes were normal. A\nrepeat ECG several days later was normal. After 5--6 days, her\nsymptoms resolved completely, and she was able to resume normal\nactivities. 6 weeks after vaccination, a nuclear stress test was\nnormal. Her clinical course and ECG findings were consistent with\nmyopericarditis.\nCase 3. An active man aged 64 years with a history of dyspnea on\nexertion and productive cough for 3 months and 8 previous smallpox\nvaccinations was revaccinated on 21 Mar 2003. On 23 Mar 2003, he\nsought medical care for chest \"fullness\" and dizziness. Blood tests\nindicated elevated troponin I and CK-MB levels. ECG demonstrated\ninferior ST segment depression and T wave inversion.\nEchocardiography indicated moderate inferior wall hypokenesis with\na normal ejection fraction. Coronary arteriography showed 3-vessel\natherosclerotic disease with development of some collateral\ncirculation. The patient underwent cardiac catheterization with\nballoon atherotomy, and 2 coronary artery stents were placed. The\nclinical course and laboratory findings are consistent with acute\nmyocardial infarction in a patient with chronic coronary artery\ndisease. He returned to work on 31 Mar 2003.\nUpdate on Previous Civilian Cardiac Adverse Events\n------------------------------------------------\nOn 23 Mar 2003, a woman aged 55 years with a history of\nhypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and smoking died 5 days after\nsmallpox vaccination (1). Autopsy showed extensive atherosclerotic\ndisease, with right coronary artery thrombosis and lateral wall\nsoftening. Preliminary testing, including real-time polymerase chain\nreaction (PCR) and immunohistochemistry, showed evidence of\nvaccinia virus only at the vaccination site; limited analyses of other\ntissues, including heart and other visceral tissue, were negative for\nvaccinia virus by real-time PCR and immunohistochemistry.\nOn 26 Mar 2003, a woman aged 57 years with a history of smoking,\nhypertension, transient ischemic attack, and carotid endarterectomy\ndied 22 days after smallpox vaccination (1). Autopsy showed\nextensive atherosclerosis of the coronary arteries and a large\nhealing infarct involving the posterior wall of the left ventricle and\nintraventricular septum. Histopathologic evaluation revealed no\nevidence of myocarditis or pericarditis. Preliminary analysis using\nreal-time PCR tests showed evidence of vaccinia virus DNA at the\nvaccination site but not in affected myocardium or other viscera.\nMilitary Case Reports\n-------------------\nDuring 25-31 Mar 2003, 4 cases of myocarditis and/or pericarditis\nwere identified, totaling 14 cases among approximately 250 000\npersonnel who received smallpox vaccination for the first time. No\ncases of myocarditis and/or pericarditis were identified among\napproximately 115 000 service members who were revaccinated.\nAmong the approximately 365 000 vaccinated military service\nmembers, one death has been reported.\nThe 14 patients with myocarditis and/or pericarditis ranged in age\nfrom 21 to 33 years.

This report summarizes\ndata on 10 cases of cardiac adverse events reported among civilian\nvaccinees since the beginning of the smallpox vaccination program,\nincluding 3 new cardiac adverse events reported to CDC from the\nVaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) during 24-30\nMar 2003.\n14 cases of myocarditis and one fatal myocardial infarction have\nbeen reported among military personnel.\nThis report summarizes data on the 3 new cases of cardiac adverse\nevents, updates data on 7 previously reported cases among civilian\nvaccinees (Table 1 from reference 1 below), summarizes selected\ncases of cardiac adverse events among military vaccinees, and\nupdates information on all adverse events reported in the civilian\nvaccination program as of 30 Mar 2003.\n<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5213a4.htm>\nCDC, the Food and Drug Administration, and state health\ndepartments are conducting surveillance for vaccine-associated\nadverse events among civilian vaccinees; the Department of\nDefense (DoD) is conducting surveillance for vaccine-associated\nadverse events among military vaccinees. In the first stage of the\ncivilian program, active surveillance is being conducted for any\nadverse events after vaccination that require medical care.\nIn the military vaccination program, military personnel receive\nmedical care primarily in a network of linked clinics that report\nadverse events to medical headquarters and VAERS.\nCivilian Case Reports\n-------------------\nThe 3 new cases of cardiac adverse events among civilians during\n24-30 Mar 2003 include 2 cases of myopericarditis and one case of\nmyocardial infarction (Table 1):\n<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5213a4.htm>\nCase 1. A man aged 56 years with a history of mild hypertension\nand hypertriglyceridemia was revaccinated on 4 Mar 2003. On 16\nMar 2003, he had onset of influenza-like illness (ILI), chest\ndiscomfort while lying flat, and pleuritic pain during inspiration; a\nclinical examination revealed tachycardia. During the next 7 days,\nhe had chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, fever, chills, pallor, and left\nknee pain. All symptoms and signs had resolved 17 days after\nvaccination. On day 23 post vaccination, an electrocardiogram\n(ECG) indicated low R waves in the anterior leads and borderline\nfirst-degree AV block (PR interval: 0.21 msec). Echocardiogram\nrevealed widening of the pericardial space with minimal fluid\ncollection, a normal ejection fraction, and normal ventricular wall\nfunction. Chest radiograph demonstrated left basilar atelectasis. The\npatient had normal troponin I, creatine kinase myocardial band (CK-\nMB), C-reactive protein levels, and a normal erythrocyte\nsedimentation rate. These findings are consistent with mild\nmyopericarditis. The patient recovered; a follow-up exercise cardiac\nperfusion scan was normal.\nCase 2. A woman aged 32 years with no history of cardiac disease\nor major risk factors for coronary artery disease was vaccinated for\nthe first time on 31 Jan 2003. On 16 Feb 2003, she had fever,\ncrushing-type chest pain, and shortness of breath, which prompted\na visit to the emergency department (ED). An ECG indicated\nnonspecific ST-T wave changes; cardiac enzymes were normal. A\nrepeat ECG several days later was normal. After 5--6 days, her\nsymptoms resolved completely, and she was able to resume normal\nactivities. 6 weeks after vaccination, a nuclear stress test was\nnormal. Her clinical course and ECG findings were consistent with\nmyopericarditis.\nCase 3. An active man aged 64 years with a history of dyspnea on\nexertion and productive cough for 3 months and 8 previous smallpox\nvaccinations was revaccinated on 21 Mar 2003. On 23 Mar 2003, he\nsought medical care for chest \"fullness\" and dizziness. Blood tests\nindicated elevated troponin I and CK-MB levels. ECG demonstrated\ninferior ST segment depression and T wave inversion.\nEchocardiography indicated moderate inferior wall hypokenesis with\na normal ejection fraction. Coronary arteriography showed 3-vessel\natherosclerotic disease with development of some collateral\ncirculation. The patient underwent cardiac catheterization with\nballoon atherotomy, and 2 coronary artery stents were placed. The\nclinical course and laboratory findings are consistent with acute\nmyocardial infarction in a patient with chronic coronary artery\ndisease. He returned to work on 31 Mar 2003.\nUpdate on Previous Civilian Cardiac Adverse Events\n------------------------------------------------\nOn 23 Mar 2003, a woman aged 55 years with a history of\nhypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and smoking died 5 days after\nsmallpox vaccination (1). Autopsy showed extensive atherosclerotic\ndisease, with right coronary artery thrombosis and lateral wall\nsoftening. Preliminary testing, including real-time polymerase chain\nreaction (PCR) and immunohistochemistry, showed evidence of\nvaccinia virus only at the vaccination site; limited analyses of other\ntissues, including heart and other visceral tissue, were negative for\nvaccinia virus by real-time PCR and immunohistochemistry.\nOn 26 Mar 2003, a woman aged 57 years with a history of smoking,\nhypertension, transient ischemic attack, and carotid endarterectomy\ndied 22 days after smallpox vaccination (1). Autopsy showed\nextensive atherosclerosis of the coronary arteries and a large\nhealing infarct involving the posterior wall of the left ventricle and\nintraventricular septum. Histopathologic evaluation revealed no\nevidence of myocarditis or pericarditis. Preliminary analysis using\nreal-time PCR tests showed evidence of vaccinia virus DNA at the\nvaccination site but not in affected myocardium or other viscera.\nMilitary Case Reports\n-------------------\nDuring 25-31 Mar 2003, 4 cases of myocarditis and/or pericarditis\nwere identified, totaling 14 cases among approximately 250 000\npersonnel who received smallpox vaccination for the first time. No\ncases of myocarditis and/or pericarditis were identified among\napproximately 115 000 service members who were revaccinated.\nAmong the approximately 365 000 vaccinated military service\nmembers, one death has been reported.\nThe 14 patients with myocarditis and/or pericarditis ranged in age\nfrom 21 to 33 years. Severity ranged from mild (no ECG or\nechocardiogram changes) to severe (congestive heart failure), with\nonset 7 to 19 days after vaccination. All military patients were\nhospitalized, and all survived. As of 2 Apr 2003, the patient with\nthe most severe case has been hospitalized for 6 days. All other\nhospitalized patients have been discharged; they have either\nreturned to duty or are on short-term convalescent leave. Following\nare 2 cases that represent the spectrum of clinical presentations of\nmyopericarditis and a report of a fatal case of myocardial infarction.\nCase 1. On 18 Mar 2003, a man aged 22 years sought medical care\nat a military health clinic for chest pain 12 days after primary\nsmallpox vaccination. He was treated with nonsteroidal anti-\ninflammatory agents for presumed costochondritis. When laboratory\ntests revealed elevated cardiac enzymes levels, he was referred to a\nuniversity hospital emergency department (ED) for further\nevaluation. Cardiac enzymes levels remained elevated, but an ECG,\nechocardiogram, and cardiac stress test were normal.\nMyopericarditis was diagnosed, and he was released that day in\ngood condition.\nCase 2. A man aged 29 years had ILI symptoms during the same\nweek of primary smallpox vaccination. At the time of smallpox\nvaccination on 8 Mar 2003, he also received 5 other inactivated\nvaccines; 19 days after vaccination, he sought treatment at an ED\nfor dyspnea while lying flat. On 28 Mar 2003, he was hospitalized\nand had myopericarditis diagnosed based on ECG findings and\nelevated troponin I and CK-MB. The next day, he had pulmonary\nedema with a pulmonary artery wedge pressure of 38 mmHg that\nresponded well to several doses of intravenous diuretics. Serial\nechocardiograms showed ejection fractions as low as 25 percent\nthat subsequently improved to 45 percent (normal: >55 percent).\nEndomyocardial biopsy revealed active myocarditis with a mixed\ninfiltrate of lymphocytes and eosinophils and evidence of\neosinophilic degranulation in proximity to myocyte necrosis. PCR\ntesting of myocardial tissue was negative for vaccinia virus DNA,\nvaricella-zoster virus DNA, and herpes simplex virus DNA;\nreverse transcriptase PCR was negative for enterovirus RNA. As of\n2 Apr 2003, he remained hospitalized but was stable and improving.\nCase 3. On 25 Mar 2003, an Army National Guardsman aged 55\nyears with a history of smoking and treatment for hyperlipidemia\nwas found unresponsive in a vehicle 5 days after receiving smallpox\nvaccine and 2 other inactivated vaccines. He was resuscitated but\ndied the next day. Autopsy showed acute thrombosis of the right\nanterior descending coronary artery, 3-vessel coronary artery\ndisease with 75-80 percent occlusion, left ventricular hypertrophy,\nand cardiomegaly. Histopathology of left ventricular myocardium\nrevealed no evidence of myocarditis or pericarditis. Virologic testing\nof myocardium is pending. The cause of death was acute\nmyocardial infarction.\nUpdate on Adverse Events in the Civilian Vaccination Program\n-----------------------------------------\nAs of 30 Mar 2003, no cases of several potentially life-threatening\nadverse events associated historically with smallpox vaccination\n(i.e., progressive vaccinia, eczema vaccinatum, post-vaccinial\nencephalitis, or encephalomyelitis) have been reported among\ncivilians. In addition, no cases of vaccinia transmission from\ncivilians have been reported. This includes no transmission from 18\n344 members of health-care teams, 6655 of whom have been\nfollowed for longer than 1 month.\nDuring 11-30 Mar 2003, 6 cases of generalized vaccinia, 14 cases\nof inadvertent inoculation (nonocular), and 4 cases of\nmyopericarditis were reported (Table 2:\n<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5213a4.htm>).\nDuring the same period, 12 other serious adverse events were\nreported. Of these, 4 were myocardial infarctions, and 2 were cases\nof angina (Table 3:\n<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5213a4.htm>).\nThe remaining 6 other new serious adverse events had hospital\ndischarge diagnoses of pancreatic cancer, urinary tract infection,\nherpes zoster virus infection, headache, and facial paralysis with\nparesthesias (Table 3). Among the 192 vaccinees with reported\nother nonserious adverse events during 24 Jan 2003-30 Mar 2003\n(Table 3), the most common signs and symptoms were fever (n =\n42), rash (n = 39), headache (n = 34), and pruritus (n = 32). All of\nthese commonly reported events are consistent with mild expected\nreactions after receipt of smallpox vaccine. Some vaccinees\nreported multiple signs and symptoms. During 11-30 Mar 2003, no\nvaccinia immune globulin was released for civilian vaccinees (Table\n4: <http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5213a4.htm>).\nSurveillance for adverse events during the civilian and military\nsmallpox vaccination programs is ongoing; regular surveillance\nreports will be published in MMWR.\nMMWR Editorial Note:\n--------------------\nNew reports of myopericarditis following smallpox vaccination are\nconsistent with previous reports describing a potential causal\nassociation between vaccination and myopericarditis (1). One new\ncase of myocardial infarction among civilian vaccinees and one\ndeath from myocardial infarction among military vaccinees have\nbeen reported, but any association between smallpox vaccine and\nischemic heart disease remains unclear.\nMyopericarditis is often asymptomatic or mild, but can be severe.\nSymptomatic patients report chest pain, fatigue, fever, palpitations,\nand dyspnea on exertion. The patient with myopericarditis and\ncongestive heart failure reported by DoD illustrates the potential\nseverity of the condition, which can lead to severe cardiac\ndysfunction or dysrhythmia. In addition, rare fatal cases of\nmyocarditis after smallpox vaccination have been reported in Europe\nand Australia (2,3). Evaluation and follow-up guidelines are being\ndeveloped by CDC to assist health-care providers in managing\nvaccinees with cardiac adverse events.\nPreliminary autopsy findings for the 3 patients with myocardial\ninfarction who died showed no evidence of disseminated vaccinia\ninfection or myopericarditis. Although virologic testing of\nmyocardial tissue is pending for one patient and is limited for the\nother 2, these findings suggest the ischemic events in these patients\ndid not result from vaccinia-associated myocarditis. The number of\nreported deaths from cardiac disease among civilians and military\npersonnel is consistent with expected background rates (1).\nHowever, it is not known whether smallpox vaccination could\ncontribute to these events through another mechanism.\nOn the basis of the civilian and military cases, and guidance from\nthe Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (4) and an\nindependent group of cardiology consultants, CDC revised its\nrecommendations for screening and exclusion of potential smallpox\nvaccine recipients. Persons should be excluded from the pre-event\nsmallpox vaccination program if they have had heart disease or any\ntype of ischemic cardiovascular disease diagnosed, with or without\nsymptoms (e.g., previous myocardial infarction, angina, congestive\nheart failure, cardiomyopathy, stroke or transient ischemic attack,\nor other heart conditions under the care of a doctor). Persons also\nshould be excluded if they have 3 or more risk factors:\nhypertension, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, smoking, or an\nimmediate family member who had onset of a heart condition before\nage 50. To date, 5 of the 6 vaccinated civilians with cardiac adverse\nevents indicative of ischemic heart disease met these exclusion\ncriteria.\nReferences\n------------\n1. CDC.

In the first stage of the\ncivilian program, active surveillance is being conducted for any\nadverse events after vaccination that require medical care.\nIn the military vaccination program, military personnel receive\nmedical care primarily in a network of linked clinics that report\nadverse events to medical headquarters and VAERS.\nCivilian Case Reports\n-------------------\nThe 3 new cases of cardiac adverse events among civilians during\n24-30 Mar 2003 include 2 cases of myopericarditis and one case of\nmyocardial infarction (Table 1):\n<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5213a4.htm>\nCase 1. A man aged 56 years with a history of mild hypertension\nand hypertriglyceridemia was revaccinated on 4 Mar 2003. On 16\nMar 2003, he had onset of influenza-like illness (ILI), chest\ndiscomfort while lying flat, and pleuritic pain during inspiration; a\nclinical examination revealed tachycardia. During the next 7 days,\nhe had chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, fever, chills, pallor, and left\nknee pain. All symptoms and signs had resolved 17 days after\nvaccination. On day 23 post vaccination, an electrocardiogram\n(ECG) indicated low R waves in the anterior leads and borderline\nfirst-degree AV block (PR interval: 0.21 msec). Echocardiogram\nrevealed widening of the pericardial space with minimal fluid\ncollection, a normal ejection fraction, and normal ventricular wall\nfunction. Chest radiograph demonstrated left basilar atelectasis. The\npatient had normal troponin I, creatine kinase myocardial band (CK-\nMB), C-reactive protein levels, and a normal erythrocyte\nsedimentation rate. These findings are consistent with mild\nmyopericarditis. The patient recovered; a follow-up exercise cardiac\nperfusion scan was normal.\nCase 2. A woman aged 32 years with no history of cardiac disease\nor major risk factors for coronary artery disease was vaccinated for\nthe first time on 31 Jan 2003. On 16 Feb 2003, she had fever,\ncrushing-type chest pain, and shortness of breath, which prompted\na visit to the emergency department (ED). An ECG indicated\nnonspecific ST-T wave changes; cardiac enzymes were normal. A\nrepeat ECG several days later was normal. After 5--6 days, her\nsymptoms resolved completely, and she was able to resume normal\nactivities. 6 weeks after vaccination, a nuclear stress test was\nnormal. Her clinical course and ECG findings were consistent with\nmyopericarditis.\nCase 3. An active man aged 64 years with a history of dyspnea on\nexertion and productive cough for 3 months and 8 previous smallpox\nvaccinations was revaccinated on 21 Mar 2003. On 23 Mar 2003, he\nsought medical care for chest \"fullness\" and dizziness. Blood tests\nindicated elevated troponin I and CK-MB levels. ECG demonstrated\ninferior ST segment depression and T wave inversion.\nEchocardiography indicated moderate inferior wall hypokenesis with\na normal ejection fraction. Coronary arteriography showed 3-vessel\natherosclerotic disease with development of some collateral\ncirculation. The patient underwent cardiac catheterization with\nballoon atherotomy, and 2 coronary artery stents were placed. The\nclinical course and laboratory findings are consistent with acute\nmyocardial infarction in a patient with chronic coronary artery\ndisease. He returned to work on 31 Mar 2003.\nUpdate on Previous Civilian Cardiac Adverse Events\n------------------------------------------------\nOn 23 Mar 2003, a woman aged 55 years with a history of\nhypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and smoking died 5 days after\nsmallpox vaccination (1). Autopsy showed extensive atherosclerotic\ndisease, with right coronary artery thrombosis and lateral wall\nsoftening. Preliminary testing, including real-time polymerase chain\nreaction (PCR) and immunohistochemistry, showed evidence of\nvaccinia virus only at the vaccination site; limited analyses of other\ntissues, including heart and other visceral tissue, were negative for\nvaccinia virus by real-time PCR and immunohistochemistry.\nOn 26 Mar 2003, a woman aged 57 years with a history of smoking,\nhypertension, transient ischemic attack, and carotid endarterectomy\ndied 22 days after smallpox vaccination (1). Autopsy showed\nextensive atherosclerosis of the coronary arteries and a large\nhealing infarct involving the posterior wall of the left ventricle and\nintraventricular septum. Histopathologic evaluation revealed no\nevidence of myocarditis or pericarditis. Preliminary analysis using\nreal-time PCR tests showed evidence of vaccinia virus DNA at the\nvaccination site but not in affected myocardium or other viscera.\nMilitary Case Reports\n-------------------\nDuring 25-31 Mar 2003, 4 cases of myocarditis and/or pericarditis\nwere identified, totaling 14 cases among approximately 250 000\npersonnel who received smallpox vaccination for the first time. No\ncases of myocarditis and/or pericarditis were identified among\napproximately 115 000 service members who were revaccinated.\nAmong the approximately 365 000 vaccinated military service\nmembers, one death has been reported.\nThe 14 patients with myocarditis and/or pericarditis ranged in age\nfrom 21 to 33 years. Severity ranged from mild (no ECG or\nechocardiogram changes) to severe (congestive heart failure), with\nonset 7 to 19 days after vaccination. All military patients were\nhospitalized, and all survived. As of 2 Apr 2003, the patient with\nthe most severe case has been hospitalized for 6 days. All other\nhospitalized patients have been discharged; they have either\nreturned to duty or are on short-term convalescent leave. Following\nare 2 cases that represent the spectrum of clinical presentations of\nmyopericarditis and a report of a fatal case of myocardial infarction.\nCase 1. On 18 Mar 2003, a man aged 22 years sought medical care\nat a military health clinic for chest pain 12 days after primary\nsmallpox vaccination. He was treated with nonsteroidal anti-\ninflammatory agents for presumed costochondritis. When laboratory\ntests revealed elevated cardiac enzymes levels, he was referred to a\nuniversity hospital emergency department (ED) for further\nevaluation. Cardiac enzymes levels remained elevated, but an ECG,\nechocardiogram, and cardiac stress test were normal.\nMyopericarditis was diagnosed, and he was released that day in\ngood condition.\nCase 2. A man aged 29 years had ILI symptoms during the same\nweek of primary smallpox vaccination. At the time of smallpox\nvaccination on 8 Mar 2003, he also received 5 other inactivated\nvaccines; 19 days after vaccination, he sought treatment at an ED\nfor dyspnea while lying flat. On 28 Mar 2003, he was hospitalized\nand had myopericarditis diagnosed based on ECG findings and\nelevated troponin I and CK-MB. The next day, he had pulmonary\nedema with a pulmonary artery wedge pressure of 38 mmHg that\nresponded well to several doses of intravenous diuretics. Serial\nechocardiograms showed ejection fractions as low as 25 percent\nthat subsequently improved to 45 percent (normal: >55 percent).\nEndomyocardial biopsy revealed active myocarditis with a mixed\ninfiltrate of lymphocytes and eosinophils and evidence of\neosinophilic degranulation in proximity to myocyte necrosis. PCR\ntesting of myocardial tissue was negative for vaccinia virus DNA,\nvaricella-zoster virus DNA, and herpes simplex virus DNA;\nreverse transcriptase PCR was negative for enterovirus RNA. As of\n2 Apr 2003, he remained hospitalized but was stable and improving.\nCase 3. On 25 Mar 2003, an Army National Guardsman aged 55\nyears with a history of smoking and treatment for hyperlipidemia\nwas found unresponsive in a vehicle 5 days after receiving smallpox\nvaccine and 2 other inactivated vaccines. He was resuscitated but\ndied the next day. Autopsy showed acute thrombosis of the right\nanterior descending coronary artery, 3-vessel coronary artery\ndisease with 75-80 percent occlusion, left ventricular hypertrophy,\nand cardiomegaly. Histopathology of left ventricular myocardium\nrevealed no evidence of myocarditis or pericarditis. Virologic testing\nof myocardium is pending. The cause of death was acute\nmyocardial infarction.\nUpdate on Adverse Events in the Civilian Vaccination Program\n-----------------------------------------\nAs of 30 Mar 2003, no cases of several potentially life-threatening\nadverse events associated historically with smallpox vaccination\n(i.e., progressive vaccinia, eczema vaccinatum, post-vaccinial\nencephalitis, or encephalomyelitis) have been reported among\ncivilians. In addition, no cases of vaccinia transmission from\ncivilians have been reported. This includes no transmission from 18\n344 members of health-care teams, 6655 of whom have been\nfollowed for longer than 1 month.\nDuring 11-30 Mar 2003, 6 cases of generalized vaccinia, 14 cases\nof inadvertent inoculation (nonocular), and 4 cases of\nmyopericarditis were reported (Table 2:\n<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5213a4.htm>).\nDuring the same period, 12 other serious adverse events were\nreported. Of these, 4 were myocardial infarctions, and 2 were cases\nof angina (Table 3:\n<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5213a4.htm>).\nThe remaining 6 other new serious adverse events had hospital\ndischarge diagnoses of pancreatic cancer, urinary tract infection,\nherpes zoster virus infection, headache, and facial paralysis with\nparesthesias (Table 3). Among the 192 vaccinees with reported\nother nonserious adverse events during 24 Jan 2003-30 Mar 2003\n(Table 3), the most common signs and symptoms were fever (n =\n42), rash (n = 39), headache (n = 34), and pruritus (n = 32). All of\nthese commonly reported events are consistent with mild expected\nreactions after receipt of smallpox vaccine. Some vaccinees\nreported multiple signs and symptoms. During 11-30 Mar 2003, no\nvaccinia immune globulin was released for civilian vaccinees (Table\n4: <http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5213a4.htm>).\nSurveillance for adverse events during the civilian and military\nsmallpox vaccination programs is ongoing; regular surveillance\nreports will be published in MMWR.\nMMWR Editorial Note:\n--------------------\nNew reports of myopericarditis following smallpox vaccination are\nconsistent with previous reports describing a potential causal\nassociation between vaccination and myopericarditis (1). One new\ncase of myocardial infarction among civilian vaccinees and one\ndeath from myocardial infarction among military vaccinees have\nbeen reported, but any association between smallpox vaccine and\nischemic heart disease remains unclear.\nMyopericarditis is often asymptomatic or mild, but can be severe.\nSymptomatic patients report chest pain, fatigue, fever, palpitations,\nand dyspnea on exertion. The patient with myopericarditis and\ncongestive heart failure reported by DoD illustrates the potential\nseverity of the condition, which can lead to severe cardiac\ndysfunction or dysrhythmia. In addition, rare fatal cases of\nmyocarditis after smallpox vaccination have been reported in Europe\nand Australia (2,3). Evaluation and follow-up guidelines are being\ndeveloped by CDC to assist health-care providers in managing\nvaccinees with cardiac adverse events.\nPreliminary autopsy findings for the 3 patients with myocardial\ninfarction who died showed no evidence of disseminated vaccinia\ninfection or myopericarditis. Although virologic testing of\nmyocardial tissue is pending for one patient and is limited for the\nother 2, these findings suggest the ischemic events in these patients\ndid not result from vaccinia-associated myocarditis. The number of\nreported deaths from cardiac disease among civilians and military\npersonnel is consistent with expected background rates (1).\nHowever, it is not known whether smallpox vaccination could\ncontribute to these events through another mechanism.\nOn the basis of the civilian and military cases, and guidance from\nthe Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (4) and an\nindependent group of cardiology consultants, CDC revised its\nrecommendations for screening and exclusion of potential smallpox\nvaccine recipients. Persons should be excluded from the pre-event\nsmallpox vaccination program if they have had heart disease or any\ntype of ischemic cardiovascular disease diagnosed, with or without\nsymptoms (e.g., previous myocardial infarction, angina, congestive\nheart failure, cardiomyopathy, stroke or transient ischemic attack,\nor other heart conditions under the care of a doctor). Persons also\nshould be excluded if they have 3 or more risk factors:\nhypertension, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, smoking, or an\nimmediate family member who had onset of a heart condition before\nage 50. To date, 5 of the 6 vaccinated civilians with cardiac adverse\nevents indicative of ischemic heart disease met these exclusion\ncriteria.\nReferences\n------------\n1. CDC.

While these deaths could have been\nunrelated to receipt of vaccine, the additional recommendations to\nscreen out those individuals with histories that would predispose to\nmyocardial infarction still appears prudent, as other factors may be\ncontributing to these events.\nThe document: Recommendations for Using Smallpox Vaccine in a\nPre-Event Vaccination Program: Supplemental Recommendations of\nthe Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) and the\nHealthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee\n(HICPAC) can be found in the 4 Apr 2003 MMWR 52(RR07) These\nrecommendations do not carry the revised recommendations to\nexclude potential cardiac high-risk patients as mentioned in the\nMMWR editorial note above.\n<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5207a1.htm>.\nWith respect to current observed adverse event rates, according to\nthe latest statistics there have been 20 serious adverse events\nrelated to receipt of smallpox vaccine out of 29 584 vaccinations\ngiven, representing a serious adverse event rate of 676 per 1 000\n000 doses administered.

An active man aged 64 years with a history of dyspnea on\nexertion and productive cough for 3 months and 8 previous smallpox\nvaccinations was revaccinated on 21 Mar 2003. On 23 Mar 2003, he\nsought medical care for chest \"fullness\" and dizziness. Blood tests\nindicated elevated troponin I and CK-MB levels. ECG demonstrated\ninferior ST segment depression and T wave inversion.\nEchocardiography indicated moderate inferior wall hypokenesis with\na normal ejection fraction. Coronary arteriography showed 3-vessel\natherosclerotic disease with development of some collateral\ncirculation. The patient underwent cardiac catheterization with\nballoon atherotomy, and 2 coronary artery stents were placed. The\nclinical course and laboratory findings are consistent with acute\nmyocardial infarction in a patient with chronic coronary artery\ndisease. He returned to work on 31 Mar 2003.\nUpdate on Previous Civilian Cardiac Adverse Events\n------------------------------------------------\nOn 23 Mar 2003, a woman aged 55 years with a history of\nhypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and smoking died 5 days after\nsmallpox vaccination (1). Autopsy showed extensive atherosclerotic\ndisease, with right coronary artery thrombosis and lateral wall\nsoftening. Preliminary testing, including real-time polymerase chain\nreaction (PCR) and immunohistochemistry, showed evidence of\nvaccinia virus only at the vaccination site; limited analyses of other\ntissues, including heart and other visceral tissue, were negative for\nvaccinia virus by real-time PCR and immunohistochemistry.\nOn 26 Mar 2003, a woman aged 57 years with a history of smoking,\nhypertension, transient ischemic attack, and carotid endarterectomy\ndied 22 days after smallpox vaccination (1). Autopsy showed\nextensive atherosclerosis of the coronary arteries and a large\nhealing infarct involving the posterior wall of the left ventricle and\nintraventricular septum. Histopathologic evaluation revealed no\nevidence of myocarditis or pericarditis. Preliminary analysis using\nreal-time PCR tests showed evidence of vaccinia virus DNA at the\nvaccination site but not in affected myocardium or other viscera.\nMilitary Case Reports\n-------------------\nDuring 25-31 Mar 2003, 4 cases of myocarditis and/or pericarditis\nwere identified, totaling 14 cases among approximately 250 000\npersonnel who received smallpox vaccination for the first time. No\ncases of myocarditis and/or pericarditis were identified among\napproximately 115 000 service members who were revaccinated.\nAmong the approximately 365 000 vaccinated military service\nmembers, one death has been reported.\nThe 14 patients with myocarditis and/or pericarditis ranged in age\nfrom 21 to 33 years. Severity ranged from mild (no ECG or\nechocardiogram changes) to severe (congestive heart failure), with\nonset 7 to 19 days after vaccination. All military patients were\nhospitalized, and all survived. As of 2 Apr 2003, the patient with\nthe most severe case has been hospitalized for 6 days. All other\nhospitalized patients have been discharged; they have either\nreturned to duty or are on short-term convalescent leave. Following\nare 2 cases that represent the spectrum of clinical presentations of\nmyopericarditis and a report of a fatal case of myocardial infarction.\nCase 1. On 18 Mar 2003, a man aged 22 years sought medical care\nat a military health clinic for chest pain 12 days after primary\nsmallpox vaccination. He was treated with nonsteroidal anti-\ninflammatory agents for presumed costochondritis. When laboratory\ntests revealed elevated cardiac enzymes levels, he was referred to a\nuniversity hospital emergency department (ED) for further\nevaluation. Cardiac enzymes levels remained elevated, but an ECG,\nechocardiogram, and cardiac stress test were normal.\nMyopericarditis was diagnosed, and he was released that day in\ngood condition.\nCase 2. A man aged 29 years had ILI symptoms during the same\nweek of primary smallpox vaccination. At the time of smallpox\nvaccination on 8 Mar 2003, he also received 5 other inactivated\nvaccines; 19 days after vaccination, he sought treatment at an ED\nfor dyspnea while lying flat. On 28 Mar 2003, he was hospitalized\nand had myopericarditis diagnosed based on ECG findings and\nelevated troponin I and CK-MB. The next day, he had pulmonary\nedema with a pulmonary artery wedge pressure of 38 mmHg that\nresponded well to several doses of intravenous diuretics. Serial\nechocardiograms showed ejection fractions as low as 25 percent\nthat subsequently improved to 45 percent (normal: >55 percent).\nEndomyocardial biopsy revealed active myocarditis with a mixed\ninfiltrate of lymphocytes and eosinophils and evidence of\neosinophilic degranulation in proximity to myocyte necrosis. PCR\ntesting of myocardial tissue was negative for vaccinia virus DNA,\nvaricella-zoster virus DNA, and herpes simplex virus DNA;\nreverse transcriptase PCR was negative for enterovirus RNA. As of\n2 Apr 2003, he remained hospitalized but was stable and improving.\nCase 3. On 25 Mar 2003, an Army National Guardsman aged 55\nyears with a history of smoking and treatment for hyperlipidemia\nwas found unresponsive in a vehicle 5 days after receiving smallpox\nvaccine and 2 other inactivated vaccines. He was resuscitated but\ndied the next day. Autopsy showed acute thrombosis of the right\nanterior descending coronary artery, 3-vessel coronary artery\ndisease with 75-80 percent occlusion, left ventricular hypertrophy,\nand cardiomegaly. Histopathology of left ventricular myocardium\nrevealed no evidence of myocarditis or pericarditis. Virologic testing\nof myocardium is pending. The cause of death was acute\nmyocardial infarction.\nUpdate on Adverse Events in the Civilian Vaccination Program\n-----------------------------------------\nAs of 30 Mar 2003, no cases of several potentially life-threatening\nadverse events associated historically with smallpox vaccination\n(i.e., progressive vaccinia, eczema vaccinatum, post-vaccinial\nencephalitis, or encephalomyelitis) have been reported among\ncivilians. In addition, no cases of vaccinia transmission from\ncivilians have been reported. This includes no transmission from 18\n344 members of health-care teams, 6655 of whom have been\nfollowed for longer than 1 month.\nDuring 11-30 Mar 2003, 6 cases of generalized vaccinia, 14 cases\nof inadvertent inoculation (nonocular), and 4 cases of\nmyopericarditis were reported (Table 2:\n<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5213a4.htm>).\nDuring the same period, 12 other serious adverse events were\nreported. Of these, 4 were myocardial infarctions, and 2 were cases\nof angina (Table 3:\n<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5213a4.htm>).\nThe remaining 6 other new serious adverse events had hospital\ndischarge diagnoses of pancreatic cancer, urinary tract infection,\nherpes zoster virus infection, headache, and facial paralysis with\nparesthesias (Table 3). Among the 192 vaccinees with reported\nother nonserious adverse events during 24 Jan 2003-30 Mar 2003\n(Table 3), the most common signs and symptoms were fever (n =\n42), rash (n = 39), headache (n = 34), and pruritus (n = 32). All of\nthese commonly reported events are consistent with mild expected\nreactions after receipt of smallpox vaccine. Some vaccinees\nreported multiple signs and symptoms. During 11-30 Mar 2003, no\nvaccinia immune globulin was released for civilian vaccinees (Table\n4: <http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5213a4.htm>).\nSurveillance for adverse events during the civilian and military\nsmallpox vaccination programs is ongoing; regular surveillance\nreports will be published in MMWR.\nMMWR Editorial Note:\n--------------------\nNew reports of myopericarditis following smallpox vaccination are\nconsistent with previous reports describing a potential causal\nassociation between vaccination and myopericarditis (1). One new\ncase of myocardial infarction among civilian vaccinees and one\ndeath from myocardial infarction among military vaccinees have\nbeen reported, but any association between smallpox vaccine and\nischemic heart disease remains unclear.\nMyopericarditis is often asymptomatic or mild, but can be severe.\nSymptomatic patients report chest pain, fatigue, fever, palpitations,\nand dyspnea on exertion. The patient with myopericarditis and\ncongestive heart failure reported by DoD illustrates the potential\nseverity of the condition, which can lead to severe cardiac\ndysfunction or dysrhythmia. In addition, rare fatal cases of\nmyocarditis after smallpox vaccination have been reported in Europe\nand Australia (2,3). Evaluation and follow-up guidelines are being\ndeveloped by CDC to assist health-care providers in managing\nvaccinees with cardiac adverse events.\nPreliminary autopsy findings for the 3 patients with myocardial\ninfarction who died showed no evidence of disseminated vaccinia\ninfection or myopericarditis. Although virologic testing of\nmyocardial tissue is pending for one patient and is limited for the\nother 2, these findings suggest the ischemic events in these patients\ndid not result from vaccinia-associated myocarditis. The number of\nreported deaths from cardiac disease among civilians and military\npersonnel is consistent with expected background rates (1).\nHowever, it is not known whether smallpox vaccination could\ncontribute to these events through another mechanism.\nOn the basis of the civilian and military cases, and guidance from\nthe Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (4) and an\nindependent group of cardiology consultants, CDC revised its\nrecommendations for screening and exclusion of potential smallpox\nvaccine recipients. Persons should be excluded from the pre-event\nsmallpox vaccination program if they have had heart disease or any\ntype of ischemic cardiovascular disease diagnosed, with or without\nsymptoms (e.g., previous myocardial infarction, angina, congestive\nheart failure, cardiomyopathy, stroke or transient ischemic attack,\nor other heart conditions under the care of a doctor). Persons also\nshould be excluded if they have 3 or more risk factors:\nhypertension, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, smoking, or an\nimmediate family member who had onset of a heart condition before\nage 50. To date, 5 of the 6 vaccinated civilians with cardiac adverse\nevents indicative of ischemic heart disease met these exclusion\ncriteria.\nReferences\n------------\n1. CDC.

While these deaths could have been\nunrelated to receipt of vaccine, the additional recommendations to\nscreen out those individuals with histories that would predispose to\nmyocardial infarction still appears prudent, as other factors may be\ncontributing to these events.\nThe document: Recommendations for Using Smallpox Vaccine in a\nPre-Event Vaccination Program: Supplemental Recommendations of\nthe Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) and the\nHealthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee\n(HICPAC) can be found in the 4 Apr 2003 MMWR 52(RR07) These\nrecommendations do not carry the revised recommendations to\nexclude potential cardiac high-risk patients as mentioned in the\nMMWR editorial note above.\n<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5207a1.htm>.\nWith respect to current observed adverse event rates, according to\nthe latest statistics there have been 20 serious adverse events\nrelated to receipt of smallpox vaccine out of 29 584 vaccinations\ngiven, representing a serious adverse event rate of 676 per 1 000\n000 doses administered.

This report summarizes\ndata on 10 cases of cardiac adverse events reported among civilian\nvaccinees since the beginning of the smallpox vaccination program,\nincluding 3 new cardiac adverse events reported to CDC from the\nVaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) during 24-30\nMar 2003.\n14 cases of myocarditis and one fatal myocardial infarction have\nbeen reported among military personnel.\nThis report summarizes data on the 3 new cases of cardiac adverse\nevents, updates data on 7 previously reported cases among civilian\nvaccinees (Table 1 from reference 1 below), summarizes selected\ncases of cardiac adverse events among military vaccinees, and\nupdates information on all adverse events reported in the civilian\nvaccination program as of 30 Mar 2003.\n<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5213a4.htm>\nCDC, the Food and Drug Administration, and state health\ndepartments are conducting surveillance for vaccine-associated\nadverse events among civilian vaccinees; the Department of\nDefense (DoD) is conducting surveillance for vaccine-associated\nadverse events among military vaccinees. In the first stage of the\ncivilian program, active surveillance is being conducted for any\nadverse events after vaccination that require medical care.\nIn the military vaccination program, military personnel receive\nmedical care primarily in a network of linked clinics that report\nadverse events to medical headquarters and VAERS.\nCivilian Case Reports\n-------------------\nThe 3 new cases of cardiac adverse events among civilians during\n24-30 Mar 2003 include 2 cases of myopericarditis and one case of\nmyocardial infarction (Table 1):\n<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5213a4.htm>\nCase 1. A man aged 56 years with a history of mild hypertension\nand hypertriglyceridemia was revaccinated on 4 Mar 2003. On 16\nMar 2003, he had onset of influenza-like illness (ILI), chest\ndiscomfort while lying flat, and pleuritic pain during inspiration; a\nclinical examination revealed tachycardia. During the next 7 days,\nhe had chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, fever, chills, pallor, and left\nknee pain. All symptoms and signs had resolved 17 days after\nvaccination. On day 23 post vaccination, an electrocardiogram\n(ECG) indicated low R waves in the anterior leads and borderline\nfirst-degree AV block (PR interval: 0.21 msec). Echocardiogram\nrevealed widening of the pericardial space with minimal fluid\ncollection, a normal ejection fraction, and normal ventricular wall\nfunction. Chest radiograph demonstrated left basilar atelectasis. The\npatient had normal troponin I, creatine kinase myocardial band (CK-\nMB), C-reactive protein levels, and a normal erythrocyte\nsedimentation rate. These findings are consistent with mild\nmyopericarditis. The patient recovered; a follow-up exercise cardiac\nperfusion scan was normal.\nCase 2. A woman aged 32 years with no history of cardiac disease\nor major risk factors for coronary artery disease was vaccinated for\nthe first time on 31 Jan 2003. On 16 Feb 2003, she had fever,\ncrushing-type chest pain, and shortness of breath, which prompted\na visit to the emergency department (ED). An ECG indicated\nnonspecific ST-T wave changes; cardiac enzymes were normal. A\nrepeat ECG several days later was normal. After 5--6 days, her\nsymptoms resolved completely, and she was able to resume normal\nactivities. 6 weeks after vaccination, a nuclear stress test was\nnormal. Her clinical course and ECG findings were consistent with\nmyopericarditis.\nCase 3. An active man aged 64 years with a history of dyspnea on\nexertion and productive cough for 3 months and 8 previous smallpox\nvaccinations was revaccinated on 21 Mar 2003. On 23 Mar 2003, he\nsought medical care for chest \"fullness\" and dizziness. Blood tests\nindicated elevated troponin I and CK-MB levels. ECG demonstrated\ninferior ST segment depression and T wave inversion.\nEchocardiography indicated moderate inferior wall hypokenesis with\na normal ejection fraction. Coronary arteriography showed 3-vessel\natherosclerotic disease with development of some collateral\ncirculation. The patient underwent cardiac catheterization with\nballoon atherotomy, and 2 coronary artery stents were placed. The\nclinical course and laboratory findings are consistent with acute\nmyocardial infarction in a patient with chronic coronary artery\ndisease.

One new\ncase of myocardial infarction among civilian vaccinees and one\ndeath from myocardial infarction among military vaccinees have\nbeen reported, but any association between smallpox vaccine and\nischemic heart disease remains unclear.\nMyopericarditis is often asymptomatic or mild, but can be severe.\nSymptomatic patients report chest pain, fatigue, fever, palpitations,\nand dyspnea on exertion. The patient with myopericarditis and\ncongestive heart failure reported by DoD illustrates the potential\nseverity of the condition, which can lead to severe cardiac\ndysfunction or dysrhythmia. In addition, rare fatal cases of\nmyocarditis after smallpox vaccination have been reported in Europe\nand Australia (2,3). Evaluation and follow-up guidelines are being\ndeveloped by CDC to assist health-care providers in managing\nvaccinees with cardiac adverse events.\nPreliminary autopsy findings for the 3 patients with myocardial\ninfarction who died showed no evidence of disseminated vaccinia\ninfection or myopericarditis. Although virologic testing of\nmyocardial tissue is pending for one patient and is limited for the\nother 2, these findings suggest the ischemic events in these patients\ndid not result from vaccinia-associated myocarditis.

This report summarizes\ndata on 10 cases of cardiac adverse events reported among civilian\nvaccinees since the beginning of the smallpox vaccination program,\nincluding 3 new cardiac adverse events reported to CDC from the\nVaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) during 24-30\nMar 2003.\n14 cases of myocarditis and one fatal myocardial infarction have\nbeen reported among military personnel.\nThis report summarizes data on the 3 new cases of cardiac adverse\nevents, updates data on 7 previously reported cases among civilian\nvaccinees (Table 1 from reference 1 below), summarizes selected\ncases of cardiac adverse events among military vaccinees, and\nupdates information on all adverse events reported in the civilian\nvaccination program as of 30 Mar 2003.\n<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5213a4.htm>\nCDC, the Food and Drug Administration, and state health\ndepartments are conducting surveillance for vaccine-associated\nadverse events among civilian vaccinees; the Department of\nDefense (DoD) is conducting surveillance for vaccine-associated\nadverse events among military vaccinees. In the first stage of the\ncivilian program, active surveillance is being conducted for any\nadverse events after vaccination that require medical care.\nIn the military vaccination program, military personnel receive\nmedical care primarily in a network of linked clinics that report\nadverse events to medical headquarters and VAERS.\nCivilian Case Reports\n-------------------\nThe 3 new cases of cardiac adverse events among civilians during\n24-30 Mar 2003 include 2 cases of myopericarditis and one case of\nmyocardial infarction (Table 1):\n<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5213a4.htm>\nCase 1. A man aged 56 years with a history of mild hypertension\nand hypertriglyceridemia was revaccinated on 4 Mar 2003. On 16\nMar 2003, he had onset of influenza-like illness (ILI), chest\ndiscomfort while lying flat, and pleuritic pain during inspiration; a\nclinical examination revealed tachycardia. During the next 7 days,\nhe had chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, fever, chills, pallor, and left\nknee pain. All symptoms and signs had resolved 17 days after\nvaccination. On day 23 post vaccination, an electrocardiogram\n(ECG) indicated low R waves in the anterior leads and borderline\nfirst-degree AV block (PR interval: 0.21 msec). Echocardiogram\nrevealed widening of the pericardial space with minimal fluid\ncollection, a normal ejection fraction, and normal ventricular wall\nfunction. Chest radiograph demonstrated left basilar atelectasis. The\npatient had normal troponin I, creatine kinase myocardial band (CK-\nMB), C-reactive protein levels, and a normal erythrocyte\nsedimentation rate. These findings are consistent with mild\nmyopericarditis. The patient recovered; a follow-up exercise cardiac\nperfusion scan was normal.\nCase 2. A woman aged 32 years with no history of cardiac disease\nor major risk factors for coronary artery disease was vaccinated for\nthe first time on 31 Jan 2003. On 16 Feb 2003, she had fever,\ncrushing-type chest pain, and shortness of breath, which prompted\na visit to the emergency department (ED). An ECG indicated\nnonspecific ST-T wave changes; cardiac enzymes were normal. A\nrepeat ECG several days later was normal. After 5--6 days, her\nsymptoms resolved completely, and she was able to resume normal\nactivities. 6 weeks after vaccination, a nuclear stress test was\nnormal. Her clinical course and ECG findings were consistent with\nmyopericarditis.\nCase 3. An active man aged 64 years with a history of dyspnea on\nexertion and productive cough for 3 months and 8 previous smallpox\nvaccinations was revaccinated on 21 Mar 2003. On 23 Mar 2003, he\nsought medical care for chest \"fullness\" and dizziness. Blood tests\nindicated elevated troponin I and CK-MB levels. ECG demonstrated\ninferior ST segment depression and T wave inversion.\nEchocardiography indicated moderate inferior wall hypokenesis with\na normal ejection fraction. Coronary arteriography showed 3-vessel\natherosclerotic disease with development of some collateral\ncirculation. The patient underwent cardiac catheterization with\nballoon atherotomy, and 2 coronary artery stents were placed. The\nclinical course and laboratory findings are consistent with acute\nmyocardial infarction in a patient with chronic coronary artery\ndisease. He returned to work on 31 Mar 2003.\nUpdate on Previous Civilian Cardiac Adverse Events\n------------------------------------------------\nOn 23 Mar 2003, a woman aged 55 years with a history of\nhypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and smoking died 5 days after\nsmallpox vaccination (1). Autopsy showed extensive atherosclerotic\ndisease, with right coronary artery thrombosis and lateral wall\nsoftening. Preliminary testing, including real-time polymerase chain\nreaction (PCR) and immunohistochemistry, showed evidence of\nvaccinia virus only at the vaccination site; limited analyses of other\ntissues, including heart and other visceral tissue, were negative for\nvaccinia virus by real-time PCR and immunohistochemistry.\nOn 26 Mar 2003, a woman aged 57 years with a history of smoking,\nhypertension, transient ischemic attack, and carotid endarterectomy\ndied 22 days after smallpox vaccination (1). Autopsy showed\nextensive atherosclerosis of the coronary arteries and a large\nhealing infarct involving the posterior wall of the left ventricle and\nintraventricular septum. Histopathologic evaluation revealed no\nevidence of myocarditis or pericarditis. Preliminary analysis using\nreal-time PCR tests showed evidence of vaccinia virus DNA at the\nvaccination site but not in affected myocardium or other viscera.\nMilitary Case Reports\n-------------------\nDuring 25-31 Mar 2003, 4 cases of myocarditis and/or pericarditis\nwere identified, totaling 14 cases among approximately 250 000\npersonnel who received smallpox vaccination for the first time. No\ncases of myocarditis and/or pericarditis were identified among\napproximately 115 000 service members who were revaccinated.\nAmong the approximately 365 000 vaccinated military service\nmembers, one death has been reported.\nThe 14 patients with myocarditis and/or pericarditis ranged in age\nfrom 21 to 33 years. Severity ranged from mild (no ECG or\nechocardiogram changes) to severe (congestive heart failure), with\nonset 7 to 19 days after vaccination. All military patients were\nhospitalized, and all survived. As of 2 Apr 2003, the patient with\nthe most severe case has been hospitalized for 6 days. All other\nhospitalized patients have been discharged; they have either\nreturned to duty or are on short-term convalescent leave. Following\nare 2 cases that represent the spectrum of clinical presentations of\nmyopericarditis and a report of a fatal case of myocardial infarction.\nCase 1. On 18 Mar 2003, a man aged 22 years sought medical care\nat a military health clinic for chest pain 12 days after primary\nsmallpox vaccination. He was treated with nonsteroidal anti-\ninflammatory agents for presumed costochondritis. When laboratory\ntests revealed elevated cardiac enzymes levels, he was referred to a\nuniversity hospital emergency department (ED) for further\nevaluation. Cardiac enzymes levels remained elevated, but an ECG,\nechocardiogram, and cardiac stress test were normal.\nMyopericarditis was diagnosed, and he was released that day in\ngood condition.\nCase 2. A man aged 29 years had ILI symptoms during the same\nweek of primary smallpox vaccination. At the time of smallpox\nvaccination on 8 Mar 2003, he also received 5 other inactivated\nvaccines; 19 days after vaccination, he sought treatment at an ED\nfor dyspnea while lying flat. On 28 Mar 2003, he was hospitalized\nand had myopericarditis diagnosed based on ECG findings and\nelevated troponin I and CK-MB. The next day, he had pulmonary\nedema with a pulmonary artery wedge pressure of 38 mmHg that\nresponded well to several doses of intravenous diuretics. Serial\nechocardiograms showed ejection fractions as low as 25 percent\nthat subsequently improved to 45 percent (normal: >55 percent).\nEndomyocardial biopsy revealed active myocarditis with a mixed\ninfiltrate of lymphocytes and eosinophils and evidence of\neosinophilic degranulation in proximity to myocyte necrosis. PCR\ntesting of myocardial tissue was negative for vaccinia virus DNA,\nvaricella-zoster virus DNA, and herpes simplex virus DNA;\nreverse transcriptase PCR was negative for enterovirus RNA. As of\n2 Apr 2003, he remained hospitalized but was stable and improving.\nCase 3. On 25 Mar 2003, an Army National Guardsman aged 55\nyears with a history of smoking and treatment for hyperlipidemia\nwas found unresponsive in a vehicle 5 days after receiving smallpox\nvaccine and 2 other inactivated vaccines. He was resuscitated but\ndied the next day. Autopsy showed acute thrombosis of the right\nanterior descending coronary artery, 3-vessel coronary artery\ndisease with 75-80 percent occlusion, left ventricular hypertrophy,\nand cardiomegaly. Histopathology of left ventricular myocardium\nrevealed no evidence of myocarditis or pericarditis. Virologic testing\nof myocardium is pending. The cause of death was acute\nmyocardial infarction.\nUpdate on Adverse Events in the Civilian Vaccination Program\n-----------------------------------------\nAs of 30 Mar 2003, no cases of several potentially life-threatening\nadverse events associated historically with smallpox vaccination\n(i.e., progressive vaccinia, eczema vaccinatum, post-vaccinial\nencephalitis, or encephalomyelitis) have been reported among\ncivilians. In addition, no cases of vaccinia transmission from\ncivilians have been reported. This includes no transmission from 18\n344 members of health-care teams, 6655 of whom have been\nfollowed for longer than 1 month.\nDuring 11-30 Mar 2003, 6 cases of generalized vaccinia, 14 cases\nof inadvertent inoculation (nonocular), and 4 cases of\nmyopericarditis were reported (Table 2:\n<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5213a4.htm>).\nDuring the same period, 12 other serious adverse events were\nreported. Of these, 4 were myocardial infarctions, and 2 were cases\nof angina (Table 3:\n<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5213a4.htm>).\nThe remaining 6 other new serious adverse events had hospital\ndischarge diagnoses of pancreatic cancer, urinary tract infection,\nherpes zoster virus infection, headache, and facial paralysis with\nparesthesias (Table 3). Among the 192 vaccinees with reported\nother nonserious adverse events during 24 Jan 2003-30 Mar 2003\n(Table 3), the most common signs and symptoms were fever (n =\n42), rash (n = 39), headache (n = 34), and pruritus (n = 32). All of\nthese commonly reported events are consistent with mild expected\nreactions after receipt of smallpox vaccine. Some vaccinees\nreported multiple signs and symptoms. During 11-30 Mar 2003, no\nvaccinia immune globulin was released for civilian vaccinees (Table\n4: <http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5213a4.htm>).\nSurveillance for adverse events during the civilian and military\nsmallpox vaccination programs is ongoing; regular surveillance\nreports will be published in MMWR.\nMMWR Editorial Note:\n--------------------\nNew reports of myopericarditis following smallpox vaccination are\nconsistent with previous reports describing a potential causal\nassociation between vaccination and myopericarditis (1).

The most critical measure in preventing\ncontact transmission is consistent hand hygiene. Hospitals should\ndesignate staff to assess dressings for all vaccinated health-care\nworkers. When feasible, staff responsible for dressing changes for\nsmallpox health-care teams should be vaccinated; all persons handling\ndressings should observe contact precautions. Administrative leave is\nnot required routinely for newly vaccinated health-care personnel,\nunless they are physically unable to work as a result of systemic\nsigns and symptoms of illness; have extensive skin lesions that\ncannot be adequately covered; or if they are unable to adhere to the\nrecommended infection-control precautions.

Persons outside the\npatient-care setting can keep their vaccination sites covered with a\nporous dressing; hand hygiene remains key to preventing inadvertent\ninoculation.\"\nThere is no mention of hair removal around the vaccination site\n(either clipping or shaving) to facilitate barrier dressing adhesion.\nGiven this, it seems as though the most appropriate interpretation of\nthis situation would be found in the section related to indications\nfor administrative leave \"...if they are unable to adhere to the\nrecommended infection-control precautions.\"\n<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/m2d226.htm>\nIn any event, the failure of the protective dressing to adhere should\nbe of significant concern to health care workers in contact with\npatients who may have increased risk factors for severe disease,\nabove and beyond the general concerns about contact with others and\nthe possibility of contact vaccinial infection.\n1.

However, the current\nbody of literature is unclear on the duration of immunity; the\ncommonly accepted duration is 10 years, but current studies are few.\nFrelinger and Garba (ref 1 below) reported that 13/14 subjects\nstudied had detectable antibody 35 or more years after last known\nexposure to smallpox vaccine. A study by Suari et al. in Maryland\ninvolved 621 subjects and concluded that approximately 75 percent of\nhis population had no evidence of residual immunity as defined by\n\"take rate\" following revaccination (ref 3 below). A study by Frey\net al. (ref 2 below) of 680 never-vaccinated individuals, while\naddressing the issue of dilution of vaccine dose, noted that 5.7\npercent (37) of vaccinees had rashes at sites other than the\nvaccination site on days 7,8, and 9 and 10.1 percent (67) on day\n10,11, or 12 with an overall 14.3 percent (95) having a rash at a\nsite other than the vaccination site.\nThis moderator cannot address the question of how other centers with\nimmunosuppressed populations are interpreting this contraindication\nbut can only guess that there are significant concerns, especially\ngiven the high level of \"unknowns\" at present.

As routine immunizations were discontinued in the USA\nin 1972, and worldwide in 1982, the numbers of immunosuppressed\npersons who were potentially exposed to recently vaccinated\nindividuals was significantly lower than today (in the general\npublic), and definitely lower than patient populations in the\nhospital institutional setting.\nThere is a good summary of the data from Lane's papers on smallpox\nvaccination adverse effects at:\n<http://www.bt.cdc.gov/agent/smallpox/vaccine-safety/adverse-events-chart.asp>\n(1.

Lane JM, Ruben FL, Neff JM, Millar JD. Complications of smallpox\nvaccination, 1968: results of ten statewide surveys. J Infect Dis\n1970;122:303-309. )\nThe numbers of inadvertent inoculations per 1 000 000 vaccinees cited\nin the 2 studies were:\n(the primary vaccinees were predominantly infants less than one year of age):\nNATIONAL SURVEY (Ref 1 above)\nAll primary (i.e., first-time) vaccinees 25.4\nVaccinees greater than or equal to 1 year of age 27.1\n10-STATE SURVEY (Ref 2 above)\nAll primary (i.e., first-time) vaccinees 529.2\nVaccinees greater than or equal to 1 year of age 532.0\nThe last paragraph in the discussion is important: \"The authors of\nthe studies state that the national survey statistics should be\nconsidered minimal estimates of the risks of smallpox vaccination.\nThe authors assert, on the other hand, that a small number of\npatients included in the 10-state survey may have been vaccinated\nprior to or after 1968. Those rates, therefore, may overestimate\nslightly the true incidence of complications. Thus, when describing\nrates of the more severe smallpox vaccine adverse events in 1968\n(vaccinial encephalitis, vaccinia necrosum, and eczema vaccinatum),\nit appears to be preferable to use the range presented by the 2\nstudies. The 10-state survey data may present a better estimate of\nless severe adverse event rates from 1968 (generalized vaccinia and\naccidental autoinoculation).\"\nYes, there is a reported shorter duration of inoculation site\ninfection in those with pre-existing immunity. However, the current\nbody of literature is unclear on the duration of immunity; the\ncommonly accepted duration is 10 years, but current studies are few.\nFrelinger and Garba (ref 1 below) reported that 13/14 subjects\nstudied had detectable antibody 35 or more years after last known\nexposure to smallpox vaccine. A study by Suari et al. in Maryland\ninvolved 621 subjects and concluded that approximately 75 percent of\nhis population had no evidence of residual immunity as defined by\n\"take rate\" following revaccination (ref 3 below). A study by Frey\net al. (ref 2 below) of 680 never-vaccinated individuals, while\naddressing the issue of dilution of vaccine dose, noted that 5.7\npercent (37) of vaccinees had rashes at sites other than the\nvaccination site on days 7,8, and 9 and 10.1 percent (67) on day\n10,11, or 12 with an overall 14.3 percent (95) having a rash at a\nsite other than the vaccination site.\nThis moderator cannot address the question of how other centers with\nimmunosuppressed populations are interpreting this contraindication\nbut can only guess that there are significant concerns, especially\ngiven the high level of \"unknowns\" at present.

This\nmoderator chooses to preface a response with an acknowledgement that\ndefinitive answers are not easy to come by. Information and studies\non the adverse effects of smallpox vaccination are primarily from\ntimes of outbreaks and from the era when routine smallpox vaccination\nwas conducted. As routine immunizations were discontinued in the USA\nin 1972, and worldwide in 1982, the numbers of immunosuppressed\npersons who were potentially exposed to recently vaccinated\nindividuals was significantly lower than today (in the general\npublic), and definitely lower than patient populations in the\nhospital institutional setting.\nThere is a good summary of the data from Lane's papers on smallpox\nvaccination adverse effects at:\n<http://www.bt.cdc.gov/agent/smallpox/vaccine-safety/adverse-events-chart.asp>\n(1. Lane JM, Ruben FL, Neff JM, Millar JD. Complications of smallpox\nvaccinations, 1968: national surveillance in the United States. New\nEngl J Med 1969;281:1201-1208.\n2. Lane JM, Ruben FL, Neff JM, Millar JD. Complications of smallpox\nvaccination, 1968: results of ten statewide surveys. J Infect Dis\n1970;122:303-309. )\nThe numbers of inadvertent inoculations per 1 000 000 vaccinees cited\nin the 2 studies were:\n(the primary vaccinees were predominantly infants less than one year of age):\nNATIONAL SURVEY (Ref 1 above)\nAll primary (i.e., first-time) vaccinees 25.4\nVaccinees greater than or equal to 1 year of age 27.1\n10-STATE SURVEY (Ref 2 above)\nAll primary (i.e., first-time) vaccinees 529.2\nVaccinees greater than or equal to 1 year of age 532.0\nThe last paragraph in the discussion is important: \"The authors of\nthe studies state that the national survey statistics should be\nconsidered minimal estimates of the risks of smallpox vaccination.\nThe authors assert, on the other hand, that a small number of\npatients included in the 10-state survey may have been vaccinated\nprior to or after 1968. Those rates, therefore, may overestimate\nslightly the true incidence of complications. Thus, when describing\nrates of the more severe smallpox vaccine adverse events in 1968\n(vaccinial encephalitis, vaccinia necrosum, and eczema vaccinatum),\nit appears to be preferable to use the range presented by the 2\nstudies. The 10-state survey data may present a better estimate of\nless severe adverse event rates from 1968 (generalized vaccinia and\naccidental autoinoculation).\"\nYes, there is a reported shorter duration of inoculation site\ninfection in those with pre-existing immunity. However, the current\nbody of literature is unclear on the duration of immunity; the\ncommonly accepted duration is 10 years, but current studies are few.\nFrelinger and Garba (ref 1 below) reported that 13/14 subjects\nstudied had detectable antibody 35 or more years after last known\nexposure to smallpox vaccine. A study by Suari et al. in Maryland\ninvolved 621 subjects and concluded that approximately 75 percent of\nhis population had no evidence of residual immunity as defined by\n\"take rate\" following revaccination (ref 3 below). A study by Frey\net al. (ref 2 below) of 680 never-vaccinated individuals, while\naddressing the issue of dilution of vaccine dose, noted that 5.7\npercent (37) of vaccinees had rashes at sites other than the\nvaccination site on days 7,8, and 9 and 10.1 percent (67) on day\n10,11, or 12 with an overall 14.3 percent (95) having a rash at a\nsite other than the vaccination site.\nThis moderator cannot address the question of how other centers with\nimmunosuppressed populations are interpreting this contraindication\nbut can only guess that there are significant concerns, especially\ngiven the high level of \"unknowns\" at present.

But the final decision rests with President Bush, and a White\nHouse spokesman said the issue was still under review.\nThe health officials, who included Dr Julie L Gerberding, director of the\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), outlined a strategy that\ncould go far beyond what they were considering just a few months ago, when\nthey were talking about offering the vaccine to 500 000 health care workers\nfacing the greatest risk of handling a smallpox case. \"Right now our\nthinking is in favor of making the vaccine available to the general public\nafter we have insured that we can adequately immunize health care\nprofessionals,\" Dr Gerberding said. She cautioned that the officials were\nnot recommending that Americans take the vaccine, but rather that they have\nthe option of weighing the risks and benefits for themselves. \"No one\nbelieves we should make it available to the general public right now,\" Dr\nGerberding said.\nAt a news conference, officials also announced that one million doses of\nsmallpox vaccine will be provided to the military. The recommendations were\npresented to President Bush by the secretary of health and human services,\nTommy G Thompson, the officials said. A spokesman for the White House today\ndeclined to discuss the issue. \"It is under review,\" said Scott McClellan,\nthe president's deputy press secretary. \"There are still a number of issues\nthat need to be addressed before any final decision is made.\"\nThe government halted routine vaccinations in 1972 as the disease was being\neradicated from the world. But the terrorism attacks last year and the\npossibility that Iraq or other hostile nations might have the virus have\ncaused health officials to consider a new battle against the disease.\nLast week, officials gave guidelines to the states on how to be prepared\npossibly to vaccinate the entire country in the event a case of smallpox\nappears. Today's briefing focused entirely on vaccinations before such a\ncase occurs. \"We are still in an environment where we have no imminent\nthreat,\" Dr Gerberding said. \"But there are countries with weapons of mass\ndestruction that probably include smallpox.\"\nSmallpox vaccine, which is made from a live virus related to the one that\ncauses smallpox, is considered the most dangerous immunization. The\ngovernment owns all American stocks of smallpox vaccine, and because none\nare licensed now, all are classified as \"investigational.\" When the vaccine\nwas used, \"life-threatening complications\" occurred at a rate of 15 per\nmillion among those who received their first smallpox vaccination, and the\nnumber included 1 or 2 deaths, said Dr Gerberding. The rates would be lower\namong those who were re-vaccinated, Dr Gerberding said. But, she added,\n\"how much lower, we don't know.\" The vaccine can also cause many\nnon-life-threatening complications such as blindness.\nBetween 30 million and 50 million Americans might be disqualified from\ngetting the vaccine because their immune systems have been weakened by\ncancer, AIDS, or other diseases, or because they have two common skin\nconditions, eczema and atopic dermatitis, which increase the risk of\ncomplications.\nThe comments from Dr Gerberding and other officials were made in what was\nmeant to be a background briefing on various aspects of smallpox. The\nparticipants often had to clarify confusion that they had created in their\nremarks. Much of the confusion centered on which people would get\nvaccinated. One option, the health officials said, is a plan whereby\nvaccinations would expand to a growing number of health and emergency\nworkers. Under one plan, health officials would start by offering\nvaccinations to about 500 000 workers who would be most at risk of\nencountering any smallpox cases in hospitals. Another option would be to\nconsider expanding the 500 000 vaccinations to all the nation's estimated\n10 million health care and emergency workers, said Jerome M Hauer, an\nassistant secretary of health and human services and director of the\ndepartment's Office of Public Health Preparedness. After that, and\nfollowing licensing of what health officials hope will be a safer smallpox\nvaccine, they would offer it to the public.\nIn interviews after the briefing, officials outlined how their thinking had\nevolved since June 2002, when a panel of outside experts recommended\nagainst vaccinating all Americans. The panel, known as the Advisory\nCommittee on Immunization Practices, rejected a proposal to offer smallpox\nvaccinations to the general public. It recommended limiting vaccinations to\nhealth care and emergency workers who were likely to be \"first responders\"\nto a bioterror attack. The panel's chairman estimated 15 000 people would\nbe inoculated.\nIt fell to Mr Thompson's bioterrorism advisers, including Mr Hauer, Dr\nGerberding, and Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of\nAllergy and Infectious Diseases, to review the panel's report and then make\ntheir own recommendations. They began, Mr. Hauer said, by convening a\nseries of meetings with state health officials, doctors and hospital\nexecutives. Those meetings, he said, led them to decide that they should\npresent the president with options to expand vaccinations to all health\nprofessionals and law enforcement people, and eventually to all Americans\nwho want the vaccine. \"Our recommendation was that a phased approach be\nused, starting with 500 000 and then moving in steps to 10 million,\" Mr\nHauer said. But if necessary, he added, the 10 million could be given in\none step.\nDr Gerberding said, in the absence of a smallpox attack, or the imminent\nthreat of one, she still felt the vaccine's benefits did not outweigh its\nrisks for the general public. But, she said: \"We recognize that individual\ncitizens feel that if they understand the risks and benefits of the\nvaccine, they may choose to have it.\"\nAccording to another administration official, vice president Dick Cheney\nfavors a mass vaccination approach, while Mr Bush favors a more moderate\napproach.\n(byline: Lawrence K Altman and Sheryl Gay Stolberg)\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[The last ProMED-mail posting on the USA smallpox vaccination strategies\n(Smallpox vaccination strategies - USA (05) 20020924.5390 ) was a detailed\nanalysis of the vaccination strategy proposed for states in the event of\nintroduction of smallpox into the United States. At that time this\nmoderator made the following comments:\n\"These articles have done an excellent job of presenting many of the\ncontroversies and questions surrounding the plan as released as well as\ngeneral controversies and questions surrounding the use of smallpox vaccine\nin the United States, especially in an environment and population that have\nchanged from when our data on the risks of the vaccine were produced.\nProMED has been covering this controversy, and subscribers are encouraged\nto read our prior postings for more detailed discussions on the concerns\nsurrounding smallpox vaccination. In a nutshell, the current vaccine\navailable for prevention of smallpox is one of our more dangerous vaccines\nin terms of associated serious side-effects and death. In the face of a\nreal threat of smallpox, with introduction of the wild virus into the\ngeneral population, the risk of the disease will far outweigh the risk of\ncomplications from the vaccination. A disease that carries a mortality of\n30 per cent or more with a high level of morbidity for survivors, clearly\nis more dangerous than the vaccine.

But the final decision rests with President Bush, and a White\nHouse spokesman said the issue was still under review.\nThe health officials, who included Dr Julie L Gerberding, director of the\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), outlined a strategy that\ncould go far beyond what they were considering just a few months ago, when\nthey were talking about offering the vaccine to 500 000 health care workers\nfacing the greatest risk of handling a smallpox case. \"Right now our\nthinking is in favor of making the vaccine available to the general public\nafter we have insured that we can adequately immunize health care\nprofessionals,\" Dr Gerberding said. She cautioned that the officials were\nnot recommending that Americans take the vaccine, but rather that they have\nthe option of weighing the risks and benefits for themselves. \"No one\nbelieves we should make it available to the general public right now,\" Dr\nGerberding said.\nAt a news conference, officials also announced that one million doses of\nsmallpox vaccine will be provided to the military. The recommendations were\npresented to President Bush by the secretary of health and human services,\nTommy G Thompson, the officials said. A spokesman for the White House today\ndeclined to discuss the issue. \"It is under review,\" said Scott McClellan,\nthe president's deputy press secretary. \"There are still a number of issues\nthat need to be addressed before any final decision is made.\"\nThe government halted routine vaccinations in 1972 as the disease was being\neradicated from the world. But the terrorism attacks last year and the\npossibility that Iraq or other hostile nations might have the virus have\ncaused health officials to consider a new battle against the disease.\nLast week, officials gave guidelines to the states on how to be prepared\npossibly to vaccinate the entire country in the event a case of smallpox\nappears. Today's briefing focused entirely on vaccinations before such a\ncase occurs. \"We are still in an environment where we have no imminent\nthreat,\" Dr Gerberding said. \"But there are countries with weapons of mass\ndestruction that probably include smallpox.\"\nSmallpox vaccine, which is made from a live virus related to the one that\ncauses smallpox, is considered the most dangerous immunization. The\ngovernment owns all American stocks of smallpox vaccine, and because none\nare licensed now, all are classified as \"investigational.\" When the vaccine\nwas used, \"life-threatening complications\" occurred at a rate of 15 per\nmillion among those who received their first smallpox vaccination, and the\nnumber included 1 or 2 deaths, said Dr Gerberding. The rates would be lower\namong those who were re-vaccinated, Dr Gerberding said. But, she added,\n\"how much lower, we don't know.\" The vaccine can also cause many\nnon-life-threatening complications such as blindness.\nBetween 30 million and 50 million Americans might be disqualified from\ngetting the vaccine because their immune systems have been weakened by\ncancer, AIDS, or other diseases, or because they have two common skin\nconditions, eczema and atopic dermatitis, which increase the risk of\ncomplications.\nThe comments from Dr Gerberding and other officials were made in what was\nmeant to be a background briefing on various aspects of smallpox. The\nparticipants often had to clarify confusion that they had created in their\nremarks. Much of the confusion centered on which people would get\nvaccinated. One option, the health officials said, is a plan whereby\nvaccinations would expand to a growing number of health and emergency\nworkers. Under one plan, health officials would start by offering\nvaccinations to about 500 000 workers who would be most at risk of\nencountering any smallpox cases in hospitals. Another option would be to\nconsider expanding the 500 000 vaccinations to all the nation's estimated\n10 million health care and emergency workers, said Jerome M Hauer, an\nassistant secretary of health and human services and director of the\ndepartment's Office of Public Health Preparedness. After that, and\nfollowing licensing of what health officials hope will be a safer smallpox\nvaccine, they would offer it to the public.\nIn interviews after the briefing, officials outlined how their thinking had\nevolved since June 2002, when a panel of outside experts recommended\nagainst vaccinating all Americans. The panel, known as the Advisory\nCommittee on Immunization Practices, rejected a proposal to offer smallpox\nvaccinations to the general public. It recommended limiting vaccinations to\nhealth care and emergency workers who were likely to be \"first responders\"\nto a bioterror attack. The panel's chairman estimated 15 000 people would\nbe inoculated.\nIt fell to Mr Thompson's bioterrorism advisers, including Mr Hauer, Dr\nGerberding, and Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of\nAllergy and Infectious Diseases, to review the panel's report and then make\ntheir own recommendations. They began, Mr. Hauer said, by convening a\nseries of meetings with state health officials, doctors and hospital\nexecutives. Those meetings, he said, led them to decide that they should\npresent the president with options to expand vaccinations to all health\nprofessionals and law enforcement people, and eventually to all Americans\nwho want the vaccine. \"Our recommendation was that a phased approach be\nused, starting with 500 000 and then moving in steps to 10 million,\" Mr\nHauer said. But if necessary, he added, the 10 million could be given in\none step.\nDr Gerberding said, in the absence of a smallpox attack, or the imminent\nthreat of one, she still felt the vaccine's benefits did not outweigh its\nrisks for the general public. But, she said: \"We recognize that individual\ncitizens feel that if they understand the risks and benefits of the\nvaccine, they may choose to have it.\"\nAccording to another administration official, vice president Dick Cheney\nfavors a mass vaccination approach, while Mr Bush favors a more moderate\napproach.\n(byline: Lawrence K Altman and Sheryl Gay Stolberg)\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[The last ProMED-mail posting on the USA smallpox vaccination strategies\n(Smallpox vaccination strategies - USA (05) 20020924.5390 ) was a detailed\nanalysis of the vaccination strategy proposed for states in the event of\nintroduction of smallpox into the United States. At that time this\nmoderator made the following comments:\n\"These articles have done an excellent job of presenting many of the\ncontroversies and questions surrounding the plan as released as well as\ngeneral controversies and questions surrounding the use of smallpox vaccine\nin the United States, especially in an environment and population that have\nchanged from when our data on the risks of the vaccine were produced.\nProMED has been covering this controversy, and subscribers are encouraged\nto read our prior postings for more detailed discussions on the concerns\nsurrounding smallpox vaccination.

But the final decision rests with President Bush, and a White\nHouse spokesman said the issue was still under review.\nThe health officials, who included Dr Julie L Gerberding, director of the\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), outlined a strategy that\ncould go far beyond what they were considering just a few months ago, when\nthey were talking about offering the vaccine to 500 000 health care workers\nfacing the greatest risk of handling a smallpox case. \"Right now our\nthinking is in favor of making the vaccine available to the general public\nafter we have insured that we can adequately immunize health care\nprofessionals,\" Dr Gerberding said. She cautioned that the officials were\nnot recommending that Americans take the vaccine, but rather that they have\nthe option of weighing the risks and benefits for themselves. \"No one\nbelieves we should make it available to the general public right now,\" Dr\nGerberding said.\nAt a news conference, officials also announced that one million doses of\nsmallpox vaccine will be provided to the military. The recommendations were\npresented to President Bush by the secretary of health and human services,\nTommy G Thompson, the officials said. A spokesman for the White House today\ndeclined to discuss the issue. \"It is under review,\" said Scott McClellan,\nthe president's deputy press secretary. \"There are still a number of issues\nthat need to be addressed before any final decision is made.\"\nThe government halted routine vaccinations in 1972 as the disease was being\neradicated from the world. But the terrorism attacks last year and the\npossibility that Iraq or other hostile nations might have the virus have\ncaused health officials to consider a new battle against the disease.\nLast week, officials gave guidelines to the states on how to be prepared\npossibly to vaccinate the entire country in the event a case of smallpox\nappears. Today's briefing focused entirely on vaccinations before such a\ncase occurs. \"We are still in an environment where we have no imminent\nthreat,\" Dr Gerberding said. \"But there are countries with weapons of mass\ndestruction that probably include smallpox.\"\nSmallpox vaccine, which is made from a live virus related to the one that\ncauses smallpox, is considered the most dangerous immunization. The\ngovernment owns all American stocks of smallpox vaccine, and because none\nare licensed now, all are classified as \"investigational.\" When the vaccine\nwas used, \"life-threatening complications\" occurred at a rate of 15 per\nmillion among those who received their first smallpox vaccination, and the\nnumber included 1 or 2 deaths, said Dr Gerberding. The rates would be lower\namong those who were re-vaccinated, Dr Gerberding said. But, she added,\n\"how much lower, we don't know.\" The vaccine can also cause many\nnon-life-threatening complications such as blindness.\nBetween 30 million and 50 million Americans might be disqualified from\ngetting the vaccine because their immune systems have been weakened by\ncancer, AIDS, or other diseases, or because they have two common skin\nconditions, eczema and atopic dermatitis, which increase the risk of\ncomplications.\nThe comments from Dr Gerberding and other officials were made in what was\nmeant to be a background briefing on various aspects of smallpox. The\nparticipants often had to clarify confusion that they had created in their\nremarks. Much of the confusion centered on which people would get\nvaccinated. One option, the health officials said, is a plan whereby\nvaccinations would expand to a growing number of health and emergency\nworkers. Under one plan, health officials would start by offering\nvaccinations to about 500 000 workers who would be most at risk of\nencountering any smallpox cases in hospitals. Another option would be to\nconsider expanding the 500 000 vaccinations to all the nation's estimated\n10 million health care and emergency workers, said Jerome M Hauer, an\nassistant secretary of health and human services and director of the\ndepartment's Office of Public Health Preparedness. After that, and\nfollowing licensing of what health officials hope will be a safer smallpox\nvaccine, they would offer it to the public.\nIn interviews after the briefing, officials outlined how their thinking had\nevolved since June 2002, when a panel of outside experts recommended\nagainst vaccinating all Americans. The panel, known as the Advisory\nCommittee on Immunization Practices, rejected a proposal to offer smallpox\nvaccinations to the general public. It recommended limiting vaccinations to\nhealth care and emergency workers who were likely to be \"first responders\"\nto a bioterror attack. The panel's chairman estimated 15 000 people would\nbe inoculated.\nIt fell to Mr Thompson's bioterrorism advisers, including Mr Hauer, Dr\nGerberding, and Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of\nAllergy and Infectious Diseases, to review the panel's report and then make\ntheir own recommendations. They began, Mr. Hauer said, by convening a\nseries of meetings with state health officials, doctors and hospital\nexecutives. Those meetings, he said, led them to decide that they should\npresent the president with options to expand vaccinations to all health\nprofessionals and law enforcement people, and eventually to all Americans\nwho want the vaccine. \"Our recommendation was that a phased approach be\nused, starting with 500 000 and then moving in steps to 10 million,\" Mr\nHauer said. But if necessary, he added, the 10 million could be given in\none step.\nDr Gerberding said, in the absence of a smallpox attack, or the imminent\nthreat of one, she still felt the vaccine's benefits did not outweigh its\nrisks for the general public. But, she said: \"We recognize that individual\ncitizens feel that if they understand the risks and benefits of the\nvaccine, they may choose to have it.\"\nAccording to another administration official, vice president Dick Cheney\nfavors a mass vaccination approach, while Mr Bush favors a more moderate\napproach.\n(byline: Lawrence K Altman and Sheryl Gay Stolberg)\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[The last ProMED-mail posting on the USA smallpox vaccination strategies\n(Smallpox vaccination strategies - USA (05) 20020924.5390 ) was a detailed\nanalysis of the vaccination strategy proposed for states in the event of\nintroduction of smallpox into the United States. At that time this\nmoderator made the following comments:\n\"These articles have done an excellent job of presenting many of the\ncontroversies and questions surrounding the plan as released as well as\ngeneral controversies and questions surrounding the use of smallpox vaccine\nin the United States, especially in an environment and population that have\nchanged from when our data on the risks of the vaccine were produced.\nProMED has been covering this controversy, and subscribers are encouraged\nto read our prior postings for more detailed discussions on the concerns\nsurrounding smallpox vaccination. In a nutshell, the current vaccine\navailable for prevention of smallpox is one of our more dangerous vaccines\nin terms of associated serious side-effects and death. In the face of a\nreal threat of smallpox, with introduction of the wild virus into the\ngeneral population, the risk of the disease will far outweigh the risk of\ncomplications from the vaccination. A disease that carries a mortality of\n30 per cent or more with a high level of morbidity for survivors, clearly\nis more dangerous than the vaccine. The controversy is centered upon the\nrisk-benefit analysis of use of the vaccine when the risk of disease from\nthe wild virus is theoretical/hypothetical, while the risk of the vaccine\nis real. Current supplies of vaccinia immune globulin (VIG -- used for\ntreatment of severe complications following smallpox vaccination) are\ninsufficient for widespread vaccination activities, and the use of\nantiviral agents for treatment of serious complications of the vaccine is\nless than ideal in terms of knowledge of efficacy of treatment and safety\nissues surrounding the use of the drugs. While not a scientific conclusion,\none hopes that we will have the luxury of time for further research and\ndevelopment of a newer, safer vaccine, increased production of VIG, and\nfurther research on the safety and efficacy of antiviral agents to be used\nfor both complications of vaccination (vaccinial infections) and for the\nactual disease.\"\nIt would be of interest to hear the opinions of members of the Advisory\nCommittee on Immunizations to see whether there has been sufficient new\nscientific information available since the recommendations were made on 20\nJun 2002 not to embark on widespread vaccinations, but rather to limit\nvaccinations to a small handful of first responders.\nReviewing the ongoing discussions leads an academically inclined individual\nto conclude that the current process of development of vaccination\nstrategies for the use of smallpox vaccine in the USA will make an\nexcellent case study in the politics of health for an MPH course. - Mod.MPP]\nSee Also\nSmallpox vaccination strategies - USA (05) 20020924.5390\nSmallpox vaccination strategies - USA (04) 20020923.5383\nSmallpox vaccination strategies - USA (03) 20020915.5312\nSmallpox vaccination strategy - Israel 20020820.5095\nSmallpox vaccine hazards 20020817.5080\nSmallpox vaccination strategies - USA (02) 20020726.4868\nSmallpox containment strategies - USA 20020711.4725\nSmallpox vaccination (02) 20020710.4715\nSmallpox vaccination strategies - USA 20020709.4710\nSmallpox vaccine, ACIP recommendations - USA (02) 20020621.4560\nSmallpox vaccine, ACIP recommendations - USA 20020620.4542\nSmallpox vaccination 20020611.4468\n2001\n---\nSmallpox, bioterrorism response plan - USA (06) 20011202.2936\nSmallpox, bioterrorism response plan - USA (05) 20011201.2926\nSmallpox vaccine, supply - USA 20011130.2915\nSmallpox, bioterrorism response plan - USA 20011127.2898\nSmallpox, diluted vaccine trial (04) 20011123.2870\nSmallpox, diluted vaccine trial 20011117.2827\nSmallpox, re-vaccination & immunity (04) 20011107.2765\nSmallpox, re-vaccination & immunity 20011029.2672\nSmallpox vaccine, WHO statement (02) 20011027.2649\nSmallpox vaccine, WHO statement 20011025.2641\nSmallpox vaccine, ACIP recommendations 2001 20010623.1190\nSmallpox vaccine recommendations - USA: update 20010226.0378\n..........................lm/mpp/pg/sh\n*##########################################################*\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.

But the terrorism attacks last year and the\npossibility that Iraq or other hostile nations might have the virus have\ncaused health officials to consider a new battle against the disease.\nLast week, officials gave guidelines to the states on how to be prepared\npossibly to vaccinate the entire country in the event a case of smallpox\nappears. Today's briefing focused entirely on vaccinations before such a\ncase occurs. \"We are still in an environment where we have no imminent\nthreat,\" Dr Gerberding said. \"But there are countries with weapons of mass\ndestruction that probably include smallpox.\"\nSmallpox vaccine, which is made from a live virus related to the one that\ncauses smallpox, is considered the most dangerous immunization. The\ngovernment owns all American stocks of smallpox vaccine, and because none\nare licensed now, all are classified as \"investigational.\" When the vaccine\nwas used, \"life-threatening complications\" occurred at a rate of 15 per\nmillion among those who received their first smallpox vaccination, and the\nnumber included 1 or 2 deaths, said Dr Gerberding. The rates would be lower\namong those who were re-vaccinated, Dr Gerberding said. But, she added,\n\"how much lower, we don't know.\" The vaccine can also cause many\nnon-life-threatening complications such as blindness.\nBetween 30 million and 50 million Americans might be disqualified from\ngetting the vaccine because their immune systems have been weakened by\ncancer, AIDS, or other diseases, or because they have two common skin\nconditions, eczema and atopic dermatitis, which increase the risk of\ncomplications.\nThe comments from Dr Gerberding and other officials were made in what was\nmeant to be a background briefing on various aspects of smallpox. The\nparticipants often had to clarify confusion that they had created in their\nremarks. Much of the confusion centered on which people would get\nvaccinated. One option, the health officials said, is a plan whereby\nvaccinations would expand to a growing number of health and emergency\nworkers. Under one plan, health officials would start by offering\nvaccinations to about 500 000 workers who would be most at risk of\nencountering any smallpox cases in hospitals. Another option would be to\nconsider expanding the 500 000 vaccinations to all the nation's estimated\n10 million health care and emergency workers, said Jerome M Hauer, an\nassistant secretary of health and human services and director of the\ndepartment's Office of Public Health Preparedness. After that, and\nfollowing licensing of what health officials hope will be a safer smallpox\nvaccine, they would offer it to the public.\nIn interviews after the briefing, officials outlined how their thinking had\nevolved since June 2002, when a panel of outside experts recommended\nagainst vaccinating all Americans. The panel, known as the Advisory\nCommittee on Immunization Practices, rejected a proposal to offer smallpox\nvaccinations to the general public. It recommended limiting vaccinations to\nhealth care and emergency workers who were likely to be \"first responders\"\nto a bioterror attack. The panel's chairman estimated 15 000 people would\nbe inoculated.\nIt fell to Mr Thompson's bioterrorism advisers, including Mr Hauer, Dr\nGerberding, and Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of\nAllergy and Infectious Diseases, to review the panel's report and then make\ntheir own recommendations. They began, Mr. Hauer said, by convening a\nseries of meetings with state health officials, doctors and hospital\nexecutives. Those meetings, he said, led them to decide that they should\npresent the president with options to expand vaccinations to all health\nprofessionals and law enforcement people, and eventually to all Americans\nwho want the vaccine. \"Our recommendation was that a phased approach be\nused, starting with 500 000 and then moving in steps to 10 million,\" Mr\nHauer said. But if necessary, he added, the 10 million could be given in\none step.\nDr Gerberding said, in the absence of a smallpox attack, or the imminent\nthreat of one, she still felt the vaccine's benefits did not outweigh its\nrisks for the general public. But, she said: \"We recognize that individual\ncitizens feel that if they understand the risks and benefits of the\nvaccine, they may choose to have it.\"\nAccording to another administration official, vice president Dick Cheney\nfavors a mass vaccination approach, while Mr Bush favors a more moderate\napproach.\n(byline: Lawrence K Altman and Sheryl Gay Stolberg)\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[The last ProMED-mail posting on the USA smallpox vaccination strategies\n(Smallpox vaccination strategies - USA (05) 20020924.5390 ) was a detailed\nanalysis of the vaccination strategy proposed for states in the event of\nintroduction of smallpox into the United States. At that time this\nmoderator made the following comments:\n\"These articles have done an excellent job of presenting many of the\ncontroversies and questions surrounding the plan as released as well as\ngeneral controversies and questions surrounding the use of smallpox vaccine\nin the United States, especially in an environment and population that have\nchanged from when our data on the risks of the vaccine were produced.\nProMED has been covering this controversy, and subscribers are encouraged\nto read our prior postings for more detailed discussions on the concerns\nsurrounding smallpox vaccination. In a nutshell, the current vaccine\navailable for prevention of smallpox is one of our more dangerous vaccines\nin terms of associated serious side-effects and death. In the face of a\nreal threat of smallpox, with introduction of the wild virus into the\ngeneral population, the risk of the disease will far outweigh the risk of\ncomplications from the vaccination. A disease that carries a mortality of\n30 per cent or more with a high level of morbidity for survivors, clearly\nis more dangerous than the vaccine. The controversy is centered upon the\nrisk-benefit analysis of use of the vaccine when the risk of disease from\nthe wild virus is theoretical/hypothetical, while the risk of the vaccine\nis real. Current supplies of vaccinia immune globulin (VIG -- used for\ntreatment of severe complications following smallpox vaccination) are\ninsufficient for widespread vaccination activities, and the use of\nantiviral agents for treatment of serious complications of the vaccine is\nless than ideal in terms of knowledge of efficacy of treatment and safety\nissues surrounding the use of the drugs.

But the final decision rests with President Bush, and a White\nHouse spokesman said the issue was still under review.\nThe health officials, who included Dr Julie L Gerberding, director of the\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), outlined a strategy that\ncould go far beyond what they were considering just a few months ago, when\nthey were talking about offering the vaccine to 500 000 health care workers\nfacing the greatest risk of handling a smallpox case. \"Right now our\nthinking is in favor of making the vaccine available to the general public\nafter we have insured that we can adequately immunize health care\nprofessionals,\" Dr Gerberding said. She cautioned that the officials were\nnot recommending that Americans take the vaccine, but rather that they have\nthe option of weighing the risks and benefits for themselves. \"No one\nbelieves we should make it available to the general public right now,\" Dr\nGerberding said.\nAt a news conference, officials also announced that one million doses of\nsmallpox vaccine will be provided to the military.

But, she said: \"We recognize that individual\ncitizens feel that if they understand the risks and benefits of the\nvaccine, they may choose to have it.\"\nAccording to another administration official, vice president Dick Cheney\nfavors a mass vaccination approach, while Mr Bush favors a more moderate\napproach.\n(byline: Lawrence K Altman and Sheryl Gay Stolberg)\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[The last ProMED-mail posting on the USA smallpox vaccination strategies\n(Smallpox vaccination strategies - USA (05) 20020924.5390 ) was a detailed\nanalysis of the vaccination strategy proposed for states in the event of\nintroduction of smallpox into the United States. At that time this\nmoderator made the following comments:\n\"These articles have done an excellent job of presenting many of the\ncontroversies and questions surrounding the plan as released as well as\ngeneral controversies and questions surrounding the use of smallpox vaccine\nin the United States, especially in an environment and population that have\nchanged from when our data on the risks of the vaccine were produced.\nProMED has been covering this controversy, and subscribers are encouraged\nto read our prior postings for more detailed discussions on the concerns\nsurrounding smallpox vaccination. In a nutshell, the current vaccine\navailable for prevention of smallpox is one of our more dangerous vaccines\nin terms of associated serious side-effects and death. In the face of a\nreal threat of smallpox, with introduction of the wild virus into the\ngeneral population, the risk of the disease will far outweigh the risk of\ncomplications from the vaccination. A disease that carries a mortality of\n30 per cent or more with a high level of morbidity for survivors, clearly\nis more dangerous than the vaccine. The controversy is centered upon the\nrisk-benefit analysis of use of the vaccine when the risk of disease from\nthe wild virus is theoretical/hypothetical, while the risk of the vaccine\nis real. Current supplies of vaccinia immune globulin (VIG -- used for\ntreatment of severe complications following smallpox vaccination) are\ninsufficient for widespread vaccination activities, and the use of\nantiviral agents for treatment of serious complications of the vaccine is\nless than ideal in terms of knowledge of efficacy of treatment and safety\nissues surrounding the use of the drugs. While not a scientific conclusion,\none hopes that we will have the luxury of time for further research and\ndevelopment of a newer, safer vaccine, increased production of VIG, and\nfurther research on the safety and efficacy of antiviral agents to be used\nfor both complications of vaccination (vaccinial infections) and for the\nactual disease.\"\nIt would be of interest to hear the opinions of members of the Advisory\nCommittee on Immunizations to see whether there has been sufficient new\nscientific information available since the recommendations were made on 20\nJun 2002 not to embark on widespread vaccinations, but rather to limit\nvaccinations to a small handful of first responders.\nReviewing the ongoing discussions leads an academically inclined individual\nto conclude that the current process of development of vaccination\nstrategies for the use of smallpox vaccine in the USA will make an\nexcellent case study in the politics of health for an MPH course. - Mod.MPP]\nSee Also\nSmallpox vaccination strategies - USA (05) 20020924.5390\nSmallpox vaccination strategies - USA (04) 20020923.5383\nSmallpox vaccination strategies - USA (03) 20020915.5312\nSmallpox vaccination strategy - Israel 20020820.5095\nSmallpox vaccine hazards 20020817.5080\nSmallpox vaccination strategies - USA (02) 20020726.4868\nSmallpox containment strategies - USA 20020711.4725\nSmallpox vaccination (02) 20020710.4715\nSmallpox vaccination strategies - USA 20020709.4710\nSmallpox vaccine, ACIP recommendations - USA (02) 20020621.4560\nSmallpox vaccine, ACIP recommendations - USA 20020620.4542\nSmallpox vaccination 20020611.4468\n2001\n---\nSmallpox, bioterrorism response plan - USA (06) 20011202.2936\nSmallpox, bioterrorism response plan - USA (05) 20011201.2926\nSmallpox vaccine, supply - USA 20011130.2915\nSmallpox, bioterrorism response plan - USA 20011127.2898\nSmallpox, diluted vaccine trial (04) 20011123.2870\nSmallpox, diluted vaccine trial 20011117.2827\nSmallpox, re-vaccination & immunity (04) 20011107.2765\nSmallpox, re-vaccination & immunity 20011029.2672\nSmallpox vaccine, WHO statement (02) 20011027.2649\nSmallpox vaccine, WHO statement 20011025.2641\nSmallpox vaccine, ACIP recommendations 2001 20010623.1190\nSmallpox vaccine recommendations - USA: update 20010226.0378\n..........................lm/mpp/pg/sh\n*##########################################################*\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.

The case would be fairly easy because\nthe people would be in one place and health officials wouldn't have to\ntrack them down.\nStill, if the passengers weren't held for treatment, CDC experts estimate\nthat a plane filled with 500 people including one with smallpox could\nresult in dozens, maybe hundreds, of sick people, including passengers on\nthe plane who got sick and the people they would infect.\nThe vaccine is only effective within 4 days of someone being exposed to\nsmallpox, so if people leave the scene it would be difficult to find them\nin time.\nUnder the plan, officials would stress that people would be better off\nstaying in quarantine because that's where the vaccine and other\nmedications would be available. That's a big change from past centuries,\nwhen people in quarantine were written off, Cetron said.\n\"All the goodies will be delivered inside the box,\" he said. \"It's a\nfundamental difference to spend as much, if not more attention, on\nmonitoring and preserving the health on the people inside the box.\"\nOnce planning is complete for this scenario, the CDC group plans to tackle\nmore complicated situations, such as a smallpox patient in a sports stadium\nor an infected person wandering through an airport.\nSmallpox was declared eradicated in 1980, but samples of the deadly virus\nstill exist in both the United States and Russia. Bioterrorism experts\nconsider the possibility of a smallpox attack one of the most frightening,\nalbeit unlikely, threats because one infected patient could infect many others.\nRoutine immunizations against smallpox in the United States ended in 1972,\nmeaning many Americans have no protection against the disease. Federal\nofficials are now considering vaccinating as many as 500 000 health care\nworkers and emergency personnel who would be first to see any smallpox\ncase. But because the vaccine carries significant risks, including death,\nofficials do not want to resume mass vaccinations, a point President Bush\nmade Monday.\n\"I worry about calling for a national vaccination program and that it could\ncause a loss of life,\" Bush said at a White House news conference.\nRather, the plan is to vaccinate others only if they are exposed to the\nvirus, or exposed to someone who is exposed. Another alternative, one\nendorsed Monday in a study in the Proceedings of the National Academy of\nSciences, would be mass vaccinating all Americans if a smallpox case\nemerged. The authors of that study predicted significantly fewer people\nwould die using a mass vaccination strategy.\nThe airliner scenario is not entirely fictitious. In December 2001, a\nflight from Taiwan bound for Newark, N.J., was delayed for about 4 hours in\nSeattle after an anonymous tipster told U.S. Customs Service agents that a\npassenger had smallpox. It turned out to be a hoax, but the situation\nprovided a real-life example of how people on the plane reacted.\n\"People got really scared because they sat there on a plane for 2 hours\nwithout any idea what was going on,\" said Kristy Lillibridge, an\nepidemiologist who is part of the CDC working group.\nThe draft CDC plan calls for taking the airplane to a hangar or another\nfacility where passengers can get off without going into the airport, she\nsaid. The suspicious passenger would be isolated from the others, but\neveryone would be kept in quarantine while officials did tests to determine\nif the passenger was in fact infected with smallpox.\nStill unresolved: how long to keep people if a smallpox exposure is\nconfirmed. Options include one to 2 days, or long enough to give the shots;\n7 days, long enough to see if the vaccination worked; or 17 days, when no\none would be contagious anymore.\n\"It is such a sensitive topic. Those kinds of decisions, to actually use a\nquarantine, will be made at very high levels,\" Cetron said.\nOther elements of the plan, officials said, include:\n--If possible, diverting the flight to one of 8 international airports\nwhere the CDC has quarantine operations in place, or to another airport\nwhere the local public health authorities are prepared to handle the case.\n--Creating clear messages and announcements to deliver to passengers,\nincluding those that would be read by the pilot while they are still on the\nplane.\n--Providing beds, restrooms, food and access to medication for anyone in\nquarantine.\n[byline: Laura Meckler]\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[After the incident with the case of chickenpox on the flight from Taiwan\nto Newark, the need for a protocol for management of such an eventuality\nwas highlighted.

In the\nnot-so-distant past, quarantine was not felt to be a practical option,\nespecially for vaccine-preventable diseases. Given the high level of\nsusceptibility of the general population to smallpox now, in the\npost-vaccination era, and given the high mobility of individuals,\nrevisiting quarantine as an option is not far-fetched. The incubation\nperiod for smallpox ranges from 7-19 days; if a case is confirmed on an\nairline flight, logistics for the quarantine of all passengers for an\naverage of 21 days will have to be developed.

The case would be fairly easy because\nthe people would be in one place and health officials wouldn't have to\ntrack them down.\nStill, if the passengers weren't held for treatment, CDC experts estimate\nthat a plane filled with 500 people including one with smallpox could\nresult in dozens, maybe hundreds, of sick people, including passengers on\nthe plane who got sick and the people they would infect.\nThe vaccine is only effective within 4 days of someone being exposed to\nsmallpox, so if people leave the scene it would be difficult to find them\nin time.\nUnder the plan, officials would stress that people would be better off\nstaying in quarantine because that's where the vaccine and other\nmedications would be available. That's a big change from past centuries,\nwhen people in quarantine were written off, Cetron said.\n\"All the goodies will be delivered inside the box,\" he said. \"It's a\nfundamental difference to spend as much, if not more attention, on\nmonitoring and preserving the health on the people inside the box.\"\nOnce planning is complete for this scenario, the CDC group plans to tackle\nmore complicated situations, such as a smallpox patient in a sports stadium\nor an infected person wandering through an airport.\nSmallpox was declared eradicated in 1980, but samples of the deadly virus\nstill exist in both the United States and Russia.

The case would be fairly easy because\nthe people would be in one place and health officials wouldn't have to\ntrack them down.\nStill, if the passengers weren't held for treatment, CDC experts estimate\nthat a plane filled with 500 people including one with smallpox could\nresult in dozens, maybe hundreds, of sick people, including passengers on\nthe plane who got sick and the people they would infect.\nThe vaccine is only effective within 4 days of someone being exposed to\nsmallpox, so if people leave the scene it would be difficult to find them\nin time.\nUnder the plan, officials would stress that people would be better off\nstaying in quarantine because that's where the vaccine and other\nmedications would be available. That's a big change from past centuries,\nwhen people in quarantine were written off, Cetron said.\n\"All the goodies will be delivered inside the box,\" he said. \"It's a\nfundamental difference to spend as much, if not more attention, on\nmonitoring and preserving the health on the people inside the box.\"\nOnce planning is complete for this scenario, the CDC group plans to tackle\nmore complicated situations, such as a smallpox patient in a sports stadium\nor an infected person wandering through an airport.\nSmallpox was declared eradicated in 1980, but samples of the deadly virus\nstill exist in both the United States and Russia. Bioterrorism experts\nconsider the possibility of a smallpox attack one of the most frightening,\nalbeit unlikely, threats because one infected patient could infect many others.\nRoutine immunizations against smallpox in the United States ended in 1972,\nmeaning many Americans have no protection against the disease. Federal\nofficials are now considering vaccinating as many as 500 000 health care\nworkers and emergency personnel who would be first to see any smallpox\ncase. But because the vaccine carries significant risks, including death,\nofficials do not want to resume mass vaccinations, a point President Bush\nmade Monday.\n\"I worry about calling for a national vaccination program and that it could\ncause a loss of life,\" Bush said at a White House news conference.\nRather, the plan is to vaccinate others only if they are exposed to the\nvirus, or exposed to someone who is exposed.

It was cruising south of Vozrozhdenie Island at the end of July\n[1971] and we believe that at that time she was exposed to an aerosol that\nwas released over Vozrozhdenie Island, which was about 15 km away. When she\nreturned to her home in Aralsk she came down with symptoms of smallpox. She\npassed it on to her 9-year-old brother, who became rather sick, but both of\nthem survived,\" Zilinskas said. However, 3 others -- 2 babies, and the\nboy's teacher -- didn't. They died of hemorrhagic smallpox, a particularly\nvirulent form of the disease. In all, 10 people became ill with smallpox.\nThe 7 who survived, including the researcher and her brother, had received\nsmallpox vaccinations years earlier, while the 3 who died had not. The town\nwas closed. Mass vaccinations and quarantines followed.\nSmallpox was still occurring naturally in the 1970s, but the Monterey\nInstitute's researchers say evidence in the Aralsk case points strongly not\nto a natural outbreak or lab accident but to the testing of a smallpox\nbiological weapon on Vozrozhdenie. If the germs were airborne, this means\nthey were disseminated as an aerosol, and the fact that some of those\nstruck by the virus had already been vaccinated suggests, though not\nnecessarily proves, that the smallpox used was of a particularly virulent\nstrain.\nRetired General Petr Burgasov, once a top figure in the Soviet Union's\nbioweapons program, admitted in the \"Moscow News\" paper late last year\n[2001] that a smallpox test -- he did not specify a year -- had caused an\nunidentified number of civilian deaths. \"They were testing a strong strain\nof smallpox,\" Burgasov is quoted as saying in the \"Moscow News\" interview,\nwhich the Monterrey researchers cite in their report. \"Suddenly I'm told\nthat there are some unexplained deaths in Aralsk. A research boat had gone\nwithin 15 km of the island [it was banned from going closer than 40 km]; a\nwoman laboratory technician went twice a day on land to take plankton\nsamples. The smallpox agent -- and on the island all of 400 grams of the\nstrain was used -- 'got' her.\"\nZilinskas said his team's report is based on previously secret documents\ngiven to them by the Kazakh Scientific Center for Quarantine and Zoonotic\nDiseases. It is also based on interviews with 2 survivors, the woman and\nher younger brother. He acknowledged the data is patchy, but said the\n\"airborne germs\" theory is the most logical explanation of how the woman\nbecame infected. And he dismissed suggestions by skeptics that it could\nhave been a natural outbreak that traveled from Afghanistan. \"The problem\nwith that explanation is that there were no other cases in between. In\nother words, in Uzbekistan or Turkmenistan or any of these other countries\nyou'd have to transverse in order to get to Aralsk.

I take this opportunity to clear up a\nfew points.\nFirst, there is no suggestion in either the original report or in Dr.\nZelicoff's analysis that Soviet military scientists \"might have genetically\nengineered a smallpox virus.\" This was quite beyond their capabilities at\nthat time. If they had weaponized the smallpox virus, it would have been\ndone using classical techniques.\nSecond, the main implication of this event is that the Soviet Union was\nworking on weaponizing the smallpox virus since at least the late 1960s,\nand possibly earlier. The Western intelligence services did not learn of\nthis work until 1989, when the first defector from Biopreparat, Dr.\nVladimir Pasechnik, was debriefed and can be assumed to have provided this\ninformation. This means that Soviet military scientists, having had more\nthan 20 years to weaponize smallpox virus and supported by nearly unlimited\nfunds, certainly had plenty of opportunity to develop a strain of smallpox\nvirus that would exceed the pathogenic and virulence potentials of wild\nstrains. (Just think of what a high level scientific team at CDC or\nUSAMRIID could have accomplished if it had been given a similar mission!)\nGiven this history, it is of vital importance to global health security\nthat the Russian government provide information about smallpox strains that\nwere weaponized during the Soviet period so we can test our vaccines\nagainst them. This also means that the 3 closed Russian military biological\ninstitutes, including the Institute of Virology at Sergiyev Posad, must be\nopened up to foreign visitations.\nThird, given that the Soviet Union weaponized the smallpox virus and\nformulated it for use as an aerosol, it would be wise for government\nofficials now working on crafting a policy for meeting the threat of\nbioterrorism to take this into account. In other words, the common thinking\nis that were terrorists to acquire smallpox virus, they would disseminate\nit among a target population via infected individuals. In view of the\nSoviet work with smallpox, it is necessary for officials to also consider\nhow best to prepare for and respond to an attack that utilized aerosolized\nsmallpox virus.\n--\nRaymond A.

Zelicoff <apzelic@sandia.gov>\n\nRegarding the previously unknown outbreak of smallpox in 1971 in Aralsk\n(Soviet Union), I would like to augment Dr. Michael A. Sauri's assessment\n(posted on ProMED on 18 Jun 2002) of both the intent and content of my\npresentation at the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) last weekend.\n1. The key point that I was trying to make was that, for the first time, we\nnow have data that smallpox can indeed be aerosolized and propagated over\nlarge distances (many kilometers). Previously, smallpox experts stated that\nthis was simply not possible due to the environmental instability of the\nvirus. I am pleased to see that DA Henderson acknowledged this morning\nthat, indeed, smallpox can be \"hardened\" to so behave (see:\n<http://www.cnn.com/2002/HEALTH/conditions/06/20/smallpox.vaccine/index.html>)\nHe had previously asserted at the NAS meeting that this could not be done.\n2. The significance of this finding is its effect on all of the smallpox\npropagation models presented at the NAS. To illustrate with only one of the\nmodels (that of Dr. Ed Kaplan): the \"decision point\" for the strategy of\nmass vaccination vs. vaccination on warning or pre-attack vaccination of a\nselected group of people (physicians, public health officials, nurses,\ncritical infrastructure workers) depends MOST sensitively on the\n\"reproductive ratio\" of clinical smallpox (i.e., the number of people each\nperson with smallpox may go on to infect) AND the number of initial cases.\nIn Dr. Kaplan's model, if we assume that the reproductive ratio is less\nthan about 2 (a very conservative assumption according to what I've read\nfrom smallpox experts) and an initial number of cases less than about 30,\nthen mass vaccination is NOT the appropriate strategy (due to the side\neffects of the vaccine outweighing the benefits). However (and this is very\nimportant), if the number of index cases rises into the hundreds, then even\nwith a very much lower reproductive ratio (near \"1\"), mass vaccination IS\nthe appropriate strategy. Obviously an aerosol dissemination would create a\nsubstantially larger number of initial cases than would, say, introduction\nof some number of infected people into the US population. Thus, vaccination\nstrategy may change, given our existing vaccine.\n3. Repeatedly emphasizing at the NAS that the numbers (that we know about)\nin the Aralsk outbreak are small (10 total cases), I compared the apparent\nrate of transmissibility in those households where the data was available\nto the Pakistan outbreak, stratified by vaccination status of the household\nindex case (see: Heiner, G.G., Fatima, N., and McCrumb, F.R. \"A Study of\nIntrafamilial Transmission of Smallpox,\" American Journal of Epidemiology,\nvol. 94, pp. 252-268. also summarized in Fenner's Smallpox book). Using a\nnon-parametric model (Chi-square), the Aralsk outbreak differs\nsignificantly in the likelihood of transmission after taking into account\nthe vaccination status of the index case. Dr. Sauri is entitled to conclude\nthat the Aralsk outbreak is no different in this regard than what we have\nseen elsewhere, but the statistics don't support him.\n4. Regarding hemorrhagic disease in the Aralsk outbreak, there are clearly\ntoo few cases to draw any firm conclusions about the overall attack rate\nfor this variety of disease. However, what is striking is that in Aralsk\nthere were 2 infants with hemorrhagic disease among the 10 patients; in\nRao's series of 10 857 patients (published in 1964) and in his series of\n6900 (published in 1972), infants almost never got hemorrhagic disease\n(overall rate much less than 1 percent). Is there something different about\nthe strain that resulted in this difference? A simple binomial calculation\nindicates that there was a difference, but I don't think that any\nstatistician would be comfortable drawing conclusions on just 2 cases.\nHowever, I do believe that the question about \"strain\" vs. \"host-factors\"\nin understanding clinical varieties of smallpox is a legitimate one to ask.\nThis distinction has been dismissed in the past by smallpox experts.\nOne final point: when we think about vaccination strategies for smallpox\nprophylaxis, we tend to focus on the vaccine itself. However, in the \"ring\nvaccination\" strategy employed in Africa and Asia in the 1960s and 1970s,\nand in Yugoslavia (1972) and Aralsk (1971), heroic efforts were made to\nidentify cases, isolate them, and also to severely limit all movement --\nparticularly of contacts -- for weeks. To the best of my knowledge, it is\nnot possible to distinguish the impact of the non-vaccination portion of\nthe ring strategy from the impact of the vaccine per se (if there is data\nto refute this point, I would very much like to see it, of course). Thus,\nvaccination policy decisions turn on much more than the vaccine itself, and\neven with the ability to massively vaccinate in the setting of an actual\nattack, the practicalities may be unacceptable to many Americans. Hence my\nsuggestion at the end of the NAS presentation: we should investigate other\nvaccines (ones that may be both more effective and less problematic) and\nsupplement any vaccine-based strategy with anti-viral drugs. Fortunately,\nthe latter are now being tested, though on a shoe-string budget.\n--\nAlan P.

It was cruising south of Vozrozhdenie Island at the end of July\n[1971] and we believe that at that time she was exposed to an aerosol that\nwas released over Vozrozhdenie Island, which was about 15 km away. When she\nreturned to her home in Aralsk she came down with symptoms of smallpox. She\npassed it on to her 9-year-old brother, who became rather sick, but both of\nthem survived,\" Zilinskas said. However, 3 others -- 2 babies, and the\nboy's teacher -- didn't. They died of hemorrhagic smallpox, a particularly\nvirulent form of the disease. In all, 10 people became ill with smallpox.\nThe 7 who survived, including the researcher and her brother, had received\nsmallpox vaccinations years earlier, while the 3 who died had not. The town\nwas closed. Mass vaccinations and quarantines followed.\nSmallpox was still occurring naturally in the 1970s, but the Monterey\nInstitute's researchers say evidence in the Aralsk case points strongly not\nto a natural outbreak or lab accident but to the testing of a smallpox\nbiological weapon on Vozrozhdenie. If the germs were airborne, this means\nthey were disseminated as an aerosol, and the fact that some of those\nstruck by the virus had already been vaccinated suggests, though not\nnecessarily proves, that the smallpox used was of a particularly virulent\nstrain.\nRetired General Petr Burgasov, once a top figure in the Soviet Union's\nbioweapons program, admitted in the \"Moscow News\" paper late last year\n[2001] that a smallpox test -- he did not specify a year -- had caused an\nunidentified number of civilian deaths. \"They were testing a strong strain\nof smallpox,\" Burgasov is quoted as saying in the \"Moscow News\" interview,\nwhich the Monterrey researchers cite in their report. \"Suddenly I'm told\nthat there are some unexplained deaths in Aralsk. A research boat had gone\nwithin 15 km of the island [it was banned from going closer than 40 km]; a\nwoman laboratory technician went twice a day on land to take plankton\nsamples. The smallpox agent -- and on the island all of 400 grams of the\nstrain was used -- 'got' her.\"\nZilinskas said his team's report is based on previously secret documents\ngiven to them by the Kazakh Scientific Center for Quarantine and Zoonotic\nDiseases. It is also based on interviews with 2 survivors, the woman and\nher younger brother. He acknowledged the data is patchy, but said the\n\"airborne germs\" theory is the most logical explanation of how the woman\nbecame infected. And he dismissed suggestions by skeptics that it could\nhave been a natural outbreak that traveled from Afghanistan. \"The problem\nwith that explanation is that there were no other cases in between. In\nother words, in Uzbekistan or Turkmenistan or any of these other countries\nyou'd have to transverse in order to get to Aralsk. And there were no other\noutbreaks at that time anywhere else in the neighborhood. So the only good\nexplanation is that this testing was done on Vozrozhdenie Island,\"\nZilinskas said.\nZilinskas said action is needed now to improve existing smallpox vaccine\nstocks, in case they are not effective against all smallpox strains. That,\nhe said, is a long-term process that could take 5 or 10 years.\n[Byline: Kathleen Knox]\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[Two things are important to note in this version:\n- \"a woman laboratory technician went twice a day on land to take plankton\nsamples\" -- the first report said she never left the ship, so must have got\nit by aerosol from at least 15 km away; so the spread may not have been\nthat far.\n- \"there were no other cases in between\" Afghanistan & Kazakhstan at that\ntime -- this can presumably be checked from WHO records, making it very\nunlikely it was natural spread. - Mod.JW]\n[According to the WHO history of Smallpox Eradication\n<http://whqlibdoc.who.int/smallpox/9241561106_chp14.pdf> transmission of\nsmallpox in Afghanistan was not interrupted until September 1972.

It was cruising south of Vozrozhdenie Island at the end of July\n[1971] and we believe that at that time she was exposed to an aerosol that\nwas released over Vozrozhdenie Island, which was about 15 km away. When she\nreturned to her home in Aralsk she came down with symptoms of smallpox. She\npassed it on to her 9-year-old brother, who became rather sick, but both of\nthem survived,\" Zilinskas said. However, 3 others -- 2 babies, and the\nboy's teacher -- didn't. They died of hemorrhagic smallpox, a particularly\nvirulent form of the disease. In all, 10 people became ill with smallpox.\nThe 7 who survived, including the researcher and her brother, had received\nsmallpox vaccinations years earlier, while the 3 who died had not. The town\nwas closed. Mass vaccinations and quarantines followed.\nSmallpox was still occurring naturally in the 1970s, but the Monterey\nInstitute's researchers say evidence in the Aralsk case points strongly not\nto a natural outbreak or lab accident but to the testing of a smallpox\nbiological weapon on Vozrozhdenie. If the germs were airborne, this means\nthey were disseminated as an aerosol, and the fact that some of those\nstruck by the virus had already been vaccinated suggests, though not\nnecessarily proves, that the smallpox used was of a particularly virulent\nstrain.\nRetired General Petr Burgasov, once a top figure in the Soviet Union's\nbioweapons program, admitted in the \"Moscow News\" paper late last year\n[2001] that a smallpox test -- he did not specify a year -- had caused an\nunidentified number of civilian deaths. \"They were testing a strong strain\nof smallpox,\" Burgasov is quoted as saying in the \"Moscow News\" interview,\nwhich the Monterrey researchers cite in their report. \"Suddenly I'm told\nthat there are some unexplained deaths in Aralsk. A research boat had gone\nwithin 15 km of the island [it was banned from going closer than 40 km]; a\nwoman laboratory technician went twice a day on land to take plankton\nsamples. The smallpox agent -- and on the island all of 400 grams of the\nstrain was used -- 'got' her.\"\nZilinskas said his team's report is based on previously secret documents\ngiven to them by the Kazakh Scientific Center for Quarantine and Zoonotic\nDiseases. It is also based on interviews with 2 survivors, the woman and\nher younger brother. He acknowledged the data is patchy, but said the\n\"airborne germs\" theory is the most logical explanation of how the woman\nbecame infected. And he dismissed suggestions by skeptics that it could\nhave been a natural outbreak that traveled from Afghanistan. \"The problem\nwith that explanation is that there were no other cases in between. In\nother words, in Uzbekistan or Turkmenistan or any of these other countries\nyou'd have to transverse in order to get to Aralsk. And there were no other\noutbreaks at that time anywhere else in the neighborhood. So the only good\nexplanation is that this testing was done on Vozrozhdenie Island,\"\nZilinskas said.\nZilinskas said action is needed now to improve existing smallpox vaccine\nstocks, in case they are not effective against all smallpox strains. That,\nhe said, is a long-term process that could take 5 or 10 years.\n[Byline: Kathleen Knox]\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[Two things are important to note in this version:\n- \"a woman laboratory technician went twice a day on land to take plankton\nsamples\" -- the first report said she never left the ship, so must have got\nit by aerosol from at least 15 km away; so the spread may not have been\nthat far.\n- \"there were no other cases in between\" Afghanistan & Kazakhstan at that\ntime -- this can presumably be checked from WHO records, making it very\nunlikely it was natural spread. - Mod.JW]\n[According to the WHO history of Smallpox Eradication\n<http://whqlibdoc.who.int/smallpox/9241561106_chp14.pdf> transmission of\nsmallpox in Afghanistan was not interrupted until September 1972.

I take this opportunity to clear up a\nfew points.\nFirst, there is no suggestion in either the original report or in Dr.\nZelicoff's analysis that Soviet military scientists \"might have genetically\nengineered a smallpox virus.\" This was quite beyond their capabilities at\nthat time. If they had weaponized the smallpox virus, it would have been\ndone using classical techniques.\nSecond, the main implication of this event is that the Soviet Union was\nworking on weaponizing the smallpox virus since at least the late 1960s,\nand possibly earlier. The Western intelligence services did not learn of\nthis work until 1989, when the first defector from Biopreparat, Dr.\nVladimir Pasechnik, was debriefed and can be assumed to have provided this\ninformation. This means that Soviet military scientists, having had more\nthan 20 years to weaponize smallpox virus and supported by nearly unlimited\nfunds, certainly had plenty of opportunity to develop a strain of smallpox\nvirus that would exceed the pathogenic and virulence potentials of wild\nstrains. (Just think of what a high level scientific team at CDC or\nUSAMRIID could have accomplished if it had been given a similar mission!)\nGiven this history, it is of vital importance to global health security\nthat the Russian government provide information about smallpox strains that\nwere weaponized during the Soviet period so we can test our vaccines\nagainst them. This also means that the 3 closed Russian military biological\ninstitutes, including the Institute of Virology at Sergiyev Posad, must be\nopened up to foreign visitations.\nThird, given that the Soviet Union weaponized the smallpox virus and\nformulated it for use as an aerosol, it would be wise for government\nofficials now working on crafting a policy for meeting the threat of\nbioterrorism to take this into account. In other words, the common thinking\nis that were terrorists to acquire smallpox virus, they would disseminate\nit among a target population via infected individuals. In view of the\nSoviet work with smallpox, it is necessary for officials to also consider\nhow best to prepare for and respond to an attack that utilized aerosolized\nsmallpox virus.\n--\nRaymond A. Zilinskas\nSenior Scientist\nCenter for Nonproliferation Studies\nMonterey Institute of International Studies, California, USA\n<rzilinskas@miis.edu>\n[We thank Ray for these important, albeit dismaying, clarifications. - Mod.JW]\n******\n[3]\nDate: Thu, 20 Jun 2002 11:49:49 -0600\nFrom: Alan P. Zelicoff <apzelic@sandia.gov>\n\nRegarding the previously unknown outbreak of smallpox in 1971 in Aralsk\n(Soviet Union), I would like to augment Dr. Michael A. Sauri's assessment\n(posted on ProMED on 18 Jun 2002) of both the intent and content of my\npresentation at the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) last weekend.\n1. The key point that I was trying to make was that, for the first time, we\nnow have data that smallpox can indeed be aerosolized and propagated over\nlarge distances (many kilometers). Previously, smallpox experts stated that\nthis was simply not possible due to the environmental instability of the\nvirus. I am pleased to see that DA Henderson acknowledged this morning\nthat, indeed, smallpox can be \"hardened\" to so behave (see:\n<http://www.cnn.com/2002/HEALTH/conditions/06/20/smallpox.vaccine/index.html>)\nHe had previously asserted at the NAS meeting that this could not be done.\n2. The significance of this finding is its effect on all of the smallpox\npropagation models presented at the NAS. To illustrate with only one of the\nmodels (that of Dr. Ed Kaplan): the \"decision point\" for the strategy of\nmass vaccination vs. vaccination on warning or pre-attack vaccination of a\nselected group of people (physicians, public health officials, nurses,\ncritical infrastructure workers) depends MOST sensitively on the\n\"reproductive ratio\" of clinical smallpox (i.e., the number of people each\nperson with smallpox may go on to infect) AND the number of initial cases.\nIn Dr. Kaplan's model, if we assume that the reproductive ratio is less\nthan about 2 (a very conservative assumption according to what I've read\nfrom smallpox experts) and an initial number of cases less than about 30,\nthen mass vaccination is NOT the appropriate strategy (due to the side\neffects of the vaccine outweighing the benefits). However (and this is very\nimportant), if the number of index cases rises into the hundreds, then even\nwith a very much lower reproductive ratio (near \"1\"), mass vaccination IS\nthe appropriate strategy. Obviously an aerosol dissemination would create a\nsubstantially larger number of initial cases than would, say, introduction\nof some number of infected people into the US population. Thus, vaccination\nstrategy may change, given our existing vaccine.\n3. Repeatedly emphasizing at the NAS that the numbers (that we know about)\nin the Aralsk outbreak are small (10 total cases), I compared the apparent\nrate of transmissibility in those households where the data was available\nto the Pakistan outbreak, stratified by vaccination status of the household\nindex case (see: Heiner, G.G., Fatima, N., and McCrumb, F.R. \"A Study of\nIntrafamilial Transmission of Smallpox,\" American Journal of Epidemiology,\nvol. 94, pp. 252-268. also summarized in Fenner's Smallpox book). Using a\nnon-parametric model (Chi-square), the Aralsk outbreak differs\nsignificantly in the likelihood of transmission after taking into account\nthe vaccination status of the index case. Dr. Sauri is entitled to conclude\nthat the Aralsk outbreak is no different in this regard than what we have\nseen elsewhere, but the statistics don't support him.\n4. Regarding hemorrhagic disease in the Aralsk outbreak, there are clearly\ntoo few cases to draw any firm conclusions about the overall attack rate\nfor this variety of disease. However, what is striking is that in Aralsk\nthere were 2 infants with hemorrhagic disease among the 10 patients; in\nRao's series of 10 857 patients (published in 1964) and in his series of\n6900 (published in 1972), infants almost never got hemorrhagic disease\n(overall rate much less than 1 percent). Is there something different about\nthe strain that resulted in this difference? A simple binomial calculation\nindicates that there was a difference, but I don't think that any\nstatistician would be comfortable drawing conclusions on just 2 cases.\nHowever, I do believe that the question about \"strain\" vs. \"host-factors\"\nin understanding clinical varieties of smallpox is a legitimate one to ask.\nThis distinction has been dismissed in the past by smallpox experts.\nOne final point: when we think about vaccination strategies for smallpox\nprophylaxis, we tend to focus on the vaccine itself. However, in the \"ring\nvaccination\" strategy employed in Africa and Asia in the 1960s and 1970s,\nand in Yugoslavia (1972) and Aralsk (1971), heroic efforts were made to\nidentify cases, isolate them, and also to severely limit all movement --\nparticularly of contacts -- for weeks. To the best of my knowledge, it is\nnot possible to distinguish the impact of the non-vaccination portion of\nthe ring strategy from the impact of the vaccine per se (if there is data\nto refute this point, I would very much like to see it, of course). Thus,\nvaccination policy decisions turn on much more than the vaccine itself, and\neven with the ability to massively vaccinate in the setting of an actual\nattack, the practicalities may be unacceptable to many Americans. Hence my\nsuggestion at the end of the NAS presentation: we should investigate other\nvaccines (ones that may be both more effective and less problematic) and\nsupplement any vaccine-based strategy with anti-viral drugs. Fortunately,\nthe latter are now being tested, though on a shoe-string budget.\n--\nAlan P.

Obviously an aerosol dissemination would create a\nsubstantially larger number of initial cases than would, say, introduction\nof some number of infected people into the US population. Thus, vaccination\nstrategy may change, given our existing vaccine.\n3. Repeatedly emphasizing at the NAS that the numbers (that we know about)\nin the Aralsk outbreak are small (10 total cases), I compared the apparent\nrate of transmissibility in those households where the data was available\nto the Pakistan outbreak, stratified by vaccination status of the household\nindex case (see: Heiner, G.G., Fatima, N., and McCrumb, F.R. \"A Study of\nIntrafamilial Transmission of Smallpox,\" American Journal of Epidemiology,\nvol. 94, pp. 252-268. also summarized in Fenner's Smallpox book). Using a\nnon-parametric model (Chi-square), the Aralsk outbreak differs\nsignificantly in the likelihood of transmission after taking into account\nthe vaccination status of the index case. Dr. Sauri is entitled to conclude\nthat the Aralsk outbreak is no different in this regard than what we have\nseen elsewhere, but the statistics don't support him.\n4. Regarding hemorrhagic disease in the Aralsk outbreak, there are clearly\ntoo few cases to draw any firm conclusions about the overall attack rate\nfor this variety of disease. However, what is striking is that in Aralsk\nthere were 2 infants with hemorrhagic disease among the 10 patients; in\nRao's series of 10 857 patients (published in 1964) and in his series of\n6900 (published in 1972), infants almost never got hemorrhagic disease\n(overall rate much less than 1 percent). Is there something different about\nthe strain that resulted in this difference? A simple binomial calculation\nindicates that there was a difference, but I don't think that any\nstatistician would be comfortable drawing conclusions on just 2 cases.\nHowever, I do believe that the question about \"strain\" vs. \"host-factors\"\nin understanding clinical varieties of smallpox is a legitimate one to ask.\nThis distinction has been dismissed in the past by smallpox experts.\nOne final point: when we think about vaccination strategies for smallpox\nprophylaxis, we tend to focus on the vaccine itself. However, in the \"ring\nvaccination\" strategy employed in Africa and Asia in the 1960s and 1970s,\nand in Yugoslavia (1972) and Aralsk (1971), heroic efforts were made to\nidentify cases, isolate them, and also to severely limit all movement --\nparticularly of contacts -- for weeks. To the best of my knowledge, it is\nnot possible to distinguish the impact of the non-vaccination portion of\nthe ring strategy from the impact of the vaccine per se (if there is data\nto refute this point, I would very much like to see it, of course). Thus,\nvaccination policy decisions turn on much more than the vaccine itself, and\neven with the ability to massively vaccinate in the setting of an actual\nattack, the practicalities may be unacceptable to many Americans. Hence my\nsuggestion at the end of the NAS presentation: we should investigate other\nvaccines (ones that may be both more effective and less problematic) and\nsupplement any vaccine-based strategy with anti-viral drugs. Fortunately,\nthe latter are now being tested, though on a shoe-string budget.\n--\nAlan P.

It was cruising south of Vozrozhdenie Island at the end of July\n[1971] and we believe that at that time she was exposed to an aerosol that\nwas released over Vozrozhdenie Island, which was about 15 km away. When she\nreturned to her home in Aralsk she came down with symptoms of smallpox. She\npassed it on to her 9-year-old brother, who became rather sick, but both of\nthem survived,\" Zilinskas said. However, 3 others -- 2 babies, and the\nboy's teacher -- didn't. They died of hemorrhagic smallpox, a particularly\nvirulent form of the disease. In all, 10 people became ill with smallpox.\nThe 7 who survived, including the researcher and her brother, had received\nsmallpox vaccinations years earlier, while the 3 who died had not. The town\nwas closed. Mass vaccinations and quarantines followed.\nSmallpox was still occurring naturally in the 1970s, but the Monterey\nInstitute's researchers say evidence in the Aralsk case points strongly not\nto a natural outbreak or lab accident but to the testing of a smallpox\nbiological weapon on Vozrozhdenie. If the germs were airborne, this means\nthey were disseminated as an aerosol, and the fact that some of those\nstruck by the virus had already been vaccinated suggests, though not\nnecessarily proves, that the smallpox used was of a particularly virulent\nstrain.\nRetired General Petr Burgasov, once a top figure in the Soviet Union's\nbioweapons program, admitted in the \"Moscow News\" paper late last year\n[2001] that a smallpox test -- he did not specify a year -- had caused an\nunidentified number of civilian deaths. \"They were testing a strong strain\nof smallpox,\" Burgasov is quoted as saying in the \"Moscow News\" interview,\nwhich the Monterrey researchers cite in their report. \"Suddenly I'm told\nthat there are some unexplained deaths in Aralsk. A research boat had gone\nwithin 15 km of the island [it was banned from going closer than 40 km]; a\nwoman laboratory technician went twice a day on land to take plankton\nsamples. The smallpox agent -- and on the island all of 400 grams of the\nstrain was used -- 'got' her.\"\nZilinskas said his team's report is based on previously secret documents\ngiven to them by the Kazakh Scientific Center for Quarantine and Zoonotic\nDiseases. It is also based on interviews with 2 survivors, the woman and\nher younger brother. He acknowledged the data is patchy, but said the\n\"airborne germs\" theory is the most logical explanation of how the woman\nbecame infected. And he dismissed suggestions by skeptics that it could\nhave been a natural outbreak that traveled from Afghanistan. \"The problem\nwith that explanation is that there were no other cases in between. In\nother words, in Uzbekistan or Turkmenistan or any of these other countries\nyou'd have to transverse in order to get to Aralsk. And there were no other\noutbreaks at that time anywhere else in the neighborhood. So the only good\nexplanation is that this testing was done on Vozrozhdenie Island,\"\nZilinskas said.\nZilinskas said action is needed now to improve existing smallpox vaccine\nstocks, in case they are not effective against all smallpox strains. That,\nhe said, is a long-term process that could take 5 or 10 years.\n[Byline: Kathleen Knox]\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[Two things are important to note in this version:\n- \"a woman laboratory technician went twice a day on land to take plankton\nsamples\" -- the first report said she never left the ship, so must have got\nit by aerosol from at least 15 km away; so the spread may not have been\nthat far.\n- \"there were no other cases in between\" Afghanistan & Kazakhstan at that\ntime -- this can presumably be checked from WHO records, making it very\nunlikely it was natural spread. - Mod.JW]\n[According to the WHO history of Smallpox Eradication\n<http://whqlibdoc.who.int/smallpox/9241561106_chp14.pdf> transmission of\nsmallpox in Afghanistan was not interrupted until September 1972.

I take this opportunity to clear up a\nfew points.\nFirst, there is no suggestion in either the original report or in Dr.\nZelicoff's analysis that Soviet military scientists \"might have genetically\nengineered a smallpox virus.\" This was quite beyond their capabilities at\nthat time. If they had weaponized the smallpox virus, it would have been\ndone using classical techniques.\nSecond, the main implication of this event is that the Soviet Union was\nworking on weaponizing the smallpox virus since at least the late 1960s,\nand possibly earlier. The Western intelligence services did not learn of\nthis work until 1989, when the first defector from Biopreparat, Dr.\nVladimir Pasechnik, was debriefed and can be assumed to have provided this\ninformation. This means that Soviet military scientists, having had more\nthan 20 years to weaponize smallpox virus and supported by nearly unlimited\nfunds, certainly had plenty of opportunity to develop a strain of smallpox\nvirus that would exceed the pathogenic and virulence potentials of wild\nstrains. (Just think of what a high level scientific team at CDC or\nUSAMRIID could have accomplished if it had been given a similar mission!)\nGiven this history, it is of vital importance to global health security\nthat the Russian government provide information about smallpox strains that\nwere weaponized during the Soviet period so we can test our vaccines\nagainst them. This also means that the 3 closed Russian military biological\ninstitutes, including the Institute of Virology at Sergiyev Posad, must be\nopened up to foreign visitations.\nThird, given that the Soviet Union weaponized the smallpox virus and\nformulated it for use as an aerosol, it would be wise for government\nofficials now working on crafting a policy for meeting the threat of\nbioterrorism to take this into account. In other words, the common thinking\nis that were terrorists to acquire smallpox virus, they would disseminate\nit among a target population via infected individuals. In view of the\nSoviet work with smallpox, it is necessary for officials to also consider\nhow best to prepare for and respond to an attack that utilized aerosolized\nsmallpox virus.\n--\nRaymond A.

Zelicoff <apzelic@sandia.gov>\n\nRegarding the previously unknown outbreak of smallpox in 1971 in Aralsk\n(Soviet Union), I would like to augment Dr. Michael A. Sauri's assessment\n(posted on ProMED on 18 Jun 2002) of both the intent and content of my\npresentation at the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) last weekend.\n1. The key point that I was trying to make was that, for the first time, we\nnow have data that smallpox can indeed be aerosolized and propagated over\nlarge distances (many kilometers). Previously, smallpox experts stated that\nthis was simply not possible due to the environmental instability of the\nvirus. I am pleased to see that DA Henderson acknowledged this morning\nthat, indeed, smallpox can be \"hardened\" to so behave (see:\n<http://www.cnn.com/2002/HEALTH/conditions/06/20/smallpox.vaccine/index.html>)\nHe had previously asserted at the NAS meeting that this could not be done.\n2. The significance of this finding is its effect on all of the smallpox\npropagation models presented at the NAS. To illustrate with only one of the\nmodels (that of Dr. Ed Kaplan): the \"decision point\" for the strategy of\nmass vaccination vs. vaccination on warning or pre-attack vaccination of a\nselected group of people (physicians, public health officials, nurses,\ncritical infrastructure workers) depends MOST sensitively on the\n\"reproductive ratio\" of clinical smallpox (i.e., the number of people each\nperson with smallpox may go on to infect) AND the number of initial cases.\nIn Dr. Kaplan's model, if we assume that the reproductive ratio is less\nthan about 2 (a very conservative assumption according to what I've read\nfrom smallpox experts) and an initial number of cases less than about 30,\nthen mass vaccination is NOT the appropriate strategy (due to the side\neffects of the vaccine outweighing the benefits). However (and this is very\nimportant), if the number of index cases rises into the hundreds, then even\nwith a very much lower reproductive ratio (near \"1\"), mass vaccination IS\nthe appropriate strategy. Obviously an aerosol dissemination would create a\nsubstantially larger number of initial cases than would, say, introduction\nof some number of infected people into the US population. Thus, vaccination\nstrategy may change, given our existing vaccine.\n3.

Using a\nnon-parametric model (Chi-square), the Aralsk outbreak differs\nsignificantly in the likelihood of transmission after taking into account\nthe vaccination status of the index case.

I take this opportunity to clear up a\nfew points.\nFirst, there is no suggestion in either the original report or in Dr.\nZelicoff's analysis that Soviet military scientists \"might have genetically\nengineered a smallpox virus.\" This was quite beyond their capabilities at\nthat time. If they had weaponized the smallpox virus, it would have been\ndone using classical techniques.\nSecond, the main implication of this event is that the Soviet Union was\nworking on weaponizing the smallpox virus since at least the late 1960s,\nand possibly earlier. The Western intelligence services did not learn of\nthis work until 1989, when the first defector from Biopreparat, Dr.\nVladimir Pasechnik, was debriefed and can be assumed to have provided this\ninformation. This means that Soviet military scientists, having had more\nthan 20 years to weaponize smallpox virus and supported by nearly unlimited\nfunds, certainly had plenty of opportunity to develop a strain of smallpox\nvirus that would exceed the pathogenic and virulence potentials of wild\nstrains. (Just think of what a high level scientific team at CDC or\nUSAMRIID could have accomplished if it had been given a similar mission!)\nGiven this history, it is of vital importance to global health security\nthat the Russian government provide information about smallpox strains that\nwere weaponized during the Soviet period so we can test our vaccines\nagainst them. This also means that the 3 closed Russian military biological\ninstitutes, including the Institute of Virology at Sergiyev Posad, must be\nopened up to foreign visitations.\nThird, given that the Soviet Union weaponized the smallpox virus and\nformulated it for use as an aerosol, it would be wise for government\nofficials now working on crafting a policy for meeting the threat of\nbioterrorism to take this into account. In other words, the common thinking\nis that were terrorists to acquire smallpox virus, they would disseminate\nit among a target population via infected individuals. In view of the\nSoviet work with smallpox, it is necessary for officials to also consider\nhow best to prepare for and respond to an attack that utilized aerosolized\nsmallpox virus.\n--\nRaymond A.

Zelicoff <apzelic@sandia.gov>\n\nRegarding the previously unknown outbreak of smallpox in 1971 in Aralsk\n(Soviet Union), I would like to augment Dr. Michael A. Sauri's assessment\n(posted on ProMED on 18 Jun 2002) of both the intent and content of my\npresentation at the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) last weekend.\n1. The key point that I was trying to make was that, for the first time, we\nnow have data that smallpox can indeed be aerosolized and propagated over\nlarge distances (many kilometers). Previously, smallpox experts stated that\nthis was simply not possible due to the environmental instability of the\nvirus. I am pleased to see that DA Henderson acknowledged this morning\nthat, indeed, smallpox can be \"hardened\" to so behave (see:\n<http://www.cnn.com/2002/HEALTH/conditions/06/20/smallpox.vaccine/index.html>)\nHe had previously asserted at the NAS meeting that this could not be done.\n2. The significance of this finding is its effect on all of the smallpox\npropagation models presented at the NAS. To illustrate with only one of the\nmodels (that of Dr. Ed Kaplan): the \"decision point\" for the strategy of\nmass vaccination vs. vaccination on warning or pre-attack vaccination of a\nselected group of people (physicians, public health officials, nurses,\ncritical infrastructure workers) depends MOST sensitively on the\n\"reproductive ratio\" of clinical smallpox (i.e., the number of people each\nperson with smallpox may go on to infect) AND the number of initial cases.\nIn Dr. Kaplan's model, if we assume that the reproductive ratio is less\nthan about 2 (a very conservative assumption according to what I've read\nfrom smallpox experts) and an initial number of cases less than about 30,\nthen mass vaccination is NOT the appropriate strategy (due to the side\neffects of the vaccine outweighing the benefits). However (and this is very\nimportant), if the number of index cases rises into the hundreds, then even\nwith a very much lower reproductive ratio (near \"1\"), mass vaccination IS\nthe appropriate strategy. Obviously an aerosol dissemination would create a\nsubstantially larger number of initial cases than would, say, introduction\nof some number of infected people into the US population. Thus, vaccination\nstrategy may change, given our existing vaccine.\n3. Repeatedly emphasizing at the NAS that the numbers (that we know about)\nin the Aralsk outbreak are small (10 total cases), I compared the apparent\nrate of transmissibility in those households where the data was available\nto the Pakistan outbreak, stratified by vaccination status of the household\nindex case (see: Heiner, G.G., Fatima, N., and McCrumb, F.R. \"A Study of\nIntrafamilial Transmission of Smallpox,\" American Journal of Epidemiology,\nvol. 94, pp. 252-268. also summarized in Fenner's Smallpox book). Using a\nnon-parametric model (Chi-square), the Aralsk outbreak differs\nsignificantly in the likelihood of transmission after taking into account\nthe vaccination status of the index case. Dr. Sauri is entitled to conclude\nthat the Aralsk outbreak is no different in this regard than what we have\nseen elsewhere, but the statistics don't support him.\n4. Regarding hemorrhagic disease in the Aralsk outbreak, there are clearly\ntoo few cases to draw any firm conclusions about the overall attack rate\nfor this variety of disease. However, what is striking is that in Aralsk\nthere were 2 infants with hemorrhagic disease among the 10 patients; in\nRao's series of 10 857 patients (published in 1964) and in his series of\n6900 (published in 1972), infants almost never got hemorrhagic disease\n(overall rate much less than 1 percent). Is there something different about\nthe strain that resulted in this difference? A simple binomial calculation\nindicates that there was a difference, but I don't think that any\nstatistician would be comfortable drawing conclusions on just 2 cases.\nHowever, I do believe that the question about \"strain\" vs. \"host-factors\"\nin understanding clinical varieties of smallpox is a legitimate one to ask.\nThis distinction has been dismissed in the past by smallpox experts.\nOne final point: when we think about vaccination strategies for smallpox\nprophylaxis, we tend to focus on the vaccine itself. However, in the \"ring\nvaccination\" strategy employed in Africa and Asia in the 1960s and 1970s,\nand in Yugoslavia (1972) and Aralsk (1971), heroic efforts were made to\nidentify cases, isolate them, and also to severely limit all movement --\nparticularly of contacts -- for weeks. To the best of my knowledge, it is\nnot possible to distinguish the impact of the non-vaccination portion of\nthe ring strategy from the impact of the vaccine per se (if there is data\nto refute this point, I would very much like to see it, of course). Thus,\nvaccination policy decisions turn on much more than the vaccine itself, and\neven with the ability to massively vaccinate in the setting of an actual\nattack, the practicalities may be unacceptable to many Americans. Hence my\nsuggestion at the end of the NAS presentation: we should investigate other\nvaccines (ones that may be both more effective and less problematic) and\nsupplement any vaccine-based strategy with anti-viral drugs. Fortunately,\nthe latter are now being tested, though on a shoe-string budget.\n--\nAlan P.

It was cruising south of Vozrozhdenie Island at the end of July\n[1971] and we believe that at that time she was exposed to an aerosol that\nwas released over Vozrozhdenie Island, which was about 15 km away. When she\nreturned to her home in Aralsk she came down with symptoms of smallpox. She\npassed it on to her 9-year-old brother, who became rather sick, but both of\nthem survived,\" Zilinskas said. However, 3 others -- 2 babies, and the\nboy's teacher -- didn't. They died of hemorrhagic smallpox, a particularly\nvirulent form of the disease. In all, 10 people became ill with smallpox.\nThe 7 who survived, including the researcher and her brother, had received\nsmallpox vaccinations years earlier, while the 3 who died had not. The town\nwas closed. Mass vaccinations and quarantines followed.\nSmallpox was still occurring naturally in the 1970s, but the Monterey\nInstitute's researchers say evidence in the Aralsk case points strongly not\nto a natural outbreak or lab accident but to the testing of a smallpox\nbiological weapon on Vozrozhdenie. If the germs were airborne, this means\nthey were disseminated as an aerosol, and the fact that some of those\nstruck by the virus had already been vaccinated suggests, though not\nnecessarily proves, that the smallpox used was of a particularly virulent\nstrain.\nRetired General Petr Burgasov, once a top figure in the Soviet Union's\nbioweapons program, admitted in the \"Moscow News\" paper late last year\n[2001] that a smallpox test -- he did not specify a year -- had caused an\nunidentified number of civilian deaths. \"They were testing a strong strain\nof smallpox,\" Burgasov is quoted as saying in the \"Moscow News\" interview,\nwhich the Monterrey researchers cite in their report. \"Suddenly I'm told\nthat there are some unexplained deaths in Aralsk. A research boat had gone\nwithin 15 km of the island [it was banned from going closer than 40 km]; a\nwoman laboratory technician went twice a day on land to take plankton\nsamples. The smallpox agent -- and on the island all of 400 grams of the\nstrain was used -- 'got' her.\"\nZilinskas said his team's report is based on previously secret documents\ngiven to them by the Kazakh Scientific Center for Quarantine and Zoonotic\nDiseases. It is also based on interviews with 2 survivors, the woman and\nher younger brother. He acknowledged the data is patchy, but said the\n\"airborne germs\" theory is the most logical explanation of how the woman\nbecame infected. And he dismissed suggestions by skeptics that it could\nhave been a natural outbreak that traveled from Afghanistan. \"The problem\nwith that explanation is that there were no other cases in between. In\nother words, in Uzbekistan or Turkmenistan or any of these other countries\nyou'd have to transverse in order to get to Aralsk. And there were no other\noutbreaks at that time anywhere else in the neighborhood. So the only good\nexplanation is that this testing was done on Vozrozhdenie Island,\"\nZilinskas said.\nZilinskas said action is needed now to improve existing smallpox vaccine\nstocks, in case they are not effective against all smallpox strains. That,\nhe said, is a long-term process that could take 5 or 10 years.\n[Byline: Kathleen Knox]\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[Two things are important to note in this version:\n- \"a woman laboratory technician went twice a day on land to take plankton\nsamples\" -- the first report said she never left the ship, so must have got\nit by aerosol from at least 15 km away; so the spread may not have been\nthat far.\n- \"there were no other cases in between\" Afghanistan & Kazakhstan at that\ntime -- this can presumably be checked from WHO records, making it very\nunlikely it was natural spread. - Mod.JW]\n[According to the WHO history of Smallpox Eradication\n<http://whqlibdoc.who.int/smallpox/9241561106_chp14.pdf> transmission of\nsmallpox in Afghanistan was not interrupted until September 1972.

It was cruising south of Vozrozhdenie Island at the end of July\n[1971] and we believe that at that time she was exposed to an aerosol that\nwas released over Vozrozhdenie Island, which was about 15 km away. When she\nreturned to her home in Aralsk she came down with symptoms of smallpox. She\npassed it on to her 9-year-old brother, who became rather sick, but both of\nthem survived,\" Zilinskas said. However, 3 others -- 2 babies, and the\nboy's teacher -- didn't. They died of hemorrhagic smallpox, a particularly\nvirulent form of the disease. In all, 10 people became ill with smallpox.\nThe 7 who survived, including the researcher and her brother, had received\nsmallpox vaccinations years earlier, while the 3 who died had not. The town\nwas closed. Mass vaccinations and quarantines followed.\nSmallpox was still occurring naturally in the 1970s, but the Monterey\nInstitute's researchers say evidence in the Aralsk case points strongly not\nto a natural outbreak or lab accident but to the testing of a smallpox\nbiological weapon on Vozrozhdenie. If the germs were airborne, this means\nthey were disseminated as an aerosol, and the fact that some of those\nstruck by the virus had already been vaccinated suggests, though not\nnecessarily proves, that the smallpox used was of a particularly virulent\nstrain.\nRetired General Petr Burgasov, once a top figure in the Soviet Union's\nbioweapons program, admitted in the \"Moscow News\" paper late last year\n[2001] that a smallpox test -- he did not specify a year -- had caused an\nunidentified number of civilian deaths. \"They were testing a strong strain\nof smallpox,\" Burgasov is quoted as saying in the \"Moscow News\" interview,\nwhich the Monterrey researchers cite in their report. \"Suddenly I'm told\nthat there are some unexplained deaths in Aralsk. A research boat had gone\nwithin 15 km of the island [it was banned from going closer than 40 km]; a\nwoman laboratory technician went twice a day on land to take plankton\nsamples. The smallpox agent -- and on the island all of 400 grams of the\nstrain was used -- 'got' her.\"\nZilinskas said his team's report is based on previously secret documents\ngiven to them by the Kazakh Scientific Center for Quarantine and Zoonotic\nDiseases. It is also based on interviews with 2 survivors, the woman and\nher younger brother. He acknowledged the data is patchy, but said the\n\"airborne germs\" theory is the most logical explanation of how the woman\nbecame infected. And he dismissed suggestions by skeptics that it could\nhave been a natural outbreak that traveled from Afghanistan. \"The problem\nwith that explanation is that there were no other cases in between. In\nother words, in Uzbekistan or Turkmenistan or any of these other countries\nyou'd have to transverse in order to get to Aralsk. And there were no other\noutbreaks at that time anywhere else in the neighborhood. So the only good\nexplanation is that this testing was done on Vozrozhdenie Island,\"\nZilinskas said.\nZilinskas said action is needed now to improve existing smallpox vaccine\nstocks, in case they are not effective against all smallpox strains. That,\nhe said, is a long-term process that could take 5 or 10 years.\n[Byline: Kathleen Knox]\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[Two things are important to note in this version:\n- \"a woman laboratory technician went twice a day on land to take plankton\nsamples\" -- the first report said she never left the ship, so must have got\nit by aerosol from at least 15 km away; so the spread may not have been\nthat far.\n- \"there were no other cases in between\" Afghanistan & Kazakhstan at that\ntime -- this can presumably be checked from WHO records, making it very\nunlikely it was natural spread. - Mod.JW]\n[According to the WHO history of Smallpox Eradication\n<http://whqlibdoc.who.int/smallpox/9241561106_chp14.pdf> transmission of\nsmallpox in Afghanistan was not interrupted until September 1972.

I take this opportunity to clear up a\nfew points.\nFirst, there is no suggestion in either the original report or in Dr.\nZelicoff's analysis that Soviet military scientists \"might have genetically\nengineered a smallpox virus.\" This was quite beyond their capabilities at\nthat time. If they had weaponized the smallpox virus, it would have been\ndone using classical techniques.\nSecond, the main implication of this event is that the Soviet Union was\nworking on weaponizing the smallpox virus since at least the late 1960s,\nand possibly earlier. The Western intelligence services did not learn of\nthis work until 1989, when the first defector from Biopreparat, Dr.\nVladimir Pasechnik, was debriefed and can be assumed to have provided this\ninformation. This means that Soviet military scientists, having had more\nthan 20 years to weaponize smallpox virus and supported by nearly unlimited\nfunds, certainly had plenty of opportunity to develop a strain of smallpox\nvirus that would exceed the pathogenic and virulence potentials of wild\nstrains. (Just think of what a high level scientific team at CDC or\nUSAMRIID could have accomplished if it had been given a similar mission!)\nGiven this history, it is of vital importance to global health security\nthat the Russian government provide information about smallpox strains that\nwere weaponized during the Soviet period so we can test our vaccines\nagainst them. This also means that the 3 closed Russian military biological\ninstitutes, including the Institute of Virology at Sergiyev Posad, must be\nopened up to foreign visitations.\nThird, given that the Soviet Union weaponized the smallpox virus and\nformulated it for use as an aerosol, it would be wise for government\nofficials now working on crafting a policy for meeting the threat of\nbioterrorism to take this into account. In other words, the common thinking\nis that were terrorists to acquire smallpox virus, they would disseminate\nit among a target population via infected individuals. In view of the\nSoviet work with smallpox, it is necessary for officials to also consider\nhow best to prepare for and respond to an attack that utilized aerosolized\nsmallpox virus.\n--\nRaymond A. Zilinskas\nSenior Scientist\nCenter for Nonproliferation Studies\nMonterey Institute of International Studies, California, USA\n<rzilinskas@miis.edu>\n[We thank Ray for these important, albeit dismaying, clarifications. - Mod.JW]\n******\n[3]\nDate: Thu, 20 Jun 2002 11:49:49 -0600\nFrom: Alan P. Zelicoff <apzelic@sandia.gov>\n\nRegarding the previously unknown outbreak of smallpox in 1971 in Aralsk\n(Soviet Union), I would like to augment Dr. Michael A. Sauri's assessment\n(posted on ProMED on 18 Jun 2002) of both the intent and content of my\npresentation at the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) last weekend.\n1. The key point that I was trying to make was that, for the first time, we\nnow have data that smallpox can indeed be aerosolized and propagated over\nlarge distances (many kilometers). Previously, smallpox experts stated that\nthis was simply not possible due to the environmental instability of the\nvirus. I am pleased to see that DA Henderson acknowledged this morning\nthat, indeed, smallpox can be \"hardened\" to so behave (see:\n<http://www.cnn.com/2002/HEALTH/conditions/06/20/smallpox.vaccine/index.html>)\nHe had previously asserted at the NAS meeting that this could not be done.\n2. The significance of this finding is its effect on all of the smallpox\npropagation models presented at the NAS. To illustrate with only one of the\nmodels (that of Dr. Ed Kaplan): the \"decision point\" for the strategy of\nmass vaccination vs. vaccination on warning or pre-attack vaccination of a\nselected group of people (physicians, public health officials, nurses,\ncritical infrastructure workers) depends MOST sensitively on the\n\"reproductive ratio\" of clinical smallpox (i.e., the number of people each\nperson with smallpox may go on to infect) AND the number of initial cases.\nIn Dr. Kaplan's model, if we assume that the reproductive ratio is less\nthan about 2 (a very conservative assumption according to what I've read\nfrom smallpox experts) and an initial number of cases less than about 30,\nthen mass vaccination is NOT the appropriate strategy (due to the side\neffects of the vaccine outweighing the benefits). However (and this is very\nimportant), if the number of index cases rises into the hundreds, then even\nwith a very much lower reproductive ratio (near \"1\"), mass vaccination IS\nthe appropriate strategy. Obviously an aerosol dissemination would create a\nsubstantially larger number of initial cases than would, say, introduction\nof some number of infected people into the US population. Thus, vaccination\nstrategy may change, given our existing vaccine.\n3. Repeatedly emphasizing at the NAS that the numbers (that we know about)\nin the Aralsk outbreak are small (10 total cases), I compared the apparent\nrate of transmissibility in those households where the data was available\nto the Pakistan outbreak, stratified by vaccination status of the household\nindex case (see: Heiner, G.G., Fatima, N., and McCrumb, F.R. \"A Study of\nIntrafamilial Transmission of Smallpox,\" American Journal of Epidemiology,\nvol. 94, pp. 252-268. also summarized in Fenner's Smallpox book). Using a\nnon-parametric model (Chi-square), the Aralsk outbreak differs\nsignificantly in the likelihood of transmission after taking into account\nthe vaccination status of the index case. Dr. Sauri is entitled to conclude\nthat the Aralsk outbreak is no different in this regard than what we have\nseen elsewhere, but the statistics don't support him.\n4. Regarding hemorrhagic disease in the Aralsk outbreak, there are clearly\ntoo few cases to draw any firm conclusions about the overall attack rate\nfor this variety of disease. However, what is striking is that in Aralsk\nthere were 2 infants with hemorrhagic disease among the 10 patients; in\nRao's series of 10 857 patients (published in 1964) and in his series of\n6900 (published in 1972), infants almost never got hemorrhagic disease\n(overall rate much less than 1 percent). Is there something different about\nthe strain that resulted in this difference? A simple binomial calculation\nindicates that there was a difference, but I don't think that any\nstatistician would be comfortable drawing conclusions on just 2 cases.\nHowever, I do believe that the question about \"strain\" vs. \"host-factors\"\nin understanding clinical varieties of smallpox is a legitimate one to ask.\nThis distinction has been dismissed in the past by smallpox experts.\nOne final point: when we think about vaccination strategies for smallpox\nprophylaxis, we tend to focus on the vaccine itself. However, in the \"ring\nvaccination\" strategy employed in Africa and Asia in the 1960s and 1970s,\nand in Yugoslavia (1972) and Aralsk (1971), heroic efforts were made to\nidentify cases, isolate them, and also to severely limit all movement --\nparticularly of contacts -- for weeks. To the best of my knowledge, it is\nnot possible to distinguish the impact of the non-vaccination portion of\nthe ring strategy from the impact of the vaccine per se (if there is data\nto refute this point, I would very much like to see it, of course). Thus,\nvaccination policy decisions turn on much more than the vaccine itself, and\neven with the ability to massively vaccinate in the setting of an actual\nattack, the practicalities may be unacceptable to many Americans. Hence my\nsuggestion at the end of the NAS presentation: we should investigate other\nvaccines (ones that may be both more effective and less problematic) and\nsupplement any vaccine-based strategy with anti-viral drugs. Fortunately,\nthe latter are now being tested, though on a shoe-string budget.\n--\nAlan P.

The contract with Acambis Inc. is supposed\nto bring the United States' stockpile to 286 million doses of the vaccine\nby the end of next year, promising protection for every American. But there\nare no plans to resume the routine vaccinations of Americans that ended in\n1972, HHS Secretary Tommy Thompson said, because the vaccine can be given 4\ndays after exposure to smallpox and still offer protection, and because it\ncan cause some rare but deadly side effects.\nSmallpox hasn't occurred in the United States since 1949 and was declared\neradicated worldwide in 1980. But the Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention in Atlanta and a Moscow laboratory hold stocks of the virus, and\nbioterrorism experts worry that samples could fall into the hands of\nterrorists and be used as a weapon. Experts believe such a smallpox attack\nis unlikely, but it could overwhelm communities were it to occur. The virus\nis highly contagious, and nearly a third of its victims die. \"The risk does\nexist and we must be prepared,\" Thompson said. \"Obtaining the vaccine\nrepresents an important insurance policy,\" added Dr DA Henderson, who led\nthe global campaign that eliminated smallpox and is now Thompson's top\nbioterrorism adviser. \"It's simply a prudent thing to do at this point in\ntime.\" But the risk of a smallpox attack is not significant enough to\njustify the risks associated with the vaccine, he said.\nAbout 3 in every 1 million people vaccinated would get encephalitis, which\ncan cause permanent brain damage or death. Another 250 among the total\npopulation vaccinated would get a smallpox-like rash that also can be fatal\nif not properly treated. And experts estimate that if every American were\nvaccinated against smallpox, about 400 people would die from the vaccine.\n\"It causes more complications than any vaccine we now have,\" Henderson said.\nShould smallpox reappear, a federal response plan calls for isolating the\npatient and then vaccinating those in close contact with him or her. The\n[US government already has 15.4 million doses of smallpox vaccine on hand,\nand officials are prepared to dilute each one to create 5 doses, bringing\nthe total to 77 million. Researchers are studying whether each dose could\nbe further diluted, to get 10 doses from each one. In either case, the\ndiluted vaccine would be used only if the new doses had not yet been\ndelivered, or if they ran out, said Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the\nNational Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease.\nAn additional 54 million doses have been ordered from Acambis already and\nare expected to be delivered next year. The new contract will bring another\n155 million doses, which are expected by late fall 2002. They will cost the\ngovernment $428 million, or $2.76 per dose. That's less than the $509\nmillion that the Bush administration has asked from Congress to pay for the\nnew vaccine. The initial budget request assumed that the government would\nneed to buy 250 million doses, but new research has found that the existing\nvaccine can safely be diluted, meaning much less new vaccine is needed.\nTo make the newest batch of vaccine, Acambis has teamed with Baxter\nInternational, which will begin brewing doses immediately at an undisclosed\nEuropean factory, Acambis spokeswoman Lyndsay Wright said. Acambis' own\nmanufacturing will begin soon at a factory in Cambridge, Massachusetts, she\nsaid.

The contract with Acambis Inc. is supposed\nto bring the United States' stockpile to 286 million doses of the vaccine\nby the end of next year, promising protection for every American. But there\nare no plans to resume the routine vaccinations of Americans that ended in\n1972, HHS Secretary Tommy Thompson said, because the vaccine can be given 4\ndays after exposure to smallpox and still offer protection, and because it\ncan cause some rare but deadly side effects.\nSmallpox hasn't occurred in the United States since 1949 and was declared\neradicated worldwide in 1980. But the Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention in Atlanta and a Moscow laboratory hold stocks of the virus, and\nbioterrorism experts worry that samples could fall into the hands of\nterrorists and be used as a weapon. Experts believe such a smallpox attack\nis unlikely, but it could overwhelm communities were it to occur. The virus\nis highly contagious, and nearly a third of its victims die. \"The risk does\nexist and we must be prepared,\" Thompson said. \"Obtaining the vaccine\nrepresents an important insurance policy,\" added Dr DA Henderson, who led\nthe global campaign that eliminated smallpox and is now Thompson's top\nbioterrorism adviser. \"It's simply a prudent thing to do at this point in\ntime.\" But the risk of a smallpox attack is not significant enough to\njustify the risks associated with the vaccine, he said.\nAbout 3 in every 1 million people vaccinated would get encephalitis, which\ncan cause permanent brain damage or death. Another 250 among the total\npopulation vaccinated would get a smallpox-like rash that also can be fatal\nif not properly treated. And experts estimate that if every American were\nvaccinated against smallpox, about 400 people would die from the vaccine.\n\"It causes more complications than any vaccine we now have,\" Henderson said.\nShould smallpox reappear, a federal response plan calls for isolating the\npatient and then vaccinating those in close contact with him or her. The\n[US government already has 15.4 million doses of smallpox vaccine on hand,\nand officials are prepared to dilute each one to create 5 doses, bringing\nthe total to 77 million. Researchers are studying whether each dose could\nbe further diluted, to get 10 doses from each one. In either case, the\ndiluted vaccine would be used only if the new doses had not yet been\ndelivered, or if they ran out, said Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the\nNational Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease.\nAn additional 54 million doses have been ordered from Acambis already and\nare expected to be delivered next year. The new contract will bring another\n155 million doses, which are expected by late fall 2002. They will cost the\ngovernment $428 million, or $2.76 per dose. That's less than the $509\nmillion that the Bush administration has asked from Congress to pay for the\nnew vaccine. The initial budget request assumed that the government would\nneed to buy 250 million doses, but new research has found that the existing\nvaccine can safely be diluted, meaning much less new vaccine is needed.\nTo make the newest batch of vaccine, Acambis has teamed with Baxter\nInternational, which will begin brewing doses immediately at an undisclosed\nEuropean factory, Acambis spokeswoman Lyndsay Wright said. Acambis' own\nmanufacturing will begin soon at a factory in Cambridge, Massachusetts, she\nsaid.

The contract with Acambis Inc. is supposed\nto bring the United States' stockpile to 286 million doses of the vaccine\nby the end of next year, promising protection for every American. But there\nare no plans to resume the routine vaccinations of Americans that ended in\n1972, HHS Secretary Tommy Thompson said, because the vaccine can be given 4\ndays after exposure to smallpox and still offer protection, and because it\ncan cause some rare but deadly side effects.\nSmallpox hasn't occurred in the United States since 1949 and was declared\neradicated worldwide in 1980. But the Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention in Atlanta and a Moscow laboratory hold stocks of the virus, and\nbioterrorism experts worry that samples could fall into the hands of\nterrorists and be used as a weapon. Experts believe such a smallpox attack\nis unlikely, but it could overwhelm communities were it to occur. The virus\nis highly contagious, and nearly a third of its victims die. \"The risk does\nexist and we must be prepared,\" Thompson said. \"Obtaining the vaccine\nrepresents an important insurance policy,\" added Dr DA Henderson, who led\nthe global campaign that eliminated smallpox and is now Thompson's top\nbioterrorism adviser. \"It's simply a prudent thing to do at this point in\ntime.\" But the risk of a smallpox attack is not significant enough to\njustify the risks associated with the vaccine, he said.\nAbout 3 in every 1 million people vaccinated would get encephalitis, which\ncan cause permanent brain damage or death. Another 250 among the total\npopulation vaccinated would get a smallpox-like rash that also can be fatal\nif not properly treated. And experts estimate that if every American were\nvaccinated against smallpox, about 400 people would die from the vaccine.\n\"It causes more complications than any vaccine we now have,\" Henderson said.\nShould smallpox reappear, a federal response plan calls for isolating the\npatient and then vaccinating those in close contact with him or her. The\n[US government already has 15.4 million doses of smallpox vaccine on hand,\nand officials are prepared to dilute each one to create 5 doses, bringing\nthe total to 77 million. Researchers are studying whether each dose could\nbe further diluted, to get 10 doses from each one. In either case, the\ndiluted vaccine would be used only if the new doses had not yet been\ndelivered, or if they ran out, said Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the\nNational Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease.\nAn additional 54 million doses have been ordered from Acambis already and\nare expected to be delivered next year. The new contract will bring another\n155 million doses, which are expected by late fall 2002. They will cost the\ngovernment $428 million, or $2.76 per dose. That's less than the $509\nmillion that the Bush administration has asked from Congress to pay for the\nnew vaccine. The initial budget request assumed that the government would\nneed to buy 250 million doses, but new research has found that the existing\nvaccine can safely be diluted, meaning much less new vaccine is needed.\nTo make the newest batch of vaccine, Acambis has teamed with Baxter\nInternational, which will begin brewing doses immediately at an undisclosed\nEuropean factory, Acambis spokeswoman Lyndsay Wright said.

The decision, disclosed by\nsenior administration officials, is likely to provoke criticism from\ninternational health officials, who have long favored the destruction of\nthe microbe.\nA succession of administrations have endorsed the goal of destroying the\nvirus, which was eradicated as a disease in the 1970's. But some American\nscientists and Pentagon officials have argued for retaining smallpox\n[virus stocks, and in 1999 President Clinton declared that they should be\nmaintained, at least temporarily, while more research was conducted. The\nClinton administration privately assured other nations that it would\nsupport a move to kill off smallpox [virus in 2002 when the issue was\nconsidered by the World Health Organization, which has long advocated\ndestruction of the virus.\nThe Bush administration's new policy, which is now being described to\nAmerica's allies, sets no such deadline and establishes some stringent\nconditions, reflecting a new assessment of the dangers posed by\nbioterrorism. The United States stopped routine vaccinations for smallpox\nin 1972. How long vaccines continue to protect against the disease is not\nknown, but the immunity is believed to fade over time. Americans under 30\nare completely vulnerable to the disease.\nAdministration officials said the remaining American smallpox [virus\nsamples, which are stored [in a laboratory at the Centers for Disease\nControl and Prevention in Atlanta, should not be destroyed until the nation\ndevelops at least 2 licensed antiviral drugs, a vaccine that can be taken\nby the entire population, and other defensive measures. Russia also has\nsmallpox strains stored at a research laboratory in Siberia.\nThe eradication of smallpox as a disease is considered one of medicine's\ngreatest triumphs, and experts said the Bush administration's decision is\nlikely to anger many doctors and scientists, particularly those in\ndeveloping nations ravaged by the disease only a quarter of a century ago.\nBut administration officials said that after the terrorist attacks of 11\nSep 2001 and the spate of anthrax letters that have killed 4, infected 13\nothers, and put 30 000 Americans on antibiotics, the administration had no\nchoice but to abandon the nation's long-standing commitment to eradicating\nthe officially declared stocks as soon as possible.\nOfficials said that an interagency group that has been considering bio-\ndefense measures had unanimously endorsed the policy shift without\nreservation. The group is made up of representatives of the Defense\nDepartment, State Department, Department of Health and Human Services and\nother cabinet departments. But the officials said they expected the\ndecision might be criticized by individuals and groups long associated with\nthe international campaign to destroy the virus to ensure that it does not\nre emerge and to celebrate the world's triumph over the contagious disease,\nwhich killed one-third of those it infected.\nJonathan B. Tucker, a bioterrorism expert at the Washington office of the\nMonterey Institute of International Studies and the author of \"Scourge: The\nOnce and Future Threat of Smallpox,\" said the policy would create a certain\namount of ill will internationally and arouse suspicions about American and\nRussian intentions. In particular, he said, India and Brazil, which had\nlobbied hard for the virus's destruction, would resent the continued\nAmerican and Russian monopoly on the stocks. The Clinton administration had\nassured their officials in 1999, he said, that the United States would\nsupport destruction after research on the virus was completed in 2002. It\nwas that compromise that permitted the agreement 2 years ago, Mr. Tucker\nsaid. The new policy, however, is likely to be received with relief by many\ncountries, notably Russia. Russia has vigorously argued that there are\nclandestine stocks of smallpox virus throughout the world and that\nretaining the virus could speed the development of new drugs to fight a\npossible outbreak, whether because of terrorism or other factors.\nReached late tonight by phone in Moscow, Lev S. Sandakhchiev, the director\nof Russia's State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology, the\nSiberian based research laboratory where smallpox [virus strains are\nstored, called the American shift wise not only for Russia and the United\nStates, but also for the entire world. In the Soviet era, Dr.\nSandakhchiev's lab specialized in turning viruses like smallpox [virus\ninto weapons of war. American officials said that he had privately warned\nthat North Korea, among other countries, was secretly keeping smallpox\n[virus stocks. It was intelligence from Soviet defectors and other sources\nabout Moscow's vast germ warfare program that prompted the Clinton\nadministration to question the immediate destruction of the virus. Western\nand foreign officials said at the time that fear of a possible epidemic in\na now largely unvaccinated world helped shift Mr. Clinton's personal views\nagainst immediate destruction. But the previous administration remained\ncommitted in principle to destroying the virus, a commitment that the Bush\nadministration has now refused to make. Those familiar with the conditions\nset by the Bush administration say destruction of the virus will not even\nbe considered until a new vaccine is produced that can be given to all\nAmericans. The vaccine available today cannot safely be administered to\npeople with HIV or to others with immune deficiencies.\nThe conditions also include the development of reliable medical diagnostic\ntests and environmental detectors, which do not yet exist. And they include\nthe ability to defeat genetically altered strains of smallpox. It would\ntake at least a decade to meet the administration's criteria, and that is a\nconservative estimate, Mr. Tucker said. He called the position of the\nadministration too open-ended and warned that it would have its work cut\nout in trying to persuade other nations to accept that the virus would not\nbe destroyed by the time President Bush leaves office. A committee of\nscientific experts is scheduled to consider the issue of destroying the\nvirus early next month. The new American position is expected to be\nunveiled formally at that session, if not before, officials said.\nAdministration officials said that they had already discussed the new\nstance with Britain, America's closest ally in the war against\ninternational terrorism, and that other allies were now being notified.\nOver the weekend, officials said, Tommy G. Thompson, the Secretary of\nHealth and Human Services, discussed the policy by phone with the head of\nthe World Health Organization. Its officials, in Geneva, could not be\nreached late tonight for comment.\n[Byline: Judith Miller\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[This article was also submitted by George Robertson. - Mod.ES\n...................mpp/cp/pg/es\n*##########################################################*\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.

The decision, disclosed by\nsenior administration officials, is likely to provoke criticism from\ninternational health officials, who have long favored the destruction of\nthe microbe.\nA succession of administrations have endorsed the goal of destroying the\nvirus, which was eradicated as a disease in the 1970's. But some American\nscientists and Pentagon officials have argued for retaining smallpox\n[virus stocks, and in 1999 President Clinton declared that they should be\nmaintained, at least temporarily, while more research was conducted. The\nClinton administration privately assured other nations that it would\nsupport a move to kill off smallpox [virus in 2002 when the issue was\nconsidered by the World Health Organization, which has long advocated\ndestruction of the virus.\nThe Bush administration's new policy, which is now being described to\nAmerica's allies, sets no such deadline and establishes some stringent\nconditions, reflecting a new assessment of the dangers posed by\nbioterrorism. The United States stopped routine vaccinations for smallpox\nin 1972. How long vaccines continue to protect against the disease is not\nknown, but the immunity is believed to fade over time. Americans under 30\nare completely vulnerable to the disease.\nAdministration officials said the remaining American smallpox [virus\nsamples, which are stored [in a laboratory at the Centers for Disease\nControl and Prevention in Atlanta, should not be destroyed until the nation\ndevelops at least 2 licensed antiviral drugs, a vaccine that can be taken\nby the entire population, and other defensive measures. Russia also has\nsmallpox strains stored at a research laboratory in Siberia.\nThe eradication of smallpox as a disease is considered one of medicine's\ngreatest triumphs, and experts said the Bush administration's decision is\nlikely to anger many doctors and scientists, particularly those in\ndeveloping nations ravaged by the disease only a quarter of a century ago.\nBut administration officials said that after the terrorist attacks of 11\nSep 2001 and the spate of anthrax letters that have killed 4, infected 13\nothers, and put 30 000 Americans on antibiotics, the administration had no\nchoice but to abandon the nation's long-standing commitment to eradicating\nthe officially declared stocks as soon as possible.\nOfficials said that an interagency group that has been considering bio-\ndefense measures had unanimously endorsed the policy shift without\nreservation. The group is made up of representatives of the Defense\nDepartment, State Department, Department of Health and Human Services and\nother cabinet departments. But the officials said they expected the\ndecision might be criticized by individuals and groups long associated with\nthe international campaign to destroy the virus to ensure that it does not\nre emerge and to celebrate the world's triumph over the contagious disease,\nwhich killed one-third of those it infected.\nJonathan B. Tucker, a bioterrorism expert at the Washington office of the\nMonterey Institute of International Studies and the author of \"Scourge: The\nOnce and Future Threat of Smallpox,\" said the policy would create a certain\namount of ill will internationally and arouse suspicions about American and\nRussian intentions. In particular, he said, India and Brazil, which had\nlobbied hard for the virus's destruction, would resent the continued\nAmerican and Russian monopoly on the stocks. The Clinton administration had\nassured their officials in 1999, he said, that the United States would\nsupport destruction after research on the virus was completed in 2002. It\nwas that compromise that permitted the agreement 2 years ago, Mr. Tucker\nsaid. The new policy, however, is likely to be received with relief by many\ncountries, notably Russia. Russia has vigorously argued that there are\nclandestine stocks of smallpox virus throughout the world and that\nretaining the virus could speed the development of new drugs to fight a\npossible outbreak, whether because of terrorism or other factors.\nReached late tonight by phone in Moscow, Lev S. Sandakhchiev, the director\nof Russia's State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology, the\nSiberian based research laboratory where smallpox [virus strains are\nstored, called the American shift wise not only for Russia and the United\nStates, but also for the entire world. In the Soviet era, Dr.\nSandakhchiev's lab specialized in turning viruses like smallpox [virus\ninto weapons of war. American officials said that he had privately warned\nthat North Korea, among other countries, was secretly keeping smallpox\n[virus stocks. It was intelligence from Soviet defectors and other sources\nabout Moscow's vast germ warfare program that prompted the Clinton\nadministration to question the immediate destruction of the virus. Western\nand foreign officials said at the time that fear of a possible epidemic in\na now largely unvaccinated world helped shift Mr. Clinton's personal views\nagainst immediate destruction. But the previous administration remained\ncommitted in principle to destroying the virus, a commitment that the Bush\nadministration has now refused to make. Those familiar with the conditions\nset by the Bush administration say destruction of the virus will not even\nbe considered until a new vaccine is produced that can be given to all\nAmericans. The vaccine available today cannot safely be administered to\npeople with HIV or to others with immune deficiencies.\nThe conditions also include the development of reliable medical diagnostic\ntests and environmental detectors, which do not yet exist. And they include\nthe ability to defeat genetically altered strains of smallpox. It would\ntake at least a decade to meet the administration's criteria, and that is a\nconservative estimate, Mr. Tucker said. He called the position of the\nadministration too open-ended and warned that it would have its work cut\nout in trying to persuade other nations to accept that the virus would not\nbe destroyed by the time President Bush leaves office. A committee of\nscientific experts is scheduled to consider the issue of destroying the\nvirus early next month. The new American position is expected to be\nunveiled formally at that session, if not before, officials said.\nAdministration officials said that they had already discussed the new\nstance with Britain, America's closest ally in the war against\ninternational terrorism, and that other allies were now being notified.\nOver the weekend, officials said, Tommy G. Thompson, the Secretary of\nHealth and Human Services, discussed the policy by phone with the head of\nthe World Health Organization. Its officials, in Geneva, could not be\nreached late tonight for comment.\n[Byline: Judith Miller\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[This article was also submitted by George Robertson. - Mod.ES\n...................mpp/cp/pg/es\n*##########################################################*\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.

The decision, disclosed by\nsenior administration officials, is likely to provoke criticism from\ninternational health officials, who have long favored the destruction of\nthe microbe.\nA succession of administrations have endorsed the goal of destroying the\nvirus, which was eradicated as a disease in the 1970's. But some American\nscientists and Pentagon officials have argued for retaining smallpox\n[virus stocks, and in 1999 President Clinton declared that they should be\nmaintained, at least temporarily, while more research was conducted. The\nClinton administration privately assured other nations that it would\nsupport a move to kill off smallpox [virus in 2002 when the issue was\nconsidered by the World Health Organization, which has long advocated\ndestruction of the virus.\nThe Bush administration's new policy, which is now being described to\nAmerica's allies, sets no such deadline and establishes some stringent\nconditions, reflecting a new assessment of the dangers posed by\nbioterrorism. The United States stopped routine vaccinations for smallpox\nin 1972. How long vaccines continue to protect against the disease is not\nknown, but the immunity is believed to fade over time. Americans under 30\nare completely vulnerable to the disease.\nAdministration officials said the remaining American smallpox [virus\nsamples, which are stored [in a laboratory at the Centers for Disease\nControl and Prevention in Atlanta, should not be destroyed until the nation\ndevelops at least 2 licensed antiviral drugs, a vaccine that can be taken\nby the entire population, and other defensive measures. Russia also has\nsmallpox strains stored at a research laboratory in Siberia.\nThe eradication of smallpox as a disease is considered one of medicine's\ngreatest triumphs, and experts said the Bush administration's decision is\nlikely to anger many doctors and scientists, particularly those in\ndeveloping nations ravaged by the disease only a quarter of a century ago.\nBut administration officials said that after the terrorist attacks of 11\nSep 2001 and the spate of anthrax letters that have killed 4, infected 13\nothers, and put 30 000 Americans on antibiotics, the administration had no\nchoice but to abandon the nation's long-standing commitment to eradicating\nthe officially declared stocks as soon as possible.\nOfficials said that an interagency group that has been considering bio-\ndefense measures had unanimously endorsed the policy shift without\nreservation. The group is made up of representatives of the Defense\nDepartment, State Department, Department of Health and Human Services and\nother cabinet departments. But the officials said they expected the\ndecision might be criticized by individuals and groups long associated with\nthe international campaign to destroy the virus to ensure that it does not\nre emerge and to celebrate the world's triumph over the contagious disease,\nwhich killed one-third of those it infected.\nJonathan B. Tucker, a bioterrorism expert at the Washington office of the\nMonterey Institute of International Studies and the author of \"Scourge: The\nOnce and Future Threat of Smallpox,\" said the policy would create a certain\namount of ill will internationally and arouse suspicions about American and\nRussian intentions. In particular, he said, India and Brazil, which had\nlobbied hard for the virus's destruction, would resent the continued\nAmerican and Russian monopoly on the stocks. The Clinton administration had\nassured their officials in 1999, he said, that the United States would\nsupport destruction after research on the virus was completed in 2002. It\nwas that compromise that permitted the agreement 2 years ago, Mr. Tucker\nsaid. The new policy, however, is likely to be received with relief by many\ncountries, notably Russia. Russia has vigorously argued that there are\nclandestine stocks of smallpox virus throughout the world and that\nretaining the virus could speed the development of new drugs to fight a\npossible outbreak, whether because of terrorism or other factors.\nReached late tonight by phone in Moscow, Lev S. Sandakhchiev, the director\nof Russia's State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology, the\nSiberian based research laboratory where smallpox [virus strains are\nstored, called the American shift wise not only for Russia and the United\nStates, but also for the entire world. In the Soviet era, Dr.\nSandakhchiev's lab specialized in turning viruses like smallpox [virus\ninto weapons of war. American officials said that he had privately warned\nthat North Korea, among other countries, was secretly keeping smallpox\n[virus stocks. It was intelligence from Soviet defectors and other sources\nabout Moscow's vast germ warfare program that prompted the Clinton\nadministration to question the immediate destruction of the virus. Western\nand foreign officials said at the time that fear of a possible epidemic in\na now largely unvaccinated world helped shift Mr. Clinton's personal views\nagainst immediate destruction. But the previous administration remained\ncommitted in principle to destroying the virus, a commitment that the Bush\nadministration has now refused to make. Those familiar with the conditions\nset by the Bush administration say destruction of the virus will not even\nbe considered until a new vaccine is produced that can be given to all\nAmericans.

In particular, he said, India and Brazil, which had\nlobbied hard for the virus's destruction, would resent the continued\nAmerican and Russian monopoly on the stocks. The Clinton administration had\nassured their officials in 1999, he said, that the United States would\nsupport destruction after research on the virus was completed in 2002. It\nwas that compromise that permitted the agreement 2 years ago, Mr. Tucker\nsaid. The new policy, however, is likely to be received with relief by many\ncountries, notably Russia. Russia has vigorously argued that there are\nclandestine stocks of smallpox virus throughout the world and that\nretaining the virus could speed the development of new drugs to fight a\npossible outbreak, whether because of terrorism or other factors.\nReached late tonight by phone in Moscow, Lev S. Sandakhchiev, the director\nof Russia's State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology, the\nSiberian based research laboratory where smallpox [virus strains are\nstored, called the American shift wise not only for Russia and the United\nStates, but also for the entire world. In the Soviet era, Dr.\nSandakhchiev's lab specialized in turning viruses like smallpox [virus\ninto weapons of war. American officials said that he had privately warned\nthat North Korea, among other countries, was secretly keeping smallpox\n[virus stocks. It was intelligence from Soviet defectors and other sources\nabout Moscow's vast germ warfare program that prompted the Clinton\nadministration to question the immediate destruction of the virus. Western\nand foreign officials said at the time that fear of a possible epidemic in\na now largely unvaccinated world helped shift Mr. Clinton's personal views\nagainst immediate destruction. But the previous administration remained\ncommitted in principle to destroying the virus, a commitment that the Bush\nadministration has now refused to make. Those familiar with the conditions\nset by the Bush administration say destruction of the virus will not even\nbe considered until a new vaccine is produced that can be given to all\nAmericans. The vaccine available today cannot safely be administered to\npeople with HIV or to others with immune deficiencies.\nThe conditions also include the development of reliable medical diagnostic\ntests and environmental detectors, which do not yet exist. And they include\nthe ability to defeat genetically altered strains of smallpox. It would\ntake at least a decade to meet the administration's criteria, and that is a\nconservative estimate, Mr. Tucker said. He called the position of the\nadministration too open-ended and warned that it would have its work cut\nout in trying to persuade other nations to accept that the virus would not\nbe destroyed by the time President Bush leaves office. A committee of\nscientific experts is scheduled to consider the issue of destroying the\nvirus early next month. The new American position is expected to be\nunveiled formally at that session, if not before, officials said.\nAdministration officials said that they had already discussed the new\nstance with Britain, America's closest ally in the war against\ninternational terrorism, and that other allies were now being notified.\nOver the weekend, officials said, Tommy G. Thompson, the Secretary of\nHealth and Human Services, discussed the policy by phone with the head of\nthe World Health Organization.

The decision, disclosed by\nsenior administration officials, is likely to provoke criticism from\ninternational health officials, who have long favored the destruction of\nthe microbe.\nA succession of administrations have endorsed the goal of destroying the\nvirus, which was eradicated as a disease in the 1970's. But some American\nscientists and Pentagon officials have argued for retaining smallpox\n[virus stocks, and in 1999 President Clinton declared that they should be\nmaintained, at least temporarily, while more research was conducted. The\nClinton administration privately assured other nations that it would\nsupport a move to kill off smallpox [virus in 2002 when the issue was\nconsidered by the World Health Organization, which has long advocated\ndestruction of the virus.\nThe Bush administration's new policy, which is now being described to\nAmerica's allies, sets no such deadline and establishes some stringent\nconditions, reflecting a new assessment of the dangers posed by\nbioterrorism. The United States stopped routine vaccinations for smallpox\nin 1972. How long vaccines continue to protect against the disease is not\nknown, but the immunity is believed to fade over time. Americans under 30\nare completely vulnerable to the disease.\nAdministration officials said the remaining American smallpox [virus\nsamples, which are stored [in a laboratory at the Centers for Disease\nControl and Prevention in Atlanta, should not be destroyed until the nation\ndevelops at least 2 licensed antiviral drugs, a vaccine that can be taken\nby the entire population, and other defensive measures. Russia also has\nsmallpox strains stored at a research laboratory in Siberia.\nThe eradication of smallpox as a disease is considered one of medicine's\ngreatest triumphs, and experts said the Bush administration's decision is\nlikely to anger many doctors and scientists, particularly those in\ndeveloping nations ravaged by the disease only a quarter of a century ago.\nBut administration officials said that after the terrorist attacks of 11\nSep 2001 and the spate of anthrax letters that have killed 4, infected 13\nothers, and put 30 000 Americans on antibiotics, the administration had no\nchoice but to abandon the nation's long-standing commitment to eradicating\nthe officially declared stocks as soon as possible.\nOfficials said that an interagency group that has been considering bio-\ndefense measures had unanimously endorsed the policy shift without\nreservation. The group is made up of representatives of the Defense\nDepartment, State Department, Department of Health and Human Services and\nother cabinet departments. But the officials said they expected the\ndecision might be criticized by individuals and groups long associated with\nthe international campaign to destroy the virus to ensure that it does not\nre emerge and to celebrate the world's triumph over the contagious disease,\nwhich killed one-third of those it infected.\nJonathan B.

The study was terminated at 13 years as Wolff and\nCroon ran out of scabs; however, the number of viable viruses per scab\ndecreased significantly over time.\nMacCallum and McDonald's work examined variola virus in scabs and in\nraw cotton; they determined that scabs survived for a maximum of three\nto four months. These researchers concluded that \"the virus can\nsurvive for many years, ten or more, at from 4C to 5C in enclosed tubes or\nbottles, with little decrease in titre,\" but that the virus \"in tropical\nclimates\n-- i.e., at temperatures from 30C to 40C -- is unlikely to survive for as\nlong as six months.\" These results corroborated those of Downie and\nDumbell.\nFornaciari and Marchetti, using electron microscopy, were able to\nidentify intact variola virus from a sixteenth century Italian mummy. Both\ntheir articles stated that attempts would be undertaken to cultivate the\nvirus from the remains, but I was unable to locate subsequent\nreferences to determine if such efforts had been successful.\nKennedy discussed his work in exhuming remains in a Honolulu\ncemetery; among those buried were victims of an 1853 epidemic of\nsmallpox. After a review of the literature, Kennedy concludes that \"care\nshould be taken in the unlikely event that disturbances occur to\nindividuals with sealed coffins, and interred in very cool and dry regions.\nEven then, however, the victim must exhibit scabs, and there would\nhave to be direct contact.\"\nIn discussing similar work, Zuckerman concluded that \"it would be\nprudent to immunise anthropologists engaged in this type of research\nsince inadvertent reintroduction of smallpox would be devastating.\"\n\nReferences\n----------\nDownie AW and Dumbell KR, \"Survival of variola virus in dried exudate\nand crusts from smallpox patients,\" _Lancet_, 550-3, 1947.\nFornaciari G and Marchetti A, \"Intact smallpox virus particles in an Italian\nmummy of sixteenth century,\" _Lancet_, 2(8507):625, 1986.\nFornaciari G and Marchetti A, \"Intact smallpox virus particles in an Italian\nmummy of sixteenth century,\" _Lancet_, 2(8521-22):1469-70, 1986.\nKennedy J, \"The archaeological recovery of smallpox victims in Hawaii:\nScientific investigation or public health threat?,\" _Perspectives in Biology\nand Medicine_, 37(4):499-509, 1994.\nMacCallum FO and McDonald JR, \"Survival of variola virus in raw cotton,\"\n_Bulletin of the World Health Organization_, 16(2):247-54, 1957.\nMeers PD, \"Smallpox still entombed?,\" _Lancet_, 1(8437):1103, 1985.\nWolff HL and Croon JJ, \"The survival of smallpox virus (variola minor) in\nnatural circumstances,\" _Bulletin of the World Health Organization_,\n38(3):492-3, 1968.\nZuckerman AJ, \"Palaeontology of smallpox,\" _Lancet_, 2(8417-8):1454,\n1984.\n********************\nIf anyone would like copies of these articles, they can contact me\ndirectly; I'd be happy to forward them.\n--\nCurt Malloy\nResearch Associate\nMedical and Health Research Association of New York City, Inc.\nTEL: 212/285-0220\nFAX: 212/385-0565\n<CMALLOY@MHRA.ORG>\n...........................................................jw\n\n\n--\n*##########################################################*\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.
