Accessed 25 Sep 2019.\n\n[Comment in this report]\nAlthough smallpox has been eradicated from the world, there is a persistent concern that somewhere, somehow, it might escape from the laboratories where it is maintained under lock and key or is kept clandestinely. That would require rapid immunization of an enormous number of people to prevent its spread, with priority given to those providing care to infected individuals. A stock of vaccines for emergency use is essential. Like one's automobile insurance, one hopes never to use it, but it is essential to have when an unlikely accident occurs. The current smallpox vaccine has some limitations for use and carries a risk, albeit small, of serious adverse effects. Having a safe and effective vaccine to replace or supplement the current vaccine would be important.\n\nMonkeypox presents a different kind of public health problem. In Central Africa, it can cause serious disease with a case fatality rate of up to 10%. In West Africa, the virus clade present causes milder disease with few or no fatalities. In either instance, cases are sporadic and often occur in remote areas. Vaccination of people living in these remote areas for a disease that occurs sporadically would be logistically difficult and costly to administer. However, infected individuals in those foci could spread it to some other people with whom they have contact. Also, monkeypox-infected individuals have traveled to other countries, become ill there, and infect caregivers. Having a safe and effective vaccine under those circumstances would help to protect contacts if administered preventively in time for an immune response to occur before exposure to the virus. Because it is difficult to predict where those rare exposure events may occur, should all individuals in contact with patients receive the vaccine? The same question arises with universal vaccination of all caregivers everywhere in case smallpox should reappear.\n\nAssuming that production of the Jynneos nonreplicating smallpox vaccine can be ramped up quickly, it may provide the insurance against the reappearance of smallpox itself. Use of the vaccine in Africa to prevent monkeypox virus infections will depend on the priority given to it by ministries of health in those countries where cases occur and at a cost that can be afforded.\n\nThomas M.

The laboratory had been used by the NIH but was transferred to the FDA in 1972.\n\nWhen the scientists found the vials, they immediately put them in a containment lab, and on 1 Jul 2014 notified the branch of the government that deals with toxic substances, called the Division of Select Agents and Toxins. The CDC said previously there is no evidence that any of the vials was breached, nor were any of the lab workers exposed to the virus.\n\nOn Monday [7 Jul 2014], law enforcement agencies transferred the vials to the CDC's high-containment facility in Atlanta. The CDC is one of only 2 official World Health Organization designated repositories for smallpox. CDC Director Tom Frieden said his scientists worked through the night on the samples as soon as they got them. Testing confirmed that there was variola DNA in the vials. Additional test results showed 'evidence of growth' in samples from 2 of the vials, suggesting that the smallpox virus is alive.\n\nSmallpox, known also by its scientific name as variola, was the deadly virus that was the scourge of civilization for centuries. It's been considered an eradicated disease since 1980, following successful worldwide vaccination programs. The last known outbreak in the U.S. was in 1947 in New York.\n\nThe vials concerned were created on 10 Feb 1954, that is, before the smallpox eradication campaign began. Frieden says that the NIH is currently scouring their buildings to make sure there are no other surprises left in unused storerooms.

It\nwill be included in the Center for Disease\nControl and Prevention's (CDC) Strategic National\nStockpile of medical supplies.\nA worldwide vaccination program eradicated\nsmallpox in the population. The last case of\nnaturally occurring smallpox in the USA was in\n1949 and the last case in the world was reported\nin Somalia in 1977. Known stockpiles of the virus\nare kept only in 2 approved labs in the United\nStates and Russia. The CDC considers it a\nCategory A agent, meaning it presents one of the\ngreatest potential threats for harming public health.\nSmallpox is caused by the variola virus, a virus\nthat emerged in human populations thousands of\nyears ago. It spreads through close contact with\ninfected individuals or contaminated objects,\nsuch as bedding or clothing. There is no\nFDA-approved treatment for smallpox and the only prevention is vaccination.\n'The licensure of ACAM2000 supplements our\ncurrent supply of smallpox vaccine, meaning we\nare more prepared to protect the population\nshould the virus ever be used as a weapon,' said\nJesse L. Goodman, M.D., M.P.H., director of FDA's\nCenter for Biologics Evaluation and Research.\n'This vaccine is manufactured using modern cell\nculture technology allowing rapid and large scale\nproduction of a vaccine with consistent product quality.'\nThe symptoms of smallpox typically began with\nhigh fever, head and body aches. A rash followed\nthat spread and progressed to raised bumps and\npus-filled blisters that crusted, scabbed, and\nfell off after about 3 weeks, leaving a pitted\nscar. The fatality rate historically was about 30\npercent, according to the CDC.\nACAM2000 is made using a pox virus called\nvaccinia, which is related to but different from\nthe virus that causes smallpox. The vaccine\ncontains live vaccinia virus and works by causing\na mild infection that stimulates an immune\nresponse that effectively protects against\nsmallpox without actually causing the disease.\nThe vaccine is derived from the only other\nsmallpox vaccine licensed by FDA, Dryvax,\napproved in 1931 and now in limited supply\nbecause it is no longer manufactured.\nAlthough smallpox vaccination ended in the United\nStates in 1972 because it was no longer needed\nfor prevention, the U.S. military resumed\nvaccination of at-risk personnel in 1999, after\nconcluding that the disease posed a potential bioterrorism threat.\n'Smallpox could be a particularly dangerous\nbiological threat to us that would kill or\ndebilitate a high percentage of the population,'\nsaid Rear Adm. W. Craig Vanderwagen, M.D.,\nassistant secretary for preparedness and\nresponse, U.S. Department of Health and Human\nServices. 'The licensing of ACAM2000 will make us\nbetter prepared as a nation because it provides\nan important, effective tool for protecting first\nresponders and individuals with a high risk of\nexposure from this potentially lethal disease.'\nACAM2000 was studied in 2 populations: those who\nhad never been vaccinated for smallpox and those\nwho had received smallpox vaccination many years\nearlier. The percentage of unvaccinated persons\nwho developed a successful immunization reaction\nwas similar to that of Dryvax. ACAM2000 also was\nfound to be acceptable as a booster in those\npreviously vaccinated for smallpox.\nBecause ACAM2000 contains live vaccinia virus,\ncare must be taken to prevent the virus from\nspreading from the inoculation site to other\nparts of the body, and to other individuals.\nTo minimize known risks, the vaccine licensing is\nsubject to a Risk Minimization Action Plan\n(RiskMAP). The RiskMAP requires providers of the\nvaccine and patients to be educated about these\nand other risks. The RiskMAP also requires\npatient education through an FDA-approved\nMedication Guide for those who receive the vaccine.\nThe Medication Guide explains the proper care of\nthe vaccination site and provides information\nabout serious side effects that can occur with\nACAM2000. In studies, about 1 in 175 healthy\nadults who received smallpox vaccine for the 1st\ntime developed inflammation and swelling of the\nheart and/or surrounding tissues (myocarditis\nand/or pericarditis). Of the 10 affected adults,\n4 had no symptoms and at the end of the study,\nall but one had their symptoms resolve.\nACAM2000 is manufactured by Acambis Inc. of\nCambridge, England and Cambridge, MA.

The\nactual discussions can be found on pages\n42-53. To summarize, the ACAM2000 was compared\nto the presently used Dryvax vaccine. According\nto the document, 'The Safety Population consists\nof all subjects who received vaccination during\nthe clinical trials. The safety profile of\nACAM2000 was evaluated in a total of 2983\nsubjects (1307 vaccinia-naive and 1676 previously\nvaccinated) in doses ranging from 3.4\ufffd06 to\n2.2\ufffd08 PFU/mL [plaque forming units per\nmilliliter]. A total of 868 subjects (368\nvaccinia-naive and 500 previously vaccinated)\nreceived single cutaneous doses of Dryvax vaccine\nadministered at doses ranging from 1.0\ufffd08 to 1.6\ufffd08 PFU/mL.'\n'There were no fatalities during any clinical\nstudy of ACAM2000. Other [serious adverse events]\nSAEs occurred rarely (less than 1 percent) with\nACAM2000, with the most commonly reported SAEs\nbeing myocarditis and pregnancy (considered an\nSAE due to the potential risk of congenital\ninfection, although no cases of congenital infection were documented).'\nWith respect to myocarditis, '10 cases, 7 in\nsubjects treated with ACAM2000 (5.73 events per\nthousand vaccinations) and 3 in subjects treated\nwith Dryvax (10.38 events per thousand\nvaccinations), were reported in a total\nvaccinia-na\ufffd population of 1675 subjects, for a combined calculated\nincidence of 5.97 cases per thousand\nvaccinations. ....All subjects who experienced\nmyocarditis were previously na\ufffd to vaccinia; no\ncases were detected in previously vaccinated\nsubjects. ...Although the myocarditis incidence\nrate was higher in the Dryvax group (10.38 events\nper thousand vaccinations) there was no\nstatistically significant difference from the\nACAM2000 group (5.73 events per thousand vaccinations).'\n'Serious cardiac events other than myocarditis\nwere reported within 30 days after vaccination\nfor 4 previously vaccinated subjects, and\nincluded single reports of atrial fibrillation,\nchest discomfort, chest pain, and coronary artery\ndisease. All 3 events, except coronary artery\ndisease, were considered to have a possible\nrelationship to ACAM2000 as determined by the clinical investigator.'\nWith respect to pregnancy related events, the\nabove report mentioned 5 subjects who became\npregnant within 30 days after vaccination. Of\nthese 5, there were '2 spontaneous abortions, one\nlive birth, and one elective termination; the\nremaining subject was lost to follow-up. There\nwere no reports of fetal vaccinia, congenital\nanomalies, or birth defects. Of the 2 spontaneous\nabortions, one was considered to be unrelated to\nstudy vaccine. In the other case, neither\nsmallpox vaccination nor VIG [vaccinia immune\nglobulin] administration could be ruled out as risk factors.'\nThe report concludes: 'No other SAEs historically\nassociated with smallpox vaccine, including GV\n[generalized vaccinia], fetal vaccinia, ocular\nvaccinia, PVE [Post-vaccinial encephalopathy], PV\n[Progressive vaccinia], erythema multiforme, or\nEV [Eczema vaccinatum] [, were reported with\nACAM2000, although the studies were not powered\nto detect these SAEs historically associated with\nsmallpox vaccine. Other adverse reactions noted\nafter recent vaccination programs (including\nerythema multiforme major/ Stevens-Johnson\nsyndrome, dilated cardiomyopathy, and contact\ntransmission of vaccinia) have not been observed with ACAM2000.'\nIt should be noted at this point that a total\nstudy population of less than 3000 participants\nwill most likely not identify those serious\nadverse events (SAEs) that occur at a rate of 1\nper 10 000 or lower (0.01 percent). Hence, any\nconclusions re: the acceptable safety level of\nthe ACAM2000 have to be qualified by the fact\nthat the study sample was not large enough to detect all SAEs.\nTo put things into perspective, studies on rates\nof adverse events following receipt of the\npreviously available vaccine (Dryvax and other\npredecessors) were conducted in 1968 (see refs\nlisted below). In the 1968 studies, rashes\ndiagnosed as generalized vaccinia occurred at a\nrate of 242 per million primary vaccinations;\neczema vaccinatum was estimated to occur in 10-39\npersons per million primary vaccinations;\nprogressive vaccinia (or vaccinia necrosum),\noccurred in approximately 1-2 persons per million\nprimary vaccinations and postvaccinial\nencephalitis was been reported in 3-12 persons\nper million primary vaccinations. Clearly the\nstudies on this 'new vaccine' have not been\nsufficient to demonstrate that the safety of this\nvaccine is superior to the pre-existing Dryvax\nvaccine. One can't help but wonder what ever\nhappened to research on newer vaccines using\nnewer vaccine development technology that might\nresult in safer vaccines that would clearly tip\nthe balance of the risk benefit equation over to\na safer product to vaccinate a larger proportion\nof the population that would theoretically be at\nrisk of exposure should an accidental or\nintentional release of the smallpox virus occur?\nReferences:\n1.

The Indiana boy is in critical condition with\neczema vaccinatum, an unusual side effect of the smallpox vaccine\nthat can affect [unusually susceptible] people who receive the shot\nor their close contacts.\nDoctors also said the boy appears to have passed the infection to his\nmother, who has a much milder case of the virus in the smallpox\nvaccine, which is also called vaccinia virus. The virus is not\nsmallpox, though it is similar enough to offer protection from that\ndeadly disease, which was declared eradicated in 1980.\nThe mother and child are being treated at the University of Chicago's\n[U. of C] Comer Children's Hospital, which withheld their names at\nthe family's request. There is no infection risk for the general\npopulation, government officials say, since the vaccine virus can\nspread only through close physical contact.\nBut the boy's diagnosis last week has prompted a frenzy of activity\nand daily conference calls involving the federal Centers for Disease\nControl and Prevention [CDC], the U.S. Department of Defense, and the\nstate and city public health departments. The U.S. Food and Drug\nAdministration [FDA] gave emergency authorization for the hospital to\ntreat the boy with ST-246, an experimental drug for smallpox that is\nuntried as a therapy in humans.\nThe smallpox vaccine fell out of general use in the 1970s, but the\ncase could be a lesson for the U.S. military, which has vaccinated\n1.2 million personnel against smallpox since 2002 amid fears of bioterrorism.\nIt's unclear why the father was allowed to have contact with his son,\nwho had a history of eczema, shortly after the vaccination. The skin\ncondition is a well-known risk factor for eczema vaccinatum, and\nofficial guidelines warn that people with eczema should avoid contact\nwith vaccinees. 'We are looking into how this could have happened,'\nsaid U.S. Army spokesman Paul Boyce.\nOfficials say the general population could receive smallpox\nvaccinations in the event of a bioterrorist attack or other\nunforeseen exposure. For that reason, experts want to study the\nIndiana family to learn more about treatment and transmission of the\nvaccinia infection. 'There certainly are also conceivable insights\ninto smallpox infection,' said Dr. Inger Damon, chief of the CDC's\npoxvirus and rabies branch. Damon has been involved in the daily\nconference calls on the boy's treatment. Experts said they knew of no\ncases of eczema vaccinatum since at least 1990, when the military\nlast had a program of smallpox vaccination. The vaccinia virus in\nmodern smallpox vaccines is closely related to an older form of\nvaccinia called cowpox, the disease English doctor Edward Jenner used\nin the late 1700s to develop early methods of vaccination. Jenner\nrelied on the observation that milkmaids who had cowpox seemed to be\nprotected from later smallpox infection. He found that patients\ninoculated with material from cowpox sores also got protection from\nsmallpox. That history is why the word vaccine stems from the Latin\nword for cow. Vaccinia was modified from its original form over the\nyears but remains an infectious agent with the potential for side effects.\nThe father of the Indiana boy received the vaccine in late January\n2007 before a planned military deployment. The Army delayed his\ndeparture and permitted him to visit his family in mid-February 2007.\nTwo weeks later, a rash broke out on the boy's skin. He came to the\nU. of C. on 3 Mar 2007 after being transferred from St. Catherine's\nHospital in East Chicago. Doctors 1st identified his widespread rash\nas a different form of eczema, but it worsened in his 1st few days at\nthe U. of C. His mother developed sores after she and her son arrived\nat the Chicago hospital. Doctors believe she contracted the disease\nfrom the boy because of their lengthy close contact.\nA pediatric dermatologist, Dr. Sarah Stein, noticed the boy's lesions\nhad changed to look like round blisters with a dimple in the middle,\na potential sign of vaccinia infection. The medical team took\nscrapings from the lesions, which they analyzed and sent to the\nIllinois Department of Public Health's Chicago office for further\ntesting. Rapid tests by the state and further tests at the CDC\nconfirmed the boy had the vaccinia virus, officials at those agencies\nsaid. The hospital also sent the CDC photos of the boy's lesions.\nThe hospital already was using infection precautions with the boy,\nbut staffers then added such measures as gloves and face masks. They\nalso placed the boy in a room with negative pressure so the air would\nalways blow inward, keeping the virus inside. The boy's rash had\nspread to cover 80 percent of his body, said Dr. Madelyn Kahana,\nchief of pediatric intensive care medicine at the U. of C. He was\ngoing into sepsis, a devastating, system-wide infection rarely seen\nwith viral cases. 'In the later stages of [eczema vaccinatum], it can\nlook like smallpox,' said Damon of the CDC. The boy needed a\nventilator to help his breathing because of the powerful pain\nmedication he needed for the lesions.\nThe boy received the primary treatment for eczema vaccinatum, a drug\ncalled vaccinia immune globulin, or VIG. The drug came from a\nstockpile the CDC keeps in case widespread vaccination ever becomes\nnecessary. He also got an antiviral drug called cidofovir and the\nexperimental drug ST-246, which has been shown to protect laboratory\nanimals from exposure to smallpox. The drug recently entered\npreliminary human trials but had never been used in a sick patient.\nU. of C. officials said the boy has shown signs of improvement since\nhitting a low point last weekend. His mother's health was never in\nserious danger, but she has remained in his hospital room to keep\nothers from being exposed. Health officials in Chicago and Indiana\nhave tracked all of the family's contacts and found no additional\ncases so far. Kahana said the boy probably will lose 20 percent of\nhis outer skin layer, but she hopes he will recover without the need\nfor skin grafts. She believes the case should be a lesson to the\nmilitary, which must educate service members about the risks of the\nvaccines it requires them to take. 'I think the information simply\nwasn't disseminated properly or impressed in a manner that was\nunderstood,' Kahana said, 'because I don't think anyone would\nknowingly expose their child to this.'\n[Byline: Jeremy Manier]\n--\nThomas Roesel\n<roesel@lycos.com>\n******\n[2]\nDate: 18 Mar 2007\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: Chicago Sun-Times [edited]\n<http://www.suntimes.com/news/metro/302333,CST-NWS-VACCINE18.article>\n\nDad's smallpox shot infects son, 2; Experimental drugs bring Indiana\nboy back from brink of death\n-----------------------------------------------\nA 2-year-old boy stricken with a rare infection from the smallpox\nvaccine is improving but remained in critical condition Saturday [17\nMar 2007] at the Comer Children's Hospital at the University of\nChicago [U. of C.]. The boy was infected by his father, a U.S.\nsoldier who was vaccinated in January 2007 in preparation for service\nin Iraq. But his deployment was delayed, and he returned home to\nIndiana late last month. His son, who suffers from skin lesions known\nas eczema, then became infected by vaccinia, a virus similar to\nsmallpox and used in the vaccine against it.\nThe boy is the 1st person to suffer from the severe infection, known\nas eczema vaccinatum since the U.S. military began inoculating troops\nin 2002. But his condition is so uncommon that U. of C. experts said\nthey could not find reports of any cases in the United States since\nbefore 1972, when routine vaccinations for smallpox were halted.\n'This is something that is new to us,' said Kenneth Alexander, head\nof pediatric infectious disease at U. of C. The boy, whose name was\nnot released, was sent to U. of C. from a northwest Indiana hospital\non 3 Mar 2007 after he developed a severe rash. He didn't improve\nafter treatment, and by 7 Mar 2007, a dermatologist noticed his\nlesions resembled those caused by smallpox, something doctors had\nonly seen in photos because the disease was eradicated.\nDoctors contacted the federal Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention [CDC], which agreed to fly in a treatment never used on a\nchild, vaccinia immune globulin (VIG). The drug was hand-delivered by\nU.S. marshals.\nThe boy's condition continued to worsen, and last weekend, his lungs\nand kidneys began to fail. 'He was near death,' said Madelyn Kahana,\nchief of pediatric critical care medicine. Painful skin lesions\ncovered most of his body.\nThe CDC then asked the Food and Drug Administration [FDA] to grant\nemergency permission to try ST-246, an experimental drug being\ndeveloped to fight smallpox. It had been effective in treating mice\nand monkeys infected with the virus, said U. of C. pediatrician John\nMarcinak, who is spearheading the boy's treatment. But it had never\nbeen used on a sick person. That, combined with VIG and another drug,\nseems to be working. Since he 1st got the drug on 11 Mar 2007, 'he is\nslowly improving,' Marcinak said.\nThe boy's mother contracted a milder form of the vaccinia virus from\nthe boy and has been quarantined in the boy's room but is recovering\nwell, officials said.\nDoctors said the father -- who has since returned from his deployment\nat the hospital's urging -- had no idea he should stay away from his\nson after receiving the vaccine. Kahana said the 'military has to be\ncareful' in making sure soldiers understand the risks and that they\nstay away from high-risk populations, such as people with\neczema. 'They are trying to figure out where the misstep was,' she\nsaid of the military. A military spokesman could not be reached\nSaturday [17 Mar 2007].\nThe boy has 2 siblings, but no one else appears to have been\ninfected, doctors said. The hospital has taken extreme precautions in\ntreating the boy, including keeping him in a room where the air only\nflows inward. Officials say the general public is not at risk because\nthe infection is only transmitted through close physical contact.\n[Byline: Dave Newbart]\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[Following the intentional release of anthrax spores [in letters] in\nthe USA in October 2001, the USA decided to embark upon vaccination\ncampaigns with the smallpox vaccine. During the period leading up to\nthe vaccination activities, ProMED-mail had significant coverage of\nthe discussions on the risks and benefits of using the smallpox\nvaccine that was available at that time (and is still the vaccine being used).\nIn a prior ProMED-mail posting Smallpox vaccine, ACIP recommendations\n- USA (02) 20020621.4560, this moderator presented a discussion on\nthe risks of vaccination with the currently available vaccine. Kemper\net al. did a 'back of the envelope' presentation of possible risks\nassociated with smallpox vaccination for the Effective Clinical\nPractice, March/April 2002 issue of the American College of\nPhysicians (ACP) journal. They concluded:\n'After excluding high-risk individuals and their contacts, we\nestimate that a vaccination strategy directed at people aged one to\n29 years would result in approximately 1600 serious adverse events\nand 190 deaths. Vaccinating people aged one to 65 years would result\nin approximately 4600 serious adverse events and 285 deaths.\nLimitations: While advances in health care over the past 3 decades\ncould mitigate vaccine complications, the increased number of\nun-immunized high-risk individuals (e.g., those with eczema or immune\nsuppression) could increase complication rates.'\nThey then went on to discuss the limitations and additional dangers\nto 'high-risk' individuals of a mass immunization campaign. 'We\nassumed that individuals would be screened before vaccination for\nrisk factors, such as eczema, immunodeficiency, or pregnancy, in\nthemselves or in their close contacts. The prevalence of eczema and\nthe number of immunocompromised individuals have increased over the\npast 3 decades. High-risk populations would be excluded from\nvaccination, as would their potential contacts, since recent vaccine\nrecipients are 'infectious' and can transmit the virus (vaccinia).\nIndividuals with eczema are at high risk for developing eczema\nvaccinatum. The prevalence of eczema is at least 10 percent, or more\nthan 28 million people in the United States. Immunocompromised\npersons are at high risk for progressive vaccinia. We know of no\noverall estimate for the number of immunocompromised individuals in\nthe United States. This number would include recipients of organ\ntransplants (184 000 solid-organ transplants in the 1990s),\nindividuals with diagnosed and undiagnosed HIV infection or AIDS (850\n000), and patients with cancer (approximately 8.5 million). We\nestimate, therefore, that in the entire U.S. population as many as 10\nmillion individuals (3.6 percent) may be at increased risk for\ndeveloping progressive vaccinia.\nTherefore, approximately 15 percent of the population may have\nincreased risk for a direct adverse event after smallpox vaccination.\nIn addition to exclusion of these individuals from vaccination,\npersons in close contact with them should not be vaccinated to avoid\ninadvertent transmission and subsequent indirect adverse events.\nClose contacts would include, at minimum, household members.\nInsufficient data are available to estimate precisely the number of\nclose contacts who would be excluded from a vaccination campaign. We\nestimate that another 10 percent of the population would be excluded.\nOn the basis of the foregoing, we further estimate that 25 percent of\nthe population would be excluded from vaccination because of high\nrisk or the possibility of coming in contact with a high-risk individual'\n<http://www.acponline.org/journals/ecp/marapr02/kemper>.\nThe incident discussed in this current posting relates to a vaccine\nrecipient exposing a family member with a disease that is a known\nhigh risk for complications following vaccination with the smallpox\nvaccine (eczema in an individual or close contact of an individual is\na reason to self exclude from receipt of smallpox vaccine). Self\nexclusion from events for medical reasons involves a very complicated\nset of issues for the individual who needs to self exclude. In the\nabove incident, the father theoretically should have self excluded\nfrom receipt of the vaccine, or if not, should not have gone to his\nhome to expose his son (and wife) to the vaccine virus. But how easy\nis/was it for a military recruit about to be deployed to (1) self\nexclude from the vaccination (and risk losing his deployment\npossibilities and possible promotions related to the service) and (2)\nrefuse to visit with his family prior to deployment that would\ntheoretically remove him from the possibility of seeing his family for months?\nOne is also reminded of a generalized vaccinia infection that\noccurred in Israel during their vaccination campaign in 2002. In the\nprior ProMED-mail posting Smallpox vaccination strategy - Israel (03)\n20021222.6113, we carried the following: 'An Israeli surgeon ignored\nwarnings that people should not be vaccinated if someone at home has\nlow immunity. His wife was on medication that lowers immunity. The\nsurgeon infected her with the vaccinia virus, a cousin of smallpox.'\nAgain, reasons for non-appropriate self exclusion are very complex.\nThe occurrence of a secondary contact case in the above household\nsuggests that perhaps the mother of the child may have had a similar\npredisposing immune disorder, making her at risk of contact for\nvaccinia infection as well.\nAs the risk of infection with variola virus is presently a\ntheoretical risk of intentional release of smallpox virus as part of\na biological warfare act, the risk of adverse events from the use of\nthe current vaccine remains significantly higher. A question that\ncomes to mind is whether we are any closer to having a safer vaccine\nfor use among those individuals felt to be at high risk of early\nexposure to intentionally released smallpox virus. - Mod.MPP]\n[Report [2] above indicates that the soldier did not self-exclude for\nselfish reasons, but because he had not heard of any\ncontra-indication to exposing his son.

The patient reported having\na new male sex partner during the period 22 Sep to 1 Oct 2006. A\nviral swab specimen from a labial lesion of the woman was submitted\nto the Alaska State Virology Laboratory (ASVL) for viral culture. The\nviral isolate could not be identified initially and subsequently was\nsent to CDC on 9 Jan 2007, where the isolate was identified as a\nvaccine-strain vaccinia virus. After vaccinia was identified,\ninvestigators interviewed the woman more closely and learned that her\nnew sex partner was a male U.S. military service member stationed at\na local military base. Further investigation determined that the\nservice member had been vaccinated for smallpox 3 days before\nbeginning his relationship with the woman. This report describes the\nclinical evaluation of the woman and laboratory testing performed to\nidentify the isolate. Health-care providers should be aware of the\npossibility of vaccinia infection in persons with clinically\ncompatible genital lesions who have had recent contact with smallpox vaccinees.\nClinical Description\n------------------\nAt the public health clinic on 10 Oct 2006, the woman told\nhealth-care providers that her partner consistently wore condoms\nduring sex; however, a condom broke during vaginal intercourse on 1\nOct 2006. The 2 had no further contact after 1 Oct 2006. The patient\ntold health-care providers she did not recall seeing penile ulcers or\nother unusual skin lesions on her partner. She had no history of\ngenital ulcers or sexually transmitted infections and said that her\nvaginal tears did not result from sexual violence or abuse. She\nreported testing negative for human immunodeficiency virus\napproximately 3 months earlier. She had no fever, itching, or dysuria.\nClinical examination revealed 2 shallow ulcerations, one measuring 5\nmm on the upper left labia minora and the other measuring 3 mm on the\nlower right labia minora, mild bilateral labial erythema and\ninduration, and vaginal discharge. No inguinal lymphadenopathy was\nnoted, and examination findings were normal for the cervix, uterus,\nadnexa, and anus. Tests for gonorrhea and _Chlamydia trachomatis_\ninfection were negative; serologic tests for syphilis and hepatitis B\nvirus were not performed. A viral swab specimen from the left labial\nlesion was submitted to ASVL for culture for possible herpes virus\ninfection. A primary diagnosis of sexually transmitted infection was\nmade but was not further characterized, and no specific treatment was\nadministered pending viral culture results. A secondary diagnosis of\nvulvovaginal candidiasis was made, and the patient was treated with\nan over-the-counter medication.\nAfter 2 days of increased redness, swelling, and burning of the labia\nminora, the woman returned to the clinic on 12 Oct 2006. The\nevaluating health-care provider diagnosed cellulitis, discontinued\nthe over-the-counter preparation, and prescribed a 7-day course of\noral cephalexin (500 mg by mouth, twice a day). No specimens were\ncollected during the 2nd clinic visit. The patient's labial redness,\ninduration, and pain resolved, and the ulcers healed completely by 10 Oct 2006.\nLaboratory Findings\n-------------------\nAt ASVL, viral cytopathic effect was observed in viral culture cells\nfrom the specimen collected from the woman on 10 Oct 2006; however,\nimmunofluorescent antibody staining was negative for herpes simplex\nvirus (HSV). During late October to November 2006, the viral isolate\nwas successfully passaged into 2 additional viral culture cell lines,\nbut subsequent staining of the viral isolate also was negative for\nHSV and cytomegalovirus. The viral isolate was submitted on 22 Nov\n2006 to a 2nd reference laboratory, where it remained unidentified\none month later.\nOn 9 Jan 2007, ASVL sent the unidentified viral isolate to CDC, where\nthe isolate was evaluated using 2 pathogen-discovery strategies: a\npan-herpes virus polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test and a\ndeoxyribonuclease sequence-independent, single-primer amplification\n(DNase-SISPA) sequencing method,* in which a specimen is treated with\nDNase, followed by nucleic acid extraction, random amplification,\nrestriction enzyme digestion, and SISPA of the restriction fragments.\nAlthough the pan-herpes virus PCR assay was negative, the DNase-SISPA\nmethod produced unique and prominent DNA fragments in the unknown\nisolate but not in the control cells. The PCR product containing\nthese fragments was cloned and sequenced. Eight of 9 sequenced clones\nof the bands matched vaccinia virus sequences. Additional PCR testing\nby the CDC Poxvirus Laboratory identified the isolate as being\nconsistent with a vaccine-strain vaccinia virus. On 30 Jan 2007, CDC\nnotified ASVL of the results, which were immediately relayed to the\nAlaska Section of Epidemiology.\nEpidemiologic Investigation\n-------------------------\nAfter receiving notification of the laboratory result, Alaska state\nhealth officials interviewed the patient and learned that she lived\nalone and had never been vaccinated against smallpox. However, the\npatient told investigators that her recent sex partner was a U.S.\nservice member stationed at a local military base and that he had\nbeen her only sex partner during the period from one month before her\ninfection until the time her ulcers were completely healed (1 Sep to\n19 Oct 2006). The patient also told investigators that her sexual\ncontact with her recent partner had included manual stimulation in\naddition to vaginal intercourse. The patient did not remember seeing\nbandages on her partner and did not know whether he had received any\nrecent vaccinations.\nThe service member was deployed overseas in late October 2006 and was\nnot available for interview. According to the preventive medicine\nofficer at the military base where the service member was stationed,\nthe service member had reported no underlying skin disorders or other\ncontraindications to vaccination. He had received smallpox\nvaccination on 19 Sep 2006, after 1st receiving instruction on care\nof the vaccination site and proper hand hygiene. Investigators\nidentified no additional transmission of the virus from the vaccinee\nand no transmission from the woman to other persons, including\nhealth-care providers who had examined her.\n[Reported by: J McLaughlin, MD, Alaska Section of Epidemiology; T\nSchmidt, MS, M Westcott, Alaska State Virology Laboratory.

Unintentional transfer of\nvaccinia virus can occur from a vaccination site to a 2nd site on the\nvaccinee (inadvertent autoinoculation) or to a close contact (contact\ntransmission)\n(<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5501a1.htm>1).\nThe most frequently reported sites of vaccinia infections caused by\nunintentional transfer are the face, nose, mouth, lips, genitalia,\nanus, and eye\n(<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5501a1.htm>1).\nTo prevent transfers, health-care providers should educate vaccinees\nregarding proper hand washing after bandage changes or other contact\nwith the vaccination site\n(<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5204a1.htm>2).\nThis general recommendation remains the most effective way to prevent\ngenital vaccinia infections. Persons with any new genital lesion,\nincluding lesions suspected to have been caused by vaccinia\ninfection, should avoid sexual contact and consult a health-care provider.\nVulvar vaccinia infections often are characterized by painful labial\nulcers and/or vesicles, vulvar edema and pruritus, vaginal discharge,\nand occasionally by vaginitis and tender bilateral inguinal\nlymphadenopathy (3--9). Most reports of vulvar vaccinia were\npublished before cessation of widespread smallpox vaccination\nprograms (7); however, in addition to the case described in this\nreport, laboratory-confirmed cases of vulvar vaccinia after sexual\ncontact with vaccinated military personnel have been reported in New\nYork and Texas since the U.S. military resumed smallpox vaccination\nin 2002 (8,9). Similar to the case described in this report, herpes\nvirus infection was initially suspected in the New York case, and\ninformation regarding contact with a recent smallpox vaccinee was not\ndisclosed until after laboratory evidence of vaccinia virus had been detected.\nLaboratory confirmation of orthopoxvirus infections, including\nvaccinia, requires test methods that are not commercially available.\nHowever, tests for orthopoxvirus infections are available at many\nstate and local health departments via the Laboratory Response\nNetwork, and confirmatory (i.e., species-specific) testing is\navailable at CDC. In the case described in this report, initial\ntesting of clinical specimens for presumed herpes virus infection at\nASVL was inconclusive. In the absence of critical information (i.e.\npatient contact with a recent smallpox vaccinee) to guide testing of\nthe isolate, ASVL forwarded the specimen to CDC. Identification of\nvaccinia as the etiologic agent illustrates the power of using\nmultiple new tools for identifying pathogens in patients with a\ndisease of unknown etiology.\nSince 8 Mar 2007, CDC and the U.S. Department of Defense have\nreceived reports of 4 instances of nongenital contact vaccinia\nassociated with recently vaccinated service members, including 2\ncases from Indiana and one case each from Alabama and New Mexico.\nHealth-care providers and public health professionals should ask\nabout any contact with recent smallpox vaccinees when evaluating\npatients with vesicular lesions compatible with vaccinia. Early\nidentification of such contact can guide diagnostic tests, allow for\ntimely contact tracing and clinical intervention, and facilitate\nprompt patient counseling to prevent further transmission of the virus.\nAcknowledgments\n----------------\nThe findings in this report are based, in part, on contributions by\nthe examining health-care provider and the preventive medicine\nofficer at the military base.\nReferences\n----------\n(1) CDC.

During recent vaccination programs\npotential cases of PV were investigated, but none met standard case\ndefinitions (2). PV has not been confirmed to have occurred in the\nUnited States since 1987 (3). On [2 Mar 2009], a US Navy Hospital\ncontacted the Poxvirus Program at CDC to report a possible case of PV\nin a male military smallpox vaccinee. The service member had been\nnewly diagnosed with acute myelogenous leukemia M0 (AML M0). During\nevaluation for a chemotherapy-induced neutropenic fever, he was found\nto have an expanding and nonhealing painless vaccination site 6.5\nweeks after receipt of smallpox vaccine. Clinical and laboratory\ninvestigation confirmed that the vaccinee met the Brighton\nCollaboration and CDC adverse event surveillance guideline case\ndefinition for PV (4,5). This report summarizes the patient's\nprotracted clinical course and the military and civilian interagency\ngovernmental, academic, and industry public health contributions to\nhis complex medical management. The quantities of investigational and\nlicensed therapeutics and diagnostics used were greater than\nanticipated based on existing smallpox preparedness plans. To support\nfuture public health needs adequately, the estimated national supply\nof therapeutics and diagnostic resources required to care for\nsmallpox vaccine adverse events should be reevaluated.\n\nCase description\n----------------\nOn 13 Jan 2009, a healthy service member aged 20 years received a\nprimary smallpox vaccination (ACAM2000 [Acambis, Inc., Cambridge,\nMassachusetts]) in accordance with the US Department of Defense\nsmallpox vaccination policy*; no other vaccinations were administered\nthat day. Twelve days later, the patient visited a local hospital\nwith fever and headache of one day's duration and was admitted for\nworkup of leukopenia after his white blood cell count was found to be\n1400 cells/mm3. On [28 Jan 2009], after transfer to a US Navy\ntertiary-care facility, he was diagnosed with AML M0. On [30 Jan and\n13 Feb 2009], the patient underwent 2 successive rounds of induction\nchemotherapy with cytarabine, idarubicin, and dexamethasone. Before\ninitial chemotherapy, the vaccination site pustule had a central\ncrust and measured approximately 1 cm [0.4 in] in diameter with\nminimal surrounding erythema. During the patient's hospital stay from\nthe end of January to the beginning of March [2009], his vaccination\nsite dressing was changed daily.\n\nOn [2 Mar 2009], during the evaluation of neutropenic fever, the\nfailure of the patient's vaccination site to heal was described. An\nannular lesion with a deep bulla, raised violaceous leading edge, and\na central crust that bled with pressure was noted. The size of the\nlesion had progressed to approximately 4 x 4 cm [1.6 x 1.6 in] with\nminimal surrounding erythema or induration. The patient described no\npain at the site, although he reported occasional pruritus. A swab of\nthe lesion and serum were sent to CDC for viral and serologic\nanalysis. Viral analysis of the swab by multiple real-time polymerase\nchain reaction (PCR) assays for orthopoxvirus and vaccinia yielded\nevidence of viral DNA; viral culture was positive for orthopoxvirus.\nSerum showed equivocal to absent levels of anti-orthopoxvirus\nimmunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin M (IgM) by enzyme-linked\nimmunosorbent assay. The results of the diagnostic testing combined\nwith the patient's medical history met the PV level 1 case definition\nas defined by the Brighton Collaboration and the confirmed case\ndefinition as described by CDC surveillance guidelines (4,5). The\ncriteria met by both case definitions were 1) a documented clinical\ndiagnosis of a disease that is known to be associated with\ncell-mediated immunodeficiency (in this case AML M0), 2) the primary\nvaccination site's failure to resolve (in this case more than 6 weeks\npost vaccination), and 3) the laboratory confirmation of vaccinia\nvirus as the causative agent.\n\nOn [3 Mar 2009], imiquimod was applied directly to the lesion. Within\n24 hours of confirmation of PV on [4 Mar 2009], the patient received\nlicensed Vaccinia Immune Globulin Intravenous (Human) (VIGIV)\n(Cangene Corporation, Winnipeg, Canada). On [5 Mar and 6 Mar 2009],\noral and topical ST-246 (SIGA Technologies, Corvallis, Oregon) were\nadministered under an Emergency Investigational New Drug (E-IND)\napplication. The patient remained stable until the evening of [7 Mar\n2009], when he became septic with _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_, likely\nfrom a perirectal abscess. He required intubation, maximal\nvasopressor support, multiple antibiotics, and stress dose\ncorticosteroids. He then developed multiorgan failure and began\ncontinuous venovenous hemodialysis. During the next 12 days, the\npatient slowly stabilized. As a consequence of the duration and\namount of vasopressor support, the patient required a bilateral\ntrans-tibial amputation because of dry gangrene of his feet.\n\nDuring [6-19 Mar 2009] the patient received additional oral and\ntopical ST-246 and VIGIV; his ST-246 levels were noted to be lower\nthan those achieved both in healthy subjects in phase I clinical\ntrials and in successful treatment of nonhuman primates with systemic\northopoxvirus disease. The lesion size remained unchanged, but the\ncentral crust of the vaccination site sloughed off, followed by most\nof the outer 'ring' flattening, leaving a shallow ulcer with\nhealthy-appearing granulation tissue. During his steroid taper,\nadditional satellite lesions surrounding the vaccination site\nappeared on [18 Mar 2009], and viral DNA was detected again in the\nblood. These lesions became vesicular in nature, and on [26 Mar\n2009], after a 2nd E-IND was issued, CMX001 (Chimerix, Inc., Research\nTriangle Park, North Carolina), a lipid conjugate of cidofovir, was\nadministered.\n\nFrom [24 Mar 2009] onward, the satellite and main vaccination site\nlesions continued to crust, the scabs separated, and underlying\ntissue epithelialized. Blood viral DNA levels cleared on [29 Mar\n2009]. On [10 Apr 2009], the borders of lesions again appeared\nraised; a shave biopsy grew methicillin-resistant _Staphylococcus\naureus_, which responded to antibiotic therapy. The patient received\nintermittent granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, and his absolute\nneutrophil and lymphocyte count increased over time. By [1 May 2009],\nsignificant portions of the scabs/eschars had fallen off or were\nremoved manually, revealing healthy epidermis. Numerous therapeutics\nwith different biologic mechanisms were used to treat PV in this patient.\n\nFrom [21 Feb 2009] onward, the patient had remained in contact\nisolation, first for a _Clostridium difficile_ infection and then for\nhis progressive vaccinia infection. On [5 May 2009], contact\nprecautions were discontinued because of the lack of viable virus in\nlesion specimens from the previous 4 weeks. No cases of contact\nvaccinia were identified among this patient's health-care workers or\nclose contacts.\n\nDuring [3 Mar-18 May 2009], nearly 200 clinical specimens (lesion and\nsatellite swabs/crusts, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid [EDTA] blood,\nbone marrow, and serum) were collected and submitted to CDC to\nevaluate disease progression and guide therapeutic interventions.\nAfter [23 Apr 2009], swabs from satellite lesions or the main\nvaccination site showed significantly reduced or absent levels of\nviral DNA, and no viable virus was detected after [2 Apr 2009].\nOropharyngeal sampling and bone marrow biopsies from early and late\nMarch [2009], respectively, were negative for vaccinia virus.\nOrthopoxvirus DNA was detected in EDTA blood at intermittent times\nduring the course of the patient's infection; however, no viable\nvirus was cultured from blood.

Extensive surgical debridement\nwas sometimes required, even necessitating disarticulation of the arm\nto 'debulk' the amount of infectious material (7). Before smallpox\nvaccination, patients are screened for numerous contraindications\n(8). At the time of his vaccination, the patient described in this\nreport did not have any obvious signs or symptoms that would meet any\nexclusion criteria for vaccination. Training in use of, and careful\nadherence to, screening tools can identify vaccine candidates at risk\nfor PV and other adverse events (2). Despite this, vaccinees with\noccult immunodeficiencies might not be recognized, and therefore\nappropriately deferring vaccination in these persons is not always possible.\n\nLack of inflammation at the expanding vaccination site is the\nhallmark of PV. Any smallpox vaccinee who has an expanding,\nnonhealing, painless vaccination site without inflammation for more\nthan 2 weeks should be evaluated for an underlying immunodeficiency,\nand diagnosis of and treatment for PV should be considered.\nHealth-care providers should report suspected cases of PV or other\nadverse events to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS).\nSuspected cases of PV also should be reported to state health\nofficials and CDC for clinical consultation and to obtain select\ntherapeutics available only through the SNS. State health departments\nshould call the CDC Emergency Operations Center at 770-488-7100.\n\nThis patient's protracted clinical course is consistent with\npreviously published cases reports and surveillance summaries. The\ndevelopment of progressive vaccinia, historically observed in\npatients with cellular immunodeficiencies, often leads to\nsuperinfection and subsequent sepsis (that is, fungal, parasitic, and\nbacterial infections resulting in toxic or septicemic shock, then\nultimately death). Past treatment typically included massive doses of\nVIG, administration of thiosemicarbazone, blood products, and\nsupportive care for accompanying infections (7,9). The improvement of\nprogressive vaccinia in this patient was associated with receipt of\nVIGIV (the only licensed product for treatment of vaccinia adverse\nevents stockpiled by the SNS), ST-246, and CMX001, and an increase in\nlymphocyte count. The use of 2 antiviral agents with different\nmechanisms of action (see note 1) was enabled by the research and\ndevelopment of medical countermeasures for smallpox preparedness\nactivities, as well as the use of the emergency IND process. As of\n[18 May 2009], the patient had shed nearly all of the scab material\non and around the vaccination site.\n\nThe rapid mobilization of military, CDC, FDA, NIH, drug manufacturer,\nand academic and health-care human resources to review the case's\nstatus and to provide daily, then biweekly laboratory findings that\nguided treatment recommendations, was enabled by smallpox public\nhealth preparedness research and training efforts.\n\nContinuing medical education and reinforcement of training related to\nthe prevention, early recognition, and treatment of smallpox\nvaccine-related adverse events should be part of smallpox vaccination\nprograms. The patient described in this report received VIGIV in the\namount originally estimated to treat 30 persons. The extraordinary\namounts of VIGIV used to treat this single case of PV underscore the\nneed to reevaluate the adequacy of the national stockpiled supply of\nthis or other medical countermeasures (treatment or prophylactic).\nSuch reevaluation, with additional focus on immunocompromised hosts,\nwill aid in the smallpox vaccination program planning and overall\nsmallpox preparedness efforts.\n\nReferences\n----------\n1.

On 13 Jan 2009, a healthy service member aged 20 years received a\nprimary smallpox vaccination (ACAM2000 [Acambis, Inc., Cambridge,\nMassachusetts]) in accordance with the US Department of Defense\nsmallpox vaccination policy*; no other vaccinations were administered\nthat day. During [6-19 Mar 2009] the patient received additional oral and\ntopical ST-246 and VIGIV; his ST-246 levels were noted to be lower\nthan those achieved both in healthy subjects in phase I clinical\ntrials and in successful treatment of nonhuman primates with systemic\northopoxvirus disease. The rapid mobilization of military, CDC, FDA, NIH, drug manufacturer,\nand academic and health-care human resources to review the case's\nstatus and to provide daily, then biweekly laboratory findings that\nguided treatment recommendations, was enabled by smallpox public\nhealth preparedness research and training efforts. The improvement of\nprogressive vaccinia in this patient was associated with receipt of\nVIGIV (the only licensed product for treatment of vaccinia adverse\nevents stockpiled by the SNS), ST-246, and CMX001, and an increase in\nlymphocyte count. Progressive vaccinia (PV), previously known as vaccinia necrosum,\nvaccinia gangrenosum, or disseminated vaccinia, is a rare, often\nfatal adverse event after vaccination with smallpox vaccine, which is\nmade from live vaccinia virus (1). \n\nContinuing medical education and reinforcement of training related to\nthe prevention, early recognition, and treatment of smallpox\nvaccine-related adverse events should be part of smallpox vaccination\nprograms. Although PV is a rare adverse event (one case per million during\nroutine vaccination during 1963-1968), its case fatality rate in\nprimary US vaccinees was 15 percent despite treatment with massive\namounts of VIG (intramuscular) (6). Nell P, Kohl KS, Graham PL, et al: Progressive vaccinia as an\nadverse event following exposure to vaccinia virus: case definition\nand guidelines of data collection, analysis, and presentation of\nimmunization safety data. Any smallpox vaccinee who has an expanding,\nnonhealing, painless vaccination site without inflammation for more\nthan 2 weeks should be evaluated for an underlying immunodeficiency,\nand diagnosis of and treatment for PV should be considered. During his steroid taper,\nadditional satellite lesions surrounding the vaccination site\nappeared on [18 Mar 2009], and viral DNA was detected again in the\nblood. \nSuch reevaluation, with additional focus on immunocompromised hosts,\nwill aid in the smallpox vaccination program planning and overall\nsmallpox preparedness efforts. During\nevaluation for a chemotherapy-induced neutropenic fever, he was found\nto have an expanding and nonhealing painless vaccination site 6.5\nweeks after receipt of smallpox vaccine. The results of the diagnostic testing combined\nwith the patient's medical history met the PV level 1 case definition\nas defined by the Brighton Collaboration and the confirmed case\ndefinition as described by CDC surveillance guidelines (4,5). Within\n24 hours of confirmation of PV on [4 Mar 2009], the patient received\nlicensed Vaccinia Immune Globulin Intravenous (Human) (VIGIV)\n To support\nfuture public health needs adequately, the estimated national supply\nof therapeutics and diagnostic resources required to care for\nsmallpox vaccine adverse events should be reevaluated. During [3 Mar-18 May 2009], nearly 200 clinical specimens (lesion and\nsatellite swabs/crusts, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid [EDTA] blood,\nbone marrow, and serum) were collected and submitted to CDC to\nevaluate disease progression and guide therapeutic interventions. \n\nThe extraordinary amounts of VIGIV used to treat this single case of\nPV underscore the need to reevaluate the adequacy of the national\nstockpiled supply of this or other medical countermeasures (treatment\nor prophylactic). The use of 2 antiviral agents with different\nmechanisms of action (see note 1) was enabled by the research and\ndevelopment of medical countermeasures for smallpox preparedness\nactivities, as well as the use of the emergency IND process. The lesion size remained unchanged, but the\ncentral crust of the vaccination site sloughed off, followed by most\nof the outer 'ring' flattening, leaving a shallow ulcer with\nhealthy-appearing granulation tissue. Before\ninitial chemotherapy, the vaccination site pustule had a central\ncrust and measured approximately 1 cm [0.4 in] in diameter with\nminimal surrounding erythema. This report summarizes the patient's\nprotracted clinical course and the military and civilian interagency\ngovernmental, academic, and industry public health contributions to\nhis complex medical management. These lesions became vesicular in nature, and on [26 Mar\n2009], after a 2nd E-IND was issued, CMX001 (Chimerix, Inc., Research\nTriangle Park, North Carolina), a lipid conjugate of cidofovir, was\nadministered.\n\n Clinical and laboratory\ninvestigation confirmed that the vaccinee met the Brighton\nCollaboration and CDC adverse event surveillance guideline case\ndefinition for PV (4,5). The extraordinary\namounts of VIGIV used to treat this single case of PV underscore the\nneed to reevaluate the adequacy of the national stockpiled supply of\nthis or other medical countermeasures (treatment or prophylactic). Twelve days later, the patient visited a local hospital\nwith fever and headache of one day's duration and was admitted for\nworkup of leukopenia after his white blood cell count was found to be\n1400 cells/mm3. On [5 Mar and 6 Mar 2009],\noral and topical ST-246 (SIGA Technologies, Corvallis, Oregon) were\nadministered under an Emergency Investigational New Drug (E-IND)\napplication. After [23 Apr 2009], swabs from satellite lesions or the main\nvaccination site showed significantly reduced or absent levels of\nviral DNA, and no viable virus was detected after [2 Apr 2009].

During the patient's hospital stay from\nthe end of January to the beginning of March [2009], his vaccination\nsite dressing was changed daily. At the time of his vaccination, the patient described in this\nreport did not have any obvious signs or symptoms that would meet any\nexclusion criteria for vaccination. On [2 Mar 2009], a US Navy Hospital\ncontacted the Poxvirus Program at CDC to report a possible case of PV\nin a male military smallpox vaccinee. From [24 Mar 2009] onward, the satellite and main vaccination site\nlesions continued to crust, the scabs separated, and underlying\ntissue epithelialized. From [21 Feb 2009] onward, the patient had remained in contact\nisolation, first for a _Clostridium difficile_ infection and then for\nhis progressive vaccinia infection. \n\nThe text of the original article (available at the source URL above)\nis accompanied by graphic images of the progressive vaccinia lesion\nover a period of 8 weeks. On [30 Jan and\n13 Feb 2009], the patient underwent 2 successive rounds of induction\nchemotherapy with cytarabine, idarubicin, and dexamethasone. CDC's\nclinical evaluation tools for smallpox vaccine adverse reactions are\navailable at <http://emergency.cdc.gov/agent/smallpox/vaccination/clineval>. Viral analysis of the swab by multiple real-time polymerase\nchain reaction (PCR) assays for orthopoxvirus and vaccinia yielded\nevidence of viral DNA; viral culture was positive for orthopoxvirus. During recent vaccination programs\npotential cases of PV were investigated, but none met standard case\ndefinitions (2). No cases of contact\nvaccinia were identified among this patient's health-care workers or\nclose contacts. As of [12 May 2009], the patient had\nno demonstrable IgM response to orthopoxvirus; IgG levels appeared\nfully reliant on VIGIV infusion. \nHealth-care providers should report suspected cases of PV or other\nadverse events to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). On [5 May 2009], contact\nprecautions were discontinued because of the lack of viable virus in\nlesion specimens from the previous 4 weeks. As of [18 May 2009], MILVAX provided 22 and the\nStrategic National Stockpile (SNS) provided 254 vials of VIGIV used\nin treatment of this case. The patient remained stable until the evening of [7 Mar\n2009], when he became septic with _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_, likely\nfrom a perirectal abscess.

Tertiary contact vaccinia in a\nbreastfeeding infant. JAMA 2004; 291: 725-7, 11 Feb 2004\n<http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/abstract/291/6/725>]. Doctors at the\nMadigan Army Medical Center in Tacoma, Washington, have documented the case\nof a breastfed infant who was exposed to vaccinia virus, which is used as\nthe smallpox vaccine.\nThe baby's mother had not been vaccinated against smallpox but her husband,\na soldier, was given the vaccine soon before the baby developed symptoms.\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) already recommends\nthat women who are breastfeeding should not receive the smallpox vaccine,\nbut there are no guidelines against vaccination of other people living in\nthe same household.\nTransfer of the vaccinia virus within a household remains 'extremely rare,'\naccording to Dr Mary P Fairchok, but she said this case demonstrates the\nneed for extra precautions in households where a child is breastfeeding.\nAbout 10 days after the husband was inoculated, his wife developed blisters\non her nipples. Shortly after, a blister was seen on the baby's upper lip.\nTesting showed that vaccinia virus was the cause of the lesions for both\nthe mother and the child.\n'This case showed us that breastfeeding women living with vaccine\nrecipients should be very careful about possible contact,' Fairchok told\nReuters Health. 'They should always wash their hands prior to nursing,\nprobably not do the laundry of the vaccine recipient, and potentially not\nsleep in the same bed or have other intimate contact until after the\nvaccine scab has fallen off,' Fairchok said. If a breastfeeding woman who\nlives with a recently vaccinated person develops painful sores on her\nbreasts, Fairchok said, she should hold off on breastfeeding until seeing a\nhealth care provider to make sure that the sores are not due to infection\nwith the vaccine virus.\nThe Washington physician noted that the infant in the report recovered\nwell, but she could have ended up with scarring or, if the infection had\nspread to her eyes, with vision loss. After being monitored in the hospital\nfor 12 days, the child was discharged.\nVaccinia virus is related to smallpox virus and produces immunity to\nsmallpox. Smallpox vaccination can cause severe side effects, including\nbrain damage and even death, in a small percentage of people, particularly\nchildren and people with weakened immune systems. But even if individuals\nwho are at high risk of side effects are not given the vaccine, there are\nfears that they might be infected by vaccinia virus that is shed by others\nduring the weeks after vaccination. 'The vaccine has been on the whole very\nsafe, with very few accidental household transfers,' Fairchok said, but\ntaking a few precautions may minimize the small risk that a child will\nbecome infected.\nThe parents of the baby who was exposed to vaccinia virus seemed to take\nall the appropriate steps to prevent transmission of the virus. After being\nvaccinated in early May 2003, the baby's father reported following all\nprecautions to prevent the spread of vaccinia virus, including keeping the\nvaccination site covered. However, the wife did do all of the family's\nlaundry, so she could have been exposed through contact with infected\nclothes, towels, or bed linens Based on this case, Fairchok and her\ncolleagues advise that the CDC amend its guidelines to recommend that\nvaccine recipients not share a bed with a breastfeeding mother and that\nthey do their own laundry.

The experimental vaccine protected monkeys against a virus\nrelated to smallpox without causing some of the dangerous side-effects of\nthe older vaccine, the researchers reported in 2 separate studies. This\nmight offer new hope for U.S. health officials who have been trying, with\nonly limited success, to vaccinate hundreds of thousands of health and\nemergency workers in case of a smallpox attack.\n'These findings are important to the search for a replacement vaccine for\npeople with health conditions that would prevent them from using the\ncurrent smallpox vaccine,' Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National\nInstitute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said in a statement. The\ncurrent vaccine, Wyeth's Dryvax, uses a live virus called vaccinia virus\nthat is related to smallpox virus. It protects well against smallpox but\ncan cause severe side-effects and even kill some vulnerable people. The\nvaccine was worth the risk when smallpox was a global threat. But smallpox\nexists now only as a theoretical biological weapon, and researchers are\nseeking a safer vaccine.\nModified vaccinia virus Anakara (MVA) is a much weakened version of the\nvaccinia virus used to a limited degree before smallpox vaccination stopped\nin the late 1970s. Teams of scientists at the NIAID, at the U.S. Army\nMedical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases, and colleagues tested\nMVA in monkeys infected with monkeypox virus. This is the best experimental\nmodel for human smallpox. MVA protected the monkeys and caused very few\nside-effects, they report in this week's issue of the journal Nature [The\nAbstract of this paper is reproduced below. - Mod.CP]. Monkeys that got MVA\nfirst and then Dryvax also had fewer side-effects, they reported. 'Because\nan initial MVA injection may help lessen the side effects experienced from\nDryvax, MVA may serve as an important pre-vaccine for\nlarge-scale vaccination efforts in the event of a bioterror threat\ninvolving smallpox,' Fauci said. This could be important for U.S.\ngovernment officials, who admit the smallpox vaccination effort is stalled.\nFewer than 40 000 health and emergency workers have volunteered for the\nvaccine, although the goal was 500 000. Worries about side-effects and\ncompensation for lost time at work top their list of complaints. Of the 39\n000 workers vaccinated, 48 have experienced side-effects, including 21 with\npotentially dangerous side-effects such as heart inflammation and one with\nthe brain inflammation encephalitis.\n'This study shows that the MVA vaccine holds great promise as an\nalternative to the current vaccine,' the NIAID's Dr. Bernie Moss, who led\nthe study, said in a statement. 'Although MVA may not quite equal Dryvax in\nits effectiveness, it did extraordinarily well, with all of the monkeys who\nwere vaccinated with MVA surviving a potentially lethal monkeypox infection\nand, aside from a few minor lesions, showing no clinical signs of disease.'\nIn addition, people with damaged immune systems, such a cancer patients,\nthose with the AIDS virus, or those being treated for autoimmune disease\ncannot receive Dryvax because of their risk of serious side-effects.\nThe same team tested MVA on immune-compromised mice. Writing in the\nProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, they said the nice\nremained healthy even when given 1000 times the usual MVA dose.\n[Byline: Maggie Fox]\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[The following is the Abstract of the paper referred to above, which is\npublished the 11 Mar 2004 issue of Nature (Nature, 428, 182-185, 2004.\n<http://info.nature.com/cgi-bin24/DM/y/eOH60Bfvsv0Ch0JiB0AR>).\nTitle: Immunogenicity of a highly attenuated MVA smallpox vaccine and\nprotection against monkeypox\nAuthors: Patricia L.

'I take that as\nproof that our screening succeeded marvelously,' said Colonel John D\nGrabenstein of the United States Army surgeon general's office, who was in\ncharge of the military's inoculation.\nAlthough 8 people had heart attacks after immunizations and 3 died, it is\nunclear whether the deaths were coincidental, said officials at a\nconference in Atlanta, GA, today on immunization policy. The conference was\nconvened by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The heart\nattack victims were middle aged, and several had clogged arteries,\ndiabetes, or other risk factors like smoking. There were no deaths from\nencephalitis, eczema vaccinatum, progressive vaccinia, or the other side\neffects predicted last year based on studies from smallpox vaccination\ndrives in the 1960s.\nThe military has inoculated 454 856 personnel, nearly 90 per cent of them\nbefore the invasion of Iraq, and is now vaccinating about 1000 a week,\nwhich Colonel Grabenstein called 'maintenance.' State health departments\nhave inoculated only 37 608 civilian emergency health workers and are\nadding about 100 more each week.\nPresident Bush announced last December [2002] that the country would\nvaccinate up to 500 000 civilian health workers as a first line of defense\nagainst a terrorist smallpox attack. White House officials said there was\nevidence that President Saddam Hussein of Iraq either planned to use\nsmallpox as a weapon or could have given it to terrorists. But the program\ngot off to a slow start and Dr Raymond A Strikas, director of smallpox\npreparedness in the centers' immunization division, said volunteers dropped\noff sharply after late March 2003. Dr Strikas cited several reasons:\n*With a quick victory in Iraq, Americans felt the threat had faded.\n*The heart attacks and cases of inflamed heart muscle led the centers on 25\nMar 2003 to ban immunization for anyone with heart disease.\n*Nurses and others resisted immunization until a law to compensate them if\nthey were hurt was passed; it was not signed until 30 Apr 2003.\n*SARS and monkeypox competed for state health resources and public attention.\n'What we are in now is what we call the natural pause between Stage 1 and\nStage 2,' Dr Strikas said, with Stage 2 being the 500 000 goal. [Stage 2]\nwould have extended vaccination to the general public, he said, 'but\nthere's been relatively little clamoring for that.' Asked if the centers\nwere disappointed that so few had volunteered, he said: 'We accept where we\nare, given the circumstances. We can make this work.'\nThe smallpox vaccine, vaccinia, is the most dangerous vaccine, and health\nexperts predicted it would cause serious adverse reactions in one in 19 000\nto one in 71 000 people and would kill one or 2 in a million. But they\npredicted brain inflammations or the uncontrolled spread of vaccinia pox,\nnot heart attacks. The government ordered large supplies of vaccinia immune\nglobulin, an antidote for bad reactions. It was needed only 3 times,\ninstead of the roughly 50 times that the 1960s studies would have predicted.\nAbout 125 women who were pregnant or became pregnant were inadvertently\nvaccinated, despite screening, Colonel Grabenstein said. Thus far, there\nhas been no vaccinia in fetuses, and miscarriage rates have been normal,\nthough they are still being followed. In the past, there were reports of\nmyocarditis and pericarditis (inflammation of the heart and the sac\nsurrounding it) from Australia and Finland, but they used more virulent\nvaccinia strains, doctors said. Heart inflammations were not identified in\nthe 1963 and 1968 American studies that experts consulted last year when\nplanning the immunization drive, said Dr Juliette Morgan of the National\nImmunization Program at the centers. Vaccination did seem to increase the\nrisk of myocarditis in the military vaccines, Dr Morgan and Colonel\nGrabenstein said. Of the 18 cases that have been most studied among 53\npossible ones, all were young healthy men who developed chest pains and\nabnormal enzyme levels; all seem to have recovered. That was 3.6 times the\nnumber that might have been expected to develop myocarditis [without\nvaccination, in that number of people].\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>", "summary": "A ProMED-mail post\n<http://www.promedmail.org>\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\n<http://www.isid.org>\n \nGovernment officials said today [18 Jun 2003] that both the civilian and\nmilitary smallpox vaccination programs had virtually come to a halt, the\nmilitary program because it has vaccinated everyone it can and the civilian\nprogram because few people volunteered for it.

This report updates information on vaccine-associated adverse events\namong civilians vaccinated since the beginning of the program and among\ncontacts of vaccinees, received by CDC from the Vaccine Adverse Event\nReporting System (VAERS) as of 20 Jun 2003.\n2 cases of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) were diagnosed 3 months after\nvaccination. For the potential relation between smallpox vaccine and DCM to\nbe assessed, identification of additional cases of DCM among vaccinees will\nbe essential. Physicians who treat smallpox vaccine recipients are\nencouraged to evaluate and report patients with symptoms compatible with\nDCM, including those that occur several months after vaccination.\nIn this vaccination program, CDC, the Food and Drug Administration, and\nstate health departments are conducting surveillance for vaccine-associated\nadverse events among civilian vaccinees (1). As part of the vaccination\nprogram, civilian vaccinees receive routine follow-up, and persons\nreporting adverse events after vaccination receive follow-up as needed. The\nU.S. Department of Defense is conducting surveillance for\nvaccine-associated adverse events among military vaccinees and providing\nfollow-up care to those persons with reported adverse events.\nAdverse events that have been associated with smallpox vaccination are\nclassified on the basis of evidence supporting the reported diagnoses.\nCases verified by virologic testing (or in some instances by other\ndiagnostic testing) are classified as confirmed (Table 1). Cases are\nclassified as probable if possible alternative etiologies are investigated\nand excluded, and supportive information for the diagnosis is found. Cases\nare classified as suspected if they have clinical features compatible with\nthe diagnosis, but either further investigation is required or\ninvestigation of the case did not provide supporting evidence for the\ndiagnosis. All reports of events that follow vaccination (i.e., events\nassociated temporally) are accepted; however, reported adverse events are\nnot necessarily associated causally with vaccination, and some or all of\nthese events might be coincidental. This report includes cases reported as\nof 20 Jun 2003 that either are under investigation or have a reported final\ndiagnosis. Because discussions of final case definitions are ongoing,\nnumbers and classifications of adverse events might change and will be\nupdated regularly in MMWR.\nAs of 20 Jun 2003, a total of 21 cases of myo/pericarditis were reported\namong civilians. 4 of these were new suspected cases reported during 10 May\n2003-20 Jun 2003, including 2 cases of pericarditis and 2 cases of\nmyocarditis (Table 1). In addition, 8 cases of ischemic heart disease have\nbeen reported since the beginning of the civilian vaccination program,\nincluding 5 cases of myocardial infarction (MI) and 3 cases of angina.\nDuring 10 May 2003-20 Jun 2003, one case of suspected generalized vaccinia\nwas reported; no cases of eczema vaccinatum, erythema multiforme major,\nfetal vaccinia, or progressive vaccinia were reported [see Table 1 at above\nprovided weblink]. In addition, 11 other serious adverse events were\nreported, including 2 cases of cardiomyopathy identified 3 months after\nsmallpox vaccination in persons with no previous history of cardiomyopathy,\ncoronary artery disease (CAD), or congestive heart failure. As of 9 Jul\n2003, these cases were under investigation. 9 other serious events were\nreported, including 3 cases of chest pain, one case of gastro-esophageal\nreflux disease, one case of cholecystitis, one case of sudden death caused\nby atherosclerotic CAD 69 days postvaccination. 3 neurologic cases were\nreported, including a central nervous system tumor diagnosed 28 days\npostvaccination, a headache evaluated for encephalitis, and a cerebral\nvascular accident. An additional 111 other nonserious events also were\nreported [see Table 2 at above provided weblink]. Among the 610 vaccinees\nwith reported other nonserious adverse events during 24 Jan 2003--20 Jun\n2003, the most common signs and symptoms were fever (n = 121), rash (n =\n114), headache (n = 103), pain (n = 95), and fatigue (n = 85) [see Table 2\nat above provided weblink]. All of these commonly reported events are\nconsistent with mild expected reactions following receipt of smallpox\nvaccine. Some vaccinees reported multiple signs and symptoms.\nDuring 10 May 2003-20 Jun 2003, no vaccinia immune globulin was released\nfor civilian vaccinees in the pre-event vaccination program, excluding\npersons involved in investigational new drug studies. No cases of vaccine\ntransmission from civilian vaccinees to their contacts have been reported\nduring the vaccination program [see Table 3 at above provided weblink]. A\ntotal of 14 cases of transmission from military personnel to civilian\ncontacts have been reported since the program began.\nCase Reports\nCase 1. On 25 Feb 2003, a woman aged 53 years with a history of untreated\nborderline hypertension and obesity was revaccinated; 7 days later, she had\nfatigue. On 18 Mar 2003, she continued to have fatigue and dyspnea, and she\nhad symptoms of an upper respiratory infection and sinusitis for which she\nwas prescribed antibiotics. On 16 Apr 2003, she saw her physician for an\nunrelated problem and was noted to have elevated blood pressure (150/100\nmm/Hg). She was started on hydrochlorthiazide; her fatigue continued, and\nshe had increasing exertional dyspnea. Other medications included\npostmenopausal hormone replacement therapy and antihistamines for seasonal\nallergies. She had no history of ischemic or valvular heart disease,\nautoimmune or metabolic disorders, excessive alcohol consumption, or\nexposure to other known cardiotoxic agents.\nOn 21 May 2003, she had a routine scheduled physical examination performed\nby her regular physician. On cardiac examination, a murmur not detected\npreviously was noted. An electrocardiogram (EKG) showed a left bundle\nbranch block (LBBB), which was reported to be a new finding. On 28 May\n2003, an echocardiogram showed normal left ventricular (LV) wall thickness,\nbut mild dilatation with diffuse hypokinesis, moderate systolic function\nimpairment, an ejection fraction (EF) of 35 percent (normal: greater than\n50 percent), and mild mitral regurgitation.\nOn 30 May2003, she reported to the emergency department with nonradiating,\nburning chest pain without dizziness, dyspnea, or palpitations. She was\nevaluated and had a cardiac catheterization, which showed no significant\nCAD but moderate global hypokinesis and EF of 35 percent. The findings were\nindicative of a nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy. She began treatment\nwith ramipril and metoprolol and has continued working.\nCase 2. On 24 Feb 2003, a woman aged 55 years with a history of obesity and\nmoderately well-controlled hypertension, diabetes mellitus (DM), and\nhyperlipidemia was revaccinated. 9 days after vaccination, she had\nmyalgias, arthralgias, and a temperature of 100 F (37.8 C) that resolved\nwithin 4 days; she reported no chest pain, dyspnea, or palpitations. On 24\nMar 2003, during a routine medical appointment, she reported continuing\nfatigue but no other symptoms. She had a family history of premature CAD\nbut no history of angina, MI, congestive heart failure, autoimmune disease,\nexcessive alcohol consumption, exposure to cardiotoxins, or metabolic\ndisorders other than DM. Her medications included lisinopril,\nhydrochlorthiazide, atorvastatin, feofibrate, and metformin.\nOn 17 May 2003, she had 2 brief episodes of palpitations, which did not\nrecur. On 3 Jun 2003, she saw her physician for a routine appointment and\ncomplained of periodic fatigue since receiving her smallpox vaccination. On\nexamination, she was noted to have a cardiac murmur not detected\npreviously. On 11 Jun 2003, an EKG showed an LBBB that was not present on\nher most recent previous EKG in 1996. An echocardiogram showed moderate LV\ndilatation with spherical loss of architecture, moderate-to-severe\nsymmetrical hypokinesis of all regional wall areas, severe depression of\nsystolic function, and EF of 25-30 percent. On June 24, an adenosine\nsestamibi stress test showed no evidence of ischemia, moderate LV\nenlargement, and EF of 23 percent, consistent with a nonischemic DCM. Her\nbaseline medications were adjusted, and she has continued working.\nReported by: Smallpox vaccine adverse events coordinators. National\nImmunization Program, CDC.\nMMWR Editorial Note:\nCardiac adverse events including myocarditis and pericarditis have been\nreported following smallpox vaccination (2). Evidence suggests that\nmyocarditis and pericarditis might be associated causally with vaccination\n(3). The 2 cases of DCM described in this report represent the first known\ntemporal, although not necessarily causal, association of smallpox\nvaccination and DCM. However, whether vaccine caused these illnesses or\nwhether the 2 cases were coincidental and would have occurred anyway is\nunclear.\nDCM is a syndrome characterized by cardiac enlargement and impaired\nsystolic function of the left and/or right ventricle. Patients can have\nsymptoms of congestive heart failure, syncope, arrhythmias, and systemic\nand pulmonary emboli; greater than 40 causes of DCM have been described,\nincluding alcohol, toxins, infections, cytotoxic chemotherapy, and\nmetabolic abnormalities (4--6). However, in approximately half of all\ncases, the cause is not identified; these are called idiopathic DCM (5,6).\nIn a study of 673 patients admitted to a hospital with DCM, 81 (12 percent)\nhad evidence of myocarditis on endomyocardial biopsy (5). Infectious causes\nof myocarditis include enteroviruses, adenoviruses, influenza, human\nimmunodeficiency virus (HIV), and hepatitis C (4,6,7). Onset of\nviral-associated DCM can occur within 2-3 months of infection; however,\nmany patients do not report previous viral symptoms or symptoms of\nmyocarditis, and the time of onset of symptomatic DCM can be subtle and\ngradual. For these reasons, determining the timing of infection and\nattributing causality in many patients with viral-associated DCM is\ndifficult. The mechanisms responsible for virus-related myocardial damage\nare not well understood; however, an autoimmune response is likely (6,7).\nPatients with DCM generally have echocardiograms that demonstrate dilated\nLV end-diastolic diameter and global or regional wall dyskinesia with poor\nLV contractile function (ejection fraction of less than 45 percent), often\nwith some compensatory increased wall thickness. Viral studies might\nindicate infection (6). The use of endomyocardial biopsy in patients with\nprobable DCM is not recommended routinely because less than 5 percent of\npatients have a condition for which a specific therapy is indicated (4--8).\nIn one study, 1/4 of patients reporting to a major medical center with\nsymptomatic DCM died within a year, and half died within 5 years (6). Among\nthose with myocarditis, survival rates are somewhat better (75 percent\nsurvival at 5 years and approximately 55 percent at 10 years) (9).\nSmallpox vaccination has not been associated previously with DCM. Because\nsmallpox vaccination appears to be associated causally with myocarditis,\nwhich can cause DCM, further evaluation is warranted. DCM in either of the\n2 cases described in this report could have been associated with other\netiologies (e.g., preceding or interceding illnesses). As in other cases of\nDCM, attributing causality in these cases is difficult. The expected rate\nof DCM in this population is being calculated to determine whether the\nobserved rate of DCM among civilian vaccinees (2 per 38 000) is higher than\nexpected. Surveillance and follow-up are ongoing to identify additional\ncases of DCM among vaccinees. Guidelines for evaluation of possible DCM\ncases following vaccination are being developed. Clinicians who treat\nsmallpox vaccinees should report patients with clinical presentations\ncompatible with DCM to their state health department and to VAERS (1).\nReferences\n1. CDC.

In 2 settings, 0.5\npercent and 3.0 percent of vaccine recipients needed short-term sick leave.\nMost adverse events occurred at rates below historical rates. One case of\nencephalitis and 37 cases of acute myopericarditis developed after\nvaccination; all cases recovered.

A ProMED-mail post\n<http://www.promedmail.org>\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\n<http://www.isid.org>\n Among the 610 vaccinees\nwith reported other nonserious adverse events during 24 Jan 2003--20 Jun\n2003, the most common signs and symptoms were fever (n = 121), rash (n =\n114), headache (n = 103), pain (n = 95), and fatigue (n = 85) [see Table 2\nat above provided weblink]. These numbers should be kept in mind\nwhen evaluating/interpreting the current reports on adverse events, as\nthese are relatively small numbers, especially when compared with\npreviously studied rates of adverse events following smallpox vaccination,\nwhere the rates are cited as per 1 000 000 doses administered. On 28 May\n2003, an echocardiogram showed normal left ventricular (LV) wall thickness,\nbut mild dilatation with diffuse hypokinesis, moderate systolic function\nimpairment, an ejection fraction (EF) of 35 percent (normal: greater than\n50 percent), and mild mitral regurgitation. Onset of\nviral-associated DCM can occur within 2-3 months of infection; however,\nmany patients do not report previous viral symptoms or symptoms of\nmyocarditis, and the time of onset of symptomatic DCM can be subtle and\ngradual. Cases\nare classified as suspected if they have clinical features compatible with\nthe diagnosis, but either further investigation is required or\ninvestigation of the case did not provide supporting evidence for the\ndiagnosis. Patients can have\nsymptoms of congestive heart failure, syncope, arrhythmias, and systemic\nand pulmonary emboli; greater than 40 causes of DCM have been described,\nincluding alcohol, toxins, infections, cytotoxic chemotherapy, and\nmetabolic abnormalities (4--6). All reports of events that follow vaccination (i.e., events\nassociated temporally) are accepted; however, reported adverse events are\nnot necessarily associated causally with vaccination, and some or all of\nthese events might be coincidental. In addition, 11 other serious adverse events were\nreported, including 2 cases of cardiomyopathy identified 3 months after\nsmallpox vaccination in persons with no previous history of cardiomyopathy,\ncoronary artery disease (CAD), or congestive heart failure. In addition, 8 cases of ischemic heart disease have\nbeen reported since the beginning of the civilian vaccination program,\nincluding 5 cases of myocardial infarction (MI) and 3 cases of angina.\n During 10 May 2003-20 Jun 2003, one case of suspected generalized vaccinia\nwas reported; no cases of eczema vaccinatum, erythema multiforme major,\nfetal vaccinia, or progressive vaccinia were reported [see Table 1 at above\nprovided weblink].

During 24 Jan 2003-- 20 Jun 2003, smallpox vaccine was administered to 37\n802 civilian health-care and public health workers in 55 jurisdictions to\nprepare the United States for a possible terrorist attack using smallpox\nvirus. This report updates information on vaccine-associated adverse events\namong civilians vaccinated since the beginning of the program and among\ncontacts of vaccinees, received by CDC from the Vaccine Adverse Event\n 9 other serious events were\nreported, including 3 cases of chest pain, one case of gastro-esophageal\nreflux disease, one case of cholecystitis, one case of sudden death caused\nby atherosclerotic CAD 69 days postvaccination. Among 19 461 worker-months of clinical\ncontact, there were no cases of transmission of vaccinia from worker to\npatient, no cases of eczema vaccinatum or progressive vaccinia, and no\nattributed deaths. 3 neurologic cases were\nreported, including a central nervous system tumor diagnosed 28 days\npostvaccination, a headache evaluated for encephalitis, and a cerebral\nvascular accident. It should be noted that to\ndate there have been approximately 38 000 smallpox vaccinations\nadministered to the civilian population and another approximately 450 000\ndoses administered to the military. The expected rate\nof DCM in this population is being calculated to determine whether the\nobserved rate of DCM among civilian vaccinees (2 per 38 000) is higher than\nexpected. Patients with DCM generally have echocardiograms that demonstrate dilated\nLV end-diastolic diameter and global or regional wall dyskinesia with poor\nLV contractile function (ejection fraction of less than 45 percent), often\nwith some compensatory increased wall thickness. An echocardiogram showed moderate LV\ndilatation with spherical loss of architecture, moderate-to-severe\nsymmetrical hypokinesis of all regional wall areas, severe depression of\nsystolic function, and EF of 25-30 percent. She had a family history of premature CAD\nbut no history of angina, MI, congestive heart failure, autoimmune disease,\nexcessive alcohol consumption, exposure to cardiotoxins, or metabolic\ndisorders other than DM. 4 of these were new suspected cases reported during 10 May\n2003-20 Jun 2003, including 2 cases of pericarditis and 2 cases of\nmyocarditis (Table 1). As part of the vaccination\nprogram, civilian vaccinees receive routine follow-up, and persons\nreporting adverse events after vaccination receive follow-up as needed. During 10 May 2003-20 Jun 2003, no vaccinia immune globulin was released\nfor civilian vaccinees in the pre-event vaccination program, excluding\npersons involved in investigational new drug studies. No cases of vaccine\ntransmission from civilian vaccinees to their contacts have been reported\nduring the vaccination program [see Table 3 at above provided weblink]. In this vaccination program, CDC, the Food and Drug Administration, and\nstate health departments are conducting surveillance for vaccine-associated\nadverse events among civilian vaccinees (1). Adverse events that have been associated with smallpox vaccination are\nclassified on the basis of evidence supporting the reported diagnoses.\n This report includes cases reported as\nof 20 Jun 2003 that either are under investigation or have a reported final\ndiagnosis. The 2 cases of DCM described in this report represent the first known\ntemporal, although not necessarily causal, association of smallpox\nvaccination and DCM. Physicians who treat smallpox vaccine recipients are\nencouraged to evaluate and report patients with symptoms compatible with\nDCM, including those that occur several months after vaccination. All of these commonly reported events are\nconsistent with mild expected reactions following receipt of smallpox\nvaccine. \n2 cases of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) were diagnosed 3 months after\nvaccination. One case of\nencephalitis and 37 cases of acute myopericarditis developed after\nvaccination; all cases recovered. A\ntotal of 14 cases of transmission from military personnel to civilian\ncontacts have been reported since the program began. 9 days after vaccination, she had\nmyalgias, arthralgias, and a temperature of 100 F (37.8 C) that resolved\nwithin 4 days; she reported no chest pain, dyspnea, or palpitations. For the potential relation between smallpox vaccine and DCM to\nbe assessed, identification of additional cases of DCM among vaccinees will\nbe essential. On 24\nMar 2003, during a routine medical appointment, she reported continuing\nfatigue but no other symptoms. Among\nthose with myocarditis, survival rates are somewhat better (75 percent\nsurvival at 5 years and approximately 55 percent at 10 years) (9). Clinicians who treat\nsmallpox vaccinees should report patients with clinical presentations\ncompatible with DCM to their state health department and to VAERS (1). Because\nsmallpox vaccination appears to be associated causally with myocarditis,\nwhich can cause DCM, further evaluation is warranted. DCM in either of the\n2 cases described in this report could have been associated with other\netiologies (e.g., preceding or interceding illnesses). Evidence suggests that\nmyocarditis and pericarditis might be associated causally with vaccination\n(3). On 25 Feb 2003, a woman aged 53 years with a history of untreated\nborderline hypertension and obesity was revaccinated; 7 days later, she had\nfatigue. However, whether vaccine caused these illnesses or\nwhether the 2 cases were coincidental and would have occurred anyway is\nunclear. Because discussions of final case definitions are ongoing,\nnumbers and classifications of adverse events might change and will be\nupdated regularly in MMWR. The use of endomyocardial biopsy in patients with\nprobable DCM is not recommended routinely because less than 5 percent of\npatients have a condition for which a specific therapy is indicated (4--8). On 24 Feb 2003, a woman aged 55 years with a history of obesity and\nmoderately well-controlled hypertension, diabetes mellitus (DM), and\nhyperlipidemia was revaccinated.", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "hepatitis c", "smallpox", "monkeypox"], "syndromes": ["encephalitis"], "event_date": ["2003-05-17 00:00:00", "2003-03-18 00:00:00", "2003-05-28 00:00:00", "1996-03-25 00:00:00", "1972-03-25 00:00:00", "2021-04-06 00:00:00", "2021-05-10 00:00:00", "2003-06-11 00:00:00", "2003-02-25 00:00:00", "2003-02-24 00:00:00", "1994-03-25 00:00:00", "1985-03-25 00:00:00", "2003-05-21 00:00:00", "2021-06-24 00:00:00", "2003-06-20 00:00:00", "2003-01-24 00:00:00", "1981-03-25 00:00:00", "2003-03-25 00:00:00", "2003-06-03 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "the United States", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "United States", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "EF", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "United \n States", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Atwood JE", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Deckers JW", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "US", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "2203577", "headline": "PRO/EDR> Smallpox vaccination adverse events - USA (10)", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=2203577", "date": "2003-04-04 23:50:00", "main_text": "SMALLPOX VACCINATION, ADVERSE EVENTS - USA (10)\n***************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\n<http://www.promedmail.org>\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\n<http://www.isid.org>\nDate: 3 Apr 2003\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: MMWR 4 Apr 2003 / 52(13);278-282 [edited]\n<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5213a4.htm>\n\nUpdate: Adverse Events Following Smallpox Vaccination --- United\nStates, 2003\n-------------------\nDuring 24 Jan 2003 -- 28 Mar 2003, smallpox vaccine was\nadministered to 29 584 civilian health-care and public health workers\nin 54 jurisdictions as part of an effort to prepare the United States\nfor a terrorist attack using smallpox virus. This report summarizes\ndata on 10 cases of cardiac adverse events reported among civilian\nvaccinees since the beginning of the smallpox vaccination program,\nincluding 3 new cardiac adverse events reported to CDC from the\nVaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) during 24-30\nMar 2003.\n14 cases of myocarditis and one fatal myocardial infarction have\nbeen reported among military personnel.\nThis report summarizes data on the 3 new cases of cardiac adverse\nevents, updates data on 7 previously reported cases among civilian\nvaccinees (Table 1 from reference 1 below), summarizes selected\ncases of cardiac adverse events among military vaccinees, and\nupdates information on all adverse events reported in the civilian\nvaccination program as of 30 Mar 2003.\n<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5213a4.htm>\nCDC, the Food and Drug Administration, and state health\ndepartments are conducting surveillance for vaccine-associated\nadverse events among civilian vaccinees; the Department of\nDefense (DoD) is conducting surveillance for vaccine-associated\nadverse events among military vaccinees. In the first stage of the\ncivilian program, active surveillance is being conducted for any\nadverse events after vaccination that require medical care.\nIn the military vaccination program, military personnel receive\nmedical care primarily in a network of linked clinics that report\nadverse events to medical headquarters and VAERS.\nCivilian Case Reports\n-------------------\nThe 3 new cases of cardiac adverse events among civilians during\n24-30 Mar 2003 include 2 cases of myopericarditis and one case of\nmyocardial infarction (Table 1):\n<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5213a4.htm>\nCase 1. A man aged 56 years with a history of mild hypertension\nand hypertriglyceridemia was revaccinated on 4 Mar 2003. On 16\nMar 2003, he had onset of influenza-like illness (ILI), chest\ndiscomfort while lying flat, and pleuritic pain during inspiration; a\nclinical examination revealed tachycardia. During the next 7 days,\nhe had chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, fever, chills, pallor, and left\nknee pain. All symptoms and signs had resolved 17 days after\nvaccination. On day 23 post vaccination, an electrocardiogram\n(ECG) indicated low R waves in the anterior leads and borderline\nfirst-degree AV block (PR interval: 0.21 msec). Echocardiogram\nrevealed widening of the pericardial space with minimal fluid\ncollection, a normal ejection fraction, and normal ventricular wall\nfunction. Chest radiograph demonstrated left basilar atelectasis. The\npatient had normal troponin I, creatine kinase myocardial band (CK-\nMB), C-reactive protein levels, and a normal erythrocyte\nsedimentation rate. These findings are consistent with mild\nmyopericarditis. The patient recovered; a follow-up exercise cardiac\nperfusion scan was normal.\nCase 2. A woman aged 32 years with no history of cardiac disease\nor major risk factors for coronary artery disease was vaccinated for\nthe first time on 31 Jan 2003. On 16 Feb 2003, she had fever,\ncrushing-type chest pain, and shortness of breath, which prompted\na visit to the emergency department (ED). An ECG indicated\nnonspecific ST-T wave changes; cardiac enzymes were normal. A\nrepeat ECG several days later was normal. After 5--6 days, her\nsymptoms resolved completely, and she was able to resume normal\nactivities. 6 weeks after vaccination, a nuclear stress test was\nnormal. Her clinical course and ECG findings were consistent with\nmyopericarditis.\nCase 3. An active man aged 64 years with a history of dyspnea on\nexertion and productive cough for 3 months and 8 previous smallpox\nvaccinations was revaccinated on 21 Mar 2003. On 23 Mar 2003, he\nsought medical care for chest 'fullness' and dizziness. Blood tests\nindicated elevated troponin I and CK-MB levels. ECG demonstrated\ninferior ST segment depression and T wave inversion.\nEchocardiography indicated moderate inferior wall hypokenesis with\na normal ejection fraction. Coronary arteriography showed 3-vessel\natherosclerotic disease with development of some collateral\ncirculation. The patient underwent cardiac catheterization with\nballoon atherotomy, and 2 coronary artery stents were placed. The\nclinical course and laboratory findings are consistent with acute\nmyocardial infarction in a patient with chronic coronary artery\ndisease. He returned to work on 31 Mar 2003.\nUpdate on Previous Civilian Cardiac Adverse Events\n------------------------------------------------\nOn 23 Mar 2003, a woman aged 55 years with a history of\nhypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and smoking died 5 days after\nsmallpox vaccination (1). Autopsy showed extensive atherosclerotic\ndisease, with right coronary artery thrombosis and lateral wall\nsoftening. Preliminary testing, including real-time polymerase chain\nreaction (PCR) and immunohistochemistry, showed evidence of\nvaccinia virus only at the vaccination site; limited analyses of other\ntissues, including heart and other visceral tissue, were negative for\nvaccinia virus by real-time PCR and immunohistochemistry.\nOn 26 Mar 2003, a woman aged 57 years with a history of smoking,\nhypertension, transient ischemic attack, and carotid endarterectomy\ndied 22 days after smallpox vaccination (1). Autopsy showed\nextensive atherosclerosis of the coronary arteries and a large\nhealing infarct involving the posterior wall of the left ventricle and\nintraventricular septum. Histopathologic evaluation revealed no\nevidence of myocarditis or pericarditis. Preliminary analysis using\nreal-time PCR tests showed evidence of vaccinia virus DNA at the\nvaccination site but not in affected myocardium or other viscera.\nMilitary Case Reports\n-------------------\nDuring 25-31 Mar 2003, 4 cases of myocarditis and/or pericarditis\nwere identified, totaling 14 cases among approximately 250 000\npersonnel who received smallpox vaccination for the first time. No\ncases of myocarditis and/or pericarditis were identified among\napproximately 115 000 service members who were revaccinated.\nAmong the approximately 365 000 vaccinated military service\nmembers, one death has been reported.\nThe 14 patients with myocarditis and/or pericarditis ranged in age\nfrom 21 to 33 years. Severity ranged from mild (no ECG or\nechocardiogram changes) to severe (congestive heart failure), with\nonset 7 to 19 days after vaccination. All military patients were\nhospitalized, and all survived. As of 2 Apr 2003, the patient with\nthe most severe case has been hospitalized for 6 days. All other\nhospitalized patients have been discharged; they have either\nreturned to duty or are on short-term convalescent leave. Following\nare 2 cases that represent the spectrum of clinical presentations of\nmyopericarditis and a report of a fatal case of myocardial infarction.\nCase 1. On 18 Mar 2003, a man aged 22 years sought medical care\nat a military health clinic for chest pain 12 days after primary\nsmallpox vaccination. He was treated with nonsteroidal anti-\ninflammatory agents for presumed costochondritis. When laboratory\ntests revealed elevated cardiac enzymes levels, he was referred to a\nuniversity hospital emergency department (ED) for further\nevaluation. Cardiac enzymes levels remained elevated, but an ECG,\nechocardiogram, and cardiac stress test were normal.\nMyopericarditis was diagnosed, and he was released that day in\ngood condition.\nCase 2. A man aged 29 years had ILI symptoms during the same\nweek of primary smallpox vaccination. At the time of smallpox\nvaccination on 8 Mar 2003, he also received 5 other inactivated\nvaccines; 19 days after vaccination, he sought treatment at an ED\nfor dyspnea while lying flat. On 28 Mar 2003, he was hospitalized\nand had myopericarditis diagnosed based on ECG findings and\nelevated troponin I and CK-MB. The next day, he had pulmonary\nedema with a pulmonary artery wedge pressure of 38 mmHg that\nresponded well to several doses of intravenous diuretics. Serial\nechocardiograms showed ejection fractions as low as 25 percent\nthat subsequently improved to 45 percent (normal: >55 percent).\nEndomyocardial biopsy revealed active myocarditis with a mixed\ninfiltrate of lymphocytes and eosinophils and evidence of\neosinophilic degranulation in proximity to myocyte necrosis. PCR\ntesting of myocardial tissue was negative for vaccinia virus DNA,\nvaricella-zoster virus DNA, and herpes simplex virus DNA;\nreverse transcriptase PCR was negative for enterovirus RNA. As of\n2 Apr 2003, he remained hospitalized but was stable and improving.\nCase 3. On 25 Mar 2003, an Army National Guardsman aged 55\nyears with a history of smoking and treatment for hyperlipidemia\nwas found unresponsive in a vehicle 5 days after receiving smallpox\nvaccine and 2 other inactivated vaccines. He was resuscitated but\ndied the next day. Autopsy showed acute thrombosis of the right\nanterior descending coronary artery, 3-vessel coronary artery\ndisease with 75-80 percent occlusion, left ventricular hypertrophy,\nand cardiomegaly. Histopathology of left ventricular myocardium\nrevealed no evidence of myocarditis or pericarditis. Virologic testing\nof myocardium is pending. The cause of death was acute\nmyocardial infarction.\nUpdate on Adverse Events in the Civilian Vaccination Program\n-----------------------------------------\nAs of 30 Mar 2003, no cases of several potentially life-threatening\nadverse events associated historically with smallpox vaccination\n(i.e., progressive vaccinia, eczema vaccinatum, post-vaccinial\nencephalitis, or encephalomyelitis) have been reported among\ncivilians. In addition, no cases of vaccinia transmission from\ncivilians have been reported. This includes no transmission from 18\n344 members of health-care teams, 6655 of whom have been\nfollowed for longer than 1 month.\nDuring 11-30 Mar 2003, 6 cases of generalized vaccinia, 14 cases\nof inadvertent inoculation (nonocular), and 4 cases of\nmyopericarditis were reported (Table 2:\n<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5213a4.htm>).\nDuring the same period, 12 other serious adverse events were\nreported. Of these, 4 were myocardial infarctions, and 2 were cases\nof angina (Table 3:\n<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5213a4.htm>).\nThe remaining 6 other new serious adverse events had hospital\ndischarge diagnoses of pancreatic cancer, urinary tract infection,\nherpes zoster virus infection, headache, and facial paralysis with\nparesthesias (Table 3). Among the 192 vaccinees with reported\nother nonserious adverse events during 24 Jan 2003-30 Mar 2003\n(Table 3), the most common signs and symptoms were fever (n =\n42), rash (n = 39), headache (n = 34), and pruritus (n = 32). All of\nthese commonly reported events are consistent with mild expected\nreactions after receipt of smallpox vaccine. Some vaccinees\nreported multiple signs and symptoms. During 11-30 Mar 2003, no\nvaccinia immune globulin was released for civilian vaccinees (Table\n4: <http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5213a4.htm>).\nSurveillance for adverse events during the civilian and military\nsmallpox vaccination programs is ongoing; regular surveillance\nreports will be published in MMWR.\nMMWR Editorial Note:\n--------------------\nNew reports of myopericarditis following smallpox vaccination are\nconsistent with previous reports describing a potential causal\nassociation between vaccination and myopericarditis (1). One new\ncase of myocardial infarction among civilian vaccinees and one\ndeath from myocardial infarction among military vaccinees have\nbeen reported, but any association between smallpox vaccine and\nischemic heart disease remains unclear.\nMyopericarditis is often asymptomatic or mild, but can be severe.\nSymptomatic patients report chest pain, fatigue, fever, palpitations,\nand dyspnea on exertion. The patient with myopericarditis and\ncongestive heart failure reported by DoD illustrates the potential\nseverity of the condition, which can lead to severe cardiac\ndysfunction or dysrhythmia. In addition, rare fatal cases of\nmyocarditis after smallpox vaccination have been reported in Europe\nand Australia (2,3). Evaluation and follow-up guidelines are being\ndeveloped by CDC to assist health-care providers in managing\nvaccinees with cardiac adverse events.\nPreliminary autopsy findings for the 3 patients with myocardial\ninfarction who died showed no evidence of disseminated vaccinia\ninfection or myopericarditis. Although virologic testing of\nmyocardial tissue is pending for one patient and is limited for the\nother 2, these findings suggest the ischemic events in these patients\ndid not result from vaccinia-associated myocarditis. The number of\nreported deaths from cardiac disease among civilians and military\npersonnel is consistent with expected background rates (1).\nHowever, it is not known whether smallpox vaccination could\ncontribute to these events through another mechanism.\nOn the basis of the civilian and military cases, and guidance from\nthe Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (4) and an\nindependent group of cardiology consultants, CDC revised its\nrecommendations for screening and exclusion of potential smallpox\nvaccine recipients. Persons should be excluded from the pre-event\nsmallpox vaccination program if they have had heart disease or any\ntype of ischemic cardiovascular disease diagnosed, with or without\nsymptoms (e.g., previous myocardial infarction, angina, congestive\nheart failure, cardiomyopathy, stroke or transient ischemic attack,\nor other heart conditions under the care of a doctor). Persons also\nshould be excluded if they have 3 or more risk factors:\nhypertension, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, smoking, or an\nimmediate family member who had onset of a heart condition before\nage 50. To date, 5 of the 6 vaccinated civilians with cardiac adverse\nevents indicative of ischemic heart disease met these exclusion\ncriteria.\nReferences\n------------\n1. CDC.

The remaining 6 other new serious adverse events had hospital\ndischarge diagnoses of pancreatic cancer, urinary tract infection,\nherpes zoster virus infection, headache, and facial paralysis with\nparesthesias (Table 3). Autopsy showed acute thrombosis of the right\nanterior descending coronary artery, 3-vessel coronary artery\ndisease with 75-80 percent occlusion, left ventricular hypertrophy,\nand cardiomegaly. The\nclinical course and laboratory findings are consistent with acute\nmyocardial infarction in a patient with chronic coronary artery\ndisease. The patient with myopericarditis and\ncongestive heart failure reported by DoD illustrates the potential\nseverity of the condition, which can lead to severe cardiac\ndysfunction or dysrhythmia. PCR\ntesting of myocardial tissue was negative for vaccinia virus DNA,\nvaricella-zoster virus DNA, and herpes simplex virus DNA;\nreverse transcriptase PCR was negative for enterovirus RNA.

In addition, 10 cases of myopericarditis have been reported among\nmilitary vaccinees. This report summarizes data on the 7 cases reported\namong civilians and provides background information on recent military\nvaccinees. Although a causal association between vaccination and adverse\ncardiac events in the civilian population is unproven, as a precautionary\nmeasure, CDC recommends that persons with physician-diagnosed cardiac\ndisease with or without symptoms (e.g., previous myocardial infarction,\nangina, congestive heart failure, or cardiomyopathy) be excluded from\nvaccination during this smallpox preparedness program.\nCDC, the Food and Drug Administration, and state health departments are\nconducting surveillance for vaccine-associated adverse events among\ncivilian vaccinees; the Department of Defense (DoD) is conducting\nsurveillance for vaccine-associated adverse events among military vaccinees.\nIn the first stage of the civilian program, active surveillance is being\nconducted for any adverse events after vaccination that require medical\ncare. Cardiac adverse events among civilians and myopericarditis cases\namong military vaccinees were reported to CDC from the Vaccine Adverse\nEvent Reporting System (VAERS) as of 23 Mar 2003. 4 of the civilian cases\nwere previously reported in MMWR. Reported adverse events are not\nnecessarily associated causally with vaccination, and some or all of these\nevents might be coincidental.\nThe 7 adverse events of cardiac origin among civilian vaccinees include 3\nmyocardial infarctions, 2 cases of angina, and 2 cases of myopericarditis.\nThe median age of patients was 50 years (range: 43--60 years), and 5 were\nwomen. 2 of the 3 patients who had a myocardial infarction died. 2 had\nprevious illnesses consistent with coronary artery disease (CAD); the other\nhad a history of hypertension, a known risk factor for CAD. Of the two\npatients with angina, one had a history of CAD, and the other had no\nhistory of CAD but at cardiac catheterization was discovered to have a\ntortuous coronary artery. Both patients with myopericarditis had a history\nof hypertension but no history of CAD. The 5 patients with myocardial\ninfarction and angina had illness onset from 4 to 17 days after\nvaccination; the 2 patients with myopericarditis were both aged 45 years\nand had onset of illness at 2 and 17 days after vaccination.\nCase Reports\nCase 1. A woman aged 50 years with a history of hypertension,\nhypercholesterolemia, and smoking was vaccinated on 18 Mar 2003. On 22 Mar\n2003, she had chest tightness, dizziness, nausea, and vomiting;\napproximately 24 hours after onset of these symptoms, she was found\nunresponsive and pronounced dead. A preliminary autopsy report indicated\nthat a myocardial infarction with thrombus of the right coronary artery had\noccurred with extensive underlying atherosclerotic disease.\nCase 2. On 4 Mar 2003, a woman aged 57 years with a history of smoking and\nhypertension reported to an emergency department (ED) and was diagnosed\nwith an exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and\ndehydration 6 days after smallpox vaccination (1). The patient had a\nprevious cardiac catheterization that was complicated by a transient\nischemic attack during the procedure. In the ED, she was treated with\noxygen, antibiotics, and intravenous fluids and was released. On 16 Mar\n2003, the patient was hospitalized again following a sudden cardiopulmonary\narrest at home. Approximately 10--20 minutes elapsed between the time of\nthe arrest and the arrival of emergency medical personnel. The patient was\nadmitted to a cardiac intensive care unit with a diagnosis of myocardial\ninfarction. The patient died on 26 Mar 2003.\nCase 3. A woman aged 54 years with a history of poorly controlled diabetes\nmellitus, hypertension, obesity, untreated hyperlipidemia, and a recent\nhistory of exertional chest pain was vaccinated on 3 Mar 2003. On 12 Mar\n2003, she had onset of chest discomfort and irregular heartbeat. She was\nhospitalized with atrial fibrillation and had electrocardiographic changes\nand elevated cardiac enzymes consistent with subendocardial myocardial\ninfarction. Cardiac catheterization indicated severe CAD. Echocardiography\nshowed no evidence suggestive of myocarditis.\nCase 4. On 14 Mar 2003, a woman aged 43 years with no history of heart\ndisease and no known cardiac risk factors had dizziness and lightheadedness\n2 days after vaccination (1). On 16 Mar 2003, she had chest pain and\ndyspnea. Subsequent cardiac catheterization identified a tortuous coronary\nartery thought to be the cause of her anginal symptoms.\nCase 5. A man aged 60 years with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia,\nexertional chest pain, and a family history of CAD had onset of chest pain\nwhile playing tennis 4 days after smallpox vaccination and reported to an\nED (2). Right coronary artery occlusion was diagnosed, and an angioplasty\nwas performed. He was discharged after a 2-day hospitalization.\nCase 6. A male civilian federal employee aged 45 years, who had a history\nof hypertension and who was vaccinated once as a child, was vaccinated on\n23 Jan 2003. On 9 Feb 2003, he had fever, chills, malaise, and chest pain.\nHe was hospitalized for 1 day and treated with nonsteroidal\nanti-inflammatory drugs and prednisone. Electrocardiogram indicated ST\nsegment changes and global J point elevation. His creatinine phosphokinase\nwas reported as mildly elevated at 223 IU (normal range: 55--170 IU), and\nechocardiography and thallium studies were normal. Myopericarditis was\ndiagnosed. After discharge, the patient was continued on prednisone.\nCase 7. On 14 Mar 2003, a woman aged 45 years who was revaccinated on 26\nFeb 2003 had myocarditis; the patient had a history of hypertension treated\nwith an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (1). Approximately 2\nweeks before vaccination, she had onset of influenza-like illness (ILI)\nwith fever, chills, myalgia, malaise, cough, and pleuritic chest pain and\nmissed 1 week of work. On 28 Feb 2003, she had sharp left shoulder pain\nfollowed by nonexertional chest pain that improved but did not resolve\ncompletely with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. On 3 Mar 2003, she\ncomplained again of dyspnea and exertional chest pain and was hospitalized\nthe next day. On 5 Mar 2003, an echocardiogram demonstrated decreased left\nventricular function, left ventricular wall motion abnormality, and a small\npericardial effusion. Cardiac catheterization found no evidence of coronary\nartery disease. Myocarditis was diagnosed. On 6 Mar 2003, the patient was\ndischarged, and her symptoms improved after treatment with an increased\ndose of ACE inhibitor, addition of a low-dose beta blocker, and NSAIDS. The\nantecedent ILI and chest pain before vaccination suggests a nonvaccinia\ninfectious etiology.\nAs of 23 Mar 2003, a total of 10 cases of myocarditis and/or pericarditis\nhave been identified among approximately 225 000 primary vaccinees in the\nmilitary smallpox vaccination program. All had onset of chest pain 6--12\ndays following vaccination and all had clinical, laboratory,\nelectrocardiographic, and/or echocardiographic evidence of myocardial\nand/or pericardial inflammation. None of the cases was clinically severe,\nand all patients recovered fully and returned to active duty. No cases of\nmyocarditis or pericarditis were detected among approximately 100 000\npersons in the military program who were revaccinated.\nEditorial Note:\nMyocarditis and pericarditis following smallpox vaccination have been\nreported (3,4). The majority of reports were from Europe and Australia,\nwhere a more virulent vaccine strain was used, but myopericarditis is not a\nwell-recognized complication following vaccination with the strain of\nvaccinia being used in the United States (i.e., the New York City Board of\nHealth vaccinia strain, DryVax\u00ae [Wyeth Laboratories Inc., Marietta,\nPennsylvania]). Data from the military smallpox vaccination program are\nconsistent with a causal association between vaccination and\nmyopericarditis, although this association is not proven.\nOther coronary events, including angina and myocardial infarction, have not\nbeen previously associated with smallpox vaccination (5,6). The relation\nbetween smallpox vaccine and the coronary events observed in the civilian\nvaccination program is unclear.\nThe frequency of coronary heart disease in the general population makes it\ndifficult to determine if a serious coronary event following vaccination is\ncoincidental or associated with vaccination. The civilian smallpox\nvaccination program might differ from historical experience because more\nolder patients with underlying heart disease and cardiac risk factors\n(e.g., hypertension and diabetes mellitus) might be receiving vaccinations.\nIn addition, because current diagnostic tests, including cardiac enzymes\nand echocardiography, are more sensitive for diagnosing myocardial\ninfarction than previous methods, more events might be detected than were\npreviously observed.\nCardiac-associated death following smallpox vaccination, although extremely\nrare, has been reported in Europe and Australia and has been thought to be\nassociated with myocarditis (7,8). However, in the United States, a\ndeath-certificate study of vaccinia-associated deaths conducted during\n1959--1966 and 1968 did not identify any deaths associated with cardiac\ncomplications (9).\nBecause of the substantial numbers of persons vaccinated in the civilian\nprogram, a small number of deaths following vaccination are expected to\noccur. Of the 25 645 persons vaccinated in the civilian program, age data\nare available for 14 438. By using the age distribution for these persons,\nusing year 2000 age-specific death rates from all causes (10), and assuming\nthat the age distribution is the same for persons whose age is unknown,\n2--3 deaths are expected to occur within 3 weeks of vaccination among\npersons aged 45--54 years and an additional 2--3 deaths among vaccinees\naged 55--64 years. Among vaccinees aged 45--64 years, 1--2\ncardiac-associated deaths are expected to occur within 3 weeks of vaccination.\nBecause of the reports of myopericarditis and other cardiac adverse events,\nCDC and DoD are issuing a supplement to the smallpox vaccine information\nstatement, disseminating information to partners and clinicians, and\ndeveloping strategies to assess prospectively the incidence and potential\ncausal association of cardiac events among vaccine recipients.\nBecause a causal relation between smallpox vaccination and serious cardiac\nevents cannot be excluded, CDC recommends as a precautionary measure that\npersons with known cardiac disease with or without symptoms be excluded\nfrom vaccination.

Cardiac adverse events among civilians and myopericarditis cases\namong military vaccinees were reported to CDC from the Vaccine Adverse\nEvent Reporting System (VAERS) as of 23 Mar 2003. As of 23 Mar 2003, a total of 10 cases of myocarditis and/or pericarditis\nhave been identified among approximately 225 000 primary vaccinees in the\nmilitary smallpox vaccination program. Data from the military smallpox vaccination program are\nconsistent with a causal association between vaccination and\nmyopericarditis, although this association is not proven. A woman aged 54 years with a history of poorly controlled diabetes\nmellitus, hypertension, obesity, untreated hyperlipidemia, and a recent\nhistory of exertional chest pain was vaccinated on 3 Mar 2003. On 14 Mar 2003, a woman aged 45 years who was revaccinated on 26\nFeb 2003 had myocarditis; the patient had a history of hypertension treated\nwith an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (1).

The relation\nbetween smallpox vaccine and the coronary events observed in the civilian\nvaccination program is unclear. Reported adverse events are not\nnecessarily associated causally with vaccination, and some or all of these\nevents might be coincidental. In the first stage of the civilian program, active surveillance is being\nconducted for any adverse events after vaccination that require medical\ncare. A male civilian federal employee aged 45 years, who had a history\nof hypertension and who was vaccinated once as a child, was vaccinated on\n23 Jan 2003.

But William\nWinkenwerder Jr., assistant secretary of defense for health affairs, said\nthe heart attack death of a 55-year-old National Guardsman was more likely\nrelated to the man's high cholesterol and smoking than the vaccination.\n'That is very noteworthy in this case,' Winkenwerder said in an interview.\nThe evidence at this point, 'indicates smallpox vaccination was not likely\nto be the cause of his death.' More than 350 000 Defense Department\nemployees have been inoculated since December [2002].\nAlthough historically the smallpox vaccine has not been linked to heart\nattacks or angina, the recent cases have added to widespread reluctance in\nthe medical community to be immunized against a disease that has not been\nseen in 3 decades.\nIn the District, only 3 of the 11 health department workers scheduled for\ninoculation yesterday showed up, said Michael Richardson, the city's senior\ndeputy director of medical affairs.\nIllinois and New York suspended immunizations entirely, as did some\nindividual hospitals such as Dartmouth Medical Center in New Hampshire.\nOther states, such as Florida, postponed inoculations until they could\nupdate volunteers on new safety measures relating to heart risks.\nAt the CDC offices in Atlanta, staffers were fielding nervous phone calls\nfrom people who had been vaccinated and worried they may be at risk for\nheart failure, said Dixie Snyder, associate director for science at CDC.\nAt the 2-month mark, the Bush administration's effort to immunize millions\nis stalled, hampered by fears of the vaccine itself, doubts about the risk\nof a smallpox attack and the lack of compensation for people who suffer\ncomplications from the vaccine.\nSo far, 25 000 people have responded to President Bush's call for medical\npersonnel to be inoculated, a tiny fraction of the 450 000 that state\nofficials estimated they would need to set up mass vaccination clinics in\nthe event of a bioterrorism attack. The House has rescheduled a vote on a\ncompensation proposal for Monday, although Democrats complain the\nRepublican bill falls far short.\n'I think it's time to stop the program,' said one early skeptic, Richard\nWenzel, chief of internal medicine at the Virginia Commonwealth University\nMedical Center in Richmond. 'Now is the time to say let's err on the side\nof caution until this is really sorted out.'\nA safety subcommittee of CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices\nrecommended screening out anyone over age 50 and people under 50 with risk\nfactors for heart problems, said John Neff, cochair of the smallpox\nvaccination safety working group and a physician at Children's Hospital in\nSeattle. 'This would provide the maximum degree of safety for the\npopulation,' he said. 'That is our major concern.'\nIn an emergency 2-hour meeting, however, the full committee stopped short\nof that position yesterday, in part because it fears the vaccination\nprogram would come to a standstill.\nEliminating everyone over 50 would make it 'unfeasible to develop the\nnumbers we need for preparedness,' said Guthrie Birkhead, a committee\nmember and director of the Center for Community Health at the New York\nState Department of Health. 'We are taking extraordinary precautions\nbecause of a theoretical concern.'\nA few committee members said they preferred to wait for more data before\nproceeding with the program.\n'You can make the case the risks of this vaccine may be outweighing its\nbenefits, and at least for the moment, we should temporarily suspend this\nprogram,' said Paul Offit, chief of infectious diseases at Children's\nHospital in Philadelphia. But his proposal for a temporary halt to the\nprogram was quickly dismissed.\nCDC spokesmen said they did not know whether officials would adopt the\ncommittee's recommendation or stick to its decision this week to only weed\nout people with known heart disease, such as a previous heart attack.\nWhile experts study the recent cases in hospital workers, growing evidence\nsuggests that the 10 cases of heart inflammation in healthy, young Defense\nDepartment employees were related to the vaccine military and CDC experts\nsaid. In every case, the sharp heart pains subsided after patients received\npainkillers, and physicians do not expect any long-term damage.\nThat discovery raised another challenge for administration officials trying\nto refine the civilian vaccination program. Until now, states have targeted\nolder volunteers because research has shown the rate of serious reactions\nis much lower in people who had been previously vaccinated. But if the\ncardiac cases result in fewer older volunteers and more younger, first-time\nvaccinees, it is likely the number of heart inflammation cases is likely to\nrise, experts said.\nWhatever the CDC decides, many physicians, hospitals and health departments\nare charting their own course. David Pearle, a cardiologist at Georgetown\nUniversity Hospital, said he would err on the side of caution.\n'The worry would be not so much the 35-year-old who smokes, but perhaps the\n55-year-old who smokes and has a family history,' he said, describing the\ncomplex set of factors to consider in deciding who could safely get the\nvaccine. 'If there is a strong constellation of symptoms, I certainly would\nwithhold vaccine until we know more.'\n[Byline: Ceci Connolly]\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n******\n[2]\nDate: 29 Mar 2003\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: BayInsider.com 29 Mar 2003 9:16 AM PST [edited]\n<http://www.ktvu.com/news/2073447/detail.html>\n\nState Suspends Smallpox Vaccinations\n---------------------\nThe director of the California health department has temporarily cancelled\nthe state's smallpox vaccination program following widespread concern that\nthe vaccine caused heart problems in some of the people who received it.\nFriday's move by State Health Director Diane M. Bonta came on the same day\nthat health officials in Illinois and New York suspended all smallpox\nvaccinations while investigators review the deaths of 2 health care workers\nand a National Guardsman who suffered fatal heart attacks after being\nimmunized.\nEarlier in the day, the California Nurses Association had called on the\nstate to end its smallpox program. Although participation is voluntary for\nnurses and doctors, the nurses' group said it was irresponsible for the\nstate to administer the program when at least a dozen health care workers\nand military personnel across the country who received the vaccine\nexperienced heart troubles.\nBonta ordered local health departments throughout the state to postpone\ntheir smallpox vaccination clinics until at least 7 Apr 2003, saying the\ndelay would give the federal Centers for Disease Control time to study\npossible links between preexisting heart conditions and adverse vaccine\nreactions.\n'For those who volunteer for smallpox vaccination, safety must be our first\nconcern,' Bonta said. 'This delay will allow the smallpox vaccination\nprogram to resume in a manner that is safe and effective.'\nAs of Mar 2003, 18 989 Californians had received the smallpox vaccine,\naccording to the Department of Health Services.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n******\n[3]\nDate 29 Mar 2003\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: CDC Smallpox website - Interim smallpox fact sheet [Accessed 29\nMar 2003] [edited]\n<http://www.bt.cdc.gov/agent/smallpox/vaccination/heartproblems.asp>\n\nSmallpox Vaccine and Heart Problems\n-----------------\nCareful monitoring of smallpox vaccinations given over recent months has\nsuggested that the vaccine may cause heart inflammation (myocarditis),\ninflammation of the membrane covering the heart (pericarditis), and/or a\ncombination of these 2 problems (myopericarditis). Experts are exploring\nthis more in depth.\nHeart pain (angina) and heart attack also have been reported following\nsmallpox vaccination. However, it is not known at this time whether\nsmallpox vaccination caused these problems or whether they occurred by\nchance alone (heart problems are very common). Experts are investigating\nthis question also. Reported events are not necessarily caused by the\nvaccine, and some or all of these events might be coincidental.\nAs a precautionary step, people who have been diagnosed by a doctor as\nhaving heart disease with or without symptoms should not get the smallpox\nvaccine at this time, while experts continue their investigations.\nThese include heart conditions such as: previous myocardial infarction\n(heart attack); angina (chest pain caused by lack of blood flow to the\nheart); congestive heart failure; cardiomyopathy. These may be temporary\nexclusions and may change as more information is gathered. The presence of\nthese conditions in a close contact is not a reason to defer vaccination.\nAnyone who has received the smallpox vaccine should see a health care\nprovider right away if they develop chest pain, shortness of breath, or\nother symptoms of cardiac disease after vaccination.\nAnyone who has been diagnosed by a doctor as having heart disease and has\nalready received the smallpox vaccine should contact their heart disease\nspecialist or their regular health care provider if they have questions.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[The temporary suspension of vaccination activities on the part of several\nstates until more information is known about the possible association of\nvaccination with myocardial infarction (heart attack) is known is not\ntotally surprising. In the original postings of reports on cardiac\ncomplications following smallpox vaccination (see ProMED-mail posting\nSmallpox vaccination adverse events - USA (08) 20030327.0772), data on the\nexpected number of cardiac deaths in these age groups were presented\n(available in the MMWR report\n<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5212a2.htm>): 'By using the age\ndistribution for these persons, using year 2000 age-specific death rates\nfrom all causes, and assuming that the age distribution is the same for\npersons whose age is unknown, 2-3 deaths are expected to occur within 3\nweeks of vaccination among persons aged 45-54 years and an additional 2-3\ndeaths among vaccinees aged 55-64 years. Among vaccinees aged 45-64 years,\n1-2 cardiac-associated deaths are expected to occur within 3 weeks of\nvaccination.' Hence, the occurrence of 3 deaths following receipt of\nsmallpox vaccine may not represent a statistically significant event.\nOne should keep in mind that information on adverse events following\nsmallpox vaccination with calculations of expected reaction rates is based\non data from vaccination activities 30-40 years ago, when the overwhelming\nmajority of primary vaccinees were in the childhood population, with\nrevaccinations occurring primarily for those in military service (usually\nages 18-30 years and in excellent health). A review of the available\nliterature base (see ProMEDmail posting Smallpox vaccination adverse events\n- USA (07) 20030326.0749) revealed a series of case reports (primarily from\nEuropean countries) of myopericarditis and the occasional myocardial\ninfarct. Again, these were case reports, representing small numbers of\nobservations.

One should keep in mind that information on adverse events following\nsmallpox vaccination with calculations of expected reaction rates is based\non data from vaccination activities 30-40 years ago, when the overwhelming\nmajority of primary vaccinees were in the childhood population, with\nrevaccinations occurring primarily for those in military service (usually\nages 18-30 years and in excellent health). Most of the prior discussions\nconcerning potential adverse reactions associated with smallpox vaccination\nwere focused on today's environment, with larger numbers of potentially\nimmune compromised individuals being exposed to the vaccine either directly\nor indirectly through contact with recent vaccinees and concerns for\nadverse events associated with immune-compromised hosts. A ProMED-mail post\n<http://www.promedmail.org>\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\n<http://www.isid.org>\n Bonta ordered local health departments throughout the state to postpone\ntheir smallpox vaccination clinics until at least 7 Apr 2003, saying the\ndelay would give the federal Centers for Disease Control time to study\npossible links between preexisting heart conditions and adverse vaccine\nreactions. A safety subcommittee of CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices\nrecommended screening out anyone over age 50 and people under 50 with risk\nfactors for heart problems, said John Neff, cochair of the smallpox\nvaccination safety working group and a physician at Children's Hospital in\nSeattle. ' Friday's move by State Health Director Diane M. Bonta came on the same day\nthat health officials in Illinois and New York suspended all smallpox\nvaccinations while investigators review the deaths of 2 health care workers\nand a National Guardsman who suffered fatal heart attacks after being\nimmunized. \nCareful monitoring of smallpox vaccinations given over recent months has\nsuggested that the vaccine may cause heart inflammation (myocarditis),\ninflammation of the membrane covering the heart (pericarditis), and/or a\ncombination of these 2 problems (myopericarditis). At least 2 states suspended smallpox immunizations, and the Pentagon\nreported its first fatal post-inoculation heart attack yesterday, even as\nfederal scientists struggled to figure out whether the vaccine was\ntriggering a series of cardiac-related problems.\n Although participation is voluntary for\nnurses and doctors, the nurses' group said it was irresponsible for the\nstate to administer the program when at least a dozen health care workers\nand military personnel across the country who received the vaccine\nexperienced heart troubles. Also yesterday, the government's leading vaccine experts recommended that\nthe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention take additional precautions\nin the beleaguered program by screening out anyone volunteering for\ninoculation with known heart disease or risk factors such as hypertension,\ndiabetes, or high cholesterol. A review of the available\nliterature base (see ProMEDmail posting Smallpox vaccination adverse events\n- USA (07) 20030326.0749) revealed a series of case reports (primarily from\nEuropean countries) of myopericarditis and the occasional myocardial\ninfarct. For interested parties there is a vaccination adverse reactions fact sheet\nfor clinicians revised 28 Mar 2003, with brief information related to\npossible association with myopericarditis, available at:\n<http://www.bt.cdc.gov/agent/smallpox/vaccination/reactions-vacc-clinic.asp>\n The director of the California health department has temporarily cancelled\nthe state's smallpox vaccination program following widespread concern that\nthe vaccine caused heart problems in some of the people who received it.\n Anyone who has been diagnosed by a doctor as having heart disease and has\nalready received the smallpox vaccine should contact their heart disease\nspecialist or their regular health care provider if they have questions.\n [The temporary suspension of vaccination activities on the part of several\nstates until more information is known about the possible association of\nvaccination with myocardial infarction (heart attack) is known is not\ntotally surprising. While experts study the recent cases in hospital workers, growing evidence\nsuggests that the 10 cases of heart inflammation in healthy, young Defense\nDepartment employees were related to the vaccine military and CDC experts\nsaid. But William\nWinkenwerder Jr., assistant secretary of defense for health affairs, said\nthe heart attack death of a 55-year-old National Guardsman was more likely\nrelated to the man's high cholesterol and smoking than the vaccination. Although historically the smallpox vaccine has not been linked to heart\nattacks or angina, the recent cases have added to widespread reluctance in\nthe medical community to be immunized against a disease that has not been\nseen in 3 decades. At the 2-month mark, the Bush administration's effort to immunize millions\nis stalled, hampered by fears of the vaccine itself, doubts about the risk\nof a smallpox attack and the lack of compensation for people who suffer\ncomplications from the vaccine. But if the\ncardiac cases result in fewer older volunteers and more younger, first-time\nvaccinees, it is likely the number of heart inflammation cases is likely to\nrise, experts said. So far, 25 000 people have responded to President Bush's call for medical\npersonnel to be inoculated, a tiny fraction of the 450 000 that state\nofficials estimated they would need to set up mass vaccination clinics in\nthe event of a bioterrorism attack. The current vaccination effort underway in the USA is the\nfirst major activity with large numbers of primary vaccinees of young\nadults (in the military) and proposed large numbers of revaccinees over the\nage of 30 (in the civilian population). Eliminating everyone over 50 would make it 'unfeasible to develop the\nnumbers we need for preparedness,' said Guthrie Birkhead, a committee\nmember and director of the Center for Community Health at the New York\nState Department of Health. The worry would be not so much the 35-year-old who smokes, but perhaps the\n55-year-old who smokes and has a family history,' he said, describing the\ncomplex set of factors to consider in deciding who could safely get the\nvaccine. ' In an emergency 2-hour meeting, however, the full committee stopped short\nof that position yesterday, in part because it fears the vaccination\nprogram would come to a standstill.\n You can make the case the risks of this vaccine may be outweighing its\nbenefits, and at least for the moment, we should temporarily suspend this\nprogram,' said Paul Offit, chief of infectious diseases at Children's\nHospital in Philadelphia. Information on the official recommendations resulting from the emergency\nsession of the Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices (ACIP) held\nyesterday was not available for review at the time of preparation of this\nposting. Myopericarditis\nand possibly myocardial infarction did not factor into earlier discussions\nas predominant serious adverse events.\n [Byline: Ceci Connolly]\n--\nProMED-mail\n< These include heart conditions such as: previous myocardial infarction\n(heart attack); angina (chest pain caused by lack of blood flow to the\nheart); congestive heart failure; cardiomyopathy. Altogether, federal health experts are investigating at least 18 cases of\npossible cardiac reactions, including 3 fatal heart attacks in recently\nimmunized military personnel and civilian health care workers. CDC spokesmen said they did not know whether officials would adopt the\ncommittee's recommendation or stick to its decision this week to only weed\nout people with known heart disease, such as a previous heart attack. Anyone who has received the smallpox vaccine should see a health care\nprovider right away if they develop chest pain, shortness of breath, or\nother symptoms of cardiac disease after vaccination. As a precautionary step, people who have been diagnosed by a doctor as\nhaving heart disease with or without symptoms should not get the smallpox\nvaccine at this time, while experts continue their investigations. However, it is not known at this time whether\nsmallpox vaccination caused these problems or whether they occurred by\nchance alone (heart problems are very common). According to the newswire, the recommendation was to suspend\nvaccination of individuals over the age of 50 and those younger than 50\nwith a history of risk factors for heart disease.

This report describes cases of contact\ntransfer of vaccinia virus among vaccinated military personnel since\nDecember 2002; findings indicate that contact transfer of vaccinia virus is\nrare. Continued efforts are needed to educate vaccinees about the\nimportance of proper vaccination-site care in preventing contact\ntransmission, especially in household settings.\nDoD conducts surveillance for vaccine-associated adverse events by using\nautomated immunization registries, military communication channels, and the\nVaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS). Contact transfer cases are\ndefined as those in which vaccinia virus is confirmed by viral culture or\npolymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays. Other cases are classified as\nsuspected on the basis of lesion description and reported linkage to a\nvaccinated person 3 to 9 days before lesion development.\nDuring the period Dec 2002 to Jan 2004, a total of 578 286 military\npersonnel were vaccinated; 508 546 (88 per cent) were male, and 407 923 (71\nper cent) were primary vaccinees (received smallpox vaccination for the 1st\ntime). The median age of vaccinees was 29 years (range: 17 to 76). Among\nvaccinees, cases of suspected contact transfer of vaccinia were identified\namong 30 persons: 12 spouses, 8 adult intimate contacts, 8 adult friends,\nand 2 children in the same household. These cases were reported from\nColorado (4), North Carolina (4), Texas (4), Alaska (2), California (2),\none in each of Connecticut, Kansas, New Jersey, Ohio, South Carolina,\nWashington state, West Virginia, and overseas (7). The sources of suspected\ncontact transfer were all male service members who were primary vaccinees.\nExcept for 6 male sports partners, all infected contacts were female.\nVaccinia virus was confirmed in 18 (60 per cent) of the 30 cases by viral\nculture or PCR. Sixteen of the 18 confirmed cases involved uncomplicated\ninfections of the skin; 2 involved the eye (3). None resulted in eczema\nvaccinatum or progressive vaccinia. 12 of the 18 confirmed cases were among\nspouses or adult intimate contacts. The observed rate of contact transfer\nwas 5.2 per 100 000 vaccinees overall or 7.4 per 100 000 primary vaccinees.\nAmong 27 700 smallpox-vaccinated DoD health-care workers, no transmission\nof vaccinia from a vaccinated health-care worker to an unvaccinated patient\nor from a vaccinated patient to an unvaccinated health-care worker has been\nidentified.\n2 of the 18 confirmed cases of transfer of vaccinia virus resulted from\ntertiary transfer. One involved a service member, his wife, and their\nbreast-fed infant; the other involved serial transmission among male sports\npartners.\nCase reports\n------------\nCase 1\n------\nIn early May 2003, a service member received his primary smallpox\nvaccination. About 6 to 8 days after vaccination, he experienced a major\nreaction (an event that indicates a successful take; is characterized by a\npapule, vesicle, ulcer, or crusted lesion, surrounded by an area of\ninduration; and usually results in a scar) (4). The vaccinee reported no\nsubstantial pruritus. He slept in the same bed as his wife and kept the\nvaccination site covered with bandages. After bathing, he reportedly dried\nthe vaccination site with tissue, which he discarded into a trash\nreceptacle. He also used separate towels to dry himself, rolled them so the\narea that dried his arm was inside, and placed them in a laundry container.\nHis wife handled bed linen, soiled clothing, and towels; she reported that\nshe did not see any obvious drainage on clothing or linen and had no direct\ncontact with the vaccination site.\nIn mid-May, the wife had vesicular skin lesions on each breast near the\nareola but continued to breastfeed. About 2 weeks later, she was examined\nat a local hospital, treated for mastitis, and continued to breastfeed. The\nsame day, the infant had a vesicular lesion on the upper lip, followed by\nanother lesion on the left cheek (5). 3 days later, the infant was examined\nby a pediatrician, when another lesion was noted on her tongue. Because of\npossible early atopic dermatitis lesions on the infant's cheeks, contact\nvaccinia infection with increased risk for eczema vaccinatum was\nconsidered. The infant was transferred to a military referral medical\ncenter for further evaluation. On examination, the infant had seborrheic\ndermatitis and no ocular involvement. Skin lesion specimens from the mother\nand infant tested positive for vaccinia by viral culture and PCR at the\nAlaska Health Department Laboratory and at Madigan Army Medical Center.\nBecause both patients were stable clinically and the lesions were healing\nwithout risk for more serious complications, vaccinia immune globulin was\nnot administered. Neither patient had systemic complications from the\ninfection.\nCase 2\n------\nIn July 2003, a service member who had been vaccinated was wrestling with\nan unvaccinated service member at a military recreational function when the\nbandages covering the vaccination site fell off. The unvaccinated service\nmember subsequently wrestled with another unvaccinated service member. 6\ndays later, both unvaccinated service members had lesions on their\nforearms, neck, and face. Skin lesion specimens from both men tested\npositive for vaccinia virus by PCR and viral culture at Tripler Army\nMedical Center's microbiology laboratory.\n(Reported by: TW Barkdoll, MD, Okinawa, Japan.

However, the\nmajority of vaccinated DoD personnel who shared a bed did not transfer\nvaccinia virus to their contacts. The frequency of contact transfer in the\nmilitary vaccination program is comparable to rates observed during the\n1960s, although persons are less likely to be immune to vaccinia today and\nthus are more susceptible to contact transfer (1).\nThe 1st case of tertiary transfer described in this report underscores the\nneed for breastfeeding mothers with household contact with vaccinees to\ntake precautions to prevent inadvertent transmission of vaccinia to their\ninfants. Direct contact is presumed to be the major mode of transmission,\nbut clothing and bed linen might act as vectors for secondary transmission.\nTertiary transmission, although rare, is facilitated when the secondary\ninfection is not recognized. Programs that educate health care workers,\nvaccinees, and contacts should note that new vesicles or pustules that\nappear <15 days after the vaccinia scab falls off from the vaccination site\nmight be vaccinia infections. Although an infant living in the home is not\na contraindication to vaccination of a family member in a non-outbreak\nsetting, measures to prevent transmission include having vaccinees launder\ntheir own linens and towels and change their bandages away from other\nhousehold members.\nDuring the 1960s, the rate of unintentional infection with vaccinia in\nsecondary contacts was 2-6 cases per 100 000 primary vaccinees (4,6,7).\nDuring that period, 2/3 of reported contact infections occurred among\nchildren, typically siblings. Such spread could manifest as an inadvertent\ninfection or, in more severe fashion, as eczema vaccinatum or progressive\nvaccinia. Infections of the skin predominated, with rarer ocular\ninvolvement posing a risk for scarring or keratitis. In the current DoD\nsmallpox vaccination program, no cases of eczema vaccinatum have occurred,\nalthough the population of atopic dermatitis patients might have increased\nsubstantially since the 1960s (8). During the 1960s, eczema vaccinatum\nresulted in deaths, and 2/3 of such cases were related to contact transfer\nof vaccinia virus (6). In the current DoD smallpox vaccination program,\ncareful screening of DoD vaccinees and their household contacts for skin\ndiseases along with targeted education likely contributed to both screening\nout vaccine candidates with personal or close-contact contraindications and\neducating vaccinees about proper infection-control measures.\nHealth care workers and the public should report suspected cases of contact\ntransfer of vaccinia virus to their state or local health departments and\nto VAERS at <http://www.vaers.org>, or by telephone 800-822-7967. Viral\nculture or PCR assays, important for confirming vaccinia virus, are\navailable from the majority of state public health laboratories.\nReferences\n----------\n(1) Grabenstein JD, Winkenwerder W Jr. US military smallpox vaccination\nprogram experience.

In phase 2, all healthcare workers would be\noffered vaccination for smallpox.\nDuring their 17 Oct 2002 meeting, ACIP looked at what literature\nwas available on the use of more 'modern' dressings for smallpox\nvaccination site care, to come to its decision to recommend that\nhealthcare workers use a semipermeable membrane dressing over\ntheir vaccination site when they are working in healthcare facilities.\nThere appear to be only 2 relevant studies on the efficacy of such\ndressings:\nCooney EL, Collier AC, Greenberg PD, et. al. Safety of and\nimmunological response to a recombinant vaccinia virus vaccine\nexpressing HIV envelope glycoprotein. Lancet 1991; 337:567-72.\nGraham BS, Belshe RB, Clements ML, et.al. Vaccination of\nVaccinia-Naive Adults with Human Immunodeficieny Virus Type 1\ngp160 Recombinant Vaccinia Virus in a Blinded, Controlled,\nRandomized Clinical Trial. JID 1992; 166:244-52.\nCooney, et al. was a clinical trial of recombinant vaccinia vaccine.\nAlthough dressing barrier quality was not a focus of the study, some\nattempts were made to assess it. In this clinical trial, one layer of\nOpSite over gauze was used and 'all cultures of swabs taken of the\nouter surface of the dressing were negative for virus. None of the\nhousehold or sexual contacts showed rises in their serum vaccinia\nneutralising antibody titers or cutaneous manifestations consistent\nwith vaccinia exposure.' (p.570)\nGraham, et. al. was another study of recombinant vaccinia vaccine.\nIn the beginning of that trial, one layer of OpSite without gauze was\nused. When cultures were taken of the dressing, 12/66 were\npositive for vaccinia. The protocol was then changed and 2 layers of\nOpSite were used over gauze. They also instituted another change\nthat was probably the most critical: they began changing gloves\nbetween removal of the old dressing and reapplying the new. They\nthen recovered virus from 3/103 dressings. It is not unlikely that the\nearlier high number of positive cultures resulted from contamination\nof the dressing by the person doing the dressing changes, not from\nvirus being disseminated from under the dressing. Adding the layer\nof gauze under the dressing likely also helped.\nThese 2 additional studies mention the use of Tegaderm dressings,\nbut no assessment of the barrier quality of the dressing was\nreported.\nFrey SE, Couch RB, Tacket CO, et al. Clinical Responses to\nUndiluted and Diluted Smallpox Vaccine. NEJM 2002; 346(17):1265-\n74.\nFrey SE, Newman FK, Cruz, J, et al. Dose-Related Effects of\nSmallpox Vaccine. NEJM 2002; 346(17):1275- 80.\nIn November 2002, when the Minnesota Department of Health\nreceived word that phase 1 was likely to proceed, it was clear that\nthe issue of appropriate dressings was critical if ACIP was not\nrecommending routine furloughing of vaccinated healthcare\nworkers. We wanted to be sure that we would be able to recommend\nand provide a dressing that would be effective at preventing\ntransmission of vaccinia virus to patients.\nWe first looked at Smith Nephew (OpSite) and 3M (Tegaderm)\nproducts, since they are the two largest manufacturers of\nsemipermeable membrane dressings. We were interested in\ndressings that had an integrated gauze pad (island) because of the\nease of application of a one-piece dressing (as opposed to applying\na piece of gauze and then trying to put the semipermeable dressing\non top of that with one hand).\nWe also requested testing results for viral barrier effectiveness in\naccordance with ASTM F 1671-97, 'Standard Test Method for\nResistance of Materials Used in Protective Clothing to Penetration\nby Bloodborne Pathogens Using Phi-X 174 Bacteriophage\nPenetration as a Test System.' Both OpSite and Tegaderm have\npassed these testing criteria.\nWhen we contacted Smith Nephew (OpSite) and 3M (Tegaderm) in\nNovember 2002, we were the first government entity to contact\neither of them. Just the Minnesota order of the OpSite product we\nwere interested in would have consumed Smith Nephew's worldwide\ninventory of that particular product at that time.\nAlso, it should be noted that the OpSite products currently on the\nmarket differ from the product mentioned in the Lancet and JID\nreferences. The new product has less adhesive and is significantly\nmore permeable to water vapor than ordinary films in the presence\nof moisture. Presumably this would result in less maceration at the\nvaccination site when these dressings are worn [and possibly more\npermeability to vaccinia virus? - Mod.JW]\nAfter much consideration, MDH made the decision to order OpSite\nPost-Op. We purchased enough dressings to provide 10 for 5000\npotential phase 1 vaccinees, most of whom would be healthcare\nworkers. This particular product has been used in current smallpox\nvaccine clinical trials, including a trial at Mayo Clinic, with good\nresults.\nSemi-permeable dressings are expensive and the costs are an\nimportant issue to consider. We received prices of $.76 per\ndressing for OpSite Post-Op (9.5 cm x 8.5 cm) and $.74 per\ndressing for Tegaderm + Pad (9 cm x 10.5 cm). The ACIP\nrecommends that these dressings can be worn for 3-5 days for\nsmallpox vaccination, unless a change is indicated sooner. If we go\nto phase 2 and vaccinate an even larger number of healthcare\nworkers, the costs of these dressings will be substantial. Although\nMDH purchased the dressings for vaccinees in phase 1, we would\nnot be able to do so for phase 2. If participating hospitals were\nforced to absorb this cost, it would not be insignificant. [I would think\nthat a bulk price could be negotiated. - Mod.JW]\nAdditionally, ACIP recommends that each vaccinated healthcare\nworker have the barrier quality of their dressing assessed [visually? -\nMod.JW] at the beginning of each shift that they work. This has\nbeen difficult to operationalize for 3 (or more) shifts a day, 7 days a\nweek. These are all issues to be considered as phase 2 is\ndiscussed.\n--\nKathleen LeDell, MPH, RN\nAcute Disease Investigation and Control Section\nMinnesota Department of Health\n717 Delaware Street SE\nMinneapolis, MN 55414\n<Kathy.Ledell@state.mn.us>\n[The use of trade names and commer\ncial sources is for identification only and does not imply\nendorsement by ProMED-mail.

CDC is\ninvestigating whether there is any association between smallpox vaccination\nand reports of heart problems in 7 health care workers who have been\nvaccinated.\nCDC added the temporary measure to the existing list of deferral criteria\nbased on information from its real-time monitoring system, which showed a\nsmall number of heart-related incidents among health care workers following\nsmallpox vaccination. It is not clear whether this number is greater than\nwould be expected normally in this population, CDC scientists said.\n'We promised to monitor this program closely and to put safety first, so we\nare exercising exceptional caution,' said Julie Gerberding, M.D., CDC\ndirector. 'If our investigation shows this precautionary measure should\nbecome permanent or the need for other changes or enhancements in the\ncivilian smallpox vaccination program, we will take immediate action. We\ncontinue to believe that it is important and necessary to vaccinate health\ncare workers to prepare our nation in the event we have to respond to a\nsmallpox outbreak,' Dr. Gerberding said.\nCDC is recommending that persons with known cardiac disease -- such as\ncardiomyopathy, previous heart attack, history of angina, or other evidence\nof coronary artery disease -- be temporarily deferred from receiving\nsmallpox vaccination. CDC will provide states simple questions about heart\nproblems to use in screening people volunteering for smallpox vaccination.\nIn pursuing its promise of safety, last week CDC asked the Advisory\nCommittee on Immunization Practices' (ACIP) Smallpox Vaccine Safety Review\nBoard to examine reports of heart-related adverse events occurring in\nconnection with the smallpox vaccination program. CDC is also beginning\nresearch projects aimed at identifying and understanding any associations\nthat may exist between smallpox vaccine and heart-related problems.\n'A major part of our monitoring program involves regularly sharing\ninformation about adverse events with experts such as those on the ACIP.\nThey can help assess whether the smallpox vaccine is, indeed, associated\nwith the medical conditions described in the adverse event reports,' said\nWalter Orenstein, M.D., director of CDC's National Immunization Program.\nCDC has received several reports of heart-related problems among the 25 645\npeople who have been vaccinated in the civilian program. The 7 cases\nprompting today's precautionary action include 3 cases of myocardial\ninfarction (heart attack), one of which resulted in death; 2 cases of\nangina (chest pain); and 2 cases of myopericarditis (inflammation of the\nheart muscle or sac surrounding the heart). In each case the individual's\nmedical history, including risk factors for heart disease, is being studied.\nCases of heart inflammation following smallpox vaccination were reported in\nthe 1960s and 1970s. However, these reports do not provide any information\nabout the types of people who may be at higher risk for heart-related\nproblems following smallpox vaccination.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[A PubMed search on reports of myocardial events following smallpox\nvaccination revealed case reports of such events from Italy, Norway,\nRussia, Greece, France, Sweden, Poland, Germany, Czech Republic, UK, Former\nYugoslavia, and Hungary (a selection of these reports are referenced below\nfor those who may be interested). The report by Karjalainen J et. al\n(ref.19 ) mentions that 'the incidence of vaccinia myocarditis was 1/10 000\nsmallpox vaccinations.' (from abstract).

In the first\nstage of the program, active surveillance is being conducted for\npotentially life-threatening, moderate-to-severe, and other serious\nadverse events and for vaccinia transmission to contacts of vaccinees\n(1).\nNonserious events are reported through passive surveillance and are\nexpected to be underreported. This report summarizes smallpox vaccine\nadverse events reported among civilians vaccinated as of 28 Feb 2003,\nand among contacts of vaccinees, received by CDC from the Vaccine\nAdverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) as of 3 Mar 2003.\nPotentially life-threatening and moderate-to-serious events are\nclassified on the basis of evidence in support of the reported\ndiagnoses. For probable cases, other causes are excluded, and\nsupportive information is available. Events are classified as\nsuspected if they have clinical features compatible with the\ndiagnosis, but either further investigation is required or additional\ninvestigation of the case did not provide supporting evidence for the\ndiagnosis and did not identify an alternative diagnosis. CDC and\nstate and local health departments also receive reports of other\nevents that are associated temporally with smallpox vaccination.\nReported adverse events are not necessarily associated with\nvaccination, and some or all of these events might be coincidental.\nDuring 24 Jan - 28 Feb 2003 smallpox vaccine was administered to 12\n690 civilian health-care and public health workers in 45\njurisdictions. No potentially life-threatening adverse events of a\ntype known previously to be caused by smallpox vaccination have been\nreported as of 3 Mar 2003.\n2 moderate-to-severe adverse events were reported. Both were probable\ncases of ocular vaccinia, and both were traced to contact with\nmilitary personnel who received smallpox vaccine.\nA woman aged 26 years slept in the same bed several times a week over\na 3-week period with a military vaccinee beginning shortly after he\nreceived smallpox vaccine; he was reported often not to have kept his\nvaccination site covered. The woman became ill with swelling, pain,\nand discharge from the right eye, which progressed over the course of\n1 week to swelling of the entire right side of the face, difficulty\nopening and impaired vision in the right eye, and increased exudate,\ndespite treatment with antibacterial eyedrops. On 22 Feb 2003, she\nwas hospitalized. Ophthalmologic examination revealed severe right\nscleral injection and chemosis, a small pustule at the right\npalpebral lower lid margin, and tender right preauricular and\nsubmandibular adenopathy but found no evidence of keratitis, iritis,\nor periocular lesions. Orbital computerized tomography scan was\nconsistent with preseptal cellulitis without infection of the globe.\nThe patient's preseptal cellulitis improved within 24 hours after\ntreatment with intravenous antibiotics, and she was discharged on 25\nFeb 2003. The following day, the patient was readmitted with\npersistent right blepharoconjunctivitis. Preliminary viral cultures\nof conjunctival fluid revealed cytopathic effect consistent with\nviral infection, and a direct fluorescent antibody test was positive\nfor vaccinia. The patient improved within 24 hours after treatment\nwith trifluridine eyedrops and a single dose of intravenous vaccinia\nimmune globulin. She was discharged on 28 Feb 2003. The viral culture\nmaterial and a swab sample from the patient's eye were sent to CDC\nand tested positive for vaccinia DNA by real-time polymerase chain\nreaction (PCR).\nOn 14 Feb 2003, a woman aged 18 years with no history of smallpox\nvaccination handled the bandage of a military vaccinee. The woman had\na pustular skin lesion (size: 1.5 cm) with a small satellite lesion\non her right forearm 3 days after this contact and a second pustular\nlesion on the back of her upper right arm 5 days after contact,\nfollowed by irritation and swelling in her right eye 8 days after\ncontact. The patient first sought medical attention 11 days after the\ncontact and had a skin condition and bacterial conjunctivitis\ndiagnosed, which were treated with an oral antibiotic; 14 days after\ncontact, she was noted to have 2 small pustular lesions on her right\neyelid and had blepharoconjunctivitis diagnosed. She had marked\nimprovement within 24 hours after initiating treatment with\ntrifluridine eye drops. Specimens taken from eye and skin lesions\ndemonstrated vaccinia virus based on PCR.\n3 other serious adverse events were reported. One case involved\nheadache and dizziness; although headache has been reported after\nsmallpox vaccination, the casual role of smallpox vaccine in this\ncase is unknown. The other 2 events (cholecystitis and hypertension)\nare not known to be associated causally with smallpox vaccination.\nA woman aged 38 years had headache and dizziness 5 days after\nsmallpox vaccination; 6 days later, after the symptoms had increased\nin intensity, she was admitted to a hospital for evaluation. A\nneurologist observed no change in mental status or other neurologic\ndeficits; an MRI brain scan showed no abnormalities. The patient's\nsymptoms improved, and she was discharged 2 days later.\nA man aged 46 years with a history of hypertension was hospitalized 1\nday after vaccination with hypertension (blood pressure:\napproximately 230/120) and severe headache. The patient was treated\nwith antihypertensive medications and was discharged after 1 day.\nA woman aged 51 years had onset of chest discomfort, shortness of\nbreath, and nausea 2 days after vaccination. The patient had\ncholelithiasis with ductal blockage diagnosed and had a\ncholecystectomy; she was discharged after 3 days.\nAmong the 46 vaccinees with reported other nonserious adverse events\nduring 24 Jan-- 3 Mar 2003 [see table on\n<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5209a4.htm>], the most\ncommon signs and symptoms were fever (n = 11), pruritus (n = 11),\nrash (n = 10), and pain (n = 7). All of these commonly reported\nevents are consistent with mild expected reactions following receipt\nof smallpox vaccine. Some vaccinees reported multiple signs and\nsymptoms.\nSurveillance for adverse events during the civilian smallpox\nvaccination program is ongoing; regular surveillance reports will be\npublished in MMWR.\nReported by: Smallpox Vaccine Adverse Events coordinators. National\nCenter for Infectious Diseases; National Immunization Program, CDC.\n[MMWR] Editorial Note:\nThis report highlights the importance of proper vaccination site care\nin preventing contact transmission of vaccinia virus and the need for\nvaccinees and unvaccinated persons who have contact with vaccinees to\nprotect against contact transmission (2). Vaccinees who do not work\nin health-care settings should cover the vaccination site with a\ngauze bandage that is secured by first-aid adhesive tape and should\nchange the bandage frequently (i.e., every 1--3 days). Vaccinees\nshould keep the vaccination site dry, cover it with a waterproof\nbandage during bathing, and change back to a gauze bandage after\nbathing. Gauze bandages should be changed whenever they become wet.\nAs an added precaution, vaccinees should wear a long-sleeved shirt\nthat covers the vaccination site, particularly in situations\ninvolving close physical contact. Vaccinees should practice\nconsistent hand hygiene by washing thoroughly with antimicrobial soap\nand water or with an approved alcohol-based hand-rub (i.e., one that\ncontains >60 percent alcohol) after any contact with the vaccination\nsite or with materials that have come into contact with the site,\nincluding bandages, clothing, towels, and sheets. Contaminated\nbandages and scabs from the vaccination site should be placed in a\nsealed plastic bag and discarded. Vaccinees should keep a separate\nlaundry hamper for clothing, towels, sheets, and other items that\nmight have come in direct contact with the vaccination site or with\ndrainage from the site; these items should be washed by using hot\nwater with detergent and/or bleach.\nContacts of vaccinees should not touch the vaccine site or any\nmaterials that might be contaminated with vaccine virus, including\nbandages, clothing, towels, or sheets. Contacts who touch any\npotentially contaminated materials inadvertently should wash their\nhands immediately. Vaccinated persons and their contacts who share a\nbed should be certain that the vaccination site is covered with a\nbandage and shirt sleeve.\nReferences\n1. CDC.

As of 4 Feb 2003, a total of 37 states and counties have received\nshipments of smallpox vaccine, and 18 states and counties have begun\nsmallpox vaccination; no serious adverse events have been reported. To\nmonitor the occurrence of adverse events associated with vaccination, both\nthose expected on the basis of previous experience and possible new\nunexpected adverse events, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\n(CDC) and state health departments have established the Smallpox Vaccine\nAdverse Events Monitoring and Response System. The system also will be used\nto monitor the effectiveness of contraindication screening, identify new\ncontraindications, and coordinate the distribution of vaccinia immune\nglobulin (VIG) and cidofovir to the civilian population. This notice\ndescribes the components of the system, delineates roles and\nresponsibilities, and explains how data from the system will be compiled\nand communicated.\nThe first stage of the vaccination program targets 1) smallpox response\nteams designated by terrorism and public health authorities to conduct\ninvestigation and follow-up of initial smallpox cases and 2) health care\nteams whose members are trained to provide medical care for initial\nsmallpox patients (1). During this stage, the Institute of Medicine (IOM)\nhas recommended active surveillance for adverse events following smallpox\nvaccination (2). To implement this recommendation among all vaccinees and\ntheir contacts, the system will track adverse events that require\nhospitalization or outpatient care, contraindications to vaccination among\nvaccinees or household contacts not identified at the time of vaccination,\nand vaccinia transmission to contacts of vaccinees. CDC also will collect\ndata from people who experience commoner, nonserious adverse events in a\ntelephone survey of about 10 000 vaccinees from at least 8 states and\ncities administered at days 10 and 21 following vaccination.\nSuccessful monitoring of and response to adverse events following smallpox\nvaccination depends on the efforts of vaccination clinic staff,\nvaccination-site--care monitors at hospitals and other locations, health\ncare providers, state health departments, and CDC. At smallpox vaccination\nclinics, a unique identifying number will be assigned to each vaccinee, and\neach vaccinee's vaccination information will be entered into an electronic\ntracking system (either the Pre-event Vaccination System (PVS) maintained\nby CDC or the state equivalent). In the days following vaccination,\nmonitors at hospitals and other locations should assess vaccination-site\ncare, symptoms reported by the vaccinees, and vaccine take (that is,\nresponse to vaccination). For hospital staff, monitors also should\ndetermine fitness for duty. CDC's web-based Hospital Smallpox Vaccine\nMonitoring System can be used to facilitate monitoring and to enter\ntracking data. Vaccination-site--care monitors and health-care providers\nshould report adverse events associated with vaccination as they occur\n[table below]. When vaccination follow-up is completed (usually 21--28 days\nafter vaccination), vaccination-site--care monitors should ensure that\ninformation about adverse events that require hospitalization or outpatient\ncare, contraindications identified after vaccination, and contact\ntransmission are documented for all vaccinees. CDC will provide a data\nentry mechanism linked to PVS for documenting this information.\nHealth care providers who need assistance with evaluating a smallpox\nvaccinee with a potential adverse event should contact their state health\ndepartment or CDC's clinician information line, telephone 877-554-4625.\nStaffed by nurses 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, this information line is a\nsource for general smallpox clinical adverse event information and for\nassistance with adverse event reporting.

But the ministry said it would\nexpand a program to inoculate thousands more rescue and emergency workers.\n'At this stage we have not decided to inoculate the general public, but we\ndid agree to open up the inoculation of the first response teams as far as\npossible,' said Ido Hadari, a spokesman for the Health Ministry.\nHadari said the ministry made the decision because there was no additional\nintelligence on Iraq's potential to use smallpox as a weapon against Israel\nin response to any U.S. strike.\nIsrael has already vaccinated 15 000 emergency workers against the\nhighly-infectious smallpox, with few side effects. 'There are thousands\nmore rescue workers...it can reach up to 100 000 people,' Hadari said,\nciting firefighters, hospital and clinic staff, police and army\npersonnel. The program is currently voluntary.\nAdvocates against a mass inoculation note that the vaccine itself can cause\nsevere side effects or even death in a few cases, and that such a program\ncan spread unnecessary panic.\nIn a sign of the mounting concern, 2 leading Israeli healthcare providers\nopened a hotline this week for anxious citizens to answer their questions\non smallpox and the vaccine.\nBabies born in Israel were inoculated against smallpox until 1980, when the\ndisease was declared defunct worldwide, and all Israeli military conscripts\nwere vaccinated until 1996. About half of Israel's population of 6 million\npeople are estimated to have received the inoculation at some time in their\nlives.\n'There is no new information (about a threatened outbreak of the disease),\nand we are doing everything to be ready for a situation in which we can\ninoculate the entire public within a few days if necessary,' Hadari\nsaid. 'Once we have our first response teams inoculated and a contingency\nplan (for the wider public), we can feel quite safe,' he said.\nIraq fired 39 Scud missiles at Israel during the U.S.-led 1991 Gulf War,\nresulting in one death and few other casualties.

At the same time there have been calls for mass vaccination\nof the public, or vaccination of the public on a voluntary basis. In the\nUnited States (US), while concentrating on selective vaccination, the\ngovernment has decided to make the vaccine 'available to all' from 2004 (3).\nThe European Commission Taskforce on Bioterrorism (BICHAT) has commented\nthat a number of complex issues and present uncertainties would make a\none-to-one translation of the US plan to the European situation an\nunjustified oversimplification (4).\nA series of articles was published electronically ahead of print publication\nin the New England Journal of Medicine on 19 Dec 2002 and aims to provide\ninformed guidance on the current public health question 'whom should we be\nvaccinating?' By highlighting the adverse consequences of a mass vaccination\npolicy, the articles support current plans for selective smallpox\nvaccination, and provide physicians with information to help them educate\ntheir patients when the inevitable requests for vaccination are received.\nMack counsels against widespread pre-emptive vaccination, either of\nhealthcare workers or the public, because historical records indicate that a\nsmallpox outbreak could be successfully and rapidly controlled (5). The\ndisease is likely to be easily distinguishable, the virus is not highly\ncontagious, and the interval between successive cases (about 14 days) makes\ntransmission of infection open to intervention.\nA new mathematical model from Bozzette et al. favours prior vaccination of\nhealthcare workers (6). The balance in favour of vaccination is biased\ntowards the likelihood of an attack, which is difficult to assess. Their\nresults show that pre-emptive vaccination of 10 million healthcare workers\nproduces net benefits in terms of lives saved when the probability of a\n'large' attack (350 initial cases of smallpox) exceeds 0.22. Pre-emptive\nmass vaccination of the general public saves lives on a net basis only when\na 'massive' attack (5000 people initially infected) is expected (probability\ngreater than 0.22).\nSepkowitz considers adverse effects due to secondary spread of vaccinia, a\nfactor that has not yet been taken into account in mathematical models (7).\nComplications from transmission of vaccinia have been described in 112 cases\nin the twentieth century, including 12 deaths. Most of these occurred in\nhospitals. If healthcare workers are to be vaccinated, it is essential that\nadequate precautions be taken to prevent spread of vaccinia to patients,\nespecially now that many of them are immunosuppressed due to illness or\ntreatment.\nVoluntary vaccination of the public has its advocates both among health\nprofessionals and in the media. However, a paper from Blendon et al. shows\nthat the public may not yet know enough about smallpox to be able to make an\ninformed decision (8). In a questionnaire survey of 1006 US adults with a\nresponse rate of 65 percent, most people had misconceptions about the\ndisease. Despite 25 percent saying it was likely they would die from the\nvaccine (6 percent thought this was very likely), over 60 percent said they\nwould choose to receive vaccination as a precaution against a terrorist\nattack.\nAn issue that is not mentioned in these articles is the opportunity cost of\nsmallpox vaccination. It may cause harm not only directly, but through the\npotentially very large resources consumed that might be better used to\nprevent or treat other diseases, and also by having a negative effect on\npublic attitudes to other components of national immunisation programmes. It\nis essential to ensure that current smallpox vaccination policies are\ndeveloped and implemented in the context of overall public health priorities\nand strategies, and that they are underpinned by sound science and risk\nassessment.\nReferences :\n1.

An Israeli researcher told an expert US panel about the\nexperience so far.\nSince October, Israel has vaccinated 17,500 health care workers. There have\nbeen only a handful of serious side-effects. That's partly because all the\nvaccinated Israelis had been immunized years before...lowering their risk\nof side effects.\nBut one case is catching attention. An Israeli surgeon ignored warnings\nthat people should not be vaccinated if someone at home has low immunity.\nHis wife was on medication that lowers immunity. The surgeon infected her\nwith the vaccinia virus, a cousin of smallpox. Days later her body was\ncovered with sores. She survived after a 3-week hospital stay. but she's\nscarred for life.\nThe case shows that some people who shouldn't be vaccinated will slip\nthrough the most careful screening programs.\n[2]\n[Text of NPR report of 20 Dec 2002 by Richard Knox] [edited]\nIn the first report on the week-old program to protect US military\npersonnel against smallpox, officials say many have medical conditions that\ndisqualify them for vaccination.\nSince last Friday, the military has screened 276 personnel for possible\nvaccination. But only 174 have actually gotten the vaccine. Nearly 40\npercent were screened out. Most had a medical condition that put them at\nrisk of a severe vaccine reaction. But many had someone in their household\nwith such a risk. For 3 weeks after vaccination, a person can pass on the\nvaccine virus [vaccinia] to close contacts. Many people were worried they\nmight infect relatives at holiday gatherings.\nDefense Department officials told an expert panel that no bad side effects\nhave shown up so far.

The\ngovernment will make the vaccine available to the general public\nbeginning in late spring or early summer, though Bush emphasized that\nit is not recommended for most people. He said his family and staff\n-- including Vice President Dick Cheney and the Cabinet -- would not\nbe vaccinated.\nWith war in Iraq a growing possibility, Bush said the vaccine will be\nmandated for about a half-million U.S. troops in ``high-risk parts of\nthe world.'' Bush noted that the disease was eradicated in 1980, but\nsaid, ``In the aftermath of September the 11th, we are evaluating old\nthreats in a new light.''\nThe shot that carries rare but serious side effects. One or 2 out of\nevery 1 million vaccinated will be killed by the vaccine, and 15 will\nface life-threatening complications.\n'As commander in chief, I do not believe I can ask others to accept\nthis risk unless I am willing to do the same,' Bush said. 'Therefore,\nI will receive the vaccine along with our military.'\nIt was unclear how troops would respond to this directive. Some in\nthe military balked at mandatory anthrax vaccinations, which are\nconsiderably safer than smallpox vaccinations. About 20 000 people\nworking in U.S. embassies in the Middle East will also be offered the\nvaccine, the State Department said.\nCivilian vaccinations will begin with about 450 000 people most\nlikely to encounter a highly contagious smallpox patient. That\nincludes people who work in hospital emergency rooms and those on\nspecial smallpox response teams. States have already identified these\npeople and are preparing to set up clinics. Once these programs\nbegin, it's expected to take about 30 days to vaccinate this group.\nNext up will be emergency responders, such as police officers,\nfirefighters, and other health care workers. The government is\nrecommending the vaccine for an estimated 10 million in this group,\nand health officials predicted Friday that about half would say yes.\nIt was unclear when these shots would begin or how long it would take\nto vaccinate this group.\nFor months, the administration has been debating vaccinations for the\ngeneral public. Top health advisers preferred to wait until the\nvaccine, just recently manufactured, is licensed by the Food and Drug\nAdministration before offering it to people who face no particular\nthreat. That's not likely until early 2004. But Bush decided that the\nadministration could not offer a vaccine to some without making it\navailable to all.\n'Some individuals feel so strongly they want to be vaccinated right\nnow that we wanted to make it available,' Health and Human Services\nSecretary Tommy Thompson said. Those who want the vaccine can sign up\nfor clinical trials now under way. HHS will create a special program\nfor people who want to sign up -- expected in late spring or early\nsummer 2003, health officials said. Civilians could wait until 2004,\nafter the vaccine is licensed, although it will still not be\nrecommended.\nBush and his top health aides emphasized that there is enough vaccine\nfor all 280 million people in this country, and that plans are in\nplace for mass vaccinations should an attack with the virus occur.\nOnce among the most feared diseases on Earth, smallpox killed\nhundreds of millions of people in past centuries, but it hasn't been\nseen in this country since 1949. Its eradication was one of public\nhealth's greatest victories. But because no one has been vaccinated\nin decades, the population is highly vulnerable. While all stocks of\nthe virus beyond 2 official labs were supposed to have been\ndestroyed, experts fear that hostile nations or terrorist groups may\nhave smallpox and could use it in an attack.\nAn education campaign will explain the vaccine's risks in detail.\nThe most serious complications include encephalitis, which can cause\nparalysis or permanent neurological damage, and progressive vaccinia,\nwhere the vaccination site does not heal and the virus spreads,\neating away at flesh, bone and gut.\nThe vaccine poses significant risks for certain people, including\ncancer patients, organ transplant recipients, people with HIV,\npregnant women, and people with a history of eczema. People who live\nwith others who have these conditions should not be vaccinated,\nbecause the live virus used in the vaccine can sometimes escape the\ninoculation site and infect others. Health workers delivering the\nshots will have to ask questions that will screen these people out.\nFederal officials are recommending that states make pregnancy and HIV\ntests available to people considering the vaccination.\nHealth officials said they have enough vaccinia immune globulin, or\nVIG, which is used to treat side effects of the vaccine, to care for\nthose being offered the vaccine in the coming months.\n******\n[2]\nDate: 13 Dec 2002\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: CDC Bioterrorism Website\n<http://www.bt.cdc.gov/agent/smallpox/vaccination/pdf/vaccination-program-statement.pdf>\n\nPROTECTING AMERICANS: SMALLPOX VACCINATION PROGRAM\n---------------------------------\nToday, the President announced a plan to better protect the American\npeople against the threat of smallpox attack by hostile groups or\ngovernments:\nSmallpox Response Teams\nUnder the plan, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)\nwill work with state and local governments to form volunteer Smallpox\nResponse Teams who can provide critical services to their fellow\nAmericans in the event of a smallpox attack.\nTo ensure that Smallpox Response Teams can mobilize immediately in an\nemergency, health care workers and other critical personnel will be\nasked to volunteer to receive the smallpox vaccine.\nThe federal government is not recommending vaccination for the\ngeneral public at this time. There may be some members of the\ngeneral public who insist on being vaccinated now. Our public health\nagencies will work to accommodate them, but that is not our\nrecommendation at this time.\nDepartment of Defense and State Department Personnel\nThe President also announced that the Department of Defense (DOD)\nwill vaccinate certain military and civilian personnel who are or may\nbe deployed in high threat areas. Some United States personnel\nassigned to certain overseas embassies will also be offered\nvaccination.\nSTRENGTHENING HOMELAND SECURITY\nAlthough there is no reason to believe that smallpox presents an\nimminent threat, the attacks of September and October, 2001 have\nheightened concern that terrorists may have access to the virus and\nattempt to use it against the American public. Immediately after\nthese attacks, HHS began working, in cooperation with state and local\ngovernments, to strengthen our preparedness for bioterror attacks by\nexpanding the national stockpile of smallpox vaccine. The United\nStates currently has sufficient quantities of the vaccine to\nvaccinate every single person in the country in an emergency.\nThe smallpox vaccine, which was routinely administered to Americans\nuntil 1972, is a highly effective protection against the disease when\ngiven before or shortly after exposure to the virus. Pre-attack\nvaccination of Smallpox Response Teams will allow them, in the event\nof a smallpox attack, to immediately administer the vaccine to others\nand care for victims.\nHHS is working with states to identify health care workers and first\nresponders to serve on Smallpox Response Teams. Pre-attack\nvaccination of these Smallpox Response Teams will allow them to\nbetter protect the American public against smallpox attack.\nThe federal government is not recommending that members of the\ngeneral public be vaccinated at this point. Our government has no\ninformation that a biological attack is imminent, and there are\nsignificant side effects and risks associated with the vaccine. HHS\nis in the process of establishing an orderly process to make\nunlicensed vaccine available to those adult members of the general\npublic without medical contraindications who insist on being\nvaccinated either in 2003, with an unlicensed vaccine, or in\n2004, with a licensed vaccine. (A member of the general public may\nalso be eligible to volunteer for an on-going clinical trial\nfor next generation vaccines).\nPREPARING MILITARY AND OVERSEAS PERSONNEL\nThe President also announced that DOD will take steps immediately to\nreinstitute vaccination of certain military and civilian personnel.\nThose personnel who are deployed or who may deploy to certain high\nthreat areas will be vaccinated. The State Department will also\noffer vaccination to certain overseas personnel.\nAlthough the vaccine is effective if administered shortly after\nexposure, it may not be feasible during an emergency to vaccinate\noverseas troops and civilian personnel. Pre-attack vaccination is\ntherefore warranted. Vaccination of military personnel was conducted\nduring WWI and WWII and routinely from the 1940s until 1984.\nBetween 1984 and 1990, vaccinations were provided to many recruits\nentering basic training.\n-To read more on the disease, visit <http://www.bt.cdc.gov/agent/smallpox>\n-To read more on the vaccine, visit\n<http://www.bt.cdc.gov/agent/smallpox/vaccination/facts.asp>\n-To read more on medical conditions that make pre-vaccination\nunadvisable, visit\n<http://www.bt.cdc.gov/agent/smallpox/vaccination/contraindications-public.asp>\n-Persons interested in participating in an on-going clinical trial\ncan obtain additional information at .\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[ProMED-mail has covered the development of the current smallpox\nvaccination strategies in the USA and elsewhere fairly extensively.\nSince our last posting on the development of the USA smallpox\nvaccination strategy on 12 Nov 2002, there has been no new technical\ninformation available to suggest that there has been a change in the\nrisks of significant adverse events following receipt of the vaccine.\nRates of adverse events following receipt of smallpox vaccination\nwere developed based on experiences in the 50s and 60s and are cited\nas rates per 1 000 000 persons vaccinated.

Some at our Cancer Center take this to\nmean anyone who is working directly or may be within 6 feet of our\ncancer patients (i.e., virtually everyone). How have other centers\nwith immunosuppressed populations interpreted this contraindication?\nMy understanding is that in a 1968 study from 10 state surveillance,\nonly 27 post-vaccination transmissions were documented per million.\nWith better wound care, strict hand-washing, and vaccination of only\nthose with a preexisting scar, shouldn't the risk be considerably\nlower?\n--\nJ Tarrand MD\nMD Anderson cancer center\n[Dr. Tarrand's questions re: smallpox vaccination risks are\nlegitimate ones that face many health care institutions. This\nmoderator chooses to preface a response with an acknowledgement that\ndefinitive answers are not easy to come by. Information and studies\non the adverse effects of smallpox vaccination are primarily from\ntimes of outbreaks and from the era when routine smallpox vaccination\nwas conducted. As routine immunizations were discontinued in the USA\nin 1972, and worldwide in 1982, the numbers of immunosuppressed\npersons who were potentially exposed to recently vaccinated\nindividuals was significantly lower than today (in the general\npublic), and definitely lower than patient populations in the\nhospital institutional setting.\nThere is a good summary of the data from Lane's papers on smallpox\nvaccination adverse effects at:\n<http://www.bt.cdc.gov/agent/smallpox/vaccine-safety/adverse-events-chart.asp>\n(1. Lane JM, Ruben FL, Neff JM, Millar JD. Complications of smallpox\nvaccinations, 1968: national surveillance in the United States. New\nEngl J Med 1969;281:1201-1208.\n2. Lane JM, Ruben FL, Neff JM, Millar JD. Complications of smallpox\nvaccination, 1968: results of ten statewide surveys. J Infect Dis\n1970;122:303-309. )\nThe numbers of inadvertent inoculations per 1 000 000 vaccinees cited\nin the 2 studies were:\n(the primary vaccinees were predominantly infants less than one year of age):\nNATIONAL SURVEY (Ref 1 above)\nAll primary (i.e., first-time) vaccinees 25.4\nVaccinees greater than or equal to 1 year of age 27.1\n10-STATE SURVEY (Ref 2 above)\nAll primary (i.e., first-time) vaccinees 529.2\nVaccinees greater than or equal to 1 year of age 532.0\nThe last paragraph in the discussion is important: 'The authors of\nthe studies state that the national survey statistics should be\nconsidered minimal estimates of the risks of smallpox vaccination.\nThe authors assert, on the other hand, that a small number of\npatients included in the 10-state survey may have been vaccinated\nprior to or after 1968. Those rates, therefore, may overestimate\nslightly the true incidence of complications. Thus, when describing\nrates of the more severe smallpox vaccine adverse events in 1968\n(vaccinial encephalitis, vaccinia necrosum, and eczema vaccinatum),\nit appears to be preferable to use the range presented by the 2\nstudies. The 10-state survey data may present a better estimate of\nless severe adverse event rates from 1968 (generalized vaccinia and\naccidental autoinoculation).'\nYes, there is a reported shorter duration of inoculation site\ninfection in those with pre-existing immunity. However, the current\nbody of literature is unclear on the duration of immunity; the\ncommonly accepted duration is 10 years, but current studies are few.\nFrelinger and Garba (ref 1 below) reported that 13/14 subjects\nstudied had detectable antibody 35 or more years after last known\nexposure to smallpox vaccine. A study by Suari et al. in Maryland\ninvolved 621 subjects and concluded that approximately 75 percent of\nhis population had no evidence of residual immunity as defined by\n'take rate' following revaccination (ref 3 below). A study by Frey\net al. (ref 2 below) of 680 never-vaccinated individuals, while\naddressing the issue of dilution of vaccine dose, noted that 5.7\npercent (37) of vaccinees had rashes at sites other than the\nvaccination site on days 7,8, and 9 and 10.1 percent (67) on day\n10,11, or 12 with an overall 14.3 percent (95) having a rash at a\nsite other than the vaccination site.\nThis moderator cannot address the question of how other centers with\nimmunosuppressed populations are interpreting this contraindication\nbut can only guess that there are significant concerns, especially\ngiven the high level of 'unknowns' at present. ProMED-mail would be\nvery interested in hearing how other institutions are interpreting\nthis contraindication to vaccination in light of the planned\nvaccination activities.\n1: Frelinger JA, Garba ML.

As routine immunizations were discontinued in the USA\nin 1972, and worldwide in 1982, the numbers of immunosuppressed\npersons who were potentially exposed to recently vaccinated\nindividuals was significantly lower than today (in the general\npublic), and definitely lower than patient populations in the\nhospital institutional setting.

The guidelines, which\nare for discussion over the next month, describe vaccination strategies\nprior to and in the event of an outbreak, procedures for diagnosis and\nmanagement of the initial cases, and other essential outbreak preparedness\nand control measures.\nThe level of threat of a deliberate release is unknown but is likely to be\nextremely low. While smallpox remains eradicated, the risks from adverse\neffects of vaccination outweigh the risks from disease. Experience in the\nUnited States in the late 1960s found that among people aged over 20 years\nwho were being vaccinated for the first time severe adverse vaccine related\nevents occurred at a rate of around 1500 per million people vaccinated,\nwith about one death per million people vaccinated (3).\nThe number of people to be vaccinated will therefore be limited to a few\nhundred specialist health care workers who would be required to assess and\nmanage any initial cases. In the event of a heightened threat, for example\nif smallpox re-emerges elsewhere in the world, a greater number of health\ncare, emergency, and other essential personnel will be offered vaccination\nin case they are required to respond to a smallpox emergency in the United\nKingdom (UK).\nRapid diagnosis and response to the first cases is essential to limit the\nsize of any outbreak.

Regional directors of public health in England\nhave been given responsibility for establishing networks of ID physicians\nand emergency teams. Members will be identified and then vaccinated, and it\nis hoped that this can be completed by the end of January 2003.\nIn the event of an outbreak, a search and containment strategy will be\ndeployed, with rapid isolation of cases and tracing, vaccination, and\nmonitoring of contacts. To prepare for this all regions have been asked to\nidentify smallpox care centres and smallpox vaccination centres that could\nbe opened within 24 hours to provide isolation for cases and vaccination\nfor contacts. Search and containment measures will focus on close contacts\nof smallpox patients, since they are most at risk from infection.\nReferences:\n1. Department of Health.

While there are studies of use of formaldehyde vapor\ndisinfection against vaccinia virus, these appear to have used virus\nembedded in scabs (4,5). My understanding is there is much less\nrelease of virus when fixed in a scab matrix, so I am not sure this\nis directly applicable. Fogging or vaporization of disinfectants in\nthe environment in US health care facilities was discontinued about\nthe same time as vaccinia virus vaccine was shelved: the very early\n1970s.

Four people were hospitalized as a\nresult of the vaccination drive, said spokesman Ido Hadari.These included\nthe child of one worker and the spouse of another, who had come into\ncontact with their family member's vaccine scar, causing blisters and a\nmild fever. The other 2 were treated for minor side effects.\nSmallpox vaccination can carry severe side effects and even cause death in\nvery rare cases. Hadari said Israel was sharing its results with the United\nStates, which vaccinated 100 military medics on Wednesday in the first wave\nof a program to immunize millions of troops and emergency workers who could\nbe called to respond to any smallpox attack.\nWashington launched the drive amid concern some terror organizations could\nhave developed smallpox into biological weapons.The virus kills around 30\npercent of its victims. Israel and the United States also fear Baghdad may\nhave developed smallpox as a weapon. Israel is preparing for possible Iraqi\nmissile attacks should the United States launch an offensive against\nBaghdad. Babies born in Israel were inoculated with the smallpox vaccine up\nuntil 1980, and all Israeli military conscripts were vaccinated until 1996.\n'You can expect that one case out of a million that gets the vaccination\nmight die. In a population that has been vaccinated in the past, we can say\nthere will be only one death for every two to four million,' Hadari said.\nIsrael has stockpiled enough doses of smallpox to vaccinate its entire\npopulation of six million. Hadari declined to say when the rest of the\npopulation might be vaccinated.\nIraq fired 39 Scud missiles at Israel in retaliation for US-led air attacks\nduring the 1991 Gulf War. The missiles were armed with conventional\nwarheads but some Israelis fear Saddam Hussein may arm Scuds with chemical\nor biological warheads if he believes the US is on the verge of ousting him.\n******\n[2]\nDate: 21 Dec 2002\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: Business Week\n<http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/dec2002/nf20021220_6319.htm>\n\nSmallpox Vaccination Tips from Israel\nIt has learned several valuable lessons that would help the implementation\nof Bush's inoculation program\n---------------------------------\nWhen President George W. Bush announced that Americans should be provided\nwith smallpox vaccinations to protect them against the threat of biological\nterrorism, the health-care community applauded. At the same time, though,\nit must be asking itself: How are we going to pull this off?\nIt can start by taking a look at what Israel has done over the past 6\nmonths. Last July, the country decided to start vaccinating for smallpox in\ncase of a bioterror attack from Iraq. Since then, it has vaccinated nearly\n15,000 emergency-care workers and come up with a plan to quickly inoculate\nIsrael's entire population of 6 million if hostilities break out.\n'The first decision we had to make was how many people and which ones,'\nsays Ido Harari, a spokesman for the Israeli Health Ministry. It considered\n3 alternatives: a mass inoculation of the population, which would take a\nweek but might have brought the country to a standstill; a month-long\nprogram that would have done the entire country in stages; and a trial-run\nvaccination of emergency workers and first responders.\nEARLY DETECTION. Israel's health experts chose a combination of the first\nand third options: They would vaccinate a test group of about 15,000 first\nresponders -- plus the remaining population en masse should there be an\nattack. Since the smallpox virus requires 10 days to take hold and spread,\nthat would give health officials about a week to vaccinate everyone.\nTo make sure they spot a virus the instant it's released and thus have\nmaximum time to fight it, officials have also launched an information\ncampaign among health-care workers to help them recognize the signs of\ninfection (most notably a splotchy rash accompanied with flu-like symptoms).\nPhase one of the program has gone pretty much as planned, though with a few\ncomplications. Probably the most surprising was the reluctance of many\nhealth-care workers to get the shots, which pushed back the deadline for\nthe first 15,000 from October to December. 'Part of it is a less than\nsatisfactory communications effort.

Those side effects can include high fever (which can\nhit 50 out of every million recipients of the vaccine), meningitis (15 per\nmillion), and even death (1 per million). The authorities pointed out,\nhowever, that most people who are affected in such ways are toddlers, the\nelderly, or those with weakened immune systems, none of whom would be given\nthe vaccine during the initial inoculation.\nSo far, only 4 Israelis have been hospitalized in the course of the\ninoculation: a spouse and child came down with a mild case of cowpox\n[vaccinia] -- from which on version of the smallpox vaccine is made -- and\ntwo people had heavy fevers. All are fine now. 'My best advice is\ninformation, information, information,' says Hadari.

It often\nproduces temporary fevers and sore, swollen arms. In a small but\nunpredictable number of cases, however, the vaccinia pox itself runs wild\nand leaves its victims scarred, blinded, or sometimes even dead.\nThe only tested antidote is vaccinia immune globulin (VIG), but until this\nmonth, the United States had only 600 to 700 doses. The antidote must be\nmade from the blood of people vaccinated in the last 2 months, while a\nflood tide of newly minted antibodies is coursing through their veins.\nUntil recently, there were only a handful of potential donors.\nRoutine smallpox vaccinations for children stopped in 1972, and the\nmilitary stopped in the late 1980s, so the only ones with current\nvaccinations were laboratory technicians working with the world's remaining\nstocks of smallpox or related viruses.\nNow, after hastily signing up two companies to make more, the US\ngovernment, which may vaccinate up to 500 000 health workers and 500 000\npeople in the military, is opening up this bottleneck a bit. By the year's\nend, the government should have about 5000 doses of VIG in hand.\nTheoretically, that would be enough to allow at least 40 million people to\nbe vaccinated. Making enough to vaccinate all 280 million Americans safely\ncould take 2 years, based on the most pessimistic estimates of need. But no\none knows exactly how much is needed because experts do not know how many\nbad reactions will occur or how effective efforts will be to screen out the\npeople most likely to have them -- pregnant women, people with compromised\nimmune systems, and people with a history of eczema or other rashes.\nIn 1968, two separate studies found one life threatening reaction per 67\n000 vaccinations and one per 20 000. But in 1968, far fewer Americans had\nimmune systems weakened by AIDS, cancer chemotherapy, or organ transplants,\nand eczema was less common.\nThe military's supplier said it was told to assume one serious reaction per\n8000 vaccinations. Asked about that, Dr Raymond A Strikas, an\nepidemiologist working on smallpox vaccination protocols for the Centers\nfor Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), said, 'Given the uncertainties\nhere, that may not be a bad estimate.'\nVIG is no miracle drug. It was invented in the 1950s and never tested in\nrigorous clinical studies. Case surveys from the 1960s suggest that it can\ncut deaths from severe vaccination eczema by two thirds and stop the spread\nof new sores. But it seemed to have no effect on vaccinia necrosum, in\nwhich tissue around the site dies in ever-enlarging circles. The condition,\nrare in the 1960s, can kill immunosuppressed people, whose numbers have\ngrown sharply. VIG also seemed not to help brain inflammation complications.\nBut the government wants more because 'you don't have anything else,' said\nDr Anthony S Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and\nInfectious Diseases. Dr Fauci said the government was investigating\ncidofovir, a drug licensed for use against another virus. But it would be\nreserved for the most severe cases if VIG failed. Cidofovir is toxic and\nuntested against vaccinia in humans.\nThe 2 companies that received rush VIG orders were the DynPort Vaccine\nCompany of Frederick, MD, which has a longstanding contract to supply\nvaccines for smallpox, botulism, plague, anthrax, and tularemia to the\nmilitary, and the Cangene Corporation of Winnipeg, Canada, which makes\nantibody products that protect babies with dangerous Rhesus mismatches,\npregnant women exposed to chickenpox, and people exposed to anthrax and\nhepatitis B.\nDynPort had a head start, and has not yet needed to recruit donors because\nit has a large stockpile of frozen plasma from soldiers vaccinated years\nago, said Dr David Smith, DynPort's principal scientist. The plasma is\ntested for HIV, hepatitis, and other pathogens, and is then 'fractionated'\nusing a combination of ethanol and salt concentrations to yield a few drops\nof antibodies, which are proteins. DynPort has produced enough VIG to treat\n660 severe reactions, Dr Smith said. Dr David Clanton, a DynPort senior\nscientist, said the company had tested its new antidote on volunteers and\nfound that even a dose 5 times as great as normal produced 'no adverse\neffects.'\nCangene, by contrast, has a bigger contract but a less urgent time frame.\nIt is to produce up to 100 000 doses for the United States civilian\npopulation over 5 years. Lacking a pool of frozen plasma, it is seeking\nabout 10 000 volunteers to be inoculated for smallpox and then bled twice a\nweek for 2 months. Plasma is spun off their blood and their red cells are\nreturned to them. The plasma goes to Winnipeg, where Cangene uses a newer\nchromatography process, pouring it through layers of beads that filter out\neverything but the antibodies. Other purification steps are added,\nincluding solvents that destroy the lipid shells of viruses like HIV or\nWest Nile virus.\nTo find all those donors, Cangene subcontracts several 'specialty plasma'\ncompanies. The Serologicals Corporation, a 32 year old company with\nheadquarters in Norcross, GA, is the biggest, with 13 clinics in 7 states\ndrawing blood from people 'stimulated' with injections to produce\nantibodies to rabies, hepatitis, mononucleosis, or herpes. So far, it has\nfound 1300 VIG donors through advertising and word of mouth. All donors\nmust have been vaccinated against smallpox as children, and have the scars\nas proof. They are screened for all diseases that disqualify blood donors,\nand for skin problems. No donors have yet had bad reactions, said Dr\nBarbara Slade, medical director of Serologicals. Each is paid $100 a week,\nbut 4 donors interviewed in Marietta said money was not a factor.\nBecause touching the vaccination site or the bandage can infect someone\nelse with the vaccinia virus, potential donors cannot live with anyone at\nhigh risk for complications -- anyone pregnant, under 1 year old, with\nunexplained rashes, or with a weakened immune system. The donors are given\nwaterproof bandages. To change them, they must wear latex gloves, bag them,\nand return them to the plasma center.\n[byline: Donald G McNeil Jr and Lawrence K Altman]\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[The inclusion of the VIG production manufacturers' names in this article\ndoes not carry a commercial endorsement of these companies on the part of\nProMED-mail.\nPrior ProMED-mail postings discussing the smallpox vaccination strategies\nin the USA and the known hazards of the vaccine (references below) have\npointed out the current shortage of vaccine immune globulin (VIG) that\nmight preclude the implementation of vaccination activities.

First, an individual was vaccinated, and as soon\nas the cowpox pustule had appeared on his or her arm, matter from the\nlesion was then used to vaccinate other recipients. In 1801 in St.\nPetersburg, Russia, for example, a recently vaccinated girl was sent to a\nlocal orphanage to serve as the source of smallpox vaccine for all children\nmore than a week old.

Such\nconsultations have been done informally, with the disease centers relying\non reports from doctors that were not collected in a standard way.\n'We are responding to criticism that we have not had comprehensive,\nstandard clinical evaluations' of adverse reactions to vaccines, Dr. Walter\nOrenstein, an official at the disease centers, said.\nThe monitoring system will help determine the frequency of complications\ncaused by the smallpox vaccine, the riskiest of all vaccines.\nThe network will also be used to determine who will get the scarce and\ndangerous drugs needed to treat complications of the smallpox vaccine, and\nwhen, said Dr. Gina Mootrey, another official at the centers, in announcing\nthe monitoring plan to a panel advising the government on smallpox\nvaccinations.\nOn Wednesday, the advisory panel recommended offering the immunization to\nan estimated half-million emergency room and other hospital workers because\nof the possibility of a bioterrorist attack.\nToday, the panel recommended that anyone with either of 2 common skin\nconditions -- eczema and atopic dermatitis -- not receive a smallpox\nvaccination. The exclusion also applies to anyone who has had either\ncondition in the past, even a mild case. Such individuals are at increased\nrisk of developing a severe and potentially fatal illness known as eczema\nvaccinatum.\nThe panel also recommended not giving smallpox vaccine to anyone who has a\nfamily or household member with either skin condition because the virus in\nthe vaccine could be transmitted to them.\nThe panel's chairman, Dr. John F. Modlin of Dartmouth Medical School, said\nthe criteria might exclude an estimated 7 percent to 17 percent of\nAmericans from receiving the vaccine.\nIndividuals infected by the AIDS virus and women who are pregnant, or who\nare trying to become pregnant, should also not be given the vaccine, the\npanel said.\nModern knowledge about the safety of the vaccine is limited because the\ngovernment stopped standard use of smallpox vaccine in 1972 as the disease\nwas being eradicated from the world.\nEarlier this year, researchers reported that 36.4 percent of volunteers in\na study missed school, work, or recreation or had difficulty sleeping after\nreceiving a dose of the smallpox vaccine that was used before smallpox was\ndeclared eradicated in 1980.\nIndividuals with severe reactions might be treated with either of 2 drugs.\nOne is vaccinia immune globulin, a drug that is derived from the blood of\nindividuals who have been immunized against smallpox, and is now in short\nsupply. The government owns the only stores.\nThe other is cidofovir, a drug that experts hope might be effective against\nvaccinia, the virus in the vaccine that protects against smallpox.\nCidofovir must be injected, is dangerous, and its only approved use is for\na different virus.\nAnother reason for instituting the monitoring system is to maintain\ncredibility and public confidence, Dr. Mootrey said. Last year during the\nanthrax attacks, the centers were widely criticized for failing to\ncommunicate pertinent information about anthrax in a timely manner to\nhealth officials, doctors and the public.\nThe monitoring system will require extensive cooperation from state and\nlocal health departments and hospitals to resolve a number of issues,\nincluding liability for the health professionals involved. The centers plan\nto start discussions with state and territorial health officials on Friday.\nMost experts at the meeting were cautiously optimistic about the plan.\nDr. Guthrie S. Birkhead, an official of the New York State Health\nDepartment, called the plan comprehensive but underscored the need for\nhealth officials and hospitals to immediately talk through the issues.\nDr. Kent Sepkowitz, an infectious disease expert at Memorial\nSloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan, complimented the center for\ndeveloping 'a good system,' but added that 'it will take months for it to\ngo right and that is a reason to go slowly at first.'\nUnder the monitoring system, each hospital worker will be given a personal\nidentification number at the time of vaccination.\nThe recipients will also receive a telephone hotline number to report any\npossible adverse effect like fever, a spreading rash or altered mental\nstatus caused by encephalitis.\nAn estimated 35 percent, or 175 000, of the recipients are expected to call\nthe hotline, where the staff will provide advice and refer those needing\nimmediate care to their doctors.\nOf these, about 17 500 are expected to need care from a designated local\nspecialist in dermatology, allergy, neurology, and infectious diseases. In\nturn, about 30 percent of this group will need referrals for more extensive\nconsultation with experts at designated hospitals around the country.\nThe experts are at Columbia-New York Presbyterian Hospital in Manhattan,\nBoston University, Johns Hopkins, the University of Maryland, the Northern\nCalifornia Kaiser Permanente hospital, Stanford University, and Vanderbilt\nUniversity.\nAbout 100 recipients are expected to need treatment with vaccinia immune\nglobulin, cidofovir, or both.\nThe disease centers plan to conduct a telephone survey involving 15 000 to\n20 000 vaccine recipients on the tenth and twenty-first days after vaccination.\n[Byline: Lawrence K.

Vaccinia virus is related to\nthe smallpox virus, but much less dangerous. The virus generally poses no\nrisk to healthy individuals but could be a problem for certain individuals,\nincluding those with weakened immune systems.\nBetween two to six unvaccinated people might contract the virus for every\n100,000 people immunized, according to a report in The Journal of the\nAmerican Medical Association Tuesday [see ProMED-mail posting Smallpox\nvaccine hazards (02) 20021015.5559 - Mod.MPP]\nACIP is recommending that healthcare workers involved in direct patient\ncare cover the vaccination site with absorbent material, such as gauze, and\n'at least a single layer of impermeable acoustic dressing,' until the scab\nseparates.\nHowever, the committee recommended against the need for healthcare workers\nto be placed on leave after receiving smallpox vaccination unless they\ndevelop symptoms from the vaccination or do not adhere to infection control\nprecautions.\n'Very close contact required for transmission of vaccinia to household\ncontacts is unlikely to occur in the healthcare setting,' Modlin stressed\nduring the briefing.\nACIP also recommends that healthcare workers with eczema, a type of\nallergic skin rash called atopic dermatitis, or other skin conditions avoid\nreceiving the smallpox vaccine.\nAccording to Modlin, about 2% to 5% of adults have eczema or atopic\ndermatitis, although when other skin conditions that could make the vaccine\nrisky are included, the vaccine may be contraindicated for up to 10% to 20%\nof people.\nPregnant healthcare workers, those with HIV/AIDS or other immunocompromised\nindividuals should not receive the vaccine, but neither routine pregnancy\ntesting nor mandatory HIV/AIDS testing is recommended. Female healthcare\nworkers should be counseled not to become pregnant for 4 weeks after\nvaccination and HIV testing should be offered, they suggest.\nSmallpox vaccine may be administered at the same time as any inactivated\nvaccine or live vaccine, with the exception of varicella (chickenpox),\naccording to ACIP.\nRegarding the risk to household contacts of healthcare workers, Dr. Walter\nOrenstein, director of CDC's National Immunization Program, told Reuters\nHealth that the same kinds of contraindications considered for those being\nvaccinated should be applied.\n'So, for example, if a healthcare worker has a child in the home with\neczema, then that worker should not be vaccinated,' Orenstein said.\nModlin pointed out that 'for the most part...organizations representing\nemergency room physicians, nursing staff and others have been very\nsupportive of the process and have participated and, more or less, agree\nwith the ACIP's actions.'\nAccording to Orenstein, the order in which healthcare workers will be\nvaccinated is still being worked out.\n[by: Emma Hitt, PhD]\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[ProMED-mail has been covering the debates and discussions related to a\nresumption of vaccination with smallpox vaccine in the USA.

Remembering the back\nof the envelope estimates proposed by Dr. Kemper et al Expected Adverse\nEvents in a Mass Smallpox Vaccination Campaign Effective Clinical Practice,\nMarch/April 2002 [URL below], they estimated that 25 percent of the\npopulation would be excluded from vaccination because of high risk or the\npossibility of coming in contact with a high-risk individual.\n<http://www.acponline.org/journals/ecp/marapr02/kemper.htm>\nWhile the plan does address the issue of vaccination of healthcare workers\ninvolved in active patient care, with requirements for an occlusive\nimpermeable dressing until the scab separates, one can't help but remain\nconcerned that the combination of a large pool of health care workers who\nwere born after smallpox vaccination was discontinued (and hence will be\nprimary vaccinees) combined with today's larger pool of high risk patients\n(with either acquired via infection or have iatrogenically acquired\nimmunosuppression) may be very risky.

They also mention that while there were no reports of\nprogressive vaccinia in contacts of vaccinees, these data came from the\n1960s when there were fewer immunosuppressed persons. Given today's\nenvironment, there may be a real need to exclude recently vaccinated health\ncare workers (especially those receiving a primary vaccination) from active\npatient care.\nIn the article by Neff JM et al, there was mention of a case of\ndisseminated vaccinia that occurred in an apparently healthy military\nrecruit (in 1984) who was later diagnosed as having HIV/AIDS. While we do\nnot know how many HIV infected persons were vaccinated before the military\nstopped using the vaccine, the prevalence of HIV infection was much lower\nin 1984 than it is today. This last finding raises concerns re:\nvaccination of healthcare workers without requiring HIV testing prior to\nvaccination.\nThe above plan as stated will hopefully provide a better data base on the\nrisks associated with smallpox vaccination in the current\nenvironment.

What this plan does not discuss is how the liability\nissues will be handled. Yes, there will be individuals with serious\ncomplications from receipt of the vaccine, or from contact with a recent\nvaccine recipient.

Fisher IV for also contributing this article.\n- Mod.MPP]\nVaccinated people can transmit vaccinia virus\nNew research on smallpox vaccinations\n-------------------\nExperts poring over data from past widespread smallpox vaccinations\nconclude the live virus used in the vaccine may result in cases of contact\nvaccinia -- the spreading of the vaccinia virus from someone recently\nvaccinated to someone who has not had the shot.\nVaccinia, a less virulent relative of smallpox, is the live virus used in\nsmallpox vaccinations. People with skin disorders like eczema can spread\nthe virus across their own skin and potentially infect others who aren't\nvaccinated. The vaccinia virus may cause a rash, fever, and head or body aches.\nThe researchers, led by Dr. John Neff, a former researcher with the Center\nfor Disease Control and Prevention's Smallpox Eradication Program,\ndiscussed what they found in a commentary in this week's Journal of the\nAmerican Medical Association released today.\nTheir research focused on mass vaccinations in the United States, United\nKingdom, and Sweden from 1947 to 1968. Overall, in the U.S. studies, the\nrate of contact vaccinia was in the range of 2 to 6 per 100 000 vaccinations.\nThe majority of such cases -\u00ad a few of which resulted in death -- occurred\nin children with eczema, a skin disorder characterized by itchy red skin\nand even blisters in severe cases. The disease was more likely to be spread\nto people with a history of eczema even though they had no active skin lesions.\nAge distribution of those U.S. cases shows young people are more vulnerable\nto contact vaccinia:\nYounger than 1 year: 25 cases\nOne to 4 years of age: 113 cases\nFive to 19 years of age: 40 cases\nTwenty years or older: 44 cases\nThat translates to 62 percent of the cases occurring in children 5 years\nold or younger and almost 20 percent in those 20 years or older, according\nto the study.\nMost cases happened in the home, with many victims getting the virus from\nvaccinated family members or playmates. In rare cases, transmission\noccurred from a vaccinated nurse to a patient.\n'The risk (of contact vaccinia) is not large,' the researchers write. 'This\nrisk needs to be kept in perspective.' But they do admit that in this day\nand age we're more susceptible than past generations. Why?\nSince widespread smallpox vaccinations stopped in 1972, almost everyone\nborn since then has no immunity to vaccinia, according to the authors. If\nvaccinated, this group could spread the virus for up to 19 days. Even those\nwho have had a smallpox shot in the past could shed more of the virus and\nfor a longer period of time depending on how long it's been since their\nlast vaccination and how many shots they've had in all. In short, most\npeople born before 1972 have had only one smallpox shot and they would\nprobably react as if they've never had one at all.\nEczema, also called atopic dermatitis, is more prevalent today. In the\nUnited States, rates have increased from 3 to 6 percent to 6 to 22 percent\nin the past 30 years, according to the researchers.\nToday there are more people with weak immune systems. The authors theorize\nthat's likely due to the spread of HIV and wider use of drugs to suppress\nthe immune system for cancer patients and organ transplant recipients, for\nexample. 'Contact vaccinia in this population could be especially serious,'\nthe authors write.\nPreparation and a carefully crafted vaccine policy is key to keeping\ncontact vaccinia under control should mass smallpox vaccinations become a\nreality, according to the commentary.\nThey recommend public health officials carefully screen for those with a\nhistory of eczema and compromised immune systems. The public should be\ninformed about how contact vaccinia is spread and how to avoid it. Finally,\na surveillance system needs to be in place to document and track adverse\nreactions to the vaccine.\n[Byline: Gina Hill]\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[This is a very interesting article addressing the observed rates of\ncontact vaccinia during the period of time when routine smallpox\nvaccinations were administered. It is a nice addition to the body of\nevidence for development of a smallpox vaccination strategy based on the\nconcept of 'data for decision making'. The article reference is:\nNeff JM, Lane JM, Fulginiti VA, Henderson DA. Transmission of Vaccinia\nVirus JAMA 16 Oct 2002 288 /15.\nThe data presented in the above newswire are from different studies that\nwere used as part of this review.

But the final decision rests with President Bush, and a White\nHouse spokesman said the issue was still under review.\nThe health officials, who included Dr Julie L Gerberding, director of the\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), outlined a strategy that\ncould go far beyond what they were considering just a few months ago, when\nthey were talking about offering the vaccine to 500 000 health care workers\nfacing the greatest risk of handling a smallpox case. 'Right now our\nthinking is in favor of making the vaccine available to the general public\nafter we have insured that we can adequately immunize health care\nprofessionals,' Dr Gerberding said. She cautioned that the officials were\nnot recommending that Americans take the vaccine, but rather that they have\nthe option of weighing the risks and benefits for themselves. 'No one\nbelieves we should make it available to the general public right now,' Dr\nGerberding said.\nAt a news conference, officials also announced that one million doses of\nsmallpox vaccine will be provided to the military. The recommendations were\npresented to President Bush by the secretary of health and human services,\nTommy G Thompson, the officials said. A spokesman for the White House today\ndeclined to discuss the issue. 'It is under review,' said Scott McClellan,\nthe president's deputy press secretary. 'There are still a number of issues\nthat need to be addressed before any final decision is made.'\nThe government halted routine vaccinations in 1972 as the disease was being\neradicated from the world. But the terrorism attacks last year and the\npossibility that Iraq or other hostile nations might have the virus have\ncaused health officials to consider a new battle against the disease.\nLast week, officials gave guidelines to the states on how to be prepared\npossibly to vaccinate the entire country in the event a case of smallpox\nappears. Today's briefing focused entirely on vaccinations before such a\ncase occurs. 'We are still in an environment where we have no imminent\nthreat,' Dr Gerberding said. 'But there are countries with weapons of mass\ndestruction that probably include smallpox.'\nSmallpox vaccine, which is made from a live virus related to the one that\ncauses smallpox, is considered the most dangerous immunization. The\ngovernment owns all American stocks of smallpox vaccine, and because none\nare licensed now, all are classified as 'investigational.' When the vaccine\nwas used, 'life-threatening complications' occurred at a rate of 15 per\nmillion among those who received their first smallpox vaccination, and the\nnumber included 1 or 2 deaths, said Dr Gerberding. The rates would be lower\namong those who were re-vaccinated, Dr Gerberding said. But, she added,\n'how much lower, we don't know.' The vaccine can also cause many\nnon-life-threatening complications such as blindness.\nBetween 30 million and 50 million Americans might be disqualified from\ngetting the vaccine because their immune systems have been weakened by\ncancer, AIDS, or other diseases, or because they have two common skin\nconditions, eczema and atopic dermatitis, which increase the risk of\ncomplications.\nThe comments from Dr Gerberding and other officials were made in what was\nmeant to be a background briefing on various aspects of smallpox. The\nparticipants often had to clarify confusion that they had created in their\nremarks. Much of the confusion centered on which people would get\nvaccinated. One option, the health officials said, is a plan whereby\nvaccinations would expand to a growing number of health and emergency\nworkers. Under one plan, health officials would start by offering\nvaccinations to about 500 000 workers who would be most at risk of\nencountering any smallpox cases in hospitals. Another option would be to\nconsider expanding the 500 000 vaccinations to all the nation's estimated\n10 million health care and emergency workers, said Jerome M Hauer, an\nassistant secretary of health and human services and director of the\ndepartment's Office of Public Health Preparedness. After that, and\nfollowing licensing of what health officials hope will be a safer smallpox\nvaccine, they would offer it to the public.\nIn interviews after the briefing, officials outlined how their thinking had\nevolved since June 2002, when a panel of outside experts recommended\nagainst vaccinating all Americans. The panel, known as the Advisory\nCommittee on Immunization Practices, rejected a proposal to offer smallpox\nvaccinations to the general public. It recommended limiting vaccinations to\nhealth care and emergency workers who were likely to be 'first responders'\nto a bioterror attack. The panel's chairman estimated 15 000 people would\nbe inoculated.\nIt fell to Mr Thompson's bioterrorism advisers, including Mr Hauer, Dr\nGerberding, and Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of\nAllergy and Infectious Diseases, to review the panel's report and then make\ntheir own recommendations. They began, Mr. Hauer said, by convening a\nseries of meetings with state health officials, doctors and hospital\nexecutives. Those meetings, he said, led them to decide that they should\npresent the president with options to expand vaccinations to all health\nprofessionals and law enforcement people, and eventually to all Americans\nwho want the vaccine. 'Our recommendation was that a phased approach be\nused, starting with 500 000 and then moving in steps to 10 million,' Mr\nHauer said. But if necessary, he added, the 10 million could be given in\none step.\nDr Gerberding said, in the absence of a smallpox attack, or the imminent\nthreat of one, she still felt the vaccine's benefits did not outweigh its\nrisks for the general public. But, she said: 'We recognize that individual\ncitizens feel that if they understand the risks and benefits of the\nvaccine, they may choose to have it.'\nAccording to another administration official, vice president Dick Cheney\nfavors a mass vaccination approach, while Mr Bush favors a more moderate\napproach.\n(byline: Lawrence K Altman and Sheryl Gay Stolberg)\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[The last ProMED-mail posting on the USA smallpox vaccination strategies\n(Smallpox vaccination strategies - USA (05) 20020924.5390 ) was a detailed\nanalysis of the vaccination strategy proposed for states in the event of\nintroduction of smallpox into the United States.

The first to be vaccinated\nwould include infectious disease specialists and emergency room personnel,\nincluding doctors, nurses, technicians, even security officers working at\nhospitals and clinics, according to officials familiar with the\nadministration's planning.\nThis first group probably will include more than 1 million people, one\nofficial said, although precise numbers won't be known until states are\ngiven guidelines and figure out how many people they cover.\nThe shots carry a risk of serious side effects, including death, so\nauthorities estimate that only about a third to a half of those offered\nvaccinations will take them. In the end, they believe that several hundred\nthousand -- maybe half a million -- will wind up getting the shots.\nOfficials cautioned that plans still could change. They expect to announce\na decision by the end of the month [September 2002].\nSmallpox hasn't been seen in this country in decades; routine vaccinations\nended in 1971. In 1980, the disease was declared eradicated from the globe,\nbut experts fear hostile nations or terrorist groups may acquire the virus\nand unleash it.\nThe plan on the table would vaccinate people in stages, based on risks they\nface.\nIn the second stage, shots would be offered to other health care workers,\nincluding those in private practice and others who work in hospitals but\nare not at direct risk, officials said. At some point, emergency personnel,\nsuch as police and firefighters, also would be offered the shots.\n'It's going to be a staged program where ultimately all health care workers\nwill be vaccinated,'' said one official involved in the planning, speaking\non condition of anonymity. Ultimately, the vaccine will be offered to the\ngeneral public, he said, adding: ``It will take years for that to happen.''\nIn addition, plans are being put into place to vaccinate the entire\npopulation immediately should that become necessary. Officials will\nevaluate side effects of the vaccine before moving to each new group, he added.\nFor federal officials -- including President Bush, who will have the final\nsay -- the challenge is balancing the risk of the vaccine, which is known,\nwith the risk that smallpox might return, which is not known. Top health\nofficials say they have to assume that would-be terrorists have the virus\nand might use it.\n'My gut tells me you have to assume the worst right now with\nbioterrorism,'' Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy Thompson said in\na recent interview.\nUsing similar logic, Sen. Bill Frist, R-Tenn., a leader on bioterrorism\nquestions, said last month [August 2002] that all Americans should be\nallowed to decide for themselves whether to get the vaccine.\nOthers argue that any specific person faces a very low risk of ever seeing\nthe disease but faces a certain risk from the shot. About one in 1000\npeople vaccinated will face complications, some serious, and the vaccine\nwill kill one or 2 out of every million people who get it.\nUsing this logic, in July a federal advisory committee recommended limited\nvaccinations. They recommended vaccinating small response teams for each\nstate and a few caregivers at designated hospitals -- probably 10,000 to\n20,000 altogether.\n'The likelihood of any one health care worker coming into contact with a\ncase of smallpox, even in the likelihood of an outbreak, would be\nexceedingly small,'' said John Modlin of Dartmouth Medical School, who\nchairs that committee.\nPeople can be vaccinated effectively against smallpox for several days\nafter they are exposed; so an urgent round of vaccinations would begin as\nsoon as a patient had been diagnosed.\nAs they plan for vaccinations, federal officials face a host of complex issues:\n--Recovery time. After vaccination, many are sick for several days. Will\nlarge numbers of hospital workers all be home sick at the same time? Who\npays for the lost hours?\n--Liability. If someone dies or gets very sick, who is liable? Thompson has\nsuggested the government would shoulder legal liability, as it does with\nother vaccines.\n--HIV/AIDS. People who have weakened immune systems, notably people with\nHIV, should not be vaccinated because they are at high risk for severe side\neffects. Not everyone who is HIV-positive knows of the condition. Should\npeople be tested for HIV before vaccination? Should it be mandatory? Who\nwould have access to the test results?\n--Administering the vaccine. Each vial has 500 doses because so little\nvaccine is needed for each person. Once the vial is opened, it lasts only\nfor about 2 weeks. Would people being vaccinated all have to come to the\nsame place?\nOnce the program is under way, the key will be frank communication of the\nrisks and benefits, said Dr. Michael Osterholm, a principal adviser to\nThompson. 'We all have to be as honest as we can be and put all the\ninformation on the table,'' he said.\nEven before the plan is announced, it has its critics. 'They want to be\nseen as being proactive in doing something, ''Modlin said in an\ninterview. 'This is a way they can visibly demonstrate the government is\nbeing proactive.''\nBut others, including Dr. Tara O'Toole, director of the Johns Hopkins\nCenter for Civilian Biodefense Strategies, say it strikes the right\nbalance.

Johan Neyts, Robert Snoeck and Erik De Clercq\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n[The following comments have been received from Drs. Neyts, Snoeck and De\nClercq regarding the ProMED-mail post 'Smallpox, cidofovir activity (02)'\nposted on Frid 30 23 Aug 2002].\nOur brief review on the activity of cidofovir was a reply to a ProMED\nmessage (Smallpox Vaccine Hazards 20020817.0580) in which concern was raised\nabout the possible complications of vaccination with vaccinia against\nsmallpox. From that particular message it appeared as if the status of\ncidofovir was at the present time nothing more than that of a compound that\nis active against 'mousepox,' and that no clinical efficacy of this compound\nhad ever been shown in the treatment of viral infections in man.\nWe do not claim that cidofovir is an established therapeutic modality for\nthe treatment of complications of vaccination with vaccinia (or for the\ntreatment of monkeypox or smallpox). The reality, however, is that cidofovir\nis currently the only drug that has shown very good activity against\ninfections by poxviruses in man. There is currently (with the exception of\nthe vaccinia immunoglobulin, which may not be all that effective) no\ntreatment available to treat severe and often lethal complications of\nsmallpox vaccination in the immunodeficient host.\nCidofovir is indeed nephrotoxic, but this toxicity is manageable [as it is,\nfor example, in children following long-term (8-month) treatment (Hoffman et\nal. 2001)]. Instructions on how to avoid nephrotoxicity have been formulated\nand the compound has been used since it was licensed in 1996 in many\npatients. We believe that it may be preferable -- in particular when\nvaccinia immunoglobulin would not be very effective -- to treat a patient\nwith a drug such as cidofovir (that indeed requires good hydration,\ncombination therapy with probenicid, and monitoring of renal functions)\nrather than to allow the vaccinia infection to progress and to result in a\npossible lethal outcome. Given the pharmacokinetics of cidofovir, treatment\nof complications from vaccination may not require more than one or 2\ninfusions. When given according to the recommendation for intravenous use of\ncidofovir, this should not result in nephrotoxicity.\nSo far cidofovir has been used successfully in the clinical setting for the\ntreatment of infections with viruses as diverse as herpes simplex virus\n(type 1 and type 2, wild type and drug-resistant), varicella-zoster virus\n(wild type and drug-resistant), Epstein Barr virus, cytomegalovirus,\nadenovirus, papillomavirus, polyomavirus, and, as already mentioned in our\nmessage (20020823.5116) molluscum contagiosum and ecthyma infectiosum (orf).\nA concern of Dr. Henderson is that cidofovir may not be active against\nalready established infections with poxviruses. As long as there are no\npatients with complications of vaccinia or patients with smallpox (and\nhopefully the situation will not change) we will of course not know. There\nis however a large amount of evidence (i) from animal models that the\ncompound is effective when treatment is initiated several days after\ninfection and also (ii) that the compound is effective against established\ninfections with other poxvirus infections (molluscum contagiosum and orf) in\npatients.\nAnimal studies\n---------------\n1. In the first report on the vivo activity of cidofovir against poxvirus\ninfections [Neyts J, De Clercq E. Efficacy of\n(S)-1-(3-hydroxy-2-phosphonylmethoxypropyl)cytosine for the treatment of\nlethal vaccinia virus infections in severe combined immune deficiency (SCID)\nmice. J Med Virol. 1993 Nov;41(3):242-6.], cidofovir caused a very marked\n(and significant) delay in vaccinia virus-induced mortality in SCID mice\nwhen treatment was first initiated at day 2, 4, or 6 post infection\n[untreated animals died already at 12 days post infection]. At the time that\ntreatment was initiated a high virus titer was already detected in several\norgans (lungs, kidney, liver, and brain) of untreated animals.\n2. In a study by Smee and Sidwell [Smee DF, Bailey KW, Wong M, Sidwell RW.\nIntranasal treatment of cowpox virus respiratory infections in mice with\ncidofovir. Antiviral Res. 2000 Sep;47(3):171-7.] a single treatment with\ncidofovir at day 2 post infection resulted in 95 percent protection, start\nof treatment at day 3 post infection in 85 percent protection, and start of\ntreatment at day 4 post infection in 60 percent survival, when a single dose\nof 40 mg/kg was given. In a more recent study by Smee [Smee DF, Sidwell RW,\nKefauver D, Bray M, Huggins JW. Characterization of wild-type and\ncidofovir-resistant strains of camelpox,cowpox, monkeypox, and vaccinia\nviruses. Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2002 May;46(5):1329-35.] a single\ntreatment given as late as 4 days after infection proved 80 percent\nprotective. (3) In a study by Bray and Huggins [Bray M, Martinez M, Smee DF,\nKefauver D, Thompson E, Huggins JW. Cidofovir protects mice against lethal\naerosol or intranasal cowpox virus challenge. J Infect Dis. 2000 Jan; 181\n(1):10-9.] one inoculation of 100 mg/kg cidofovir given on day 0, 2, or 4,\nwith respect to aerosol infection with cowpox, resulted in 90-100 percent\nsurvival. The compound was also shown to be prophylactic. One inoculation of\n100 mg/kg on day -6 to -2 protected 80-100 percent of the infected animals;\none inoculation on day -16 to -8 was partially protective.\nHuman studies\n---------------\nDr. D.A. Henderson is correct that there are, as yet, no published data that\ndemonstrate that cidofovir is, or would be, effective in treating a\ncutaneous vaccinial infection. To the best of our knowledge, no patient has\nindeed ever been treated for this condition. The reason for this is that\nsince the time that cidofovir has been licensed, very few people have been\nvaccinated with the smallpox vaccine.\nCidofovir is very effective (given intravenously or topically) in the\ntreatment of patients with severe established molluscum contagiosum. Many\npatients have now been treated (including children), and the results are\noften spectacular. Cidofovir was also very effective in the treatment of an\norf (sheep pox) lesion in an immunodeficient patient (in this case the\ncompound was given topically). We have recently seen a second case (patient\nof Dr. R. Snoeck) of an even more severe orf. This lesion disappeared\ncompletely following treatment with cidovir. These lesions are thus\nestablished infections with a poxvirus in the skin of patients that all\nresponded very well to cidofovir. The fact that vaccinia is in cell culture,\nand in animal models, very much susceptible to cidofovir, taken together\nwith these clinical data, in our opinion, constitutes evidence that\ncidofovir may also be effective in the treatment of other poxvirus\ninfections in man such as complications of vaccination.\nAnother concern has been the predictive value of mouse studies. We agree\nthat it is of the utmost importance to evaluate further the efficacy of\ncidofovir in the treatment of several poxvirus infections in other animal\nmodels (monkeys, cows, rabbits.). Cidofovir would, however, never have been\ntried, and found to be effective, in the treatment of molluscum and orf in\npatients if activity in mice had not been demonstrated. The activity of\ncidofovir in the mouse models was thus certainly predictive of the efficacy\nof the compound in humans against molluscum and orf.\nGiven\n(i) the efficacy of cidofovir against vaccinia (and other poxvirus\ninfections) in animal models and\n(ii) the proven efficacy of cidofovir against other poxviruses (molluscum\nand orf) in man, under conditions where no prohibitive toxic side effects\nwere observed (also following intravenous administration of the compound),\n(iii) and the fact that the nephrotoxicity of cidofovir is very well\nmanageable (even in children following long-term therapy);\nit may be advisable to consider the use of cidofovir in the treatment of\npatients with complications of smallpox vaccination, should these occur.\n--\nJohan Neyts, Robert Snoeck and Erik De Clercq\nRega Institute for Medical Research\nLeuven, Belgium\n<Johan.Neyts@rega.kuleuven.ac.be>\n[A comprehensive list of 33 references is available directly from the\ncorrespondents listed above.\nThe bottom line is that cidofovir, in its present formulation, may be useful\nin certain cases where the patient can be monitored over a prolonged period\nfor renal complications, but is impractical in epidemic situations for those\nsame reasons.

A report by US researchers has cast doubts\nover how effective the UK supplies would be in the event of a smallpox\nattack by terrorists. [UK] Health ministers decided in April [2002] to\npurchase enough vaccine to protect up to 20 million Britons from smallpox in\nthe event of a terrorist attack. The contract was awarded to Powderject\nPharmaceuticals, controversially without a public competition. That decision\nwas widely criticised after it emerged that Powderject chief executive Paul\nDrayson had donated GBP 50 000 to the Labour Party just weeks before.\nBut now a report by the Potomac Institute in the US suggests ministers may\nhave opted for the wrong type of vaccine. There are a number of different\ntypes of vaccines, and all were used by the World Health Organisation to\neradicate smallpox around the world by 1979. The UK government has opted for\nthe so-called Lister strain vaccine. This has been used extensively in the\nUK since the 1950s. However, authorities in the US have decided to stockpile\nanother type of smallpox vaccine. Their version, developed by the New York\n[State] Health Department, has been shown to be effective in fighting\nsmallpox in India. Authorities believe that if terrorists were to launch a\nsmallpox attack, they would use a similar strain of the disease. As a\nresult, the US researchers suggested the UK had bought the wrong type of\nvaccine.\nSteve Prior, a senior scientist at the Potomac Institute, told The Times\nnewspaper that there was no evidence to back up the government's decision,\ndescribing it as indefensible. But a Department of Health spokeswoman said:\n'The decision to purchase Lister strain was based on expert scientific and\nmedical advice available to the Department of Health, including the Ministry\nof Defence, with whom we are collaborating.' She added: 'Lister strain is\nalso the strain chosen by our European partners.' Professor John Oxford of\nQueen Mary's School of Medicine said there was no evidence to suggest one\nvaccine was better than another.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promedmail@promedmail.org}\n[Criticsm of the choice of vaccine by the UK Government, the political\ndimension apart, is misguided.

This argument overlooks the fact that all vaccine strains\nare derived from vaccinia virus, a different virus which does not itself\nproduce smallpox disease but does induce cross-protective immunity to\nvariola virus infection.

The vaccination plan would be activated only if an\noutbreak of the deadly disease occurred, an event administration officials\ncharacterize as unlikely but not impossible.\n'This is a very detailed, thoughtful recipe for response,' said Michael\nOsterholm, a public health expert at the University of Minnesota who is\nadvising the federal government. Using the template, states and cities\nshould be able to devise plans 'for vaccinating the largest amount of\npeople in the shortest time possible,' he said.\nSmallpox has not been seen in the United States for decades, and the\ndisease was declared eradicated worldwide in 1980. Still, it is perhaps the\nmost feared biological weapon because it is contagious, often incurable and\ncan kill at least one-third of its victims. Since routine vaccination was\nhalted in this country in 1971, there is little immunity left in the\npopulation and little expertise in dealing with the disease or vaccine.\nOnly the United States and Russia are known to possess stocks of the virus,\nbut security experts fear a hostile nation such as Iraq may have acquired a\ncache of the virus. Vice President Dick Cheney has contended the risk of\nattack may necessitate inoculating every American as a protective measure.\n'One of the real concerns about Saddam Hussein, as well, is his biological\nweapons capability,' he said recently on NBC's 'Meet the Press.' 'The fact\n[is] that he may, at some point, try to use smallpox, anthrax, plague, some\nother kind of biological agent against other nations, possibly including\neven the United States.'\nTwo-track goal\nTen months ago, Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy Thompson signed a\n$428 million contract to buy a dose of vaccine for every American.\nProduction is under way, and the United States already has stockpiled\nnearly 100 million doses.\nFederal experts since have been working furiously on 2 tracks: a\nvaccination program for the emergency medical workers most likely to see an\ninitial case of smallpox and a mass vaccination plan if an attack occurs,\nsaid Julie Gerberding, director of the federal Centers for Disease Control\nand Prevention in Atlanta.\n'We have to be able to do both,' she said in a recent interview.\nPre-vaccination, as it is known in public health, would be targeted to\nmedical personnel, who could respond to an attack knowing they are\nprotected. Plans are under way to begin vaccinating tens of thousands of\n'first responders,' perhaps by the end of this year.\nThere have been no plans to make the vaccine available to the public in the\nabsence of any cases. But officials have been debating what would be the\nbest response to an outbreak. Last winter, the CDC released a blueprint for\ncontaining a smallpox outbreak based on the 'ring vaccination' strategy\nused during the campaign to eradicate the disease. Ring vaccination\ninvolves starting with the people closest to an exposure and working out in\nconcentric circles.\nThere is growing recognition, however, that although that approach worked\nwell for a naturally occurring outbreak during a time when air travel was\nrare, it would be no match for a terrorist with the ability to release the\nvirus in several locations simultaneously, said Jerome Hauer, acting\nassistant secretary for HHS' Public Health Emergency Preparedness.\n'You begin with ring vaccination, but in a big outbreak obviously mass\nvaccination would be part of the plan,' he said. Federal officials are\nrequiring states to develop plans for vaccination within 5 days, he said,\nbecause it is widely believed that even if a person has been exposed to the\nvirus, a vaccine given in that time frame will provide immunity.\nAdministration officials refused to release the manual until state health\ncommissioners receive it. But in interviews with The Washington Post,\nseveral described the scenario for responding to a smallpox attack.\nStates to take over\nAt the first hint of a smallpox case, the CDC would begin dispatching\nemergency teams to the area to confirm the outbreak and begin vaccination.\nYet the suspicion that terrorists would strike more than one location\n'would require us to be in many, many places simultaneously,' one federal\nplanner said. 'That would completely deplete our assets.'\nInstead of sending its staff to every corner of the country, the CDC plans\nto ship the vaccine and let states handle inoculation, Osterholm said. The\nNational Pharmaceutical Stockpile, he said, 'can be at any hamlet in this\ncountry in 12 hours.' Officials have not said how much it would cost or how\nit would be paid for.\nHHS has received assurance that even if air traffic were halted, as it was\nimmediately after the Sept. 11 attacks, planes transporting vaccine would\nhave clearance. Vaccine would be delivered in waves much the way a grocery\nstore receives its weekly shipment of milk in batches.\nThe manual, which is almost 100 pages, was developed in consultation with\nlocal health officers, medical societies, the military and businesses such\nas UPS and Federal Express that have logistical expertise, said an adviser\nto Thompson. Much of its contents were based on previous large-scale\nvaccination programs, such as the 1995 meningitis outbreak in Mankato,\nMinn., in which 26,000 people were inoculated in four days.\nEach state must determine where vaccination clinics would be located, who\nwould staff them, how to counsel people on the potential risks of\nvaccination and most importantly, how to move hundreds of thousands of\npeople through the process calmly and quickly. Some communities might\nselect large shopping malls or sports arenas because of parking\navailability; metropolitan centers might rely on buses and subways to bring\npeople to clinics.\nEvery state will need provisions for everything from inclement weather to\nthe person who faints at the sight of a needle, Osterholm said. 'Are you\ngoing to have a line stretching 2 1/2 blocks in the snow or blistering\nheat?' he said, describing one challenge.\nThe guidelines urge states to address the need for bathrooms,\ntransportation, a media strategy and a medical questionnaire, as well as\nhow to separate and treat any potential smallpox cases. They also include\nsample consent forms if states must administer an unlicensed vaccine. Two\nadministration sources said they hope the vaccine soon will be re-licensed.\nAlthough bioterrorism is a new challenge, large vaccination campaigns are\nnot, Osterholm said. 'The public health system delivers vaccine to our\nnation's children every day, overcoming language, transportation and\nfinancial hurdles,' he noted.\nAside from an assumption that some health care workers will be vaccinated\nbefore an attack, the document does not resolve enormous questions\nsurrounding that issue.\nLast month, Thompson sent recommendations to the White House on how many\npeople should be inoculated in advance. Although a CDC advisory panel has\nrecommended vaccinating about 20,000 medical personnel, several\nadministration sources said President Bush is weighing a proposal on the\norder of 500,000 people.\n'Until a decision is made on pre-vaccination,' Hauer said, 'our efforts\ncontinue to focus on bioterrorism detection and response.'\n[By: Ceci Connolly - Washington Post]\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>", "summary": "A ProMED-mail post\n<http://www.promedmail.org>\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\n<http://www.isid.org>\n Federal experts since have been working furiously on 2 tracks: a\nvaccination program for the emergency medical workers most likely to see an\ninitial case of smallpox and a mass vaccination plan if an attack occurs,\nsaid Julie Gerberding, director of the federal Centers for Disease Control\nand Prevention in Atlanta.

They are weighing\nthe risks of vaccinating large numbers of people with a vaccine that is\nrelatively dangerous, versus the theoretical but serious danger of a\nbiological attack. They also worry that legal action may result if people\ndevelop complications as a result of smallpox vaccinations. 'The threat of\nsmallpox is small, but it's not zero,' said Dr. Donald Henderson, a chief\nadviser to the federal government on bioterrorism. 'If indeed smallpox were\nto be released, it would be very serious...potentially a global catastrophe.'\nThere is no question of vaccinating the general population. Rather, health\nexperts are trying to decide whether emergency department workers,\nfirefighters and others who may have to help in case of an attack or\noutbreak should get immunizations. And if so, the question is how many of\nthem, and where, and whether family members should also be vaccinated. Then\nthe government is dealing with the question of what kind of action to take\nshould there be an outbreak. 'We will have a policy in days, or 2 weeks at\nthe most,' Henderson told a briefing for legislative and other staff\nsponsored by the Alliance for Health Reform, a nonprofit group that runs\nforums on health policy.\nSmallpox was declared eradicated worldwide in 1980 and routine vaccination\nstopped in the United States in 1972. Most, if not all, of the population is\nconsidered vulnerable. The former Soviet Union is known to have experimented\nwith smallpox as a potential biological weapon, and the fear is that\nextremists or even governments may be planning to use it. Smallpox covers\nits victims with pustules and one third of patients die. It is a prime\ncandidate for use as a biological weapon. The Health and Human Services\nDepartment and the White House are considering recommendations made by\nexperts who were studying the issue even before the September 11 attacks and\nthe anthrax-laced letters in October that killed 5 people in the US. But it\ntakes years to develop a new vaccine and the United States is stuck with 77\nmillion doses of the old DryVax vaccine and 75 million doses of vaccine that\nmaker Aventis Pasteur had in its freezers and donated. By the end of the\nyear, 209 million more doses based on the old formula but made under cleaner\nlaboratory conditions should be available. But it may not be any safer.\n'Smallpox vaccine is probably the least safe human vaccine,' Dr. Anthony\nFauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,\ntold the briefing. Complications include a skin infection called eczema\nvaccinatum. People with eczema who touch a recently vaccinated person can\ndevelop this potentially fatal complication. HIV infections, cancer\ntreatments that can suppress the immune system, and people with transplanted\norgans all are more susceptible to complications from smallpox vaccines.\nThat raises the question of lawsuits, and Henderson said his team is\nthinking seriously about that. 'To me, it looks like this is going to be a\ngreat place for a trial lawyer to go to make a lot of money,' Tennessee\nRepublican Senator Bill Frist, a doctor, told the briefing.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>", "summary": "A ProMED-mail post\n<http://www.promedmail.org>\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\n<http://www.isid.org>\n But it\ntakes years to develop a new vaccine and the United States is stuck with 77\nmillion doses of the old DryVax vaccine and 75 million doses of vaccine that\nmaker Aventis Pasteur had in its freezers and donated.

That is in part\nbecause even a single case could be a harbinger of a larger outbreak and in\npart because even one case would undoubtedly spark panic and a clamor for\nvaccine.\n'We want to step up preparedness,' Julie Gerberding, the director of the\nCDC, said in an interview. 'If there is actually exposure and risk, we want\nto be able to vaccinate quickly. If there is anxiety, we also want to do it\nquickly.'\nBut the new guidance for states is far from encyclopedic, and experts\ncomplained that the center's 48-page document failed to answer questions\nabout the timing, cost, and logistical hurdles of preparing thousands of\nhealth professionals and volunteers to conduct mass vaccinations while\nkeeping the public calm. Critics said a superficial plan could sap public\nconfidence, worsening the effects of a smallpox crisis.\n'It's putting a lot of responsibility in a short time on local clinics,\nwhich will be untested,' said Caroline B. Hall, a professor of infectious\ndiseases at the University of Rochester's School of Medicine. 'The quilt is\nonly as good as the stitches. One tiny thread breaks, and the whole thing\nunravels.'\nSmallpox, which was eradicated worldwide 2 decades ago, is highly\ncontagious and kills roughly a third of its victims, making it a\npotentially fearsome biological weapon. Officially, the virus is supposed\nto exist only in repositories in Moscow and the CDC's headquarters in\nAtlanta, but experts have long suspected that some nations harbor secret\nstocks of smallpox to use as a biological weapon.\nToday's release of the 'Smallpox Vaccination Clinic Guide' comes as the\nUnited States is mobilizing for a possible attack on one of those nations,\nIraq. Dr. Gerberding described this as 'an unfortunate coincidence of\ntiming,' and said the guide was simply an update of a preparedness plan\nfirst issued 2 years ago, before the attacks on New York and the Pentagon\nand the subsequent anthrax attacks.\nBioterrorism experts said the administration's timing could not be ignored.\n'They know the best time for Saddam to hit us, if he has the smallpox\nweapon, would be before we go in so he can terrify the American people,'\nsaid an adviser to the Bush administration on smallpox policy. 'In that\ncase, it is definitely good to have these guidelines out there.'\nThe plan does not specify what kind of attack would spur a mass vaccination\ncampaign, or who would make the decision to initiate one. Agency officials\nsaid that absent a declaration of a national emergency by the president\nthey would make the decision in consultation with state health officials.\nThe vaccine is one of the few that can work even if a person is already\ninfected, and experts say it can protect people if given within 4 days of\nexposure to the virus. The guide says up to 75 million doses of the\nnation's vaccine stockpile could be shipped in a single day and 280 million\ndoses, enough to cover every American, in 5 to 7 days.\nThe guidelines call for states to run 20 clinics 16 hours a day, an effort\nthat the government estimates would require 4680 public health workers and\nvolunteers. Depending on the size and severity of the outbreak and where it\nis, the guidelines said more or fewer participating clinics could be\nneeded. In state capitols around the country, health commissioners said\nthey welcomed the advice but fretted about whether they would be able to\ncarry it out.\nIn Maryland, Dr. Georges Benjamin, secretary of the Department of Health\nand Mental Hygiene, said he had already told his staff to integrate the\ndocument into the existing bioterrorism preparedness plan.\n'What is astounding is the number of people it would take to actually make\nthis thing happen,' Dr. Benjamin said. Asked if he could conduct a mass\nvaccination right away, he said, 'We would do what we had to do, but it\nwould be tough. I would hate to try to do this tomorrow.'\nThere is no set timetable by which states must comply, Dr. Gerberding said,\nadding that the disease control agency hoped that states would conduct\npreparedness exercises as they develop their own plans.\nReplete with flowcharts and checklists, the center's guide covers things\nlike how many security officers would be needed for each clinic to contain\nan unruly crowd (2 per clinic per day) and how many minutes it would take\npeople to fill out the medical history screening forms (2 to 3).\nIt deals with how clinics should handle people who refuse to be vaccinated\nand reminds states that they must plan for huge numbers of fatalities.\n'Plan for vaccinating mortuary personnel and their families,' the guide says.\nBut the plan does not address the vexing, and politically delicate, issue\nof whether to vaccinate public health workers and emergency personnel\nbefore a terrorist attack. The White House is weighing whether to permit\nsuch vaccinations. Tommy G. Thompson, the secretary of health and human\nservices, has said a decision is expected by the end of this month.\nMany public health experts say the precautionary vaccinations are\nnecessary. 'These people need to be protected,' said Dr. Mohammed Akhter,\nthe executive director of the American Public Health Association. 'If we do\nnot do that, and we just go to this plan, then these workers will be\nstanding in line to get their vaccination rather than helping us' vaccinate\nothers.\nBut the issue is complicated because the vaccine, made from a live virus,\ncarries risks to patients with skin disorders and immune system\ndeficiencies, including people with AIDS. And those who are vulnerable are\nendangered not only by being inoculated, but also by contact with others\nwho have been inoculated.\n'It's very hard to say without a clear threat who should and who shouldn't\nbe vaccinated,' said Tara O'Toole, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for\nCivilian Biodefense Strategies. 'Some analyses suggest that if you have\never had eczema or live with someone who has, you shouldn't get vaccinated,\nand by some estimates that eliminates 30 million Americans.'\nDr. O'Toole said she thought the plan 'makes great good sense,' because it\nassumes that the nation must be ready to vaccinate a large number of people\non short notice.\nThe center's previous smallpox preparedness plan revolved around a strategy\nin which public health workers would track down and vaccinate infected\npeople and those who came into contact with them, working in concentric\ncircles until the outbreak was contained.\nThe new document does not supplant the 'ring vaccination' plan, Dr.\nGerberding said. But Dr. Bill Bicknell, a professor of international health\nat Boston University critical of that strategy, said the guide was\nundoubtedly influenced by recent studies showing that ring vaccination\nwould not contain a large outbreak. He said studies had found that if 1000\npeople were infected in a large city like New York and ring vaccination\nwere used, within 3 months there would be 300 000 cases of smallpox and 100\n000 deaths, and the epidemic would not be contained. But mass vaccination,\nhe said, would contain such an epidemic in 40 to 45 days, with 1500 cases\nand 500 deaths.\n'If they do it correctly, with the proper planning, you can vaccinate\nmillions and millions of people in a very short time,' Dr. Bicknell said.\nAnd he noted that until recently, a mass vaccination policy would have been\nimplausible, because the nation did not have a big enough vaccine stockpile\nto carry it out. Federal officials began building a smallpox vaccine\nstockpile after last year's anthrax attacks. Mr. Thompson, the health\nsecretary, signed contracts with two companies to buy 209 million doses to\nadd to the existing stockpile of vaccine, some of which dates to the\n1950's. In the interim, studies have shown that the existing stockpile\ncould be diluted.\nGovernment officials have offered differing assessments of whether there is\nnow enough vaccine for every American.

But\nexperts questioned the plan's depth, breadth, and realism, warning that\nsuperficiality can sap public confidence and, in a crisis, widen a health\ncalamity.\nDr. Mohammed Akhter, executive director of the American Public Health\nAssociation, called the plan good but questioned its feasibility. 'This is\na huge and massive undertaking, the likes of which we've never seen in our\nhistory,' Dr. Akhter said. If a smallpox attack came tonight, he added,\n'There's no way the state and local health departments would be able to\nimplement the plan.'\nJonathan B. Tucker, a germ-weapons expert in Washington and author of\n'Scourge,' a book on the smallpox threat, said public confidence in the\nplan was crucial for its success but judged the guidelines and their\nexplanation by federal officials wanting. 'A real potential problem is how\nyou ensure that a vaccination process is orderly and people don't panic,'\nMr. Tucker said. 'What we saw last fall with the anthrax attacks, which\nwere much less threatening than a smallpox outbreak would be, was public\nhysteria. In the context of a vaccination campaign, that would be very\nproblematic.'\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta has reassured the\npublic that federal officials are ready to respond. Dr. Julie Gerberding,\ndirector of the centers, gave a wholehearted 'yes' when asked if the agency\nwas prepared to handle deadly germ attacks.\n'CDC's level of preparedness is very high,' she said in a recent statement.\n'We have the plans, the policies, the people, the products, and now we have\nthe practice to make sure we are ready to respond.'\nIn theory, during a deadly outbreak, mass smallpox vaccinations can protect\nmany people: the vaccine is one of the few immunizations that can work even\nif a person is already infected. The vaccine can fully protect people if\ngiven within 4 days of exposure to the virus.\nThe new plan addresses only the most comprehensive response to an outbreak\nof the contagious disease, which kills about one in 3 victims. It does not\naddress giving vaccinations to anyone before an attack or an outbreak, only\nafterward.\nWhile the new plan gives a blueprint for how to carry out mass\nvaccinations, it says nothing about other precautions that, Dr. Gerberding\nsaid in an interview, would continue to be the first line of defense. For\ninstance, it is federal policy for health workers first to isolate infected\npatients and vaccinate people in close contact with them, forming a series\nof rings of immunization around an outbreak and barriers to its spread.\nFederal officials said the smallpox plan, [the agency's] third revision\nsince November 2001, was not a new policy but simply a set of detailed\nrecommendations for states on how to respond to a worst-case attack.\nDr. Mack Sewell, New Mexico's state epidemiologist, said achieving that\nlevel of readiness 'is a matter of time, attention and resources,' all of\nwhich are uncertain at this point.\nEarlier this summer, federal officials said they would recommend\n'preattack' vaccination for up to 500 000 emergency workers, but state\nofficials complain that they have received little or no guidance on the\ncritical question of how much vaccine will be made available, and when, or\nwho will have to be immunized ahead of time so they can carry out the mass\nvaccinations.\n'They've really been bobbing and weaving on this,' said Gary L. Simpson,\ndirector of the New Mexico infectious disease bureau. 'We've looked at\nnumbers that range from 500 up to 50 000 people, and that's just in New\nMexico.'\nFederal officials said a plan for vaccinating emergency health care\nworkers, after repeated delays, was to be made public by month's end.\nDr. Tucker, a germ-weapons expert in the Washington office of the Monterey\nInstitute of International Studies, said the plan was haunted by\nuncertainties over whether the states had the financial wherewithal and the\nraw organizational skills to carry out mass vaccination quickly. Even\nthough the federal government has given the states $918 million to build\nbioterror defenses, that may not be enough, Dr. Tucker said.\n'These plans have to be exercised under realistic scenarios to make sure\nthey would actually work in a crisis,' he said.\nDr. Tucker added that good public communication, vital to the plan's\nsuccess, seemed to be an afterthought. 'It's very unclear whether CDC or\nthe states are developing the necessary communication strategy to prevent\npanic in the event of an outbreak,' he said.\nThe centers' briefing yesterday on the plan, Dr. Tucker added, was\nstrikingly lackluster. 'It was very bureaucratic and full of jargon, so\neven when they were speaking to reporters they were not speaking in plain\nlanguage,' he said. 'If they're going to communicate with the public,\nthey're going to have to do it in a simpler, more direct way.'\nThe plan says nothing about how ready the federal government is to\ndistribute the rare vaccine to the states. For security reasons, much of\nthat information is kept secret to deny terrorists details that might let\nthem cripple defenses and make smallpox attacks more effective.\nFederal officials assert that they can transport vaccine anywhere they need\nin a matter of hours, not days. But it is unclear where it is stored and\nhow quickly it can in fact be distributed. The general goal is to be ready\nto vaccinate every American by the end of this year.\nAcambis, a company in Cambridge, England, is making 209 million doses of\nthe vaccine for the federal government but says it is barred from giving\nout all but sketchy details of its progress. Last week, Acambis said it had\nproduced the first smallpox vaccination kits for the federal stockpile but\nwould not say how many were available. Each kit contains the dry vaccine,\nfluid for its dilution, needles for its administration and forms to inform\nthe patient of its status as an investigational new drug.\nDr. Akhter, of the public health group, said an even bigger unknown was who\nin Washington would make the decision to begin mass vaccinations and how\nthat decision would be communicated. 'This would be a national emergency,'\nhe said. 'Someone at the national level has to be designated to flip the\nswitch.'\n[Byline: William J.

But now, faced with\nthe possibility of a terrorist attack, the federal Centers for Disease\nControl and Prevention have adopted guidelines for a mass vaccination in\nthe event of an outbreak.\nThe vaccine carries some risk of serious complications. But the CDC says\nanyone who has definitely been exposed to the virus should be vaccinated.\nFor those not yet exposed, or uncertain whether they were exposed, the\npicture would be more complicated. Following are questions and answers\nabout the government's plan.\nTHE RISKS\nWhat are the complications? In the 1960's the rates of severe side effects\nwere about 12 cases of encephalitis and 39 cases of severe eczema per\nmillion vaccinations. The death rate from complications was about 1 per\nmillion. Milder but more common side effects include fever, sore arms, and\nswollen lymph nodes.\nWhat if I've already been vaccinated? It is not known how long a childhood\nvaccination will protect an adult, so the CDC recommends vaccination for\nanyone who has definitely been exposed to the virus, regardless of age or\nmedical condition.\nShould anyone avoid vaccination? Health officials say some people should\navoid the vaccine unless it is certain they have been exposed to smallpox.\nChildren younger than 1: Infants have a greater risk of complications from\nthe vaccine. About 42 children out of a million will experience brain\nswelling, which can lead to retardation or death. Small children are also\nmore likely to touch their vaccination sore and then their eyes or mouth,\ncausing new sores.\nPregnant women: The risk from smallpox vaccine to the fetus is relatively\nsmall, but health officials recommend that pregnant women who have not been\nexposed to smallpox wait until after childbirth. If they have been exposed,\nvaccination is recommended.\nPeople with weakened immune systems: When smallpox was declared eradicated\nin 1980, little was known about immune-system problems, but experience with\nother serious infections suggests that such people will be more vulnerable,\nboth to smallpox itself and to severe side effects from the vaccine.\nThe C.D.C. says those who have not been exposed to smallpox ''should think\nabout not being vaccinated or waiting to be vaccinated until you have\ncompleted any treatments that affect your immune system function.' The\nwaiting period can be as long as 3 months.\nPeople with skin conditions Vaccination creates a high risk for a severe\nskin condition called eczema vaccinatum, which has been compared to\nthird-degree burns all over the body. People with a history of eczema\nshould not be vaccinated unless they know they have been exposed to\nsmallpox. Those with allergic reactions, severe burns, impetigo, and\nchicken pox should wait until the condition clears up.\nWhat precautions follow vaccination? The vaccinia virus in the vaccine is a\ncousin of the smallpox virus. Studies suggest that those who have been\nvaccinated rarely transmit it to anyone else. But they should not let\nanyone -- especially children -- touch the vaccination spot until it has\nhealed and the scab has fallen off.\nHow are complications treated? The 2 treatments that exist for severe side\neffects are: vaccinia immune globulin, which is derived from the blood of\ndonors vaccinated with smallpox vaccine, and cidofovir, an antiviral drug\nmarketed as Vistide. At the moment, there is only enough globulin for about\n600 patients, the number of serious complications expected from vaccinating\n5 million people. More is being produced.\nTHE GOVERNMENT'S PLAN\nWhat would happen first? The CDC is playing down the possibility of a\nmassive rush to vaccinate and anticipates providing vaccine to state and\nlocal health officials to carry out their own plans. But if a single case\nis confirmed 'we will act as if the nation were under attack' unless it\nclearly stems from a lab accident, a CDC doctor said. In an outbreak, the\npresident could declare a health emergency and take control of the\nvaccination effort.\nWould vaccination be mandatory? Under the new plan, vaccination is\nvoluntary even if someone has definitely been exposed to the smallpox\nvirus. But anyone who has been exposed and refuses vaccination may be\ninvoluntarily quarantined for up to 18 days.\nMust I consent to be vaccinated? Because all smallpox vaccines are\nconsidered 'investigational new drugs,' written consent is required. The\nCDC envisions showing all patients a video about the disease, vaccination\nand side effects. Medical personnel will then ask for a medical history to\nscreen out those who should not be immunized.\nIs there enough vaccine? About 155 million vaccine doses are available now,\nand enough for all 280 million Americans should be ready by year's end. The\nvaccine is not available through private doctors, only through the CDC. The\nprocedures for using such drugs are complex, but would be streamlined in an\nemergency.\nWhat are the logistics? Mass vaccination would require enormous resources.\nClinics would take over schools, warehouses, stadiums. Huge numbers of\nworkers would be needed to give injections, screen patients, get consent\nforms and control crowds. Isolated hospital wards would have to be set\naside for smallpox victims and those suffering complications, and to\nquarantine those who refuse vaccinations.\nWhat about the cost? The CDC estimates $5 to $10 a patient, but that covers\nonly the screening and injection itself.\n******\n[4]\nDate: 24 Sep 2002\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: NY Times 24 Sep 2002 [edited]\n<http://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/24/national/24RISK.html>\n\nTHE SIDE EFFECTS\nMedical Conditions Create Vulnerability to Vaccine\n--------------------------------------\nMany more people today are at risk of serious side effects from the\nsmallpox vaccine than in the past, when vaccination was routine.\nDuring the 1970's when smallpox vaccination in the United States was\nhalted, AIDS was unheard of, organ transplants were uncommon, and the rates\nof skin disorders like eczema were a third to a half of what they are now.\nToday, millions of people with those conditions have an increased risk of\nadverse reactions from the smallpox vaccine, along with many other people,\nincluding pregnant women, babies less than a year old, and patients with\ncancer and autoimmune diseases like lupus. Even healthy adults who had\neczema only in childhood are considered to be at risk.\nIf a smallpox outbreak should occur and the government decided to offer\nvaccinations to the entire country, these vulnerable people would be\nendangered not just from being vaccinated, but also from being in close\ncontact with someone else who had recently received the vaccine.\nSerious reactions can be countered with a special medicine, vaccinia immune\nglobulin or VIG, but the nation has only 600 to 700 doses. The government\nis trying to speed up production of VIG, said Joe Henderson, associate\ndirector for terrorism preparedness and response at the Centers for Disease\nControl and Prevention.\nDr. Donald Leung, an author of a recent article about the risks of smallpox\nvaccination, and head of the pediatric allergy and immunology division of\nthe National Jewish Medical and Research Center in Denver, said: 'It is a\nscary thought that only 600 to 700 doses of VIG are available. That\ncertainly will not be enough if there really is a bioterrorist attack.' The\narticle is in this month's issue of The Journal of Allergy and Clinical\nImmunology.\nAdverse reactions occur because smallpox vaccine is made with a live virus,\nvaccinia, which is related to the smallpox virus. In people with skin\nconditions or immune disorders, vaccinia can multiply too much.\nMr. Henderson said the disease centers, the Food and Drug Administration\nand the National Institutes of Health were negotiating with a private\ncompany to produce a smallpox vaccine using a weaker form of vaccinia that\nwould be safer for people at risk from the current vaccine.\nSkin disorders alone would cause as many as half the people in the United\nStates to be discouraged from getting vaccinated except in an emergency in\nwhich they had reason to believe they had been exposed to someone with the\ndisease, Dr. Leung said. The estimate includes patients with the itchy\nrashes known as eczema and atopic dermatitis, and also family members who\nwould endanger the patients by being vaccinated.\nBut people who have been exposed to smallpox, even those at high risk,\nshould be vaccinated, doctors say, because the risk of dying from smallpox\n-- about 30 percent -- is greater than the risk of dying from a reaction to\nthe vaccine.\nOnly a minority of people with skin disorders would be likely to suffer\nsevere reactions, but the number of cases could still be high, because skin\nproblems are so common, Dr. Leung said. About 15 million Americans suffer\nfrom eczema and atopic dermatitis. It is impossible to predict which people\nwith skin disorders will have problems from the vaccine.\nVulnerable people can be infected by close contact with someone else who\nhas recently been vaccinated, because the live virus is shed from the sore\nat the vaccination site for 2 to 3 weeks, said Dr. Lisa Rotz, a medical\nepidemiologist with the bioterror program at the disease centers. Mr.\nHenderson said the disease centers was considering the use of special\nbandages to keep the shedding to a minimum.\nPeople with skin problems are at risk for a condition called eczema\nvaccinatum, which can cause high fever and severe sores, scabs and deep\nscars all over the body. The condition has a death rate of one percent to 6\npercent.\nPeople whose immune systems have been weakened by AIDS or certain cancers,\nor by radiation, chemotherapy, steroids, or drugs used to prevent\ntransplant rejection, may be prone to an illness known as progressive\nvaccinia. In that condition, the sore that normally forms at the\nvaccination sites expands abnormally, growing larger and larger, causing\ntissue death and a systemic infection that may be uncontrollable. It can\nhave a death rate as high as 36 percent, Dr. Leung said in the article.\nVIG works in some but not all cases, said Dr. Rotz. 'If we had to do\nsomething tomorrow, if an outbreak occurred and we had to offer vaccination\non a larger scale, we would have to do our best to screen out people at\nrisk, because we don't have enough VIG to treat them,' she said.\nPregnant women are advised to postpone vaccination until after they have\ngiven birth, unless they have been exposed to smallpox. It is best for\nbabies not to be vaccinated until they are a year old.\n[Byline: Denise Grady]\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[This is a very in-depth analysis of the vaccination strategy for states in\nthe event of introduction of smallpox into the United States. These\narticles have done an excellent job of presenting many of the controversies\nand questions surrounding the plan as released as well as general\ncontroversies and questions surrounding the use of smallpox vaccine in the\nUnited States, especially in an environment and population that have\nchanged from when our data on the risks of the vaccine were produced.\nProMED has been covering this controversy, and subscribers are encouraged\nto read our prior postings for more detailed discussions on the concerns\nsurrounding smallpox vaccination. In a nutshell, the current vaccine\navailable for prevention of smallpox is one of our more dangerous vaccines\nin terms of associated serious side-effects and death. In the face of a\nreal threat of smallpox, with introduction of the wild virus into the\ngeneral population, the risk of the disease will far outweigh the risk of\ncomplications from the vaccination. A disease that carries a mortality of\n30 percent or more with a high level of morbidity for survivors, clearly is\nmore dangerous than the vaccine. The controversy is centered upon the\nrisk-benefit analysis of use of the vaccine when the risk of disease from\nthe wild virus is theoretical/hypothetical, while the risk of the vaccine\nis real. Current supplies of vaccinia immune globulin (VIG -- used for\ntreatment of severe complications following smallpox vaccination) are\ninsufficient for widespread vaccination activities, and the use of\nantiviral agents for treatment of serious complications of the vaccine is\nless than ideal in terms of knowledge of efficacy of treatment and safety\nissues surrounding the use of the drugs. While not a scientific\nconclusion, one hopes that we will have the luxury of time for further\nresearch and development of a newer, safer vaccine, increased production of\nVIG, and further research on the safety and efficacy of antiviral agents to\nbe used for both complications of vaccination (vaccinial infections) and\nfor the actual disease. - Mod.MPP]", "summary": "Current supplies of vaccinia immune globulin (VIG -- used for\ntreatment of severe complications following smallpox vaccination) are\ninsufficient for widespread vaccination activities, and the use of\nantiviral agents for treatment of serious complications of the vaccine is\nless than ideal in terms of knowledge of efficacy of treatment and safety\nissues surrounding the use of the drugs.

But the new guidance for states is far from encyclopedic, and experts\ncomplained that the center's 48-page document failed to answer questions\nabout the timing, cost, and logistical hurdles of preparing thousands of\nhealth professionals and volunteers to conduct mass vaccinations while\nkeeping the public calm. If we do\nnot do that, and we just go to this plan, then these workers will be\nstanding in line to get their vaccination rather than helping us' vaccinate\nothers.\n Mr. Henderson said the disease centers, the Food and Drug Administration\nand the National Institutes of Health were negotiating with a private\ncompany to produce a smallpox vaccine using a weaker form of vaccinia that\nwould be safer for people at risk from the current vaccine. But people who have been exposed to smallpox, even those at high risk,\nshould be vaccinated, doctors say, because the risk of dying from smallpox\n-- about 30 percent -- is greater than the risk of dying from a reaction to\nthe vaccine. In releasing their most comprehensive smallpox preparedness plan to date,\nofficials at the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC]\nsaid publicly for the first time that even one case of smallpox might\nresult in a nationwide program of voluntary vaccinations. People with weakened immune systems: When smallpox was declared eradicated\nin 1980, little was known about immune-system problems, but experience with\nother serious infections suggests that such people will be more vulnerable,\nboth to smallpox itself and to severe side effects from the vaccine. He said studies had found that if 1000\npeople were infected in a large city like New York and ring vaccination\nwere used, within 3 months there would be 300 000 cases of smallpox and 100\n000 deaths, and the epidemic would not be contained. Vulnerable people can be infected by close contact with someone else who\nhas recently been vaccinated, because the live virus is shed from the sore\nat the vaccination site for 2 to 3 weeks, said Dr. Lisa Rotz, a medical\nepidemiologist with the bioterror program at the disease centers. \nPregnant women: The risk from smallpox vaccine to the fetus is relatively\nsmall, but health officials recommend that pregnant women who have not been\nexposed to smallpox wait until after childbirth. Today, millions of people with those conditions have an increased risk of\nadverse reactions from the smallpox vaccine, along with many other people,\nincluding pregnant women, babies less than a year old, and patients with\ncancer and autoimmune diseases like lupus. The center's previous smallpox preparedness plan revolved around a strategy\nin which public health workers would track down and vaccinate infected\npeople and those who came into contact with them, working in concentric\ncircles until the outbreak was contained. If a smallpox outbreak should occur and the government decided to offer\nvaccinations to the entire country, these vulnerable people would be\nendangered not just from being vaccinated, but also from being in close\ncontact with someone else who had recently received the vaccine. Jonathan B. Tucker, a germ-weapons expert in Washington and author of\n'Scourge,' a book on the smallpox threat, said public confidence in the\nplan was crucial for its success but judged the guidelines and their\nexplanation by federal officials wanting.

But Dr. Bill Bicknell, a professor of international health\nat Boston University critical of that strategy, said the guide was\nundoubtedly influenced by recent studies showing that ring vaccination\nwould not contain a large outbreak. The 2 treatments that exist for severe side\neffects are: vaccinia immune globulin, which is derived from the blood of\ndonors vaccinated with smallpox vaccine, and cidofovir, an antiviral drug\nmarketed as Vistide. Dr. Gerberding described this as 'an unfortunate coincidence of\ntiming,' and said the guide was simply an update of a preparedness plan\nfirst issued 2 years ago, before the attacks on New York and the Pentagon\nand the subsequent anthrax attacks. It is not known how long a childhood\nvaccination will protect an adult, so the CDC recommends vaccination for\nanyone who has definitely been exposed to the virus, regardless of age or\nmedical condition. For\ninstance, it is federal policy for health workers first to isolate infected\npatients and vaccinate people in close contact with them, forming a series\nof rings of immunization around an outbreak and barriers to its spread. But now, faced with\nthe possibility of a terrorist attack, the federal Centers for Disease\nControl and Prevention have adopted guidelines for a mass vaccination in\nthe event of an outbreak. The government\nis trying to speed up production of VIG, said Joe Henderson, associate\ndirector for terrorism preparedness and response at the Centers for Disease\nControl and Prevention. Replete with flowcharts and checklists, the center's guide covers things\nlike how many security officers would be needed for each clinic to contain\nan unruly crowd (2 per clinic per day) and how many minutes it would take\npeople to fill out the medical history screening forms (2 to 3). Mr. Thompson, the health\nsecretary, signed contracts with two companies to buy 209 million doses to\nadd to the existing stockpile of vaccine, some of which dates to the\n1950's. Officially, the virus is supposed\nto exist only in repositories in Moscow and the CDC's headquarters in\nAtlanta, but experts have long suspected that some nations harbor secret\nstocks of smallpox to use as a biological weapon. But\nexperts questioned the plan's depth, breadth, and realism, warning that\nsuperficiality can sap public confidence and, in a crisis, widen a health\ncalamity. That is in part\nbecause even a single case could be a harbinger of a larger outbreak and in\npart because even one case would undoubtedly spark panic and a clamor for\nvaccine. People whose immune systems have been weakened by AIDS or certain cancers,\nor by radiation, chemotherapy, steroids, or drugs used to prevent\ntransplant rejection, may be prone to an illness known as progressive\nvaccinia.

' \nMany more people today are at risk of serious side effects from the\nsmallpox vaccine than in the past, when vaccination was routine. In theory, during a deadly outbreak, mass smallpox vaccinations can protect\nmany people: the vaccine is one of the few immunizations that can work even\nif a person is already infected. Last week, Acambis said it had\nproduced the first smallpox vaccination kits for the federal stockpile but\nwould not say how many were available. Under the new plan, vaccination is\nvoluntary even if someone has definitely been exposed to the smallpox\nvirus. Dr. O'Toole said she thought the plan 'makes great good sense,' because it\nassumes that the nation must be ready to vaccinate a large number of people\non short notice. People with skin conditions Vaccination creates a high risk for a severe\nskin condition called eczema vaccinatum, which has been compared to\nthird-degree burns all over the body. Only a minority of people with skin disorders would be likely to suffer\nsevere reactions, but the number of cases could still be high, because skin\nproblems are so common, Dr. Leung said. While the new plan gives a blueprint for how to carry out mass\nvaccinations, it says nothing about other precautions that, Dr. Gerberding\nsaid in an interview, would continue to be the first line of defense. During the 1970's when smallpox vaccination in the United States was\nhalted, AIDS was unheard of, organ transplants were uncommon, and the rates\nof skin disorders like eczema were a third to a half of what they are now. But the issue is complicated because the vaccine, made from a live virus,\ncarries risks to patients with skin disorders and immune system\ndeficiencies, including people with AIDS. Agency officials\nsaid that absent a declaration of a national emergency by the president\nthey would make the decision in consultation with state health officials. But mass vaccination,\nhe said, would contain such an epidemic in 40 to 45 days, with 1500 cases\nand 500 deaths. The guide says up to 75 million doses of the\nnation's vaccine stockpile could be shipped in a single day and 280 million\ndoses, enough to cover every American, in 5 to 7 days. Dr. Akhter, of the public health group, said an even bigger unknown was who\nin Washington would make the decision to begin mass vaccinations and how\nthat decision would be communicated. ' Today's release of the 'Smallpox Vaccination Clinic Guide' comes as the\nUnited States is mobilizing for a possible attack on one of those nations,\nIraq. People with a history of eczema\nshould not be vaccinated unless they know they have been exposed to\nsmallpox. There is no set timetable by which states must comply, Dr. Gerberding said,\nadding that the disease control agency hoped that states would conduct\npreparedness exercises as they develop their own plans. The vaccine is one of the few that can work even if a person is already\ninfected, and experts say it can protect people if given within 4 days of\nexposure to the virus. The C.D.C. says those who have not been exposed to smallpox ''should think\nabout not being vaccinated or waiting to be vaccinated until you have\ncompleted any treatments that affect your immune system function.' And he noted that until recently, a mass vaccination policy would have been\nimplausible, because the nation did not have a big enough vaccine stockpile\nto carry it out. In Maryland, Dr. Georges Benjamin, secretary of the Department of Health\nand Mental Hygiene, said he had already told his staff to integrate the\ndocument into the existing bioterrorism preparedness plan. In a nutshell, the current vaccine\navailable for prevention of smallpox is one of our more dangerous vaccines\nin terms of associated serious side-effects and death.

Asked if he could conduct a mass\nvaccination right away, he said, 'We would do what we had to do, but it\nwould be tough. But the plan does not address the vexing, and politically delicate, issue\nof whether to vaccinate public health workers and emergency personnel\nbefore a terrorist attack. People with skin problems are at risk for a condition called eczema\nvaccinatum, which can cause high fever and severe sores, scabs and deep\nscars all over the body. Even\nthough the federal government has given the states $918 million to build\nbioterror defenses, that may not be enough, Dr. Tucker said. ProMED has been covering this controversy, and subscribers are encouraged\nto read our prior postings for more detailed discussions on the concerns\nsurrounding smallpox vaccination. ------------------------------\nRoutine smallpox vaccinations were discontinued in the United States in\n1972, and the disease was declared eradicated in 1980. It's very unclear whether CDC or\nthe states are developing the necessary communication strategy to prevent\npanic in the event of an outbreak,' he said. Acambis, a company in Cambridge, England, is making 209 million doses of\nthe vaccine for the federal government but says it is barred from giving\nout all but sketchy details of its progress. Dr. Mack Sewell, New Mexico's state epidemiologist, said achieving that\nlevel of readiness 'is a matter of time, attention and resources,' all of\nwhich are uncertain at this point. The guidelines call for states to run 20 clinics 16 hours a day, an effort\nthat the government estimates would require 4680 public health workers and\nvolunteers. In an outbreak, the\npresident could declare a health emergency and take control of the\nvaccination effort. What we saw last fall with the anthrax attacks, which\nwere much less threatening than a smallpox outbreak would be, was public\nhysteria. It's very hard to say without a clear threat who should and who shouldn't\nbe vaccinated,' said Tara O'Toole, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for\nCivilian Biodefense Strategies. ' Isolated hospital wards would have to be set\naside for smallpox victims and those suffering complications, and to\nquarantine those who refuse vaccinations. At the moment, there is only enough globulin for about\n600 patients, the number of serious complications expected from vaccinating\n5 million people. But if a single case\nis confirmed 'we will act as if the nation were under attack' unless it\nclearly stems from a lab accident, a CDC doctor said. Depending on the size and severity of the outbreak and where it\nis, the guidelines said more or fewer participating clinics could be\nneeded. A real potential problem is how\nyou ensure that a vaccination process is orderly and people don't panic,'\n A disease that carries a mortality of\n30 percent or more with a high level of morbidity for survivors, clearly is\nmore dangerous than the vaccine. Mr.\nHenderson said the disease centers was considering the use of special\nbandages to keep the shedding to a minimum. In the 1960's the rates of severe side effects\nwere about 12 cases of encephalitis and 39 cases of severe eczema per\nmillion vaccinations. It's putting a lot of responsibility in a short time on local clinics,\nwhich will be untested,' said Caroline B. Hall, a professor of infectious\ndiseases at the University of Rochester's School of Medicine. ' Smallpox, which was eradicated worldwide 2 decades ago, is highly\ncontagious and kills roughly a third of its victims, making it a\npotentially fearsome biological weapon. In that condition, the sore that normally forms at the\nvaccination sites expands abnormally, growing larger and larger, causing\ntissue death and a systemic infection that may be uncontrollable. The\nCDC envisions showing all patients a video about the disease, vaccination\nand side effects. Each kit contains the dry vaccine,\nfluid for its dilution, needles for its administration and forms to inform\nthe patient of its status as an investigational new drug. For security reasons, much of\nthat information is kept secret to deny terrorists details that might let\nthem cripple defenses and make smallpox attacks more effective.", "reports": [{"diseases": ["unknown", "other", "smallpox"], "syndromes": ["encephalitis"], "event_date": ["1970-03-25 00:00:00", "1980-03-25 00:00:00", "1972-03-25 00:00:00", "2001-11-25 00:00:00", "2002-09-24 00:00:00", "1960-03-25 00:00:00", "1950-03-25 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "New Mexico 's", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Moscow", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "the United \n States", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Iraq", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "the United States", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Atlanta", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "the \n United States", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Maryland", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Cambridge", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "United States", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "New York", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Denver", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Washington", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "England", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Henderson", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "2202131", "headline": "PRO> Smallpox containment strategies - USA", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=2202131", "date": "2002-07-11 23:50:00", "main_text": "SMALLPOX CONTAINMENT STRATEGIES - USA\n***************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\n<http://www.promedmail.org>\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\n<http://www.isid.org>\nDate: 9 Jul 2002\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: AP Online [8 Jul 2002]\n\nFeds Prepare for Smallpox Quarantine\n--------------------------------------\nATLANTA -- Federal health officials are quietly making plans for\nquarantining Americans who might be exposed to a highly contagious smallpox\npatient, addressing sensitive questions of how to hold people, possibly\nagainst their will, in case of a bioterror attack.\nThe planning, still in draft form, addresses complex logistical and policy\nquestions, including where people would be kept while waiting for officials\nto confirm a smallpox case and, if necessary, administer vaccinations.\n``It's not pretty to think through these type of doomsday scenarios, but\nit's important to start to put yourself there and imagine things unfolding\nif you want to anticipate how to react,'' said Dr. Marty Cetron, a\nquarantine expert at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nWithin the next few weeks, the plan will be circulated among top federal\nofficials and others involved in the preparation, said Cetron, who\nco-chairs a CDC working group on the issue.\nThe group began with this scenario: Officials get word that an\ninternational flight is headed for the United States with a\nsmallpox-infected passenger aboard. The case would be fairly easy because\nthe people would be in one place and health officials wouldn't have to\ntrack them down.\nStill, if the passengers weren't held for treatment, CDC experts estimate\nthat a plane filled with 500 people including one with smallpox could\nresult in dozens, maybe hundreds, of sick people, including passengers on\nthe plane who got sick and the people they would infect.\nThe vaccine is only effective within 4 days of someone being exposed to\nsmallpox, so if people leave the scene it would be difficult to find them\nin time.\nUnder the plan, officials would stress that people would be better off\nstaying in quarantine because that's where the vaccine and other\nmedications would be available. That's a big change from past centuries,\nwhen people in quarantine were written off, Cetron said.\n'All the goodies will be delivered inside the box,' he said. 'It's a\nfundamental difference to spend as much, if not more attention, on\nmonitoring and preserving the health on the people inside the box.'\nOnce planning is complete for this scenario, the CDC group plans to tackle\nmore complicated situations, such as a smallpox patient in a sports stadium\nor an infected person wandering through an airport.\nSmallpox was declared eradicated in 1980, but samples of the deadly virus\nstill exist in both the United States and Russia. Bioterrorism experts\nconsider the possibility of a smallpox attack one of the most frightening,\nalbeit unlikely, threats because one infected patient could infect many others.\nRoutine immunizations against smallpox in the United States ended in 1972,\nmeaning many Americans have no protection against the disease. Federal\nofficials are now considering vaccinating as many as 500 000 health care\nworkers and emergency personnel who would be first to see any smallpox\ncase. But because the vaccine carries significant risks, including death,\nofficials do not want to resume mass vaccinations, a point President Bush\nmade Monday.\n'I worry about calling for a national vaccination program and that it could\ncause a loss of life,' Bush said at a White House news conference.\nRather, the plan is to vaccinate others only if they are exposed to the\nvirus, or exposed to someone who is exposed. Another alternative, one\nendorsed Monday in a study in the Proceedings of the National Academy of\nSciences, would be mass vaccinating all Americans if a smallpox case\nemerged. The authors of that study predicted significantly fewer people\nwould die using a mass vaccination strategy.\nThe airliner scenario is not entirely fictitious. In December 2001, a\nflight from Taiwan bound for Newark, N.J., was delayed for about 4 hours in\nSeattle after an anonymous tipster told U.S. Customs Service agents that a\npassenger had smallpox. It turned out to be a hoax, but the situation\nprovided a real-life example of how people on the plane reacted.\n'People got really scared because they sat there on a plane for 2 hours\nwithout any idea what was going on,' said Kristy Lillibridge, an\nepidemiologist who is part of the CDC working group.\nThe draft CDC plan calls for taking the airplane to a hangar or another\nfacility where passengers can get off without going into the airport, she\nsaid. The suspicious passenger would be isolated from the others, but\neveryone would be kept in quarantine while officials did tests to determine\nif the passenger was in fact infected with smallpox.\nStill unresolved: how long to keep people if a smallpox exposure is\nconfirmed. Options include one to 2 days, or long enough to give the shots;\n7 days, long enough to see if the vaccination worked; or 17 days, when no\none would be contagious anymore.\n'It is such a sensitive topic. Those kinds of decisions, to actually use a\nquarantine, will be made at very high levels,' Cetron said.\nOther elements of the plan, officials said, include:\n--If possible, diverting the flight to one of 8 international airports\nwhere the CDC has quarantine operations in place, or to another airport\nwhere the local public health authorities are prepared to handle the case.\n--Creating clear messages and announcements to deliver to passengers,\nincluding those that would be read by the pilot while they are still on the\nplane.\n--Providing beds, restrooms, food and access to medication for anyone in\nquarantine.\n[byline: Laura Meckler]\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[After the incident with the case of chickenpox on the flight from Taiwan\nto Newark, the need for a protocol for management of such an eventuality\nwas highlighted. This article poses the possibility of quarantine of all\npassengers to prevent potential spread if smallpox is the etiology. In the\nnot-so-distant past, quarantine was not felt to be a practical option,\nespecially for vaccine-preventable diseases. Given the high level of\nsusceptibility of the general population to smallpox now, in the\npost-vaccination era, and given the high mobility of individuals,\nrevisiting quarantine as an option is not far-fetched. The incubation\nperiod for smallpox ranges from 7-19 days; if a case is confirmed on an\nairline flight, logistics for the quarantine of all passengers for an\naverage of 21 days will have to be developed. Not a simple scenario.\nThe CDC website has interim response plans for isolation and quarantine\nmeasures in the event of re-introduction of smallpox. These are draft\ndocuments and can be viewed by following the links on:\n<http://www.bt.cdc.gov/DocumentsApp/Smallpox/RPG/index.asp>\nAccording to Chin's Control of Communicable Diseases Manual (17th edition,\n2000), the definition of quarantine is: 'Restriction of the activities of\nWELL persons or animals who have been exposed to a case of communicable\ndisease during its period of communicability (i.e., contacts) to prevent\ndisease transmission during the incubation period if infection should\noccur. Absolute or complete quarantine: The limitation of freedom of\nmovement of those exposed to a communicable disease for a period of time\nnot longer than the longest usual incubation period of that disease, in\nsuch manner as to prevent effective contact with those not so exposed.' In\ncontrast, isolation refers to: 'separation, for the period of\ncommunicability, of INFECTED persons or animals from others in such places\nand under such conditions as to prevent or limit the direct or indirect\ntransmission of the infectious agent from those infected to those who are\nsusceptible to infection or who may spread the agent to others.' - Mod.

In the best case, the\nepidemic was stopped in 115 days and in the worst 350 days.\nThe new analysis is being published this week in the online edition of\nProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Its authors are Edward H.\nKaplan, a public health specialist at Yale University, and David L. Craft\nand Lawrence M. Wein, both of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\nEver since smallpox was eradicated from human populations decades ago,\nfederal officials have resisted mass vaccination because the vaccine uses a\nlive virus that can cause severe side effects and even kill. In the days of\nwide vaccination, roughly one person in a million died.\nBut federal policy is in flux because of fears of bioterrorism. Although\ntoday only Russia and the United States have declared stocks of the virus,\nexperts say clandestine supplies probably exist.\nMost people are now considered vulnerable because immunity is thought to\nwane over time. The United States stopped routine vaccinations in\n1972. Smallpox kills roughly 1 in 3 victims who are unvaccinated.\nVaccination can save even infected people because the vaccine, if given\nwithin 4 days of exposure to the virus, halts the disease's advance.\nThe new study, coming amid rising criticism of federal policy in recent\nmonths, claims to be the first to make detailed comparisons of the\nvaccination options. It is an elaboration of a preliminary presentation\nthat Dr. Kaplan gave at a federal meeting in Washington on 15 Jun 2002.\nThe study found the least effective method to be 'ring vaccination,' the\nmain way smallpox was eradicated from human populations. It consists of\nisolating infected patients and vaccinating people found to be in close\ncontact with them, forming a ring of immunization around any outbreak and a\nbarrier to its further spread.\nIn the hypothetical attack, ring vaccination resulted in 367 000 cases of\nsmallpox and 110 000 deaths and took 350 days to extinguish the outbreak.\nBy contrast, mass vaccinations carried out as soon as authorities became\naware of the attack (smallpox takes roughly 2 weeks to incubate in the body\nand show symptoms) would result in 1830 cases and 560 deaths over a period\nof 115 days.\nThe study found that if the authorities were overwhelmed and decided\nbelatedly to switch from ring to mass vaccination on the 33rd day of the\ncrisis, the fatalities would still be quite high 15 570 cases and 4680 deaths.\n'The cost of waiting,' the authors said, 'is very high 4120 incremental\ndeaths.'\nThe study found that the vaccination of the United States population before\nan attack worked best of all to cut fatalities.\nIf only 40 percent of the population were immunized beforehand, the same\nattack followed by wider mass vaccinations would produce 440 deaths. But if\nfollowed with ring vaccinations, the result would be 40 000 deaths.\n'We believe that unless pre-attack vaccination is used,' the authors\nconclude, serious consideration should be given to dropping federal plans\nfor ring vaccination in favor of mass immunizations 'in the event of a\nsmallpox attack in a large urban center.'\n[Byline: William J.

On Monday, the\nOakland Medical Center began vaccinating 50 volunteers.\nResearchers will test 2 vaccines. One, known as Dryvax, was made 20 years\nago; there are 15 million doses available. There are more than 70 million\ndoses of the other vaccine, which Aventis Pasteur Inc. donated to the\ngovernment, who now must determine whether the vaccines are still usable.\nFor decades, Aventis' doses sat nearly unnoticed in a walk-in freezer at a\nremote mountainside lab in Pennsylvania. The firm thought the contents of\nits freezer were so worthless they were planning to destroy the stockpile.\nThen came Sept. 11 and the ensuing anthrax attacks. Suddenly the nation's\navailable supply of vaccine for smallpox, a disease that had been declared\neradicated worldwide in 1980, was deemed crucial.\n'In the past year, I think we've all become more aware of the possibility\nof a bioterrorist attack in the United States,' said Steve Black,\nco-director of the Vaccine Research Center at Oakland Medical Center.\n'I hope we never need to use this vaccine again, but it's important to make\ncertain that if we do it will be available and it will work,'' Black said.\n'If we can show that this vaccine stock is still effective, it will go a\nlong way toward making a dose of smallpox vaccine available for everyone in\nthe U.S.''\nVolunteers have already begun receiving the vaccine at Vanderbilt\nUniversity in Nashville, Tenn., and the University of Iowa. Baylor College\nof Medicine, in Houston, also is enrolling volunteers.

Zelicoff <apzelic@sandia.gov>\n\nRe: Dr. Sauri's comments in the ProMED posting of 22 Jun 2002 [see\nref. below].\nIn the hope of identifying areas of clear agreement and highlighting\nimportant areas of disagreement where new policy may be necessary:\nFirst, and most important, I stated many times at the NAS presentation\nthat the numbers in the Aralsk outbreak were small, and that even\nthough they are statistically worrisome for unusual behavior of the\nvirus, they account for only a small percentage of the variance we see\nin Aralsk versus any of the other smallpox outbreaks as regards the\nincidence of hemorrhagic disease or the ease of spread within\nhouseholds.\nWhat IS significant about the Aralsk outbreak is that this is the first\ndemonstration of aerosol dissemination of smallpox over distances\ngreater than tens of meters. Indeed, the apparent 'travel distance' of\nsmallpox exceeded by 3 orders of magnitude or more any other\ndocumented airborne propagation of the virus.\nSecond, the clinical studies of the 1940s, 50s, and 60s (let alone those\nof hundreds of years ago) are devoid of any inferential statistical\nanalysis (Fenner's book, for example, has not a single 'p' value that I\ncan find, and ditto for the work of Rao and many other orthopox\nresearchers), and as noted by several of the speakers at the NAS\nmeeting, the old data is often difficult to subject to such analysis due to\nproblems with stratification (which is to say, mixing of disparate data\nfrom multiple locations). This is precisely why I focused on Rao's\nwork (it is as homogenous a dataset as we have), and therein lies the\nbasis of my statistical calculations. Weak as they are, they are the best\nwe have, and suggest -- but certain do not prove -- that something was\nodd about the virus in Aralsk.\nIn addition, given the commentary of Pyotr Burgasov about a 'special\nstrain' being tested on Vozrozhdeniye Island (Dr. Henderson tells me\nhe is a generally credible person despite his [statements] about the\nSverdlovsk anthrax accident), I believe it is legitimate to at least ask\nthe question: are we dealing with something different than the strains\nthat caused the documented outbreaks around the world? The stakes,\nafter all, are very high.\nThird, it is quite incorrect to state that the Aralsk data does not change\nthe thinking on strategies for countering a terrorist attack utilizing\naerosolized smallpox. As every modeler noted at the NAS meeting,\nassumptions about the number of index cases dramatically affect the\nappropriate strategy -- especially if a better vaccine becomes available.\nEven if the virus is merely garden variety, the consequences of an\naerosol release infecting thousands, and perhaps more, changes\neverything.\nFourth, and most important, in no way did I recommend that current\npolicy for acquisition of the 300 million doses of NYBH vaccine be\nchanged. Further, after the ACIP announced its recommendation, I\nsupported it fully on NPR's 'Science Friday' program. It is the best\nhedge we have at the moment; which is another way of saying the\nvaccine is highly problematic and is best kept out of circulation in our\n[immunologically] heterogeneous population.\nFifth, regarding the infants in Aralsk who acquired hemorrhagic\ndisease. In other outbreaks, this is decidedly rare (about 0.03 percent);\nif we really believe that host factors are more-or-less solely responsible\nfor the clinical outcome of smallpox, should not infants have a high\nprevalence of hemorrhagic disease? I don't know the way out of this\nconundrum, but I believe that it is reasonable to conclude that variola\nbiology and pathogenesis are much more complicated than our current\nstate of knowledge suggests.\nIn the end, here is where we disagree: on the one hand, [a position\nthat] is comfortable trusting 200-year-old vaccine technology that has\nlimited effectiveness (measured in years, at best), results in side effects\nin a substantial portion of the population, requires immobilization of\nlarge segments of society in the event of an outbreak with all of the\nattendant economic consequences, and which may or may not work if\nindividuals inhale (literally) large numbers of virions. I believe, on the\nother hand, that we can and ought to do better.\nJahrling, Huggins and Daemon have identified several candidate anti-\nviral drugs and a promising animal model is being refined. There is\nevery reason to proceed with this pioneering work. And, since\nvaccinology has only recently emerged as a science from the mysticism\nthat characterized it until only a decade or so ago, I am confident we\ncan design (and test) a vaccine that is far less reactogenic, much longer\nlasting, and perhaps even protective after large-scale mucosal exposure.\nI am grateful to ProMED-mail for providing a forum to debate the\ndifficult questions surrounding smallpox.

According to the World Health Organization, immunization with\nthe smallpox vaccine -- made from a live weakened virus -- would now be\nfatal for many people whose immune system is impaired by HIV [1].\nTherefore, vaccination would be contraindicated for certain groups that\ninclude persons with immune disorders or those experiencing\ntherapeutically-induced immunosuppression, persons with HIV infection, and\npersons with a history of eczema [2].\nAccording to Anthony S. Fauci, M.D, as the AIDS epidemic enters its third\ndecade, more than 900 000 individuals are living with HIV infection in the\nUnited States and another 460 000 HIV-infected people in this country have\ndied. An additional 40 000 Americans will become newly infected with HIV\nthis year. More than half of these infections will occur in young people\nunder age 25. Around the world the situation is much worse: 40 million\npeople are living with HIV/AIDS, and 22 million HIV-infected individuals\nhave already died [3].\nHIV and smallpox vaccination present a significant challenge to the\nstatistical equation. Unlike other emerging infectious diseases, there is\nnot a public health mandate for HIV testing combined with contact tracing\nfor known at-risk contacts. Therefore, the presence of hidden HIV\ninfection in a population base presents a new dimension of issues that\nwould arise from this variable combined with associated contraindications\nfor vaccination in a bioterrorist incident.\n1.

Apatow\nHumanitarian Resource Institute\nBiodefense Reference Library\n<http://www.humanitarian.net/biodefense>\n<s.m.apatow@humanitarian.net>\n[Stephen Apatow's concerns are very well stated above. We do not have an\nadequate analysis of the potential risk in today's environment, which\nincludes many immunocompromised hosts leading mainstream lives who are at\nrisk of casual exposure to wild virus and vaccine virus.\nKemper et al. did a 'Back of the Envelope' presentation of possible risks\nassociated with smallpox vaccination for the Effective Clinical Practice,\nMarch/April 2002 issue for the American College of Physicians (ACP)\njournal. They concluded: 'After excluding high-risk individuals and their\ncontacts, we estimate that a vaccination strategy directed at people aged 1\nto 29 years would result in approximately 1600 serious adverse events and\n190 deaths. Vaccinating people aged 1 to 65 years would result in\napproximately 4600 serious adverse events and 285 deaths. Limitations:\nWhile advances in health care over the past 3 decades could mitigate\nvaccine complications, the increased number of unimmunized high-risk\nindividuals (e.g., those with eczema or immune suppression) could increase\ncomplication rates.'\nThey then went on to discuss the limitations and additional dangers to\n'high-risk' individuals of a mass immunization campaign. 'We assumed that\nindividuals would be screened before vaccination for risk factors, such as\neczema, immunodeficiency, or pregnancy, in themselves or in their close\ncontacts. The prevalence of eczema and the number of immunocompromised\nindividuals have increased over the past 3 decades. High-risk populations\nwould be excluded from vaccination, as would their potential contacts,\nsince recent vaccine recipients are 'infectious' and can transmit the virus\n(vaccinia).\nIndividuals with eczema are at high risk for developing eczema vaccinatum.\nThe prevalence of eczema is at least 10 percent, or more than 28 million\npeople in the United States. Immunocompromised persons are at high risk for\nprogressive vaccinia. We know of no overall estimate for the number of\nimmunocompromised individuals in the United States. This number would\ninclude recipients of organ transplants (184 000 solid-organ transplants in\nthe 1990s), individuals with diagnosed and undiagnosed HIV infection or\nAIDS (850 000), and patients with cancer (approximately 8.5 million). We\nestimate, therefore, that in the entire U.S. population as many as 10\nmillion individuals (3.6 percent) may be at increased risk for developing\nprogressive vaccinia.\nTherefore, approximately 15 percent of the population may have increased\nrisk for a direct adverse event after smallpox vaccination. In addition to\nexclusion of these individuals from vaccination, persons in close contact\nwith them should not be vaccinated to avoid inadvertent transmission and\nsubsequent indirect adverse events.

High-risk populations\nwould be excluded from vaccination, as would their potential contacts,\nsince recent vaccine recipients are 'infectious' and can transmit the virus\n(vaccinia). We\nestimate, therefore, that in the entire U.S. population as many as 10\nmillion individuals (3.6 percent) may be at increased risk for developing\nprogressive vaccinia. We do not have an\nadequate analysis of the potential risk in today's environment, which\nincludes many immunocompromised hosts leading mainstream lives who are at\nrisk of casual exposure to wild virus and vaccine virus. This number would\ninclude recipients of organ transplants (184 000 solid-organ transplants in\nthe 1990s), individuals with diagnosed and undiagnosed HIV infection or\nAIDS (850 000), and patients with cancer (approximately 8.5 million). Therefore, vaccination would be contraindicated for certain groups that\ninclude persons with immune disorders or those experiencing\ntherapeutically-induced immunosuppression, persons with HIV infection, and\npersons with a history of eczema [2]. In addition to\nexclusion of these individuals from vaccination, persons in close contact\nwith them should not be vaccinated to avoid inadvertent transmission and\nsubsequent indirect adverse events. According to Anthony S. Fauci, M.D, as the AIDS epidemic enters its third\ndecade, more than 900 000 individuals are living with HIV infection in the\nUnited States and another 460 000 HIV-infected people in this country have\ndied.

Dr. A. Ramachandra Rao (who\ntreated nearly 30 000 cases of variola major) has stated that the\nhemorrhagic form was 'rare' in children and 'far more common' in adults and\npregnant women. However, if you look at his data, 10% (early hemorrhagic\ntype) and 20 percent (late hemorrhagic type) was still occurring in\nchildren less than 14 years of age! (2) In the medical literature, if an\nevent lies outside the 90 percent central range or outside the large\nmajority (i.e. two standard deviations of the mean) then it may be a\nstatisitically significant event. It may even be clinically signficant. But\nif hemorrhage in children less than 14 years of age occurs 1 out of 5 (20\npercent late) to 10 (10 percent early) times, it is not 'rare' but\n'occasional.'\nFurthermore, Dr. Rao actually did not support the idea that this\nhemorrhagic form of smallpox was due to a different strain of virus (ie.\nthe India strain) based on epidemiologic evidence in his own study of 254\ninfected families reported in 1968.(3) Dr. Rao produced the hemorrhagic\nform in monkeys by cortisone adminstration before variolation in\n1968.(4) In fact, the variola infection in cortisone-treated monkeys\nbehaved in an almost identical manner to pregnant monkeys and pregnant\nwomen. In addition, the hemorrhagic variety is as prevalent in the\nvaccinated as in the unvaccinated. These observations suggest that it is\nnot a lack of immunity alone that is repsonsible for this highly fatal\nvariety. If lack of immunity were responsible, this variety should have\nbeen very common in young unvaccinated children, which is not the case.(2)\nFor these reasons, I am not swayed by the argument that the presence of 2\ninfant cases of the hemorrhagic form of the disease in 10 patients\nrepresents a signficant event; or that it implies a new strain and/or\nweaponized smallpox virus; or that it requires the radical change of our\ncurrent smallpox vaccine, and/or empiric antiviral therapy with cidofovir\nderivatives, to achieve control of any future bioterrorist attack with\nsmallpox.\nReferences:\n1.

Sauri, MD, MPH&TM, FACP, FACPM' <sauri@ix.netcom.com>\nThis is my rebuttal to Drs. Zelicoff and Zilinskas' comments about my\nPROMED posting concerning his report of the 1971 Aralsk smallpox\noutbreak. There is a difference in our perspective with respect to how\ndata should be interpreted. In my opinion, the 'burden of proof' is on Dr.\nZelicoff and Dr. Zilinskas to prove that the Aralsk outbreak represents a\ndeviation from the natural history of smallpox. My main objection is to\ntheir use of 'correlation coefficients' from the analysis of a very small\nsmallpox outbreak to justify sweeping changes in public health policy in\nthe control of smallpox. Our current public health policy on the control\nof smallpox is based on over 200 years of clinical studies on the\nmanagement smallpox and over 100 years of clinical studies on the efficacy\nof vaccinia vaccine.\nThe following are excerpts from several references in the medical\nliterature on hemorrhagic variola and vaccinia vaccination that argue\nagainst the Aralsk smallpox outbreak representing a significant deviation\nfrom the natural history of smallpox and, therefore, the result of a\n'weaponized' smallpox virus. I did not include any references from Dr.\nHenderson/Dr. Fenner since they may be viewed as 'biased.'\nA.) Dr. Welch's 1897 Chapter 'Smallpox and Varioloid' in A System of\nPractical Medicine, Vol. 1, Infectious Diseases has one of the best\nclinical descriptions of the various forms of hemorrhagic, malignant or\nblack smallpox (e.g. purpura variola, variola haemorrhagica pustulosa,\nvariola purpurica and variola nigrae) observed in the United States.(1) In\nthis reference is found the following comment:\n'It is known, however, that this type of the disease (malignant or\nhemorrhagic smallpox) varies in frequency in different epidemics.'\nB.) Dr. John Ruhrah's 1915 Chapter on Vaccination in the Frank Billing's\nForchheimer's Therapeusis of Internal Diseases, Vol. II, Infectious\nDiseases has one of the most comprehensive review of vaccinia vaccination\nand it's efficacy.(2) In this reference is found the following comment:\n'Some idea of the death rate from small-pox in prevaccination times can be\ngathered from a study of the table shown the deaths in Geneva over a period\nof 180 years. It will be noted that the greater mortality is during the\nfirst year of life, and that nearly all the deaths occurred before the\nfirst ten years.'\nC.) From Osler's 1944 The Principles and Practice of Medicine, Chapter on\n'Smallpox: Variola,' (3) can be found these two comments:\nIn Osler's subsection on 'Hemorrhagic Smallpox:'\n'Hemorrhagic smallpox is more common in some epidemics that in others. It\nis less frequent in children than in adults, and young and vigorous persons\nseem more liable to it. Men are affected more frequently than women. The\ninfluence of vaccination is shown in the fact that of 27 cases, 14 were\nunvaccinated, while not one of the 13, who had vaccination scars, had been\nrevaccinated.'\nIn Osler's subsection of 'Smallpox modified by Vaccination:'\n'As a rule, when smallpox attacks a person who has been vaccinated within 5\nyears, the disease is mild, but it may prove severe, even fatal. These\nmild forms, easily overlooked, are as infectious as the more severe types.'\nD. ) Finally, Christie's 1974 'Infectious Diseases, Epidemiology and\nClinical Practice' summarizes several outbreaks due to 'aerial convection'\nreported in the 1960' and 1970's. (4) These epidemics were felt to be\nair-borne and several were hospital-based. The most notable were in\nGermany, at Meschede and Monschau in 1970.\nDespite the relatively low infectiousness of smallpox in communities, there\nhave been well-documented, explosive outbreaks. The reason for this\ndichotomy is one of the great mysteries of smallpox\nepidemiology. Hemorrhagic cases by themselves do not imply a radically\nmore virulent or resistant smallpox virus since they have been reported in\nother outbreaks and well described in the pediatric literature. The degree\nof immunity of the population clearly correlates with the variability of\nseverity in smallpox outbreaks. Furthermore, the immunity offered by\nvaccinia has been shown in numerous studies over the past two centuries to\nbe time-limited.\nIn summary, based on the medical literature, the hemorrhagic cases in the\n1971 Aralsk smallpox outbreak do not suggest the involvement of a more\nvirulent (weaponized, hardened, or aerosolized) smallpox virus.\nFurthermore, the morbidity and mortality reported in the Aralsk outbreak is\nnot significantly different from previous naturally-occuring epidemics of\nsmallpox that have occurred in populations with waning\nimmunity. Consequently, I remain in agreement with Dr. Henderson that the\n1971 Aralsk smallpox outbreak does not change or add to the variables that\nwe are addressing in our public health strategy to this unlikely but\npotentially devastating bioterrorist threat.\n\nReferences\n1.

'The first\nvictim was a young woman who was working as a technician on a research\nvessel that was doing an investigation on the ecological situation of the\nAral Sea. It was cruising south of Vozrozhdenie Island at the end of July\n[1971] and we believe that at that time she was exposed to an aerosol that\nwas released over Vozrozhdenie Island, which was about 15 km away. When she\nreturned to her home in Aralsk she came down with symptoms of smallpox. She\npassed it on to her 9-year-old brother, who became rather sick, but both of\nthem survived,' Zilinskas said. However, 3 others -- 2 babies, and the\nboy's teacher -- didn't. They died of hemorrhagic smallpox, a particularly\nvirulent form of the disease. In all, 10 people became ill with smallpox.\nThe 7 who survived, including the researcher and her brother, had received\nsmallpox vaccinations years earlier, while the 3 who died had not. The town\nwas closed. Mass vaccinations and quarantines followed.\nSmallpox was still occurring naturally in the 1970s, but the Monterey\nInstitute's researchers say evidence in the Aralsk case points strongly not\nto a natural outbreak or lab accident but to the testing of a smallpox\nbiological weapon on Vozrozhdenie. If the germs were airborne, this means\nthey were disseminated as an aerosol, and the fact that some of those\nstruck by the virus had already been vaccinated suggests, though not\nnecessarily proves, that the smallpox used was of a particularly virulent\nstrain.\nRetired General Petr Burgasov, once a top figure in the Soviet Union's\nbioweapons program, admitted in the 'Moscow News' paper late last year\n[2001] that a smallpox test -- he did not specify a year -- had caused an\nunidentified number of civilian deaths. 'They were testing a strong strain\nof smallpox,' Burgasov is quoted as saying in the 'Moscow News' interview,\nwhich the Monterrey researchers cite in their report. 'Suddenly I'm told\nthat there are some unexplained deaths in Aralsk. A research boat had gone\nwithin 15 km of the island [it was banned from going closer than 40 km]; a\nwoman laboratory technician went twice a day on land to take plankton\nsamples. The smallpox agent -- and on the island all of 400 grams of the\nstrain was used -- 'got' her.'\nZilinskas said his team's report is based on previously secret documents\ngiven to them by the Kazakh Scientific Center for Quarantine and Zoonotic\nDiseases. It is also based on interviews with 2 survivors, the woman and\nher younger brother. He acknowledged the data is patchy, but said the\n'airborne germs' theory is the most logical explanation of how the woman\nbecame infected. And he dismissed suggestions by skeptics that it could\nhave been a natural outbreak that traveled from Afghanistan. 'The problem\nwith that explanation is that there were no other cases in between. In\nother words, in Uzbekistan or Turkmenistan or any of these other countries\nyou'd have to transverse in order to get to Aralsk. And there were no other\noutbreaks at that time anywhere else in the neighborhood. So the only good\nexplanation is that this testing was done on Vozrozhdenie Island,'\nZilinskas said.\nZilinskas said action is needed now to improve existing smallpox vaccine\nstocks, in case they are not effective against all smallpox strains. That,\nhe said, is a long-term process that could take 5 or 10 years.\n[Byline: Kathleen Knox]\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[Two things are important to note in this version:\n- 'a woman laboratory technician went twice a day on land to take plankton\nsamples' -- the first report said she never left the ship, so must have got\nit by aerosol from at least 15 km away; so the spread may not have been\nthat far.\n- 'there were no other cases in between' Afghanistan & Kazakhstan at that\ntime -- this can presumably be checked from WHO records, making it very\nunlikely it was natural spread. - Mod.JW]\n[According to the WHO history of Smallpox Eradication\n<http://whqlibdoc.who.int/smallpox/9241561106_chp14.pdf> transmission of\nsmallpox in Afghanistan was not interrupted until September 1972.

This was quite beyond their capabilities at\nthat time. If they had weaponized the smallpox virus, it would have been\ndone using classical techniques.\nSecond, the main implication of this event is that the Soviet Union was\nworking on weaponizing the smallpox virus since at least the late 1960s,\nand possibly earlier. The Western intelligence services did not learn of\nthis work until 1989, when the first defector from Biopreparat, Dr.\nVladimir Pasechnik, was debriefed and can be assumed to have provided this\ninformation. This means that Soviet military scientists, having had more\nthan 20 years to weaponize smallpox virus and supported by nearly unlimited\nfunds, certainly had plenty of opportunity to develop a strain of smallpox\nvirus that would exceed the pathogenic and virulence potentials of wild\nstrains. (Just think of what a high level scientific team at CDC or\nUSAMRIID could have accomplished if it had been given a similar mission!)\nGiven this history, it is of vital importance to global health security\nthat the Russian government provide information about smallpox strains that\nwere weaponized during the Soviet period so we can test our vaccines\nagainst them. This also means that the 3 closed Russian military biological\ninstitutes, including the Institute of Virology at Sergiyev Posad, must be\nopened up to foreign visitations.\nThird, given that the Soviet Union weaponized the smallpox virus and\nformulated it for use as an aerosol, it would be wise for government\nofficials now working on crafting a policy for meeting the threat of\nbioterrorism to take this into account. In other words, the common thinking\nis that were terrorists to acquire smallpox virus, they would disseminate\nit among a target population via infected individuals. In view of the\nSoviet work with smallpox, it is necessary for officials to also consider\nhow best to prepare for and respond to an attack that utilized aerosolized\nsmallpox virus.\n--\nRaymond A.

Zelicoff <apzelic@sandia.gov>\n\nRegarding the previously unknown outbreak of smallpox in 1971 in Aralsk\n(Soviet Union), I would like to augment Dr. Michael A. Sauri's assessment\n(posted on ProMED on 18 Jun 2002) of both the intent and content of my\npresentation at the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) last weekend.\n1. The key point that I was trying to make was that, for the first time, we\nnow have data that smallpox can indeed be aerosolized and propagated over\nlarge distances (many kilometers). Previously, smallpox experts stated that\nthis was simply not possible due to the environmental instability of the\nvirus. I am pleased to see that DA Henderson acknowledged this morning\nthat, indeed, smallpox can be 'hardened' to so behave (see:\n<http://www.cnn.com/2002/HEALTH/conditions/06/20/smallpox.vaccine/index.html>)\nHe had previously asserted at the NAS meeting that this could not be done.\n2. The significance of this finding is its effect on all of the smallpox\npropagation models presented at the NAS. To illustrate with only one of the\nmodels (that of Dr. Ed Kaplan): the 'decision point' for the strategy of\nmass vaccination vs. vaccination on warning or pre-attack vaccination of a\nselected group of people (physicians, public health officials, nurses,\ncritical infrastructure workers) depends MOST sensitively on the\n'reproductive ratio' of clinical smallpox (i.e., the number of people each\nperson with smallpox may go on to infect) AND the number of initial cases.\nIn Dr. Kaplan's model, if we assume that the reproductive ratio is less\nthan about 2 (a very conservative assumption according to what I've read\nfrom smallpox experts) and an initial number of cases less than about 30,\nthen mass vaccination is NOT the appropriate strategy (due to the side\neffects of the vaccine outweighing the benefits). However (and this is very\nimportant), if the number of index cases rises into the hundreds, then even\nwith a very much lower reproductive ratio (near '1'), mass vaccination IS\nthe appropriate strategy. Obviously an aerosol dissemination would create a\nsubstantially larger number of initial cases than would, say, introduction\nof some number of infected people into the US population. Thus, vaccination\nstrategy may change, given our existing vaccine.\n3. Repeatedly emphasizing at the NAS that the numbers (that we know about)\nin the Aralsk outbreak are small (10 total cases), I compared the apparent\nrate of transmissibility in those households where the data was available\nto the Pakistan outbreak, stratified by vaccination status of the household\nindex case (see: Heiner, G.G., Fatima, N., and McCrumb, F.R. 'A Study of\nIntrafamilial Transmission of Smallpox,' American Journal of Epidemiology,\nvol. 94, pp. 252-268. also summarized in Fenner's Smallpox book). Using a\nnon-parametric model (Chi-square), the Aralsk outbreak differs\nsignificantly in the likelihood of transmission after taking into account\nthe vaccination status of the index case. Dr. Sauri is entitled to conclude\nthat the Aralsk outbreak is no different in this regard than what we have\nseen elsewhere, but the statistics don't support him.\n4. Regarding hemorrhagic disease in the Aralsk outbreak, there are clearly\ntoo few cases to draw any firm conclusions about the overall attack rate\nfor this variety of disease. However, what is striking is that in Aralsk\nthere were 2 infants with hemorrhagic disease among the 10 patients; in\nRao's series of 10 857 patients (published in 1964) and in his series of\n6900 (published in 1972), infants almost never got hemorrhagic disease\n(overall rate much less than 1 percent). Is there something different about\nthe strain that resulted in this difference? A simple binomial calculation\nindicates that there was a difference, but I don't think that any\nstatistician would be comfortable drawing conclusions on just 2 cases.\nHowever, I do believe that the question about 'strain' vs. 'host-factors'\nin understanding clinical varieties of smallpox is a legitimate one to ask.\nThis distinction has been dismissed in the past by smallpox experts.\nOne final point: when we think about vaccination strategies for smallpox\nprophylaxis, we tend to focus on the vaccine itself. However, in the 'ring\nvaccination' strategy employed in Africa and Asia in the 1960s and 1970s,\nand in Yugoslavia (1972) and Aralsk (1971), heroic efforts were made to\nidentify cases, isolate them, and also to severely limit all movement --\nparticularly of contacts -- for weeks. To the best of my knowledge, it is\nnot possible to distinguish the impact of the non-vaccination portion of\nthe ring strategy from the impact of the vaccine per se (if there is data\nto refute this point, I would very much like to see it, of course). Thus,\nvaccination policy decisions turn on much more than the vaccine itself, and\neven with the ability to massively vaccinate in the setting of an actual\nattack, the practicalities may be unacceptable to many Americans. Hence my\nsuggestion at the end of the NAS presentation: we should investigate other\nvaccines (ones that may be both more effective and less problematic) and\nsupplement any vaccine-based strategy with anti-viral drugs. Fortunately,\nthe latter are now being tested, though on a shoe-string budget.\n--\nAlan P.

[Two things are important to note in this version:\n- 'a woman laboratory technician went twice a day on land to take plankton\nsamples' -- the first report said she never left the ship, so must have got\nit by aerosol from at least 15 km away; so the spread may not have been\nthat far. If the germs were airborne, this means\nthey were disseminated as an aerosol, and the fact that some of those\nstruck by the virus had already been vaccinated suggests, though not\nnecessarily proves, that the smallpox used was of a particularly virulent\nstrain. However, what is striking is that in Aralsk\nthere were 2 infants with hemorrhagic disease among the 10 patients; in\nRao's series of 10 857 patients (published in 1964) and in his series of\n6900 (published in 1972), infants almost never got hemorrhagic disease\n(overall rate much less than 1 percent).

The report says a ship doing ecological research\nsailed too close to a military smallpox test that sent out a deadly\nplume of germs, infecting a crew member who carried the virus back to\nthe city.\nMoscow has never acknowledged the outbreak or that it ever tested\nsmallpox in the open air. But late last year, a former top official\nin the Soviet germ weapons program spoke of the incident in an\ninterview with a Moscow newspaper, and Kazakh officials have recently\nbeen investigating the outbreak's origins.\nNow a team of experts at the Monterey Institute of International\nStudies, drawing on formerly secret Soviet documents and interviews\nwith survivors, has written a report on the Aralsk outbreak.\nThe team says the strain of smallpox virus appears to have been\nunusually potent and even sickened seven people vaccinated against\nthe disease. The episode, the researchers say, raises questions about\nwhether new vaccines or drugs might be needed if this strain were\nused in an attack.\n'We know that the vaccine works well in the vast majority of cases,'\nAlan P. Zelicoff, a team member who is also a physician and smallpox\nexpert at the Sandia National Laboratories, said in an interview.\n'What the new data strongly suggests is that we have much more work\nto do on new vaccines and the development of antiviral drugs, none of\nwhich are available today.'\nIn envisioning a smallpox attack, terrorism experts consider\nperson-to-person contact a main threat. Members of the Monterey team\nsaid the blowing of germs in the wind suggested that a contemporary\nsmallpox threat could be harder to combat and contain.\nDr. Zelicoff is to present a summary of the report today in\nWashington to federal officials who are developing guidelines on\nwhether smallpox vaccinations should be offered to anyone besides the\nfew researchers who now work with the virus.\nThe three victims who died in Aralsk, Dr. Zelicoff said, were all\nunvaccinated and developed the disease's rare hemorrhagic form.\nUsually fatal, it is characterized by heavy bleeding and normally\naccounts for one to three percent of smallpox cases. The seven\nsurvivors, he added, had received routine vaccinations earlier but\nnonetheless contracted mild to serious cases of the disease.\nVaccination usually bars the crippling illness.\n'This outbreak did not have enough cases, thank God, to clarify'\nhints that the strain was unusually potent, Dr. Zelicoff said. 'But\nit at least makes the questions legitimate.'\nMembers of the Monterey team said federal officials grew wary this\nweek when told of the impending report out of fear that it would\nundermine the national push for 300 million doses of smallpox\nvaccine, the production of which is due to be completed late this\nyear.\nIn a conference call on Thursday, Dr. Zelicoff reassured health and\nmilitary officials that he would recommend more research rather than\nchanges in vaccine production.\nHis presentation is nonetheless expected to cause a stir at the\nmeeting today, which is public.\nD. A. Henderson, a top bioterrorism adviser to the secretary of heath\nand human services, said he was skeptical of the Monterey report's\nconclusions and expressed confidence in the American vaccine. As for\nthe Soviet one, too little was known, he said, to assess its\neffectiveness among Aralsk citizens in the 1971 outbreak.\n'We don't know when they were vaccinated or whether they were\nsuccessfully vaccinated,' Dr. Henderson said in an interview. He\nadded that the Monterey scientists were 'jumping to far-reaching\nconclusions with scant information.'\nNo country has divulged outdoor tests of the smallpox virus, which\ncauses high fevers and usually kills one in three unvaccinated\npeople. The disease was declared eradicated from human populations in\n1980.\nThe United States ended routine smallpox vaccinations in 1972 and the\nimmunity of those vaccinated before then is believed to have waned\nover time. Today, the protection issue is back on the public agenda\nas fears of germ terrorism have grown.\nOnly the United States and Russia now keep publicly declared stocks\nof the virus. But terror experts say impoverished Russian scientists\nmay have sold the virus to foreigners.\nRaymond A. Zilinskas, one of the Monterey report's authors, said in\nan interview that American officials should try to obtain the strain\nfrom the Russians in order to test the American vaccine's\neffectiveness.\n'They're going to have to open up,' Mr. Zilinskas said of the\nRussians. 'We have to know what we're defending against.' He added\nthat the Russians undoubtedly still possessed the strain.\nThe report was written with the aid of Kazakh officials, who blame\nMoscow for the Aralsk outbreak. The document, a draft of which The\nNew York Times obtained, is to be made public late this month or\nearly in July.\nThough it draws on old Soviet studies about the Aralsk outbreak, the\nreport does not directly tie the epidemic to weapon tests but infers\na link through circumstantial evidence and the perceived weakness of\nalternative theories, such as a natural epidemic.\nBy 1971, it notes, the Soviet Union had reported no outbreaks of the\ndisease for a decade.\nIn an interview, Dr. Henderson suggested that a natural outbreak\nmight have carried the virus to Aralsk from Afghanistan, where\nsmallpox in 1971 was still endemic.\nAs evidence of a weapons link, the Monterey report cites an interview\nwith General Pyotr Burgasov, a former official in the Soviet germ\nweapons program. Moscow News, a Russian publication, quoted him in\nNovember as saying the outbreak was caused by field testing of 400\ngrams, or a little less than a pound, of germs.\nGeneral Burgasov said the crew member on the research ship picked up\nthe virus when it passed within 15 kilometers, or about 9 miles, of\nan off-limits isle. The Aral Sea island of Vozrozhdeniye housed the\nmain outdoor testing area of the Soviet program to make germ weapons.\nThe smallpox test is said to have occurred on July 30, 1971, with the\nship sailing nearby between July 29 and July 31.\nAside from his comments, no details of the putative test are known\npublicly. But scientists at the military base on Vozrozhdeniye Island\nroutinely exposed animals to deadly germs and measured agent\ndispersal in open air.\nThese tests were legal in 1971, as no international treaty then\nexisted that banned the development of biological weapons.\nIn researching the incident, Dr. Zelicoff of the Sandia National\nLaboratories was able to track down and interview the outbreak's\nfirst case, who was then a young fisheries expert, as well as the\nsecond patient, her 9-year-old brother.\nContrary to the official Soviet report, he said, she told him that\nshe never disembarked from the ship, the Lev Berg, before returning\nto the home port of Aralsk. That, Dr. Zelicoff said, strengthened the\nidea that she picked up the virus from the wind rather than from a\nport of call.\nAs the youngest crew member, she told him, she worked most frequently\non deck. Her job was mainly to cast nets to catch fish, which she\nthen took below to a small laboratory.\nAfter the outbreak began in Aralsk, health officials scrambled to\ncontain the disease, according to a formally secret Soviet report\nreprinted in the Monterey study.\nNearly 50,000 residents of Aralsk were vaccinated in less than two\nweeks, and hundreds were placed in isolation in a makeshift facility\non the edge of town where they could receive no visitors.\nTravel to and from Aralsk was stopped, and many homes were\ndisinfected, along with 18 metric tons of household goods.\nThe Soviet vaccine of that era was generally considered as effective\nas the American one.\nIn his section of the draft report, Dr. Zelicoff says the fact that\nthe Soviet Union never reported the Aralsk outbreak to world health\nauthorities 'suggests a sinister source.'\nAnother author of the report is Jonathan B. Tucker, a Monterey\nofficial and author of 'Scourge,' a book on the smallpox threat.\nThe public forum where Dr. Zelicoff is presenting a summary of the\nMonterey study is one of a series that the Centers for Disease\nControl and Prevention is holding to solicit opinions before two\nadvisory committees decide whether to change recommendations on\nsmallpox vaccination.\nA policy decision is expected as soon as next week.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[This outbreak, which apparently occurred as a result of a bioweapons\nresearch accident, underscores the risk of intentional airborne\nexposure to smallpox virus.

Sauri <sauri@ix.netcom.com>\n\nThis is in response to your reporting of Dr. Zelicoff's announcement of a\npreviously unreported 1971 outbreak of smallpox in the USSR during the\nInstitute of Medicine's Smallpox expert forum in Washington D.C. at the\nNational Academy of Science on Saturday 15 Jun 2002.\nI was at the forum and heard the discussion that followed his report. The\nkey point that Dr.Zelicoff was making about the significance of this\nincident, as it relates to the current threat, was that the disease pattern\nsuggested that the Russians might have genetically engineered a smallpox\nvirus that would resist our current vaccinia virus vaccine. He based this\non the fact that the 2 children under 1 year and the adult who died had the\nsevere hemorrhagic form of the disease, and that 7 others who got sick\ncontracted the disease despite having been vaccinated.\nMy interpretation of the facts reported by Dr. Zelicoff is that the severe\nhemorrhagic form of the disease that was reported and documented by autopsy\nreports in the 3 that died, occurred in victims who had not been previously\nvaccinated. The pattern of disease reported was also consistent with\nreports over the past century of epidemics occurring in a population with\nwaning immunity.\nAlthough Dr. Margolis has stated the CDC's confidence that immunity against\nsmallpox lasts for many decades, many other reports, including a USPHS\nreport from 1935, suggest that full immunity may only last 3 years.(1) CDC\nbased its confidence on a 1990 study performed on Israeli recruits that\nsuggested immunity lasts up to 30 years, based on the presence of\nneutralizing antibodies.(2) Nevertheless, to date, the correlation of the\npresence of neutralizing antibodies and immunity remains unclear.(3)\nOver the past 200 years, since Jenner introduced vaccination with cowpox,\nand subsequently over the past 100 years with vaccinia virus vaccine,\ncomplete immunity has been defined as the ability to prevent pox formation\nat the site of revaccination. If we rely on this definition, then there is\na plethora of information both in our own USPHS data and the medical\nliterature that shows that immunity (the ability to prevent infection)\nwanes over a period of 3 years. Even the Israeli study showed a significant\ndrop in neutralizing antibodies at 3 years. If mortality is used as an\nendpoint, then the vaccinia vaccine remains significantly effective for at\nleast 10 years.\nIn our recently published study (4), we demonstrated that fewer than 10\npercent of 320 previously immunized biomedical researchers and laboratory\ntechnicians who had received vaccinia vaccine from 1994 to 2001 were able\nto prevent pox formation (i.e., 'immune' reaction) on re-challenge with the\nvaccinia virus during re-vaccination. Overall, of the total of 621\nvaccinees who received the vaccine during this period, only 6.4 percent\nwere immune based on the standard USPHS/WHO local skin reaction criteria\nfor immunity.\nIf you apply our study finding to the general population, the pattern of\ndisease seen in the Russian 1971 incident was no different than what would\nbe expected in a normal outbreak in a population with waning immunity.\nFurthermore, the hemorrhagic cases by themselves do not imply a radically\nmore virulent or resistant smallpox virus, since they have been reported in\nother outbreaks and well described in the pediatric literature. The fact\nthat the Russians worked with smallpox as a potential bioweapon has been\npreviously well documented. The fact that it occurred down-wind of\n'Resurrection' island in the Aral Sea suggests another 'accident' similar\nto the anthrax release that occurred 8 years later at their Biopreparat\nfacility in Sverdlovsk.\nConsequently, I agree with Dr. D. A. Henderson that Dr. Zelicoff's report\ndoes not change, or add to, the variables that we are addressing in our\npublic health strategy against this unlikely but potentially devastating\nbioterrorist threat.\nReferences:\n------------\n1.

The Advisory\nCommittee on Immunization Practices, which sets vaccine policy, is expected\nto make a decision Thursday. The panel's recommendation will go to Health\nand Human Services Secretary Tommy Thompson.\nIn rare cases, the vaccine itself causes devastating side effects --\nincluding brain damage and even death.

A ProMED-mail post\n<http://www.promedmail.org>\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\n<http://www.isid.org>\n In our recently published study (4), we demonstrated that fewer than 10\npercent of 320 previously immunized biomedical researchers and laboratory\ntechnicians who had received vaccinia vaccine from 1994 to 2001 were able\nto prevent pox formation (i.e., 'immune' reaction) on re-challenge with the\nvaccinia virus during re-vaccination. The\nkey point that Dr.Zelicoff was making about the significance of this\nincident, as it relates to the current threat, was that the disease pattern\nsuggested that the Russians might have genetically engineered a smallpox\nvirus that would resist our current vaccinia virus vaccine. On the Net:\n--------------\nCDC information: <http://www.bt.cdc.gov/Agent/Smallpox/SmallpoxGen.asp>\nAdvisory Committee: <http://www.cdc.gov/nip/acip>\n Over the past 200 years, since Jenner introduced vaccination with cowpox,\nand subsequently over the past 100 years with vaccinia virus vaccine,\ncomplete immunity has been defined as the ability to prevent pox formation\nat the site of revaccination. He based this\non the fact that the 2 children under 1 year and the adult who died had the\nsevere hemorrhagic form of the disease, and that 7 others who got sick\ncontracted the disease despite having been vaccinated. My interpretation of the facts reported by Dr. Zelicoff is that the severe\nhemorrhagic form of the disease that was reported and documented by autopsy\nreports in the 3 that died, occurred in victims who had not been previously\nvaccinated. This is in response to your reporting of Dr. Zelicoff's announcement of a\npreviously unreported 1971 outbreak of smallpox in the USSR during the\nInstitute of Medicine's Smallpox expert forum in Washington D.C. at the\nNational Academy of Science on Saturday 15 Jun 2002. Overall, of the total of 621\nvaccinees who received the vaccine during this period, only 6.4 percent\nwere immune based on the standard USPHS/WHO local skin reaction criteria\nfor immunity. If we rely on this definition, then there is\na plethora of information both in our own USPHS data and the medical\nliterature that shows that immunity (the ability to prevent infection)\nwanes over a period of 3 years. The killer has not infected a human in more than 2 decades, and the federal\ngovernment's current policy is to vaccinate only the handful of lab workers\nand scientists who work with the virus in high-security laboratories.\n The fact that it occurred down-wind of\n'Resurrection' island in the Aral Sea suggests another 'accident' similar\nto the anthrax release that occurred 8 years later at their Biopreparat\nfacility in Sverdlovsk. Consequently, I agree with Dr. D. A. Henderson that Dr. Zelicoff's report\ndoes not change, or add to, the variables that we are addressing in our\npublic health strategy against this unlikely but potentially devastating\nbioterrorist threat. The\nadvisory committee could decide to recommend changing that part of the\nplan, expanding vaccinations to the entire community near an outbreak or to\nthe entire nation. [By: Erin McClam]\n--\nProMED-mail\n Occupational Health Consultants\n9715 Medical Center Drive\nSuite 201\n If you apply our study finding to the general population, the pattern of\ndisease seen in the Russian 1971 incident was no different than what would\nbe expected in a normal outbreak in a population with waning immunity. The pattern of disease reported was also consistent with\nreports over the past century of epidemics occurring in a population with\nwaning immunity. The United States ended routine smallpox vaccinations in 1972, and current\nU.S. policy calls instead for 'ring vaccination' if a smallpox case is\nconfirmed. Whatever the panel decides, by early 2003 the government expects to\nstockpile enough doses of smallpox vaccine to protect every U.S. citizen in\nthe event of a biological attack. Furthermore, the hemorrhagic cases by themselves do not imply a radically\nmore virulent or resistant smallpox virus, since they have been reported in\nother outbreaks and well described in the pediatric literature. It is consistent with the\ntheory that although waning immunity may not protect against the disease,\nit may prevent death. The question carries critical weight in the new age of bioterrorism: Who\nshould have access to vaccine against deadly smallpox?\n If mortality is used as an\nendpoint, then the vaccinia vaccine remains significantly effective for at\nleast 10 years. However, September 11 and the anthrax attacks heightened fears that\nterrorists could somehow get their hands on smallpox and release it,\npotentially killing thousands of people.

However, health professionals are divided as to\nwhether it is best to vaccinate everyone immediately, in a\npre-emptive campaign, or wait until there is any clear threat. A\npre-emptive campaign would make it far easier to contain any outbreak.\nHowever, many people would die -- at least 180 in the US population\n-- because of health complications arising from the vaccine, says the\nBritish weekly New Scientist, which reports on the Maryland research\nin next Saturday's issue.\nSmallpox was declared eradicated by the World Health Organization in\n1980, prompting countries around the world to stop routine\nvaccinations.

If cases\nof smallpox were reported in their own community, more than 3/4 (81\npercent) of Americans say they would get vaccinated. This includes\nthe 59 percent who had already said they wanted to get vaccinated in\nthe near future, even without cases having been reported, as well as\nan additional 22 percent who became interested in vaccination once\nlocal cases were mentioned. One in 10 (9 percent) would not get\nvaccinated even if an outbreak of smallpox occurred in their\ncommunity.\nThese findings, based on interviews with 2000 Americans nationwide,\ncome at a time when 2 federal government advisory committees of\nexperts, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices and the\nNational Vaccine Advisory Committee, are debating whether or not\nvoluntary smallpox vaccinations should be offered to the public.\nAlso starting on Thu 6 Jun 2002, in New York City and San Francisco,\nthe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is conducting a series\nof public forums on the use of the smallpox vaccine.\n<http://www.cdc.gov/nip/smallpox/News.htm#Forums>\n'The survey results also raise the question of whether or not the\ncountry should move ahead with voluntary vaccination of frontline\nworkers, such as doctors, nurses, and emergency personnel,' said\nRobert J. Blendon, professor of Health Policy and Political Analysis\nat the Harvard School of Public Health. 'If there were a bioterrorist\nattack using smallpox, millions of Americans would want to find\nhealth professionals to vaccinate them. If the professionals\nthemselves have not been vaccinated, it could lead to serious delays\nand public panic.'\nThe substantial public interest today in receiving a smallpox\nvaccination grows in part from continuing fears about a future\nbioterrorist attack. Now, 9 months after the September 11th attacks,\nmore than 4 in 10 (43 percent) report being worried about a future\nattack using smallpox, down from 53 percent in November 2001. About\nhalf (49 percent) of women, compared with 36 percent of men, are\ncurrently worried about such an attack.\nThe interest in vaccination may also reflect Americans' familiarity\nwith the smallpox vaccine. Nearly 3 in 5 Americans (56 percent)\nreport having been vaccinated earlier in their lives. In the near\nrun, the public sees little risk that they or a family member will\nget smallpox. Only 1 in 12 Americans (8 percent) believes that they\nor someone in their immediate family is likely to contract smallpox\nduring the next 12 months. This compares with [1 in 5] 20 percent who\nbelieve they or a family member are likely to be injured in some\nother type of terrorist attack.\nMost Americans (74 percent) are at least mildly optimistic that they\nwould survive if they contracted smallpox and received immediate\nmedical care, 44 percent see it as very likely that they would\nsurvive, while 30 percent thought it somewhat likely.\nThe public is also somewhat optimistic that adequate planning,\npreparation, and professional education have taken place in their\ncommunity in regards to a possible smallpox attack. Most Americans\n(84 percent) report confidence that their own doctor can recognize\nthe symptoms of smallpox. Almost half (45 percent) are very\nconfident. [Really! - Mod.JW]\nAbout 2/3 of Americans (70 percent) believe that their local hospital\nemergency room is prepared to diagnose and treat people who have\nsmallpox. However, this includes only 23 percent who think their\nlocal ER is very prepared. Similarly, 2/3 (66 percent) are confident\nthat their local health department is prepared to prevent smallpox\nfrom spreading if there were an outbreak of the disease, but this\nincludes only 19 percent who think the local health department is\nvery prepared. If they had symptoms of what they thought might be\nsmallpox, most Americans would seek help from the traditional health\ncare system. The most common place to turn for diagnosis or treatment\nwould be their own doctor or medical clinic (83 percent), followed by\na hospital emergency room (62 percent) or outpatient department (52\npercent). Very few Americans (27 percent) would seek assistance from\na public health department clinic.\nThe survey finds that there is no single spokesperson the public most\ntrusts on these issues. When asked, in the event of an outbreak of\ndisease caused by bioterrorism, which of 6 public officials they\ntrusted most to provide correct information about how to protect\nthemselves and their families from the disease, 43 percent said a\nsenior scientist from the Centers for Disease Control.\nNo other official was chosen by more than 16 percent. The other\nchoices were the heads of the Department of Health and Human\nServices, Office of Homeland Security, and FBI, the U.S. Surgeon\nGeneral, and the city or state health commissioner. Asked whom they\ntrusted most to provide correct information about where to go if they\nwere exposed to a disease caused by bioterrorism, Americans were\nnearly evenly split between the CDC (28 percent) and their city or\nstate health commissioner (26 percent); 19 percent chose the head of\nthe Department of Health and Human Services.\nAmericans' knowledge about smallpox is mixed. More than 3/4 (85\npercent) know that smallpox is contagious. Many believe that smallpox\nis easily spread. For instance, 90 percent know that if someone has\ncontracted smallpox and has the symptoms, they should be kept\nisolated from uninfected people.\nHowever, less than half (43 percent) of Americans know that if a\nperson has been exposed to smallpox but does not have symptoms,\ngetting a vaccination would prevent the person from coming down with\nthe disease. Only about 1/3 (32 percent) know that once a person\ndevelops symptoms of smallpox, there is no cure. 'This is the central\nissue for public health education,' said Blendon. 'Americans need to\nknow that according to experts, if people are exposed to smallpox but\ndo not yet have symptoms, an immediate vaccination will help protect\nthem against the disease. The message is that you should not wait\nuntil you get sick. If you have been exposed, go get vaccinated right\naway, because once the symptoms start, there is no treatment to stop\nthe course of the disease.'\nSince the Fall of 2001 there have been only a few changes in\nAmericans' behavior in response to bioterrorist threats. Most\nAmericans continue to believe that in the near run they or someone in\ntheir immediate family is unlikely to contract anthrax or smallpox.\nCurrently, 10 percent think they or a family member is likely to\ncontract anthrax during the next 12 months, down slightly from 14\npercent in October 2001 shortly after anthrax-laden mail was first\ndiscovered, but nearly identical to the 9 percent figure in\nNovember-December 2001.\nThe proportion of Americans believing that they or a family member is\nlikely to contract smallpox during the next year has remained\nvirtually unchanged: 9 percent in October 2001, 8 percent in\nNovember-December 2001, and 8 percent currently.\nDecreases have been seen in the proportion of Americans who:\n- are taking mail precautions (from 37 percent in October 2001 to 24\npercent in May 2002)\n- are avoiding public places and consulting a website for information\nabout how to protect themselves in case of bioterrorism (from 12\npercent each in October 2001 to 7 percent and 8 percent,\nrespectively, in May 2002).\nOf note, there has been a significant rise, from 5 percent in October\n2001 to 15 percent in May 2002, in the proportion of Americans who\nreport that they or someone in their family has gotten a prescription\nfor or purchased antibiotics in response to concern about\nbioterrorism. This suggests that some Americans are stockpiling\nantibiotics in case of a future bioterrorist attack.\nMethodology & survey data is available at:\n<http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/press/releases/press652002.html>\n--\nProMED\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n........................................jw/pg/lm\n*##########################################################*\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.

Drops Smallpox Stocks Destruction\n-------------------------------------------\nGENEVA (AP) -- Acting on fears of bioterrorism, the 191 World Health\nOrganization members on Saturday formally reversed a long-standing order\nfor the destruction of all smallpox virus stocks and recommended they be\nretained for research into new vaccines or treatment.\nThe World Health Assembly, the U.N. health agency's top decision-making\nbody, decided to back an earlier recommendation by WHO Director-General Gro\nHarlem Brundtland to drop a 2002 deadline for destroying the virus, held at\ntop security laboratories in the United States and Russia.\nIn January, the WHO's 32-member Executive Board approved Brundtland's\npolicy. Late Friday, a World Health Assembly committee representing all\nmember nations also backed the move.\nUnder the ruling, no new target has been set for destroying the stocks,\nwhich are held at 2 secure laboratories at the U.S. Centers for Disease\nControl and Prevention in Atlanta and a similar Russian facility in\nSiberia. The virus stocks will instead be retained for research into new\nvaccines or treatment for smallpox. The World Health Assembly will receive\nupdates on the research at its annual meetings.\nU.S. assistant surgeon general Kenneth Bernard told the assembly that\nsmallpox research was necessary because the ``events of Sept. 11 have\nunderscored the extent that terrorists are willing to go to.''\n``In recent years, experts have come to see smallpox as a No. 1 deadly\nthreat,'' and the danger of deliberate use was ``small but growing,'' he\nsaid. ``We regard the potential release of smallpox as a critical national\nsecurity issue, not only for us but for the entire world.''\nResearch also would help people suffering from HIV/AIDS, whose weakened\nimmune systems could not stand existing smallpox vaccines, he added.\nThe assembly said that full research results should be made available to\nall WHO member nations. WHO officials said that decision came after\ndeveloping countries on the assembly said they feared rich nations would\nkeep the results to themselves.\nSmallpox used to kill 3 million to 4 million people per year and left\nmillions more hideously scarred and blind. It was declared eradicated in\n1979 after a massive WHO-spearheaded campaign, and the virus samples were\nplaced in the U.S. and Russian laboratories.\nIn 1996, WHO set a target of mid-1999 for destruction of the virus. But\nafter U.S. and Russian resistance, it extended the deadline to the end of\nthis year.\nChina previously had called for the destruction of the stocks, claiming\ntheir very existence presented an enormous risk to the world. But the\nChinese delegation agreed to drop the deadline, provided the research was\ncompleted as soon as possible and a new date was set for destruction at a\nlater meeting of the assembly.\nAlthough international teams carry out regular checks of the virus storage\nfacilities to ensure maximum security standards, there have been\nlong-standing fears that samples may have found their way into the hands of\nnations including North Korea or Iraq.\nRussian officials, however, told the assembly that the stocks in their\nlaboratory were completely secure and dismissed the idea that virus samples\ncould be stolen.\n--\nGeorge A.

OraVax has been awarded a\n20-year contract from the CDC as prime contractor to develop and\nmanufacture a new smallpox vaccine and has estimated the total amount of\nthe contract at $343 million. The vaccine will be used to create a national\ncivil defense stockpile for the purpose of countering the threat of\nbioterrorism.\nTo support this program, BioReliance has agreed to provide GMP, large-scale\nmanufacturing services for the bulk drug and final drug product as well as\ntesting services to support the development and production of the vaccine.\nThe prime contract calls for the initial production of a 40 million dose\nstockpile. The first deliveries of licensed vaccine to the stockpile are\nanticipated by OraVax in mid-2004. The contract also requires sustained\nproduction through the life of the contract both to replace out-dated doses\nand to be able to respond to increased demand on need. During the first\nphase of the contract- award through FDA approval-development is to be\nfunded on a cost-plus-fixed fee basis, subsequent to which the deliverables\nunder the contract will be on the basis of a firm-fixed-price.\nThis civil defense contract is an integral part of the U.S. government\ninitiative to protect the country against the hostile use of biological\nagents.

But the\nrecommendations of the World Health Assembly, the organization's governing\nbody, reflected widespread agreement that more time is needed to study\nsmallpox before it is irrevocably destroyed.\nThe assembly's recommendations are to be officially adopted next week, a\nstep that officials of the organization said was usually a formality.\nIn Friday's debate, representatives of 25 nations spoke, many of them\nreluctantly affirming the need for a stay of execution for the virus. It\nwould be the third that the virus has received since the 191-member\norganization decided in 1980 to destroy the known stocks.\nFriday's resolution also calls for the creation of an international\ncommittee of experts to advise on the need for further research and to\ndevise an eradication timetable.\nThe decision reflects a major shift in scientific thinking about smallpox\nsince 1996, when the assembly decided that the virus should be destroyed at\nthe end of June 1999. It also highlighted an unusual consensus between the\nUnited States and Russia, the countries with the two remaining declared\nrepositories of the deadly stocks.\nWashington and Moscow have publicly opposed eradication of the virus until\nmore research has been done.\nThough smallpox was officially declared eradicated as a disease in 1980,\nmost officials now acknowledge that there are probably clandestine stocks\nof smallpox virus throughout the world, and that retaining the virus could\nspeed the development of new drugs to fight a possible outbreak, whether\ndue to terrorism or other factors.\nHealth and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala, who led the American\ndelegation at the assembly, said the threat of biological terrorism, which\nwas 'obscure' only a few years ago, had emerged as among 'the thorniest\nproblems of the post-cold-war era.'\nMs. Shalala said the growing threat required international health officials\nto 'change and adapt our response' and to coordinate efforts to 'prepare\nfor an incident that we hope will never happen.'\nA turning point in official American thinking about the virus's fate came\nin March, when an independent scientific committee concluded that research\non the deadly virus could provide important scientific and medical\nopportunities that would be lost if it was destroyed. While that committee\nwas not asked whether the virus should be kept or destroyed, its\nconclusions influenced President Clinton's decision to fight for at least\ntemporary retention.\nWestern and foreign officials said fear of a possible epidemic in a now\nlargely unvaccinated world and a recent report from a senior Soviet\ndefector had helped produce the new consensus against immediate\neradication. The defector said the Soviet Union had secretly filled\nwarheads of some of its intercontinental ballistic missiles with smallpox\nvirus, violating a treaty it signed in 1972.\nIn an interview this week in Washington, Lev S. Sandakhchiev, the director\nof Russia's State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology, where\nsmallpox strains are stored, would not comment on former Soviet germ\nwarfare programs. But he said he was certain that North Korea, among other\ncountries, was secretly keeping smallpox stocks.\nDestroying the virus would complicate efforts to develop new drugs to\ncounter an outbreak, he said.\nDr. Sandakhchiev said an outbreak of monkey pox, a virus closely related to\nsmallpox, last year in Congo had prompted Moscow to redouble its efforts to\ndefer eradication.\nThe implications of that outbreak of more than 300 cases of a disease that\ntraditionally does not spread quickly among humans has been debated by\nscientists within and outside Russia. The outbreak, he argued, showed that\na new form of smallpox might be evolving.\nDonald A. Henderson, a former deputy science adviser to the White House who\nled the campaign to destroy the virus, disagreed that the outbreak in Congo\nsuggested that smallpox was making a comeback in a milder form. Many of the\ncases in Congo, he said, turned out to be chickenpox, not monkey pox.\nHe and other advocates of immediate destruction of the smallpox virus vowed\nFriday to 'continue fighting.' They argue that little research has been\ndone since the disease was declared eradicated. They discount the notion\nthat governments will spend precious research dollars on studies of a\ndisease that no longer exists.\n[Written by: JUDITH MILLER and LAWRENCE K.

Vardas' message, comments that\ncan be found as a footnote to that message]. I would like to know the\nenvironmental temperature and conditions under which the bodies have remained.\n1. There is a paper showing that infected scabs containing 2.8 x 10 trillion\nplauq-forming units per gram became negative on culture [were not shown to\ncontain virus] at nine weeks when kept at room temperature (25.8C to 26.4C)\nand 85-90% relative humidity (Huq F. Effect of temperature and relative\nhumidity on variola virus in crusts. Bull WHO. 1976; 54:710-12).\n2. Interesting also is the tale of stored smallpox scabs [that had been]\ncollected by variolators (persons who took scabs of smallpox patients and\ninserted them into the skin or nose of healthy persons to elicit protection\nagainst smallpox) who collected scabs from smallpox patients in Afghanistan,\nEthiopia and Pakistan between 1969 and 1976. Forty one of 45 samples failed\nto yield variola virus on culture. Of the four positives, two had been\ncollected from patients within the preceding nine months; the interval was\nunknown for the other two. Interviews with the variolators indicated that\nthey rarely found it possible to retain viable material for more than a year\nand none considered material collected more than two years before to be\neffective. A discussion of this and related issues is in Breman J and Arita\nI (The confirmation and maintenance of smallpox eradication, New England\nJournal of Medicine. 1980; 303:1263-73).\n3. To assuage public [South African] concern, it would be useful to collect\nspecimens from the exhumed bodies for various virological analyses. A record\nof environmental conditions [under which the bodies had been stored] is\nneeded. I would advise those taking and dealing with the specimens to be\nsuccessfully vaccinated against smallpox.\n---\nJoel Breman\nFogarty International Center\nNational Institutes of Health\ne-mail: <BremanJ@ficod.fic.nih.gov>\n[So, Frank Fenner thinks the risks 'are vanishingly remote' and Joel Breman\nagrees but suggests vaccination against smallpox. Our readers should realize\nthat Drs. Fenner and Breman are two of the world's experts on this and other\nviruses. They are writing in their usual, scientifically appropriate, very\nconservative style. Joel's suggestion of vaccination is intended (I have\ncommunicated with him about this) to assuage any fear or public concern about\ndigging up this cemetery, not because he sees any real threat to either the\nworkers or the population at large. Should one or more worker become ill\nwithin a week or three of exhuming the graves and taking specimens, prior\nsuccessful vaccination will neutralize any such public fears and\nunequivocally rule out smallpox. Not only is the rate of adverse events\nafter smallpox vaccination very low but I have been assured by other sources\nthat there already are laboratory workers in South Africa who have been\nvaccinated against and are immune to smallpox.\nJoel concluded a message to me by saying: 'While there may be other opinions,\nto me this is the best way to enlist public support and maintain credibility\nthat smallpox is gone and will not reappear from graveyards or elsewhere.'\nFair enough. Let's leave the rest of this to the South Africans.-- Mod CHC]\n.............................................................................\n--\n*##########################################################*\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.

There they will be pressure-cooked\nfor a half-hour longer than the 15 minutes needed to destroy them.\nSmallpox was eradicated from the wild in 1980. But in a series of recent\narticles and interviews, Dr. Ken Alibek, a former Soviet biowarfare expert\nwho defected in 1992, discloses what U.S. intelligence has long known:\nDestruction of the virus may not be so easy. The Soviet biowarfare\napparatus considered smallpox their No. 1 strategic weapon. They\naerosolized it, weaponized it, grew it by the ton. Despite Russian\nPresident Boris N. Yeltsin's 1992 declaration that he would shut down the\nRussian biological warfare program, ambitious, double-edged research with\nsmallpox continues today [Alibek alleges].\nTwo [US] intelligence officers independently confirmed that the Russians\nhave not kept the virus to themselves. In defiance of the Biological and\nToxin Weapons Convention, which the Soviets signed in 1972, stocks of\nvariola [smallpox] virus have been passed to North Korea and, perhaps, to\nother states as well.\nThere are powerful medical and scientific reasons for keeping the virus.\nNobel laureate Dr. Joshua Lederberg of Rockefeller University and Dr. Alan\nP. Zelicoff of Sandia National Laboratories [both in the USA] insist that\nthe live virus has a great deal to teach us about the workings of the human\nimmune system, which it can outmaneuver in singular ways. Merely knowing\nthe sequence of viral genes cannot teach us how the virus operates in the\nhuman body, or why it appears to have incorporated genes from our immune\nsystem into its genetic makeup.\nA U.S. researcher who visited the Biopreparat laboratory at Novosibirsk in\nSiberia in the mid-1980s learned that scientists there were working with\nthe virus. A later observer, Dr. Frank J. Malinoski, places smallpox at\nNovosibirsk by 1991. But the World Health Organization did not grant Russia\npermission to move the stocks from Moscow until 1994.\nMoreover, Alibek says the Soviet weaponization of smallpox long predated\nits arrival in Novosibirsk. Researchers at a secret military laboratory,\nknown as Sergiyev Posad in Zagorsk, began weaponizing smallpox in the 1960s\nand continued at least through the '80s. This means the supply of virus has\nnever been contained in Russia.\nDr. Lev S. Sandakchiev (who once ran the Soviet viral biowarfare program at\nNovosibirsk) and his colleague Sergei N. Shchelkunov, in particular, tried\nto ferret out the 'virulence factors' from the smallpox virus, to determine\nwhy the human vaccine virus, vaccinia, gives you a little pustule and 10\nyears of\\immunity, while smallpox kills you or disfigures you for life.\nThis isn't necessarily malignant -- such research can teach us a great\ndeal about human immune function. But other work is less ambiguous. A\nsenior U.S. government analyst reports that ... based on eyewitness\naccounts, Russians have produced, weaponized and tested on prisoners\nvaccine-resistant strains.\nAlibek's recent revelations on smallpox are no surprise to the\nintelligence community, which has known about smallpox weaponization\nbefore the destruction debates began in 1993. The mystery is why the public\nhas been led to believe that something that's been weaponized, proliferated\nand cultivated can be wiped out by decision, edict or ceremonial burning.\nAn official [US] government decision, set for April 30, was postponed until\nthe National Academy of Sciences holds a symposium on destruction, probably\nin the fall.\nWritten by: Wendy Orent [Excerpted by - Mod.JW]\n--\nProMED-mail\ne-mail: promed@usa.healthnet.org\n[No comment. - Mod.JW]\n...........................................jw/es\n--\n*##########################################################*\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.
