This new H5N8 2.3.4.4b clade variant was originally detected in poultry in Iraq in May 2020 with subsequent detections in Russia and Kazakhstan. It seems likely that migratory waterfowl played a key role in the incursion of this virus into Europe with over 500 detections in wild birds and spillover events into commercial poultry and captive birds.\n\nThis situation report provides an overview of the virological, epidemiological, and ornithological characteristics of this new epizootic, which involves H5N8, H5N5 and H5N1 subtypes suggesting local reassortment with wild bird Eurasian avian LPAI genes. We describe the geographical distribution and the variety of avian hosts demonstrating susceptibility to this emerging virus.\n\nThe 582 detections of HPAI H5 comprise 35 detections in poultry (6%), 8 in captive birds (1%) and 539 wild bird events (93%). Previous epizootics in Europe have had varied clinical and epidemiological presentations; the 2016/17 H5N8 epizootic affected both wild birds and poultry with over 2800 events recorded between October 2016 and July 2017. The H5N6 epizootic in 2017/18 primarily affected wild birds (80 events) with only 7 events in poultry and captive flocks.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nAdam Brouwer\nAnimal and Plant Health Agency - OIE/FAO International Reference Laboratory for Avian Influenza\nAPHA-Weybridge, UK\n<adam.brouwer@apha.gov.uk>\n\n[The authors of the above useful APHA situation report are Adam Brouwer, Nicola Lewis, Elliot Whittard, David Stroud, Ashley Banyard, Rowena Hansen, and Ian Brown. We are indebted to the submitter and his peers.\n\nThe following section, excerpted from the above-cited report, deserves inclusion:\n\nH5 HPAI (2.3.4.4b of putative African origin for some gene segments) was present in European poultry from 2 Jan 2020 to the last detection on 4 Jun 2020, with H5N8 detected in Eastern Europe with extensive spread within poultry in Hungary (276 events) and Poland (35 events).\n\nThere were 6 detections in wild birds of a closely related virus to the poultry-associated H5N8 between Jan and Mar 2020 suggesting a relatively low incidence in wild birds.\n\nIraq reported H5N8 in poultry in May 2020 with a new H5N8 2.3.4.4b clade variant genetically distinct from the previous 2020 strains in Europe. Genetically similar H5N8 viruses were subsequently detected in southern central Russia, northern Kazakhstan and south-western Russia. In western Europe, HPAI H5 in wild birds was suspected when there was an initial detection in Eurasian wigeons in the Netherlands on 16 Oct 2020 with disease confirmed on 27 Oct with one bird positive for H5N8 and 4 positive for H5N1. The H5N8 virus was similar to that reported in Russia, Kazakhstan and Iraq whilst the H5N1 characterisation suggested local reassortment with wild bird Eurasian avian LPAI genes. Detections in poultry followed with initial H5N8 cases in the Netherlands and the UK submitted to national reference laboratories on 28 Oct and 2 Nov 2020, respectively. Subsequently there has been a substantial increase in cases (principally H5N8) in wild birds particularly in northern Europe and spillover events to commercial poultry and captive birds involving reports from 14 European countries to date [28 Nov 2020].\n\nNearly all detections of HPAI H5 in wild birds have been found close to coastlines with significant clusters of cases in the Jutland peninsula and within the extensive Wadden Sea -- a continuous intertidal wetland stretching from Denmark to the Netherlands and where many of the Danish, German and Dutch cases occurred. However, wild bird cases also occurred in inland areas in those and other countries, with a 2nd cluster of wild bird detections in the Netherlands.\n\nThe lack of detections in other countries in Northern Europe does not imply that HPAIv is absent -- rather that a combination of varied disease prevalence and the sensitivity of wild bird surveillance programmes has inhibited detection thus far.\n\n---\nThe report includes a table presenting details of the 582 reported HPAI H5 disease events in Europe, 27 Oct - 28 Nov 2020, for the 14 addressed European countries. -

2020\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nA total of 582 detections of HPAI H5 have been reported in Europe between 27 Oct 2020 and 28 Nov 2020. This new H5N8 2.3.4.4b clade variant was originally detected in poultry in Iraq in May 2020 with subsequent detections in Russia and Kazakhstan. It seems likely that migratory waterfowl played a key role in the incursion of this virus into Europe with over 500 detections in wild birds and spillover events into commercial poultry and captive birds.\n\nThis situation report provides an overview of the virological, epidemiological, and ornithological characteristics of this new epizootic, which involves H5N8, H5N5 and H5N1 subtypes suggesting local reassortment with wild bird Eurasian avian LPAI genes. We describe the geographical distribution and the variety of avian hosts demonstrating susceptibility to this emerging virus.\n\nThe 582 detections of HPAI H5 comprise 35 detections in poultry (6%), 8 in captive birds (1%) and 539 wild bird events (93%). Previous epizootics in Europe have had varied clinical and epidemiological presentations; the 2016/17 H5N8 epizootic affected both wild birds and poultry with over 2800 events recorded between October 2016 and July 2017. The H5N6 epizootic in 2017/18 primarily affected wild birds (80 events) with only 7 events in poultry and captive flocks.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nAdam Brouwer\nAnimal and Plant Health Agency - OIE/FAO International Reference Laboratory for Avian Influenza\nAPHA-Weybridge, UK\n<adam.brouwer@apha.gov.uk>\n\n[The authors of the above useful APHA situation report are Adam Brouwer, Nicola Lewis, Elliot Whittard, David Stroud, Ashley Banyard, Rowena Hansen, and Ian Brown. We are indebted to the submitter and his peers.\n\nThe following section, excerpted from the above-cited report, deserves inclusion:\n\nH5 HPAI (2.3.4.4b of putative African origin for some gene segments) was present in European poultry from 2 Jan 2020 to the last detection on 4 Jun 2020, with H5N8 detected in Eastern Europe with extensive spread within poultry in Hungary (276 events) and Poland (35 events).\n\nThere were 6 detections in wild birds of a closely related virus to the poultry-associated H5N8 between Jan and Mar 2020 suggesting a relatively low incidence in wild birds.\n\nIraq reported H5N8 in poultry in May 2020 with a new H5N8 2.3.4.4b clade variant genetically distinct from the previous 2020 strains in Europe. Genetically similar H5N8 viruses were subsequently detected in southern central Russia, northern Kazakhstan and south-western Russia. In western Europe, HPAI H5 in wild birds was suspected when there was an initial detection in Eurasian wigeons in the Netherlands on 16 Oct 2020 with disease confirmed on 27 Oct with one bird positive for H5N8 and 4 positive for H5N1. The H5N8 virus was similar to that reported in Russia, Kazakhstan and Iraq whilst the H5N1 characterisation suggested local reassortment with wild bird Eurasian avian LPAI genes. Detections in poultry followed with initial H5N8 cases in the Netherlands and the UK submitted to national reference laboratories on 28 Oct and 2 Nov 2020, respectively. Subsequently there has been a substantial increase in cases (principally H5N8) in wild birds particularly in northern Europe and spillover events to commercial poultry and captive birds involving reports from 14 European countries to date [28 Nov 2020].\n\nNearly all detections of HPAI H5 in wild birds have been found close to coastlines with significant clusters of cases in the Jutland peninsula and within the extensive Wadden Sea -- a continuous intertidal wetland stretching from Denmark to the Netherlands and where many of the Danish, German and Dutch cases occurred. However, wild bird cases also occurred in inland areas in those and other countries, with a 2nd cluster of wild bird detections in the Netherlands.\n\nThe lack of detections in other countries in Northern Europe does not imply that HPAIv is absent -- rather that a combination of varied disease prevalence and the sensitivity of wild bird surveillance programmes has inhibited detection thus far.\n\n---\nThe report includes a table presenting details of the 582 reported HPAI H5 disease events in Europe, 27 Oct - 28 Nov 2020, for the 14 addressed European countries. -

2020\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nA total of 582 detections of HPAI H5 have been reported in Europe between 27 Oct 2020 and 28 Nov 2020. This new H5N8 2.3.4.4b clade variant was originally detected in poultry in Iraq in May 2020 with subsequent detections in Russia and Kazakhstan. It seems likely that migratory waterfowl played a key role in the incursion of this virus into Europe with over 500 detections in wild birds and spillover events into commercial poultry and captive birds.\n\nThis situation report provides an overview of the virological, epidemiological, and ornithological characteristics of this new epizootic, which involves H5N8, H5N5 and H5N1 subtypes suggesting local reassortment with wild bird Eurasian avian LPAI genes. We describe the geographical distribution and the variety of avian hosts demonstrating susceptibility to this emerging virus.\n\nThe 582 detections of HPAI H5 comprise 35 detections in poultry (6%), 8 in captive birds (1%) and 539 wild bird events (93%). Previous epizootics in Europe have had varied clinical and epidemiological presentations; the 2016/17 H5N8 epizootic affected both wild birds and poultry with over 2800 events recorded between October 2016 and July 2017. The H5N6 epizootic in 2017/18 primarily affected wild birds (80 events) with only 7 events in poultry and captive flocks.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nAdam Brouwer\nAnimal and Plant Health Agency - OIE/FAO International Reference Laboratory for Avian Influenza\nAPHA-Weybridge, UK\n<adam.brouwer@apha.gov.uk>\n\n[The authors of the above useful APHA situation report are Adam Brouwer, Nicola Lewis, Elliot Whittard, David Stroud, Ashley Banyard, Rowena Hansen, and Ian Brown. We are indebted to the submitter and his peers.\n\nThe following section, excerpted from the above-cited report, deserves inclusion:\n\nH5 HPAI (2.3.4.4b of putative African origin for some gene segments) was present in European poultry from 2 Jan 2020 to the last detection on 4 Jun 2020, with H5N8 detected in Eastern Europe with extensive spread within poultry in Hungary (276 events) and Poland (35 events).\n\nThere were 6 detections in wild birds of a closely related virus to the poultry-associated H5N8 between Jan and Mar 2020 suggesting a relatively low incidence in wild birds.\n\nIraq reported H5N8 in poultry in May 2020 with a new H5N8 2.3.4.4b clade variant genetically distinct from the previous 2020 strains in Europe. Genetically similar H5N8 viruses were subsequently detected in southern central Russia, northern Kazakhstan and south-western Russia. In western Europe, HPAI H5 in wild birds was suspected when there was an initial detection in Eurasian wigeons in the Netherlands on 16 Oct 2020 with disease confirmed on 27 Oct with one bird positive for H5N8 and 4 positive for H5N1. The H5N8 virus was similar to that reported in Russia, Kazakhstan and Iraq whilst the H5N1 characterisation suggested local reassortment with wild bird Eurasian avian LPAI genes. Detections in poultry followed with initial H5N8 cases in the Netherlands and the UK submitted to national reference laboratories on 28 Oct and 2 Nov 2020, respectively. Subsequently there has been a substantial increase in cases (principally H5N8) in wild birds particularly in northern Europe and spillover events to commercial poultry and captive birds involving reports from 14 European countries to date [28 Nov 2020].\n\nNearly all detections of HPAI H5 in wild birds have been found close to coastlines with significant clusters of cases in the Jutland peninsula and within the extensive Wadden Sea -- a continuous intertidal wetland stretching from Denmark to the Netherlands and where many of the Danish, German and Dutch cases occurred. However, wild bird cases also occurred in inland areas in those and other countries, with a 2nd cluster of wild bird detections in the Netherlands.\n\nThe lack of detections in other countries in Northern Europe does not imply that HPAIv is absent -- rather that a combination of varied disease prevalence and the sensitivity of wild bird surveillance programmes has inhibited detection thus far.\n\n---\nThe report includes a table presenting details of the 582 reported HPAI H5 disease events in Europe, 27 Oct - 28 Nov 2020, for the 14 addressed European countries. -

We describe the geographical distribution and the variety of avian hosts demonstrating susceptibility to this emerging virus.\n\nThe 582 detections of HPAI H5 comprise 35 detections in poultry (6%), 8 in captive birds (1%) and 539 wild bird events (93%). Previous epizootics in Europe have had varied clinical and epidemiological presentations; the 2016/17 H5N8 epizootic affected both wild birds and poultry with over 2800 events recorded between October 2016 and July 2017. The H5N6 epizootic in 2017/18 primarily affected wild birds (80 events) with only 7 events in poultry and captive flocks.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nAdam Brouwer\nAnimal and Plant Health Agency - OIE/FAO International Reference Laboratory for Avian Influenza\nAPHA-Weybridge, UK\n<adam.brouwer@apha.gov.uk>\n\n[The authors of the above useful APHA situation report are Adam Brouwer, Nicola Lewis, Elliot Whittard, David Stroud, Ashley Banyard, Rowena Hansen, and Ian Brown. We are indebted to the submitter and his peers.\n\nThe following section, excerpted from the above-cited report, deserves inclusion:\n\nH5 HPAI (2.3.4.4b of putative African origin for some gene segments) was present in European poultry from 2 Jan 2020 to the last detection on 4 Jun 2020, with H5N8 detected in Eastern Europe with extensive spread within poultry in Hungary (276 events) and Poland (35 events).\n\nThere were 6 detections in wild birds of a closely related virus to the poultry-associated H5N8 between Jan and Mar 2020 suggesting a relatively low incidence in wild birds.\n\nIraq reported H5N8 in poultry in May 2020 with a new H5N8 2.3.4.4b clade variant genetically distinct from the previous 2020 strains in Europe. Genetically similar H5N8 viruses were subsequently detected in southern central Russia, northern Kazakhstan and south-western Russia. In western Europe, HPAI H5 in wild birds was suspected when there was an initial detection in Eurasian wigeons in the Netherlands on 16 Oct 2020 with disease confirmed on 27 Oct with one bird positive for H5N8 and 4 positive for H5N1. The H5N8 virus was similar to that reported in Russia, Kazakhstan and Iraq whilst the H5N1 characterisation suggested local reassortment with wild bird Eurasian avian LPAI genes. Detections in poultry followed with initial H5N8 cases in the Netherlands and the UK submitted to national reference laboratories on 28 Oct and 2 Nov 2020, respectively. Subsequently there has been a substantial increase in cases (principally H5N8) in wild birds particularly in northern Europe and spillover events to commercial poultry and captive birds involving reports from 14 European countries to date [28 Nov 2020].\n\nNearly all detections of HPAI H5 in wild birds have been found close to coastlines with significant clusters of cases in the Jutland peninsula and within the extensive Wadden Sea -- a continuous intertidal wetland stretching from Denmark to the Netherlands and where many of the Danish, German and Dutch cases occurred. However, wild bird cases also occurred in inland areas in those and other countries, with a 2nd cluster of wild bird detections in the Netherlands.\n\nThe lack of detections in other countries in Northern Europe does not imply that HPAIv is absent -- rather that a combination of varied disease prevalence and the sensitivity of wild bird surveillance programmes has inhibited detection thus far.\n\n---\nThe report includes a table presenting details of the 582 reported HPAI H5 disease events in Europe, 27 Oct - 28 Nov 2020, for the 14 addressed European countries. -

2020\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nA total of 582 detections of HPAI H5 have been reported in Europe between 27 Oct 2020 and 28 Nov 2020. This new H5N8 2.3.4.4b clade variant was originally detected in poultry in Iraq in May 2020 with subsequent detections in Russia and Kazakhstan. It seems likely that migratory waterfowl played a key role in the incursion of this virus into Europe with over 500 detections in wild birds and spillover events into commercial poultry and captive birds.\n\nThis situation report provides an overview of the virological, epidemiological, and ornithological characteristics of this new epizootic, which involves H5N8, H5N5 and H5N1 subtypes suggesting local reassortment with wild bird Eurasian avian LPAI genes. We describe the geographical distribution and the variety of avian hosts demonstrating susceptibility to this emerging virus.\n\nThe 582 detections of HPAI H5 comprise 35 detections in poultry (6%), 8 in captive birds (1%) and 539 wild bird events (93%). Previous epizootics in Europe have had varied clinical and epidemiological presentations; the 2016/17 H5N8 epizootic affected both wild birds and poultry with over 2800 events recorded between October 2016 and July 2017. The H5N6 epizootic in 2017/18 primarily affected wild birds (80 events) with only 7 events in poultry and captive flocks.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nAdam Brouwer\nAnimal and Plant Health Agency - OIE/FAO International Reference Laboratory for Avian Influenza\nAPHA-Weybridge, UK\n<adam.brouwer@apha.gov.uk>\n\n[The authors of the above useful APHA situation report are Adam Brouwer, Nicola Lewis, Elliot Whittard, David Stroud, Ashley Banyard, Rowena Hansen, and Ian Brown. We are indebted to the submitter and his peers.\n\nThe following section, excerpted from the above-cited report, deserves inclusion:\n\nH5 HPAI (2.3.4.4b of putative African origin for some gene segments) was present in European poultry from 2 Jan 2020 to the last detection on 4 Jun 2020, with H5N8 detected in Eastern Europe with extensive spread within poultry in Hungary (276 events) and Poland (35 events).\n\nThere were 6 detections in wild birds of a closely related virus to the poultry-associated H5N8 between Jan and Mar 2020 suggesting a relatively low incidence in wild birds.\n\nIraq reported H5N8 in poultry in May 2020 with a new H5N8 2.3.4.4b clade variant genetically distinct from the previous 2020 strains in Europe. Genetically similar H5N8 viruses were subsequently detected in southern central Russia, northern Kazakhstan and south-western Russia. In western Europe, HPAI H5 in wild birds was suspected when there was an initial detection in Eurasian wigeons in the Netherlands on 16 Oct 2020 with disease confirmed on 27 Oct with one bird positive for H5N8 and 4 positive for H5N1. The H5N8 virus was similar to that reported in Russia, Kazakhstan and Iraq whilst the H5N1 characterisation suggested local reassortment with wild bird Eurasian avian LPAI genes. Detections in poultry followed with initial H5N8 cases in the Netherlands and the UK submitted to national reference laboratories on 28 Oct and 2 Nov 2020, respectively. Subsequently there has been a substantial increase in cases (principally H5N8) in wild birds particularly in northern Europe and spillover events to commercial poultry and captive birds involving reports from 14 European countries to date [28 Nov 2020].\n\nNearly all detections of HPAI H5 in wild birds have been found close to coastlines with significant clusters of cases in the Jutland peninsula and within the extensive Wadden Sea -- a continuous intertidal wetland stretching from Denmark to the Netherlands and where many of the Danish, German and Dutch cases occurred. However, wild bird cases also occurred in inland areas in those and other countries, with a 2nd cluster of wild bird detections in the Netherlands.\n\nThe lack of detections in other countries in Northern Europe does not imply that HPAIv is absent -- rather that a combination of varied disease prevalence and the sensitivity of wild bird surveillance programmes has inhibited detection thus far.\n\n---\nThe report includes a table presenting details of the 582 reported HPAI H5 disease events in Europe, 27 Oct - 28 Nov 2020, for the 14 addressed European countries. -

Throat swabs of the deceased had been sent to the World Health Organisation's Collaborating Centre for Influenza in Japan, which confirmed that he had contracted influenza A(H5N1), which caused his death.\n\nFollowing the confirmation of deadly virus responsible for the death, health experts from the WHO's headquarters and its regional office in New Delhi, India arrived in Kathmandu to assist Nepali health officials to carry out an epidemiological investigation.\n\nAccording to Lal, his office would send samples to the country recommended by the UN health agency. Earlier, WHO officials suggested that specimens be sent to the Collaborating Center for Influenza in Japan that confirmed the virus. Such labs are in several countries and the UN health body may recommend any one of them. \"We are working closely with them and will decide our next step accordingly,\" said Lal.\n\nThe division has secured all collected samples in the biosafety level-3 laboratory of the National Public Health Laboratory.\n\nHealth officials say it takes time to send samples to laboratories abroad, as manpower trained to handle the biohazard are required for that.\n\nAirlines do not easily carry such specimens and for that, protocols of international health regulations need to be followed, according to officials at the Health Ministry.\n\nMeanwhile, the ministry said it was still tracking some people, who came in contact with the deceased but are out of home for personal business.\n\nThe death of the 21-year-old from H5N1 virus, the 1st bird flu casualty in Nepal and 1st in the world since February 2017, has been a cause for concern. H5N1 is a lethal bird flu virus strain that is highly pathogenic.\n\n[Byline: Arjun Poudel]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n[According to WHO guidance on regulations for the Transport of Infectious Substances 2015-2016.

Throat swabs of the deceased had been sent to the World Health Organisation's Collaborating Centre for Influenza in Japan, which confirmed that he had contracted influenza A(H5N1), which caused his death.\n\nFollowing the confirmation of deadly virus responsible for the death, health experts from the WHO's headquarters and its regional office in New Delhi, India arrived in Kathmandu to assist Nepali health officials to carry out an epidemiological investigation.\n\nAccording to Lal, his office would send samples to the country recommended by the UN health agency. Earlier, WHO officials suggested that specimens be sent to the Collaborating Center for Influenza in Japan that confirmed the virus. Such labs are in several countries and the UN health body may recommend any one of them. \"We are working closely with them and will decide our next step accordingly,\" said Lal.\n\nThe division has secured all collected samples in the biosafety level-3 laboratory of the National Public Health Laboratory.\n\nHealth officials say it takes time to send samples to laboratories abroad, as manpower trained to handle the biohazard are required for that.\n\nAirlines do not easily carry such specimens and for that, protocols of international health regulations need to be followed, according to officials at the Health Ministry.\n\nMeanwhile, the ministry said it was still tracking some people, who came in contact with the deceased but are out of home for personal business.\n\nThe death of the 21-year-old from H5N1 virus, the 1st bird flu casualty in Nepal and 1st in the world since February 2017, has been a cause for concern. H5N1 is a lethal bird flu virus strain that is highly pathogenic.\n\n[Byline: Arjun Poudel]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n[According to WHO guidance on regulations for the Transport of Infectious Substances 2015-2016.

The event was resolved on 1 Apr 2018. See event summary and updated map at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?reportid=23159.\n\n\"The Asian lineage HPAI H5N1 virus first emerged in China in 1996 and spread to Asia, Europe, Middle East, and Africa, and following ongoing evolution is now grouped under different genetic clades. Currently the virus continues to be reported in Asia and Africa in both poultry and wild birds. The virus has become enzootic in Asia and Africa and continues to cause outbreaks in poultry and sporadic human infections.\n\n\"In late 2005, the Asian lineage H5N1 was introduced to Europe and several European countries experienced outbreaks in poultry and wild birds in the subsequent years. The last outbreak of H5N1 occurred in France in 2015, but that virus was not related to the H5N1 viruses circulating in other parts of the world and appears to have evolved from a low pathogenic avian influenza virus circulating in Europe.\n\n\"In 2015, America and Canada reported novel reassortant H5N1 outbreaks with Eurasian and North American origin in poultry. This virus was also different from the H5N1 strain circulating in Asia.\n\n\"As of June 2018, 860 human infections have been reported to WHO from 16 countries and territories. All cases of H5N1 infection in humans have been associated with close contact with infected live or dead birds, or H5N1-contaminated environments. Countries affected should focus on strengthening biosecurity measures to prevent introduction of disease into flocks and avoid contact between wild birds and poultry.\"

The event was resolved on 1 Apr 2018. See event summary and updated map at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?reportid=23159.\n\n\"The Asian lineage HPAI H5N1 virus first emerged in China in 1996 and spread to Asia, Europe, Middle East, and Africa, and following ongoing evolution is now grouped under different genetic clades. Currently the virus continues to be reported in Asia and Africa in both poultry and wild birds. The virus has become enzootic in Asia and Africa and continues to cause outbreaks in poultry and sporadic human infections.\n\n\"In late 2005, the Asian lineage H5N1 was introduced to Europe and several European countries experienced outbreaks in poultry and wild birds in the subsequent years. The last outbreak of H5N1 occurred in France in 2015, but that virus was not related to the H5N1 viruses circulating in other parts of the world and appears to have evolved from a low pathogenic avian influenza virus circulating in Europe.\n\n\"In 2015, America and Canada reported novel reassortant H5N1 outbreaks with Eurasian and North American origin in poultry. This virus was also different from the H5N1 strain circulating in Asia.\n\n\"As of June 2018, 860 human infections have been reported to WHO from 16 countries and territories. All cases of H5N1 infection in humans have been associated with close contact with infected live or dead birds, or H5N1-contaminated environments. Countries affected should focus on strengthening biosecurity measures to prevent introduction of disease into flocks and avoid contact between wild birds and poultry.\"

Department of Veterinary Services on [27 Jul 2018]. Investigation and sampling were carried out on the same day. Movement of animals and animal products was banned on the same day. Upon confirmation of the laboratory of the samples positive for HPAI (H5N1), stamping out of the flock was carried out and the carcasses were officially disposed of.

The event was resolved on 1 Apr 2018. See event summary and updated map at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?reportid=23159.\n\n\"The Asian lineage HPAI H5N1 virus first emerged in China in 1996 and spread to Asia, Europe, Middle East, and Africa, and following ongoing evolution is now grouped under different genetic clades. Currently the virus continues to be reported in Asia and Africa in both poultry and wild birds. The virus has become enzootic in Asia and Africa and continues to cause outbreaks in poultry and sporadic human infections.\n\n\"In late 2005, the Asian lineage H5N1 was introduced to Europe and several European countries experienced outbreaks in poultry and wild birds in the subsequent years. The last outbreak of H5N1 occurred in France in 2015, but that virus was not related to the H5N1 viruses circulating in other parts of the world and appears to have evolved from a low pathogenic avian influenza virus circulating in Europe.\n\n\"In 2015, America and Canada reported novel reassortant H5N1 outbreaks with Eurasian and North American origin in poultry. This virus was also different from the H5N1 strain circulating in Asia.\n\n\"As of June 2018, 860 human infections have been reported to WHO from 16 countries and territories. All cases of H5N1 infection in humans have been associated with close contact with infected live or dead birds, or H5N1-contaminated environments. Countries affected should focus on strengthening biosecurity measures to prevent introduction of disease into flocks and avoid contact between wild birds and poultry.\"

The virus has become enzootic in Asia and Africa and continues to cause outbreaks in poultry and sporadic human infections.\n\n\"In late 2005, the Asian lineage H5N1 was introduced to Europe and several European countries experienced outbreaks in poultry and wild birds in the subsequent years. The last outbreak of H5N1 occurred in France in 2015, but that virus was not related to the H5N1 viruses circulating in other parts of the world and appears to have evolved from a low pathogenic avian influenza virus circulating in Europe.\n\n\"In 2015, America and Canada reported novel reassortant H5N1 outbreaks with Eurasian and North American origin in poultry. This virus was also different from the H5N1 strain circulating in Asia.\n\n\"As of June 2018, 860 human infections have been reported to WHO from 16 countries and territories. All cases of H5N1 infection in humans have been associated with close contact with infected live or dead birds, or H5N1-contaminated environments.

Department of Veterinary Services on [27 Jul 2018]. Investigation and sampling were carried out on the same day. Movement of animals and animal products was banned on the same day. Upon confirmation of the laboratory of the samples positive for HPAI (H5N1), stamping out of the flock was carried out and the carcasses were officially disposed of. This is the 1st occurrence of HPAI in Sabah state. Sabah is a state of Malaysia located at East Malaysia, on the island of Borneo. Sabah and Peninsular Malaysia are separated by the South China Sea.\n\nControl measures\nMeasures applied: movement control inside the country, surveillance outside containment and/or protection zone, surveillance within containment and/or protection zone, screening, quarantine, official disposal of carcasses, by-products and waste, stamping out, zoning, disinfection, vaccination prohibited, no treatment of affected animals\nMeasures to be applied: no other measures\n\nDiagnostic test results\nLaboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result\nSabah Veterinary Laboratory (regional reference laboratory) / Birds / polymerase chain reaction (PCR) / 30 Jul 2018 / Positive\nVeterinary Research Institute Ipoh Perak (regional reference laboratory) / Birds / inoculation test / 5 Aug 2018 / Positive\n\nFuture reporting\nThe event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.\n\n[The location of the outbreak can be seen on the interactive map included in the OIE report at the source URL above.]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[In February 2017, Malaysia reported 36 outbreaks of HPAI H5N1 in the state of Kelantan (Peninsular Malaysia). The event was resolved on 1 Apr 2018. See event summary and updated map at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?reportid=23159.\n\n\"The Asian lineage HPAI H5N1 virus first emerged in China in 1996 and spread to Asia, Europe, Middle East, and Africa, and following ongoing evolution is now grouped under different genetic clades. Currently the virus continues to be reported in Asia and Africa in both poultry and wild birds. The virus has become enzootic in Asia and Africa and continues to cause outbreaks in poultry and sporadic human infections.\n\n\"In late 2005, the Asian lineage H5N1 was introduced to Europe and several European countries experienced outbreaks in poultry and wild birds in the subsequent years. The last outbreak of H5N1 occurred in France in 2015, but that virus was not related to the H5N1 viruses circulating in other parts of the world and appears to have evolved from a low pathogenic avian influenza virus circulating in Europe.\n\n\"In 2015, America and Canada reported novel reassortant H5N1 outbreaks with Eurasian and North American origin in poultry. This virus was also different from the H5N1 strain circulating in Asia.\n\n\"As of June 2018, 860 human infections have been reported to WHO from 16 countries and territories. All cases of H5N1 infection in humans have been associated with close contact with infected live or dead birds, or H5N1-contaminated environments. Countries affected should focus on strengthening biosecurity measures to prevent introduction of disease into flocks and avoid contact between wild birds and poultry.\"

Health officials have been closely watching developments in Egypt, because the country had an unprecedented surge of cases at about this time last year [2015].\n\nTwo of the H5N1 patients are from Giza governorate, a 70-year-old woman who is in critical condition and a 5-year-old girl who recovered. A 1-year-old girl in Sohag governorate and a 7-year-old girl in Cairo have also recovered. The 3 girls were exposed to live or dead poultry, while the investigation into the virus source is still under investigation for the older woman, the WHO said.\n\nSince 2003 the agency has recorded 850 H5N1 infections, 449 of them fatal, in 16 countries.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Most A(H5) influenza human cases have history of exposure through contact with infected poultry or contaminated environments, including live poultry markets. Since the viruses continue to be detected in animals and environments, further human cases can be expected. Even though small clusters of A(H5N1) virus infections have been reported previously, including those involving healthcare workers, current epidemiological and virological evidence suggests that the A(H5) viruses are still essentially avian and have not acquired the ability of sustained transmission among humans. - Mod.UBA\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at:

Summary [edited]\nhttp://www.who.int/influenza/human_animal_interface/HAI_Risk_Assessment/en/\n\n\nIn a monthly update on zoonotic flu strains, the World Health Organization (WHO) recently noted reports of human cases of H5N1, H5N6, and H7N9 avian flu that it received between 25 Feb and 4 Apr [2016], all of which were acknowledged in earlier reports from various official sources.\n\nThe WHO, however, included more details about 4 recent H5N1 patients in Egypt -- all female and 3 of them children, which fits with earlier patterns in the country.\n\nThe 4 Egyptian cases were previously reported but with very few epidemiologic details by the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization. Health officials have been closely watching developments in Egypt, because the country had an unprecedented surge of cases at about this time last year [2015].\n\nTwo of the H5N1 patients are from Giza governorate, a 70-year-old woman who is in critical condition and a 5-year-old girl who recovered. A 1-year-old girl in Sohag governorate and a 7-year-old girl in Cairo have also recovered. The 3 girls were exposed to live or dead poultry, while the investigation into the virus source is still under investigation for the older woman, the WHO said.\n\nSince 2003 the agency has recorded 850 H5N1 infections, 449 of them fatal, in 16 countries.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Most A(H5) influenza human cases have history of exposure through contact with infected poultry or contaminated environments, including live poultry markets. Since the viruses continue to be detected in animals and environments, further human cases can be expected. Even though small clusters of A(H5N1) virus infections have been reported previously, including those involving healthcare workers, current epidemiological and virological evidence suggests that the A(H5) viruses are still essentially avian and have not acquired the ability of sustained transmission among humans. - Mod.UBA\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/55.]\nSee Also\nAvian influenza, human (33): Egypt (JZ) H5N1 20160323.4114052\nAvian influenza, human (30): Egypt (Cairo) H5N1, China (GD) H5N6 20160315.4095095\nAvian influenza, human (15): Egypt (KS) H5N1 susp, RFI 20160126.3967941\nAvian influenza, human (14): Egypt A(H5N1,H9N2) CDC/EID 20160122.3956280\nAvian influenza, human (11): China (SC) H5N1 20160114.3936791\nAvian influenza, human (03): Egypt (BA) H5N1 20160106.3915791\n2015\n----\nAvian influenza, human (132): Algeria (TB) H5N1, susp, RFI 20151219.3873849\nAvian influenza, human (113): Turkey, susp, H5N1, RFI 20150712.3504366\nAvian influenza (140): Egypt, poultry, HPAI H5N1, control, revision 20150530.3397148\nAvian influenza, human (112): Egypt, H5N1 cases 20150624.3462638\nAvian influenza, human (104): Egypt H5N1 20150516.3366602\nAvian influenza, human (97): Egypt, H5N1 20150430.3334280\nAvian influenza, human (96): ECDC update 20150429.3331669\nAvian influenza, human (94): Egypt, FAO update H5N1 20150421.3310680\nAvian influenza, human (92): ECDC update, H5N1 genetics 20150413.3295430\nAvian influenza, human (55): Egypt (FY) H5N1, virus volatility, preparedness 20150226.3195148\nAvian influenza, human (52): Egypt (DQ) H5N1 fatality 20150224.3187488\nAvian influenza, human (46): Egypt (FY, AT) H5N1 20150216.3170598\nAvian influenza, human (45): Egypt (QH,FY) H5N1 cases, tally 20150215.3168646\nAvian influenza, human (39): Egypt, H5N1, new cases 20150210.3155566\nAvian influenza, human (35): weekly update H5N1 & H7N9, China (GD) H7N9 20150205.3146067\nAvian influenza, human (29): Egypt, Nigeria, H5N1 20150130.3132222\nAvian influenza, human (25): China (JS) Egypt H5N1 20150128.3126564\nAvian influenza, human (16): Egypt (MN,AT) H5N1 fatalities 20150121.3108144\nAvian influenza, human (14): Egypt, H5N1 susp. 20150119.3103703\nAvian influenza, human (12): Egypt (MF) H5N1, susp 20150115.3095472\nAvian influenza, human (09): Egypt, H5N1, mutations, comment 20150110.3084116\nAvian influenza, human (08): Egypt, H5N1, mutations 20150109.3082553\nAvian influenza, human (01): Libya, fatal, H5N1 susp, RFI 20150101.3061029\nAvian influenza, human (16): China H7N9 (GD, JX ex GD) H5N6 20160127.3971269\nAvian influenza, human (12): China (GD) H5N6 20160118.3946852\nAvian influenza, human (07): China (GD) H5N6 20160111.3927489\nAvian influenza, human (05): China (GD) H5N6 20160108.3921314\nAvian influenza, human (04): China (GD) H5N6 20160106.3915832\nAvian influenza, human (02): China (GD) H5N6 20160105.3911192\n.................................................uba/je/dk", "reports": [{"diseases": [], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2037-03-16 00:00:00", "2003-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-11 00:00:00", "2055-03-16 00:00:00", "2052-03-16 00:00:00", "2046-03-16 00:00:00", "2045-03-16 00:00:00", "2039-03-16 00:00:00", "2035-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-25 00:00:00", "2021-03-08 00:00:00", "2021-03-01 00:00:00", "2021-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-07 00:00:00", "2021-03-05 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2021-03-02 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Cairo", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "SC", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "GD", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "EGYPT", "country": "Egypt"}, {"location": "Egypt A(H5N1,H9N2", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Egypt", "country": "Egypt"}, {"location": "FY", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Algeria", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Libya", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Nigeria", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "A(H5", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "China", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Turkey", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "JX", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "KS", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "JS", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "4136698", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Avian influenza (30): Indonesia (SE) poultry, HPAI H5N1", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=4136698", "date": "2016-01-22 05:36:39", "main_text": "AVIAN INFLUENZA, HUMAN (14): EGYPT A(H5N1, H9N2) CDC/EID\n********************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Thu 21 Jan 2016\nSource: Emerging Infectious Diseases journal [edited]\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3201/eid2203.150593\n\n\n[ref: Kayali G, El-Shesheny R, Kandeil A, et al. Avian influenza A(H5N1) virus in Egypt. Emerg Infect Dis. 2016 Mar [date cited]. DOI: 10.3201/eid2203.150593]\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nAbstract\n--------\n\"In Egypt, avian influenza A subtype H5N1 and H9N2 viruses are enzootic in poultry. The control plan devised by veterinary authorities in Egypt to prevent infections in poultry focused mainly on vaccination and ultimately failed. Recently, widespread H5N1 infections in poultry and a substantial increase in the number of human cases of H5N1 infection were observed. We summarize surveillance data from 2009 through 2014 and show that avian influenza viruses are established in poultry in Egypt and are continuously evolving genetically and antigenically. We also discuss the epidemiology of human infection with avian influenza in Egypt and describe how the true burden of disease is underestimated. We discuss the failures of relying on vaccinating poultry as the sole intervention tool. We conclude by highlighting the key components that need to be included in a new strategy to control avian influenza infections in poultry and humans in Egypt.\"\n\nHuman cases [H5N1]\n------------------\nThe paper states that \"During 2006-2015, the estimated number of confirmed human cases of H5N1 infection in Egypt was 292, with a 34 per cent case fatality rate. The number of reported cases by year for 2006-2015 shows that, before the 2014-15 winter season, the annual number of cases never exceeded 40. However, in just 2 months, January and February 2015, a total of 88 cases were reported. The most recent cases occurred in persons who reported exposure to backyard poultry (70 per cent), bred domestic birds (26 per cent), slaughtered poultry (14 per cent), or were exposed to dead birds (4 per cent)...\"\n\nExtent of avian influenza infection in Egypt\n--------------------------------------------\n\"In Egypt, the number of reported human cases of avian influenza infection appears to be underestimated. An underestimation might result in an overestimation of the case-fatality rate, but it would certainly underestimate the extent of human infection with avian influenza viruses. Results from a controlled, serologic cohort study of persons in Egypt exposed and not exposed to poultry estimated the seroprevalence of antibodies against H5N1 (titers greater than 80) at 2 per cent. If this seroprevalence were to be extrapolated to the entire poultry-exposed population in Egypt, the true number of infections would amount to several hundred thousand. These figures are even more striking when it comes to human infection with H9N2 viruses. The seroprevalence of H9N2 antibodies detected in the same cohort study ranged from 5.6 per cent to 7.5 per cent, whereas just 1 case of H9N2 infection was reported...\"\n\nProposed avian influenza control plan\n-------------------------------------\n\"The avian influenza situation in Egypt is deteriorating, evident in the fact that H5N1 and H9N2 viruses are enzootic in poultry and that incidence of H5N1 and H9N2 infection is increasing. The problem is also evident in the sharp increase in human H5N1 cases and the detection of the 1st human H9N2 case. Thus, it is imperative that authorities in Egypt devise and implement an aggressive control plan to curb the spread of disease in human and animal populations. The control plan must include the following elements: 1) mapping of the unlicensed, small-scale poultry farms that have become abundant in rural areas; 2) increasing the biosecurity levels of these small farms by using inexpensive tools; 3) revamping veterinary and public health surveillance and conducting joint human-animal interface surveillance and risk-assessment exercises; 4) encouraging poultry owners to report outbreaks and providing them appropriate compensation; 5) intervening, when poultry outbreaks are reported, by culling infected poultry and setting monitoring zones around each focus point; 6) properly decontaminating infected farms; 7) encouraging the use of disinfectants in backyards where poultry are raised; 8) increasing awareness about the effects of avian influenza; 9) testing patients with suspected influenza for H5N1 and H9N2 virus; and 10) reevaluating the vaccination strategy, including that for H9N2 virus. If vaccination is to remain an important tool in the control plan, then the following aspects should be considered: 1) matching vaccine strains to currently circulating strains; 2) matching challenge strains to currently circulating strains; 3) maintaining high vaccination coverage; 4) ensuring vaccine efficacy not only in a laboratory setting but also in the field; and 5) evaluating vaccine efficacy on an annual basis.\"\n\nConclusions\n-----------\n\"Egypt is one of the few countries where H5N1 virus has become enzootic and is the only country with a high number of H5N1 outbreaks among poultry and cases among human. During the 2014-15 winter season, a sudden and substantial increase in human infection with H5N1 viruses was observed. There is no obvious or confirmed reason for this increase, but data indicate the following: 1) H9N2 virus is co-circulating and co-infecting with H5N1 viruses, 2) H5N1 viruses causing the infections possess some mutations that were rarely seen in the past, and 3) the poultry vaccination program is failing. However, our perspective was limited to the data available through our surveillance program, which might not be representative of the epizootiology of avian influenza virus in Egypt. Regardless of the causes of the recent increase in human H5N1 cases, this situation evolved because of the ineffective control strategy that was implemented. Controlling the situation requires a One Health approach, but certainly the greater share of responsibility now lies with the veterinary side.\"\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n[The full publication, including figures, can be viewed at the URL above. This well written and important overview of avian influenza A(H5N1 and H7N9) in Egypt raises serious concern over the increasing prevalence of infection in poultry and humans, especially considering the probable underreporting discussed in the paper. The authors recommend the steps they feel need to be taken to address this increasing public health threat, and the problems with the vaccination program. Recommended reading! - Mod.LK\n\nThe following data, extracted (slightly edited) from the paper's chapter \"Avian influenza in poultry in Egypt\", may be of interest:\n\nIn Egypt, a systematic surveillance program for avian influenza viruses has been in place since 2009. Commercial and semicommercial farms, abattoirs, backyard flocks, and live bird markets located in different governorates are sampled on a monthly basis regardless of the presence of disease symptoms in poultry. In each governorate, the same locations are continuously sampled by a poultry veterinarian, who collects one swab sample per bird; depending on the size of the poultry population, as many as 5 birds are sampled per flock. Birds are not randomly selected, and samples also are collected from sick or dead birds found onsite. Samples are mostly from chickens, but ducks, geese, turkeys, pigeons, and quails also are sampled. This program enabled detection of genetic and antigenic changes in H5N1 viruses in Egypt. It provided important epizootiologic data and described the poultry sectors acting as reservoirs of H5N1 viruses. The rate of avian influenza infection during August 2009-July 2010 was 5 per cent, exclusively attributable to H5N1 infection, and was more concentrated in the commercial production sector. From August 2010 through January 2013, the positivity rate increased to 10 per cent, and the infection was detected in all poultry production sectors. In 2011, H9N2 viruses emerged and were detected by this program and other surveillance activities in Egypt. The monthly positivity rate of avian influenza infection from August 2009 through December 2014 is shown graphically (http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/22/3/15-0593-f1) with sharp increases during the colder months (November through March). Emergence of H9N2 virus in poultry and an increase in human H5N1 cases are indicated. After the detection of H9N2 virus in 2011 the positivity rate during colder months was higher than that in the period when H5N1 was the only virus infecting poultry, exceeding 20 per cent in some months. Furthermore, co-infection with H5N1 and H9N2 viruses was frequently detected.

The control plan devised by veterinary authorities in Egypt to prevent infections in poultry focused mainly on vaccination and ultimately failed. Recently, widespread H5N1 infections in poultry and a substantial increase in the number of human cases of H5N1 infection were observed. We summarize surveillance data from 2009 through 2014 and show that avian influenza viruses are established in poultry in Egypt and are continuously evolving genetically and antigenically. We also discuss the epidemiology of human infection with avian influenza in Egypt and describe how the true burden of disease is underestimated.

The number of reported cases by year for 2006-2015 shows that, before the 2014-15 winter season, the annual number of cases never exceeded 40. However, in just 2 months, January and February 2015, a total of 88 cases were reported.

These figures are even more striking when it comes to human infection with H9N2 viruses.

Thus, it is imperative that authorities in Egypt devise and implement an aggressive control plan to curb the spread of disease in human and animal populations. The control plan must include the following elements: 1) mapping of the unlicensed, small-scale poultry farms that have become abundant in rural areas; 2) increasing the biosecurity levels of these small farms by using inexpensive tools; 3) revamping veterinary and public health surveillance and conducting joint human-animal interface surveillance and risk-assessment exercises; 4) encouraging poultry owners to report outbreaks and providing them appropriate compensation; 5) intervening, when poultry outbreaks are reported, by culling infected poultry and setting monitoring zones around each focus point; 6) properly decontaminating infected farms; 7) encouraging the use of disinfectants in backyards where poultry are raised; 8) increasing awareness about the effects of avian influenza; 9) testing patients with suspected influenza for H5N1 and H9N2 virus; and 10) reevaluating the vaccination strategy, including that for H9N2 virus. If vaccination is to remain an important tool in the control plan, then the following aspects should be considered: 1) matching vaccine strains to currently circulating strains; 2) matching challenge strains to currently circulating strains; 3) maintaining high vaccination coverage; 4) ensuring vaccine efficacy not only in a laboratory setting but also in the field; and 5) evaluating vaccine efficacy on an annual basis.\"\n\nConclusions\n-----------\n\"Egypt is one of the few countries where H5N1 virus has become enzootic and is the only country with a high number of H5N1 outbreaks among poultry and cases among human.

This well written and important overview of avian influenza A(H5N1 and H7N9) in Egypt raises serious concern over the increasing prevalence of infection in poultry and humans, especially considering the probable underreporting discussed in the paper. The authors recommend the steps they feel need to be taken to address this increasing public health threat, and the problems with the vaccination program. Recommended reading! - Mod.LK\n\nThe following data, extracted (slightly edited) from the paper's chapter \"Avian influenza in poultry in Egypt\", may be of interest:\n\nIn Egypt, a systematic surveillance program for avian influenza viruses has been in place since 2009. Commercial and semicommercial farms, abattoirs, backyard flocks, and live bird markets located in different governorates are sampled on a monthly basis regardless of the presence of disease symptoms in poultry. In each governorate, the same locations are continuously sampled by a poultry veterinarian, who collects one swab sample per bird; depending on the size of the poultry population, as many as 5 birds are sampled per flock. Birds are not randomly selected, and samples also are collected from sick or dead birds found onsite. Samples are mostly from chickens, but ducks, geese, turkeys, pigeons, and quails also are sampled. This program enabled detection of genetic and antigenic changes in H5N1 viruses in Egypt. It provided important epizootiologic data and described the poultry sectors acting as reservoirs of H5N1 viruses. The rate of avian influenza infection during August 2009-July 2010 was 5 per cent, exclusively attributable to H5N1 infection, and was more concentrated in the commercial production sector. From August 2010 through January 2013, the positivity rate increased to 10 per cent, and the infection was detected in all poultry production sectors. In 2011, H9N2 viruses emerged and were detected by this program and other surveillance activities in Egypt. The monthly positivity rate of avian influenza infection from August 2009 through December 2014 is shown graphically (http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/22/3/15-0593-f1) with sharp increases during the colder months (November through March). Emergence of H9N2 virus in poultry and an increase in human H5N1 cases are indicated. After the detection of H9N2 virus in 2011 the positivity rate during colder months was higher than that in the period when H5N1 was the only virus infecting poultry, exceeding 20 per cent in some months. Furthermore, co-infection with H5N1 and H9N2 viruses was frequently detected. The same seasonal pattern was seen with both strains during the period February 2013-December 2014 (http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/22/3/15-0593-f2).\n\nAmong the authors' conclusions: 1) H9N2 virus is co-circulating and co-infecting with H5N1 viruses, 2) H5N1 viruses causing the infections possess some mutations that were rarely seen in the past, 3) the poultry vaccination program is failing. \"However, our perspective was limited to the data available through our surveillance program, which might not be representative of the epizootiology of avian influenza virus in Egypt.

Commercial and semicommercial farms, abattoirs, backyard flocks, and live bird markets located in different governorates are sampled on a monthly basis regardless of the presence of disease symptoms in poultry. In each governorate, the same locations are continuously sampled by a poultry veterinarian, who collects one swab sample per bird; depending on the size of the poultry population, as many as 5 birds are sampled per flock. Birds are not randomly selected, and samples also are collected from sick or dead birds found onsite. Samples are mostly from chickens, but ducks, geese, turkeys, pigeons, and quails also are sampled. This program enabled detection of genetic and antigenic changes in H5N1 viruses in Egypt. It provided important epizootiologic data and described the poultry sectors acting as reservoirs of H5N1 viruses. The rate of avian influenza infection during August 2009-July 2010 was 5 per cent, exclusively attributable to H5N1 infection, and was more concentrated in the commercial production sector. From August 2010 through January 2013, the positivity rate increased to 10 per cent, and the infection was detected in all poultry production sectors. In 2011, H9N2 viruses emerged and were detected by this program and other surveillance activities in Egypt. The monthly positivity rate of avian influenza infection from August 2009 through December 2014 is shown graphically (http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/22/3/15-0593-f1) with sharp increases during the colder months (November through March). Emergence of H9N2 virus in poultry and an increase in human H5N1 cases are indicated. After the detection of H9N2 virus in 2011 the positivity rate during colder months was higher than that in the period when H5N1 was the only virus infecting poultry, exceeding 20 per cent in some months. Furthermore, co-infection with H5N1 and H9N2 viruses was frequently detected. The same seasonal pattern was seen with both strains during the period February 2013-December 2014 (http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/22/3/15-0593-f2).\n\nAmong the authors' conclusions: 1) H9N2 virus is co-circulating and co-infecting with H5N1 viruses, 2) H5N1 viruses causing the infections possess some mutations that were rarely seen in the past, 3) the poultry vaccination program is failing. \"However, our perspective was limited to the data available through our surveillance program, which might not be representative of the epizootiology of avian influenza virus in Egypt.

The control plan devised by veterinary authorities in Egypt to prevent infections in poultry focused mainly on vaccination and ultimately failed. Recently, widespread H5N1 infections in poultry and a substantial increase in the number of human cases of H5N1 infection were observed. We summarize surveillance data from 2009 through 2014 and show that avian influenza viruses are established in poultry in Egypt and are continuously evolving genetically and antigenically. We also discuss the epidemiology of human infection with avian influenza in Egypt and describe how the true burden of disease is underestimated. We discuss the failures of relying on vaccinating poultry as the sole intervention tool. We conclude by highlighting the key components that need to be included in a new strategy to control avian influenza infections in poultry and humans in Egypt.\"\n\nHuman cases [H5N1]\n------------------\nThe paper states that \"During 2006-2015, the estimated number of confirmed human cases of H5N1 infection in Egypt was 292, with a 34 per cent case fatality rate. The number of reported cases by year for 2006-2015 shows that, before the 2014-15 winter season, the annual number of cases never exceeded 40. However, in just 2 months, January and February 2015, a total of 88 cases were reported. The most recent cases occurred in persons who reported exposure to backyard poultry (70 per cent), bred domestic birds (26 per cent), slaughtered poultry (14 per cent), or were exposed to dead birds (4 per cent)...\"\n\nExtent of avian influenza infection in Egypt\n--------------------------------------------\n\"In Egypt, the number of reported human cases of avian influenza infection appears to be underestimated. An underestimation might result in an overestimation of the case-fatality rate, but it would certainly underestimate the extent of human infection with avian influenza viruses. Results from a controlled, serologic cohort study of persons in Egypt exposed and not exposed to poultry estimated the seroprevalence of antibodies against H5N1 (titers greater than 80) at 2 per cent. If this seroprevalence were to be extrapolated to the entire poultry-exposed population in Egypt, the true number of infections would amount to several hundred thousand. These figures are even more striking when it comes to human infection with H9N2 viruses. The seroprevalence of H9N2 antibodies detected in the same cohort study ranged from 5.6 per cent to 7.5 per cent, whereas just 1 case of H9N2 infection was reported...\"\n\nProposed avian influenza control plan\n-------------------------------------\n\"The avian influenza situation in Egypt is deteriorating, evident in the fact that H5N1 and H9N2 viruses are enzootic in poultry and that incidence of H5N1 and H9N2 infection is increasing. The problem is also evident in the sharp increase in human H5N1 cases and the detection of the 1st human H9N2 case. Thus, it is imperative that authorities in Egypt devise and implement an aggressive control plan to curb the spread of disease in human and animal populations. The control plan must include the following elements: 1) mapping of the unlicensed, small-scale poultry farms that have become abundant in rural areas; 2) increasing the biosecurity levels of these small farms by using inexpensive tools; 3) revamping veterinary and public health surveillance and conducting joint human-animal interface surveillance and risk-assessment exercises; 4) encouraging poultry owners to report outbreaks and providing them appropriate compensation; 5) intervening, when poultry outbreaks are reported, by culling infected poultry and setting monitoring zones around each focus point; 6) properly decontaminating infected farms; 7) encouraging the use of disinfectants in backyards where poultry are raised; 8) increasing awareness about the effects of avian influenza; 9) testing patients with suspected influenza for H5N1 and H9N2 virus; and 10) reevaluating the vaccination strategy, including that for H9N2 virus. If vaccination is to remain an important tool in the control plan, then the following aspects should be considered: 1) matching vaccine strains to currently circulating strains; 2) matching challenge strains to currently circulating strains; 3) maintaining high vaccination coverage; 4) ensuring vaccine efficacy not only in a laboratory setting but also in the field; and 5) evaluating vaccine efficacy on an annual basis.\"\n\nConclusions\n-----------\n\"Egypt is one of the few countries where H5N1 virus has become enzootic and is the only country with a high number of H5N1 outbreaks among poultry and cases among human. During the 2014-15 winter season, a sudden and substantial increase in human infection with H5N1 viruses was observed. There is no obvious or confirmed reason for this increase, but data indicate the following: 1) H9N2 virus is co-circulating and co-infecting with H5N1 viruses, 2) H5N1 viruses causing the infections possess some mutations that were rarely seen in the past, and 3) the poultry vaccination program is failing. However, our perspective was limited to the data available through our surveillance program, which might not be representative of the epizootiology of avian influenza virus in Egypt. Regardless of the causes of the recent increase in human H5N1 cases, this situation evolved because of the ineffective control strategy that was implemented. Controlling the situation requires a One Health approach, but certainly the greater share of responsibility now lies with the veterinary side.\"\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n[The full publication, including figures, can be viewed at the URL above.

Commercial and semicommercial farms, abattoirs, backyard flocks, and live bird markets located in different governorates are sampled on a monthly basis regardless of the presence of disease symptoms in poultry. In each governorate, the same locations are continuously sampled by a poultry veterinarian, who collects one swab sample per bird; depending on the size of the poultry population, as many as 5 birds are sampled per flock. Birds are not randomly selected, and samples also are collected from sick or dead birds found onsite. Samples are mostly from chickens, but ducks, geese, turkeys, pigeons, and quails also are sampled. This program enabled detection of genetic and antigenic changes in H5N1 viruses in Egypt. It provided important epizootiologic data and described the poultry sectors acting as reservoirs of H5N1 viruses. The rate of avian influenza infection during August 2009-July 2010 was 5 per cent, exclusively attributable to H5N1 infection, and was more concentrated in the commercial production sector. From August 2010 through January 2013, the positivity rate increased to 10 per cent, and the infection was detected in all poultry production sectors. In 2011, H9N2 viruses emerged and were detected by this program and other surveillance activities in Egypt. The monthly positivity rate of avian influenza infection from August 2009 through December 2014 is shown graphically (http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/22/3/15-0593-f1) with sharp increases during the colder months (November through March). Emergence of H9N2 virus in poultry and an increase in human H5N1 cases are indicated. After the detection of H9N2 virus in 2011 the positivity rate during colder months was higher than that in the period when H5N1 was the only virus infecting poultry, exceeding 20 per cent in some months. Furthermore, co-infection with H5N1 and H9N2 viruses was frequently detected.

The control plan devised by veterinary authorities in Egypt to prevent infections in poultry focused mainly on vaccination and ultimately failed. Recently, widespread H5N1 infections in poultry and a substantial increase in the number of human cases of H5N1 infection were observed. We summarize surveillance data from 2009 through 2014 and show that avian influenza viruses are established in poultry in Egypt and are continuously evolving genetically and antigenically. We also discuss the epidemiology of human infection with avian influenza in Egypt and describe how the true burden of disease is underestimated. We discuss the failures of relying on vaccinating poultry as the sole intervention tool. We conclude by highlighting the key components that need to be included in a new strategy to control avian influenza infections in poultry and humans in Egypt.\"\n\nHuman cases [H5N1]\n------------------\nThe paper states that \"During 2006-2015, the estimated number of confirmed human cases of H5N1 infection in Egypt was 292, with a 34 per cent case fatality rate. The number of reported cases by year for 2006-2015 shows that, before the 2014-15 winter season, the annual number of cases never exceeded 40. However, in just 2 months, January and February 2015, a total of 88 cases were reported. The most recent cases occurred in persons who reported exposure to backyard poultry (70 per cent), bred domestic birds (26 per cent), slaughtered poultry (14 per cent), or were exposed to dead birds (4 per cent)...\"\n\nExtent of avian influenza infection in Egypt\n--------------------------------------------\n\"In Egypt, the number of reported human cases of avian influenza infection appears to be underestimated. An underestimation might result in an overestimation of the case-fatality rate, but it would certainly underestimate the extent of human infection with avian influenza viruses. Results from a controlled, serologic cohort study of persons in Egypt exposed and not exposed to poultry estimated the seroprevalence of antibodies against H5N1 (titers greater than 80) at 2 per cent. If this seroprevalence were to be extrapolated to the entire poultry-exposed population in Egypt, the true number of infections would amount to several hundred thousand. These figures are even more striking when it comes to human infection with H9N2 viruses. The seroprevalence of H9N2 antibodies detected in the same cohort study ranged from 5.6 per cent to 7.5 per cent, whereas just 1 case of H9N2 infection was reported...\"\n\nProposed avian influenza control plan\n-------------------------------------\n\"The avian influenza situation in Egypt is deteriorating, evident in the fact that H5N1 and H9N2 viruses are enzootic in poultry and that incidence of H5N1 and H9N2 infection is increasing. The problem is also evident in the sharp increase in human H5N1 cases and the detection of the 1st human H9N2 case. Thus, it is imperative that authorities in Egypt devise and implement an aggressive control plan to curb the spread of disease in human and animal populations. The control plan must include the following elements: 1) mapping of the unlicensed, small-scale poultry farms that have become abundant in rural areas; 2) increasing the biosecurity levels of these small farms by using inexpensive tools; 3) revamping veterinary and public health surveillance and conducting joint human-animal interface surveillance and risk-assessment exercises; 4) encouraging poultry owners to report outbreaks and providing them appropriate compensation; 5) intervening, when poultry outbreaks are reported, by culling infected poultry and setting monitoring zones around each focus point; 6) properly decontaminating infected farms; 7) encouraging the use of disinfectants in backyards where poultry are raised; 8) increasing awareness about the effects of avian influenza; 9) testing patients with suspected influenza for H5N1 and H9N2 virus; and 10) reevaluating the vaccination strategy, including that for H9N2 virus. If vaccination is to remain an important tool in the control plan, then the following aspects should be considered: 1) matching vaccine strains to currently circulating strains; 2) matching challenge strains to currently circulating strains; 3) maintaining high vaccination coverage; 4) ensuring vaccine efficacy not only in a laboratory setting but also in the field; and 5) evaluating vaccine efficacy on an annual basis.\"\n\nConclusions\n-----------\n\"Egypt is one of the few countries where H5N1 virus has become enzootic and is the only country with a high number of H5N1 outbreaks among poultry and cases among human.

The control plan devised by veterinary authorities in Egypt to prevent infections in poultry focused mainly on vaccination and ultimately failed. Recently, widespread H5N1 infections in poultry and a substantial increase in the number of human cases of H5N1 infection were observed. We summarize surveillance data from 2009 through 2014 and show that avian influenza viruses are established in poultry in Egypt and are continuously evolving genetically and antigenically. We also discuss the epidemiology of human infection with avian influenza in Egypt and describe how the true burden of disease is underestimated. We discuss the failures of relying on vaccinating poultry as the sole intervention tool. We conclude by highlighting the key components that need to be included in a new strategy to control avian influenza infections in poultry and humans in Egypt.\"\n\nHuman cases [H5N1]\n------------------\nThe paper states that \"During 2006-2015, the estimated number of confirmed human cases of H5N1 infection in Egypt was 292, with a 34 per cent case fatality rate. The number of reported cases by year for 2006-2015 shows that, before the 2014-15 winter season, the annual number of cases never exceeded 40. However, in just 2 months, January and February 2015, a total of 88 cases were reported. The most recent cases occurred in persons who reported exposure to backyard poultry (70 per cent), bred domestic birds (26 per cent), slaughtered poultry (14 per cent), or were exposed to dead birds (4 per cent)...\"\n\nExtent of avian influenza infection in Egypt\n--------------------------------------------\n\"In Egypt, the number of reported human cases of avian influenza infection appears to be underestimated.

If this seroprevalence were to be extrapolated to the entire poultry-exposed population in Egypt, the true number of infections would amount to several hundred thousand. These figures are even more striking when it comes to human infection with H9N2 viruses.

The problem is also evident in the sharp increase in human H5N1 cases and the detection of the 1st human H9N2 case. Thus, it is imperative that authorities in Egypt devise and implement an aggressive control plan to curb the spread of disease in human and animal populations. The control plan must include the following elements: 1) mapping of the unlicensed, small-scale poultry farms that have become abundant in rural areas; 2) increasing the biosecurity levels of these small farms by using inexpensive tools; 3) revamping veterinary and public health surveillance and conducting joint human-animal interface surveillance and risk-assessment exercises; 4) encouraging poultry owners to report outbreaks and providing them appropriate compensation; 5) intervening, when poultry outbreaks are reported, by culling infected poultry and setting monitoring zones around each focus point; 6) properly decontaminating infected farms; 7) encouraging the use of disinfectants in backyards where poultry are raised; 8) increasing awareness about the effects of avian influenza; 9) testing patients with suspected influenza for H5N1 and H9N2 virus; and 10) reevaluating the vaccination strategy, including that for H9N2 virus. If vaccination is to remain an important tool in the control plan, then the following aspects should be considered: 1) matching vaccine strains to currently circulating strains; 2) matching challenge strains to currently circulating strains; 3) maintaining high vaccination coverage; 4) ensuring vaccine efficacy not only in a laboratory setting but also in the field; and 5) evaluating vaccine efficacy on an annual basis.\"\n\nConclusions\n-----------\n\"Egypt is one of the few countries where H5N1 virus has become enzootic and is the only country with a high number of H5N1 outbreaks among poultry and cases among human.

This well written and important overview of avian influenza A(H5N1 and H7N9) in Egypt raises serious concern over the increasing prevalence of infection in poultry and humans, especially considering the probable underreporting discussed in the paper. The authors recommend the steps they feel need to be taken to address this increasing public health threat, and the problems with the vaccination program. Recommended reading! - Mod.LK\n\nThe following data, extracted (slightly edited) from the paper's chapter \"Avian influenza in poultry in Egypt\", may be of interest:\n\nIn Egypt, a systematic surveillance program for avian influenza viruses has been in place since 2009. Commercial and semicommercial farms, abattoirs, backyard flocks, and live bird markets located in different governorates are sampled on a monthly basis regardless of the presence of disease symptoms in poultry. In each governorate, the same locations are continuously sampled by a poultry veterinarian, who collects one swab sample per bird; depending on the size of the poultry population, as many as 5 birds are sampled per flock. Birds are not randomly selected, and samples also are collected from sick or dead birds found onsite. Samples are mostly from chickens, but ducks, geese, turkeys, pigeons, and quails also are sampled. This program enabled detection of genetic and antigenic changes in H5N1 viruses in Egypt. It provided important epizootiologic data and described the poultry sectors acting as reservoirs of H5N1 viruses. The rate of avian influenza infection during August 2009-July 2010 was 5 per cent, exclusively attributable to H5N1 infection, and was more concentrated in the commercial production sector. From August 2010 through January 2013, the positivity rate increased to 10 per cent, and the infection was detected in all poultry production sectors. In 2011, H9N2 viruses emerged and were detected by this program and other surveillance activities in Egypt. The monthly positivity rate of avian influenza infection from August 2009 through December 2014 is shown graphically (http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/22/3/15-0593-f1) with sharp increases during the colder months (November through March). Emergence of H9N2 virus in poultry and an increase in human H5N1 cases are indicated. After the detection of H9N2 virus in 2011 the positivity rate during colder months was higher than that in the period when H5N1 was the only virus infecting poultry, exceeding 20 per cent in some months. Furthermore, co-infection with H5N1 and H9N2 viruses was frequently detected. The same seasonal pattern was seen with both strains during the period February 2013-December 2014 (http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/22/3/15-0593-f2).\n\nAmong the authors' conclusions: 1) H9N2 virus is co-circulating and co-infecting with H5N1 viruses, 2) H5N1 viruses causing the infections possess some mutations that were rarely seen in the past, 3) the poultry vaccination program is failing. \"However, our perspective was limited to the data available through our surveillance program, which might not be representative of the epizootiology of avian influenza virus in Egypt.

This well written and important overview of avian influenza A(H5N1 and H7N9) in Egypt raises serious concern over the increasing prevalence of infection in poultry and humans, especially considering the probable underreporting discussed in the paper. The authors recommend the steps they feel need to be taken to address this increasing public health threat, and the problems with the vaccination program. Recommended reading! - Mod.LK\n\nThe following data, extracted (slightly edited) from the paper's chapter \"Avian influenza in poultry in Egypt\", may be of interest:\n\nIn Egypt, a systematic surveillance program for avian influenza viruses has been in place since 2009. Commercial and semicommercial farms, abattoirs, backyard flocks, and live bird markets located in different governorates are sampled on a monthly basis regardless of the presence of disease symptoms in poultry. In each governorate, the same locations are continuously sampled by a poultry veterinarian, who collects one swab sample per bird; depending on the size of the poultry population, as many as 5 birds are sampled per flock. Birds are not randomly selected, and samples also are collected from sick or dead birds found onsite. Samples are mostly from chickens, but ducks, geese, turkeys, pigeons, and quails also are sampled. This program enabled detection of genetic and antigenic changes in H5N1 viruses in Egypt. It provided important epizootiologic data and described the poultry sectors acting as reservoirs of H5N1 viruses. The rate of avian influenza infection during August 2009-July 2010 was 5 per cent, exclusively attributable to H5N1 infection, and was more concentrated in the commercial production sector. From August 2010 through January 2013, the positivity rate increased to 10 per cent, and the infection was detected in all poultry production sectors. In 2011, H9N2 viruses emerged and were detected by this program and other surveillance activities in Egypt. The monthly positivity rate of avian influenza infection from August 2009 through December 2014 is shown graphically (http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/22/3/15-0593-f1) with sharp increases during the colder months (November through March). Emergence of H9N2 virus in poultry and an increase in human H5N1 cases are indicated. After the detection of H9N2 virus in 2011 the positivity rate during colder months was higher than that in the period when H5N1 was the only virus infecting poultry, exceeding 20 per cent in some months. Furthermore, co-infection with H5N1 and H9N2 viruses was frequently detected. The same seasonal pattern was seen with both strains during the period February 2013-December 2014 (http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/22/3/15-0593-f2).\n\nAmong the authors' conclusions: 1) H9N2 virus is co-circulating and co-infecting with H5N1 viruses, 2) H5N1 viruses causing the infections possess some mutations that were rarely seen in the past, 3) the poultry vaccination program is failing. \"However, our perspective was limited to the data available through our surveillance program, which might not be representative of the epizootiology of avian influenza virus in Egypt. Regardless of the causes of the recent increase in human H5N1 cases, this situation evolved because of the ineffective control strategy that was implemented. Controlling the situation requires a One Health approach, but certainly the greater share of responsibility now lies with the veterinary side.\" - Mod.AS\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/55.]\nSee Also\nAvian influenza, human (03): Egypt (BA) H5N1 20160106.3915791\n2015\n---\nAvian influenza, human (132): Algeria (TB) H5N1, susp, RFI 20151219.3873849\nAvian influenza, human (113): Turkey, susp, H5N1, RFI 20150712.3504366\nAvian influenza (140): Egypt, poultry, HPAI H5N1, control, revision 20150530.3397148\nAvian influenza, human (112): Egypt, H5N1 cases 20150624.3462638\nAvian influenza, human (109): novel viruses, virulence, H5N8 20150523.3380732\nAvian influenza, human (108): Egypt, H9N2, influenza B 20150522.3378923\nAvian influenza, human (107): WHO assessment 20150521.3376485\nAvian influenza, human (106): novel viruses, virulence unknown 20150520.3375592\nAvian influenza, human (104): Egypt H5N1 20150516.3366602\nAvian influenza, human (97): Egypt, H5N1 20150430.3334280\nAvian influenza, human (96): ECDC update 20150429.3331669\nAvian influenza, human (94): Egypt, FAO update H5N1 20150421.3310680\nAvian influenza, human (92): ECDC update, H5N1 genetics 20150413.3295430\nAvian influenza, human (55): Egypt (FY) H5N1, virus volatility, preparedness 20150226.3195148\nAvian influenza, human (52): Egypt (DQ) H5N1 fatality 20150224.3187488\nAvian influenza, human (46): Egypt (FY, AT) H5N1 20150216.3170598\nAvian influenza, human (45): Egypt (QH,FY) H5N1 cases, tally 20150215.3168646\nAvian influenza, human (44): Egypt (AS) H9N2, 1st case 20150215.3168314\nAvian influenza, human (39): Egypt, H5N1, new cases 20150210.3155566\nAvian influenza, human (35): weekly update H5N1 & H7N9, China (GD) H7N9 20150205.3146067\nAvian influenza, human (29): Egypt, Nigeria, H5N1 20150130.3132222\nAvian influenza, human (25): China (JS) Egypt H5N1 20150128.3126564\nAvian influenza, human (16): Egypt (MN,AT) H5N1 fatalities 20150121.3108144\nAvian influenza, human (14): Egypt, H5N1 susp. 20150119.3103703\nAvian influenza, human (12): Egypt (MF) H5N1, susp 20150115.3095472\nAvian influenza, human (09): Egypt, H5N1, mutations, comment 20150110.3084116\nAvian influenza, human (08): Egypt, H5N1, mutations 20150109.3082553\nAvian influenza, human (04): Egypt (MF, GZ) fatal, China (HK) 20150105.3072586\nAvian influenza, human (03): Egypt (AN, Cairo, MF) fatal, H5N1 20150103.3069160\nAvian influenza, human (01): Libya, fatal, H5N1 susp, RFI 20150101.3061029\n.................................................lk/arn/mj/sh", "reports": [{"diseases": ["unknown", "other"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2021-03-14 00:00:00", "2016-01-21 00:00:00", "2016-03-16 00:00:00", "2009-03-16 00:00:00", "2014-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-01-16 00:00:00", "2015-02-16 00:00:00", "2009-03-16 00:00:00", "2010-08-16 00:00:00", "2013-01-16 00:00:00", "2011-03-16 00:00:00", "2009-08-16 00:00:00", "2014-12-16 00:00:00", "2011-03-16 00:00:00", "2015-03-16 00:00:00", "2055-03-16 00:00:00", "2052-03-16 00:00:00", "2046-03-16 00:00:00", "2045-03-16 00:00:00", "2044-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-01 00:00:00", "2039-03-16 00:00:00", "2035-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-25 00:00:00", "2021-03-08 00:00:00", "2021-03-04 00:00:00", "2021-03-01 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Cairo", "country": "Egypt"}, {"location": "GD", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "EGYPT", "country": "Egypt"}, {"location": "Egypt", "country": "Egypt"}, {"location": "FY", "country": "Saudi Arabia"}, {"location": "Algeria", "country": "Algeria"}, {"location": "Libya", "country": "Libya"}, {"location": "Nigeria", "country": "Nigeria"}, {"location": "China", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Turkey", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "JS", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "3952808", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Avian influenza (13): India (TR) HPAI H5N1, poultry, OIE", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=3952808", "date": "2015-12-19 20:27:43", "main_text": "AVIAN INFLUENZA (132): FRANCE, HPAI (H5N1/H5N2/H5N9) LPAI (H5N2/H5N3) ASSESSMENT\n********************************************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Wed 16 Dec 2015\nSource: DEFRA (UK Department for Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs) International Disease Monitoring, outbreak assessment [edited]\nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/487411/update-h5n1-hpai-france.pdf\n\n\nAvian influenza of high pathogenicity (H5N1, H5N2, and H5N9) and low pathogenicity (H5N2, H5N3) in poultry in France\nRef: VITT/1200 LPAI & HPAI in France\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n1. Disease report\nSince the last update [of 7 Dec 2015], several new outbreaks in poultry have now been reported as a result of increased surveillance in South West France [Ministry of Agriculture], France, 2015; see map at the source URL above]; not all outbreaks visible at this scale]. To date [16 Dec 2015] there are 15 outbreaks of HPAI H5 (N1, N2, and N9) and 7 outbreaks of LPAI H5 (N2 and N3) which have been reported to the EU Animal Disease Notification System and in addition there may be a further 15 cases of HPAI reported on the French Surveillance platform.\n\nSeveral of the outbreaks are linked to one another, according to the disease reports, and the species affected include commercial ducks, geese, and guinea fowl. While ducks and geese are not exhibiting severe clinical signs, the guinea fowl may show severe clinical signs and high levels of mortality as expected for a galliform host infected with HPAI. The developing situation still carries significant uncertainties as the French authorities are using the legislative tools to limit further spread, through the use of restriction zones around each outbreak and enhanced surveillance and restrictions beyond the EU requirements for the Dordogne region as well as several communes in the Landes region, preventing international trade from these areas (hatched area in map). Movements of live birds from any control zone are subject to pre-movement testing, which has led to the detection of more infected flocks, but does provide additional assurance (http://agriculture.gouv.fr/sites/minagri/files/listes_communes_ia_11dec15.pdf)\n\n2. Conclusion\nAs before, there are still many unknowns and a lot of uncertainty. The risk to the UK as a result of these outbreaks is primarily around pathways which involve lapses in biosecurity or trade routes, rather than through wild birds as these are apparently wholly European origin viruses. However the situation in France simply reinforces what we already knew: that these LPAI viruses circulate in wild birds and cause occasional spill-over outbreaks in poultry that may be difficult to detect in domestic waterfowl species and which may then mutate into HPAI viruses following infection of galliform hosts.\n\nWhilst there is uncertainty over the identity of the index case(s) and the pathways for virus evolution (including the genesis of 3 HPAI subtypes) and the host populations/networks in which these occurred, introduction by other transmission pathways from other undisclosed sources cannot be excluded. However, it would appear based on information available to date and knowledge of the biology of these viruses, that the new cases in France may be related. Detailed genetic analyses of the causative viruses will be critical to understanding these events and defining with greater certainty risk pathways and periods for spread of infection. Whether the index case for the LPAI to HPAI mutation(s) has been found is uncertain.\n\nWe will continue to monitor the situation closely. We would like to remind all poultry keepers to maintain high standards of biosecurity, remain vigilant, and report any suspect clinical signs promptly and in addition using the testing to exclude scheme for avian notifiable disease where appropriate for early safeguard.

Conclusion\nAs before, there are still many unknowns and a lot of uncertainty. The risk to the UK as a result of these outbreaks is primarily around pathways which involve lapses in biosecurity or trade routes, rather than through wild birds as these are apparently wholly European origin viruses. However the situation in France simply reinforces what we already knew: that these LPAI viruses circulate in wild birds and cause occasional spill-over outbreaks in poultry that may be difficult to detect in domestic waterfowl species and which may then mutate into HPAI viruses following infection of galliform hosts.\n\nWhilst there is uncertainty over the identity of the index case(s) and the pathways for virus evolution (including the genesis of 3 HPAI subtypes) and the host populations/networks in which these occurred, introduction by other transmission pathways from other undisclosed sources cannot be excluded. However, it would appear based on information available to date and knowledge of the biology of these viruses, that the new cases in France may be related. Detailed genetic analyses of the causative viruses will be critical to understanding these events and defining with greater certainty risk pathways and periods for spread of infection. Whether the index case for the LPAI to HPAI mutation(s) has been found is uncertain.\n\nWe will continue to monitor the situation closely. We would like to remind all poultry keepers to maintain high standards of biosecurity, remain vigilant, and report any suspect clinical signs promptly and in addition using the testing to exclude scheme for avian notifiable disease where appropriate for early safeguard.

Disease report\nSince the last update [of 7 Dec 2015], several new outbreaks in poultry have now been reported as a result of increased surveillance in South West France [Ministry of Agriculture], France, 2015; see map at the source URL above]; not all outbreaks visible at this scale]. To date [16 Dec 2015] there are 15 outbreaks of HPAI H5 (N1, N2, and N9) and 7 outbreaks of LPAI H5 (N2 and N3) which have been reported to the EU Animal Disease Notification System and in addition there may be a further 15 cases of HPAI reported on the French Surveillance platform.\n\nSeveral of the outbreaks are linked to one another, according to the disease reports, and the species affected include commercial ducks, geese, and guinea fowl. While ducks and geese are not exhibiting severe clinical signs, the guinea fowl may show severe clinical signs and high levels of mortality as expected for a galliform host infected with HPAI. The developing situation still carries significant uncertainties as the French authorities are using the legislative tools to limit further spread, through the use of restriction zones around each outbreak and enhanced surveillance and restrictions beyond the EU requirements for the Dordogne region as well as several communes in the Landes region, preventing international trade from these areas (hatched area in map).

Disease report\nSince the last update [of 7 Dec 2015], several new outbreaks in poultry have now been reported as a result of increased surveillance in South West France [Ministry of Agriculture], France, 2015; see map at the source URL above]; not all outbreaks visible at this scale]. To date [16 Dec 2015] there are 15 outbreaks of HPAI H5 (N1, N2, and N9) and 7 outbreaks of LPAI H5 (N2 and N3) which have been reported to the EU Animal Disease Notification System and in addition there may be a further 15 cases of HPAI reported on the French Surveillance platform.\n\nSeveral of the outbreaks are linked to one another, according to the disease reports, and the species affected include commercial ducks, geese, and guinea fowl. While ducks and geese are not exhibiting severe clinical signs, the guinea fowl may show severe clinical signs and high levels of mortality as expected for a galliform host infected with HPAI. The developing situation still carries significant uncertainties as the French authorities are using the legislative tools to limit further spread, through the use of restriction zones around each outbreak and enhanced surveillance and restrictions beyond the EU requirements for the Dordogne region as well as several communes in the Landes region, preventing international trade from these areas (hatched area in map). Movements of live birds from any control zone are subject to pre-movement testing, which has led to the detection of more infected flocks, but does provide additional assurance (http://agriculture.gouv.fr/sites/minagri/files/listes_communes_ia_11dec15.pdf)\n\n2. Conclusion\nAs before, there are still many unknowns and a lot of uncertainty. The risk to the UK as a result of these outbreaks is primarily around pathways which involve lapses in biosecurity or trade routes, rather than through wild birds as these are apparently wholly European origin viruses. However the situation in France simply reinforces what we already knew: that these LPAI viruses circulate in wild birds and cause occasional spill-over outbreaks in poultry that may be difficult to detect in domestic waterfowl species and which may then mutate into HPAI viruses following infection of galliform hosts.\n\nWhilst there is uncertainty over the identity of the index case(s) and the pathways for virus evolution (including the genesis of 3 HPAI subtypes) and the host populations/networks in which these occurred, introduction by other transmission pathways from other undisclosed sources cannot be excluded. However, it would appear based on information available to date and knowledge of the biology of these viruses, that the new cases in France may be related. Detailed genetic analyses of the causative viruses will be critical to understanding these events and defining with greater certainty risk pathways and periods for spread of infection. Whether the index case for the LPAI to HPAI mutation(s) has been found is uncertain.\n\nWe will continue to monitor the situation closely. We would like to remind all poultry keepers to maintain high standards of biosecurity, remain vigilant, and report any suspect clinical signs promptly and in addition using the testing to exclude scheme for avian notifiable disease where appropriate for early safeguard.

In fact, the number of cases occurring in this period exceeded the number of cases ever found in any country since the disease's reemergence in 2004. In view of the serious risk of a pandemic, which is enhanced by the enzootic state of H5N1 in Egypt, the Ministry for Health and Population requested a joint assessment to better understand the recent upsurge, and to provide concrete measures to curb the trend of increasing infection. From 8-12 Mar [2015], a team representing the World Health Organization (WHO), the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (US-CDC), the United States Naval Medical Research Unit 3 (US-NAMRU-3) and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) met with key stakeholders and analysed the current situation.\n\nSummary of findings\n----\n\nAnimal health (Please see in commentary below)\n\nHuman health\n----\nConcomitant with the dramatic increase in the number of poultry outbreaks, there has been an unprecedented increase in the number of human cases detected each month, particularly from December 2014 through February 2015. According to the Ministry of Health and Population, the numbers of H5N1 cases reported for these months greatly exceeded the expected numbers based on historical data.\n\nThis upsurge most likely results from increased exposure of people to infected poultry. Most recent human cases (approximately 70 percent) had exposure to backyard poultry. Children under 5 make up a significantly higher portion of all confirmed H5N1 cases in Egypt (33 percent) compared with the rest of the world (15 percent). Young children and women often are engaged in rearing backyard poultry, which puts them at high risk during poultry outbreaks.\n\nLikewise, the number of human samples being tested for H5N1 has increased compared with [during] earlier poultry outbreaks. Testing has also increased as a result of rapid response by the preventive sector and increased awareness among clinicians.\n\nDespite the unprecedented surge in human cases in Egypt, it does not appear that the risk of an H5N1 pandemic has changed appreciably. This conclusion is based on the following:\n1) although human-to-human transmission cannot be excluded, there has been no change in the size or number of clusters of human cases during the surge compared with previous years;\n2) there is no evidence of transmission from patients to healthcare workers during the surge;\n3) most recent human cases had direct or indirect poultry contact;\n4) genetic sequence data have not identified changes that would make human-to-human transmission efficient.\n\nNevertheless, the presence of H5N1 viruses in Egypt with the ability to jump more readily from birds to humans than viruses in other enzootic countries is of concern and requires a high level of vigilance from the Ministries of Health and Agriculture.\n\nThe Ministry of Health and Population has strengthened multiple disease surveillance [for] influenza-like illness (ILI), severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and avian influenza [which has] generated valuable epidemiological information for this and other important influenza outbreaks. The Central Public Health Laboratory functions well and has provided training for regional and local laboratories.\n\nGenetic and antigenic data from human and poultry samples are being jointly analysed by staff in Egypt along with international counterparts. However, increased real-time sharing and analysis should be encouraged. The 4-way linking platform could be used to accomplish this; it should also meet fortnightly during a surge of cases and every 2 months when there are no outbreaks.\n\nThe Ministry of Health and Population has purchased antiviral drugs (neuraminidase inhibitors) [which] have been made available to clinicians for patients with suspected and laboratory-confirmed infections. This is particularly important to reduce mortality\n\nCoordination and collaboration\nCommunication for behavior change\n\nKey recommendations\n----\nCoordination and strategic planning\nMinistry of Agriculture and Land Reclamation\nMinistry of Health and Population\nCommunication for behavior change\n\nThe way forward\n----\nA successful approach to addressing H5N1 requires long-term, sustainable investments in agriculture, health and communities. In particular, close collaboration between sectors is required in communications, policy development, surveillance and response, and the production and sharing of information. Accurate, regular assessment of the impact of control measures is required to evaluate progress.\n\nThe government should undertake 1 or more pilot projects at the district level to determine which changes in policies and practices are most effective in reducing spread of infection among poultry and to humans and sustainable on a medium- to long-term basis. Addressing H5N1 nationally will require long-term changes in policies, practices, culture, awareness and community engagement.\n\nWithin 3 months, a 2-year action plan that encompasses these recommendations and includes clear outcomes and indicators for monitoring will be developed by the ministries of health, agriculture and local development. FAO, WHO and OIE will support development of the plan, which will be presented to the NSC.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[This Executive summary is the result of an invitation Egypt extended 2 months ago to the WHO, FAO, NAMRU-3, CDC and UNICEF for a joint investigation of H5N1 in the country, and to make recommendations on containing that outbreak.\n\nThe updated H5N1 case count from WHO, which covers reported cases since November 2014 to 30 April 2015,, is 165 cases and 48 deaths.

Between 1 Dec 2014 and 28 Feb 2015, 333 outbreaks in poultry were observed in Egypt, while between 1 Dec 2013 and 28 Feb 2014 there were only 44 reported outbreaks. Reports indicate that H5N1 is circulating in all sectors of poultry production and geographically in all parts of Egypt. The reasons for this increase are clearly complex and multi-factorial; however, certain factors associated with poultry production and disease control provide possible means of strengthening prevention and response. Changes in the economy and poultry industry since 2011 have had a negative impact on food safety and the capacity of the Ministry of Agriculture and Land Reclamation (MOALR) to prevent or respond to outbreaks of disease. With the reduction in control of poultry production nationally, many small farmers have turned to raising poultry for food and income in an unmonitored and uncontrolled farming sector. Evidence suggests that H5N1 virus is deeply entrenched on such farms and in household flocks. Further, implementation of a proper control strategy is currently impeded by weak response capacity, weak public-private partnerships, sub-optimal vaccination strategies and low levels of biosecurity in some poultry production sectors.

for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Fri 15 May 2015\nSource: WHO/FAO/OIE/US-CDC/US-NAMRU-3/UNICEF [edited]\nhttp://www.emro.who.int/images/stories/Executive_Summary_14_May_2015.pdf?ua=1\n\n\nJoint high-level mission on the current H5N1 situation in Egypt\n-----\nEgypt, 8-12 Mar 2015\n\nExecutive summary\n\nIntroduction\n----\nBetween November 2014 and February 2015, Egypt saw a major rise in the number of human cases of avian influenza A(H5N1). In fact, the number of cases occurring in this period exceeded the number of cases ever found in any country since the disease's reemergence in 2004. In view of the serious risk of a pandemic, which is enhanced by the enzootic state of H5N1 in Egypt, the Ministry for Health and Population requested a joint assessment to better understand the recent upsurge, and to provide concrete measures to curb the trend of increasing infection. From 8-12 Mar [2015], a team representing the World Health Organization (WHO), the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (US-CDC), the United States Naval Medical Research Unit 3 (US-NAMRU-3) and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) met with key stakeholders and analysed the current situation.\n\nSummary of findings\n----\n\nAnimal health (Please see in commentary below)\n\nHuman health\n----\nConcomitant with the dramatic increase in the number of poultry outbreaks, there has been an unprecedented increase in the number of human cases detected each month, particularly from December 2014 through February 2015. According to the Ministry of Health and Population, the numbers of H5N1 cases reported for these months greatly exceeded the expected numbers based on historical data.\n\nThis upsurge most likely results from increased exposure of people to infected poultry. Most recent human cases (approximately 70 percent) had exposure to backyard poultry. Children under 5 make up a significantly higher portion of all confirmed H5N1 cases in Egypt (33 percent) compared with the rest of the world (15 percent). Young children and women often are engaged in rearing backyard poultry, which puts them at high risk during poultry outbreaks.\n\nLikewise, the number of human samples being tested for H5N1 has increased compared with [during] earlier poultry outbreaks. Testing has also increased as a result of rapid response by the preventive sector and increased awareness among clinicians.\n\nDespite the unprecedented surge in human cases in Egypt, it does not appear that the risk of an H5N1 pandemic has changed appreciably. This conclusion is based on the following:\n1) although human-to-human transmission cannot be excluded, there has been no change in the size or number of clusters of human cases during the surge compared with previous years;\n2) there is no evidence of transmission from patients to healthcare workers during the surge;\n3) most recent human cases had direct or indirect poultry contact;\n4) genetic sequence data have not identified changes that would make human-to-human transmission efficient.\n\nNevertheless, the presence of H5N1 viruses in Egypt with the ability to jump more readily from birds to humans than viruses in other enzootic countries is of concern and requires a high level of vigilance from the Ministries of Health and Agriculture.\n\nThe Ministry of Health and Population has strengthened multiple disease surveillance [for] influenza-like illness (ILI), severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and avian influenza [which has] generated valuable epidemiological information for this and other important influenza outbreaks. The Central Public Health Laboratory functions well and has provided training for regional and local laboratories.\n\nGenetic and antigenic data from human and poultry samples are being jointly analysed by staff in Egypt along with international counterparts. However, increased real-time sharing and analysis should be encouraged. The 4-way linking platform could be used to accomplish this; it should also meet fortnightly during a surge of cases and every 2 months when there are no outbreaks.\n\nThe Ministry of Health and Population has purchased antiviral drugs (neuraminidase inhibitors) [which] have been made available to clinicians for patients with suspected and laboratory-confirmed infections. This is particularly important to reduce mortality\n\nCoordination and collaboration\nCommunication for behavior change\n\nKey recommendations\n----\nCoordination and strategic planning\nMinistry of Agriculture and Land Reclamation\nMinistry of Health and Population\nCommunication for behavior change\n\nThe way forward\n----\nA successful approach to addressing H5N1 requires long-term, sustainable investments in agriculture, health and communities. In particular, close collaboration between sectors is required in communications, policy development, surveillance and response, and the production and sharing of information. Accurate, regular assessment of the impact of control measures is required to evaluate progress.\n\nThe government should undertake 1 or more pilot projects at the district level to determine which changes in policies and practices are most effective in reducing spread of infection among poultry and to humans and sustainable on a medium- to long-term basis. Addressing H5N1 nationally will require long-term changes in policies, practices, culture, awareness and community engagement.\n\nWithin 3 months, a 2-year action plan that encompasses these recommendations and includes clear outcomes and indicators for monitoring will be developed by the ministries of health, agriculture and local development. FAO, WHO and OIE will support development of the plan, which will be presented to the NSC.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[This Executive summary is the result of an invitation Egypt extended 2 months ago to the WHO, FAO, NAMRU-3, CDC and UNICEF for a joint investigation of H5N1 in the country, and to make recommendations on containing that outbreak.\n\nThe updated H5N1 case count from WHO, which covers reported cases since November 2014 to 30 April 2015,, is 165 cases and 48 deaths. This represents an increase in human cases over what has been observed in previous years in Egypt. Case fatality appears to be lower in Egypt compared with other countries, likely because children are more commonly infected in Egypt. The task of controlling spread of the virus represents a serious challenge to Egypt. While there is no evidence for other than occasional spread from human to human, the risk exists and must be closely monitored.\n\nMaps of Egypt can be found at http://www.geoatlas.com/medias/maps/countries/egypt/eg3r92t/egypt_pol.jpg and http://healthmap.org/promed/p/55. - Mod.LK]\n\n[The executive summary of the mission includes a section on the animal health aspects of HPAI H5N1 in Egypt. The following extracts deserve attention:\n\n\"A preponderance of the evidence examined by the team suggests that there has been a real and measurable increase in the incidence of H5N1 [in poultry] since June 2014. Between 1 Dec 2014 and 28 Feb 2015, 333 outbreaks in poultry were observed in Egypt, while between 1 Dec 2013 and 28 Feb 2014 there were only 44 reported outbreaks. Reports indicate that H5N1 is circulating in all sectors of poultry production and geographically in all parts of Egypt. The reasons for this increase are clearly complex and multi-factorial; however, certain factors associated with poultry production and disease control provide possible means of strengthening prevention and response. Changes in the economy and poultry industry since 2011 have had a negative impact on food safety and the capacity of the Ministry of Agriculture and Land Reclamation (MOALR) to prevent or respond to outbreaks of disease. With the reduction in control of poultry production nationally, many small farmers have turned to raising poultry for food and income in an unmonitored and uncontrolled farming sector. Evidence suggests that H5N1 virus is deeply entrenched on such farms and in household flocks. Further, implementation of a proper control strategy is currently impeded by weak response capacity, weak public-private partnerships, sub-optimal vaccination strategies and low levels of biosecurity in some poultry production sectors. [There are] 2 excellent national laboratories that contribute significantly to the diagnosis and control of avian influenza -- the National Laboratory for Quality Control of Poultry Production and Central Laboratory for Evaluation of Veterinary Biologics; both could be used more effectively by linking diagnosis with rapid response and monitoring of disease control and vaccine use.\"\n\n\"The national HPAI Integrated National Plan for Avian and Human Influenza that was developed with support from FAO after the 2009 joint-UN evaluation mission addresses many of the current challenges, but has not been implemented. This strategy should be brought up to date and put into force. Since 2007, through USAID-funded FAO projects, considerable investment has been made to improve the animal health surveillance system in Egypt, including the establishment of 230 epidemiological units covering almost all districts and governorate; 4 animal disease surveillance systems (passive reporting, community animal health outreach, targeted live bird market reporting, and active surveillance) are maintained by the Veterinary Services. Surveillance data are regularly shared between national stakeholders and with other relevant partners (OFFLU, EMPRES-i, etc.), including through publication in peer-reviewed journals\". - Mod.AS]\nSee

summary\n\nIntroduction\n----\nBetween November 2014 and February 2015, Egypt saw a major rise in the number of human cases of avian influenza A(H5N1). In fact, the number of cases occurring in this period exceeded the number of cases ever found in any country since the disease's reemergence in 2004. In view of the serious risk of a pandemic, which is enhanced by the enzootic state of H5N1 in Egypt, the Ministry for Health and Population requested a joint assessment to better understand the recent upsurge, and to provide concrete measures to curb the trend of increasing infection. From 8-12 Mar [2015], a team representing the World Health Organization (WHO), the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (US-CDC), the United States Naval Medical Research Unit 3 (US-NAMRU-3) and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) met with key stakeholders and analysed the current situation.\n\nSummary of findings\n----\n\nAnimal health (Please see in commentary below)\n\nHuman health\n----\nConcomitant with the dramatic increase in the number of poultry outbreaks, there has been an unprecedented increase in the number of human cases detected each month, particularly from December 2014 through February 2015. According to the Ministry of Health and Population, the numbers of H5N1 cases reported for these months greatly exceeded the expected numbers based on historical data.\n\nThis upsurge most likely results from increased exposure of people to infected poultry. Most recent human cases (approximately 70 percent) had exposure to backyard poultry. Children under 5 make up a significantly higher portion of all confirmed H5N1 cases in Egypt (33 percent) compared with the rest of the world (15 percent). Young children and women often are engaged in rearing backyard poultry, which puts them at high risk during poultry outbreaks.\n\nLikewise, the number of human samples being tested for H5N1 has increased compared with [during] earlier poultry outbreaks. Testing has also increased as a result of rapid response by the preventive sector and increased awareness among clinicians.\n\nDespite the unprecedented surge in human cases in Egypt, it does not appear that the risk of an H5N1 pandemic has changed appreciably. This conclusion is based on the following:\n1) although human-to-human transmission cannot be excluded, there has been no change in the size or number of clusters of human cases during the surge compared with previous years;\n2) there is no evidence of transmission from patients to healthcare workers during the surge;\n3) most recent human cases had direct or indirect poultry contact;\n4) genetic sequence data have not identified changes that would make human-to-human transmission efficient.\n\nNevertheless, the presence of H5N1 viruses in Egypt with the ability to jump more readily from birds to humans than viruses in other enzootic countries is of concern and requires a high level of vigilance from the Ministries of Health and Agriculture.\n\nThe Ministry of Health and Population has strengthened multiple disease surveillance [for] influenza-like illness (ILI), severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and avian influenza [which has] generated valuable epidemiological information for this and other important influenza outbreaks. The Central Public Health Laboratory functions well and has provided training for regional and local laboratories.\n\nGenetic and antigenic data from human and poultry samples are being jointly analysed by staff in Egypt along with international counterparts. However, increased real-time sharing and analysis should be encouraged. The 4-way linking platform could be used to accomplish this; it should also meet fortnightly during a surge of cases and every 2 months when there are no outbreaks.\n\nThe Ministry of Health and Population has purchased antiviral drugs (neuraminidase inhibitors) [which] have been made available to clinicians for patients with suspected and laboratory-confirmed infections. This is particularly important to reduce mortality\n\nCoordination and collaboration\nCommunication for behavior change\n\nKey recommendations\n----\nCoordination and strategic planning\nMinistry of Agriculture and Land Reclamation\nMinistry of Health and Population\nCommunication for behavior change\n\nThe way forward\n----\nA successful approach to addressing H5N1 requires long-term, sustainable investments in agriculture, health and communities. In particular, close collaboration between sectors is required in communications, policy development, surveillance and response, and the production and sharing of information. Accurate, regular assessment of the impact of control measures is required to evaluate progress.\n\nThe government should undertake 1 or more pilot projects at the district level to determine which changes in policies and practices are most effective in reducing spread of infection among poultry and to humans and sustainable on a medium- to long-term basis. Addressing H5N1 nationally will require long-term changes in policies, practices, culture, awareness and community engagement.\n\nWithin 3 months, a 2-year action plan that encompasses these recommendations and includes clear outcomes and indicators for monitoring will be developed by the ministries of health, agriculture and local development. FAO, WHO and OIE will support development of the plan, which will be presented to the NSC.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[This Executive summary is the result of an invitation Egypt extended 2 months ago to the WHO, FAO, NAMRU-3, CDC and UNICEF for a joint investigation of H5N1 in the country, and to make recommendations on containing that outbreak.\n\nThe updated H5N1 case count from WHO, which covers reported cases since November 2014 to 30 April 2015,, is 165 cases and 48 deaths. This represents an increase in human cases over what has been observed in previous years in Egypt. Case fatality appears to be lower in Egypt compared with other countries, likely because children are more commonly infected in Egypt.

The following extracts deserve attention:\n\n\"A preponderance of the evidence examined by the team suggests that there has been a real and measurable increase in the incidence of H5N1 [in poultry] since June 2014. Between 1 Dec 2014 and 28 Feb 2015, 333 outbreaks in poultry were observed in Egypt, while between 1 Dec 2013 and 28 Feb 2014 there were only 44 reported outbreaks. Reports indicate that H5N1 is circulating in all sectors of poultry production and geographically in all parts of Egypt. The reasons for this increase are clearly complex and multi-factorial; however, certain factors associated with poultry production and disease control provide possible means of strengthening prevention and response. Changes in the economy and poultry industry since 2011 have had a negative impact on food safety and the capacity of the Ministry of Agriculture and Land Reclamation (MOALR) to prevent or respond to outbreaks of disease. With the reduction in control of poultry production nationally, many small farmers have turned to raising poultry for food and income in an unmonitored and uncontrolled farming sector. Evidence suggests that H5N1 virus is deeply entrenched on such farms and in household flocks. Further, implementation of a proper control strategy is currently impeded by weak response capacity, weak public-private partnerships, sub-optimal vaccination strategies and low levels of biosecurity in some poultry production sectors. [There are] 2 excellent national laboratories that contribute significantly to the diagnosis and control of avian influenza -- the National Laboratory for Quality Control of Poultry Production and Central Laboratory for Evaluation of Veterinary Biologics; both could be used more effectively by linking diagnosis with rapid response and monitoring of disease control and vaccine use.\"\n\n\"The national HPAI Integrated National Plan for Avian and Human Influenza that was developed with support from FAO after the 2009 joint-UN evaluation mission addresses many of the current challenges, but has not been implemented.

Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Fri 15 May 2015\nSource: WHO/FAO/OIE/US-CDC/US-NAMRU-3/UNICEF [edited]\nhttp://www.emro.who.int/images/stories/Executive_Summary_14_May_2015.pdf?ua=1\n\n\nJoint high-level mission on the current H5N1 situation in Egypt\n-----\nEgypt, 8-12 Mar 2015\n\nExecutive summary\n\nIntroduction\n----\nBetween November 2014 and February 2015, Egypt saw a major rise in the number of human cases of avian influenza A(H5N1). In fact, the number of cases occurring in this period exceeded the number of cases ever found in any country since the disease's reemergence in 2004. In view of the serious risk of a pandemic, which is enhanced by the enzootic state of H5N1 in Egypt, the Ministry for Health and Population requested a joint assessment to better understand the recent upsurge, and to provide concrete measures to curb the trend of increasing infection. From 8-12 Mar [2015], a team representing the World Health Organization (WHO), the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (US-CDC), the United States Naval Medical Research Unit 3 (US-NAMRU-3) and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) met with key stakeholders and analysed the current situation.\n\nSummary of findings\n----\n\nAnimal health (Please see in commentary below)\n\nHuman health\n----\nConcomitant with the dramatic increase in the number of poultry outbreaks, there has been an unprecedented increase in the number of human cases detected each month, particularly from December 2014 through February 2015. According to the Ministry of Health and Population, the numbers of H5N1 cases reported for these months greatly exceeded the expected numbers based on historical data.\n\nThis upsurge most likely results from increased exposure of people to infected poultry. Most recent human cases (approximately 70 percent) had exposure to backyard poultry. Children under 5 make up a significantly higher portion of all confirmed H5N1 cases in Egypt (33 percent) compared with the rest of the world (15 percent). Young children and women often are engaged in rearing backyard poultry, which puts them at high risk during poultry outbreaks.\n\nLikewise, the number of human samples being tested for H5N1 has increased compared with [during] earlier poultry outbreaks. Testing has also increased as a result of rapid response by the preventive sector and increased awareness among clinicians.\n\nDespite the unprecedented surge in human cases in Egypt, it does not appear that the risk of an H5N1 pandemic has changed appreciably. This conclusion is based on the following:\n1) although human-to-human transmission cannot be excluded, there has been no change in the size or number of clusters of human cases during the surge compared with previous years;\n2) there is no evidence of transmission from patients to healthcare workers during the surge;\n3) most recent human cases had direct or indirect poultry contact;\n4) genetic sequence data have not identified changes that would make human-to-human transmission efficient.\n\nNevertheless, the presence of H5N1 viruses in Egypt with the ability to jump more readily from birds to humans than viruses in other enzootic countries is of concern and requires a high level of vigilance from the Ministries of Health and Agriculture.\n\nThe Ministry of Health and Population has strengthened multiple disease surveillance [for] influenza-like illness (ILI), severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and avian influenza [which has] generated valuable epidemiological information for this and other important influenza outbreaks. The Central Public Health Laboratory functions well and has provided training for regional and local laboratories.\n\nGenetic and antigenic data from human and poultry samples are being jointly analysed by staff in Egypt along with international counterparts. However, increased real-time sharing and analysis should be encouraged. The 4-way linking platform could be used to accomplish this; it should also meet fortnightly during a surge of cases and every 2 months when there are no outbreaks.\n\nThe Ministry of Health and Population has purchased antiviral drugs (neuraminidase inhibitors) [which] have been made available to clinicians for patients with suspected and laboratory-confirmed infections. This is particularly important to reduce mortality\n\nCoordination and collaboration\nCommunication for behavior change\n\nKey recommendations\n----\nCoordination and strategic planning\nMinistry of Agriculture and Land Reclamation\nMinistry of Health and Population\nCommunication for behavior change\n\nThe way forward\n----\nA successful approach to addressing H5N1 requires long-term, sustainable investments in agriculture, health and communities. In particular, close collaboration between sectors is required in communications, policy development, surveillance and response, and the production and sharing of information. Accurate, regular assessment of the impact of control measures is required to evaluate progress.\n\nThe government should undertake 1 or more pilot projects at the district level to determine which changes in policies and practices are most effective in reducing spread of infection among poultry and to humans and sustainable on a medium- to long-term basis. Addressing H5N1 nationally will require long-term changes in policies, practices, culture, awareness and community engagement.\n\nWithin 3 months, a 2-year action plan that encompasses these recommendations and includes clear outcomes and indicators for monitoring will be developed by the ministries of health, agriculture and local development. FAO, WHO and OIE will support development of the plan, which will be presented to the NSC.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[This Executive summary is the result of an invitation Egypt extended 2 months ago to the WHO, FAO, NAMRU-3, CDC and UNICEF for a joint investigation of H5N1 in the country, and to make recommendations on containing that outbreak.\n\nThe updated H5N1 case count from WHO, which covers reported cases since November 2014 to 30 April 2015,, is 165 cases and 48 deaths. This represents an increase in human cases over what has been observed in previous years in Egypt. Case fatality appears to be lower in Egypt compared with other countries, likely because children are more commonly infected in Egypt. The task of controlling spread of the virus represents a serious challenge to Egypt. While there is no evidence for other than occasional spread from human to human, the risk exists and must be closely monitored.\n\nMaps of Egypt can be found at http://www.geoatlas.com/medias/maps/countries/egypt/eg3r92t/egypt_pol.jpg and http://healthmap.org/promed/p/55. - Mod.LK]\n\n[The executive summary of the mission includes a section on the animal health aspects of HPAI H5N1 in Egypt. The following extracts deserve attention:\n\n\"A preponderance of the evidence examined by the team suggests that there has been a real and measurable increase in the incidence of H5N1 [in poultry] since June 2014. Between 1 Dec 2014 and 28 Feb 2015, 333 outbreaks in poultry were observed in Egypt, while between 1 Dec 2013 and 28 Feb 2014 there were only 44 reported outbreaks. Reports indicate that H5N1 is circulating in all sectors of poultry production and geographically in all parts of Egypt. The reasons for this increase are clearly complex and multi-factorial; however, certain factors associated with poultry production and disease control provide possible means of strengthening prevention and response. Changes in the economy and poultry industry since 2011 have had a negative impact on food safety and the capacity of the Ministry of Agriculture and Land Reclamation (MOALR) to prevent or respond to outbreaks of disease. With the reduction in control of poultry production nationally, many small farmers have turned to raising poultry for food and income in an unmonitored and uncontrolled farming sector. Evidence suggests that H5N1 virus is deeply entrenched on such farms and in household flocks. Further, implementation of a proper control strategy is currently impeded by weak response capacity, weak public-private partnerships, sub-optimal vaccination strategies and low levels of biosecurity in some poultry production sectors. [There are] 2 excellent national laboratories that contribute significantly to the diagnosis and control of avian influenza -- the National Laboratory for Quality Control of Poultry Production and Central Laboratory for Evaluation of Veterinary Biologics; both could be used more effectively by linking diagnosis with rapid response and monitoring of disease control and vaccine use.\"\n\n\"The national HPAI Integrated National Plan for Avian and Human Influenza that was developed with support from FAO after the 2009 joint-UN evaluation mission addresses many of the current challenges, but has not been implemented. This strategy should be brought up to date and put into force. Since 2007, through USAID-funded FAO projects, considerable investment has been made to improve the animal health surveillance system in Egypt, including the establishment of 230 epidemiological units covering almost all districts and governorate; 4 animal disease surveillance systems (passive reporting, community animal health outreach, targeted live bird market reporting, and active surveillance) are maintained by the Veterinary Services. Surveillance data are regularly shared between national stakeholders and with other relevant partners (OFFLU, EMPRES-i, etc.), including through publication in peer-reviewed journals\". - Mod.AS]\nSee

summary\n\nIntroduction\n----\nBetween November 2014 and February 2015, Egypt saw a major rise in the number of human cases of avian influenza A(H5N1). In fact, the number of cases occurring in this period exceeded the number of cases ever found in any country since the disease's reemergence in 2004. In view of the serious risk of a pandemic, which is enhanced by the enzootic state of H5N1 in Egypt, the Ministry for Health and Population requested a joint assessment to better understand the recent upsurge, and to provide concrete measures to curb the trend of increasing infection. From 8-12 Mar [2015], a team representing the World Health Organization (WHO), the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (US-CDC), the United States Naval Medical Research Unit 3 (US-NAMRU-3) and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) met with key stakeholders and analysed the current situation.\n\nSummary of findings\n----\n\nAnimal health (Please see in commentary below)\n\nHuman health\n----\nConcomitant with the dramatic increase in the number of poultry outbreaks, there has been an unprecedented increase in the number of human cases detected each month, particularly from December 2014 through February 2015. According to the Ministry of Health and Population, the numbers of H5N1 cases reported for these months greatly exceeded the expected numbers based on historical data.\n\nThis upsurge most likely results from increased exposure of people to infected poultry. Most recent human cases (approximately 70 percent) had exposure to backyard poultry. Children under 5 make up a significantly higher portion of all confirmed H5N1 cases in Egypt (33 percent) compared with the rest of the world (15 percent). Young children and women often are engaged in rearing backyard poultry, which puts them at high risk during poultry outbreaks.\n\nLikewise, the number of human samples being tested for H5N1 has increased compared with [during] earlier poultry outbreaks. Testing has also increased as a result of rapid response by the preventive sector and increased awareness among clinicians.\n\nDespite the unprecedented surge in human cases in Egypt, it does not appear that the risk of an H5N1 pandemic has changed appreciably. This conclusion is based on the following:\n1) although human-to-human transmission cannot be excluded, there has been no change in the size or number of clusters of human cases during the surge compared with previous years;\n2) there is no evidence of transmission from patients to healthcare workers during the surge;\n3) most recent human cases had direct or indirect poultry contact;\n4) genetic sequence data have not identified changes that would make human-to-human transmission efficient.\n\nNevertheless, the presence of H5N1 viruses in Egypt with the ability to jump more readily from birds to humans than viruses in other enzootic countries is of concern and requires a high level of vigilance from the Ministries of Health and Agriculture.\n\nThe Ministry of Health and Population has strengthened multiple disease surveillance [for] influenza-like illness (ILI), severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and avian influenza [which has] generated valuable epidemiological information for this and other important influenza outbreaks. The Central Public Health Laboratory functions well and has provided training for regional and local laboratories.\n\nGenetic and antigenic data from human and poultry samples are being jointly analysed by staff in Egypt along with international counterparts. However, increased real-time sharing and analysis should be encouraged. The 4-way linking platform could be used to accomplish this; it should also meet fortnightly during a surge of cases and every 2 months when there are no outbreaks.\n\nThe Ministry of Health and Population has purchased antiviral drugs (neuraminidase inhibitors) [which] have been made available to clinicians for patients with suspected and laboratory-confirmed infections. This is particularly important to reduce mortality\n\nCoordination and collaboration\nCommunication for behavior change\n\nKey recommendations\n----\nCoordination and strategic planning\nMinistry of Agriculture and Land Reclamation\nMinistry of Health and Population\nCommunication for behavior change\n\nThe way forward\n----\nA successful approach to addressing H5N1 requires long-term, sustainable investments in agriculture, health and communities. In particular, close collaboration between sectors is required in communications, policy development, surveillance and response, and the production and sharing of information. Accurate, regular assessment of the impact of control measures is required to evaluate progress.\n\nThe government should undertake 1 or more pilot projects at the district level to determine which changes in policies and practices are most effective in reducing spread of infection among poultry and to humans and sustainable on a medium- to long-term basis. Addressing H5N1 nationally will require long-term changes in policies, practices, culture, awareness and community engagement.\n\nWithin 3 months, a 2-year action plan that encompasses these recommendations and includes clear outcomes and indicators for monitoring will be developed by the ministries of health, agriculture and local development. FAO, WHO and OIE will support development of the plan, which will be presented to the NSC.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[This Executive summary is the result of an invitation Egypt extended 2 months ago to the WHO, FAO, NAMRU-3, CDC and UNICEF for a joint investigation of H5N1 in the country, and to make recommendations on containing that outbreak.\n\nThe updated H5N1 case count from WHO, which covers reported cases since November 2014 to 30 April 2015,, is 165 cases and 48 deaths. This represents an increase in human cases over what has been observed in previous years in Egypt. Case fatality appears to be lower in Egypt compared with other countries, likely because children are more commonly infected in Egypt. The task of controlling spread of the virus represents a serious challenge to Egypt. While there is no evidence for other than occasional spread from human to human, the risk exists and must be closely monitored.\n\nMaps of Egypt can be found at http://www.geoatlas.com/medias/maps/countries/egypt/eg3r92t/egypt_pol.jpg and http://healthmap.org/promed/p/55. - Mod.LK]\n\n[The executive summary of the mission includes a section on the animal health aspects of HPAI H5N1 in Egypt. The following extracts deserve attention:\n\n\"A preponderance of the evidence examined by the team suggests that there has been a real and measurable increase in the incidence of H5N1 [in poultry] since June 2014. Between 1 Dec 2014 and 28 Feb 2015, 333 outbreaks in poultry were observed in Egypt, while between 1 Dec 2013 and 28 Feb 2014 there were only 44 reported outbreaks. Reports indicate that H5N1 is circulating in all sectors of poultry production and geographically in all parts of Egypt. The reasons for this increase are clearly complex and multi-factorial; however, certain factors associated with poultry production and disease control provide possible means of strengthening prevention and response. Changes in the economy and poultry industry since 2011 have had a negative impact on food safety and the capacity of the Ministry of Agriculture and Land Reclamation (MOALR) to prevent or respond to outbreaks of disease. With the reduction in control of poultry production nationally, many small farmers have turned to raising poultry for food and income in an unmonitored and uncontrolled farming sector. Evidence suggests that H5N1 virus is deeply entrenched on such farms and in household flocks. Further, implementation of a proper control strategy is currently impeded by weak response capacity, weak public-private partnerships, sub-optimal vaccination strategies and low levels of biosecurity in some poultry production sectors. [There are] 2 excellent national laboratories that contribute significantly to the diagnosis and control of avian influenza -- the National Laboratory for Quality Control of Poultry Production and Central Laboratory for Evaluation of Veterinary Biologics; both could be used more effectively by linking diagnosis with rapid response and monitoring of disease control and vaccine use.\"\n\n\"The national HPAI Integrated National Plan for Avian and Human Influenza that was developed with support from FAO after the 2009 joint-UN evaluation mission addresses many of the current challenges, but has not been implemented. This strategy should be brought up to date and put into force. Since 2007, through USAID-funded FAO projects, considerable investment has been made to improve the animal health surveillance system in Egypt, including the establishment of 230 epidemiological units covering almost all districts and governorate; 4 animal disease surveillance systems (passive reporting, community animal health outreach, targeted live bird market reporting, and active surveillance) are maintained by the Veterinary Services. Surveillance data are regularly shared between national stakeholders and with other relevant partners (OFFLU, EMPRES-i, etc.), including through publication in peer-reviewed journals\". - Mod.AS]\nSee

Between 1 Dec 2014 and 28 Feb 2015, 333 outbreaks in poultry were observed in Egypt, while between 1 Dec 2013 and 28 Feb 2014 there were only 44 reported outbreaks. Reports indicate that H5N1 is circulating in all sectors of poultry production and geographically in all parts of Egypt. The reasons for this increase are clearly complex and multi-factorial; however, certain factors associated with poultry production and disease control provide possible means of strengthening prevention and response. Changes in the economy and poultry industry since 2011 have had a negative impact on food safety and the capacity of the Ministry of Agriculture and Land Reclamation (MOALR) to prevent or respond to outbreaks of disease. With the reduction in control of poultry production nationally, many small farmers have turned to raising poultry for food and income in an unmonitored and uncontrolled farming sector. Evidence suggests that H5N1 virus is deeply entrenched on such farms and in household flocks. Further, implementation of a proper control strategy is currently impeded by weak response capacity, weak public-private partnerships, sub-optimal vaccination strategies and low levels of biosecurity in some poultry production sectors. [There are] 2 excellent national laboratories that contribute significantly to the diagnosis and control of avian influenza -- the National Laboratory for Quality Control of Poultry Production and Central Laboratory for Evaluation of Veterinary Biologics; both could be used more effectively by linking diagnosis with rapid response and monitoring of disease control and vaccine use.\"\n\n\"The national HPAI Integrated National Plan for Avian and Human Influenza that was developed with support from FAO after the 2009 joint-UN evaluation mission addresses many of the current challenges, but has not been implemented. This strategy should be brought up to date and put into force. Since 2007, through USAID-funded FAO projects, considerable investment has been made to improve the animal health surveillance system in Egypt, including the establishment of 230 epidemiological units covering almost all districts and governorate; 4 animal disease surveillance systems (passive reporting, community animal health outreach, targeted live bird market reporting, and active surveillance) are maintained by the Veterinary Services. Surveillance data are regularly shared between national stakeholders and with other relevant partners (OFFLU, EMPRES-i, etc.), including through publication in peer-reviewed journals\". - Mod.AS]\nSee

country.\n\nAccording to follow-up report no 2 to the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), dated 29 Apr 2015, the veterinary authority in Burkina Faso reports 7 new outbreaks of H5N1 [highly pathogenic avian influenza] on poultry farms, all starting on 19 Apr 2015.\n\nMost of the affected farms were in the provinces of Kadiogo (5) and Poni (1), which have reported previous outbreaks, but Bazega in central Burkina Faso now has its 1st cases.\n\nOf the 18 264 bird affected, 16 009 died and 2255 were slaughtered.\nThe presence of the H5N1 subtype of the virus has been confirmed.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Since the start of the current HPAI H5N1 epizootic in Burkina Faso, in early February 2015 (initially reported to the OIE 1 Apr 2015), a total of 18 outbreaks, in 6 provinces, have been reported to the OIE. This includes the 7 new outbreaks covered in follow-up report no. 2, submitted on 30 Apr 2015, and available (with an interactive map) at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapEventSummary&reportid=17625.\n\nThe epizootic continues it spread in Nigeria and has spread to Niger as well. The virus spreading in the 3 countries is considered to be caused by a novel clade of the A(H5N1) virus, specifically clade 2.3.2.1c, which, according to a recent 'ahead of print' paper (see reference below), most likely entered Nigeria in December 2014. The authors further indicate that the identification of genetic clustering between the strains from Nigeria and the HPAI A(H5N1) viruses originally identified in Asia, suggests an unknown epidemiologic link between these regions, probably associated with human activities, migratory bird movements, or both. They further state that this virus is an intersubtype reassortant which has already caused infection in humans, underlining the urgent need for its complete characterization in terms of virulence and host range.\n\nA map showing all 18 outbreaks in Burkina Faso is available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=17455.\n\nFor further background, please refer to the commentary by Mod.CRD in ProMED-mail posting 20150402.3272825.\n\nReference\n---------\nMonne I, Meseko C, Joannis T, et al: Highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) virus in poultry, Nigeria, 2015 [letter].

This includes the 7 new outbreaks covered in follow-up report no. 2, submitted on 30 Apr 2015, and available (with an interactive map) at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapEventSummary&reportid=17625.\n\nThe epizootic continues it spread in Nigeria and has spread to Niger as well. The virus spreading in the 3 countries is considered to be caused by a novel clade of the A(H5N1) virus, specifically clade 2.3.2.1c, which, according to a recent 'ahead of print' paper (see reference below), most likely entered Nigeria in December 2014. The authors further indicate that the identification of genetic clustering between the strains from Nigeria and the HPAI A(H5N1) viruses originally identified in Asia, suggests an unknown epidemiologic link between these regions, probably associated with human activities, migratory bird movements, or both.

Viruses of this cluster may be associated with increased incidence of human influenza A(H5N1) infections in Egypt over the last months.\n\nIn Egypt, highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) influenza A(H5N1) viruses of clade 2.2.1 and their descendants have been circulating in poultry populations since 2006, causing sporadic human infections [1]. Human influenza A(H5N1) infections in Egypt have been reported since the introduction of the virus in 2006 with \u2009204 cases occurring until end of 2014 and a fatality rate of 35.8 percent in laboratory-confirmed cases reported to the World Health Organization (WHO). However, since January 2015, the incidence of human H5N1 cases in Egypt has increased dramatically: as of 21 March 2015, 116 human cases including 36 deaths have been reported to WHO [2]. This study was initiated to analyse molecular properties of H5N1 viruses that have caused outbreaks in poultry in Egypt since summer 2014 and to compare them with published sequences from H5N1 viruses obtained from recent human cases. ...

Available online: http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=21085\n\nReaders are referred to the full text and figures available at the above URL.\n\nAccording to FluTrackers, the current tally of human H5N1 cases in Egypt is 128 (https://flutrackers.com/forum/forum/china-h7n9-outbreak-tracking/143874-flutrackers-2013-15-human-case-list-of-provincial-ministry-of-health-government-confirmed-influenza-a-h7n9-cases-with-links), a number greater than the 116 quoted above by WHO. In addition, there have been heavy losses in poultry due to high infection rates. 435 outbreaks of H5N1 infections in poultry in Egypt are noted in this paper between October 2014 and February 2015, as reported to the National Laboratory for Quality Control on Poultry Production (NLQP) by Egyptian veterinary authorities. Therefore, it cannot be ruled out that this increased level of transmission in the birds in Egypt (which includes chickens, ducks, turkeys and quail) has led to increased exposure of bird handlers and buyers and backyard bird owners, and consequently increased numbers of cases. However, another possibility proposed by this paper is that the genetic changes observed in the 2015 viruses have led to greater transmissibility of the virus. The investigators found that strains analyzed since November 2014 contain distinct fixed mutations in several genome segments PB2, PB1-F2, HA, NA, M1. The emerging cluster identified in this study seems to be predominant across all poultry production sectors and has already caused 1/3rd of all human H5N1 infections reported in Egypt since 2006, in only 3 months of 2015.\n\nBut questions remain -- what are the molecular determinants that increase fitness of these viruses? What are the selective pressures acting on the virus? Are the observed genetic changes random, or is natural selection acting to favor mutations that make the virus more transmissible? Studies of the pathogenicity and transmissibility of these viruses, most likely using the ferret model, need to be conducted to answer the question of whether the genetic changes are affecting the current outbreak.\n\nMaps of Egypt can be seen at http://www.geoatlas.com/medias/maps/countries/egypt/eg3r92t/egypt_pol.jpg and http://healthmap.org/promed/p/55. - Mod.LK]\nSee Also\nAvian influenza,

distinct cluster of highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses of subtype A(H5N1) has been found to emerge within clade 2.2.1.2 in poultry in Egypt since summer 2014 and appears to have quickly become predominant. Viruses of this cluster may be associated with increased incidence of human influenza A(H5N1) infections in Egypt over the last months.\n\nIn Egypt, highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) influenza A(H5N1) viruses of clade 2.2.1 and their descendants have been circulating in poultry populations since 2006, causing sporadic human infections [1]. Human influenza A(H5N1) infections in Egypt have been reported since the introduction of the virus in 2006 with \u2009204 cases occurring until end of 2014 and a fatality rate of 35.8 percent in laboratory-confirmed cases reported to the World Health Organization (WHO). However, since January 2015, the incidence of human H5N1 cases in Egypt has increased dramatically: as of 21 March 2015, 116 human cases including 36 deaths have been reported to WHO [2]. This study was initiated to analyse molecular properties of H5N1 viruses that have caused outbreaks in poultry in Egypt since summer 2014 and to compare them with published sequences from H5N1 viruses obtained from recent human cases. ...

Available online: http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=21085\n\nReaders are referred to the full text and figures available at the above URL.\n\nAccording to FluTrackers, the current tally of human H5N1 cases in Egypt is 128 (https://flutrackers.com/forum/forum/china-h7n9-outbreak-tracking/143874-flutrackers-2013-15-human-case-list-of-provincial-ministry-of-health-government-confirmed-influenza-a-h7n9-cases-with-links), a number greater than the 116 quoted above by WHO. In addition, there have been heavy losses in poultry due to high infection rates. 435 outbreaks of H5N1 infections in poultry in Egypt are noted in this paper between October 2014 and February 2015, as reported to the National Laboratory for Quality Control on Poultry Production (NLQP) by Egyptian veterinary authorities. Therefore, it cannot be ruled out that this increased level of transmission in the birds in Egypt (which includes chickens, ducks, turkeys and quail) has led to increased exposure of bird handlers and buyers and backyard bird owners, and consequently increased numbers of cases. However, another possibility proposed by this paper is that the genetic changes observed in the 2015 viruses have led to greater transmissibility of the virus. The investigators found that strains analyzed since November 2014 contain distinct fixed mutations in several genome segments PB2, PB1-F2, HA, NA, M1. The emerging cluster identified in this study seems to be predominant across all poultry production sectors and has already caused 1/3rd of all human H5N1 infections reported in Egypt since 2006, in only 3 months of 2015.\n\nBut questions remain -- what are the molecular determinants that increase fitness of these viruses? What are the selective pressures acting on the virus? Are the observed genetic changes random, or is natural selection acting to favor mutations that make the virus more transmissible? Studies of the pathogenicity and transmissibility of these viruses, most likely using the ferret model, need to be conducted to answer the question of whether the genetic changes are affecting the current outbreak.\n\nMaps of Egypt can be seen at http://www.geoatlas.com/medias/maps/countries/egypt/eg3r92t/egypt_pol.jpg and http://healthmap.org/promed/p/55. - Mod.LK]\nSee Also\nAvian influenza,

In addition, there have been heavy losses in poultry due to high infection rates. 435 outbreaks of H5N1 infections in poultry in Egypt are noted in this paper between October 2014 and February 2015, as reported to the National Laboratory for Quality Control on Poultry Production (NLQP) by Egyptian veterinary authorities. Therefore, it cannot be ruled out that this increased level of transmission in the birds in Egypt (which includes chickens, ducks, turkeys and quail) has led to increased exposure of bird handlers and buyers and backyard bird owners, and consequently increased numbers of cases. However, another possibility proposed by this paper is that the genetic changes observed in the 2015 viruses have led to greater transmissibility of the virus. The investigators found that strains analyzed since November 2014 contain distinct fixed mutations in several genome segments PB2, PB1-F2, HA, NA, M1. The emerging cluster identified in this study seems to be predominant across all poultry production sectors and has already caused 1/3rd of all human H5N1 infections reported in Egypt since 2006, in only 3 months of 2015.\n\nBut questions remain -- what are the molecular determinants that increase fitness of these viruses? What are the selective pressures acting on the virus? Are the observed genetic changes random, or is natural selection acting to favor mutations that make the virus more transmissible? Studies of the pathogenicity and transmissibility of these viruses, most likely using the ferret model, need to be conducted to answer the question of whether the genetic changes are affecting the current outbreak.\n\nMaps of Egypt can be seen at http://www.geoatlas.com/medias/maps/countries/egypt/eg3r92t/egypt_pol.jpg and http://healthmap.org/promed/p/55. - Mod.LK]\nSee Also\nAvian influenza,

influenza A(H5N1) virus clade 2.2.1.2 with putative human health impact in Egypt, 2014/15\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAbstract\n--------\nA distinct cluster of highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses of subtype A(H5N1) has been found to emerge within clade 2.2.1.2 in poultry in Egypt since summer 2014 and appears to have quickly become predominant. Viruses of this cluster may be associated with increased incidence of human influenza A(H5N1) infections in Egypt over the last months.\n\nIn Egypt, highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) influenza A(H5N1) viruses of clade 2.2.1 and their descendants have been circulating in poultry populations since 2006, causing sporadic human infections [1]. Human influenza A(H5N1) infections in Egypt have been reported since the introduction of the virus in 2006 with \u2009204 cases occurring until end of 2014 and a fatality rate of 35.8 percent in laboratory-confirmed cases reported to the World Health Organization (WHO). However, since January 2015, the incidence of human H5N1 cases in Egypt has increased dramatically: as of 21 March 2015, 116 human cases including 36 deaths have been reported to WHO [2]. This study was initiated to analyse molecular properties of H5N1 viruses that have caused outbreaks in poultry in Egypt since summer 2014 and to compare them with published sequences from H5N1 viruses obtained from recent human cases. ...

distinct cluster of highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses of subtype A(H5N1) has been found to emerge within clade 2.2.1.2 in poultry in Egypt since summer 2014 and appears to have quickly become predominant. Viruses of this cluster may be associated with increased incidence of human influenza A(H5N1) infections in Egypt over the last months.\n\nIn Egypt, highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) influenza A(H5N1) viruses of clade 2.2.1 and their descendants have been circulating in poultry populations since 2006, causing sporadic human infections [1]. Human influenza A(H5N1) infections in Egypt have been reported since the introduction of the virus in 2006 with \u2009204 cases occurring until end of 2014 and a fatality rate of 35.8 percent in laboratory-confirmed cases reported to the World Health Organization (WHO). However, since January 2015, the incidence of human H5N1 cases in Egypt has increased dramatically: as of 21 March 2015, 116 human cases including 36 deaths have been reported to WHO [2]. This study was initiated to analyse molecular properties of H5N1 viruses that have caused outbreaks in poultry in Egypt since summer 2014 and to compare them with published sequences from H5N1 viruses obtained from recent human cases. ...

In addition, there have been heavy losses in poultry due to high infection rates. 435 outbreaks of H5N1 infections in poultry in Egypt are noted in this paper between October 2014 and February 2015, as reported to the National Laboratory for Quality Control on Poultry Production (NLQP) by Egyptian veterinary authorities. Therefore, it cannot be ruled out that this increased level of transmission in the birds in Egypt (which includes chickens, ducks, turkeys and quail) has led to increased exposure of bird handlers and buyers and backyard bird owners, and consequently increased numbers of cases. However, another possibility proposed by this paper is that the genetic changes observed in the 2015 viruses have led to greater transmissibility of the virus. The investigators found that strains analyzed since November 2014 contain distinct fixed mutations in several genome segments PB2, PB1-F2, HA, NA, M1. The emerging cluster identified in this study seems to be predominant across all poultry production sectors and has already caused 1/3rd of all human H5N1 infections reported in Egypt since 2006, in only 3 months of 2015.\n\nBut questions remain -- what are the molecular determinants that increase fitness of these viruses? What are the selective pressures acting on the virus? Are the observed genetic changes random, or is natural selection acting to favor mutations that make the virus more transmissible?

influenza A(H5N1) virus clade 2.2.1.2 with putative human health impact in Egypt, 2014/15\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAbstract\n--------\nA distinct cluster of highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses of subtype A(H5N1) has been found to emerge within clade 2.2.1.2 in poultry in Egypt since summer 2014 and appears to have quickly become predominant. Viruses of this cluster may be associated with increased incidence of human influenza A(H5N1) infections in Egypt over the last months.\n\nIn Egypt, highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) influenza A(H5N1) viruses of clade 2.2.1 and their descendants have been circulating in poultry populations since 2006, causing sporadic human infections [1]. Human influenza A(H5N1) infections in Egypt have been reported since the introduction of the virus in 2006 with \u2009204 cases occurring until end of 2014 and a fatality rate of 35.8 percent in laboratory-confirmed cases reported to the World Health Organization (WHO). However, since January 2015, the incidence of human H5N1 cases in Egypt has increased dramatically: as of 21 March 2015, 116 human cases including 36 deaths have been reported to WHO [2]. This study was initiated to analyse molecular properties of H5N1 viruses that have caused outbreaks in poultry in Egypt since summer 2014 and to compare them with published sequences from H5N1 viruses obtained from recent human cases. ...

Available online: http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=21085\n\nReaders are referred to the full text and figures available at the above URL.\n\nAccording to FluTrackers, the current tally of human H5N1 cases in Egypt is 128 (https://flutrackers.com/forum/forum/china-h7n9-outbreak-tracking/143874-flutrackers-2013-15-human-case-list-of-provincial-ministry-of-health-government-confirmed-influenza-a-h7n9-cases-with-links), a number greater than the 116 quoted above by WHO. In addition, there have been heavy losses in poultry due to high infection rates. 435 outbreaks of H5N1 infections in poultry in Egypt are noted in this paper between October 2014 and February 2015, as reported to the National Laboratory for Quality Control on Poultry Production (NLQP) by Egyptian veterinary authorities. Therefore, it cannot be ruled out that this increased level of transmission in the birds in Egypt (which includes chickens, ducks, turkeys and quail) has led to increased exposure of bird handlers and buyers and backyard bird owners, and consequently increased numbers of cases. However, another possibility proposed by this paper is that the genetic changes observed in the 2015 viruses have led to greater transmissibility of the virus. The investigators found that strains analyzed since November 2014 contain distinct fixed mutations in several genome segments PB2, PB1-F2, HA, NA, M1. The emerging cluster identified in this study seems to be predominant across all poultry production sectors and has already caused 1/3rd of all human H5N1 infections reported in Egypt since 2006, in only 3 months of 2015.\n\nBut questions remain -- what are the molecular determinants that increase fitness of these viruses? What are the selective pressures acting on the virus? Are the observed genetic changes random, or is natural selection acting to favor mutations that make the virus more transmissible? Studies of the pathogenicity and transmissibility of these viruses, most likely using the ferret model, need to be conducted to answer the question of whether the genetic changes are affecting the current outbreak.\n\nMaps of Egypt can be seen at http://www.geoatlas.com/medias/maps/countries/egypt/eg3r92t/egypt_pol.jpg and http://healthmap.org/promed/p/55. - Mod.LK]\nSee Also\nAvian influenza,

Sat [7 Mar 2015] the deaths of 2 women infected with the H5N1 bird flu virus, the state news agency MENA reported. The women are from the governorates of Menufia and Sharqiya the Health Ministry said in a statement reported by MENA.\n\nThe virus has killed over a dozen this year [2015] alone, according to Health Ministry figures.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[According to the FAO/WHO, as of more than 2 weeks ago, there has been a net increase of 108 cases and 39 deaths since 1 Nov 2014.

[Epub ahead of print] http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/25552718/\n\n\"Abstract\n---------\nThe majority of influenza virus-specific antibodies elicited by vaccination or natural infection is only effective against the eliciting or closely related viruses. Rare stem-specific heterosubtypic monoclonal antibodies (hmAbs) can neutralize multiple strains and subtypes by preventing hemagglutinin (HA)-mediated fusion of the viral with the endosomal membrane. The epitopes recognized by these hmAbs are therefore considered promising targets for the development of pan-influenza vaccines. Here we report the isolation of a novel human HA-stem-reactive monoclonal antibody, mAb 1.12, with exceptionally broad neutralizing activity encompassing viruses from 15 distinct HA subtypes. Using mAb 1.12 and 2 other monoclonal antibodies, we could demonstrate that neutralization by hmAbs is virtually irreversible but becomes severely impaired following virus attachment to cells. In contrast, no interference by human anti-influenza serum antibodies was found, indicating that apically binding antibodies do not impair access to the membrane-proximal heterosubtypic epitopes. Our findings therefore encourage development of new vaccine concepts aiming at the induction of stem-specific heterosubtypic antibodies, as we provide support for their effectiveness in individuals previously exposed to influenza virus.\"\n\nOdagiri T, Matsuzaki Y, Okamoto et al.

[Epub ahead of print] http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/25552361/\n\n\"Abstract\n---------\nFrom November 2009 to December 2013, 15 influenza C viruses were isolated, using MDCK cells, from specimens obtained from children with severe pneumonia and influenza-like illness (ILI), in the Philippines. This is the 1st report of influenza C virus isolation in the Philippines. In addition, from January 2008 to December 2013, 7 influenza C viruses were isolated from specimens that were obtained from children with acute respiratory illness (ARI) in Sendai city, Japan. Antigenic analysis with monoclonal antibodies to the hemaggultinin-esterase (HE) glycoprotein showed that 19 strains (12 from Philippines and 7 from Japan) were similar to the reference strain C/Sao Paulo/378/82(SP82). Phylogenetic analysis of the HE gene showed that strains from the Philippines and Japan formed distinct clusters within an SP82-related lineage. The clusters including the Philippine and Japanese strains were shown to have diverged from a common ancestor around 1993. In addition, phylogenetic analysis of internal genes showed that all strains isolated in the Philippines and Japan had emerged through reassortment events. The composition of the internal genes of the Philippine strains was different from that of the Japanese strains, although all strains were classified into an SP82-related lineage by HE gene sequence analysis. These observations suggest that the influenza C viruses analyzed here had emerged through different reassortment events; however, the time and place at which the reassortment events occurred could not be determined.\" - Mod.LK]\nSee Also\nAvian influenza, human (05): China (SZ, GD) H7N9 20150106.3075021\nAvian influenza, human (04): Egypt (MF, GZ) fatal, China (HK) 20150105.3072586\nAvian

of human H5N1 influenza cases in Egypt continued with at least 4 more over the past 5 days, along with 2 deaths, according to media and government reports.\n\nTwo cases involved a 6-year-old girl from Giza governorate who was in critical condition and a 45-year-old man from Menoufiya governorate who was on a respirator, according to a machine-translated Egyptian Ministry of Health (MOH) statement that was posted 1 Jan [2015] on the infectious-disease blog Avian Flu Diary (AFD).\n\nThe 2 cases raised Egypt's H5N1 count for 2014 to 29 cases, with 11 deaths, the MOH said.\n\nThe 45-year-old man apparently died of his illness, as a 3 Jan [2015] English-language report from Ahram Online noted the death of a 45-year-old Menoufiya man that day. It said he had had pneumonia and had been on a ventilator.\n\nTwo additional cases, both in Minya governorate, were revealed today [5 Jan 2015] in a machine-translated AhramOnline report posted on AFD (with a note that a subsequent MOH statement matched it). They involve a 30-year-old man in \"medium\" condition and an 11-year-old boy in critical condition.\n\nThe other death involved a 3-year-old child from Giza governorate, according to a story today [5 Jan 2015] in the Jerusalem Post, citing the MOH. The description matched that of a case-patient reported by the MOH on 31 Dec [2014].

Rare stem-specific heterosubtypic monoclonal antibodies (hmAbs) can neutralize multiple strains and subtypes by preventing hemagglutinin (HA)-mediated fusion of the viral with the endosomal membrane. The epitopes recognized by these hmAbs are therefore considered promising targets for the development of pan-influenza vaccines. Here we report the isolation of a novel human HA-stem-reactive monoclonal antibody, mAb 1.12, with exceptionally broad neutralizing activity encompassing viruses from 15 distinct HA subtypes. Using mAb 1.12 and 2 other monoclonal antibodies, we could demonstrate that neutralization by hmAbs is virtually irreversible but becomes severely impaired following virus attachment to cells. In contrast, no interference by human anti-influenza serum antibodies was found, indicating that apically binding antibodies do not impair access to the membrane-proximal heterosubtypic epitopes. Our findings therefore encourage development of new vaccine concepts aiming at the induction of stem-specific heterosubtypic antibodies, as we provide support for their effectiveness in individuals previously exposed to influenza virus.\"\n\nOdagiri T, Matsuzaki Y, Okamoto et al.

This is the 1st report of influenza C virus isolation in the Philippines. In addition, from January 2008 to December 2013, 7 influenza C viruses were isolated from specimens that were obtained from children with acute respiratory illness (ARI) in Sendai city, Japan. Antigenic analysis with monoclonal antibodies to the hemaggultinin-esterase (HE) glycoprotein showed that 19 strains (12 from Philippines and 7 from Japan) were similar to the reference strain C/Sao Paulo/378/82(SP82). Phylogenetic analysis of the HE gene showed that strains from the Philippines and Japan formed distinct clusters within an SP82-related lineage. The clusters including the Philippine and Japanese strains were shown to have diverged from a common ancestor around 1993. In addition, phylogenetic analysis of internal genes showed that all strains isolated in the Philippines and Japan had emerged through reassortment events. The composition of the internal genes of the Philippine strains was different from that of the Japanese strains, although all strains were classified into an SP82-related lineage by HE gene sequence analysis. These observations suggest that the influenza C viruses analyzed here had emerged through different reassortment events; however, the time and place at which the reassortment events occurred could not

They involve a 30-year-old man in \"medium\" condition and an 11-year-old boy in critical condition.\n\nThe other death involved a 3-year-old child from Giza governorate, according to a story today [5 Jan 2015] in the Jerusalem Post, citing the MOH. The description matched that of a case-patient reported by the MOH on 31 Dec [2014].

Rare stem-specific heterosubtypic monoclonal antibodies (hmAbs) can neutralize multiple strains and subtypes by preventing hemagglutinin (HA)-mediated fusion of the viral with the endosomal membrane. The epitopes recognized by these hmAbs are therefore considered promising targets for the development of pan-influenza vaccines. Here we report the isolation of a novel human HA-stem-reactive monoclonal antibody, mAb 1.12, with exceptionally broad neutralizing activity encompassing viruses from 15 distinct HA subtypes. Using mAb 1.12 and 2 other monoclonal antibodies, we could demonstrate that neutralization by hmAbs is virtually irreversible but becomes severely impaired following virus attachment to cells. In contrast, no interference by human anti-influenza serum antibodies was found, indicating that apically binding antibodies do not impair access to the membrane-proximal heterosubtypic epitopes. Our findings therefore encourage development of new vaccine concepts aiming at the induction of stem-specific heterosubtypic antibodies, as we provide support for their effectiveness in individuals previously exposed to influenza virus.\"\n\nOdagiri T, Matsuzaki Y, Okamoto et al.

They involve a 30-year-old man in \"medium\" condition and an 11-year-old boy in critical condition.\n\nThe other death involved a 3-year-old child from Giza governorate, according to a story today [5 Jan 2015] in the Jerusalem Post, citing the MOH. The description matched that of a case-patient reported by the MOH on 31 Dec [2014].

Rare stem-specific heterosubtypic monoclonal antibodies (hmAbs) can neutralize multiple strains and subtypes by preventing hemagglutinin (HA)-mediated fusion of the viral with the endosomal membrane. The epitopes recognized by these hmAbs are therefore considered promising targets for the development of pan-influenza vaccines. Here we report the isolation of a novel human HA-stem-reactive monoclonal antibody, mAb 1.12, with exceptionally broad neutralizing activity encompassing viruses from 15 distinct HA subtypes. Using mAb 1.12 and 2 other monoclonal antibodies, we could demonstrate that neutralization by hmAbs is virtually irreversible but becomes severely impaired following virus attachment to cells. In contrast, no interference by human anti-influenza serum antibodies was found, indicating that apically binding antibodies do not impair access to the membrane-proximal heterosubtypic epitopes. Our findings therefore encourage development of new vaccine concepts aiming at the induction of stem-specific heterosubtypic antibodies, as we provide support for their effectiveness in individuals previously exposed to influenza virus.\"\n\nOdagiri T, Matsuzaki Y, Okamoto et al.

of human H5N1 influenza cases in Egypt continued with at least 4 more over the past 5 days, along with 2 deaths, according to media and government reports.\n\nTwo cases involved a 6-year-old girl from Giza governorate who was in critical condition and a 45-year-old man from Menoufiya governorate who was on a respirator, according to a machine-translated Egyptian Ministry of Health (MOH) statement that was posted 1 Jan [2015] on the infectious-disease blog Avian Flu Diary (AFD).\n\nThe 2 cases raised Egypt's H5N1 count for 2014 to 29 cases, with 11 deaths, the MOH said.\n\nThe 45-year-old man apparently died of his illness, as a 3 Jan [2015] English-language report from Ahram Online noted the death of a 45-year-old Menoufiya man that day. It said he had had pneumonia and had been on a ventilator.\n\nTwo additional cases, both in Minya governorate, were revealed today [5 Jan 2015] in a machine-translated AhramOnline report posted on AFD (with a note that a subsequent MOH statement matched it). They involve a 30-year-old man in \"medium\" condition and an 11-year-old boy in critical condition.\n\nThe other death involved a 3-year-old child from Giza governorate, according to a story today [5 Jan 2015] in the Jerusalem Post, citing the MOH. The description matched that of a case-patient reported by the MOH on 31 Dec [2014]. It was not clear today whether the 3-year-old Giza child had any connection with the 6-year-old Giza girl whose case was reported 1 Jan [2015].\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[2] China (Guangdong): H7N9\nDate: Wed 7 Jan 2015\nSource: Hong Kong Centre for Health Protection [edited]\nhttp://www.chp.gov.hk/en/view_content/37773.html\n\n\nCHP notified of human case of avian influenza A(H7N9) in Zhaoqing [Guangdong province]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) is today [7 Jan 2015] closely monitoring an additional human case of avian influenza A(H7N9) in Zhaoqing notified by the Health and Family Planning Commission of Guangdong Province (GDHFPC), and again urged the public to maintain strict personal, food and environmental hygiene both locally and during travel.\n\nAccording to the GDHFPC, the male patient, aged 56 with underlying illnesses, was hospitalised for management in critical condition.\n\nTo date, 458 human cases of avian influenza A(H7N9) have been reported by the Mainland health authorities, respectively in Zhejiang (141 cases), Guangdong (115 cases), Jiangsu (59 cases), Shanghai (42 cases), Hunan (24 cases), Fujian (23 cases), Anhui (17 cases), Jiangxi (8 cases), Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (8 cases), Beijing (5 cases), Shandong (5 cases), Henan (4 cases), Guangxi (3 cases), Jilin (2 cases), Guizhou (1 case) and Hebei (1 case).\n\nAll boundary control points have implemented health surveillance measures.

[Epub ahead of print] http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/25552718/\n\n\"Abstract\n---------\nThe majority of influenza virus-specific antibodies elicited by vaccination or natural infection is only effective against the eliciting or closely related viruses. Rare stem-specific heterosubtypic monoclonal antibodies (hmAbs) can neutralize multiple strains and subtypes by preventing hemagglutinin (HA)-mediated fusion of the viral with the endosomal membrane. The epitopes recognized by these hmAbs are therefore considered promising targets for the development of pan-influenza vaccines. Here we report the isolation of a novel human HA-stem-reactive monoclonal antibody, mAb 1.12, with exceptionally broad neutralizing activity encompassing viruses from 15 distinct HA subtypes. Using mAb 1.12 and 2 other monoclonal antibodies, we could demonstrate that neutralization by hmAbs is virtually irreversible but becomes severely impaired following virus attachment to cells. In contrast, no interference by human anti-influenza serum antibodies was found, indicating that apically binding antibodies do not impair access to the membrane-proximal heterosubtypic epitopes. Our findings therefore encourage development of new vaccine concepts aiming at the induction of stem-specific heterosubtypic antibodies, as we provide support for their effectiveness in individuals previously exposed to influenza virus.\"\n\nOdagiri T, Matsuzaki Y, Okamoto et al.

[Epub ahead of print] http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/25552361/\n\n\"Abstract\n---------\nFrom November 2009 to December 2013, 15 influenza C viruses were isolated, using MDCK cells, from specimens obtained from children with severe pneumonia and influenza-like illness (ILI), in the Philippines. This is the 1st report of influenza C virus isolation in the Philippines. In addition, from January 2008 to December 2013, 7 influenza C viruses were isolated from specimens that were obtained from children with acute respiratory illness (ARI) in Sendai city, Japan. Antigenic analysis with monoclonal antibodies to the hemaggultinin-esterase (HE) glycoprotein showed that 19 strains (12 from Philippines and 7 from Japan) were similar to the reference strain C/Sao Paulo/378/82(SP82). Phylogenetic analysis of the HE gene showed that strains from the Philippines and Japan formed distinct clusters within an SP82-related lineage. The clusters including the Philippine and Japanese strains were shown to have diverged from a common ancestor around 1993. In addition, phylogenetic analysis of internal genes showed that all strains isolated in the Philippines and Japan had emerged through reassortment events. The composition of the internal genes of the Philippine strains was different from that of the Japanese strains, although all strains were classified into an SP82-related lineage by HE gene sequence analysis. These observations suggest that the influenza C viruses analyzed here had emerged through different reassortment events; however, the time and place at which the reassortment events occurred could not be determined.\" - Mod.LK]\nSee Also\nAvian influenza, human (05): China (SZ, GD) H7N9 20150106.3075021\nAvian influenza, human (04): Egypt (MF, GZ) fatal, China (HK) 20150105.3072586\nAvian

The patient was moved to Binh Phuoc provincial General Hospital 6 days later, yet his health continued deteriorating quickly. He was then brought to HCM City Hospital for Tropical Diseases on 18 Jan 2014 for emergency treatment, but he died on the same day. His blood sample tested positive for the deadly virulent strain A/H5N1. He was said to have slaughtered ducks and eaten duck meat. Epidemiological examinations show that a number of chickens raised by the patient's family and neighbours died of unknown causes.\n\nThe Preventive Medicine Department directed the Binh Phuoc provincial Department of Health to conduct epidemiological tests and intensify measures against a possible outbreak of bird flu in the locality.

According to the release (http://www.cdcmoh.gov.kh/PressRelease/43-Pressrelease_Eg.pdf): The case is a 6-year-old girl from Romdoul village, Romdoul commune, Phnom Preuk district, Battambang province confirmed positive for H5N avian influenza virus infection on 24 Oct 2013 by Institut Pasteur du Cambodge. The girl developed fever on 14 Oct 2013. On 15 Oct 2013, her parents sought treatment for her in the village. The girl's condition worsened and the girl was referred to the Jayavarman VII Hospital in Siem Reap. On 19 Oct 2013 she was admitted to the Jayavarman VII Hospital with fever, cough, abdominal pain, running nose, sore throat and dyspnea. Laboratory samples were taken on 22 Oct 2013 and Tamiflu administered on 24 Oct 2013. The girl is currently in a stable condition.\n\nThis brings the total number of human H5N1 avian influenza cases to 22 this year [2013]. The investigation reveals that chickens and ducks have recently died in the girl's neighbor's house and in nearly villages. Health officials in Cambodia are identifying the child's close contacts as well as studying whether there are any epidemiologic links among the 22 patients infected this year.

According to the release (http://www.cdcmoh.gov.kh/PressRelease/43-Pressrelease_Eg.pdf): The case is a 6-year-old girl from Romdoul village, Romdoul commune, Phnom Preuk district, Battambang province confirmed positive for H5N avian influenza virus infection on 24 Oct 2013 by Institut Pasteur du Cambodge. The girl developed fever on 14 Oct 2013. On 15 Oct 2013, her parents sought treatment for her in the village. The girl's condition worsened and the girl was referred to the Jayavarman VII Hospital in Siem Reap. On 19 Oct 2013 she was admitted to the Jayavarman VII Hospital with fever, cough, abdominal pain, running nose, sore throat and dyspnea. Laboratory samples were taken on 22 Oct 2013 and Tamiflu administered on 24 Oct 2013. The girl is currently in a stable condition.\n\nThis brings the total number of human H5N1 avian influenza cases to 22 this year [2013]. The investigation reveals that chickens and ducks have recently died in the girl's neighbor's house and in nearly villages. Health officials in Cambodia are identifying the child's close contacts as well as studying whether there are any epidemiologic links among the 22 patients infected this year. Animal health workers are investigating deaths in birds in the area. A statement from Minister of Health Dr. Mam Bunheng points out the special danger of H5N1 to children in that they commonly care for, feed, and clean the cages of domestic poultry and often treat them as pets.

According to the release (http://www.cdcmoh.gov.kh/PressRelease/43-Pressrelease_Eg.pdf): The case is a 6-year-old girl from Romdoul village, Romdoul commune, Phnom Preuk district, Battambang province confirmed positive for H5N avian influenza virus infection on 24 Oct 2013 by Institut Pasteur du Cambodge. The girl developed fever on 14 Oct 2013. On 15 Oct 2013, her parents sought treatment for her in the village. The girl's condition worsened and the girl was referred to the Jayavarman VII Hospital in Siem Reap. On 19 Oct 2013 she was admitted to the Jayavarman VII Hospital with fever, cough, abdominal pain, running nose, sore throat and dyspnea. Laboratory samples were taken on 22 Oct 2013 and Tamiflu administered on 24 Oct 2013. The girl is currently in a stable condition.\n\nThis brings the total number of human H5N1 avian influenza cases to 22 this year [2013]. The investigation reveals that chickens and ducks have recently died in the girl's neighbor's house and in nearly villages. Health officials in Cambodia are identifying the child's close contacts as well as studying whether there are any epidemiologic links among the 22 patients infected this year. Animal health workers are investigating deaths in birds in the area. A statement from Minister of Health Dr. Mam Bunheng points out the special danger of H5N1 to children in that they commonly care for, feed, and clean the cages of domestic poultry and often treat them as pets.

According to the release (http://www.cdcmoh.gov.kh/PressRelease/43-Pressrelease_Eg.pdf): The case is a 6-year-old girl from Romdoul village, Romdoul commune, Phnom Preuk district, Battambang province confirmed positive for H5N avian influenza virus infection on 24 Oct 2013 by Institut Pasteur du Cambodge. The girl developed fever on 14 Oct 2013. On 15 Oct 2013, her parents sought treatment for her in the village. The girl's condition worsened and the girl was referred to the Jayavarman VII Hospital in Siem Reap. On 19 Oct 2013 she was admitted to the Jayavarman VII Hospital with fever, cough, abdominal pain, running nose, sore throat and dyspnea. Laboratory samples were taken on 22 Oct 2013 and Tamiflu administered on 24 Oct 2013. The girl is currently in a stable condition.\n\nThis brings the total number of human H5N1 avian influenza cases to 22 this year [2013]. The investigation reveals that chickens and ducks have recently died in the girl's neighbor's house and in nearly villages. Health officials in Cambodia are identifying the child's close contacts as well as studying whether there are any epidemiologic links among the 22 patients infected this year. Animal health workers are investigating deaths in birds in the area. A statement from Minister of Health Dr. Mam Bunheng points out the special danger of H5N1 to children in that they commonly care for, feed, and clean the cages of domestic poultry and often treat them as pets. Parents are being urged through public health education campaigns to keep children away from sick or dead poultry, not allow them to play with chickens and ducks, and make sure they wash their hands with soap and water before eating and after contact with poultry.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Of the 33 confirmed human cases of H5N1 avian influenza virus recorded globally during 2013, a total of 22 have occurred in Cambodia.\n\nA map of the administrative divisions of Cambodia, showing the location of Battambang province, can be accessed at: http://www.vidiani.com/?p=3257. - Mod.CP\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/r/90qV.]\nSee Also\nAvian influenza, human (130): China, H7N9, CDC 20131031.20325\nAvian influenza, human (129): China, H7N9 vaccine work 20131027.2023660\nAvian influenza, human (128): China (ZJ) H7N9, WHO 20131027.2022829\nAvian influenza, human (127): Netherlands, H7N9 research intention 20131024.2019333\nAvian influenza, human (126) - China (ZJ): H7N9 re-emergence 20131024.2019232\nAvian influenza, human (125): China (ZJ) H7N9 update 20131024.201862\nAvian influenza, human (124): Cambodia (KT) H5N1, WHO 20131023.2016517\nAvian influenza, human (123): China (ZJ) H7N9, WHO 20131019.2009083\nAvian influenza, human (122): China (ZJ) H7N9, alert 20131015.2002724\nAvian influenza, human (121): Indonesia (WJ) H5N1, additional information 20131010.1995164\nAvian influenza, human (120): H7N9 genesis & source 20131010.1994804\nAvian influenza, human (119): Indonesia (WJ) H5N1, fatal 20131008.1990523\nAvian influenza, human (118): China, H7N9 low transmission potential 20131005.1982621\nAvian influenza, human (117): China, H7N9 origin and evolution 20130920.1958765\nAvian influenza, human (114): China (H7N9) receptor properties 20130910.1935545\nAvian influenza, human (111): China, H7N9, re-emergence prospects 20130822.1895874\nAvian influenza, human (109) China: H5N1 & H7N9 emergence 20130822.1892436\nAvian influenza, human (108): China (ZJ) H7N9, fecal spread 20130815.1882716\nAvian influenza, human (106): China (ZJ) H7N9, seroprevalence 20130813.1878600\nAvian influenza, human (105): China (HB) H7N9, update 20130812.1877136\nAvian influenza, human (102): China, susp. human-to-human infection 20130806.1867206\nAvian influenza, human (97): (H7N9) animal studies 20130714.1824448\nAvian influenza, human (96): China: (SH) role of immune response 20130714.1824349\nAvian influenza, human (94): H7N9 transmissibility characteristics 20130711.1820245\nAvian influenza, human (88): China, H7N9, relative severity 20130624.1789634\nAvian influenza, human (83): China, H7N9 transmissibility in ferrets & pigs 20130524.1735447\nAvian influenza, human (82): China H7N9 update 20130521.1729018\nAvian influenza, human (81): China CDC/WHO H7N9 Mission Report 20130518.1722238\n.................................................cp/je/mpp", "reports": [{"diseases": [], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2013-03-16 00:00:00", "2021-03-17 00:00:00", "2013-03-16 00:00:00", "2013-03-16 00:00:00", "2013-03-16 00:00:00", "2013-03-16 00:00:00", "2013-03-16 00:00:00", "1997-03-16 00:00:00", "1988-03-16 00:00:00", "1983-03-16 00:00:00", "1982-03-16 00:00:00", "1981-03-16 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Indonesia", "country": "Indonesia"}, {"location": "the Kingdom of Cambodia", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Cambodia", "country": "Cambodia"}, {"location": "Netherlands", "country": "Netherlands"}, {"location": "Battambang Province", "country": "Cambodia"}, {"location": "Battambang province", "country": "Cambodia"}, {"location": "China", "country": "China"}, {"location": "Romdoul village", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "2016517", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Avian influenza, human (124): Cambodia (KT) H5N1, WHO", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=2016517", "date": "2013-08-14 14:33:59", "main_text": "AVIAN INFLUENZA (82): NEPAL (BHAKTAPUR, KAVREPALANCHOK) H5N1 SUSPECTED, REQUEST FOR INFORMATION\n***********************************************************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Tue 13 Aug 2013\nSource: e-Kantipur [summ., edited]\nhttp://ekantipur.com/2013/08/13/top-story/more-flu-cases-confirmed-kavre-hit/376335.html\n\n\nMore flu cases confirmed;

Soon after, other ducks in fattening cages also showed the same signs with some mortalities. Initially, these signs were thought to be due to a problem in the feed. On 2 May 2013, with increasing mortality noticed in the ducks, the Central Veterinary Station (CVS) was informed and some samples were sent for testing. Testing confirmed the samples to be positive for H5 HPAI. Follow-up testing with RT-PCR on 7 May 2013, confirmed the samples as positive for H5N1. More than 2000 adult ducks, 42 000 fattening ducks, and 129 000 ducklings (younger than 20 days) died or were culled. It is assumed that some ducks were free-range and might have had the opportunity to contact H5N1 infected wild birds.\n\n\"Disease control measures were strictly taken and appropriate biosecurity was strictly enforced. Public awareness activities for the factory workers and residents around, as well as an epidemiological survey, have vigorously been conducted, and to date [9 May 2013], no human illness due to H5N1 has been found. Delay in testing and confirmation was related to the lack of appropriate reagents.

Carcasses have been\nspotted in Jamshedpur, Bokaro, Hazaribagh, and other areas. Media\nreports estimate the number of crow deaths to be between 500 and\n1000.\n\nScientists at National Institute of Virology (NIV) in Pune have found\nthe virus to be H5N1. It is a highly pathogenic virus that can even\nspread to humans.\n\nResidents report that incidents of crow deaths started surfacing in\nthe beginning of September [2011]. However, the event captured media\nattention only towards the end of November [2011]. Several teams,\nincluding that of the Indian Institute of Veterinary Research (IVRI)\nin Bareilly, have collected carcasses and are presently conducting\ntests to ascertain the cause of the deaths. The IVRI results are still\nawaited. NIV, in the meanwhile, has confirmed the presence of the HN51\nvirus in the dead crows.\n\nThe crows tested negative for Japanese encephalitis or West Nile\nvirus.

A Large Billed\nCrow also yielded H5N1 virus in 2009 in Hong Kong. H5N1 has also been\nisolated from both of these wild bird species in Japan and other\nsites in Asia, so the current isolation of virus from these birds is\nfar from unprecedented. It does serve to remind us that we have seen\ndead poultry, wild birds and a person this season in Hong Kong and\ntherefore, Avian influenza still requires intensive surveillance as\nis being done in this instance.\n\nFor pictures of the Oriental Magpie Robin and Large Billed Crows see:\n<http://www.thaibirding.com/features/commonbirdsofthailand.htm>\n\nFor the location of the outbreak, see the map appended to the OIE\nWAHID report or the Healthmap website at\n<http://healthmap.org/r/0nTt> - Mod.PC]\nSee Also\nAvian influenza (66): Hong Kong, HPAI H5, chicken, OIE 20101224.4529\nAvian influenza, human (60): China (Hong Kong) 20101122.4228\nAvian influenza (56): Japan (SM) HPAI H5, OIE 20101202.4330\nAvian influenza (55): Japan (SM) susp, RFI 20101130.4303\nAvian influenza (62): South Korea (GN) H5N1, wild bird, RFI 20101212.4417\nAvian influenza (61): South Korea (CB), H5N1, OIE 20101211.4410\nAvian influenza (60): South Korea (CB) H5N1, wild bird, RFI 20101208.4377\nAvian influenza (49): South Korea, LPAI ,H7N6, ducks, OIE 20101105.4014\nAvian influenza (48): South Korea, LPAI, H7N7, ducks, OIE 20101019.3790\nAvian influenza (35): S Korea (CN) LPNAI H7N7, OIE 20100521.1685\n2009\n----\nAvian influenza, human (124): H9N2 China (HK) 20091224.4328\nAvian influenza, human (115): H9, China (HK ex GD) 20091103.3802\n2008\n----\nAvian influenza (106): Bangladesh, China (Hong Kong) 20081019.3312\nAvian influenza (87): China (Hong Kong), vaccine efficacy 20080711.2121\nAvian influenza (80): China (Hong Kong, Guandong), UK 20080617.1900\nAvian influenza (75): China (Hong Kong) 20080607.1814\nAvian influenza (41): Viet Nam, China (Hong Kong) 20080308.0951\nAvian influenza (34): China (Hong Kong), Laos 20080213.0574\n2007\n----\nAvian influenza (94): Viet Nam, China (Hong Kong) 20070602.1786\nAvian influenza (40): Pakistan, China (Hong Kong), Russia 20070222.0658\nAvian influenza (32): UK (England), China (Hong Kong), Turkey 20070212.0534\n2005\n----\nAvian influenza A (H5N1) virus - China (Hong Kong): 2003 20050718.2068\n2004\n----\nAvian influenza, falcon - China (Hong Kong)(02): OIE 20040127.0314\nAvian influenza, falcon - China (Hong Kong) 20040121.0243\n2003\n----\nAvian influenza - China (Hong Kong): OIE (02) 20030126.0236\nAvian influenza - China (Hong Kong): OIE 20030120.0186\nAvian influenza - China (Hong Kong) (02) 20030107.0054\nAvian influenza - China (Hong Kong) 20030105.0036\n2002\n----\nAvian influenza - China (Hong Kong) (02) 20020206.3492\nAvian Influenza - China (Hong Kong) (03) 20020209.3516\nAvian influenza - China (Hong Kong) (11) 20020530.4362\nAvian influenza - China (Hong Kong) (12) 20021219.6092\nAvian influenza - China (Hong Kong) (13) 20021222.6112\nAvian influenza - China (Hong Kong) (14) 20021228.6144\n2001\n----\nAvian influenza, H5N1 - China (Hong Kong) (03) 20010518.0973\nAvian influenza, H5N1 - China (Hong Kong) (04) 20010519.0978\nAvian influenza, H5N1 - China (Hong Kong) (06) 20010528.1038\n1998\n----\nInfluenza H5N1, avian - China 19980108.0055\nInfluenza H5N1, avian - China (02) 19980116.0130\nInfluenza H5N1, avian - China (03) 19980118.0142\nInfluenza H5N1, avian - China (04) 19980119.0156\n1997\n----\nInfluenza, bird-to-man, first case? 19970820.1747\nInfluenza, bird-to-human - China (Hong Kong) (30) 19971231.2566\n...................pc/ejp/dk\n\n*##########################################################*\n************************************************************\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.

He said that\ngovernment officials would also be seeking guidance from experts at Hong\nKong University, where vaccine studies in poultry have already been under\nway since June [2008].\n\nSo far there is no evidence that the virus has spread to other farms, Chow\nsaid in the statement. Investigators have collected samples from farms to\nconduct polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing, and the results should be\navailable in a day or 2.\n\nIn other developments, poultry trade representatives in Hong Kong said\ntoday that smuggled fertilized eggs from China could be the source of the\nrecent H5N1 outbreak, according to a report today from Agence France-Presse\n(AFP).\n\nThe Hong Kong Poultry Wholesalers Association said smuggling has become\nmore common since the government banned the import of 1-day-old chickens\nfrom China as an H5N1 prevention measure earlier this year [2008], the AFP\nreport said.\n\nThe South China Morning Post reported today that the eggs, ostensibly\nimported as food, contain potentially infected embryos that are less than a\nweek from hatching, according to AFP.

He said that\ngovernment officials would also be seeking guidance from experts at Hong\nKong University, where vaccine studies in poultry have already been under\nway since June [2008].\n\nSo far there is no evidence that the virus has spread to other farms, Chow\nsaid in the statement. Investigators have collected samples from farms to\nconduct polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing, and the results should be\navailable in a day or 2.\n\nIn other developments, poultry trade representatives in Hong Kong said\ntoday that smuggled fertilized eggs from China could be the source of the\nrecent H5N1 outbreak, according to a report today from Agence France-Presse\n(AFP).\n\nThe Hong Kong Poultry Wholesalers Association said smuggling has become\nmore common since the government banned the import of 1-day-old chickens\nfrom China as an H5N1 prevention measure earlier this year [2008], the AFP\nreport said.\n\nThe South China Morning Post reported today that the eggs, ostensibly\nimported as food, contain potentially infected embryos that are less than a\nweek from hatching, according to AFP. However, the owner of the farm that\nwas struck by the H5N1 virus denied having smuggled any fertilized eggs\nfrom China, the report said.\n\nElsewhere, health ministry officials in India said today that the H5N1\nvirus has now spread to 6 of 27 districts in Assam state, according to a\nreport from Indo-Asian News Service (IANS) [see item 2, below]. Parthajyoti\nGogoi, a health ministry official, told IANS that more than 200 000\nchickens and ducks have been culled since the outbreak was 1st detected 2\nweeks ago. The culling activities have affected 200 villages in Kamrup\n(Metro), Kamrup (Rural), Dibrugarh, Nalbari, Barpeta, and Chirang districts.\n\nTeams of doctors and paramedics are taking measures to prevent human H5N1\ninfections, the report said.\n\n[byline: Lisa Schnirring]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[2] India, Assam - spread\nDate: Thu 11 Dec 2008\nSource: ZeeNews [edited]\n<http://www.zeenews.com/states/2008-12-11/490211news.html>\n\n\nBird flu spreads its wings, affects 9 Assam districts\n-----------------------------------------------------\nWith the avian influenza spreading to fresh areas, 9 Assam districts are\nnow bird flu affected and health minister Himanta Biswa Sarma on Thursday\n[11 Dec 2008] warned that it could become a major human disaster. The\naffected districts were Kamrup (Rural), Kamrup (Metro), Barpeta, Nalbari,\nChirang, Baksa, Dibrugarh, Goalpara and Bongaigaon, official sources said.\n\nSale of poultry and eggs, either cooked or raw, has been banned in Guwahati\nand Kamrup (Metro) district which comprises Guwahati and adjoining areas.\n\nCulling of poultry, ducks and other birds has been continuing in the\naffected districts with over 1.5 lakh [150 000] birds killed so far, the\nsources said.\n\n\"People are taking the disease very casually. Chicken and ducks are being\nkept away from culling without realising the seriousness of the disease,\"\nSarma told reporters here. \"We will not be able to handle it, if the\ndisease spreads to humans from the birds. The way the disease is spreading,\nit will be a greater disaster than bomb blasts or floods,\" Sarma said. \"The\nhuman disaster will be immense. The health department is very worried about\nhuman transmission of the disease as it is not 100 percent equipped to\nhandle a large scale outbreak as there are no isolation facilities here,\"\nhe said.\n\nThe disease, starting from Hajo revenue circle in Kamrup (Rural) district\nabout 20 km [12.4 miles] from here [Guwahati] on 2 Dec 2008 and spread to\nGuwahati in Kamrup (Metro) district, Nalbari, Barpeta, Chirang, Baksa,\nBongaigaon and Goalpara districts in Lower Assam spreading to Dibrugarh\ndistrict in Upper Assam.\n\nTaking in view that the bird flu is spreading to new areas in neighbouring\nAssam, Meghalaya banned the entry of poultry and poultry products from\nAssam and Bangladesh.\n\n\"The ban comes into force with immediate effect. However, the ban does not\nimply to the sale of poultry and poultry products produced within the\nstate,\" a Veterinary Department release here said. A senior veterinary\nofficial told media that they were preparing to cull birds and poultry in\nthe bordering areas with Assam as soon as the centre asks to do so.\n\n\"Normally culling operations are done in a radius of 3 km [1.8 miles] of\nthe place of disease outbreak. With the bird flu outbreak in Assam's\nKhanapara, lying along Assam-Meghalaya border, it is likely that culling\nwould be done in the bordering areas of Meghalaya too,\" he said.\n\nDeputy commissioner of Ri Bhoi district that borders Khanapara in Assam's\nKamrup (Rural) district is on a visit to the bordering areas along with a\nteam of veterinary officials to take stock of the situation. The government\nhas set up control rooms in all districts to facilitate information to the\npoultry farms. Veterinary officials have been regularly adopting measures\nto prevent spread of the disease into the state and deputy commissioners of\nall the districts have been alerted, sources said.

One outbreak involved a layer chicken\nflock into which there had been illegal introduction of poultry from Ghana.\nThe other (earlier) outbreak occurred in a small flock wandering in the\nvillage.\n\nThe diagnosis was performed by the national laboratory; the serotype of the\nvirus was, reportedly, \"pending\". ProMED-mail commented: \"It may be assumed\nthat the virus involved is similar to the one in neighbouring Ghana, namely\nH5N1; however, this should be verified and confirmed by a reference\nlaboratory.\" The current information provides the said anticipated piece of\ninformation. - Mod.AS]\nSee Also\nAvian influenza (183): Benin, Poland, OIE, Saudi Arabia 20071206.3934\n\n....................arn/msp/sh\n\n\n*##########################################################*\n************************************************************\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.

Mid-2003: H5N1 virus begins to cause outbreaks in Asia, but these go\nundetected and unreported.\n4. Dec 2003: 2 tigers and 2 leopards, fed on fresh chicken carcasses, die\nunexpectedly at a zoo in Thailand. Subsequent investigation identifies H5N1\nin tissue samples. This is the 1st report of influenza causing disease and\ndeath in big cats.\n5. 19 Dec 2003: Republic of Korea confirms highly pathogenic H5N1 as cause\nof poultry deaths at 3 farms.\n6. 8 Jan 2004: Viet Nam reports H5N1 in poultry.\n7. 12 Jan 2004: Japan reports H5N1 in poultry.\n8. 23 Jan 2004: Thailand reports H5N1 in poultry.\n9. 24 Jan 2004: Cambodia reports H5N1 in poultry.\n10. 27 Jan 2004: Lao PDR reports H5N1 in poultry.\n11. 2 Feb 2004: Indonesia reports H5N1 in poultry.\n12. 4 Feb 2004: China reports H5N1 in poultry.\n13. 20 Feb 2004: Anecdotal evidences suggests H5N1 infection in a single\nhousehold of domestic cats in Thailand.\n14. 18 Mar 2004: Research (1) case studies of 10 patients in Viet Nam point\nto close contact with infected poultry as the probable source of infection\nin most cases, but conclude that, in 2 family clusters, limited\nhuman-to-human transmission within the family cannot be ruled out.\n15. Jun./Jul 2004: China, Indonesia, Thailand and Viet Nam report\nrecurrence of H5N1 in poultry.\n16. 8 Jul 2004: Research (2) identifies the dominant Z genotype in poultry,\nconsiders possible role of wild birds in spread, and concludes that H5N1\nhas found a new ecological niche in poultry, but is not yet fully adapted\nto this host.\n17. 13 Jul 2004: Research (3) shows that H5N1 has become progressively more\nlethal for mammals and can kill wild waterfowl, long considered a\ndisease-free natural reservoir. Japan announces control of the H5N1 poultry\noutbreak and is considered disease-free by OIE.\n18. Jul 2004: Research (4).A case report is published indicating atypical\nhuman H5N1 infection in Thailand (from Mar 04), with fever and diarrhoea\nbut no respiratory symptoms. The report suggests that the clinical spectrum\nof disease may be broader than previously thought.\n19. 7 Aug 2004: Malaysia reports H5N1 in poultry.\n20. 20 Aug 2004: Research (5). Chinese researchers report preliminary\nfindings of H5N1 infection in pigs. No evidence suggests that pig\ninfections are widespread, and the finding appears to have limited\nepidemiological significance.\n21. 2 Sep 2004: Research (6) shows that domestic cats experimentally\ninfected with H5N1 develop severe disease and can spread infection to other\ncats. Prior to this research, domestic cats were considered resistant to\ndisease from all influenza A viruses.\n22. 21 Sep 2004: Republic of Korea announces control of the H5N1 poultry\noutbreak and is considered disease-free by OIE.\n23. 11 Oct 2004: Outbreak begins in zoo tigers in Thailand said to have\nbeen fed chicken carcasses. Altogether, 147 tigers out of a population of\n441 die or are euthanized.\n24. 22 Oct 2004: Highly pathogenic H5N1 is confirmed in 2 eagles illegally\nimported into Europe (Brussels) from Thailand.\n25. 29 Oct 2004: Research (7) confirms that domestic ducks can act as\nsilent reservoirs,\nexcreting large quantities of highly pathogenic virus yet showing few if\nany signs of illness.\n26. December 2004: Poultry outbreaks ongoing in Indonesia, Thailand, and\nVietnam and possibly also in Cambodia and Lao PDR.\n27. 3 Jan 2005: Malaysia (Peninsular) announces control of the H5N1 poultry\noutbreak and is now considered disease-free by OIE.\n28. 27 Jan 2005: Research (8) concludes that a girl in Thailand probably\npassed the virus to at least her mother in September 2004, causing fatal\ndisease. This is the 1st published account of probable secondary human\ntransmission, resulting in severe disease, of any avian influenza virus.\n29. 17 Feb 2005: Research (9) retrospectively identifies at least one fatal\natypical case in\nViet Nam (from February 2004), presenting with diarrhoea and encephalitis,\nbut normal chest X-rays.\n30. 30 April 2005: Wild birds begin dying at Qinghai Lake in central China,\nwhere hundreds of thousands of migratory birds congregate. Altogether, 6345\nbirds from different species die in the coming weeks.\n31. 8 June 2005: China reports poultry outbreak in Xinjiang Autonomous Region.\n32. 6 Jul 2005: Research (10) on viruses isolated from dead birds in\nQinghai Lake suggests the outbreak was caused by a new H5N1 variant that\nmay be more lethal to wild birds and experimentally infected mice.\n33. 14 Jul 2005: Research (11) on viruses isolated from dead birds in\nQinghai Lake demonstrates transmission of the virus among migratory geese\nand suggests that the virus may be carried along winter migratory routes.\n34. 15 Jul 2005: Tests on 3 civets that died in late June in Viet Nam\ndetect H5N1, marking the 1st infection of this species with the virus. The\nendangered Owston's palm civets were raised in captivity; source of\ninfection is unknown.\n35. 23 Jul 2005: Russia reports outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian\ninfluenza, subsequently confirmed as H5N1, in poultry in western Siberia.\nThe outbreak spreads to affect 6 administrative regions in Siberia. Dead\nmigratory birds are reported in the vicinity of outbreaks.\n36. 2 Aug 2005: Kazakhstan reports an outbreak of highly pathogenic avian\ninfluenza, subsequently confirmed as H5N1, in poultry in areas adjacent to\nSiberia. Dead migratory birds are reported in the vicinity of outbreaks.\n37. 10 Aug 2005: China reports outbreak in Tibet Autonomous Region.\n38. 12 Aug 2005: Mongolia reports the death of 89 migratory birds at 2\nlakes. H5N1 is subsequently identified in these birds.\n39. 29 Sep 2005: Research (12) describes the clinical features of H5N1\ninfection in humans and reviews recommendations for the management of cases.\n40. October 2005: Research (13) on the evolution of human and animal\nviruses circulating in Asia in 2005 suggests that several amino acids\nlocated near the receptor-binding site are undergoing change, some of which\nmay affect antigenicity or transmissibility.\n41. 6 Oct 2005: Research (14, 15) describes reconstruction of the lethal\n1918 pandemic virus, concludes that this virus was entirely avian, and\nfinds some similarities with H5N1.\n42. 13 Oct 2005: Highly pathogenic H5N1 is confirmed in poultry in Turkey.\n43. 15 Oct 2005: Highly pathogenic H5N1 is confirmed in poultry in Romania.\n44. 20 Oct 05: Taiwan, China, reports the detection of highly pathogenic\nH5N1 in a cargo of exotic songbirds smuggled from mainland China. Thailand\nreports its 1st new case since 8 Oct 2004.\n45. 23 Oct 2005: Highly pathogenic H5N1 is confirmed in an imported parrot,\nheld in quarantine in the UK, that died 3 days earlier.\n46. 24 Oct 2005: China reports outbreak in Anhui Province. Thailand and\nIndonesia report more cases.\n47. 26 Oct 2005: China reports outbreak in Hunan, making this the 6th\nprovince reporting outbreaks during 2005. Croatia confirms H5N1 in wild birds.\nReferences\n----------\n1 Hien TT et al. Avian influenza A (H5N1) in 10 patients in Vietnam. N Engl\nJ Med 2004; 350:1179-88.\n2 Li KS et al.

Mid-2003: H5N1 virus begins to cause outbreaks in Asia, but these go\nundetected and unreported.\n4. Dec 2003: 2 tigers and 2 leopards, fed on fresh chicken carcasses, die\nunexpectedly at a zoo in Thailand. Subsequent investigation identifies H5N1\nin tissue samples. This is the 1st report of influenza causing disease and\ndeath in big cats.\n5. 19 Dec 2003: Republic of Korea confirms highly pathogenic H5N1 as cause\nof poultry deaths at 3 farms.\n6. 8 Jan 2004: Viet Nam reports H5N1 in poultry.\n7. 12 Jan 2004: Japan reports H5N1 in poultry.\n8. 23 Jan 2004: Thailand reports H5N1 in poultry.\n9. 24 Jan 2004: Cambodia reports H5N1 in poultry.\n10. 27 Jan 2004: Lao PDR reports H5N1 in poultry.\n11. 2 Feb 2004: Indonesia reports H5N1 in poultry.\n12. 4 Feb 2004: China reports H5N1 in poultry.\n13. 20 Feb 2004: Anecdotal evidences suggests H5N1 infection in a single\nhousehold of domestic cats in Thailand.\n14. 18 Mar 2004: Research (1) case studies of 10 patients in Viet Nam point\nto close contact with infected poultry as the probable source of infection\nin most cases, but conclude that, in 2 family clusters, limited\nhuman-to-human transmission within the family cannot be ruled out.\n15. Jun./Jul 2004: China, Indonesia, Thailand and Viet Nam report\nrecurrence of H5N1 in poultry.\n16. 8 Jul 2004: Research (2) identifies the dominant Z genotype in poultry,\nconsiders possible role of wild birds in spread, and concludes that H5N1\nhas found a new ecological niche in poultry, but is not yet fully adapted\nto this host.\n17. 13 Jul 2004: Research (3) shows that H5N1 has become progressively more\nlethal for mammals and can kill wild waterfowl, long considered a\ndisease-free natural reservoir. Japan announces control of the H5N1 poultry\noutbreak and is considered disease-free by OIE.\n18. Jul 2004: Research (4).A case report is published indicating atypical\nhuman H5N1 infection in Thailand (from Mar 04), with fever and diarrhoea\nbut no respiratory symptoms. The report suggests that the clinical spectrum\nof disease may be broader than previously thought.\n19. 7 Aug 2004: Malaysia reports H5N1 in poultry.\n20. 20 Aug 2004: Research (5). Chinese researchers report preliminary\nfindings of H5N1 infection in pigs. No evidence suggests that pig\ninfections are widespread, and the finding appears to have limited\nepidemiological significance.\n21. 2 Sep 2004: Research (6) shows that domestic cats experimentally\ninfected with H5N1 develop severe disease and can spread infection to other\ncats. Prior to this research, domestic cats were considered resistant to\ndisease from all influenza A viruses.\n22. 21 Sep 2004: Republic of Korea announces control of the H5N1 poultry\noutbreak and is considered disease-free by OIE.\n23. 11 Oct 2004: Outbreak begins in zoo tigers in Thailand said to have\nbeen fed chicken carcasses. Altogether, 147 tigers out of a population of\n441 die or are euthanized.\n24. 22 Oct 2004: Highly pathogenic H5N1 is confirmed in 2 eagles illegally\nimported into Europe (Brussels) from Thailand.\n25. 29 Oct 2004: Research (7) confirms that domestic ducks can act as\nsilent reservoirs,\nexcreting large quantities of highly pathogenic virus yet showing few if\nany signs of illness.\n26. December 2004: Poultry outbreaks ongoing in Indonesia, Thailand, and\nVietnam and possibly also in Cambodia and Lao PDR.\n27. 3 Jan 2005: Malaysia (Peninsular) announces control of the H5N1 poultry\noutbreak and is now considered disease-free by OIE.\n28. 27 Jan 2005: Research (8) concludes that a girl in Thailand probably\npassed the virus to at least her mother in September 2004, causing fatal\ndisease. This is the 1st published account of probable secondary human\ntransmission, resulting in severe disease, of any avian influenza virus.\n29. 17 Feb 2005: Research (9) retrospectively identifies at least one fatal\natypical case in\nViet Nam (from February 2004), presenting with diarrhoea and encephalitis,\nbut normal chest X-rays.\n30. 30 April 2005: Wild birds begin dying at Qinghai Lake in central China,\nwhere hundreds of thousands of migratory birds congregate. Altogether, 6345\nbirds from different species die in the coming weeks.\n31. 8 June 2005: China reports poultry outbreak in Xinjiang Autonomous Region.\n32. 6 Jul 2005: Research (10) on viruses isolated from dead birds in\nQinghai Lake suggests the outbreak was caused by a new H5N1 variant that\nmay be more lethal to wild birds and experimentally infected mice.\n33. 14 Jul 2005: Research (11) on viruses isolated from dead birds in\nQinghai Lake demonstrates transmission of the virus among migratory geese\nand suggests that the virus may be carried along winter migratory routes.\n34. 15 Jul 2005: Tests on 3 civets that died in late June in Viet Nam\ndetect H5N1, marking the 1st infection of this species with the virus. The\nendangered Owston's palm civets were raised in captivity; source of\ninfection is unknown.\n35. 23 Jul 2005: Russia reports outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian\ninfluenza, subsequently confirmed as H5N1, in poultry in western Siberia.\nThe outbreak spreads to affect 6 administrative regions in Siberia. Dead\nmigratory birds are reported in the vicinity of outbreaks.\n36. 2 Aug 2005: Kazakhstan reports an outbreak of highly pathogenic avian\ninfluenza, subsequently confirmed as H5N1, in poultry in areas adjacent to\nSiberia. Dead migratory birds are reported in the vicinity of outbreaks.\n37. 10 Aug 2005: China reports outbreak in Tibet Autonomous Region.\n38. 12 Aug 2005: Mongolia reports the death of 89 migratory birds at 2\nlakes. H5N1 is subsequently identified in these birds.\n39. 29 Sep 2005: Research (12) describes the clinical features of H5N1\ninfection in humans and reviews recommendations for the management of cases.\n40. October 2005: Research (13) on the evolution of human and animal\nviruses circulating in Asia in 2005 suggests that several amino acids\nlocated near the receptor-binding site are undergoing change, some of which\nmay affect antigenicity or transmissibility.\n41. 6 Oct 2005: Research (14, 15) describes reconstruction of the lethal\n1918 pandemic virus, concludes that this virus was entirely avian, and\nfinds some similarities with H5N1.\n42. 13 Oct 2005: Highly pathogenic H5N1 is confirmed in poultry in Turkey.\n43. 15 Oct 2005: Highly pathogenic H5N1 is confirmed in poultry in Romania.\n44. 20 Oct 05: Taiwan, China, reports the detection of highly pathogenic\nH5N1 in a cargo of exotic songbirds smuggled from mainland China. Thailand\nreports its 1st new case since 8 Oct 2004.\n45. 23 Oct 2005: Highly pathogenic H5N1 is confirmed in an imported parrot,\nheld in quarantine in the UK, that died 3 days earlier.\n46. 24 Oct 2005: China reports outbreak in Anhui Province. Thailand and\nIndonesia report more cases.\n47. 26 Oct 2005: China reports outbreak in Hunan, making this the 6th\nprovince reporting outbreaks during 2005. Croatia confirms H5N1 in wild birds.\nReferences\n----------\n1 Hien TT et al. Avian influenza A (H5N1) in 10 patients in Vietnam. N Engl\nJ Med 2004; 350:1179-88.\n2 Li KS et al.

Mid-2003: H5N1 virus begins to cause outbreaks in Asia, but these go\nundetected and unreported.\n4. Dec 2003: 2 tigers and 2 leopards, fed on fresh chicken carcasses, die\nunexpectedly at a zoo in Thailand. Subsequent investigation identifies H5N1\nin tissue samples. This is the 1st report of influenza causing disease and\ndeath in big cats.\n5. 19 Dec 2003: Republic of Korea confirms highly pathogenic H5N1 as cause\nof poultry deaths at 3 farms.\n6. 8 Jan 2004: Viet Nam reports H5N1 in poultry.\n7. 12 Jan 2004: Japan reports H5N1 in poultry.\n8. 23 Jan 2004: Thailand reports H5N1 in poultry.\n9. 24 Jan 2004: Cambodia reports H5N1 in poultry.\n10. 27 Jan 2004: Lao PDR reports H5N1 in poultry.\n11. 2 Feb 2004: Indonesia reports H5N1 in poultry.\n12. 4 Feb 2004: China reports H5N1 in poultry.\n13. 20 Feb 2004: Anecdotal evidences suggests H5N1 infection in a single\nhousehold of domestic cats in Thailand.\n14. 18 Mar 2004: Research (1) case studies of 10 patients in Viet Nam point\nto close contact with infected poultry as the probable source of infection\nin most cases, but conclude that, in 2 family clusters, limited\nhuman-to-human transmission within the family cannot be ruled out.\n15. Jun./Jul 2004: China, Indonesia, Thailand and Viet Nam report\nrecurrence of H5N1 in poultry.\n16. 8 Jul 2004: Research (2) identifies the dominant Z genotype in poultry,\nconsiders possible role of wild birds in spread, and concludes that H5N1\nhas found a new ecological niche in poultry, but is not yet fully adapted\nto this host.\n17. 13 Jul 2004: Research (3) shows that H5N1 has become progressively more\nlethal for mammals and can kill wild waterfowl, long considered a\ndisease-free natural reservoir. Japan announces control of the H5N1 poultry\noutbreak and is considered disease-free by OIE.\n18. Jul 2004: Research (4).A case report is published indicating atypical\nhuman H5N1 infection in Thailand (from Mar 04), with fever and diarrhoea\nbut no respiratory symptoms. The report suggests that the clinical spectrum\nof disease may be broader than previously thought.\n19. 7 Aug 2004: Malaysia reports H5N1 in poultry.\n20. 20 Aug 2004: Research (5). Chinese researchers report preliminary\nfindings of H5N1 infection in pigs. No evidence suggests that pig\ninfections are widespread, and the finding appears to have limited\nepidemiological significance.\n21. 2 Sep 2004: Research (6) shows that domestic cats experimentally\ninfected with H5N1 develop severe disease and can spread infection to other\ncats. Prior to this research, domestic cats were considered resistant to\ndisease from all influenza A viruses.\n22. 21 Sep 2004: Republic of Korea announces control of the H5N1 poultry\noutbreak and is considered disease-free by OIE.\n23. 11 Oct 2004: Outbreak begins in zoo tigers in Thailand said to have\nbeen fed chicken carcasses. Altogether, 147 tigers out of a population of\n441 die or are euthanized.\n24. 22 Oct 2004: Highly pathogenic H5N1 is confirmed in 2 eagles illegally\nimported into Europe (Brussels) from Thailand.\n25. 29 Oct 2004: Research (7) confirms that domestic ducks can act as\nsilent reservoirs,\nexcreting large quantities of highly pathogenic virus yet showing few if\nany signs of illness.\n26. December 2004: Poultry outbreaks ongoing in Indonesia, Thailand, and\nVietnam and possibly also in Cambodia and Lao PDR.\n27. 3 Jan 2005: Malaysia (Peninsular) announces control of the H5N1 poultry\noutbreak and is now considered disease-free by OIE.\n28. 27 Jan 2005: Research (8) concludes that a girl in Thailand probably\npassed the virus to at least her mother in September 2004, causing fatal\ndisease. This is the 1st published account of probable secondary human\ntransmission, resulting in severe disease, of any avian influenza virus.\n29. 17 Feb 2005: Research (9) retrospectively identifies at least one fatal\natypical case in\nViet Nam (from February 2004), presenting with diarrhoea and encephalitis,\nbut normal chest X-rays.\n30. 30 April 2005: Wild birds begin dying at Qinghai Lake in central China,\nwhere hundreds of thousands of migratory birds congregate. Altogether, 6345\nbirds from different species die in the coming weeks.\n31. 8 June 2005: China reports poultry outbreak in Xinjiang Autonomous Region.\n32. 6 Jul 2005: Research (10) on viruses isolated from dead birds in\nQinghai Lake suggests the outbreak was caused by a new H5N1 variant that\nmay be more lethal to wild birds and experimentally infected mice.\n33. 14 Jul 2005: Research (11) on viruses isolated from dead birds in\nQinghai Lake demonstrates transmission of the virus among migratory geese\nand suggests that the virus may be carried along winter migratory routes.\n34. 15 Jul 2005: Tests on 3 civets that died in late June in Viet Nam\ndetect H5N1, marking the 1st infection of this species with the virus. The\nendangered Owston's palm civets were raised in captivity; source of\ninfection is unknown.\n35. 23 Jul 2005: Russia reports outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian\ninfluenza, subsequently confirmed as H5N1, in poultry in western Siberia.\nThe outbreak spreads to affect 6 administrative regions in Siberia. Dead\nmigratory birds are reported in the vicinity of outbreaks.\n36. 2 Aug 2005: Kazakhstan reports an outbreak of highly pathogenic avian\ninfluenza, subsequently confirmed as H5N1, in poultry in areas adjacent to\nSiberia. Dead migratory birds are reported in the vicinity of outbreaks.\n37. 10 Aug 2005: China reports outbreak in Tibet Autonomous Region.\n38. 12 Aug 2005: Mongolia reports the death of 89 migratory birds at 2\nlakes. H5N1 is subsequently identified in these birds.\n39. 29 Sep 2005: Research (12) describes the clinical features of H5N1\ninfection in humans and reviews recommendations for the management of cases.\n40. October 2005: Research (13) on the evolution of human and animal\nviruses circulating in Asia in 2005 suggests that several amino acids\nlocated near the receptor-binding site are undergoing change, some of which\nmay affect antigenicity or transmissibility.\n41. 6 Oct 2005: Research (14, 15) describes reconstruction of the lethal\n1918 pandemic virus, concludes that this virus was entirely avian, and\nfinds some similarities with H5N1.\n42. 13 Oct 2005: Highly pathogenic H5N1 is confirmed in poultry in Turkey.\n43. 15 Oct 2005: Highly pathogenic H5N1 is confirmed in poultry in Romania.\n44. 20 Oct 05: Taiwan, China, reports the detection of highly pathogenic\nH5N1 in a cargo of exotic songbirds smuggled from mainland China. Thailand\nreports its 1st new case since 8 Oct 2004.\n45. 23 Oct 2005: Highly pathogenic H5N1 is confirmed in an imported parrot,\nheld in quarantine in the UK, that died 3 days earlier.\n46. 24 Oct 2005: China reports outbreak in Anhui Province. Thailand and\nIndonesia report more cases.\n47. 26 Oct 2005: China reports outbreak in Hunan, making this the 6th\nprovince reporting outbreaks during 2005. Croatia confirms H5N1 in wild birds.\nReferences\n----------\n1 Hien TT et al. Avian influenza A (H5N1) in 10 patients in Vietnam. N Engl\nJ Med 2004; 350:1179-88.\n2 Li KS et al.

This is the 1st report of influenza causing disease and\ndeath in big cats.\n5. 19 Dec 2003: Republic of Korea confirms highly pathogenic H5N1 as cause\nof poultry deaths at 3 farms.\n6. 8 Jan 2004: Viet Nam reports H5N1 in poultry.\n7. 12 Jan 2004: Japan reports H5N1 in poultry.\n8. 23 Jan 2004: Thailand reports H5N1 in poultry.\n9. 24 Jan 2004: Cambodia reports H5N1 in poultry.\n10. 27 Jan 2004: Lao PDR reports H5N1 in poultry.\n11. 2 Feb 2004: Indonesia reports H5N1 in poultry.\n12. 4 Feb 2004: China reports H5N1 in poultry.\n13. 20 Feb 2004: Anecdotal evidences suggests H5N1 infection in a single\nhousehold of domestic cats in Thailand.\n14. 18 Mar 2004: Research (1) case studies of 10 patients in Viet Nam point\nto close contact with infected poultry as the probable source of infection\nin most cases, but conclude that, in 2 family clusters, limited\nhuman-to-human transmission within the family cannot be ruled out.\n15. Jun./Jul 2004: China, Indonesia, Thailand and Viet Nam report\nrecurrence of H5N1 in poultry.\n16. 8 Jul 2004: Research (2) identifies the dominant Z genotype in poultry,\nconsiders possible role of wild birds in spread, and concludes that H5N1\nhas found a new ecological niche in poultry, but is not yet fully adapted\nto this host.\n17. 13 Jul 2004: Research (3) shows that H5N1 has become progressively more\nlethal for mammals and can kill wild waterfowl, long considered a\ndisease-free natural reservoir. Japan announces control of the H5N1 poultry\noutbreak and is considered disease-free by OIE.\n18. Jul 2004: Research (4).A case report is published indicating atypical\nhuman H5N1 infection in Thailand (from Mar 04), with fever and diarrhoea\nbut no respiratory symptoms. The report suggests that the clinical spectrum\nof disease may be broader than previously thought.\n19. 7 Aug 2004: Malaysia reports H5N1 in poultry.\n20. 20 Aug 2004: Research (5). Chinese researchers report preliminary\nfindings of H5N1 infection in pigs. No evidence suggests that pig\ninfections are widespread, and the finding appears to have limited\nepidemiological significance.\n21. 2 Sep 2004: Research (6) shows that domestic cats experimentally\ninfected with H5N1 develop severe disease and can spread infection to other\ncats. Prior to this research, domestic cats were considered resistant to\ndisease from all influenza A viruses.\n22. 21 Sep 2004: Republic of Korea announces control of the H5N1 poultry\noutbreak and is considered disease-free by OIE.\n23. 11 Oct 2004: Outbreak begins in zoo tigers in Thailand said to have\nbeen fed chicken carcasses. Altogether, 147 tigers out of a population of\n441 die or are euthanized.\n24. 22 Oct 2004: Highly pathogenic H5N1 is confirmed in 2 eagles illegally\nimported into Europe (Brussels) from Thailand.\n25. 29 Oct 2004: Research (7) confirms that domestic ducks can act as\nsilent reservoirs,\nexcreting large quantities of highly pathogenic virus yet showing few if\nany signs of illness.\n26. December 2004: Poultry outbreaks ongoing in Indonesia, Thailand, and\nVietnam and possibly also in Cambodia and Lao PDR.\n27. 3 Jan 2005: Malaysia (Peninsular) announces control of the H5N1 poultry\noutbreak and is now considered disease-free by OIE.\n28. 27 Jan 2005: Research (8) concludes that a girl in Thailand probably\npassed the virus to at least her mother in September 2004, causing fatal\ndisease. This is the 1st published account of probable secondary human\ntransmission, resulting in severe disease, of any avian influenza virus.\n29. 17 Feb 2005: Research (9) retrospectively identifies at least one fatal\natypical case in\nViet Nam (from February 2004), presenting with diarrhoea and encephalitis,\nbut normal chest X-rays.\n30. 30 April 2005: Wild birds begin dying at Qinghai Lake in central China,\nwhere hundreds of thousands of migratory birds congregate. Altogether, 6345\nbirds from different species die in the coming weeks.\n31. 8 June 2005: China reports poultry outbreak in Xinjiang Autonomous Region.\n32. 6 Jul 2005: Research (10) on viruses isolated from dead birds in\nQinghai Lake suggests the outbreak was caused by a new H5N1 variant that\nmay be more lethal to wild birds and experimentally infected mice.\n33. 14 Jul 2005: Research (11) on viruses isolated from dead birds in\nQinghai Lake demonstrates transmission of the virus among migratory geese\nand suggests that the virus may be carried along winter migratory routes.\n34. 15 Jul 2005: Tests on 3 civets that died in late June in Viet Nam\ndetect H5N1, marking the 1st infection of this species with the virus. The\nendangered Owston's palm civets were raised in captivity; source of\ninfection is unknown.\n35. 23 Jul 2005: Russia reports outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian\ninfluenza, subsequently confirmed as H5N1, in poultry in western Siberia.\nThe outbreak spreads to affect 6 administrative regions in Siberia. Dead\nmigratory birds are reported in the vicinity of outbreaks.\n36. 2 Aug 2005: Kazakhstan reports an outbreak of highly pathogenic avian\ninfluenza, subsequently confirmed as H5N1, in poultry in areas adjacent to\nSiberia. Dead migratory birds are reported in the vicinity of outbreaks.\n37. 10 Aug 2005: China reports outbreak in Tibet Autonomous Region.\n38. 12 Aug 2005: Mongolia reports the death of 89 migratory birds at 2\nlakes. H5N1 is subsequently identified in these birds.\n39. 29 Sep 2005: Research (12) describes the clinical features of H5N1\ninfection in humans and reviews recommendations for the management of cases.\n40. October 2005: Research (13) on the evolution of human and animal\nviruses circulating in Asia in 2005 suggests that several amino acids\nlocated near the receptor-binding site are undergoing change, some of which\nmay affect antigenicity or transmissibility.\n41. 6 Oct 2005: Research (14, 15) describes reconstruction of the lethal\n1918 pandemic virus, concludes that this virus was entirely avian, and\nfinds some similarities with H5N1.\n42. 13 Oct 2005: Highly pathogenic H5N1 is confirmed in poultry in Turkey.\n43. 15 Oct 2005: Highly pathogenic H5N1 is confirmed in poultry in Romania.\n44. 20 Oct 05: Taiwan, China, reports the detection of highly pathogenic\nH5N1 in a cargo of exotic songbirds smuggled from mainland China.

Mid-2003: H5N1 virus begins to cause outbreaks in Asia, but these go\nundetected and unreported.\n4. Dec 2003: 2 tigers and 2 leopards, fed on fresh chicken carcasses, die\nunexpectedly at a zoo in Thailand. Subsequent investigation identifies H5N1\nin tissue samples. This is the 1st report of influenza causing disease and\ndeath in big cats.\n5. 19 Dec 2003: Republic of Korea confirms highly pathogenic H5N1 as cause\nof poultry deaths at 3 farms.\n6. 8 Jan 2004: Viet Nam reports H5N1 in poultry.\n7. 12 Jan 2004: Japan reports H5N1 in poultry.\n8. 23 Jan 2004: Thailand reports H5N1 in poultry.\n9. 24 Jan 2004: Cambodia reports H5N1 in poultry.\n10. 27 Jan 2004: Lao PDR reports H5N1 in poultry.\n11. 2 Feb 2004: Indonesia reports H5N1 in poultry.\n12. 4 Feb 2004: China reports H5N1 in poultry.\n13. 20 Feb 2004: Anecdotal evidences suggests H5N1 infection in a single\nhousehold of domestic cats in Thailand.\n14. 18 Mar 2004: Research (1) case studies of 10 patients in Viet Nam point\nto close contact with infected poultry as the probable source of infection\nin most cases, but conclude that, in 2 family clusters, limited\nhuman-to-human transmission within the family cannot be ruled out.\n15. Jun./Jul 2004: China, Indonesia, Thailand and Viet Nam report\nrecurrence of H5N1 in poultry.\n16. 8 Jul 2004: Research (2) identifies the dominant Z genotype in poultry,\nconsiders possible role of wild birds in spread, and concludes that H5N1\nhas found a new ecological niche in poultry, but is not yet fully adapted\nto this host.\n17. 13 Jul 2004: Research (3) shows that H5N1 has become progressively more\nlethal for mammals and can kill wild waterfowl, long considered a\ndisease-free natural reservoir. Japan announces control of the H5N1 poultry\noutbreak and is considered disease-free by OIE.\n18. Jul 2004: Research (4).A case report is published indicating atypical\nhuman H5N1 infection in Thailand (from Mar 04), with fever and diarrhoea\nbut no respiratory symptoms. The report suggests that the clinical spectrum\nof disease may be broader than previously thought.\n19. 7 Aug 2004: Malaysia reports H5N1 in poultry.\n20. 20 Aug 2004: Research (5). Chinese researchers report preliminary\nfindings of H5N1 infection in pigs. No evidence suggests that pig\ninfections are widespread, and the finding appears to have limited\nepidemiological significance.\n21. 2 Sep 2004: Research (6) shows that domestic cats experimentally\ninfected with H5N1 develop severe disease and can spread infection to other\ncats. Prior to this research, domestic cats were considered resistant to\ndisease from all influenza A viruses.\n22. 21 Sep 2004: Republic of Korea announces control of the H5N1 poultry\noutbreak and is considered disease-free by OIE.\n23. 11 Oct 2004: Outbreak begins in zoo tigers in Thailand said to have\nbeen fed chicken carcasses. Altogether, 147 tigers out of a population of\n441 die or are euthanized.\n24. 22 Oct 2004: Highly pathogenic H5N1 is confirmed in 2 eagles illegally\nimported into Europe (Brussels) from Thailand.\n25. 29 Oct 2004: Research (7) confirms that domestic ducks can act as\nsilent reservoirs,\nexcreting large quantities of highly pathogenic virus yet showing few if\nany signs of illness.\n26. December 2004: Poultry outbreaks ongoing in Indonesia, Thailand, and\nVietnam and possibly also in Cambodia and Lao PDR.\n27. 3 Jan 2005: Malaysia (Peninsular) announces control of the H5N1 poultry\noutbreak and is now considered disease-free by OIE.\n28. 27 Jan 2005: Research (8) concludes that a girl in Thailand probably\npassed the virus to at least her mother in September 2004, causing fatal\ndisease. This is the 1st published account of probable secondary human\ntransmission, resulting in severe disease, of any avian influenza virus.\n29. 17 Feb 2005: Research (9) retrospectively identifies at least one fatal\natypical case in\nViet Nam (from February 2004), presenting with diarrhoea and encephalitis,\nbut normal chest X-rays.\n30. 30 April 2005: Wild birds begin dying at Qinghai Lake in central China,\nwhere hundreds of thousands of migratory birds congregate. Altogether, 6345\nbirds from different species die in the coming weeks.\n31. 8 June 2005: China reports poultry outbreak in Xinjiang Autonomous Region.\n32. 6 Jul 2005: Research (10) on viruses isolated from dead birds in\nQinghai Lake suggests the outbreak was caused by a new H5N1 variant that\nmay be more lethal to wild birds and experimentally infected mice.\n33. 14 Jul 2005: Research (11) on viruses isolated from dead birds in\nQinghai Lake demonstrates transmission of the virus among migratory geese\nand suggests that the virus may be carried along winter migratory routes.\n34. 15 Jul 2005: Tests on 3 civets that died in late June in Viet Nam\ndetect H5N1, marking the 1st infection of this species with the virus. The\nendangered Owston's palm civets were raised in captivity; source of\ninfection is unknown.\n35. 23 Jul 2005: Russia reports outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian\ninfluenza, subsequently confirmed as H5N1, in poultry in western Siberia.\nThe outbreak spreads to affect 6 administrative regions in Siberia. Dead\nmigratory birds are reported in the vicinity of outbreaks.\n36. 2 Aug 2005: Kazakhstan reports an outbreak of highly pathogenic avian\ninfluenza, subsequently confirmed as H5N1, in poultry in areas adjacent to\nSiberia. Dead migratory birds are reported in the vicinity of outbreaks.\n37. 10 Aug 2005: China reports outbreak in Tibet Autonomous Region.\n38. 12 Aug 2005: Mongolia reports the death of 89 migratory birds at 2\nlakes. H5N1 is subsequently identified in these birds.\n39. 29 Sep 2005: Research (12) describes the clinical features of H5N1\ninfection in humans and reviews recommendations for the management of cases.\n40. October 2005: Research (13) on the evolution of human and animal\nviruses circulating in Asia in 2005 suggests that several amino acids\nlocated near the receptor-binding site are undergoing change, some of which\nmay affect antigenicity or transmissibility.\n41. 6 Oct 2005: Research (14, 15) describes reconstruction of the lethal\n1918 pandemic virus, concludes that this virus was entirely avian, and\nfinds some similarities with H5N1.\n42. 13 Oct 2005: Highly pathogenic H5N1 is confirmed in poultry in Turkey.\n43. 15 Oct 2005: Highly pathogenic H5N1 is confirmed in poultry in Romania.\n44. 20 Oct 05: Taiwan, China, reports the detection of highly pathogenic\nH5N1 in a cargo of exotic songbirds smuggled from mainland China. Thailand\nreports its 1st new case since 8 Oct 2004.\n45. 23 Oct 2005: Highly pathogenic H5N1 is confirmed in an imported parrot,\nheld in quarantine in the UK, that died 3 days earlier.\n46. 24 Oct 2005: China reports outbreak in Anhui Province. Thailand and\nIndonesia report more cases.\n47. 26 Oct 2005: China reports outbreak in Hunan, making this the 6th\nprovince reporting outbreaks during 2005. Croatia confirms H5N1 in wild birds.\nReferences\n----------\n1 Hien TT et al. Avian influenza A (H5N1) in 10 patients in Vietnam. N Engl\nJ Med 2004; 350:1179-88.\n2 Li KS et al.

Mid-2003: H5N1 virus begins to cause outbreaks in Asia, but these go\nundetected and unreported.\n4. Dec 2003: 2 tigers and 2 leopards, fed on fresh chicken carcasses, die\nunexpectedly at a zoo in Thailand. Subsequent investigation identifies H5N1\nin tissue samples. This is the 1st report of influenza causing disease and\ndeath in big cats.\n5. 19 Dec 2003: Republic of Korea confirms highly pathogenic H5N1 as cause\nof poultry deaths at 3 farms.\n6. 8 Jan 2004: Viet Nam reports H5N1 in poultry.\n7. 12 Jan 2004: Japan reports H5N1 in poultry.\n8. 23 Jan 2004: Thailand reports H5N1 in poultry.\n9. 24 Jan 2004: Cambodia reports H5N1 in poultry.\n10. 27 Jan 2004: Lao PDR reports H5N1 in poultry.\n11. 2 Feb 2004: Indonesia reports H5N1 in poultry.\n12. 4 Feb 2004: China reports H5N1 in poultry.\n13. 20 Feb 2004: Anecdotal evidences suggests H5N1 infection in a single\nhousehold of domestic cats in Thailand.\n14. 18 Mar 2004: Research (1) case studies of 10 patients in Viet Nam point\nto close contact with infected poultry as the probable source of infection\nin most cases, but conclude that, in 2 family clusters, limited\nhuman-to-human transmission within the family cannot be ruled out.\n15. Jun./Jul 2004: China, Indonesia, Thailand and Viet Nam report\nrecurrence of H5N1 in poultry.\n16. 8 Jul 2004: Research (2) identifies the dominant Z genotype in poultry,\nconsiders possible role of wild birds in spread, and concludes that H5N1\nhas found a new ecological niche in poultry, but is not yet fully adapted\nto this host.\n17. 13 Jul 2004: Research (3) shows that H5N1 has become progressively more\nlethal for mammals and can kill wild waterfowl, long considered a\ndisease-free natural reservoir. Japan announces control of the H5N1 poultry\noutbreak and is considered disease-free by OIE.\n18. Jul 2004: Research (4).A case report is published indicating atypical\nhuman H5N1 infection in Thailand (from Mar 04), with fever and diarrhoea\nbut no respiratory symptoms. The report suggests that the clinical spectrum\nof disease may be broader than previously thought.\n19. 7 Aug 2004: Malaysia reports H5N1 in poultry.\n20. 20 Aug 2004: Research (5). Chinese researchers report preliminary\nfindings of H5N1 infection in pigs. No evidence suggests that pig\ninfections are widespread, and the finding appears to have limited\nepidemiological significance.\n21. 2 Sep 2004: Research (6) shows that domestic cats experimentally\ninfected with H5N1 develop severe disease and can spread infection to other\ncats. Prior to this research, domestic cats were considered resistant to\ndisease from all influenza A viruses.\n22. 21 Sep 2004: Republic of Korea announces control of the H5N1 poultry\noutbreak and is considered disease-free by OIE.\n23. 11 Oct 2004: Outbreak begins in zoo tigers in Thailand said to have\nbeen fed chicken carcasses. Altogether, 147 tigers out of a population of\n441 die or are euthanized.\n24. 22 Oct 2004: Highly pathogenic H5N1 is confirmed in 2 eagles illegally\nimported into Europe (Brussels) from Thailand.\n25. 29 Oct 2004: Research (7) confirms that domestic ducks can act as\nsilent reservoirs,\nexcreting large quantities of highly pathogenic virus yet showing few if\nany signs of illness.\n26. December 2004: Poultry outbreaks ongoing in Indonesia, Thailand, and\nVietnam and possibly also in Cambodia and Lao PDR.\n27. 3 Jan 2005: Malaysia (Peninsular) announces control of the H5N1 poultry\noutbreak and is now considered disease-free by OIE.\n28. 27 Jan 2005: Research (8) concludes that a girl in Thailand probably\npassed the virus to at least her mother in September 2004, causing fatal\ndisease. This is the 1st published account of probable secondary human\ntransmission, resulting in severe disease, of any avian influenza virus.\n29. 17 Feb 2005: Research (9) retrospectively identifies at least one fatal\natypical case in\nViet Nam (from February 2004), presenting with diarrhoea and encephalitis,\nbut normal chest X-rays.\n30. 30 April 2005: Wild birds begin dying at Qinghai Lake in central China,\nwhere hundreds of thousands of migratory birds congregate. Altogether, 6345\nbirds from different species die in the coming weeks.\n31. 8 June 2005: China reports poultry outbreak in Xinjiang Autonomous Region.\n32. 6 Jul 2005: Research (10) on viruses isolated from dead birds in\nQinghai Lake suggests the outbreak was caused by a new H5N1 variant that\nmay be more lethal to wild birds and experimentally infected mice.\n33. 14 Jul 2005: Research (11) on viruses isolated from dead birds in\nQinghai Lake demonstrates transmission of the virus among migratory geese\nand suggests that the virus may be carried along winter migratory routes.\n34. 15 Jul 2005: Tests on 3 civets that died in late June in Viet Nam\ndetect H5N1, marking the 1st infection of this species with the virus. The\nendangered Owston's palm civets were raised in captivity; source of\ninfection is unknown.\n35. 23 Jul 2005: Russia reports outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian\ninfluenza, subsequently confirmed as H5N1, in poultry in western Siberia.\nThe outbreak spreads to affect 6 administrative regions in Siberia. Dead\nmigratory birds are reported in the vicinity of outbreaks.\n36. 2 Aug 2005: Kazakhstan reports an outbreak of highly pathogenic avian\ninfluenza, subsequently confirmed as H5N1, in poultry in areas adjacent to\nSiberia. Dead migratory birds are reported in the vicinity of outbreaks.\n37. 10 Aug 2005: China reports outbreak in Tibet Autonomous Region.\n38. 12 Aug 2005: Mongolia reports the death of 89 migratory birds at 2\nlakes. H5N1 is subsequently identified in these birds.\n39. 29 Sep 2005: Research (12) describes the clinical features of H5N1\ninfection in humans and reviews recommendations for the management of cases.\n40. October 2005: Research (13) on the evolution of human and animal\nviruses circulating in Asia in 2005 suggests that several amino acids\nlocated near the receptor-binding site are undergoing change, some of which\nmay affect antigenicity or transmissibility.\n41. 6 Oct 2005: Research (14, 15) describes reconstruction of the lethal\n1918 pandemic virus, concludes that this virus was entirely avian, and\nfinds some similarities with H5N1.\n42. 13 Oct 2005: Highly pathogenic H5N1 is confirmed in poultry in Turkey.\n43. 15 Oct 2005: Highly pathogenic H5N1 is confirmed in poultry in Romania.\n44. 20 Oct 05: Taiwan, China, reports the detection of highly pathogenic\nH5N1 in a cargo of exotic songbirds smuggled from mainland China. Thailand\nreports its 1st new case since 8 Oct 2004.\n45. 23 Oct 2005: Highly pathogenic H5N1 is confirmed in an imported parrot,\nheld in quarantine in the UK, that died 3 days earlier.\n46. 24 Oct 2005: China reports outbreak in Anhui Province. Thailand and\nIndonesia report more cases.\n47. 26 Oct 2005: China reports outbreak in Hunan, making this the 6th\nprovince reporting outbreaks during 2005. Croatia confirms H5N1 in wild birds.\nReferences\n----------\n1 Hien TT et al. Avian influenza A (H5N1) in 10 patients in Vietnam. N Engl\nJ Med 2004; 350:1179-88.\n2 Li KS et al.

Jun./Jul 2004: China, Indonesia, Thailand and Viet Nam report\nrecurrence of H5N1 in poultry.\n16. 8 Jul 2004: Research (2) identifies the dominant Z genotype in poultry,\nconsiders possible role of wild birds in spread, and concludes that H5N1\nhas found a new ecological niche in poultry, but is not yet fully adapted\nto this host.\n17. 13 Jul 2004: Research (3) shows that H5N1 has become progressively more\nlethal for mammals and can kill wild waterfowl, long considered a\ndisease-free natural reservoir. Japan announces control of the H5N1 poultry\noutbreak and is considered disease-free by OIE.\n18. Jul 2004: Research (4).A case report is published indicating atypical\nhuman H5N1 infection in Thailand (from Mar 04), with fever and diarrhoea\nbut no respiratory symptoms. The report suggests that the clinical spectrum\nof disease may be broader than previously thought.\n19. 7 Aug 2004: Malaysia reports H5N1 in poultry.\n20. 20 Aug 2004: Research (5). Chinese researchers report preliminary\nfindings of H5N1 infection in pigs. No evidence suggests that pig\ninfections are widespread, and the finding appears to have limited\nepidemiological significance.\n21. 2 Sep 2004: Research (6) shows that domestic cats experimentally\ninfected with H5N1 develop severe disease and can spread infection to other\ncats. Prior to this research, domestic cats were considered resistant to\ndisease from all influenza A viruses.\n22. 21 Sep 2004: Republic of Korea announces control of the H5N1 poultry\noutbreak and is considered disease-free by OIE.\n23. 11 Oct 2004: Outbreak begins in zoo tigers in Thailand said to have\nbeen fed chicken carcasses. Altogether, 147 tigers out of a population of\n441 die or are euthanized.\n24. 22 Oct 2004: Highly pathogenic H5N1 is confirmed in 2 eagles illegally\nimported into Europe (Brussels) from Thailand.\n25. 29 Oct 2004: Research (7) confirms that domestic ducks can act as\nsilent reservoirs,\nexcreting large quantities of highly pathogenic virus yet showing few if\nany signs of illness.\n26. December 2004: Poultry outbreaks ongoing in Indonesia, Thailand, and\nVietnam and possibly also in Cambodia and Lao PDR.\n27. 3 Jan 2005: Malaysia (Peninsular) announces control of the H5N1 poultry\noutbreak and is now considered disease-free by OIE.\n28. 27 Jan 2005: Research (8) concludes that a girl in Thailand probably\npassed the virus to at least her mother in September 2004, causing fatal\ndisease. This is the 1st published account of probable secondary human\ntransmission, resulting in severe disease, of any avian influenza virus.\n29. 17 Feb 2005: Research (9) retrospectively identifies at least one fatal\natypical case in\nViet Nam (from February 2004), presenting with diarrhoea and encephalitis,\nbut normal chest X-rays.\n30. 30 April 2005: Wild birds begin dying at Qinghai Lake in central China,\nwhere hundreds of thousands of migratory birds congregate. Altogether, 6345\nbirds from different species die in the coming weeks.\n31. 8 June 2005: China reports poultry outbreak in Xinjiang Autonomous Region.\n32. 6 Jul 2005: Research (10) on viruses isolated from dead birds in\nQinghai Lake suggests the outbreak was caused by a new H5N1 variant that\nmay be more lethal to wild birds and experimentally infected mice.\n33. 14 Jul 2005: Research (11) on viruses isolated from dead birds in\nQinghai Lake demonstrates transmission of the virus among migratory geese\nand suggests that the virus may be carried along winter migratory routes.\n34. 15 Jul 2005: Tests on 3 civets that died in late June in Viet Nam\ndetect H5N1, marking the 1st infection of this species with the virus. The\nendangered Owston's palm civets were raised in captivity; source of\ninfection is unknown.\n35. 23 Jul 2005: Russia reports outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian\ninfluenza, subsequently confirmed as H5N1, in poultry in western Siberia.\nThe outbreak spreads to affect 6 administrative regions in Siberia. Dead\nmigratory birds are reported in the vicinity of outbreaks.\n36. 2 Aug 2005: Kazakhstan reports an outbreak of highly pathogenic avian\ninfluenza, subsequently confirmed as H5N1, in poultry in areas adjacent to\nSiberia. Dead migratory birds are reported in the vicinity of outbreaks.\n37. 10 Aug 2005: China reports outbreak in Tibet Autonomous Region.\n38. 12 Aug 2005: Mongolia reports the death of 89 migratory birds at 2\nlakes. H5N1 is subsequently identified in these birds.\n39. 29 Sep 2005: Research (12) describes the clinical features of H5N1\ninfection in humans and reviews recommendations for the management of cases.\n40. October 2005: Research (13) on the evolution of human and animal\nviruses circulating in Asia in 2005 suggests that several amino acids\nlocated near the receptor-binding site are undergoing change, some of which\nmay affect antigenicity or transmissibility.\n41. 6 Oct 2005: Research (14, 15) describes reconstruction of the lethal\n1918 pandemic virus, concludes that this virus was entirely avian, and\nfinds some similarities with H5N1.\n42. 13 Oct 2005: Highly pathogenic H5N1 is confirmed in poultry in Turkey.\n43. 15 Oct 2005: Highly pathogenic H5N1 is confirmed in poultry in Romania.\n44. 20 Oct 05: Taiwan, China, reports the detection of highly pathogenic\nH5N1 in a cargo of exotic songbirds smuggled from mainland China.

It said samples had been sent for tests for\npossible bird flu, but did not say where exactly the birds\nhad been moved from. [Updated information on this event\nwould be appreciated. - Mod.AS]. Turkish officials also said\nthe incubation period for the avian flu found on a farm in\nthe north west was over, and the danger to humans had\npassed.\nThe EU Commission in Brussels confirmed that the H5N1 strain\nfound in Romanian ducks was exactly the same as that\ndetected in Turkish birds. \"The link has now been\nconfirmed,\" Health and Consumer Protection Commissioner\nMarkos Kyprianou said in a statement. Kyprianou said the\nEuropean Union had already banned poultry and live bird\nimports from Romania, so no further measures were needed. EU\nveterinary experts will meet on Thu 20 Oct 2005 to review\nthe situation, he added.\nIn Romania, pharmacies ran out of regular flu vaccine and\nlocal media reported that worried citizens had bought up to\n2 million doses of the vaccine in the past few days.\nFlu vaccine protects people only against the latest strain\nof regular flu. Only if H5N1 mutates into a form that passes\neasily between humans will pharmaceutical firms be able to\ndevelop a vaccine specifically against that strain.\nIn Romania's south east Danube delta area, 6 counties were\ncordoned off. Television footage showed masked and gloved\nveterinarians gassing poultry and disinfecting farms in the\ndelta village of Ceamurlia de Jos, part of a cull of more\nthan 60 000 birds aimed at stopping the virus from\nspreading. The Danube delta contains Europe's largest\nwetlands and is a major resting place for migratory wild\nbirds -- the carriers of the virus -- coming from Russia,\nScandinavia, Poland and Germany and heading for North Africa\nfor winter.\nPoland, responding to European Commission calls, said all\npoultry must be kept indoors from Monday [17 Oct 2005] to\nkeep it away from migratory wild birds. \"The situation means\nquite a large danger for poultry in Poland, so I decided to\nimpose some restrictions ... including a ban on keeping\npoultry in open spaces,\" Farm Minister Jerzy Pilarczyk told\na news conference.\n[byline: Martin Dokoupil]\n******\n[2]\nDate: Sun 16 Oct 2005\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: Haaretz, 16 Oct 2005 [edited]\n<http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/pages/ShArtVty.jhtml?sw=avian&itemNo=635329>\n\nAgriculture ministry buys 8 million doses of avian flu\nvaccine\n-----------------------------------------------\nThe Agriculture Ministry has purchased 8 million doses of\nvaccine for the 2 violent strains of avian flu, H-7 and H-5,\nit was reported on Sunday [16 Oct 2005]. The ministry has\nalso purchased a protective kit prepared for ministry\nemployees who could have contact with infected birds. The\nvaccine and the kit come from the Netherlands, Israel Radio\nreported.\nHealth Minister Dan Naveh told Haaretz on Sunday [16 Oct\n2005] that the government will discuss in its next meeting a\nrequest by his ministry to allocate ILS 150 million [USD 181\nmillion] for medication that combats the avian flu.\nSpeaking at a meeting of Health Ministry officials, Naveh\nsaid he will tell the government how the ministry is\npreparing for a possible outbreak of the pandemic in Israel.\nThe preparations were being made in the wake of fears that\nthe strain of bird flu currently circulating in the world\nhas mutated into a strain that is dangerous for humans, in\nwhich case it could be immune to known drugs.\nThe Agriculture Ministry has also opened a 24-hour,\n7-day-a-week hotline to report birds suspected of being\ninfected with avian flu. The public is asked to call\n03-968-1609 to report the location of straying birds that\nappear to be sick or bird carcasses.\nThe ministry announced it has been testing migratory birds\nand poultry in collaboration with the Israel Nature and\nParks Authority to locate infections and examine bird\ncarcasses. So far, all tests have been negative.\nThe director general of the Health Ministry, Professor Avi\nYisraeli, told Haaretz over the weekend that the main thing\nIsrael has to do now is to have Agriculture Ministry\nofficials watch out for possible cases of avian flu among\nmigratory birds and domesticated birds in agricultural\ncommunities.\nYisraeli also recommended that residents of Israel go to\ntheir health clinics to get the regular flu shot\nadministered around this time every year to babies, the\nelderly and health care workers.\nOfficials believe that a dose of the regular seasonal flu\nvaccine may reduce the incidence of sickness in case of an\navian flu epidemic, and that the ordinary flu shot could\nlessen the chance of contracting both viruses together,\nordinary influenza and avian flu.\nFears for an outbreak of the pandemic in Israel emerged\nafter the World Organization for Animal Health released\nfindings indicating flocks of migratory birds nesting in\nChina were responsible for the outbreak outside South East\nAsia. Israel faces this risk since it is located on one of\nthe major seasonal migratory routes of birds.\n[byline: Ran Reznik, Amiram Cohen and Assaf Oni]\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[The concern of the Israeli authorities is understandable in\nview of Israel's geographical situation as a crossway of\nmigratory birds on their route from Asia and Europe to\nAfrica.

It said samples had been sent for tests for\npossible bird flu, but did not say where exactly the birds\nhad been moved from. [Updated information on this event\nwould be appreciated. - Mod.AS]. Turkish officials also said\nthe incubation period for the avian flu found on a farm in\nthe north west was over, and the danger to humans had\npassed.\nThe EU Commission in Brussels confirmed that the H5N1 strain\nfound in Romanian ducks was exactly the same as that\ndetected in Turkish birds. \"The link has now been\nconfirmed,\" Health and Consumer Protection Commissioner\nMarkos Kyprianou said in a statement. Kyprianou said the\nEuropean Union had already banned poultry and live bird\nimports from Romania, so no further measures were needed.

Russia is battling to contain a bird flu\noutbreak, which top health officials say has killed more than 11 000 birds\ncountrywide and could spread westwards to Europe, the Middle East and Africa.\nThe outbreak was discovered in mid-July 2005 in Novosibirsk and has spread\nthrough Tyumen, Omsk, Kurgan, Altai and now Chelyabinsk, which is about\n1000 km (600 miles) from Novosibirsk.\nSenior agricultural officials believe the flu was brought by migrating\nbirds from Asia, where more than 50 people have died from the deadly H5N1\nstrain since 2003.\nOfficials fear that the virus could spread to Europe and Africa as tens of\nmillions of birds continue their migration to warmer climates from next\nmonth ahead of Russia's harsh winter.\nChelyabinsk lies in the Ural mountains, the geographic divide between Asia\nand Europe. Russia's top state epidemiologist, Gennady Onishchenko, said\nmigratory birds move on to warmer areas in southern Russia, Africa and\nEurope in the autumn after nesting in Siberia.\nBut the diversity of Siberia's bird species makes plotting the flight paths\nof the birds difficult, specialists in Moscow said.\n\"There are about 800 different species of birds in Russia and so there are\nmany different migration flows which criss-cross Russian territory,\" said\nDr. Pavel Tomkovich, a senior ornithologist at Moscow's Zoological Museum.\nHe said water fowl will leave to winter in warmer climates, flying through\nRussia's southern regions, northern Kazakhstan, the Caspian and Black seas\ntowards the Mediterranean and north Africa. That would/could take infected\nbirds through Russia's agricultural heartland in the south.\nHealth officials were meeting in Moscow on Tuesday to discuss the\nsituation, the state's consumer watchdog said.\nIn parts of Chelyabinsk, barriers were placed on roads and local officials\nimposed a ban on the sale of all poultry products, the Itar-Tass news\nagency reported. Farmers are being compensated for birds which were being\ndestroyed, the agency said.\nBird flu comes in different stains, such as H5 and H7, which have 9\ndifferent subtypes. The H5N1 subtype is highly pathogenic and can be passed\nfrom birds to humans, though there have been no cases of human-to-human\ntransmission.\n[Byline: Guy Faulconbridge; additional reporting by Maria Kiselyova]\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n******\n[2]\nDate: Tue, 16 Aug 2005\nFrom: Mary Marshall <tropical.forestry@btinternet.com>\nSource: CIDRAP News, 15 Aug 2005 [edited]\n<http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/cidrap/content/influenza/avianflu/news/aug1505avian.html>\n\nAvian flu spreads westward in Russia\n-------------------------------------\nAvian influenza has cropped up in chickens near Russia's Ural Mountains,\npossibly signaling a continued westward march of the deadly H5N1 virus,\nnews services in Russia reported today.\nThe Chelyabinsk region along the southern end of the Urals is the 6th area\nin Russia to have been hit by avian flu outbreaks recently, according to\nAgence France-Presse (AFP) and Reuters. The Urals separate Siberia from\nEuropean Russia.\nA regional official said 60 chickens in the village of Oktyabrskoye died\nover the weekend, according to an online report by Mosnews.com. The report\nsaid testing had detected an H5N1 virus in the dead birds. However, the AFP\nand Reuters reports said it was not yet known if the virus was H5N1.\nOther parts of southwestern Siberia that have reported recent outbreaks of\navian flu include Novosibirsk, Altai, Omsk, Tyumen, and Kurgan, all to the\neast of Chelyabinsk, according to AFP. But the H5N1 strain has been\nidentified only in the Novosibirsk, Altai, and Omsk outbreaks, the report said.\nThe Siberian outbreaks have killed 10 896 wild and domestic birds,\naccording to an RIA Novosti news agency report quoted by AFP. Hundreds of\nthousands of birds have been culled since the 1st in the series of Russian\noutbreaks was reported in Novosibirsk on 21 Jul 2005, according to\nMosnews.com. No human cases have been reported.\nRussia's top government epidemiologist, Gennady Onischenko, warned that\nmigrating birds could spread avian flu to Russia's major agricultural\nregion and on to the Middle East and Mediterranean Sea this fall.\n\"An analysis of bird migration routes has shown that the contagious A\n(H5N1) virus may spread from western Siberia to the Caspian and Black Sea\nareas this fall,\" said Onischenko, as quoted by an RIA Novosti report\ntoday. \"Some birds nesting in the affected regions (the Novosibirsk and\nAltai territory) migrate to the above-mentioned areas for winter or stop\nthere on their way to Africa or Europe.\"\nHe added that bird migration routes run through Azerbaijan, Iran, Iraq,\nGeorgia, Ukraine, and Mediterranean countries, raising a risk of outbreaks\nthere as well, according to the story. Onischenko made the statements in a\nletter to regional directors of the Federal Service for the Oversight of\nConsumer Protection and Welfare.\nRussia's Agriculture Ministry said all sick and infected birds in\nChelyabinsk were being destroyed, and Russian media reported that roads\nleading to the affected village were cordoned off in an effort to contain\nthe outbreak, according to Reuters.\nA Russian agricultural official said the Chelyabinsk outbreak is near a\nlake that borders the Kurgan region and Kazakhstan, where other avian flu\noutbreaks have been reported recently, according to the Mosnews.com report.\nMeanwhile, a Russian journalist named Maria Pashkova, who was hospitalized\nafter visiting an area affected by avian flu, has been tested for the\nillness, according to an RIA Novosti report today. Results of the test are\nexpected later this week.\nMosnews.com reported that Pashkova had already recovered from her illness.\n4 other Russians were hospitalized with suspected avian flu recently, but\nall 4 tested negative, the RIA Novosti story said.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[In the absence of an official OIE update since 5 Aug 2005, it is not clear\nwhat measures are currently being undertaken by the Russian authorities to\ncontrol the disease within the 5 regions (oblasts) situated west of the 1st\naffected region, Novosibirsk, and to prevent its further spread.

Currently, at risk people\nin the UK -- the elderly and ill -- need annual flu jabs, and there\nis no jab available yet guaranteed to beat avian influenza.\nBiotechnology firm Acambis, in Cambridge, UK says it hopes its jab\nwill target numerous mutations that presently allow flu to evade\nattack. However, the work is very early and is years off being tested\nin humans.\nEach year, winter flu kills around 4000 people in the UK. Globally,\nbetween 500 000 and one million people die each year from influenza.\nIf the avian influenza virus currently circulating in Asia were to\nmutate and spread from person to person, it could kill as many people\nas the 1918 Spanish flu, which claimed between 20 and 40 million\nlives, experts have warned.\nCurrent influenza vaccines work by giving immunity to 2 proteins\ncalled hemagglutinin and neuraminidase, which are found on the\nsurface of flu viruses. However, these proteins keep mutating, which\nmeans doctors have to keep making new vaccines to keep up. Scientists\nat Acambis' laboratory in the US, together with Belgian researchers\nat Flanders Interuniversity Institute for Biotechnology, are focusing\ntheir efforts on a different protein, called M2, which does not\nmutate, as well as other technology that they cannot disclose yet for\ncommercial reasons. If successful, a single shot of the vaccine could\nprotect a person against all strains of influenza virus, they\nbelieve. Dr. Thomas Monath, chief scientific officer at Acambis,\nsaid: \"We aim to avoid the need for annual re-engineering and\nmanufacture of the new product, something that is not yet possible\nwith existing vaccines. The need to develop a new vaccine each time a\ndifferent influenza strain emerges often results in long delays\nbefore a population can be protected. The technology also has special\nimportance as a potential means of protecting human populations\nagainst pandemic influenza strains. So far, the vaccine has only been\ntested in animals. The scientists said it would take several years\nbefore large-scale human trials could be done.\nProfessor Maria Zambon, a flu expert at the Health Protection Agency,\nsaid: \"We welcome advances in the process of developing novel flu\nvaccines and vaccination techniques. However, this vaccine is still\nvery early in a vaccine development pipeline, and it will take some\ntime to establish how this vaccine performs in human trials and\nwhether it can proceed to being licensed for use in the UK.\"\nProfessor Karl Nicholson, professor of infectious diseases at\nLeicester University, said: \"It would be enormously helpful to\nmankind to have just the one vaccine, but, sadly, I think it is a\nlong way off.\" He said it might be 10 years before any such product\ncould be ready for widespread use in humans.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n******\n[2]\nDate: Sun 7 Aug 2005\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: The New York Times, Sun 7 Aug 2005 [edited]\n<http://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/07/health/07vaccine.html?th&emc=th>\n\nAvian Influenza Vaccine Called Effective in Human Testing\n-----------------------------------------------\nGovernment scientists say they have successfully tested in people a\nvaccine that they believe can protect against the strain of avian\ninfluenza that is spreading in birds through Asia and Russia. Health\nofficials have been racing to develop a vaccine because they worry\nthat, if that strain mutated and combined with a human influenza\nvirus to create a new virus, it could spread rapidly through the\nworld. (The vaccine cannot lead to such a situation, because it is\nmade from killed virus.) Tens of millions of birds have died from\ninfection with the virus and culling to prevent the spread of the\nvirus. About 100 people have been infected, and about 50 [112 and 57\nas of 5 Aug 2005 - Mod.CP] have died from this strain of the avian\ninfluenza virus, called A(H5N1). So far, there has been no sustained\nhuman-to-human transmission, but that is what health officials fear,\nbecause it could cause a pandemic. And that fear has driven the\nintense research to develop a vaccine.\nThe Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious\nDiseases, Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, said that while the vaccine that has\nundergone preliminary tests could be used on an emergency basis if a\npandemic developed, it would still be several months before that\nvaccine is tested further and, if licensed, offered to the public. He\ncautioned: \"We don't have all the vaccine we need to meet the\npossible demand. The critical issue now is, can we make enough\nvaccine, given the well-known inability of the vaccine industry to\nmake enough vaccine.\"\nAn earlier human vaccine against A(H5N1) avian influenza virus was\nprepared after it 1st appeared in the world, in Hong Kong in 1997.\nThat vaccine was never fully developed or used, and the strain has\nmutated since then. In interviews over recent days, Dr. Fauci has\nsaid that tests so far have shown that the new vaccine produced a\nstrong immune response among the small group of healthy adults under\nage 65 who volunteered to receive it, although the doses needed were\nhigher than in the standard influenza vaccine offered each year. The\nvaccine, developed with genetic engineering techniques, is intended\nto protect against infection, not to treat those who are sick.\nFurther tests are expected to be conducted among 2 groups -- people\n65 and older, and children -- over the next several months. Dr. Fauci\nexpressed confidence that they would confirm the success of the 1st\ntests and answer remaining scientific questions.\nBecause the vaccine is made in chicken eggs, \"a potential major\nstumbling block\" to successful mass production is the number of eggs\nfarmers can supply to vaccine manufacturers, Dr. Fauci said. If\nmanufacturers can overcome such hurdles, the new vaccine could go far\nin averting a possible pandemic of human influenza, Dr. Fauci said.\nOnly a small number of human cases of A(H5N1) influenza have been\nfound. Although a few cases may have been transmitted from person to\nperson in Asia, the A(H5N1) strain has not garnered enough strength\nto spread widely among humans anywhere. As of Friday [5 Aug 2005]\nnight, according to the World Health Organization in Geneva, the\navian strain has killed 57 of the 112 people it has been known to\ninfect in 4 countries. They are Cambodia (4 cases), Indonesia (one\ncase), Thailand (17 cases), and Viet Nam (90 cases).\nThe additional tests are needed in part to determine the optimal dose\nof vaccine; how many shots people will need for protection; and\nwhether adding another ingredient called an adjuvant to the vaccine\ncould raise the potency of lower doses, stretching the number of\npeople that could be protected. Even when these tests are completed,\nmore time will be needed before the Food and Drug Administration can\nlicense the human vaccine and before policy makers determine the when\nand how it should be administered.\nGovernment researchers and others developed the vaccine, which is\nproduced by Sanofi-Pasteur, a French vaccine company that is now part\nof Aventis. The government could decide to release the product under\nemergency conditions if an A(H5N1) influenza pandemic struck before\nthe testing process was completed. Although cautioning that the\nvaccine has not been fully tested, Dr. Fauci said that the initial\ntest findings have given the federal government enough confidence to\nstart the process of adding millions more doses of the vaccine to the\n2 million it has bought. The present supply is stored in bulk form,\nand \"we cannot put it in vials until we find out what the right dose\nis,\" Dr. Fauci said. The manufacturer needs to know the dose and\nregimen to determine how much more vaccine it can produce and make\navailable to the United States and other customers.\nScientists had to test the human avian influenza vaccine on\nvolunteers, because the A(H5N1) strain differs in significant ways\nfrom the conventional strains that cause human influenza. Also, the\ninfluenza shots that are offered each year are derived from the human\nstrains that are circulating most widely at the time experts choose\nthe components of the next vaccine. Human influenza viruses mutate\nenough each year to force changes in the standard vaccines. Such\nvaccines produce a broader and stronger immunity, because recipients\nbuild up an immunity to influenza from repeated immunizations and\nexposure to the influenza virus. In a sense, the standard annual\ninfluenza shots are booster doses. But the A(H5N1) vaccine is a\nprimary immunization because, having had no exposure to that virus,\npeople lack any immunity to the avian strain.\nThe United States is thought to be the only country that has produced\na human vaccine against the A(H5N1) influenza strain. Australia,\nCanada, France, Japan [and the UK] are among countries where\nscientists are trying to develop human avian influenza vaccines,\naccording to the World Health Organization.\nDr. Fauci's institute also contracted with Chiron, which is based in\nEmeryville, California to make another A(H5N1) vaccine. But tests of\nthe Chiron vaccine have not started because of delays related to\nprior contamination found in Chiron's plants. Dr. Fauci said his\ninstitute has 8000 doses of the Chiron human A(H5N1) vaccine and\nhopes to start testing it in volunteers in late fall. The tests will\nfollow the same steps taken with the Sanofi-Pasteur vaccine, he said.\n[Byline: Lawrence K.

Currently, at risk people\nin the UK -- the elderly and ill -- need annual flu jabs, and there\nis no jab available yet guaranteed to beat avian influenza.\nBiotechnology firm Acambis, in Cambridge, UK says it hopes its jab\nwill target numerous mutations that presently allow flu to evade\nattack. However, the work is very early and is years off being tested\nin humans.\nEach year, winter flu kills around 4000 people in the UK. Globally,\nbetween 500 000 and one million people die each year from influenza.\nIf the avian influenza virus currently circulating in Asia were to\nmutate and spread from person to person, it could kill as many people\nas the 1918 Spanish flu, which claimed between 20 and 40 million\nlives, experts have warned.\nCurrent influenza vaccines work by giving immunity to 2 proteins\ncalled hemagglutinin and neuraminidase, which are found on the\nsurface of flu viruses. However, these proteins keep mutating, which\nmeans doctors have to keep making new vaccines to keep up. Scientists\nat Acambis' laboratory in the US, together with Belgian researchers\nat Flanders Interuniversity Institute for Biotechnology, are focusing\ntheir efforts on a different protein, called M2, which does not\nmutate, as well as other technology that they cannot disclose yet for\ncommercial reasons. If successful, a single shot of the vaccine could\nprotect a person against all strains of influenza virus, they\nbelieve. Dr. Thomas Monath, chief scientific officer at Acambis,\nsaid: \"We aim to avoid the need for annual re-engineering and\nmanufacture of the new product, something that is not yet possible\nwith existing vaccines. The need to develop a new vaccine each time a\ndifferent influenza strain emerges often results in long delays\nbefore a population can be protected. The technology also has special\nimportance as a potential means of protecting human populations\nagainst pandemic influenza strains. So far, the vaccine has only been\ntested in animals. The scientists said it would take several years\nbefore large-scale human trials could be done.\nProfessor Maria Zambon, a flu expert at the Health Protection Agency,\nsaid: \"We welcome advances in the process of developing novel flu\nvaccines and vaccination techniques. However, this vaccine is still\nvery early in a vaccine development pipeline, and it will take some\ntime to establish how this vaccine performs in human trials and\nwhether it can proceed to being licensed for use in the UK.\"\nProfessor Karl Nicholson, professor of infectious diseases at\nLeicester University, said: \"It would be enormously helpful to\nmankind to have just the one vaccine, but, sadly, I think it is a\nlong way off.\" He said it might be 10 years before any such product\ncould be ready for widespread use in humans.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n******\n[2]\nDate: Sun 7 Aug 2005\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: The New York Times, Sun 7 Aug 2005 [edited]\n<http://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/07/health/07vaccine.html?th&emc=th>\n\nAvian Influenza Vaccine Called Effective in Human Testing\n-----------------------------------------------\nGovernment scientists say they have successfully tested in people a\nvaccine that they believe can protect against the strain of avian\ninfluenza that is spreading in birds through Asia and Russia. Health\nofficials have been racing to develop a vaccine because they worry\nthat, if that strain mutated and combined with a human influenza\nvirus to create a new virus, it could spread rapidly through the\nworld. (The vaccine cannot lead to such a situation, because it is\nmade from killed virus.) Tens of millions of birds have died from\ninfection with the virus and culling to prevent the spread of the\nvirus.

They are Cambodia (4 cases), Indonesia (one\ncase), Thailand (17 cases), and Viet Nam (90 cases).\nThe additional tests are needed in part to determine the optimal dose\nof vaccine; how many shots people will need for protection; and\nwhether adding another ingredient called an adjuvant to the vaccine\ncould raise the potency of lower doses, stretching the number of\npeople that could be protected. Even when these tests are completed,\nmore time will be needed before the Food and Drug Administration can\nlicense the human vaccine and before policy makers determine the when\nand how it should be administered.\nGovernment researchers and others developed the vaccine, which is\nproduced by Sanofi-Pasteur, a French vaccine company that is now part\nof Aventis. The government could decide to release the product under\nemergency conditions if an A(H5N1) influenza pandemic struck before\nthe testing process was completed. Although cautioning that the\nvaccine has not been fully tested, Dr. Fauci said that the initial\ntest findings have given the federal government enough confidence to\nstart the process of adding millions more doses of the vaccine to the\n2 million it has bought. The present supply is stored in bulk form,\nand \"we cannot put it in vials until we find out what the right dose\nis,\" Dr. Fauci said. The manufacturer needs to know the dose and\nregimen to determine how much more vaccine it can produce and make\navailable to the United States and other customers.\nScientists had to test the human avian influenza vaccine on\nvolunteers, because the A(H5N1) strain differs in significant ways\nfrom the conventional strains that cause human influenza. Also, the\ninfluenza shots that are offered each year are derived from the human\nstrains that are circulating most widely at the time experts choose\nthe components of the next vaccine. Human influenza viruses mutate\nenough each year to force changes in the standard vaccines. Such\nvaccines produce a broader and stronger immunity, because recipients\nbuild up an immunity to influenza from repeated immunizations and\nexposure to the influenza virus. In a sense, the standard annual\ninfluenza shots are booster doses. But the A(H5N1) vaccine is a\nprimary immunization because, having had no exposure to that virus,\npeople lack any immunity to the avian strain.\nThe United States is thought to be the only country that has produced\na human vaccine against the A(H5N1) influenza strain. Australia,\nCanada, France, Japan [and the UK] are among countries where\nscientists are trying to develop human avian influenza vaccines,\naccording to the World Health Organization.\nDr. Fauci's institute also contracted with Chiron, which is based in\nEmeryville, California to make another A(H5N1) vaccine. But tests of\nthe Chiron vaccine have not started because of delays related to\nprior contamination found in Chiron's plants. Dr. Fauci said his\ninstitute has 8000 doses of the Chiron human A(H5N1) vaccine and\nhopes to start testing it in volunteers in late fall.

Currently, at risk people\nin the UK -- the elderly and ill -- need annual flu jabs, and there\nis no jab available yet guaranteed to beat avian influenza.\nBiotechnology firm Acambis, in Cambridge, UK says it hopes its jab\nwill target numerous mutations that presently allow flu to evade\nattack. However, the work is very early and is years off being tested\nin humans.\nEach year, winter flu kills around 4000 people in the UK. Globally,\nbetween 500 000 and one million people die each year from influenza.\nIf the avian influenza virus currently circulating in Asia were to\nmutate and spread from person to person, it could kill as many people\nas the 1918 Spanish flu, which claimed between 20 and 40 million\nlives, experts have warned.\nCurrent influenza vaccines work by giving immunity to 2 proteins\ncalled hemagglutinin and neuraminidase, which are found on the\nsurface of flu viruses. However, these proteins keep mutating, which\nmeans doctors have to keep making new vaccines to keep up. Scientists\nat Acambis' laboratory in the US, together with Belgian researchers\nat Flanders Interuniversity Institute for Biotechnology, are focusing\ntheir efforts on a different protein, called M2, which does not\nmutate, as well as other technology that they cannot disclose yet for\ncommercial reasons. If successful, a single shot of the vaccine could\nprotect a person against all strains of influenza virus, they\nbelieve. Dr. Thomas Monath, chief scientific officer at Acambis,\nsaid: \"We aim to avoid the need for annual re-engineering and\nmanufacture of the new product, something that is not yet possible\nwith existing vaccines. The need to develop a new vaccine each time a\ndifferent influenza strain emerges often results in long delays\nbefore a population can be protected. The technology also has special\nimportance as a potential means of protecting human populations\nagainst pandemic influenza strains. So far, the vaccine has only been\ntested in animals. The scientists said it would take several years\nbefore large-scale human trials could be done.\nProfessor Maria Zambon, a flu expert at the Health Protection Agency,\nsaid: \"We welcome advances in the process of developing novel flu\nvaccines and vaccination techniques. However, this vaccine is still\nvery early in a vaccine development pipeline, and it will take some\ntime to establish how this vaccine performs in human trials and\nwhether it can proceed to being licensed for use in the UK.\"\nProfessor Karl Nicholson, professor of infectious diseases at\nLeicester University, said: \"It would be enormously helpful to\nmankind to have just the one vaccine, but, sadly, I think it is a\nlong way off.\" He said it might be 10 years before any such product\ncould be ready for widespread use in humans.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n******\n[2]\nDate: Sun 7 Aug 2005\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: The New York Times, Sun 7 Aug 2005 [edited]\n<http://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/07/health/07vaccine.html?th&emc=th>\n\nAvian Influenza Vaccine Called Effective in Human Testing\n-----------------------------------------------\nGovernment scientists say they have successfully tested in people a\nvaccine that they believe can protect against the strain of avian\ninfluenza that is spreading in birds through Asia and Russia. Health\nofficials have been racing to develop a vaccine because they worry\nthat, if that strain mutated and combined with a human influenza\nvirus to create a new virus, it could spread rapidly through the\nworld. (The vaccine cannot lead to such a situation, because it is\nmade from killed virus.) Tens of millions of birds have died from\ninfection with the virus and culling to prevent the spread of the\nvirus. About 100 people have been infected, and about 50 [112 and 57\nas of 5 Aug 2005 - Mod.CP] have died from this strain of the avian\ninfluenza virus, called A(H5N1). So far, there has been no sustained\nhuman-to-human transmission, but that is what health officials fear,\nbecause it could cause a pandemic. And that fear has driven the\nintense research to develop a vaccine.\nThe Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious\nDiseases, Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, said that while the vaccine that has\nundergone preliminary tests could be used on an emergency basis if a\npandemic developed, it would still be several months before that\nvaccine is tested further and, if licensed, offered to the public. He\ncautioned: \"We don't have all the vaccine we need to meet the\npossible demand. The critical issue now is, can we make enough\nvaccine, given the well-known inability of the vaccine industry to\nmake enough vaccine.\"\nAn earlier human vaccine against A(H5N1) avian influenza virus was\nprepared after it 1st appeared in the world, in Hong Kong in 1997.\nThat vaccine was never fully developed or used, and the strain has\nmutated since then. In interviews over recent days, Dr. Fauci has\nsaid that tests so far have shown that the new vaccine produced a\nstrong immune response among the small group of healthy adults under\nage 65 who volunteered to receive it, although the doses needed were\nhigher than in the standard influenza vaccine offered each year. The\nvaccine, developed with genetic engineering techniques, is intended\nto protect against infection, not to treat those who are sick.\nFurther tests are expected to be conducted among 2 groups -- people\n65 and older, and children -- over the next several months. Dr. Fauci\nexpressed confidence that they would confirm the success of the 1st\ntests and answer remaining scientific questions.\nBecause the vaccine is made in chicken eggs, \"a potential major\nstumbling block\" to successful mass production is the number of eggs\nfarmers can supply to vaccine manufacturers, Dr. Fauci said. If\nmanufacturers can overcome such hurdles, the new vaccine could go far\nin averting a possible pandemic of human influenza, Dr. Fauci said.\nOnly a small number of human cases of A(H5N1) influenza have been\nfound. Although a few cases may have been transmitted from person to\nperson in Asia, the A(H5N1) strain has not garnered enough strength\nto spread widely among humans anywhere.

Currently, at risk people\nin the UK -- the elderly and ill -- need annual flu jabs, and there\nis no jab available yet guaranteed to beat avian influenza.\nBiotechnology firm Acambis, in Cambridge, UK says it hopes its jab\nwill target numerous mutations that presently allow flu to evade\nattack. However, the work is very early and is years off being tested\nin humans.\nEach year, winter flu kills around 4000 people in the UK. Globally,\nbetween 500 000 and one million people die each year from influenza.\nIf the avian influenza virus currently circulating in Asia were to\nmutate and spread from person to person, it could kill as many people\nas the 1918 Spanish flu, which claimed between 20 and 40 million\nlives, experts have warned.\nCurrent influenza vaccines work by giving immunity to 2 proteins\ncalled hemagglutinin and neuraminidase, which are found on the\nsurface of flu viruses. However, these proteins keep mutating, which\nmeans doctors have to keep making new vaccines to keep up. Scientists\nat Acambis' laboratory in the US, together with Belgian researchers\nat Flanders Interuniversity Institute for Biotechnology, are focusing\ntheir efforts on a different protein, called M2, which does not\nmutate, as well as other technology that they cannot disclose yet for\ncommercial reasons. If successful, a single shot of the vaccine could\nprotect a person against all strains of influenza virus, they\nbelieve. Dr. Thomas Monath, chief scientific officer at Acambis,\nsaid: \"We aim to avoid the need for annual re-engineering and\nmanufacture of the new product, something that is not yet possible\nwith existing vaccines. The need to develop a new vaccine each time a\ndifferent influenza strain emerges often results in long delays\nbefore a population can be protected. The technology also has special\nimportance as a potential means of protecting human populations\nagainst pandemic influenza strains. So far, the vaccine has only been\ntested in animals. The scientists said it would take several years\nbefore large-scale human trials could be done.\nProfessor Maria Zambon, a flu expert at the Health Protection Agency,\nsaid: \"We welcome advances in the process of developing novel flu\nvaccines and vaccination techniques. However, this vaccine is still\nvery early in a vaccine development pipeline, and it will take some\ntime to establish how this vaccine performs in human trials and\nwhether it can proceed to being licensed for use in the UK.\"\nProfessor Karl Nicholson, professor of infectious diseases at\nLeicester University, said: \"It would be enormously helpful to\nmankind to have just the one vaccine, but, sadly, I think it is a\nlong way off.\" He said it might be 10 years before any such product\ncould be ready for widespread use in humans.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n******\n[2]\nDate: Sun 7 Aug 2005\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: The New York Times, Sun 7 Aug 2005 [edited]\n<http://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/07/health/07vaccine.html?th&emc=th>\n\nAvian Influenza Vaccine Called Effective in Human Testing\n-----------------------------------------------\nGovernment scientists say they have successfully tested in people a\nvaccine that they believe can protect against the strain of avian\ninfluenza that is spreading in birds through Asia and Russia. Health\nofficials have been racing to develop a vaccine because they worry\nthat, if that strain mutated and combined with a human influenza\nvirus to create a new virus, it could spread rapidly through the\nworld. (The vaccine cannot lead to such a situation, because it is\nmade from killed virus.) Tens of millions of birds have died from\ninfection with the virus and culling to prevent the spread of the\nvirus. About 100 people have been infected, and about 50 [112 and 57\nas of 5 Aug 2005 - Mod.CP] have died from this strain of the avian\ninfluenza virus, called A(H5N1). So far, there has been no sustained\nhuman-to-human transmission, but that is what health officials fear,\nbecause it could cause a pandemic. And that fear has driven the\nintense research to develop a vaccine.\nThe Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious\nDiseases, Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, said that while the vaccine that has\nundergone preliminary tests could be used on an emergency basis if a\npandemic developed, it would still be several months before that\nvaccine is tested further and, if licensed, offered to the public. He\ncautioned: \"We don't have all the vaccine we need to meet the\npossible demand. The critical issue now is, can we make enough\nvaccine, given the well-known inability of the vaccine industry to\nmake enough vaccine.\"\nAn earlier human vaccine against A(H5N1) avian influenza virus was\nprepared after it 1st appeared in the world, in Hong Kong in 1997.\nThat vaccine was never fully developed or used, and the strain has\nmutated since then. In interviews over recent days, Dr. Fauci has\nsaid that tests so far have shown that the new vaccine produced a\nstrong immune response among the small group of healthy adults under\nage 65 who volunteered to receive it, although the doses needed were\nhigher than in the standard influenza vaccine offered each year. The\nvaccine, developed with genetic engineering techniques, is intended\nto protect against infection, not to treat those who are sick.\nFurther tests are expected to be conducted among 2 groups -- people\n65 and older, and children -- over the next several months. Dr. Fauci\nexpressed confidence that they would confirm the success of the 1st\ntests and answer remaining scientific questions.\nBecause the vaccine is made in chicken eggs, \"a potential major\nstumbling block\" to successful mass production is the number of eggs\nfarmers can supply to vaccine manufacturers, Dr. Fauci said. If\nmanufacturers can overcome such hurdles, the new vaccine could go far\nin averting a possible pandemic of human influenza, Dr. Fauci said.\nOnly a small number of human cases of A(H5N1) influenza have been\nfound. Although a few cases may have been transmitted from person to\nperson in Asia, the A(H5N1) strain has not garnered enough strength\nto spread widely among humans anywhere. As of Friday [5 Aug 2005]\nnight, according to the World Health Organization in Geneva, the\navian strain has killed 57 of the 112 people it has been known to\ninfect in 4 countries. They are Cambodia (4 cases), Indonesia (one\ncase), Thailand (17 cases), and Viet Nam (90 cases).\nThe additional tests are needed in part to determine the optimal dose\nof vaccine; how many shots people will need for protection; and\nwhether adding another ingredient called an adjuvant to the vaccine\ncould raise the potency of lower doses, stretching the number of\npeople that could be protected. Even when these tests are completed,\nmore time will be needed before the Food and Drug Administration can\nlicense the human vaccine and before policy makers determine the when\nand how it should be administered.\nGovernment researchers and others developed the vaccine, which is\nproduced by Sanofi-Pasteur, a French vaccine company that is now part\nof Aventis. The government could decide to release the product under\nemergency conditions if an A(H5N1) influenza pandemic struck before\nthe testing process was completed. Although cautioning that the\nvaccine has not been fully tested, Dr. Fauci said that the initial\ntest findings have given the federal government enough confidence to\nstart the process of adding millions more doses of the vaccine to the\n2 million it has bought. The present supply is stored in bulk form,\nand \"we cannot put it in vials until we find out what the right dose\nis,\" Dr. Fauci said. The manufacturer needs to know the dose and\nregimen to determine how much more vaccine it can produce and make\navailable to the United States and other customers.\nScientists had to test the human avian influenza vaccine on\nvolunteers, because the A(H5N1) strain differs in significant ways\nfrom the conventional strains that cause human influenza. Also, the\ninfluenza shots that are offered each year are derived from the human\nstrains that are circulating most widely at the time experts choose\nthe components of the next vaccine. Human influenza viruses mutate\nenough each year to force changes in the standard vaccines. Such\nvaccines produce a broader and stronger immunity, because recipients\nbuild up an immunity to influenza from repeated immunizations and\nexposure to the influenza virus. In a sense, the standard annual\ninfluenza shots are booster doses. But the A(H5N1) vaccine is a\nprimary immunization because, having had no exposure to that virus,\npeople lack any immunity to the avian strain.\nThe United States is thought to be the only country that has produced\na human vaccine against the A(H5N1) influenza strain.

Currently, at risk people\nin the UK -- the elderly and ill -- need annual flu jabs, and there\nis no jab available yet guaranteed to beat avian influenza.\nBiotechnology firm Acambis, in Cambridge, UK says it hopes its jab\nwill target numerous mutations that presently allow flu to evade\nattack. However, the work is very early and is years off being tested\nin humans.\nEach year, winter flu kills around 4000 people in the UK. Globally,\nbetween 500 000 and one million people die each year from influenza.\nIf the avian influenza virus currently circulating in Asia were to\nmutate and spread from person to person, it could kill as many people\nas the 1918 Spanish flu, which claimed between 20 and 40 million\nlives, experts have warned.\nCurrent influenza vaccines work by giving immunity to 2 proteins\ncalled hemagglutinin and neuraminidase, which are found on the\nsurface of flu viruses. However, these proteins keep mutating, which\nmeans doctors have to keep making new vaccines to keep up. Scientists\nat Acambis' laboratory in the US, together with Belgian researchers\nat Flanders Interuniversity Institute for Biotechnology, are focusing\ntheir efforts on a different protein, called M2, which does not\nmutate, as well as other technology that they cannot disclose yet for\ncommercial reasons. If successful, a single shot of the vaccine could\nprotect a person against all strains of influenza virus, they\nbelieve. Dr. Thomas Monath, chief scientific officer at Acambis,\nsaid: \"We aim to avoid the need for annual re-engineering and\nmanufacture of the new product, something that is not yet possible\nwith existing vaccines. The need to develop a new vaccine each time a\ndifferent influenza strain emerges often results in long delays\nbefore a population can be protected. The technology also has special\nimportance as a potential means of protecting human populations\nagainst pandemic influenza strains. So far, the vaccine has only been\ntested in animals. The scientists said it would take several years\nbefore large-scale human trials could be done.\nProfessor Maria Zambon, a flu expert at the Health Protection Agency,\nsaid: \"We welcome advances in the process of developing novel flu\nvaccines and vaccination techniques. However, this vaccine is still\nvery early in a vaccine development pipeline, and it will take some\ntime to establish how this vaccine performs in human trials and\nwhether it can proceed to being licensed for use in the UK.\"\nProfessor Karl Nicholson, professor of infectious diseases at\nLeicester University, said: \"It would be enormously helpful to\nmankind to have just the one vaccine, but, sadly, I think it is a\nlong way off.\" He said it might be 10 years before any such product\ncould be ready for widespread use in humans.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n******\n[2]\nDate: Sun 7 Aug 2005\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: The New York Times, Sun 7 Aug 2005 [edited]\n<http://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/07/health/07vaccine.html?th&emc=th>\n\nAvian Influenza Vaccine Called Effective in Human Testing\n-----------------------------------------------\nGovernment scientists say they have successfully tested in people a\nvaccine that they believe can protect against the strain of avian\ninfluenza that is spreading in birds through Asia and Russia. Health\nofficials have been racing to develop a vaccine because they worry\nthat, if that strain mutated and combined with a human influenza\nvirus to create a new virus, it could spread rapidly through the\nworld. (The vaccine cannot lead to such a situation, because it is\nmade from killed virus.) Tens of millions of birds have died from\ninfection with the virus and culling to prevent the spread of the\nvirus. About 100 people have been infected, and about 50 [112 and 57\nas of 5 Aug 2005 - Mod.CP] have died from this strain of the avian\ninfluenza virus, called A(H5N1). So far, there has been no sustained\nhuman-to-human transmission, but that is what health officials fear,\nbecause it could cause a pandemic. And that fear has driven the\nintense research to develop a vaccine.\nThe Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious\nDiseases, Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, said that while the vaccine that has\nundergone preliminary tests could be used on an emergency basis if a\npandemic developed, it would still be several months before that\nvaccine is tested further and, if licensed, offered to the public. He\ncautioned: \"We don't have all the vaccine we need to meet the\npossible demand. The critical issue now is, can we make enough\nvaccine, given the well-known inability of the vaccine industry to\nmake enough vaccine.\"\nAn earlier human vaccine against A(H5N1) avian influenza virus was\nprepared after it 1st appeared in the world, in Hong Kong in 1997.\nThat vaccine was never fully developed or used, and the strain has\nmutated since then. In interviews over recent days, Dr. Fauci has\nsaid that tests so far have shown that the new vaccine produced a\nstrong immune response among the small group of healthy adults under\nage 65 who volunteered to receive it, although the doses needed were\nhigher than in the standard influenza vaccine offered each year. The\nvaccine, developed with genetic engineering techniques, is intended\nto protect against infection, not to treat those who are sick.\nFurther tests are expected to be conducted among 2 groups -- people\n65 and older, and children -- over the next several months. Dr. Fauci\nexpressed confidence that they would confirm the success of the 1st\ntests and answer remaining scientific questions.\nBecause the vaccine is made in chicken eggs, \"a potential major\nstumbling block\" to successful mass production is the number of eggs\nfarmers can supply to vaccine manufacturers, Dr. Fauci said. If\nmanufacturers can overcome such hurdles, the new vaccine could go far\nin averting a possible pandemic of human influenza, Dr. Fauci said.\nOnly a small number of human cases of A(H5N1) influenza have been\nfound. Although a few cases may have been transmitted from person to\nperson in Asia, the A(H5N1) strain has not garnered enough strength\nto spread widely among humans anywhere. As of Friday [5 Aug 2005]\nnight, according to the World Health Organization in Geneva, the\navian strain has killed 57 of the 112 people it has been known to\ninfect in 4 countries. They are Cambodia (4 cases), Indonesia (one\ncase), Thailand (17 cases), and Viet Nam (90 cases).\nThe additional tests are needed in part to determine the optimal dose\nof vaccine; how many shots people will need for protection; and\nwhether adding another ingredient called an adjuvant to the vaccine\ncould raise the potency of lower doses, stretching the number of\npeople that could be protected. Even when these tests are completed,\nmore time will be needed before the Food and Drug Administration can\nlicense the human vaccine and before policy makers determine the when\nand how it should be administered.\nGovernment researchers and others developed the vaccine, which is\nproduced by Sanofi-Pasteur, a French vaccine company that is now part\nof Aventis. The government could decide to release the product under\nemergency conditions if an A(H5N1) influenza pandemic struck before\nthe testing process was completed. Although cautioning that the\nvaccine has not been fully tested, Dr. Fauci said that the initial\ntest findings have given the federal government enough confidence to\nstart the process of adding millions more doses of the vaccine to the\n2 million it has bought. The present supply is stored in bulk form,\nand \"we cannot put it in vials until we find out what the right dose\nis,\" Dr. Fauci said. The manufacturer needs to know the dose and\nregimen to determine how much more vaccine it can produce and make\navailable to the United States and other customers.\nScientists had to test the human avian influenza vaccine on\nvolunteers, because the A(H5N1) strain differs in significant ways\nfrom the conventional strains that cause human influenza. Also, the\ninfluenza shots that are offered each year are derived from the human\nstrains that are circulating most widely at the time experts choose\nthe components of the next vaccine. Human influenza viruses mutate\nenough each year to force changes in the standard vaccines. Such\nvaccines produce a broader and stronger immunity, because recipients\nbuild up an immunity to influenza from repeated immunizations and\nexposure to the influenza virus. In a sense, the standard annual\ninfluenza shots are booster doses. But the A(H5N1) vaccine is a\nprimary immunization because, having had no exposure to that virus,\npeople lack any immunity to the avian strain.\nThe United States is thought to be the only country that has produced\na human vaccine against the A(H5N1) influenza strain. Australia,\nCanada, France, Japan [and the UK] are among countries where\nscientists are trying to develop human avian influenza vaccines,\naccording to the World Health Organization.\nDr. Fauci's institute also contracted with Chiron, which is based in\nEmeryville, California to make another A(H5N1) vaccine. But tests of\nthe Chiron vaccine have not started because of delays related to\nprior contamination found in Chiron's plants. Dr. Fauci said his\ninstitute has 8000 doses of the Chiron human A(H5N1) vaccine and\nhopes to start testing it in volunteers in late fall. The tests will\nfollow the same steps taken with the Sanofi-Pasteur vaccine, he said.\n[Byline: Lawrence K.

Only specific protein signatures\nof the highly pathogenic H5N1 strain were spotted at ICMR's influenza\nreferral laboratory in Chennai's King Institute of Preventive Medicine-the\ndisease itself has not been detected.\nResearchers found the H5N1 signs in samples collected in 2002, which was\nconfirmed by the world's foremost infectious diseases laboratory, the\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Atlanta late in 2004. Dr\nNirmal K Ganguly, director general of ICMR, told this website newspaper\nthat he was not aware of such a finding, suggesting that if such a\nhigh-profile exotic virus were to surface in India, his staff would alert\nhim. However, he was at the moment in total darkness about the discovery.\nDr Jackie Katz of the CDC's Influenza Branch confirmed to this website\nnewspaper that the 3 people tested positive for antibody to a highly\npathogenic H5N1 virus. Dr Katz added that here is no cause for alarm.\nTill now, only these protein signatures have been found, and irrefutable\nevidence of whether the deadly H5N1 strain is present in humans in India\ncan emerge only when the virus is isolated and sequenced.\nBut virus isolation and sequencing has not been attempted in India, as\nthere is a lack of such a secure bio-safety facility, said Dr A C Mishra,\ndirector of the National Institute of Virology, Pune. He added that a\nhigh-level meeting is being organised at ICMR soon to take stock of the\nsituation and decide on the steps to be taken.\nThe H5N1 strain normally infects only birds -- in poultry it causes\nepidemics -- but is worrisome because it has been found to jump the species\nbarrier and infect humans, like what happened in Hong Kong in 1997, when 6\npeople died and the entire 1.5 million bird poultry stock of the island had\nto culled.\nThe avian influenza virus has been in the headlines since its outbreak in\nEast Asia in 2004, and the World Health Organisation (WHO) has issued a\nglobal alert about this highly contagious bug. The WHO Regional\nRepresentative to India, Dr Salim Habayeb, expressed complete surprise that\nhe was not informed about this finding by the government, even though he\ngets a weekly report of prevalent communicable animal and human diseases.\nExpressing concern, Dr Habayeb said the H5N1 strain is very [virulent], as\nit mutates very quickly -- a benign non-pathogenic strain could quickly\nbecome a deadly virus, since this particular family of bugs are known to\nswap genes at a very rapid pace.\nBut Habayeb says there is no reason to panic, as India has adequate\nmechanisms for control of disease outbreaks, citing the effective handling\nof the SARS incident.\nIndian researcher Dr Nalini Ramamurthy, director of The King Institute of\nPreventive Medicine, Chennai said their group chanced upon these 3 cases of\nseropositivity in a poultry farm in Kattangalathur, about 45 km south of\nChennai, while routinely monitoring the human population for influenza\nantibodies.\nAll 3 who show positivity have never travelled overseas, nor is any poultry\nimported into India from East Asia regions where epidemics have occurred --\nso a native exposure to the virus is the only alternative, she says.\nDr Ramamurthy believes that the nearby Vedanthangal Bird Sanctuary, which\nis visited by many migratory water birds, could be the source of the\ninfection. But a study urgently needs to be undertaken to see if the\nseroprevalence has spread to other farms or not, says Dr Ramamurthy.\nAccording to the WHO's standard operating procedures, whenever signatures\nof such a highly pathogenic strain are found, intensive studies of both the\nbirds and humans in the area should be undertaken so the source can be\nidentified. Even Katz suggests that continued testing of humans and poultry\nneeds to be undertaken so that we may better understand the risks of human\ninfection with avian influenza viruses.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[H5N1 is a highly pathogenic strain of influenza for poultry. While\nnumerous H5N1 outbreaks have been reported since late 2003 in most (if not\nall) East Asian countries, no single report of an avian flu outbreak from\nneighboring India has been documented since 2001. In the above reports it\nis stated that the samples in question were drawn in 2002 from 3 local\npoultry farm workers and that the seropositive results obtained by the CDC\n(Atlanta) have been available in ICMR since late 2004. Poultry is a major\nstate industry for the area, and migratory birds arrive every year on Tamil\nNadu's coast in Vedanthangal, north of Chennai. Therefore, it is rather\npuzzling that 3 people were infected with the HPAI H5N1 while working in\nthe poultry farm(s), but that no sick or dead birds were ever discovered or\nreported by the local or national health authorities, such as ICMR.

Only specific protein signatures\nof the highly pathogenic H5N1 strain were spotted at ICMR's influenza\nreferral laboratory in Chennai's King Institute of Preventive Medicine-the\ndisease itself has not been detected.\nResearchers found the H5N1 signs in samples collected in 2002, which was\nconfirmed by the world's foremost infectious diseases laboratory, the\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Atlanta late in 2004. Dr\nNirmal K Ganguly, director general of ICMR, told this website newspaper\nthat he was not aware of such a finding, suggesting that if such a\nhigh-profile exotic virus were to surface in India, his staff would alert\nhim. However, he was at the moment in total darkness about the discovery.\nDr Jackie Katz of the CDC's Influenza Branch confirmed to this website\nnewspaper that the 3 people tested positive for antibody to a highly\npathogenic H5N1 virus. Dr Katz added that here is no cause for alarm.\nTill now, only these protein signatures have been found, and irrefutable\nevidence of whether the deadly H5N1 strain is present in humans in India\ncan emerge only when the virus is isolated and sequenced.\nBut virus isolation and sequencing has not been attempted in India, as\nthere is a lack of such a secure bio-safety facility, said Dr A C Mishra,\ndirector of the National Institute of Virology, Pune. He added that a\nhigh-level meeting is being organised at ICMR soon to take stock of the\nsituation and decide on the steps to be taken.\nThe H5N1 strain normally infects only birds -- in poultry it causes\nepidemics -- but is worrisome because it has been found to jump the species\nbarrier and infect humans, like what happened in Hong Kong in 1997, when 6\npeople died and the entire 1.5 million bird poultry stock of the island had\nto culled.\nThe avian influenza virus has been in the headlines since its outbreak in\nEast Asia in 2004, and the World Health Organisation (WHO) has issued a\nglobal alert about this highly contagious bug. The WHO Regional\nRepresentative to India, Dr Salim Habayeb, expressed complete surprise that\nhe was not informed about this finding by the government, even though he\ngets a weekly report of prevalent communicable animal and human diseases.\nExpressing concern, Dr Habayeb said the H5N1 strain is very [virulent], as\nit mutates very quickly -- a benign non-pathogenic strain could quickly\nbecome a deadly virus, since this particular family of bugs are known to\nswap genes at a very rapid pace.\nBut Habayeb says there is no reason to panic, as India has adequate\nmechanisms for control of disease outbreaks, citing the effective handling\nof the SARS incident.\nIndian researcher Dr Nalini Ramamurthy, director of The King Institute of\nPreventive Medicine, Chennai said their group chanced upon these 3 cases of\nseropositivity in a poultry farm in Kattangalathur, about 45 km south of\nChennai, while routinely monitoring the human population for influenza\nantibodies.\nAll 3 who show positivity have never travelled overseas, nor is any poultry\nimported into India from East Asia regions where epidemics have occurred --\nso a native exposure to the virus is the only alternative, she says.\nDr Ramamurthy believes that the nearby Vedanthangal Bird Sanctuary, which\nis visited by many migratory water birds, could be the source of the\ninfection. But a study urgently needs to be undertaken to see if the\nseroprevalence has spread to other farms or not, says Dr Ramamurthy.\nAccording to the WHO's standard operating procedures, whenever signatures\nof such a highly pathogenic strain are found, intensive studies of both the\nbirds and humans in the area should be undertaken so the source can be\nidentified. Even Katz suggests that continued testing of humans and poultry\nneeds to be undertaken so that we may better understand the risks of human\ninfection with avian influenza viruses.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[H5N1 is a highly pathogenic strain of influenza for poultry. While\nnumerous H5N1 outbreaks have been reported since late 2003 in most (if not\nall) East Asian countries, no single report of an avian flu outbreak from\nneighboring India has been documented since 2001.

Only specific protein signatures\nof the highly pathogenic H5N1 strain were spotted at ICMR's influenza\nreferral laboratory in Chennai's King Institute of Preventive Medicine-the\ndisease itself has not been detected.\nResearchers found the H5N1 signs in samples collected in 2002, which was\nconfirmed by the world's foremost infectious diseases laboratory, the\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Atlanta late in 2004. Dr\nNirmal K Ganguly, director general of ICMR, told this website newspaper\nthat he was not aware of such a finding, suggesting that if such a\nhigh-profile exotic virus were to surface in India, his staff would alert\nhim. However, he was at the moment in total darkness about the discovery.\nDr Jackie Katz of the CDC's Influenza Branch confirmed to this website\nnewspaper that the 3 people tested positive for antibody to a highly\npathogenic H5N1 virus. Dr Katz added that here is no cause for alarm.\nTill now, only these protein signatures have been found, and irrefutable\nevidence of whether the deadly H5N1 strain is present in humans in India\ncan emerge only when the virus is isolated and sequenced.\nBut virus isolation and sequencing has not been attempted in India, as\nthere is a lack of such a secure bio-safety facility, said Dr A C Mishra,\ndirector of the National Institute of Virology, Pune. He added that a\nhigh-level meeting is being organised at ICMR soon to take stock of the\nsituation and decide on the steps to be taken.\nThe H5N1 strain normally infects only birds -- in poultry it causes\nepidemics -- but is worrisome because it has been found to jump the species\nbarrier and infect humans, like what happened in Hong Kong in 1997, when 6\npeople died and the entire 1.5 million bird poultry stock of the island had\nto culled.\nThe avian influenza virus has been in the headlines since its outbreak in\nEast Asia in 2004, and the World Health Organisation (WHO) has issued a\nglobal alert about this highly contagious bug. The WHO Regional\nRepresentative to India, Dr Salim Habayeb, expressed complete surprise that\nhe was not informed about this finding by the government, even though he\ngets a weekly report of prevalent communicable animal and human diseases.\nExpressing concern, Dr Habayeb said the H5N1 strain is very [virulent], as\nit mutates very quickly -- a benign non-pathogenic strain could quickly\nbecome a deadly virus, since this particular family of bugs are known to\nswap genes at a very rapid pace.\nBut Habayeb says there is no reason to panic, as India has adequate\nmechanisms for control of disease outbreaks, citing the effective handling\nof the SARS incident.\nIndian researcher Dr Nalini Ramamurthy, director of The King Institute of\nPreventive Medicine, Chennai said their group chanced upon these 3 cases of\nseropositivity in a poultry farm in Kattangalathur, about 45 km south of\nChennai, while routinely monitoring the human population for influenza\nantibodies.\nAll 3 who show positivity have never travelled overseas, nor is any poultry\nimported into India from East Asia regions where epidemics have occurred --\nso a native exposure to the virus is the only alternative, she says.\nDr Ramamurthy believes that the nearby Vedanthangal Bird Sanctuary, which\nis visited by many migratory water birds, could be the source of the\ninfection. But a study urgently needs to be undertaken to see if the\nseroprevalence has spread to other farms or not, says Dr Ramamurthy.\nAccording to the WHO's standard operating procedures, whenever signatures\nof such a highly pathogenic strain are found, intensive studies of both the\nbirds and humans in the area should be undertaken so the source can be\nidentified. Even Katz suggests that continued testing of humans and poultry\nneeds to be undertaken so that we may better understand the risks of human\ninfection with avian influenza viruses.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[H5N1 is a highly pathogenic strain of influenza for poultry. While\nnumerous H5N1 outbreaks have been reported since late 2003 in most (if not\nall) East Asian countries, no single report of an avian flu outbreak from\nneighboring India has been documented since 2001. In the above reports it\nis stated that the samples in question were drawn in 2002 from 3 local\npoultry farm workers and that the seropositive results obtained by the CDC\n(Atlanta) have been available in ICMR since late 2004. Poultry is a major\nstate industry for the area, and migratory birds arrive every year on Tamil\nNadu's coast in Vedanthangal, north of Chennai. Therefore, it is rather\npuzzling that 3 people were infected with the HPAI H5N1 while working in\nthe poultry farm(s), but that no sick or dead birds were ever discovered or\nreported by the local or national health authorities, such as ICMR.

Only specific protein signatures\nof the highly pathogenic H5N1 strain were spotted at ICMR's influenza\nreferral laboratory in Chennai's King Institute of Preventive Medicine-the\ndisease itself has not been detected.\nResearchers found the H5N1 signs in samples collected in 2002, which was\nconfirmed by the world's foremost infectious diseases laboratory, the\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Atlanta late in 2004. Dr\nNirmal K Ganguly, director general of ICMR, told this website newspaper\nthat he was not aware of such a finding, suggesting that if such a\nhigh-profile exotic virus were to surface in India, his staff would alert\nhim. However, he was at the moment in total darkness about the discovery.\nDr Jackie Katz of the CDC's Influenza Branch confirmed to this website\nnewspaper that the 3 people tested positive for antibody to a highly\npathogenic H5N1 virus. Dr Katz added that here is no cause for alarm.\nTill now, only these protein signatures have been found, and irrefutable\nevidence of whether the deadly H5N1 strain is present in humans in India\ncan emerge only when the virus is isolated and sequenced.\nBut virus isolation and sequencing has not been attempted in India, as\nthere is a lack of such a secure bio-safety facility, said Dr A C Mishra,\ndirector of the National Institute of Virology, Pune. He added that a\nhigh-level meeting is being organised at ICMR soon to take stock of the\nsituation and decide on the steps to be taken.\nThe H5N1 strain normally infects only birds -- in poultry it causes\nepidemics -- but is worrisome because it has been found to jump the species\nbarrier and infect humans, like what happened in Hong Kong in 1997, when 6\npeople died and the entire 1.5 million bird poultry stock of the island had\nto culled.\nThe avian influenza virus has been in the headlines since its outbreak in\nEast Asia in 2004, and the World Health Organisation (WHO) has issued a\nglobal alert about this highly contagious bug. The WHO Regional\nRepresentative to India, Dr Salim Habayeb, expressed complete surprise that\nhe was not informed about this finding by the government, even though he\ngets a weekly report of prevalent communicable animal and human diseases.\nExpressing concern, Dr Habayeb said the H5N1 strain is very [virulent], as\nit mutates very quickly -- a benign non-pathogenic strain could quickly\nbecome a deadly virus, since this particular family of bugs are known to\nswap genes at a very rapid pace.\nBut Habayeb says there is no reason to panic, as India has adequate\nmechanisms for control of disease outbreaks, citing the effective handling\nof the SARS incident.\nIndian researcher Dr Nalini Ramamurthy, director of The King Institute of\nPreventive Medicine, Chennai said their group chanced upon these 3 cases of\nseropositivity in a poultry farm in Kattangalathur, about 45 km south of\nChennai, while routinely monitoring the human population for influenza\nantibodies.\nAll 3 who show positivity have never travelled overseas, nor is any poultry\nimported into India from East Asia regions where epidemics have occurred --\nso a native exposure to the virus is the only alternative, she says.\nDr Ramamurthy believes that the nearby Vedanthangal Bird Sanctuary, which\nis visited by many migratory water birds, could be the source of the\ninfection. But a study urgently needs to be undertaken to see if the\nseroprevalence has spread to other farms or not, says Dr Ramamurthy.\nAccording to the WHO's standard operating procedures, whenever signatures\nof such a highly pathogenic strain are found, intensive studies of both the\nbirds and humans in the area should be undertaken so the source can be\nidentified. Even Katz suggests that continued testing of humans and poultry\nneeds to be undertaken so that we may better understand the risks of human\ninfection with avian influenza viruses.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[H5N1 is a highly pathogenic strain of influenza for poultry. While\nnumerous H5N1 outbreaks have been reported since late 2003 in most (if not\nall) East Asian countries, no single report of an avian flu outbreak from\nneighboring India has been documented since 2001. In the above reports it\nis stated that the samples in question were drawn in 2002 from 3 local\npoultry farm workers and that the seropositive results obtained by the CDC\n(Atlanta) have been available in ICMR since late 2004. Poultry is a major\nstate industry for the area, and migratory birds arrive every year on Tamil\nNadu's coast in Vedanthangal, north of Chennai. Therefore, it is rather\npuzzling that 3 people were infected with the HPAI H5N1 while working in\nthe poultry farm(s), but that no sick or dead birds were ever discovered or\nreported by the local or national health authorities, such as ICMR.

The samples were drawn\nfrom 3 poultry farm workers in Kattangalathur, 45 km from here.\nThe report caused alarm in the health department here, as poultry is a\nmajor state industry. Following the report, health secretary Sheela Rani\nChunkath held a meeting with experts on Wednesday. King Institute director\nNalini Ramamurthy was also present.\nThe government has ordered director of medical education P Vijayalakshmi to\ninvestigate the reported bird flu strain found among Tamil Nadu poultry\nworkers. Ramamurthy, however, dismissed the media report as alarmist and\nsaid: \"The disease itself has not been found. The findings were from random\nsamples taken in 2002.\"\nThe 3 poultry workers have not had bird flu and are doing well. Ramamurthy\nhas, however, sought a clinical study of migratory birds that arrive on\nTamil Nadu's coast in Vedanthangal, north of Chennai, every year saying\nthis could be a source for the virus strain.\n******\n[2]\nDate: Wed, May 11 2005 00:00 IST\nFrom: Ms. Donna Eberwine <eberwind@paho.org>\nSource: Webindia123, India, 11 May 2005 [edited]\n<http://www.newindpress.com/Newsitems.asp?ID=IE320050510121915&Title=Features>\n\nBird flu strain found in 3 Chennai poultry workers\n--------------------------------------------------\nScientists from a partner laboratory of the Indian Council of Medical\nResearch (ICMR) have found the 1st signs of an avian influenza virus in 3\nworkers from a poultry farm near Chennai. Only specific protein signatures\nof the highly pathogenic H5N1 strain were spotted at ICMR's influenza\nreferral laboratory in Chennai's King Institute of Preventive Medicine-the\ndisease itself has not been detected.\nResearchers found the H5N1 signs in samples collected in 2002, which was\nconfirmed by the world's foremost infectious diseases laboratory, the\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Atlanta late in 2004. Dr\nNirmal K Ganguly, director general of ICMR, told this website newspaper\nthat he was not aware of such a finding, suggesting that if such a\nhigh-profile exotic virus were to surface in India, his staff would alert\nhim. However, he was at the moment in total darkness about the discovery.\nDr Jackie Katz of the CDC's Influenza Branch confirmed to this website\nnewspaper that the 3 people tested positive for antibody to a highly\npathogenic H5N1 virus. Dr Katz added that here is no cause for alarm.\nTill now, only these protein signatures have been found, and irrefutable\nevidence of whether the deadly H5N1 strain is present in humans in India\ncan emerge only when the virus is isolated and sequenced.\nBut virus isolation and sequencing has not been attempted in India, as\nthere is a lack of such a secure bio-safety facility, said Dr A C Mishra,\ndirector of the National Institute of Virology, Pune. He added that a\nhigh-level meeting is being organised at ICMR soon to take stock of the\nsituation and decide on the steps to be taken.\nThe H5N1 strain normally infects only birds -- in poultry it causes\nepidemics -- but is worrisome because it has been found to jump the species\nbarrier and infect humans, like what happened in Hong Kong in 1997, when 6\npeople died and the entire 1.5 million bird poultry stock of the island had\nto culled.\nThe avian influenza virus has been in the headlines since its outbreak in\nEast Asia in 2004, and the World Health Organisation (WHO) has issued a\nglobal alert about this highly contagious bug. The WHO Regional\nRepresentative to India, Dr Salim Habayeb, expressed complete surprise that\nhe was not informed about this finding by the government, even though he\ngets a weekly report of prevalent communicable animal and human diseases.\nExpressing concern, Dr Habayeb said the H5N1 strain is very [virulent], as\nit mutates very quickly -- a benign non-pathogenic strain could quickly\nbecome a deadly virus, since this particular family of bugs are known to\nswap genes at a very rapid pace.\nBut Habayeb says there is no reason to panic, as India has adequate\nmechanisms for control of disease outbreaks, citing the effective handling\nof the SARS incident.\nIndian researcher Dr Nalini Ramamurthy, director of The King Institute of\nPreventive Medicine, Chennai said their group chanced upon these 3 cases of\nseropositivity in a poultry farm in Kattangalathur, about 45 km south of\nChennai, while routinely monitoring the human population for influenza\nantibodies.\nAll 3 who show positivity have never travelled overseas, nor is any poultry\nimported into India from East Asia regions where epidemics have occurred --\nso a native exposure to the virus is the only alternative, she says.\nDr Ramamurthy believes that the nearby Vedanthangal Bird Sanctuary, which\nis visited by many migratory water birds, could be the source of the\ninfection. But a study urgently needs to be undertaken to see if the\nseroprevalence has spread to other farms or not, says Dr Ramamurthy.\nAccording to the WHO's standard operating procedures, whenever signatures\nof such a highly pathogenic strain are found, intensive studies of both the\nbirds and humans in the area should be undertaken so the source can be\nidentified. Even Katz suggests that continued testing of humans and poultry\nneeds to be undertaken so that we may better understand the risks of human\ninfection with avian influenza viruses.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[H5N1 is a highly pathogenic strain of influenza for poultry. While\nnumerous H5N1 outbreaks have been reported since late 2003 in most (if not\nall) East Asian countries, no single report of an avian flu outbreak from\nneighboring India has been documented since 2001. In the above reports it\nis stated that the samples in question were drawn in 2002 from 3 local\npoultry farm workers and that the seropositive results obtained by the CDC\n(Atlanta) have been available in ICMR since late 2004. Poultry is a major\nstate industry for the area, and migratory birds arrive every year on Tamil\nNadu's coast in Vedanthangal, north of Chennai. Therefore, it is rather\npuzzling that 3 people were infected with the HPAI H5N1 while working in\nthe poultry farm(s), but that no sick or dead birds were ever discovered or\nreported by the local or national health authorities, such as ICMR. Any\nfurther information for clarification of this issue is welcome. - Mod.RY]\nSee Also\nAvian influenza - Eastern Asia (51): Thailand 20050506.1255\nAvian influenza - Eastern Asia (47): FAO 20050414.1075\nAvian influenza - Eastern Asia (30): Viet Nam, Thailand 20050305.0669\nAvian influenza - Eastern Asia (20): Thailand, Viet Nam 20050212.0481\nAvian influenza - Eastern Asia (07): EU import policy 20050118.0169\n2004\n---\nAvian influenza A (H5N1) virus, drug resistance (02) 20040127.0316\nAvian influenza - Eastern Asia (132): Thailand 20041026.2900\nAvian influenza A (H5N1) virus, human vaccine prospects 20040125.0300\nAvian influenza, Thailand - OIE 20040124.0276\nAvian influenza - Thailand: RFI 20040105.0051\n1998\n---\nInfluenzavirus A H5N1, cohort studies 19981116.2219\nInfluenzavirus A (H5N1): 2 strains - China (Hong Kong) 19980404.0621\nInfluenzavirus A/H5N1, pathogenesis, human 19980318.0517\nInfluenzavirus A (H5N1), risk factors 19980313.0477\nInfluenza H5N1, human - China (Hong Kong): report 19980307.0438\nInfluenza H5N1, human - China(Hong Kong):serosurvey(02)19980224.0364\nInfluenza A/H5N1, clinical findings 19980213.0283\nInfluenza H5N1, new vaccine development - USA 19980205.0225\nInfluenza H5N1, human - China (Hong Kong): serosurvey 19980131.0199\nInfluenza H5N1, avian - China (04) 19980119.0156\nInfluenza H5N1, avian - China (03) 19980118.0142\nInfluenzavirus A (H5N1): sequences analyzed 19980117.0139\nInfluenza H5N1, avian - China (02) 19980116.0130\nInfluenza H5N1, human - China (Hong Kong) (04) 19980115.0113\nInfluenza H5N1, human - China (Hong Kong) (03) 19980115.0112\nInfluenza, H5N1, human - China (Hong Kong) (02)19980113.0101\nInfluenza H5N1, human - China (Hong Kong) 19980110.0081\nInfluenza H5N1, avian - China 19980108.0055\nInfluenzavirus A H5N1: responses 19980107.0049\n1997\n---\nInfluenza, human, H5N1 - China (Hong Kong) (11) 19971208.2449\n..............ry/sh/pg/sh\n\n*##########################################################*\n************************************************************\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.

( see previous\nreport ). A nasopharyngeal aspirate taken from the man tested positive for\ninfluenza A(H5N1) in the Hong Kong SAR Government Virus Unit.\nThe 33-year-old man is the second confirmed case of influenza A(H5N1) virus\nrelated to this outbreak in Hong Kong SAR. The man is known to have been\nthe father of the 9-year-old boy reported as having tested positive for\ninfluenza A(H5N1) yesterday. Both cases had travelled to Fujian Province\n(China) in January 2003, and 2 other members of the family who accompanied\nthe cases to Fujian in January have also been unwell. The mother of the\nfamily has now made a full recovery; the other affected member of the\nfamily (an 8-year-old girl) died on 4 Feb 2003 in Fujian Province. The\nhealth authorities in Hong Kong SAR are continuing laboratory and\nepidemiological investigations to determine the source of infection of this\noutbreak. Further laboratory tests, including gene sequencing, are being\nconducted. The Department of Health in Hong Kong has reported that no\nunusual increase in influenza activity has been detected over the past few\nweeks.\nThe World Health Organization is in close contact with the health\nauthorities in Beijing, China and in Hong Kong, SAR. The WHO Global\nInfluenza Surveillance Network has been alerted, and additional reagents\nfor laboratory diagnosis are being made available to National Influenza\nCentres and other Members of the Global Influenza Surveillance Network.\n******\n[2]\nDate: 20 Feb 2003\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: AP Online 20 Feb 2003 10:28 EST [edited]\n\nBird Flu Death Confirmed in Hong Kong\n----------------------------------------\nA Hong Kong man who died earlier this week had contracted bird flu, health\nofficials confirmed Thursday, in a case that disturbingly echoes a 1997\noutbreak in which the disease first crossed over into humans and killed 6\npeople.\nWhen bird flu hit Hong Kong's populace more than 5 years ago, officials\nkilled all the territory's 1.4 million chickens in an attempt to wipe out\nthe virus.\nHealth Department spokeswoman Eva Wong said the man, whom she did not\nidentify, had been infected with the H5N1 bird flu virus. The hospital that\ntreated him said he died of severe pneumonia.\nThe man's 9-year-old son remained hospitalized Thursday with the same\nstrain of the bird flu. It is a different strain of the disease than the\none that infected humans in 1997.\nThe man's family visited relatives in southeastern China's Fujian province\nin late January 2003. One of his daughters, an 8-year-old, contracted\npneumonia and died 28 Jan 2003 in a Fujian hospital. Officials were\ninvestigating what caused her death.\nThe man, his son, wife, father and another daughter were hospitalized in\nHong Kong after their return. The wife and father were released Thursday,\nbut the other daughter, 10, remains in the hospital.\nWong said officials believed the disease did not originate in Hong Kong,\nbut declined to say whether the family might have caught it in mainland China.\nMainland health authorities so far found that none of the family's\nrelatives or medical staff caring for them in Fujian had shown similar\nsymptoms.\nThe latest case coincided with reports that 12 chickens were found dead at\nmarket stalls in a Hong Kong suburb Wednesday -- one of numerous outbreaks\nof bird flu in recent months. It was, however, unclear whether the birds\nwere infected with the same strain as the boy and his father, whose home is\nin a different area.\nThe cases have prompted speculation that the bird flu might have originated\nin mainland China. Hong Kong returned almost 10 000 chickens to the\nmainland in 2001 and 2002 after tests indicated they might have been\nexposed to the virus. A mainland Chinese official recently insisted the flu\nwas endemic to Hong Kong.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[This newswire confirms a second case of human illness (and first death)\nassociated with an H5N1 infection. In this article there is the additional\nsuggestion that the geographic area of transmission of this infection may\nhave been Fujian, as the entire family had been in Fujian in the immediate\nperiod preceding onset of illness. While it may be too late to obtain\nspecimens from the family member who died while in Fujian, results of\nspecific avian influenza testing from the area in Fujian where the family\nstayed will be of interest and may possibly shed further light on this.

It was, however, unclear whether the birds\nwere infected with the same strain as the boy and his father, whose home is\nin a different area.\nThe cases have prompted speculation that the bird flu might have originated\nin mainland China.

The hospital that\ntreated him said he died of severe pneumonia.\nThe man's 9-year-old son remained hospitalized Thursday with the same\nstrain of the bird flu. It is a different strain of the disease than the\none that infected humans in 1997.\nThe man's family visited relatives in southeastern China's Fujian province\nin late January 2003.

Officials were\ninvestigating what caused her death.\nThe man, his son, wife, father and another daughter were hospitalized in\nHong Kong after their return. The wife and father were released Thursday,\nbut the other daughter, 10, remains in the hospital.\nWong said officials believed the disease did not originate in Hong Kong,\nbut declined to say whether the family might have caught it in mainland China.\nMainland health authorities so far found that none of the family's\nrelatives or medical staff caring for them in Fujian had shown similar\nsymptoms.\nThe latest case coincided with reports that 12 chickens were found dead at\nmarket stalls in a Hong Kong suburb Wednesday -- one of numerous outbreaks\nof bird flu in recent months. It was, however, unclear whether the birds\nwere infected with the same strain as the boy and his father, whose home is\nin a different area.\nThe cases have prompted speculation that the bird flu might have originated\nin mainland China.

It was, however, unclear whether the birds\nwere infected with the same strain as the boy and his father, whose home is\nin a different area.\nThe cases have prompted speculation that the bird flu might have originated\nin mainland China.

No H5N1\nviruses were isolated in other retail markets. No human cases of H5N1 virus\nhave been detected. The strains isolated from the birds differ genetically\nfrom the H5N1 virus, which caused human disease in 1997. There is no cause\nfor public health concern, but as a precautionary measure, the birds at all\n3 retail markets have been destroyed and the markets cleansed and disinfected.\nThe following is the transcript of the English portion of the opening\nremarks made by Mrs Lily Yam, the Secretary for the Environment and Food,\nHong Kong Special Administrative Region of China, at a press briefing held\non Wed 16 May 2001: Precautionary measures taken to prevent spread of\nchicken disease\n\"I have called this press briefing to announce that at 3.30 this afternoon\nthe Director of Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation has issued a notice\ndeclaring the poultry stalls in 3 markets as infected places in accordance\nwith the Public Health (Animals and Birds) Regulations. The 3 markets are\nYeung Luk Road Market in Sheung Wan, Fa Yuen Street Market, and the\nSmithfield Road Market.

The department\nhas also made appropriate arrangements for the destroyed birds to be sent\nright away to a landfill for proper treatment.

From samples we have recently\ncollected from these 3 markets, a few are shown to contain the H5 virus,\nand genes sequencing tests have demonstrated that these viruses are not - I\nrepeat not - the same as the kind of H5N1 chicken virus that we had in Hong\nKong in 1997. Nonetheless, we feel that it is essential for us to take this\nprecautionary measure because there is a need to destroy these viruses\nthoroughly, to prevent their lingering in the market always with the\nprobability, no matter how low the possibility, that they might - they\nmight - combine with other viruses to result in a new strain which may\naffect human beings. I have to reiterate there is no cause for public\nconcern at this stage. This is a precautionary measure. The indication is\nthat there is no evidence that these viruses would affect human beings.

The\nmeasures that we have taken and the tests that we have conducted, and the\nresults, show that in Hong Kong we have one of the best and thorough\nsurveillance systems covering not just imported birds but also the\narrangements in our markets, and the public can rest assured that this\nsurveillance system will enable us to detect any problems as soon as they\narise so that we can take the necessary measures.\"\n******\n[2\nDate: Wed 16 May 2001\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: New York Times Times, Wed 16 May 2001 [edited\n<http://www.nytimes.com/2001/05/16/world/16CND-HONG.html>\n\nHong Kong Orders Slaughter of Chickens to Stop Bird Flu\n-------------------------------------------------------\nHONG KONG: In an echo of its drastic response to a deadly flu virus here in\n1997, Hong Kong today ordered the slaughter of 4700 chickens after public\nhealth officials detected a new strain of so-called bird flu. The officials\nsaid that unlike the previous strain, which killed 6 people, there is no\nevidence that this strain affects human beings. But it has killed 797\nchickens in 3 poultry markets over the last several days, prompting the\ngovernment to take what it called precautionary measures. \"We believe we\nneed to adopt a determined effort to stop the spread of this virus,\" said\nLily Yam, the secretary for environment and food. \"Whether this is a strain\nthat could affect humans, we do not know yet. Nobody can ever be sure of\nanything, particularly where viruses are concerned.\"\nIn late 1997, Hong Kong killed every chicken in the territory about 1.2\nmillion birds in an effort to stamp out a strain of [avian influenza\nvirus. The grisly campaign drew unwelcome attention to Hong Kong 6 months\nafter its return to Chinese sovereignty, but succeeded in containing the\nvirus. Hong Kong has inspected poultry markets since then for signs of a\nrecurrence of the virus, known as H5N1. [The designation H5N1 refers to the\nantigenic type of the (H)aemagglutinin and (N)euraminidase proteins of the\nvirus. - Mod.CP. In April, officials found an H5N1 virus similar to the\ncurrent strain. But until this week, they had not found a strain that\nkilled birds, as the 1997 influenza virus did. \"We have birds dying, which\nmakes this different,\" said Leslie D. Sims, an assistant director of the\nagriculture department. Dr. Sims said the influenza was highly virulent,\nkilling virtually all the infected chickens within days. But he added,\n\"Just because it causes death in birds does not mean it causes death in\nhumans.\"\nOfficials said people could continue to buy and eat chickens from Hong\nKong's poultry stalls, except for the 3 infected markets, which were shut\ndown this afternoon. But they acknowledged there was no guarantee that the\nstrain could not be transmitted to humans by other means. \"Up to the\npresent moment, we have had no human cases,\" said Saw Thian-aun, the deputy\ndirector of health. \"But we recognize there is a possibility it could\naffect humans. We learned a bitter lesson in 1997.\" In that outbreak, the\nfirst known case of avian flu was detected in May 1997 in a young boy, who\nsoon died. But health and agriculture officials did not devise a concerted\nresponse to the virus until December, by which time it had spread to farms\nand markets throughout Hong Kong.\nThe bird flu scared away tourists and devastated poultry farmers. Coming on\nthe heels of Asia's economic collapse, it symbolized Hong Kong's painful\npassage from British colony to Chinese possession. Today's action seemed\ndesigned to eradicate the new strain at a much earlier stage. Within an\nhour of the announcement, health officials fanned out to the 3 markets,\nyanking chickens out of cages and slaughtering them. The carcasses were\nstuffed into plastic bags and dumped in a landfill site. Ms. Yam said the\nmarkets, which are in different parts of Hong Kong, would be closed for 3\nweeks. She said the government had not traced the source of the virus. Hong\nKong imports poultry from neighboring Guangdong Province, but also breeds\nchickens on farms in the New Territories. Ms. Yam said Hong Kong had\nalerted health officials in Guangdong to look for signs of the virus in the\nChinese mainland.\n[Byline: Mark Landler\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n......................cp/mpp/pg/es\n*##########################################################*\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.

Nobody can ever be sure of\nanything, particularly where viruses are concerned.\"\nIn late 1997, Hong Kong killed every chicken in the territory about 1.2\nmillion birds in an effort to stamp out a strain of [avian influenza\nvirus. The grisly campaign drew unwelcome attention to Hong Kong 6 months\nafter its return to Chinese sovereignty, but succeeded in containing the\nvirus. Hong Kong has inspected poultry markets since then for signs of a\nrecurrence of the virus, known as H5N1. [The designation H5N1 refers to the\nantigenic type of the (H)aemagglutinin and (N)euraminidase proteins of the\nvirus. - Mod.CP. In April, officials found an H5N1 virus similar to the\ncurrent strain. But until this week, they had not found a strain that\nkilled birds, as the 1997 influenza virus did. \"We have birds dying, which\nmakes this different,\" said Leslie D. Sims, an assistant director of the\nagriculture department. Dr. Sims said the influenza was highly virulent,\nkilling virtually all the infected chickens within days. But he added,\n\"Just because it causes death in birds does not mean it causes death in\nhumans.\"\nOfficials said people could continue to buy and eat chickens from Hong\nKong's poultry stalls, except for the 3 infected markets, which were shut\ndown this afternoon. But they acknowledged there was no guarantee that the\nstrain could not be transmitted to humans by other means. \"Up to the\npresent moment, we have had no human cases,\" said Saw Thian-aun, the deputy\ndirector of health. \"But we recognize there is a possibility it could\naffect humans. We learned a bitter lesson in 1997.\" In that outbreak, the\nfirst known case of avian flu was detected in May 1997 in a young boy, who\nsoon died. But health and agriculture officials did not devise a concerted\nresponse to the virus until December, by which time it had spread to farms\nand markets throughout Hong Kong.\nThe bird flu scared away tourists and devastated poultry farmers. Coming on\nthe heels of Asia's economic collapse, it symbolized Hong Kong's painful\npassage from British colony to Chinese possession. Today's action seemed\ndesigned to eradicate the new strain at a much earlier stage. Within an\nhour of the announcement, health officials fanned out to the 3 markets,\nyanking chickens out of cages and slaughtering them. The carcasses were\nstuffed into plastic bags and dumped in a landfill site. Ms. Yam said the\nmarkets, which are in different parts of Hong Kong, would be closed for 3\nweeks. She said the government had not traced the source of the virus. Hong\nKong imports poultry from neighboring Guangdong Province, but also breeds\nchickens on farms in the New Territories. Ms. Yam said Hong Kong had\nalerted health officials in Guangdong to look for signs of the virus in the\nChinese mainland.\n[Byline: Mark Landler\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n......................cp/mpp/pg/es\n*##########################################################*\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.

No H5N1\nviruses were isolated in other retail markets. No human cases of H5N1 virus\nhave been detected. The strains isolated from the birds differ genetically\nfrom the H5N1 virus, which caused human disease in 1997. There is no cause\nfor public health concern, but as a precautionary measure, the birds at all\n3 retail markets have been destroyed and the markets cleansed and disinfected.\nThe following is the transcript of the English portion of the opening\nremarks made by Mrs Lily Yam, the Secretary for the Environment and Food,\nHong Kong Special Administrative Region of China, at a press briefing held\non Wed 16 May 2001: Precautionary measures taken to prevent spread of\nchicken disease\n\"I have called this press briefing to announce that at 3.30 this afternoon\nthe Director of Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation has issued a notice\ndeclaring the poultry stalls in 3 markets as infected places in accordance\nwith the Public Health (Animals and Birds) Regulations. The 3 markets are\nYeung Luk Road Market in Sheung Wan, Fa Yuen Street Market, and the\nSmithfield Road Market. The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department has\nalready started action to close these poultry stalls and the department has\nrequested all poultry stall-holders to destroy the live birds in their\nstalls, and these stall-holders will be given every assistance and advice\nby members of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department. The department\nhas also made appropriate arrangements for the destroyed birds to be sent\nright away to a landfill for proper treatment. After all the birds have\nbeen destroyed, the poultry stalls in the markets will be thoroughly\ncleansed and disinfected. We have taken this precautionary measure for 2\nreasons. The first is that since yesterday, in Yeung Luk Road Market, 763\nchickens have died. There are also a number of chicken deaths in the other\n2 markets. Tests by the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department\nhave demonstrated that these chickens have died of avian influenza. I have\nto emphasize that there are many strains of H5N1 and according to the\ninformation currently available, only the H5N1 chicken strain that we had\nin Hong Kong in 1997 would affect human beings, and the vast majority of\nH5N1 strains will not affect human beings. From samples we have recently\ncollected from these 3 markets, a few are shown to contain the H5 virus,\nand genes sequencing tests have demonstrated that these viruses are not - I\nrepeat not - the same as the kind of H5N1 chicken virus that we had in Hong\nKong in 1997. Nonetheless, we feel that it is essential for us to take this\nprecautionary measure because there is a need to destroy these viruses\nthoroughly, to prevent their lingering in the market always with the\nprobability, no matter how low the possibility, that they might - they\nmight - combine with other viruses to result in a new strain which may\naffect human beings. I have to reiterate there is no cause for public\nconcern at this stage. This is a precautionary measure. The indication is\nthat there is no evidence that these viruses would affect human beings. Of\ncourse, the public is reminded to observe the usual hygiene standards. The\nmeasures that we have taken and the tests that we have conducted, and the\nresults, show that in Hong Kong we have one of the best and thorough\nsurveillance systems covering not just imported birds but also the\narrangements in our markets, and the public can rest assured that this\nsurveillance system will enable us to detect any problems as soon as they\narise so that we can take the necessary measures.\"\n******\n[2\nDate: Wed 16 May 2001\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: New York Times Times, Wed 16 May 2001 [edited\n<http://www.nytimes.com/2001/05/16/world/16CND-HONG.html>\n\nHong Kong Orders Slaughter of Chickens to Stop Bird Flu\n-------------------------------------------------------\nHONG KONG: In an echo of its drastic response to a deadly flu virus here in\n1997, Hong Kong today ordered the slaughter of 4700 chickens after public\nhealth officials detected a new strain of so-called bird flu.

No H5N1\nviruses were isolated in other retail markets. No human cases of H5N1 virus\nhave been detected. The strains isolated from the birds differ genetically\nfrom the H5N1 virus, which caused human disease in 1997.

The 3 markets are\nYeung Luk Road Market in Sheung Wan, Fa Yuen Street Market, and the\nSmithfield Road Market. The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department has\nalready started action to close these poultry stalls and the department has\nrequested all poultry stall-holders to destroy the live birds in their\nstalls, and these stall-holders will be given every assistance and advice\nby members of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department. The department\nhas also made appropriate arrangements for the destroyed birds to be sent\nright away to a landfill for proper treatment. After all the birds have\nbeen destroyed, the poultry stalls in the markets will be thoroughly\ncleansed and disinfected. We have taken this precautionary measure for 2\nreasons. The first is that since yesterday, in Yeung Luk Road Market, 763\nchickens have died. There are also a number of chicken deaths in the other\n2 markets. Tests by the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department\nhave demonstrated that these chickens have died of avian influenza. I have\nto emphasize that there are many strains of H5N1 and according to the\ninformation currently available, only the H5N1 chicken strain that we had\nin Hong Kong in 1997 would affect human beings, and the vast majority of\nH5N1 strains will not affect human beings. From samples we have recently\ncollected from these 3 markets, a few are shown to contain the H5 virus,\nand genes sequencing tests have demonstrated that these viruses are not - I\nrepeat not - the same as the kind of H5N1 chicken virus that we had in Hong\nKong in 1997. Nonetheless, we feel that it is essential for us to take this\nprecautionary measure because there is a need to destroy these viruses\nthoroughly, to prevent their lingering in the market always with the\nprobability, no matter how low the possibility, that they might - they\nmight - combine with other viruses to result in a new strain which may\naffect human beings. I have to reiterate there is no cause for public\nconcern at this stage. This is a precautionary measure. The indication is\nthat there is no evidence that these viruses would affect human beings. Of\ncourse, the public is reminded to observe the usual hygiene standards. The\nmeasures that we have taken and the tests that we have conducted, and the\nresults, show that in Hong Kong we have one of the best and thorough\nsurveillance systems covering not just imported birds but also the\narrangements in our markets, and the public can rest assured that this\nsurveillance system will enable us to detect any problems as soon as they\narise so that we can take the necessary measures.\"\n******\n[2\nDate: Wed 16 May 2001\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: New York Times Times, Wed 16 May 2001 [edited\n<http://www.nytimes.com/2001/05/16/world/16CND-HONG.html>\n\nHong Kong Orders Slaughter of Chickens to Stop Bird Flu\n-------------------------------------------------------\nHONG KONG: In an echo of its drastic response to a deadly flu virus here in\n1997, Hong Kong today ordered the slaughter of 4700 chickens after public\nhealth officials detected a new strain of so-called bird flu. The officials\nsaid that unlike the previous strain, which killed 6 people, there is no\nevidence that this strain affects human beings. But it has killed 797\nchickens in 3 poultry markets over the last several days, prompting the\ngovernment to take what it called precautionary measures. \"We believe we\nneed to adopt a determined effort to stop the spread of this virus,\" said\nLily Yam, the secretary for environment and food. \"Whether this is a strain\nthat could affect humans, we do not know yet. Nobody can ever be sure of\nanything, particularly where viruses are concerned.\"\nIn late 1997, Hong Kong killed every chicken in the territory about 1.2\nmillion birds in an effort to stamp out a strain of [avian influenza\nvirus. The grisly campaign drew unwelcome attention to Hong Kong 6 months\nafter its return to Chinese sovereignty, but succeeded in containing the\nvirus. Hong Kong has inspected poultry markets since then for signs of a\nrecurrence of the virus, known as H5N1. [The designation H5N1 refers to the\nantigenic type of the (H)aemagglutinin and (N)euraminidase proteins of the\nvirus. - Mod.CP. In April, officials found an H5N1 virus similar to the\ncurrent strain. But until this week, they had not found a strain that\nkilled birds, as the 1997 influenza virus did. \"We have birds dying, which\nmakes this different,\" said Leslie D. Sims, an assistant director of the\nagriculture department. Dr. Sims said the influenza was highly virulent,\nkilling virtually all the infected chickens within days. But he added,\n\"Just because it causes death in birds does not mean it causes death in\nhumans.\"\nOfficials said people could continue to buy and eat chickens from Hong\nKong's poultry stalls, except for the 3 infected markets, which were shut\ndown this afternoon. But they acknowledged there was no guarantee that the\nstrain could not be transmitted to humans by other means. \"Up to the\npresent moment, we have had no human cases,\" said Saw Thian-aun, the deputy\ndirector of health. \"But we recognize there is a possibility it could\naffect humans. We learned a bitter lesson in 1997.\" In that outbreak, the\nfirst known case of avian flu was detected in May 1997 in a young boy, who\nsoon died. But health and agriculture officials did not devise a concerted\nresponse to the virus until December, by which time it had spread to farms\nand markets throughout Hong Kong.\nThe bird flu scared away tourists and devastated poultry farmers. Coming on\nthe heels of Asia's economic collapse, it symbolized Hong Kong's painful\npassage from British colony to Chinese possession. Today's action seemed\ndesigned to eradicate the new strain at a much earlier stage. Within an\nhour of the announcement, health officials fanned out to the 3 markets,\nyanking chickens out of cages and slaughtering them. The carcasses were\nstuffed into plastic bags and dumped in a landfill site. Ms. Yam said the\nmarkets, which are in different parts of Hong Kong, would be closed for 3\nweeks.

No H5N1\nviruses were isolated in other retail markets. No human cases of H5N1 virus\nhave been detected. The strains isolated from the birds differ genetically\nfrom the H5N1 virus, which caused human disease in 1997. There is no cause\nfor public health concern, but as a precautionary measure, the birds at all\n3 retail markets have been destroyed and the markets cleansed and disinfected.\nThe following is the transcript of the English portion of the opening\nremarks made by Mrs Lily Yam, the Secretary for the Environment and Food,\nHong Kong Special Administrative Region of China, at a press briefing held\non Wed 16 May 2001: Precautionary measures taken to prevent spread of\nchicken disease\n\"I have called this press briefing to announce that at 3.30 this afternoon\nthe Director of Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation has issued a notice\ndeclaring the poultry stalls in 3 markets as infected places in accordance\nwith the Public Health (Animals and Birds) Regulations. The 3 markets are\nYeung Luk Road Market in Sheung Wan, Fa Yuen Street Market, and the\nSmithfield Road Market. The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department has\nalready started action to close these poultry stalls and the department has\nrequested all poultry stall-holders to destroy the live birds in their\nstalls, and these stall-holders will be given every assistance and advice\nby members of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department. The department\nhas also made appropriate arrangements for the destroyed birds to be sent\nright away to a landfill for proper treatment. After all the birds have\nbeen destroyed, the poultry stalls in the markets will be thoroughly\ncleansed and disinfected. We have taken this precautionary measure for 2\nreasons. The first is that since yesterday, in Yeung Luk Road Market, 763\nchickens have died. There are also a number of chicken deaths in the other\n2 markets. Tests by the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department\nhave demonstrated that these chickens have died of avian influenza. I have\nto emphasize that there are many strains of H5N1 and according to the\ninformation currently available, only the H5N1 chicken strain that we had\nin Hong Kong in 1997 would affect human beings, and the vast majority of\nH5N1 strains will not affect human beings. From samples we have recently\ncollected from these 3 markets, a few are shown to contain the H5 virus,\nand genes sequencing tests have demonstrated that these viruses are not - I\nrepeat not - the same as the kind of H5N1 chicken virus that we had in Hong\nKong in 1997. Nonetheless, we feel that it is essential for us to take this\nprecautionary measure because there is a need to destroy these viruses\nthoroughly, to prevent their lingering in the market always with the\nprobability, no matter how low the possibility, that they might - they\nmight - combine with other viruses to result in a new strain which may\naffect human beings. I have to reiterate there is no cause for public\nconcern at this stage. This is a precautionary measure. The indication is\nthat there is no evidence that these viruses would affect human beings. Of\ncourse, the public is reminded to observe the usual hygiene standards. The\nmeasures that we have taken and the tests that we have conducted, and the\nresults, show that in Hong Kong we have one of the best and thorough\nsurveillance systems covering not just imported birds but also the\narrangements in our markets, and the public can rest assured that this\nsurveillance system will enable us to detect any problems as soon as they\narise so that we can take the necessary measures.\"\n******\n[2\nDate: Wed 16 May 2001\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: New York Times Times, Wed 16 May 2001 [edited\n<http://www.nytimes.com/2001/05/16/world/16CND-HONG.html>\n\nHong Kong Orders Slaughter of Chickens to Stop Bird Flu\n-------------------------------------------------------\nHONG KONG: In an echo of its drastic response to a deadly flu virus here in\n1997, Hong Kong today ordered the slaughter of 4700 chickens after public\nhealth officials detected a new strain of so-called bird flu. The officials\nsaid that unlike the previous strain, which killed 6 people, there is no\nevidence that this strain affects human beings. But it has killed 797\nchickens in 3 poultry markets over the last several days, prompting the\ngovernment to take what it called precautionary measures. \"We believe we\nneed to adopt a determined effort to stop the spread of this virus,\" said\nLily Yam, the secretary for environment and food. \"Whether this is a strain\nthat could affect humans, we do not know yet. Nobody can ever be sure of\nanything, particularly where viruses are concerned.\"\nIn late 1997, Hong Kong killed every chicken in the territory about 1.2\nmillion birds in an effort to stamp out a strain of [avian influenza\nvirus. The grisly campaign drew unwelcome attention to Hong Kong 6 months\nafter its return to Chinese sovereignty, but succeeded in containing the\nvirus. Hong Kong has inspected poultry markets since then for signs of a\nrecurrence of the virus, known as H5N1. [The designation H5N1 refers to the\nantigenic type of the (H)aemagglutinin and (N)euraminidase proteins of the\nvirus. - Mod.CP. In April, officials found an H5N1 virus similar to the\ncurrent strain. But until this week, they had not found a strain that\nkilled birds, as the 1997 influenza virus did. \"We have birds dying, which\nmakes this different,\" said Leslie D. Sims, an assistant director of the\nagriculture department. Dr. Sims said the influenza was highly virulent,\nkilling virtually all the infected chickens within days. But he added,\n\"Just because it causes death in birds does not mean it causes death in\nhumans.\"\nOfficials said people could continue to buy and eat chickens from Hong\nKong's poultry stalls, except for the 3 infected markets, which were shut\ndown this afternoon. But they acknowledged there was no guarantee that the\nstrain could not be transmitted to humans by other means. \"Up to the\npresent moment, we have had no human cases,\" said Saw Thian-aun, the deputy\ndirector of health. \"But we recognize there is a possibility it could\naffect humans. We learned a bitter lesson in 1997.\" In that outbreak, the\nfirst known case of avian flu was detected in May 1997 in a young boy, who\nsoon died. But health and agriculture officials did not devise a concerted\nresponse to the virus until December, by which time it had spread to farms\nand markets throughout Hong Kong.\nThe bird flu scared away tourists and devastated poultry farmers. Coming on\nthe heels of Asia's economic collapse, it symbolized Hong Kong's painful\npassage from British colony to Chinese possession. Today's action seemed\ndesigned to eradicate the new strain at a much earlier stage. Within an\nhour of the announcement, health officials fanned out to the 3 markets,\nyanking chickens out of cages and slaughtering them. The carcasses were\nstuffed into plastic bags and dumped in a landfill site. Ms. Yam said the\nmarkets, which are in different parts of Hong Kong, would be closed for 3\nweeks. She said the government had not traced the source of the virus. Hong\nKong imports poultry from neighboring Guangdong Province, but also breeds\nchickens on farms in the New Territories. Ms. Yam said Hong Kong had\nalerted health officials in Guangdong to look for signs of the virus in the\nChinese mainland.\n[Byline: Mark Landler\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n......................cp/mpp/pg/es\n*##########################################################*\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.
