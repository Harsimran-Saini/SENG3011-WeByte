This 2020/21 epizootic is marked by the significant involvement and mortality of wild birds. As the risk of virus introductions via migratory wild birds remains high, countries should stay vigilant, and implement effective surveillance and monitoring measures for early detection and response.\n\n'What are the causes of the current wave of avian influenza cases and is it worse than in previous years?\n'Molecular characterization of the currently circulating AI virus subtypes shows genetic variability from previous years. This might be explained by multiple reassortments with low pathogenic viruses circulating in wild birds. The evolution of the viruses and these recent events need to be closely monitored and further studied in order to assess the risks.\n\n'It is most likely that migratory wild birds, followed by local farming practices, have contributed to the dissemination and introduction of the virus into new countries and farms. A similar situation of H5N8 epizootics in many countries associated with wild bird migration occurred in 2016/17.\n\n'The H5N8 virus has also reassorted with other wild bird influenza viruses to form new subtypes, which were also reported by countries.\n\n'What factors can facilitate the spread of avian influenza?\n'The dynamic of the spread of influenza viruses is extremely complex and difficult to predict. Several factors can influence it, such as the wild bird migration pattern, unregulated trade, farming systems, biosecurity and immunity status.\n\n'During the Northern Hemisphere winter, the wild bird movements may increase, and lower temperatures may facilitate the environmental survival of AI viruses, increasing exposure of infection in poultry. Additionally, the mixing of wild birds from different geographic origins during migration can increase the risk of virus spread and genetic reassortment resulting in changes in viral properties.\n\n'At [a] local level, as the AI viruses can survive for long periods in the environment, they can be easily transmitted from farm to farm by the movement of infected animals, as well as contaminated boots, vehicles and equipment if the adequate biosecurity measures are not implemented.\n\n'What is the risk of avian influenza for human health?\n'The epidemiology of AI viruses is complex: They can change and evolve by mutation and reassortment, with the emergence of new subtypes causing significant impacts on animal health and production. Some subtypes -- not all -- can be zoonotic and therefore pose a threat to human health.\n\n'Transmission of AI viruses to humans occurs when there is close contact with infected birds or heavily contaminated environments.\n\n'In February 2021, human cases of AI subtype H5N8 were reported by Russian authorities to the World Health Organization (WHO). The OIE/FAO network of experts on animal influenza (OFFLU) analyzed the preliminary information of the event and stated that, to date, there is no evidence to suggest that severe human infections or human-to-human transmission of this virus have occurred. This situation likely represents an isolated spillover event of the virus, as genetic evidence suggests that these viruses were derived from chickens with no adaptation to humans.\n\n'More information is available on the OFFLU statement (February 2021) at http://www.offlu.net/fileadmin/home/en/publications/pdf/OFFLU_Russia_H5N8_final.pdf.' - Mod.CRD]", "summary": "Recurrence of a listed disease\nDate of previous occurrence: 19 Nov 2020\nManifestation of disease: Clinical disease\nCausal agent: Highly pathogenic avian influenza virus\n A ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n Measures applied: Movement control inside the country; surveillance outside containment and/or protection zone; surveillance within containment and/or protection zone; zoning; stamping out; official destruction of animal products; official disposal of carcasses, by-products, and waste; disinfection\n\nDiagnostic test results\nLaboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result\nNational Veterinary Institute (national laboratory) / Measures applied: Surveillance outside containment and/or protection zone; surveillance within containment and/or protection zone; traceability; zoning; official disposal of carcasses, by-products, and waste; disinfection\nMeasures to be applied: Stamping out; control of wildlife reservoirs\n\nDiagnostic test results\nLaboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Information received on 5 Mar 2021 from Ali Seidou, OIE Focal Point for animal disease reporting, Niger\n\nSummary\nReport type: Immediate notification\n \nInformation received on 5 Mar 2021 from Dr. Emeli Torsson, Senior Veterinary Advisor, Sweden\n\nSummary\nReport type: \nAffected population: Hens (Brahma breed) in a backyard\n\nOutbreak location 2: Niamey Saguia [Niamey]\n Source: OIE, Disease Alerts, 2021 [edited]\nhttps://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Animal_Health_in_the_World/docs/pdf/CUTOVER_OIE-WAHIS/SWEDEN_HPAI_149037_05032021.pdf\n\n\nHighly pathogenic avian influenza, Sweden\n Source: OIE, Disease Alerts, 2021 [edited]\nhttps://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Animal_Health_in_the_World/docs/pdf/CUTOVER_OIE-WAHIS/NIGER_HPAI_05032021.pdf\n\n\nHighly pathogenic avian influenza, Niger\n Immediate notification\nDate of start of the event: 2 Mar 2021\n Manifestation of disease: Clinical disease\nCausal agent: Highly pathogenic avian influenza virus\n AVIAN INFLUENZA (41): SWEDEN (SKANE), NIGER (NIAMEY) POULTRY, HPAI H5N5, H5N1, OIE\n**********************************************************************************\n Total outbreaks: 2\nOutbreak location 1: Niamey Karadje [Niamey]\n Recurrence of a listed disease\nDate of previous occurrence: 20 Sep 2017\n Total outbreaks: 1\nOutbreak location: Trelleborg [Skane County]\n Total animals affected:\nSpecies / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered\n Total animals affected:\nSpecies / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered\n Total animals affected:\nSpecies / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered\n Serotype: H5N1\nNature of diagnosis: Clinical, laboratory (basic and advanced)\n promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[HealthMap/ProMED map of Niamey, Niger: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/15122\n\nThe following has been extracted from the OIE Technical factsheet 'Questions and Answers on Avian Influenza' (last updated 1 Mar 2021); subscribers are encouraged to visit the full text at https://www.oie.int/en/animal-health-in-the-world/update-on-avian-influenza/questions-and-answers-on-avian-influenza/.\n\n'What is the current situation of avian influenza?

HPAI subtype H5N1 is endemic in some countries of the African continent.\n\nThe following information comes from a scientific article titled 'Evolution of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza A(H5N1) Virus in Poultry, Togo, 2018,' published December 2019 in the Emerging Infectious Diseases journal by the CDC:\n\n'In 2015, highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) viruses reemerged in poultry in West Africa. We describe the introduction of a reassortant clade 2.3.2.1c virus into Togo in April 2018. Our findings signal further local spread and evolution of these viruses, which could affect animal and human health.\n\n'Relatively little is known about the emergence, prevalence, and circulation of animal influenza viruses in Africa. Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 clade 2.2 viruses emerged in Africa in 2006 (cases were reported from Egypt, Nigeria, Cote d'Ivoire, Benin, Togo, Ghana, Sudan, Djibouti, and Cameroon), although the virus was only maintained long term in Egypt. We conducted surveillance in domestic poultry in Cote d'Ivoire, Benin, and Togo during 2008-2010 but were unable to find virologic or serologic evidence for influenza A virus circulation. Several factors, such as type of hosts, climate, and animal density, might have provided unfavorable conditions for the virus' circulation in the region.\n\n'In early 2015, HPAI H5N1 viruses of clade 2.3.2.1c were reported in Nigeria, followed closely by detections in Burkina Faso, Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana, Niger, Cameroon, and Togo. These viruses could be clustered into 2 genetic subgroups; cluster WA1 viruses were detected in Ghana, Burkina Faso, Cote d'Ivoire, Nigeria, and Niger, and cluster WA2 viruses were detected in Niger, Cote d'Ivoire, and Nigeria.

This study describes the spatio\u2010temporal distribution of HPAI\u2010H5N1 outbreaks in Vietnam for the period December 2014-April 2018 using the space\u2010time K\u2010function and the space\u2010time scan statistic. The space\u2010time K\u2010function analyses showed statistically significant spatio\u2010temporal clustering of HPAI\u2010H5N1 outbreaks in poultry during the study period of up to 50 days and 60 km (approx. 37mi). The space\u2010time scan statistic test identified 3 statistically significant space\u2010time clusters of HPAI\u2010H5N1 in the south of the country where the incidence of HPAI\u2010H5N1 outbreaks was greater than that expected if outbreaks were randomly distributed in space and time. The analyses indicated shortfalls in the effectiveness of control measures used to control HPAI\u2010H5N1 throughout the study period. Development of a better understanding of the relative impact of HPAI\u2010H5N1 control measures (depopulation of infected flocks, vaccination, movement restrictions) on space\u2010time interaction would allow animal health authorities to focus their efforts on control measures shown to have the greatest relative effect'.\n\nReference: Transboundary and Emerging disease, special issue article, 'Spatio\u2010temporal distribution of outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus subtype H5N1 in Vietnam, 2015- 2018' Loth L, Pham LT and Stevenson MA, https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/tbed.13259 (published 10 Jun 2019).\n- Mod.CRD\n\nHealthMap/ProMED map:\nTr\u00e0 Vinh Province, Vietnam: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/1042]", "summary": "Measures applied: vaccination permitted (if a vaccine exists); no treatment of affected animals\nMeasures to be applied: surveillance outside containment and/or protection zone; surveillance within containment and/or protection zone; stamping out; disinfection\n\nDiagnostic test results\nLaboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result\n A ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n Date of previous occurrence: 6 Jun 2020\nManifestation of disease: clinical disease\nCausal agent: highly pathogenic avian influenza virus\n Epidemiological unit: village\nTotal animals affected:\nSpecies / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered\n Birds / 1040 / 500 / 200 / 840 / 0\n\nOutbreak statistics [rates apparent, expressed as percentages]\nSpecies / Morbidity rate / Mortality rate / Case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*\n Information received on 7 Aug 2020 from Dr. Dong Pham Van, director general, chief veterinary officer, Department of Animal Health, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, Hanoi, Viet Nam\n\nSummary\nReport type: immediate notification\n Date of confirmation of the event: 25 Jul 2020\nReason for notification: recurrence of a listed disease\n Total outbreaks: 1\nOutbreak location 1: Chau Dien, Chau Dien, Cau Ke, Tra Vinh\n AVIAN INFLUENZA (53): VIET NAM (TRA VINH) BACKYARD, HPAI H5N1, OIE\n******************************************************************\n Serotype: H5N1\nNature of diagnosis: laboratory (advanced)\n Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n< Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive\n\nControl measures\n Abstract:\n\n'Despite strong commitments of the central and provincial veterinary authorities in Vietnam to control highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 (HPAI\u2010H5N1) in poultry and to diminish the risk of human infection, outbreaks continue to occur in poultry. \n\nNew outbreaks (1)\n", "reports": [{"diseases": ["unknown"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["1997-03-24 00:00:00", "2053-03-24 00:00:00", "2020-03-24 00:00:00", "2020-08-07 00:00:00", "2019-06-10 00:00:00", "2003-03-24 00:00:00", "2020-06-06 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Hong Kong", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Viet Nam", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Vietnam", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "WAHID", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Hanoi", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Viet Nam \n\n Summary", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "7988670", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Avian influenza (102): Europe, wild bird, poultry, H5N8, H5N5, H5N1, spread", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=7988670", "date": "2020-12-02 19:58:44", "main_text": "AVIAN INFLUENZA (102): EUROPE, WILD BIRD, POULTRY, H5N8, H5N5, H5N1, SPREAD, OVERVIEW\n*************************************************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Wed 2 Dec 2020\nSource: Animal & Plant Health Agency (APHA), UK [abridged, edited]\nhttps://science.vla.gov.uk/flu-lab-net/docs/H5_SituationReport_021120.pdf\n\n\nSummary of highly pathogenic avian influenza H5 activity in Europe: 27 Oct - 28 Nov 2020\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nA total of 582 detections of HPAI H5 have been reported in Europe between 27 Oct 2020 and 28 Nov 2020. This new H5N8 2.3.4.4b clade variant was originally detected in poultry in Iraq in May 2020 with subsequent detections in Russia and Kazakhstan. It seems likely that migratory waterfowl played a key role in the incursion of this virus into Europe with over 500 detections in wild birds and spillover events into commercial poultry and captive birds.\n\nThis situation report provides an overview of the virological, epidemiological, and ornithological characteristics of this new epizootic, which involves H5N8, H5N5 and H5N1 subtypes suggesting local reassortment with wild bird Eurasian avian LPAI genes. We describe the geographical distribution and the variety of avian hosts demonstrating susceptibility to this emerging virus.\n\nThe 582 detections of HPAI H5 comprise 35 detections in poultry (6%), 8 in captive birds (1%) and 539 wild bird events (93%). Previous epizootics in Europe have had varied clinical and epidemiological presentations; the 2016/17 H5N8 epizootic affected both wild birds and poultry with over 2800 events recorded between October 2016 and July 2017. The H5N6 epizootic in 2017/18 primarily affected wild birds (80 events) with only 7 events in poultry and captive flocks.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nAdam Brouwer\nAnimal and Plant Health Agency - OIE/FAO International Reference Laboratory for Avian Influenza\nAPHA-Weybridge, UK\n<adam.brouwer@apha.gov.uk>\n\n[The authors of the above useful APHA situation report are Adam Brouwer, Nicola Lewis, Elliot Whittard, David Stroud, Ashley Banyard, Rowena Hansen, and Ian Brown. We are indebted to the submitter and his peers.\n\nThe following section, excerpted from the above-cited report, deserves inclusion:\n\nH5 HPAI (2.3.4.4b of putative African origin for some gene segments) was present in European poultry from 2 Jan 2020 to the last detection on 4 Jun 2020, with H5N8 detected in Eastern Europe with extensive spread within poultry in Hungary (276 events) and Poland (35 events).\n\nThere were 6 detections in wild birds of a closely related virus to the poultry-associated H5N8 between Jan and Mar 2020 suggesting a relatively low incidence in wild birds.\n\nIraq reported H5N8 in poultry in May 2020 with a new H5N8 2.3.4.4b clade variant genetically distinct from the previous 2020 strains in Europe. Genetically similar H5N8 viruses were subsequently detected in southern central Russia, northern Kazakhstan and south-western Russia. In western Europe, HPAI H5 in wild birds was suspected when there was an initial detection in Eurasian wigeons in the Netherlands on 16 Oct 2020 with disease confirmed on 27 Oct with one bird positive for H5N8 and 4 positive for H5N1. The H5N8 virus was similar to that reported in Russia, Kazakhstan and Iraq whilst the H5N1 characterisation suggested local reassortment with wild bird Eurasian avian LPAI genes. Detections in poultry followed with initial H5N8 cases in the Netherlands and the UK submitted to national reference laboratories on 28 Oct and 2 Nov 2020, respectively. Subsequently there has been a substantial increase in cases (principally H5N8) in wild birds particularly in northern Europe and spillover events to commercial poultry and captive birds involving reports from 14 European countries to date [28 Nov 2020].\n\nNearly all detections of HPAI H5 in wild birds have been found close to coastlines with significant clusters of cases in the Jutland peninsula and within the extensive Wadden Sea -- a continuous intertidal wetland stretching from Denmark to the Netherlands and where many of the Danish, German and Dutch cases occurred. However, wild bird cases also occurred in inland areas in those and other countries, with a 2nd cluster of wild bird detections in the Netherlands.\n\nThe lack of detections in other countries in Northern Europe does not imply that HPAIv is absent -- rather that a combination of varied disease prevalence and the sensitivity of wild bird surveillance programmes has inhibited detection thus far.\n\n---\nThe report includes a table presenting details of the 582 reported HPAI H5 disease events in Europe, 27 Oct - 28 Nov 2020, for the 14 addressed European countries. - Mod.AS\n\nHealthMap/ProMED-mail map:\nEurope: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/6010]", "summary": "\n\nThe following section, excerpted from the above-cited report, deserves inclusion:\n\nH5 HPAI (2.3.4.4b of putative African origin for some gene segments) was present in European poultry from 2 Jan 2020 to the last detection on 4 Jun 2020, with H5N8 detected in Eastern Europe with extensive spread within poultry in Hungary (276 events) and Poland (35 events). \n\nThere were 6 detections in wild birds of a closely related virus to the poultry-associated H5N8 between Jan and Mar 2020 suggesting a relatively low incidence in wild birds.

The main wild species involved have proved to be waterfowls, gulls, and shorebirds, however the virus seem to pass easily between different bird species.\n\nThe incidence of infection appears to be seasonal, with the highest isolation rate being in juvenile birds in the fall of the year.\n\nSeveral routes of exposure of wild bird viruses to poultry have been documented or suspected of being the origins of outbreaks. Direct exposure to wild birds is the most likely transmission factor.\n\nTherefore, limiting exposure of poultry to wild birds through confinement rearing and other biosecurity measures provides an opportunity to reduce the risk of introduction of avian influenza virus from wild birds, and consequently is key to decrease the risk of evolution into highly pathogenic forms, exposure and infection of humans, and recombination with human viruses components to form viruses that can not only infect humans but readily transmit among humans.'\nSource: OIE Avian Influenza Portal https://www.oie.int/en/animal-health-in-the-world/avian-influenza-portal/what-is-avian-influenza. - Mod.CRD\n\nHealthMap/ProMED map of India: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/142]", "summary": "Total outbreaks: 4\nTotal animals affected:\nSpecies / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered\nHouse crow: _Corvus splendens_ (Corvidae) / - / 50 / 50 / - / -\nRed headed trogon: _Harpactes erythrocephalus_ (Trogonidae) / - / 7 / 7 / - / -\n\nOutbreak statistics [rates apparent, expressed as percentages]\nSpecies / Morbidity rate / Mortality rate / Case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*\nHouse crow: _Corvus splendens_ (Corvidae) / ** / ** / 100 / **\nRed headed trogon: _Harpactes erythrocephalus_ (Trogonidae) / ** / ** / 100 / **\n Total outbreaks: 3\nTotal animals affected:\nSpecies / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered\nHouse crow: _Corvus splendens_ (Corvidae) / - / 148 / 148 / 0 / 0\n\nOutbreak statistics [rates apparent, expressed as percentages]\nSpecies / Morbidity rate / Mortality rate / Case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*\nHouse crow: _Corvus splendens_ (Corvidae) / ** / ** / 100 / **\n 15 Mar 2020\nDate of confirmation of the event: 20 Mar 2020\nReason for notification: recurrence of a listed disease\nDate of previous occurrence: 3 Sep 2019\n 10 Mar 2020\nDate of confirmation of the event: 20 Mar 2020\nReason for notification: recurrence of a listed disease\nDate of previous occurrence: 3 Sep 2019\n Epidemiological unit: zoo\nAffected animals:\nSpecies / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered\nLesser adjutant: _Leptoptilos javanicus_ (Ciconiidae) / - / 3 / 3 / - / -\n A ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n Affected animals:\nSpecies / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered\nHouse crow: _Corvus splendens_ (Corvidae) / - / 1 / 1 / - / -\n\nOutbreak location 2: Chainpura, Kuv, Dulhin Bazar, Chainpura, Dulhin Bazar, Patna, Bihar Date of start of the outbreak: 5 Mar 2020\n Measures applied: screening;

The birds in their sample included ducks, geese, chickens and turkeys. Researchers used RT-PCR [reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction] (a laboratory method used to detect genetic material and specific proteins) to detect the virus that affected the birds in their sample. Results indicated that the birds were infected with a new variety of H5N1 influenza.\n\nThe new iteration of the virus combined various genetic markers from other low pathogenic influenza types that were found in the region since 2013. Researchers hypothesised that this newer version of the virus will supplant the current strain that is infecting poultry and wild birds in Southern Asia.\n\nThe researchers also concluded that the mutations, detected in the H5N1 samples, could be associated with increases in the virus' ability to infect mammals and reductions in its susceptibility to antiviral agents.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nMary Marshall\n<mjm2020@googlemail.com>\n\n[The paper cited in the above report is:\nNooruzzaman M, Mumu TT, Hasnat A, et al.

[Epub ahead of print]\n\nThe abstract follows:\n\n'A total of 15 dead or sick birds from 13 clinical outbreaks of avian influenza in ducks, geese, chickens and turkeys in 2017 in Bangladesh were examined. The presence of H5N1 influenza A virus in the affected birds was detected by RT\u2010PCR. Phylogenetic analysis based on full length gene sequences of all 8 gene segments revealed that these recent outbreaks were caused by a new reassortant of clade 2.3.2.1a H5N1 virus, which had been detected earlier in 2015 during surveillance in live bird markets (LBMs) and wet lands. This reassortant virus acquired PB2, PB1, PA, NP and NS genes from low pathogenic avian influenza viruses mostly of non\u2010H9N2 subtypes but retained HA, NA and M genes of the old clade 2.3.2.1a viruses. Nevertheless, the HA gene of these new viruses was 2.7% divergent from that of the old clade 2.3.2.1a viruses circulated in Bangladesh. Interestingly, similar reassortment events could be traced back in four 2.3.2.1a virus isolates of 2013 from backyard ducks. It suggests that this reassortant virus emerged in 2013, which took 2 years to be detected at a broader scale (i.e. in LBMs), another 2 years until it became widely spread in poultry and fully replaced the old viruses. Several mutations were detected in the recent Bangladeshi isolates, which are likely to influence possible phenotypic alterations such as increased mammalian adaptation, reduced susceptibility to antiviral agents and reduced host antiviral response.'\n\nHPAI H5N1 has been reported in poultry in Bangladesh since 2007; the 2008, the 1st human case was reported.

He said the outbreak is under control by about 80% yesterday [Fri 12 Apr 2019]. As the outbreak location was at the outskirt of town, there were not many vehicles on the road, which made it easier, he added.\n\nThe response team also created awareness in the community. Vehicles traveling out of the demarcated infected and restricted zones are also disinfected.\n\nDr. RB Gurung said poultry farmers are cautioned to comply with farm biosecurity measures and not allow visitors into the farms without proper safety measures. 'We need to observe the outbreak area for one month,' Dr. RB Gurung said.\n\nThe Department of Livestock, Chhukha Dzongkhag Livestock Sector, Department of Public Health, Royal Bhutan Police, Bhutan Agriculture and Food Regulatory Authority and the Regional Livestock Development Centre Tsimasham and local authorities in Phuentsholing have initiated the response to the H5N1 outbreak jointly.\n\n[Byline: Rajesh Rai]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Kunihiko Iizuka\n\n[Phuntsholing, also spelled as Phuentsholing, is a border town in southeastern Bhutan and is the administrative seat of Chhukha District.

The same day, before the laboratory results were out, the patient was administered with oseltamivir, an influenza antiviral medication taken from the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division [EDCD]. But the laboratory failed to identify the strain of the virus, the ministry said in a statement on [Thu 2 May 2019].\n\nThe patient, who worked as a driver, was then transferred to Om Hospital [in Kathmandu] as his condition became critical, according to one official who wanted to remain anonymous. 4 days later, on [29 Mar 2019], the patient died due to respiratory complications while undergoing treatment.\n\nThroat swab specimens were then sent to the WHO Collaborating Center for Influenza in Japan, according to the ministry and laboratory results received on [30 Apr 2019] tested positive for influenza A(H5N1).\n\nH5N1 is a lethal bird flu virus strain that is highly pathogenic. The 1st infection in humans was reported in 1997 in Hong Kong and the virus has since spread to Asia, Africa, Middle East, and Europe and other parts of the world causing millions of poultry infections.\n\nAlthough rare, confirmed human cases for bird flu as reported by the WHO from 2003 to [9 Apr 2019] stands at 860 human cases and 454 deaths. According to the UN body, almost all cases of H5N1 infection have been associated with close contact with infected live or dead fowls or contaminated environment.\n\nWhile the virus does not seem to spread from human to human, a major concern among scientists is that the virus could mutate or combine with other influenza virus into something more infectious and result in a pandemic.\n\nBut least measures were taken since the 21-year-old boy first got admitted to a hospital with influenza-like symptoms and little was done to isolate mourning family members and relatives or anyone the patient had come in close contact with after his death.\n\nAdditionally, there was nothing done to contain the 2 hospitals to which the patient was admitted. But 5 weeks since the boy's death, EDCD director Dr Bibek Kumar Lal says epidemiological investigations have now started and that his office has stepped up surveillance to contain the disease.\n\n'The good thing is no one has come in contact with the virus. The incubation period of the virus is one week but we do not have any cases of infection, 5 weeks on,' Lal told the Post. 'No other patients in the area or elsewhere have been diagnosed with the disease as our laboratory records show.'\n\nNepal declared itself free from H5N1 in 2012 but this strain of the deadly bird flu virus continues to be found in poultry in Nepal and more recently even in some 350 crows in the Capital.\n\nAccording to Dr Bansi Sharma, director general at the Department of Livestock Services, this year [2019] alone, 52 samples collected from poultry farms examined by the central veterinary laboratory tested positive for the deadly H5N1 virus.\n\nFollowing the confirmations, rapid response teams of veterinary technicians were deployed to poultry farms in Kathmandu, Bhaktapur, Lalitpur, Makwanpur, Morang, Sunsari, and Kaski district and over 100 000 infected chickens were culled.\n\n'The outbreaks of H5N1 have serious public health, economic, and social implications, therefore its prevention is a priority across the globe and the human infection is evident of zoonotic disease spillover from animals to humans,' said Manisha Bista, a disease surveillance officer at the Center for Molecular Dynamics Nepal.\n\n'This is an opportunity to identify flaws in our passive surveillance programmes and invest in technical and human capacities to detect diseases and investigate outbreaks and inform the general public without creating public outcry.'\n\n[Byline: Arjun Poudel, Arpan Shrestha]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n[Maps of Nepal can be seen at https://setopati.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/mapofnepal.jpg and http://healthmap.org/promed/p/10454.\nKavrepalanchok district, a part of Province Three, is one of the 77 (formerly 76) districts of Nepal (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kavrepalanchok_District).

But, there is no need to panic, as bird flu has not been reported in poultry yet. No poultry death has taken place so far. Besides, we have sent poultry samples to the Bhopal lab as a precautionary measure,' he said, adding that reports were expected in a couple of days.\n\nThe animal husbandry officer nonetheless advised poultry farmers to isolate and cull sick birds, restrict access to healthy ones, clean cages and equipment regularly, disinfect footwear/gloves of workers, and stop borrowing supplies from other farms.\n\n'People who eat chicken and eggs need not worry. Boiling these above 70 deg C [158 deg F] kills the H5N1 virus. Also, to avoid human infection in case of an outbreak, one must avoid domesticating poultry birds,' Sinha said.\n\nThe 9 quick response teams, the officer said, would aid in containing the spread of bird flu. 'If need be, more than one team can be rushed to a particular block or area to assist in culling. Each team is lead by a veterinarian who will supervise culling, disposal of carcasses, vaccination, and disinfecting poultry farms,' he said.\n\nOn how the crows contracted the deadly H5N1 virus, Sinha said it was possible that some migratory avian species were the carriers. 'This winter [2018-19], several migratory birds were seen in and around Bokaro, including Gomia. It is possible they are responsible for the spread of avian influenza in crows.'\n\n[Byline: Praduman Choubey]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Maps of India: http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/india/india-political-map.htm and http://healthmap.org/promed/p/306]", "summary": "A ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n \n\nThe state animal husbandry department had on [Sat 9 Feb 2019] said samples of dead crows sent to the National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases (NIHSAD), Bhopal, had tested positive for the H5N1 virus that is responsible for the highly infectious scourge in avian species. \n\nBesides Gomia, where crows began dropping dead in the last week of January [2019], Bermo, Chandrapura, Kasmar, Chas, Nawadih, Chandankyari, Jaridih, and Petarwar blocks have been put on high alert, said Bokaro animal husbandry officer Arun Kumar Sinha. \n\nThe 9 quick response teams, the officer said, would aid in containing the spread of bird flu.

Four waves of H5N1 high pathogenicity avian influenza (HPAI) took place in 2004, 2006, 2007, and 2017. The 1st epidemics of HPAI H5N1 subtype occurred in Kelantan, Kuala Lumpur, and Perak in 2004. At that time, the outbreak was caused by 1, 2.3, and 2.3.4 clades. Molecular analysis of AIV of the HA gene found that the H5N1 strain was highly homologous and grouped together in a Vietnam/Thailand/Malaysia (VTM) sublineage to the previously H5N1 isolates from domestic and migratory birds in Thailand, Viet Nam, Cambodia, and Hong Kong during 2003-2005. Genetic differences of these clades with 2.1 clade from Indonesia suggested that the virus was contained within poultry rather than through the repeated reintroduction of viruses from external sources. In 2006, H5N1 virus was detected in Kuala Lumpur and the states of Perak and Pulau Pinang. The outbreak at that time was genetically similar to the previous outbreaks of the Fujian-like sub-lineage (clade 2.3.4) in 2004. H5N1 isolates were detected in Selangor, Kelantan, and Kuala Lumpur in 2007 and only in Kelantan in 2017. During 1980-2017, outbreaks of low pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI) included H4N3, H4N6, H3N6, H5N6, H2N9, H4N1, H7N1, H2N9, H3N8, H9N2, H10N5, H3N2, and H5N2 subtypes. The outbreaks in Malaysia suggest that culling has played an important role in the prevention of AIV infection in poultry, the reduction of virus containment in the environment, and the prevention of virus transmission from poultry to humans.'

Currently the virus continued to be reported in Asia and Africa in both poultry and wild birds. The virus has become enzootic in Asia and Africa and continues to cause outbreaks in poultry and sporadic human infections.\n\nAs of May 2018, 860 human infections have been reported to WHO from 16 countries and territories. All cases of H5N1 infection in humans have been associated with close contact with infected live or dead birds, or H5N1-contaminated environments.

There are 16 H types and 9 N types yielding a total 144 possible combinations.\n\nThe H5 and H7 subtypes are of particular concern, given the ability of these 2 H-types to mutate from low pathogenic to highly pathogenic strains. These 2 H-types have been known to cause serious disease and mortality in domestic poultry http://www.inspection.gc.ca/animals/terrestrial-animals/diseases/reportable/ai/fact-sheet/eng/1356193731667/1356193918453.\n\n'Most AI virus strains are low pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI) and typically cause little or no clinical signs in infected poultry. The LPAI virus is excreted through infected birds' feces and secretions. It spreads primarily through direct contact between healthy and infected birds. It can also be spread through indirect contact with contaminated equipment and materials.\n\nTo prevent cases of LPAI, poultry producers must use special preventative measures and precautions on the farm. If LPAI is detected, farms must be thoroughly cleaned and disinfected. AI viruses are inactivated by heat and drying. They are also very sensitive to most disinfectants and detergents. To ensure thorough cleaning and disinfection, the area must be clear of organic material'. https://tinyurl.com/y7rfdhx8\n\nIn addition to these 2 new reported events, since 2015 to date, France also continues to have 2 active events associated with LPAI H5N2 and H5N3.

It is called Safe Contained Poultry Slaughter (SCOPS) and uses large pots or a bucket to capture the viral plume during the death struggle of the bird so that virus-laden aerosols are greatly reduced or eliminated. The program is designed for outreach to village-level women who do home slaughter and the outreach tool is easily altered to fit whatever area or culture is being addressed.\n\nBy using schools and teaching children who then take home [a flyer given to them at school], to teach their mothers, rapid dissemination of the [guidelines addressing] slaughter was accomplished. Additionally there were more than 1000 meetings and seminars held for adult attendees.\n\nThe 2 published posters/flyers illustrate the slaughter technique (11 panels) and then reiterate the most important steps (5 panels). For the flyers, the 2 illustrations were printed back-to-back on one sheet so that what is taken home has both sets of illustrations.\n\nThe posters are very visual in design and meant for limited literacy audiences so that the technique is clear to everyone regardless of educational background, i.e. there is no writing on the 11-step (although there is a version with writing available) and writing on the 5-step (and there is a version with no writing available).\n\nImplementation of this outreach program is very straightforward and the posters can be easily translated where writing is needed or wanted. Also, clothing, facial features, and skin color can be altered to fit the nation/area and culture.\n\n--\nAndrew A. Clark, DVM\nInternational Veterinary Consultant\nPendleton, OR 97801\nU.S.A.\n<andrewaclark1940@gmail.com>\n\n[Dr Clark is acknowledged for his observations and for the examples of public education in Egypt concerning preventive measures during traditional home-slaughter of poultry.\n\nFAO Regional Office for Near East and North Africa, situated in Cairo, published on 1 Feb 2016 a description of its anti-Avian influenza outreach campaign (see at http://www.fao.org/neareast/news/view/en/c/386133/). It is herewith summarized:\n\n'Launched by the FAO's Emergency Centre for Transboundary Animal Diseases (ECTAD) in November 2015, the Exposure Reduction Program (ERP) has proved a tangible success, raising awareness among households regarding the risks linked to the traditional Egyptian household poultry-slaughter and promoting safer manual bird-slaughter steps across Egypt.\n\nThe launched ERP encourages safe/contained poultry slaughter in covered pots (Halla). The objective is to protect individuals who slaughter poultry in the household sector and also to protect the people around them, who are usually women and children, from exposure to the high pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAI), which can be transmitted during the manual slaughter of an apparently healthy but infected bird that is not yet showing symptoms.\n\nSohair Abel Kader, National Consultant to the program, commented: 'We researched the fact that women and children were the categories most affected by avian flu in Egypt and found that traditional manual slaughter as practiced in Egyptian homes is a main risk factor.' She added: 'The scientific research conducted on this issue proved that containing the bird in a covered pot for a few minutes immediately after slaughter, specifically till the completion of death struggle, protects those who carry out the slaughter and others around them.' Abel Kader said the 10 steps recommended by the FAO program require no special skills and are not costly, as every house has a Halla (pot) with cover, which can be washed with soap and water and is the main instrument needed for safe slaughter. She expressed optimism about the initial response to the campaign by Egyptian citizens.\n\nThe campaign's outreach field staff is formed from rural community health care workers (Raidat Reefiat) from the Ministry of Health and Population and the awareness campaign's professional veterinarians from both extension vets and community animal health and outreach (CAHO) vets, from the General Organization of Veterinary Services, representing the Ministry of Agriculture and Land Reclamation.'\n\nHPAI H5N1 circulation in Egypt reportedly started in March 2006; it was declared endemic in poultry since 2008 while human cases have been reported yearly. As of March 2017 a total of 359 human infections with, at least, 123 deaths have been registered. The disease, in both poultry and in humans, peaks during the cold season (November-March). Last human case was observed on 9 Apr 2017 in Cairo Governorate.\n\nIndonesia reported, between 2005 and 2015, 199 human HPAI H5N1 cases, of which 167 were fatal. No human case has been reported between 2015 and the single fatal case reported recently, which brings the total to 200 cases, 168 of them fatal. The country is endemic for the disease in poultry and, so far, in 2017, 115 H5N1 HPAI outbreaks in poultry were detected in 17 provinces. It may be assumed that the number of human cases in Indonesia is under reported. It is less likely, though not excluded, that human fatalities remain unnoticed.\nInformation on the measures undertaken in Indonesia to reduce human infection with HPAI H5N1, on top of the vaccination of poultry, from FAO, WHO and/or other, national or international agencies and NGO's, is anticipated.\n\nGlobally, from January 2003 to September 2017, there were 859 cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H5N1) virus reported from 16 countries worldwide, led by Egypt and Indonesia. Of these cases, 453 were fatal, resulting in a global CFR of 52.7 percent. - Mod.AS]\n\n[Even though human cases of avian influenza A/H5N1 have been consistently reported since 1997 when it first surfaced, the pandemic potential and its impending threat are compounded by the opportunities for circulation and re-assortment in human hosts leading to a virus that can transmit robustly between humans. So far that has not happened, but the continued and perhaps unnoticed cases in humans require vigilance, ongoing surveillance, and capacity for laboratory diagnosis. - Mod.UBA\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/184.]", "summary": "It is herewith summarized:\n\n'Launched by the FAO's Emergency Centre for Transboundary Animal Diseases (ECTAD) in November 2015, the Exposure Reduction Program (ERP) has proved a tangible success, raising awareness among households regarding the risks linked to the traditional Egyptian household poultry-slaughter and promoting safer manual bird-slaughter steps across Egypt.\n\n International Veterinary Consultant\nPendleton, OR 97801\nU.S.A.\n<andrewaclark1940@gmail.com>\n\n[Dr Clark is acknowledged for his observations and for the examples of public education in Egypt concerning preventive measures during traditional home-slaughter of poultry.

The most important community messages are to avoid contact with birds that suddenly get sick or die; maintain personal hygiene and keep the environment clean and healthy; and to recognize the symptoms of bird flu that include fever, cough and sore throat and history of contact with sick poultry. If there are signs of AI immediately report to the clinic or hospital. - Mod.UBA\n\nThe source of infection of the victim (eg poultry farm, market, slaughterhouse, kitchen etc) has not been specified; available information will be appreciated. According to Indonesia's last available annual OIE report, covering 2016, the total annual number of HPAI outbreaks in poultry was 284, including HPAI H5N1 and other, unspecified, serotype(s). In Bali, the last (2) HPAI H5N1 outbreaks were recorded in Feb 2016, affecting 249 (dead) birds. The semi-annual report for January to June 2017 is not yet available.

There has been no case of human transmission, although health officials are conducting checks on farm workers.\n\n'We have declared a one-km quarantine radius with the epicenter being San Luis. All fowl found within the area will be culled and buried, and the estimated population is 200 000,' Pinol told reporters at a news conference.\n\nThe volume of birds to be culled was half of Pinol's initial estimate of 400 000, which he said was based on a preliminary evaluation and was later revised after inspection.\n\nThe government's report on Friday [4 Aug 2017?] to the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) described the flu virus in affected birds as an H5 subtype of highly pathogenic (high-path) avian influenza.\n\nInitial tests ruled out high-path H5N1 as the virus strain, Dr. Celia Carlos told reporters, and samples will be sent to Australia for further testing.\n\n'The Department of Health is doing surveillance of possible human cases, especially concentrating on people who have been exposed to the affected animals or poultry,' Carlos said.\n\nCulling should be completed within the next 3 days, said Pinol. The virus may have come from migratory birds from China or smuggled ducks, also from China, he said.\n\nThere were indications as early as April 2017 of bird flu hitting one farm, but the situation worsened in July 2017, with around 37 000 birds dying during the period, Pinol said.\n\nThe Philippines is the latest country in Asia, Europe and Africa where the bird flu viruses have spread in recent months. Many strains only infect birds, but the H7N9 strain has led to human cases, including fatalities, in China'. See https://www.agcanada.com/daily/philippines-reports-first-avian-flu-outbreak.\n\nRegarding Laos, during September 2016, Laos reported to the OIE one outbreak of HPAI H5N1. The outbreak was located in the province of Luangprabang. The event was declared resolved on 26 Oct 2016. See report and map at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?reportid=21176.\n\nAll outbreaks of HPAI (highly pathogenic avian influenza) reported from 1 Jan 2016

Human cases of H5N1 avian influenza occur occasionally, but it is difficult to transmit the infection from person to person. When people do become infected, the mortality rate is about 60 per cent.\n\nAlmost all cases of H5N1 infection in people have been associated with close contact with infected live or dead birds, or H5N1-contaminated environments.

In Indonesia, highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) virus has become endemic in poultry, and has caused sporadic deadly infections in human. Since 2012 we have conducted fixed-point surveillance of avian influenza viruses at a live poultry market in East Java, Indonesia. In this study we examined the seroprevalence of the virus infection among market workers.\n\nMethods. Sera were collected from 101 workers in early 2014 and examined for antibody activity against avian A(H5N1) Eurasian lineage virus by hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay.\n\nResults. By the HI assay, 84 percent of the sera tested positive for antibody activity against the avian virus. Further analysis revealed the average HI titer in 2014 to be 2.9-fold higher than in 2012 and that seroconversion occurred in 44 percent of paired sera (11/25) between 2012 and 2014. A medical history survey was carried out in 2016; responses to questionnaires indicated that none of workers had suffered from severe acute respiratory illness during 2013.\n\nConclusions. This study provides evidence of a high prevalence of avian A(H5N1) virus infection in 2013 among workers of a live poultry market. However no instances of hospitalizations were reported, we can therefore conclude the virus did not manifest any clinical symptoms in workers.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The article titled 'Seroevidence for High Prevalence of Subclinical Infection with Avian Influenza A(H5N1) Virus among Workers in a Live Poultry Market in Indonesia' by Shimizu et al can be accessed at the above URL.\n\nThe 1st human cases in Indonesia occurred in July 2005. By then, Indonesia was the worst affected country, with more than 150 reported human cases to date and a case-fatality rate of around 83 percent [http://www.tm.mahidol.ac.th/seameo/2010-41-5/09-4850.pdf].\n\nA field study by van Beest Holle et al in 2007 did not find evidence of antibodies against avian influenza A(H5N1) among West Java poultry farmers, despite recent reports of H5N1 outbreaks among poultry in the area. This finding was consistent with other Asian studies that found limited seropositivity among poultry farmers exposed to H5N1-virus since 2004 [http://www.tm.mahidol.ac.th/seameo/2010-41-5/09-4850.pdf].\n\nStudies by another group in Bangladesh [http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0073200] also showed that despite exposure to sick poultry, no farm or market poultry workers were seropositive for HPAI H5N1 virus antibodies while Chi Dung et al have reported overall seroprevalence of 6.1 percent with the highest proportion (7.2 percent) in poultry market workers in Hanoi, and the majority of seropositive subjects (70.3 percent) were slaughterers or sellers of poultry [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4318972/].\n\nAmong serological assays, hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay has been the main method used to investigate/document exposure related immune responses to influenza viruses.

The prefect of the department has been seeking answers. During a meeting that he chaired on Friday, 8 Sep [2016] to raise the poultry farmers' awareness on the importance of respecting measures enacted by the governor of the West [Ouest] region to fight avian flu, the prefect received some news from the livestock, fishing and animal industry's delegate of the 3rd district of Bafoussam.\n\n[The delegate] said that she was tipped off that several chickens died in a farm in the neighborhood of Tocket, belonging to a lady. Only when she visited this farm the next day, she got quite the surprise. The poultry farm was empty. All 600 chickens were gone. The neighbors revealed that the 3 children of the owner had the flu and a chronic cough. No one was at the house. The neighbors informed the delegate that the woman went to Yaounde with her sick children to consult a doctor. It was reported they got infected in Bafoussam and are now in Yaounde for treatment.\n\nThe authorities fear that the symptoms are the result of a transmission of H5N1 from poultry to humans, and that improper care could produce more infections. Joseph Tangwa Fover requested an investigation to find the woman and her sick children, in order to put them in quarantine, and identify the disease. Since last week the flu has made a comeback in the Mifi Department. On Friday, 8 Sep [2016], to fight the flu, the governor of the West region signed a decree containing the following measures: 'ban on the sale of poultry in the markets in all of Mifi'; 'ban on the movement of poultry, products and by-products entering or leaving Mifi'; 'containment of identified households in a 10 km [about 6 mile] radius and strengthening of biosecurity measures.'\n\nThe governor of the West region went one step further. He also ordered: 'slaughter and incineration of all suspicious or infected birds within a 3 km [about 2 mile] radius and burial of carcasses'; 'mandatory disinfection of all identified poultry farms and sites in a 3 km radius and observance of depopulation until further notice'; 'application of practical advice issued by Minepia and/or the Ministry of Health to manage the crisis'; 'all poultry sites to be inspected by veterinary services and health workers'; and finally evaluation on a regular basis of the 'highly pathogenic avian influenza' infection.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Based on information available from the above report, there is not enough epidemiological data on the suspected human cases, which could be flu-like illness resulting from seasonal flu.

Both had been exposed to poultry or their environments, were hospitalized with pneumonia, and recovered after antiviral treatment.\n\nThe WHO said no other cases were detected in any of the patients' contacts and that H5N1 is endemic in Egyptian poultry.\n\nSo far, 8 H5N1 cases have been reported globally this year [2016], all of them in Egypt. The WHO said since 2003, 854 cases have been reported, 450 of them fatal, from 16 countries.\n\nIn related developments, the WHO recently noted 7 more H7N9 avian flu cases reported from China on 12 Jul 2016, 4 of them fatal. In a 22 Jul 2016 statement, the WHO said onset dates range from 26 May to 23 Jun 2016, with ages spanning 52 to 68 years.\n\nThe patients were from 6 provinces and cities. Four of the patients are men, and 5 reported exposure to poultry or their environments before they became ill. One worked a market where live poultry is sold.

The strain can infect and cause death in humans and kills poultry at a high rate.\n\nThe latest H5N1 outbreaks were recently confirmed on chicken farms in Cameroon putting poultry production in the country and its neighbours at high risk. This is the 1st time the disease has been found in Central Africa since 2006.\n\nThis brings the number of countries that have battled bird flu in West and Central Africa to 6, including Burkina Faso, Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana, Niger and Nigeria.\n\nNigeria continues to be most affected, with the total number of outbreaks exceeding 750, with nearly 3.5 million birds dead or culled. The newly recorded outbreaks in Cameroon raise significant concerns that the disease may be advancing southward, triggering national and global emergency responses to contain the disease and health screenings of poultry workers.\n\nFAO, meanwhile, is alerting neighbouring governments to be vigilant and continue their heightened surveillance and prevention efforts, including common messaging to the public and data sharing between the public health and agriculture sectors.\n\n'We're looking at a quickly spreading disease that has devastating effects on livelihoods in communities,' said Abebe Haile Gabriel, FAO Deputy Regional Representative for Africa. 'H5N1 causes major losses of nutritious food and threatens farmers' livelihoods, particularly in resource-poor environments where governments have difficulty providing financial compensation for losses,' he said, adding that 'trade restrictions often pose an additional hardship on already struggling economies.'\n\nThe H5N1 strain of avian influenza has caused the deaths of tens of millions of poultry and losses of tens of billions of USD worldwide since the virus 1st spread internationally in 2013; in Cameroon alone, losses have added up to an estimated USD 20 million, according to local media reports.\n\nFAO is working closely with the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) to offer member-countries assistance, such as risk assessments, contingency planning, technical advice and laboratory material. They also help with investigating potential avian influenza cases in animals and humans and locating the source of infection.\n\nIn Cameroon, FAO is boosting the local veterinary services' capacity to respond rapidly to new outbreaks and is working with the government to finalize an action plan similar to effective plans applied in other countries stricken by the virus.\n\nResponse interventions include culling infected and exposed poultry, disinfecting premises and markets, and safely disposing of dead birds.\n\nVeterinary officers, meanwhile, are encouraged to use basic techniques like 'trace-forward' -- which looks at where infected animals have been sold or moved to -- and 'trace backward' -- examining where infected animals were purchased or where they came from -- to find sources, with the ultimate goal of halting continuous virus introduction or further spread.\n\nA major concern is that the disease may become endemic in the entire region, particularly in Nigeria, where avian influenza has become so entrenched in poultry production and marketing systems that it will be difficult to eliminate.\n\nFor that reason, producers and traders need to be made aware about the clinical signs of the disease symptoms, how and to whom to report it, and implement good hygiene practices to halt its spread.\n\nFAO will continue assisting governments in mobilizing funds to combat H5N1, in addition to the agency's own efforts to help boost local veterinary systems, strengthen laboratories, and deploy FAO specialists to affected and at-risk countries.\n\nThe 1st assessment mission and distribution of equipment in Cameroon was made possible by funding from the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID).

High: Iran (Islamic Republic of), Israel, Jordan, the Syrian Arab Republic and Turkey,\n2. Medium: Gaza Strip, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and The West Bank,\n3. Low: Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia,\n4. Negligible: Cyprus.\n\nThe situation in the region is of concern given the existing poultry populations at risk and the potential for spread between countries. Given the presence of civil unrest and active civil war in some countries of the region, investment in agriculture and livestock is reduced, including limitations to public veterinary services. Underreporting of animal disease events is a significant challenge given the lack of reporting systems in those areas with ongoing conflict. It is therefore possible that, in addition to Iraq and Lebanon, the disease is already present in the Syrian Arab Republic. The cause of the recent incursions into the region is currently unknown but a combination of wild birds seeding infection and trade with neighbouring countries is likely. Poultry and poultry-related trade and movements play an important role in national and cross-border spread. The overall risk for the region in terms of potential spread to uninfected countries ranges from negligible to high depending on the country with Iran (Islamic Republic of), Israel, Jordan, the Syrian Arab Republic and Turkey being at highest risk of incursion.\n\nThe current H5N1 HPAI epizootic is expected to have a potential impact on food security, human health and poultry-dependent livelihoods in a region which is already suffering from political unrest and deteriorated public and animal health services.\n\n[Contributors: Caryl Lockhart, Silvia Kreindel, Claudia Pittiglio, Martina Escher, Sophie von Dobschuetz, Ludovic Plee, Elisa Palamara, Mirko Bruni, Juan Lubroth, Julio Pinto and Eran Raizman]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The new EMPRES risk assessment includes, on top of the above summary, the following chapters:\nIntroduction; Risk questions; Hazard identification; Risk assessment; Factors contributing to introduction and spread of the virus in the region; Conclusions; Bibliography.\n\nThe following section has been extracted from the conclusions chapter:\n\n'Conclusions\n------------\nSince H5N1 HPAI is a zoonotic virus and therefore constitutes a public health threat, communication among ministries and enhanced surveillance are as important as prompt reporting. The regional risk map [see Fig 5 in the full document, source URL] based on risk factors such as extensive and intensive poultry density, lakes, rivers, estuaries and wetlands highlighted differences in HPAI risk within and between countries in the region.\n\nAreas within Israel, Lebanon, The West Bank and Gaza Strip, and western and northern parts of the Syrian Arab Republic are at high risk for H5N1 HPAI presence if the disease is introduced (i.e. greater than 80 percent).\n\nAreas with lower to medium risk probabilities were distributed across Azerbaijan, Georgia, Iran (Islamic Republic of), Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. Risk probabilities were driven primarily by extensive poultry density (greater than 80 percent) rather than the presence of lakes or wetlands (0 percent).\n\nIn conclusion, based on both the risk assessment and the risk factor analyses, countries at high risk include Turkey and the Syrian Arab Republic (particularly areas near the Kurdistan region and the western area near the border with Lebanon) and Iran (Islamic Republic of). Given the presence of high poultry production areas and low biosecurity along the Syrian Arab Republic border with Iraq and no information on the HPAI situation in the Syrian Arab Republic due to non-functional veterinary infrastructure, it is likely that H5N1 HPAI virus has already been introduced in poultry populations there, though they have not been reported to date. Iran (Islamic Republic of) is at similar risk judging from anecdotal evidence of informal trade at the Kurdish border with Iran (Islamic Republic of), but unlike the Syrian Arab Republic, the veterinary systems for detection and response are operational. Jordan shares borders with the Syrian Arab Republic and Iraq, and the movement of livestock, including live poultry across borders from the Syrian Arab Republic, is ongoing and is associated with refugee movements.\n\nCountries at medium risk of incursion of H5N1 HPAI include Gaza Strip, Israel, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and the West Bank. For Gaza Strip, Israel and the West Bank, there is no evidence of substantive trade, either legal or illegal from the affected countries. Additionally, incursions may be mitigated by high security concerns implemented at borders. Kuwait and Saudi Arabia share borders with Iraq and given that the extent of spread in Iraq is not fully discerned, movement of infected live poultry is possible.\n\nArmenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia are located along spring migration pathways for wild birds travelling northwards but the risk of wild birds becoming infected and subsequently seeding viruses to these countries is considered low. The role of live poultry trade is considered low to negligible. The overall risk of introduction of H5N1 into the poultry population is low.\n\nCyprus is considered at negligible risk of incursion from the 2 infected countries given its geographic location (separated by sea), lack of poultry trade and the fact that it is not on the wild bird migratory route.\n\nThere is a high uncertainty on the reliability of available data related to trade, poultry value/marketing chains, poultry production systems, interactions between wild birds and poultry production systems, and local wild water bird species distribution patterns.' - Mod.AS\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/12214.]", "summary": "promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The new EMPRES risk assessment includes, on top of the above summary, the following chapters:\nIntroduction; Risk questions; Hazard identification; Risk assessment; Factors contributing to introduction and spread of the virus in the region; Conclusions; Bibliography.

Based on information in follow-up report No 1 dated 27 Jan 2016, as of that date no new outbreaks had occurred. The epidemiological comment in that report stated that 'The promoter of the farm has many activities with Nigeria (purchase of feed, of young chickens, for example)'. The outbreak in Maradi is still showing as 'continuing', and several control measures are being applied. See event summary and updated map at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?reportid=17568.\n\nThe current outbreak of HPAI in Tillaberi was reported to have started at the end of February 2016, but it was confirmed 3 months later at the end of May 2016. Furthermore, even though the country is indicating that the outbreak was resolved 13 Apr 2016, the event is still active. In fact, the report indicates that certain sanitary measures such as 'official destruction of animals products and official disposal of carcasses, by-products and waste' are still to be applied. If, in fact, the outbreak was resolved 6 weeks ago, but disposal of dead birds is still to be accomplished, this should be of concern to both animal and human health.\n\nThe map of Niger can be seen at http://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/map/niger-political-map.htm. - Mod.CRD\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/679.]", "summary": "no treatment of affected animals\nMeasures to be applied: movement control inside the country; dipping/spraying; official destruction of animals products; official disposal of carcasses, by-products and waste\n\nDiagnostic test results\nLaboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result\nExperimental Zooprophylactic Institute (IZS), Padova (Italy) (OIE Reference Laboratory) / A ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n \n\nOutbreak statistics [rates apparent, expressed as percentages]\nSpecies / Morbidity rate / Mortality rate / Case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*\n Outbreak status: resolved 13 Apr 2016\nEpidemiological unit: farm\n Total outbreaks: 1\nOutbreak 1: Poultry centre, Niamey, Niamey, Tillaberi\n Summary\nReport type: immediate notification\n Serotype: H5N1\nNature of diagnosis: clinical, laboratory (basic), laboratory (advanced), necropsy\n Affected animals:\nSpecies / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered\n AVIAN INFLUENZA (48): NIGER (TILLABERI), POULTRY, HPAI H5N1, OIE\n****************************************************************\n Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n< This event pertains to a defined zone within the country\n\nNew outbreaks (1)\n [The location of the outbreak can be seen on the interactive map included in the OIE report at the source URL above.]\n\n--\n Date of start of the outbreak: 21 Feb 2016\n Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction, and/or slaughter\n\nEpidemiology\n Date of start of the event: 21 Feb 2016\n Source: OIE, WAHID (World Animal Health Information Database), weekly disease information 2016; 29(22) [edited]\n Date of confirmation of the event: 26 May 2016\n", "reports": [{"diseases": ["unknown"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2016-03-24 00:00:00", "2015-05-24 00:00:00", "2016-05-24 00:00:00", "2016-01-27 00:00:00", "2015-03-24 00:00:00", "2016-02-21 00:00:00", "2015-01-01 00:00:00", "2015-04-24 00:00:00", "2016-06-02 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Maradi", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Niamey", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "WAHID", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Padova", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Italy", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Nigeria", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "West Africa", "country": "unknown"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "4250950", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Avian influenza (47): Egypt, HPAI H5N1, poultry, spread, FAO", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=4250950", "date": "2016-05-28 12:52:54", "main_text": "AVIAN INFLUENZA (47): EGYPT, HPAI H5N1, POULTRY, SPREAD, FAO\n************************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Tue 17 May 2016\nSource: EMPRES-i (FAO Emergency Prevention System) [compiled Mod.AB, edited]\nhttp://empres-i.fao.org/eipws3g/\n\n\nBetween 9 and 16 May 2016, 10 highly pathogenic avian influenza [HPAI] H5N1 outbreaks were observed in 6 Egyptian governorates, with 2 outbreaks each in Fayoum, Menia, Qena, and Assiut, and a single outbreak each in Beni Suef and Gharbia.

In the case of viral infection, scientists have advised farm owners not to sell or move any of the birds/eggs and material out of farm. They have been instructed to adopt adequate bio-security measures.\n\nThe State has around 7000 poultry farms -- both layer and broiler varieties.

The State Government would provide compensation to the farmer immediately after culling. It was decided to cull all poultry birds within 1-km [0.62 mi] radius of the infected farm.\n\nDoctors and scientists of Institute of Animal Health and Veterinary, Biologicals [IAH&VB], Bengaluru, visited the private farm in Bidar and collected the samples for testing. The samples were tested at National Institute High Security Animal Diseases, Bhopal, and samples tested positive for H5N1, the Minister said.\n\nA team of experts would oversee the process of culling and preventive measures being taken to contain its spread.\n\nA team comprising Joint Director IAH&VB has been constituted to visit [the district] Bidar and take all measures to control and keep ready all the required materials, rapid response team for culling birds, and for sanitation. The Minister said, 'There is no need for panic as there are no others farms in the village.'\n\nThe officials of the Health and Family Welfare Department have appealed to the public not to consume chicken infected with H5N1, since it can be transmitted to humans.\n\nThe farm owners must step-up vigil and surveillance of potential sources of infection, such as indigenous chicken and poultry farm chicken, ducks, and migratory birds.\n\nThe spread of the disease not only entails loss to poultry farmers and the government because of stamping out of infected birds, but also in terms of payment of compensation to farmers and commercial loss in trade, officials said.\n\nFarmers have been told to regularly conduct inspections in the poultry farms and closely monitor the movement of wild and migratory birds, who carry the highly pathogenic H5N1 virus.\n\n[Byline: Nagesh Prabhu]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[India's most recent reported outbreak of HPAI H5N1 dates back to January 2016.

A difference exists in the virus classification; one is low pathogenic (LPAI) and the other is highly pathogenic (HPAI). Pathogenicity refers to the ability of the virus to produce disease. HPAI H5N1, often referred to as the Asian H5N1, is the type causing worldwide concern. LPAI H5N1, often referred to as the North American H5N1, is of less concern.\n\nLPAI H5N1 (North American H5N1): LPAI, or 'low path' AI, commonly occurs in wild birds. In most cases, it causes minor sickness or no noticeable signs of disease. It is rarely fatal in birds. LPAI strains are not known to be a human health concern. This includes LPAI H5N1. Evidence of LPAI H5N1 has been found in wild birds in the United States in recent years and is not closely related to the more severe HPAI H5N1 circulating overseas. Examples of historical reports of LPAI H5N1 received by USDA include:\n\n1975 - LPAI H5N1 was detected in a wild mallard duck and a wild blue goose in Wisconsin as part of routine sampling, not as a result of noticeable illness in the birds.\n\n1981 and 1985 - the University of Minnesota conducted a sampling procedure in which sentinel ducks were monitored in cages placed in the wild for a short period of time, and LPAI H5N1 was detected in those ducks in both years.\n\n1983 - LPAI H5N1 was detected in ring-billed gulls in Pennsylvania.\n\n1986 - LPAI H5N1 was detected in a wild mallard duck in Ohio as part of routine sampling, not as a result of noticeable illness in the birds.\n\n2002 - LPAI H5N1 antibodies were detected in turkeys in Michigan but the virus could not be isolated; therefore, this detection could not be confirmed.\n\n2005 - LPAI H5N1 was detected in ducks in Manitoba, Canada.\n\n2006 - LPAI H5N1 was confirmed in 2 Michigan mute swans and mallard ducks; Maryland resident wild mallard ducks, and Pennsylvania wild mallard ducks; and Delaware green-winged teals, all sampled as part of USDA's expanded avian influenza surveillance.\n\nIn the past, there was no requirement for reporting or tracking LPAI H5 or H7 detections in wild birds so states and universities tested wild bird samples independently of USDA. Because of this, the above list of previous detections might not be all inclusive of past LPAI H5N1 detections. However, the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE), from 2006, changed its requirement of reporting detections of avian influenza. Now, all confirmed LPAI H5 and H7 AI subtypes must be reported to the OIE because of their potential to mutate into highly pathogenic strains.

Avian influenza A(H5N1) virus in Egypt. Emerg Infect Dis. 2016 Mar [date cited]. DOI: 10.3201/eid2203.150593]\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nAbstract\n--------\n'In Egypt, avian influenza A subtype H5N1 and H9N2 viruses are enzootic in poultry. The control plan devised by veterinary authorities in Egypt to prevent infections in poultry focused mainly on vaccination and ultimately failed. Recently, widespread H5N1 infections in poultry and a substantial increase in the number of human cases of H5N1 infection were observed. We summarize surveillance data from 2009 through 2014 and show that avian influenza viruses are established in poultry in Egypt and are continuously evolving genetically and antigenically. We also discuss the epidemiology of human infection with avian influenza in Egypt and describe how the true burden of disease is underestimated. We discuss the failures of relying on vaccinating poultry as the sole intervention tool. We conclude by highlighting the key components that need to be included in a new strategy to control avian influenza infections in poultry and humans in Egypt.'\n\nHuman cases [H5N1]\n------------------\nThe paper states that 'During 2006-2015, the estimated number of confirmed human cases of H5N1 infection in Egypt was 292, with a 34 per cent case fatality rate. The number of reported cases by year for 2006-2015 shows that, before the 2014-15 winter season, the annual number of cases never exceeded 40. However, in just 2 months, January and February 2015, a total of 88 cases were reported. The most recent cases occurred in persons who reported exposure to backyard poultry (70 per cent), bred domestic birds (26 per cent), slaughtered poultry (14 per cent), or were exposed to dead birds (4 per cent)...'\n\nExtent of avian influenza infection in Egypt\n--------------------------------------------\n'In Egypt, the number of reported human cases of avian influenza infection appears to be underestimated. An underestimation might result in an overestimation of the case-fatality rate, but it would certainly underestimate the extent of human infection with avian influenza viruses. Results from a controlled, serologic cohort study of persons in Egypt exposed and not exposed to poultry estimated the seroprevalence of antibodies against H5N1 (titers greater than 80) at 2 per cent. If this seroprevalence were to be extrapolated to the entire poultry-exposed population in Egypt, the true number of infections would amount to several hundred thousand. These figures are even more striking when it comes to human infection with H9N2 viruses. The seroprevalence of H9N2 antibodies detected in the same cohort study ranged from 5.6 per cent to 7.5 per cent, whereas just 1 case of H9N2 infection was reported...'\n\nProposed avian influenza control plan\n-------------------------------------\n'The avian influenza situation in Egypt is deteriorating, evident in the fact that H5N1 and H9N2 viruses are enzootic in poultry and that incidence of H5N1 and H9N2 infection is increasing. The problem is also evident in the sharp increase in human H5N1 cases and the detection of the 1st human H9N2 case. Thus, it is imperative that authorities in Egypt devise and implement an aggressive control plan to curb the spread of disease in human and animal populations. The control plan must include the following elements: 1) mapping of the unlicensed, small-scale poultry farms that have become abundant in rural areas; 2) increasing the biosecurity levels of these small farms by using inexpensive tools; 3) revamping veterinary and public health surveillance and conducting joint human-animal interface surveillance and risk-assessment exercises; 4) encouraging poultry owners to report outbreaks and providing them appropriate compensation; 5) intervening, when poultry outbreaks are reported, by culling infected poultry and setting monitoring zones around each focus point; 6) properly decontaminating infected farms; 7) encouraging the use of disinfectants in backyards where poultry are raised; 8) increasing awareness about the effects of avian influenza; 9) testing patients with suspected influenza for H5N1 and H9N2 virus; and 10) reevaluating the vaccination strategy, including that for H9N2 virus. If vaccination is to remain an important tool in the control plan, then the following aspects should be considered: 1) matching vaccine strains to currently circulating strains; 2) matching challenge strains to currently circulating strains; 3) maintaining high vaccination coverage; 4) ensuring vaccine efficacy not only in a laboratory setting but also in the field; and 5) evaluating vaccine efficacy on an annual basis.'\n\nConclusions\n-----------\n'Egypt is one of the few countries where H5N1 virus has become enzootic and is the only country with a high number of H5N1 outbreaks among poultry and cases among human. During the 2014-15 winter season, a sudden and substantial increase in human infection with H5N1 viruses was observed. There is no obvious or confirmed reason for this increase, but data indicate the following: 1) H9N2 virus is co-circulating and co-infecting with H5N1 viruses, 2) H5N1 viruses causing the infections possess some mutations that were rarely seen in the past, and 3) the poultry vaccination program is failing. However, our perspective was limited to the data available through our surveillance program, which might not be representative of the epizootiology of avian influenza virus in Egypt. Regardless of the causes of the recent increase in human H5N1 cases, this situation evolved because of the ineffective control strategy that was implemented. Controlling the situation requires a One Health approach, but certainly the greater share of responsibility now lies with the veterinary side.'\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n[The full publication, including figures, can be viewed at the URL above. This well written and important overview of avian influenza A(H5N1 and H7N9) in Egypt raises serious concern over the increasing prevalence of infection in poultry and humans, especially considering the probable underreporting discussed in the paper. The authors recommend the steps they feel need to be taken to address this increasing public health threat, and the problems with the vaccination program. Recommended reading! - Mod.LK\n\nThe following data, extracted (slightly edited) from the paper's chapter 'Avian influenza in poultry in Egypt', may be of interest:\n\nIn Egypt, a systematic surveillance program for avian influenza viruses has been in place since 2009. Commercial and semicommercial farms, abattoirs, backyard flocks, and live bird markets located in different governorates are sampled on a monthly basis regardless of the presence of disease symptoms in poultry. In each governorate, the same locations are continuously sampled by a poultry veterinarian, who collects one swab sample per bird; depending on the size of the poultry population, as many as 5 birds are sampled per flock. Birds are not randomly selected, and samples also are collected from sick or dead birds found onsite. Samples are mostly from chickens, but ducks, geese, turkeys, pigeons, and quails also are sampled. This program enabled detection of genetic and antigenic changes in H5N1 viruses in Egypt. It provided important epizootiologic data and described the poultry sectors acting as reservoirs of H5N1 viruses. The rate of avian influenza infection during August 2009-July 2010 was 5 per cent, exclusively attributable to H5N1 infection, and was more concentrated in the commercial production sector. From August 2010 through January 2013, the positivity rate increased to 10 per cent, and the infection was detected in all poultry production sectors. In 2011, H9N2 viruses emerged and were detected by this program and other surveillance activities in Egypt. The monthly positivity rate of avian influenza infection from August 2009 through December 2014 is shown graphically (http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/22/3/15-0593-f1) with sharp increases during the colder months (November through March). Emergence of H9N2 virus in poultry and an increase in human H5N1 cases are indicated. After the detection of H9N2 virus in 2011 the positivity rate during colder months was higher than that in the period when H5N1 was the only virus infecting poultry, exceeding 20 per cent in some months. Furthermore, co-infection with H5N1 and H9N2 viruses was frequently detected. The same seasonal pattern was seen with both strains during the period February 2013-December 2014 (http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/22/3/15-0593-f2).\n\nAmong the authors' conclusions: 1) H9N2 virus is co-circulating and co-infecting with H5N1 viruses, 2) H5N1 viruses causing the infections possess some mutations that were rarely seen in the past, 3) the poultry vaccination program is failing. 'However, our perspective was limited to the data available through our surveillance program, which might not be representative of the epizootiology of avian influenza virus in Egypt.

The most recent cases occurred in persons who reported exposure to backyard poultry (70 per cent), bred domestic birds (26 per cent), slaughtered poultry (14 per cent), or were exposed to dead birds (4 per cent)...'\n\nExtent of avian influenza infection in Egypt\n The following data, extracted (slightly edited) from the paper's chapter 'Avian influenza in poultry in Egypt', may be of interest:\n\nIn Egypt, a systematic surveillance program for avian influenza viruses has been in place since 2009. There is no obvious or confirmed reason for this increase, but data indicate the following: 1) H9N2 virus is co-circulating and co-infecting with H5N1 viruses, 2) H5N1 viruses causing the infections possess some mutations that were rarely seen in the past, and 3) the poultry vaccination program is failing. The seroprevalence of H9N2 antibodies detected in the same cohort study ranged from 5.6 per cent to 7.5 per cent, whereas just 1 case of H9N2 infection was reported...'\n\nProposed avian influenza control plan\n Among the authors' conclusions: 1) H9N2 virus is co-circulating and co-infecting with H5N1 viruses, 2) H5N1 viruses causing the infections possess some mutations that were rarely seen in the past, 3) the poultry vaccination program is failing. ' If vaccination is to remain an important tool in the control plan, then the following aspects should be considered: 1) matching vaccine strains to currently circulating strains; 2) matching challenge strains to currently circulating strains; 3) maintaining high vaccination coverage; 4) ensuring vaccine efficacy not only in a laboratory setting but also in the field; and 5) evaluating vaccine efficacy on an annual basis.'\n\n A ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n The avian influenza situation in Egypt is deteriorating, evident in the fact that H5N1 and H9N2 viruses are enzootic in poultry and that incidence of H5N1 and H9N2 infection is increasing. -----------\n'Egypt is one of the few countries where H5N1 virus has become enzootic and is the only country with a high number of H5N1 outbreaks among poultry and cases among human. We summarize surveillance data from 2009 through 2014 and show that avian influenza viruses are established in poultry in Egypt and are continuously evolving genetically and antigenically. Controlling the situation requires a One Health approach, but certainly the greater share of responsibility now lies with the veterinary side.'\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n[The full publication, including figures, can be viewed at the URL above. This well written and important overview of avian influenza A(H5N1 and H7N9) in Egypt raises serious concern over the increasing prevalence of infection in poultry and humans, especially considering the probable underreporting discussed in the paper. An underestimation might result in an overestimation of the case-fatality rate, but it would certainly underestimate the extent of human infection with avian influenza viruses. The rate of avian influenza infection during August 2009-July 2010 was 5 per cent, exclusively attributable to H5N1 infection, and was more concentrated in the commercial production sector. Recently, widespread H5N1 infections in poultry and a substantial increase in the number of human cases of H5N1 infection were observed. AVIAN INFLUENZA, HUMAN (14): EGYPT A(H5N1, H9N2) CDC/EID\n********************************************************\n In Egypt, the number of reported human cases of avian influenza infection appears to be underestimated. After the detection of H9N2 virus in 2011 the positivity rate during colder months was higher than that in the period when H5N1 was the only virus infecting poultry, exceeding 20 per cent in some months. We conclude by highlighting the key components that need to be included in a new strategy to control avian influenza infections in poultry and humans in Egypt.'

Although H5N1 does not usually infect humans, 844 human cases of H5N1 have been reported from 15 countries since 2003.\n\nMost human cases of 'highly pathogenic' H5N1 virus infection have occurred in people who had recent contact with sick or dead poultry that were infected with H5N1 viruses.\n\nH5N1 usually does not spread between people. - Mod.LK\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/55.]", "summary": "A ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n \n\nMost human cases of 'highly pathogenic' H5N1 virus infection have occurred in people who had recent contact with sick or dead poultry that were infected with H5N1 viruses. \n\nH5N1 is a highly pathogenic avian (bird) flu virus that has caused serious outbreaks in domestic poultry in parts of Asia, Africa, and the Middle East. http://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2016/01/05/bird-flu-flying-south-for-the-winter/\n\n\nA medical source at a hospital in the Red Sea governorate has told local media that a woman infected with bird flu died at the Hurghada General Hospital on Tuesday [5 Jan 2016]. \n\nMahmoud Ibrahim, in charge of the Red Sea governorate's Directorate of Veterinary Medicine, said that health awareness campaigns targeting bird flu were ongoing through daily shop inspections.

Ref: VITT/1200 LPAI & HPAI in France\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n1. Disease report\nSince the last update on 16 Dec 2015, more outbreaks in poultry have been reported as a result of increased surveillance in south west France (for the official map, updated 23 Dec 2015, see the source URL; not all outbreaks visible at this scale). To date, there are 61 outbreaks of HPAI H5 (N1, N2 and N9), 54 of which have been reported to the EU Animal Disease Notification System. Six regions are affected: Dordogne (12 outbreaks); Landes (27 outbreaks); Haute Vienne (1); Gers (9); Pyrenees Atlantique (10) and; Haute Pyrenees (2). [For the 24 Dec 2015 updated figures, see commentary].\n\nThe situation continues to evolve, and the French authorities have increased the size of restriction zones to cover more regions (hatched/grey area in map), and this has been adopted by the European Commission under special written procedure (SANTE/7135/2015). Movements of live birds from any control zone are subject to pre-movement testing, which has led to the detection of more infected flocks, but does provide some additional assurance (http://agriculture.gouv.fr/la-liste-des-communes-de-la-zone-reglementee-influenza-aviaire).\n\n2. Situation assessment\nANSES [Agence nationale de securite sanitaire de l'alimentation, de l'environnement et du travail; French Agency for Food, Environmental and Occupational Health & Safety], the French risk assessment agency, has published an assessment of the likely source of infection, limited partial virus gene sequence data, risk to public health, and relevance of restriction measures (https://www.anses.fr/fr/system/files/SANT2015sa0241.pdf).\n\nThe source considered most likely is that LPAI European origin avian influenza viruses were circulating in poultry and have mutated to HPAI, then silent spread has occurred in species which show few clinical signs (Anseriforme poultry) or which have been partially immunised by exposure to related LPAI viruses. This theory is given greater confidence by the knowledge that these LPAI viruses are often detected year after year in this area through the EU poultry survey. The preliminary sequence data suggest that there is a common H5 sequence to the LP/HPAI viruses.\n\nA less likely theory is that multiple LPAI viruses were circulating recently in wild birds, and then, after contact with the poultry, these viruses mutated. It is considered very unlikely that the HPAI viruses were circulating in wild birds, as there have been no reports of such in EU-wide surveys.\n\nOn the restriction measures, there is still some uncertainty around how the viruses are spread from one location to another given the significant increase in recent days of new infected premises, hence the large zone now in place.\n\nOn the public health risk, it is noted that only Eurasian strains of H5N1 HPAI have caused human disease (and derived from a different gene lineage to the viruses involved in the current outbreaks), and even so only for people in very close contact with poultry (during home slaughter for example), and no cases have been associated with H5N2 or H5N9 HPAI infection in poultry. See also ECDC (2015) [at http://ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications/_layouts/forms/Publication_DispForm.aspx?List=4f55ad51-4aed-4d32-b960-af70113dbb90&ID=1411].\n\nNevertheless, the full gene sequences for a multiple number of viruses will need to be determined and analysed before clear conclusions on pathways of origin, length of time the virus has been evolving in the field and implications for zoonotic risk can be concluded, as there may still be re-assortments or genetic adaptation occurring.\n\nBased on limited sequencing for just 3 viruses, the authors concluded there are a number of previously identified mutations which may promote the replication of the virus in the mammalian respiratory tract, but the combination of all these mutations in affecting host range is complex. Infection with any AI virus in particular circumstances of high exposure (such as those operatives in the field who are involved in control measures) cannot be ruled out.\n\nIt should be noted that understanding how widely LPAI viruses are circulating in poultry is important, as this could present a substantially immune population and needs to be considered in control decisions and surveillance design.\n\nIt would be helpful to understand more about the way the 'feeding' duck and geese industry in France is managed and whether this contributes to the spread. The method for raising birds for fois gras production, for example, is intensive and would involve handling the birds frequently, which may increase the likelihood of transmission with shared equipment or poultry handlers.\n\nFrom a trade perspective, we would like to highlight that the new EU Implementing Decision allows a derogation for movement of hatching eggs and day old chicks from the large restriction zone only under written agreement between competent authorities on a case by case basis.\n\n3. Conclusion\nThe publication of the ANSES risk assessment and the new restriction measures are welcome. The risk to the UK as a result of these outbreaks is primarily around pathways which involve lapses in biosecurity or trade routes rather than through wild birds, as these are apparently wholly European origin viruses. However, the situation in France simply reinforces what we already knew, that these LPAI viruses circulate in wild birds and cause occasional spill-over outbreaks in poultry and may be difficult to detect in domestic waterfowl species and which may then mutate into HPAI viruses following infection of galliforme hosts.\n\nWe will continue to monitor the situation closely. We would like to remind all poultry keepers to maintain high standards of biosecurity, remain vigilant, and report any suspect clinical signs promptly, and, in addition, to use the 'testing to exclude scheme' for avian notifiable disease where appropriate for early safeguards.\n\nThe risk level for the UK remains at low, but heightened.\n\n[authors: Professor Ian Brown, Dr Helen Roberts]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[As of 24 Dec 2015, the total number of HPAI (3 serotypes) in 6 south western regions of France has risen to 63, as follows (in brackets, number of reported outbreaks):\nDordogne (12), Landes (27), Haute Vienne (1), Gers (10), Pyrenees Atlantique (10) and Hautes-Pyrenees (3); (from http://www.poultrymed.com/Poultrymed/Templates/showpage.asp?DBID=1&LNGID=1&TMID=178&FID=1825&PID=0&IID=29230).\n\nThe updated (23 Dec 2015) official map, titled 'H5N1, H5N2 & H5N9 HPAI and H5N2, H5N3 LPAI outbreaks in backyard and commercial poultry, France' is available at the source URL. - Mod.AS\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/100.]", "summary": "\n\nThe source considered most likely is that LPAI European origin avian influenza viruses were circulating in poultry and have mutated to HPAI, then silent spread has occurred in species which show few clinical signs (Anseriforme poultry) or which have been partially immunised by exposure to related LPAI viruses. promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[As of 24 Dec 2015, the total number of HPAI (3 serotypes) in 6 south western regions of France has risen to 63, as follows (in brackets, number of reported outbreaks):\nDordogne (12), Landes (27), Haute Vienne (1), Gers (10), Pyrenees Atlantique (10) and Hautes-Pyrenees (3); (from http://www.poultrymed.com/Poultrymed/Templates/showpage.asp?DBID=1&LNGID=1&TMID=178&FID=1825&PID=0&IID=29230).

Disease report\nSince the last update [of 7 Dec 2015], several new outbreaks in poultry have now been reported as a result of increased surveillance in South West France [Ministry of Agriculture], France, 2015; see map at the source URL above]; not all outbreaks visible at this scale]. To date [16 Dec 2015] there are 15 outbreaks of HPAI H5 (N1, N2, and N9) and 7 outbreaks of LPAI H5 (N2 and N3) which have been reported to the EU Animal Disease Notification System and in addition there may be a further 15 cases of HPAI reported on the French Surveillance platform.\n\nSeveral of the outbreaks are linked to one another, according to the disease reports, and the species affected include commercial ducks, geese, and guinea fowl. While ducks and geese are not exhibiting severe clinical signs, the guinea fowl may show severe clinical signs and high levels of mortality as expected for a galliform host infected with HPAI. The developing situation still carries significant uncertainties as the French authorities are using the legislative tools to limit further spread, through the use of restriction zones around each outbreak and enhanced surveillance and restrictions beyond the EU requirements for the Dordogne region as well as several communes in the Landes region, preventing international trade from these areas (hatched area in map). Movements of live birds from any control zone are subject to pre-movement testing, which has led to the detection of more infected flocks, but does provide additional assurance (http://agriculture.gouv.fr/sites/minagri/files/listes_communes_ia_11dec15.pdf)\n\n2. Conclusion\nAs before, there are still many unknowns and a lot of uncertainty. The risk to the UK as a result of these outbreaks is primarily around pathways which involve lapses in biosecurity or trade routes, rather than through wild birds as these are apparently wholly European origin viruses. However the situation in France simply reinforces what we already knew: that these LPAI viruses circulate in wild birds and cause occasional spill-over outbreaks in poultry that may be difficult to detect in domestic waterfowl species and which may then mutate into HPAI viruses following infection of galliform hosts.\n\nWhilst there is uncertainty over the identity of the index case(s) and the pathways for virus evolution (including the genesis of 3 HPAI subtypes) and the host populations/networks in which these occurred, introduction by other transmission pathways from other undisclosed sources cannot be excluded. However, it would appear based on information available to date and knowledge of the biology of these viruses, that the new cases in France may be related. Detailed genetic analyses of the causative viruses will be critical to understanding these events and defining with greater certainty risk pathways and periods for spread of infection. Whether the index case for the LPAI to HPAI mutation(s) has been found is uncertain.\n\nWe will continue to monitor the situation closely. We would like to remind all poultry keepers to maintain high standards of biosecurity, remain vigilant, and report any suspect clinical signs promptly and in addition using the testing to exclude scheme for avian notifiable disease where appropriate for early safeguard.

The government has just announced 2 new cases on 30 Nov 015, according to FranceTV Info. The Veterinary Services Department was alerted Fri 20 Nov 2015 after the death of the 30 birds. Analyses revealed the presence of virus, probably transmitted by wild ducks, according to the prefecture. Survivors were euthanized and the backyard disinfected. The samples were sent to the National Health Security Agency (ANSES), which confirmed on Tuesday the 1st results.\n\n'This is a highly pathogenic H5N1 in poultry, 'appearing corresponding [similar?] to' a strain detected already in Europe that presented a previously LPAI [low-pathogenic] profile,' said the Ministry of Agriculture in a statement. The risk of [transmission] to humans of this strain is not established at this stage. The Ministers of Agriculture, Stephane Le Foll, and health, Marisol Touraine, said 'as a precautionary measure, it will be necessary to evaluate the potential dangerousness of the strain to humans.'\n\nBird flu is however 'not transferable to humans through the consumption of meat, eggs, foie gras, or more generally any food product,' the ministry said. 'This virus has no effect in terms of consumption of anything derived from poultry products,' said Mr Le Foll, also spokesman for the government, from the council for ministers.\n\n'Poultry that have been slaughtered are healthy. Sick poultry do not reach the slaughterhouse,' said Denis Lambert, head of the poulterer LDC, showing its confidence in 'the quality of French veterinary services. We will identify the area and there is no reason to extend it.'\n\nAs expected in this situation, the Government has activated the national health emergency response plan. In Biras a protection zone of 3 km has been set up around the site, [within which] all pets must be confined, including dogs and cats, 'to prevent any further spread,' said Mr. Bay. 2 other Dordogne farms have been placed under special surveillance; the usual checks have revealed high levels of antibodies, suggesting that the birds were in contact with the disease, reported the prefect. [Specifically, these are] breeding geese in Domme, 90 km south of Biras, and a duck farm in Saint-Paul-la-Roche, 50 km north.\n\nThe most recent crisis caused by the H5N1 virus in France dates back to early 2006. After destroying all the poultry in a factory farm in Ain, the government of the time imposed the general containment of birds and free-range poultry held by individuals on the entire territory for 3 months. During this period, 64 cases were confirmed [among the] dead birds found, almost all in Ain. The latest isolated cases were detected in Moselle in the summer of 2007 among swans and wild ducks. Since its revival in Southeast Asia in late 2003, bird flu has killed 449 people out of 844 confirmed cases, mostly in Egypt, Indonesia and Vietnam, according to the latest report of the World Health Organization (WHO).\n\n[Byline: Mehdi Fedouach]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The initial outb5eak of this continuing event was reported to the OIE on 25 Nov 2015 (see 20151125.3819479).\n\nH5N1 HPAI was last reported in France in wild ducks in August 2007 in Lorraine, Moselle, eastern France.

Nearly 1400 poultry birds were culled during a recent H5N1 outbreak in Thach Ha and Can Loc Districts of the central Ha Tinh Province, the provincial veterinary division said.\n\nPreviously, an outbreak hit the household of Phan Nhat Thanh in Phu Loc Commune in Can Loc District on 17 Sep 2015, when nearly 400 chickens and ducks fell sick and died with avian flu symptoms. All samples tested positive for the H5N1 virus.\n\nA week later, authorities detected another outbreak among 1000 poultry birds in Thach Tri Commune in Thach Ha District. The veterinary division said all sick and dead poultry birds were raised in unhygienic conditions and had not been vaccinated against the H5N1 virus.\n\nPhu Loc People's Committee vice-chairman Nguyen Xuan Chuong said that breeders' awareness was inadequate, especially regarding vaccination. Just 2000 of the commune's 10 000 poultry birds have been vaccinated in 2015. This showed that the local authority and the people were not yet involved in disease prevention in the area, Chuong said.\n\nThe division also said the poultry vaccination rate was low, at more than 12 per cent in the province. The rates were even lower in several districts, such as 3 per cent in Can Loc and 2 per cent in Thach Ha. There is, thus, a very high risk of the spread of the H5N1 virus in the coming months.\n\nThe provincial agriculture and rural development department has asked localities to take efforts to prevent the spread of the H5N1 disease, focus on improving communication and poultry vaccination, maintain close supervision, and to handle new outbreaks immediately.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Viet Nam submitted to the OIE on 22 Sep 2015 its follow-up report No 6 on the ongoing HPAI H5N1 epizootic, which reportedly had started on 18 Jul 2015.

Dr Mohammed Ahmed, the executive director of the institute, said that it was the 1st time the flu was found in the 2 eastern states. 'The last cases we stamped out in May [2015], after destroying more than 1.4 million birds, affected only 18 states. Now the 2 states have come down with the disease and brought the total to 20 states,' he said.\n\nHe said that the new cases had been traced to the purchase of birds in Ibadan at the 'point of lay' [when they are about ready to start laying] by some poultry farmers in the 2 states. 'Unfortunately, the young birds came down with the disease, which means that we have not been enforcing the restriction in movement that is a key step in controlling disease.'\n\nWhile advising farmers to be more proactive, he said that the purchase of birds at the point of lay was 'certainly not the best,' because farmers would not know how the birds were raised. He said that purchasing of birds at the point of lay was mostly done by 'lazy' farmers, adding that the attitude was 'very dangerous, deadly, and costly'. He therefore advised farmers to always patronize well established farms that have massive hatcheries and were meticulous on biosecurity. 'The small poultry farms do not take biosecurity seriously. But the big farms have massive investments and do not play with the safety of their birds.'\n\nAhmed also suggested a division of labor among poultry farmers that would enable some to specialize in feed mills, while others to devote themselves to hatchery, point of lay and point of cage. 'When that is done, we shall minimize the current tendency to pounce into all aspects that had consistently proved hazardous.' The executive director called for intensive surveillance by stakeholders in states to curtail outbreak of the bird flu. 'The only way we can contain the flu totally is by consistent surveillance; we must always pick samples from affected areas and areas not affected,' he said.\n\nThe NVRI boss said that the national technical committee on bird flu had suggested to the Federal Government, the establishment of an active surveillance unit and was still waiting for response. 'Once we receive the response and the go ahead, we shall start the active surveillance and I am sure that we shall then be able to check the spread of the flu.' Ahmed said that the institute was also working to protect the nation's birds from Newcastle and gumboro [infectious bursal disease] diseases. 'The Newcastle disease affects younger birds, while the gumboro disease affects the older ones but we are working to ensure none affects us,' he said.\n\nHe cautioned poultry farmers against cluster farms, saying that they would record massive casualties if the disease affects any of the farms. 'The cluster farms situation is particularly bad in Plateau and Kano [states] and we have tried to discourage farmers from it because it is dangerous,' he said. He also spoke on the payment of compensations to owners of farms, whose birds were destroyed, saying that the exercise was in progress. 'The compensation has been spread into batches; batches 1, 2, and 3 have been paid. The others have been verified and payment will resume soon.'\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Maps of Nigeria can be seen at http://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/map/profile/nigeria.pdf and http://healthmap.org/promed/p/62. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ\n\nThe 3 new outbreaks in south west Nigeria were reported to the OIE on 11 Aug 2015, in follow-up report no 10 of this epizootic, which started on 24 Dec 2014.

He said that 800 [suspected samples] were [tested] in the institute's laboratory, out of which 500 tested positive to the disease. The NVRI boss said that compensation for the destroyed birds was already being paid by the Federal Government.\n\n'Payment of compensation for the destroyed birds is already in progress; it started and stopped at a point, but it has resumed,' he said. He observed that the compensation was being handled by the Federal Government and appealed to the states to help by initiating steps to assist farmers.\n\n'Since it is the economies of the affected states that are being largely affected, the states should augment the compensation as they did during the 1st outbreak years ago. The states should specifically help in the design of poultry farms to encourage bio-security of the farms,' he explained.\n\nAhmed particularly warned against cluster farms, and blamed that trend for the large number of birds that had to be destroyed.\n\nThe NVRI boss singled out Plateau and Kano as states with the largest concentration of cluster farms and explained that the flu usually spreads faster and engulfs more birds in cluster farms. He expressed satisfaction that the flu was contained in a few months compared to the 1st outbreak, which lasted from 2006-2008, but observed that more birds were destroyed this time.\n\n'More birds had to go because the production of poultry has changed with the cluster farms. In Rantya, a village in Jos South Local Government, for instance, the cluster farms are very close and heavily concentrated in one vicinity,' he said. Ahmed said that the disease had subsided but 'certainly was not over yet.'\n\n'We are not taking anything for granted and have, therefore, gone into active surveillance. We have already trained people to take samples; their task is to buy and test chickens randomly from farms and live bird markets all over the nation. We are virtually out of the passive, so we must go to look for possible cases. There are states and federal offices and officers to handle surveillance even in the remotest of the rural settlements. Such surveillance is usually the most expensive part of disease control, but Nigeria is being supported by some interventions from the World Bank, FAO, USAID and other development partners.'\n\nAhmed said that the Federal Government was also carrying out forensic investigation to ascertain how the disease came in. 'We are forced to do that because what was diagnosed in NVRI laboratories is not related to previous cases; it is a new introduction all together,' [he] explained.\n\nHe said that there were many speculations, with humans suspected to be possible carriers, while poultry importations could also be a source of disease dissemination.\n\nAhmed, however, expressed happiness that no human case had been found, saying that people tested, including farm workers, proved negative.\n\nThe NVRI boss disclosed that another poultry disease, Newcastle disease, was being zeroed in on for eradication by the international community through vaccinations like Thermostable and MDV12, which are usually targeted at poultry farmers in the hinterlands.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Nigeria has reported to the OIE during 2015 2 separate HPAI H5N1 epizootics within its territory, which are at present officially regarded as 'continuing.'

The victims had reportedly treated their cows early on Tuesday.\n\nFollowing the deaths of the farmers, the town was placed under quarantine, and further measures have been taken in several other villages where bird flu was previously seen.

In addition, hunting activities in the region have also been prohibited.\n\nSpeaking to the press following the incident, Balcali State Hospital head physician Dr Yesim Tasova said that even though the reason for the deaths of the farmers is unknown, they suspect the H5N1 bird flu virus. 'For now, we do not know. The deaths of the 3 individuals happened so quickly. We have sent the bodies for autopsy.

The situation is being technically and expertly handled by the NTCC,' a statement from the Ministry said.\n\nFor the past month, there has been an increase in the mortality of birds, particularly in the Greater Accra Region. On 12 May 2015, the Veterinary Services Directorate laboratory diagnosed influenza type A in a dead bird, which was further confirmed at the Noguchi Memorial Institute as H5N1.\n\nFollowing these preliminary results, a number of interventions have been instituted by the Veterinary Service Directorate and the Ministry of Health in anticipation of the final results.\n\nA further confirmatory result as influenza type A H5N1 was later received from the International Reference laboratory in Italy. Thus, Ghana has been declared as having a bird flu outbreak.\n\nThe statement said although the current bird flu threat to humans remains very low, a screening of the people on the affected farm is being conducted as a precaution.\n\n'All poultry farmers have been alerted to increase their levels of bio-security and to ensure that people do not unnecessarily enter their farms,' it said.\n\nThe statement said the NTCC would continue to organize more education and publicity programmes to educate the public about prevention measures to keep the bird flu disease out of their farms and homes.\n\nAt this stage, the public is assured that it is still quite safe to eat chicken, the statement said, adding that it was not advisable for the public to touch or handle any sick or dead birds with bare hands.\n\nThe public must also report the death of any bird to the nearest local veterinary or agricultural officer whilst desisting from dressing and eating sick or dead birds.\n\nIn addition, poultry products (chicken, turkey, duck, eggs) must be cooked properly (above 70 C [158 F]) before eating, as is the cultural norm in Ghana.\n\nThe statement asked the public to contact the local vet or agricultural officer if they find any sick or dead birds.\n\nFor further information, please contact the Director of Veterinary Services/Head of Public Health (VSD) on 0244289782 or Director of Public Health (GHS), 0244417911.\n\nSince the year 2003, when outbreaks of bird flu (avian influenza) were reported in Southeast Asia, Ghana has continued to monitor the global situation.

The genetic shifts\nof the virus are indeed of great concern to the scientific community, as it is feared that future mutants of the virus may acquire the\npotential for inter-human propagation. - Mod.AB\n\nBetween November 2014 and February 2015, Egypt saw a major rise in the number of human cases of avian influenza A(H5N1). In fact, the number of cases during this period exceeded the number of cases ever found in any country since the disease's reemergence in 2004. In view of the serious risk of a pandemic, the Ministry for Health and Population requested a joint assessment to better understand the recent upsurge, and to provide concrete measures to curb the trend of increasing infection. From 8-12 Mar 2015, a team representing the World Health Organization (WHO), the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (US-CDC), the United States Naval Medical Research Unit 3 (US-NAMRU-3) and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) met in Egypt with key stakeholders and analysed the situation.\n\nThe report of the team included -- among other issues -- the following comments, addressing the epizootic (poultry-health aspects) of the\nsubject:\n\n'A preponderance of the evidence examined by the team suggests that there has been a real and measurable increase in the incidence of H5N1 [in poultry] since June 2014. Between 1 Dec 2014 and 28 Feb 2015, 333 outbreaks in poultry were observed in Egypt, while between 1 Dec 2013 and 28 Feb 2014 there were only 44 reported outbreaks. Reports indicate that H5N1 is circulating in all sectors of poultry production and geographically in all parts of Egypt. The reasons for this increase are clearly complex and multi-factorial; however, certain factors associated with poultry production and disease control provide possible means of strengthening prevention and response. Changes in the economy and poultry industry since 2011 have had a negative impact on food safety and the capacity of the Ministry of Agriculture and Land Reclamation (MOALR) to prevent or respond to outbreaks of disease. With the reduction in control of poultry production nationally, many small farmers have turned to raising poultry for food and income in an unmonitored and uncontrolled farming sector. Evidence suggests that H5N1 virus is deeply entrenched on such farms and in household flocks. Further, implementation of a proper control strategy is currently impeded by weak response capacity, weak public-private partnerships, sub-optimal vaccination strategies and low levels of biosecurity in some poultry production sectors. [There are] 2 excellent national laboratories that contribute significantly to the diagnosis and control of avian influenza -- the National Laboratory for Quality Control of Poultry Production and Central Laboratory for Evaluation of Veterinary Biologics; both could be used more effectively by linking diagnosis with rapid response and monitoring of disease control and vaccine use.\n\nThe national HPAI Integrated National Plan for Avian and Human Influenza that was developed with support from FAO after the 2009 joint-UN evaluation mission addresses many of the current challenges, but has not been implemented. This strategy should be brought up to date and put into force'.\n\nThe report was presented and discussed in posting 20150516.3366602.

(That number, though, is a bit of an undercount, according to FluTrackers, an infectious disease news message board that has been tracking cases closely. FluTrackers, which bases its numbers on official reports, says at least 175 cases have occurred in that period. But either way, the surge is unprecedented in the history of the disease.)\n\n'Based on all the evidence we have, we believe the upsurge is not explained by changes in the virus itself,' said Keiji Fukuda, MD, MPH, WHO assistant director-general for health security and head of the H5N1 investigation team in Egypt, which included WHO, the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF), the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and US Naval Medical Research Unit 3 (NAMRU-3) in Cairo.\n\n'The most likely reason for the increase in cases is that more poultry in Egypt are infected by H5N1 and so more people are exposed to this virus,' Fukuda added. 'Coupled with insufficient awareness, behavioural patterns, and inadequate precautions taken by humans when interacting with poultry, this explains what we are seeing.' WHO noted, 'There are indications that H5N1 is circulating in all sectors of poultry production and in all parts of Egypt.'\n\nThe expert panel determined these factors about the surge of cases:\n- although human-to-human transmission cannot be excluded, key epidemiologic and demographic features of cases did not change significantly;\n- there was no evidence of transmission from patients to healthcare workers;\n- about 70 per cent of cases involved known exposure to infected backyard poultry;\n- genetic sequence data revealed no changes to indicate more efficient human-to-human transmission.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[This report is basically a summary of the executive summary that resulted from an invitation Egypt extended 2 months ago to WHO, the FAO, NAMRU-3, CDC, and UNICEF for a joint investigation of H5N1 in the country, and to make recommendations on containing that outbreak.

In fact, the number of cases occurring in this period exceeded the number of cases ever found in any country since the disease's reemergence in 2004. In view of the serious risk of a pandemic, which is enhanced by the enzootic state of H5N1 in Egypt, the Ministry for Health and Population requested a joint assessment to better understand the recent upsurge, and to provide concrete measures to curb the trend of increasing infection. From 8-12 Mar [2015], a team representing the World Health Organization (WHO), the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (US-CDC), the United States Naval Medical Research Unit 3 (US-NAMRU-3) and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) met with key stakeholders and analysed the current situation.\n\nSummary of findings\n----\n\nAnimal health (Please see in commentary below)\n\nHuman health\n----\nConcomitant with the dramatic increase in the number of poultry outbreaks, there has been an unprecedented increase in the number of human cases detected each month, particularly from December 2014 through February 2015. According to the Ministry of Health and Population, the numbers of H5N1 cases reported for these months greatly exceeded the expected numbers based on historical data.\n\nThis upsurge most likely results from increased exposure of people to infected poultry. Most recent human cases (approximately 70 percent) had exposure to backyard poultry. Children under 5 make up a significantly higher portion of all confirmed H5N1 cases in Egypt (33 percent) compared with the rest of the world (15 percent). Young children and women often are engaged in rearing backyard poultry, which puts them at high risk during poultry outbreaks.\n\nLikewise, the number of human samples being tested for H5N1 has increased compared with [during] earlier poultry outbreaks. Testing has also increased as a result of rapid response by the preventive sector and increased awareness among clinicians.\n\nDespite the unprecedented surge in human cases in Egypt, it does not appear that the risk of an H5N1 pandemic has changed appreciably. This conclusion is based on the following:\n1) although human-to-human transmission cannot be excluded, there has been no change in the size or number of clusters of human cases during the surge compared with previous years;\n2) there is no evidence of transmission from patients to healthcare workers during the surge;\n3) most recent human cases had direct or indirect poultry contact;\n4) genetic sequence data have not identified changes that would make human-to-human transmission efficient.\n\nNevertheless, the presence of H5N1 viruses in Egypt with the ability to jump more readily from birds to humans than viruses in other enzootic countries is of concern and requires a high level of vigilance from the Ministries of Health and Agriculture.\n\nThe Ministry of Health and Population has strengthened multiple disease surveillance [for] influenza-like illness (ILI), severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and avian influenza [which has] generated valuable epidemiological information for this and other important influenza outbreaks. The Central Public Health Laboratory functions well and has provided training for regional and local laboratories.\n\nGenetic and antigenic data from human and poultry samples are being jointly analysed by staff in Egypt along with international counterparts. However, increased real-time sharing and analysis should be encouraged. The 4-way linking platform could be used to accomplish this; it should also meet fortnightly during a surge of cases and every 2 months when there are no outbreaks.\n\nThe Ministry of Health and Population has purchased antiviral drugs (neuraminidase inhibitors) [which] have been made available to clinicians for patients with suspected and laboratory-confirmed infections. This is particularly important to reduce mortality\n\nCoordination and collaboration\nCommunication for behavior change\n\nKey recommendations\n----\nCoordination and strategic planning\nMinistry of Agriculture and Land Reclamation\nMinistry of Health and Population\nCommunication for behavior change\n\nThe way forward\n----\nA successful approach to addressing H5N1 requires long-term, sustainable investments in agriculture, health and communities. In particular, close collaboration between sectors is required in communications, policy development, surveillance and response, and the production and sharing of information. Accurate, regular assessment of the impact of control measures is required to evaluate progress.\n\nThe government should undertake 1 or more pilot projects at the district level to determine which changes in policies and practices are most effective in reducing spread of infection among poultry and to humans and sustainable on a medium- to long-term basis. Addressing H5N1 nationally will require long-term changes in policies, practices, culture, awareness and community engagement.\n\nWithin 3 months, a 2-year action plan that encompasses these recommendations and includes clear outcomes and indicators for monitoring will be developed by the ministries of health, agriculture and local development. FAO, WHO and OIE will support development of the plan, which will be presented to the NSC.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[This Executive summary is the result of an invitation Egypt extended 2 months ago to the WHO, FAO, NAMRU-3, CDC and UNICEF for a joint investigation of H5N1 in the country, and to make recommendations on containing that outbreak.\n\nThe updated H5N1 case count from WHO, which covers reported cases since November 2014 to 30 April 2015,, is 165 cases and 48 deaths. This represents an increase in human cases over what has been observed in previous years in Egypt. Case fatality appears to be lower in Egypt compared with other countries, likely because children are more commonly infected in Egypt. The task of controlling spread of the virus represents a serious challenge to Egypt. While there is no evidence for other than occasional spread from human to human, the risk exists and must be closely monitored.\n\nMaps of Egypt can be found at http://www.geoatlas.com/medias/maps/countries/egypt/eg3r92t/egypt_pol.jpg and http://healthmap.org/promed/p/55. - Mod.LK]\n\n[The executive summary of the mission includes a section on the animal health aspects of HPAI H5N1 in Egypt. The following extracts deserve attention:\n\n'A preponderance of the evidence examined by the team suggests that there has been a real and measurable increase in the incidence of H5N1 [in poultry] since June 2014. Between 1 Dec 2014 and 28 Feb 2015, 333 outbreaks in poultry were observed in Egypt, while between 1 Dec 2013 and 28 Feb 2014 there were only 44 reported outbreaks. Reports indicate that H5N1 is circulating in all sectors of poultry production and geographically in all parts of Egypt. The reasons for this increase are clearly complex and multi-factorial; however, certain factors associated with poultry production and disease control provide possible means of strengthening prevention and response. Changes in the economy and poultry industry since 2011 have had a negative impact on food safety and the capacity of the Ministry of Agriculture and Land Reclamation (MOALR) to prevent or respond to outbreaks of disease. With the reduction in control of poultry production nationally, many small farmers have turned to raising poultry for food and income in an unmonitored and uncontrolled farming sector. Evidence suggests that H5N1 virus is deeply entrenched on such farms and in household flocks. Further, implementation of a proper control strategy is currently impeded by weak response capacity, weak public-private partnerships, sub-optimal vaccination strategies and low levels of biosecurity in some poultry production sectors. [There are] 2 excellent national laboratories that contribute significantly to the diagnosis and control of avian influenza -- the National Laboratory for Quality Control of Poultry Production and Central Laboratory for Evaluation of Veterinary Biologics; both could be used more effectively by linking diagnosis with rapid response and monitoring of disease control and vaccine use.'\n\n'The national HPAI Integrated National Plan for Avian and Human Influenza that was developed with support from FAO after the 2009 joint-UN evaluation mission addresses many of the current challenges, but has not been implemented. This strategy should be brought up to date and put into force. Since 2007, through USAID-funded FAO projects, considerable investment has been made to improve the animal health surveillance system in Egypt, including the establishment of 230 epidemiological units covering almost all districts and governorate; 4 animal disease surveillance systems (passive reporting, community animal health outreach, targeted live bird market reporting, and active surveillance) are maintained by the Veterinary Services.

The virus spreading in the 3 countries is considered to be caused by a novel clade of the A(H5N1) virus, specifically clade 2.3.2.1c, which, according to a recent 'ahead of print' paper (see reference below), most likely entered Nigeria in December 2014. The authors further indicate that the identification of genetic clustering between the strains from Nigeria and the HPAI A(H5N1) viruses originally identified in Asia, suggests an unknown epidemiologic link between these regions, probably associated with human activities, migratory bird movements, or both. They further state that this virus is an intersubtype reassortant which has already caused infection in humans, underlining the urgent need for its complete characterization in terms of virulence and host range.\n\nA map showing all 18 outbreaks in Burkina Faso is available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=17455.\n\nFor further background, please refer to the commentary by Mod.CRD in ProMED-mail posting 20150402.3272825.\n\nReference\n---------\nMonne I, Meseko C, Joannis T, et al: Highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) virus in poultry, Nigeria, 2015 [letter].

Egypt has the highest number of cases of the most infectious strain of bird flu, H5N1, despite being in the midst of its 3rd attempt in 9 years to control the disease.\n\nAccording to experts and documents reviewed by Al-Monitor, previous efforts were undermined ... and the government faces enormous challenges if it is to contain the virus this time around. The Animal Health and Livelihood Sustainability Strategy of 2010, the government's 1st attempt to contain the virus in 2006 through mass culling, vaccinations and compensation for farmers, suffered from poor management, a lack of transparency, widespread conflicts of interest among 'core institutions' and a suspected lack of effective hygienic measures practiced by control teams.\n\nIndustry experts say many of the recommendations of the 2010 report, written in collaboration with the UN Food and Agriculture Organization and approved by the government, were never implemented. Now the government is awaiting a final report on the problem from a broader spectrum of international organizations whose representatives gathered in Egypt in March [2015]: the FAO, the World Health Organization, the World Organization for Animal Health, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, UNICEF and experts from Naval Medical Research Unit 3.\n\nThe WHO confirmed that from January to 31 Mar [2015], Egypt recorded 119 confirmed cases of H5N1, including 30 deaths. China ranks a distant 2nd, with 4 cases and 1 death [from H5N1, but see comment below regarding H7N9]. Indonesia, which at the beginning of the year [2015] was neck-and-neck with Egypt in total cases since 2003, has added just 2 new cases, for a total of 199. Egypt's now stand at 329.\n\nHendrik Jan Bekedam, WHO's Egypt representative, said this year's numbers already put Egypt ahead of all other countries dealing with H5N1, such as China, Indonesia, Vietnam and Cambodia, for any year on record. 'There's never been a country that in 100 days has had more than 100 cases,' Bekedam told Al-Monitor in Cairo. 'So there is something going on over here.'\n\nH5N1 has been found in 20 of Egypt's 27 governorates, and reducing the risk of further outbreaks won't be easy. At the moment, human-to-human transfer of H5N1 is inefficient, but one of the reasons for Egypt's increasing caseload is that many Egyptians live with chickens in their houses and apartments. According to the FAO, 66 of the 76 detected H5N1 outbreaks from 18 Jan through 7 Feb [2015] originated in households.\n\nAnother risk factor, according to health professionals, is the country's live bird markets, which account for a hefty 60-70 percent of domestic consumption, according to Tarek Tawfik, managing director of the Cairo Poultry Group and deputy chairman of the Federation of Egyptian Industries.\n\nBekedam, who was in China during the SARS outbreak in 2003, said that in addition to creating more opportunities to transfer the virus to humans, live bird markets give virus strains an opportunity to 'mingle' with each other. For example, another worrying bird flu strain, H9N2, is circulating among Egyptian poultry, and a boy from the southern city of Aswan tested positive for the virus in January [2015].\n\nIf H5N1 becomes transferable between humans, health professionals are concerned the proximity of millions of Egyptians to chickens will mean an outbreak could spread rapidly. Scientists in the Netherlands found H5N1 is 2-3 mutations away from becoming transferrable in ferrets, which are considered a reasonable proxy for humans. It should be stressed, that this conclusion stems from laboratory work. Bekedam, nonetheless, described the Dutch results as 'scary.' He said H5N1 is 'relatively stable' in Egypt, but also emphasized the need for constant monitoring, because virus mutations are unpredictable.\n\nH5N1 is fatal in 50 percent of cases worldwide. Egypt's survival rates have been noticeably better because a large proportion of infected individuals have been children. According to Bekedam, 'Most of the children under 5 survive. Somehow, their immune systems are better able to cope with the virus than when we get older.' Health professionals also suspect some milder cases of the virus are going unreported because healthcare in Egypt is costly.\n\n'It's a tough one for the people in rural areas,' said Bekeham, adding that for many, poultry do not just offer income, but also a cheap source of protein in an economy that has been in turmoil for years. 'Some of the decisions to reduce the virus are not easy. At the same time, what we do think is certain decisions need to be made.'\n\nPrime Minister Ibrahim Mahlab met with the delegation representing international organizations in March [2015], Bekeham said. The upper echelons of the Egyptian government recognize the seriousness of the problem. 'The political commitment from the government is very promising,' Bekeham asserted. 'It doesn't make the task any easier, but it's promising.'\n\nExperts note that in the past, the government had not committed to reforms that would have reduced the risk of outbreaks in Egypt. 'The government hasn't been heavy handed in enforcement in combating the bird flu,' said Tawfik.\n\nIn 2006, a ministerial decree banned the transport of live chickens between governorates to prevent the spread of the virus, but Egypt was unable to ensure compliance. 'The enforceability was not there, and it is still not there,' observed Tawfik.\n\nThere are also still problems in the design of the compensation scheme for farmers reporting bird flu cases. The scheme is paid for with a 1 percent levy on poultry imports. It has a board, a committee and about 500 million Egyptian pounds (USD 65.3 million) at its disposal. Once a farm reports a case of bird flu, however, it is quarantined for 6 months. According to Tawfik, many small operators choose not to report cases because the compensation would fall significantly short of the earnings lost.\n\nAnother problem is that the political instability since the 2011 uprising has pushed many opportunistic families out of traditional industries like tourism and into temporary chicken farming. Thus, growing numbers of unregistered chicken producers are ineligible for compensation if they get a sick bird.\n\nThe government has little idea how many unregistered poultry operators there are. A geographic mapping company estimated in 2012 that Husseiniya, one of 13 provinces in Sharqia governorate, alone had 860 unregistered farms.\n\nTawfik noted, 'It is very difficult to control the spread of the disease as long as your neighbors are raising chickens on their roof or in their backyards.'\n\n[Byline: Alexander Liddington-Cox]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[While Egypt has been struggling to contain H5N1, China has been battling H7N9, with a total of 141 cases reported in 2015 to date [according to FluTrackers (https://flutrackers.com/forum/forum/china-h7n9-outbreak-tracking/143874-flutrackers-2013-15-human-case-list-of-provincial-ministry-of-health-government-confirmed-influenza-a-h7n9-cases-with-links)]. The same pattern of infection has been observed with the 2 viruses, i.e., association of the infected patients with backyard or live market poultry. Similarly, both avian influenza viruses do not easily spread from human to human. But it is a major concern that the number of potential influenza pandemic virus candidates has increased significantly over the past few years.\n\nMaps of Egypt can be seen at http://www.geoatlas.com/medias/maps/countries/egypt/eg3r92t/egypt_pol.jpg and http://healthmap.org/promed/p/55. - Mod.LK\n\nSince HPAI H5N1 is regarded endemic in Egypt, no follow-up reports on the outbreaks in poultry are submitted to the OIE.

This was the 1st occurrence of H5N1 HPAI in the country since the last epidemic between 2006 and 2008. The virus involved is similar to recent isolates taken from birds in Bulgaria, India and Viet Nam as well as an environmental sample from China.\n\nThe disease has so far spread to nearly 400 enterprises including live bird markets (LBMs) and farms in 9 per cent (71 out of 775) of local government areas (LGAs) in 49 per cent (18 out of 37) of states across Nigeria.\n\nWhile the Nigerian Government has responded by implementing quarantine, culling and compensation, outbreaks continue to be reported. Agro-ecological drivers of HPAI H5N1 similar to those present in endemic regions of South East Asia are present in Nigeria and West Africa, thus implying an increased risk of disease spread in the region. Traditional trading patterns, both formal and informal, between Nigeria and neighbouring countries provide an opportunity for cross-border or inter-regional disease spread. The recent incursion into Burkina Faso only emphasizes this potential risk.\n\nCurrently, countries at immediate risk of spread are Benin, Cameroon, Chad, Ghana, the Niger and Togo. Other countries that had reported outbreaks in the past are also at risk. These include the Republic of Cote d'Ivoire, Djibouti and the Sudan. These countries need to prepare to detect and respond in a timely manner to possible incursions of the disease.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nOlutayo Olajide Babalobi (DVM, MPVM, PhD; FCVSN)\nDepartment of Veterinary Public Health and Preventive Medicine\nEruwa Veterinary (Rural) Field Station\nFaculty of Veterinary Medicine\nUniversity of Ibadan, Ibadan\nNigeria\n<tayobabalobi@gmail.com>\n\n[The following, final section of the above review is copied for readers' convenience:\n\n'Conclusions (and looking ahead)\n--------------------------------\n'The reoccurrence of H5N1 HPAI in Nigeria confirms the constant risk posed by this virus. The poultry in Nigeria and in bordering countries are highly susceptible to HPAI H5N1. All countries are officially free of this disease. It is expected that HPAI H5N1 will spread widely within Nigeria and may affect a high proportion of poultry until effective biosecurity measures are imposed. Continued circulation (that is, persistence) within the Nigerian poultry population is possible, but given previous experience with the disease during 2006-2008, this may be unlikely. The veterinary services of Nigeria have shown their ability to eliminate HPAI H5N1 during the 1st outbreaks of the disease in 2006-2008, and this could be replicated if resources are available to implement control measures.\n\n'Affected areas located in conflict zones such as Kaduna State, where the actions of veterinary services are limited, may result in continued spread. Currently, the outbreak continues to spread, and patterns are distinct from that of the previous epidemic. The current epidemic has spread faster and wider geographically than the previous epidemic (data not shown). Based on this evidence, the risk of the virus spreading throughout Nigeria is high.\n\n'The risk of spread to bordering countries will depend on quarantine controls at land borders with Nigeria that target the various routes through which infection could spread, including the movement of live birds, people or fomites. Establishment in bordering countries will also depend on the ability of the countries' surveillance systems to detect and respond to new incursions rapidly, if they do occur.\n\n'During the previous HPAI H5N1 incursion, almost all countries affected in the region were able to eliminate the disease with international support coordinated by FAO. However, regular training of veterinary services staff in the region in disease recognition, investigation and response is needed.\n\n'The outbreaks in Nigeria are currently concentrated in areas bordering Niger in the north and Benin in the south west. Movement of poultry from northern areas of Nigeria to be sold in the southern areas of Niger has been known to occur. Movement of people from south western Nigeria to Togo through transhumance [seasonal migration of livestock. - Mod.SH] is also likely. Given their proximity to Nigeria (through sharing of the border) and commercial trading links, the following countries are at immediate risk of disease spread: Benin, Cameroon, Chad and Niger. These countries have important poultry industries, and the potential consequences of HPAI H5N1 outbreaks there would be significant. Other countries that had reported outbreaks in the past are also at risk. These include Burkina Faso, Djibouti, the Republic of Cote d'Ivoire and Sudan.\n\n'FAO stands ready to provide assistance to member countries in West Africa to prevent the introduction of H5N1 HPAI to reduce the risk of disease spread and to safeguard vulnerable, livestock-related livelihoods.

He said that the ministry started an awareness and guidance campaign targeting owners of commercial poultry holdings and birds farmers in the Gaza Strip, to introduce them to the disease and its risks and provide guidance in assisting discovery of outbreaks and their control.\n\nKafarneh indicated that the real danger of the disease comes from backyard holdings within the municipalities and not through the intensively kept birds on commercial farms.\n\nKafarneh said that the Ministry of Agriculture focuses on the detection of the epidemic in the northern part of the Gaza Strip area, where the largest numbers of domestic birds are held and should be tightly controlled.\n\nKafarneh explained that the Ministry of Agriculture cooperates with other agencies and organizations to deal with any spread or outbreak of the disease.\n\nThe Ministry of Agriculture in Gaza culled on Monday [13 Apr 2015] about 800 broiler chickens and ducks in the city of Khan Yunis after the discovery of them being infected with HPAI H5N1 strain of bird flu. The crews utilised the assistance of the city's mayor and staff for the implementation of the process, with the participation of doctors from the Ministry of Agriculture.\n\n[Byline: Issa Mohammed]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[As indicated by Dr Kafarneh, the main problem on his and his dedicated staff's hands is the presence of numerous backyard holdings throughout the Gaza Strip, including urban areas. The number of such holdings, each of which may include few birds of various species, is estimated to be counted in figures of 5 (or even more?) digits.\n\nAs of 2014, about 1.8 million people are living in the Gaza Strip, of which nearly 1.5 million in refugee camps. 90 percent of the population is urban. The most densely populated area is Gaza City, where the density (2014 data) is 6859 people per sq km. Even within the City of Gaza, chickens and other poultry roam around and there are numerous backyard poultry holdings. The per capita income in Gaza is among the lowest in the world.\n\nAs rightly remarked by a subscriber, 'population numbers are not relevant to this strain, since human-to-human transmission is rare.' Indeed it is not the high density of the population in the Gaza Strip which is the main concern; there are other regions worldwide that are characterized by continuous urban area (such as Singapore, Hong Kong, Bahrain, Monaco and even the Israeli Dan district). It is the combination of dense human population, poor hygiene and the close proximity to large numbers of free-roaming or backyard domestic birds which should be of concern in case 'A(H5N1) virus clade 2.2.1.2 with putative human health impact' becomes endemic in Gaza. - Mod.AS]\n\n[Poultry farm in Khan Younis:\nhttp://cache1.asset-cache.net/gc/451189840-poultry-farm-in-khan-yunis-of-gaza-in-west-gettyimages.jpg?v=1&c=IWSAsset&k=2&d=GkZZ8bf5zL1ZiijUmxa7QbnhSTu1MedMYok2gn6lS9kIz59rBsYa%2BexpGTsvYxOlRk5cJUyjBBRiY5uOqQIjvQ%3D%3D - Mod.JW\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/88.]", "summary": "A ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n[1]\n It is the combination of dense human population, poor hygiene and the close proximity to large numbers of free-roaming or backyard domestic birds which should be of concern in case 'A(H5N1) virus clade 2.2.1.2 with putative human health impact' becomes endemic in Gaza. \n\nThe State Veterinary Services have called upon all holders of backyard poultry to keep their birds caged and under cover and to prevent their free roaming in open terrain, to reduce the risk of infection from wild birds. \n\nKafarneh indicated that the real danger of the disease comes from backyard holdings within the municipalities and not through the intensively kept birds on commercial farms. \n\nTeams of the [Israeli] Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development are monitoring poultry coops in Israel's territory adjacent to the affected area of the Gaza Strip, within 10 km distance from Khan Yunis [see comment]. \n\nKafarneh said that the Ministry of Agriculture focuses on the detection of the epidemic in the northern part of the Gaza Strip area, where the largest numbers of domestic birds are held and should be tightly controlled.

Of these cases, 440 have died. Since the last WHO Influenza update on 3 Mar 2015, 42 new laboratory-confirmed human cases of avian influenza A(H5N1) virus infection, including 11 fatal cases, were reported to WHO from Egypt (37), China (3) and Indonesia (2).\n\nOf the 37 human cases of influenza A(H5N1) virus infection reported from Egypt, 14 had onset of disease in February 2015 and the rest had onset of disease in March 2015. The cases were reported from 14 different governorates of Egypt [see table 1 in the annex to the original source]. The age range of the 37 cases is from 1 to 77 years, with a median of 24 years and 38 percent of the cases are under 10 years of age. Almost twice as many females compared to males were affected. 8 of the 37 cases (22 percent) died and all 8 fatal cases were in patients 10 years of age and older. All but one case had exposure to poultry or poultry markets and the exposure history of the 1 case is still under investigation. All cases were hospitalized and all reportedly received treatment with antiviral medication. Contacts of the cases were followed for 14 days and there have not been reports of cases in any contacts of confirmed cases. The newly reported cases included 1 cluster of 2 confirmed cases in a mother and son from Sharkia governorate. The 2 cases had onset of illness on the same day and both had exposure to backyard poultry, suggesting common exposure.\n\nCurrently, there are reports of an increased number of outbreaks and detections of influenza A(H5N1) viruses in poultry in Egypt compared to previous months and compared to this month [April] in previous years.\n\nAlthough all influenza viruses evolve over time, preliminary laboratory investigation has not detected major genetic changes in the limited number of viruses isolated from the patients and animals compared to previously circulating isolates thus far, but further in-depth analysis is ongoing. A new candidate vaccine virus was proposed to better protect against the current circulating H5 clade 2.2.1. viruses (a group which all the recent influenza A( H5N1) virus isolates from Egypt belong to. See http://www.who.int/influenza/vaccines/virus/201502_zoonotic_vaccinevirusupdate.pdf?ua=12).\n\nFor the 4th consecutive month since December 2014, the number of laboratory-confirmed human cases of avian influenza A(H5N1) virus infection in Egypt with disease onset in each month are the highest numbers reported by any country in a single month. The characteristics of the affected population remain essentially unchanged from previous years in Egypt, with females more commonly affected than males and about 1/3 of the cases occurring in children under 10 years of age. The proportion of fatal cases has been consistently lower in Egypt than in other countries, especially in children, although the case fatality rate could change as many cases remain hospitalized.\n\nThe increase in the number of human cases is likely attributable to a mixture of factors, including increased circulation of influenza A(H5N1) viruses in poultry, an increasing number of small poultry farms and household flocks, lower public health awareness of risks and seasonal factors such as closer proximity to poultry because of cold weather and possible longer survival of the viruses in the environment.\n\nChina reported 3 human cases of infection with an avian influenza A(H5N1) virus from 2 provinces. 2 cases were reported to have had exposure to live poultry. 1 of the human cases was a fatal case while the other 2 cases were still under treatment at the time they were reported.\n\nIndonesia reported 2 fatal human cases of infection with an avian influenza A(H5N1) virus, in a father and a son from Banten province. The investigation surrounding these 2 cases indicates that they may have had indirect or direct contact with birds near their residence or in another district they visited prior to their onsets of illnesses. Both cases developed severe disease and were hospitalized but passed away. The last human case of infection with an avian influenza A(H5N1) virus in Indonesia was reported in June 2014.\n\nVarious influenza A(H5) subtypes, such as influenza A(H5N1), A(H5N2), A(H5N3), A(H5N6) and A(H5N8), have recently been detected in birds in Asia, Europe, and North America, according to reports received by OIE. Although these influenza A(H5) viruses might have the potential to cause disease in humans, so far no human cases of infection have been reported, with exception of the human infections with influenza A(H5N1) viruses and the 3 human infections with influenza A(H5N6) virus detected in China since 2014.\n\nOverall public health risk assessment for avian influenza A(H5) viruses: The cases reported from these 3 countries appear to be sporadic cases and the virus is known to be circulating endemically in poultry in these countries. Whenever avian influenza viruses are circulating in poultry, sporadic infections and small clusters of human cases are possible in people exposed to infected poultry or contaminated environments, therefore the additional sporadic human cases would not be unexpected.\n\nAlthough an increased number of animal-to-human infections have been reported by Egypt over the past few months, these influenza A(H5) viruses do not currently appear to transmit easily among people. As such, the risk of community-level spread of these viruses remains to be low. Although the risk assessment remains unchanged, further studies are needed to understand the risk factors for human infections and the potential role of mild cases if they are occurring. Further analyses on virus isolates from the animal sector and human cases need to be undertaken to better understand if changes in the transmissibility of the virus from animals to humans may be playing a role in the current situation.\n\nFigure 1: Epidemiological curve of avian influenza A(H5N1) cases in humans by reporting country and month of onset.\n\nHuman infection with other non-seasonal influenza viruses\n------------------------\nHuman infections with avian influenza A(H7N9) viruses in China\n------------------------\n\nA total of 631 laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus, including 253 deaths, have been reported to WHO. The majority of recently reported human cases are associated with exposure to infected live poultry or contaminated environments, including markets where live poultry are sold. A(H7N9) viruses continue to be detected in poultry and their environments in the areas where human cases are occurring.

Cases ranged in age from 32 to 80 years with a mean age of 55 years. Of these 20 cases, 15 (75 percent) were male. The majority (18 cases, 90 percent) reported exposure to live poultry. 1 case is a health care worker, who had also poultry exposure. No clusters were reported. Cases were reported from 5 provinces: Anhui (3), Fujian (2), Guangdong (4), Shandong (1), and Zhejiang (10).\n\nThe Chinese Government has taken the following surveillance and control measures\n- Strengthen epidemiological and etiological monitoring and situation analysis;\n- Strengthen case management and medical treatment;\n- Provide information to the public and conduct risk communication with the public.\n\nWHO is assessing the epidemiological situation and conducting further risk assessment based on the latest information. Overall, the public health risk from avian influenza A(H7N9) viruses has not changed. Comparing with the previous 2 months, the infection case number is decreasing and no new infected province has been reported. Further sporadic human cases of avian influenza A(H7N9) infection are expected in affected and possibly neighboring areas. Should human cases from affected areas travel internationally, their infection may be detected in another country during or after arrival. If this were to occur, community level spread is considered unlikely as the virus does not have the ability to transmit easily among humans.\n\nWHO advice\n--------\nWHO advises that travellers to countries with known outbreaks of avian influenza should avoid poultry farms, contact with animals in live bird markets, areas where poultry may be slaughtered, or any surfaces that appear to be contaminated with faeces from poultry or other animals. Travellers should also wash their hands often with soap and water. Travellers should follow good food safety and good food hygiene practices.\n\nWHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event, nor does it currently recommend any travel or trade restrictions. As always, a diagnosis of infection with an avian influenza virus should be considered in individuals who develop severe acute respiratory symptoms while travelling or soon after returning from an area where avian influenza is a concern.\n\nWHO encourages countries to continue strengthening influenza surveillance, including surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns, in order to ensure reporting of human infections under the IHR (2005), and continue national health preparedness actions.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Since details of the individual cases are not provided, it is difficult to tell how many of the 20 cases have been reported previously.

Since 2006, Egypt has reported 336 human cases, according to the World Health Organization (WHO)/Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO).\n\nThe number of laboratory-confirmed human cases of avian influenza A(H5N1) virus infection in Egypt with onsets of illness from January to March 2015 is the highest reported for a 3-month period since the start of the epidemic in 2006. New cases have been reported every month since the surge that started in November 2014 (Figure). No similar surge in cases has been reported in any other country.\n\nAs communicated by WHO, during the recent surge (November 2014 to March 2015), cases have been reported from 21 of the 29 Egyptian governorates. Females represented 60 percent of the cases. The number of fatal cases in Egypt in 2015 is the highest ever reported (Table). The case-fatality rate for 2015 so far is 28 percent, although, for recent cases, the final outcomes may not yet be known. There appears to have been no discernible trend in the case-fatality rate between 2006 and 2015. According to the WHO Regional Office for the Eastern Mediterranean (EMRO; see EMRO report in ProMED mail Avian influenza, human (89): WHO update, Egypt, H5N1 20150409.3287821), despite the recent surge in human cases, the demographic and epidemiological characteristics of the recently reported cases do not significantly differ from previous periods.\n\nThe increase in human cases in Egypt may be attributed to several factors, including increased circulation of influenza A(H5N1) viruses in poultry, lower public health awareness of risks in middle and upper Egypt, seasonal factors such as closer proximity to poultry because of cold weather and possibly longer survival of the viruses in the environment. A high-level joint WHO/FAO/OIE mission to Egypt was conducted in March 2015 to assess the risks associated with the influenza A(H5N1) viruses and to recommend control measures.\n\nECDC assessment\n----------------\nThis ongoing outbreak of influenza A(H5N1) among poultry and humans in Egypt has now caused more cases during one season than has been reported from any other country globally. The virus belongs to a clade [2.2.1] that appears to have been restricted to transmission in Egypt and neighbouring countries for several years. An emergence of a novel cluster within this clade was recently reported, which might explain the increase in poultry infections and/or human cases. No publicly available evidence is available to rule out ongoing human-to-human transmission in smaller clusters of cases, and detailed epidemiological studies are urgently needed.\n\nThe conclusions from the ECDC Rapid Risk Assessment published on 13 Mar 2015 remain valid.\n\nThe increase in human cases of A(H5N1) infection during the winter months 2014-2015 may be due to an increase in the circulation of A(H5N1) among backyard poultry and exposure to infected poultry across Egypt. Identification of such sporadic cases or small clusters is not unexpected, as avian influenza A(H5N1) viruses are known to be circulating there among poultry. Strict implementation of control measures to reduce and eliminate infection in poultry is essential for reducing the risk of zoonotic transmission and human cases. Enhanced human infectivity of the circulating virus and the protection conferred by the poultry vaccines currently in use should be further investigated. Surveillance in poultry as well as in humans needs to be strengthened and, ideally, coordinated. Intervention programmes to reduce virus circulation in the country should be reinforced. Travellers visiting Egypt should avoid direct contact with poultry and birds or uncooked/untreated poultry products.\n\nFigure: Distribution of human influenza A(H5N1) cases in Egypt, by month and year, March 2006 to March 2015\n\nTable: Number of human influenza A(H5N1) cases and deaths in Egypt, by year\n\nSee more at: http://ecdc.europa.eu/en/press/news/_layouts/forms/News_DispForm.aspx?List=8db7286c-fe2d-476c-9133-18ff4cb1b568&ID=1199 and\nClinical Infectious Diseases: http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/60/suppl_1.toc.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[See [2] below for a biological explanation for the surge in cases of H5N1 in humans, even though the New York Times title states a 'lack of explanation!' - Mod.LK]\n\n******\n[2] Egypt: Avian influenza H5N1 surge\nDate: 13 Apr 2015\nSource: New York Times [edited]\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/14/health/egypts-avian-flu-surge-lacks-an-explanation.html?_r=0\n\n\nCases of H5N1 avian flu have been surging in Egypt since the fall [2014]. Egypt has now passed Indonesia as the country with the most human cases in total since the virus was 1st found in Hong Kong almost 20 years ago. About 1/3rd of the 336 cases Egypt has reported to the World Health Organization since 2006 have been fatal. H5N1 avian flu still has killed more people in Indonesia. Despite the sudden unexplained increase -- Egypt has officially reported 125 cases since January 2015 -- the World Health Organization said the country's 'current risk status' has not changed.\n\nNearly all cases still appear to involve contact with poultry; the disease has long been endemic in birds throughout Egypt, where many households have small poultry flocks. Transmission from birds to humans continues to be sporadic, the W.H.O. said.\n\nVirologists have long feared that the highly lethal virus will mutate to become more transmissible among humans, but it is not clear exactly which mutations would do that. A study by Japanese and Egyptian scientists published last week in _mBio_, and noted by the University of Minnesota's Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy, looked at viral genetic sequences found in Egyptian H5N1 victims and the effects of 59 mutations detected in them. When replicated in the laboratory, some of those mutations appeared to make it easier for the virus to attach to human airways cells; other mutations made the virus better at reproducing there.\n\nThat means if the virus circulating in Egyptian birds infects enough human victims, 'it could rapidly adapt to growth in the human airway microenvironment,' the authors of the new study concluded.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The full paper can be accessed at: Y.

MBio. 2015 Apr 7;6(2). http://mbio.asm.org/content/6/2/e00081-15.full.\n\n'Abstract\n--------\nA change in viral hemagglutinin (HA) receptor binding specificity from alpha2,3- to alpha2,6-linked sialic acid is necessary for highly pathogenic avian influenza (AI) virus subtype H5N1 to become pandemic. However, details of the human-adaptive change in the H5N1 virus remain unknown. Our database search of H5N1 clade 2.2.1 viruses circulating in Egypt identified multiple HA mutations that had been selected in infected patients. Using reverse genetics, we found that increases in both human receptor specificity and the HA pH threshold for membrane fusion were necessary to facilitate replication of the virus variants in human airway epithelia. Furthermore, variants with enhanced replication in human cells had decreased HA stability, apparently to compensate for the changes in viral receptor specificity and membrane fusion activity. Our findings showed that H5N1 viruses could rapidly adapt to growth in the human airway microenvironment by altering their HA properties in infected patients and provided new insights into the human-adaptive mechanisms of AI viruses.\n\nImportance\n----------\nCirculation between bird and human hosts may allow H5N1 viruses to acquire amino acid changes that increase fitness for human infections. However, human-adaptive changes in H5N1 viruses have not been adequately investigated. In this study, we found that multiple HA mutations were actually selected in H5N1-infected patients and that H5N1 variants with some of these HA mutations had increased human-type receptor specificity and increased HA membrane fusion activity, both of which are advantageous for viral replication in human airway epithelia. Furthermore, HA mutants selected during viral replication in patients were likely to have less HA stability, apparently as a compensatory mechanism. These results begin to clarify the picture of the H5N1 human-adaptive mechanism.' ... -more\n\nThis is a significant advance elucidating at least one possible explanation for the increased level of transmission of H5N1 being observed in Egypt in 2015. Certainly, there may be other contributing factors as outlined in [1] in the ECDC report, but this is strong evidence of selection for genetic changes in the hemagglutinin (HA) in H5N1 virus strains isolated from infected humans that are associated with phenotypic changes in the virus. The investigators found that H5N1 clade 2.2.1 viruses can rapidly adapt to the human respiratory tract microenvironment by mutations that alter the balance of HA properties in H5N1-infected patients. The study provides new insight into H5N1 evolution in infected humans that needs to be followed up by experimental studies conducted with animal models in a biologically secure environment.\n\nBecause of concern over infection with H5N1, CDC advises travelers to Egypt to follow these recommendations to prevent being exposed to H5N1 (http://outbreaknewstoday.com/h5n1-avian-influenza-outbreak-in-egypt-prompts-cdc-travel-advisory-81499/):\n\nDo not touch birds or other animals: Do not touch animals, whether they are alive or dead; avoid live bird or poultry markets and avoid other markets or farms with animals (wet markets).\n\nEat food that is fully cooked: Eat meat and poultry that is fully cooked (not pink) and served hot; eat hard-cooked eggs (not runny); don't eat or drink dishes that include blood from any animal and don't eat food from street vendors.\n\nPractice hygiene and cleanliness: Wash your hands often; if soap and water aren't available, clean your hands with hand sanitizer containing at least 60 percent alcohol; don't touch your eyes, nose, or mouth. If you need to touch your face, make sure your hands are clean; cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or your sleeve (not your hands) when coughing or sneezing and try to avoid close contact, such as kissing, hugging or sharing eating utensils or cups, with people who are sick.\n\nSince its introduction in Egypt in 2006, avian influenza A(H5N1) virus has been circulating in domestic poultry in the country and has been the source of sporadic human infections. Almost all cases of H5N1 infection reported in humans in recent times have been associated with close contact with infected live or dead birds, or H5N1-contaminated environments, WHO states.\n\nH5N1 is a viral disease of birds. People rarely get H5N1, but when they do, it usually happens after close contact with infected birds (such as chickens, turkeys, geese, pigeons, and pheasants) or their body fluids. Human illness from H5N1 has ranged from mild eye infections and flu-like symptoms to pneumonia and death. H5N1 does not spread easily between people. The risk of H5N1 to travelers is extremely low, according to the CDC. - Mod.LK\n\nMaps of Egypt can be seen at http://www.geoatlas.com/medias/maps/countries/egypt/eg3r92t/egypt_pol.jpg and http://healthmap.org/promed/p/55. - Mod.LK]", "summary": "\n\nFigure: Distribution of human influenza A(H5N1) cases in Egypt, by month and year, March 2006 to March 2015\n\nTable: Number of human influenza A(H5N1) \n\nThe increase in human cases in Egypt may be attributed to several factors, including increased circulation of influenza A(H5N1) viruses in poultry, lower public health awareness of risks in middle and upper Egypt, seasonal factors such as closer proximity to poultry because of cold weather and possibly longer survival of the viruses in the environment. According to the WHO Regional Office for the Eastern Mediterranean (EMRO; see EMRO report in ProMED mail Avian influenza, human (89): WHO update, Egypt, H5N1 20150409.3287821), despite the recent surge in human cases, the demographic and epidemiological characteristics of the recently reported cases do not significantly differ from previous periods. \n\nThe number of laboratory-confirmed human cases of avian influenza A(H5N1) virus infection in Egypt with onsets of illness from January to March 2015 is the highest reported for a 3-month period since the start of the epidemic in 2006.

Using reverse genetics, we found that increases in both human receptor specificity and the HA pH threshold for membrane fusion were necessary to facilitate replication of the virus variants in human airway epithelia.

[1] Egypt: Avian influenza H5N1, ECDC update\n[2] Avian influenza H5N1 genetics\n\n***** Since its introduction in Egypt in 2006, avian influenza A(H5N1) virus has been circulating in domestic poultry in the country and has been the source of sporadic human infections. An emergence of a novel cluster within this clade was recently reported, which might explain the increase in poultry infections and/or human cases. In Egypt, as of 6 Apr 2015, the Ministry of Health and Population has reported 134 human cases of influenza A(H5N1), including 38 deaths. Strict implementation of control measures to reduce and eliminate infection in poultry is essential for reducing the risk of zoonotic transmission and human cases. Almost all cases of H5N1 infection reported in humans in recent times have been associated with close contact with infected live or dead birds, or H5N1-contaminated environments, WHO states. \n\nEat food that is fully cooked: Eat meat and poultry that is fully cooked (not pink) and served hot; eat hard-cooked eggs (not runny); don't eat or drink dishes that include blood from any animal and don't eat food from street vendors. The investigators found that H5N1 clade 2.2.1 viruses can rapidly adapt to the human respiratory tract microenvironment by mutations that alter the balance of HA properties in H5N1-infected patients. This ongoing outbreak of influenza A(H5N1) among poultry and humans in Egypt has now caused more cases during one season than has been reported from any other country globally. Egypt has now passed Indonesia as the country with the most human cases in total since the virus was 1st found in Hong Kong almost 20 years ago. Identification of such sporadic cases or small clusters is not unexpected, as avian influenza A(H5N1) viruses are known to be circulating there among poultry. cases and deaths in Egypt, by year\n\nSee more at: http://ecdc.europa.eu/en/press/news/_layouts/forms/News_DispForm.aspx?List=8db7286c-fe2d-476c-9133-18ff4cb1b568&ID=1199 and\nClinical Infectious Diseases: http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/60/suppl_1.toc. promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[See [2] below for a biological explanation for the surge in cases of H5N1 in humans, even though the New York Times title states a 'lack of explanation!'

Viruses of this cluster may be associated with increased incidence of human influenza A(H5N1) infections in Egypt over the last months.\n\nIn Egypt, highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) influenza A(H5N1) viruses of clade 2.2.1 and their descendants have been circulating in poultry populations since 2006, causing sporadic human infections [1]. Human influenza A(H5N1) infections in Egypt have been reported since the introduction of the virus in 2006 with \u2009204 cases occurring until end of 2014 and a fatality rate of 35.8 percent in laboratory-confirmed cases reported to the World Health Organization (WHO). However, since January 2015, the incidence of human H5N1 cases in Egypt has increased dramatically: as of 21 March 2015, 116 human cases including 36 deaths have been reported to WHO [2]. This study was initiated to analyse molecular properties of H5N1 viruses that have caused outbreaks in poultry in Egypt since summer 2014 and to compare them with published sequences from H5N1 viruses obtained from recent human cases. ...

In addition, there have been heavy losses in poultry due to high infection rates. 435 outbreaks of H5N1 infections in poultry in Egypt are noted in this paper between October 2014 and February 2015, as reported to the National Laboratory for Quality Control on Poultry Production (NLQP) by Egyptian veterinary authorities. Therefore, it cannot be ruled out that this increased level of transmission in the birds in Egypt (which includes chickens, ducks, turkeys and quail) has led to increased exposure of bird handlers and buyers and backyard bird owners, and consequently increased numbers of cases. However, another possibility proposed by this paper is that the genetic changes observed in the 2015 viruses have led to greater transmissibility of the virus. The investigators found that strains analyzed since November 2014 contain distinct fixed mutations in several genome segments PB2, PB1-F2, HA, NA, M1. The emerging cluster identified in this study seems to be predominant across all poultry production sectors and has already caused 1/3rd of all human H5N1 infections reported in Egypt since 2006, in only 3 months of 2015.\n\nBut questions remain -- what are the molecular determinants that increase fitness of these viruses? What are the selective pressures acting on the virus? Are the observed genetic changes random, or is natural selection acting to favor mutations that make the virus more transmissible? Studies of the pathogenicity and transmissibility of these viruses, most likely using the ferret model, need to be conducted to answer the question of whether the genetic changes are affecting the current outbreak.\n\nMaps of Egypt can be seen at http://www.geoatlas.com/medias/maps/countries/egypt/eg3r92t/egypt_pol.jpg and http://healthmap.org/promed/p/55. - Mod.LK]", "summary": "A ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n Amino acid residues distinguishing recently emerging highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) viruses from virus lineages circulating before November 2014, Egypt, March 2015\n Phylogenetic analysis of the HA (A) and NA (B) genes (coding regions) and maximum clade credibility tree (C) based on the HA open reading frame of selected highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) viruses, Egypt, June 2014-January 2015 (n=29)\n\n1.

'We will check the sample from her throat on the 3rd day to ensure that she is healthy,' Tjandra said. 'Overall she is in good condition; she no longer has fever.'\n\nA 40-year-old man from Tangerang died on Tuesday [24 Mar 2015], and his 2-year-old child died on Thursday [26 Mar 2015]. The government suspected the patients contracted the virus from an infected owl while visiting a relative's house in Bogor, West Java [Jawa Barat province].\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The Jakarta Post today (Mon 30 Mar 2015) indicates the 2 family members died from H5N1, which we suspected, but had not been able to confirm when the previous post was made by ProMED (Avian influenza, human (78): Indonesia (BT) RFI, Egypt (SJ) H5N1 20150329.3263924). This news report also indicated that the 2 were believed to have been exposed to poultry when they visited the Bogor home of a relative who owns a small poultry farm. See more at http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2015/03/30/greater-jakarta-two-die-bird-flu-tangerang.html. However, the post above suggests it may have been an infected owl that served as the source of the virus. The National Wildlife Health Center (US Geological Survey) indicates birds in the order _Strigiformes_ (owls) are infected by H5N1 and die from the infection. The role of wild birds in avian flu virus dissemination has been a subject of intense discussion. Most wild birds are thought to become infected when sharing water sources contaminated with the virus, as H5N1 is primarily a gastrointestinal infection in birds, and is generally believed to spread through infected feces. This is probably the case for waterfowl; however, owls, which are opportunistic hunters, likely may become infected by consumption of infected prey. Suggested further reading on the topic of wild bird involvement in H5N1 transmission includes: Tian H et al. 2015.

The father and son died on 24 Mar 2015 and on 26 Mar 2015, respectively, after spending the past week hospitalized in Tangerang and East Jakarta with severe fevers and other flu-like symptoms.\n\n'The result from our laboratory showed that the 2 victims tested positive for avian flu,' said Tjandra Yoga Aditama, chief of the Health Ministry's research and development office on Fri 27 Mar 2015. On 8 Mar 2015, the pair, along with other family members, visited the Bogor home of a relative who owns a small poultry farm, state-owned news agency Antara reported. During their stay one of the fowl reportedly died due to unknown reasons.\n\nHowever, it is not yet clear how or from where the pair contracted the virus, or which strain they have been diagnosed with. Cases of avian influenza, or bird flu, are relatively rare in humans, but usually occur following direct or close contact with poultry.\n\nSymptoms can include fever, cough, sore throat, muscle aches to severe respiratory illness, among others. In severe cases it can lead to death. Other members of the family -- a woman and child -- have been tested and found negative for the virus, Tjandra said.\n\n[Byline: Herman Genie]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[In mid-June 2014, Indonesia reported 197 cases of human avian influenza infections, making it the country with the highest number of H5N1 cases at that time. Egypt and Viet Nam followed with 175 and 127 cases, respectively. In 2015, Egypt leads the world with the greatest number of H5N1 cases, with no cases reported yet this year (2015) from Indonesia, with the possible exception of these 2 cases. No information is available on the actual strain of avian influenza that led to the death of these 2 individuals, although H5N1 is suspected from the circumstances. Nonetheless, with the number of avian influenza strains circulating in bird populations, other possibilities certainly exist and ProMED welcomes any further information a knowledgeable source may have on the details of the viral strain implicated in these 2 fatal cases.\n\nAvian influenza is an infectious viral disease that routinely affects birds. The 1st H5N1 human infection was documented in China in 1997. Transmission of the virus is from bird to bird, through contact with saliva, mucosal secretions, or feces. However, transmission can also occur from bird to human in situations where individuals have close contact with infected birds. There is no evidence that it can be spread through properly cooked food products.\n\nMaps of Indonesia may be accessed at http://www.geographicguide.com/pictures/maps/indonesia-map.jpg and http://healthmap.org/promed/p/22597. - Mod.LK]\n\n******\n[2] Egypt (Sohag): avian influenza human H5N1 fatality\nDate: Sun 29 Mar 2015\nSource: Egypt Independent, edited translation from Al-Masry Al-Youm [edited]\nhttp://www.egyptindependent.com//news/egypt-bird-flu-death-toll-16-2015\n\n\nA 27-year old woman who raised birds in her home in the Sohag governorate, died of bird flu on Sun 29 Mar 2015.\n\nTahta Fevers Hospital received the victim, who was suffering from bird flu symptoms, before she was transferred to Assiut Fevers Hospital upon the request of her family, according to a medical source at Tahta hospital.\n\nA medical team inspected the woman's house in Tahta and conducted tests on those who were in contact with the woman as a preventive measure.\n\nThe Al-Arabiya news website quoted Local Development Minister Adel Labib on 11 Mar 2015 as saying that the total bird flu death toll in Egypt since the start of the winter season in September 2014 amounted to 33 victims.\n\nThe largest number of victims during that time were in Sharqiya with 10 deaths, followed by Assiut with 7 victims, according to Labib.\n\nThe spread of the H5N1 virus is facilitated by the large number of unlicensed poultry farms outside the scope of supervision by the Agriculture Ministry, in addition to the lack of awareness among people who breed birds in their houses.\n\nThe death rate from bird flu is 37.4 percent in Egypt, compared to 55 percent on the international level, particularly in China.\n\nAccording to the State Information Service, around 2 million people working in the poultry industry and 8 million of their relatives have been affected since the emergence of bird flu in Egypt.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[While the number of deaths (33) in this report is close to the number reported by WHO (17 Mar 2015, and ProMED Avian influenza, human (77): China report week 12, H5N1, Viet Nam, Egypt 20150326.3255017), the number of cases estimated from the reported death rate of 37.4 per cent is significantly lower than that reported by WHO, that is, 116 cases (36 deaths) for the year. FluTrackers lists this case as number 120, closer to the WHO record for H5N1 in Egypt.

Human cases of H5N1 avian influenza occur occasionally, but it is difficult to transmit the infection from person to person. When people do become infected, the mortality rate is about 60 per cent.\n\nAlmost all cases of H5N1 infection in people have been associated with close contact with infected live or dead birds, or H5N1-contaminated environments. The virus does not infect humans easily, and spread from person to person appears to be unusual.

In their view, more widespread circulation of H5N1 in poultry during this time, combined with the large number of households that keep small flocks with poor understanding of the associated health risks, is the most likely explanation for this spurt in new cases.\n\nThis observation, in turn, signals an urgent need for agricultural investigations to identify and reduce the source of this heavy viral contamination. A 2nd motivation is the very real risk that poultry trade, whether legal or illegal, will introduce the virus to new countries.

The GDPM representative advised local authorities to cooperate with the healthcare sector for early detection of new H1N1 flu cases so that they will be isolated, diagnosed and treated promptly.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Excerpted from WHO Western Pacific Region (http://www.wpro.who.int/vietnam/topics/avian_influenza/factsheeth5n1october2012/en/):\n\nViet Nam has had an active control programme against H5N1 avian influenza since the disease was first detected in 2003. This control programme has been successful, and cases of H5N1 in poultry and people have declined progressively and dramatically; however, many challenges remain.\n\nViet Nam's strong commitment to fight highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) is the major factor behind the success for containment of the disease. Several donors and agencies, including the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and World Health Organization (WHO), have been supporting the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD) and the Ministry of Health (MOH) since the 1st HPAI outbreak in 2003 and continue to do so.\n\nH5N1 is a disease agent that has spread across many borders, and Viet Nam is no exception. Viet Nam has trade links with neighbouring countries, and formal or informal trade in poultry across the borders is known to introduce new diseases or new strains in a country.\n\nHighly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) infections in humans are generally caused by bird-to-human transmission of the virus and are rare and sporadic events, occurring mostly in areas where the virus is circulating endemically in poultry. The majority of human cases of H5N1 infection have been associated with direct or indirect contact with infected live or dead poultry.\n\nMaps of Viet Nam may be accessed at http://www.onlineasiatravel.com/images/vn/vietnam-map.png and http://healthmap.org/promed/p/44940. - Mod.LK]\n\n******\n[4] Egypt: avian influenza H5N1, WHO\nDate: Tues 24 Mar 2015\nSource: Outbreak News Today [edited]\nhttp://outbreaknewstoday.com/egypt-h5n1-avian-influenza-tally-is-116-for-2015-to-date-56314/\n\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) in a report from 21 Mar 2015 says the number of avian influenza A(H5N1) cases in Egypt stands at 116, including 36 deaths for the period of 1 Jan 2015 to 17 Mar 2015. This accounts for 36 percent of the total H5N1 avian influenza cases reported in Egypt since 2006.\n\nSince it was first reported in March 2006, a total of 318 human cases of avian influenza A(H5N1), including 112 related deaths (case fatality rate = 35.2 per cent) have been reported in Egypt.\n\nSince its introduction in Egypt, avian influenza A(H5N1) virus has been circulating in domestic poultry in the country and has been the source of sporadic human infections. Almost all cases of H5N1 infection in humans have been associated with close contact with infected live or dead birds or H5N1-contaminated environments.\n\nThough the number of cases reported is higher compared to last year [2014], the increase in the number of cases does not change the current risk status of avian influenza A(H5N1) virus that is currently circulating at the animal-human interface in the country.\n\nFrom 8-12 Mar 2015, a joint high level mission was conducted in Egypt comprising representatives of WHO, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, World Organisation for Animal Health, US Naval Medical Unit-3, and UNICEF on the current H5N1 situation in Egypt and to understand the current and future risks of transmission of the currently circulating avian influenza viruses.

Human infection with avian influenza A(H5N1) virus, Egypt -- first update. 13 Mar 2015. Stockholm: ECDC; 2015 is available online at the URL above for no cost.\n\nIt summarises the epidemiological, virological and environmental information about human infections with avian influenza A viruses of subtype A(H5N1) in Egypt; and assesses potential changes in the risk to public health in the EU/EEA and to EU/EEA citizens. The report includes: Disease background information (Human and avian surveillance of A(H5N1) in Egypt, Human and avian surveillance of A(H5N1) in Europe), Event background information (Human cases in the world, Human cases in Egypt, Situation of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus A(H5N1) in birds, Situation of highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) in birds in Egypt, A(H5N1) virus characteristics and circulating A(H9N2) in Egypt, Virus transmission and risk factors), ECDC threat assessment for the EU, Conclusions. The Abstract and Conclusions are posted below.\n\nAbstract\n--------\nHuman cases and fatalities due to influenza A(H5N1) virus continue to increase in Egypt, with cases from the country now accounting for the highest number of human cases reported worldwide.\n\nContinuous increase of virus circulation in backyard poultry and exposure to infected poultry are most probably contributing to the increase in human cases. Whenever avian influenza viruses circulate in poultry, sporadic infections and small clusters of human cases are possible in people exposed to infected poultry or contaminated environments.\n\nAlthough Egypt has reported an increased number of animal-to-human infections over the past few months, the influenza A(H5) viruses do not appear to transmit easily among people, and no sustained human-to-human transmission has been observed. As such, the risk of these viruses spreading in the community remains low.\n\nIncreased human infectivity of the circulating virus and the protection conferred by the poultry vaccines currently in use should be further investigated.\n\nThe current assessment remains that there is no risk for the general public in the EU. Travellers from the EU should avoid direct contact with poultry or poultry products when travelling to Egypt.\n\nThere is a low but ongoing and continuous risk of the virus being introduced and cases being imported into Europe and therefore both veterinary and public health authorities should maintain preparedness.\n\nConclusions\n-----------\nThe recently reported increase in human cases of A(H5N1) infection during the winter months 2014-2015 may be due to an increase in the circulation of A(H5N1) among backyard poultry and exposure to infected poultry across Egypt. Identification of such sporadic cases or small clusters is not unexpected as avian influenza A(H5N1) viruses are known to be circulating among poultry within the country. Strict implementation of control measures to reduce and eliminate infection in poultry is essential for reducing the risk of zoonotic transmission and human cases. Enhanced human infectivity of the circulating virus and the protection conferred by the poultry vaccines currently in use should be further investigated. Surveillance in poultry as well as in humans needs to be strengthened and, ideally, coordinated. Intervention programmes to reduce virus circulation in the country should be reinforced.\n\nTravellers visiting Egypt should avoid direct contact with poultry and birds or uncooked/untreated poultry products.\n\nTable 1.

He wrote [edited]: 'The line list of H5N1 cases from the 2015 monthly WHO reports enumerates 82 H5N1 cases in 2015. There is a discrepancy in the WHO cumulative table for H5N1 case counts in Egypt in 2014 and 2015. In the table, the 2014 case count is short 6 cases (based on onset dates) while the 2015 count (through 3 March 2015) is over counted by 6 cases. A link to the list of the 82 cases from Egypt in 2015 is included in my [the Editor's] blog post -- http://novel-infectious-diseases.blogspot.com/2015/03/egypt-leads-world-in-number-of-human.html.' In this blog post, he wrote [edited]: 'In late December 2014, Egypt surpassed Indonesia in the number of reported A(H5N1) cases.[1] As of 3 Mar 2015, the World Health Organization (WHO) has confirmed a worldwide cumulative total of 784 human H5N1 cases, about 37 per cent or 292 of these cases have been reported from Egypt (Table 1 [in the blog post]). 82 of those cases from Egypt occurred in the 1st 2 months of 2015 [2]. In addition, media reports suggests that another 4 cases have occurred since late February [2015] in Egypt and may be included in future monthly updates by WHO [3].\n\n'The recent WHO report from 3 Mar 2015 notes, 'The number of laboratory-confirmed human cases of avian influenza A(H5N1) virus infection in Egypt with onsets of illness in the months of December 2014, January and February 2015 are the highest numbers reported by any country in a single month.' To put these statistics in perspective, about 36 per cent of all H5N1 cases reported from Egypt have occurred in the last 3 months. The graph [in the blog post] shows the distribution of WHO confirmed cases by ISO week number in Egypt since December 2014.\n\n'Based on onset dates, since December 2014, there have been 105 H5N1 cases reported from Egypt. According to WHO, at least 28 of these individuals have died. The fatality rate among this group is 27 percent to date, although only 17 of these cases have been reported in media reports to have recovered.\n\n'Besides the 82 cases from Egypt since the beginning of 2015, only 1 other case of H5N1 has been confirmed by WHO in 2015, a 37-year-old woman from Suzhou, Jiangsu Province in the People's Republic of China. With 83 cases so far this year, the H5N1 case count for 2015 already exceeds the annual case count of H5N1 for the preceding 7 years [4]. [However, as posted in ProMED-mail (Avian influenza, human (70): China (SC) H5N1 20150313.3228528), the Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) on 13 Mar 2015 received notification from the National Health and Family Planning Commission (NHFPC) of a 2nd human case of avian influenza A(H5N1) affecting a man aged 46 in Sichuan, China. - Mod.LK]\n\n'While the spotlight is on human H5N1 infections in Egypt, the single case from Suzhou, China [and the 2nd case in Sichuan] is a reminder that the H5N1 influenza virus is endemic in many parts of the world and that human outbreaks of H5N1 in the size and the scope now occurring in Egypt could quickly develop elsewhere in the world.'\n\nReferences\n----------\n1.

[However, as posted in ProMED-mail (Avian influenza, human (70): China (SC) H5N1 20150313.3228528), the Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) on 13 Mar 2015 received notification from the National Health and Family Planning Commission (NHFPC) of a 2nd human case of avian influenza A(H5N1) affecting a man aged 46 in Sichuan, China. The recently reported increase in human cases of A(H5N1) infection during the winter months 2014-2015 may be due to an increase in the circulation of A(H5N1) among backyard poultry and exposure to infected poultry across Egypt. \n\n'Besides the 82 cases from Egypt since the beginning of 2015, only 1 other case of H5N1 has been confirmed by WHO in 2015, a 37-year-old woman from Suzhou, Jiangsu Province in the People's Republic of China.

He developed a cough and chest discomfort on 18 Feb 2015. He attended a local hospital on 21 Feb 2015 and passed away on 27 Feb 2015.

Of these cases, 429 have died.\n\nSince the last WHO Influenza update on 26 Jan 2015, 66 new laboratory-confirmed human cases of avian influenza A(H5N1) virus infection, including 13 fatal cases, were reported to WHO from Egypt (65) and China (1).\n\nOf the 65 human cases of influenza A(H5N1) virus infection reported from Egypt, 29 had onset of disease in January [2015] and the rest had onset of disease in February [2015]. The cases were reported from 18 different governorates of Egypt (see table 1 in URL below). The age range of the 65 cases is from 1 to 75 years, with a median of 26 years, and 23 per cent of the cases are under 10 years of age. All cases had exposure to poultry or poultry markets, were hospitalized and all but one reportedly received treatment with antiviral medication. Of the newly reported cases, there was 1 cluster which included 2 confirmed cases in a mother and daughter from Fayoum governorate. The mother had an onset of illness 2 days prior to the daughter's onset of illness and both had exposure to backyard poultry.\n\nCurrently, there are reports of an increased number of outbreaks and detections of influenza A(H5N1) viruses in poultry in Egypt compared to previous months and compared to this month in previous years.\n\nThe number of laboratory-confirmed human cases of avian influenza A(H5N1) virus infection in Egypt with onsets of illness in the months of December 2014, January and February 2015 are the highest numbers reported by any country in a single month. Although all influenza viruses evolve over time, preliminary laboratory investigation has not detected major genetic changes in the viruses isolated from the patients or animals compared to previously circulating isolates, but further in-depth analysis is ongoing. A new candidate vaccine virus was proposed to better protect against the current circulating H5 clade 2.2.1. viruses (a group which all the recent influenza A( H5N1) virus isolates from Egypt belong to; see http://www.who.int/influenza/vaccines/virus/201502_zoonotic_vaccinevirusupdate.pdf?ua=1).\n\nThe increase in the number of human cases is likely attributable to a mixture of factors, including increased circulation of influenza A(H5N1) viruses in poultry, lower public health awareness of risks in middle and upper Egypt and seasonal factors such as closer proximity to poultry because of cold weather and possible longer survival of the viruses in the environment. A high-level joint WHO/FAO/OIE mission to Egypt to assess the risks associated with the influenza A(H5N1) viruses and to recommend control measures is planned for early March 2015.\n\nChina reported a human infection with an avian influenza A(H5N1) virus in a 37-year-old woman from Jiangsu province. She developed symptoms on 14 Jan 2015, was admitted to hospital on 20 Jan [2015]. The patient had a history of exposure to poultry. No further cases among contacts were reported. [This was the 1st report of human infection with A(H5N1) in China in 2015.]\n\nChina reported a human infection with an avian influenza A(H5N6) virus in a 44-year-old man from Yunnan province. He developed symptoms on 27 Jan 2015, was admitted to hospital on 3 Feb [2015], and passed away on 6 Feb [2015]. The patient had a history of exposure to dead wild birds. No further cases among contacts were reported. This is the 3rd human case of influenza A(H5N6) reported from China.\n\nVarious influenza A(H5) subtypes, such as influenza A(H5N1), A(H5N2), A(H5N3), A(H5N6) and A(H5N8), have recently been detected in birds in Europe, North America, and Asia, according to reports received by OIE. Although these influenza A(H5) viruses might have the potential to cause disease in humans, so far no human cases of infection have been reported, with exception of the human infections with influenza A(H5N1) viruses and the 3 human infections with influenza A(H5N6) virus detected in China since 2014.\n\nOverall public health risk assessment for avian influenza A(H5) viruses\n---------------------------\n\nWhenever avian influenza viruses are circulating in poultry, sporadic infections and small clusters of human cases are possible in people exposed to infected poultry or contaminated environments. Although an increased number of animal-to-human infections have been reported by Egypt over the past few months, these influenza A(H5) viruses do not currently appear to transmit easily among people. As such, the risk of community-level spread of these viruses remains to be low.\n\nSee Figure 1 in url below: Epidemiological curve of avian influenza A(H5N1) cases in humans by reporting country and month of onset.\n\nFrom: WHO: Influenza at the human-animal interface, summary and assessment as of 3 Mar 2015 [edited]\nhttp://www.who.int/influenza/human_animal_interface/HAI_Risk_Assessment/en/\n\nDespite being the probable birthplace of H5N1, and having both the world's largest population and the greatest number of poultry -- for reasons that are less than clear -- China remains only 5th on the list of countries with the most reported human H5N1 cases, trailing well behind Egypt, Indonesia, Vietnam and Cambodia.\n\nThis disparity is even greater when you factor in the differences in population, making the incidence of H5N1 in Egypt more than 90 times higher (per capita) than reported in China.\n\nWhy this should be so isn't known, although some of the theories offered include:\n- Differences in H5N1 clades in circulation (China is predominantly 2.3.2 & 2.3.4 while Egypt is 2.2.1)\n- Differences in how poultry are kept and raised between the 2 countries\n- Suspected weaknesses or deficits in surveillance and reporting from within China\n\nWhatever the reason, over the past 5 years China has only reported an average of 2 human H5N1 cases a year.\n\nExcerpted from Avian Flu Diary (http://afludiary.blogspot.com/), Michael Coston [editor]\n\nMaps of China can be seen at http://www.sacu.org/maps/provmap.png and http://healthmap.org/promed/p/11274.\n\nThe provinces of China may be viewed at http://www.china-mike.com/china-travel-tips/tourist-maps/china-provinces-map.\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/155. - Mod.LK]", "summary": "\n\nWhy this should be so isn't known, although some of the theories offered include:\n- Differences in H5N1 clades in circulation (China is predominantly 2.3.2 & 2.3.4 while Egypt is 2.2.1)\n- Differences in how poultry are kept and raised between the 2 countries\n- Suspected weaknesses or deficits in surveillance and reporting from within China\n\nWhatever the reason, over the past 5 years China has only reported an average of 2 human H5N1 cases a year.

Thousands of birds have been culled in an attempt to contain the epidemic, particularly in Monywa, a town west of Mandalay, in the north western region of Sagaing. Since the beginning of the month [February 2015], when the 1st signs of bird flu appeared on a poultry farm in the area, more than 1400 chickens and about 10 000 quail have died from the H5N1 virus. As a precautionary measure, the authorities ordered the culling of another 1500 samples of poultry and over 20 000 quail. In the area there are more than 300 companies engaged in the production of poultry and 100 in quail, for a total of 140 000 chickens and more than 500 thousand quails.'

According to the official information submitted for this H5N1 event, only 350 birds were reported dead (including both chickens and quail), whereas the media reports '1400 chickens and about 10 000 quail' dead. There is also a discrepancy in the number of birds slaughtered or destroyed between the 2 reports.

The delegation will be headed by Dr Keiji Fukuda, assistant director-general of the (WHO) for Health Security Affairs, according to Adawy.\n\nIn 2006, Egypt reported the 1st avian influenza case, and since then new outbreaks have occurred every year, 'making it one of the world's few endemic countries for the virus with a case fatality rate of 36 per cent,' according to a WHO report. Egypt is one of the 6 nations suffering from an outbreak of H5N1 avian influenza alongside Bangladesh, China, India, Indonesia, and Viet Nam, the report added.\n\nOn 14 Feb [2015], a 35 year old man died of H5N1 avian flu in Cairo, marking the 11th death in the country from the disease in 2015, according to the Health Ministry. The death toll reached 10 in 2014.\n\nMost avian flu cases in Egypt have been detected in impoverished rural areas, where villagers traditionally raise poultry on the rooftops of their homes to supplement their diet, Ahmed Abdel Hamed, a former health ministry official previously told Youm7.\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The reports of numbers of cases and deaths in 2015 in Egypt are discrepant among various groups reporting, with Egyptian authorities listing the fewest cases.

The number of cases over this period is larger than yearly totals reported by any country since human H5N1 virus infections re-emerged in late 2003.\n\nAccording to FAO, a total of 76 outbreaks of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza were detected in 20 of Egypt's 27 governorates between 18 Jan 2015 and 7 Feb 2015.

'Nothing about influenza is predictable -- including where the next pandemic might emerge and which virus might be responsible,' the United Nations health agency warned while noting the next pandemic could be worse than the 2009 swine flu outbreak that killed over 284 000.\n\nThis year's [2015] seasonal flu season has been bad in many parts of the world, with Asia, the Americas, and Europe reporting high levels of circulating flu viruses and low levels of protection from vaccines that did not match the relevant strains.\n\nThe health organisation is particularly concerned about avian influenza noting that the diversity and geographical distribution of influenza viruses currently circulating in wild and domestic birds are unprecedented. 'The world needs to be concerned,' it said.\n\nThe highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus, which has been causing poultry outbreaks in Asia almost continuously since 2003 and is now endemic in several countries, is the influenza virus of greatest concern for human health. Over the past 2 years, H5N1 has been joined by newly detected H5N2, H5N3, H5N6, and H5N8 strains, all of which are currently circulating in different parts of the world.\n\nPraising virological research that had increased capability to detect, understand, and assess new viruses for pandemic risk, and to track their international spread, WHO noted that this has to be stepped up. More antiviral medicines, including peramivir and laninamivir as well as oseltamivir and zanamivir, are now available to treat influenza and reduce the duration and severity of infection. But better vaccines and shorter production times are required. More people would die in the 3 to 4 months currently needed to manufacture vaccines.\n\n[byline: Jayalakshmi K]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Maps of Egypt can be seen at http://www.geoatlas.com/medias/maps/countries/egypt/eg3r92t/egypt_pol.jpg and http://healthmap.org/promed/p/55. - Mod.LK]", "summary": "A ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n \n\n[byline: Jayalakshmi K]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n< \n\nThe highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus, which has been causing poultry outbreaks in Asia almost continuously since 2003 and is now endemic in several countries, is the influenza virus of greatest concern for human health.

It is a different strain from that in China, Asia and Egypt.\n\nA green-winged teal shot by a hunter in northern Washington state has tested positive for H5N1 bird flu -- a relative of the virus that's infected nearly 700 people globally and killed 400 of them.\n\nIt's the 1st case of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza ever seen in the US. The good news is that the strain is genetically different from the strain that's circulated in China, across Asia and most recently in Egypt. It doesn't appear to have infected any people or even domestic poultry.\n\nBut it shows that wild migrating birds can carry dangerous viruses to the US, says Hon Ip, an expert on wildlife pathogens at the US Geological Survey in Madison, Wisconsin.\n\nThe US Department of Agriculture will need to keep a close eye out for other birds with H5N1, Ip said.\n\n'USDA and the Department of the Interior are going to have to spend time to understand the implication of this introduction,' Ip told NBC News. 'At the moment, we do not know of a single human case with our H5.'\n\nFlu is a mutation-prone virus and there are hundreds of strains. Even with precise-sounding names such as H5N1, there can be a large degree of genetic variation. Scientists are watching for mutations and other genetic changes that can make a virus strain more likely to infect people and poultry.\n\nThe H5N1 that most people are worried about has killed or forced the destruction of hundreds of millions of chickens around the world. It occasionally infects people, and the fear is it will mutate into a form that makes it pass easily from person to person. That would spark a pandemic that could kill millions.\n\nSince 2006, Ip's lab has been watching for H5N1 and other strains of bird flu in wild migrating birds along the US west coast, as well as in Alaska and Maine. They've found many different types -- most recently a pathogenic strain of H5N8, as well as many non-pathogenic strains that don't appear to make birds sick.\n\nTo make matters more complicated, this strain of H5N1 found in the teal appears to be a mix of H5N1 and the H5N8 found in Washington state and elsewhere in the US as well as in Europe, South Korea, Japan and Taiwan.\n\nThat makes it of concern to poultry farmers but not to people -- yet, Ip says. 'But because the H5 comes from the Asian H5N1, I would say the risk is not zero,' Ip adds.\n\nA wild bird can infect domestic flocks, which is why agriculture officials are on high alert. And infected domestic birds can infect people. Wild birds can infect hunters and other people who come into contact with them.\n\n'Whenever avian influenza viruses are circulating in poultry, sporadic infections or small clusters of human cases are possible in people exposed to infected poultry or contaminated environments, especially in households,' the World Health Organization says. 'Human infections remain rare and these influenza A(H5N1) viruses do not currently appear to transmit easily among people. As such, the risk of community-level spread of these viruses remains low.'\n\n[Byline: Maggie Fox]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Is this really the 1st time a US duck has had highly pathogenic influenza?

Or maybe it is only the 1st time we have identified this strain in a US duck?\n\nRegardless, many have long suspected that migrating birds are capable of transmitting viruses such as this one over long distances and infecting commercial flocks.\n\nIncreased surveillance and biosecurity in commercial poultry operations in the United States needs to be maintained and/or strengthened to prevent an introduction into commercial poultry flocks.\n\nThis outbreak was previously reported in an OIE report, posted on ProMED-mail as posting 20150122.3109001.\n\nWashington state can be located on the map at http://healthmap.org/promed/p/248. - Mod.TG]", "summary": "A ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n \n\n'Whenever avian influenza viruses are circulating in poultry, sporadic infections or small clusters of human cases are possible in people exposed to infected poultry or contaminated environments, especially in households,' the World Health Organization says.

The infected holding is located in an isolated area within the village; culling has already become operational. It is being carried out by the dispersion of a special foam which brings about immediate death of the birds which are subsequently buried on spot. The Ministry made known that the undertaken activities are in accordance with the international requirements prevailing in Western countries. Tests are being carried out in poultry farms within 3 km [about 2 mile] radius from the affected coop.

Introduction of the Eurasian (EA) H5N8 virus into the Pacific Flyway sometime during late 2014 has allowed mixing with North American (AM) lineage viruses and generated new combinations with genes from both EA and AM origin (or 'reassortant' viruses) such as the EA/AM H5N2-reassortant detected in Canada and the United States. Such findings are not unexpected as the EA-H5N8 virus continues to circulate. A novel EA/AM H5N1-reassortant clade 2.3.4.4 was isolated from an American green-winged teal in Whatcom County, Washington. This H5N1 subtype is different from strain circulating in Asia. The gene constellation is as follows: Eurasian lineage genes (PB2, H5, NP, MP more than 99 percent identical to A/gyrfalcon/WA/41088/2014 H5N8); North American lineage genes (PB1 [98 percent identical to A/Northern pintail/Washington/40964/2014 H5N2], PA, N1, NS of North American LPAI wild bird lineage. The HA cleavage site is compatible with strains that are highly pathogenic.

But he also said a recent analysis of viruses from 2 human patients in Egypt showed no major genetic changes.\n\nEgypt has had a surge of human H5N1 cases over about the past 7 weeks, after reporting very few during the preceding 2 years. According to media reports based on health ministry statements, the country had 29 cases with 11 deaths in 2014, most of them in November and December. All or nearly all of the patients had contact with poultry, and no signs of human-to-human transmission have been reported, but the cases have prompted some speculation about whether the virus has changed in some way.\n\nIn addition, Egypt has had a big increase in reported poultry outbreaks of H5N1 recently, according to the FAO. A graph supplied by Lubroth showed about 70 outbreaks in November (2014) and close to 180 outbreaks in December [2014], compared with fewer than 10 in each of those months in 2013.\n\nMutations identified\n--------------------\nIn response to questions from CIDRAP News, Lubroth and 2 FAO colleagues (Filip Claes, PhD, and Gwenaelle Dauphin, DVM, PhD) prepared a statement about recent H5N1 surveillance findings in Egypt. They said 2 Egyptian agencies (the General Organization for Veterinary Services [GOVS] and the National Laboratory for Quality Control in Poultry Production), with FAO support, recently stepped up H5N1 surveillance and launched a study to characterize viruses circulating in Upper and Lower Egypt.\n\nGenetic sequencing of 52 isolates revealed that the hemagglutinin (H5) genes in the virus continue to evolve but that all the isolates belong to clade 2.2.1, the same as seen in previous years. However, the scientists also identified 2 'fixed mutations': a 'combination of [delta]129 and I151T,' and a 'T156A causing a loss of glycosylation at receptor binding site. Both mutations enhance alpha 2-6 receptor binding (which is associated with mammalian [i.e. human - Mod.JW] adaptation),' the statement said. It added that the virus is nonetheless still regarded as an avian one.\n\nHowever, the FAO also reported the emergence in 2014 of a new H5N1 cluster with 3 other mutations -- D54N, R189K, and R474K. It said this cluster also remains within clade 2.2.1, but the significance of the mutations needs to be assessed.\n\nEgypt's veterinary diagnostic laboratory plans to further analyze mutations seen in the recent avian H5N1 isolates, but the mutations' significance for human health needs to be examined in collaboration with Egypt's health ministry and the World Health Organization, Lubroth reported.\n\nHuman isolates unchanged\n------------------------\nHe also noted that US Naval Medical Research Unit 3 (NAMRU-3) in Cairo recently analyzed 2 human H5N1 isolates from Egypt and found 'no major genetic changes' in the virus as of 3 Dec 2014. The lab looked at the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase genes of isolates from cases in Minya (Menia) and Asyut (Assiut) governorates. Since the study was limited to just 2 isolates, more samples need to be shared and analyzed, Lubroth's statement said.\n\nConcerning the recent increase in reported poultry H5N1 outbreaks, Egypt's GOVS has suggested that it may be a result of increased surveillance, mainly through the FAO-founded Community-based Animal Health and Outreach (CAHO) system, the statement said. But it said other sources have voiced the view that the increase in outbreaks in both Upper and Lower Egypt 'is real but due to the expected seasonal factors conducive for increased viral activity.' [Which apparently didn't occur in 2013 -- see above. - Mod.JW]\n\nA recent report from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) included a graph that showed that H5N1 activity in Egypt has peaked between January and March most years since the virus surfaced there in 2006. The ECDC report, posted 23 Dec [2014], said there was no evidence of human-to-human transmission of H5N1 in Egypt and no increase in the low risk for visitors to the country.\n\nLubroth's statement cited a need to step up the response to H5N1 in Egypt. He suggested a possible multi-agency mission to the country to engage with government officials and provide technical or strategic help. In addition, he cited a need for high political authorities to renew their commitment to fighting H5N1 and for greater collaboration among public health, veterinary, epidemiology, and laboratory groups.\n\n[Byline: Robert Roos]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map is available at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/55.]", "summary": "A ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n \n\nEgypt's veterinary diagnostic laboratory plans to further analyze mutations seen in the recent avian H5N1 isolates, but the mutations' significance for human health needs to be examined in collaboration with Egypt's health ministry and the World Health Organization \n\nConcerning the recent increase in reported poultry H5N1 outbreaks, Egypt's GOVS has suggested that it may be a result of increased surveillance, mainly through the FAO-founded Community-based Animal Health and Outreach (CAHO) system, the statement said.

Comparing introduction to Europe of HPAI A(H5N8) in 2014 and A(H5N1) in 2005.\n\nAbstract:\nSince the beginning of November 2014, 9 outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) A(H5N8) in poultry have been detected in 4 European countries. In this report, similarities and differences between the modes of introduction of HPAIV A(H5N1) and A(H5N8) into Europe are described. Experiences from outbreaks of A(H5N1) in Europe demonstrated that early detection to control HPAIV in poultry has proven pivotal to minimise the risk of zoonotic transmission and prevention of human cases.\n\n[The full paper follows; references omitted. For the references please go to the source URL].\n\n1. Highly pathogenic avian influenza virus A(H5N1) and A(H5N8) outbreaks in domestic poultry and wild birds in Europe.\n\nOutbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) A(H5N8) in domestic poultry and wild birds in Europe in 2014 have some similarities to the previous introduction of HPAIV A(H5N1). Since beginning of November 2014, 9 outbreaks have been detected in 4 countries in Europe. Comparisons between these incursions may help to better understand potential risks to public health.\n\nIn autumn 2005, Romania and Croatia were the 1st European countries reporting influenza A(H5N1) virus infections in wild birds and domestic poultry; hereafter, it spread rapidly across central Europe starting in February 2006. When HPAIV A(H5N1) finally disappeared in 2010, it had been detected in wild birds and poultry in 21 European countries [for the table 'European countries with reported outbreaks of influenza A(H5N1) and influenza A(H5N8) virus infection in domestic poultry and wild birds, 2003 to 2014', please go to the source URL]. Prior to the introduction into Europe, HPAIV A(H5N1) was extensively circulating in poultry, with recurrent spillovers to wild birds, in Asia.\n\nInfluenza A(H5N8) virus is a complex reassortant virus carrying genes from A(H5N1) as one of its parental viruses. An ancestral strain was 1st reported in China in 2010. In 2014, following further virus evolution via reassortment, several outbreaks with HPAIV A(H5N8) viruses occurred in aquatic migratory birds, chickens, geese and ducks in China, Japan, and Republic of Korea. Between 5 Nov and 16 Dec 2014, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom (UK) reported HPAIV A(H5N8) outbreaks in 9 holdings in total, with turkeys, chickens or ducks [for Figure & Table 'Countries reporting outbreaks of influenza A(H5N8) virus infection in domestic poultry and wild birds, 2014', please go to the source URL].\n\nIn November and December 2014, HPAIV A(H5N8) was detected in a healthy common teal (_Anas crecca_) in Germany and in 2 faecal samples from Eurasian wigeons (_Anas penelope_) in the Netherlands. The region in Germany currently affected by HPAIV A(H5N8) largely matches the area that was 1st affected by HPAIV A(H5N1), whereas in the UK, cases of A(H5N1) were initially located in eastern and southern regions and in Italy in central and southern regions, but not in the areas affected in November 2014. The Netherlands had not been affected by HPAIV A(H5N1) at all.\n\nInfluenza A(H5N8) virus infection does not appear to be associated with severe illness or excessive mortality in wild mallard ducks. In contrast, in galliform poultry (turkey, chickens), HPAIV A(H5N8) causes mass mortality as seen in affected holdings. The low to moderate virulence of HPAIV A(H5N8) in domestic ducks seen in the UK resembles the situation in wild mallards. Many strains of HPAIV A(H5N1), in contrast, cause high mortality not only in galliformes but also in anseriform poultry and in wild birds.\n\n2. Routes of introduction into Europe\n\nThe spread of HPAIV A(H5N1) from east Asia to Europe via central Asia may have occurred by a complex mixture of activities associated with poultry production, illegal poultry transports, spillover infections to wild birds, and migratory bird dispersal, but no consistent route of infection into poultry holdings within Europe has been identified. The sudden occurrence of HPAIV A(H5N1) in central Europe in 2006 was probably associated with cold spells in western Russia that drove out substantial numbers of putatively infected wild birds further west.\n\nMutual transmission of HPAIV between migratory birds and domestic poultry might occur through direct or indirect contacts. Genetic analyses of the recent European influenza A(H5N8) viruses revealed very high similarity to Japanese wild bird isolates, suggesting a common source of infection.\n\nImport of live poultry and live captive birds as well as poultry commodities from affected Asian regions to the European Union (EU) is illegal but cannot be formally excluded as a route of introduction for HPAIV A(H5N8); however, this seems unlikely considering the simultaneous nature and geographic spread of the outbreaks. No epidemiological links have been identified between the initially affected holdings in Germany, the Netherlands and the UK. Findings of HPAIV A(H5N8) in wild birds in Europe also open a possibility for an importation from Asia to Europe via migratory wild birds, although this remains hypothetical until the virus is found in further wild bird populations in central and western Asia.\n\nAffected holdings in Europe so far were indoor facilities with nominally good biosecurity, yet indirect contact between wild birds and poultry (via any material contaminated by infected wild birds, such as faeces) might be possible. The fact that in several of the holdings stable units closest to the entrance of the compound were the 1st affected in the outbreak might suggest the introduction of A(H5N8) from a focal source close to the compound.\n\n3. Surveillance of highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses in the European Union\n\nThe experience of large HPAIV outbreaks in the Netherlands, Belgium and Germany, e.g. A(H7N7) in 2003, prompted the EU to better prepare for large scale incursions of HPAIV. The establishment and implementation of surveillance systems, diagnostic tools for early detection of HPAIV and harmonised restriction and control measures were laid down in the EU legislation. This included introducing programmes of passive surveillance of wild bird populations as an early warning system, which proved to be a useful tool in detecting presence of HPAIV A(H5N1). This was complemented by active monitoring of poultry. In the current epizootic, enhanced wild bird monitoring might also help to further elucidate the role of wild birds transmitting A(H5N8), although the apparently asymptomatic presentation in wild bird species in Europe indicates that potentially scaling up elements of targeted active rather than passive surveillance may be appropriate to better understand the distribution, prevalence and introduction pathways into Europe.\n\n4. Risk for human transmission and resulting public health measures\n\nAlthough to date, HPAIV A(H5N1) has caused 676 human cases worldwide, including 398 deaths, no human cases have ever been reported in Europe, and these viruses lack the capability for sustained human-to-human transmission. Cats and mustelids were the only mammals found to be infected in Europe. No human cases due to A(H5N8) have so far been reported anywhere. Mammals such as mice, ferrets, dogs and cats proved to be susceptible to experimental A(H5N8) infection, yet, only mild clinical disease, if any, ensued, and so their role as amplification or reservoir hosts appears less likely.\n\nBinding of avian influenza viruses to mammalian 2-6 sialic acid receptors is a prerequisite for transmission to humans. HPAIV A(H5N8) binds strongly to avian 2-3 receptors and, to a markedly lesser degree, to 2-6 receptors, indicating limited zoonotic potential. Antiviral resistance has not been described in the recent isolates. Candidate vaccine viruses for human use have been proposed for pandemic preparedness.\n\nPeople at risk of spillover infections are those directly exposed to infected birds and their carcasses, such as during culling measures in affected holdings. Personal protective equipment and other protective measures are a prerequisite for preventing zoonotic transmission. Passive or active monitoring of exposed persons enables early identification of transmission events. There is no evidence of human infection through consumption of contaminated food. Recommended diagnostic tests for animal and human samples showed reliable detection of HPAIV A(H5N8).\n\n5. Conclusions\n\nThe current simultaneous occurrence of A(H5N8) in different European countries is comparable to the introduction of A(H5N1) around a decade ago. These similarities may point to common routes of introduction into Europe, although these are not fully understood and the exact sources of infection of the affected indoor poultry holdings have not been identified yet. More outbreaks seem possible. Although HPAIV A(H5N8) might have the potential to transmit to humans, no human cases have been detected so far.

Routes of introduction into Europe\n\nThe spread of HPAIV A(H5N1) from east Asia to Europe via central Asia may have occurred by a complex mixture of activities associated with poultry production, illegal poultry transports, spillover infections to wild birds, and migratory bird dispersal, but no consistent route of infection into poultry holdings within Europe has been identified. Between 5 Nov and 16 Dec 2014, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom (UK) reported HPAIV A(H5N8) outbreaks in 9 holdings in total, with turkeys, chickens or ducks [for Figure & Table 'Countries reporting outbreaks of influenza A(H5N8) virus infection in domestic poultry and wild birds, 2014', please go to the source URL]. \n\nOutbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) A(H5N8) in domestic poultry and wild birds in Europe in 2014 have some similarities to the previous introduction of HPAIV A(H5N1). \n\nAffected holdings in Europe so far were indoor facilities with nominally good biosecurity, yet indirect contact between wild birds and poultry (via any material contaminated by infected wild birds, such as faeces) might be possible. In the current epizootic, enhanced wild bird monitoring might also help to further elucidate the role of wild birds transmitting A(H5N8), although the apparently asymptomatic presentation in wild bird species in Europe indicates that potentially scaling up elements of targeted active rather than passive surveillance may be appropriate to better understand the distribution, prevalence and introduction pathways into Europe. Findings of HPAIV A(H5N8) in wild birds in Europe also open a possibility for an importation from Asia to Europe via migratory wild birds, although this remains hypothetical until the virus is found in further wild bird populations in central and western Asia. \n\nImport of live poultry and live captive birds as well as poultry commodities from affected Asian regions to the European Union (EU) is illegal but cannot be formally excluded as a route of introduction for HPAIV A(H5N8); however, this seems unlikely considering the simultaneous nature and geographic spread of the outbreaks.

Surveillance of highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses in the European Union\n\nThe experience of large HPAIV outbreaks in the Netherlands, Belgium and Germany, e.g. A(H7N7) in 2003, prompted the EU to better prepare for large scale incursions of HPAIV. \n\nMutual transmission of HPAIV between migratory birds and domestic poultry might occur through direct or indirect contacts. Although to date, HPAIV A(H5N1) has caused 676 human cases worldwide, including 398 deaths, no human cases have ever been reported in Europe, and these viruses lack the capability for sustained human-to-human transmission. \n\nPeople at risk of spillover infections are those directly exposed to infected birds and their carcasses, such as during culling measures in affected holdings.

Experiences from outbreaks of A(H5N1) in Europe demonstrated that early detection to control HPAIV in poultry has proven pivotal to minimise the risk of zoonotic transmission and prevention of human cases.

The region in Germany currently affected by HPAIV A(H5N8) largely matches the area that was 1st affected by HPAIV A(H5N1), whereas in the UK, cases of A(H5N1) were initially located in eastern and southern regions and in Italy in central and southern regions, but not in the areas affected in November 2014.", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2010-03-25 00:00:00", "2021-03-01 00:00:00", "2014-12-25 00:00:00", "2014-03-25 00:00:00", "2003-03-25 00:00:00", "2014-11-25 00:00:00", "2006-03-25 00:00:00", "2005-03-25 00:00:00", "2006-02-25 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Netherlands", "country": "Netherlands"}, {"location": "Japan", "country": "Japan"}, {"location": "Italy", "country": "Italy"}, {"location": "Croatia", "country": "Croatia"}, {"location": "the United Kingdom", "country": "United Kingdom"}, {"location": "Russia", "country": "Russia"}, {"location": "Germany", "country": "Germany"}, {"location": "China", "country": "China"}, {"location": "Romania", "country": "Romania"}, {"location": "UK", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Republic of Korea", "country": "South Korea"}, {"location": "Belgium", "country": "Belgium"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "3043523", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Avian influenza (113): India (CH) H5N1, ducks, OIE, RFI", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=3043523", "date": "2014-12-19 18:09:50", "main_text": "AVIAN INFLUENZA (113): INDIA (CHANDIGARH) H5N1, DUCKS, OIE: REQUEST FOR INFORMATION\n***********************************************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Thu 18 Dec 2014\nSource: OIE, WAHID weekly disease information 2014; 27(51) [edited]\nhttp://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=16780\n\n\nHighly pathogenic avian influenza, India\n----------------------------------------\nInformation received on [and dated] 18 Dec 2014 from Mr Anup Kumar Thakur, Secretary, Government of India, Department of Animal Husbandry, Dairying and Fisheries, Ministry of Agriculture, New Delhi, India\n\nSummary\nReport type: immediate notification\nDate of start of the event: 11 Dec 2014\nDate of pre-confirmation of the event: 16 Dec 2014\nReason for notification: reoccurrence of a listed disease\nDate of previous occurrence: 21 Feb 2014\nManifestation of disease: clinical disease\nCausal agent: highly pathogenic avian influenza virus\nSerotype: H5N1\nNature of diagnosis: laboratory (advanced)\nThis event pertains to a defined zone within the country\n\nNew outbreaks (1)\nSummary of outbreaks\nTotal outbreaks: 1\nOutbreak 1: Sukhna lake, Chandigarh, Chandigarh\nDate of start of the outbreak: 11 Dec 2014\nOutbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)\nEpidemiological unit: not applicable\nAffected animals:\nSpecies / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered\nBirds / 100 / 22 / 22 / - / -\nAffected population: ducks in captivity\n\nOutbreak statistics:\nSpecies / Apparent morbidity rate / Apparent mortality rate / Apparent case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*\nBirds / 22 percent / 22 percent / 100 percent / **\n*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction and/or slaughter\n**Not calculated because of missing information\n\nEpidemiology\nSource of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive\n\nControl measures\nMeasures applied: stamping out; quarantine; movement control inside the country; screening; disinfection of infected premises/establishment(s); dipping/spraying; vaccination prohibited; no treatment of affected animals\nMeasures to be applied: no other measures\n\nDiagnostic test results\nLaboratory name and type: National Institute of High Security Animal Disease, Bhopal (national laboratory)\nSpecies / Test / Test date / Result\nBirds / real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR) / 16 Dec 2014 / Positive\nBirds / reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) / 16 Dec 2014 / Positive\nBirds/ virus isolation/ 16 Dec 2014/ Positive\n\nFuture reporting\nThe event is continuing.

HPAI serotype H5N1 was identified. To date, 4 outbreaks have been reported and all affected birds were ducks -- susceptible: 387 928; cases: 18 554; deaths: 18 554; destroyed: 369 374.\n\nThe updated data and map are available in the last follow-up report sent to the OIE on 17 Dec 2014; see http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/temp/reports/en_fup_0000016766_20141217_164912.pdf.\n\nRegarding the current report, it would be interesting to know the exact avian species that was affected. Based on a report from the media: 'Bird flu has been confirmed in one of the 30 domesticated geese that died at Sukhna Lake in Chandigarh. Of the 6 samples sent to the National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases Laboratory in Bhopal, one has tested positive for the dreaded avian influenza (H5N1). The Bhopal lab has communicated its findings to the Chandigarh-based northern region office of the Central Poultry Development Organisation. The samples were sent to Bhopal after more than 2 dozen geese (ducks) had died under mysterious circumstances at the lake in the past 2 weeks. Sources in the Department of Animal Husbandry (under the Ministry of Agriculture) told The Tribune that some samples (from Chandigarh) had tested positive for highly pathogenic H5N1.' Also included is a photograph of the dead goose found at Sukhna Lake in Chandigarh. See media report at http://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/dead-goose-tests-positive-for-bird-flu-in-chandigarh/19605.html.\n\nHowever, the official report sent to the OIE mentions that the species affected in this event are 'ducks in captivity'. While ducks and geese belong to the same phylogenetic order (Anseriformes) and family (Anatidae), neither swans nor geese are considered ducks. Ducks are mostly aquatic birds, mostly smaller than swans and geese, and may be found in both fresh water and sea water (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck). Geese are waterfowl belonging to the tribe Anserini of the family Anatidae. This tribe comprises the genera Anser (the grey geese), Branta (the black geese) and Chen (the white geese) (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goose).\n\nClarity on what species was actually affected would be useful to have.\n\nA map of India is available at http://www.ephotopix.com/image/asia/india_state_map.gif. - Mod.CRD\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/promed/p/325.]", "summary": "A ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n / -\nAffected population: ducks in captivity\n\nOutbreak statistics:\nSpecies / Apparent morbidity rate / Apparent mortality rate / Apparent case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*\n 18 Dec 2014 from Mr Anup Kumar Thakur, Secretary, Government of India, Department of Animal Husbandry, Dairying and Fisheries, Ministry of Agriculture, New Delhi, India\n\nSummary\nReport type: immediate notification\n Dec 2014 / Positive\nBirds/ virus isolation/ 16 Dec 2014/ Positive\n\nFuture reporting\n Affected animals:\nSpecies / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered\nBirds / 100 / 22 / 22 / - Manifestation of disease: clinical disease\nCausal agent: highly pathogenic avian influenza virus\n Total outbreaks: 1\nOutbreak 1: Sukhna lake, Chandigarh, Chandigarh\n Serotype: H5N1\nNature of diagnosis: laboratory (advanced)\n Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n< [The location of the outbreak can be seen on the interactive map included in the OIE report at the source URL above.]\n\n--\n This event pertains to a defined zone within the country\n\nNew outbreaks (1)\n no other measures\n\nDiagnostic test results\nLaboratory name and type: National Institute of High Security Animal Disease, Bhopal (national laboratory) Measures applied: stamping out; quarantine; movement control inside the country; screening; disinfection of infected premises/establishment(s); dipping/spraying; vaccination prohibited; no treatment of affected animals\nMeasures to be applied: Date of pre-confirmation of the event: 16 Dec 2014\n Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive\n\nControl measures\n Date of start of the event: 11 Dec 2014\n Source: OIE, WAHID weekly disease information 2014; 27(51) [edited]\nhttp://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=16780 Birds / 22 percent / 22 percent / 100 percent / **\n **Not calculated because of missing information\n\nEpidemiology\n Date of start of the outbreak: 11 Dec 2014\n", "reports": [{"diseases": ["unknown", "other"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2014-02-21 00:00:00", "2014-03-25 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "New Delhi", "country": "India"}, {"location": "India", "country": "India"}, {"location": "Kerala", "country": "India"}, {"location": "Bhopal", "country": "India"}, {"location": "WAHID", "country": "Oman"}, {"location": "INDIA", "country": "India"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "3042397", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Avian influenza, human (127): Egypt (AT) H5N1, fatal", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=3042397", "date": "2014-12-19 09:47:58", "main_text": "AVIAN INFLUENZA, HUMAN (127): EGYPT (AT) H5N1, FATAL\n****************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Wed 17 Dec 2014\nSource: Egypt Independent [edited]\nhttp://www.egyptindependent.com/news/woman-dies-bird-flu-assiut-raising-deaths-9-2014\n\n\nAn Egyptian woman died on [Wed 17 Dec 2014] of bird flu [avian influenza] bringing the number of deaths of bird flu to 9 cases since the beginning of the year [2014], Al-Masry Al-Youm [the Arabic version of the newspaper Egypt Independent] reports.\n\nA statement published on the Health Ministry's official website said 190 Egyptians have been infected with the virus since 2006.

Rare stem-specific heterosubtypic monoclonal antibodies (hmAbs) can neutralize multiple strains and subtypes by preventing hemagglutinin (HA)-mediated fusion of the viral with the endosomal membrane. The epitopes recognized by these hmAbs are therefore considered promising targets for the development of pan-influenza vaccines. Here we report the isolation of a novel human HA-stem-reactive monoclonal antibody, mAb 1.12, with exceptionally broad neutralizing activity encompassing viruses from 15 distinct HA subtypes. Using mAb 1.12 and 2 other monoclonal antibodies, we could demonstrate that neutralization by hmAbs is virtually irreversible but becomes severely impaired following virus attachment to cells. In contrast, no interference by human anti-influenza serum antibodies was found, indicating that apically binding antibodies do not impair access to the membrane-proximal heterosubtypic epitopes.

This is the 1st report of influenza C virus isolation in the Philippines. In addition, from January 2008 to December 2013, 7 influenza C viruses were isolated from specimens that were obtained from children with acute respiratory illness (ARI) in Sendai city, Japan. Antigenic analysis with monoclonal antibodies to the hemaggultinin-esterase (HE) glycoprotein showed that 19 strains (12 from Philippines and 7 from Japan) were similar to the reference strain C/Sao Paulo/378/82(SP82). Phylogenetic analysis of the HE gene showed that strains from the Philippines and Japan formed distinct clusters within an SP82-related lineage. The clusters including the Philippine and Japanese strains were shown to have diverged from a common ancestor around 1993. In addition, phylogenetic analysis of internal genes showed that all strains isolated in the Philippines and Japan had emerged through reassortment events. The composition of the internal genes of the Philippine strains was different from that of the Japanese strains, although all strains were classified into an SP82-related lineage by HE gene sequence analysis. These observations suggest that the influenza C viruses analyzed here had emerged through different reassortment events; however, the time and place at which the reassortment events occurred could not be determined.' - Mod.LK]", "summary": "To date, 458 human cases of avian influenza A(H7N9) have been reported by the Mainland health authorities, respectively in Zhejiang (141 cases), Guangdong (115 cases), Jiangsu (59 cases), Shanghai (42 cases), Hunan (24 cases), Fujian (23 cases), Anhui (17 cases), Jiangxi (8 cases), Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (8 cases), Beijing (5 cases), Shandong (5 cases), Henan (4 cases), Guangxi (3 cases), Jilin (2 cases), Guizhou (1 case) and Hebei (1 case).

Of those, 455 (61.3 percent) reported daily exposure to poultry. They also collected serum samples from 250 people who had no poultry exposure. To avoid the cross-reactivity that can result from antibodies to H1N1 and H3N2 viruses, the researchers considered an antibody titer of 80 or higher to indicate seropositivity, which matches the World Health Organization diagnostic criterion. Measurements were taken at baseline (from November 2010 to July 2011), one year later and 2 years later.\n\nThey found that 15 of 708 poultry-exposed volunteers (2.1 percent) had antibodies to H5N1 at baseline, with the prevalence dropping to 0.4 percent after one year and 0.6 percent after 2 years. The control group had no seropositive results at all 3 test times. The team also found that seropositive rates for H9N2 antibodies were 1.1 percent at baseline, 7.5 percent after one year, and 5.9 percent after 2 years, compared with 0 percent, 0.7 percent, and 1.0 percent in controls, respectively. Regarding their H5N1 findings, the authors conclude, 'This prevalence demonstrates that the number of cases is greatly underreported and that the case-fatality rate [CFR] is consequently greatly overestimated.' They note, however, that, given Egypt's low CFR, the results might not apply to other regions.\n\nIn an accompanying commentary [http://jid.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2014/10/25/infdis.jiu530.short], David Morens, MD and Jeffery Taubenberger, MD, PhD of the NIH's National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, wrote: 'While it is important to be vigilant about the potential risks posed by all influenza viruses, including A(H5N1), and while we cannot conclude that the A(H5N1) risk is nonexistent, we see no compelling virologic or epidemiologic evidence to suggest that A(H5N1) or any other avian influenza virus is currently evolving toward human transmissibility, let alone pandemicity, or that such viruses are even capable of doing so.' They said that greater pandemic threats include reassortment of circulating H1N1 and H3N2 strains with zoonotic strains, lab release of the 1957 H2N2 pandemic strain, or evolving influenza strains in swine.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Marianne Hopp\n\n[A recent WHO listing of human cases of avian H5N1 influenza virus infection places Egypt 2nd among the 16 countries that have so far recorded human cases of avian H5N1 avian influenza.

Their abstract reads:\n\n'- Background: A(H5N1) and A(H9N2) avian influenza viruses are enzootic in Egyptian poultry, and most A(H5N1) human cases since 2009 have occurred in Egypt. Our understanding of the epidemiology of avian viruses in humans remains limited. Questions about the frequency of infection, the proportion of infections that are mild or subclinical, and the case-fatality rate remain largely unanswered.\n- Methods: We conducted a 3-year, prospective, controlled, sero-epidemiological study that enrolled 750 poultry-exposed and 250 unexposed individuals in Egypt.\n- Results: At baseline, the seroprevalence of anti-A(H5N1) antibodies (titer, 80 or higher) among exposed individuals was 2 percent, significantly higher than that among the controls (0 percent). Having chronic lung disease was a significant risk factor for infection. Antibodies against A(H9N2) were not detected at baseline when A(H9N2) was not circulating in poultry. At follow-up, A(H9N2) was detected in poultry, and, consequently, the seroprevalence among exposed humans was between 5.6 percent and 7.5 percent. Vaccination of poultry, older age, and exposure to ducks were risk factors for A(H9N2) infection.\n- Conclusions: Results of this study indicate that the number of humans infected with avian influenza viruses is much larger than the number of reported confirmed cases.

Most H5N3 strains known to be detected (in wild or domestic birds) were designated as of low pathogenicity. It would be interesting to obtain details on the tests performed on the current isolate from a duck. No HPAI H5N3 could be found among earlier postings in the ProMED-mail archive. A Danish report on H5N3 (2006) was eventually found to be H5N2 (see ProMED- mail report 20060623.1740).\n\nAccording to the HPAI H5N1 report provided by China, the following control measures were applied: quarantine; movement control inside the country; screening; zoning; disinfection of infected premises/establishment(s); dipping/spraying; no vaccination; no treatment of affected animals.\n\nGiven that these 16 H5N1 outbreaks were associated with the live bird and local trade markets, it would be both interesting and useful to know how the quarantine and zoning measures are actually being applied to manage these cases.\n\nThe OIE uses the following definitions:\n- Quarantine: means that infected establishments are placed under quarantine with a standstill on the animals therein until all sanitary measures considered necessary to eradicate the disease have been completed.\n- Zoning: means a delineation (by regulatory means) of free, surveillance and/or buffer, and infected zones within the country for disease control purposes.\n\nIt would also be useful to know how the control measures of 'dipping and spraying' are applied since these measures are generally used to control parasites and potential vectors.\n\nIn addition, during this week, China sent follow-up repots for their H5N2 and H5N6 high pathogenicity events.\n\nFor the H5N2 event, 10 outbreaks have been reported. See follow-up report No. 3 at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/temp/reports/en_fup_0000016061_20141024_184114.pdf. See also the event summary and updated map at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?reportid=14553.\n\nFor the H5N6 event, 25 outbreaks have been reported. See follow up report No. 2 at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/temp/reports/en_fup_0000016060_20141024_193420.pdf. See also event summary and updated map at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?reportid=15957.\n\nFinally, regarding their low pathogenicity AI H7N9 event, only 43 outbreaks have been reported through July 2014.\n\nSee the last official follow up report at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/temp/reports/en_fup_0000015547_20140709_121859.pdf.

A few human cases have been linked to consumption of dishes made of raw, contaminated poultry blood.

The outbreak was resolved in December 2008. See report and map at: http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/temp/reports/en_fup_0000007639_20081229_121956.pdf.\n\nIn January 2009 and April 2010, 2 events of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) subtype H5N1 were reported by Laos. These were located in the provinces of Phongsaly (1 outbreak) and Vientiane Capital (1 outbreak).

It is noteworthy that if HPAI is one of the trans-boundary animal diseases having a significant impact in both trade and human health, it is not a notifiable disease in the country and no surveillance is being done as a basic control measure.\n\nBased on the information Laos provided the OIE, it begs the question of whether or not the disease has been present prior to this reported event in this and other provinces.

Tubruq (Tobruk) is the capital of the district of Al Butnan. http://www.statoids.com/lkl.html which borders to the east with Egypt's Matruh Governorate. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butnan_District\n\nAccording to the OIE's WAHID database, from January to June 2013 Egypt reported 86 outbreaks of HPAI H5N1. For further details of these outbreaks, select the disease, region/country and year at: http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Diseaseinformation/statusdetail\n\nOther countries which border Libya report HPAI as being absent [Sudan (April 2006) and Niger (June 2006)], and as never reported (Algeria and Tunisia). Sudan, Algeria y Tunisia indicate that they apply 'general and targeted surveillance' as control measures, and Niger indicates only applying 'general surveillance'. There is no information on Chad. http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Diseaseinformation/statuslist\n\nThe Asian strain of avian influenza H5N1 virus has been confirmed in poultry and wild birds in several countries in the following regions: Asia, Europe, Africa and the Middle East. While this demonstrates the rapid and ongoing geographical spread of the virus, information to date has shown that the greatest risk to humans arises when the virus becomes established in small backyard poultry flocks, which allow continuing opportunities for close human contact, exposures, and infections to occur. http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/h5n1/index-eng.php\n\nA map of the administrative divisions of Libya is available at, http://www.ephotopix.com/image/africa/libya_admin_map.gif. - Mod.CRD\n\nProMED-mail would like to thank Rapporteur Mary Marshall for submitting a similar report on this outbreak. - Mod.MPP\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/r/aio9.]", "summary": "Measures applied: stamping out; quarantine; movement control inside the country; screening; zoning;\ndisinfection of infected premises/establishment(s); vaccination prohibited ; dipping/ spraying; vaccinated prohibited; no treatment of affected animals\n\nMeasures to be applied: no other measures\n\nDiagnostic test results:\nLaboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result\nNational Center of Disease Control Laboratory (National laboratory)/ Birds/ real-time PCR/ 11 Mar 2014/ Positive\nNational Central Veterinary Laboratory, National Center of Animal Health (National laboratory)/ Birds/ antigen (Ag) detection ELISA/ 9 Mar 2014/ Positive\nNational Central Veterinary Laboratory, National Center of Animal Health (National laboratory)/ Birds/ real-time PCR/ 10 Mar 2014/ Positive\n\nFuture Reporting:\n A ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n \n\nOutbreak statistics:\nSpecies / Apparent morbidity rate / Apparent mortality rate / Apparent case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*\nBirds/38 percent/ 30 percent/ 78.95 percent/ 100 percent\n* Date of previous occurrence: 26 May 2011\nManifestation of disease: Clinical disease\nCausal agent: Highly pathogenic avian influenza virus\n Farm\nAffected animals:\nSpecies / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed /Slaughtered\n Summary of outbreaks: Total outbreaks: 1\nOutbreak 1: Kroum Alkhail, Tubruq\n Serotype: H5N1\nNature of diagnosis: clinical, laboratory (basic), laboratory (advanced), necropsy\n Communicated by:\nProMED-mail\n< Information received on [and date] 12 Mar 2014 from Dr Abdunaser Dayhum, Director General, National Centre of Animal Health, Ministry of Agriculture, Animal & Marine Wealth , Zawia, Libya\n\nSummary:\n This event pertains to the whole country\n\nNew outbreaks (1)\n Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection:Unknown or inconclusive\n\nControl measures\n Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction and/or slaughter\n\nEpidemiology:\n Source: OIE, WAHID (World Animal Health Information Database), weekly disease information 2014; 27(11) OIE [edited]\n Date of start of the event: 4 Mar 2014\n Date of start of the outbreak: 4 Mar 2014\n", "reports": [{"diseases": ["unknown", "other"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2014-03-25 00:00:00", "2011-05-25 00:00:00", "2006-04-25 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya", "country": "Libya"}, {"location": "Sudan", "country": "Sudan"}, {"location": "North Africa", "country": "Cameroon"}, {"location": "Libya", "country": "Libya"}, {"location": "Algeria", "country": "Algeria"}, {"location": "Egypt", "country": "Egypt"}, {"location": "Chad", "country": "Chad"}, {"location": "Tunisia", "country": "Tunisia"}, {"location": "WAHID", "country": "Oman"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "2338293", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Avian influenza, human (85): Cambodia (KP, KN, KG), H5N1", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=2338293", "date": "2014-03-17 19:41:17", "main_text": "AVIAN INFLUENZA, HUMAN (85): CAMBODIA (KAMPOT, KANDAL, KAMPONG CHHNANG), H5N1\n*****************************************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nIn this posting:\n[1] Kampot, 9th case confirmed - MOH\n[2] Media report, 9th case\n[3] Kantal, Kampong Chnnang, 7th and 8th cases confirmed - MOH\n\n******\n[1] Kampot, 9th case confirmed - MOH\nDate: Mon 17 Mar 2014\nSource: Cambodia Ministry of Health press release [edited]\nhttp://www.cdcmoh.gov.kh/PressRelease/56-PressRelease.Eng.pdf\n\n\n9th New Human Case of Avian Influenza H5N1 in Cambodia in 2014\n--------------------------------------------------------------\nThe Ministry of Health (MoH) of the Kingdom of Cambodia wishes to advise members of the public that one new human case of avian influenza has been confirmed for the H5N1 virus. This is the 9th case this year [2014] and the 56th person to become infected with the H5N1 virus in Cambodia. The case is from Kampot province. Of the 56 confirmed cases, 44 were children under 14, and 30 of the 56 were female. In addition, since the 1st case happened in Cambodia in 2005, only 19 cases have survived.\n\nA 2-year-old girl from Kandal village, Vat Ang Khang Tboung commune, Banteay Meas district, Kampot province, was tested positive by Institut Pasteur du Cambodge on [14 Mar 2014]. The girl had onset symptom of fever on [8 Mar 2014]. Her parents sought treatment at a private practitioner on the same day [8 Mar 2014] and on the next day [9 Mar 2014]. The girl was admitted to a private clinic on [10 Mar 2014] and in Kantha Bopha Hospital on [13 Mar 2014]. She had symptoms of fever, cough and dyspnea, and Tamiflu was administrated on the same day [13 Mar 2014]. The girl died on [14 Mar 2014].\n\nIn the beginning of February [2014], chickens started dying in the village and in the house of the case. At the end of February [2014] and beginning of March [2014], it is estimated that 90 percent of poultries of the village died. The girl had direct contact with dead chickens while her relatives prepared them for food and the girl ate them.\n\nThe national and local Rapid Response Teams (RRTs) are conducting outbreak investigation and responses following the national protocol.\n\n'Avian influenza H5N1 remains a serous threat to the health of all Cambodians and more so for children, who seem to be most vulnerable and are at high risk. There have been 56 cases of H5N1 infection in humans since 2005 and here is the 9th case of this year [2014]. Children often care for domestic poultry by feeding them, cleaning pens and gathering eggs. Children may also have closer contact with poultry as they often treat them as pets and also seem to be most vulnerable and are at high risk because they like to play where poultry are found. I urge parents and guardians to keep children away from sick or dead poultry and prevent them from playing with chickens and ducks. Parents and guardians must also make sure children thoroughly wash their hands with soap and water before eating and after any contact with poultry. Hands may carry the virus that cannot be seen by the naked eye. Soap washes away the virus on hands. If children have fast or difficult breathing, their parents should seek medical attention at the nearest health facility and attending physicians must be made aware of any exposure to sick or dead poultry,' said H.E. Dr. Mam Bunheng, Minister of Health.\n\nA nationwide public health education campaign using radio has been launched at the end of January [2014], with prevention messages. Also, public health education campaign is being conducted in Kandal village, Kampot province using information, education and communications materials to inform families on how to protect themselves from contracting avian influenza. The government's message is: wash hands often with soap and water before eating and after coming into contact with poultry; keep children away from poultry; keep poultry away from living areas; do not eat dead or sick poultry; and all poultry eaten should be well cooked.\n\nH5N1 influenza is a flu that normally spreads between sick poultry, but it can sometimes spread from poultry to humans. Human H5N1 avian influenza is a very serious disease that requires hospitalization. Although the virus currently does not easily spread among humans, if the virus changes it could easily be spread like seasonal influenza. Hence, early recognition of cases is important.\n\nThe Ministry of Health will continue to keep the public informed of developments via the MoH website (http://www.cdcmoh.gov.kh), where relevant health education materials can also be downloaded.\n\nFor more information on human influenza please call the MoH Influenza Hotline numbers: 115 (free call); 012 488 981 or 089 669 567.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[2] Media report, 9th case\nDate: Mon 17 Mar 2014\nSource: Xinhua News Agency [edited]\nhttp://news.xinhuanet.com/english/health/2014-03/17/c_133192908.htm\n\n\nA 2-year-old girl from southwestern Kampot province died of H5N1 human avian influenza on Friday [14 Mar 2014], bringing the number of cases to 9 so far this year, said a joint statement from the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Cambodian Health Ministry on Monday [17 Mar 2014].\n\nA total of 5 out of the 9 cases this year [2014] survived.\n\n'The girl died on [14 Mar 2014] -- a day after being admitted to the Kantha Bopha Children Hospital,' the statement said, adding that the toddler had symptoms of fever, cough and dyspnea.\n\nThe statement said that last month [February 2014], about 90 percent of chickens in her village died, and the girl had direct contact with dead chickens while her relatives prepared them for food and the girl ate them.\n\nBird flu remains a serious threat to the health of all Cambodians and children seem to be most vulnerable and are at high risk, Health Minister Mam Bunheng said.\n\n'I urge parents and guardians to keep children away from sick or dead poultry and make sure children wash their hands with soap and water after any contact with poultry,' he said.\n\nH5N1 influenza is a flu that normally spreads between sick poultry, but it can sometimes spread from poultry to humans, according to the WHO.\n\nThe virus was 1st identified in Cambodia 10 years ago.

To date [7 Mar 2014], 8 out of 13 cities and provinces in southern Mekong delta were reported to be struck with avian flu outbreaks.\n\nDong Nai province is home to the largest number of poultry raised nationwide, with over 12 million. It is also located at the gateway of Ho Chi Minh City, the key economic hub in the south. As such, the transportation of poultry products is more likely to trigger the outbreak of bird flu, according to the local animal health department.\n\nCurrently, only 10 percent of the poultry in Dong Nai has been vaccinated against the A/H5N1 strain of the virus. Earlier, the province detected 2 bird flu cases in Trang Bom and Cam My districts.\n\nThe latest statistics from the National Steering Committee on Bird Flu Prevention and Control revealed that the H5N1 virus hit 23 provinces and cities across Viet Nam, with over 80 000 infected poultry culled.

Of the 53 confirmed cases, 41 were children under 14, and 29 of the 53 were female. In addition, since the 1st case happened in Cambodia in 2005, only 18 cases have survived.\n\nA 3-year-old boy from Prey Lyea village, Sangkat Chom-Chao commune, Khan Por-SenChey district, Phnom Penh province, was detected by the National Institute of Public Health (NIPH) on [3 Mar 2014] and confirmed positive by lnstitut Pasteur du Cambodge (IPC) on [3 Mar 2014]. The boy had onset symptoms of fever, cough, running nose and vomiting on [22 Feb 2014]. His parents sought treatment at a private clinic on the same day. His condition worsened and the boy was admitted to National Pediatric Hospital (NPH) on [28 Feb 2014]. On [2 Mar 2014], the boy had symptoms of fever, cough, running nose, vomiting, dyspnea, and cyanoses and was transferred to Calmette Hospital on the same day. The boy died about one hour after his admission on [2 Mar 2014].\n\nAround mid-February [2014], over 90 percent of the chickens and small number of ducks suddenly died in the village. The boy was often going to a neighbour's house where their poultry died. The relatives reported that the boy had no direct contact, but the chickens died in close proximity to the house of the case.\n\n'Avian influenza H5N1 remains a serious threat to the health of all Cambodians and more so for children, who seem to be most vulnerable and are at high risk. There have been 53 cases of H5N1 infection in humans since 2005, and here is the 6th case of this year [2014]. Children often care for domestic poultry by feeding them, cleaning pens and gathering eggs. Children may also have closer contact with poultry as they often treat [the birds] as pets, and also seem to be most vulnerable and are at high risk because they like to play where poultry are found. I urge parents and guardians to keep children away from sick or dead poultry and prevent then from playing with chickens and ducks. Parents and guardians must also make sure children thoroughly wash their hands with soap and water before eating and after any contact with poultry. Hands may carry the virus that cannot be seen by the naked eye. Soap washes away the virus on hands. If children have fast or difficult breathing, their parents should seek medical attention at the nearest health facility, and attending physicians must be made aware of any exposure to sick or dead poultry,' said H.E.

'Cambodia reported 5 confirmed and 1 probable case of human infection with influenza A(H5N1) virus. All cases were children: a 5-year-old boy from Kampong Thom, and 3 cases from the same village in Kratie province: an 8-year-old boy and his 2-year-old sister (probable case) and a 4-year-old boy. The siblings died from severe respiratory infection, but samples were collected only from the 8-year-old boy. The 4-year-old boy was detected during the contact tracing around this family cluster. Exposure of the last 3 children to a common poultry source is likely as a high number of poultry were reported to have died in the village in mid-January [2014], and all had direct exposure to dead and sick poultry.

'If localities fail to intensify scrutiny and take swift measures, bird flu could develop into an epidemic,' warned the department's deputy head Dam Xuan Thanh.\n\nParticipants at the meeting agreed that all localities where the disease has reoccurred or has yet to be detected should focus on preventing illegal import and trading of poultry. Local authorities will also tighten inspections at border gates and take prompt preventive measures against the bird flu virus and human-transmission strains such as H5N1 and H7N9.\n\nWith a population of around 10 million, Ho Chi Minh City consumes a large amount of poultry on a daily basis with many brought in from other localities. The city has signed cooperation agreements with localities such as Dong Nai, Ba Ria-Vung Tau, Binh Duong, Long An and Tien Giang in monitoring and preventing epidemic diseases and managing food safety.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n******\n[2]\nDate: Tue 25 Feb 2014\nSource: OIE, WAHID weekly disease information 2014; 27(09) [edited]\nhttp://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=14822 and http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=14834\n\n\nHighly pathogenic avian influenza, Viet Nam\n-------------------------------------------\nInformation received on [and dated] 25 Feb 2014 from Dr Dong Pham Van, Director General, Chief Veterinary Officer, Department of Animal Health, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, Hanoi, Viet Nam\n\nSummary:\nReport type: Follow-up reports No. 7 and No. 8\n\n[Note: This report pertains to several outbreaks associated with the same event but which were reported in 2 separate OIE follow-up reports.

Of the 50 confirmed cases, 38 were children under 14, and 27 of the 50 were female. In addition, since the 1st case happened in Cambodia in 2005, only 16 cases have survived.\n\nA 4-year-old boy from KbalTraclt village, Sre Cha commune, Snourl district, Kratie province was confirmed positive by Institut Pasteur du Cambodge (IPC) on [14th Feb 2014]. The boy had onset of fever and vomiting on [8 Feb 2014]. The boy was detected by the mobile surveillance team during contact tracing of the 2nd confirmed case on [12 Feb 2014]. His symptoms were fever, running nose, vomiting, sore throat and cough. He was admitted to Kratie Provincial Hospital on [13 Feb 2014], and Tamiflu was administered on the same day. The symptoms were mild, and the boy is now in good condition.\n\nThe case had direct exposure to dead and sick poultry. The boy played with and carried dead chickens 6 days before developing symptoms. Around mid-January [2014], a high number of poultry (around 350 animals comprising chickens, ducks, and geese) started to die in the village. Animal Health officers took samples from sick/dead chickens on [9 Feb 2014], and they were tested negative for H5N1 by the National Veterinary Research Institute (NAVRI).\n\nNational and local Rapid Response Teams (RRTs) are conducting an outbreak investigation and responses following the national protocol.\n\n'Avian influenza H5N1 remains a serious threat to the health of all Cambodians and more so for children, who seem to be most vulnerable and are at high risk. There have been 50 cases of H5N1 infection in humans since 2005, and here is the 3rd case of this year [2014]. Children often care for domestic poultry by feeding them, cleaning pens, and gathering eggs. Children may also have closer contact with poultry, as they often treat them as pets and also seem to be most vulnerable and are at high risk because they like to play where poultry are found. I urge parents and guardians to keep children away from sick or dead poultry and prevent them from playing with chickens and ducks. Parents and guardians must also make sure children thoroughly wash their hands with soap and water before eating and after any contact with poultry. Hands may carry the virus that cannot be seen by the naked eye. Soap washes away the virus on hands. If children have rapid or difficult breathing, their parents should seek medical attention at the nearest health facility, and attending physicians must be made aware of any exposure to sick or dead poultry,' said H.E. Dr. Mam Bunheng, Minster of Health.\n\nA nationwide public health education campaign using the radio was launched at the end of January 2014 with prevention messages. Also, a public health education campaign is being conducted in KhalTrach village, Kratie province, using information, education and communications materials to inform families on how to protect themselves from contracting avian influenza. The government's message is to wash hands often with soap and water, before eating and after coming into contact with poultry; keep children away from poultry; keep poultry away from living areas; do not eat dead or sick poultry; and all poultry eaten should be well cooked.\n\nH5N1 influenza is a flu that normally spreads between sick poultry, but it can sometimes spread from poultry to humans. Human H5N1 avian influenza is a very serious disease that requires hospitalization. Although the virus currently does not easily spread among humans, if the virus changes, it could easily be spread like seasonal influenza. Hence, early recognition of cases is important.\n\nThe Ministry of Health will continue to keep the public informed of developments via the MoH website http://www.cdcmoh.gov.kh, where relevant health education materials can also be downloaded.\n\nFor more information on human influenza, please call the MoH Influenza Hotline numbers: 115 (free call): 012 488 981 or 089 669 567.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n[The majority of cases of human infection with avian influenza viruses reported this year [2014] have been infected with LPAI A(H7N9) in China.

And Canadian scientists have published a report on the full genetic sequence of virus taken from the Alberta woman, who died in early January 2014 after returning from a 3-week trip to her native China. The source of the woman's infection has been a mystery; she spent her entire trip in Beijing, where H5N1 reportedly hasn't been discovered for some time, and her travelling companion said she did not have contact with live birds while there. But scientists from Beijing's Centre for Disease Prevention and Control are hypothesizing that illegal live bird markets may have been the source of the woman's infection.\n\nIn a letter to the Journal of Infection, they say that even though Beijing banned live poultry markets in 2005, an illegal trade in live poultry continues in the city. They say it is possible the woman was infected while passing market stalls that surreptitiously sell live poultry. It is the custom in China to eat chicken when it has been freshly killed, and the sale of live poultry remains common in many parts of the country. The scientists point to a previous H5N1 case in Beijing, a woman who died in early January 2009. She had bought a live duck at a market in Hebei province, near Beijing, and prepared it for cooking by de-feathering it and gutting it.\n\nTesting of the area around the market stall where the woman bought the duck revealed the presence of H5N1 viruses that were closely related to the ones that infected her. As well, they note that several human infections with the newer [more recently isolated] H7N9 bird flu virus have been reported in Beijing. The scientists suggest the illegal trade in live poultry in Beijing may pose a high risk of human infection with bird flu viruses for people living in the city.\n\n'The enhanced inspection of illegal selling of live poultry, the strict regulation of transporting live poultry from regions outside of Beijing as well as the health education on changing dietetic culture is greatly warranted in Beijing in order to reduce the risk of infection with avian influenza viruses in the general population of Beijing including visiting foreigners,' they write in their letter.\n\nMeanwhile, scientists from Alberta's provincial laboratory, the universities of Calgary and Edmonton, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and the Public Health Agency of Canada's National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg have published an analysis of the full genetic sequence of the virus recovered from the Alberta woman. Their report will be in the May 2014 issue of the CDC's journal Emerging Infectious Diseases, but it has been published early online. They say the virus is from a clade -- a subgroup of the main H5N1 family -- that has been found recently in China, Viet Nam and Indonesia. Analysis suggests the virus is a close match for one [isolate] that has been made into a vaccine seed strain that manufacturers could use if H5N1 vaccine is required. The authors say additional study of the virus is needed to see whether its characteristics are responsible for the unusual symptoms the Alberta woman suffered.\n\nWhile she had the respiratory infection that is characteristic of influenza infection, she also had evidence of meningoencephalitis, infection in the brain.\n\n[Byline: Helen Branswell]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n[These findings are consistent with the expectation that the [China-born] Canadian contracted H5N1 virus infection in China during vacation and not during her residence in Alberta. - Mod.CP\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/r/73a6.]", "summary": "\n\n'The enhanced inspection of illegal selling of live poultry, the strict regulation of transporting live poultry from regions outside of Beijing as well as the health education on changing dietetic culture is greatly warranted in Beijing in order to reduce the risk of infection with avian influenza viruses in the general population of Beijing including visiting foreigners,' they write in their letter.

Canadian scientists studying H5N1 bird flu virus samples taken from an Alberta woman who died with the infection say that so far it seems to resemble a Chinese strain. Researchers at Canada's National Microbiology Laboratory [NML] and Alberta's provincial laboratory isolated samples of the virus and are working on sequencing it. They're looking to see if the sequence is the same as previous ones in the search for clues to the [3 Jan 2014] death.\n\n'Based on the genome sequence data collected to date, researchers at the [NML] have found it to be consistent with a previously circulating H5N1 strain from China,' a spokesperson said in an email Wednesday [15 Jan 2014]. 'The 1st research priority for the NML is to complete the whole genome sequence of the virus, and then analyze the data to learn more about the specific traits and characteristics of the virus. The genome analysis will help inform and guide all future research priorities.' If the sample differs from previous samples, then researchers could take a closer look. The sample will also be shared with the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Earlier this week, investigators with Alberta Health Services and the NML provided more clinical details about the patient. Virologist Kevin Fonseca of Alberta Health Services and his colleagues said the patient experienced symptoms of malaise, chest pain, and fever during the return flight on [27 Dec 2013] and went to the local emergency department on [28 Dec 2013]. One of the mysteries is that she had no known contact with poultry during her trip, public health officials said in announcing the case -- the 1st reported death from avian flu in North America. No H5N1 outbreaks have been reported in Beijing recently. After a chest x-ray and CT scan suggested a diagnosis of pneumonia, the woman was prescribed an antibiotic and discharged home. The patient came back to the same emergency department on [1 Jan 2014] with worsening inflammation of the membrane surrounding the lung, chest pain, shortness of breath, a mild headache that felt worse when she moved her head, nausea, vomiting and other symptoms, Fonseca's team said in their posting on ProMED-mail, an internet-based disease alert system [see posts listed below].\n\nOn [2 Jan 2014], the patient reported visual changes and a continuing headache. As oxygen needs increased, doctors admitted her to the ICU for intubation and ventilation. In the early morning of [3 Jan 2014], she had sudden tachycardia or fast heart rate and severe hypertension, followed by hypotension. Doctors took steps to keep her heart beating. At this point, the patient's pupils were dilated and there was no response to pain. Further tests and a neurologic exam indicated brain death. 'The attending physician felt that, while unlikely, avian influenza was possible given the travel history and neurological symptoms, and contacted the local medical officer of health on 3 Jan 2014 to report to public health. Contact tracing of family and hospital contacts was initiated as a precaution, given the severity of the illness and its rapid progression,' the team wrote.\n\n'This case identifies a number of key issues, the 1st being the rapid onset and tragic death of a young, healthy traveller due to an avian influenza A(H5N1) infection. The index of suspicion was low as travel was to an area in China where there have been no recent reports of the circulation of this virus, and coupled with no obvious exposure to poultry, the diagnostic work-up and consideration for A(H5N1) infection was very low.

The woman graduated with her degree in 2010 before earning a job as a registered nurse in the operating room at the Red Deer Regional Hospital.\n\nThe family of the woman, who was in her late 20s, released a statement through Alberta Health Services this morning [10 Jan 2014] talking about the 'energetic ... driven, and passionate' victim. The family wishes that the woman not be identified, citing privacy, and is not providing media with any interviews.\n\nThe woman died last week after falling ill upon her return from a 3-week vacation to Beijing in December 2013. Health officials are investigating her death, which has been determined to be the 1st fatality relating to avian flu in the Americas.\n\n'Our beloved daughter and wife was a hard-working, independent young woman,' starts the statement. 'She married her husband a year and a half ago, and together they created a happy life in Red Deer. She worked hard and had saved for a vacation, which she took in December 2013 with her mother. Together, they travelled on a trip which would sadly turn out to be her last,' it reads. 'We are devastated by her death, and we request time to grieve in privacy.'\n\nThe case has puzzled health officials, as the deadly form of influenza is usually transmitted to humans who come in close contact with infected birds. Officials investigating the case say the woman stayed in Beijing during her trip to China and did not visit any farms or poultry markets.\n\nThe cause of the woman's death, from inflammation of the brain and the lining that covers the brain, is also rather rare. The women is reported to have initially not had a cough or other respiratory-type symptoms, which are common among bird flu sufferers and which made her diagnosis a challenge early on.\n\nHealth officials have said there is little risk to other humans relating to the virus, as it is not known to spread person-to-person.

The 2 cases involve 2 men aged 54 and 80. They are now hospitalised for treatment.\n\nAs of yesterday [Sat 1 Feb 2014], a total of 275 human cases of avian influenza A(H7N9) have been confirmed in the mainland, including Zhejiang (113 cases), Shanghai (41 cases), Jiangsu (36 cases), Guangdong (43 cases), Fujian (16 cases), Jiangxi (6 cases), Anhui (4 cases), Henan (4 cases), Hunan (4 cases), Beijing (3 cases), Shandong (2 cases), Hebei (one case), Guizhou (one case, imported from Zhejiang), and Guangxi (one case).\n\nAdditionally, the CHP received notification of a confirmed human case of avian influenza A(H5N1) in Guangxi from the NHFPC. The patient is a 75-year-old man who had poultry exposure. He was admitted to a hospital for severe pneumonia on 29 Jan 2014. His specimen tested positive for avian influenza A(H5N1) virus by the relevant Guangxi health authorities. He is currently in critical condition.\n\n'Locally, enhanced disease surveillance, port health measures and health education against avian influenza are ongoing. We will remain vigilant and maintain liaison with the World Health Organization (WHO) and relevant health authorities. Local surveillance activities will be modified upon the WHO's recommendations,' a spokesman for the DH said. 'In view of human cases of avian influenza A(H7N9) confirmed in Hong Kong and multiple cases reported in the mainland, the activity of the virus is expected to be higher in the winter season.\n\nThose planning to travel outside Hong Kong during the Lunar New Year should maintain good personal, environmental and food hygiene at all times,' the spokesman urged. 'All boundary control points have implemented disease prevention and control measures. Thermal imaging systems are in place for body temperature checks of inbound travellers. Random temperature checks by handheld devices have also been arranged. Suspected cases will be immediately referred to public hospitals for follow-up investigation,' the spokesman added.\n\nRegarding health education for travellers, distribution of pamphlets, display of posters in departure and arrival halls, in-flight public announcements, environmental health inspection, and provision of regular updates to the travel industry via meetings and correspondence are all proceeding.

Canadian Health Minister Rona Ambrose said the deceased person was an Alberta [province] resident who had recently travelled to Beijing. Calling the death an 'isolated case,' Ms Ambrose said the risk to the general population was low.\n\nA total of 10 people have died in Alberta this season [2013-2014] from swine flu, or H1N1.\n\nH5N1 infects the lower respiratory tract deep in the lung, where it can cause deadly pneumonia. The World Health Organisation (WHO) says it is difficult to transmit the virus from person to person but when people do become infected, the mortality rate is about 60 percent.\n\nIn the latest incident, the infected person 1st showed symptoms of the flu on an Air Canada flight from Beijing to Vancouver on [27 Dec 2013], officials said. The passenger continued on to Edmonton, and on [1 Jan 2014] was admitted to hospital where [the case] died 2 days later. Canadian federal health officials said they would not identify the patient's sex, age or occupation. Ms Ambrose said Canadian officials were working with Chinese authorities on the case. 'The risk of getting H5N1 is very low. This is not the regular seasonal flu. This is an isolated case,' she said.\n\nAccording to the WHO, between 2003 and December 2013 there were 648 confirmed human cases of H5N1 infection in 15 countries, leading to 384 deaths. Experts say that if the H5N1 virus were to mutate and become easily transmissible between humans, the consequences for public health could be very serious.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nLewis B.

'Avian influenza is not easily transmitted from person to person. It is not the same virus that is currently present in seasonal influenza in Alberta. Public Health has followed up with all close contacts of this individual and offered Tamiflu [oseltamivir] as a precaution.

But officials repeatedly emphasized that there is no risk of transmission between humans.\n\nThe infected person, an Alberta resident who recently travelled to Beijing, China, died Jan. 3 [2014]. The case was confirmed in a lab test last night. It's the first such case in North America.\n\nThe person first showed symptoms of the flu on a Dec. 27 [2013] flight from Beijing to Vancouver aboard Air Canada flight 030. The passenger continued on to Edmonton on Air Canada flight 244, after spending a few hours in the Vancouver airport, and was admitted to hospital Jan. 1 [2014]. The symptoms of fever, malaise and headache worsened and the patient died two days later. The Public Health Agency of Canada was notified Jan. 5.\n\nThere were no respiratory symptoms, said Dr. James Talbot, Alberta's chief medical officer of health. Dr. James Talbot, Alberta's chief medical officer of health, noted the patient did not leave Beijing, or visit any farms or markets.\n\nThe diagnosis at the time of death was an inflammation of the brain and the linings that cover the brain. 'That is one of the ways that H5N1 patients die,' Talbot said.\nIt is not known how the patient contracted the disease. 'Virtually every case has a pretty strong link to a close contact with birds,' Talbot said, though he noted there are other settings in which a person might catch H5N1, such as a restaurant that kept live birds for slaughter.\n\nDr. Gregory Taylor, deputy chief public health officer, said the avian form of influenza has been found in birds, mainly poultry, in Asia, Europe, Africa and the Middle East.\n\nThere have been fewer than 650 human cases of bird flu in 15 countries over the last decade, primarily among people who have spent time around infected birds, he said. 'The illness [H5N1] causes in humans is severe and kills about 60 per cent of those who are infected,' Taylor said. 'No other illnesses of this type have been identified in Canada since the traveller returned from China. This is an isolated case.' The officials added that the patient was otherwise healthy and it's not yet clear how the person contracted H5N1.\n\n'This was a relatively young -- well, a young person compared to me, with no underlying health conditions,' he said. Taylor is 58.\n\nOfficials emphasized that this is not a disease transmitted between humans. There were two people travelling with the infected person, whom officials are following for 10 days to ensure they don't have any symptoms. They are also going to notify the other passengers from the flights between Beijing and Edmonton, and are following a group of the patient's 'close contacts.' Talbot said family members of the victim are being monitored and treated with medication, but noted that there's no sign they are sick.\n\nOfficials created confusion by referring to the patient as 'him' and 'her' in order to avoid identifying anyone. Officials said that they would not identify the sex, age or occupation of the patient. They also refused to say whether the infected passenger was an Edmonton resident or whether the patient went to hospital in Edmonton, although the final leg of the flight ended there. Talbot said reports that the patient was from Edmonton are erroneous.\n\nAmbrose, who phoned into a news conference in Ottawa, said Canadian officials are working with Chinese authorities on the case, as well as the World Health Organization. 'The risk of getting H5N1 is very low. This is not the regular seasonal flu.

There was no contact reported with live poultry, no visits to wet markets, or handling of fresh poultry. Work is ongoing to obtain a detailed account of activities during the trip.\n\nDuring the return flight on 27 Dec 2013, the individual experienced symptoms of malaise, chest pain, and fever and presented to the local Emergency Department on 28 Dec 2013. The complete blood count (CBC) showed a total white blood count (WBC) of 12.6 x 10 to the power of 9/L (reference range 4.0 - 10.0 x10 to the power of 9/L) with raised neutrophils (11.1 x 10 to the power of 9/L) and low lymphocytes (0.8 x 10 to the power of 9/L). A chest X-ray and CT scan revealed a right apical infiltrate. A diagnosis of pneumonia was made; the patient was prescribed levofloxacin and discharged home.\n\nThe individual returned to the same Emergency Department on 1 Jan 2014, now with worsening pleuritic [inflammation of the membrane surrounding the lung] chest pains and shortness of breath, a mild headache, exacerbated by head movement, right upper quadrant and epigastric pain, nausea and vomiting with no diarrhea. A chest X-ray showed a multi-lobar pneumonia, with moderate effusion, reflecting significant progression when compared with the X-ray from the 1st ED visit. A thoracentesis [a procedure to remove excess fluid in the space between the lungs and the chest wall], performed while in the ED, revealed a dark amber cloudy fluid that was sterile in bacterial culture. The CBC again showed a WBC count of 10.2 x 10 to the power of 9/L, neutrophil count of 9.5 x 10 to the power of 9/L, platelet count within the normal range, normal ALT, slightly elevated AST at 46 U/L (reference range 7 - 40 U/L) and LDH at 288 U/L (reference range 100 - 225 U/L).\n\nAdmission to a general medicine ward for investigation was facilitated, and treatment was initiated with intravenous piperacillin-tazobactam. On 2 Jan 2014, the individual reported visual changes and ongoing headache, and, coupled with increasing oxygen requirements, was admitted to the ICU for intubation and ventilation. In the early morning of 3 Jan 2014, the individual developed a sudden episode of tachycardia and severe hypertension followed by hypotension requiring inotropic support. At this point, pupils were dilated, and there was no response to pain.\n\nA CT brain scan suggested diffuse encephalitis and intracranial hypertension. The neurological examination was consistent with brain death. An MRI/MRA showed significant generalized edema, evidence of meningitis and ventriculitis [inflammation of the ventricles in the brain] and significant reduction in cerebral blood flow. A lumbar puncture was performed after brain death determination and prior to removal of ventilatory and inotropic support. The attending physician felt that, while unlikely, avian influenza was possible given the travel history and neurological symptoms, and contacted the local Medical Officer of Health on 3 Jan 2014 to report to public health. Contact tracing of family and hospital contacts was initiated as a precaution, given the severity of the illness and its rapid progression.\n\nLaboratory investigations: Blood cultures were negative as were cultures of the broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL) fluids for a range of bacterial pathogens. Nasopharyngeal swabs and BAL were sent to the Provincial Laboratory for complementary viral investigations for influenza and other respiratory viral agents, and CSF for the herpesvirus group, enterovirus and parechoviruses.\n\nScreening for influenza A and B and other respiratory viruses was performed on the respiratory samples (2 nasopharyngeal swabs and a BAL) through a combination of a direct fluorescent antigen (DFA) test (D3 Ultra DFA Influenza A/B reagent, Diagnostic Hybrids, Ohio), real time singleplex Taqman assays to influenza A and B assays targeting the matrix (M) gene of influenza A and NS1 gene of influenza B (1), and Luminex Respiratory Viral panel (Luminex, Ontario).\n\nThe swabs were negative by the DFA, however all these samples were positive for influenza A, with good Ct values in the Taqman assay, and were immediately subtyped, using real time assays to A(H1N1) pdm09 and seasonal H3 (2,3). Negative subtyping results were obtained on 2 independent runs, and when viewed in conjunction with recent travel history, strongly pointed to the possibility that this strain could be one of the avian subtypes known to occasionally infect humans. To investigate this possibility, a combination of real time and gel-based assays were performed to target the following genes H5, H7 and N9, on the viral RNA from the BAL, which had the highest titre of virus. Additionally, the M (matrix), NA (neuraminidase) and HA (haemagglutinin) genes were amplified and sequenced.\n\nA compilation of the results from all these assays indicated that this strain was an influenza A(H5N1) subtype. Supplementary testing performed at the National Microbiology Reference Laboratory, Winnipeg, confirmed our findings that this was an avian influenza A (H5N1) virus.\n\nSequence data of the HA and NA genes from both laboratories showed the following. From the HA sequence this virus; (a) belongs to clade 2.3.2.1, (b) is a highly pathogenic influenza A(H5), based upon the presence of multiple basic amino-acid residues occurring at the cleavage site, (c) has a wild-type receptor binding site, consistent with preferential affinity for the avian alpha-2-3 sialic-acid receptor. The NA sequence shows genotypic sensitivity to oseltamivir (Tamiflu) based upon the histidine residue at position 275. This genotypic susceptibility result was considered to be helpful information as chemoprophylaxis with oseltamivir had been prescribed for close contacts of the individual.\n\nOf interest is that the respiratory samples tested negative for influenza A in the Luminex Respiratory Viral panel but identified a human coronavirus 229E in the nasopharyngeal swabs, but not from the BAL. The negative influenza A results from this commercial assay were in contrast to the positive results obtained from the in-house Taqman assays.\n\nThe CSF collected also tested positive for influenza A and subtyped as H5.\n\nAn autopsy was not done due to concerns regarding the risk of virus transmission.\n\nThis case identifies a number of key issues, the 1st being the rapid onset and tragic death of a young, healthy traveler due to an avian influenza A(H5N1) infection. The index of suspicion was low as travel was to an area in China where there have been no recent reports of the circulation of this virus, and coupled with no obvious exposure to poultry, the diagnostic work-up and consideration for A(H5N1) infection was very low.\n\nThe clinical course, detection of the virus in the CSF, and results of imaging studies are consistent with an infection of the brain. A review of the literature indicates that such events are uncommon in humans, although animal models show that this virus is neurotropic and neuroinvasive (4,5).\n\nFrom a laboratory diagnosis aspect, this case shows the value of having screening assays, in-house or commercial, known to be capable of identifying all influenza subtypes. Often, the proprietary information of the target and detection sites of commercial assays makes it difficult to know if non-seasonal subtypes can be detected (6). In this case, the discrepant results between our in-house screening Taqman assays and the Luminex Respiratory Viral Panel were very helpful in indicating this strain was not a seasonal subtype.\n\nThe availability of advanced molecular tools at the Alberta Provincial Laboratory allowed us to suspect, within 24 hours of testing these samples, that this was an unusual strain. Such information was valuable in implementing appropriate communication processes to healthcare workers who cared for this patient and to regularly update the appropriate authorities.\n\nFinally, this infection of a Canadian resident is the 1st case of influenza A(H5N1) occurring in North America. With the rapidity of travel between countries and continents and the globalization of many cultures, this will likely not be the last case to occur in North America.\n\nReferences\n---------\n1.

By: Nan Cao and 11 others, published online 14 Nov 2013.\n\nAbstract\n----------\nBackground\nSince 1997, the H5 avian influenza viruses (AIVs) circulating in China have become an international concern. Clade 2.3.2 of H5N1 avian influenza viruses are genetically distinct from the viruses isolated before 2007 and antigenically different from the [veterinary] vaccine strains widely used in China. Swine farms in rural China are thought to play an important role in the ecology of avian influenza viruses.\n\nObjectives\nA seroepidemiological study was undertaken among swine farm residents and pigs to understand the prevalence of antibodies against H5N1 avian influenza viruses in southern China.\n\nStudy design\nDuring the period 24 Mar 2008 to 25 Dec 2012, serum samples were collected from 1606 swine farm residents on 40 swine farms in southern China. A total of 1980 pigs' serum samples were collected in the same swine farms where swine workers' serum samples were collected from March 2009 to March 2013. For a control group, 104 serum samples were collected from healthy city residents in Nanchang. All the serum samples were collected to perform hemagglutination inhibition (HI) and (neutralization) NT assays to investigate the prevalence of H5N1 avian influenza virus infections in southern China.\n\nResults\n16 human samples were positive by hemagglutination test assay, and 10 of these were also positive by neutralisation test assay against H5N1. No serum samples from human controls and pigs were positive for H5N1 avian influenza virus by hemagglutination assay.\n\nDiscussion\nOur results demonstrate minimal transmission of H5N1 avian influenza viruses from birds to pigs in the swine farms studied in this investigation, and the risk of poultry-to-human and poultry-to-pig transmission for at least clades 2.3.2 [viruses] seemed very low. This study provides the 1st data regarding antibodies against H5N1 avian influenza viruses in humans and pigs on swine farms in China.\n\nThe findings of this study can serve as a baseline for additional serologic studies to assess transmission of H5N1 viruses between avian species, pigs and swine workers.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n[Since the 1st confirmed human cases of H5N1 avian influenza virus infection were detected in 2003, there have been a total of 641 cases reported in 15 countries with 380 fatalities (as of 8 Oct 2013; see http://www.who.int/influenza/human_animal_interface/EN_GIP_20131008CumulativeNumberH5N1cases.pdf). Of these cases, 45 (with 30 fatalities) occurred in China. By 2013, with increased awareness of the potential risk for the human population, the global total of human cases of H5N1 virus infection had dwindled to 31 (only 2 of which occurred in China).\n\nThroughout this period, there have been no unambiguous records of human-to-human transmission of the H5N1 avian virus. But supportive seroprevalence data have been lacking. The investigation by Nan Cao and colleagues described above provides seroprevalence data that indicate that the risk of poultry-to-human and, additionally, poultry-to-pig transmission of at least the clades 2.3.2 avian H5N1 viruses has so far been very low in southern China.\n\nOnly the situation in Cambodia, with 20 (mostly children) of the 31 cases recorded so far in 2013, may show a different pattern. - Mod.CP\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/r/1zaU.]", "summary": "Our results demonstrate minimal transmission of H5N1 avian influenza viruses from birds to pigs in the swine farms studied in this investigation, and the risk of poultry-to-human and poultry-to-pig transmission for at least clades 2.3.2 [viruses] seemed very low.

The vaccine does not have a trade name in the United States. It is the 1st H5N1 vaccine approved in the United States to contain an adjuvant, or booster, that turbo-charges the body's immune response to the vaccine.\n\n'This vaccine could be used in the event that the H5N1 avian influenza virus develops the capability to spread efficiently from human to human, resulting in the rapid spread of disease across the globe,' Dr Karen Midthun, director of the FDA's biologics division, said in a statement. The FDA approved the vaccine for use in people over the age of 18 who are at increased risk of exposure to the virus. It would be distributed by public health officials if needed. The approval comes amid some uncertainty over the safety of modern adjuvants such as the one used in GSK's bird flu vaccine.\n\nHowever, there are no truly effective traditional vaccines against bird flu. GSK's super-charged [that is, adjuvant-containing] product is the first to show it can confer protection in the event of a pandemic. European regulators have approved it under the brand name Pumarix. Data show that children in England who received a similar adjuvanted vaccine, Pandemrix, during the 2009-10 H1N1 swine flu epidemic had a 14-fold heightened risk of developing narcolepsy, a chronic and potentially debilitating sleep disorder that can cause hallucinations, daytime sleepiness, and cataplexy, a form of muscle weakness precipitated by strong emotion. According to GSK, some 30 million doses of Pandemrix were administered across Europe and 800 people, mostly children, developed narcolepsy. While GSK has acknowledged an association between the vaccine and the narcolepsy cases, it has said there is insufficient evidence to prove the adjuvant was to blame.\n\nAdjuvants have been used in vaccines for diseases such as diphtheria and tetanus for decades. Now, a new, more powerful generation of adjuvants, including one known as AS03 that is contained in the bird flu vaccine, is being developed whose safety is relatively untested. Previously, the United States has taken a more cautious approach toward adjuvants than some other countries. The FDA did not, for example, approve Pandemrix. US experts felt that traditional, non-adjuvanted H1N1 vaccines made by Sanofi SA and others offered enough protection against the virus. But an advisory panel voted unanimously that the FDA should approve the vaccine against bird flu, which kills nearly 60 percent of those who become infected. By comparison, the H1N1 virus kills fewer than 1 percent of those infected.\n\nThe H5N1 bird flu virus was first isolated in a human in Hong Kong in 1997 and began to spread throughout Southeast Asia in 2003. A 2011 report by the World Health Organization showed only 566 people had been infected with bird flu worldwide [641 through 7 Oct 2013], compared with millions infected with the 2009 H1N1 swine flu virus. But the death rate for bird flu is far higher.\n\n[Byline: Toni Clarke]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n[According to WHO's assessment as of 7 Oct 2013 (http://www.who.int/influenza/human_animal_interface/Influenza_Summary_IRA_HA_interface_7October13.pdf), from 2003 through 7 Oct 2013, there have been 641 laboratory-confirmed human cases of avian influenza A(H5N1) virus infection officially reported to WHO from 15 countries.

The girl developed fever on 17 Oct 2013. On 19 Oct 2013, her parents sought treatment for her at a local private practitioner. Her condition worsened, and she was admitted to Jayavarman VII Hospital in Siem Reap on 25 Oct 2013 with fever, running nose, lethargy, dyspnea [shortness of breath], cough and breathing difficulties. Laboratory samples were taken the same day, but no Tamifu was administered. The girl died on 26 Oct 2013.\n\nInvestigations in Svay Chrum village by the Ministry of Health's Rapid Response Teams (RRT) and the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fishery's Animal Health Task Force revealed that 2 months before the girl's illness, poultry had suddenly died at her grandparent's house. The child often stayed with her grandparent in this house. Human and animal investigations are underway to determine whether the girl had direct exposure or handled the dead chickens.\n\nThe Ministry of Health's RRTs and the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fishery's Animal Health Task Force are working together closely in Svay Chrum village in Pursat to investigate and implement control measures. The RRTs are trying to identify the case's close contacts, any epidemiological linkage among the 23 [2013] cases, and initiating preventive treatment as required. The Animal Health Task Force is investigating cases of poultry deaths in the village.\n\n'Avian influenza H5N1 remains a serious threat to the health of all Cambodians and more so for children, who seem to be most vulnerable and are at high risk. There have been 23 cases of H5N1 infection in humans this year [2013]. Children often care for domestic poultry by feeding them, cleaning pens and gathering eggs. Children may also have closer contact with poultry as they often treat them as pets and also seem to be most vulnerable and are at high risk because they like to play where poultry are found. I urge parents and guardians to keep children away from sick or dead poultry and prevent them from playing with chickens and ducks. Parents and guardians must also make sure children thoroughly wash their hands with soap and water before eating and after any contact with poultry. Hands may carry the virus, which cannot be seen by the naked eye. Soap washes away the virus on hands. If children have fast or difficult breathing, their parents should seek medical attention at the nearest health facility, and attending physicians must be made aware of any exposure to sick or dead poultry,' said H.E. Dr. Mam Bunheng, Minister of Health.\n\nA nationwide public health education campaign using radio was launched in early October 2013. Also, public health education campaigns are being conducted in Svay Chrum village in Pursat using information, education, and communications materials to inform families on how to protect themselves from contracting avian influenza. The government's message is to wash hands often with soap and water before eating and after coming into contact with poultry; keep children away from poultry; keep poultry away from living areas; do not eat dead or sick poultry, and all poultry eaten should be well cooked.\n\nH5N1 influenza is a flu that normally spreads between sick poultry, but it can sometimes spread from poultry to humans. Human H5N1 avian influenza is a very serious disease that requires hospitalization. Although the virus currently does not easily spread among humans, if the virus changes, it could easily be spread like seasonal influenza. Hence, early recognition of cases is important.\n\nThe Ministry of Health will continue to keep the public informed of developments via the MoH website http://www.cdcmoh.gov.kh, where relevant health education materials can also be downloaded.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[A total of 15 countries have reported human cases of avian H5N1 since the 1st human cases appeared in 2003.

According to the release (http://www.cdcmoh.gov.kh/PressRelease/43-Pressrelease_Eg.pdf): The case is a 6-year-old girl from Romdoul village, Romdoul commune, Phnom Preuk district, Battambang province confirmed positive for H5N avian influenza virus infection on 24 Oct 2013 by Institut Pasteur du Cambodge. The girl developed fever on 14 Oct 2013. On 15 Oct 2013, her parents sought treatment for her in the village. The girl's condition worsened and the girl was referred to the Jayavarman VII Hospital in Siem Reap. On 19 Oct 2013 she was admitted to the Jayavarman VII Hospital with fever, cough, abdominal pain, running nose, sore throat and dyspnea. Laboratory samples were taken on 22 Oct 2013 and Tamiflu administered on 24 Oct 2013. The girl is currently in a stable condition.\n\nThis brings the total number of human H5N1 avian influenza cases to 22 this year [2013]. The investigation reveals that chickens and ducks have recently died in the girl's neighbor's house and in nearly villages. Health officials in Cambodia are identifying the child's close contacts as well as studying whether there are any epidemiologic links among the 22 patients infected this year. Animal health workers are investigating deaths in birds in the area. A statement from Minister of Health Dr. Mam Bunheng points out the special danger of H5N1 to children in that they commonly care for, feed, and clean the cages of domestic poultry and often treat them as pets. Parents are being urged through public health education campaigns to keep children away from sick or dead poultry, not allow them to play with chickens and ducks, and make sure they wash their hands with soap and water before eating and after contact with poultry.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Of the 33 confirmed human cases of H5N1 avian influenza virus recorded globally during 2013, a total of 22 have occurred in Cambodia.\n\nA map of the administrative divisions of Cambodia, showing the location of Battambang province, can be accessed at: http://www.vidiani.com/?p=3257. - Mod.CP\n\nA HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/r/90qV.]", "summary": "A ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n According to the release (http://www.cdcmoh.gov.kh/PressRelease/43-Pressrelease_Eg.pdf): The case is a 6-year-old girl from Romdoul village, Romdoul commune, Phnom Preuk district, Battambang province confirmed positive for H5N avian influenza virus infection on 24 Oct 2013 by Institut Pasteur du Cambodge. promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Of the 33 confirmed human cases of H5N1 avian influenza virus recorded globally during 2013, a total of 22 have occurred in Cambodia.

[Epub ahead of print]\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nAbstract\n--------\nWe used data on age and sex for 136 laboratory confirmed human A(H7N9) cases reported as of 11 Aug 2013 to compare age-specific and sex-specific patterns of morbidity and mortality from the avian influenza A(H7N9) virus with those of the avian influenza A(H5N1) virus. Human A(H7N9) cases exhibit high degrees of age and sex bias: mortality is heavily biased toward males older than 50 years, no deaths have been reported among individuals younger than 25 years old, and relatively few cases documented among children or adolescents. The proportion of fatal cases (PFC) for human A(H7N9) cases as of 11 Aug 2013 was 32 percent, compared to a cumulative PFC for A(H5N1) of 83 percent in Indonesia and 36 percent in Egypt. Approximately 75 percent of cases of all A(H7N9) cases occurred among individuals older than 45 years old.\n\nMorbidity and mortality from A(H7N9) are lowest among individuals between 10 and 29 years, the age group which exhibits the highest cumulative morbidity and case fatality rates from A(H5N1). Although individuals younger than 20 years old comprise nearly 50 percent of all human A(H5N1) cases, only 7 percent of all reported A(H7N9) cases and no deaths have been reported among individuals in this age group. Only 4 percent of A(H7N9) cases occurred among children younger than 5 years old, and only one case from the 10 to 20 year age group.\n\nAge- and sex-related differences in morbidity and mortality from emerging zoonotic diseases can provide insights into ecological, economic, and cultural factors that may contribute to the emergence and proliferation of novel zoonotic diseases in human populations.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[This new analysis of age and sex-specific morbidity and mortality in human patients reveals interesting common features of the A/(H5N1) and A/(H7N9) avian influenza virus infections.\n\nHuman infections with avian A/(H5N1) have occurred over a period of 10 years and have been reported in 15 countries from Turkey in the West to China in the East.

So far this year [2013], there have been 135 H7N9 cases, including 43 deaths. H5N1 reemerged in 2003 and has caused 633 human illnesses with 377 deaths since then, according to the World Health Organization. Both viruses showed a predilection for infecting the lower respiratory tract, caused severe pneumonia with high mortality, and involved primarily poultry-to-human transmission, says the report by researchers from Hong Kong and Hangzhou. Also, both pathogens cropped up in growing megacities (Shanghai and Hong Kong) that lie on migratory bird flyways with major river deltas and many poultry farms in the vicinity.\n\nGenetically, both viruses are reassortants that have internal genes from H9N2 viruses found in Asian poultry, and both have genetic markers of mammalian adaptation in their hemagglutinin and polymerase PB2 segments, the report says. Among the differences, the researchers note that the H7N9 cases were not preceded by poultry outbreaks, unlike the H5N1 emergence. Also, H7N9 patients on average were much older and were more likely to be male than those in the 1997 event.\n\nNoting that the rapid increase in human H7N9 infections from March to May of this year [2013] is unprecedented for avian flu viruses, the authors comment, 'Why H7N9 seems to be more readily transmitted from poultry to people than H5N1 is still unclear.' In other observations, they predict that stringent measures to control H7N9 in poultry will stop the human epidemic, but caution that increasing problems with avian flu are expected as poultry consumption rises in China and demand increases. Also, they write that further research is needed on whether the widespread use of H5N1 poultry vaccines in East Asia, along with lax biosecurity measures in the poultry industry, contributed to the emergence of H7N9.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The publication summarised above is entitled: 'The emergence of influenza A H7N9 in human beings 16 years after influenza A H5N1: a tale of two cities', authored by Kelvin KW To and 4 others, in The Lancet Infectious Diseases, September 2013;13(9):809-21; http://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(13)70167-1/fulltext.\n\nAbstract\n--------\n'Infection with either influenza A H5N1 virus in 1997 or avian influenza A H7N9 virus in 2013 caused severe pneumonia that did not respond to typical or atypical antimicrobial treatment, and resulted in high mortality. Both viruses are reassortants with internal genes derived from avian influenza A H9N2 viruses that circulate in Asian poultry. Both viruses have genetic markers of mammalian adaptation in their haemagglutinin and polymerase PB2 subunits, which enhanced binding to human-type receptors and improved replication in mammals, respectively. Hong Kong (affected by H5N1 in 1997) and Shanghai (affected by H7N9 in 2013) are 2 rapidly flourishing cosmopolitan megacities that were increasing in human population and poultry consumption before the outbreaks. Both cities are located along the avian migratory route at the Pearl River delta and Yangtze River delta. Whether the widespread use of the H5N1 vaccine in east Asia -- with suboptimal biosecurity measures in live poultry markets and farms -- predisposed to the emergence of H7N9 or other virus subtypes needs further investigation. Why H7N9 seems to be more readily transmitted from poultry to people than H5N1 is still unclear.'\n\nIt seems likely that reliance on poultry production as a source of food to sustain developing populations has been a contributory factor in the emergence of avian influenza as a human disease. The authors of 'Tale of Two Cities' develop the idea that both pathogens cropped up in growing megacities (Shanghai and Hong Kong) that lie on migratory bird flyways with major river deltas and many poultry farms in the vicinity. - Mod.CP]\n\n[From a veterinary perspective, the striking difference between A/H7N9 and the HPAI H5N1 is in their respective pathogenicity to animals (birds, particularly poultry). According to accumulated information, contrary to HPAI H5N1 which may cause severe disease in birds with high mortality rates, the A/H7N9 virus srain which has caused morbidity and deaths in humans in China, is of very low if any pathogenicity in birds.

In a lengthy perspective article in Lancet Infectious Diseases [see below and http://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(13)70167-1/fulltext], Chinese scientists find many parallels between the human outbreak of H7N9 avian influenza in China this year [2013] and H5N1 avian influenza as it emerged in Hong Kong in 1997, but also some major differences. In other observations, they predict that stringent measures to control H7N9 in poultry will stop the human epidemic, but caution that increasing problems with avian flu are expected as poultry consumption rises in China and demand increases. \n\nIt seems likely that reliance on poultry production as a source of food to sustain developing populations has been a contributory factor in the emergence of avian influenza as a human disease. AVIAN INFLUENZA, HUMAN (109) CHINA: H5N1 AND H7N9 EMERGENCE\n***********************************************************\n Both viruses showed a predilection for infecting the lower respiratory tract, caused severe pneumonia with high mortality, and involved primarily poultry-to-human transmission, says the report by researchers from Hong Kong and Hangzhou. Also, they write that further research is needed on whether the widespread use of H5N1 poultry vaccines in East Asia, along with lax biosecurity measures in the poultry industry, contributed to the emergence of H7N9. Genetically, both viruses are reassortants that have internal genes from H9N2 viruses found in Asian poultry, and both have genetic markers of mammalian adaptation in their hemagglutinin and polymerase PB2 segments, the report says. Hong Kong (affected by H5N1 in 1997) and Shanghai (affected by H7N9 in 2013) are 2 rapidly flourishing cosmopolitan megacities that were increasing in human population and poultry consumption before the outbreaks. The authors of 'Tale of Two Cities' develop the idea that both pathogens cropped up in growing megacities (Shanghai and Hong Kong) that lie on migratory bird flyways with major river deltas and many poultry farms in the vicinity.", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2003-03-25 00:00:00", "1997-03-25 00:00:00", "2013-03-25 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Hangzhou", "country": "China"}, {"location": "China", "country": "China"}, {"location": "Shanghai", "country": "China"}, {"location": "Hong Kong", "country": "Hong Kong"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "1990523", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Avian influenza, human (119): Indonesia (WJ) H5N1, fatal", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=1990523", "date": "2013-10-08 14:18:34", "main_text": "AVIAN INFLUENZA, HUMAN (119): INDONESIA (WEST JAVA) H5N1, FATAL\n***************************************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Mon 7 Oct 2013\nSource: CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research & Policy) News [edited]\nhttp://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2013/10/news-scan-oct-07-2013\n\n\nIndonesia confirms H5N1 death\n-----------------------------\nThe Indonesia Ministry of Health has confirmed the country's 2nd H5N1 case this year [2013], in a 28-year-old man from Bekasi [West Java].

Throughout 2009 Egyptian and German scientists took tracheal and cloacal swabs from 22 024 farm poultry, of which 23 birds (0.1 percent) were positive by polymerase chain reaction for the H5N1 virus. In comparison, 151 (10.5 percent) of 1435 birds in backyard flocks and 108 (11.4 percent) of 944 birds in live-bird markets were infected. Incidence was highest in spring and summer, particularly in backyard birds. The team also sampled 1297 wild birds of 28 different species in 2009 and 2010 and detected no H5N1. They conclude that backyard flocks may play a key role in maintaining H5N1 in Egyptian poultry, especially in live-bird markets.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The report above was derived from the abstract of the following paper:\nElham F El-Zoghby, Mona M Aly, Soad A Nasef , Mohamed K Hassan et al: Surveillance on A/H5N1 virus in domestic poultry and wild birds in Egypt. Virology Journal 2013; 10: 203 doi:10.1186/1743-422X-10-203 (http://www.virologyj.com/content/pdf/1743-422X-10-203.pdf).\n\nThe following 2 chapters are copied from the paper's original abstract:\n\n'Results\n--------\nIn this surveillance, A/H5N1 was detected from 0.1 percent (n=23) of examined commercial poultry farms, 10.5 percent (n=151) of backyard birds and 11.4 percent (n=108) of LBMs [live bird markets] but no wild bird tested positive for A/H5N1. The virus was detected from domestic poultry year-round with higher incidence in the warmer months of summer and spring particularly in backyard birds. Outbreaks were recorded mostly in Lower Egypt where 95.7 percent (n=22), 68.9 percent (n=104) and 52.8 percent (n=57) of positive commercial farms, backyards and LBMs were detected, respectively. Higher prevalence (56 percent, n=85) was reported in backyards that had mixed chickens and waterfowl together in the same vicinity and LBMs that had waterfowl (76 percent, n=82).\n\nConclusion\n----------\nOur findings indicated broad circulation of the endemic A/H5N1 among poultry in 2009 in Egypt. In addition, the epidemiology of A/H5N1 has changed over time with outbreaks occurring in the warmer months of the year. Backyard waterfowl may play a role as a reservoir and/or source of A/H5N1 particularly in LBMs. The virus has been established in poultry in the Nile Delta where major metropolitan areas, dense human population and poultry stocks are concentrated. Continuous surveillance, tracing the source of live birds in the markets and integration of multifaceted strategies and global collaboration are needed to control the spread of the virus in Egypt.'\n\nSince 2006 and as of June 2013, Egypt has reported 173 human cases of HPAI H5N1, of which 63 died.\n\nIn its annual OIE report for 2012, Egypt reported 12 HPAI H5N1 outbreaks in domestic poultry.

Soon after, other ducks in fattening cages also showed the same signs with some mortalities. Initially, these signs were thought to be due to a problem in the feed. On 2 May 2013, with increasing mortality noticed in the ducks, the Central Veterinary Station (CVS) was informed and some samples were sent for testing. Testing confirmed the samples to be positive for H5 HPAI. Follow-up testing with RT-PCR on 7 May 2013, confirmed the samples as positive for H5N1. More than 2000 adult ducks, 42 000 fattening ducks, and 129 000 ducklings (younger than 20 days) died or were culled. It is assumed that some ducks were free-range and might have had the opportunity to contact H5N1 infected wild birds.\n\n'Disease control measures were strictly taken and appropriate biosecurity was strictly enforced. Public awareness activities for the factory workers and residents around, as well as an epidemiological survey, have vigorously been conducted, and to date [9 May 2013], no human illness due to H5N1 has been found. Delay in testing and confirmation was related to the lack of appropriate reagents.

The cases were from the following countries: Bangladesh (1), Cambodia (1), Egypt (2), and Viet Nam (2). The UN agency says that after investigation, the 6 cases are considered sporadic.\n\nSo far this year [2013], Cambodia has reported 10 cases of the lethal virus in humans, resulting in 8 fatalities. Health authorities say cases do not seem to be linked directly, and most had contact with sick poultry in their villages. Since 2003, there have been 628 laboratory confirmed human cases of avian influenza A(H5N1) virus infection officially reported to WHO from 15 countries, of which 374 died (about 60 per cent).\n\nAccording to WHO, the H5N1 virus subtype (different from the H7N9 strain circulating in the current China outbreak) is a highly pathogenic AI virus, which first infected humans in 1997 during a poultry outbreak in Hong Kong SAR, China. Since its widespread re-emergence in 2003 and 2004, this avian virus has spread from Asia to Europe and Africa and has become entrenched in poultry in some countries, resulting in millions of poultry infections, several hundred human cases, and many human deaths.\n\nThe case fatality rate for H5N1 virus infections in people is much higher than that of seasonal influenza infections. Clinically, in many patients, the disease caused by the H5N1 virus follows an unusually aggressive clinical course, with rapid deterioration and high fatality. Like most emerging disease, H5N1 influenza in humans is poorly understood.\n\nThe incubation period for H5N1 avian influenza may be longer than that for normal seasonal influenza, which is around 2 to 3 days. Current data for H5N1 infection indicate an incubation period ranging from 2 to 8 days and possibly as long as 17 days. WHO currently recommends that an incubation period of 7 days be used for field investigations and the monitoring of patient contacts. Initial symptoms include a high fever, usually with a temperature higher than 38 deg C [100.4 deg F], and other influenza-like symptoms. Diarrhoea, vomiting, abdominal pain, chest pain, and bleeding from the nose and gums have also been reported as early symptoms in some patients.\n\nOne feature seen in many patients is the development of lower respiratory tract early in the illness. On present evidence, difficulty in breathing develops around 5 days following the 1st symptoms. Respiratory distress, a hoarse voice, and a crackling sound when inhaling are commonly seen. Sputum production is variable and sometimes bloody.\n\n[byline: Robert Herriman]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail from HealthMap Alerts\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[All these recent human cases of avian A/(H5N1) influenza virus infection have been recorded in detail in ProMED-mail during the past few weeks.

Writing in Science, the researchers say that 5 of 127 hybrids they generated by shuffling genes [that is, genome subunits] from the 2 subtypes showed 'highly efficient' transmission in guinea pigs. None of the guinea pigs died, but some mice that were infected with the reassortant strains did succumb.\n\nGuinea pigs are not regarded as the best experimental model for human flu, a distinction that belongs to ferrets [that is, the most susceptible mammal]. The Chinese team did not test any of the hybrid viruses in ferrets, because a voluntary moratorium on 'gain of function' research on H5N1 virus -- studies involving the creation of potentially dangerous new strains -- intervened in January 2012 and lasted a year. The moratorium was prompted by the controversy that erupted in late 2011 over 2 earlier studies in which researchers generated novel H5N1 strains that spread among ferrets via respiratory droplets. One of the studies involved an H5N1-H1N1 reassortant, while the other involved an H5N1 virus in which specific mutations were induced. The US National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity (NSABB) sought to prevent publication of full details of the 2 studies but eventually reversed itself, and the studies were published in May and June of 2012. In a statement to reporters, the editors of Science said the new Chinese study 'provides evidence that H5N1 viruses spread by air between mammals can be generated by reassortment. Reassortment, as it occurs in nature, however, is much slower.'\n\nIn another study on H5N1 transmissibility, also published today [2 May 2013] in Science, another team of Chinese researchers examined how hemagglutinin (HA) from H5N1 attaches to human cell receptors. They identified a mutation, Q226L, that enables a mutant form of H5N1 HA to bind to both avian and human receptors.\n\nIn the reassortant study, the team focused on H5N1 and pH1N1 because both viruses can infect pigs, suggesting the possibility that reassortants could arise naturally. The researchers, led by Ying Zhang of the Harbin Veterinary Research Institute, conducted their experiments in enhanced animal biosafety level 3 (ABSL-3) conditions at that institute. They say all the experiments were done before the moratorium began. The scientists used an H5N1 virus isolated from a duck in China in 2001 and the 1st pH1N1 strain that was identified in China during the 2009 pandemic. Using reverse genetics, they generated 127 reassortants that combined the H5N1 virus's HA gene with all possible combinations of the other 7 genes from the pH1N1 isolate. The reassortants were easily generated, and all grew efficiently in chicken eggs, the report says. The authors used genetically modified mice to test the virulence of the hybrid viruses. They found that 54 of the reassortants had about the same virulence as the original H5N1 duck virus, killing some of the mice; 38 viruses were less pathogenic than the H5N1 strain; and 35 viruses were more virulent, killing all the mice.\n\nThe researchers say guinea pigs are comparable with ferrets as models of human flu transmission. Although guinea pigs have both avian and mammalian types of airway receptors, flu viruses that bind only to avian receptors (alpha2,3-linked sialic acids) don't spread by respiratory droplets in the animals, they report. The team used the original H5N1 and pH1N1 viruses and 19 of their reassortants to test for airborne transmission in guinea pigs. For each strain, 3 guinea pigs were dosed with the virus, and 3 other guinea pigs were placed in cages near them but not close enough for direct contact. The scientists found 'highly efficient' airborne transmission of the pH1N1 virus in 5 of the 19 reassortants. The results indicated that the PA (acidic polymerase) and NS (nonstructural protein) genes of the pH1N1 virus can make H5N1 highly transmissible by respiratory droplets in guinea pigs and that the NA (neuraminidase) and M (matrix) genes from the pH1N1 also promote such transmission of H5N1. 'These transmission studies indicate that many of the H5N1 hybrid viruses bearing one or more of the PA, NA, M, or NS genes of 2009/H1N1 were transmissible in guinea pigs,' the report states.\n\nThe scientists say they previously showed that a mutant strain of a duck H5N1 isolate, with changes at HA positions 226 and 228, bound exclusively to human receptors (alpha2,6-linked sialic acids). They found that this mutant, which contains the same combination of mutations as reported in the ferret-transmissible H5N1 virus reported by Ron Fouchier, PhD and colleagues in 2012, did not transmit in guinea pigs. 'Our studies provide evidence that H5N1 viruses that are capable of respiratory droplet transmission between mammals can be generated by reassortment between mammalian 2009/H1N1 and avian H5N1 viruses,' the report concludes. 'Since the internal genes of these reassortants can already replicate efficiently in mammalian hosts, we predict that similar reassortants could infect humans and subsequently acquire mutations that improve binding efficacy for alpha2,6-linked sialic acids,' it states.\n\nThe Science statement says that studies in a more human-like animal model, such as ferrets, were halted by the research moratorium, 'but these are the potential next steps if the influenza research community decides it is important to quantify the degree of threat from avian influenza viruses.'\n\n[These experiments are described in the following publications:\n\nZhang Y, Zhang Q, Kong H, et al.

Science 2013 May 2 (Early online publication) [abstract http://www.sciencemag.org/content/early/2013/05/01/science.1236787]\n\nThe reactions\n-------------\nThe report drew varied reactions from other experts consulted by CIDRAP News, with one hailing it as a useful contribution and others questioning whether the findings were worth the risks involved in the experiments.\n\nAndrew Pekosz, PhD, a virologist at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore, said the study provides new information about the kinds of genetic combinations that can lead to flu transmission, which is useful for flu surveillance. 'The more we understand how wide-ranging those combinations of genetic changes are that can lead to this kind of transmission, the better off we'll be,' he said. 'That knowledge helps inform us what we should be looking for regarding viruses that are potential human pathogens.' He commented that the study doesn't provide 'any kind of lightning-strike or light-bulb observations, but it helps tell us what to be looking for in terms of viruses acquiring transmissibility.'\n\nPekosz said he thinks the findings justify any risks involved in the experiments: 'As far as I could tell from reading this and being familiar with the group and how they do their research, everything falls under the guidelines that apply to labs in the US regarding biocontainment, respiratory protection, and monitoring. ... I think the safety concerns are well taken care of.' He also commented that it's difficult to make 'direct leaps' from the guinea pig findings to what would happen in the human population, but the results suggest the possibility that the reassortants could spread in humans. He noted that guinea pigs are not as widely used as ferrets in flu transmission experiments because they've only been rediscovered in that regard in the past decade or so. 'I think another important thing about this paper is this is a directed or systematic creation of reassortant viruses, which makes it hard to say if these would occur in natural infection,' Pekosz said. 'You're not allowing for the natural competition that would take place in an infected animal.'\n\nDavid Relman, MD, a microbiologist and infectious disease expert at Stanford University, expressed concern over the biosecurity implications of the study. 'It clearly has biosecurity concerns,' he said in an interview. 'I would have liked to see these experiments discussed by a wider community of scientists and nonscientists before they were undertaken. ... I would have some grave questions about doing these without having a clearer idea of how exactly the results would lead to tangible real-time benefits. Having a BSL-3 lab and not working during the moratorium does not address the issue,' he said.\n\nSimon Wain-Hobson, PhD, a veteran HIV researcher and an opponent of gain-of-function experiments, was more sharply critical of the study. He is a professor at the Pasteur Institute in Paris and chairs the board of the Foundation for Vaccine Research, a privately funded group that recently asked President Obama's Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues to review the ethics of experiments designed to increase the transmissibility of H5N1 viruses. In a written statement, Wain-Hobson said this study, along with the earlier ones by Fouchier and Yoshihiro Kawaoka, DVM, PhD, show that many different starting points and different experimental protocols can lead to a flu virus capable of airborne transmission. He said it's impossible to predict the pathway that might lead to a pandemic flu virus in nature. 'Which evolutionary trajectory will nature take?' he said. 'We don't know because there are simply too many. So what is the use [of the findings] for surveillance? What we learn [from the H5N1 transmissibility studies in general] is that, qualitatively, flu can exploit a huge fraction of sequence space and can adapt to almost anything given time,' Wain-Hobson said. 'But this we knew, not only from flu work, but also from RNA virology in general. ...

Although guinea pigs have both avian and mammalian types of airway receptors, flu viruses that bind only to avian receptors (alpha2,3-linked sialic acids) don't spread by respiratory droplets in the animals, they report. Our studies provide evidence that H5N1 viruses that are capable of respiratory droplet transmission between mammals can be generated by reassortment between mammalian 2009/H1N1 and avian H5N1 viruses,' the report concludes. ' These transmission studies indicate that many of the H5N1 hybrid viruses bearing one or more of the PA, NA, M, or NS genes of 2009/H1N1 were transmissible in guinea pigs,' the report states. The Science statement says that studies in a more human-like animal model, such as ferrets, were halted by the research moratorium, 'but these are the potential next steps if the influenza research community decides it is important to quantify the degree of threat from avian influenza viruses.' The Chinese team did not test any of the hybrid viruses in ferrets, because a voluntary moratorium on 'gain of function' research on H5N1 virus -- studies involving the creation of potentially dangerous new strains -- intervened in January 2012 and lasted a year. They found that 54 of the reassortants had about the same virulence as the original H5N1 duck virus, killing some of the mice; 38 viruses were less pathogenic than the H5N1 strain; and 35 viruses were more virulent, killing all the mice. The results indicated that the PA (acidic polymerase) and NS (nonstructural protein) genes of the pH1N1 virus can make H5N1 highly transmissible by respiratory droplets in guinea pigs and that the NA (neuraminidase) and M (matrix) genes from the pH1N1 also promote such transmission of H5N1. ' H5N1 hybrid viruses bearing 2009/H1N1 virus genes transmit in guinea pigs by respiratory droplet. The authors conclude since the internal genes of these reassortants facilitate efficient replication in mammalian hosts, it is likely that similar reassortants could promote infection of humans and subsequently acquire mutations that improve binding efficacy to the alpha2,6-linked sialic acids receptors. \n\nAndrew Pekosz, PhD, a virologist at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore, said the study provides new information about the kinds of genetic combinations that can lead to flu transmission, which is useful for flu surveillance. ' The team used the original H5N1 and pH1N1 viruses and 19 of their reassortants to test for airborne transmission in guinea pigs. Writing in Science, the researchers say that 5 of 127 hybrids they generated by shuffling genes [that is, genome subunits] from the 2 subtypes showed 'highly efficient' transmission in guinea pigs. For each strain, 3 guinea pigs were dosed with the virus, and 3 other guinea pigs were placed in cages near them but not close enough for direct contact. \n\n[byline: Robert Roos]\n\n--\ncommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n< In a written statement, Wain-Hobson said this study, along with the earlier ones by Fouchier and Yoshihiro Kawaoka, DVM, PhD, show that many different starting points and different experimental protocols can lead to a flu virus capable of airborne transmission. Since the internal genes of these reassortants can already replicate efficiently in mammalian hosts, we predict that similar reassortants could infect humans and subsequently acquire mutations that improve binding efficacy for alpha2,6-linked sialic acids,' it states.

There have been no known cases in humans,' said Muhammad Azhar, coordinator of the Avian Influenza Disease Control Unit. 'We have taken necessary measures to control the outbreak.'\n\nMore than a dozen subsets of the H5N1 virus have been identified -- with numerous variants within each clade. Although new to Indonesia, clade 2.3.2 H5N1 has been circulating across Asia for several years, say experts.\n\nReared ducks began dying on Indonesia's populous Java Island in September [2012], with the disease spreading to 80 villages in 12 of Indonesia's 34 provinces. Affected ducks show clinical symptoms such as torticollis, paralysis, seizures, incoordination, and sudden death.\n\nMost poultry kept by Indonesians are chickens; only a small minority keep ducks.\n\n'The origin of the infection was apparently uncertified imported ducks,' said Emil Agustiono, head of the National Commission on Zoonosis. 'But luckily we have discovered the vaccine [for poultry] and will start production in Feb [2013]. For now we're using the old vaccine and it's still effective.'\n\nThe government needs at least another 25 million doses of the H5N1 clade 2.3.2 vaccine, and will compensate farmers affected by the outbreak, though the amount of compensation has not been decided, he added.\n\nThe Health Ministry's Aditama said many countries had reported the presence of clade 2.3 and there had been 8 known bird flu cases in humans caused by the strain -- 3 in Bangladesh and 5 in China.\n\n'So far Indonesia has not seen infection from ducks to humans or bird flu cases in humans caused by clade 2.3, but I expect that generally the medium of infection is similar to that of clade 2.1,' he said.\n\nHealth officials have advised that control activities in humans had not changed with the new clade, he said. 'Data on antiviral sensitivity is limited from the human cases, but there is no reason to expect a change.'\n\nIn response to the outbreak, Agustiono said the government was strengthening surveillance and tightening the movement of poultry between provinces to stem the outbreak.\n\nMillions of domestic chickens and ducks have been culled worldwide. 'The spread of the virus is epidemiologically controllable and we're doing what we can to stop it,' he said, adding: 'This outbreak has disrupted the animal husbandry sector and more importantly, is a public health issue.'\n\nIndonesia stopped importing poultry from Australia in December [2012] following a bird flu outbreak there, he said. However, there has been no ban on imports of certified ducks from other countries.\n\nAbout 60 million Indonesians keep poultry, including ducks, in their homesteads. Indonesia's animal husbandry sector is worth USD 2 billion, government statistics show.\n\nAgriculture Minister Suswono, who like many Indonesians goes by only one name, said the outbreak was not yet an emergency.\n\n'According to our data, 160 000 ducks have died and compared to the population of 50 million reared ducks that's a small number,' he told reporters.\n\nHumans in Indonesia have been more affected by avian influenza than in any other country: of the 189 confirmed bird flu cases since 2005, 157 were fatal.\n\nOn 20 Dec [2012], the World Health Organization (WHO) said sporadic human cases reported that month in countries with known H5N1 virus activity in poultry were within the expected range. 'No onward sustained human-to-human transmission was reported,' it said.\n\nSince the H5N1 virus first appeared in 2003, there have been 610 laboratory-confirmed human cases globally -- 363 of them fatal -- with Indonesia seeing the largest number of deaths, according to WHO.\n\nGlobally, H5N1 has killed or forced the culling of more than 400 million domestic chickens and ducks, and caused an estimated USD 20 billion of economic damage. It was eliminated from most of the 63 countries infected at its peak in 2006, the UN Food and Agriculture Organization reports.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The following relevant commentary, by Mod.CP, was included in ProMED-mail archive no 20111024.3168:\n\n'The amount of sequence data now available is remarkable and has allowed the definition of some 13 clades, indicative of the rapid and extensive diversification of the H5 avian influenza viruses.

New types of bird flu in Indonesia are expected because of the bird flu virus mutation; this is under detailed research.", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["2003-03-25 00:00:00", "2068-03-25 00:00:00", "2005-03-25 00:00:00", "2011-09-21 00:00:00", "2021-11-25 00:00:00", "2021-03-30 00:00:00", "2012-03-25 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "India", "country": "India"}, {"location": "Yogyakarta", "country": "Indonesia"}, {"location": "Java", "country": "Indonesia"}, {"location": "West Java", "country": "Indonesia"}, {"location": "Indonesia", "country": "Indonesia"}, {"location": "Iwantoro", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Viet Nam", "country": "Vietnam"}, {"location": "Thailand", "country": "Thailand"}, {"location": "China", "country": "China"}, {"location": "Egypt", "country": "Egypt"}]}]}, {"archive_id": "1300398", "headline": "PRO/AH/EDR> Avian influenza (56): Viet Nam, H5N1, spread", "url": "https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=1300398", "date": "2012-09-20 09:13:42", "main_text": "AVIAN INFLUENZA (56): VIET NAM, H5N1, SPREAD\n********************************************\nA ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\nDate: Wed 19 Sep 2012\nSource: Viet Nam News (VNS) [edited]\nhttp://vietnamnews.vnagency.com.vn/social-issues/230295/virulent-bird-flu-strain-emerges.html\n\n\nA highly-virulent, newly-mutated bird flu H5N1 strain is feared to [be] spreading from north Viet Nam to the south at a menacing pace, warned deputy head of Animal Health Department Pham Van Dong.\n\nSpeaking in Ha Noi yesterday [18 Sep 2012], Dong, whose department comes under the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, said the outbreak of this strain started in July [2012] and has so far attacked 7 northern provinces plus the central province of Quang Ngai.\n\nTo prevent further spreading to the south, the ministry has ordered provinces to strengthen inspection and control activities.\n\nIn the meantime, live poultry due to be carried from north to south will not pass through the central provinces of Quang Ngai or Kon Tum until the outbreak is completely under control.\n\nThe ministry also asked local authorities to clamp down on illegal poultry imports and to tighten inspections of trans-border poultry loads destined for Viet Nam.\n\nAt the same time, vaccination and disinfection activities should be strengthened in affected areas.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[According to the report above, the central province of Quang Ngai has now been added to the 7 northern provinces reported to be infected by the mutated H5N1 strain in ProMED-mail posting 20120908.1286497.\n\nThe said strain was suspected to have been introduced from China, mainly by means of culled layers, which come in large numbers across the border from China.

Normally, avian influenza appears shortly before or after the traditional lunar Tet holidays (which often fall in late January and early February). However, it has appeared since July this year [2012] and spread fast without warning. In the Central Highlands' Dak Lak province, about 30 influenza epidemic spots were found in only one day.\n\nAccording to local experts, the epidemic will become more complicated once it reaches its peak in the coming months.\n\nMARD has instructed the department to strictly supervise the import of poultry, especially breeding chicks, which are believed to make the suspected new strain virus spread faster [Are imported breeding chicks (from where?) suspected of introducing infection or of being excessively susceptible to local infection? Clarification will help. - Mod.AS].\n\nMeanwhile, according to the Central Epidemic Prevention Institute, since August last year [2011], the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) has warned of the change of the virus A/H5N1. Clade 2.3.2 is in many Asian countries, including Viet Nam, and that change is usual during the natural evolution of the virus.\n\n'This is a small change of the virus that creates a new strain, not yet a new virus. However, close supervision of the virus which is spreading among poultry should be taken so as to discover its change and set forth an appropriate strategy to fight the epidemic and protect human health,' the Institute Director Nguyen Tran Hien told local media late last week.\n\n'Through strict supervision on human flu infected cases, we found nothing unusual. The most concern is that the virus A/H5N1 is spreading among poultry, and it can continue to have small changes, re-arrange the gene, and reunite with virus circulated among animals and human beings to become a new, highly-toxic strain and transmissible to human beings,' Hien said.\n\nHe also suggested the veterinary sector closely cooperate with the health service to enhance supervision on the avian flu among poultry and human beings as well as apply preventive measures so as to prevent the spreading of the disease among poultry and from poultry to human beings.\n\nAs of 6 Sep 2012 [since the beginning of 2012], 4 [human] cases of A/H5N1 infection have been recorded with 2 deaths in Viet Nam, but the new strain of bird flu virus has not yet been found in humans, reported MARD.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nNati Elkin\n<Nati@poultrymed.com>\n\n[The above report, from Chinese sources, adds complementary information to posting 20120908.1286497.\n\nWe are indebted to Joseph P.

The AFCD has closed the shop and removed all the birds to the Department's animal management centre in Sheung Shui for disposal.\n\nAs a precautionary measure, the Bird Garden will be closed for 21 days starting today [5 Jul 2012].\n\nThe AFCD has required all pet bird shop operators in the Bird Garden to undertake a thorough cleansing of their stalls. The Leisure and Cultural Services Department will step up cleansing of the Bird Garden. The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) will also enhance street cleansing in the vicinity of the Bird Garden.\n\nPet bird stalls in the Bird Garden are being closely monitored. So far nothing abnormal has been detected. AFCD staff will step up the inspection of all the stalls and collect swab samples for testing.\n\nThe Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health has put all stall operators and workers under medical surveillance.\n\nThe spokesman said that the AFCD collects some 300 swab samples each month from 39 pet bird stalls across the territory, including the 18 stalls at the Bird Garden, to test for avian flu viruses. More than 1700 swab samples have been collected from the stalls so far this year [2012].\n\nOf the 3200 samples that were tested last year [2011], none was positive for avian influenza.\n\nThe CHP has set up a hotline (2125 1122) to provide health advice to the public who might have recently visited pet bird shops located in the Bird Garden and had close contact with birds in the area. They are advised to seek medical advice as soon as possible if they develop respiratory symptoms.\n\nSeparately, avian influenza testing on a dead house crow collected at 10 Osmanthus Road, Yau Yat Chuen, Kowloon Tong on 29 Jun 2012 has returned a positive result for the H5N1 virus today [5 Jul 2012]. Cleansing and disinfection have been stepped up at the venue.\n\nThe AFCD has phoned poultry farmers to remind them to strengthen precautionary and biosecurity measures against avian influenza.\n\nLetters have been issued to farmers, pet bird shop owners, and licence holders of pet poultry and racing pigeons reminding them that proper precautions must be taken.\n\nThe spokesman said the department would conduct frequent inspections of poultry farms and the wholesale market to ensure that proper precautions against avian influenza have been implemented. The department will continue its wild bird monitoring and surveillance.\n\n'People should avoid personal contact with wild birds and live poultry and their droppings. They should clean their hands thoroughly after coming into contact with them. The public can call 1823 for follow-up if they come across suspicious sick or dead birds, including the carcasses of wild birds and poultry,' the spokesman said.\n\nThe FEHD will continue to be vigilant over imported live poultry as well as live poultry stalls. It will also remind stall operators to maintain good hygiene.\n\nThe AFCD, the FEHD, the Customs and Excise Department and the Police will strive to deter the illegal import of poultry and birds into Hong Kong to minimise the risk of avian influenza outbreaks caused by imported poultry and birds that have not gone through inspection and quarantine.\n\nAll relevant government departments will continue to remain highly vigilant and strictly enforce preventive measures against avian influenza.\n\nHealth advice is available from the 'H5N1 Health Advice' on the AFCD website at http://www.afcd.gov.hk/eindex.html.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The communication above is presented as a reminder of the exemplary, official avian influenza control and surveillance programme, which has been operational for several years in HKSAR to protect man and animal.

One can only imagine how these birds were being smuggled into Taiwan and how they were found. Unfortunately, the welfare of these smuggled birds was probably not a high priority for the smugglers, but another, absolutely key question is what kind of potential human contacts ensued because these HPAI H5N1 birds were subjected to smuggling.\n\nAlso, smuggled birds are not the only concern when it comes to protection of human and animal health. Meats and other foods that can cause foot and mouth disease or African swine fever are always a big concern. The movement of smuggled bushmeat has global ecosystem health implications as well as the potential to aid the emergence of a novel virus, as Nathan Wolfe's work has indicated.\n\nSo, when budget cutters around the world want to sharpen their respective axes, they should think carefully of how to preserve a viable, effective system and what it costs to do so.\n\nFor those who have further interest in this vital subject, the Institute of Medicine's (IOM) report from the US National Academies is available.

In the latest incident, the robin, which is common to Hong Kong, was found and collected at Hok Loo Lane.

'It is not a huge surprise that the two birds of the same species were found dead in Cheung Chau within two days, especially in winter,' said Billy Hau Chi-hang, University of Hong Kong assistant professor in biodiversity and conservation. 'One bird may come in contact with another, which has already contracted the H5 avian influenza virus.'\n\nThe department also announced on Tuesday [28 Feb 2012] that a crested goshawk, which is not common to Hong Kong, also tested positive for H5.

This information provides clarifying context to comments made by Dr. Ron Fouchier, who led the Rotterdam lab that created [i.e. isolated] a mutant H5N1 avian influenza virus that became respiratory-transmissible while still maintaining its ability to kill some of the ferrets used in the experiments.\n\nFor example, in the [20 Jan 2012] Science Insider article by Martin Enserink based on an interview with Dr. Fouchier, and translated from Dutch, he states: 'Also, as researchers, we work very closely with people in Indonesia. It would be very unwise not to share our results with our close collaborators.'\n\nIn response to the question: 'You also want to repeat the experiments with more H5N1 strains?' Dr. Fouchier replied: 'Yes. We did this with one genetic lineage of the H5N1 virus. The question is whether all lineages can become aerosol-transmissible. If they can't, if it's just this lineage, perhaps you can focus on the region where it came from and try to stop H5N1 outbreaks there to prevent a pandemic. If it can happen everywhere, you've got to work everywhere.' The genetic lineage, or clade, of the H5N1 avian influenza virus that has circulated in Indonesia is one found predominately only in Indonesia and is a distinct clade from those found in other parts of Asia or Africa. Thus, it is rational to have one or more scientists from Indonesia participating in the WHO meeting next week, even if the sharing of the H5N1 virus isolate from Indonesia with the Rotterdam lab occurred before the May 2011 WHO's Pandemic Influenza Preparedness (PIP) Framework went into effect.\n\nThe rationale for the leading role of Indonesia from 2007-2011 in what would, after much controversy and debate, become the PIP Framework document is detailed in the Ann Acad Med Singapore 2008; 37: 482-88 paper co-authored by the current and immediate past Minister of Health entitled: 'Towards Mutual Trust, Transparency and Equity in Virus Sharing Mechanism: The Avian Influenza Case of Indonesia'.\n\n--\nContributed by:\nDaniel R.

The answer is no.\n\n- Has the concerned work produced the virus that will certainly appear in nature and constitute a new threat for human beings, so that it deserves and allows new research, looking for vaccine or antivirals? Again, the answer is no. H5N1 could naturally evolve in a way different enough to pose different problems, particularly regarding vaccine design. However, a potentially dangerous virus now exists and it could 'leak' from a laboratory. 'Mother Nature' is not the 'mother of bioterrorism,' as some scientists are now used to saying!\n\n- Has the concerned work given the signal to evil-minded people that a terrifying agent could be obtained from H5N1 virus? The answer is yes: Make some efforts, they will probably be successful!\n\n- Has the concerned work sufficient scientific or technical originality or interest (Using particular, non-natural conditions, a pathogenic virus can mutate to a -- potentially -- more pathogenic one: What's new?) to deserve publication in journals we generally regard as prestigious? I am not sure, unless media impact has became the main criteria for good research. As V. Racaniello says, 'If you think you can (do a risk-benefit analysis), you are wrong.' I totally agree.

The 2-hour session, which was live-streamed on the Web, left no clear impression of how the current controversy or future dilemmas over conduct and publication of 'dual use' research might be resolved. One of very few points on which the panelists were unanimous was the hope that the current battle won't be repeated.\n\nThe 2 studies involved the generation of an H5N1 virus and an H5N1-H1N1 reassortant that spread among ferrets via respiratory droplets. In December the National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity (NSABB), which advises the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), recommended that the details be deleted from the two reports before they are published. HHS agreed and passed the recommendation to Science and Nature. The journals have signaled they will go along with the recommendation if a way can be found to provide the details of the reports to scientists with a legitimate need for them. But since the NSABB recommendation was unveiled, scientists, biosecurity experts, and public health officials have vigorously debated the issue in the media and in journal commentaries.\n\nMichael T. Osterholm, PhD, MPH, an NSABB member, said the board set up a working group to consider the two manuscripts and brought in outside expert advisors, [which] spent 'hundreds and hundreds of hours' discussing the problem, leading to unanimous support for the recommendation to withhold the details of the studies. Osterholm is director of the University of Minnesota's Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy, which publishes CIDRAP News.\n\nArturo Casadevall, MD, PhD, the other NSABB member on the panel, said he initially thought the studies should be published in full, 'but as a result of the deliberative process, I changed my mind.' He is a professor of microbiology and immunology at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in the Bronx, N.Y. When panel moderator Ian Lipkin, MD, later asked Casadevall if any other NSABB members changed their minds during the discussions, he declined comment other than to say there was a long deliberative process. Lipkin is a professor of epidemiology and of neurology and pathology at Columbia University. Both Osterholm and Casadevall emphasized they were speaking as individuals and not on behalf of the NSABB.\n\nDebate over case-fatality ratio\n--------------------------------------\nMuch of the debate focused on questions related to how much of a threat the mutant viruses represent. That began early in the session, when Osterholm and Peter Palese, PhD, argued about the case-fatality ratio (CFR) for human H5N1 infections. Palese is a professor of microbiology and chair of the Department of Microbiology at Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York City.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) lists 583 confirmed H5N1 cases with 344 deaths since 2003, for a CFR of 59%. Palese contended, as he has previously in other forums, that this ratio is too high, because only severe cases are being counted. 'Only hospital cases are counted. People who are asymptomatically infected are not being counted,' he said. 'The unfortunate WHO estimate is very high.'\n\nFlu researchers have sought to detect unreported and asymptomatic H5N1 cases by looking for H5N1 antibodies in the blood of people with potential past exposures to the virus. Palese said that in 10 studies with at least 500 subjects each, the infection rates ranged from 0.2% to 5.6%. If one assumes a 2% infection rate for people who are exposed to the virus but don't have recognized cases, 'the case-fatality with H5N1 really is much lower than what the WHO tries to say,' he asserted.\n\nOsterholm replied that in 13 studies that met the WHO criteria for H5N1 serology, only 26 of 5,533 subjects were positive for H5N1 antibodies, for a rate of 0.469%. 'But none of this is critical, because if this virus was 20 times less virulent than it is now, it would still be worse than [the] 1918 [pandemic flu virus],' he added. 'The data are clear and compelling. It'd still be the worst flu pandemic in history.'\n\nFerrets on trial\n-------------------\nParticipants also disagreed about the reliability of ferrets as models of flu effects in humans. Virologist Vincent Racaniello, PhD, a professor of microbiology and immunology at Columbia University's College of Physicians and Surgeons, said that when he began studying viral pathogenesis under Albert Sabin and other eminent experts, 'The first thing they said was when you study viruses in animals, don't think you'll learn much about what happens in humans.' Casadevall agreed that transmissibility in ferrets doesn't necessarily predict transmissibility in humans, but he said it was 'striking' that so many flu experts view ferrets as a suitable model for studying human flu.\n\nThe NSABB contacted many flu experts from around the world, and with few exceptions, they said the ferret model 'is a reasonable estimate of what might happen,' said Osterholm. Moreover, Fouchier himself, when he discussed his study at a European meeting last September, ended his talk saying, ''This is now a very dangerous virus,'' Osterholm added.\n\nLaurie Garrett, PhD, senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations, commented, 'The public health asset argument is that these experiments provide predictive value to help public health and identify genetic changes that should be monitored. If the ferret is useless, with no predictive value, then I do not understand why the experiment was ever done.' Palese responded, 'In fact the ferret is much too sensitive as an animal model, so I think an animal model is just that, an animal model, and not predictive.'\n\nIn other exchanges about how dangerous the mutant H5N1 viruses might be, Osterholm contrasted H5N1 with smallpox. 'I would not like to see smallpox get out of a BSL-4 [biosafety level 4, the highest level] lab, but it wouldn't be overly concerning' in view of the vaccine and other countermeasures available, he said. He noted that the WHO had a quick-response plan to contain an incipient flu pandemic, but the 2009 pandemic showed its futility. 'Once [flu] is out, it's gone, it's a worldwide issue,' he said. Palese responded, 'I'm shocked to hear that you wouldn't be concerned if smallpox got out. Two hundred million people died [of smallpox] in the 20th century, 500 for H5N1. H5N1 virus is so much less dangerous from what we know than smallpox.' Casadevall defended Osterholm's position, commenting, 'We have a smallpox vaccine, and there's a long period of incubation.' The last outbreak in Europe was stopped with a quick vaccination campaign, he added.\n\nSome of the discussion focused on the potential benefits of the H5N1 studies and full publication of the details. Garrett questioned the benefits, saying, 'One of the other great arguments in favor of public health benefits is that they tell us what we should watch for in nature. ... Nothing could be further from the truth. Most of the viral samples of H5 are fragmentary, and there's no routine capacity, especially in developing countries.'\n\nIn response to an assertion from Osterholm that both the risks and benefits of research must be carefully weighed, Racaniello said, 'For much of science you can't do a risk-benefit analysis. If you think you can, you're wrong.'\n\nQuestions about governmental role\n----------------------------------------------\nOn the question of the governmental role in regulating dual-use research, Garrett said basic notions about the purposes of government lead to a contradiction. One of the prime duties of government is to protect the public from perceived threats, she said. 'If you define the threat as a natural pandemic, you could argue that government should promote this kind of research, because it can lead to defenses,' she said. 'But if you define the threat as bioterrorism or biosecurity or lab leaks, then government has an absolute mandate to intervene to control that research.'\n\nIf the question is difficult at the national level, it's even more so at the international level, Garrettt said. 'If you go to the international level, we have only the International Health Regulations and the 2011 virus-sharing agreement' hammered out by the WHO, she said. 'We have absolutely no consensus as to what is the appropriate role of international governing bodies.'\n\nCasadevall voiced concern about the overregulation of science, especially clinical research. 'I have to write a 100-page animal [research] protocol to do something to help society, when you can walk into a Home Depot and find many ways to kill a mouse without any protocol,' he said. 'With this system in place, you're going to kill science.'\n\nOn the question of publication versus secrecy, Jasny estimated that about 1,000 people have already seen Fouchier's data, including 800 who attended the European meeting where he discussed it, plus government officials and editors. Osterholm and Casadevall said the NSABB hasn't suggested that the details can be kept secret for long, but they argued that withholding them nonetheless has short-term value. 'Everyone knows you can make a fertilizer bomb. But I don't think they want you to have the exact specifications on how to make a fertilizer bomb,' said Casadevall.\n\nWhen Lipkin raised the issue of lab security and containment levels, the debate turned heated once again. Osterholm said significant lab leaks of infectious agents don't happen often, but added, 'We can't un-ring a bell. One day maybe it'll be shown that this can't transmit to people, but if we're wrong and we find it does end up being transmitted ... it'll be just like 9/11. I don't understand why it's not going to be put into BSL-4 until we understand what we're doing.'\n\nPalese, who had said earlier that the type of research in question is already very restricted, reiterated his argument that all the existing evidence does not suggest the mutant H5N1 would spread among humans. 'There are many reasonable scientists who disagree with you,' Osterholm replied. Referring to the Sep 11 attacks, he added, 'Damn it, this is a real possibility, and if we are wrong, the consequences could be so catastrophic that we'll all go back and ask ourselves why did we let it happen.'\n\nGarrett warned that the debate over the research needs to include representatives of the general public, not just scientists. If an upcoming conference being planned by the WHO leads to some sort of agreement based only on discussion among scientists, she said, 'It's all going to backfire. It's going to explode in our face.' The WHO has scheduled the conference for Feb 16 and 17, but the agenda and participants are still being firmed up, spokesman Gregory Hartl told CIDRAP News today.\n\nThe value of a gutted paper\n-----------------------------------\nIn response to question from Lipkin, Veronique Kiermer, PhD, executive editor of Nature, said the two H5N1 studies are worth publishing even if the details must be left out. 'I think these 2 papers are very important and the overall message needs to be published,' she said. 'Also the scientists who have done this work deserve to have credit.' She added that it will be important for any mechanism for disseminating the details to be fair, so that anyone with a real need to know can get the data. But how to define who those people are remains to be worked out, she acknowledged.\n\nJasny commended the authors of the two H5N1 studies for being very responsible. 'They could've withdrawn the papers and published them elsewhere if they so chose. They're tried to work through the system, realizing the problems that are inherent in the situation. That's another reason to publish a redacted manuscript, because they've played fair.'\n\nRefer to:\nInformation on Feb 2 NYAS symposium on H5N1 dual use research\nhttp://www.nyas.org/Events/Detail.aspx?cid=f7d2e65c-9f8d-4418-b25e-bff21bb0a6cb\n\nList of panelists\nhttp://www.nyas.org/AboutUs/MediaRelations/Detail.aspx?cid=546b5ad2-9ead-4b45-bf26-03258eaa5294\n\nDec 23, 2011, CIDRAP News story 'Fears about mutant H5N1 hinge on ferrets as flu model'\nhttp://search.cidrap.umn.edu/cidrap/content/influenza/avianflu/news/dec2311ferrets-jw.html\n--\nCommunicated by ProMED\n<promed@promedmail.org>", "summary": "A ProMED-mail post\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n Casadevall agreed that transmissibility in ferrets doesn't necessarily predict transmissibility in humans, but he said it was 'striking' that so many flu experts view ferrets as a suitable model for studying human flu.\n\n Information on Feb 2 NYAS symposium on H5N1 dual use research\nhttp://www.nyas.org/Events/Detail.aspx?cid=f7d2e65c-9f8d-4418-b25e-bff21bb0a6cb\n\nList of panelists\n \n\nMichael T. Osterholm, PhD, MPH, an NSABB member, said the board set up a working group to consider the two manuscripts and brought in outside expert advisors, [which] spent 'hundreds and hundreds of hours' discussing the problem, leading to unanimous support for the recommendation to withhold the details of the studies. The debate, sponsored by the New York Academy of Sciences, involved 2 members of the biosecurity advisory board that called for 'redacting' the 2 studies in question to delete details, along with scientists who want the full studies published and representatives of Science and Nature, the two journals involved. Virologist Vincent Racaniello, PhD, a professor of microbiology and immunology at Columbia University's College of Physicians and Surgeons, said that when he began studying viral pathogenesis under Albert Sabin and other eminent experts, 'The first thing they said was when you study viruses in animals, don't think you'll learn much about what happens in humans.' \n\nPalese, who had said earlier that the type of research in question is already very restricted, reiterated his argument that all the existing evidence does not suggest the mutant H5N1 would spread among humans. ' \n\nArturo Casadevall, MD, PhD, the other NSABB member on the panel, said he initially thought the studies should be published in full, 'but as a result of the deliberative process, I changed my mind.' http://www.nyas.org/AboutUs/MediaRelations/Detail.aspx?cid=546b5ad2-9ead-4b45-bf26-03258eaa5294\n\nDec 23, 2011, CIDRAP News story 'Fears about mutant H5N1 hinge on ferrets as flu model'\n The NSABB contacted many flu experts from around the world, and with few exceptions, they said the ferret model 'is a reasonable estimate of what might happen,' said Osterholm. \n\nLaurie Garrett, PhD, senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations, commented, 'The public health asset argument is that these experiments provide predictive value to help public health and identify genetic changes that should be monitored. \n\nIf the question is difficult at the national level, it's even more so at the international level, Garrettt said. ' The controversy over research about potentially dangerous H5N1 viruses heated up last night in a New York City debate that featured some of the leading voices exchanging blunt comments on the alleged risks and benefits of publishing or withholding the full details of the studies. \n\nFlu researchers have sought to detect unreported and asymptomatic H5N1 cases by looking for H5N1 antibodies in the blood of people with potential past exposures to the virus. \n\nOn the question of publication versus secrecy, Jasny estimated that about 1,000 people have already seen Fouchier's data, including 800 who attended the European meeting where he discussed it, plus government officials and editors. AVIAN INFLUENZA (10): H5N1 RESEARCH CONTROVERSY\n***********************************************\n \n\nGarrett warned that the debate over the research needs to include representatives of the general public, not just scientists. On the question of the governmental role in regulating dual-use research, Garrett said basic notions about the purposes of government lead to a contradiction. \n\nSome of the discussion focused on the potential benefits of the H5N1 studies and full publication of the details. In response to question from Lipkin, Veronique Kiermer, PhD, executive editor of Nature, said the two H5N1 studies are worth publishing even if the details must be left out. ' If you define the threat as a natural pandemic, you could argue that government should promote this kind of research, because it can lead to defenses,' she said. ' \n\nFerrets on trial\n \n\nQuestions about governmental role\n I would not like to see smallpox get out of a BSL-4 [biosafety level 4, the highest level] lab, but it wouldn't be overly concerning' in view of the vaccine and other countermeasures available, he said. I have to write a 100-page animal [research] protocol to do something to help society, when you can walk into a Home Depot and find many ways to kill a mouse without any protocol,' he said. ' In response to an assertion from Osterholm that both the risks and benefits of research must be carefully weighed, Racaniello said, 'For much of science you can't do a risk-benefit analysis. If you go to the international level, we have only the International Health Regulations and the 2011 virus-sharing agreement' hammered out by the WHO, she said. \n\nRefer to:\n http://search.cidrap.umn.edu/cidrap/content/influenza/avianflu/news/dec2311ferrets-jw.html\n--\n Osterholm and Casadevall said the NSABB hasn't suggested that the details can be kept secret for long, but they argued that withholding them nonetheless has short-term value. ' \n\n\nLive debate airs major divisions in H5N1 research battle\n I think these 2 papers are very important and the overall message needs to be published,' she said. ' \n\nCasadevall voiced concern about the overregulation of science, especially clinical research. ' Palese said that in 10 studies with at least 500 subjects each, the infection rates ranged from 0.2% to 5.6%. \n\nIn other exchanges about how dangerous the mutant H5N1 viruses might be, Osterholm contrasted H5N1 with smallpox.

Those will be the questions on the table when the World Health Organisation (WHO) convenes a special meeting next week about controversial bird flu studies. The meeting will be small, with only 22 invitees from outside the WHO, senior communications staff of the Geneva-based global health agency said.\n\nPotentially among them will be representatives of the Vietnamese and Indonesian laboratories that provided the original viruses on which the research was done.\n\nPeople looking for solutions to broader issues such as whether and where similar research should be conducted in future may need to dial down their expectations for the meeting.\n\n'In this 1st meeting, we've got to sort out the deadlock, I think, that we're in with the scientific community. I don't think anyone anticipates that to happen very quickly,' says Christy Feig, the WHO's director of communications.\n\nThe session, to be held on 16 and 17 Feb 2012 at the WHO's headquarters, will focus on the most basic problems that have arisen as a result of the controversy. In essence: Should the 2 papers at the heart of the dispute be published? In full or in abbreviated form? If they must be abbreviated, which sections must be held back?\n\nThat disclosure suggests the tentative agreement on the part of the research teams and the journals involved to publish only redacted versions is not yet set in stone. In fact, the belief in Geneva is that the distance between the meeting participants is wide. As a result, expectations for how much can be achieved next week are the opposite. 'The focus is very narrow,' Feig said from Geneva. 'There's only so much ground you can cover in 2 days.'\n\nThe controversy relates to 2 studies, done by Dutch and American researchers, which reportedly show how H5N1 flu viruses could be made to spread like seasonal flu viruses among ferrets. Such viruses could not be tested in humans, and ferrets are considered the best -- though not foolproof -- animal model for predicting how flu viruses will act in people.\n\nA U.S. panel of biosecurity experts is urging that the studies not be published in full, arguing the details of how the work was done would be dangerous in the wrong hands. Invitations to the meeting are directed to individuals in some cases. In others, they have been issued to an institution that is playing a role in the controversy.\n\nRepresentatives of the Vietnamese and Indonesian labs that provided the source viruses have not yet indicated whether they'll attend, Feig said. Viet Nam provided viruses to Yoshihiro Kawaoka of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, while Ron Fouchier, of Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam, the Netherlands received his viruses from Indonesia. Their inclusion is a nod on the WHO's part to the Pandemic Influenza Preparedness (PIP) Framework, a multi-country agreement forged after years of painful negotiations. The framework, ratified last spring [2011], is meant to ensure that countries that share viruses with foreign scientists will in turn share in the benefits that flow from that research. The talks that led to the framework were triggered by a 2007 move by Indonesia to stop sharing H5N1 viruses with the broader world unless it was guaranteed access to pandemic vaccine and other benefits. While the transfer of viruses from Viet Nam and Indonesia to the American and Dutch labs occurred well before the PIP agreement was put in place, the WHO wants to observe the spirit of that agreement going forward, said spokesperson Gregory Hartl.\n\nThe director of the U.S. scientific agency that funded the research -- Dr. Anthony Fauci of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases -- will be there. So too will be a representative of the National Science Advisory Board on Biosecurity, the expert panel charged by the U.S. government with reviewing potential dual-use research, legitimate science that could be put to illegitimate use.\n\nOthers attending the meeting will be the researchers themselves, people who reviewed the research proposals to see whether they triggered dual-use concerns (both when the work was in the proposal stage and when the studies were being readied for publication) and representatives of the journals Science and Nature, which plan to publish the studies.\n\nAt least several of the directors of laboratories in the network of WHO collaborating labs for influenza have been invited and are expected to attend.\n\nA list of the participants and their declarations of interest will be posted on the WHO website the day the meeting begins. Hartl said the list can only be posted after the meeting participants formally go through and accept one another's declarations of interests.\n\nOne of the conditions the researchers and journals made before tentatively agreeing to redact the studies was that the full details of how the work was done would be shared with other scientists and public health officials on a need-to-know basis.\n\nThe system for doing that -- vetting applications to see the work, figuring out how to share the material -- has not yet been devised. And that work probably won't happen at this meeting, said Feig, adding that people with the expertise needed to set up that type of system won't be in the room.\n\nThe WHO has repeatedly said that it envisages helping to organize a 2nd meeting with broader goals and wider international involvement after this initial gathering is completed. Hartl said that is still the plan, but planning won't begin until this meeting occurs.\n\n[By: Helen Branswell]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nDan Lucey\nGeorgetown University\n<DRL23@georgetown.edu>\n\n[The WHO is concerned that the Pandemic Influenza Preparedness (PIP) Framework, a multi-country agreement ratified last spring 2011, has not been damaged by this research work. That apart, perhaps the most interesting information in this announcement are the facts that the avian A/(H5N1) influenza virus used by the Dutch group of Ron Fouchier at the Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam, the Netherlands was an isolate obtained from Indonesia, whereas the virus used by Yoshihiro Kawaoka at the University of Wisconsin-Madison had been isolated in Viet Nam.

Health officials are racing to track down the source of the\n[mutant ?] H5N1 amid growing fears. The 39-year-old Shenzhen driver\ndied on Saturday [31 Dec 2011] in the 1st reported case of bird flu in\na human in 18 months in China.\n\nHong Kong has declared a 'control zone' banning the import of live and\nfrozen chickens and poultry products from inside a 13-kilometer [8 mi]\nradius of the driver's home in the Shaijing area of Baoan district.\nThe ban will be effective until 21 Jan 2012 -- 2 days before Lunar New\nYear [celebration].\n\nThe Shenzhen Centre for Disease Control said initial genetic analysis\nshows the virus that killed the man is similar to that in the Yuen\nLong bird. However, the genes of the virus that killed him are not as\nclose to the virus found in dead poultry in Hong Kong, the centre\nadded. The virus found on the victim is H5N1 clade 2.3.2.1. The center\nsaid that although the mutated [?] virus is highly pathogenic, it\ncannot be spread from human to human so people do not need to panic.\n\nFurther analysis is under way to confirm whether [the bus driver]\ncaught the virus through wild birds. There is no evidence that\nsuggests this virus is more contagious or deadly,' said centre officer\nWu Chunli. 'Natural mutations happen in all flu viruses.'\n\nThe victim developed a fever on 21 Dec 2011 and was sent to hospital\non 25 Dec 2011 with severe pneumonia. On Saturday [31 Dec 2011] he was\nconfirmed to have H5N1. The center said earlier that Chen regularly\nvisited the wetland at Waterlands Resort for morning exercise.

Lo said: 'They cannot\nsay that the virus is similar to that found in wild birds and say the\nman may have contracted the virus from wild birds. There is no\nevidence in the whole world that suggests people contract H5N1 through\nwild birds. It is always through poultry. Does that mean the virus\nsimply fell from the sky?'\n\nLo said H5N1 clade 2.3.2.1. is found in many H5N1 cases and is not\nespecially deadly. He said further analysis is needed to compare this\nvirus with that found on a dead chicken in Cheung Sha Wan last month\n[December 2011]. But Lo stressed mutation does not mean it is more\ndeadly because flu viruses always mutate naturally. He called on\npeople to wash their hands after handling live chickens and to cook\nthem thoroughly before consumption.\n\nThe government said on 20 Dec 2011 that Hong Kong would have no live\nchicken supplies for 21 days after a dead chicken at the Cheung Sha\nWan poultry market was found to have H5N1.

Almost half of the 59 cases (about 45 percent) were\nchildren under 10 years old. The fatality rate did not appreciably\ndecline in 2011, about half of all the reported cases died. 4 small\nfamily clusters were noted during the year. The source of exposure for\nall of the cluster cases has been reported as exposure to sick and\ndying poultry. None of these clusters resulted in sustained\nhuman-to-human transmission. Based on an analysis of the 2011 data,\nthe potential for a virulent H5N1 pandemic has not diminished.'\n\nThe document begins: 'The big H5N1 news of 2011 was the bioethical\ndebate surrounding the publication of the details of genetic research\nby 2 groups of scientists who were able to create a laboratory strain\nof H5N1 that maintained its virulence and was easily transmissible\n[among ferrets] in aerosolized droplets. A few of the many media\nreports and commentaries are referenced in this FluTrackers report\n[http://www.flutrackers.com/forum/showthread.php?t=177126]. Equally\nas important, but without the accompanying media hype, is that there\nwas a 23 percent increase in the number of worldwide H5N1 human cases\nover the number of cases in 2010. In 2011, at least 59 cases were\nrecorded; in 2010 the total was only 48. The following summary of\nhuman cases from 2011 is generally organized according to the outlined\npresented last year in 'A Summary of Human H5N1 Cases in 2010'\n(http://www.flutrackers.com/forum/showthread.php?t=157504).\n\nPerhaps of greatest interest is the section on High H5N1 Infection\nRates Among Small Children. 'Since 2009, there has been an observable\ntrend of an increasing number of H5N1 infections among very young\nchildren. This should not be surprising since H5N1 is a novel\ninfluenza virus, and young children are more susceptible to influenza\nviruses in general. What is surprising is the recovery rate (that is,\nlow CFR) for this age group. As virulent as H5N1 is, many of the\ninfected children survive. The children survive at a much higher rate\nthan their infected adult counterparts. These children would not have\ntime to build up cross-protective immunity, so the recovery process\nfor these young people is worthy of further study. Also, most of these\nchild infections do not occur in family clusters so questions arise\nabout the exposure source for these children. What is the nature of\ncontact between exposed poultry and these young children? Is there a\nmild asymptomatic strain of H5N1 circulating in some countries?'

The city borders Hong Kong, which has already culled\nthousands of chickens and ordered a suspension of live poultry imports\nfrom the mainland after 3 birds tested positive for the H5N1 strain of\nthe virus in mid-December [2011].\n\nThe victim developed a fever on 21 Dec 2011 and was taken to hospital\non 25 Dec 2011 and diagnosed with severe pneumonia, said the health\ndepartment in Shenzhen, a city of more than 10 million. The\n39-year-old later tested positive for the H5N1 avian influenza virus,\nthe department said in a statement posted online late Friday [30 Dec\n2011]. He was in critical condition and receiving emergency treatment.\nAuthorities said the man had apparently had no direct contact with\npoultry in the month before he was taken ill, nor had he left the\ncity.\n\nThe H5N1 virus is fatal in humans in about 60 percent of cases. There\ntends to be a spike in infections during the early months of the year.\nSymptoms include fever, coughing, a sore throat, pneumonia and\nrespiratory disease. However, it does not pass easily from human to\nhuman, and the World Health Organization says it has never identified\na 'sustained human-to-human spread' of the virus since it re-emerged\nin 2003.\n\nChinese and Hong Kong authorities have been working closely together\nsince 21 Dec 2011 after live poultry supplies were suspended to the\nglitzy financial hub [i.e. Hong Kong] following the discovery of\ninfected birds. A spokesman for the Hong Kong health department said\nin a statement authorities would heighten their vigilance 'and\ncontinue to maintain stringent port health measures in connection with\nthis development.' Health authorities in China have also vowed to stay\nin 'close contact and work together' with Hong Kong and 'jointly step\nup measures in controlling the epidemic', the official Xinhua news\nagency said.\n\nChina is considered one of the nations most at risk of bird flu\nepidemics because it has the world's biggest poultry population and\nmany chickens in rural areas are kept close to humans. In the last\nreported human case in China, a young pregnant woman died of bird flu\nin June 2010 in the central province of Hubei. Her death brought to 26\nthe number of people who have died in China since 2003, out of 40\nreported human cases, according to the World Health Organization.\n\nAuthorities in Hong Kong have raised the bird flu alert level to\n'serious' since they discovered infected chickens, resulting in major\ndisruptions to poultry supplies over the busy Christmas period; 2\nschools were ordered to close after dead birds infected with the virus\nwere found on their premises.\n\nHong Kong was the site of the world's first major outbreak of bird flu\namong humans in 1997, when 6 people died. Millions of birds were then\nculled. The avian influenza virus has killed more than 330 people\naround the world, with Indonesia the worst-hit country. Most human\ninfections are the result of direct contact with infected birds.\n\nScientists fear H5N1 could mutate into a form readily transmissible\nbetween humans, with the potential to cause millions of deaths.\nHighlighting those fears, the World Health Organization said on Friday\n[30 Dec 2011] that it was 'deeply concerned' about research into\nwhether H5N1 could be made more transmissible between humans after\nmutant strains were produced in labs. Two separate research teams --\none in the Netherlands and the other in the USA -- separately found\nways to alter the virus H5N1 so it could pass easily between mammals.\n\nHong Kong is particularly nervous about infectious diseases after an\noutbreak of the respiratory disease SARS in 2003 killed 300 people in\nthe city and a further 500 worldwide.

Authorities in\nChina are especially worried about the spread of infectious diseases\naround this time when millions of Chinese travel in crowded buses and\ntrains across the country to go home to celebrate the Lunar New Year.\n\nThe current strain of H5N1 is highly pathogenic [in birds], kills most\nspecies of birds and up to 60 percent of the people it infects. Since\n2003, it has infected 573 people around the world, killing 336. The\nvirus also kills migratory birds but species that manage to survive\ncan carry and disperse the virus to new, uninfected locations.\n\nThe virus can kill birds and humans in a matter of days but can\nsurvive far longer durations in a moist, cool environment.

By in vitro\nselection for binding alpha 2-6 sialosides, we identified 4 variant\nviruses with amino acid substitutions in the hemagglutinin (S227N,\nD187G, E190G, and Q196R) that revealed modestly increased alpha 2-6\nand minimally decreased alpha 2-3 binding by glycan array analysis.\nHowever, a mutant virus combining Q196R with mutations from previous\npandemic viruses (Q226L and G228S) revealed predominantly alpha 2-6\nbinding. Unlike the wild type H5N1, this mutant virus was transmitted\nby direct contact in the ferret model although not by airborne\nrespiratory droplets. However, a reassortant virus with the mutant\nhemagglutinin, a human N2 neuraminidase and internal genes from an\nH5N1 virus was partially transmitted via respiratory droplets. The\ncomplex changes required for airborne transmissibility in ferrets\nsuggest that extensive evolution is needed for H5N1 transmissibility\nin humans.'\n\nThese experiments demonstrated that multiple genetic changes were\nrequired to produce experimentally a predominantly avian H5 influenza\nvirus that could be transmitted to ferrets (the mammal most\nsusceptible to influenza virus infection) by respiratory droplet\ninfection. These results are consistent with the rarity of H5N1 virus\ninfection in humans despite the extent of their exposure to avian H5N1\nvirus infection from diseased poultry. While these experiments do not\nexclude the rapid evolution of a novel H5N1 human pandemic virus, this\nis likely to be a rare event.

[Accepted for publication 30 Sep\n2011; Available online 12 Oct 2011]\n-------------------\nAbstract\n\nHighly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 (clade 2.2) was\nintroduced into Egypt in early 2006. Despite the control measures\ntaken, including mass vaccination of poultry, the virus rapidly spread\namong commercial and backyard flocks. Since the initial outbreaks, the\nvirus in Egypt has evolved into a 3rd order clade (clade 2.2.1) and\ndiverged into antigenically and genetically distinct subclades. To\nbetter understand the dynamics of HPAI H5N1 evolution in countries\nthat differ in vaccination policy, we undertook an in-depth analysis\nof those virus strains circulating in Egypt between 2006 and 2010 and\ncompared countries where vaccination was adopted (Egypt and Indonesia)\nto those where it was not (Nigeria, Turkey and Thailand). This study\nincorporated 751 sequences (Egypt n = 309, Indonesia n = 149, Nigeria\nn = 106, Turkey n = 87, Thailand n = 100) of the complete\nhaemagglutinin (HA) open reading frame, the major antigenic\ndeterminant of influenza A virus. Our analysis revealed that 2 main\nEgyptian subclades (termed A and B) have co-circulated in domestic\npoultry since late 2007 and exhibit different profiles of positively\nselected codons and rates of nucleotide substitution. The mean\nevolutionary rate of subclade A H5N1 viruses was 4.07 x 10 -3\nnucleotide substitutions per site, per year (HPD 95 percent,\n3.23-4.91), whereas subclade B possessed a markedly higher\nsubstitution rate (8.87 x 10 -3; 95 percent HPD 7.0-10.72 x 10 -3) and\na stronger signature of positive selection. Although the direct\nassociation between H5N1 vaccination and virus evolution is difficult\nto establish, we found evidence for a difference in the evolutionary\ndynamics of H5N1 viruses among countries where vaccination was or was\nnot adopted. In particular, both evolutionary rates and the number of\npositively selected sites were higher in virus populations circulating\nin countries applying avian influenza vaccination for H5N1, compared\nto viruses circulating in countries which had never used vaccination.\nWe, therefore, urge a greater consideration of the potential\nconsequences of inadequate vaccination on viral evolution.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 has become endemic in 6\ncountries: Bangladesh, India, the People's Republic of China, Egypt,\nIndonesia and Viet Nam, of which the 4 latter ones practice a\nvaccination policy. The analysis described in the above paper\naddressed 2 of these countries, Egypt and Indonesia, comparing them to\n3 countries where the disease is not endemic and vaccination is not\napplied (Nigeria, Turkey and Thailand).\n\nThe following concluding remarks from the discussion chapter are of\ninterest:\n\n'The direct association between H5N1 vaccination and virus evolution\nis clearly difficult to establish since other factors, difficult to\nevaluate under field conditions, might contribute to the apparent\ndifferences in evolutionary dynamics observed here. For example,\npoultry density, a variety of ecological factors or environmental\nchanges may contribute to the different rates of nucleotide\nsubstitution and strength of natural selection in those viruses\ncirculating in poultry. In addition, the endemicity of H5N1 viruses,\nthe number of distinct introductions of H5N1 (e.g. in Nigeria and\nTurkey), may also have influenced the pattern of viral evolution. When\nproperly planned and adopted, vaccination is a powerful tool for the\ncontrol and eradication of avian influenza in poultry, as demonstrated\nby past experiences in Italy, Viet Nam and Hong Kong, where it reduced\neconomic losses and the risks for zoonotic transmission. However, if\nnot properly applied and not coupled with careful surveillance, robust\nvaccine strategies and strict bio-security precautions, vaccination\nmay contribute to the rapid evolution and antigenic change of H5N1\nviruses, creating opportunities for the viruses to escape from vaccine\nprotection. Clearly, more sophisticated and effective animal health\ncontrol and prevention measures are urgently required, such as\nsustainable and efficacious vaccination strategies for poultry.'\n\nThe issue has been discussed earlier this year [2011] in FAO Animal\nProduction and Health paper No 171: 'Approaches to controlling,\npreventing and eliminating H5N1 HPAI in endemic countries,'\n(extensively cited in archived 20110424.1286).

In the People's Republic of\nChina, this problem has been addressed by introduction of new vaccine\nantigens. In countries such as Egypt and Indonesia, despite access to\nthe necessary technology, it has proven difficult to make the\nnecessary changes to vaccines quickly. Systems need to be in place to\ndetect antigenic variants rapidly through antigenic testing and\nexperimental challenge of vaccinated poultry with suspected antigenic\nvariants, and to make adjustments to vaccines.'\n\nAs recently published by the OIE ( 20110901.2678), a vaccine against\nthe novel H5N1 clade 2.3.2.1 virus, reportedly identified in Viet Nam\nand China, is already in the testing phase in China.\n\nDoes a non-vaccination approach in an endemic situation deserve\nconsideration?

The statement also cited recent\nincreases in H5N1 bird outbreaks and warned about a possible major\nresurgence of the virus.\n\nWHO said today that its Global Influenza Surveillance and Response\nSystem recognized the H5N1 variant in February [2011]. 'Based on\navailable information, this evolution of the H5N1 virus poses no\nincreased risk to public health,' the WHO statement said. 'It is not\nconsidered unusual because influenza viruses are constantly evolving,\nespecially in areas where they circulate regularly in poultry.'\n\nThe agency further said clade 2.3.2.1 does not change the public\nhealth implications of H5N1 viruses, given the available information.\n'Human cases of H5N1 infection remain rare and sporadic events,\noccurring mostly in areas where H5N1 viruses circulate regularly in\npoultry,' the statement said.\n\nThe OIE made similar points in a statement today [31 Aug 2011; see\nProMED-mail Avian influenza (56): mutation, vaccine efficacy, OIE\n20110901.2678]. It said the emergence of clade 2.3.2.1 is a result of\nminor genetic changes that typify the natural evolution of the virus.\n'This is not immediate cause for alert but, as with the emergence of\nany new strain, reinforces the need for sustained monitoring of\nviruses in animal populations so that changes in viruses circulating\nin the field are detected at an earliest stage and that most\nappropriate disease control strategies are chosen to best protect\nanimal and public health', the OIE said.\n\nThe agency also commented that avian flu vaccines, like human flu\nvaccines, need to be tested regularly to see if they are effective\nagainst the viruses in circulation. The OIE reference laboratory in\nHarbin, China, has developed a vaccine that, in trials, has protected\npoultry from clade 2.3.2.1, the statement said. Once available for\nfield use, the vaccine will be employed in countries where the new\nvariant has been identified.\n\n'Registration and manufacturing of a poultry vaccine with the new seed\nstrain is in progress,' the OIE said.\n\nMeanwhile, a clade 2.3.2.1 virus caused the illness of a 59 year old\nHong Kong woman who contracted an H5N1 infection last November (2010)\n[see ProMED-mail Avian influenza, human (60): China (Hong Kong)\n20101122.4228], probably while traveling in Mainland China, according\nto a report today [31 Aug 2011] by The Standard, a Hong Kong\nnewspaper. The story cited Hong Kong's Centre for Health Protection\n(CHP) as the source of the information.

Local quarantine officials carried\nout routine tests and discovered the birds had the H5N1 strain of the\ninfluenza virus, the ministry said.\n\nBird flu is an air-borne disease that is usually transmitted between\nanimals. The disease can spread to humans, but no human cases have\nbeen reported in the country so far.\n\nThe country's quarantine authorities, meanwhile, have stepped up an\nexisting bird flu prevention campaign after a wild duck on the\nMangyeong River tested positive for the influenza virus earlier in\nthe week [archived 20101208.4377].\n\nThe country was hit a total of 3 times by avian influenza, with the\nlatest outbreak occurring in April of 2008 and resulting in a record\n8.46 million birds being culled at a cost of around 264 billion won\n[USD 215.7 million]. Previous outbreaks took place in the winter\nmonths of 2003-2004 and 2006-2007.\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall\n\n[The above newswire reports that the 2 eagle owls were 'infected with\nthe virulent strain of bird flu' and that 'routine tests discovered\nthe birds had the H5N1 strain.'

The immediate notification, with map, is\navailable at\n<http://www.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=single_report&pop=1&reportid=10029>.\nIt includes the following epidemiological comment:\n\n'As part of a continuous avian influenza surveillance programme, 39\nwild birds were captured, and samples (faeces, laryngo-pharyngeal\nswab) were collected. The NVRQS found avian influenza antigen (H5) by\nPCR and confirmed it as highly pathogenic avian influenza (H5N1)\nvirus by gene sequencing from one mallard duck on 7 Dec 2010.\nClinical surveillance and disinfection on the neighbouring poultry\nfarms were enhanced.'\n\nThe current case, in Seosan, in the province Chungcheongnam-do (South\nChungcheong or Chungnam), is situated at a distance of at least 120\nkm from the mallard duck case, mentioned above.

The group of H5N1\navian flu viruses, once known as 'Fujian-like,' has morphed into\n'Clade 2.3.4,' and its 'Qinghai-like' cousin is now called 'Clade\n2.2.' They are part of a complete revision of H5N1 nomenclature\nrecommended by the World Health Organization (WHO).\n\nThe system is now more politically correct. It avoids the\n'stigmatizing labelling of clades by geographical reference,'\naccording to the WHO. In 2006, when scientists assigned the name\n'Fujian-like virus' to a vaccine-resistant strain of H5N1 that spread\nacross Asia, China objected strongly to the name. Government\nofficials argued that the southeastern Chinese province of Fujian was\ntainted by association as the virus spread.\n\nBut a WHO official told Nature [journal] that discussions for a\nrevised nomenclature were underway before the spat and that the\n'impetus was scientific. We recognized that naming based on geography\nwas probably not a good idea for other reasons,' she says.\n\nFlu experts say that the new naming recommendations, which have been\nposted on the WHO website [see reference below] and have been\nsubmitted for publication in the journal Emerging Infectious\nDiseases, make a lot of sense. They replace an ad-hoc system -- in\nwhich researchers would invent their own names for newly isolated\ngroups -- with a systematic one in which names have greater\nbiological relevance.\n\nH5N1 viruses are classified on the basis of their hemagglutinin\ngenetic sequence into 10 phylogenetic clades -- distinct branches of\nthe virus's family tree -- and the new system names the viral\nsubgroups according to their position in the tree. It aims to be more\nlogical. For example, Clade 2.3.4 viruses are not restricted to\nFuijan province, as they have caused cases in humans in China, Laos,\nMyanmar and Viet Nam. Clade 2.1 viruses dominate in poultry and\nhumans in Indonesia, for example, whereas Clade 2.2 viruses have the\nlargest geographical spread, causing outbreaks in more than 60\ncountries from Azerbaijan to Nigeria and Pakistan.\n\n'I find the geographical naming system rather confusing and\nunspecific; this more precise numbering system is far more rigorous,'\nsays Edward Holmes, a flu genomicist at Pennsylvania State University\nin University Park. The new system does not affect the naming of\nindividual H5N1 virus sequences -- held in the GenBank database --\nthat make up such clades. These will continue to display geographic\nand species data on the sample. Geographic information is relevant,\nsays the WHO official, because it locates the sample's place of\norigin.\n\nBut experts say that the location data in GenBank flu names is\nwoefully inadequate for serious spatial science, such as analyzing\nthe spread of virus genotypes or how spread relates to other spatial\ndata on land use, climate and trade. 'There's nothing more\nfrustrating and useless to a phylogeographer than a perfectly\nsequenced isolate labeled 'China,'' says Rob Wallace, an evolutionary\necologist at the University of California, Irvine. 'With Global\nPositioning System (GPS) coordinates and fine enough sampling, we\nwould really be able to tease out how the virus evolves and spreads\nacross farms and wetlands.'\n\nIndeed, not one H5N1 sequence in GenBank currently contains GPS\ncoordinates, often because those submitting sequences have no use for\nsuch data. 'Given the importance of avian flu, I've been amazed to\nfind out how difficult it has been to get information on the\ngeographical distribution of essential variables,' says ecologist\nMarius Gilbert of the Free University of Brussels. The WHO official\nagrees that the current sequence-naming system is not as useful as\nGPS coordinates, but says that 'the WHO doesn't see its business as\nmaking that sort of requirement.'\n\nGenBank only introduced fields for latitude and longitude in\nsubmitted entries in 2005, and few scientists have so far used them,\nexcept in spatially aware fields, such as forest entomology and\nbiodiversity.\n\n[Byline: Declan Butler]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[An up-to-date (February 2008) phylogenetic tree with the current\nclade nomenclature is presented as Figure 1 of the WHO document\nentitled: 'Antigenic and genetic characteristics of H5N1 viruses and\ncandidate H5N1 vaccine viruses developed for potential use as human\nvaccines,' which is available at:\n<http://www.who.int/csr/disease/avian_influenza/guidelines/H5VaccineVirusUpdate20080214.pdf>.\n- Mod.CP]\n....................................cp/msp/jw\n*##########################################################*\n************************************************************\nProMED-mail makes every effort to verify the reports that\nare posted, but the accuracy and completeness of the\ninformation, and of any statements or opinions based\nthereon, are not guaranteed.

Acting chief\nveterinary officer Fred Landeg made the announcement at a press\nconference in London.\n\nAll birds at the affected premises -- including approximately 5000\nturkeys, 1000 ducks, and 500 geese -- will be slaughtered.\n\nPolice officers are at the entrance to the farm, and vehicles are\nbeing sprayed with a jet hose.\n\nThe Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said\nsome 10 percent of birds in one shed at the farm had died during one\nnight.\n\nMr Landeg said there was 'still some uncertainty' over the situation.\n'We are at a very early stage of the investigation,' he added. 'The\ninitial sequence data suggests that it's closely related to outbreaks\nin the Czech Republic and Germany, which does suggest a possible wild\nbird source. However, at this stage we are looking with an open mind\nas to the origin and all potential sources of the origin will be\ninvestigated.'\n\nMr Landeg also said there was a lake at the affected site with a\nnumber of wild fowl on it.\n\n'We are still at a very early stage of the investigation and no 2\noutbreaks of the disease are ever the same.\n\n'This will not be a quick exercise.

The ministry determined\nthe degree of virulence through a laboratory examination of virus samples\ntaken from chickens that died of bird flu on the Miyazaki farm.\nThe National Institute of Animal Health, which identified the virus as the\nhighly pathogenic H5N1 strain on Tuesday [16 Jan 2007], drew the conclusion\nafter 8 chickens inoculated with the sampled virus were dead by Thursday\n[18 Jan 2007], the ministry said. Based in Tsukuba, Ibaraki Prefecture, the\ninstitute will continue genetic analysis for the consideration of the\nministry's panel of experts.\nThe H5N1 strain, a subtype of the influenza A virus circulating basically\nin birds, has spread mainly in Asia and has killed more than 160 people in\n10 countries since 2003, according to the World Health Organization. Its\nlatest outbreak in poultry in Japan -- the 5th bird-flu case here since\n2004 -- occurred at Taniguchi Furanjo Kurosaka Farm in Kiyotake, Miyazaki\nPrefecture, causing the death of 3500 birds in one of the farm's 3 poultry\nhouses, mostly last week.\nIn the town of Kiyotake, inspectors from the Miyazaki Prefectural\nGovernment's task force Thursday [18 Jan 2007] checked bird-keeping\nhouseholds and homes within a 10 km radius of the farm, after they finished\nexamining the 11 poultry farms with more than 1000 chickens in the area\nWednesday [17 Jan 2007].\nTen households with at least 20 birds, including chickens and bantams\n[small breeds of chickens], were selected for Thursday's [18 Jan 2007]\non-site inspections to take blood and fluid samples from 5 birds per\nhousehold, task force officials said, adding that results will be released\nwithin a few days.\nMore than 150 households are breeding a total of around 1600 avian species\nin the town, including parakeets and other small birds kept as pets, town\nofficials said.\n******\n[2] Viet Nam, Can Tho\nDate: Fri 19 Jan 2007\nFrom: Mary Marshall <tropical.forestry@btinternet.com>\nSource: Reuters Alertnet [edited]\n<http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/HAN277071.htm>\n\nBird flu found in ducks in Viet Nam city of Can Tho\n---------------------------------------------------\nBird flu has killed ducks in the southern Mekong delta's largest city of\nCan Tho, as Viet Nam's animal health experts increase measures to contain\nthe H5N1 virus, a government report said on Friday [19 Jan 2007]. The\nAnimal Health Department said that tests showed H5N1 had killed ducklings\nin Can Tho 4 days after the virus was found in neighboring Soc Trang\nprovince. The report said the domesticated ducks had not been vaccinated\nagainst the virus.\nThe Agriculture Ministry has ordered a new round of poultry vaccinations\nand sent more animal health experts to try to stem the bird flu, which has\nstruck 7 provinces and Can Tho city in the southern rice basket region in\nthe past month as a harvest nears.\nThis week, the government ordered farmers to stop ducks from roaming in the\nMekong delta. Animal health officials said H5N1 has killed nearly 19 000\npoultry in the delta, mostly ducks. Not all ducks are killed by the virus,\nsome being infected without showing symptoms. The birds still excrete the\nvirus in their droppings as they paddle through muddy rice paddies looking\nfor insects and leftover grain.\nViet Nam has had no human H5N1 cases since November 2005, but the virus\nthat 1st hit the south east Asian country in late 2003 returned to the\nMekong delta last month [December 2006]. Thursday's [18 Jan 2007] Lao Dong\n(Labour) newspaper said 23 people who ate ducks that died from unknown\ncauses in Bac Lieu province have been put under surveillance.\nThe government is anxious to stop bird flu spreading ahead of the Tet Lunar\nNew Year festival in mid-February [2007], when poultry is part of the\ntraditional feast. Officials fear the disease could spread nationwide on\nthe wings of migrating birds and through the movement of poultry, including\nthe smuggling of chickens and ducks from neighboring countries.\nBird flu killed 42 of the 93 people infected in Viet Nam in 2003-2005.

Some residents responded with cheers of\n'Hurray!' at the launch of the campaign, although the culled birds were not\nknown to have been infected by bird flu.\nSutiyoso told city residents on Wednesday [17 Jan 2007] that their backyard\nfowl would be confiscated and destroyed if they failed to get rid of the\nbirds by the end of the month. The move followed the deaths of 4 people in\nJakarta and its surrounding areas since the start of the year [2007], which\ntook the number of confirmed human deaths from the virus in Indonesia to\n61, the highest in the world. 'We support the government's program. It's\nbetter to do this than worrying about being infected,' a resident said. But\nsome residents were worried about the cost. Many people in Indonesia keep\npoultry to supplement their meager incomes. 'The program is good but how\ncan we eat eggs but not chicken?' she asked.\nA trader at a nearby bird market said he had not sold a single bird since\nthe governor announced the ban. He said that, even though traders like him\ncould still sell birds, traders and owners would need to get a clean bill\nof health for birds from authorities. This could discourage buyers. 'I hope\nofficials can be present here to facilitate the certification,' he said.\nHealth minister Siti Fadilah Supari on Thursday [18 Jan 2007] said the ban\nin Jakarta would be extended to 8 other provinces that had reported human\ninfections of the H5N1 bird flu virus. More than a dozen people have been\nadmitted to hospital with bird flu-like symptoms since the start of the\nyear [2007], although many have been discharged or tested negative for the\nvirus.\nIndonesia faces an uphill task controlling the disease.

The H5N1 strain, a subtype of the influenza A virus circulating basically\nin birds, has spread mainly in Asia and has killed more than 160 people in\n10 countries since 2003, according to the World Health Organization. The government is anxious to stop bird flu spreading ahead of the Tet Lunar\nNew Year festival in mid-February [2007], when poultry is part of the\ntraditional feast. He said that, even though traders like him\ncould still sell birds, traders and owners would need to get a clean bill\nof health for birds from authorities. The ministry determined\nthe degree of virulence through a laboratory examination of virus samples\ntaken from chickens that died of bird flu on the Miyazaki farm. More than 150 households are breeding a total of around 1600 avian species\nin the town, including parakeets and other small birds kept as pets, town\nofficials said. Officials fear the disease could spread nationwide on\nthe wings of migrating birds and through the movement of poultry, including\nthe smuggling of chickens and ducks from neighboring countries. Sutiyoso told city residents on Wednesday [17 Jan 2007] that their backyard\nfowl would be confiscated and destroyed if they failed to get rid of the\nbirds by the end of the month.

The paper by Rimmelzwaan et al.,\n'Influenza A virus (H5N1) infection in cats causes systemic disease\nwith potential novel routes of virus spread within and between\nhosts,' appears in the January issue of The American Journal of\nPathology and is accompanied by a commentary.\nAvian influenza (H5N1) is of great concern because of the current\noutbreaks in Asia and the potential for pandemic spread. This virus\nis highly contagious in birds and spreads easily due to the\nagricultural and migratory nature of the bird species infected,\nincluding poultry, waterfowl, and other migratory species (See\ncommentary by Brown for more information). While spread of avian\ninfluenza from bird to man is known to occur, as first reported\nduring the 1997 Hong Kong outbreak, human-to-human spread is\nextremely rare. Thus, the disease events that take place during\nmammal-to-mammal spread are not well characterized.\nTo assess the spread of H5N1 influenza virus in mammalian hosts,\nRimmelzwaan et al. examined cats infected via the respiratory tract,\nvia the digestive tract (by feeding on infected chicks), or by close\ncontact with respiratory-infected cats. The researchers, led by Dr.\nThijs Kuiken, then examined mucous membranes (throat, nasal, and\nrectal swabs) and organ systems (respiratory, digestive, nervous,\ncardiovascular, urinary, lymphoid, and endocrine) for the presence of\nvirus and viral protein.\nAs expected, all cats were infected with H5N1 virus and exhibited\nclinical signs of disease (fever, lethargy, labored breathing, etc.),\nand virus was detected in throat, nasal, and rectal swabs, regardless\nof the original site of infection. Most interesting, virus spread\nthroughout the organ systems with virus being found in respiratory\nand digestive tracts, liver, kidney, heart, brain, and lymph nodes.\nFurthermore, examination of infected tissues revealed cellular damage\nat sites containing viral proteins, providing an explanation for the\nincreased severity of disease in humans.\nThese data underscore the potential for influenza virus to spread not\nonly from the respiratory tract but also from the digestive and\nurinary tracts, greatly increasing the possible routes of mammalian\ntransmission. Systemic disease has long been known to occur in birds,\nwith the fecal-oral route of transmission being most important.\nHowever, this is the 1st demonstration of systemic replication in\ncats, providing a cautionary tale for humans regarding how influenza\nis spread and how the disease presents itself.\nRimmelzwaan and colleagues caution that because of the systemic\nnature of avian influenza, 'H5N1 virus infection needs to be included\nin the differential diagnosis of a broader range of clinical\npresentations than is currently done.' In addition better\nunderstanding of the mechanisms of spread, including possible\nfecal-oral route in humans, 'may limit the risk of H5N1 virus\ndeveloping into a pandemic influenza virus.'\n(This work was performed at the Department of Virology, Erasmus\nMedical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands, and was supported by a\nNovaflu EU grant.

The confirmation\ncame shortly after poultry farmers and an outgoing senator accused\nthe ministry of covering up the re-emergence of the deadly disease\nafter massive deaths of poultry in many provinces from early this\nmonth [see prior ProMED-mail postings on Undiagnosed deaths, poultry\n- Thailand listed below - Mod.MPP].\nThe ministry had repeatedly denied bird flu had recurred but\neventually verified the outbreak yesterday.\nThe Livestock Development Department's lab detected the avian flu\nvirus in a fighting cock carcass from Bang Mun Nak district. This was\nwhere almost 300 fowls had been culled after the mysterious deaths of\naround 30 fighting cocks and free-range chickens 2 weeks ago,\ncaretaker Agriculture Minister Sudarat Keyuraphan told a press conference.\nKhunying Sudarat, however, tried to ease public concerns over the\ndetection of the bird flu virus.\n''Finding the virus in an area that used to be plagued with the\ndisease like Bang Mun Nak district is considered to be a common\nthing. It would be more frightening if the virus was found in a bird\nflu-free zone,'' she said.\nNirundorn Aungtragoolsuk, director of the Livestock Development\nDepartment's Disease Control Bureau insisted that test results had\nconfirmed the bird flu outbreak late yesterday morning and the\nministry had informed the public right away.\nDr Nirundorn said the virus was unlikely to spread since all fowls in\nthe infected area had been culled from Saturday [22 Jul 2006].\nThe department had now employed extreme measures to contain the\noutbreak, including imposing a total ban on fowl movements in the\nprovince and sealing borders to prevent smuggling of poultry from\nneighbouring countries.\nThe department had reported the re-emergence of the disease to the\nWorld Organisation for Animal Health and major importers of Thai\ncooked chicken.\nThe area within a 10-km radius of the infected farm had been put\nunder a 21-day surveillance.\nThe Public Health Ministry, meanwhile, reported yesterday that an\n11-year-old boy from Phichit had been listed as the country's latest\nsuspected bird flu case.\nA blood sample from the boy had been sent for testing.

Now we have 2,' said Rebecca\nGarten of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), who\nhelped conduct the study. One of the 2 strains, or clades, made people sick\nin Vietnam, Cambodia and Thailand in 2003 and 2004 and the 2nd, a cousin of\nthe 1st, caused the disease in people in Indonesia in 2005.\n2 clades may share the same ancestor but are genetically distinct -- as are\ndifferent clades, or strains, of the AIDS virus, the team from the CDC\nfound. 'This does complicate vaccine development. But we are moving very\nswiftly to develop vaccines against this new group of viruses,' said Dr.\nNancy Cox, chief of the CDC's influenza branch.\nThe H5N1 strain of bird flu has spread across Europe, Africa and parts of\nAsia and killed nearly 100 people worldwide and infected about 180 since it\nreemerged in 2003. Although it is difficult to catch bird flu, people can\nbecome infected if they come into close contact with infected birds.\nScientists fear the virus could mutate into a form that could pass easily\nbetween humans, triggering a pandemic in which millions could die.\nAll influenza viruses mutate easily, and H5N1 appears to be no exception.\nBut Cox said the evolution of a 2nd clade does not move the virus closer to\nhuman-to-human transmission. 'Like the group one or clade one viruses, the\ngroup 2 or clade 2 viruses are not easily transmitted from person to\nperson,' she said. 'It really doesn't take us closer to a pandemic. It\nsimply makes preparing for the pandemic a bit more difficult.'\nThe U.S. Health and Human Services Department has already recognized the 2\nstrains and approved the development of a 2nd H5N1 vaccine based on the 2nd\nclade. Several companies are working on H5N1 vaccines experimentally,\nalthough current formulations are not expected to protect very well, if at\nall, against any pandemic strain. A vaccine against a pandemic flu strain\nwould have to be formulated using the actual virus passing from person to\nperson.\nResearchers said while vaccines were needed against different strains of\nthe virus, a vaccination against one clade could provide partial protection\nagainst another. 'We would expect the priming (of a patient) with a clade\none (vaccine) could potentially reduce the severity of disease,' Cox said.\nFor their study, Garten and colleagues analyzed more than 300 H5N1 virus\nsamples taken from both infected birds and people from 2003 through the\nsummer of 2005.

The virus was isolated from a\ncloacal swab collected from a wild duck hunted in an area located in\nthe municipality of Mirandola, province of Modena, in Emilia-Romagna\nRegion.[Lat: 4:53:16N (44.8878), Lon: 11:04:03E (11.0674), about 45\nkm north of the city Modena].\nOn 9 Nov 2005, the isolate was typed as a Low Pathogenic H5N1 by\nhaemagglutination inhibition test, neuraminidase inhibition test, and\ngenetic analysis.\nThe amino acids sequence deduced from the cleavage site of the\nhaemagglutinin molecule (PQRETRG) is typical of low pathogenicity\navian influenza viruses (LPAI). Therefore it is a completely\ndifferent pathotype than the Asiatic highly pathogenic (HPAI) H5N1\nviruses.\nThe Italian H5N1 represents a different virus, not related\ngenetically to the aggressive Asiatic H5N1. This has been\ndemonstrated by the analysis of the HA gene. The preliminary results\nindicate that the Italian virus is genetically related to other LPAI\nviruses commonly isolated in wild birds in Europe. The HA gene of the\nisolate correlated with the following LPAI strains sequences\ndeposited in international databases: A/mallard/NL/3/99(H5N2);\nA/mallard/Sweden/7/02(H5N2); A/mallard/DK/64650/03(H5N7).\nMore than 1000 samples collected from wild waterfowl in Italy have\npreviously been tested with negative results for H5N1 HPAI.\n--\nDr. Romano Marabelli\nGeneral director\nDirectorate General for Veterinary Health and Food\nMinistry of Health, Rome - Italy\n\n[This expedient and detailed report on the topics included in our\nrequest for information is gratefully acknowledged.\nTraditionally, the pathogenicity of avian influenza isolates is\ndefined in terms of intravenous pathogenicity index (IVPI) based upon\nin vivo trials in susceptible chickens 4-8 weeks old. However, this\nsystem has been undergoing modifications in the light of contemporary\ngenetic knowledge. See the following explanatory comment from 2005's\nedition of OIE's terrestrial manual of Diagnostic tests and Vaccines:\n'Now that the presence of multiple basic amino acids at the HA0\ncleavage site is well-established as an accurate indicator of\nvirulence or potential virulence for H5 and H7 influenza viruses, it\nappears inevitable that determination of the cleavage site by\nsequencing or other methods will become the method of choice for\ninitial assessment of the virulence of these viruses and incorporated\ninto agreed definitions.

There appear to be unconfirmed indications of a 2nd\nfoci in each of these countries. Moreover, there is some information in\nthis OIE report that indicates that the 2nd outbreak in Turkey is close to\nthe border with Iran. Thus, the possibility is raised that the wild bird\ndie off in Iran will turn out to be due to H5N1 avian influenza because of\nthe close geographic location and proximity in timing. Finally, there\nappear to be reports of avian influenza in Greece.\nThis flurry of reports should be treated with caution because of the\npossibilities of over reaction and speculation that accompany any\nunconfirmed report.

Mid-2003: H5N1 virus begins to cause outbreaks in Asia, but these go\nundetected and unreported.\n4. Dec 2003: 2 tigers and 2 leopards, fed on fresh chicken carcasses, die\nunexpectedly at a zoo in Thailand. Subsequent investigation identifies H5N1\nin tissue samples. This is the 1st report of influenza causing disease and\ndeath in big cats.\n5. 19 Dec 2003: Republic of Korea confirms highly pathogenic H5N1 as cause\nof poultry deaths at 3 farms.\n6. 8 Jan 2004: Viet Nam reports H5N1 in poultry.\n7. 12 Jan 2004: Japan reports H5N1 in poultry.\n8. 23 Jan 2004: Thailand reports H5N1 in poultry.\n9. 24 Jan 2004: Cambodia reports H5N1 in poultry.\n10. 27 Jan 2004: Lao PDR reports H5N1 in poultry.\n11. 2 Feb 2004: Indonesia reports H5N1 in poultry.\n12. 4 Feb 2004: China reports H5N1 in poultry.\n13. 20 Feb 2004: Anecdotal evidences suggests H5N1 infection in a single\nhousehold of domestic cats in Thailand.\n14. 18 Mar 2004: Research (1) case studies of 10 patients in Viet Nam point\nto close contact with infected poultry as the probable source of infection\nin most cases, but conclude that, in 2 family clusters, limited\nhuman-to-human transmission within the family cannot be ruled out.\n15. Jun./Jul 2004: China, Indonesia, Thailand and Viet Nam report\nrecurrence of H5N1 in poultry.\n16. 8 Jul 2004: Research (2) identifies the dominant Z genotype in poultry,\nconsiders possible role of wild birds in spread, and concludes that H5N1\nhas found a new ecological niche in poultry, but is not yet fully adapted\nto this host.\n17. 13 Jul 2004: Research (3) shows that H5N1 has become progressively more\nlethal for mammals and can kill wild waterfowl, long considered a\ndisease-free natural reservoir. Japan announces control of the H5N1 poultry\noutbreak and is considered disease-free by OIE.\n18. Jul 2004: Research (4).A case report is published indicating atypical\nhuman H5N1 infection in Thailand (from Mar 04), with fever and diarrhoea\nbut no respiratory symptoms. The report suggests that the clinical spectrum\nof disease may be broader than previously thought.\n19. 7 Aug 2004: Malaysia reports H5N1 in poultry.\n20. 20 Aug 2004: Research (5). Chinese researchers report preliminary\nfindings of H5N1 infection in pigs. No evidence suggests that pig\ninfections are widespread, and the finding appears to have limited\nepidemiological significance.\n21. 2 Sep 2004: Research (6) shows that domestic cats experimentally\ninfected with H5N1 develop severe disease and can spread infection to other\ncats. Prior to this research, domestic cats were considered resistant to\ndisease from all influenza A viruses.\n22. 21 Sep 2004: Republic of Korea announces control of the H5N1 poultry\noutbreak and is considered disease-free by OIE.\n23. 11 Oct 2004: Outbreak begins in zoo tigers in Thailand said to have\nbeen fed chicken carcasses.

The\nendangered Owston's palm civets were raised in captivity; source of\ninfection is unknown.\n35. 23 Jul 2005: Russia reports outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian\ninfluenza, subsequently confirmed as H5N1, in poultry in western Siberia.\nThe outbreak spreads to affect 6 administrative regions in Siberia. Dead\nmigratory birds are reported in the vicinity of outbreaks.\n36. 2 Aug 2005: Kazakhstan reports an outbreak of highly pathogenic avian\ninfluenza, subsequently confirmed as H5N1, in poultry in areas adjacent to\nSiberia. Dead migratory birds are reported in the vicinity of outbreaks.\n37. 10 Aug 2005: China reports outbreak in Tibet Autonomous Region.\n38. 12 Aug 2005: Mongolia reports the death of 89 migratory birds at 2\nlakes. H5N1 is subsequently identified in these birds.\n39. 29 Sep 2005: Research (12) describes the clinical features of H5N1\ninfection in humans and reviews recommendations for the management of cases.\n40. October 2005: Research (13) on the evolution of human and animal\nviruses circulating in Asia in 2005 suggests that several amino acids\nlocated near the receptor-binding site are undergoing change, some of which\nmay affect antigenicity or transmissibility.\n41. 6 Oct 2005: Research (14, 15) describes reconstruction of the lethal\n1918 pandemic virus, concludes that this virus was entirely avian, and\nfinds some similarities with H5N1.\n42. 13 Oct 2005: Highly pathogenic H5N1 is confirmed in poultry in Turkey.\n43. 15 Oct 2005: Highly pathogenic H5N1 is confirmed in poultry in Romania.\n44. 20 Oct 05: Taiwan, China, reports the detection of highly pathogenic\nH5N1 in a cargo of exotic songbirds smuggled from mainland China.

But wild water-birds such as ducks and geese can harbor\nthe virus for long periods, most of the time showing no symptoms or\nbecoming ill.\nWhilst any bird can in theory become infected, wildfowl are the\nprimary carriers, and many species fly south from Siberia seeking\nwarmer climes at the onset of winter, scientists say.\n'The existence of known migration flyways of several birds species\nconnecting South East Asia, Siberia and Europe shows a possibility of\nthe introduction of the H5N1 virus to both eastern and western\nEurope,' the OIE said this week in a report on the outbreak in Russia.\nIt said surveillance should be increased in the Caspian Sea region,\nwhich was recognized as 'a significant wintering area for water birds\nof various origins (Europe and western Asia) and can be considered as\na so-called biological 'hub'.'\nWhat scares experts most is that the virus could mutate and pass\neasily between humans, possibly sparking a pandemic to rival the\nkiller global flu outbreaks of the last century.\nThe spread of bird flu in parts of Asia and earlier this year [2005]\nfrom Russia to Kazakhstan has also been linked to cross-border trade\nin live poultry, either legal or illegal.\nThiermann said the widespread practice of cock-fighting in Asia,\nwhere it was big business, may have played a role there.\nBut trade was an unlikely source of the latest cases.\n'The role of migratory birds carrying the Asian H5N1 influenza virus\nunder certain conditions to other parts of the world seems now more\nlikely,' the OIE said after the latest test results from Romania and Turkey.\nThe OIE and U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) have\npinpointed the Caspian and Black Sea regions, as well as the Balkans,\nas a 'gateway to central Europe for the virus.'\nBird migration routes also ran across Azerbaijan, Iran, Iraq,\nGeorgia, Ukraine and some Mediterranean countries to Africa, where\noutbreaks were possible.\nDidier Houssin, the French government official in charge of the\ncountry's bird flu defense, told Le Monde newspaper that migrating\nbirds were the most likely source of transmission, using flyways\nbetween the Black Sea region and Mediterranean.\n'This axis raises fears that pockets will emerge in the Middle East\nand then in Africa. It then becomes a very serious threat. One can\nimagine the virus becoming endemic in Africa as it is in several\nAsian countries,' Houssin said.\n'We'd be confronted with great difficulties in controlling the\ndisease, and, in a few months, with the threat of potentially\ninfected birds flying back up to western Europe from Africa.'\n[Byline: David Evans]\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[Pablo Nart has kindly drawn our attention to a recent map of bird\nmigratory routes and countries where avian influenza has been reported:\n<http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4348404.stm#map>.\nFurther reading:\n1.

A sample coming from a heron found on the shore of the river Prut, in Vaslui\ncounty, tested positive for bird flu antibodies,' Agriculture Ministry\nspokesman Adrian Tibu said. Source: Defra News release 469/05, 21 Oct 2005 [edited]\n<http://www.defra.gov.uk/news/2005/051021f.htm>\n\nA highly pathogenic H5 Avian Flu virus has been isolated in a parrot imported\nfrom Suriname, South America. [Our posting 20051020.3055 'Avian influenza, Eurasia (19): Taiwan ex China,\nsuspected' included the following remark: 'it might be assumed that the\nconfiscated birds were probably not domestic poultry. The risk of H5N1 spread by smuggled birds has been raised in the past;\nrecently, the issue has been dealt with in updated European measures to\nprevent the introduction of the virus (see items 3 and 5 below). The EU spokesman said that the tests, carried out at an EU laboratory in\nWeybridge, southwest of London, had proved negative for the H5 strain of the\nvirus. In Greece itself, 3 EU experts arrived Thursday on the island of Chios to help\ninvestigate the suspected case of bird flu, before heading for the Oinousses\nlater in the day. These include culling of the bird consignment and giving antiviral treatment\nas a precautionary measure to the small number of people who have been in\ncontact with the birds. Earlier this month Romania became the 1st European mainland country to detect\nthe deadly H5N1 strain of the disease which has killed more than 60 people and\nmillions of birds in Asia. Farm Minister Gheorghe Flutur said the samples would be sent to a specialised\nlaboratory in Britain as soon as possible to see whether the new case is the\nH5N1 strain of the disease. A 'preliminary test was carried out ... which proved negative but it is not\npossible at this point definitively to conclude from this that the suspicion\nof avian influenza' can be entirely excluded, said spokeswoman Pia Ahrenkilde. The infected birds were hill myna, red-billed leiothrix and black-naped\noriole, according to the [Animal and Plant Health Inspection and Quarantine]\nbureau's director Sung Hua-tsong. It was the 2nd time Taiwan had seized pet birds smuggled from mainland China\nsince coastguards launched a dragnet in August [2005] to crack down on the\nillegal trade. But ordinary Greeks have clearly been alarmed by the outbreak: sales of\npoultry in Greece have plummeted by up to 70 percent since the suspected case\nwas reported on Monday, a union of Greek meat vendors said. The Greek suspected case has come under the spotlight following the\nconfirmation of the H5N1 strain in Romania and Turkey last week, which\ntriggered the EU to bolster its defences against the virus. The provisional good news was also tempered by wrangling in Greece over\nexactly which sample was sent for testing by European Union (EU) experts\nfollowing a suspected case on an Aegean island earlier this week. The Danube delta on the Black Sea, Europe's largest wetlands, is a major way\nstation for migratory wild birds heading from Asia towards winter habitats in\nNorth Africa. [Subscribers are reminded that all H5 and H7 strains are regarded, by the OIE,\nas Notifiable avian influenza (NAI) strains -- even if their pathogenicity is\nfound not to be high. We have\nclosed the bird and animal markets,' Ioan Zaharia, the government's\nrepresentative in the Vaslui county, told private TV station Realitatea. On Wed [19 Oct 2005] night, Supreme Court prosecutor Dimitris Linos ordered a\npreliminary investigation on the procedure followed by the authorities.\n While announcing the negative result, the EU's executive arm underlined that\nprecautionary measures slapped on the eastern Aegean Sea islet of Oinousses\n She also downplayed reports that there had been problems surrounding the\nsamples provided by Greece -- centred on the fate of a lone turkey that\noriginally sparked the scare.

The samples\nindicative of the virus' presence in the 3 dead birds at\nCeamurlia de Jos, Tulcea County, will however be sent for\nconfirmation by expert laboratories in the UK [see further\ncomment below].\nThe European Commission met in an emergency meeting Thu, 13\nOct 2005, whose 1st measure was to ban imports of live birds\nand poultry from Romania.\nMeanwhile, the slaughtering of the birds from certain areas\nin Tulcea County carried on, and quarantine measures taken\nby authorities have been stepped up. Expert doctors did not\nrule out that the residents of Ceamurlia might have come\ninto contact with the virus, yet no such case has been\nreported. It is however reassuring to know that the avian\nflu virus is not transmitted from human to human but only\nfrom the sick birds to humans.\nAuthorities urged population to stay calm, but also asked\npeople to comply with the minimum of hygienic measures, to\navoid purchasing poultry from unauthorised sources and to\ntake antiviral medicines.\nThe National Audiovisual Council (CAN) also called on radio\nand television stations to broadcast information from\nauthorised sources to avoid creating panic among the\npopulation.\nThe European Commission banned Thursday the imports of live\nbirds and poultry from Romania. Brussels made the\nannouncement Wednesday night, which then was reported by\npress agencies. The 3 European experts that the EC sent to\nBucharest confirmed that the H5 virus of the avian influenza\nwas found in the Romanian samples. The embargo comes a day\nafter European experts said the test results in Romania were\nnegative. [again, see further comment below].\nThe risks of the bird flu spreading in Romania are small,\nsay experts of the European Commission who came to Romania.\n'Given that the virus emerged in a small locality, where\nlocals do not buy birds from outside their community,\nchances of the disease spreading are smaller compared with\nwhat would be in a similar case in western Europe,' says\nDanish expert Jorgen Westergaard.\nThe European Commission has announced it will provide\nassistance to Romania in eliminating the bird flu focus at\nLower Ceamurlia.\nFowl farmers are claiming that the contradictory information\nregarding the existence of the bird flu in Romania has\ntriggered a fall of 40 per cent in the sales of fowl and\nproducts, although the risks of an epidemic are minimal as\nlong as the population eats only tested meat.\nThe same farmers are warning that the confirmation of the\nbird flu virus does not mean there is a pandemic. 'There is\ntalk of a pandemic only when this virus has undergone some\nmutations, when the mutated DNA of it further replicates. If\nthere are deficiencies in the replication process, there\nwill be equally odds of the virus being pathogenic or\nnon-pathogenic for humans,' Chairman of the Union of\nRomanian Fowl Farmers Ilie Van told a conference on Thursday\nabout the measures against and the consequences of the bird\nflu.\nRomanian authorities confirmed late Wednesday night into the\nearly hours of Thursday the existence of the avian influenza\nvirus in Romania. Veterinary experts succeeded to isolate\nthe virus 6 days after identifying the viral antibodies in\nthe samples taken from the dead birds at Ceamurlia de Jos,\nTulcea County. [This piece of information, repeatedly\npublished by the Romanians, will need explanation. Were the\nantibodies against H5? Could the birds/geese have died from\nother cause/s? - Mod.AS]\nThe BBC reports it is the 1st time that the avian flu has\nbeen discovered in Europe, since the virus had originated\nand spread through South East Asia. The samples taken from\nthe geese in Ceamurlia de Jos proved positive for the H5\nvirus. Still, whether this is the subtype N1 that had been\ntransmitted to humans and killed 50 people in Asia is yet to\nbe proved.\nThe samples will be sent for analysis to expert laboratories\nin the UK, whose confirmation is expected in a few days. The\nlab tests sent to UK will clearly indicate whether the virus\nsuspected in Romania is the same as the one detected in\nAsia, and also if it is highly or slightly pathogenic. [The\ncontinued confusion about the fate of the said samples and\nthe test results is puzzling. A Romanian statement of 8 Oct\n2005 said that samples were sent by them to the EU/OIE\nReference laboratory in Weybridge; this was refuted by the\nlaboratory, who stated that their experts were due to arrive\nin Romania on Tue, 12 Oct 2005, to take samples. On 13 Oct\n2005, several hours after a Romanian newswire saying that\nthe samples were found negative by EU experts, the EU\nCommission officially announced that 'its experts had\ndetected the H5 virus strain in 2 samples taken in a\nsuspected backyard farm in the Danube delta, while further\ntests were necessary to ascertain if the virus in question\nis the H5N1 strain'. In addition, a statement of Defra,\ndated 13 Oct 2005, said that 'results from further tests to\nfind out the exact strain of (the Romanian H5) virus will be\navailable in a few days'; see\n<http://www.defra.gov.uk/news/latest/2005/animal-1013.htm>.\nClarification will help. - Mod.AS]\nAgriculture Minister Gheorghe Flutur said that measures had\nbeen taken to completely isolate the village in Tulcea\nCounty, and that European officials have also been informed\nthat the virus had been confirmed.\nThe bird flu does not spread by human contact, and it is\ncaught only through direct contact with infected birds.\nDoctors assure that the virus only passes from contaminated\nanimals to humans and not from human to human, but they are\nwarning about the danger of the emergence of a crossbred\nvirus between bird flu and a human influenza virus.\nMeanwhile, birds continue being slaughtered in the area of\nCeamurlia de Jos, with local authorities asking for more\nstaff to take care of the action. 'All the birds at\nCeamurlia de Jos and within a radius of 3 kilometres around\nthe village are being slaughtered,' said the Agriculture\nminister. Authorities in Tulcea requested the sending in the\narea of expert chemical weapons troops, to avoid\nveterinarians from becoming overworked, and to allow bird\nslaughtering to continue at a fast pace.\nMeanwhile, neighbouring counties stepped up the safety\nmeasures. Teams made up of border police and representatives\nof the Braila Veterinary Department (DSV) beefed up the road\nblocks at the Bac Smardan crossing point that connects the\ncounty to the neighbouring county of Tulcea. All the\nvehicles crossing the Danube and entering the municipality\nthrough that point are inspected and disinfected with a\nspecial pump installed at the Bac crossing point.\nAlso, all ship captains received written advisories against\ntransporting birds and animals from Tulcea. Similar safety\nmeasures have also been taken at the Small Island of Braila\nCounty, which is on the list of places with a high risk of\navian flu, given its opening to the Danube and the large\nnumber of migratory birds that take shelter here each year.\nAuthorities in Constanta have also been on alert in the\nnorthern part of the Constanta County, at the border with\nthe Tulcea County, where they are conducting preventive,\ndisinfection, and control measures. The dead body of a\npelican was found on Wednesday night on a field between\nMangalia and Albesti. Given the bird's advanced state of\ndecomposition, no samples have been taken. There are also\nsignals that hundreds of birds had died in the village of\nSilistea over the past few weeks, yet the deaths went\nunreported.\nAnswering a request for medicines by Romania's Health\nMinister, Eugen Nicolaescu, the representatives of the World\nHealth Organisation (WHO) agreed to supply, at no charge,\n1000 of the 5000 doses of antiviral medicines the government\nneeds for the preventive treatment of the population that\ncame into contact with the identified focus of avian flu.\nA special commission was set up at the Health Ministry on\nThursday. The chairmen of the Ministry's expert commissions\nfor infectious diseases and epidemiology respectively, have\nalso been convened. During the next few days, the Health\nMinistry will be made available 25 000 doses of antiviral\nmedicine. In about 10 days, the ministry emergency stock\nwill be supplemented by another 20 000 doses.\nHealth minister Eugen Nicolaescu said that aside from the\nprotection offered by the ministry, 'citizens need to know 3\nbasic things: firstly, to wash their hands with water and\nsoap, secondly, to only purchase poultry and egg from\nauthorised sources, namely veterinary-certified stores, and\nthirdly, to keep away from dead birds or birds that had come\nin contact with dead birds'.\nThe National Audiovisual Council (CNA) requested the radio\nand TV channels to avoid speculations over the bird flu, and\ngive priority to the official information, in order to avoid\nalarming the population. CNA requests the radio companies to\nnot enhance the concern of the people and the speculations,\nto show responsibility and to use insomuch as possible the\nopinion of the specialists in their programmes. CNA recalls\nthat mass media have the obligation to check the information\nfrom their own sources and from occasional collaborators,\ncomparing it with the data furnished by the competent\nauthorities, before transmitting news or points of view\nwhich can generate panic.\n[byline: Alina Grigore]\n******\n[2]\nDate: Fri, 14 Oct 2005\nFrom: Mary Marshall <tropical.forestry@btinternet.com>\nSource: BBC News, 14 Oct 2005 [edited]\n<http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/4341894.stm>\n\n9 people are under medical observation in Turkey after\nreports of 40 pigeons in their neighbourhood died in\nmysterious circumstances.

Those who have been in the\npresence of dead or dying birds are most likely to become\ninfected, and the chances of human-to-human transmission are\nstill seen as very slim.\nIn Turkey, around 8600 birds were culled this week in and\naround the village of Kiziksa, in the neighbouring province\nto Manisa.\nThe Anatolia news agency reported samples from the dead\npigeons have been sent for testing in Izmir, western Turkey.\nThere have been several other reports of unexplained bird\ndeaths in the country, but except for those in Kiziksa, none\nhas been confirmed as bird flu.\nOsman Ozturk, deputy head of the Manisa health department,\nsaid: 'There is no sign of illness in the 9 people.' He said\nthey were put under medical observation simply as a\nprecaution while their house was being disinfected.\nScientists fear that the bird flu virus could mutate into a\nhuman pandemic strain if people suffering normal human flu\nare also infected with the H5N1 type.\nEuropean Union health commissioner Markos Kyprianou\nconfirmed on Thursday that the virus found in the Turkish\nvillage of Kiziksa was the deadly strain, adding: 'There is\na direct relationship with viruses found in Russia,\nMongolia, and China.' He went on: 'It is a highly pathogenic\nand aggressive virus and we in the European Union have to\ndeal with that.'\nThe EU veterinary officers meeting in Brussels will look at\nmeasures to try to reduce the chance of contact between wild\nbirds and poultry in high-risk areas, which could include\nrequiring some poultry to be kept inside.\nA separate EU meeting of bird flu experts is expected to\nissue advice on the potential risk for humans who come into\ncontact with migratory birds.\nEU foreign ministers are also to hold emergency talks on the\nbird flu threat on Tuesday [18 Oct 2005] when they meet in\nLuxembourg for WTO negotiations.\nTurkish authorities have urged calm, amid reports of people\nflocking to pharmacies to buy Tamiflu (oseltamivir), the\nantiviral believed to be most effective against bird flu.\nHealth minister Recep Akdag said the situation was 'under\ncontrol', adding that Ankara was prepared for any possible\nflu pandemic.

Tests for the H5N1 strain are expected\nto be completed on the ducks on Friday. The EU has also\nbanned the import of live birds and feathers from Turkey\nuntil April 2006.\nThe H5N1 strain remained largely in South-East Asia until\nthis summer, when Russia and Kazakhstan both reported\noutbreaks.

The Department of Health stressed its advice on who\nshould be vaccinated against flu was unchanged. It said\nvulnerable groups, such as the elderly and some children, to\nhave the seasonal flu jab as normal. EU veterinary officers\nare holding an emergency meeting in Brussels to discuss\nmeasures to contain bird flu.\nPeople in the UK with weak immune systems, such as children\nwith asthma or diabetes, have long been advised to have an\nannual jab to protect them against flu. 'I don't think, at\nthis stage, the public should feel they are under a\ndifferent threat than before,' said Dr David Salisbury, head\nof immunisation at the Department of Health.\nSince the H5N1 strain of bird flu, which has killed 60\npeople in South East Asia, was confirmed in birds in Turkey\non Thu, 13 Oct 2005, concern has risen about the UK's plans\nto contain any outbreak here.\nNews of the outbreak in north west Turkey came after avian\nflu was also confirmed in ducks in Romania. The EU said\nthose cases were assumed to be the same strain. Samples of\nthe dead birds were sent from Turkey and Romania to the UK\nfor laboratory analysis.\nDavid Salisbury, head of immunisation at the Department of\nHealth, told BBC News that people in identified groups,\nincluding the elderly, children with conditions such as\ndiabetes or asthma, and others who had weakened immune\nsystems should get the seasonal flu vaccination as normal.\nBut he added: 'The currently available vaccine is for people\nvulnerable to flu, but will not protect them against an\nemerging pandemic strain.'\nThe government orders around 14 million doses of flu vaccine\nfor the annual vaccination campaign again seasonal\ninfluenza. But Dr Salisbury said experts were planning for\nthe eventuality of bird flu mutating to spread between\nhumans. 'The risk is very real, we're very aware of what's\nhappening in South East Asia and are monitoring very\ncarefully the spread of disease amongst birds. We're\nwatching very carefully for cases in humans, and the\npresence of bird disease in Europe of course raises\neverybody's anxieties.'\nDr Salisbury said the UK public should not feel the dangers\nfrom bird flu had increased, following the emergence of bird\nflu in Turkey. 'I don't think, at this stage, the public\nshould feel they are under a different threat than before.'\nBut he said the developments in Turkey would be considered\nin UK preparations. He said developing a vaccine would take\n3-5 months, and could only be undertaken once the strain of\nany virus causing a pandemic was identified.\nThis time delay was the reason the UK was stockpiling\nantiviral drugs to treat symptoms if they emerged, Dr\nSalisbury said. The government has ordered 14.6 million\ndoses of the antiviral drug Tamiflu. This would be enough\nfor 25 per cent of the population -- the proportion the\nWorld Health Organization predicts would be affected in a\npandemic. 'Normal' flu affects 5-10 per cent of the\npopulation.\nThe UK government said plans were also in place to contain\nthe spread of avian flu among wild and domestic birds. But\nthe National Farmers' Union has expressed concern that\npublic fears over the virus could damage chicken and poultry\nsales -- even though the virus cannot be passed on through\neating chicken.\nMeanwhile EU specialists are meeting to discuss new measures\nto stop bird flu spreading in Europe after the outbreaks in\nTurkey. The European Commission has already banned the\nimport of live birds, poultry and feathers from Romania.\nEU veterinary officers are also holding emergency meetings\nto explore measures to reduce the chance of contact between\npoultry and wild birds in high risk areas.\n******\n[4]\nDate: Fri, 14 Oct 2005\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: Surfbirds news, 14 Oct 2005 [edited]\n<http://www.surfbirds.com/sbirdsnews/archives/2005/10/avian_influenza.html>\n\nOver the last few weeks, many birdwatchers will have become\naware of considerable media interest in the subject of avian\ninfluenza or 'bird flu', following outbreaks in central Asia\nand the Black Sea region of the highly pathogenic type of\nthe H5N1 virus strain which developed within poultry.\nRepresentatives of BTO (British Trust for Ornithology), WWT\n(Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust), RSPB (Royal Society for the\nProtection of Birds), and JNCC (The Joint Nature\nConservation Committee = UK Government's wildlife adviser)\nhave been involved in discussions with the relevant\ngovernment agencies, principally to advise on the latest\nknowledge of the origins of birds wintering in the UK,\nmigration routes and timing, and bird distributions within\nthe UK. Such information is derived in large part from the\nhard work of volunteers working on schemes such as the BTO\nRinging Scheme and the BTO/WWT/RSPB/JNCC Wetland Bird Survey\n(WeBS). We have also remained in close contact with\ninternational colleagues.\nThe overall assessment is that the chance of this strain of\nthe virus being carried to the UK by a migrating bird is\ncurrently low (and perhaps much less than the chance of\ntransmission via illegally imported poultry). In addition,\neven if the highly pathogenic form of H5N1 avian influenza\ndid make it to the UK, it is important to note that there\nare no known cases of transmission from wild birds to\nhumans. In South East Asia, the virus has spread\n(infrequently) to humans as a result of people coming into\nclose contact with infected poultry within the context of\nthe confined proximities of poultry farms. Thus, the risk to\nhuman health from wild birds carrying avian influenza would\ncurrently appear to be very low.\nNevertheless, it is clearly sensible to keep the situation\nunder review. A number of organisations are working together\nto deliver a national surveillance programme for wild birds\non behalf of Defra; for further details see\n<http://www.defra.gov.uk/animalh/diseases/notifiable/disease/ai/index.htm>.\nThis will include enhanced monitoring for sick or dead\nbirds, coupled with a programme of taking faecal samples\nfrom a) apparently healthy live birds, and b) birds shot as\npart of legal wildfowling activities. As part of this\nprocess, we would ask birdwatchers in the field to keep an\neye out for any suspicious cases of large-scale mortality or\nsickness among wild birds.\nWaterbirds are potentially among the most vulnerable wild\nbirds. Obviously, all birdwatchers encounter dead birds\noccasionally, almost all due to perfectly natural causes, so\nuse your common sense. However, if you should come across an\nincident that seems out of the ordinary, this should be\nreported via the Defra Helpline on 08459 335577. Calls would\nthen be referred to more local laboratories. Specialists at\nthe labs would then make an assessment on what further\naction, if any, should be taken.\nAlthough there have been no proven cases of humans catching\nthe disease from wild birds, the virus is spread through\nnasal secretions and faeces, so please do not touch sick\nbirds or carcasses in the event of a suspicious die-off.\nNote that separate guidelines have been provided to ringers\nand these will be made available to anyone else who\nregularly handles wild birds. In general, however, to guard\nagainst a wide variety of illness including avian influenza\nit is always prudent to exercise basic hygiene (such as\nwashing hands with soap, especially before eating) when\ncoming into close contact with wild animals.\nAt a time when there is a lot of misinformation circulating\non this issue, it is essential to keep matters in\nperspective and to sift fact from fiction. We reiterate\nthat, to the best of our current knowledge, we consider the\nchance of wild birds bringing highly pathogenic H5N1 to the\nUK to be low and the potential for onward transmission from\nwild birds to people to be very low. Obviously, however, we\nare continuing to monitor the situation and if there are any\nfurther developments we will communicate these widely, in\nthe first instance via organisational websites.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[The advice to birdwatchers provided in the common statement\nof the 4 British ornithology-related organisations, includes\ninformation and instructions which are currently useful for\nbirdwatchers anywhere.

Authorities are reporting new outbreaks of\ninfections in birds at 15 poultry farms around the city of Chelyabinsk,\nimmediately east of the Ural mountains [1]. Preliminary results of\npolymerase chain reaction testing have indicated that this is type A/H5N1,\nwhich has also recently caused outbreaks in birds in South-East and Central\nAsia, and Siberia [2].\nThese preliminary results have yet to be confirmed by an international\nreference laboratory.

The A/H7N7 virus is considerably less pathogenic for humans than\nA/H5N1. Because of the threat of spread of the A/H5N1 virus by wild birds\non their east-west migrating routes to the Netherlands [6], on 16 August,\nthe Dutch Ministry of Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality advised\ncommercial poultry farmers to keep poultry indoors at least until the\nbeginning of 2006 [7]. This measure is designed to prevent contact between\nfarmed birds and migratory birds which could be carrying A/H5N1.\nAlthough EU Member States are strengthening their preparedness for a\npotential human influenza pandemic, preparedness for outbreaks on poultry\nfarms also needs to be improved.

Samples sent to a lab in Hong Kong came back\npositive for the H5N1 virus, said Scott Roberton, technical adviser for the\ncivet conservation program at the park.\nHe said other animals at the park have been tested -- including chickens,\nrats and other birds -- but none have tested positive for the virus.\n'It's another good example of how dangerous this thing is,' Mr. Roberton\nsaid. 'No animals are ill, no people are ill. We're still trying to figure\nout where the source was. The civets were not fed any type of poultry, and\n20 other civets of the same species in adjacent cages did not become sick',\nhe said. 'The World Health Organization and Viet Nam health officials are\nexpected to test staff and animal keepers to determine [whether] anyone\ncaring for the civets has been infected with bird flu,' he said.\nAnton Rychener, head of the UN Food and Agriculture Organization and the\nWorld Organization for Animal Health in Hanoi, confirmed the results.\nCat-like civets are captured in the wild and served as a delicacy at\nrestaurants in Viet Nam and China.\nScientists suspect that SARS, or Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, which\nkilled nearly 800 people worldwide in 2003, was passed to humans from civet\ncats and other mongoose-like animals sold in live food markets in southern\nChina.\nPeter Horby, an epidemiologist for the WHO in Hanoi, said the development\nwould not make people more susceptible to bird flu, because humans have\nless contact with civets than [with] poultry. 'The interesting thing is\nthat it's a new species,' he said. 'It continues to surprise.'\nBird flu had previously been found in other mammals, such as cats and tigers.\nThe virus has killed 61 people region-wide, with the bulk of those deaths\nin Viet Nam. Health experts have repeatedly warned that the world is due\nfor an influenza pandemic that could kill millions and cripple economies.\nThey fear the bird flu virus will mutate and become easily transmitted from\nperson to person. So far, most human cases have been traced back to contact\nwith poultry.\nOwston civets are globally threatened and found in southern China, Viet Nam\nand Laos.\n[Similar items have been sent by Christian Griot, A-Lan Banks, Mary\nMarshall and Joe Dudley, who are cordially acknowledged].\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[Owston's Banded Palm Civet (_ Chrotogale owstoni_) belongs to the family\n_Viverridae_, subfamily _Hemigalinae_, genus _Chrotogale_.

Russia is battling to contain a bird flu\noutbreak, which top health officials say has killed more than 11 000 birds\ncountrywide and could spread westwards to Europe, the Middle East and Africa.\nThe outbreak was discovered in mid-July 2005 in Novosibirsk and has spread\nthrough Tyumen, Omsk, Kurgan, Altai and now Chelyabinsk, which is about\n1000 km (600 miles) from Novosibirsk.\nSenior agricultural officials believe the flu was brought by migrating\nbirds from Asia, where more than 50 people have died from the deadly H5N1\nstrain since 2003.\nOfficials fear that the virus could spread to Europe and Africa as tens of\nmillions of birds continue their migration to warmer climates from next\nmonth ahead of Russia's harsh winter.\nChelyabinsk lies in the Ural mountains, the geographic divide between Asia\nand Europe. Russia's top state epidemiologist, Gennady Onishchenko, said\nmigratory birds move on to warmer areas in southern Russia, Africa and\nEurope in the autumn after nesting in Siberia.\nBut the diversity of Siberia's bird species makes plotting the flight paths\nof the birds difficult, specialists in Moscow said.\n'There are about 800 different species of birds in Russia and so there are\nmany different migration flows which criss-cross Russian territory,' said\nDr. Pavel Tomkovich, a senior ornithologist at Moscow's Zoological Museum.\nHe said water fowl will leave to winter in warmer climates, flying through\nRussia's southern regions, northern Kazakhstan, the Caspian and Black seas\ntowards the Mediterranean and north Africa.

It is the 1st instance of this viral strain\noccurring in wild migratory birds with no apparent contact to domestic\npoultry or waterfowl.\nPresent in Mongolia for a health survey of wild bird populations in the\nsouth and north of the country, WCS field vets Drs. William Karesh and\nMartin Gilbert responded to initial reports of the most recent avian\ninfluenza outbreak in Kovsgol Province near the Russian border from the\nMongolian Ministry of Food and Agriculture, which conducted preliminary\ntesting of birds that died at Erkhel Lake. Their finding coincided with\nconfirmations of cases of avian influenza in Russia and Kazakhstan. Karesh\nand Gilbert immediately traveled to the site with a team of Mongolian\nvirologists, veterinarians, and public health officials. Approximately 100\ndead birds were found at the site.\nThe team -- including personnel from WCS, the Mongolian National Academy of\nSciences, the Mongolian Institute of Veterinary Medicine, the State Central\nVeterinary Laboratory, Ministry of Food and Agriculture Veterinary\nDepartment, and the Ministry of Health Mongolian Center of Communicable\nDiseases with Natural Foci -- collected samples from hundreds of wild\nbirds, both live and dead including, ruddy shelduck, herring gull,\nblack-headed gull, bar-headed goose, whooper swan, and Eurasian wigeon that\nare all at risk for contracting the virus.\nRecent reports of influenza outbreaks in wild birds in China and Russia\nhave failed to put die-offs in perspective with the numbers of unaffected\nbirds, thus there was no way to assess the impact. The WCS team at Erkhel\nLake in Mongolia collected this information for the 1st time. Overall, over\n6500 apparently healthy birds of 55 species were observed on the lake. The\npercentage of sick or dead birds was miniscule according to Gilbert\nfollowing the survey, suggesting that either the virus had little effect on\nthe birds or that very few were actually infected by the bug. Early results\nsuggest that it may be the latter.\nSupported by the U.N.'s Food and Agriculture Organization (F.A.O.), the\nteam has sent the samples (774 in total) to the USDA's Poultry Research\nLaboratory in Athens, Georgia, for further testing to determine whether\nthis virus is the H5N1 strain that has killed over 50 people in Southeast\nAsia and more than 5000 wild birds in western China. As of today,\npreliminary tests from one dead whooper swan collected in Mongolia have\nshown the presence of the H5N1 strain of Avian Influenza using RT-PCR,\nwhile results from 30 live whooper swans living at the same site and also a\nnearby lake were negative for the virus. Samples collected from other live\nbirds at the 2 sites, including 60 ruddy shelducks, 24 bar-headed geese,\nand 25 black-headed gulls, were found to be negative for the virus.\nWhereas prior outbreaks in wild birds have happened either in close\nproximity to infected domestic poultry and waterfowl, or in regions where\nsuch contact could not be excluded, Mongolia's paucity of domestic poultry\nsuggests a new vector of avian flu. Finding the H5N1 strain during this\nexpedition suggests that while the highly pathogenic avian influenza can be\ncarried across long distances, the waterfowl species typically identified\nin recent outbreaks appear to be victims rather than effective carriers of\nthe disease.\nThe multidisciplinary, collaborative response to this latest outbreak\nreflects the WCS One World-One Health approach to making informed,\nmultidisciplinary decisions on global health crises that intersect human,\nwildlife, and livestock health. WCS experts are warning that to contain\nthis potential epidemic, prevention activities must include better\nmanagement practices in farms, especially those that are small and\nopen-air, where domestic poultry and waterfowl are allowed to intermingle\nwith wild birds. Officials would also need to monitor wildlife markets,\nwhere wild and domesticated species are kept in close proximity, and risk\nexposure to a wide range of pathogens.\nWildlife and health experts, including the F.A.O., maintain that\nindiscriminate culling of wild migratory bird populations would be\nineffective in preventing the spread of avian flu. 'Focusing our limited\nresources on the hubs and activities where humans, livestock, and wildlife\ncome into close contact,' says Dr. William Karesh, Director of WCS's Field\nVeterinary Program, who lead the WCS team in Mongolia, is 'the best hope\nfor successfully preventing the spread of avian flu and protecting both\npeople and animals.'\n******\n[2]\nDate: Fri, 19 Aug 2005\nFrom: ProMED-mail\nSource: OIE Disease Information Disease Information 19 Aug 2005 Vol. 18 -\nNo. 33 [edited]\n<http://www.oie.int/eng/info/hebdo/AIS_57.HTM#Sec6 >\n\nAvian influenza in Mongolia in migratory birds (follow-up report No. 1) See\nalso: 12 Aug 2005\nInformation received on 18 Aug 2005 from Dr Ravdan Sanjaatogtokh, Director,\nState Veterinary Services, Ministry of Food and Agriculture, Ulaanbaatar:\nEnd of previous report period: 10 Aug 2005 (see Disease Information, 18\n[32], 253, dated 12 Aug 2005).\nEnd of this report period: 18 Aug 2005.\nSuspicious samples were sent on 15 Aug 2005 to the OIE Reference Laboratory\nfor avian influenza at Hokkaido University, Japan.

See\nthe follow-up report at <http://www.oie.int/eng/info/hebdo/AIS_57.HTM#Sec6>.\nThe final results from the OIE reference laboratory in Japan, as well as\nthe genotyping of the identified virus strains from both investigating\nlaboratories, are anticipated with interest. - Mod. AS].\n[Given the reports above, there is a high probability this virus will turn\nout to be H5N1. This only underscores the fact that H5N1 is circulating in\nboth wild birds and domestic poultry over large areas of Central\nAsia. Moreover, the typing of the Russian H5N1 virus indicates that the\nvirus has a relatively close genetic relationship to the strain circulating\nin Southeast Asia. One potential interpretation of the mounting evidence\non the distribution of H5N1 in space and over species is that it has\nexpanded its geographic range by developing a heretofore unrecognized level\nof intensity in its relationship with migratory birds, which unfortunately\nincludes host mortality.\nCooperation of all parties involved, as seen in Mongolia, is critical in\nunderstanding the implications of the new geographic range of the\ndisease. Results of genetic typing of all isolates in all species is\ncritical and will hopefully aid in the interpretation of the molecular\nepidemiology of this newly emerged disease. - Mod.PC]", "summary": "The team -- including personnel from WCS, the Mongolian National Academy of\nSciences, the Mongolian Institute of Veterinary Medicine, the State Central\nVeterinary Laboratory, Ministry of Food and Agriculture Veterinary\nDepartment, and the Ministry of Health Mongolian Center of Communicable\nDiseases with Natural Foci -- collected samples from hundreds of wild\nbirds, both live and dead including, ruddy shelduck, herring gull,\nblack-headed gull, bar-headed goose, whooper swan, and Eurasian wigeon that\nare all at risk for contracting the virus. Field\nVeterinary Program, who lead the WCS team in Mongolia, is 'the best hope\nfor successfully preventing the spread of avian flu and protecting both\npeople and animals.'\n******\n A ProMED-mail post\n<http://www.promedmail.org>\nProMED-mail is a program of the\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\n<http://www.isid.org>\n As of today,\npreliminary tests from one dead whooper swan collected in Mongolia have\nshown the presence of the H5N1 strain of Avian Influenza using RT-PCR,\nwhile results from 30 live whooper swans living at the same site and also a\nnearby lake were negative for the virus. Supported by the U.N.'s Food and Agriculture Organization (F.A.O.), the\nteam has sent the samples (774 in total) to the USDA's Poultry Research\nLaboratory in Athens, Georgia, for further testing to determine whether\nthis virus is the H5N1 strain that has killed over 50 people in Southeast\nAsia and more than 5000 wild birds in western China. WCS experts are warning that to contain\nthis potential epidemic, prevention activities must include better\nmanagement practices in farms, especially those that are small and\nopen-air, where domestic poultry and waterfowl are allowed to intermingle\nwith wild birds. William Karesh and\nMartin Gilbert responded to initial reports of the most recent avian\ninfluenza outbreak in Kovsgol Province near the Russian border from the\nMongolian Ministry of Food and Agriculture, which conducted preliminary\ntesting of birds that died at Erkhel Lake. Finding the H5N1 strain during this\nexpedition suggests that while the highly pathogenic avian influenza can be\ncarried across long distances, the waterfowl species typically identified\nin recent outbreaks appear to be victims rather than effective carriers of\nthe disease. One potential interpretation of the mounting evidence\non the distribution of H5N1 in space and over species is that it has\nexpanded its geographic range by developing a heretofore unrecognized level\nof intensity in its relationship with migratory birds, which unfortunately\nincludes host mortality. Whereas prior outbreaks in wild birds have happened either in close\nproximity to infected domestic poultry and waterfowl, or in regions where\nsuch contact could not be excluded, Mongolia's paucity of domestic poultry\nsuggests a new vector of avian flu. The\npercentage of sick or dead birds was miniscule according to Gilbert\nfollowing the survey, suggesting that either the virus had little effect on\nthe birds or that very few were actually infected by the bug. has positively\nidentified the pathogenic form of avian flu -- H5N1 -- in samples taken\nfrom birds last week in Mongolia by field veterinarians from the Wildlife\nConservation Society (WCS). The following test\nresults were received on 17 Aug 2005:\nSample reference / Bird species / Location / Influenza A virus subtype\n The multidisciplinary, collaborative response to this latest outbreak\nreflects the WCS One World-One Health approach to making informed,\nmultidisciplinary decisions on global health crises that intersect human,\nwildlife, and livestock health.

Recent reports of influenza outbreaks in wild birds in China and Russia\nhave failed to put die-offs in perspective with the numbers of unaffected\nbirds, thus there was no way to assess the impact. Mongolia's follow-up report to the OIE, the temporary\nresults of the virological investigation in 3 samples,from migratory birds\nfound dead at Erhel lake are reportedly H5. [Mongolia's emergency notification to the OIE on the observations in\nmigratory birds (see 20050813.2367) reported that the causal agent was\n'avian influenza virus type A' and that subtyping was in progress. The said results were received\non 17 Aug 2005 from the OIE Reference Laboratory for avian influenza at\nHokkaido University, Japan, to which they had been sent on 15 Aug 2005. It is the 1st instance of this viral strain\noccurring in wild migratory birds with no apparent contact to domestic\npoultry or waterfowl. Wildlife and health experts, including the F.A.O., maintain that\nindiscriminate culling of wild migratory bird populations would be\nineffective in preventing the spread of avian flu.

Please remember, I\nam a psychiatrist, not a vet, and this stuff is hard for me to sort\nout.\nHere is the FAO citation:\n<http://www.fao.org/ag/againfo/subjects/documents/ai/AVIbull026.pdf>\n'Russia: In the last issue of FAO AIDE news (No. 25) we published\ninformation that may have misinterpreted the original scientific\ndata. We have subsequently learned that on several occasions H5N1\navian influenza viruses have been isolated from migrating birds in\nthe Novosibirsk region of Russia during the past 4 years. In 2003, an\nH5 avian influenza virus was isolated and sequenced by the Laboratory\nto Investigate and Monitor Emerging Zoonotic Diseases (Novosibirsk,\nRussia) from a wild mallard duck on Lake Chany in the south of\nWestern Siberia. The A/mallard/Chany/9/03 avian influenza virus was\nrelated, but not identical, to H5N1 avian influenza viruses currently\ncirculating in domestic poultry in Asia. The virus's hemagglutinin\nsequence showed 90-95 percent similarity to the current Asian H5N1,\nwhich is in turn similar to Eurasian H5 avian influenza viruses\nA/duck/Potsdam/1402-6/86 (H5N2) and A/turkey/England/50-92/91 (H5N1).\nThese data emphasize the need for continuing surveillance of\nmigratory birds for avian influenza viruses. Studies of these viruses\nwill increase the understanding of the ecology of avian influenza\nviruses, including the transfer of these viruses between migratory\nbirds and domestic poultry. However, the A/mallard/Chany/9/03 avian\ninfluenza virus is not the same virus as the Asian H5N1, and is not\nevidence of infection and spread of the current Asian H5N1 avian\ninfluenza virus by migratory birds to areas outside infected Asian\ncountries/regions.

It\nmight be assumed that CIDRAP actually meant the 1st known H5N1\n'outbreak' rather than 'appearance' (of the virus) in Russia.\nDr. Lanard's query has been forwarded to Dr. David Swayne, the author\nof the FAO citation. Dr. Swayne (Laboratory Director, Southeast\nPoultry Research Laboratory USDA/ARS, <dswayne@seprl.usda.gov>) has\nkindly forwarded to us the following clarification:\n'All AI viruses are type A influenza viruses in the virus family of\n_Orthomyxoviridae_, but are subdivided into subtypes based on\nhemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N) proteins using serological\ntests. There are 16 H and 9 N subtypes thus potential for 144\ndifferent H and N combinations. In addition, all AI viruses fall into\none of 2 pathotypes: low (LPAI) and high (HPAI) pathogenicity.\nThe virus reported last spring from Novosibirsk is an H5 subtype,\nbut, based on sequencing, was related but not identical to the H5N1\nHPAI viruses in SE Asia. They are like 3rd cousins, only related to\neach other by 90-95 percent. In addition, the SE Asia H5N1 are HPAI\nviruses, but the prior Novosibirsk virus is LPAI virus. The subtype\nof the N has not been reported, so it could be any of the N1-9.\nThe current virus from Novosibirsk has been reported only over the\nInternet as H5N1 and has not been verified as H5N1 by the OIE/FAO or\nWHO reference laboratory. We must [suspend] judgment until verified.'\nWe are very grateful to Dr. Swayne for his response. Final, official\ndata on the current Russian isolate are anticipated.\nFurther reading:\nK.

The nucleotide sequence (and some of\nthe biological properties) of this virus differ from the avian influenza A\n(H5N1) viruses isolated from infected humans in Hong Kong in 1997 and from\nthe various avian influenza viruses isolated more recently in East Asia,\nwhere sequence heterogeneity is being related prematurely to biological\nproperties, such as pathogenicity and host range.\nThe authors of the Journal of Virology paper conclude that their data\nchallenges the view that adaptation to land-based poultry is a prerequisite\nfor the replication of aquatic avian influenza A viruses in humans. This is\na novel and significant conclusion that challenges current dogma.\nThe Abstract of the paper is reproduced below. - Mod.CP]\nTitle: Characterization of a human H5N1 influenza A virus isolated in 2003\nAuthors: K Shinya, M Hatta, S Yamada, A Takada, S Watanabe, P Halfmann, et al.\nABSTRACT: 'In 2003, H5N1 avian influenza virus infections were diagnosed in\n2 Hong Kong residents who had visited the Fujian province in mainland\nChina, affording us the opportunity to characterize one of the viral\nisolates, A/Hong Kong/213/03 (HK213; H5N1). In contrast to H5N1 viruses\nisolated from humans during the 1997 outbreak in Hong Kong, HK213 retained\nseveral features of aquatic bird viruses, including the lack of a deletion\nin the neuraminidase stalk and the absence of additional oligosaccharide\nchains at the globular head of the hemagglutinin molecule. It demonstrated\nweak pathogenicity in mice and ferrets but caused lethal infection in\nchickens. The original isolate failed to produce disease in ducks but\nbecame more pathogenic after 5 passages.

Currently, at risk people\nin the UK -- the elderly and ill -- need annual flu jabs, and there\nis no jab available yet guaranteed to beat avian influenza.\nBiotechnology firm Acambis, in Cambridge, UK says it hopes its jab\nwill target numerous mutations that presently allow flu to evade\nattack. However, the work is very early and is years off being tested\nin humans.\nEach year, winter flu kills around 4000 people in the UK. Globally,\nbetween 500 000 and one million people die each year from influenza.\nIf the avian influenza virus currently circulating in Asia were to\nmutate and spread from person to person, it could kill as many people\nas the 1918 Spanish flu, which claimed between 20 and 40 million\nlives, experts have warned.\nCurrent influenza vaccines work by giving immunity to 2 proteins\ncalled hemagglutinin and neuraminidase, which are found on the\nsurface of flu viruses. However, these proteins keep mutating, which\nmeans doctors have to keep making new vaccines to keep up. Scientists\nat Acambis' laboratory in the US, together with Belgian researchers\nat Flanders Interuniversity Institute for Biotechnology, are focusing\ntheir efforts on a different protein, called M2, which does not\nmutate, as well as other technology that they cannot disclose yet for\ncommercial reasons. If successful, a single shot of the vaccine could\nprotect a person against all strains of influenza virus, they\nbelieve. Dr. Thomas Monath, chief scientific officer at Acambis,\nsaid: 'We aim to avoid the need for annual re-engineering and\nmanufacture of the new product, something that is not yet possible\nwith existing vaccines. The need to develop a new vaccine each time a\ndifferent influenza strain emerges often results in long delays\nbefore a population can be protected. The technology also has special\nimportance as a potential means of protecting human populations\nagainst pandemic influenza strains. So far, the vaccine has only been\ntested in animals. The scientists said it would take several years\nbefore large-scale human trials could be done.\nProfessor Maria Zambon, a flu expert at the Health Protection Agency,\nsaid: 'We welcome advances in the process of developing novel flu\nvaccines and vaccination techniques. However, this vaccine is still\nvery early in a vaccine development pipeline, and it will take some\ntime to establish how this vaccine performs in human trials and\nwhether it can proceed to being licensed for use in the UK.'\nProfessor Karl Nicholson, professor of infectious diseases at\nLeicester University, said: 'It would be enormously helpful to\nmankind to have just the one vaccine, but, sadly, I think it is a\nlong way off.' He said it might be 10 years before any such product\ncould be ready for widespread use in humans.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n******\n[2]\nDate: Sun 7 Aug 2005\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: The New York Times, Sun 7 Aug 2005 [edited]\n<http://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/07/health/07vaccine.html?th&emc=th>\n\nAvian Influenza Vaccine Called Effective in Human Testing\n-----------------------------------------------\nGovernment scientists say they have successfully tested in people a\nvaccine that they believe can protect against the strain of avian\ninfluenza that is spreading in birds through Asia and Russia. Health\nofficials have been racing to develop a vaccine because they worry\nthat, if that strain mutated and combined with a human influenza\nvirus to create a new virus, it could spread rapidly through the\nworld. (The vaccine cannot lead to such a situation, because it is\nmade from killed virus.) Tens of millions of birds have died from\ninfection with the virus and culling to prevent the spread of the\nvirus. About 100 people have been infected, and about 50 [112 and 57\nas of 5 Aug 2005 - Mod.CP] have died from this strain of the avian\ninfluenza virus, called A(H5N1). So far, there has been no sustained\nhuman-to-human transmission, but that is what health officials fear,\nbecause it could cause a pandemic. And that fear has driven the\nintense research to develop a vaccine.\nThe Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious\nDiseases, Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, said that while the vaccine that has\nundergone preliminary tests could be used on an emergency basis if a\npandemic developed, it would still be several months before that\nvaccine is tested further and, if licensed, offered to the public. He\ncautioned: 'We don't have all the vaccine we need to meet the\npossible demand. The critical issue now is, can we make enough\nvaccine, given the well-known inability of the vaccine industry to\nmake enough vaccine.'\nAn earlier human vaccine against A(H5N1) avian influenza virus was\nprepared after it 1st appeared in the world, in Hong Kong in 1997.\nThat vaccine was never fully developed or used, and the strain has\nmutated since then. In interviews over recent days, Dr. Fauci has\nsaid that tests so far have shown that the new vaccine produced a\nstrong immune response among the small group of healthy adults under\nage 65 who volunteered to receive it, although the doses needed were\nhigher than in the standard influenza vaccine offered each year. The\nvaccine, developed with genetic engineering techniques, is intended\nto protect against infection, not to treat those who are sick.\nFurther tests are expected to be conducted among 2 groups -- people\n65 and older, and children -- over the next several months. Dr. Fauci\nexpressed confidence that they would confirm the success of the 1st\ntests and answer remaining scientific questions.\nBecause the vaccine is made in chicken eggs, 'a potential major\nstumbling block' to successful mass production is the number of eggs\nfarmers can supply to vaccine manufacturers, Dr. Fauci said. If\nmanufacturers can overcome such hurdles, the new vaccine could go far\nin averting a possible pandemic of human influenza, Dr. Fauci said.\nOnly a small number of human cases of A(H5N1) influenza have been\nfound. Although a few cases may have been transmitted from person to\nperson in Asia, the A(H5N1) strain has not garnered enough strength\nto spread widely among humans anywhere. As of Friday [5 Aug 2005]\nnight, according to the World Health Organization in Geneva, the\navian strain has killed 57 of the 112 people it has been known to\ninfect in 4 countries. They are Cambodia (4 cases), Indonesia (one\ncase), Thailand (17 cases), and Viet Nam (90 cases).\nThe additional tests are needed in part to determine the optimal dose\nof vaccine; how many shots people will need for protection; and\nwhether adding another ingredient called an adjuvant to the vaccine\ncould raise the potency of lower doses, stretching the number of\npeople that could be protected. Even when these tests are completed,\nmore time will be needed before the Food and Drug Administration can\nlicense the human vaccine and before policy makers determine the when\nand how it should be administered.\nGovernment researchers and others developed the vaccine, which is\nproduced by Sanofi-Pasteur, a French vaccine company that is now part\nof Aventis. The government could decide to release the product under\nemergency conditions if an A(H5N1) influenza pandemic struck before\nthe testing process was completed. Although cautioning that the\nvaccine has not been fully tested, Dr. Fauci said that the initial\ntest findings have given the federal government enough confidence to\nstart the process of adding millions more doses of the vaccine to the\n2 million it has bought. The present supply is stored in bulk form,\nand 'we cannot put it in vials until we find out what the right dose\nis,' Dr. Fauci said. The manufacturer needs to know the dose and\nregimen to determine how much more vaccine it can produce and make\navailable to the United States and other customers.\nScientists had to test the human avian influenza vaccine on\nvolunteers, because the A(H5N1) strain differs in significant ways\nfrom the conventional strains that cause human influenza. Also, the\ninfluenza shots that are offered each year are derived from the human\nstrains that are circulating most widely at the time experts choose\nthe components of the next vaccine. Human influenza viruses mutate\nenough each year to force changes in the standard vaccines. Such\nvaccines produce a broader and stronger immunity, because recipients\nbuild up an immunity to influenza from repeated immunizations and\nexposure to the influenza virus. In a sense, the standard annual\ninfluenza shots are booster doses. But the A(H5N1) vaccine is a\nprimary immunization because, having had no exposure to that virus,\npeople lack any immunity to the avian strain.\nThe United States is thought to be the only country that has produced\na human vaccine against the A(H5N1) influenza strain. Australia,\nCanada, France, Japan [and the UK] are among countries where\nscientists are trying to develop human avian influenza vaccines,\naccording to the World Health Organization.\nDr. Fauci's institute also contracted with Chiron, which is based in\nEmeryville, California to make another A(H5N1) vaccine. But tests of\nthe Chiron vaccine have not started because of delays related to\nprior contamination found in Chiron's plants. Dr. Fauci said his\ninstitute has 8000 doses of the Chiron human A(H5N1) vaccine and\nhopes to start testing it in volunteers in late fall. The tests will\nfollow the same steps taken with the Sanofi-Pasteur vaccine, he said.\n[Byline: Lawrence K.

Only specific protein signatures\nof the highly pathogenic H5N1 strain were spotted at ICMR's influenza\nreferral laboratory in Chennai's King Institute of Preventive Medicine-the\ndisease itself has not been detected.\nResearchers found the H5N1 signs in samples collected in 2002, which was\nconfirmed by the world's foremost infectious diseases laboratory, the\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Atlanta late in 2004. Dr\nNirmal K Ganguly, director general of ICMR, told this website newspaper\nthat he was not aware of such a finding, suggesting that if such a\nhigh-profile exotic virus were to surface in India, his staff would alert\nhim. However, he was at the moment in total darkness about the discovery.\nDr Jackie Katz of the CDC's Influenza Branch confirmed to this website\nnewspaper that the 3 people tested positive for antibody to a highly\npathogenic H5N1 virus. Dr Katz added that here is no cause for alarm.\nTill now, only these protein signatures have been found, and irrefutable\nevidence of whether the deadly H5N1 strain is present in humans in India\ncan emerge only when the virus is isolated and sequenced.\nBut virus isolation and sequencing has not been attempted in India, as\nthere is a lack of such a secure bio-safety facility, said Dr A C Mishra,\ndirector of the National Institute of Virology, Pune. He added that a\nhigh-level meeting is being organised at ICMR soon to take stock of the\nsituation and decide on the steps to be taken.\nThe H5N1 strain normally infects only birds -- in poultry it causes\nepidemics -- but is worrisome because it has been found to jump the species\nbarrier and infect humans, like what happened in Hong Kong in 1997, when 6\npeople died and the entire 1.5 million bird poultry stock of the island had\nto culled.\nThe avian influenza virus has been in the headlines since its outbreak in\nEast Asia in 2004, and the World Health Organisation (WHO) has issued a\nglobal alert about this highly contagious bug. The WHO Regional\nRepresentative to India, Dr Salim Habayeb, expressed complete surprise that\nhe was not informed about this finding by the government, even though he\ngets a weekly report of prevalent communicable animal and human diseases.\nExpressing concern, Dr Habayeb said the H5N1 strain is very [virulent], as\nit mutates very quickly -- a benign non-pathogenic strain could quickly\nbecome a deadly virus, since this particular family of bugs are known to\nswap genes at a very rapid pace.\nBut Habayeb says there is no reason to panic, as India has adequate\nmechanisms for control of disease outbreaks, citing the effective handling\nof the SARS incident.\nIndian researcher Dr Nalini Ramamurthy, director of The King Institute of\nPreventive Medicine, Chennai said their group chanced upon these 3 cases of\nseropositivity in a poultry farm in Kattangalathur, about 45 km south of\nChennai, while routinely monitoring the human population for influenza\nantibodies.\nAll 3 who show positivity have never travelled overseas, nor is any poultry\nimported into India from East Asia regions where epidemics have occurred --\nso a native exposure to the virus is the only alternative, she says.\nDr Ramamurthy believes that the nearby Vedanthangal Bird Sanctuary, which\nis visited by many migratory water birds, could be the source of the\ninfection. But a study urgently needs to be undertaken to see if the\nseroprevalence has spread to other farms or not, says Dr Ramamurthy.\nAccording to the WHO's standard operating procedures, whenever signatures\nof such a highly pathogenic strain are found, intensive studies of both the\nbirds and humans in the area should be undertaken so the source can be\nidentified. Even Katz suggests that continued testing of humans and poultry\nneeds to be undertaken so that we may better understand the risks of human\ninfection with avian influenza viruses.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[H5N1 is a highly pathogenic strain of influenza for poultry. While\nnumerous H5N1 outbreaks have been reported since late 2003 in most (if not\nall) East Asian countries, no single report of an avian flu outbreak from\nneighboring India has been documented since 2001. In the above reports it\nis stated that the samples in question were drawn in 2002 from 3 local\npoultry farm workers and that the seropositive results obtained by the CDC\n(Atlanta) have been available in ICMR since late 2004. Poultry is a major\nstate industry for the area, and migratory birds arrive every year on Tamil\nNadu's coast in Vedanthangal, north of Chennai. Therefore, it is rather\npuzzling that 3 people were infected with the HPAI H5N1 while working in\nthe poultry farm(s), but that no sick or dead birds were ever discovered or\nreported by the local or national health authorities, such as ICMR.

Till now, only these protein signatures have been found, and irrefutable\nevidence of whether the deadly H5N1 strain is present in humans in India\ncan emerge only when the virus is isolated and sequenced.\n Therefore, it is rather\npuzzling that 3 people were infected with the HPAI H5N1 while working in\nthe poultry farm(s), but that no sick or dead birds were ever discovered or\nreported by the local or national health authorities, such as ICMR. Only specific protein signatures\nof the highly pathogenic H5N1 strain were spotted at ICMR's influenza\nreferral laboratory in Chennai's King Institute of Preventive Medicine-the\ndisease itself has not been detected. Even Katz suggests that continued testing of humans and poultry\nneeds to be undertaken so that we may better understand the risks of human\ninfection with avian influenza viruses.\n While\nnumerous H5N1 outbreaks have been reported since late 2003 in most (if not\nall) East Asian countries, no single report of an avian flu outbreak from\nneighboring India has been documented since 2001. \nDr Ramamurthy believes that the nearby Vedanthangal Bird Sanctuary, which\nis visited by many migratory water birds, could be the source of the\ninfection.

All 3 who show positivity have never travelled overseas, nor is any poultry\nimported into India from East Asia regions where epidemics have occurred --\nso a native exposure to the virus is the only alternative, she says. Dr Jackie Katz of the CDC's Influenza Branch confirmed to this website\nnewspaper that the 3 people tested positive for antibody to a highly\npathogenic H5N1 virus. Researchers found the H5N1 signs in samples collected in 2002, which was\nconfirmed by the world's foremost infectious diseases laboratory, the\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Atlanta late in 2004. The avian influenza virus has been in the headlines since its outbreak in\nEast Asia in 2004, and the World Health Organisation (WHO) has issued a\nglobal alert about this highly contagious bug. Poultry is a major\nstate industry for the area, and migratory birds arrive every year on Tamil\nNadu's coast in Vedanthangal, north of Chennai. But virus isolation and sequencing has not been attempted in India, as\nthere is a lack of such a secure bio-safety facility, said Dr A C Mishra,\ndirector of the National Institute of Virology, Pune.

The majority are doing so without\nshowing symptoms of illness.\nFindings from this study also show that, compared to highly\npathogenic avian influenza [HPAI] viruses from previous outbreaks, the\nrecent H5N1 viruses survive several days longer in the environment.\nThe study found that the quantities of virus excreted by\nhealthy-looking ducks approach those excreted by diseased -- and\nvisibly very ill -- chickens. This suggests that domestic ducks might\nnow be acting as a 'silent' reservoir for the H5N1 virus, which is\nhighly pathogenic for chickens.\nTo date, no evidence has linked human H5N1 cases to exposure to\nasymptomatic domestic ducks. However, the laboratory findings come at\na time when some human cases could not be traced to contact with\ndiseased or dead poultry.\nIn terms of preventing further human cases, it is of public health\nconcern that ducks may be infected and shed virus for long periods,\nyet issue no 'warning signal' in the form of visible signs and\nsymptoms that alert people to take precautions. The concern is\ngreatest in rural areas of affected countries, where free-ranging\nducks and chickens often mingle, frequently sharing the same water\nsupplies.\nThe new findings expand on recent evidence, based on characterization\nof H5N1 viruses from southern China, that domestic ducks have played\na central role in generating and maintaining H5N1, in its highly\npathogenic form, in parts of Asia.

Such information will allow a focused approach to\nthe prevention of human cases arising from exposure to apparently\nhealthy domestic ducks.\nThe wider implications of the role played by domestic ducks are being\njointly considered by FAO and OIE in formulating a long-term strategy\nfor bringing the current outbreaks in poultry under control. With the\nH5N1 virus now endemic in parts of Asia, significant changes in\nfarming practices may be needed to control the disease, especially in\nrural areas, and thus reduce opportunities for community-wide\nexposure.\nIn animals, surveillance remains the key to prevention and control,\nand this activity needs to be adequately supported.\nFAO and OIE have recently issued comprehensive guidelines for\nresponding to the outbreaks of H5N1 in poultry in Asia.\n[See 20040927.2672 and\n<http://www.oie.int/eng/AVIAN_INFLUENZA/FAO%20recommendations%20on%20HPAI.pdf>].\nThe 2 agencies are conducting research on the epidemiology of H5N1\ninfection in ducks and on the use of vaccination to control infection.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[According to the CSR notification, the laboratory studies mentioned\nwere completed last week [3rd week of October 2004] by researchers at\nthe WHO collaborating center for animal influenza viruses at St. Jude\nChildren's Research Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee, USA.

These 2\nisolates have been subjected to detailed analysis and have been shown to be\nhighly homologous to the duck-derived H5N1 virus isolated recently in birds\nin China.\nAccording to the Chinese authorities, no variation in the virus has been\nobserved. More recently, as part of their ongoing epidemiological\nsurveillance programme, 1.1 million samples including 4447 from pigs have\nbeen collected and analysed between April and August 2004 from 10 provinces\nincluding Fujian, and no infection from H5N1 has been detected in pigs.\nThe above findings do not at this stage indicate any major evolution\nregarding H5N1 infection in pigs.\nHowever, the OIE wishes to insist on the necessity for Member Countries\naffected by avian influenza to increase their epidemiological surveillance\nto better understand the implications of the existence of H5N1 virus in pigs.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[We hope that OIE's call for greater emphasis on swine influenza is\naccepted by all members, not just in the letter of the regulation but also\nin its spirit. FAO has also highlighted this need by emphasizing the need\nfor sub-regional surveillance networks (see 20040827.2401 below).\nCalls by OIE, FAO and WHO for a greater focus on the status of H5N1 in\nswine are entirely appropriate but should be accompanied by a reminder that\ntransparency of results and particularly publication of data is crucial\nwhen a significant new finding affecting the epidemiology of the influenza\nvirus comes forth. The salient feature of transparent reporting systems is\nnot only that everyone in the world knows what is going on, but they know\nit in a timely fashion. Clearly in this case timeliness was an issue, as\nmany of these isolations occurred a few years ago [see the comments of\nMod.CP in 20040822.2330 below].\nThe H5N1 virus appears to have evolved in China. We must study its\nevolution and epidemiology wherever and whenever the disease occurs.\nChinese scientists will be the leaders in this effort, but the results must\nbe open to scientists everywhere. Publications like the one Chen and\nWebster submitted to the National Academy of Science in the USA are very\nhelpful in this regard, as they are immediately accessible to a wide\nspectrum of scientists all over the world. Clearly, scientists from outside\nChina should pay better attention to Chinese journals such as the Chinese\nJournal of Preventive Veterinary Medicine (see 20040822.2330) as well --\neven if they have to get help with articles published in Chinese.\nSince the SARS epidemic, China has made significant strides in\ntransparency, as evidenced by a surveillance program testing 1.1 million\nsamples since April and the publications cited above.

This situation is too important to both human and animal health\nauthorities worldwide for any unnecessary unanswered questions. For\nexample, Dr. Marty Zaluski of the North Carolina Department of Agriculture\nwanted to know the significance of the results given; we didn't know\nwhether the swabs were from nasal or tissue swabs.

The discovery reinforces fears that a human pandemic of the\ndisease could yet occur. Avian flu hit the headlines in 1997 when a strain\ncalled H5N1 jumped from chickens to people, killing 6 people in Hong Kong.\nWithin 3 days, the country's entire chicken population was slaughtered and\nthe outbreak was controlled.\nSince then new strains of virus have emerged, killing a further 14 people.\nAs yet, no strain has been able to jump routinely from person to person.\nBut if a more virulent strain evolves, the fear is that it could trigger\nwidespread outbreaks, potentially affecting millions of people.\nNow, genetic and animal studies show that the virus is becoming more\nmenacing to mammals. Immediate action is needed to stem the virus's\ntransmission, says Hualan Chen from Harbin Veterinary Research Institute,\nChina, who was involved in the research.\nChen and colleagues studied 21 H5N1 flu virus samples taken from apparently\nhealthy ducks, which act as a natural reservoir for the disease, in\nsouthern China between 1999 and 2002. The researchers inoculated groups of\nchickens, mice and ducks with virus samples taken from different years and\nwaited to see which animals became ill. Their results are presented this\nweek in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. [not yet on\nwebsite <http://www.pnas.org/> that I can find. - Mod.SH].\nAs expected, ducks were immune to the virus's effects and the chickens fell\nsick. However, the mice also became ill, losing weight and the use of their\nlimbs. Crucially, the severity of their illness was linked with the year\nfrom which the virus sample was taken. Viruses isolated in 2001 and 2002\nmade the animals more ill than those isolated earlier on. The findings hint\nthat some time around 2001, the virus became adept at infecting mammals.\nGenetic analysis of the same samples reveals that the virus's DNA changed\nover that time, suggesting that accumulated mutations may have contributed\nto the increased virulence.\nResearchers are concerned that a virus that has acquired the ability to\ninfect mice could also infect humans. 'The disease could resurge [sic] at\nany time,' warns virologist Marion Koopmans from the National Institute of\nPublic Health and the Environment in Bilthoven, the Netherlands. The\nfindings highlight the need for improved surveillance to ensure that any\nfuture outbreaks are curtailed, she says. Although domestic poultry are\neasily culled, wild animals are more difficult to contain. 'It is\nimpossible to eradicate the natural reservoir,' says Koopmans, 'so we need\nto learn to live with it.'\nBirds may not be the only villains in this story, however. Chen believes\nthat pigs may also play a part. In Asia, chickens and pigs are often kept\nin close proximity, so the virus may have shuffled back and forth between\nthe 2 species, picking up mutations and becoming better at infecting\nmammalian hosts. Humans may then have caught the disease from swine.\n[byline: Helen R Pilcher]\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[It is difficult to evaluate these experiments. There is no doubt a\npotential reservoir of genetic variation in wild water fowl that could\nabruptly -- by genetic interaction (reassortment of genome subunits of\navian and mammalian viruses during co-infection of a common host), or\ngradually by progressive mutation -- generate a new human pandemic strain\nexpressing novel antigens to which the human population has no prior\nimmunity. That this has not happened in recent years indicates that the\nevolution of a pandemic virus is a complex and relatively infrequent\nphenomenon.\nThe experiments of Chen and colleagues show that a temporal series of\nisolates of H5N1 virus from ducks exhibited increasing virulence when\ninoculated into mice. Why this phenomenon is temporally related is unclear.\nThese observations conflict with the results of previous phylogenetic\nanalysis, which indicated that avian influenza viruses from wild fowl have\nnot evolved much over the past 60 years in contrast to mammalian viruses,\nand as a consequence it has been concluded that influenza viruses in wild\nbirds appear to be in 'evolutionary stasis'.

Anecdotal reports\nof fatal infections in cats also emerged during the outbreak.\nKuiken and his colleagues investigated whether the virus could make cats\nsick when the pathogen was introduced into their airways or when the cats\nate infected chickens.\nThe researchers introduced the H5N1 virus into the airways of 3 cats. 3\nother cats were fed an infected chick. Finally, 2 cats were exposed to the\nvirus by being placed in the same cage as the 1st 3 cats.\nThe cats soon showed signs of disease: raised body temperature, decreased\nactivity, and labored breathing. All developed severe lung disease. One cat\ndied after 6 days of infection.\n'Were we surprised? Yes!' Kuiken said. 'Although we had expected to see\nsome pathologic change in the lungs -- because of the anecdotal reports of\ncats dying from H5N1 virus infection in Thailand -- we didn't expect them\nto be so severe and present in all animals.'\n'Often an infectious agent that causes mortality in the field has a much\nless severe effect when the infection is performed in the laboratory,'\nKuiken added. 'With H5N1 virus, the experimental infection also resulted in\nsevere lesions.'\nPreviously there were no reports of disease in cats from infection with an\ninfluenza A virus. Kuiken says the evidence of transmission from cat to cat\nis a particularly important finding.\n'With all of the human cases of H5N1 virus infection, the virus was\ntransmitted from bird to human (bird to mammal), not from human to human\n(mammal to mammal),' Kuiken said. 'Our study shows that H5N1 virus\ntransmission from cat to cat (mammal to mammal) is possible.'\nThe ability of the virus to infect cats suggests that cats could enable the\npathogen to adapt to mammals. If the virus could replicate more easily in\ncats, it also might replicate more easily in humans, increasing the risk of\na human influenza pandemic.\n'That this H5N1 virus caused pneumonia and death in cats suggests that the\nvirus has increased its ability to cause disease in this species -- not\nthat the species is less resistant,' Kuiken said.\nSome scientists downplay the threat of the new findings.\n'To be a significant new threat, the infection would have to keep the cat\nwell enough to travel and spread and yet sick enough to maintain high doses\nof virus so that transmission is achieved,' said Ian Jones, a professor at\nthe School of Animal and Microbial Sciences at the University of Reading in\nEngland.\n'This experimental situation shows this can occur. But it is a long way\nfrom the natural situation where a sick animal may hide away or die,' he\nadded. 'So the real increase in risk may actually be quite small.'\nMichael Lai, a professor of molecular microbiology and immunology at the\nUniversity of Southern California in Los Angeles, says the report should\nnot scare people.\n'It's true that the more animals the virus can infect, the more likely the\nvirus can spread to humans,' Lai said.

These outbreaks could either be new outbreaks\nof Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza A(H5N1) virus, or, a continuation of\nthe outbreaks 1st reported earlier in 2004. These events, in addition to 2\nnew research reports -- about the virus becoming increasingly pathogenic\nand becoming more widespread in birds in the region -- fuel the World\nHealth Organization's concern about the threat the virus poses to human health.\nWHO has been concerned about this virus, influenza A(H5N1) virus, because\nof its threat to humans, both in farm settings in Asia, and, its greater,\npotentially global risk. Several countries in Asia have witnessed this\nvirus crossing the species barrier -- moving from infected chickens or\nducks directly into humans -- in 3 documented outbreaks since 1997. These\ndirect human infections have produced severe, and sometimes fatal,\noutcomes. Moreover, the virus has the potential to acquire the ability to\nspread easily from human to human, and, thus, trigger a global influenza\npandemic.\nNow, 2 research reports have added to our understanding of this virus. 1st,\nmembers of China's Ministry of Agriculture, and colleagues, reported, in a\npaper published last week [1st week of July 2004] in the Proceedings of the\nNational Academy of Sciences, that the virus appears to be widespread in\ndomestic ducks in southern China. Further, the scientists found that the\nvirus is causing increasingly severe disease. However, these trials were\ndone in mice and may not have a direct implication for humans.\nDuring the 2nd week of July 2004, the journal Nature published a report\n[see following report - Mod.CP] which indicates domestic and wild birds in\nthe region may have contributed to the increasing spread of the virus, and,\nsuggests that the virus is gaining a stronger foothold in the region. These\nobservations suggest that control of the virus may be even more difficult\nthan thought in the spring of 2004.\nEffective risk management tools exist to control outbreaks of influenza\nA(H5N1) virus infection, when they are detected in poultry operations.\nChina, for example, was quick to employ these tools during the 1st week of\nJuly 2004, when an outbreak was discovered in Anhui province. These\nrisk-management measures include the culling of infected and exposed birds,\nstringent biosecurity measures, and vaccination. While this approach can\nstill take months, or, even years to contain the virus completely, these\nmethods have been effective in the past.\nHowever, tools to assess the risk to human health are less well developed.\nWhile recent reports indicate the virus has been present consistently in\nthe environment for the last several years, it has still not acquired the\nability to infect humans easily. Why? Is there something about this virus\nwhich resists this development? Given the recent reports, WHO urges, and\noffers assistance, that such risk-assessment activities -- including\nsurveillance in animals and humans, and strain analysis -- be undertaken as\nsoon as possible.\nMore knowledge of the virus could be acquired if WHO had full access to all\nvirus isolates, and clinical specimens, from recent outbreaks. All H5N1\nviruses are not the same, and how they differ could provide important\ninsights. For example, the work reported in Nature suggests that the\nIndonesian avian influenza virus, while belonging to the genotype of\nviruses seen in Viet Nam and Thailand, is also distinct. What, if any,\nimpact does this difference have? With this information, public health\nplanners would know that they are confronting the same virus in all of the\nrecent outbreaks in Asia. This is another set of the many questions that\nneed to be answered imperatively.\nPandemic preparedness activities started by WHO in the wake of the\noutbreaks reported earlier in 2004 continue. Less than two weeks ago [end\nof June 2004], WHO hosted a meeting in Kuala Lumpur with experts from 13\ncountries and areas of the Asia-Pacific region. Among other activities, the\nmeeting participants were provided with a WHO preparedness self-assessment\ntool. WHO is collaborating with scientists, and the pharmaceutical\ncommunity, on a global surveillance system to monitor changes in the\nvirus's susceptibility to known antivirals. Finally, pandemic vaccine\ndevelopment continues. 2 vaccine manufacturers, both based in the United\nStates, have produced a supply of trial vaccine which will be tested for\nsafety and efficacy in humans.\nIn summary, recent developments suggest that:\n* the virus is more widespread than previously thought and found in wild\nbirds, and, therefore, it may be more difficult to eliminate.\n* virus isolates and specimens from all recent outbreaks need to be shared\nwith the WHO laboratory network to monitor the circulating viruses and to\nassess the adequacy of the current pandemic vaccine strain.\n* as control measures are strengthened, national governments are encouraged\nto provide human influenza vaccinations to culling workers.\n* all people, especially culling workers, exposed to infected birds need to\nbe provided with antivirals.\n* human trials of experimental influenza pandemic vaccines should be\naccelerated.\n* while early identification of avian influenza cases in humans is\ndifficult, stepped up surveillance for the early detection of the disease\nin humans is essential.\nThe risk of emergence of a new human pandemic virus will remain as long as\nthe avian influenza virus exists in the environment. WHO's concern, and\nactivities, continue at a high level following recent reports. Because the\nH5N1 threat is unlikely to be resolved in the short term, WHO is working\nwith other international agencies, including the Food and Agricultural\nOrganization (FAO), and World Organization for Animal Health (OIE), to\nmonitor events.\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n******\n[2]\nDate: Thu 8 Jul 2004\nFrom: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>\nSource: Nature 430, 209 - 213, Thu 8 July 2004 [edited]\n\nGenesis of the H5N1 virus associated with human illness in East Asia\n-----------------------------------------------\n[The following is the reference for the Nature paper referred to in the\npreceding WHO statement, and the accompanying abstract. - Mod.CP]\nTitle: Genesis of a highly pathogenic and potentially pandemic H5N1\ninfluenza virus in eastern Asia\nAuthors: K.S.

Like the 1997\nvirus, the new strain does not appear to contain sequences from human flu\nviruses that would speed its spread from person to person, lessening fears\nthat a lethal pandemic flu may be imminent.\nMalik Peiris, a microbiologist at the University of Hong Kong who is\nstudying the new virus, told 'The Scientist' that the avian influenza virus\nstrain from the 9-year-old boy is completely sequenced. The 6 internal\ngenes of the virus, as well as the neuraminidase gene, are derived from a\ndifferent genetic lineage from that of the 1997 virus. Only the\nhaemagglutinin derives from the same lineage as 1997. 'In addition, we also\ncan establish that the virus has not acquired any human influenza internal\ngenes,' said Pieris.\nAlthough similar, this year's hemagglutinin gene 'has undergone change, so\nthat the 1997 and 2003 viruses, while related, can be distinguished\nserologically. In addition to being antigenically different the 2003 virus\nappears to be more pathogenic for ducks than its predecessor,' Ian Gust\ntold The Scientist. 'The factors which control infectivity seem to lie on\ngenes other than those coding for the H5 and N1 surface proteins.' Gust, at\nthe University of Melbourne in Australia, is collaborating with the WHO\ninfluenza research team.\nPeiris says he is reassured by the fact that the bird virus has not\nreassorted with a human influenza virus, which probably hampers its ability\nto infect people. 'However, it is not possible to say with certainty that\nthis virus will not transmit human to human, purely from genetic data. The\nepidemiological data is important. The key will be to enhance surveillance\nin humans to ascertain whether there are further human cases. So far, there\nare none.'\nAlthough the Hong Kong death occurred less than 2 weeks ago, researchers\nwere able to move quickly with genetic studies because they set up an early\nwarning system after the 1997 outbreak and had already been studying the\nrecent infections in Hong Kong birds. 'The precursors of these viruses are\nall over Asia. It's not as though this thing came out of left field again.\nWe've been waiting to see when it would happen,' said Robert Webster, of\nSt. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee.\n[Byline: Tabitha M Powledge]\n--\nGeorge A.

To control the\nspread of the virus, more than 1.5 million chickens and other poultry were\nslaughtered in the Hong Kong area. Since the 1997 outbreak, Hong Kong has\ntaken several steps to reduce the risk of another outbreak. Geese and ducks\nare now slaughtered at a central facility to keep viruses from spreading to\nchicken and other poultry. The 1997 virus is thought to have originated in\ngeese and other birds that live in water and to have crossed over to\nland-living birds.\nAlthough the virus that caused the 1997 outbreak has not reappeared in the\nregion, several viruses believed to be precursors of the species-jumping\nvirus have been detected, according to a report in the June 25th issue of\nthe Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences [ref: Proceedings of\nthe National Academy of Sciences 2002;99:8950-8955; online 19 Jun 2002\n<http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/abstract/132268999v1>]. In fact, between\nFeb and May 2001, several of these viruses moved from geese and ducks to\nchicken and other land poultry, leading to an outbreak of disease in Hong\nKong markets.\nThe viruses found in 2001 'were not the same as those found causing disease\nin man in 1997,' according to J.S.M. Peiris, one of the researchers\ninvolved in the study. The 1997 virus was unique in that it was an avian,\nor bird, virus that directly infected and caused serious illness in people,\nPeiris said. Even though there were no documented cases of human infection\nwith the bird viruses detected recently, Peiris and colleagues found signs\nthat the viruses had changed in certain ways to make it possible to move\nfrom geese and ducks to chicken and other poultry. These changes could have\nalso occurred in the early development of the 1997 virus, according to the\nresearchers. The 2001 viruses were able to infect mice and spread to the\nbrain, which [avian influenza] viruses normally are not capable of\ndoing. These unusual qualities of the virus do not prove that they could\ninfect humans, but they do raise concerns, the authors report.\nUnlike in 1997, in 2001, and during a more recent case in 2002,\nsurveillance of poultry markets provided an early warning, so the outbreak\nwas kept under control. But the researchers note, 'Measures in Hong Kong\nare not likely to reduce the possibility of such a virus arising in the\nwider region of East Asia including southern China that has been recognized\nas an influenza epicenter.'\n[Byline: Merritt McKinney]\n--\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n[The PNAS paper referred to above is entitled: 'Emergence of multiple\ngenotypes of H5N1 avian influenza viruses in Hong Kong SAR,' and is\nauthored by Y.

The\nabstract of the paper states that: Although A/Hong Kong/156/97\n(H5N1/97)-like viruses associated with the 'bird flu' incident in Hong Kong\nSAR have not been detected since the slaughter of poultry in 1997, its\nputative precursors continue to persist in the region. One of these,\nGoose/Guangdong/1/96 (H5N1 Gs/Gd)-like viruses, reassorted with other avian\nviruses to generate multiple genotypes of H5N1 viruses that crossed to\nchickens and other terrestrial poultry from its reservoir in geese. Whereas\nnone of these recent reassortants had acquired the gene constellation of\nH5N1/97, these events provide insight into how such a virus may have been\ngenerated. The recent H5N1 reassortants readily infect and kill chicken and\nquail after experimental infection, and some were associated with\nsignificant mortality of chickens within the poultry retail markets in Hong\nKong.

An H5-specific reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction\nassay was the most sensitive test for rapid diagnosis.
