The meeting was held to review the\nglobal influenza situation and decide the composition for the influenza\nvaccine for the northern hemisphere for winter 2002/03, and was based on\ninformation from the WHO global influenza surveillance programme and the\nPublic Health Laboratory Service (PHLS) surveillance of influenza in\nEngland and Wales.\nIn recent years, 2 subtypes of influenza A have been circulating and\ncausing illness in humans: the H1N1 subtype and the H3N2 subtype. A new\nsubtype, H1N2, has emerged which contains a haemagglutinin (H) component\nwhich is very similar to that contained in the recent H1N1 strains and a\nneuraminidase (N) component which is very similar to that contained in the\ncurrently circulating H3N2 strains. The new subtype appears to have arisen\nby reassortment of the 2 human viruses.\nThe new subtype of the influenza A virus has so far been isolated from\nhumans in England, Israel, and Egypt in the last few weeks. A similar event\noccurred in China during the 1988/89 influenza season when a number of\ninfluenza A(H1N2) isolates were detected which were determined to have\narisen as a result of reassortment. Further spread of these reassortant\nviruses in humans did not occur at that time (2,3).\nReferences:\n1. PHLS.

The meeting was held to review the\nglobal influenza situation and decide the composition for the influenza\nvaccine for the northern hemisphere for winter 2002/03, and was based on\ninformation from the WHO global influenza surveillance programme and the\nPublic Health Laboratory Service (PHLS) surveillance of influenza in\nEngland and Wales.\nIn recent years, 2 subtypes of influenza A have been circulating and\ncausing illness in humans: the H1N1 subtype and the H3N2 subtype. A new\nsubtype, H1N2, has emerged which contains a haemagglutinin (H) component\nwhich is very similar to that contained in the recent H1N1 strains and a\nneuraminidase (N) component which is very similar to that contained in the\ncurrently circulating H3N2 strains. The new subtype appears to have arisen\nby reassortment of the 2 human viruses.\nThe new subtype of the influenza A virus has so far been isolated from\nhumans in England, Israel, and Egypt in the last few weeks. A similar event\noccurred in China during the 1988/89 influenza season when a number of\ninfluenza A(H1N2) isolates were detected which were determined to have\narisen as a result of reassortment. Further spread of these reassortant\nviruses in humans did not occur at that time (2,3).\nReferences:\n1. PHLS.
