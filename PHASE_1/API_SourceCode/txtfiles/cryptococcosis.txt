The hospital has put infection control measures in place, and officials insist it is safe for patients and visitors.\nJeane Freeman [Cabinet Secretary for Health and Sport in the Scottish Government, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_Secretary_for_Health_and_Sport] said there was an 'absolute focus on patient safety'.\n\nAt the weekend, it emerged that 2 patients who had died at the hospital had contracted a cryptococcal fungal infection, which is linked to pigeon droppings. Ms. Freeman said one of the patients was elderly and had died from an unrelated cause, but that the infection had been a 'contributing factor' in the death of a child.\n\nThe likely source of the infection has been traced to a 12th floor [top floor] room containing machinery, which is not open to the public. Ms. Freeman said traces of excrement had been found in the room, where there was a small break in the wall, which was 'invisible to the naked eye'.\n\nThe health secretary spoke to the chief executive of NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde and senior clinical staff to seek reassurance for patients at the hospital. She told MSPs: 'In November [2018?] the bacteria _Cryptococcus_ [sic - _Cryptococcus_ is a fungus, not a bacterium] was identified in one patient. That patient was discharged for palliative care and sadly subsequently died in late December [2018?] - but _Cryptococcus_ was not a contributing factor in the death.\n\n'In December [2018?], a post mortem of a child who had passed away confirmed that _Cryptococcus_ was both present and contributing factor in the death.\n\n'I know I speak for the whole chamber when I say to both families that our thoughts and sympathies go to them.'\n\nThe identification of 2 cases acted as the trigger for additional infection control measures at the hospital, including antifungal treatment for potentially vulnerable patients.\n\nThe health secretary said NHSGGC [National Health Service Greater Glasgow and Clyde] had kept patients and their families updated on an ongoing basis and would ensure they had the opportunity to discuss concerns with the senior clinical team.\n\nPortable HEPA [high-efficiency particulate air] air filter units have been installed in specific areas as an additional precaution. There have been no further cases reported.\n\nMs. Freeman said: 'There are 2 strands to this. The first is to deal with the current infection, which the board has done thoroughly; they've taken all the measures they should take. The other is the building itself. We need to be absolutely sure about the current state of this infrastructure - what do we need to fix, how has that arisen, and what are the lessons for our buildings elsewhere in the health service. That may be in aspects of the design that we weren't aware of at the time, it might be in aspects of the commissioning, it might be maintenance, or maybe a combination of all of those. That work has already been scoped out, and towards the end of this week I will agree with the board what external independent advice they will bring in to ensure that work is taken forward and that I'm assured that we do that as thoroughly and quickly as we possibly can.'\n\nProf. Jason Leitch, NHS Scotland's national clinical director for healthcare quality and strategy, said he was 'assured that this hospital is safe today'. He said: 'That doesn't mean there aren't issues around the building that need reviewed and looked into, both for this building and to learn for Scotland. But I can assure the families who are coming in tomorrow for chemotherapy or coming in this week for bone marrow transplants, that this hospital is safe.'\n\nOn [Sun 20 Jan 2019], former health secretary Alex Neil called for an inquiry into the deaths as it emerged concerns about pigeon numbers at the hospital were raised in December [2018?]. Mr. Neil told BBC Scotland: 'I think there has to be an outside inquiry by experts to find why this happened in the 1st place, secondly how it has been handled by the health board and, thirdly, what precautions need to be taken for the future.'\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[The news article above reports that 2 patients are believed to have acquired cryptococcal infection at Queen Elizabeth University Hospital in Glasgow, Scotland in late 2018 and are attributing these infections to pigeon droppings found in the 12th floor machine room. Both patients, one elderly and the other a child, died; underlying conditions clouded the exact cause of death in the elderly patient, but the infection was thought to have contributed to the death in the child. However, we are not told if either patient had HIV/AIDS or was a transplant-recipient, the usual predisposing conditions, or the type of cryptococcal infection they had, e.g., pulmonary or CNS, the most common clinical manifestations.\n\nCryptococcosis is a fungal disease caused by the encapsulated yeast _Cryptococcus neoformans_ or _C. gattii_. These 2 species have 5 serotypes based on antigenic specificity of the capsular polysaccharide; these include serotypes A, D, and AD (_C. neoformans_) and serotypes B and C (_C. gattii_). The ecologic niches for _C. neoformans_ and _C. gattii_ appear to be distinct. _C. gattii_ lives in the soil and areas on or around trees, such as the eucalyptus. _C. gattii_ is not associated with birds, whereas _C. neoformans_ is found in the accumulated droppings around roosting and nesting sites of birds, especially pigeons. Pigeons are not known to acquire symptomatic disease but can carry cryptococci on feathers, skin, in the crop and cloaca (common cavity into which the intestinal, genital, and urinary tracts open). _Cryptococcus neoformans_ is presumably the cryptococcal species isolated from the patients in the above news report.\n\nCryptococci can become aerosolized when dried bird droppings or contaminated soil are stirred up. People can become infected when they inhale aerosolized cryptococci, which primarily infect the lung, but may subsequently spread systemically via the bloodstream, especially to the central nervous system (where the organisms cause a basilar meningoencephalitis), skin, prostate, and medullary cavity of bones. Pulmonary _C. neoformans_ infection in immunocompetent persons is asymptomatic or resolves without specific therapy. Dissemination of _C. neoformans_ is more likely to occur in immunocompromised patients, especially with defective cell-mediated immunity, e.g., HIV/AIIDS patients or transplant recipients.

The debilitating illness\nattacks the spine and brain, causing severe swelling. It left her\nconfined to a hospital bed in a state of delirium for weeks. But the\nmost devastating side effect is that the patient is now blind.\n\n'Be aware of this disease. It could kill a child in a heartbeat,' the\npatient said in an interview from her hospital bed. 'It could kill a\nsenior in a heartbeat without you even having to worry about the\nsymptoms. It comes on that fast. If you don't realize the symptoms, it\ncould kill you, too.'\n\nHer emotional warning comes on the heels of city council's approval\nearlier this month [April 2011] of a recommendation that it toughen\nits animal control bylaw to allow for fines for feeding pigeons. Once\nthe amendment is drafted and declared law, it will give the city's\nbylaw enforcement officers the power to ticket and fine offenders.\n\nThe patient said she decided to go public about her illness after\nlearning about a recent newspaper story about a problem with pigeon\npoop in the city. 'Please don't feed the pigeons,' she said. 'Try to\nshoo them away if you see them. ... It (the disease) is horrible. The\npain that you get from this disease is crippling. The after-effects\nare with you for life and you just can't stop thinking about it. I\njust want other people to know and try to stay away from pigeons.'\n\nOddly enough, the patient said she has no recollection of ever being\nanywhere near pigeons. 'I am still wondering to this day where I got\nit,' she said. 'I could have stepped in it and brought it into the\nhome. I just don't know.'\n\nThe patient said the symptoms started with a migraine headache that\nwouldn't go away. She was admitted to hospital on [10 Feb 2011] after\nmany days of intense head pain. Shortly after, she went into a\ncoma-like state. 'When I woke up I thought I had a mask over my eyes,\nbut I was wrong. I was blind. I was recently told that I will be blind\nfor the rest of my life. This is a tough thing for a 23-year-old to go\nthrough. ... My world crumbled around me.' The patient said the odds\nof surviving the disease are 50-50. 'However, I managed to make it\nthrough,' she said, battling tears. 'I don't know how but I am still\nhere, and I am glad because I get to warn everyone else of this.'\n\nCristin Muecke, the Health Department's regional medical officer,\nconfirmed the disease is often associated with pigeon droppings. She\nsaid the illness can't be spread person to person and is more common\nwith someone who has immune problems.\n\nThe patient, however, said she has never had a problem with her\nimmune system and that's what's so puzzling about contracting the\naffliction. 'I do not want anyone else to suffer this agonizing\ndisease and I ask anyone who is feeding pigeons to stop,' she said.\n'It's not just a matter of keeping your neighbourhood clean ... it's a\nmatter of keeping people healthy.'\n\n[Byline: Michael Staples]\n\n--\nCommunicated by:\nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n\n[Cryptococcosis is a fungal disease caused by the encapsulated yeast\n_Cryptococcus neoformans_ or _Cryptococcus gattii_.

It has killed\nat least 4 people, as well as a horse, 11 porpoises that washed\nashore, and dozens of cats and dogs. It is 37 times more infectious\non the island than it is in Australia, where it has long been a\nfixture in the environment, an international research team reported\nyesterday [23 Nov 2004] in the Proceedings of the National Academy of\nSciences.\nSymptoms of infection include cough, lethargy, and night sweats. In\nserious cases, the fungus moves from the lungs into the central\nnervous system.\nThe unprecedented BC outbreak, which began in 1999 and continues\ntoday, highlights the need for global monitoring of the fungus, say\nthe scientists, who suspect it may be expanding its range because of\nclimate change. The outbreak was initially linked to Rathtrevor Beach\nProvincial Park in Parksville, but _Cryptococcus_ has now been found\nin soil and on trees from Victoria north to Courtenay.\nThe scientists warn the fungus now has the potential to cause\ninfections in temperate regions around the world. 'From a scientific\npoint of view, it is extraordinary,' says Karen Bartlett, a co-author\nof the report, who studies environment health at the University of BC\n'It is so rare to be right on top of an emerging infectious disease.'\nThe fungi can be deadly when drawn deep into the lungs. The cells\nhave a 'slippery' sugar coating that enables them to evade the lungs'\nprotective cells, which normally engulf and kill infectious\norganisms, says Ms. Bartlett. Being a tropical fungus, _Cryptococcus_\nalso has the ability to thrive at the body's temperature of 37 C that\nkills most other fungi.\nHow and why the tropical fungus took hold on the island is still a\nmystery, but researchers believe it is there to stay. 'I don't think\nit's going to go away anytime soon,' says Sarah Kidd, lead author of\nthe paper, who is now at the University of BC. She has moved from\nAustralia to BC to study the outbreak of the fungus, which is living\nin the soil and under tree bark. It can also survive in seawater,\nwhich could help explain the porpoise deaths.\nMs. Bartlett suspects _Cryptococcus gattii_ may have been on\nVancouver Island at low levels for a long period, but no one noticed,\nbecause it was incapable of becoming airborne and infecting people or\nanimals. She says something changed in the late 1990s. The leading\ntheory is that the eastern coast of Vancouver Island has become\nwarmer and drier, making the region more hospitable. Or, perhaps, the\nresearchers say, logging and urban development opened up a new niche\nfor the fungus. It may have been imported on a plant from the tropics.\nWhile _Cryptococcus_ has proven more infectious on Vancouver Island,\nthe researchers stress that it isn't as lethal, or as fast-spreading,\nas many other pathogens. 'The attack rate is still quite low,' says\nMs. Bartlett. Vancouver Island has 37 infections a year for every one\nmillion people, compared to about one case a year for every one\nmillion people in Australia.

Source: Ottawa Citizen [edited]\n<http://www.ottawacitizen.com/>\n\nA tropical fungus that has taken hold in temperate British Columbia\nis more infectious and deadly on Vancouver Island than anywhere else\non Earth. The unprecedented BC outbreak, which began in 1999 and continues\ntoday, highlights the need for global monitoring of the fungus, say\nthe scientists, who suspect it may be expanding its range because of\nclimate change. The cells\nhave a 'slippery' sugar coating that enables them to evade the lungs'\nprotective cells, which normally engulf and kill infectious\norganisms, says Ms. Bartlett. Ms. Bartlett suspects _Cryptococcus gattii_ may have been on\nVancouver Island at low levels for a long period, but no one noticed,\nbecause it was incapable of becoming airborne and infecting people or\nanimals. It is 37 times more infectious\non the island than it is in Australia, where it has long been a\nfixture in the environment, an international research team reported\nyesterday From a scientific\npoint of view, it is extraordinary,' says Karen Bartlett, a co-author\nof the report, who studies environment health at the University of BC\n' \nProMED-mail\n<promed@promedmail.org>\n tg/msp/jw\n*##########################################################*\n************************************************************\n* Vancouver Island has 37 infections a year for every one\nmillion people, compared to about one case a year for every one\nmillion people in Australia. Being a tropical fungus, _Cryptococcus_\nalso has the ability to thrive at the body's temperature of 37 C that\nkills most other fungi. Older men are most vulnerable to infection, perhaps because they tend\nto spend a lot of time outdoors, says Laura MacDougall, an\nepidemiologist at the BC Centre for Disease Control. She has moved from\nAustralia to BC to study the outbreak of the fungus, which is living\nin the soil and under tree bark. Or, perhaps, the\nresearchers say, logging and urban development opened up a new niche\nfor the fungus. In\nserious cases, the fungus moves from the lungs into the central\nnervous system. While _Cryptococcus_ has proven more infectious on Vancouver Island,\nthe researchers stress that it isn't as lethal, or as fast-spreading,\nas many other pathogens. ' It has killed\nat least 4 people, as well as a horse, 11 porpoises that washed\nashore, and dozens of cats and dogs. There is less risk of infection in the\nwinter months, perhaps because BC's rains wash the _Cryptococcus_\nparticles out of the air. The leading\ntheory is that the eastern coast of Vancouver Island has become\nwarmer and drier, making the region more hospitable. The outbreak was initially linked to Rathtrevor Beach\nProvincial Park in Parksville, but _Cryptococcus_ has now been found\nin soil and on trees from Victoria north to Courtenay.", "reports": [{"diseases": ["other", "cryptococcosis"], "syndromes": [], "event_date": ["1999-03-24 00:00:00", "2004-03-24 00:00:00"], "locations": [{"location": "Rathtrevor Beach", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "British Columbia", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Vancouver Island", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Provincial Park", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Victoria", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Parksville", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Cryptococcus", "country": "unknown"}, {"location": "Australia", "country": "unknown"}]}]}], "cryptococcosis_num_of_articles": "3"}
